Lithium is useless outside a niche antipsychotic. China has already created I fluently better sodium battery tech, lithium is obsolets
Globalism is dying, none of those products will happen, especially not a, slow, dirty truck system. It would be a train if it ever happened
Find a way to reuse the same water instead of dumping it in the ocean.
Talk about the failure of the Panama upswell that happened in 2025?
I find it extremely hard to believe that engineers can't find some way to pump water from the very nearby oceans into the canal's locks and find some way to make it work.
It's worth mentioning that Drake's Passage is a notoriously difficult and dangerous area to sail through
So much channels blame ONLY Climate change, like, everything water related. But it's HUMANITY that do not use the water right/effectively that makes a bit less rain a problem. So climate change is only saying to everyone we need to change! I am getting so sick of everything being climate change and people use this to make everything more expensive/dictatorshippy. People need to do better! Climate change is a natural proces we need to adjust to.
People need to stop wasting water, need to work more together, work smarter and do better. But we keep on failing.
Useless wars will never end so.
How about using sea water?
Might be worth mentioning that the houthis are targeting ships bound for israel, and not just every merchant vessel
Why can’t they pump the water back in after the first lock. That would cut the loss by 75% if there are 4 locks.
they have to build small reservoirs on each side, at least they could reuse some of the water, or use it as drinking water for the population instead of wasting it...
>build giant canal >create reservoirs to feed canal >massive amount of cargo passes through, making massive amounts of money >people move close to canal >people become dependent on the water in the reservoir for the canal >canal gets rationed >"climate change" is blamed
Why do you repeat all the information about half way through your videos. You repeat the same info over and over again. I have to stop watching these videos. It’s frustrating.
the unbelievable toll it took on human lives to build that canal is worth a separate video! Path between Seas by McCullough is an incredibly dry but fascinating read
It is falling apart because it is not being run by America and by an incompetent Panama.
Try praying for rain 🌧️  If praying doesn’t get any rain try living by the Holy teachings of Jesus. Listening to scientific theories that don’t consider the will of our creator fall short of the truth…
La Nina happened and then El Nino. Thankfully since this episode aired, rains have returned to normal an trade has stabilized.
Is there an Update on this?
You forgot to mention the Northwest Passage.  Once that ice opens up consistently, trade through Panama or these alternatives will drop dramatically.  They will still remain useful routes for countries on continents in the southern hemisphere, but the Northwest Passage will be a shorter route with much higher capacity for the Northern Hemisphere.  As a Canadian, I really hope that our government can effectively manage this corridor to benefit the Canadian economy.
Propaganda
That happens if you give this kind of projects back to a 3rdworld country. Just try to find a solution when its to late.
5:05 "I will take things that will NOT happen for $1000 please Alex."....AHIMSA!!!!🕉
This is easy to resolve pump salt water for the initial 2 gates, only use fresh water in the final gate, Recirculate the fresh water in the final gate into a reservoir for reuse to avoid contamination with the lake, rinse and repeat in the other side.
Instead of pumping it in the ocean why not pump it in a resavoir or in the lake?
I enjoy your posts, but please stop acting like "t's are "d"s. It is is obnoxious and unnecessary.
YT has started pushing just floods of insanely blatant stupid AI videos in my feed, with blatant propaganda,  .......... ez way to get your customers 2 leave fast :D
Yeah we all know how the Panama canal works thanks for a boring video
I can tell you that this is far from the truth and probably a narrative that didn't age well... this video was made last year in January 2024... why do you think fast-forward to this year the government in the United States wants the Panama Canal back... I just came back from Panama and trust me the Panama Canal is stronger than ever and even more ambitious than ever. That's why it was widen nearly 10 years ago.
China
Seems like a simple solution. Just stop wasting the water and reuse it.
china bult deep sea harbor in peru connected to the southamerican railway system which is being extended and modernised, america jerks off on their tariffs, panama canal will become obsolete
JC is a fine caring man but a misguided President. Example....giving away the Panama canalt to a country that can't afford to maintain it.
This sounds like a Chinese marketing clip with western AI DUBBED voice over.  It is a new age of deception.  There is no consideration to America's striking ecology or native peoples.  Just huge debt trap infrastructure loans.  And the seemingly are hell-bent on destroying on the Panama Canal.  Yep, definitely Asian based biased.
So Panama’s true issue with the canal is the fact that they use fresh water instead of sea water,  if it was salt water lake they could just use the pacific and Atlantic Ocean waters back and forth without issue
Because America is coming, the Panama Canal is dying
There is already a railroad parallel to the Panama canal.  It carries as much freight, roughly, as the canal itself.   Climate change?  I looked up the rainfall by year in Panama.   It's not raining less in Panama.   Why then is water becoming an issue in Panama?  Because of an increase in ship traffic.
To be precise, the year 2000 is not the start of a new millenium, 2001 is.
Minute 13:06: that doesn't matter, as the amout of water needed to raise any floating object stays the same. you need the required height x width x length of water, additionally to the water that is there in the first place
Why does Colombia not make a rail way from Antado to Titumate, this would make the track softer, and make it faster to get stuff from one coast to the other.
seems an easy way to fix some of this would be to ship from the east coast if you're going east, and the west if you're going west. doesn't make a whole lot of sense to move your goods to the east coast, and then bitch about having to get to the other side of the continent via ship.
Climatologists, the globe has gone thru 20 heating and ice age cycles, also Climatologists we are currently at the end of an ice age, also Climatologists humans are causing global warming! News flash, we are still significantly below known historical CO2 levels. Recent climate studies yes several have come out comparing human emissions to natrual emissions, found humans create like 2% of global "greenhouse gas".
Who was like this is a great way to build the canal 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was wondering if it would be possible to reuse the water of the panama canal. If you would be able to catch the water that would flow to the ocean, and pump it back to the other side, then you could reuse it and lower the use of water in total. Has this been considered? Are there major downsides to this? I can think of the logistical problem of building this technology and providing enough energy (possibly by solar), but I do not think that this would be bigger obstacles than the other alternatives
so whats preventing them from creating a mechanism to reuse the millions of fresh water used for these locks?
Radio microphone = nostalgia
This lack of water was already discussed before the second set of canal locks was built. Adding second set locks to a canal to increase traffic also increases the use of water.   Not a real surprise, but something that was actively forgotten in the process of the canal expansion.
I wouldn't be surprised if the US is now one of the most corrupt.
why don't they just simply reverse the flow after each ship passes? Then it doesn't actually require any or at least only enough to account for evaporation.
Why dont they build a road across central america instead of all the way across south america?
Panama canal is building a new network system that retains the water!!!
Lake Nicaragua is hilariously shallow. Most people also don't mention that.
Build water pumps and pump salt water, build a secondary canal this way. I’m 10 min in, I guess this option is probably mentioned later
No way china wont Block the canal  by any means possible just to gain more days for Taiwan invasion
Okay guys I’m no scientist or engineer or any other person who knows about anything. BUT HEAR ME OUT!!! America has lots of nukes. What if we evacuated everyone out of the area and then nuked a route through Panama connecting the two oceans?
No pumping, that would be impossible. Very sloppy
Derr of this is dhg
for the bi oceanic corridor why don't they use trains? there would be more capacity would there not? unless I'm missing something
is the audio bad on this video?
33:30 Or, and hear me out, instead of letting the water drain from the lowest chamber into the ocean, pumping it back up and reuse later. That would have been hard when the canal opened, but should be a piece of cake these days, with only a few days of shutdown while it is installed.
29:33 Trump:  Hold my beer.
I'm sorry for asking you know that mini black hole are being created but if we suspend a black hole in a magnetic alteration then we can extract all the fuel which it propels from which in itself
Or supporting a black hole in a magnetic field and extracting the energy that it provides
Maybe Panama should use this time to clean their damn lake shores!?
⚠⚠⚠⚠use⚠⚠⚠⚠caution⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠😯😯‼‼‼‼⚠
Never should have handed it back. Should have just kept it
yoooo 4:36  a rewind selectah!!!  argentina is your #2 in development? bitch please, cant even have a stable currency  watchuon about boyyyyy
green energy = fooled ya!
This guys videos are getting wayyy too misleading and manipulative of the facts.
It seems better sense to pump sea water directly to the Panama Canal & the fresh river water throughout the country to be purified & stored in large storage tanks later to be used by citizens.
Hmmm  needs updating,  obviously the US under the Trump administration has become the most  corrupt country (on Earth)
Will the swamp be tried to the Houti's also?
this is again typical .. building such a vital project just on wasting valuable ressources like drinking water. reducing ships btw. is stacking them up, the backlog then again uses more water - crazy!
If it’s built by America it should be owned and run by America
why didnt they build a huge reservoir where they can pump water in and out as they need it. They wouldnt be having the problem of losing water.
OK, CIA.
there are muLtipLe methods to use ocean water or eliminate fresh water waste,  and end this panama water shortage nonsense😂🎉 but of course   the engineers cant do much when the criminaLs are in charge of the governmnTz    and paying for these videos   supporting the nonsense !
Wait another 10 years and there will be canals and transportation systems that will diminish the utility of the Panama Canal.
why don't they fill the first lock with a pump from the sea water then you only drain the seawater back out?
Panama's lack of optimum planning and maintenance dooms the canal.
More climate change b.s.    just stop
Then use seawater for PUMPING into the locks , the narration said that fresh water is used by pumping, I question it,  but.
Must be a Chinese conspiracy like Trump said
Whenever I think of Panama I just sit, and ease the seat back...
Why don’t they recapture the freshwater from the canal for the people
“Planned to get started eventually” Ahh I too dabble in the procrastination arts
Free 🇵🇸
Why not pump salt water. We pump oil for thousands of kilometers effortlessly.
Canals don't "die". This is leftist rhetoric popular on YouTube. Consider: there was no El Nino before the 70s--it was a political invention of the Left to manipulate opinion of TV viewers to manage their opinions. Problems could be blamed on nature/the weather, and politics/political leaders could not be blamed. How convenient!
The Panama Canal was expanded with bigger water locks. Why you did not bring that up that information, In the 1970's, it was global cooling Next was global cooling, and know it is climate change.
What is the forth most developed nation in South America?
Yes only in you dreams the Panama Canal is die.Great lie.
Can you think of anything more foolish than Jimmy's gift?
no more canals. they’re destroying the nature and taking away fresh water needed for life. the corrupt government will make it worst and the ppl/ citizen will stay in a bad situation.😢
Strategic mistake giving up the canal. Should of annexed Greenland in 1945 as reward for saving Denmark from Hitler. Should of taken Canada in 1812 for allowing the British to attack us and burn down our White House. Should of kept Mexico after we defeated them in the Mexican war of 1849. We would not have the border and tradr problems we have today. This is why we must elect smart Presidents who can think ahead😮
LOL... so theyre calling it "climate variability" now? thanks youtube, really helpful "context" there... we went from GLOBAL WARMING to CLIMATE CHANGE to CLIMATE VARIABILITY... almost as if there are TOO MANY VARIABLES TO BE DEFINITIVE......
The US should just dig a trench between itself and Mexico. Then they get their own canal, AND they no longer have to build a wall
god that voice
A man, a plan, a canal; Panama.  Congrats! You just read the longest known palindrome that also makes sense.
❤😅😢😊
That problem held truth with the old canal built by the US. The new canal is built with several artificiàllakes called pools, and the water is re usable. You are talking something that old info. Do your homework, go to the canalr and they will explain it to you, also there candles substantially larger.
Why not pump seawater into the locks instead of fresh water?
Can someone explain why they didn't dig the canal to be closer to sea level? It seems like it would be way more cost effective, long term, than pumping millions upon millions of gallons of year worth of drinkable water.  In south America too, which by my understanding is pretty arid, and drinkable water is probably more valuable than most other places.
Your lock demonstration is very inefficient. Each lock except 1 should contain a boat getting ready to go up to the next level. . Lock1 should pump water up to lock 2 to raise to lock 3 level >>> therefore only one lock full of water goes to see per 3 boats.
I feel like a moron. I thought all along that the Panama Canal was simply a gigantic deep ditch dug all the way across the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific thus connecting the two oceans
simple fix....use the ocean water....or is that just to easy?
Why not dig a tunnel for ships? Humanity has accumulated a huge amount of experience in the production of tunnels for trains and cars. A larger tunnel is needed for ships, in my opinion, this is realistic.
why can’t they just recycle the same volume of water over and over again? ⁉️💁🏼‍♂️ each ship going through produces enough energy to recycle its own volume of water each time it’s used  💁🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ and the problem with the panama canal is that there has literally been a century of corruption infrastructure built in that they are not easily going to relinquish that easy money they’ve been getting for the good of everyone else  💁🏼‍♂️‼️
why can’t they just recycle the same volume of water over and over again? ⁉️💁🏼‍♂️ each ship going through produces enough energy to recycle its own volume of water each time it’s used  💁🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
why can’t they just recycle the same volume of water over and over again? ⁉️💁🏼‍♂️
Why not having two ships. One on each end. Containers filling with goods and materials will be moving by trains to the other ends and the second ship will carry on the journey to destinations. Or better yet one more trainrail to increase capacity.
charge the usa 50% extra to use the canal
班代表： 為何巴拿馬運河正在「死去」 巴拿馬運河，曾是全球貿易的命脈之一，正面臨前所未有的危機。這座連接太平洋與大西洋的關鍵航道，現在正遭遇一連串的挑戰，不僅是自然災害的影響，也包括全球貿易流通的不確定性。 自然因素與氣候變遷的挑戰 巴拿馬運河的運作依賴於精巧的水位控制系統，這需要大量的淡水來維持運河的運行。然而，當地正遭遇前所未有的乾旱，尤其在2023年，受到厄爾尼諾氣候現象的影響，巴拿馬的降水量大幅下降，10月的降水量比歷史同期低了41%，創下自1950年代以來的最低紀錄。這直接影響了運河主要的水源——湖蓋頓與湖阿哈，湖水水位大幅下降，導致運河的水源短缺，並使得運河不得不限制通行船隻數量，甚至有時達到18艘的低點，這是運河有史以來的最低紀錄。   經濟與戰略影響 巴拿馬運河不僅對巴拿馬經濟至關重要，對全球貿易的流動性也具有不可替代的作用。約5%的全球貿易流量經由此運河，每年為巴拿馬政府帶來約43.2億美元的收入，這相當於該國**65%**的GDP。若運河運行受阻，不僅影響巴拿馬經濟，也將擾亂全球貿易流通，尤其是美國與亞洲、歐洲之間的貨物運輸。   艱難的選擇：水資源分配 當運河的運作需求與民生用水需求相互衝突時，巴拿馬政府面臨艱難的抉擇。湖蓋頓不僅是運河的主要水源，也是巴拿馬超過420萬人的飲用水來源。每艘船通過運河，消耗的水量相當於50萬人一天的用水量。因此，巴拿馬政府必須選擇是否繼續優先保障運河的運行，還是將水源更多分配給民生使用。 運河的未來與全球貿易的變革 目前，巴拿馬運河的瓶頸問題嚴重影響全球航運。船隻需等待數週，甚至23天才能通行，這使得航運公司不得不選擇繞道南美洲或非洲的長途航線。然而，紅海和蘇伊士運河也同樣面臨著衝突和安全問題。這些複合的問題加劇了全球貿易的不確定性，也讓全球貿易成本不斷上升，進一步推高了通脹壓力。 結語 巴拿馬運河的困境顯示了氣候變遷、自然災害以及地緣政治衝突如何交織在一起，對全球貿易與經濟造成深遠影響。未來，運河是否能夠恢復正常運行，仍然充滿不確定性。而全球貿易將不得不面對新的挑戰，船隻航行的成本將直接反映在我們的生活中。為何巴拿馬運河面臨危機：新興競爭與氣候變遷的挑戰 巴拿馬運河作為全球貿易的關鍵交通樞紐，已經服務了超過百年，但隨著氣候變遷和其他新興貿易路線的發展，這一傳奇性運輸通道正面臨前所未有的挑戰。近年來，來自南美洲和中美洲的新競爭者正逐步成為巴拿馬運河的對手，可能威脅到其長久以來在全球貿易中的主導地位。  新的貿易路徑：巴拉圭的雙海走廊 其中一個最具潛力的競爭者來自巴拉圭。該國正在建設一條名為「雙海走廊」的全新運輸路線，預計將於2025年完工。這條走廊將連接巴西西南部的農產品運輸與智利的太平洋港口，減少依賴巴拿馬運河的需求。對於巴西和阿根廷來說，這不僅能加速出口到亞洲的速度，還能降低物流成本。巴拉圭的這一項目，尤其是在鋰三角區（智利、玻利維亞和阿根廷）擁有大量鋰資源的背景下，可能會成為全球綠色能源貿易的關鍵路徑，並成為21世紀的重要貿易走廊。  哥倫比亞的跨海鐵路計劃 此外，哥倫比亞也計劃建設一條連接加勒比海和太平洋的鐵路系統。這條名為「跨海鐵路」的計劃將突破安第斯山脈的地理障礙，預計會在2026年開工建設。一旦完成，這條鐵路將能夠快速地將貨物從一個海岸運輸到另一個海岸，成為巴拿馬運河的有力競爭者，尤其是在全球貿易的東西兩岸之間。  尼加拉瓜運河的夢想 長久以來，尼加拉瓜曾提出在尼加拉瓜運河建設一個新的運輸通道的構想，這個計劃的設計也許能與巴拿馬運河媲美。然而，這一構想面臨諸多挑戰，包括環境問題和資金不足，且在2015年後，由於中國投資者的財務危機，這一項目基本上無望實現。儘管該國政府曾經雄心勃勃，但由於政局不穩和腐敗問題，這一運河計劃也顯得愈發渺茫。  墨西哥的跨海走廊 最後，墨西哥也開始重啟一項古老的計劃——塔瓦內克運河。此計劃將重新啟用塔瓦內克鐵路，並將兩岸的港口現代化，預計這條新的運輸路徑將於2030年代初期投入使用。這一計劃不僅有望促進墨西哥南部的經濟發展，也能提供一條比巴拿馬運河更快、更便宜的貿易選擇，對巴拿馬運河的未來形成強大挑戰。  巴拿馬運河的未來：競爭與氣候變遷的雙重考驗 隨著氣候變遷的影響愈加明顯，巴拿馬運河的運營正遭遇越來越多的挑戰。運河依賴的水源越來越不穩定，可能導致通行能力下降。此外，以上四個新興的貿易路徑將逐步搶占巴拿馬運河的市場份額。如果巴拿馬無法及時對運河進行升級和改善，未來可能會失去其在全球貿易中的重要性。 對巴拿馬來說，必須提前做好準備，採取必要的措施，才能保持其在全球貿易中的競爭力。面對來自南美洲和中美洲的新興競爭，巴拿馬運河將如何適應這些變化，仍然是一個需要關注的關鍵問題。 總結 隨著全球貿易的變動與氣候變遷的挑戰，巴拿馬運河正處於一個危機四伏的十字路口。新興的貿易路線如巴拉圭的雙海走廊、哥倫比亞的跨海鐵路、尼加拉瓜運河以及墨西哥的跨海走廊，都可能成為未來全球貿易的重要競爭者，這讓巴拿馬運河面臨前所未有的挑戰。如果巴拿馬未能及時應對這些變化，可能將失去其長期主導地位。
North passage will destroy all the carnals! Panama doesn't have to give it back in working order!
Climate change which is largely causedby earths polar axis. Might open up northern passage.
Upgrade the existing Rail line. JUST KEEP china OUT OF IT
Hope Nicaragua  have enough natural water  available.  Plus. China's involvement  is a threat  to world Trade and world Security.  Beware.
I just they Paraguay  road project. Also eliminates the cartels
Panama Canal clogged causing incalculable losses to Maritime Navegation.  Anther Routes through train - Mexico will not be able to Modernize ists Ports and Trian Lines to various Ports. USA has to the same coast to coast and modernize its Ports. Return the Canal to USA becouse Panama did nothing for the Canal.....
Couldnt they pump mass amount of air from under the canal to increase water volume?
at 24:05 the Protesters are carrying signs that say FREE IRAN and other crap , NOTHING to do with this Topic and the VIDEO has NOTHING NEW about Trump and NEW PLANS its just another old Panama Canal Lesson.   STUPID CLICKBAIT , YET AGAIN a HUGE WASTE of my Time.
Wouldn't it be much better to do the bi oceanic corridor as train tracks rather than roads?
It's the American Canal
I feel like you get a kickback every time you say the words “climate change” on this channel.

That war NEVER ENDS.  THOSE MUSLIMS ARE BORN TO WAR!!!  THEIR RELIGION IS THE WORST
Solution instead of dumping lock 1s back in to the sea on eother side ..they create other  locks at esch end save locks call them .lthat they pump that water in to then pump that back in to the 2nd lock system this the system is reusing the water and none get wasted but that would be £ spending i bet none want to do ... Morons just dump it they could cycle it back in to the system if they used there brain instead of just dumping it .. there is solutions but i bet they involve spending money no one wants to spend .
What would the financial and environmental cost to use a system of balloons (open to interpretation) to raise the ships slightly making them require less water to transport be? 🧐
Lithium you say? Hmmm.
...water has been taken from the canal from the infamoys mining.
PS somebody tell Trump and musk. Sure definitely investment opportunity.
what is this biggest big deal. On the last canal pump, the water back into the freaking lock system in time drought pumps. We have the technology rise and pump in the ocean when it drain into a wet reservoir or rather and pump into the ocean pump up to in the canal aboveand pointers doesn't have to be 100% conservation what the hell do I know this stupid plumber?

Don't compare apples with oranges: have a look at the transportation costs and energy needs of transporting 1 ton of goods by a) truck b) train c) ship. Therefore, even a railroad system or a transcontinental highway may have a similar capacity as a few dozen ships along a canal, it will be much more expensive and less attractive.
Question this dude  knows so much. About that country why dont he fix things in his own house before he goes to fix something in somebody else house as for. If you aint here to help me without controling get the fuk out this is my house you are not going to control my income they been fine for 25 yrs let them work lt out my house is my house this guy is a trip he act like US shit dont stink last days  confusion lawlessness father of lies is running things wisdom has left our country all for the love of money dont care about the people that live there we should be build roads to connect not divide if you can not help me get fuck out I can do it myself nothing is impossible for me try solve your own problems first money money
the devil is a lier and the father if all lies insread if help want control if snother counties wealth money money money our current leader all he see is money not helping but taking control wisdom has left our country😂😂😮😮
The canal needs more water. Maybe they can rectify that with a way to use sea water.
Mic sounds like absolute shit
This is an issue that needs a bigger solution than lake water. They need to put in a plant that can convert seawater to freshwater. The sea is unlimited. The salt is a problem, i know but there has to be a better way than using drinking water.
To fix the Panama canal, you can simply use water from the ocean lmao. Out of so much water at their disposal, they chose to waste drinking water 😂  Also, can't you just invest more money to level the river on the sea's level so you don't have to raise levels like that? Not like 25m is a lot of digging. Just hire the Chinese, they'll finish it within a month or two for the entire canal.
Um… All they have to do is install PUMPS to pump the lower lock fresh water back up into the lake.  I mean, it’s great that their system now relies on gravity, but there is no reason at all that they HAVE to throw all that water into the ocean.  You just need to pump it back uphill.
Miss managment number one
bc chinese
All of this is a good reason for the USA 🇺🇸 to take it back!!
I lived in Panama from 92-95 while my dad was working on a project to widen and recirculate the water. We knew this was going to happen especially if they made it wider and they didn't listen. I'm actually surprised it didn't happen sooner and be worse 😮
What Panama needs to do is install a working desalination  plant to make their own water .
Why don’t they use sea water?
Panama canal is not running dry and rainfall has been within the expected range, with short lasting droughts here and there. Just google this data, it's easy. Stop with the garbage climate propaganda
The new millenium began on Jan. 1, 2001.  Learn how to count.
Construct two nuclear power plants in Panama, one near each end of the canal.  Modify the locks to be filled from sea water instead of lake water, at least for the lower most locks.  Only the upper most lock would be filled using lake water.   The plants would supply plenty of electrical power for the country in general, plus power for the lock pumps.  Concurrently, build a massive rail system across Panama to connect two large shipping ports as an alternative path.  Ships can unload containers on one coast to cross the country by continually running rails to the opposite side and be reloaded on another  container ship.  By rail, the time to cross could be as low as one to two hours.
Not an expert here, by no means, but what about pumping the fresh water back up into a higher reservoir instead of wasting it into the sea? With all the (self imposed) restrictions they had to make to maintain operation there must be some point where such a solution becomes financial viable, assuming it's technical possible...
In dry seasons pump the water back to the lakes not the ocean. It will cost alot to redirect but may be expiry h it in the future!!!
It they are sooo wealthy through the canal, why aren’t they doing the maintenance to hey cannot be considered good stewards. Take it back and give Panama a sovereign base percentage income!
"about precisely" 😂oxymoron of 2025 congrats!
Instead of trucks connecting the oceans would trains be much more efficient?
just add pumps to put the water back in the lake not out to see
23:30 why did the build a highway? I mean sure, tolls on trucks may be easier to enforce than tolls on trains, i don't know, but a trucking route degrades faster than rails, takes more manpower, has to have rest stops for the drivers which cannot drive without pause, which isn't as large of a problem for train drivers, and it's less space and energy efficient. Rail can be a true competitor to shipping, volume wise, trucking cannot. If we take ten thousand containers per ship (largest is around 14.500) that is ten thousand trucks and drivers needed, if they manage to double containers per truck somehow, it's still five thousand. If we take 740 meters per train (longest allowed in germany), that is about 35 wagons per train, with, at most, 4 persons, 2 drivers, 2 engineers, and if they run modern, electrical engines, speeds that go up to 120 km/h (allowed maximum in germany again). As trucks are normally 80 km/h (again, allowed maximum in germany), they could transport a lot more cargo with trains than with trucks, and that even electrical, if they wanted to. Making this corridor a highway is hella inefficient.
Wow this aged terribly
Ok, its been almost one year since the Panama Canal dried up due to a rare but cyclical drought.  The canal(s) must receive 300 inches of rainfall per year to operate.  This area of Panama receives on average 350 inches.  The rains have returned,  The Chagres River is full again and so is Lake Gatun as its more of a man made lake than a canal.  The biggest threat to America is the fact the Chinese are running ports on both sides and are building and financing canals and railways for containers in Mexico, Nicaragua and Colombia. All this during Biden's Commitment to the CCP.  This will take away America's advantage of having naval vessels on both the Atlantica and Pacific sides of the country! WAKE UP AMERICA, THE CHINESE OWNED MEDIA IS PUTTING US TO SLEEP WHILE PERFECTLY PLANTING THE EVIL SEEDS OF DIVISION AMONGST US....
Cant stand the Ai narrator. Or AI narrators in general. Tune out very quickly
Yet someone thinks they can CONTROL THE WEATHER!
Why not build a train that basically runs parallel to the canal? Or 2, 3 or 4????  Why South America where the land is wider??? 😂
Why do they need to dump the water down the line to the sea?  Why can’t they just pump it in and out of a reservoir adjacent to the lock.  You know, reengineer how the locks flow water.
Is there no way to pump the water back to the lake instead of dumping into the ocean?
Start of the new millennium was on January 1, 2001, not January 1, 2000.
Why didn't they hire a real engineer and instead of draining the water out why don't they pump it into the next lock
It needs to be bigger to handle the traffic. Good thing America has a new sheriff.
This isn’t aging well
Correct me if I`m wrong, aren`t the container ships coming and going from the Atlantic and the Pacific ???? If so, then why can`t they just pump sea water in to the locks instead of fresh water, simples.
Why cant they suck the water out of tge ocean its self.
Desalination of seawater and possibly nuclear energy (to raise water from seas) can be used
So why don't they use the fresh water dumped into the sea to supply the country's water system ? Or pump it back to the second lock ? Seems to be a lot of short-term thinking going on.
Fun to hear the word unprecedented about panama in jan25
On the contrary, it's busier than ever. I was just there: ships lined up beyond the horizon, 1-2 miles apart in the Caribbean.
Reuse the water. Pump the water back upstream. I don't see any realistic argument against this. Of course it will cost money. This becomes an upkeep expense that should be paid for by the billions collected for passage tolls.
Tell me something new
neat, seen more colour and detail of south america through your video than other resources i seen. edit i also remember seeing a project for a helium balloon in the sky gaining water onto dimples on the plastic.  the water downfall could be used for electricity. i wonder if these could be used to help refill the lake, reducing water rations. i doubt it could work fast enough for replacing all of the water used, just adding more to the lake.
It is pronounced "Nijjjaragua"
Trump will change Nicaragua's standing in the corruption rating.
The lithium mining will be the new Saudi Arabia,  and again will cause western countries the desire to capitulate or invade invade.
It’s not a bribe, it’s fast pass
The war around the Suez has been going on for thousands of years. With western influence, they don't look to end anytime soon.
The people will eventually lose out. But people don't worry, if Trump gets his way you will have much worse things to worry about.
This bit of propaganda designed to justify Americas competition for most greed will be lost on most ppl. As an American, I see bridge, tunnel and highway tolls constantly rise. We can’t demand of others what we can’t demand of the oligarchs of America. We have no moral foundation upon which to stand. The oligarchs will not send their son and daughters to die for their country, but they have no qualms about our blood running in the streets while they continue to enrich themselves.

Seriously, why don't they just dig a hole next to the locks and drain them into the reservoir rather than constantly downstream, then pump it back into the same lock? Recycle the water when you have to conserve it.   For the price of a few excavations and concrete and a few pumps, you're back in business running your monopoly at full strength again, and profits can be spent buying more pumps to fill the locks faster and ruin more ships through until you max out your logistics.
America  needs to take Panama canal back because there's  a lot repairs need & they can't  afford  to make the repairs  .China will stick  there nose in & tell Panama  we will make the repairs & over charge Panama after about  years or two Panama can't pay it back China  will reposses it & pay people  in government money probly  under table & take it .What do you think this will do for America.  TRUMP is right we paid to build it let take it back .
Trail of tears ad info request?
Climate change my *ss… Climate change, climate change - brain washing
with 4b $$$$ you can't create system to pump that same water to a lake and reuse it?! that is brain breaking
Wouldn't it be logical to base the naval response assets on the other side of USA (Washington) if they believe there may be future conflict with China over there, rather than trekking through the Panama canal?
@5:07 ??????????
The US owns the canal.  We gave control to it is all.  We bought it from Panama then we bought it again from the land owners.
Here before Trump takes it back
😊 Saudi 😊 likes high oil 🪔 prices😊 when people enjoy using 19th Century engineering 😊
Over a century later, is it still impossible to build a sea level crossing canal in Panama?  26 m doesn’t seem prohibitively high to overcome.  This would not only eliminate the need for rain water to fill the canal but vastly increase the size of ships able to transit, leading to more revenue.
Why are 20% of the comments: "just built a perpetual motion device and scale it to millions of metric tons. They could be doing this already"
Panama city is on the pacific ocean, puctures of panama city show the tides of the pacific and not the effect of climate change on the gatun lake
This would be EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE,  but...  what if you were to isolate the canal from fresh water.  Put artificial levies along both sides.  Then, install massive pumps to use salt water for the entire length,   This would allow the fresh water to be used by Panama and no longer waste it.  Obviously I am no expert, I am just spitballing.  On top of the expense, there are most likely environmental concerns that I haven't considered.
And now US wanted to cut the ship queue line
As plugged up as the Panama Canal is now from backed up shipping it would probably be quicker just to go around the continent of South America then to pay the Chinese, whom Panama sold the canal to. Just like it’s better to be dead then red I’d rather be poor then beg to red.
Desalination plants on both sides of the canal, future proof its use
Interesting that they didn't have to engineer anything for the Earth curvature the whole thing one side to the other is pretty far
With Warming the NW Passage is opening up so thats an option.
THE US MUST TAKE IT BACK.ASAP
The time and fuel it takes to go around Africa or South America are small inconveniences compared to the very real risk of sinking your ship rounding the tips of these continents.  Other than Antarctica, these are the two most dangerous places to sail.
All you would have to do is pump the water from the first lock back to the lake. Then you wouldn't lose any water.  It didn't used to be needed, but the change to the canal wouldn't even require it to be taken out of service to fix this.
The total and complete mismanagement of the Panama Canal started the first day China took over.
Install Big pumps to raise the level vs gravity. You wouldn't have to pump all the time but when water levels in the lake are low.
Well well well mericaa is cominnnn🦅🦅🦅
"... before climate change was understood..."  so tomorrow then.
Why is rhe Canada west coast using the route? Cant ships dock on the east and cargo shipped from Labrador to inland?
Ummm we own the canal. Its like when I give my kids a phone and they think they have a phone. As far as Im concerned, we own everything in North and Central America. Canada exists because we allow it. Mexico exists because we allow it to.
Create a series of fresh water reservoirs. Isolate the canal. Fill its entire length with salt water.
Update: as of December 2024 Lake Gatun is nearing an all time high.
Your race Trac speech lost me after the first paragraph.. remember..your not at your multi screens playing games with others trying to destroy each other..the speed involved to gain uperhand which requires speed..has unfortunately set itself in your brain cells influencing your manner of speech..your not alone  people of your generation spend hours playing those video games
Birth of new choke points.
Water can be pumped from the lower lake into the lock.
I live in Panama City, and can see the machines for unloading ships at Puerto de Balboa, when I look west from my balcony, and the pacific (Bay of Panama) when I look south. This rainy season has been one of the wettest. So, whilst last year was very dry, this year we have had to deal with excess rain, and the effect it has on our small country. The lakes which feed the canal are at capacity.
Ehh, all they need is to start pumping water up, yes extra cost but one that users will need to accept.
So it works exactly like any other canal. Just on a larger scale
THE ANNOUNCER IS MECHANICAL ??
Thanks
As a guy who knows nothing about this, I have a sincere question: Why can't a pipeline[s] accomplish this with sea water? Why is fresh water necessary for this?
We got this.
Is climate change natural?
Passage cost is 500,000 to 1,000,000. A one way trip through the canal.
Now the canal uses some recycled water seen a video on the new construction that's been done.
That was the worst decision Carter made in office just give it two a country and the united state loss control. Panama is making lots of money enough to do construction on it to improve the canal .  It was a total investment of the united state to build.
There is an endless source of water at both ends of the Canal. It's time to start pumping water from these oceans into the canal. After all, they are currently dumping the discharge from the locks into the oceans, so no eco system would be damaged by circulating ocean water through the locks.
It sounds like you were using a damaged or refurbished microphone in this video.
Can’t Panama temporarily fix this issue by creating rain using cloud seeding? (similar to what we do in Australia or 50 other countries)
Why on earth did they build a highway instead of a railway?!?
Stupid idea idea to let a corrupt regime like the government of a third world country have control of such a valuable maritime resource that they didn't even build themselves.
WON'T   NEED  LITHIUM   SOON
Omg why not use the sea water,  who had the Idea of using Lake water? Especially when it's the country's water supply. Ships don't need fresh water.
Not only is the Panama Canal not the only lock system it’s also not the first. The lock system between Lake Superior and Lake Huron works the same way and it’s older.
So…. Maybe add water recovery pumps to the lock system. Were the water at the locks pumped upstream above each lock as part of lowering them instead of draining it downstream the water demand would be greatly reduced. It’s seems more like people don’t want to lose money investing in upgrades.
We should annex Panama.
This is why Trump and team want to take Panama Canal back. They want to increase the shipping through the canal. And they will choose to restrict the citizens water supply instead.
Why are you talking so fast ...stop it we are not Americans neither europians ..we are Asians ..that type of fast talking makes hard to process...🥲
Too much incorrect information
There is no climate global warming change that is a lie a scam your a useful idiot
Simple! Sell the canal back to the U.S. for, let's say, $100 billion, then, restrict the water from its lakes, except for substantial sums, let's say, $5 billion annually. Panama then should invest some of that money in the new canals being built, like in Mexico, in a new joint partnership. Let America have the Panama Canal, shit, maybe even rename it the America Canal,. Problem solved! 🤗
CORRECTION the USA never owned the Panamá Canal the USA stolen land of the Panamá Canal was a major problem from the beginning Panamá never gave or turned over sovereignty of the patch of land to the USA this is the reason why TORRIJO & CARTER treaty was done ratified once and for all who always was the owner of the Panamá Canal. The citizens of the USA has been lied to from the beginning to believe that the USA was the owner of the Panamá Canal. To take this a step further the reason the USA invasion of Panamá Republic Panamá was disarmed the Panamá elete Panamá forces so that Panamá couldn't defend itself from any threats this is one of the bullets points in the agreement that would give the USA the right for life to step in and defend the USA interests not Panamá these are the facts the invention had nothing to do with Manuel Noriega rant against the USA one more bit of information the CIA and the USA Special Forces was the ones who started all the shit in Panamá. I'm a US Army Veteran who served in Panamá Fort Clayton 193rd 4th Brigade the USA is a war criminal and loves invasion on countries that can't fight back karma always prevails in the end 🙏🏼 🙏🏼 🙏🏼
AMERICANS BUILT THE CANAL AND SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO PAY TO USE IT HOW STUPID CAN WE BE???
It is a question of effort and ability in maintaining the Panama Canal not global warming or should I say climate change to use a more ambiguous and less provable notion.  Did Jimmy Carter really believe that Panama was capable of parenting this extremely important man-made waterway.  I would say that he gave it very little concern and was far more concerned about looking like a great humanitarian.  I wish all nations or peoples were capable of building and maintaining grand creations like the canal, they are not.  Many people are only capable of destroying what others have created or at the most benefiting from what others have worked to make until there lack of effort or talent eventually destroys it along with everything else.
Take a shot every time “Panama Canal” is said
Why cant there be two ports on the both sides of Panama and a rail line connection ?
9:34 GREAT! Now clean up that garbage exposed from the drop of water level. And then Trump will delegate and FIX THIS MESS!
watching in 2025 and Trump wants to buy it back XXD
Irrespective of who's going to own it, the question comes as to how much you'd spend bringing it back up to its full capacity.  If Mexico is going to take half within a few years, and potentially Columbia joining, you could end up wasting many billions. And if they exist, you can't generate as much money from the Panama Canel due to the competition. It may end up that its primary purpose is to allow for the US Navy to travel from Atlantic to Pacific.   It's easy to understand the idea of the USA reclaiming ownership, because it's incredibly important to the country. But you just can't claim land anymore. That's not how a peaceful World works (the World has been at its most peaceful in human history, since the end of 1945). And you can see likewise with Greenland and Canada for their materials and Artic connections (the military defence argument is a stupid one, as the USA would spend that money regardless — as it literally has done). Otherwise, there's absolutely nothing wrong with Russia having invaded Ukraine, or China invading Taiwan. Or India. Or even Russia, to reclaim its land. If the US wants to be expansionist again, then China can follow, and that's how you increasingly risk a Third World War — with the First and Second down to territorial expansion, as well as the prior Napoleonic Wars, and the Seven Years War.   American hypocrisy has been laid completely bare to the World with Israel — fundamentally, a US colony in the Middle East, as the US provides its military power — with totally unbridled expansion into Palastine, Lebanon, and now Syria, at virtually any length. The only reason it hasn't yet sparked anything larger is because China and Russia don't care about that part of the Middle East. Human Rights mean no more to them than to the US. If the conflict spills into the Persian Gulf, for example, that's when it becomes more dangerous. I sincerely hope that the President-Elect's comments are indeed bravado to distract from the fact that his administration is very unlikely to fulfil any of the economic promises made.
What is stopping engineers from pumping water from the canal itself to the lock from either side? They don't have to get it from the lake... how do you think Socal gets it's water....
Hear me out what if we create a salt water reservoirs to use in the canals ? Never run out of water ?   Or what if with the development of more efficient propulsion systems and aircraft design we can build a freighter size aircraft that can just transport goods at the same cost as ocean freighter making them redundant?
It takes 6 minutes to get to the reasons.
Why TF are you screaming at me?!
Please slow down!  I enjoy your content, but my brain is going to explode.  You talk way  too fast.  Please breathe once in a while.
What if there was some kind of massive shipping "handoff" operation in Panama that could reduce pressure on the Canal. Basically - docks on either the western or eastern coasts where ships carrying "handoff cargo" meant for continuation through to a route on the other coast is delivered. A fleet of semis (or even by rail, if viable) keep going back East-to-West-to-East to move the hand off cargo across land to the other side to be picked up by a ship receiving the "handoff" cargo to continue on to the rest of its journey. If efficient enough, I feel like this could probably save a lot of time as opposed to shipping around the body of the continent - though that idea would do nothing for Naval re-deployment speed.  Alternatively, what if massive desalination pumps were used to convert some sea/ocean water directly into the canal itself to help take pressure off of the inland lake or potentially help replenish its levels?
So did anyone ever think. How many trucks would be going through that road for just 1 big cargo ship. It would essentially be bumber to bumber traffic for 3000km straight of just trucks.
Trump Daddy bouta take that shit back
This whole "climate is _suddenly_ changing" is a lie and a myth, stop pushing propaganda. Panama is just too lazy to figure out how to reuse the water, or, without the knowledge on how to do so in the first place because it was the US that built the damn thing (pun not intended).... Trump's in negotiations on having the US take back rightful control of the canal that _they_ built in which Panama has been monetarily been benefiting from massively, yet failing to both improve, and more importantly, keep safe from our adversaries. I'm sure Trump will allow them to keep a cut of their tolls.
The biggest reason that the Panama canal  is dying is never going to be big enough long enough. Most of the larger ships no longer fit.
Instead of building a wall along the Mexican border, USA should build a canal.
Fun Fact: The US government doesn't actually care about Taiwan, only the superconductor production there, and some other trades.  The US doesn't go to war for morals, human rights, or anything else they claim to the people they do, only oligarch/corporate interests.
US must take back the canal back.
Panama has proven themselves as incompetent to maintain the canal and they do so t the expense of their fresh water supply. Idiots!!!
They need a desalination plant to replenish the lake from the sea.
The new millenium began on January 1st, 2001. Why does everyone get this wrong?
I’m pretty sure the tonnage of a ship inside the lock doesn’t effect the amount of water it takes to fill the lock, only the size of the lock itself determines the water it takes to fill. This is the classic archimedes principle. If the canal authority is limiting the tonnage of individual ships passing, it’s not to save water, it must be due to other considerations. Reducing the total number of overall trips through the canal per day certainly makes sense from the water saving argument, but has nothing to do with the tonnage of individual ships
Make no mistake, the Panama canal is so important to America. That America will, without a doubt, go to war over it. America should have never given it over to panama. America just needs to go and take it!
why not just send ships from east Asia to the west coast and from Europe to the east coast of the Americas?? it seems like problems like this would be easily solved if we weren't trying to be so cute and were just being sensible! ship to the easier destination then send the rest to wherever by rail and truck it'd be a hell of a lot simpler than delaying shipping times!
4.5 million people sounds like a lot, but that's less than the city of Sydney, Australia. It's relatively tiny  as a country.
It never should have been given up by the USA
Frame. Rollers. Cables.
The solution is simple: 1. Deepen the upper canal, and 2. Make pumping stations that can pump water from the sea up to the upper canal.
How typical. America pays to build the Panama Canal. Pays to maintain it and then gives it back which in turn makes their country the richest in the area. Thank you president Carter and Clinton for what I’m sure had no money exchange on the personal level.
If Mexico is able to scale up their rail proposal, they could easily take over the bulk of cargo transfers from the PC, especially if the transit takes 1-2 days.
The US could have paid for 5 Nicaraguan Canals with all the money we have sent to Ukraine.
I believe there was also plan to make Costa Rica canal.. still on the table
Can they just use sea water for the canal instead?🤨
I'm only halfway through the video but why don't they use ocean water? Wouldn't that solve literally all their problems?
Somehow this video is both  quite educational and extremely boring at the same time. Think ima tap out about 1/3 way through.
Sounds like several different possibilities could fix it. New res to re use the freshwater, maybe use ocean water instead. (Yes this would mean using serious amount of pumps, building new reservoirs etc., but it wld be better than doing NOTHING).
I wish he would stop saying "Deering" in place or the word 'During'. (I know, but it still bothers me). 😖
Why do you always say stuff 2-3 times? Do you think we are so stupid that we forget you mentioned the Suez canal 2 times already so you have to reintroduce it at 15:46? You do this all the time...
Simple. Just pump tue water up to lock above instead of letting gravity take it down
With the water level so low, now is the time to get out there and get rid of all that garbage that lines the coast!  It is absolutely insane the amount of garbage that is in the water around Panama!
This entire video is click bait BS. Just more lies trying to make everything that Trump is planning to do is something bad. Don’t be fooled the panama canal is fine the only problem is we the USA are not getting paid nearly enough of the wages that we should be and Trump is finally going to demand those wages.
I don’t understand United stated 😢 let go Panama Canal
Why not recycle the water rather than dumped into oceans
The Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Spanish: Corredor Interoceánico del Istmo de Tehuantepec), abbreviated as CIIT, is
What about dredging the middle lake down to sea level.
Trump’ll fix it.
It's not for sale.
Can Canada not get from their west coast to east coast by going North of Canada?
Funny how world leaders got together saying that is bad, in that one spot! Didnt make us give up our other colonies. Just the ones that they are sick of paying for. Looks like we got half of what we deserved. But they still got to run off with decades of profit.
Another Member of the Democrat Dictatorship, Jimmy Carter !
The Panama Canal is filling with Cocaine.
The Panama canal is not dying,  its a big lier of this media.
👍😊
Who’s here because of trump lol?
Crazy stuff lets hope common sense will prevail BUT covid was released from a chinese lab killing 10's of millions without the world punishing them. Where was the common sense then?
Pump sea water problems solved
Climate change propaganda.
The U.S.  needs to take back the canal.
During the mid-1960s the U.S. was researching a plan to blast a sea level shipping canal across the isthmus of Nicaragua using dozens of thermonuclear explosives. One of the reasons that plan was abandoned was a study indicated much of the massive amount of radioactive fallout would likely impact surrounding residents.
So you are saying that 2023 was the first time El Nino has ever happened. This sounds like climate change alarmism
Climate change? LAst year they spend all year sending airplanes to silver chloride to destroy all the rainy cluids in the air. To make an stupid point about climate change when we know its a lie. Until this day, no one has ever answered why the reason of doing this bs. Why the need to destroy the rainy clud. Clinate change? I didn´t know climate change was about airplanes flying over with that component. And, there is no way that el niño last that long. Keep selling this stupid idea. No one is buying it, at least, not us.
As of December 23 the canal is fully functioning. The canal requires 2 lockfulls of water per single passage  this is a problem only through dry season. They fave built slide pounds on each lock which increases the passage time.
As
wow so great !!!!! nice
That is why US is eyeing Canada and Greenland.  Due to global warming, the NorthWest Passages now offers a safer and better route between Europe and Asia.
Pump the fresh back up
*WICKED MEN* will [advance] from bad to worse (2 Timothy 3: 13). When will society wake up and see that Jesus already spoke what would occur in the last days before the conclusion of this system of things? Time is almost up and everyone will be tested and They (Jehovah God and his Son Jesus) will be observing where our loyalty is... Standing firm with God's Kingdom or keep trusting human governments. If you die at Armageddon because you rejected God, you will not be resurrected or burned in a lake of fire, you will simply perish from existence as if you were never born. No one took note in Noah's days and continued with life as usual and all were swept away.
Mexico has plans to build one,so ha ha ha.
We build in another nation and they get the goods,not a good choice
What a train wreck
Climate Change? 😂🤣😂
What are the draft restrictions for? Shallower draft means more water is used to lift the boat. A rowboat uses the most water and the largest Neo-Panamax uses the least.
I agree, we should have had a second canal through Nicaragua, which would had made the Panama Canal situation less problematic as you have two canals that could be utilized to divide the amount of cargo going from one side to the other.   And if there needs to be a third canal, that Canal could cross Mexico.  By the way, I say we because unlike most Americans, Mexicans and Central Americans. We really should consider being one political entity, because it would benefit us far more than we would think. As for harm, if we do it right, there would be no actual harm. The only real concern is language. Under regional federalism, each region can operate as it needs to for its own people. So there is no issue for any Central American or Mexican person. In fact, Mexicans would be happier and Central Americans can feel more united without feeling too united.   The same is true for Americans. But no, we have tonto politics.  And language is easily resolved through bilingualism which is already being implemented, just not to the extent it needs.   So it is not an issue, not a real issue, it is a constructed issue. An issue derived from the minds of the people and their culture. Culture can easily be changed and accommodate such and so can the minds of the people. But stupidity is a whole different beast to it self.
Y don't thet use open water with that system filter that takes out the salt  or even better  tow some ice burgs up to that big lake on canal   sounds like  China an Panama government  trying to scam more money 💰 out of u.s.   we don't need the canal no more  or ships soon underground tunnels  with boring system  with mini high speed freight can transport  anywhere in u.s. an soon to europ an Asia. Remember the U.S. NEEDS NO 1 the world. Needs us
If everyone in panama would take just one cup of water to the panama canal that would fill the canal with water and have some left over to fill 250 olimpic size pools.
Trump will ignite the South Americans to fight among themselves for the N. American riches that come from its commercial and defence liners.
Trump will ignite the South Americans to fight among themselves for the N. American riches that come from its commercial and defence liners.
Why can't they just redirect the water they are dumping into the sea to some where they can reuse the water?
There is no climate change it's propaganda lies.
Trump will blow that thing wide open. Just watch
There were droughts in the Bible, so mankind experienced them thousands of years ago.  Did those people have SUVs?
The Panama canal means to be converted to a saltwater system
Watching this after your video about the Netherlands, can't help but thing they need to hire some Dutch engineers haha
"WHO BREW UP PANAMA CANAR???"
Hi what about  the Colombia canal
Panama is never be part of Panama it's always be part of USA go and read the treaty between them so stop running bullshit things
Take the canal back from Panama. It should never have been given to them, and Carter was an idiot. Rebuild it.   Make it wider for super tankers so big they'd have tectonic movement.
Build a 4 lock and collect the water from the first lock instead of flushing it to the ocean.
Build 3 magnetic tracks the width of the ships and trailers to put the ships on and move the ships from one ocean to the other without unloading them divide the distance in half. One half is up hill the other is down hill .?
With new TBM technology, they could now build a canal at sea level, all the way through.  Once operational it wouldn't cost any water to run.
Meters? Come on, dude. You’re American. Just use feet.
Panama should look into ways such as building a pipeline to reuse the fresh water from the Panama Canal especially when drought caused by La Nina weather patterns and climate change take hold of the amount of precipitation throughout Panama and thus the lower water levels in lakes that feed the Panama Canal with fresh water. This would also conserve the water supply needed for human consumption and uses.
Why can't they pump it into the lake instead of the ocean?
NO IT NOT DYING THIS IS A LIE
In history  climate change have been existing  before mankind existance.straight talk.Nature has its own path design by the designer.
Pump ocean water thru it
Why not use seawater??
Trump gonna take back the canal to oppose China expansion.
Horsefeathers. Academics and the political class get gold stars for stoking fear amongst the hoi polloi. Alarming climate models are a prime example of this. Something in our squirrel brain loves the end of the world. Meanwhile, very few people click on the thumbnail that says 'Everything's Just Fine.'
18 days? The fleet doesn’t move at the speed of container ships. Also, bombers would be doing non stop long haul flights bombing the piss out of everything. There’s more than naval bases in Guam and Okinawa. There’s California, Pearl, Washington off the top of my head. There’s troops in Korea, mainland Japan, the Philippines… Not to mention whatever group that’s probably already floating around in the Indian Ocean and Pacific already. Your whole assumption is that every ship is in port and reacting. And that said port gets completely destroyed. The Air Force and confiscated freight planes would move so much tonnage the Berlin air lift would look like child’s play. Anything coming from the east coast would merely be to shore up what was unfortunately hit, which I’d assume wouldn’t be much.
The new locks have overtaxed the water supply.  The original locks worked well for a long time.
For the Panama Canal water issue, why don't they just use desalination to replenish the water?
come on ! use only sea water !!!
It was NOIT climate change. The change is due to an underwater volcano explosion of unprecedented size. Stop with the climate change blame. Look it up.
Massive solar farms to provide power to pump sea water into the first locks on either side. repump the fresh water back up to the upper locks and lake . More dredging and excavation.
As always, government wasting resources. They could have pumped the water back up instead of dumping it in the ocean.
Why dont build train track from end to end panama canal?
Regardless of the controversial idea of climate change The facts of the matter is that the Panamanian trouts are affecting the corridor and alternatives, it must be considered. Change must come to this canal one way or another.
If the government just cloud seeds they can get all the rain they need and bring it back up to the operating level it needs to be at
I wonder why they don't use sea water for the locks themselves? Sure, it will require a lot of energy, but the solution is so obvious that I wonder what I'm missing?
Is this AI narration? Sounds like a real dude to me, but at 21:43± the word "soon" belongs AFTER the pause (comma), not BEFORE it.
Lake Gatun is an artificial man-made lake. If the people have become dependent upon it, that's too bad. It's more than they had to begin with before WE built it to be part of the canal. That was its original purpose! They got themselves into this mess. They need to limit their offspring to 1-1.5 children, or something.
This narrator is one of those fast talkers that so many people need to set their playback speed to 0.75x.
Use sea water both ways can resolve this issue
Wikipedia: <[Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index] ignores corruption cases that concern the business world. So, the collapse of Lehman Brothers (2008) or the manipulation of the money market reference rate (Libor) by major British banks revealed in 2011 did not affect the ratings of the United States or United Kingdom." The organization also receives funding from companies that are themselves convicted of corruption offences.[49] CPI's reliance on opinions of a relatively small group of experts and businesspeople, has been criticised by some. Alex Cobham, fellow at the Center for Global Development, states that it "embeds a powerful and misleading elite bias in popular perceptions of corruption".>
Why don't they just pump the water from lock one back up to lock 2?
couldnt you replace the fresh water with seawater somehow
if they just reused the same water from all three locks on each side then it would save all these issues?
Whoa, what an informative video! I’m sure I won’t find nazis and 10iq idiots in the comments se…….. yikes
Man made climate change is a scam. Only men changing climates work for government or multi national corporations
Never had an issue when britain ruled these points. Its what happens when we let barberians get some power
Dumb people big brains no sense i mean how did they build the canal like that in the first place i mean they had to damm up both sides right why didn't they dig out the dirt in the first place
Ok this is stupid if the canal is higher than sea level open both sides up blow up the dams blow iut the dirt and dig it out out what the hell
Can we get an update on this video? We had a ton of rain this rainy season and all the media outlets and Youtubers all quiet. It's all so tiresome.
Just get rid of the fresh water lake or make a new salt water canal that goes around the lake and does not require all these fancy locks.
That road through South America idea is so bad there will be constant pillaging by criminals.
They need to figure out how to recycle the same water they use so they aren't just "losing it."
Tell me this about climate change.. why are shoreline taken as photos 100 years apart show the sea levels at the same height? How come there's more ice on the caps now than ther was 20 years ago? How come the rich don't follow the same climate change rules they tell us to follow? Climate change is a scam. As a reminder we aren't supposed to have ice on our caps.. we are inside a ice age.... and inter glacial period.. and it's gonna get colder
Only the 2nd worse rainfall in 100 years before climate change really kicked off? Odd.
Stop Dunping The Extra Lock Water To The Ocean Put It Back Into The Canal ! 🤔🤔🤔
Sounds completely stupid. Why not use sea/saltwater? Should be possible...
They will find a way to pump and or reroute water to make it work.
It is amazing how much fresh water is used for the Panama Canal. Thank you for explaining this.
I’m sure there is a reason but why don’t “we” make a Panama Canal railroad?
Lay off of the coffee.
So rain is the most valuable resource in Panama
Climate change is natural. There is no crisis.  The climate crisis is media created paranoia
Close it up
Can't they pump the ocean water to raise levels? Is that not doable? Of course after making sure to isolate the fresh water source. Or build a roadway parallel to the canal
why not just build storage tanks big enough to hold a locks worth of water and recycle it back to the canal so it doesn't dump into the ocean and waste water
Several wrongs in this presentation. The British Empire didn't exist in the 16th century nor did the nation of Great Britain or the Union flag?  Drake was not a pirate and he did not 'bring slaves back to England'
Seems to me no matter what happens they're going to need to build a connecting canal between the two oceans without a locking system
I have  a solution but I want to get paid; I didn't get a dime when I told my detachable high-speed-chair-lift  idea to someone in 1980.
VERY TRASHY WATER SYSTEM.
ENLARGE AND EXPAND AND  DEEPEN AND STRAIGHTEN THE PANAMA CANAL.
Interestingly, no mention was made of the extensive rail network spanning the continental United States. It would certainly be a viable alternative for countries in the Northern Hemisphere. Of course, not everyone likes the U.S., and Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on many, if not all, imported goods would cause problems with many nations at just the wrong time.
Fuck ALL Wars.
Using fresh water to support this infrastructure is insane……..
More lore for our world!
The whole video i’m expecting the topic of why freshwater is used in the first place instead of seawater. It’s in infinite supply on both sides and several times more buoyant than freshwater requiring less volume. This seems like an obvious no brainer to me, so what am I missing?   Another question was why the canal was built to follow the terrain’s elevation changes rather than dug down to maintain sea level end to end and function more like a passage that fully connects the pacific and Atlantic oceans, eliminating any pumping/maintenance costs
But but climate change is a hoax....Ignorant Maga.
A carrier will still take that extra 18 days because US carriers can’t fit
This aged like whole milk.
So a boat that goes to the east side of South America will unload , the loads will be taken by trucks and taken to the west coast to an unloaded waiting ship ? That’s 2 boats each journey, timing would have to be good , I just don’t see it happening
with the bi-oceanic corridor, why not trains?
Nice video, but I don't understand why these smart people can't figure out how to recycle the fresh water from one end to the other. If they can't figure it out, Panama will some day be no more.
Just cloud seed for the rain then lol
Columbia already IS one of the world’s most prominent centers for economic trade, isn’t it?
Record keeping only began in the 1950’s?!?!  WTF?!?!
Isn’t the solution obvious?  Get rid of South America!!
in all the stupid reactions nobody  have any idea that it s all  be done on purpose you sheeple
brought and payed for by the NEW WORLD ORDER   climatchange is real just like corona   hiv   santa clause  and o je they realy landed on the moon yawn
So stupid question, why not build reservoirs by the gates and pump salt water into said reservoirs to supply water to the locks? Have them powered by solar which is plenty and given that they're oceanside, wind power to supplement the solar.
You can pay to jump the line.
How come they don't just pump the used water back into a reservoir?
Americans designed and  build the canal. Panama inherited it and it does not have the technological business know how to keep it going. i wish the video creator had addressed this angle.
Why is your audio so poor
Well 2024 was far different then 2023. The rainy season came three months early and it's still going strong. End of November and they have been receiving way more rain then they can handle. They are straight dumping water to prevent further landslides and major floods
Trucking freight across South America is never going to be competitive with floating it around the long way.   Unloading a modern container ship and driving them two to a driver across the Andes mountains would be environmentally and economically worse, and probably slower than shipping then around the long way.  There may be good reasons to build such roads, but bypassing the Panama Canal Isn’t one.  Trains are more efficient than roads, but still far worse than ships. Still, there may be excellent reasons to build out freight rail, but it won’t replace the canal.
I wish we could have an occasional drought in the U.K. it rains almost every day and we are having so many floods etc.
Thank goodness the droughts are incredibly rare in this case!
Yo, I love how this guy opens up by calling the Palestinian Genocide a “Maritime Disaster”.  As if the Houthies are just firing rockets 🚀 for no reason at ships
So I'm curious... early in the video the narrator stated that water left in a previously used lock after a ship passes through "must be released back into the ocean".   Why?   If they can pump water from one lock into another then why can't that water simply be pumped right back?   It's more expensive, sure, but i see zero reason for the release of that water immediately after a ship passes through.
Just stop dumping fresh water into the ocean? Save it and reuse it?
Jet traffic is increasing every day. Contrails rake moisture from the upper atmosphere and replace it to lower altitudes where it is often dispersed as fog or mist. The deposition of extreme heat from turbines into the stratosphere is also a recipe for climactic disorder. Jet exhaust runs at just under two thousand degrees C, and the stratosphere is between minus thirty degrees to minus fifty degrees C. It is impossible for this to not have dire consequences. Is your trip necessary? If not, use the internet instead. Get rid of three quarters of the jet traffic and the Panama Canal will go back to business as usual. Jet traffic is undoubtedly the primary driver of climate disruption.
Climate change? lol. 🤡
Re-engineering the locks to use sea water pumped in from ether side.
It’s like building an iPad in the jungle, and leaving to random people to maintain it. What did we expect giving it to them like we did lol.
Rip this guys mic jeez
If Panama cannot replenish their water fast enough, why not just build railway in parallel to the canal? or change up to 4th gate water to salt water, and build water separation gate after the 4th gate?
Why is the bi-oceanic corridor not planned to be rail transport? So much more efficient then trucks. More expensive, but worth it in the long run.
This is cool.
You lost me with your  harping on “climate change”.  Nonsense.
Sounds like we should just make more of our own food, clothes etc. locally like the old days. Most of the stuff that gets put on ships is crap low quality that we throw away too soon anyway. Let’s live with less to have more.
The houthi are weak compared to the USA
I found this totally confusing. If lock 1 is leveled with lock 2 by equalizing the water lever between the two, why is Lake Gatun even involved? Why is any water outside the system required? If outside water is needed for some reason, why depend on a freshwater lake instead of, you know, the seas?  Secondly, why are the artificially- created lakes 26 meters higher than the oceans, requiring the locks to compensate? Why not let Global Warming run its course, and ultimately open all the gates? If the terrain is higher than sea level  then why not dredge a working canal, rather than create this great mechanical marvel of engineering? Something's not being explained here.
26 meter difference don’t seem that much.
The issue is that the original design of Pan system  wasnt able to be followed thru with ie Sea Level as with the the Middle East Suez canal  because the Technology wasnt up to building that format  Canal .. Now the Ships are the size of small islands the canal take   Panimax but the  backup infrastructure wasnt upgraded to match the increased cycles of water or changed so that  the water wasnt waisted to loss with each ship passing thru ... the Canal other than evapouration ...
Well maybe instead of complaining you should start and do something about it! Climachange! And what about cleaning the saltwater and using it for the 2 central locks! Maybe you can just stopping from draining the lakes in the first place or use salt Walter that his back into the ocean.
Easy. Tell the Yanks they can only use essential services through. So the rest of us can use the service as intended.
The Bi-Oceanic Corridor could open up new trade opportunities for Paraguay, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, but if they think shippers are going to relish the idea of adding two more land-ocean transfers to their routes, they're dreaming. Staying on the water is far cheaper. It's only an alternative to the Panama Canal for the local imports and exports, which is still a big deal. The Mexican project seems like a white elephant in the making.
Silly question, but couldn't they change it around so instead of using lake water they use pumped-in sea water? I suppose that's complicated by the fact that the stretch between the lock sets is just the lake.
The idea of the PRC striking American bases at the get-go makes me chuckle, because that would guarantee US retaliation, and not just simple retaliation, but the start of a potential path leading towards eventual American occupation of a major Pacific Asian country, a movie we've seen before. Their only (relatively) sane play is to go straight for Taiwan and hope the US et al stay out, which is already a dubious prospect.
Play Panama- by Van Halen.  Then fire up the corruption.  Ok- quick … name one country not rife with corruption.
Why not istalling pumps at the watergates? Not throwing away the water into the ocean? Instead pumping it back to the higher reservoir? It only 26 Meters height at all.
Looks like the CIA will have something to do lol
You lost credibility in the first 4 minutes. If the Panama Canal is not an option, it would be faster to move ships from the east coast to Taiwan around Africa than to go around South America. Look at a globe, not a Mercator projection map.
They kinda did? So the og Panama Canal had an add on a few years ago with 2 new lanes for bigger ships that couldn’t fit in the og locks. Unfortunately it’s exasperated the problem
Reuse water?
Why not build a canal between Mexico and the US instead of a wall… I’m kind of joking.
You don't know that climate change will continue!!!!
Audio is so trash on this video
Why can't Panama pump ocean water to the locks instead?
This is probably the dumbest problem I've ever heard of. Instead of using freshwater they could use the salt water in the ocean on both sides. Because salt water is heavier than freshwater it will only mix a little bit into the lake. Then the locks will flush the salt water back into the sea. Sure it's going to add pumps to the system instead of using natural flow but the kind of money the Panama canal generates adding the pumps shouldn't be an issue.
Awesome. What has Panama done to improve anything?
It's so strange that they don't pump the water back to the top lock. I always assumed that was what they did, but I guess just dumping the freshwater into the ocean used to be substantially cheaper.
America better get first dibs to fill up those 18 spots 😂
I wish my entire monetary fortune ended up at $905,000,000. I mean, at least once.
We had to scrap an 8-month-old washing machine that we spent $1,100 for. Why? because it needed a new part that cost $49. However, due to trade embargoes and issues at the Panama Canal, we could not get the required part from China. Somehow, it wasn't even possible to have a copycat part made in South Korea, flown in. So we had to spend another $1,100 for a new machine.  This time, we made sure to get a machine (Maytag) that had parts made in Canada and Mexico to avoid any future issues.  You would be surprised, even with the internet, how difficult it is to find out where parts are made.  What a pain in the arse.🙄
Nice full-length documentary. RFE: Shave this down to cover *_"Panama Canal is Dying"._*
if it REALLY came down to it the US would take the canal back by any means necessary, that 18 day added route would never be seriously considered
They just need two modern (extra wide) canals, one for each direction. Quit playing around and get to the heart of the problem. We have the technology now days to do it without too many problems. It just takes money. All of the countries that want to use it must "buy into" the project.
He mentioned the cyclical weather event called El Niño as a factor affecting the canal, but what about how La Niña affects it? Aren't they the opposites of each other? Even if not, La Niña would still have some kind of effect on the canal.
Who is destroying  take a guess
Imagine a giant system that you can put next to the canal to supplement some or most of the water up the canal to fill the canal or putting up new and more😮 efficient gates to not lose so much water and repurpose the lost water instead of sumping it into the ocean
Why can’t they just build an artificial pool with sea water and recycle it for the boat lifting Chanel lock process? Can’t that water come from a recycled system?
So why not pump sea level reservoir back into the lake ??? Stupid flaw in the design.  Why does Mexico not build a competing canal? Better have income from honest digging in the ground than from drugs
Can they not save the water instead of dumping it back out into the ocean. Or use ocean water instead of river water?
Or can’t they pump the water back from the ocean into the canal? Does that make sense?
Can’t they build a lake next to the first point detect the water pump and put it back or put it in a tank and put it back
The United States of America built and paid for the Panama Canal we should’ve never gave it up. We should be making money off that along with Panama.
Dumbest thing ever. To use fresh water to move ships. Use new technologies and make salt water work. It’s abundant. It’s everywhere
Sad
The U.S. never should have given up control of the canal. Of course they screwed it up, they didn’t pay for it so why would they care to manage it properly.
Whu don't you have the AI  read the copy faster. I'll give you Thumbs-down.
🤦🏻‍♂️
you do know el nino has has nothing to do with global warming!  it has to do with lava flow below the earths crust.
The good news is we elected Donald Trump so climate change doesn't exist anymore. Problem solved! 🙄
18:19 A road system for trucks across South America doesn't seem to make much sense since ships from Asia with cargo destined for the east coast of South America can sail around the tip without much added time or expense. And in North America we already have a road system from coast to coast.  23:18 trucking is expensive. It takes hundreds of trucks to transport the goods from one cargo ship. Can't imagine it's not cheaper just to sail around. And as for using a road across South America to transport goods to the east coast of North America, why wouldn't you just truck them across the United States from Los Angeles or Seattle or something? That makes no sense.
15:43   heard about it just about 15 minutes ago at the start of this video
Why not just store the water?
Why are we acting like this is complicated; add a pump & pipeline between one and three?
Desal is an obvious solution. Another is a subsurface bladder where you can fill and empty from adjacent sources (tanks, lake, groundwater, etc).
America builds it maintains it for a hundred years, hands it over to the local people and they jack it up. Chef kiss
Solution: Use the Boring Company to reroute seawater rather than fresh water for canal use. Also, start building desalination plants on those coast for population use!
Make a secondary reservoir to pump water into instead of the ocean making it more reusable.
Ha Ha! Big joke! Water no problem as there is plenty just needs to be routed. Or! Or simple pump sea water complimenting fresh water. Oh my! Where would that water come from? How about from the Pacific on the west and Gulf on the east? Oh never thought of that. But what if that doesn't work? Build loading and unloading ports and run trains west and East. OH! So why was this video even made? Beats me?
Hopefully this works out.
So to save the Panama Canal, we should all stop driving cars and die, got it thank you.
intro too long..  never got to the point
Poor quality audio and unnaturally too fast talking.. Quited after a minute.
Can’t they divert the fresh water lost into the into the lakes through pumps and create a power source out if it
Me thinks you are making a problem where there is a solution!
What happened with your voice?
Glad it’s November of 2024 😂
It seems to me that the simplest solution for the Panama canal is to recycle the water that they are dumping into the oceans. All you would need to do is add enormous pumps, and holding reservoirs or tanks (or pump it back to the lake) with no other changes to the canal apparatus. The engineering issue that needs to be solved is the wastage of the lake water. Not climate change. In fact, in a closed system with it's own reservoir (not the lake that people drink from), they would just keep using the same water over and over.
The HKND proposal is probably the worst option Nicaragua. Because china would make an absolutely terrible cannal. And the chinese economy going through the downfall its in now.
It also doesnt help that panama has been using the infrastructure without constant repairs. Taking the money and allocating it elsewhere. Theres also a dam project for 1 or 2 more rivers but overall it might not lead to the resolution they needed. Bribes to officials have been issues to skip lines have been an issue too.
Dig a deeper ditch. 😂
Shame, Yemen could have been rich .
From a thousand ships 1914 to 15 00 a day 2023. A population increase from 860 000 in 1950 to 4.3 million today. Might also be a factor. But no the weather is the only factor. Stop the loaded agenda content it is getting really really old. We have fucking windmills in norway for gos sake. A self supplied country woth hydro electric power we are now forced to sell to the silly germans because of climat radicals bying russian gas and hating on nuclear power.
Why don’t they recycle the water between the locks?
(Expensive) Solution: When lowering ships, water pumped out of that lock should go back up, pumped uphill. 🤷‍♂️
Can they use salt water?
Can they not run a new pipe to each lock and resumption the water back into the reservoir side ?
The panama canal is far from being the most important in the world. At maximum its important to the US. And the US thinks, if it is important to them, it is important to everyone... No wondern most of europe doesnt like the US
they could build water tanks and re use the water
😮This explains, at least partly, the inflation that affects the global economy, yet each country propagates it is a political issue; with both canals affected, no wonder. You rarely hear of the cost increases at these choke points- as explanation for inflation.
Maybe the action to prevent climate change is actually changing the climate in a negative manner preventing the rain from falling.   Do-gooders deeds gone bad?
Just like submarines use a distillation apparatus to turn seawater into fresh water why doesn't Panama use this solution for th Panama canal?
A canal that American citizens paid and built and we gave it to Panama completely paid for and yet they can’t manage it or upgrade it without help?
Corrupt country
I’ve been through that canal many time in the navy
America made this before there were industrial size equipment. Panama can’t even maintain it.
Sorry if this is dumb but if the locks are going up and down, why don’t they dredge out the lake and then do away with it and the locks?
The pox on jimmy Carter
The real problem here can be blamed on the idiots who voted for Jimmy Carter who gave the canal to the corrupt government of Panama.
Thanks!
It'd take longer but what choice is there.
Recycle the water.
There is that climate change insinuation again or as what we called weather when I was a child.
Not close to dying
The US needs it so that it can invade, interfere with, and bully countries around the world.💩🇺🇸💩
Why can the first lock not use ocean water, pumped in, to flood the first lock, then drained back to the ocean? Yes, I understand the ecological issue of salt and fresh water! If it is pumped into the first lock then drained back to the ocean, there will be minimal saltwater transfered to the freshwater. But over time it would increase the salt transfer eventually. At that slow of rate, or with chemists and environmentalist help, that whole process could be eliminated!  Or make the canal saltwater, from end to end, with VERY MINIMAL bleed to the surrounding ecology 🙄 It's 2024 not 1904!! We HAVE the "technology" to make this not an issue 😡
Lack of water
The FIRST DAY of the "new millennium" was January 1, 2001 - NOT 2000. A millennium, like a century or a decade, ends in a year ending with a ZERO.
It's kind of funny how he's sort of talking about El nino like it's an abnormal event even though it's been going on for a really really long time and that regular intervals.
Remember people. Those are Muslims bombing trade ships. The supposed religion of peace. Then you get mad at Israel for handling them
If this is going to cost so much to the shipping companies....then why not put a levy on the transit fee....and use it to build a desalination plant at the coastal ends of the canal. This could pump water from the sea back up to where it is needed. In a time when climate change fearmongers predict sea levels rising....i would think more desalination plants would be ideal in areas with freshwater drought. Maybe some of the Billions paid to fund the UN and its very well looked after staff....could go towards costs.
According to United Nations the earth will not exist in 12 years. How powerful men believe they are, yet the same old problems exist. One billion people go hungry everyday, medical help is non existence for million, governments corrupt, the united nation is a weak vessel that hasn't united anything.
when we do not burn fossil fuels and coal forest fires and other wild fires take over and provide the necessary carbon gasses necessary for life but liberals hope is to eliminate all life under the lie of protecting life,
2;30 the new millennium started January 1, 2001 ;)
Ships are getting bigger and cannot fit the canal
Climate change is another liberal fantasy like transgender
In 67, 68, and 69 the I was on the USS Boston and we’re transitioned the canal both ways.  The US hired many Panamanian to maintain the entire canal.  I went thru the canal three years ago on a cruise ship and the canal is in terrible shape with rust and lack of painting.  When jimmy peanuts gave the canal to Panama this is not surprising due to the lack of maintenance.
The water level is back up as of this month from what I read.
Why can’t they use sea water for lock/ gate process? ?
If it’s any consolation so is the Pedocrat asshole that gave it away! 🖕🫵🌈💩☠️
Can't they get rid of the locks? Wont the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean be level
Ok, Van Halens song Panama is about a race car called the Panama Express Eddie Van Halen wrote the song after being accused of only writing songs about gals - pretty sure that was a coincidence and the song really is about fhe fine women of Panama, where the next Miss Universe will be coming from
Panamanian music scene is off the chain, especially the Reggaespanol and hip hop reggae - in those two categories they compete heavy w Jamaica - not to mention soundclashes - one of the tightest Soundsystem is Van Halen Sound Int'L - on the real hough I have never thought of what the meaning of the song Panama - ? - my guess is its talking about where the cutest girls are from but I should see what other ppl say - I thought about the gyal dem bc thats what most of Dan Halens musics about
It works like just about every canal, EVER! Without locks it would be called a river! 😂😂😂
Instead of looking to ways to either add a new source of water or more quickly replenish the current sources they should be looking into ways of recycling the water. In essence reuse the same water over and over as much as possible. Yes I understand if they just keep pumping the same water back and forth between the lochs the lake would get contaminated with salt water but there's got to be a way around that
The rail is just one of three viable options to connect the Atlantic ocean with the pacific. The others, one connects two rivers and the other is a mix of rail and road... The U.S. opposes any attempts to build canals anywhere that may affect the Panama canal traffic... including channels at least three other project proposals in Mexico and Central America.
I’m not blaming the people, but have the homes in Panama got rainwater collection for flushing/showering? The water still ends up where it was going, (back into the water cycle), but it bypasses the lake as a source. I know they can’t do it overnight, but it seems like an investment worth looking into.
The United States owned and operated the panama canal for a long time until 1999, 25 yeas later after we stop constant dredging, its got problems. imagine that.
can they not pump water from the sea instead of using the dam?
Thank you Jimmy Carter for giving away a vital asset.!!
3:23 im glad you didnt show alaska as a part of the US, because contrary to popular belive, liechenstein is the owner of that state.
He says America as it was a country lol gringos cant be that illiterate, c'mon
just add a fourth reservoir that stores the excess water from the first lock instead of emptying it to the ocean. Problem solved.
Wouldn't a desalination plant to offset fresh water loss not be a idea. Run it straight into the canal and pump out into the reservoirs. Or have I oversimplified it
Shame Switzerland didn't have colonies in Latin America they would of smoked the problem with the power of rail.
The Mexican-railroad part you came to see is way down at 29:46.
10:00 climate change 😂😂. Ok fake news & propaganda worshiper thumbs down and never watching your channel again 👎
They should just re-dredge widen and expand the current canal.
Okay Mr propaganda here it is you pump water from each one how about pumping number one to number 3 and that solves your problems morons. But I guess pumping water is in any good right
Why can they not pump seawater in the first 2 locks to raise the vessels then use freshwater from the lake in the last lock so as to evade any destruction of freshwater wildlife then use that water to lower the level for ships going the other way, then do the same on the other side, freshwater for first lock from the lake, then pump the rest from the sea. It would cut freshwater use by a 1/3rd though more expensive in power for the pumps.
Why don't they simply change the Panama canal system to instead pump sea water from the other side of the lock, to this side of the lock, to lift the ship? Unless I am missing something, that would be a similar distance and pressure to pump the water, irrespective if it is fresh water from a tank, or sea water from accross the same lock.      Even if that would require a significant change to the system, it should still be much cheaper and easier to do than shutting down part of the shipping volumes or closing the canal.
According to the Panama Canal Authority, water levels are returning to normal as of August 2024, and they are increasing the number of ships passing daily.  So it was weather and not climate.
Should have used the season water!!
Another clickbait video. If that event is every 2 to 7 years and is well known how is it now *dying* and not many times before ?😂  Country goes without rain for a week new video comes out why this country is dying😂😂😂
Time to pump water?        Joe
One point not brought up: The original locks work and waste water as demonstrated in the video. The new, larger locks use adjacent holding tanks and pump water in and out of the new locks in order not to lose it to the sea. If worse comes to worse, the new locks can still be used for transit even is the old locks are idled. Unless the Panamanians drink all the water. Pray for rain.
The reason is simple, it will cost money in to put pumps in. Nobody wants to spend the money, only take it.
PUMP THE WATER FROM THE OCEAN!  Or pump the fresh water back up unto the upper lock…A first year engineering student could solve this in 2 years…I swear children are running the canal!
So America has all the bombs it needs to protect shipping from the Houthi’s but not to protect our Democratic ally that has been getting bombed with over 8000 missiles in the last year into northern Israel without provocation….priorities of this admin are pathetic
oh ur a zionist
I don’t like Jimmy Carter!
The same people who keep blabbing about climate change are the same ones who keep manipulating waterways and introducing and protecting invasive species causing untold grandfather. Regardless of what temperature the Earth is we need clean water
Is there no way to utilize sea water instead of fresh water? I assume the whole system must be gravity fed instead of using pumps, because if it was pumps they could pump in sea water for the locks.
Why do they not try to pump the water back up instead of flooding it into the oceans?
Why not recapture the water used?
Southern Cone will not work in Latin America, why? La Mordida,  Churisoss. Every customs officer is going to get his from every truck.
A natural passage would be thru Nicaragua. PROBLEM, Costa Rica owns the Southern shore of the river. Nicaragua has its eye on an invasion into CR and taking this area.
Why use this stupid fake  AI voice?  Really offensive.
Is it possible to pump seawater into the upper locks?
We all know that trucks that stand too high from the roadway won't pass under some viaducts.  There just isn't enough clearance.  Truck and trailer manufacturers take this into consideration when designing their equipment.  Ship builders have foolishly ignored the limitations of a canal that shipping companies depend on for profitable operation of their businesses.  How they thought this would work is beyond me.  No one seems to have done his homework on this.  We'll just have to downsize our container ships.  Can you imagine the shipping companies scrapping all those gargantuan ships? On the other hand the chipping companies can reroute their vessel through the Northwest Passage that may soon be viable.  Just watch out for traffic jams north of Alaska.
WHY.....WHYYYYYY haven't they just built pumps on the lowest locks that can pump the fresh water back into the lake to lower sea access opening???.... Then they can use gravity to refill the other locks. TAAADDAAA no more water loss......
I'm definitely no engineer, but my question to one ir someone with knowledge is. Why can't they just reuse the same water.? Why does it end in water getting sent into the ocean?
Panama should invest in the Mexico solution...  They have the money...  There will always be goods that people don't want you to handle more than once  And that's the traffic the Panama canal can host...  All the other goods can travel by rail from one Coast to the other...  But it would be stupid to try to do this with   Out multiple tracks going from the east coast to the West and multiple tracks going from the west coast to the east... Keep them far enough apart so a derailment   will not block the other set of tracks...  Don't buy cheap equipment  make sure your switches work all the time with regular maintenance and inspection...  The penalty for those two not doing their jobs should be at least 5 years in jail... Yes you're going to get paid well so you should take the responsibility...  And they knew this should have been done 20 years ago.,. But nobody wants to listen to scientists... When what they say is not a profitable for the powers that be...
Panama’s government have been getting tens of billions yearly, for something they never paid for, yet over the course of 110 years they make no attempt to modernise the canal or its populations water availability. Where have all of the billions people paid to use the canal gone?
Why not just pump water from the ocean back into the lake?
Here's my real question, if anyone knows the answer: Why can't Panama build pipelines from the ocean to pump seawater up to the two locks closest to Lake Gatun? Surely that water wouldn't affect the potability of the lake water if they put it in the first lock on either side rather than the lake. I was surprised not to see this idea even mentioned. Can anyone explain what's stopping them from doing that?
Just some shop talk: I appreciate that you put the sponsorship at the end. I think this makes it more effective - your whole video gets watched without losing as many viewers, and we're left with the sponsorship in mind at the end. It looks like a good service too. Nice production!
Climate change is “getting worse???” True except for the fact that it isn’t any “worse” than ever. Because climate change isn’t good or bad, it’s just reality. The climate has never not changed! And the changes can never be predicted with any reliability. And any change that is negative for one area will be positive for another area.  They will spend billions on a project to make the canal more efficient with less water and before they are finished it will start raining again and the lakes will refill and this temporary problem will be replaced by another temporary problem.
Why are subtitles not working specifically on this video?
Here's one for you to ponder on for a moment Owen. This definition is found in Blacks Law Dictionary 6th Edition (available for free as a PDF on internet archive).  FREE WHITE PERSONS    "Free white persons" referred to in Naturalization Act, as amended by Act July 14, 1870, has meaning naturally given t& it when first used in 1 Stat. 103, c. 3, meaning all persons belonging to the European races then commonly counted as white, and their descendants, including such descendants in other countries to which they have emigrated.    It includes all European Jews, more or less intermixed with peoples of Celtic, Scandinavian, Teutonic, Iberian, Latin, Greek, and Slavic descent. It includes Magyars, Lapps, and Finns, and the Basques and Albanians. It includes the mixed Latin, Celtic-Iberian, and Moorish inhabitants of Spain and Portugal, the mixed Greek, Latin, Phoenician, and North African inhabitants of Sicily, and the mixed Slav and Tarter inhabitants of South Russia.    It does not mean Caucasian race, Aryan race, or Indo-European races, nor the mixed Indo-European, Dravidian, Semitic and Mongolian peoples who inhabit Persia.     A Syrian of Asiatic birth and descent will not be entitled to become a naturalized citizen of the United States as being a free white person.     Nor a native-born Filipino.    Nor a native of India who belonged to Hindu race.
If you can take saltwater and zap it with electricity to covert the saltwater atom into chlorine and can change seawater into drinkable fresh  water. If you have seawater on either side, the problem of not having freshwater is moot. Add a tidal generator, solar panels and wind power and you can power the pumps to convert the seawater into fresh drinking water.
Why it use fresh water when salt water is less dense mean it float more other than fresh water and salt water is all around the world?
Stop cutting forests in the Amazon, climate will return to normal to a large extent
NO mention of the expansion new locks that opened June 2016 that use much more water
Why not just dig and make the panama canal smooth so you dont have to elevate and delevate the ships?
Would it be possible to pump the water from the lowest back part back to the lake. Of cost of the construcktion will be high but even if panama cant finance it, the high intrest of the US could help with that. Or what problems would that bring with it
Every time I see the design for the Panama canal I always wonder why didn't they just go a little further north and just dig a canal at sea level Don't get me wrong I understand money and time and labor that would need to go into that but at the end of the day still charging a toll to go through it they should be able to make their money back and all the rest of it was not a waste
The lower the lake the less water it takes to raise and lower ships. And the better off you are the lower you lower l The lake. I say dredge baby dredge!
Water is not "pumped" into locks.  Gravity moves the water all by itself, Dummie!
Make it work with salt water.....problem solved!
putting a cannal through a lake is dumb, its understandable 100-200 years ago as they all had low IQ but doing it now is braindead, why use locks which need maintenance when you can just dig a channel at sea level meaning you dont have to destroy a lake and maintenance costs are far less
cloud seeding works
My mama always said: life's like a box of chocolate you never know what you gonna get.
Terrible audio
Just pipe/suck/pump  the needed water out of the oceans.
really tried watching this cause of the interesting info. please rethink how you’re processing your audio! the near constant peaking and distortion is so grating, it’s torturous.
I've been through many locks in my life, absolutely none of them are connected the a lake. How does Panama Canal run out of water surrounded by oceans? Pump water in from the ocean pump out the same way? How is that complicated?  If it's a materials issue, gotta be easier to solve that then build a huge lake.
Panama needs this revenue, these funds are important to their country. So what they need to do is all rivers and streams should be redirect to the lakes feeding the water to The Panama Canal. 😮😊
Who the hell would send their ships through drug cartel- infested, Mexican waters? You'd have to be a damn fool. That's why Panama will continue to be the shortcut
Is anyone else thinking they should update the canal to have two or more so nobody else can just build another like china because nothing is forever you need to stay on top of things
Amazing the things people with ZERO knowledge of the Panama Canal will post.  The Canal is far from dying, in fact recently they've set transit records again.  For those that are not familiar with the area.  (I grew up there, i'm very familiar with it) from Dec-May is dry season, water levels drop, and transits are restricted.  This happens every year and every year somebody posts junk like this video hinting at the Canal's demise.  Please stop with the fake narratives for clicks.
Your reading bot seems to be on steroids. How about slowing it a bit?
❤
No facts about the monster amount of water now used by the large cities that takes away from the canal. ..lol Now it's covers the problem and there's the real problem not climate change scam. But that's just my opinion of the problem of city vs canal not climate change scam the money making propaganda.,
And the other 93.5% comes from Illegal aliens in the U.S.A sending all their money back to Panama.  😂😂
United Nations • Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. It is NOT a proven fact that human activities have been the main driver of climate change. FACT CHECK
Why not use Ocean water instead? It's free and reusable
Or we can stop buying shit we don’t need!
Read more  about that. Your interest is to make you money but will not work with misinformation  Everything is back to normal and billions are to be invested in a short period of time to bring more water from other rivers to the new build lakes. That's among other giant projects all being studied right now.   Panamá has never given up to the world changes.
Sounds like a horrible design
A slight problem with all the road and rail proposals - the cost of unloading shipping on one side and loading shipping on the other coast.  There are several sinkholes - 1.  It will take enormous amounts of land to store all the containers, some loaded, others empty. 2.  There will be a large demand for prime wharfage adjacent to the container storage. 3.  There will be a huge demand for security for the full space occupied by the transshipment business. The full containers in the yards will be tempting, as will the ones on trucks and trains traveling from coast to coast.  All of the above will be expensive to solve. Whether there will be sufficient savings to justify the expense has not been determined to my knowledge.
Satan has a limited number of ruling years to rule this earth, and then God's returning will be the solution.
There have to be additional options, albeit expensive. Example: Raise rates and build additional reservoirs at each end. Then pump fresh water to/from recycling reservoirs instead of just emptying it into the ocean.
So a couple of solutions that may or may not be feasible, I don't know I'm not an engineer. But why not pump from the ocean, I know that the lake is freshwater but why wasn't it a salt lake in the first place? They could also use mechanical covers to cover the leveled gates that aren't being used during the rising process to reduce on evaporation. And if they got REALLY desperate, they could, technically but not really feasible either, mine out the entirety of the passage to sea level, changing it from a canal to a man-made ocean straight.
1:32 you mean the "Mar de Hoces” 😑
Climate change is real, that summer autumn, winter and spring, there is the change... too little its the Climate, too mich its the Climate.  Its a planet, it changes, continents are moving, but if an island is flooding blame Climate change.
Why can’t they use salt water from the sea?
Apologies if this is a dumb question... Why wouldn't they invest in a water recycling plant for the used canal water?
Why are they not installing high capacity water pumps to push the water, from the bottom lock, back into the lake, instead of letting it flow into the ocean?   Los Angeles has to do this with all water from the Colorado River.  They already pump the water from the higher locks down to the lower locks.  I know it will cost money, but it is going to cost less the. Losing the entire turn canal.  It also should be minimally disruptive.  Until the actual cut into ghe lowest lock to install the piping, everything will be next to the lock, nit inside of it.
I feel like the time of going through Drake's passage is the least of anybody's worries. The videos of those ocean waters is absolutely terrifying
The ways you pronounce Chile and Paraguay are WEIRD!  :P
Couldn't Panama open a desalination plant or 2
You need to EQ that mic differently, its currently very fatiguing on the ears and I only ever make it through half way of an episode.
Why don’t they change how they use water? If you have to flood the lower locks, why not pump that water up and just cycle it back through the lock system? If you worry about increasing lake salinity, create a canal water storage lake. The US could rebuild or refurbish rail lines so goods from the east coast could be transported by rail to the west coast then shipped to Asia. Goods then can be shipped from Asia to the west coast then on to the east coast. If we did this, it wouldn’t take long for people to be able to travel by rail across the USA instead of flying as the rail system would grow and fares become cheaper due to availability. To ship goods by rail is cheaper than using trucks and you need fewer people to transport the same amount of goods. Trucks would then just need to transport containers to areas with in a half day’s journey and be home with family in the evening.
Juz, they are dumb! Stop throughing away fresh water into the ocean & tax the users & climate change denyers that cause massive greenhouse emissions to pay to have the Panama Canal upgraded to stop the rediculous waste of fresh water. Not so complicated is it?
You mean to tell me that you still are not aware that the Cuban Missle Crisis was instantly resolved as soon as the US provication of putting missles in Turkey were agreed to withdraw? Thats right, the US provoked The USSR into defending itself. Just one of far too many BS cover-ups. Wherever military contractors, greedy republicans, or anyone with substancial wealth stands to profit, people die! That's  the real truth! Who stands to make the most money & power in the upcoming  election? 2+2 my uninformed friends.
5:02
The death of the canal started when the Panamanians took over it 😂
The Cape of good hope in 2024? You either have to be racist or ignorant.
16:57 looking at the map... sailing straight from Westcoast USA to Japan is no problem... that is a massive piece of ocean to travel..but we huamns are great, we are capable, right??  Then why not sail in a straight line from Cape Horn to Cape of Good Hope? Less then half the distance mantioned prior... THAT would save money... Bunk refuel and sail straight to Austyralia in the same line..  OR IN USA Use Dutch invented Coasters.. Sea going ships that can also navigate shallow depth estuaries, rivers and canals...can sail from  East to West on the canals and rivers..and cross the Atlantic to Europe... BODEWES, FERUS SMIT, SaS Groningen are specialised in making these ships.. selling them in Singapore, Taiwan, Ireland, UK, Germany Yes, not as big as the containerships, carrying 1000, but carrying 30 or carry it as bulk, without the containers..that add extra weight.. over 100 metres long, still managable from the bridge
16:35 Well look at Google Earth.. THERE IS NO NORTHPOLE ANYMORE...O_o...... Go North Route!!
15:57 the two most " advanced " militairy powers ..as they say, in the world, and after years.. it is 2024 now!!!! Cant secure a passageway for ships??  Are they that advanced, or is it just a show, and this is all planned to go from here to worse...  The latter is the most plausible...
Why not build pump plants and use ocean water to fill the locks. Unless the canal is fresh, then just fill first and second lock with ocean and third with fresh.
Don't invent false news about Panama Canal,the Canal Panama Don't have any problems.
Why can't they just connect the gatun lake to the sea? Environmental concerns?
not a bad video but why a good channel need to make click bait title
PLEASE GET MARK OVER 2 MILLION! PASS THE WORD
Lmao “climate change” **less than a century of data** embarrassing propaganda that deserves the Wikipedia false information embed from YouTube.
Nuclear power plants + Dedicated desalination plants for the canal seems like a pretty good idea but I could be wrong
Please invest in a microphone. Sounds like you are using Apple earbuds. Otherwise great video
This is a climate change channel.
Question.  How much has the boat traffic increased? Did the widening of the canal increase how much water is needed for the locks?
My suggestion  is: flood the smaller lake with sea water . Stop using the bigger lake ! Everyone keeps saying  the oceans are rising ! Charge Panama interest on the loan money for the project  , default  the loan and u.s. has control  of the canal again! 😊
He sounds like a fruitcake- can't listen more
BYOW
Build a  desalination water plant so u can pump water back into the lake.
Can the water be pumped back into the lake instead dumping into the ocean
Better build a desalina5ion plant to fill lake😅simple,or pipeline from last lock back to Lake ,common-sense, I'm a genius
They need to build pumps  to pump seawater  to first  2 locks only  use lake water last lock
Pure rubbish
Why is this not being reported as the cause of inflation
Oh, I can answer the headline question in two words: Jimmy Carter.
Someone educate me.  1. Why not recycle water at the end of the cycle back from chamber 1 to chamber 3, just before the lake Gatun to avoid contamination? 2. Why does the Panama canal have to use fresh water while the ships themselves came sailing in salty water?
Let me guess: Desalination.
El Nino is inarguably NOT climate change related. Rainfall has remained steady in the region for the last few decades and this drought is nowhere near the drought of the 1960s, a cool period. Rainfall has not reached record lows and, while low, still exist in the range of natural variability. I feel like this whole video was latching on to the (erroneous) media panic that circulated a little while ago.
The creation of such a highway (Bi-Oceanic corridor road) will be a game changer for people of much of South American.
Should consider using pumps and use salt water you got two  oceans full of water
Anyone think about a pipe libe from lower lick back up to lake??? Recycle the water instead of flushing it out to sea
uh...  why werent the water supply lines for the first 2 and the last 2 locks. made to draw water from their respective oceans, on either end of the canal?         which would then leave only the 3rd or middle lock only using fresh water from the resovoir.     another observation. while watching that boggles my mind.     wouldnt it be easier for us in the US.  to change the locations to best match where were shipping the stuff to and receiving things from.?     so instead of everything being a send it out where ever.    if something coming from europe or africa lets say,   have all those items sent to ports etc along the gulf of mexico and atlantic coast line.  and then all the stuff going to or coming from asia, russia, austrailia. etc.  be sent and recieved on the west coast.?   it would  solve many problems, and id think would be overall way more financially viable than creating a or multiple new canals.  etc.
1 or 2 years of flood or drought, and bingo! Global warming, Climate change???🥵🥶   😏🤝😉💲💲💲
Try, Hoot- hees. Not hooth- ees
The US should cut through from the gulf to the Pacific and the fees would pay for it
If i'm not mistaken all our new super carriers both the Nimitz classes and the new Gerald R. Fords are all too large to go through the canal and have to travel to the Pacific via the Straights of Megellen at bottom of South America and i imagine taking all their escorts with her as well which really negates the naval importance that the canal previously represented.
Solution: Dig the Panama Canal effectively 26+ meters/85 feet+ deeper where needed along its entire path effectively making it a waterway while draining/controlling Lake Gatun water levels as needed.
It is noteworthy that this happens after the expansion of the canal by the incompetent Chinese engineers because Panama would not give the contract to a US company no matter what.
Easy: buy Borsec bottled mineral water from Romania, both for the canal and for the population. You`re welcome!
If there was a war with China, China might destroy the Canal rendering ituseless.
Not to sound super super super dumb, but why not direct connect both oceans through either a giant tunnel or an actual depth channel.
Sea levels are rising greatly re global warming but pana canal is getting shallower.      How is it possible
can’t they siphon the water back into the lake after the displacement process?  edit: ehh will prolly get salt water into fresh water then, but something of the sort.
Maybe this is addressed later in the video but can someone explain to me why can't sea water be used to raise and lower the ships? I'm sure someone must have thought of a mechanism to do that right?
He needs a better mic so badly
Prep time Batman wins no doubt
Traveling through the Canal is like watching the Aral Seadry up….
The only ture way to stop so called climate change is population control....and we all know it's ture but no one is willing to admit it
Climate change.....or it's just the natural change of the Climate...like it as always done
One thing with would help is to bring all all are troops home and worry about ourselves and not every other country that isn't us
The closed captions for this video suck! When it said the "canal makes roughly 6&1/2% of panamas GDP" the closed captions instead said 65%! CC repeated the same mistake, this time instead of 6&1/2 it wrote 62%!
Use a quad pump and use sea water not fresh water. Save the fresh water for the people
I can see truck pirates in the future throughout the whole bi-oceanic corridor 😅
I wonder if they’re could be a way to siphon the water used in the first gate back up to the 2nd and third, granted there’s gonna be more cost to pump water up hill but if there’s a closed system separate from each set of locks made to cycle the water between the 3 locks on both sides I wonder  if that would or could be enough to keep it going
Desalinise the sea water and replenish the lake, the technology is very old and used a lot in the east!
Why don't they just build a pipe and pump system to capture the water and pump it back into the lake instead of the ocean? I have no doubt that it would be expensive due to the amount of water it would be dealing with, but it seems like it would easily pay for itself in short order.
Tawanna is part of China why would it attack it's self
6:58 no it does not need to be emptied into the ocean, they can install pumps and pump at least a part of it back up ... yes it requires investment and energy and probably a nuclear plant to power it but out of the yearly billions this is doable.
How much fuel consumption do these ships use by going around South America compared to just waiting at the canal?
Or, you could just build new pump works to pump the water from the locks back into the lakes...
Very vew ships use the Drake passage. Most go through the Magellan strait, which goes through an area of fjords and is deep enough to allow even larger ships to go through.
This is a problem that can be fixed with more electricity to pump water uphill.  Invest in more energy.
What's really cool about Suez canal, that it doesn't have any locks and it's also wide enough for ships to move on their own. It's basically straight connection of two seas.
WHY NOT ROUTE THE CANAL'S EXCESS WATER BACK INTO THE HOLDING LAKE INSTEAD OF DISCARDING IT IN THE OCEAN?
So.... now it not being maintained properly????😮
Why include climate change junk information? You could have made a good video without pseudoscience.
1:41 and then there will be more outrageous price hikes...
Can’t they just reengineer the canal to pump in water from the ocean for the locks?
Has anyone noticed that ever since we’ve been shifting over to electric power or other forms of “clean energy” that it doesn’t snow as much if at all?
As a southamerican here. It is not the terrain that is making us not build train systems. Is because the trucks unions normally have too much power in these countries. If a single railway began construction, they just stop and halt, literally starving the country. This has happened in most countries in Latin America at least once.
instead of releasing the water into the ocean, why don't they pump it into reservoirs for drinking water or pump it back into the lake?
Why is this video at 1.5x speed?
Lol YouTube is whining about how climate change is man made and trying to push Wikipedia articles on me.
so you telling me is so difficult just F kin deepen 100km canal ?.. I see something wrong in here. If its only 26 meters elevation they could deepen it over many years so it doesnt need water resources..
Free Palestine
Why is nobody referencing the opening up of the north west passage?  Maybe that’s why some of the “ billionaire class” doesn’t seem to care about climate change…???
Oh brother....another global warming commercial.
Last I heard they were building a super cana. I am sure this has nothing to do with the water problem.l
Was interesting, but what cracked me up was the shots of the pacific coast at low tide.  That’s not the effect of the drought, that’s just normal low tide on the Pacific side of the ocean (and the pollution they’ve been cleaning up close to Panama City).  The drought is real but that’s the ocean so not really related.  Most of the info isn’t new to me but it definitely is a limiting factor since it is a lock canal and not a sea level one like the Suez.  They did enlarge it a while back so larger ships can travel but if they could develop a better system to recycle more water that would be ideal.
Who is actually pocketing that $4m bribes!? Damn ...
Why would you invade another country when you can make yours better?
Why can they simply not reroute the water and pump it back up using a gravity damn into a holding area and then pumped back into the upper canal?
Edit* Woops. I guess i should have just watched a little longer... Edit*  I admit im no expert in global economics.  But its wild to me that it wouldnt be more robust and reliable and cheaper to build a port on both sides of panama and then have a bunch of railroads to transport the containers to the other side.  Even if this is a little bit slower, or a little bit more expensive, it eliminates the "oh shit its not raining and now our entire system doesnt work unless we take water away from all of our citizens" thing.
Asia goods ship out of West America, European bound good leave from east.... Don't even need the Panama canal...
My money is on Mexico. Climate change would have far less effect on shipping than it has in Panama If Biden and the Democrats had any business sense they would have invested money there instead of wasting it on Ukraine.
Trump would say the most efficient way to solve the trade problem is to add a 60% import tax on all Chinese products.
Maybe I don’t understand but why couldn’t Panama just start using water from the ocean to fill the Panama Canal and not use their lakes due to climate change and low water levels in their lakes
Why are you lying about so called @clinate change” ? There is no increase I. Droughts, hurricanes or anything else. It’s all a big fat lie.
Always about making China an enemy and the usual bullshit.
Why do we keep returning vital trade routes, places making  vital technology we need for our way of life.
So basically they are inefficiently using water. Instead of cycling water between the locks they are dumping water out of the system. I am assuming this is not done because pumping water up is hugely expensive while relying on gravity to pull water down is very cheap. If naval charters had to pay to pump water up they might not be able to afford to use the canal. I really do not know what the change in operation cost would be.
Sodium batteries are the future not lithium
We built it invested it then give it away like everything else now that Panama owns it and charges ships to go through it they making over $1 billion a year. America could use that money instead of just hand it over thanks President Carter have a peanut.
We built it invested it then give it away like everything else
Canada's Arctic is the next and more viable route. Of course they want to make that international waters instead of sovereign territory.
So dig deeper, a lot deeper. Forget the lock system and open things up.
The new millennium started January 1, 2001, not January 1, 2000.
Why’s the audio shit?
Still think we should never have given up full or at least partial control. Not like Panama could take it
You should have said WHY The houthis are attacking Civiilian Ships! Because Israel is committing genocide!
Why don't they use sea water to operate the gates  ???
more climate propaganda its everywhere then you go on to explain how the canal waste water ,no climate bs has ever been proven ever and much has been debunked the problem is surrounding areas are no longer wet jungles like before they are more like mild oasis in the savannah the lak of rain this year has already self corrected 2025 the canal will be fully functional
Id of designed it so there was another pump to return as much water as possible to the former area to cut back on water wast if that was at all possible
Its not the yemens fault its israels fault.
Mate not being mean but ... But where are the "Smart "engineers workers to just fix the problem right now because I am a dumb person just think pumps are the problem solver .
War in the middle east will eventually end… looking back thousands of years… when? 😂
Sorry for my simple brain but Why not use pumps to regulate the 1-3 gates so they can raise and lower the level that way it can reduce water loss   I'm basing this on the locks on the Clyde and forth canal so I know it might work
Time to start turning salt water into fresh water.
Greta said that due to ocean rise, by 2027 there will be no need for a canal bc Panama will be completely under the sea. "Ships will have to dodge whatever polar bears are left." And she was really angry so I believe her.
'dry season during winter' ... what? there's no winter lol, it's just the dry season
I always thought the land was just blown to smithereens and eventually there was sea level water across Panama
Start pumping seawater into the first 3 locks on each end (pump that back into the ocean). Only pump the lake water into locks 4 on each end. That reduces the amount of fresh water needed by a lot.
Why don't they just pump the sea water up into the locks ?
I have a feeling, once Panama loses 3-5% of their GDP, the ppl of Panama will start getting the short end of the stick…
The solution is to pump water up to the lake level without discharging water into the ocean during the dry years without changing the existing locks. It needs new pumps. I have seen the canal!
Cant they simply build a system that pumps the water back into the lake?
1 Jan 2000 was not the beginning of the new millennium!
This video is already obsolete.  Update it.  As of June 2024, La Niña arrived and the rainy season arrived with great force.  As of July of this year the levels of water are getting back to normal due to daily showers that supply the hundreds rivers and jungles around the canal that supply plenty of water to Lake Gatun, the main thoroughfare for ships to transit from one ocean to the other.  The normal transit is about 36 ships per day, and as of July 2024 that number is already over 34 ships daily.
Add a new larger lane than the PanaMax ships, and you wonder why?  More water usage with the larger ships in the new locks and guess what, you run  the fuck out of water.
The intro completely focused on the importance of canals to USA is a different video...
Nobody needs the chi nese plastic rubbish from shein, temu, wish and amazon. Waste of resources and ends up in Western countries landfill within days. Make ships carrying this useless trash go the long way round.
And we now have the reason why America was not willing to try extending the contract for the canal
Why don't they just pump the water back up to the lake instead of dumping it into the ocean?
What? Did the Panamanian forget to oil the locks? Did they loose the keys?
The locks need water to work, why not pump water up at each lock or through the system using mechanical windmill pumps (not electrical as that step wastes energy as heat) instead of permitting the water to drain. Also adding water screens in the mountains can trap humidity from traveling air masses, that is used in Chile to farm in the desert and may add years to the water supply.  Stop ALL HUMAN USE OF LAKE WATER as I expect that uses more than the canal and without the canal there will be no cash to feed the humans!  Step 2 use private money from eco savy persons and companies to sponsor tree replanting accompanied with new forest management laws to prevent clear cutting and any farming the forest area around the lakes.  Planting weed trees may be required to re-establish the former rainforest area. Re-plant rainforest plants in to the forest matrix.  Soon the animals will re-populate.  Some weed trees will remain and flourish, but that is the cost of reestablishing the forest.  Weed trees that I expect could work may be alder, ash, popular, pine and cactus!
I get that the subject is the struggles of shiping as related to the Panama Canal. But 3 of the 4 alternatives actually involve transloading cargo twice from ship to rail and then from rail to ship. If transloading is the only reasonable alternative, why not send ships crossing the atlantic to the USA east coast and transload once onto rail to move anyplace you want in the USA or for ships crossing the Pacific ocean to do the same on the USA's west coast? That makes trucking or rails an option and removes the need to transload a 2nd time. Both of which the USA already has significant infrastructure capacity in place to do. For the USA this just means expanding current port capabilities or creating some extra ports, adding some extra rails where rails already exist and expending/improving existing trucking routes. Not sure what im missing but the vid seems a little focused on the volume of good going to/from the USA without mentioning increasing direct shipping to the USA to disperse through its own existing transportation systems.
Cape Horn sounds like….. 1:38
The new millennium started on 1 January 2001.
Why do you have to use fresh water? Why not salt water??
Who eill build the new one and pay for it
I guess I just don't understand why they do not reuse the water? Why dump it every time? Pump it in and out in massive water tanks/pools near the canal where it can be treated or stored if needed.
LOL, fake climate change tag on this video.  You tube continues to censor and erode truth.
Looks like Panama has a chance to clean up that disgusting mess along the shoreline.
Like… recycle the fresh water back into the lake instead of the ocean?  This seems like a really easy problem to fix.  Sure, not overnight and not free but….
As the smartest guy in the world, a couple of things have occurred to me. I'm not an engineer (although I do have some technical skills), just the smartest guy in the world. It occurs to me, as you open the sea level lock, the seawater outside the lock might not immediately mix with the water inside the lock. When you let water from above flow into a lock, that water might not immediately mix with the water already in the lock. If the water was added in the correct way, a gradient would form and the freshest level of the gradient could be the part that was pumped back up to the higher level.  The end result is, the problem of ultimately pumping salt water back up to the lake might not be the issue people think it is. For another thing, the whole system could be periodically flushed. For another thing, when the fresh water supply was not stressed, there would be no need for any measure.  The problem for the Panama Canal is that the additional systems for moving cargo across the Americas already are in place. There already is the railroad across the Mexico. The highway across South America. For that matter, already land bridges across United States. The Panama Canal will not go out of business. That's fortunate for Panama. The reason why Panama has a high standard of living is because of the canal and the economic ties to the United States.
I fell asleep watching this and I swear this video just repeats itself at the midway pojnt
I already know how it works. Where do I skip to?
that's wrong only ships that are going to Israel
Ugh.  Another elaborate internet presentation that valiantly gets all kinds of key details basically wrong.
Have you never heard of WORLD WAR TWO?
Hmm... A larger ship displaces more water in the lock. This means they should be charged less, not more, because they require less water to fill the lock?
Some of the solutions to the Panama Canal problem include: (1) Build a new, sea-level canal nearby.  Nicaragua is looking at this.  (2) Increase the water in Lake Gatun by pumping from a lower elevation.  This latter solution would probably require desalination of seawater, since Lake Gatun is a freshwater lake, but this would also assist in providing more drinking water to the nearby population.  Both solutions are horribly expensive, but may have to be addressed before too long.
Why don’t they just take the water from the pacific and Atlantic Ocean? I realize this will take some retooling and changing of pumps, but it seems like it would be worth it for Panama. I’m not understanding the big problem.    Panama has engineers and construction companies. Why is this even a problem?
Calling the Houti's a major military faction is HILARIOUS
@litchar You can't pump water back up the locks without gradually raising the salinity of the lake, since each level mixes with the next whenever the ship crosses, so you have to dump some freshwater for the system to work.  The newer set of locks uses some cleverly-designed reservoirs to reduce the amount of freshwater that gets released, but it can't be eliminated entirely.
Could have used a small millions from the billions it make for pumps to pump the gaton up again instead of dumping it to the sea
Water, water everywhere but nothing can get to where it's needed!
The houthies have said they would end the blockade on ships if the bombs over Gaza stopped. Not very complicated.
Pretty sure it got replenished now.
*Looks at the nearby Panama Railway*  Gee, we could probably transload some more stuff onto that.
What about a highway or railway through the isthmus of Panama, it's much shorter than across South America! Or, use the rail system in North America, which already exists, of course will have to be beefed up.
Lol climate will not kill the channel. If they really encounter to little water at some point in the future, they will just start utilising big pumps to cycle the water in the chambers. Will consume some energy, but that will be cheap compared to not using the chanel at all.
Let's now open the Northern Passage 🇨🇦
Is there some reason most of the fresh water can't be piped back to the beginning of the process, rather than just release into the sea?
we have the resources, men power, tech and even the money, to build one if not all of this projects..... problem?? the rampant corruption of our south american governments and they unlimited amounts of stupidity and incompetency, the americans would be more than willing to back up all this projects and we have what we need, we could get the experts from them, and take the know how, but naaa, if a new president gets in, they fuck up everything just to spite the other, stupid imbeciles, we have so much resources that this continent should be the strongest of them all, economically, military, socialy and culturaly..... we have the strongest country int he world over here for fucks sake.... it pisses me off so fucking much
The US will be scammed into fixing the Panama Canal!
It's surrounded by water. Why not just use ocean water instead of fresh water? 0_o;
Surprised to learn the canal is operated by fresh water.
Should have kept it.  Smh.
Can the dying be delayed indefinitely by hooking patient Panama Canal to IVs and actually pumping massive quantities of fluids from the lower regions to the upper regions to mitigate the shortage, and if necessary, desalinate. A sort of dialysis to keep PC functioning. Seems simple. Must be something wrong with concept. What?
They should just build desalination plants along the coasts and pump evaporated water into the canal. It would be expensive, but the revenue from the canal should cover it.
The bi oceanic corrodor is so stupid. Ever heard of TRAINS?
Just pump up the sea water. Jesus christ its not rocket science.
Did this guy just shrug off the eternal struggle against peace in the Middle East with a "the war will end eventually" like something that has never happened in 4,000 years just stops like that? Seriously?
Why not just use sea water and leave the fresh water alone
You don't build something that great and they give it away that's why Carter is one of the worst Presidents ever to preside over the United States
Always blaming climate change but never questioning weather weapons
The US did not invent the Panama canal system. Here in Sweden we have the göta canal that connects Stockholm with Göteborg and that canal is around 200 years old and have 58 locks along the entire canal. In the beginning they where hand operated but most are now automatic but some hand operated are still in use as a cultural heritage.
Option 1 :  Why don't they just pump the water back to the first Lock instead of it going into the sea ?  Option 2:   Or use seawater instead (maybe that would increase maintenance costs though 🤔 seawater rusts everything).  They could employ the first option when there is less rain, then when there's lot's of rain just carry on as normal 👍
Why can the sea or ocean water be used instead of sweet water?
It's Summer of 2024. El Nino is over, and the lake should be replenishing.
Water mismanagement is what I see you’re next to an ocean and can’t use that water to run the locks
It's too bad the original engineers relied on existing lakes for the water, instead of buildin reservoirs that simply get emptied and then filled back up again
Your documentary just creates more confusion.
What’s the problem Panama got all that money from the canal and now they have problems? Thought President Carter solved the canal problems.
Not sure most of the people don’t understand who controls everything.
Remember Jacob the true house of Israel will control all the gates of the world.
How come they use ocean water for the locks? Not the top locks for the highest level but at least for the bottom 2 locks
Climate change is a hoax promulgated by world leaders for the purpose of controlling the masses and restricting freedoms and resources (it's a Marxist movement). In the '70s, scientists were predicting a Coming Ice Age. Of course, there is nothing man can remedially do for an Ice Age. So, that hypothesis was shelved in favor of man-made global warming, which is more expedient politically. Weather is cyclical. Let's not allow bad science to inform bad policies.
Why don’t they save the water instead of wasting it, I’m sure if we can dig a hole across the continent we can do something about this
WHAT ?!?!?!. A “Green” energy transition !!!.
well that one problem that us does not have. there enough passage through rock mountain that trade is not a problem. yeh that road going to economic boost to Paraguay as it be able to access new markets.
The problem with the Panama Canal is in its design not accounting for the waste of fresh water due to the oversight brought on by the historic abundance of fresh water. However (and as stated in the video) with climate change that abundance is now in doubt, and the lack of a no loss supply system to the locks have proven to be a dire design flaw. One way of mitigation would be create a new water systems management capacity, to use salt water and fresh water separately in their own distinctive lock supply buffers where the majority of the water is saved in reservoirs between leveling events. That is, instead of allowing fresh water to be lost into the lower locks with each leveling event, salt water is pumped in and then released back into the sea. However, to use such a system would require a tremendous amount of energy as gravity now feeds fresh water into the lock system (which is then lost after, which is the major cause of the issue). To use salt water to provide the lift, it would mean salt water must be pumped into the locks at tremendous energy costs. That would solve the issue for Panama, but maintain Canal dependence on the trade routes of the world. The optimal solution is to have several options so that world trade is not dependent on any single method.
Pump water uphill.
Why would Carter compromise their strategic position by giving the Canal away?  The Americans built it at the expense of many lives, and much national treasure, but Ok, let's just give it away... He doesn't make sense. 🙄
Yikes!
Desalination requires lots more energy than solar panels alone can provide.
Really great information and excellent delivery. I feel like I definitely know a lot more about today's world..economy trade and international current affairs as well as geography and climate. Thanks so much!
If the canal dries up altogether, Panama could also construct a trans national road or railway linking the Atlantic to the Pacific, like their neighbors to the north and south.
The passage around south America is dangerous also like  southern east African coast
I think the solution here is to thaw the arctic and open up the NW Passage. Time to outlaw electric cars! Gotta ramp up those fossil fuels!
I don't get it. Why not just pump the water from the locks back up into the lake? The additional money you need to ship around South America should easily cover the costs for the pumps and the fuel.
this is an easy problem to solve but its in times where we are too busy controlling the world
why is the audio so bad for this video in particular?
If other country hold this they will never let it go and put panama under their control forever panama should ne thankful that US is the country that partner with them
Use nuclear to desalinate enough ocean water to replace the fresh water that must apparently be released into the ocean. It seems the few billion dollars needed would be pennies compared to the business operations provided by the Panama canal.
Wouldn't be easy but if they created holding ponds for each lock and pumped water between the lock and the holding pond they could re-use the water almost indefinitely.
Say, you have something that needs be shipped from NYC to Tokyo......why not just transport it by truck to the west coast and then ship it out via boat? We have fuckin highways for a reason
Fuck youtube AI censorship and fuck youtube
The way you said simultaneous told me all I need to know
I never knew that so much fresh water was being dumped. Isn't there a rail option for shipping?
Brits and the French built a tunnel, under the channel.
5:01 “It has to do with unpredictable climate change.” Oh, please. Can you report and inform without resorting to made up BS?
Has there ever been any thought to capture the water that's been released to the sea?  That's would be an interesting video., discussing the feasibility of such a project.  20:18
so the list of the most corupt countries on earth is also the list of the countres where the CIA has been most active in , in order to detabilize the countries
Why is there a water shortage for something that IS water? This makes no sense to my normie mind. I mean I'm laughing at how weird this is. Why can't they just pump water from one side to the other?? Why does it have to be this big deal???
I thought the extra water from the first lock is pumped into the second lock, after the first of any 2 ships entering the same end of the canal reaches the third lock. In which case, the only water lost to the canal would be through evaporation. But I thought the same pumps also maintain the amount of water in the canal.  And since annual profits from the canal are in the billions, certainly they can also just build another canal, approximately 32 meters deep, so that ships don't have to stop. And the second canal can be wide enough for ships to enter from both ends at a time. Not only would the costs be justified in just a few years after the new canal would be opened, it would save annual costs of pumping water. Since pumping water would no longer be necessary. And eventually, even that annual difference from no electricity for pumping or opening & closing locks needed, would by itself justify the cost of such a new canal. Then for the rest of the years to come, the profits from the newer canal would continue to be greater than the profits from the first canal, even despite the cost of the newer canal. This difference being only if compared to what it would cost in electricity for pumps, if pumps were installed to prevent the canal from losing water to the ocean. Ships would also have to wait longer, because pumps would take longer to change the water levels. And with the number of ships allowed to enter the canal per day reducing, annual profits are reducing. So Panama can either just face the water crisis and let profits inevitably reduce, or use the profits while they still come, and build a new canal deep enough so that rain and water locks aren't relied on for ships being able to cross through.
They always blame climate change. Dude you said climate change like 50 times
One way this could be resolved hypothetically, is when the countries around the world are equally wealthy and has reduced cheap labor. Then the smaller materials for manufacturing can be distributed globally with less container ships.
So many interesting subjects covered in videos on this site but I can just not bear to listen to poorly produced AI narration.
The audio is so loud, move the mic back man
Build a pipeline to replenish the fresh water  back into the lake, instead of dumping it into the ocean
An example of how century-old problems resurface.
I just don t understand why they need fresh water for the locks.
Bad for panama but good for world. America can,t shift their navy easilly. Either ther do more from taxpayers money which they always do or do another massive disaster by poluting the water with saltwater from sea.
How come they don’t build adjacent reservoirs to pump the water into and out of so the same water can be reused to fill and drain the locks?
Why don't they re-engineer ot to use water brought from the Atlantic side. It's salt water, which could impact some systems, but they can fix it up to handle that. It would need to be a big project to pipe it down to the area near the locks, but it would solve the problem.
I understand Saudi Arabia is going to be putting a lot of money into Costa Rica to have access to the Panama Canal. Keep your eyes open.
Why not just pump the water back from the first lock into a seperate water reservoire or directly into the lake? This is also done with waterbridges and works perfectly fine. No water needs to be wasted. This seems like the easiest solution by far
Ships have gotten bigger
On the plus side, rising sea levels will mean they need to expend less water to lift the boats up to Lake Gatun.
Dig the panama canal down to the sea level so that you don't need locks
Meters? Are you Canadian?
The canal could not be returned to Panama. Panama never owned it or the land the canal is on.  Instead, the canal and its land, could have been given/returned, respectively, to Colombia from which it was stolen in the first place.
There’s a bullshit propaganda  warning about “Climate Change” below your video. Must mean you’re doing things right!
The lower locks could never pump their water to the lake. We’re screwed. All will die. The end.
It should use sea water and then it would be genius 😉
Panama is blowing a 3 -1 lead
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!  (that’s a palindrome)
Stop with the climate change bull shxt . Its a natural occurrence that has happened forever. The Panama canal after the united states (Jimmy punk Carter gave it away ) has been mis managed and eventually some Caucasian countries will have to fix it .
I dont understand why you just dont install large pumps... cheaper thall ALL other alternatives.
Honestly, I wish Panama can focus on other industries or resources to maintain their economy. Panama Canal is a blessed for Panamanian citizens, but yet, hoping everyone realizing how dangerous it can be if one day Panama has to live without Panama Canal.
Did... did you just blame what you admitted was a "cyclical and predictable climate phenomenon" on climate change?...
Can't  they just build a new pump system that pumps it back into the lake rather than dumping it into the ocean?   Edit: Never mind I just realized the freshwater would be contaminated by ocean water and slowly turn the freshwater lake into a saltwater lake if it was pumped back in.
stop promoting the climate change lie!  normies will believe that propaganda!  i wonder if this was made 20 years ago if you would have been pushing global warming!   OR maybe go back a bit further and you would have been promoting the Ozone lie!   LOL FOOLS
Don't forget that Russia is supporting the Houthis in disrupting global commerce.
How is doubling the ships and time to offload and reload going to be cheaper and more efficient.   Fixing the canal is the only practical option.
Dam the Indio and run Indio River Water to Lake Gatun Hagal Ahora
What about just pumping half the water back up again? I mean, it costs money but the other solutions do too.
Why not just pump the water from lock 1 back up the hill to Lake Gatun?
Dude the 7th fleet will  be the one who engages China along with the allies from Taiwan, Japan and the US military base on Guam.
Dude the 7th fleet will be the one who engages China along with his allies from Taiwan, Japan and the US military base on Guam.
USA leaders have no sympathy for humanity.  They reap what they sow.
SPOKEN SO FAST LIKE THE WATER DRAINING OUT OF THE CANALS !  ======  MATTS'
This is such propaganda calling Nicaragua corrupted😂 and tell me what about the USA? What backs their fugazzi dollar? WARS!! Nicaragua has free medical and cheap medicines for its Citizens ontop of that if you suffer from burns or cancer you have all medical expenses paid which can go into the hundreds of thousands and in the USA you better have private health insurance or you will die outside the hospitals😂  I give this blog thumbs down for pushing your colonial narrative.
U. S use of millions and millions of HEAT PUMPS causing most global warming on planet
A canal sandwiched between 2 huge oceans shouldn’t run out of water. As the situation is made worse by using the same source of water for both the population and the canal, how about using some of the huge revenue the canal brings in, to separate the 2 supplies?
Replace fresh water by sea water.
Wait wait wait.....  Some 35-40 years ago didn't a host of 'experts' loudly yell that the polar caps would be melted and everything flooded by now? That would render the canal obsolete anyway would it not?  Sail a cruise ship right into Kansas so tourists can take photos of the floating carcasses of polar bears.  Some 50 years ago we were to be frozen in an ice age by now. Hell I've been around more than 60 years. I wonder...... the massive lakes behind all those new hydroelectric dams along the rivers of South America.....  I so wish you climate change worshipers would at least get your story straight because the rest of us need to know what to panic about.
While rail alternatives are feasible, any idea that they will be financially competitive with the canal for transport are laughably ridiculous. Nothing is cheaper than sea transportation. Add to that the significant mountain ranges that every proposal across the isthmus must make, and even with competition for its reduced capacity, the canal will be the preferred shipping route... or I should say canals, plural, because even the added distance through the Suez Canal will remain a cheaper alternative than any of the rail proposals.  Rail is great when overland transport is the only option. But it is 5-10 times more expensive than water.
Why not just pump all that freshwater back to its origin point at lake gatun instead of losing it to the ocean each time you let a ship in? If its too slow, they should build a larger pipeline, right?
I ran the numbers and I don't think desalination plants will work. The biggest I can find (Jebel Ali Power Plant and Water Desalination), produces 2.2 million cubic meters, or 588 million gallons per day. That's eleven transits.
So. There’s an important point about the Houthi blockade. It’s their attempt to pressure western governments to stop backing the genocide in Gaza. Leaving out that important fact makes it sound like they’re just a terrorist or pirate group when they’ve explicitly said they would stop attacking merchant ships when Israel stops killing Palestinians.
Why can't they modify the locks to not drain the fresh water lakes? Sure, you'll need to pump more salt water up; and that'll raise costs. But surely it must be feasible?
Ships are MUCH MORE EFFICIENT at moving goods than trucks will ever be…
It seems that the US has used the Panama Canal to pursue its elective wars of aggression. Maybe the world would be better off without it?
Im glad they are rationing the canal and not people's drinking water
But how could china invade it's own territory?😅
Mexico is getting ready to cash in on this dilemma. They are building rail lines to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. They are also building factories to bring manufacturing from Asia.
Looks as  West is paying its karma for killing thousands of original naitive people by the evill USA
Note that the Panama route already has a functioning railroad-connection next to the canal.
Why not ship everything going west from the west coast and everything going east from the east coast and just use existing infrastructure to move goods between them? Yea adds another step but no need for a canal
Let’s hope that this is the kick start necessary to pursue more high-speed rail in the America’s. It’s insane to look at the rail industry and its unwillingness to modernize and instead rely on shipping containers.
I understand the cut through Mexico will be named the boondoggle diversion
Talking about how corrupt and violent SA governments are and how they'll never be able to complete some big project or whatever without even mentioning the fact that the USA put those governments in place is WHACK. But even more so on an educational channel...
52M gallons per trip...  A tanker ship can carry up to 82M gallons of liquid...
I completely agree with you.
Thanks for the detailed anaylsis! I think it's great not that the PC is having problems, but that other Latin American countries are investing in their countries to provide solutions that SHOULD benefit their working class populations. Particularly impressed by Mexico's and the people for voting in AMLO!
LOL, this video comes with a "CLIMATE CHANGE" warning!  ... THEY never stop!
Is it not possible to have a separate storage for the fresh water?  Or why not use sea water?
Also the panamanians did a huge update and upgrade to the canal that took 9-10 years and it reopened to bigger and larger ships in 2017.
The U.S military gets first dibs by treaty! Also U.S. gets shipping access priorty because we built it and the treaty that was negotiated before it would be handed over to panama.
Soo, maybe I missed something but why can’t the canal try to use sea water instead of the water from its freshwater sources? Oooorrrrr, maybe a desalination plant would be a better option than destroying the local river systems or damming the water supply further destroying more land??? I just kept asking myself “why this isn’t an option?” Or “Why isn’t this being considered?” I would try anything besides trying to take the livelihoods away from the people who live there… 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Too many locks.
The constant drum beat of the climate change hoax,if its man made,then why talk about all that trash you saw in the waters of Panama,address that,no,you go after the countries that has done major changes to help the climate, ones saying the sea levels are rising,I got an idea,quit dumping ships and sinking them for artificial reefs and its odd,all American politicians constantly talking about sea levels rising,they are the first ones that weren't rich now retired or still working are rich and buy and have mansions on the beaches.
If only there were another source of buoyant liquid nearby.
Buy some pumps🤦‍♂️
If huge cargo ships could be laid on Rail track then surely two way traffic of ships could be seen connecting both ocean and ocean to track to ocean transportation could be seen. A huge floating dock will equalise the land level and from land ships could be pulled on track. Same way again pushed from land to floating dock and once it is submerged ship would be released to ocean. A huge conveyor track would make ship transportation on land and deliver ships at both ends.
Hey , climate change all the time is nothing special , it is all bullshit and is bad for you!
utilize the oceans
I guess they can't use ocean water.  It wasn't mentioned.
It’s crazy to me you don’t mention why the Houthi’s are attacking Israeli-linked merchant ships. Not all ‘merchant’ ships.
Idk man seems like they can just recycle the water, seems cheaper than building a whole new reservoir
There is no reason why America cant fix the problem
go Iran
Why can't they pump the water back into a holding reservoir rather than letting it go into the sea?
Who is financing the corridor across Paraquay?
According to this ‘creator’, “history” only goes back 54 years to 1950.
If you go overland, you can take a truck by a truck by a truck and all that diesel and then get it on another ship but if you go through the Panama Canal, it’s just a staggering amount of containers on one ship now which one’s cheaper keep up and maintain…  K-9 0Ut…
Those other routes are also CHOCK full of political instability and corruption issues. Highjackings would be a regular thing. Cartels anyone?
Fresh water instead of draining into the sea, it must be reused in a circular motion just as we use water in a fountain  This ensures use of minimal use of Fresh water for the canal.
All the 4 alternative  routes plus panama canal is a must for trade. In addition many other short and small routes that distribute goods evenly using bharaths logistics app and intelligence  manpower will bring down cost of goods very drastically benefitting all humans in the region.
Instead of using fresh lake water and then drain it into the sea ie to say waste the available fresh drinking water, they must use sea water to operate oanama canal and divert fresh water for better human consumption elsewhere where there is water scarcity for example the nearby atacama desert to make it fertile.
The US should fund desalination plants to refill the reservoirs in exchange for perpetual control of the canal going forward. Panama gets drinking water and money from the canals and we reassert strategic controls. Everyone wins. Problem solved.
5:41 ... You confuse a ton of people by stating the water is "pumped" from lock to lock. The water is plumbed, downhill, so gravity forces water to flow, thru generators, into the lower lock, raising the ship, and prividing power for the facility (gates, tugs, lights, etc.). This lifting force is provided by raindrops that may or may not fall this second or that. Why is this video not providing info on those that have mismanaged that rain in the recent past?
Why not just use all that money and digging it out to get it down to sea level
A potentially useful video ruined by constant mentions of the bogus "climate change"
It's dying because of no water.
There is also a fake propaganda about the Panama Canal and the country itself because the success so this fake propaganda is triying to atract business and investment from Panama yo their countries. Do not believe on everything before you check the real facts
Panama will use sea water to rise the lock,
Panama will use sea water to film the locks  si no problem about dry season, ther is negative fake propaganda about Panama Canal and the succes itself of the country that other are triying to discredit and are using to atract bussines🤔😉
Well it looks it maybe the US companies will come back instead of making other countries rich..
uh why not just pump water into the locks from the ocean instead??
0:42 seconds in this video is already incorrect and pushing neocon western propaganda.  Russian, Chinese and other non Israeli, West or US ships are navigating the straight just fine.  At this point on you could discount this video as western propaganda. DG
Lol America just needs to take it back
My qustion is why don't they upgrade pumps so the freshwater pumped back in to the locks to help with raising and lowering ships
big money can overcome any nature's problem. Big deal, they'll just dig up bigger deeper canal or smth. If they are not doing it meaning problem is not that big yet.
If the system involves a bunch of pumps anyway, why don't they pump the water back to the upper locks instead of dumping in the ocean?
If the US had a robust, reliable and extensive rail network it wouldn’t be such a big problem. Trucks are inefficient and stupid to move large ammounts of freight. While trains are not as good as lage ships they are still a great option.
makes the northwest passage seem more bitterweet
Does anyone understand why the water isn’t pumped back to the lake instead of being released into the ocean? I’m not a civil engineer or anything so perhaps don’t understand anything potential problems with this but to me it seems it would save on the amount of water that the canal would use
your  annoying   to  listen   to  i  quit
Our dingbats didn't have the right to give the Panama Canal away American lives built it
Sounds like the US is finished . You need help from more technically advanced countries like China or Europe to build your infrastructure with more experience in canals and locks.
A very interesting and well put together vid, but unless i missed it, the problem with the Panama Canal, is more to do with the mix of sea water that is an endless tap, and freshwater that is not, perhaps all the lower locks on both sides should be pumped from the sea to fill?
Once again, humans industrialization causes massive disruption to the earth’s natural and necessary resources. 😢
Do away with the locks. Make a continuous Panama Canal from Atlantic to Pacific.
Thanks for the political/economic issues we are facing.  I was totally unaware of the global impact my (California) water shortage is having.
Sounds BS. Fresh water? WTF-why? Everything where US touch turns into shiiit in the end
Taiwan is part of China.  End of discussion.
So the issue is the 26m elevation. That sucks to be honest. You have to spend water with every single gate opening...
Just thinking through the geometry. You definitely got something wrong regarding shipping weight.  The amount of water needed to change elevation is smaller the more displacement the ships have. Because the larger ship is taking up space on the lock that would have to otherwise be taken up by water to get the elevations from one lock to the next to line up. Each lock is a fixed volume and the elevation change from ocean to lake is a fixed number for any particular ship.  The only way that less ship displacement would correlate with lower water use per ship is if the ships were smaller in plan area and there were a parellel set of locks with a smaller plan area. to use for them. Its also possible that lower loads are happening but you got the reason for it wrong. For example if the water level in the upper lake is too low to float ships with a deeper draft because the channel is not dredged deeply enough.
How much does the PRC have invested in this?
Just one word: Zeppelins.
While the lakes are empty how about cleaning up some rubbish
18:15 not trains??? hello???
You sure bring up Climate change often.  Like it hasn’t been changing for millions of years and all the sudden its my trucks gasoline engines fault.
Most east coast freight isn’t re routed around South America, it’s causing a backlog of west coast ports and rail inland.
Who gives a builder 100 years just because they help to build a pass??? Make it for them, and get paid 40% of all traffic... For maybe 25 years. And Ortega you need to get this done so that your country can make a little bit of money
*"PARA GUEY"**?? NO!!! PRONOUNCED " PAIR AH G WAY''!! WAY ... NOT HOW HE SAYS IT;!! IT IS AGGRAVATING
No way anyone should have to pay 260,000 just to slide through a lock! It's just asinine! Worse than dealing w crooks. The monsters. All CRIMINALS! If everyone just quit to pay for this b. s. I bet they drop price to 500 bucks!
If anyone was smart they would have made this lock just use water from Gulf to the Pacific & vise versa
Everything us earthlings Bill does nothing but destroy the environment explanation point in ruin everything
85 feet. 3.62 inches! USA BUILT THIS & PAID 4 IT.
If they are shooting missiles, why not send our US DRONES W/HELL FIRE Missiles? WE COULD Have 1000'S of unmanned drones 24 hours everyday! Plus WE, IN The USA, OSN THIS PLACE! WE PAID FOR IT & BUILT IT... SEND 3 OR 4 US MARINES, & THEY WILL TIGHTEN UP THIS MESS!!! We built it! We own it. Done deal! All we need there & ON OUR BOARDER? US MARINES! PERIOD, FLAT OUT!
As you said El Niño is a common weather effect now & in the past. It’s a natural part of the earth’s weather patterns. You commented that the canal was built before climate change was ‘understood. ‘You can strike that cause & effect b/c you can’t ‘understand’ something that is not factually or scientifically true - the fallacy of climate change. (Every climate prediction since the 1960’s has come & passed; proving over & over again it’s untrue & nonsense.) The weather patterns will readjust soon as they have for several thousand years & then we will take a look at Panama’s situation again.
That Bi-Oceanic Corridor would be better if developed with rail freight in mind rather than road, the volumes involved and speed would be much more competitive than trucking… Would be like rail connecting West and East coasts in 19th century USA
the ccp starting its invasion of taiwan by doing a first strike against US bases is not starting an invasion of taiwan. it's straight up declaring war on the US, full stop.
just make the railway, lol
More climate change fear mongering yay! Looks more like a 9ft drop in the lake is a good time to clean up all the crap in their lake.
Ah, of course Climate Change! Who knew? About time this presenter digs a bit deeper into the so called "climate crisis". The rains will return, just ask anyone in California these days.
Voiceover is cringeworthy !! Buzz Lightyear or what ??
What would it take to make it Sea Level? Natural lakes would need to be reinstated.
The difference between predicting the future and what's going on in the canal is three-fold.  Some of the boats are too big, it's probably going to rain again someday and people who create the future overreacting to relatively short term problems will screw it up.
Surprised there isn't a way to save the water and pump it back up.
Why can't the water drained from the locks be pumped back into the lake every time a ship passes through? If the pumps are too slow, then why cant it be pumped into a temporary holding lake and then pumped back into the big lake?
El Nino is ending early and we are transitioning to a La Nina quickly
Trade locals fresh water access for USA armed forces and USA economy
Mexico cannal 😂
This narrative is WRONG. Climate change is worsening the seasonal waters supply needed to operate the Panama Canal. The firs5 falsehood is that climate change is causing weather to change. But the IPCC admits that climate models are unable to model regional climate change — not even a few US states worth of area — thus, this “cause” is claimed but really unknown. Second, the real cause of canal problems is political and human. Panama increased throughput without enough expansion of seasonal water storage to support it. Therefore, your entire narrative is misleading and wrong.
Latin American again is handed a cash cow on a silver platter and proceeds to ruin everything in 2-3 decades. No surprise here.
The solution is simple !  The cannel must repump the water back to the superior lake using eletrical pumps and charging the transport companies for the costs ! I think is better to do this than to provide war apology  throught the Internet  !
I'm the type that thinks "DO ALL THE PROJECTS!" Build the Argentina/Brazil line!  Build the Colombian canal!  Revitalize the Panama canal!  Build the Nicaraguan canal!  Build the Mexican canal! Having multiple routes across the Americas is great for everybody!!
Use ocean water instead. Repipe it. It doesn't take a genius to understand this. It's not climate change, it's poor original design. Run a side canal with side doors, that opens to the ocean. In a planet 75%water, you're not out of water, and it's not the real issue, your design is the problem.
If your goal is to transport between the eastern U.S. coast and eastern Asia, or from western Europe to eastern Asia, why not ship around the northern coast of Canada?  Seems that with global warming, that route is increasingly viable... at least during summer.
Well my first impulse was to say - just build a nuclear desalination plant ....... however then I learned that the biggest desalination plant in the world in Saudi arabia produces just milion cubic meters of fresh water a day - which would be enough for just 5 ships to pass. I guess you could make it a bit better by some clever engineering at the last lock - where you would pump water out of the lock at the same out as you pump in more sea water (therefore extracting water that is less salty than your regular sea water - and using that for desalination)..... but still .....
Wait, why TF did they design it to use fresh water instead of pumping in ocean water?
If trucks across Brazil were competitive with ships going around south, then trucks across America would be even more competitive. The canal has value because trucks are really bad at moving goods over distance
Hey genius, China can’t invade Taiwan, because Taiwan is a China province, which the US and the international community recognized as such.   Therefore your comment regarding China invading Taiwan is both war propaganda and misinformation.
Fully loaded ships would displace more water requiring less water in the lock..what am I missing?  Is it that it lightly loaded they don’t have to change the lock levels so much?
It would seem that the fresh water could be  retained by using two gates at the ocean out lets and pumping water back and forth between the other locks. lots of money though I bet.
Why don’t they pump water back into the lake after each use?
No one is going to sail around south America ..Panama fix the problem soon or someone else will...
Guess who is building all that infrastructure in Central and South America? C-H-I-N-A
Run a pipeline between the locks that raise and lower the ships to each other. I'm instead of letting water out of the middle lock in the adjacent lower lock let it go into the lower lock on the other side of the canal. Would cut the amount of fresh water needed in half.
What drug is the narrator on? Speed?
Since I don't see anyone pointing it out... please stop reading '8.24' as 'eight-point-twenty-four'. The accepted standard is to read in single digits after the decimal point.
i am sorry but . that just screamed 'super nation exceptionalism we built so it so special!' crap.. ''differently then most in world yada yada''  locks.. to 'raise' ships to higher water lvls , personally i have not heard of any canal in the world LACKING such a feature , i'd honestly be more surprised over a man engineered canal not having it then anything else , and sure its likely among the lager scale versions but still :/ also , hmm strange its almost as if having a few spots in a world be the sole providers of various things is long term idiocy compared to a majority local production XD  and yee ''never tolerated by washington'' sorry tell me agen wich nation that often internally whines about the U.n wich not commands but only 'encourages' as its said being ''scary world government in making!'' ..yet wants to dictate how other nations plans infrastructure ,not to mention playing world henchmen so mega corps can buy cheap banana's yeee..  if washington wanted to show 'no tolerance' and a hint of maturity about its past it could offered the same funding and slightly better deal to nicuaraga then it did to panama  otherwise it be like say france 'not tolerating' the panama canal when it was us controlled pff  super nations , mega corps , global religions.. despots hiding behind semantics all of em
If the ship displaces less water, then it require more water to fill the rest of the place in the gate. If there is no ship you need to full the whole place. And if the ship is huge you bearly need any water to fill arownd it.  I hope this is mistake in the video and not in their govermant decisions....
All alternatives to the Panama canal are suitable only for commerse. Even if all 4 alternatives are implemented, the Panama canal will remain crucial to the US Navy for quick redeployment between the Atlantic and the Pacific, so enen if international trade dries up for the canal, I think the US will subsidize the maintenance and continued function of the canal, probably securing priority service for US Navy ships.
There could always be highway built through the Darian gap, it's a simple solution, 😮
Oh trust if there’s a war. Well take the Panama Canal right back. So don’t trip
Ask Elon Musk and Bezo I would  prefer two billionaires to own Nicaragua canal… just a thought.
Take a breath
Very Interesting…  Costa Rica 🇨🇷 dry/Canal  will be 👏 a great 👍 option.
On the Panama Canal draughts and water consumption.  As the Canal success drove the development of the city's and society. The population has grown unexpectedly faster and then predicted. They need the fresh water now too maintain the society.   Can't the ingenious humans use sea water to operate the locks. We can run miles of oil pipelines. Why not pump sea water? Cost of services is simply the cost of transportation.
I am an Ecologist (meaning a scientist working in Ecology) and this episode is depressing. We should have learnt that engineering solutions to deal with nature its a bad idea... sigh
Only 905 million dollars, life must just be so tough
Why not just build a rail system though Panama instead of wasting money on the canal?
Well, this might be naive,  but why not pump ocean water up those 26 meters, have the whole operation done with sea water?
Can't they pump back the water from that last operation back to the first one??
TLDR 7:30
Tbe new/current millennium did NOT start on 01 January 2000
TLDR 7:30
They have to isolate the canal from the lake and start using the ocean water. The problem is that they probably don't have (or don't want to spend) the funds necessary to upgrade the system. This is what happens when you want something but don't have the proper plans to upgrade and/or maintain it. The US probably would've already dumped massive amounts of resources into getting this fixed just because we have massive amounts of resources lying about. Can't say the same for Panama. The problem for them is that we're not going to do it purely for another country's benefit. The government would probably want the canal / total control of it back 😭
Instead of letting the water go into the ocean why don't they just pump it back up into the into the lake?
Why does it feel like we are charting a course back to the 1700s?
Us should take panama back. We can't leave such an important infrastructure to some backwater tribes.
What is possibly wrong with suggesting Desalinization?
12:50 is wrong.  The load restrictions (actually draft/depth restrictions) are due to the water levels in the lake.  In fact, the amount of water required to raise the level of the ship is fixed at the loch surface area multiplied by the total elevation difference and entirely independent of the ships size and weight.  It's not intuitive but if you have a measuring cup that holds 2 cups and you want to raise it from the 1 cup line to the 2 cup line you have to add 1 cup of water, it doesn't matter if you have rubber duck in it or if you fill the bottom half with sand first, you still have to add 1 cup of water to move the water level up.
Idk sounds like unloading cargo on one side than loading on the other is a good way of losing or getting cargo stolen. Especially in Colombia and Mexico, you might send 3000 containers and a 3rd will arrive pilfered.
This is an unintelligent construction taking water from the lakes! They need to rebuild it so water comes from the ocean instead!!!
Why did the US invade Panama and kill 300o people?
who now owns the Panama Canal...   China
What if they just close those gates and just make the canal connected directly to both side of the ocean? And just let the ships pass? ?
Fascinating content with information I have always wanted to know more about. It's a great thing to learn about new things with such global impact.
Fight over Israel?  Ot looks to me like the american administration is behind iran more than halfway and has one foot out of our alliance and relationship obviously is lifeless . .. especially when America has judgements pending and surely we can see the first stages of being given over ate normal bow
At the 4:44 mark that is me on the far left wearing the grey pineapple shirt! That was taken back when i was working onboard one of the National Geographic ships!
I love watching these videos. I created a detailed summary of this video here, in case anyone wants to reference this content.  Since I cannot post links, you can Google search the following: Idle Speculation - Why the Panama Canal is Dying — @RealLifeLore @RealLifeLore Infographic Summary
The upside on the Colombia train thing: There is not a single red flag in this entire concept.
Can’t they just set up a new pump system and pump seawater into the locks?
So, like, why has no one made a new set of pumps to get the water from the lowest locks back to the lakes instead of dumping it all into the sea?
Dradge
Why can't they just dradhe the canal that would take care of the water problem
The canal isn’t going to die, it’s far too Important for anyone to let something like that happen. It’s in trouble, yes. But the Panamanian government will figure it out. They have to lol.
It's interesting how you mention the canal's history as it relates to the US, but not how the US built the canal by backing separatists with military force. Or how for a long time, the very idea of the US giving Panama their own land back was something people in the US resisted.   I pair this with the way you mention Houthi military activity without mentioning any connection to why ( the Israeli genocide in Gaza ), and wonder why you even bother with even a pretense of historical background or world events.   Either it's half-assedness or willful omission. Do it right, or don't bother. There's better historical information on an episode of Pawn Stars.
what are the Ships at sea going to use if not desiel?? == i can not see a ship at sea going electric!!
Why doesn't the us just do what China did and build a canal through its giant lakes and rivers?
Why do they not pump the water back up to the lake. Several large pumps possibly?
Help me understand y tf can’t they just build a pipeline from the Pacific Ocean & pump ocean water back n forth to fill the water locks instead of using fresh lake water?
Can't they reuse most of the water, instead of pushing it into the sea?
Idk if Thai is a stupid question or not but why can’t they just use ocean water in the canal? Wouldn’t that solve the problem
This just means higher higher prices because of “climate change”.
excellent presentation.
The Chinese plan to build a canal over Nicaragua. That’s if the USA sits on its hands and talks BS in Congress for years😱
May need to get rid of lock system. Use the ocean flow as a source of hydro electricity it would be like Niagara Falls.
Another of Jimmy Carter’s poor judgments as he did with walking away from Taiwan and botched Iran hostage crisis. Now USA has to redo the canal and TAKE IT BACK. We can’t wait for a Taiwan invasion to fix Carter’s mistake. BIDEN TALK TO PANAMA NOW TO RECLAIM IT.
Note USA gave Panama to canal
Convey as in u boat  threat
You stated that loads had to be reduced to decrease the amount of water needed to raise or lower the boats due to “displacement”. But the exact opposite would be true. The higher there load, the larger the displacement, and thus the lower amount of water needed to change the level of water a given measure. Instead they should maximize the load on each ship to decrease the water usage.
Why do they not pump the water back into a water basin or the lake to help
I may just be retarded, but if a ship displaced more water to achieve a predetermined elevation, wouldn't it take less water to reach that elevation? Doesn't "displaced" mean something is not there?
Climate changes should be noted that China Russia and many other European nations don’t care about climate change
Jimmy Carter, the worst president till Biden arrived, gave the canal the U.S. spent billions on away.
The solution is simple. Make a nuclear plant and use salt water from the ocean to cool it. The fuck down if salt water is not doable, use a purifying plant to clear the salt water. And now you have salt and clear water that you can pump into the lake and or the plant
Is there a way to capture the fresh water rather than just expelling it the ocean?
Wayyyyyyyyyy too many commercials!
Part of the original plans for the Panama Canal included, placed alongside the locks, great cement pools, aka water holding tanks, wherever water from the locks could be pumped out as needed to lower water in a lock and held in the tank then, when the water in the lock needed to be raised that same water could be pumped back.  This, along with auxiliary pumping systems that would replace any water level in the retaining pools that was lost through leakage in the locks, or evaporation, etc, although that was expected to be minimal.  That system was planned for construction once the canal was in operation and making enough money to pay for that construction was designed along the lines of many of the lock systems in European lakes and rivers, especially in Germany and Austria.  The reason for holding tank for water at each lock meant that very little water would be required from the ecosystem, the lakes, and none would be just pumped into the oceans and lost, as the water for operation would be used over and over again.  By the time the canal was at the point of paying for the construction of the tanks, control of the canal had changed and the capital that had been held for that purpose was felt to be needed for other things, or seemed to just drain away, and those in control saw a canal functioning just fine without reusing and recycling water at the locks.  Given the billions the canal has mad one would assume that, better late than never, as they now have the evidence as to why there had been  plans, when thr canak was originally designed to eventually recycle water as the planners knew that the water in the lakes would have seasons where they could not supply  fresh water all time, that they would have now started this construction but the money to do this seems to be always directed elsewhere.  What I do not understand is why more use of shipping containers by rail or even truck, across the US, as  both the rail and highway infrastructure is already in place.  Containers already do move east and west across the continental US, and rail companies have been complaining for years that they are under utilized.  It may mean the US gov needs to stop talking about all the highway infrastructure money they are spending and actually apply it to upgrade roads and bridges.  When it comes down to it, history tells us that trade needs to increase and trade routes have to be carved out globally, not just to supply those populstion centers already there but to imptove and modernize and grow new population centers especially as population increases.  There is no reason, if they are feasible and funded projects that do not destroy ecosystems there is no reason thst only one has to be developed along with fixing the problems Panama has as the benefit of competing trade routes, and certainly increases in trade amounts will make the more alternatives better than none at all.  Then again, with climate change on  going trade routes opening through the heretofore only dreamed on northwest passage could make shipping quicker than any other route, free of impact by any countries in disagreement and only a couple of months out of the year where alternatives would be needed.
In Costa Rica, there's also a dry canal project, but it's stuck by truckers protesting against losing revenue
Why doesn’t Panama request aid from the UN and the Organization of American States so that Panama can build salt water desalination plants ( solar & wind powered) on both ends of the canal to aid in water replenishment. It will provide jobs to Panamanians and help keep the canal open!
I don’t think it would be a surprise
All of these proposals are over land. What's the time feasibility of these projects? By that I mean how long would it take goods to get from one side to the next? It could be faster to just go around South America.
Why trucks and not trains?? Seems dumb, must be a good reason. Geographic? Prohibitively more expensive?
Canal has always worked on gravity power, a change from gravity to electric power would allow electric pumps to recycle the fresh water to prevent destruction of salt-sensitive life.
26:10 oh God, why tf would you ever agree to that with china?
Build a retaining lake and don't dump the fresh water in the ocean.
All they have to do is to pump the water back up the canals, problem solved
I accept that my engineering skills are more of a child's dream than a possible reality, but couldn't we dredge the shit out of the Panama canal to make it passible by all ships? Still charge a toll and not ruin the GDP of the country. But at least not spend fresh water in the daily passing of cargo? I've seen entire palm tree shaped islands created and inhabited in Dubai. San Francisco still exists as a city as we build upon land that was not there before. Can we not cut a path for passage in Panama?
Why can the canal use seawater?
Bro it’s a river how does it break down. Just make more river
We all know the weather warming is not truth, it is a hoax
The US aircraft carriers cannot fit through the Panama canal which is basically what's used insurer of battleships
am i going insane or could they just yk… find a way to use ocean water and not fresh
So theze kooks can build a canal waste a lakes fresh water but not build an ocean water supply to the canal. Another kook plan to control the third world
Why don't they pump the water from the first lock to the third lock
Stop spending money
Geo Engineering is causing the world wide droughts to fit the Global Warming Agenda!
Why not consider a sea level tunnel? Bypass the need for locks and save the water
What about another alternative that climate changes helps: the canadian arctic passage?
IT'S SAD THAT NICARAGUAN ARE OK WITH THEIR CORRUPT COUNTRY, THAT EXPLOITS THEM WHILE SPEWING COMMUNIST CREATED FOOLING IF THE MASSES PROPAGANDA, BS.  YEAR IN YEAR OUT, & SUCH COMMUNIST PUPPET HAVE THEIR COUNTRIES IN POVERTY WHILE BLAMING IT ON OTHERS, & THEY BELIEVE IT, FOR LACK OF OUTSIDE REAL FREE PRESS INFO.
High speed rail seems like an alternative and Elon Musk tunneling ability could make it easier to go through mountains.
HUTHIS GET IRAN'S WEAPONRY THAT CONES FROM RUSSIA, SO AGAIN ITS CHINA & RUSSIAS ATTEMPTS AT DESTABILIZING, DEMOCRACIES, BY OBSTRUCTING THEIR PROGRESS, OR PASSAGE OF TRADE, IN WHICH CHINA WANTS TO MONOPILISE, RESOURCES, TRAVEL AREAS FOR TRADE, & FISHERY STEALING, & ARMING TERRORISTS
This isn't climate change its climate engineering when the world's in chaos to mask it and sell climate change
Panama's lack of rain is not from " Global Warming " so much as it's from the loss of Rainforest in that part of the world....
Why? Because we paid for it TWICC and that imbicile jimmy carter gave it away. If we still  controlled it, it would be in our interest. Where did this peanut farmer come from?
Jimmy Carter was one shitty president and the buffoon is still alive collecting over a million dollars a year off the taxpayer
Turns out Panamanians can’t govern their own gifted items
Why not make the canal deeper, starting at both ends?
I think I got it. The new plan is to transport the US warships from Atlantic to Pacific on trucks and trains. I wonder if a plane can land on a hangar ship, travelling on a  high speed train.
Darien Gap must have a new canal for larger ships and Panama Canal must be maintained.  Our civilization requires a big dose of civility😍💖
Why we talking about lakes and water.  You have the whole pacific and Atlantic oceans on either side. Start investing on a sea water pipe and leave the fresh water alone
Who the hell thinks green energy is still happening? The dying western inteligencia have a cult like obsession with it but it has been a complete failure.
People out here still pretending climate change is real
Just dig it all out at sea level.  Use new tech.
Bro the war in the Middle East will never end
We should have assets waiting and ready in Hawaii if we are smart.
"Tactical nukes sounding pretty good right now." - Biden
Why can’t they use ocean water?
El Nino occurring every 2-7 years is anything but, regular. Regular implies concistancy...
It’s in trouble because they have expanded the locks and increased capacity beyond that of the working design of the canal. Climate alarmists talk nonsense!
What about pumping sea water into the locks?
I’m Panamanian and I got to tell you, they did teach me about the canal when I was in middle school, matter of facts I went on a school trip to the canal and I got to tell you first 9 min of this video I learn more about the canal than I did all 14 years I lived there, all I knew about it was how the boats pass through it.
The cia never counted on people wising up to their ff operations , but they overplayed that hand once or twice too often for their own good . Now everyone knows exactly what they have been up to and currently are into .
Our leaders could care less whether the canal is operating or not , they just dont care.
US should not have given over control to Panama. (opinion) Panama didn't engineer it and commit to its development.
WHAT CAUSES THIS IS RICH AND POWERFUL LEADERS NEVER PUT THE MONEY BACK INTO WHAT MADE THEM RICH BECAUSE THEY ARE STUPID AND EVIL. CLIMATE CHANGE IS A JOKE EXCUSE BECAUSE ITS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE TIME BEGAN.
Climate change, LOL.
If you don't mind me saying so,  YOU WISH.
The new Millennium and 21st Century began on January 1, TWENTY OH ONE!  NOT 2000.
that bioceanic corridor looks like a great fix, until you consider how deserted some areas are and the likelihood of being hijacked by those able to also recognize the value of goods flowing through that area.  "protection money" will be a cost to be accounted for without a doubt.  much harder to hijack a giant ship on the water than a truck on a deserted road.
Imagine of scientist had been warning the goverments for decades on end about what could cause all the unstable weather patterns we are finally seeing today... oh wait they did
It's not dying, they have several options.  Why does everything have to be sensationized as "the end of civilization as we know it"? 😂
Climate change BS.
I thought there is a new railway across mexico?!?
Why can't the dams just use sea water for operating the ship lifts?  Edit: Just realized that that would contaminate the people's drinking water by getting salt water into the fresh water lake
It doesn’t make sense, use ocean water to gate 3, then use lake water for gate 3, or use gate 1 water in gate 3.
Commentator talks too fast, like he’s gonna piss his pants unless you open the bathroom door… right now!
Build  freshwater holding reservoirs alongside the low levels, then pump the water back instead of discharging into the sea.
Lies!! The globalist cult (agenda 2030) just wants to blame the panamanian's of failing with it's administration for the communist goal of internationalizing it (The Panama Canal), envy exposed by the politicized fake news wording chosen.
STOP GLOBAL WHINING!!!!
I would like to think that we will soon have advanced technology that will make the Panama Canal obsolete except for tourism. Panama was a part of Colombia and was stolen so that the U. S. Could create and control the canal. Funny how you skipped right over that detail…”The opportunity presented itself” lol!!!!
Need to re-discover the North West Passage ladies and gentlemen! It provides the same benefit as the Panama Canal, but without the size restriction. It only has seasonal restriction between April or May, till October or November. That's for starters. Also, there has been talk a good 25 -30 years to provide a second, or alternative Panama Canal through Nicaragua. I heard that they started to dig for it, but then I never heard about it again. It needs to be re -started pronto.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 what an AWESOME PROPAGANDA!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 It's FUNNY that whatever the DEMS touches TURNS to 💩!!! Climate Change is NOT the PROBLEM!!! HUMANITY is the PROBLEM!!!
... OMG it's just bad engineering ... why do you waste the water  the panama canal should have been reengineered
Why not collect the water into a😅 storage dam and reuse it instead of pumping into sea. I'm sure they can afford it . Problem solved .  So rich but so poor.
You can always build another cannal
Jeff Bezos' Amazon, (with its infamously fast shipping just for fun,)  should be hit up for several billion in cash to fix the canal OR at least be part of the committee that will decide what fix for the problem will be, then pay their share of it.
Something that should r be ignored is how dangerous the currents are in the Drake Passage.
The other benefits from low water could be to pick up all the trash on the shorelines!!! Looked like a garbage dump!!!
Can't they just pump the water back into the other locks instead of releasing it into the ocean essentially causing a drastic cut in water wasted? It seems like an easy option but I don't really understand the engineering requirements to make that work
Why not dredge it out deep enough where the locks aren't needed
I can see Mexico(south), Nicaragua, South-West France, Georgia and Aserbaidjan with southbound Iran create canals in the future, only to cut off money to other contries^^
🎉 Good news with global climate change and sea levels rising soon won't be a problem. Or will it
Pump desalinated ocean water into an isolated reservoir to feed the inside locks that now require fresh water to fill. The technology has made leaps and bounds to become cost effective in this situation. The salt removed through filtration can be sold as sea salt.
"Unpredictable Climate Change"  Just stop already, it is an engineering and resource distribution failure.
The Panama Canal can get a break if United States builds a new canal from the Rio Grande to the Pacific
Desalination using the water pressure of each loch is a simple approach.  Had America maintained control this type of solution would already have been initiated.
Lol political people will always push for man made non factual evidence to take your money and control you 😂 don’t give into them.
Why cant salt water be used? Why cant a method of desalination be invented... ?
This is why democrats are destructive of US interests and help communist China!!! Carter gave it away and now China owns it. Democrats are the worst enemy of constitutional republic that once was a great nation.
That's God's work
why is your audio so distorted?
Video starts at 5:27
How come they can’t just dig the canal deeper. Obviously it would be expensive. But over time would pay for itself plus wouldn’t need fresh water.
There are no pumps. The water flow is natural.
You would think it would make more sense to just ("just") pump the water from the sea into the locks. Obviously, would require something to prevent seawater from contaminating the lake but there has to be a solution that's better than "lets just add more water".
You don’t have to go around the bottom of South America adding 8000 nautical miles.   You should freight the goods to the other coast of the US by train and then use the same ocean on each side and not use the canal at all.   Goods from the East Coast of the US freight to the West and then ship to Asia. Goods from the West Coast of the US freight to the East and then ship to Europe.  The new millennium didn’t start on Jan 1 2000 but Jan 1 2001. Really!  It’s not rocket surgery - if there’s not enough lake water or rainfall - take water from the oceans either side. They should have started building pumps and pipes for this as a backup decades ago. And stop wasting fresh water.
Is it not possible to pump desalinated water back to the lake ?
Why would we give up control of such a vital asset?  More anti-colonial white guilt?  How's that working out?  The Panama canal is a wonder and we built it, yet we are ashamed.
Trucks? And not ... Trains
Most people who think it’s crazy to live in 115 degree desert heat never experience the other 8 months of perfectly seasonable weather where consumption of energy for neither cooling nor heating are required. Nor is it generally acknowledge that living in a cold climate is equally resource intensive. Taking water from areas of excess (and short growing seasons) to support farming in areas that are perfect other than lacking water just makes sense. The core problem is the infrastructure lag. That being said, we can always be more efficient in our practices, but looking at distribution of resources at a a national scale makes far more sense than at a local one.
Maybe time to come back to initial sea level crossing?
I stopped watching right after you started talking nonsense abut displacement !! a larger ship won’t use more water, that’s absolutely ridiculous ! it displaces more water which means  it will take less water to fill up the lock to raise the ship to the same height
Panama Canal may be sick but is imortal.
Wasn’t China trying to create the belt n roads project but the west just made up lies to shut it down??🤷🏽🤷🏽
This is Funny!
you had to bring up the climate change hoax.  shame on you
Dont' worry. Eventually due to climate change, the oceans will rise and there will be no need for pumping. Or transport.
Why can't they recycle that water why do they have to let it go out to the ocean
Pump the lock water back into the lake, build whatever powerplants it takes.
FUOK your propaganda
Gives them time to clean up all that trash.
I think the solutions in Mexico, Colombia and Paraguay will eventually take place. It just makes sense for Colombia to connect both oceans. Mexico can attract a lot of companies in the area. And the roads in South America will eventually be connected. It will take time though. But transportation by ship is still more efficient.
Isn't there a solution for Canada and the USA using the Arctic sea up in North? Climate change can be bad for Panama but could also allow transportation through the north pole.
There’s a railway that runs along the Panamá canal. Why no mention?
Oh great a country located in SOUTH AMERICA definitely wont try to illegally place the dams just to save their gdp and completlely grape the ecosystem and habitatam
Climate change is a lie. Guess what, the climate ALWAYS changes. To say that man has a direct affect is giving man far too much power.
It seems to me that the fresh water that is being released into the ocean should instead, be pumped back into the lake that it came from.  Expensive engineering buy less expensive than closing the canal or letting the people die of thirst....also perhaps a desalination should be built.. cost should not be a reason not to when the people need water to live.  Very good video
They should use salt water from the oceans  instead of freshwater for drinking
there's a crisis happening with your microphone, that's for sure.
So atop using one of each set of parallel locks.
Why have engineers not thought of pumping the water 💦 back from the lock that it came from, instead of letting it go into the ocean?
Kilometers? Where are you from?
Shame. If it would be only by the sea or ocean but....
Their was a way to fix it use salt water for the locks and not freshwater
Is it me or is the writting in this one.... really odd? Many thoughts and sentences being repeated 2x or even 3x.
Have you ever actually been around one of these Capes?  The South America o e is no joking matter.
Did you record the audio inside a tin can?...
Appreciate the Taylor Swift reference
At the end of the day, I hope the Mexican railway will succeed. It will change the lives of so many people for the better
Can anyone explain to me why the water is pumped into the ocean and not back to the lake ? That's a very odd choice.
the drake passage has limited availability. it is very far South, the storms there make it impassable for most ships for the middle of the year - Winter in the southern hemisphere.
How about build a canal along the southern border of the US from San Diego, CA to Port Isabel, TX. That way you can control the border and profit from the canal at the same time.
Just Take a pump and pump water from the seas Back into the River..
17:48 I have been to That place. IT IS only a few Kilometerstand away from my Home. I usually Go there by the Underground Train, Like a Lot of people in Hamburg.
Because the US gave it away to a third world country.
Neither Paraguay nor Columbia will finish their vision. It's south America, they are too corrupt.
I hear the Suez canal problem could be solved by no longer giving free stuff to Israel.
Between this and the issues that have developed with shipping through the Red Sea I keep coming back to this in regard to American economic concerns. Take out two birds with one stone. Help Mexico truly develop industry. The cost of living there is significantly lower than in the U.S. so cost of manufacture shouldn't be too great. Just imagine what a massive boon it would be to the trucking industry. Even shipping via the Gulf and Pacific routes would be rather simple I would imagine. Trains as well.  Costs of shipping should be less as well overall and another potential offset to costs of manufacture in that country.  I also like to imagine it would have at least a decades long, however temporary, beneficial impact on immigration issues. If Mexico had the industry it could actually offer incentive for the native population to achieve the increase in standard of living they desire and help mitigate that particular U.S. national interest without locking the rest of us in and them (migrants) out with a greater wall.  And the dark imagination of keeping Mexico down so as to protect national security interests doesn't suffice.   This measure has great promise despite new issues that would certainly develop. China needs to go and the shipping issues are just another harbinger of sorrows if we don't do something significant.  Helping our neighbor and by proxy the U.S. is about as good as anyone could reasonably hope for.
Why don't they use the water on the canal and use the money to buy water?
Too bad.
Giving back the Panama Canal was the worst thing done by one of the worst Presidents ever.
I love it when people cite "climate change" but can't actually provide any source or proof....what a crapshoot.
The amount of misinformation or the use of alleged facts as actual facts... Holy propaganda
I've also heard that due to climate change the ice above Canada has melted enough that some ships have navigated over the top of North America. If Canada invested some money and marked out a route it might be a viable option too
pump the fresh water back!!!!!
Wow I fucking hate USA haha
Another YouTuber rambling for views 😂. Enjoy!
Easy. The US is no longer in charge of it.
Just like just about everything in South and Central America corruption is rampant.
Why not pumps? Would it be too expensive to pump that water back up?
The best solution I see is storing the water, like the new locksets do. Finding a nearby place to hold it might be an issue and they might need to augment gravity with actual pumps. Beats bringing commerce to a halt and perhaps giving a competing system a leg up, which Panama could be hard pressed to recover from once its operational.
why cant they use the higher ocean to supply the lock, instead of the fresh water lakes?
It's interesting that you have overlooked the Panama Railway which has been operational for decades carrying containers between the two ports of the canal. Expansion and upgrade could also increase the carrying capacity of the "fifth" alternative.
Desalination plant is one of the solution to drinking water and canal's freshwater needs .
UN AND NATO AND JOE BIDEN  MAFIA  IS BEHIND IT ALL..USING OUR TAX PAYERS MONEY TO ILLEGAL ALIENS
The El Niño occurs an average of 8-12 years. No evidence of this being anything but a short term, 1-2 year issue.
Mexico has entered the chat: help is on its way 👍
And here i am wondering how at 4:35 argentina with almost 50% poverty is 2nd in human development. What?
Re Colombian railways, there used to be a connection between the railways on both sides of the country. This was the Ferrocarril de Antioquia, which ran from Puerto Berrio on the Magdalena River (and a connection with the line to the Atlantic Railway) through Medellin to a connection with the Pacific line north of Pereira. However, a mix of corruption, incompetence, the trucking lobby and the violence of both the drug and guerrilla wars put paid to that by wrecking the whole Colombian railway system. The same goes for the line climbing from La Dorada (end of the present Atlantic network) to Facatativa over La Tribuna Pass then on to Bogota. The tracks are (mostly) still there hidden under the heavy brush, the line hasn't seen a train for the best part of 30 years. Rather a pity as the final ascent of La Tribuna was, judging from film footage, nothing short of spectacular, to the point that the Colombian Railways actually built Vista-Dome coaches in its shops to operate over the section, the only ones in Latin America and possibly the only narrow-gauge (3ft) ones in the world.
I really enjoy these videos, but the audio quality on this one is atrocious. I couldn't last past 2 minutes
So pump the final lock back into the top lock instead of the ocean. Or blast down another 26 metres and make the whole canal sea level.
Dude, trucks? Start building a train line...
The Houthis who control that canal said that they will stop when the genocide in Gaza against the Palestinians end....so.....
We have abundant fossil fuels   Green energy is not necessary
Wait. So we built it and then gave the canal away?
long winded waste of time, I read about it somewhere else,
I’m not educated enough in this situation, but why haven’t they thought about reusing water? Or building infrastructure to pump sea water to the canal from either one of the seas? I mean technology now is advanced and if they’re really that rich I feel like they have a few options for getting water from elsewhere to use for the canal
The solution is simple.  Instead of dumping the 52 million gallons of fresh water from the final lock back into the ocean, pump it back to the reservoir, thus lowering the water level of the final lock without releasing any fresh water into the ocean.  Clearly a far easier and less costly solution than building the canal.  It would likely slow the speed on the final of the 6 total locks ships go through between the two oceans and it would cost some electricity.  But creating a water pipe capable of moving 52 million gallons in maybe 10-20 minutes seems achievable.
Lets just go back to airships
It's so easy.  Pump the water from the bottom lock to the top lock.  Simple.
Solution is simple. Invest into water storage facilities. Make efforts to recycle water. Restrict water usage. Problem solved.  However, seeing how much trash there is in their crucial lake, it is obvious to me that this is just another banana republic which got lucky. It will be swept aside into irrelevancy soon as their historic lucks runs out.
Why don't they just install a pump that takes the water from the bottom lock back up to the lake when needed? I feel like that's a very easily fixed problem.
Why cant they just pump ocean water into the first lock?
Why are you using the invasion of Taiwan where Taiwan is part of China?  This is how much the West knows about the history of China!
They better figure it out or the Navy gonna turn the Canal and surrounding area into a base and figure it out for them.
I’m pretty sure the solution is somewhere in the YouTube comments.
why not pump water back???  yes it takes energy, but does waste less water. as long as salt water only stays in the locks
charge more then use that money for long term fresh water solution. also buy water
El niño is associated with warm water which drives HIGHER than average rainfall. La niña leads to lower than average rainfall for Eastern Pacific
52 million gallons of fresh water per ship? Holy fucking inefficiency Batman. Goes to show how little mind we pay to fresh water.
power to the ansarallah movement
IMO you should have listed why the huthis are bombing. they think the global economy has been a destructive force and a mostly negative thing. with climate change, factory off shoring, and the way bigger countries attack smaller countries being negatives. specifically the ongoing genocide in palistine being enacted by isreal and its western allies. the west backs isreal because they vew it as an important chess piece to control the middle east and thus controll that section of global trade. so the huthis are motivated to fight against western powers. whom they views as destructive forces and a threat to their safty, and they want to show that isrial does not actually grant the west control over the middle east.
Its also very worth mentioning that while the Panamanian government technically OWNS the canal they don't actually run it as they hired a Chinese company to do the actual running of the canal.   I mean technically they just run the ports on either side & are contracted to repair the canal so... yeah, US was big dumb to not remain involved in running the canal.
3:22 I highly doubt of the Panama canal's significance in the case of war. Over Taiwan anything of military trying to pass through the canal will be a sitting duck for the Chinese sabbotage groups to take advantage of.
We're reviving the beagle canal with this one
Am I crazy or does the audio sound horrible?
Why not build railways on either side of the Panama to transport some of the demand across??
Serious question - if you build a massive hub for commerce in the middle of Mexico, what do you do when the cartel shows up at your front door asking for their cut.
All I’m hearing is that prices are just going to keep going up and up for anything made in China now for us in the US.
Go to 7:40 for the answer
Got to love US politics where US pays/builds something just to give it away for free.
Why is Yeman conducting the block aid? Because there's a plausible genocide in Gaza with its population starving in growing numbers to death. You make it sound like they're attacking because Iran told them to. "When the war ends" you should have said "When Isreal stops genociding the Palestinians of Gaza"
Clearly it is high time to figure out another location for a canal, the fact the stupid thing goes through a lake that is a drinking water source means it was only a matter of time before we hit this problem. I mean the canal was built with comparatively low-tech excavation and construction methods and we could build another far faster (and better) today than we did back then. If it were to be made a UN project resources from other countries could even be used to construct it. There are plenty of lines that can be drawn in that that do not cross inhabited areas or farm/cattle lands.  The Mexico proposal does sound promising and is exactly what I am talking about when I say we could build a better canal today, a canal built with industry in mind instead of just transit. Putting a couple rail lines along it would also speed up transport for anyone willing to simply transport containers to a dockyard and have it shipped via train to the other side and loaded on to another ship, this would speed up the flow of goods when the lines to use the canal get longer and provide an alternative for if maintenance has to shut down the canal temporarily.
Modern trade ships don’t sail.
Love the climate change activism going on with this channel. Ridiculous.
you talk a lot without saying anything
The rail corridor through Mexico seems the best.  The Panama Canal will still be needed by the US. Navy.  This scenario would mean that the US would likely take back control of the canal.  This would be better than seeing the canal be left to deteriorate and help sustain Panama.
Why are they not building storage for the water and re-using it? Not rocket science to save the water and solve the problem.
But why trucks and not a proper train system...
Wouldn't trains be a much better way to transport stuff in SA? Just imagine the HUGE amount of gas and repair cost of that ginormous infraestructure. As technology develops, I hope we go back to using trains, eletric ones.
Not that it could be done anytime soon but it sounds like Panama needs to take a good chuck of that money and start building a solution to get the ship up and down in elevation that doesn't require the loss of all their fresh water and allowing them to keep most of it for the population. I'd be looking for massive hydraulic lift designs using massive coastal wind and wave farms. Or massive skids and pully systems to tow the ships up.
Since the Pacific Ocean is higher than the Atlantic why don’t they build a gently sloping “aqueduct” from one ocean to the other and use sea water?
There are of course several ways to address this if there's enough willpower. Create new reservoirs, desalination, pump the water back rather than into the ocean. It all depends on price and political will.
"el-nino will last for years"... and also- they NEVER get the weather correct reliably beyond 3 days away.
This was interesting until you started mixing “lithium ion batteries” and “green” in the same sentence (22:45). Do some research on how much CO2 is output during li-ion battery production.
Hell yeah. Fuck the global economy
Why not dig another reservoir to reverse pump into or invest into nuclear desalination?
What if you pump the water in lock one through a declination plant then back into lock 3 or the lake? Seems like a easy fix.
I wouldn't let the Chinese build anything but a house of cards. Tofu dredge
That should give them a chance to clean up the trash in the lake
That's a stupid design,
@9:40  I took a picture at that exact location when I lived in Panama (family from there so I spend a semester in high school there). I feel like I took a great artistic shot as an 16 year old or the most touristy picture lol.  I took the picture in 2011 and the water level was the same, pretty sure. I believe your same about water level but use a picture from the dry season at the lake not the ocean.
Just dig another canal in that country or other central American country. We have enough inmates.
yawn.. 75% of this could have been covered in 10m flat.
Is it really too much effort to pump the water back up? Even if they can only pump half the water per ship it would mean they can take twice the ships with the same water...
Why not build pumping stations and pipelines to recycle the water when you can? Or go full Monte and pump seawater along the entirety of the right of way? Yes, it would be expensive. And there may be competition. Another canal is under consideration.
I can "fix" the Panama Canal.  Proposal 1  One of the earliest plans for the canal was a sea level crossing.  The expense of that plan got it rejected, and the existing canal was the winning proposal.  The costs of digging out the sea level crossing have fallen, and that plan could be revisited.  Proposal 2  Each crossing "costs" 52,000,000 gallons of water.  Stop it.  No seriously, stop it.  Two options for ending the use of water: 1 don't let gravity do the work.  Use pumps to pump the 52,000,000 gallons up from the lower level to the upper level (except maybe the top level, to reduce the salt contamination in the lake). 2 have a pool next to the lock.  Don't drain the water from above, or pump from below, but use a water pool per lock for the water source, and the pumping "costs" are reduced and the water source is maintained local to the lock.  This eliminates contamination, and reduces water use for minimal extra power.  Proposal 2 option 2 is the most practical, as it uses 100% of the existing canal, but with enhancements to limit water loss.  Proposal 1 is the most sustainable, with zero additional power use, and, all being sea level makes the maintenance easier, but would take the equivalent work of making an all new canal, just within the space of the current one.  I would do #2(2) to stabilize it now, and begin work on #1 for a more permanent solution.  But nobody asked me.  Unfortunately, I expect Panama will run the existing canal without improvements until dead, then wait for some other country to swoop in with trillions of dollars to fix it for them.  For doing nothing is always the easiest option.  It just usually results in failure.
Clickbait title. The economic value of the Panama Canal is so huge that the US would never allow it to fail. I'd say up to and including military intervention if Panama proved to be bad stewards.
At a minimum, I think we can all agree that isthmus is a very funny-sounding word.
need a better microphone
Don’t worry, Mexico 🇲🇽 just open the new connection in between Atlantic and the Pacific ocean. Easier, cheaper, faster and any sizes of ships can get their loads delivered on time.
As long as Islam exists there will be war in the Middle East, and not only that, but the Middle East will remain at war with the rest of the world. Islam is a totalitarian religion, it cannot exist alongside free peoples and will always seek to remove that freedom in favor of dogmatic control.
Clearly they need to build the fucking pump from the sea.
I wonder if Panama could potentially build a high-capacity freight railway along the route of the canal to offload some of the pressure on the canal (ships could either deload, cross the canal, and reload their cargo on the other side, or they could simply offload and another ship handle the rest of the route). The land and environmental demand would be significantly less than making new lakes, and it would reduce the water demand of the canal itself, which would keep it's viability for longer.  But there's probably some major geography reason why this is unfeasible
It is too bad they don't have access to an ocean or 2 to get water for the canal...
How about some wind energy to pump some sae water to  the needed water in the lower sections, not polluting the fresh water lake. Maybe some electrical energy from these ships could help pump the extra sea water. 🤔
2000 was the last year of the previous millennium. Not the start of the new one. There's no year 0.
I cant listen to these videos anymore with the crazy sped up voiceover. Go back to the old format.
Full control never should have been given to them after American dollars are what built it, should only have been shared.
"Since record keeping began back in the 1950's!  In other words, you have about 70 years worth of records, so this is pretty much just a 100 year low. You have approximately zero data.
Trucks? Why not build a railroad? It's faster and more economical than a highway with trucks. Less accidents, less employees plus railroads are safer when built and operated correctly. They use less fuel than trucks.
>invade a country to insure access to a canal >use canal to quickly and efficiently deploy your armed forces >Use armed forces to "acquire" reliable oil supplier >Emissions from the oil gets  canal dry
you guys never miss to mention how houthis are iran backed but somehow miss why they are doing what they are doing. makes it sound like some random act of piracy or terrorism
Bommetje er op en klaar
Someone should tell everyone in South America that lithium and other mining will destroy their country.
Regarding the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. I know almost nothing about this, but the numbers seemed weird so I googled a little bit. Since I don't know what I'm talking about, I tried to be as conservative as I could and base it off Panamax instead of NeoPanamax or whatever the ships wikipedia says can carry 20,000 TEUs are called. An article said the average ship is losing about 2,400 TEUs in capacity because of the restrictions. That sort of lines up with the 40% reduction mentioned in the video, for Panamax ships.  A Panamax ship can carry 5000 TEUs. Let's say that's reduced by half, because of restrictions, to 2500. The 1.4 million TEUs this railway can do eventually per year would be 560 ships or ~1.5 ships per day.  How is 1.5 ships a day better than even the massively reduced Panama Canal throughput of 18-24 ships per day? Is my math just wrong? Is it not counting TEUs but some other container size? Am I dumb? Does it have something to do with the fact that ships don't have to wait, just the cargo after it gets unloaded? Do ships only travel through the Panama canal during 2 months of the year?
The bi-oceanic corridor is going to look like Mad Max unless they intend on a constant military presence. Cool idea though. Hope it works out.
Why don't they just use salt water to raise and lower the ships and make a new lake that would be fresh water? I mean yeah it's going to take a lot of work but it would fix all the problems
Sounds like Panama needs to build a massive tunnel for smaller ships so they don't need locks for anything but the very large ships
Odd how they can have this issue for years, when the solution is so easy. Just have a buffer basin and pump the water back and forth between the levels.
Why don't they just pump in ocean water?
They are thinking too small. Should have built equivalents of the Yinjiangbuhan tunnel, and pump water from other lakes in Panama, e.g. Bayano lake, or build and artificial reservoirs for the rainfall.
America is such a backwards country to build a canal and give it away.
having been to panama and having family there. The country is a tourist state, the pay is abysmal and the costs are high. Being a local there sucks and you have to live with family unless you yourself work on the canal.
Why doesnt panama build desalination plants with all that money?
This doesn't mean it is "dying."  They just have to slow down traffic during dry times.  It's not the end of it, just a minor slowdown.  People may complain, but it definitely can keep functioning.
this is what perfect competition here will do with corrupt people in charge, average saving compared to going around south america will be $1 eventually
🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪
2:55 the panama canal was necessary to bully Cuba and create an embargo that destroyed it's economy in order to defend the opinion that communism is bad for the economy
"the war in the middle east will eventually come to an end..." lol ok.
Mexico is planning to open up their own canal between the 2 oceans. There will be no need for the  panama canal.
Why not keep it in a closed circuit? Instead of draining a freshwater lake then dumping it into the ocean, fill and drain a specific reservoir when you need to raise or lower the water level. Doesn't sound unreasonable.
Option 6: nuclear power plant and pumping the water back uphill...  Not so crazy when you realize that we already do this with pumped hydro storage. Look up Bath County Power Station.
I can't stand "YouTuber voice".   It's like a modern day valley girl.
You can forget any route through South America. The political instability and the rampant criminal elements all across the continent will absolutely destroy any validity of these projects. Wait and see.
So just pump the water back into the lake instead of draining it into the sea, problem solved.
A more disturbing question is why all equatorial countries poor/under developed?? And are immigrate to colder northern countries!!
Don’t worry, a few more years like this and we’ll have an ice free arctic to move trade through.
It's kinda surprising if Paraguay isn't building a railway instead of (or in addition to) its highway since freight trains are generally much more efficient than trucks and since we're talking about cargo going from coast to coast (rather than trucks taking different routes to different locations).
Add turbines to the lock leveling path, and capture the energy to power the pumps to pump the fresh water back into the lake. It won't be perfect, but it'll stop the water levels from dropping as quickly. Basically don't let any fresh water dump into either ocean.
If South America had a competent white government, they would have raised fees on globalists to use their passage. Maybe thats why they no longer have a competent government
What you didn't took in consideration, that south america's roads are plagued with THIEFS, once a friends package tracking read that the package was stolen. So good luck to drivers and safe travels.
Why are they using drinking water instead of seawater for the canal?
Reminder that they still have no idea what causes El Nino. We know what El Nino is, but they don't know why
Love LOVE ypur stuff man.   I stumbled across your channel about a month ago And it's quickly become my number one source for non-bias geopolitical facts and other tidbits of fascinating info.  A video a day at least. Im only halfway thru this vid so forgive me if  the answer shows up later but why can't they use salt water as opposed to fresh water in the locks?
Sounds more like an excuse to blather on about climate change.  If you change the pumping system and add a salt water reservoir on the inland side at each end you won't lose any water.  Also it doesn't take climate change to change weather patterns.  This isn't rocket science.
*way to ignore the reason they're blocking the straight*
INB4 the US rolls into Panama and takes the Canal back over, citing "mismanagement" and "strategic asset".
Ah the power  of weather control.
No mention of why the Houthis are fighting huh? Free Palestine.
The dry spell will end much sooner than the war in the Middle East. Stop pushing the climate bullshit.
oh no..... a chinese company wants to build something? rip. gonna fall apart in 5-10 years...
30:50 oh hey, it’s my tio’s best friend.
Almost all of the alternatives so many people mention, rail, the roads, etc all have two big downsides in common.   There has to be another ship waiting on the other side to continue the journey. The shipping company needs to double the number of ships they have. They are not going to just eat the cost of doubling their infrastructure.   More importantly, this will absolutely obliterate the economy of Panama. If people think the border crisis is bad now, just wait until 4.3 people try to cross all at once.
Freedom for Palestine
It’s Cuz’ Carter sold it to the Chinese - period.
It might be that adding reservoirs for each lock, with the millions upon millions $$ Panama take as "bribes", would resolve many issues.  Allowing Panama to allow more ships to pass through and make more money.
Wonder why honduras was not mentioned since they are building a land canal between the two port they have.
the Middle East thing would end if we just stoped all trade and demanded out allys also stop trading with them starve them into compliances
Stop lying about climate change since the climate changes all the time
Why is there always hate, violance, terror and sorrow everywhere the islam is present?
I've been watching this just thinking "i bet lake Gatun has some good fishing"
are we gonna ignore why yemen is doing what it is doing?
It's not dying. Corporate interest doesn't control it like a monopoly so they create/hire hustlers to project it a loss.  I do not trust channels like this one. Every upload they do is purposed to skew real life into fabricated fantasy.
2:33 The new millennium started on January 1, 2001.
Sounds like a US problem
Hmmmm will the panamian government allocate the lake's water towards a multi-million dollar source of revenue that falls towards the pockets of government officials daily and without them needing to declare? Or will it give it to its citizens for their basic necessities and survival? Hmmmmmmmmmmm Looks like theyre gonna have to start rationing water or leave the country ASAP
5:50 aren't all boat elevators made this way?
Just pump the water in the locks  back to the lake instead of to the ocean
I understand that right now the whole system works with just gravity.... But could they not build water towers just for filling and emptying the locks and pump the water? So they wouldn't contaminate their existing resevoirs.  Or would the electricity needed for pumping the water and the extra time needed for it make this unrentable?
They upgraded the canal and not the water supply.
The Houthis were the only ones with the balls and integrity to take action against genocide.
Or they could just dig it up at sea level. And before someone says it, I know they first tried to dig it sea level, but too many people were dying because it was too big of a feat to achieve, it's 2024 and there's nothing we can't do. It's going to be expensive, and again, hard to do, but it's future proof. At the tallest point, the canal will be just 26m tall, while we have cargo ships over 60m tall.  And there wont be any ecological disaster because none of the species in the lake are indigenius. Everything in it has been introduced artificially.
I love how the problem of eastbound US west coast based and westbound US east coast based trading has to be solved somewhere else instead of within the US with their 'Manifest Destiny' railway.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU AND HE DIED FOR OUR SINS?
it would be really expensive to pump up the water from lower lock to the second just to recycle water instead of throwing it into the ocean but losing a lake would be permanently disasterous
whys the audio so shit
Simply move production closer to where the goods will be consumed. But that means less revenue for the multinationals. So it's not doable.
Lol, he said climate change. This sucks
New millennium didn't start until January 1, 2001.
The hoothi have fired dozens of missiles and drones at trade ships traveling in and out of IOF controlled ports with the demand to allow medical supplies and food into Gaza. Dont make it sound like they are just doing terrorist shit for no reason. The Hoothi would stop if supplies were allowed into Gaza.    do fucking better. Free Palestine.
junk pumps, lots and lots of junk pumps ... so dont dump it back into the ocean .. yet I get that salt will increase in the lake but .;. whatchya gonna do
I hear china is there
The bi-oceanic corridor doesn't seem like it will be particularly worthwhile as a replacement for foreign trade. You will have to spend a few more days traveling to it, a few days unloading, days traveling, days loading back up, and then days to get back to your travel path. I don't think it will be useful for bypassing either direction, as it will likely cost a ton to do any of the 3 options.  The local trade is what I would say changes the most. If it removes some 20% of the throughput through Panama, that is a massive change that helps Panamas wait time, while allowing more quick and efficient trade from west and east coasts of South America.  Railway probably only makes sense for ultra high priority stuff. A shipment of XYZ product that needs to get to ABC location in 3 weeks, but is too large for plane travel. But even then, a high speed rail might not be able to handle something that large either.
Can someone explain to me why the ship is sent up and then down rather than going straight? Can't the river be diverted to somewhere else and then the panama canal is only connected to the ocean? I can only think of the sea level water flooding the canal but can't the structure be built higher?
NEEDS AN ANSWER WHY DYING THE CANAL ????????
the solution is the united states should pay for the construction of desalination plants in exchange for something or another having to do with the canal.
Is it technically possible to pump the water back to the lakes instead of the ocean?  Keeping the water level at check espescially during the dry season. Definitely a clolossal project to execute but worth trying.
The middle east has been at war in one form or another for 3000 years. What a bonehead statement.
Amazing! The weather changes hence Climate Change. WOW !! It used to be called Global Warming but the SCIENCE gets to change everything they believe when its convenient huh.
They should work out a way to return the water to lakes once used by the canals
Nicaraguan canal is dead in the water for now as head guys in jail in china now i believe
No mention of the mexican port to port rail and port system being built as we speak
Why no mention of why they started shooting at shipping in yemen? Palestine was theyre stated reason  if my memory serves  hmmm
Anyone who thinks panama owns the canal is drinking the bath water😅
Hey man. Please fix your audio. It is clipping so much I literally had to click off and watch a diff video
No accurate. For over 100 years they never had to pump water, they used the lake water. The original engineering was perfect. They enkarged the canal. 10 years ago, since then they have had problems.. It's nothing to do with climate.
Common evidence points to the fact that rising global changes in temperatures are due to global cooling. Naturally, as is a part of the ice age cycle on earth, we are currently hitting the high point. Within a few years, temperatures will plumate and freeze the entire northern hemisphere along with the south. The canal will be useless if theres no one left to use it.
bro fix your mic
Very educational. Great watch
FYI, AMLO finish the Mexican one it's if I'm not mistaken working already or about to looks great do.
This idea of transferring from ship to train and then back to ship added major costs, historically. But the switch to shipping containers changed things. The costs of transferring cargo from ship to rail and back are far lower than they used to be.
i think you skipped the northern passage lol
Climate change will soon make the northern passage a feasible option.
Climate change is real, and it's starting to seriously fuck shit up.
They should fill the canal with sewage from the cities  instead of fresh water. Or fill it with sea water.
One more reason Jimmy Carter was a terrible PotUS
"The cause of the breakdown is more natural" - ah yes, nothing more natural in the world than man-made climate change at lightning speed
All through the video: "The Panama Canal is dying due to climate change".  17:00:  "The problem in the Panama Canal can only be solved either by waiting it out or by spending years and a lot of money building new infrastructure projects ..." And that's the problem right there.
1/4 of the water  used in the locks could be pumped back using the energy from the gravity of the water flowing out.   1/4 recovery would and could be all that is needed.   More would require more energy.... which is not that difficult to come by.   This is a political and control issue... not a natural disaster issue.  Excuses, excuses, excuses....
Sounds like they need to use all that money they're making from it to improve it's engineering. If they are able to.
China suddenly invade China? Because Taiwan is the part of China. You hear what you say? Or you are just US brainwashed bot?
🎶I bless the rains down in Panama🎶
So time to invest in that rail infrastructure in the US and update how companies move cargo from continental north America.
22:40 - yeah, no it doesnt have that % of the worlds lithium - almost all of it is in seawater and its near-economically extractible from there...  That % of land based lithium reseves, maybe...
Water consumption per passage could be reduced by about 1/3 by driving the water from an emptying lock through a turbine, couple to a pump, pumping about 1/3 of the water spent back into the lake.  This design would even be further improved, by an optimal combination of turbines and pumps, to save more than 1/3 of the water. I haven't run the numbers, but I am pretty sure that the investment required by such systems could be quickly retrieved through a 50% higher throughput in drought times, given the hefty fees that shipping companies are ready to pay.  A quarter-million dollar bribe to cut the queue could rather be invested in such a system, generating several million dollars PER DAY!   More than enough to pay for the most sophisticated of pumping system! Having said this, the problem might not be technical... but rather one of corruption!  That is a problem a mere engineer like me is unable to solve!
As for the Mexican rail idea, great idea, but at the age of over 70, will I be around to see it completed? I'd love to see Panama, and Suez get back to normal. I'd also like to see all trade get back to normal. Those against capitalism won't like that comment....but too damned bad. I'm a conservative, it's my duty to hope for a commonsense return to trade. Commonsense, something the left could never comprehend even if it hit them in the face like a wet fish..lol.
Surely lighter ships would need more water, not less?  The level still needs to meet the ocean or lake, but a heavy ship would take up more of that waters volume by displacement?
I was there a few months ago.  It's not at all dying.  It has too much business.  HUGE difference.
One is inclined to think that running the Panama canal have become complacent. They knew drought would be a problem, but didn't do anything in advance to try fix the problem.
"the so called South Cone" lol said someone from the so called "united" so called "states"
Why can't they use pumps to pump sea water between the gates instead? This will lower the reliance on the fresh lake water. It will require energy to operate, but it can also generate back some of the electricity when discharging the water. It may also slow down the time required for filling each section, but it could be like an "emergency" solution, for times when necessary.
Воды в этом видео хватило бы для панамского канала на годы вперёд
This february in Los Angeles, it was one of the wettest ever recorded. I live in the deserts of Southern California, and we received two and a half times our normal february rainfall. And it's not done raining.
“Sea levels are rising due to climate change”……….lol
I don't see the problem here , instead of dumping the water into the ocean at gate 1 , Panama should dig a temporary reservoir and dump the water into it , then pump it back again to gate 1 when needed. The water from the lakes should only compensate the quantity of water lost in the process.
This problem could have been partially solved, if only the US had working train infrastructure to facilitate easy transport throught the country.  Then you wouldn't need to ship as much stuff coast to coast. an
Too optimism for the Middle East, and too pessimism for the weather of Panama.
Pump the locks water back to the lake duh
My solution to this would probably be costly but allow for them to use less freshwater and that is to one invest in filtration systems for fresh drinking water for the population and start to use sea water to raise and lower the ships how they may pull it off it beyond me but thats all i can come up with as a person with a high school diploma
I remember why I stoped watching this channel. Leaving out key details are just frustrating to watch.
Why not pump the water from the bottom of the canal back to the top? Why not empty that water into the lake at the top of the canal instead of into the ocean? Surely most of the water could be recovered?
Who the fuck builds roads and not railways for that amount of cargo? What a massive waste of resources.
Ya know. I'm surprised that they haven't gotten heavy heavy industrial pumps to pump salt water through the locks or pump the lake water to the top instead of emptying out into the ocean.  Edit: Specifically, have pumps that take water in to the low level and pump it to the higher levels. This is a 'just in case scenario' for this exact situation.
Canal 2.0, dig out the US-Mexico border
Or, hear me out.... Desalination facilities to pump water from the ocean, treat it, then refill the fresh water reserves?
why not reduce the amount of fresh water usage in the panama canal by pumping sea water into the first and second locks? or is there a reason why that cant be done?
Screw Taiwan.
it was kinda dumb to design the Panama Canal to run through the lakes. it means they can't pump the canal with salt water. or at least not the stretch of the canal that runs through the lakes. It probably wasn't the geopolitically healthiest thing to give the territory independence from the federal government. Now they got no mommy and daddy to run to for help when the absurdly expensive canal we left them with breaks down. the solution is kinda simple, they gotta build the other half of the Panama Canal. the half Roosevelt cheated building by running it through the freshwater lakes. they gotta build new channels that don't run through the freshwater sources. it was sorta ecological vandalism. or they can give up the lakes and just pump saltwater in them too. they'll have to find a way to subsidize the loss of the fresh water resource; but the money gained from running the canal at full capacity may be enough to buy a solution.
I have no idea why, definitely possible that it's my fault on my end, but the audio on this episode is terrible. Last vid that I watched didn't sound this way though, keep up the great work!
Is it impossible for them to reengineer the canal so it doesn't waste all of the water to begin with? I can't imagine that's too expensive of a prospect given the alternative.
In 24 years Panama has spent nothing on restoring and renovations.  They need to get busy.  No more foreign aid, recall the US military and secure our borders. Time to be a isolationist nation.
What a funny channel and video talking about invading other countries on other continents like it is their main goal rather than fixing their healthcare system and resolving homeless problem for example just to mask for the whole world that actually they are degrading 😂
Why not consider use seawater in the canal system
Talk above the trip from east coast to east Asia via bottom of South America.   Why not go around bottom of Africa and go east
I have watched a few documentary videos about building the Panama Canal.  I remember that rain was a hindrance for creating landslides
"The effects of climate change get worse" or whatever....bullshit. Water use, increased use of the canal and population growth. There's your problem. The video even acknowledges this. El Ninos have been happening for centuries.
I'm wondering, why not pump sea water into the locks, rather than use the fresh water?  Of course, those would be huge pumps, and require lots of energy, but surely that would be preferable to running out of fresh water for your citizens?  Plus, they could likely devise clever means of reusing the water for the return (downhill) trip.  Certainly this has been considered, it just seems like an obvious solution, which means there's a good reason why it won't work. lol
free palestine
free palestine
Isn’t there kinda an easy fix for this? Why not just put a large storage tank at the end of the last lock. This prevents the fresh water discharge into the ocean. Then have a set of pumps that pump the water from the storage tank through a filtration system, and back into the lake. Thus preventing all those gallons of freshwater from desalinating the oceans, and puts fresh water back into the lake.
One of President Jimmy Carter's greatest accomplishments was negotiating the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which were ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1978. These treaties gave the nation of Panama eventual control of the Panama Canal.   Unintended consequence of the liberal mind.... China now controls the canal....
Since America built this canal why do we have to pay a fee? Why would Carter give away such value.
why the FUCK wouldnt they pump from the ocean?! ITS FKN INFINITE! Sure, letting gravity do all the work is cost-effective, but come on....talk about short-sighted.
A few more years, and the arctic ocean will warm enough to make the northern routes passable year round. It look longer on a map but saves thousands of miles.
THE AUDIO 💀💀💀
Why are you talking about the bi-oceanic corridor using trucks? It is mostly a railway project. The highway is important but trucks are way less effective as cargo transport.
The US is not a big fan of trains
“cLimATe chANgE iSnT REaL, iT snoWED tHiS yEaR aND it’S CoLd”
Why not actively pump sea water to control the water level in the locks? Sure, it would have a higher energy cost. But it would save drinking water.
Lithium isnt going to go east, lets keep it real The US hasnt decided if climate change is real yet, and Europe is busy protecting Mercedes and BMW to keep building gas engines  All the lithium will go west.
Ohhh Biden fkd up again. Trump would have kept control.
They are now projecting a La Nina starting in a couple months. Calma
YOU TAL TOO FAST. ENOUGH INFORMATION. THANK YOU
I wonder if they could bypass the water problem by attaching secured inflatable airpacks at the bottom of the airlocks. You only need to increase the water level by displacing the water. Currently they're displacing the water with water; you could displace it with more mechanical means such as decreasing the surface area by pushing in the walls or pushing the floor up. I wonder if the solution could be solved by pumping in air to large balloons at the bottom of the locks. This would move the water up (only if properly secured). The air could then be deflated to move the water level back down. It would be energy intensive to pump in the air or other substance, but it wouldn't require water to be pumped in and out.
Simple solution just make everything domestically.
Climate change is just a hoax.
Why is the freshwater not put back into the Lakes?
The Suez Canal should be brought back under British ownership.
quick google search each lock uses about 48 mil gal of water. qatar build a tank that hold 115 mil gal of water. assuming all the water of fist lock needs to be pumped back to the last, which is an over estimation, it can be moved to a 48 mil gal tank and then pumped to the last lock. i worked somewhere that has pumps with 6000 hp motors and had over 1000 ft of head easily. none of this would be cheap or fast but it can be done and used in drought situations. in use times the pumps can be can to recover some of water and to keep things from sitting unused for a long time.
Serious question. Why is rail a poor choice for connecting east and west coast of USA? As a ship->train->ship transition is a potential solution. There must be some important reason it's not even considered in this video (load/unload times?)
Rocket money washing
Why can't panama diversify. Build their own rail an system from one side to the other and build up the freight yards like the mexico plan.
They did not plan ,God has the best plan
there will be sabotage by US if it does not get kickbacks
Corruption came spread the world
i love tug boats 😭
There is no drought today in Panama.  The Canal has plenty of water. -Someone who actually lives in Panamá.
cant they just use ocean water to "pump" into the canal? Obv gravity is making it difficult but wouldnt that just work?
Here's a solution to the Panama canal.. how about the east coast goes to Europe and the west coast goes west? Now pay me my millions
Meanwhile California is being deluged by record rainfall. Everything seems to be out-of-sinc with earth’s norms.  So … keep telling me there’s no climate change 🤬
Seems like they need to do some redesigning of the water piping system of the Canal to alter where the water in the first lock is dumped. IE, instead of dumping into the ocean, recirculating the water back up to the lake.
UM... why not make a holding tank on both oceans sides with all the billions of dollars and not put the fresh water into the ocean but out into public water use treatment facilities???? WTF this seems like you are wasting fresh water for no reason.
So basically it is a must we - not americans - close this shit so US stop pestering everyone else. Thanks for the information
Well anyone who has the slightest idea about China, knows they are not going to invade. Most likely the whole situation will escalate by indirect taunting of US. Just like they did with Russia
Gooooo Mexico!!!!!
Why don’t they just pump sea water instead?
If anyone here ever feels dumb, just remember there are people who see this unusual change in climate caused by rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns that say with a straight face that there is no change in climate.  Istfg we're devolving back into stupid shit flinging monkeys as a species.
An issue that well designed water pump system to use sea water will solve.
Your mic audio is clipping majorly, pal. Just an FYI.
why dont they open a real canal where terrain is more suitable? its madness to use fresh water for ships
Had it not being for the record breaking stupidity of the Bolivian Goverment, the bi-oceanic corridor project would be way more developed, but no, Bolivia had to choose an ileterate dingleberry for a president that puts politics before everything else, the same guy that is now accused of drug traffic and trying to get back the president seat by force.
As always this channel seems to regurgitate American military industrial compelx propaganda...   Panama canal will be replaced, then dug out to be a true canal, so it doesn't rely on water locks. The flow of commerse will just make it so, and because we can do more today, there is no reason for a new modern mega project.
Born too early to die in a war in the Middle East, born too late to die in a war in the Middle East, born just in time to die in a war in the Middle East...
Why don't they have a water reserve they can re dump in the lake after?
Panama Canal Authority taking a page out of Disney's book and offering "Fastpass" 🤣
Do we keep letting ships through or keep letting our citizens have water to drink? Tough decision ngl
Where is all rain? Not raining in mexico, Europe, Brasil, panamá?
I thought the video was speed up
I miss the rains down in Panama.
We can just pump the water back up. The drought is a problem. But there are workarounds solutions.
i think all canal problems would be solved if they just make the canal deeper. deep enough to not need those ship elevators anymore. while excavating twenty something meters of ground along the entire nearly 200km long canal is certainly a huge project, especially if its done while the canal is actively used, it would solve all future water issues for the country. well, unless they face a multi year long drought of course, but that is something should make plans for anyways.
I'm glad Panama owns the Panama canal now, because if the United States still owned it, I feel like we probably would have rationed drinking water instead of canal crossings.
You missed a new route opening up due to climate change. The article circle. Now that it’s melting faster than it can freeze ships are taking the route over the North Pole, which was unheard of until recently.
if bioceanic corridor solves any problem why there is no such ground corridor in Panama 🤔
I can only suppose that the canal is used more then at the start. Meaning that there is much more water used. We humans often build something that doesn't work as planned, blaming climate change alone is much to easy... The ships themselves are putting much crap in the ocean because us dumb humans think economy is top priority..  Buy less crap = less shipping = less water needed in the artificial lakes.. Just buy less crap is good for the economy and nature all at ones.
Sounds like they need to install pumping stations and work with a captive water supply to progressively fill the above locks instead of just letting it out into the ocean...
But why dont they pump sea water into the canal instead of drinking water? Its not like the ships dont go through this usually. Is it because pumping sea water is not possible with systems like that?
So "Globalization" doesn't work.  Maybe countries like the United States should manufacture it's own goods, instead of buying cheap goods from China?
Why couldn't they deepen the canal to ocean level and thereby eliminate the locks? How far down would they need to dig?  And widen it for bigger ships...  Cheaper than the alternatives?
Makes a 36 minute video on the Panama Canal.  Doesn't know how the Panama Canal operates.  Supposed to believe the rest of the video with such a fundamentally colossal error.
fuck youtube man lolk, watched for 7 minutes and realized has still on the "blabbering about history" phase
Isn't there a sixth alternative? Global warming has begun melting Northern Canada, so I want to say they're doing feasibility on a northern water route too.
As a Winnipegger, this is great news!
Surprising that no one seems to be considering the Ring of Fire around the Pacific which could easily affect most of the near-coastal areas in the west of the western hemisphere.
I'm telling you!!! Build the Cal/Tex Express Canal from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Coast  through Texas, NM, AZ, CA. Make it 2 huge lanes 1 west & 1 east with enough extra space for several ships; X-Large, Large, a couple Medium & several small vessels, including Emergency & Guard Vessels. Don't lower & raise the water in each lock for only 1 or a couple vessels.
Climate Change = FAKE NEWS
Misleading when you talk about the effect of the drought on lake Gatun and show video footage of the banks of the Pacific coast at low tide. The skyscrapers of Patilla are seen in the background.
Everything on this channel keep blowing my mind.
No le crean a AMLO
Brazilian crops fail in the last season video?
how impossible it is to fucking pump oceanic water instead of the lake's, dude just change gate 1 and 2 to salt water and use the other for leveling just to the lake. sugary sweet drinkable water is for life not for fucking boat leveling 😭😭😭😭🤧😭
"but everything changed when they both nuked the North Pole"
I’m surprised Ticketmaster hasn’t taken over the canal
Don't ever forqet that Pabama was part of Colombia until US corrupt politicians stoled it to take control over the future canal.
I don't want to be that guy, but the Panama Canal moves water with the help of gravity and not with water pumps.
There's also the possibility of using freight trains in the US, particularly for those Asia-East Coast and Europe-West Coast shipments. Imagine if we actually got serious about leveraging the freight train industry for the betterment of our country rather than for the benefit of a few monopolies.
on the bright side, climate change might lead to the North-West passage becoming viable
What's up with the audio sounding like you're in a box in this one?
What about solar/batteries/pumps? Just pump the water back up to the lake? I’m sure it’s expensive but at a GDP impact of 6B spending 500m/1B on pumping seems good.
"Around 40% to be precise."  Just gotta say, if you use the word 'around', you're not being precise. Just say, "around 40%."  "... Which is about precisely the same length that the Suez canal is."  Another example. Look into these words "precise and precisely."
It won't die, mark my words, as long the US needs it, they will use it, if they can't use it anymore, they destroy it ~ 🍺
Why doesn't Panama just dig a brand new channel, without the use of thoselakes? That way it would not use any fresh water. It could connect two oceans on the same height. Is it that expensive? Egypt and USSR somehow dug up even bigger channels, so why wouldn't Panama do it?
YOU GO AROUND THE HORN THE WAY GOD INTENDED
Simple f* solution... - pump water back into the sweet water containers (not to the sea) - cause originally you're not really "pumping" water from the higher reservoir to the lower, you're just using a natural pressure (at cheap) for levels to equalise; Pumping back up with actually mean an expenditure of energy (so money); but hey...
Annnd this is absolute bullshit
If it's so important and profitable, why did the US give it up? Could use pumps to recycle the lock water.
so serious question here, why not just use salt water on the panama canal? why do you need fresh water? like i get it ideally fresh water is better on equipment, but in this situation wouldnt it be easier and more efficient to pump salt water into the first and last gate? and use fresh water on the last two?
Put a water pump Infrastructure for the bottom part of the cannal with a water treatment plant for the drinking purpose, problem solved
What if the dumped water was just pumped into storage and such for human use instead of into the ocean?
its almost... like... the consequences of our incessant unsustainable consumption and addiction to growth.... is catching up to us. oh noooooo.....
So simple solution reverse the direction of flow from the pumps have the first lock pull ocean water. It will atleast hold until a better solution can be implemented.
I mean yeah it matters for the US Navy sort of but between Coronado and Pearl harbor, pt mugu to an extent I guess, on top of the carrier groups that they already have in the Middle East, China is very aware that the resoonse would be quite rapid. and besides, they aren't really in the societal position internally to start waging a war because there are people aren't exactly big fans of the government at the moment.
Desalination. No one ever considers this cause it’s an ongoing cost. But so is maintaining infrastructure.
It was planned that the Bioceanic corridor go through Bolivia too. But our government just listens to the Socialist part of the people. And bc they think all the problems that have the country and the world in general is bc the Imperialism and Globalism, we won't have this titanic project that could solve our import-export problems bc we don't have a coast and we have to pay almost the double/triple of any imported products. And the problem is getting worse now that the gov. decided to stopped the free buy of USA dollars in the country, now the importers have to pay more bc everyone wants to buy dollars and no one have them and this elevated the price of it.   It is always nice to live in Latam and more in one with a Socialist gov that "just wants to help to the people" but in reality just helps to the ones that are dumbass and believe their shit 👍
The video  title is wrong. Two points in the world to control inflation.
I was thinking why not use pumps to move the water back up to the lake but then I did some napkin math. Turns out to pump the water used for a single ship would be something like 13MWh of energy.
Maybe I missed this part, I know it can't be as simple as pumping the water back, but why is that not a feasible option?
What war in the middle east?  The religious one thats been going on forever I like to call that one the Infinity war.  Other then that what country is officially at war with any country in the middle east?  I haven't heard of any besides isriel and gaza.  But that wasn't what was pointed at in this.  So again what country outside of the middle eastern coutries have declared war?     Unless he is talking about the war on terroisum.  But he wasn't very clear on this point.  But even that is a streach.  With the pulling out of afghanistan. (And disaster that was).  Was the end to that campainge.    So once again what war is he refuring to?
Jimmy Carter knew. He had to. 4D chess to squeeze as much out of the canal as was possible before it was a huge problem.
dude fix your mic
If the goal is to get shipping containers from coast to coast, why would you build roads for trucks instead of rails for trains? Each truck can only move 1 or two containers where the trains can move hundreds.  Trucks are for distribution from arteries not the arteries of travel themselves.  Plus, since there would be very few stops for the train, it would be one of the best candidates for high speed rail.
Would it be possible to pump the water from the bottom lock back up to the lake instead? Obviously, this would cause an increase in pumping costs, but it would have to be cheaper than the cost of the lake drying up during a drought.
>the war in the middle east eventually comes to an end< dude they are muslims, they will never end fighting for whatever obscure reason there is
Why dont they just use seawater to lift the waterlevel, why freshwater?
Why doesn’t Panama just build a rail line next to the canal?
They better chill before Coca-Cola starts launching nukes
The audio on this video is garbage.
Why can’t they just dig out the camel so both sides are sea level? No more lock needed.
This video is complete trash, just answer the question?
Route is not a homonym of rout. Vessels have been routed from the strait by the Houthis, but they've been routed around Africa. Learn it, Americans, please.
This seems idiotic, why isn`t the same water just being recycled through the system !!! Have another dock at the side of the Entry/Exit point, that is simply used to dump and bring the water back into the system.
i feeel like you spend most of the video ignoring the fact that man made climate change is respoonable you use words and phrases that give of the idea this is something nothing can be done about, like "climate change just happen and will disrupt the panama canal, who knows why" you really missed the main point with this video.
Seems like an opportunity to update infrastructure.  Adding a channel through the lake for boat traffic where seawater could be transferred without damage to the freshwater in the lake seems like it would be a good investment.
Why not pump seawater into the locks? Because it’ll mix with the fresh water lake?
Lousy jimmy Carter This is why you NEVER vote for a democrat
Ok ok, it's vital,  we get that, we already know this. Please get on with it.
Ah yes, the yet another reason for prices to hike up. Greed is what kills this planet. :)
Did you record this using a inline earbud mic or something? Sounds ... bad.
I’m confused about how you can be so aware of geopolitical activities and still think that green energy is a viable option going into the 21st century. The amount of fossil fuels it takes to mine the lithium is hilariously large.
Government choosing letting the people have their drinking water over profit with the canal is very optimistic even by this channel’s standards
Reported for scam.  I'm five minutes in and nothing about why the Panama Canal is dying.  I didn't click for a lesson on history I got before your dad's balls had dropped.
Not to mention that traveling around Cape Horn takes you through some of the most turbulent ocean on the planet.
15:30
damming up more rivers and making more reservoirs is more like passing on the ball then solving the problems, as those will also run out eventually, at least imo.
Pretty sure road freight is not the answer to anything
Panama should have never been given back the canal
Simple solution is to make the lakes into saltwater inland seas by using ocean water.
Typical American, let's build roads no not railway than can carry more goods in less time and needs less maintenance, bloody roads.
All those cross country train & truck rout proposals through South America & the southern tip of Mexico would be longer & more costly in fuel and time then doing the same along side of the Panama Canal. Something to think about for a un-rainy day. Am I missing something?
Give me 4 billion a year I’ll did a new one sea level all the way 1 mile wide
So... is there a reason the water can't be recycled? The water on ordinary canal locks comes from the canal itself. You just move it back and forth between locks. Am I being stupid? Is this not done to stop salt water flowing into the freshwater lake?
The reason is that the US gave the Canal back and should not have done so. If the Canal was still owned and completely managed by the US, it would have been retrofitted and expanded to keep up with demand. That is no knock on Panama but the US built the canal and has the means to modernize it as well as the incentive to do so. They would have come up with an alternative way to move the water by now. Some kind of system to reuse the water each time could be devised. Or perhaps some other method. Not a popular opinion I know.
Why is fresh water used in the water leveling process? Why can't they use sea water?
Panama is a different country 😮
my ears are bleeding
I vote  make a new canal through the rio grand doubles as a border moat and creates us/Mexican jobs n would aslo unit us more
I know it won't happen because people suck but theoretically couldn't a solution be to just retain the water instead of dumping it into the ocean? Then either pump it back to the top, or, if that's too energy intensive, use it for local agriculture that way the water is at least retained in the ecosystem and can cycle naturally
There is no such thing as 4 point thirty two. It's 4 point three two.
We produce pump out 25 million gallons of salt water from an aquifer a few hundred feet deep and desalinate it through high pressure reverse osmosis filters a day. It requires 8x 200 hp electric motors. They would likely need 500 such pump motors to deal with the logistics of this issue, basically just call it 1MW of energy per hour when you factor in elevation and other loss, although it could be a lot less with clever engineering. You would need at least a small power plant, to deal with the pump issues. You could recharge the lakes with filters, but the hypersalinated water would need to be ejected in the lowest lock and could have environmental issues on the coast.
Only partway through, but wouldn't the solution be to pump in sea water instead of fresh water?
If only we could figure out how to pump the water used back to the reservoir it came from instead of sending it away too bad pipes are one way only
Crazy that they allow ships to sail right through their fresh water source
Can someone explain to me how does cutting down the number of ships going through the canal decreases water usage?   Id assume the opposite would reduce water usage since more ships would displace more water so youd need to pump in less water to raise them.
Getting sick of "Climate Change" - It's called "Weather" and there are natural weather cycles at work. Quit pushing the human-caused guilt trip of CC... We are all tired of it. Everyone knows CC is about tax and spend economics...
Liar. You conveniently neglected to mention that the Panama Canal was recently widened, doubling the Panama Canal's water usage. You also conveniently neglected to mention that El Niños are driven by solar cycles which dictate that roughly every 50 years there will be historic droughts in the Panama region.   Climate change my ear.
I've came across this video and a video about wirtz pump after. Now, I'm thinking of using the pump design to get water from the ocean to fill canals, instead of from the lakes. The wirtz is perfect for transporting water from low to high levels. IDK am crazy
Climate change is a scam. The wayet level is gping down because its being lost. Once we get more rain it will go back up
And this is why we are melting the arctic. Much shorter trip from china to the east coast, and no bottle neck of a canal. Just open waters. Only problem is we have to melt all the stupid ice. I hear less than 50 years and those waters may open up.
China will soon own the canal
Trump could fix it. Democrats cant. We never should have given away the panama canal. It ran fine when the us owned it begore the 70s. When democats gave it away Our gov is insane
One of the reasons i felt stupid when a previous government approved a mining project that definitely compromised our water attractive power from atmosphere.   If our biggest business is water..then who could be such a moron to put an environmental bomb here...and very close to the canal.
how much of the "rain forest" has been cut down that is actually the true reason for the loss of the rains? rather than stuipd "climate change" excuses that we hear non-stop from people too lazy to look at real solutions for these type of events?
@2:52  Washington enforced the naval blockade on Cuba?  Don't you mean Kennedy?
I love growing up and experiencing countless "unprecedented" and "once-in-a-lifetime" events. :)  Thank you older generations and politicians!
It saddens me how stupid Latin American governments are. I understand why building a "canal" was the best idea back in the early XX century, but at this point in time it's just such a stupid idea. We have enough machinery to load and unload a cargo ship in just a few hours and they could be taken fron the Pacific to the Atlantic in less than a day through railways, which would also be super cheap and can even be good for the environment. Instead of building the infrastructure for that, they want 700 km of roads, 200 km of digging. Jesus Christ. The Americas are just a lost cause at this point. Here in México, AMLO is pushing huge railway projects focus on promotion tourism through the most cartel infested lands in the country, but he wants to dig 200 km of land to make a canal through the itsmus of Tehuantepec. Such stupidity and incompetence is plain disgusting.
some wealthy company or government will find a solution they can just level a mountain or something or make a new conal they did it 100 year ago they can do it again
"Times of crisis" the nicest way of white-washing our colonial empire activities.
This video about the canal is very instructive on USA...
I'm only halfway through this and I can't watch it anymore, because I can't stand to hear more about the incompetence that has gone into not preparing for this eventuality and believe me they had certain contingencies involved back in the seventies for this kind of event and they tried to explain it might happen but they didn't want to listen, and that's part of the problem a lot of this could have been so prevented if they had bothered to do certain contingencies and I remember hearing about them mostly because I was a little kid who used to eavesdrop on what the big adults had to say they never really noticed me I was good at being invisible when it suited me. People are often that way if it ain't broke the saying goes don't fix it... Even if it's dangling by a thread it's still ain't broken so don't fix it, most people who might be reading my comments I hope they understand that I am doing this with voice to text because my hands do not work properly anymore and I have no other way of putting down what I want to say this just saddens me too much and I just I can't I can't watch an old friend die in such a miserable way when it could have all been prevented.
Maybe i'm dumb but isn't there an option to pump the water from the bottom lock back to the top instead of just venting to the ocean? higher energy cost, lower water cost?
And this is what happens when you let the Panamanian government takeover something that was running like a clock before, by the way just so you know some of that water that is supposed to be drinking water for the civilian population is actually being used for things like pools and Gardens and other things that are not necessary and yet they don't do any form of conservation which is what they did before they let the Panamanian government take everything over. This was predicted in 1976 before the canal treaty was signed, and it has more to do with the fact that they watched them they observed them when they were going to make the treaty to see how they were behaving and how they were doing things and they found so many flaws that certain people predicted that this mess was going to happen, and it did. Believe it or not this was predicted back in 1976 well 75/76 that if the canal was turned over because they were not paying as much attention as they should be they tried to explain to them there's certain things they might have to do that they might have to fill the canals water supply specifically gatun lake but they weren't really paying much attention and they were not listening I know this because I used to listen into the conversations of the adults around me and I remember hearing some of the people in the administration of the canal talking over with a family member of mine whose job it is to listen to people I will not go into what his actual job was but that's another story and not important the point is I listened in and what I heard made me come to the conclusion that what they were worried most about was that they would not do the job properly and why because they were already being sloppy with some of the simplest things they had to do like for example the mules that that's what they're called those little train thingies that take you from take the ship from one end to the other I mean they're literally holding on to the ropes to make sure that the ship is it goes up he's pulled along you know to the next lock the point being that they were already a bit on the lazy side with how they dealt with it and there had been some problems and they were worried when it came to the lake that they would not monitor and take care of the lakes the way they were supposed to be taking care of you see there was a lot of things done to keep the lakes in good working order and yes there have been times when there were droughts there were things that had to be done to keep them from trying to to lower level well too low level to the American Standard. And think of the Americans standard like the gold standard because they had a higher standard than apparently the panamanians were going to have at least this is what I overheard was going on in the discussions. Turnout like I said they were right they had a means for conservation of water they had a means to actually fill the lakes but they did not listen to them and they let it get to what it is now yes I know there hasn't been this big a drought but there were things that were put in place that had they followed it in the first place it probably would not have gotten this bad. I admit I could be wrong it could be that well with such a heavy bad drought things can happen but there were certain contingencies in place if this should happen, but at the time it being 1976 will it rain being perfect Etc nobody ever listens do they the fact that now after what is it 40 years, 40 plus years actually that this is now happening and they're having problems is because they are not doing things the way they're supposed to be doing them and I am not surprised that things are getting fouled up because of it I mean listen to what the guy just said he said that they are not putting a ration on the drinking supply but are only putting a ration on the use of the canal except is that a ration of actual drinking or is it actually being used for other purposes which if you know the area you would know there are other purposes that they use it for and it may be this that's putting more of a drain than anything else in fact there were periods of time when you weren't allowed to drink the water because the water was so foul, not without boiling it first, but the authorities don't want to do that they want their cake and eat it too. But none of this surprises me either because we live in a me me me me me me me society a society where the only person who counts is number one and nobody else matters and since everybody is a I'm the only one who counts sort of person then of course this is going to happen. For me this is sad because I remember a beautiful country I remember fishing on those lakes as a small small child I remember actually seeing my first manatee and once they even had a whale shark that passed through and they literally had to very carefully heard it from one of the canals it could come in through one of the locks and literally get it all the way out to the Pacific side and that was one of those stories I remember overhearing and finding very fascinating, and also wishing that I had gotten to see. You know America bought Alaska from I think it was the Russians it was called Polk's folly but we would never think of giving it back to the natives who live there and who it should belong to no no we would never give that back even though we paid much less for that then we paid for the Panama canal and I'm talking Panama itself we bought that country and it wasn't called Panama until we gave it that name when I say we I mean America and then 63 years later we give it away we make a treaty in which we give it away I don't know about anybody else but considering how much money went into it how many lives went into it how much it cost overall to create the country that is known as Panama and its canal I cannot I will never understand how it is we let it go for nothing without any kind of contingency clause or whatever to come in and take it back and not let it go again while we fix up their mess... But no something so valuable we gave away as if it was nothing, and they called Alaska Polk's folly why don't we call the Panama canal treaty Carter's folly.
I dont doubt that someone, at least ONE person, has raised the question of what to do with their fresh water problem after they've dumped over an entire century. The likely outcome was that no one in the top government positions gave a crap. They never do until the problem is right in their face. It's more profitable to work with what's profitable now, isn't it? There's no way someone didn't think about long term solutions for the canel.
It was never that bad that much is true but it was pretty bad a couple of times when I was a kid and the way they usually took care of that was to do a certain thing about filling the lakes and I don't remember how exactly that was done but I do remember that there was a period of time when the ships were not allowed to go through and they instead have the locks open to allow the sea water to fill up the lake I don't remember how this was done I just remember hearing about it I was a very little kid at the time and thinking that this was rather interesting that they were having to fill up the lakes because there wasn't enough water and that they were also going to be cleaning the lakes from some of the garbage that people had unfortunately tossed in it.
El Nino didn't exist over a hundred years ago, and it didn't even exist over 40 no I take that back 50 years ago it's not new as far as the last 40 years are concerned but then again most people don't remember anything from before that there were times when there were droughts they were rare and it did occur in the last hundred years or more that the canal has been around I won't go into what they did to keep things clear because it is a really complicated mess of a way of doing things but it was done because it had to be done otherwise you ended up with sludge problems I will not go into all of it but otherwise the canal itself didn't work properly and neither did the lakes the lakes have to be maintained a certain way or the wise you got problems and when I say they have to be maintained I mean they were maintained and if you ask how it has to do with how they sometimes have to fill them up and sometimes they had to dredge a little bit in certain areas or do other things that I don't remember exactly the words for but they did them. I remember them having to do it only once when I was a really little little kid considering I'm old enough to probably be the person who's giving this over is mother or grandmother it's hard to tell the voice is somewhere in their 30s or 40s it's hard to tell I'd say I'm close enough to be either their mother or their grandmother I can tell you it's from when I was a kid, I've had a very long and interesting life and I was a military brat from most of that the interesting part of it anyway.
i wonder if it'd be cost efficient for them to use a series of pumps and turbines to reuse the water in the intermediate flood gates. They could use pumps to relocate the water from lower chambers, back to the higher chambers, then use Turbines to regain some of the power while the water flows back to the lower chambers, then open some level stabilization pipes to ensure the water levels are even, while waste minimal amounts of fresh water from salt contamination. some companies use some similar tech in Water Batteries for Solar/Hydro power generation.
There have been droughts before and the way they solve the problem has more to do with the history of the Panama canal and how things were run when the Americans were running it unfortunately that is not what you're telling here and why aren't you telling that part of the story because you probably don't know that part of the story it's the part of the story that the Carter administration and others who were Panama did not want anyone to know about and that is the part that makes the story so much more interesting if you know the history of the place in the first place which you don't.
The gentleman in question and his desire to speed through the words that he is saying mispronounces it's ga tune that's how it's pronounced getoun not not goton but then again you'd have to know the history of the place to know Howard got its name and the mispronunciation might be because the name is an American named not a Spanish name and it is pronouncing it no doubt the way somebody who speaks Spanish would pronounce an English sounding name.
I know all there is to know about the Panama canal because I learned it in school and like a good kid I remembered it but then again I was interested in that sort of thing especially how it compared to the Suez canal.
The biggest problem with this is that nobody realizes that Panama didn't exist as a country it was a part of Colombia was bought for from Columbia by the United States in order to stop a civil war that had already had begun between the what is known in English is landless peasants but it is not quite correct in that statement but that's how they call it because unfortunately Protestants do not have a concept of serfdom which is unfortunately what a campesino is, the Americans bought that section of land Lock Stock and barrel they created the country down to its my its flag its legal system everything in including its monetary system they basically set up this country so that those who were rebelling against the entitled landowners could have their own land and the city dwellers wouldn't have to worry about a terrorist attack or them becoming even communist at that time communism still being in its infancy at that time but the idea was still there,America came in solve the problem that Columbia was having got their problem solved because they wanted to make a canal and unfortunately where they had planned originally had proved non-viable this was a much more viable option since it was smaller and easier to control they would control the whole damn thing cuz they bought it that said Jimmy Carter decides that he wants to help out his good friend at certain person who was his good friend was also the head of a drug cartel unfortunately Jimmy Carter wanted to get himself some kind of great publicity by giving up the Panama canal rather than squashing what was starting out to be a communist infiltration buy Cuba no less, Americans bought the whole area they set up an entire country and for what it was predicted before Jimmy Carter ever gave away the canal that if he gave away the canal to the panamanians that it would eventually end up becoming clogged and unable to be operated and that is what is happening.
The #1 alternative is by train not road but roads can still be used. Trains are simply better for that long haul of cargo. Economic interest was sparked by China, it used to be Bolivia instead of Paraguay and Argentina but their political issues made China drop them and focus in Argentina and Paraguay. This also made Perú interested in the project so they decided to rebuilt their ports as well to get a bit of trade from the bi oceanic route and become an interesting port aside from Chile in the Pacific. The only actual issue with this is funding for the project, Chile and Brazil can deal with it but Argentina and Paraguay have more issues to address before joining so it doesn't matter if Chile and Brazil fulfill their part they would have to lend a hand to Argentina and Paraguay and that is too expensive which makes a need for 3rd party funding it
Add pumps to capture the remaining the 40% of fresh water needed. If this is really costing billions in GDP across the globe, than it should be a no brainer
A lot of this is false.  Starting with weather data dates for Panama.  They got back with a 5 minute search to at least 1935 and this is with out paying for older data.
They touched my BOATS!
Why can't they use salt water for the channel locks?
cant you just dig a new canal that goes all the way down to water level. sure it would cost billions, but it seems like not having it costs billions too
I wonder why instead of dumping excess water into the ocean why they don’t pump it back uphill at times of drought. It would be expensive but perhaps not as expensive as losing the canal.   Also how much more time is added by loading and unloading shipping containers from ships then on truck across driven across Mexico only to be reloaded on ships on the other side?
Hopefully we can get rid lf lithium ion batteries. Nothing against south america, but lithium simply has so many problems with it. Especially its volatility.
So…the Cartels in Mexico will shift their focus from drug trade to railway trade?
Dig the canal 26 meters deeper so the locks aren't needed. Or pump the water back up to the lake instead of dumping it in the ocean.
Why not pump ocean water
This is kinda only a problem for the old locks? They have some new locks for maersk mega shippers.
Curious if the Chinese are pissed about the Houthis as well
Typical lack of planning. The answer is simply to pump the water back up to the lakes instead of draining it all into the ocean. Of course, that would require foresight and spending some of the money they've been continuously siphoning from the canal back into the canal.
here we go with climate change destroying the panama canal and why can't they use sea water for the locks instead of fresh water?
Why is the only location considered for a bi-oceanic corridor in the toughest part of central South America instead of more South like between Buenos Aires and Santiago, which seems economically preferable?
I didn’t know the canal was using new fresh water each time. That’s ridiculous and clearly no longer sustainable. Perhaps they should find a way to cycle water among the locks. This would require linking Atlantic side locks with the Pacific side locks. Or maybe tap into ocean water instead of freshwater.
Cant the canal be lowered by 26m?
I don’t understand how you turn a water shortage affecting the canal’s operation into the statement “the canal is beginning to break down”. There was no mention made of the canal infrastructure breaking down and I was honestly expecting to hear something to this regard.   NOAA says El Niño is almost over. Problem solved. You could have just said that and saved me 20 minutes.
These problems seem analogous to depression. Has Panama tried just not having a problem?
Its amazing that a country could survive almost solely by correctly managing their shortcut.
Maybe the droughts from global climate change will affect the broodlords gold mounds, and theyll stop spreading feces in the atmosphere
Western propaganda channel.
nothing but alarming propaganda... esp when it comes to the armed forces of the US... China would have serious problems if okinawa & guam were the preliminary targets of a taiwan invasion...
Stop fear mongering,  the Panama canal will be fine!
Guess what politics and big corporations will choose between the canal operations (« business as usual » as they say) and water supply for the local population ? 🤔 Difficult guess… 🤦‍♂️
We have desalination and  Panama is between 2 oceans figure it out😆😆 Or pump ocean water in to  compensate!!
why is the mic quality so shite
Everything is "climate change" now...like all white people were racists under Obama and now Domestic Terrorists under Braindead-in-Chief....
moving through the panamal canal puts less hands on cargo whereas the mexico proposal will put more cargo into the hands of potentially thousands... sounds like a terrible idea...
Why not pump the water from valve 1 to 2, to level it with the ocean and then pump it back to 1 to level it ? You'll lose less water
Why not just dig it a hundred feet deeper thus  not needing the locks?   China sucks,  oops i mean they have sucky equipment,  oops, I mean dredging equipment that can make artificial islands even in the middle of the ocean..  [claiming the whole ocean as theirs!]
I understand that letting the freshwater go out into the ocean is the cheapest and most efficient way to release the water, but why not simply add a pump and large tanks to pump the lower level water out, then open the drain from that tank back into the section to raise it back up?  This way would not use any water and allow many more ships through.  A little extra electricity cost can be recaptured in the fees they charge.
All the money they charge shipping companies, am sure they’re able pipe in water elsewhere.
Good!
why the hell dont they use saltwater?! am i taking crazy pills or something? why wouldnt they use saltwater from the ocean? the its right there, the ships are already in it. what the hell
Only allowing smaller ships just doesn't make any sense, simply speaking, a bigger ship is equivalent to multiple smaller ships, it will always be more economical regarding fresh water usage, larger ship -> larger displacement -> less fresh water needed.
If the Panama Canal was closed wouldn’t it be easier for all companies in the east shipping and receiving East Asia to have the deliveries shipped and received on the west coast and then use trains to ship them across the US while the West coast does the same the other way? That seems faster than going around South America.
mexico is the answer Mexico's "Inter-Oceanic Train" will carry both passengers and cargo on a 3-hour trip from the coastal hub in Veracruz state to the Pacific port of Salina Cruz
12:50 no I disagree. The same amount of water needs to be moved regardless of the ships displacement. I'd check your source on that one.
American problems KEKW
AI voice?
If China attacks Taiwan, they're not going to outright attack the US at the same time. China's best chance for success Taiwan is the US balks at supporting them. If they attack US bases in Guam at the same time, they've pretty much guranteed WWIII. While Guam isn't in the the North Atlantic, I'm pretty sure an attack on a US territory like Guam is probably enough to trigger Article 5 of the NATO treaty not to mention at least a few Pacific treaties or agreements. After all I believe the name of the treaty is meant to describe where the memeber states are not, where an attack must come from or occure at. China's best hope for a war against Taiwan is convincing the rest of the world a relatively small island isn't worth WWIII, but as long as those sweet sweet semiconductors are produced there, that aint happening. At least untll TSMC's fabs in the US are up an running. Then US and NATO envolvement in Taiwan may go only as far as evacuations of releveant people, and destruction of current production plants in Taiwan. Honestly, is a cold calculated easy end to that war. China get's Taiwan back, finally, but the western world protects what they really cared about. If China think's the western world is letting them get their hands on TSMC's fabs, they're outside of their minds on that one.
I love the idea that a device to increase consumerism is being destroyed by consumerism. It's as if we should learn a lesson or something.
I mean, what are the Houthi's end goal? All they're going to do is learn how Hamas feels right now, but instead of one country it's going to be every country who's economy is being affected by their bull shit. At some point the civilized world is going t stop playing nice, and yes, believe it or not so far they have been even with all the bombs being dropped. Yemen is working on being the first new colony the world has seen in a long time. Who colony? That's anyone's guess. I'm guessing Europe since the transit route is probably more important to Europe than America, but not doubt America will help.
Well if they make so much money from the canal then they might wanna invest in desalination
Why can they use salt water from Atlantic or Pacific?
Why are they using lake water when they have 2 oceans?
wait... why do they need fresh water for the canal? The sea is right there. What's wrong with that water to flood the locks?
You've got to love the religious overtones of this video. As the Greeks blamed the gods, today's politicians blame "climate change." The climate has always changed. Until the 21st century, humans adapted successfully. Now . . . humans refuse to adapt. That's an exceptionally bad strategy for survival.
As an engineer, I would propose that the water from the final lock be pumped back up to the lake, rather than dumped into the ocean. Can pumps be built with that capacity? Can Panama afford the cost of it?
I believe a shorter alternative route from US East Coast to Asia is via Cape Good Hope instead of Cape Horn
why is yemen bombing the ships tho
Panama needs to pump the freshwater back up or do local recycling.
America has no business fighting China.
Panama should build a reclaimed water system similar to Egypt's artificial river plan.
if the water just goes out into the ocean from the canal. Why not use salt water to fill the levels traveled in the canal???
Can they not capture and reuse the fresh water being dumped into the ocean.?
"Carter agreed to give the canal back to Panama."   Actually, the treaty was agreed upon LONG before Carter.
I thought climate change was a myth tho??
For anyone watching this now, el nino has already started to weaken. NOAA is now projecting it to be gone within a month or two
How bout simply recycling the water by pumping the used water back into the reservoir verse dumping it into the ocean.
Why is the audio sped up so much?
Even if the bioceanic road is successful, Panama will still get plenty of business
I haven't gone thru all the thousands of comments, so if my comment here has already been mentioned, I apologize.  The Panama Canal also has another big problem in the upcoming decades...the Northwest and Northeast Passages (including the Arctic sea route) opening up as an alternate trade route.  With the Arctic sea ice melting at a rapid pace, soon there will be trade from the Far East to the Americas/Europe and back using the Arctic Ocean and the Canadian Arctic's waterways between Greenland and Alaska.
Is it at all possible for Panama (or other canals) to just use seawater instead of freshwater?
If we would do more regional than these problems would be less and the pollotion too. But people prefer to bulg by temu crap and co.
It is because Whites don't run or own it anymore, that's the real reason
narrator has been repeating the words climate change more often than the WEF.
why the fuck USA has to act as military world police?
What about building a railway or motorway across Panama? Also, as someone already pointed out, how about pumping the water from the lower locks back into the higher locks instead of releasing it into the sea? (With some desalination, since the entry of sea water into the lowest lock can't be fully prevented, though I imagine the effect might be kept low enough that desalination is not necessary.)
what is wrong with your audio?
I was following along with you until your picture of the map with shipping routes now I don't believe anything you say
Why would you pump water from a higher level to a lower one? Doesn't water naturally flow downhill? I transited the Sacramento deep water channel and the lock at Miller's park just opened the gate to the Sacramento river and the higher level filled the lock to the same level as the river. No pumping required.
EIGHTEEN!
The audio quality of this video is sub-par. Did you change your codec or mic?
Build a big Falkirk wheel. 🙂
Now finally the capitalists are going to care about climate change lol
Why not use the water from the ocean
They should come up with a “mega container”, a system that can combine many containers into one larger package that can be easily moved between ships. That way, even a huge cargo ship could be rapidly unloaded on one side of Panama, and then rapidly loaded into a different cargo ship on the other side, via train
Rather than releasing the water into the ocean, why aren’t they just pumping it back into the lake??
So basically, if lake Gatun gets 26 meters lower, it’ll be the same level as sea-level, which means the locks will no longer be needed. Got it.
Make the Capitalists care....
Well Imma guess it's corruption and the ability to fuck up maintaining the canal once given over to Panama.   If USA  still controlled it,  it'd still be taken care of and even upgraded.
WANG G!!!!!
Why waste all that water by to the ocean it should have been saved and pumpeg it back again for further use
Why can they not uses sea water?
Uuhhhhhh…the war in the Middle East will come to an end? Bold claim. Last I heard Americas military was a fan of forever wars.
How on earth, is only allowing less displacement vessels through a good idea, wouldn't you want the exact opposite to maximize water usage and minimize waste.  on the lift trip it doesn't matter how much or less the boat displaces but on the exit / down trip the amount of water lost would only be equivalent to the water in the lock section that the boat is not displacing. so if yo have a piece of Styrofoam floating on the surface of the lock section and you want to lower that back down to sea level you will be loosing almost that entire lock volume of water, but if you have a boat that almost completely fills the lock section then you will only loose the small amount of water left around the ship
Sound quality of the voice is terrible, constant distortion in the voice. Avoid if you listen to this on a good pair of headphone. In 2024, there is no good reason for this.
Would it be financially feasible to build container ports and a rail system for the lifting/lowering of containers, combined with coastal shipping coast-to-coast on the canal, then lowering the goods to another ship on the other side? Lay pipelines for some goods pumping the goods up to the coast-to-coast travel … it would mean that two ships would need to coordinate their voyage to each end of the canal. But it would reduce the amount of water lost.
Its bad for china. They need to get important  shipments  to through red sea. They should  get together and help Britain  and usa. Or just take that over. Security . Eventually.  Help humanity.  Too bad china leaders are so closed mindedness.
With all that money being raked in and nobody is planning to rework the canal for an update.  Sounds like they did it to themselves.
dam its almost like climate change is just Nature doing itz thing and not humans
Is there a seasonal option to go up between Greenland and the Canadian coast, around Baffin Island though the bearing straight? Or is that any shorter than the horn? I see it's not shown as an option here, so there must not be an ice-free way  to go that route in the northern hemisphere .. summer ..with " climate change" perhaps that will become an option?
I Suggest we make the Mexican Canal instead. With Modern Technology we can make an even better canal with hookers and beer!
Some ideas that came to mind that could help the Panama canal was maybe if it could be done making the canal all one level that way those other water sources wouldn't be involved or another idea that comes to mind is if you make a mod to the current system where water is stored for each of the raisings to not lose the water at the final gate and have that water have a pipe or tube bring that water back to the 1st gate. Then that boat is let out.
TOO RADLEY TO LISTEN TOO!
I wonder whether climate change had anything to do with the lack of water in the lakes.  This really only became a problem after the new larger locks were installed.  I think this addition is drawing more fresh water than the  lake system can normally supply.  It's too easy just blaming everything on climate change.
I would take this opportunity to clean up the trash that people have dumped into the lake and river.
This sounds like a robot reading some kids essay where every word counted.
I would say they should find a way to pump the water back into the lake instead of dumping it out into the ocean there's no sense in wasting the fresh water if you can just pump it back in or instead of pumping it into the lake you just build a giant container that you can pump it into and then pull it back out of to raise and lower ships
Why don't they use sea water to fill the first locks at v each end and or why don't they have reservoirs to hold water from each lock for reuse?
Istmo in Mexico is almost done and should be up and running By mid 2024
Why can't they use salt water? Seems hella greedy to take precious drinking water and dump it into the ocean.  Completely unacceptable, really.  If there's thirsty people living in that region then I'd rather close the canal and pay more for goods than be part of that cycle.
Just edit the canal so no pumping fresh water is needed, that's what I'd do in cities skylines
You know, the Panama Canal could pump freshwater back into the lake instead of pouring it into the ocean...
I can't speak for other nations shipping routes, but the US can easily ship products across land by train or truck before shipping off  to the nation that is receiving the product.  Sure, boats are much larger and can carry much more, but at least there is the land option to shave time sailing around the long way.
Climate alarmists and climate consensus scientists claim the oceans are rising at rates that are going to flood all coastal cities in the next few years. Why isn’t this increasing ocean levels offsetting the seasonal rain shortfall?
does anyone remember when the United State's turned the canal over  to Panama , why do think it's dying ?
Why isn't the water just recycled in a closed loop? It seems like a doable upgrade where you would at least reuse most of the water
I stopped watching this after 5 minutes, by which time you had still not introduced a single contention to explain why Panama was dying. Users are starting to realise that an American accent usually means "I'll drag this out as long as possible and probably not fulfil the video's promise in the title".
I'm stumped on how you talk about red sea attacks without even mentionning the fact that's it's to fight against Israel's crimes against humanity This just makes me doubt you all around, how can you just skip over what the International Court has ruled as "a potential genocide" unfolding.
limiting ships weight? if the size of the lock is unchanged, the weight or size of the ship doesn't matter in terms of water consumption, or am I missing something here?
Is this bullshit or when the usa turned over the canal starting when carter was president did the nation cock things up? Sorry but there it is taking with out maintainng or servicing the long term needs
Commentator couldn't talk any faster, could he? Might shut him up completely  - which would be good
Skip the first 5 minutes and thank me later. This is some of the worst writing I’ve seen on this channel.
Saudi Arabia pump a buncha crap into their clouds for added rainfall yield. I'm sure the canal eggheads thought of this.. 🤷🏾‍♂️
My city shows in the corridor lol, don't give me hope
Trains
It's very curious and funny that you ignore the likelihood that Mexico won't survive ten years in view of the malignant cancer of the drug cartels that the Mexican government is incapable of defeating the cartels who are increasingly economically and militarily powerful,  owning police, army,  officials, and businesses!! Why ignore this?!
Have you given an extensive report about the attempted coup against Ortega funded by the CIA or the brutal sanctions put on Nicaragua by the US Congress???
Y not use salt water? 🫢
The Green Transition is BALONEY. Lithium for cars and vehicles requires the child slave labor in the Congo for electric cars that will never go anywhere in North America or Northern Europe.
Houtis attacks only ships that goes to Israel. Now they attack US and UK ships because they attack houties. Besides only houtis asked was cease fire which US always prevented in UN.
Is there any particular reason why your fascinating video neglected to mention that the events in the Red Sea exists because the Houthis are punishing ships headed for Israel or its allies because of Israel's barbaric attacks on Gaza???
Climate change is a hoax buddy - will always have weather changes - what you are describing is local not global
Maybe what they should do is modify the canal so it doesn't pull water from the lake, maybe change it by cuttign off the fresh water and using ocean water as the transit source for the canal, this way there's endless supply for it, as it's much easier to get ahold of salt water over fresh water.
Why dont they use sea water instead of fresh water...
FYI the longest El Nino was in 1986-1988 and the longest La Nina was in 1973-1976
What is missed is if the US had invested in high speed rail like Europe we could have transported a large amount of freight from the East and west coasts.
They should use TRAINS for the Bi oceanic corridor, why on earth would they use trucks
Why don't we just buy it?
Nature is backfiring
Why not re-engineer the canal to use mostly sea water? This would require pumping in water rather than using gravity like the current system, but at least pumping, which is dependant on electricity, can be sourced from sustainable power sources.    Technically, considering the boats go up and down the same elevation, you should be able to use a lot of the water from one end at the other end of the locks, but how would you actually do that?
This is a solvable problem. But that doesn't fit the climate change narrative. They want us all to panic....so they can implement their  climate change solutions agenda. Sneaky snakes...YouTube encourages all of it.
And you thought you were saving the world by taking a 3 minute shower and turning off the faucet quickly
Why did he speed up the audio wtf is going onnnn
Use desalinization plants and seawater to operate the gates
Aside From Not Previously Realizing 2 Things About The Middle Of The South American Continent (The “Grand Chaco Region” For The “Bi-Oceanic Corridor” Through Paraguay / The “Lithium Triangle” Between Chile, Argentina X Bolivia That Has A Massive Deposit Of The Material That Even India Discovered Between Pakistan X China Back In 2023!) Or The 2 Alternatives Of Upgrading Colombia / Mexico For Their “Developments”… There Is As Low As 5 To 19 Miles Of Distance For The Existing Roads In Panama / Colombia Have Left To Touch The Border Between Them X The “‘Troncal-10’ Highway” Goes About 1 Kilometer Into Guyana’s “Essequibo Region” That Venezuela Is Desperately Trying To Obtain, As The “Guiana Gems” Above Brazil Have Their Northernmost Areas More Drivable Compared To Their Southernmost Ones (Their Borders Aren’t 100% Defined… Like There’s Still A Dispute On The Westernmost Pieces Of The “Guiana Amazonian Park” From French Guiana, That’s Still France Technically… For A New “Easternmost Point” That Owns Some Of The “Rio Marouini” River!)… Meaning That They Have Yet To Build Bridges To Connect Their Sections On The “Courantyne” X “Maroni” Rivers To Skip The 7+ Total Kilometers Of Ferries On Both Ends Of Northern Suriname! (As The “Upgrade” To The Dying Canal Is A “Remaining Resort” To The 5 “Alternatives” Away From The Proposed “Canal” Through Nicaragua, It Should Be Worth Noting That Mexico Is Upgrading Their Railways Around The Yucatán Peninsula For The “Chicxulub Impact Site” To Fix Their “Broken” South That Has An Unprotected Border Like America’s That Texas Is Taking Action… Besides Not Intervening On Guatemala Or Belize To Truly Settle Their “Border” That They Have Been Working On Since 1859 At The Earliest / 2022 At The Latest!)
Ocean water ( salt water) !
The USA recognises Taiwan as part of China.
Northern hemisphere, not western
surely they can just pump the water back up into in lake gatun instead of dumping it into the ocean... like how fucking dumb do they have to be to not do that?
The bi oceanic road sounds ridiculous to be a main freight artery by truck, why is this not a planned rail road?
As someone who grew up in Panama, it saddens me to keep seeing these sensationalist youtubers promoting China's agenda.  Yes, because they are the biggest users of the canal an the only ones who 'theoretically' can fund another one thru Nicaragua, Mexico or Colombia. Good luck with that. Plus, Panama is capitalism pure and simple: Supply vs demand curve. Want your lawnchairs from China faster, or you LNG quicker: Buck up and quit your whining. And do you actually know a single person "impacted by the wait times." ?. i didnt think so.  Interesting he says 'bribe' to get ahead in line when we pay airlines to 'pre board' and better service all the time. Same concept, different size.  Plus the newer locks dont use pumps either. Plus it rained record in December as el Nino changed...so we'll see how much clickbait this gets then. No sponsorship for this guy .
This won't matter much since in 20 yrs it will be frozen wasteland after the Pole shift in the 2040s.
I love how you don't mention the conflict in Palestine.
Eventually, America won't be North or South. We'll be Pan America. This will not matter long term. You don't fuck with our boats.
dumb question: cant they buils some kind of artificial buffer reservoir? instead of dumoing water in the ocean, they pump it either in the seperate reservoir or better yet, back into the lacke?
Wow, even the first half minute is full of disgusting propaganda. You have outdone yourself. Bravo.
I don't think another canal is going to work. 100 years ago nobody thought the Panama canal will run dry.... The problem with communist/dictatorial governments (like Nicaragua) is that once they fixed their minds on a solution, they cannot change it. And the world does not need Chinese companies running their projects earning money for China for 50 years
12:45 What ?! Lighter ship cause less water displacement -> that's right. "and require less water to move through the locks' ? WTF ? no !? how would that even make sense ? The displacement of the ship doesn't matter. A light ship and an heavy ship will both enter the lock at the same elevation and you need to add the same amount of water into the locks to make them move up. Which is basically a give amount of m3. Since water is for this purpose "incompressible" the actual weight of the ship doesn't matter ! An explanation for this restriction is the water level on the lake. Since the lake water level is low, they do not want the ship to touch the bottom. Cause depth is linked to the weight and displacement. Also additional point, there are no pumps, it's literally like any other locks in the world it's gravity fed water from the high level to the low level. Also there are multiple sub-level tanks visible from the images next to the locks. Those are used to prevent too much water loss.
I wonder how this equation would change with a nuclear power plant on each end of the canal, with the energy of each dedicated to recirculating the water used in the locks instead of relying solely on lake water.
I don’t know what’s happened, but the Audio quality of this channel is, bad. I don’t know if YouTube messed with compression or what but the audio is bad.
As an Australian all Im getting from this is we are far closer to Asian countries were most things are made yet somehow they charge us shitloads more for "Shipping" when there's no ridiculously expensive engineering feats required to get anything here.
7:13 to be honest they just need to pump the water to an adjacent reservoir instead of the ocean this should handle the first issue.
When you refer ti Yemen can't yku mention thdt the Houthis aren't randomly attacking ships, but doing so against ships allied eith Israel as long as Israel attacking Gaza snd killing its people?! Provide some context!
Current Panama canal is too damaging; shut it down now until a non-freshwater means of operating is smart enufff.  Redesign it fools!  (is the only logical option).
can we possibly make a video that is not 30 fucking mins to clearly answer the question posed in the title?
I thought the guy who promoted the concept of "economic specialization" seemed like a genius with an incredibly logical idea when i lesrned about it in school.   However, im certain this man was unconcerned with several issues. War, pandemics, and global shipping emissions. Perhaps its better if a country produces all the goods it needs. Even if you cant get those new jordan shoes.
Panama like many places is creating new land fro the shallow near land areas of their Oceans.  Because of this the flats or shallows/bay areas are no more. These areas of the Oceans are always going to have more evaporation but as we get rid of these areas and as they also drain swamps there will be less evaporation and also less rainfall. Less evaporation = less rainfall = hotter temperatures and is also a major contributor to global warming. Protect the world’s bays, shallows, flats, swamps and wetlands
Why can’t the first lock pump water into a separate holding pool and then back into the lake?
What a load of BS. So it's not the extra two (2) locks built without the added dams needed for water, no its climate change. LMAO  Panama followed the US blueprint for expansion without the added dams and that is a reason they're running out of water! Duh!!!
The continents will move creating new shortcut passageways before war ends in the middle east
if pumps were involved why not pump from the ocean?
any sane country would have installed pumps to recirculate salt water higher to feed the water gates. it's not even a money problem, this thing is a cash machine ! it literally makes money for the country. Any machine needs investment from time to time. Just install solar panels / wind turbines, and use electric pumps to feed the water gates. Bam infinite cash.  but noooo they prefer to suck dry their clean water lakes. in the end they would have no choice to install pumps anyways, but that would be after the collapse of their agriculture, ecosystem and drinkable water supply
trucks sure, but hear me out: TRAINS
REdig the Panama Canal to sea level?
You talk too much sh*t to pad for time. It was really annoying and you used the human development index to talk about economic development in Latin American countries? What level of misinformation are you trying to pull?
you said unprecedented waaaay to much
Ironic how a problem that is being caused by climate change, has an offered solution of "lets put it in trucks and drive it across the continent.".... a ship can carry 20k+ containers, meaning that to get the same volume across land, you need anywhere from 10k to 20k trucks. Just imagine the excess amount of carbon that will bring.... what was the reason we couldn't use the canal again?
Buy local. Done!
War in the middle east will end 😂😂😂😂😂  does America know that?
Earth is flat
All I hear was buy stock for Zim as shipping cost will soar.
why not have locks going each way in two rows then you can just pump the water between them rather than losing it to the sea?
In fact the US founded Mexican revolution because they wanted Mexico to close the railway in Tehuantepec, the Mexican government didn’t agree so they overthrew tu government
United States should offer statehood To better manage migration
They have to recycle the water period.
What climate change?  There's to many ship movements for the amount of rain they have had last year. el Nino isn't climate change.
Big if true
I'm still not sure why Carter thought it was a good idea to let go of the Canal, given its strategic importance.
My small brain hears how the system dumps water out of the lake and all I can think with lizard brain is "Uhh...why not...stop doing that? Can't you either reuse the water or...put it back into the lake instead?????" Just...upgrade slash fix up the system, gotta adapt eh?
What a video. Wow
Let me guess. Is it because of China and war in Ukraine?
Simply put. What God has joined together, let no man put.asunder.  Ha ha.
Stop with the B.S. "climate change".  How many times do you say that in your stupid video??? It's like, let's subliminally program everyone to believe the b.s.!  When YOU dobt want the weather to do what YOU want it to do, then it's "climate change".  What IS actually happening  os that the weather is happening in a different place!!! It's random and when it isn't as predictable as YOU want it to be it's a problem!  California is full of water that they haven't gotten in a while so their reservoirs are full. They go through droughts and then it's recently been replenished.  That's the same rain that you are describing that didn't fill up Panama!!! As soon as you cry about no water you will get more than you can handle.  The only problem here is that humans are not patient! Humans think they can control weather! Humans think that if weather is on a normal cycle and then suddenly changes, that there is a problem! No, that is not the problem!  Weather is unpredictable anc constantly changing, if it didn't the earth would then actually dtagnate!!! That God for these types of variances because without them, c yikes in ecosystems wouldn't happen and then there would be even bigger problems!!!
Just pump the water back into the lake. Problem solved.
Interesting that the Mexican canal proposal also includes industrial parks along the route. Instantly sounds like "set up your new vehicle assembly plant here" to me, which is a pretty genius position to take, especially compared to the other alternatives proposed.
This wouldent happen under trump...
So rainfall in October 2023 was the lowest ever(since 1950). Not exactly a long period of time there skippy. Maybe after a couple of hundred years, or a 1000 years could a baseline be even close to accurate.
The middle east is always in some sort of war lol
world is already getting away from electric stuff and goes for hydrogen
What is a meter? We use freedom fractions!
This is what happens when people with zero vision and capabilities are put in charge of anything.
The same process is used in the canal du midi in France with many more locks and much higher into the mountains. So the Panama Canal is not really unique...
I'm sure somebody must have thought of this, but why can't they pump salt water in for that purpose, even if it takes a monstrous pipeline to do so, rather than the country's drinking water? Or pump the fresh water back to the top? It just seems like they could solve this with enough creative effort and money. And considering the cost of making ships go around, or people having no fresh water to drink, there should be no shortage of funds.
The Carter Administration should have never hand it back over. We paid for the land and digging the cannel It was one of the reason he was one term president.
Oh, climate change is bullfeces!
If they dug a tunnel there wouldn't be the need to locks or water usage. If that was too expensive just cut a sea level canal and install the odd bridge, that would reduce drug traffic too.
Good, stop the stupid global trading, that's what's killing the planet! Stop dealing with china!
This is all the USA fault for supporting a genocidal Israeli government!!!  Now Panama  they need another way to transfer the cargo shipment
So solution is instead of using gravity to fill the locks. On each lock you pump the water back up to the lake. There or pumps that have a head of 26 ft that can move that much water. Of course they'll be in parallel. So the problem is we're going to get the electricity? If the water going down through the pumps generates electricity and stories it in some sort of battery. Then the amount of electricity to pump back up business is great.
So pump the water from the oceans ...... Problem solved.
Higher costs for the consumer but i though a big proponent for why business owners take most of the profit is because they "take all the risk"
I think we all learned a lot of this in middle school.
Has Panama explored massive solar powered pumps too return water up hill instead of expending it into the oceans. One solution could be to pump the lower dock back into the lake. On each side. However a better solution might be... The weight of water equals the weight of the ships. If on one side, a ship of weight X is going down while a parallel dock is lifting a ship of weight X  then the energy required to lower one and raise the other is minimal. This principle is used for elevators world wide the weight of the elevator car is counter balanced by a weight. The only power required is that of the passengers. If Panama has side by side docks one going up and one going down then it should be possible to circulate the water between them and not consume water from the lakes. Ask Tesla/Elon Musk to design a solution!
When ships passed through the Panama canal,  it goes through six blocks. Is that water reused every time or is that water used once and thrown away which would be depleting the lake if the water is being thrown away wouldn’t the simple solution to the problem is to figure out how to reuse the water
'Stop relying on that Canal'  - Michelle Visage
Why not just build a bunch of desalination plants for drinking water as many Middle Eastern countries have? That type of infrastructure is well known at this point. This way, you avoid rationing.
You need to read China's history with Panamá. This includes the canal. If it wasn't for D.C. scrambling there would be a Chinese Embassy at the entrance to the canal with a giant China flag. Also, while Panama City (not the rest of the country) appears to be developed, it is a third world country. If it wasn't for all the drug money flowing into the banks (which are the large buildings you see and half empty), it wouldn't have the skyline it has.
Pretty optimistic thinking the chaos in the middle east will end lol .. and I suppose it's time for the population to drop and everyone come together finally and bring out anti gravity tech
Last I checked, ships are still going through the Panama Canal.
Replacing ships with trucks and rail is not scaleable.  Land transportation is much higher per ton mile than ships.  The loading and unloading is also time consuming and expensive.  Just put the pumps and tanks to reduce the water consumption of the canal.
Easy but expensive solution.  Install PUMPS to return the water coming out of lowest lock to the lake.
EVs will Rob the middle east of their dirty money...
Strange that you didnt mention why Huthis are doing what they are doing?.
I feel like a simple solution would be pumping sea water into the top loc to be used as ships move and using this instead of lake waters
Is it not feasible to pump water from the ocean into the chambers? I guess it's too expensive vs gravity.
Here is an idea.  Pump sea water into lake guten.  This may change the lake forever, but it resolves the water issue needed for canal.
Ooooh.   Off load on one coast and train across and reload onto a boat....oh yeah they used to do that before...ha
Well guess what? Mexico built the competitor of the Panama Canal in the narrowest section of the country.
Sick and tired of listening to all this waffle about climate change. Now it’s destroying the Panama Canal , absolute rubbish. It’s simply a case,(if it became necessary ) of spending the money on piping sea water instead of fresh water to control the locks. It won’t become necessary though, because the world and its climate is in great shape. Stop worrying people!
Easy, just dig a channel down to sea level across the country, problem solved. How hard can it be? /s
It might seem like a dumb take, but why can't they just pump the water back up instead of dump it to sea? Sure it would have some energy/cost problems, but those seem like a better alternative than just dump the water into the sea.
Gee. Am I really the only person who is wondering why they don't just use SEA WATER from the Atlantic to raise the level of the locks in turn?
It seems like a competitor would be a net benefit for Panama and its canal as the problem seems to arise from too much traffic. The Panama Canal’s credibility would not be at risk if it only had to contend with fewer ships because another canal was handling the excess traffic.
I grew up near Caen Hill in England (largest flight of consecutive locks) so when anyone explains to me how canals work I feel like I could give them an 1 hour long lecture
Time to build giant pumps to use seawater to fill the locks
Talking about the Houthi situation in the Middle East, without mentioning why it started in the first place (war in Gaza) shows either an incredible level of ignorance or bias from the video's creator.
Panamá should have, and urgently needs now, build a system to have the water from last locks from both sides of the canal pumped back into the lake rather than the Ocean.... Simple solution in the longrun in my mind
plot twist is this video is just a climate change activism video that is false
Climate change: the problem that USA cannot solve by bombardments.
my view may well seem uninformed at best however,  I see a really easy fix as long as the canal customers are willing to pay an uplift on transit fees. saying the canal is "dying" or anything similar appears an over reaction..
I love your videos, but I unfortunately can't keep watching this because the audio quality is so bad it's painful to me. I hope you can address this in the future.
Raise the price of transit.
Whats up with the audio on this video? Harsh and shitty.
Can someone summarize this for me? I don’t have 40 damn minutes.
@RealLifeLore just a friendly heads up your audio is super bad in this video. Usually its really good.
obviously recycling the water 💧 sounds logical
build some big-a$$ declinators and solar farms
Can they pump seawater to the top lock for a ship heading out? instead of using the fresh water
Talk to Dutch
Maybe they need to engineer a way to pump the water back to the reservoir instead of dump it into the ocean. Less efficient I'm sure, but at least they don't need to rely on nature as much then
maybe columbia will be able to *ahem* crack down on the cocaine trade if they manage to start making money from the train.
imagine just adding pumps to pump the water back into the system rather than dumping it into the ocean? nah cant do that.
Panama Canal should have been an artificial waterway across Panama using only sea water.   Yemen should receive normalized relations despite our pact with Saudi Arabia.
Good riddance!
Your microphone sounds horrible :(
Takes way way way too long to actually start explaining what the problem is
Why would they use pumps to equalize the levels and then waste it to the ocean?  It makes no sense.  Gravity would suffice to do it that way.  If pumps were used, they could recover some of the water.
the middle east has been in some type of conflict for well well for ever and the narrator says the war in the middle east will eventually come to an end yeah in 5 thousand years maybe but love his optimism
Warfare the whole world is sick of all the POWER greddy nations everyone of them.Of aii of them.🌍
All panama has to do is build tank or lake to store water from locks and reuse it.
Would it not be possible to put in pump to pump water into the top lock from the sea then you don't end up releasing fresh water into the sea
Is it possible or environmentally friendly to pump water from the ocean to the lake?  Was the man made lake designed to deal with salt water?
It is so sad what threy are going to do to South America cutting that Highway straight through the mountains and the trees they should do a tunnel from one side to the other so they don't mess up the landscape are the rainforest
They should start pumping water from the ocean into the locks instead of using the lake water
Why don’t they just pump filtered seawater into the first two locks to raise the ships...saving fresh water by using less ??
Why not deepen the canal?
Build the Panama Road.
The Alternative 5, fixing the old Panama Canal, disappoints me deeply. Just expand the freshwater source problem. Wtf? Can you not... just build water basins along the channel locks and arrange pumps, to pump each lock's water in and out of? Instead of, you know, dumping it all th the ocnean all the time???
Bro seriously needs a new mic. I couldn't bear to listen to this one due to the audio :(
Normal cyclical weather, man cannot fix normal climate fluctuation
The panama canal is the drug hub for North South and central America's
We had one year of a lower wet season.  One year does not make a trend.  Next year we might have an abundant rainy season.   Yes but it is unfortunate that the US no longer owns the canal. Yes back in the total history of 60 years.  I realize 60 years is a long time in the 4 billion years that the Earth has been here.  These people are relying on you to be stupid
This may be a dumb question/impossible solution but why not either:  A. Instead of dumping the last section of water into the ocean, pump it either back into the canal or back into the reservoir using something similar to an oil pipeline. Or  B. Set up desalination plants along the coast to pump sea water (that is converted into freshwater) into the freshwater reservoirs?  I know both would be expensive but I have to imagine that if this is one of the single most important trade routes, it probably generates enough wealth to do so, or maybe multiple countries that depend on this trade route would all contribute to such projects considering the need for quicker shipping and route access.
For alternative#1 - bioceanic corridor, I hope they can also consider feasibility of rail; it can be a dedicated line for cargo that is not disrupted by traffic, nor intermingle with transport of people. Terrain will be a challenge, maybe tunnels to maintain a more friendly elevation. Later on, a railway to transport people can be added once there is a need/if it will be viable.
Very misleading. The Houthis aren't "attacking ships from all over the world". They're attacking ships from nations who support Israel's ongoing genocide in Palestine. Ships from countries who don't support genocide still pass freely.
I guess you can't pump seawater into the locks to open back to the ocean so they aren't consuming freshwater?
5:20  Wars in the Middle East will never end
The sea water is there to be used; no need to use fresh lake water for the canal. They need to built water pipes to bring more sea water there. In other words, needs money.
That’s a big if and there is a huge armada called the pacific fleet. Don’t forget as well, who created Pananama
Why don't they use sea water?
Mexico is planning a new Cansl which will replace the current Panama canal!
As soon as I hear the word climate change I will automatically stop listening. No doubt the climate is changing but it is completely different from what scientists say we are all being lied to
So can they pump water through massive pipes from the ocean? Yeah it’ll take a while to build: and it’s gunna take massive pumps, but maybe an option - or dig a huge concrete pond that will have the amount of water you need to operate locks. And just try to recycle this water over and over again. Again huge pipes and pumps. But at this point there seems to be less options.
Stay home.🤔🌍✌️
Why can't they use salt water for the 1st and 2nd locks on both sides? Then they would only be using fresh water for ONE LOCK. Is this doable?
mic sounds mildly distorted.
This channel spits out a lot of info, half of it seems like bs, but i can't tell which half
On a positive note. We no longer own it. Sooooo, not our problem? 🤷
Is this video FAKE NEWS....BS
Why use dam water? Why not sea water?
They never expected a monster city in a country that was given to them.  Nor the two Arab military bases on the north and south bank of the cannel.  Everyone uses more and more.  Why not think about the issue and reroute the dump water back into the pump-up area and shuttle it back and forth as needed.
Do not panic taxpayers .  Our Grandparents taxes built it and paid for it.  Then our politicians in all their brilliance gave it to the Panamanian government . I am sure our Brilliant leadership will do it  all again with our Taxes and then and give it to them again.  Just the way our elected officials work,or don’t.  Both parties and yes I vote.
Fear mongering on a situation that has been going on for centuries, and since the data is only 70 yrs this is pure conjecture on what Will or Might happen, could just as well be a super heavy raining season we do not know but other projections not in this video show above or normal rainfall for 2024.
Would American people allow themselves to be drafted if China invaded Taiwan?, I hope not, it’s not their fight & it would be a war to benefit the rich solely, there’s no way British people would obey a conscription act to fight the Russians in Europe. No fcking way.
It is not el niño guilty, it is the First Quantum mining deforestation guilty, also geoingeniric chemtrails are guilty. So many times I have seen the clouds heavy of water and ready to start rainig, it come a plane spreading chemtrails, and suddenly all the clauds vanish. There is a human hand behind it. It is not a climate change it is the evil human hand.
There's a fifth option in the works in Costa Rica for a combined road and rail connection along it's northern territory.
NO NO NO!! THE HOUTHIES CLEARLT STATED THAT ONLY USA, BRITISH AND JEW SHIPS WERE THE ONLY TARGETS, AND ANYONE WORKING FOR ONLY THOSE THREE COUNTRIES,, THEY ALSO EXPLICITLY SAID THAT RUSSIAN AND CHINA HAVE A CLEAR PASSAGE!!!
i mean obviously there must be a reason i guess, but does anyone actually know why they dont just add pumps to move the water back to the lake? or at least back up the top of the locks?
2:30  The millennium started on January 1, 2001.
Your political assessments of the Houthies (Ansarallah)  unfortunately  and completely misrepresents what they are doing and why, as much as your analysis (I used the term loosely here) of tge South China Sea and Taiwan is too.  It seems you are full-blown pushing US propaganda.  Who funds you to put our such US imperialist propaganda? If no one, you need to do more incisive research before posting.
All of the inflation was caused by the pointless money printing that resulted from the pIandemic. And Sweden's example showed that all the panic was for completely nothing 😂😂😂
This is quite simple for the U.S.  BUY AMERICAN products.  American manufacturers have irresponsibly sourced their materials from other countries and now it’s come back to bite them.  Americans do NOT need a global economy.  We have the ability, the ingenuity, and availability of natural resources to be self-sufficient.  Just because the government tells us we can’t do it, doesn’t mean it cant be done.  This is what happens when you buy into the “global economy” farce.
at 5:00 start the reason as per title.
If you're really worried about climate control how about digging out the real Grand River between Texas California Arizona in New Mexico and Mexico itself and making it a International waterway
We gonna get fucked!
Every one can thank Jimmy Carter for loosing control of the Panama canal he gave it away Should have never happened
Just cloud seed it
How much water can you pump for 4 billion dollars?
What about the northern passage above Canada that is opening up due to global warming?
They could pump sea water into the first two locks to reduce freshwater attrition. They can also build desalination plants in Panama city to make drinking water out of sea water to reduce drinking water demand on the lake.
"About precisely"
In Panama why don’t they just pump the fresh water back into the lake instead of releasing it into the ocean? They could just charge an extra toll for the added cost
2:28 The new millennium started in 2001, not 2000.
I could fix the water problems easily. i just need 2 buckets of water.
10:20- No evidence this is due to Climate change…especially if they only started keep records since the 1950s and these are all artificial make lakes. My assumption is they will start working water salutation plants to create fresh water from the sea so that it can go in and out. We have tech now that can make this happen. Sooooo, not quite the full story and adding Climate change without stating long term studies showing this means it is an opinion…and I believe they are poor opinions.
It still baffles me that people think climate change is actually real. It’s actually impressive that governments and corporations have been able to brainwash most of the population into actually believing that this is true! People need to stop believing whatever their governments and corporations tell them and actually start thinking for themselves for a change. The world would be better if they did.
You’re also not taking into account all the US forward operating sites near the Panama C….and the US Navy ports.
3:26- the Philippines  US bases would be way more important. China wouldn’t be able to move on Taiwan because of that those bases, which have all the supplies needed to complete a blockade surrounding all Navy and exports/imports into China via sea. China couldn’t move fast enough and within days Chinas economy which is already fragile would collapse. US bases out of San Diego and a Hawaii wouldn’t be affected at all as well.
29:27 where is US on this list?
Have ships on both sides. And then carry your load over the land to your other ship.
So from the comments below, it seems that the whole operation of lifting the ships is done by opening valves from one lock to the next, and drawing down the water from the lakes at higher elevation.  That avoids pumping water, which is great. But if there is not enough water Pumps would allow the water to be re-used in a closed loop. I wonder if Panama has enough clear skys to use solar power to power pumps. Instead of letting the water flow to the oceans, it could be pumped back up to the highest lock. The 3 lock area is just longer than 3 of the longest ships, which is not that big.
Deering = during
Why can't they put pumps on the oceans and tie into the pipe line right in front of the place were the water inters the supply each one of the locks. If you do that you won't have to worry about that problem ever again and it will give you 2 different supply the locks.
build back better at its finest
As others post say there are no pumps, wouldn't it make sense to implement them?  Doing so would drop the water use to close to nothing.
With Joe Biden's executive orders, what difference does it make? Everything is a standstill in USA right now. We've had three years of this dismal sucker and we got a whole almost a year ago. 10 months is too long.
Is it just me, or is the audio for this video really low quality relative to the usual for this channel?
I wonder if they could make reservoirs and instead of dumping water into the ocean, keep recycling the same water, or maybe find a way to pump ocean water into those channels!  There’s a couple of ideas 💡
Well explained! Thank you! 😮

They need to add large solar farms to pump water back up to highest lever with out empty sea!
If rain water is the concern, hydraulic lift locks are a viable option as water loss is at a minimum. If there is such a great need for transport through Panama, building new locks around the current ones would seem to be worth the effort.
cargo planes..time to fly more using military bases .?.
Climate change is a lie.  For those who do not know, the climate has been changing ever since God created it.  God knows exactly what he is doing.
I think you mean the blockade they continue to illegally enforce against Cuba to this day.
Carter stupidly gave away control of Panama Canal. damn stupid decision withou thinking the future consequence. Hey Carter! Had you THOUGHT hard about it, the decision would have been PEANUTs!
That Effing Jimmy Carter! Biggest mistake his administration made.
Just stop Bidens dollars flowing into Iran and if the world believes in the CLIEmate charge theory the northwest passage will be ice free if john Kerry flies out to talk about it a few more times
Build a dry canal through Costa Rica. Solved
Build a 100 million gallon reservoir and pump the water over and over.
The fact that the American continent is treated as if it were separate is so idiotic and ignorant that I am ashamed of whoever made the video.
Lets make the stuff at home and we will not need the canals.
Build a canal from the ocean to the furthest lock. Do this on each end. Now use pumps pushing seawater to run the locks. Discharge the salt water back into its respective oceans.  This way, you don't need lake water, or farmland, to run the canal, and it doesn't cost as much as the alternatives. Best of all, it's not nearly as long of a project to complete.  But with expected sea level rise, it may not matter.  Major parts of the canal will be inundated 😢
So...they need the lake for drinking water, but its full of garbage according to the footage. And id bet in a few years, the rain will return to normal levels. Climate change people love to point to a record and claim its part of a pattern. But only when it supports their case. I can point to records that point the other direction, but those are ignored because they go against the narrative
Climate Change is HOGWASH. And ,yes the climate is sometimes unpredictable. It's the weather you idiots with degrees
Don’t forget they still have Somal pirates to deal with in the northeast of Africa. At least Paraguay is using employees instead of what China and its subordinate countries they save money with using slave workers adults and children. Great take your people back and employ them in Mexico, Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras
It took about 22 minutes into the video but he finally got to the real reason of the bi-Ocean corridor highway being built…It has nothing to do with giving Panama Canal a run for there money or a second choice if water levels get too low..The rest of the world wants lithium and they want it not going through Panama Canal
you wanna talk about a hand out, the US builds it and panama profits off it just to keep their country alfoat
Well there you go... Just because you thrust your teenage voice artificially low in order to sound like you know what you are talking about, doesnt mean you are  saying anything worthwhile. So the canal's broken for ever and now we'll have to live without it. Liberal know-it-all-ism at its finest. Dont listen to this moron who just needs to back to Walmart and give up the Walter Cronkite dreams....You need a brain to do that.
These 3rd world uprisings are specifically FUNDED   and Supplied by countries who make missiles
Nothing is exported from North America anymore. BRICS looks like the future
Stopped watching when I heard climate change.
lol, the vid is choke full of propaganda
It's a good thing that El Niño is quickly weakening back into a La Niña according to the latest reports for Panama.
Is desalinization not financially viable for Panama canal issues?
Can't they build pumps so they could pump ocean water, desaltify it and use for the canal instead or together with the lake water?
This video really opened my eyes to the environmental and economic threats facing the canal. I sincerely hope this gets fixed as soon as possible, since the canal brings so much value as a shipping passaget. If any of you have personal connections to Panama or the ships/trade that pass through the canal, I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts and stories!
excellence
I know this may get be too simple to work , why not build a reservoir, to save and re-use that water , near the lock that dumps fresh water into the ocean each time ,to a complete waste of a valuable resource? Or does this shortage of water is a convincing and convenient Monetary feast for Panama ?
So why, instead of flushing the water out to sea, don't they pump the water back up to the next lock?
This video is poorly researched.
Just dig it all up and turn it into a seawater system with valve's and dam's on both ends. There is no reason to rely on fresh drinkwater to move ships in this modern age where river excavation is no issue anymore.  Either that or create two fresh water reservoirs near the gates that are lower or just as low as the sea level. Drinking water can be pumped up and transported through the country from those reservoir's through pipes.
Use salt water to flood the locks, not fresh water.
surely panama already has highway infrastructure similar to that proposed by the other countries, unclear why this cant be upgraded to provide the answer to keeping the country's prosperity intact
What if like, instead of draining the fresh water back in to the ocean they just build a bunch of big tanks to store it? This seems like a real simple problem that an engineer could solve.
Huh, I'd always assumed the Panama Canal was just a trench, didn't realize it was a seires of lift-locks
Is this ai voice?
😂😂😂😂😂  I really would like to know how do all those foreigners walk from south America to Mexico and eventually the USA if the Panama canal is literally dividing the land.   I'm positive there's got to be a road or a bridge somewhere in there.   Thus they should make it and intercontinental road from chile all the way to the USA.  Put all cargo on 18 wheelers
These videos are so well produced but they can have a lot of misinformation. The drought in Panama will end but the wars in the Middle East will not. At least not in any of our lifetime
This will create an uptick in the inflation rate
There needs to be some serious dredging to deepen the canal.
So, pump the fresh water from the lower locks back into the lake. This is not rocket science.
Reminder: These "crises" are intentional.
I was wrong about my comment because if it going to hurt my people I would shout it down instead of killing my people
This is what you get when lives was lost over this opening and now they have the power to stop any ship from going threw so now does the United States of America fight again to open it back up or give them a choice of letting our ships go threw or we will take it back again
Please stop pushing the left wing narrative/Lie about so called Climate Change. Its so 2000
poor poor Panama socialist...
If you price trucks v rail v river / ocean transport you know trucks are the worst in cost and timeliness.
I think it’s funny. Inflation will only happen if production isn’t localized. The assumption here is globalization takes the most economical pathway, well yes but that pathway is circumstantial. Plus 50% of inflation is profiteering. If capitalism had been destroyed for “economies of scale” (read something more like Soviet style monopoly) by letting companies consolidate, we’d be paying much less and or being paid more.
The shipping industry has largely routed around it, but climate is going to permanently maim it. All major fresh water ways are messed up by it. Get used to global shipping to be permanently withered.
Why thy don't pump water from the ocean
22:47 Is this a joke or what?
Thank you for the video. I would prefer if you started with telling the threat to the Panama Canal and its workings instead of a long preamble talking about what is going on in the Middle East and why the canal is needed to save shipping miles.
I honestly don’t understand why container ships from eastern US are passing the Panama Canal to Asia, or west coast to Europe.   I’ve seen the amazing (we don’t have this style in Europe) container trains!!! The amount of containers (double stacked and crazy amount of train cars) is just insane.   So sending containers by train to the east coast that’s heading to Asia is a no-brainer. Same goes for cargo from the east coast that is going to Europe.   On my last visit in the US, I saw a couple of trains in Nevada state.
if China in vade Ta iwan an on same time North Korea invade  the south game over
It's too bad the Panama Canal was built as a "one way at a time" build and not at least a "two-lane" waterway where the west lane traveling east, is pumped to or from the east lane heading west thereby just pumping water back-and-forth between lanes and reusing the same water supply once sourced from the lake. Would not need to keep using new water from the lake for each ship transit through the canal.🤔🤔🤔
If pumps were actually involved, rather than the system being gravity fed, it would be simple for the lowest lock to pump water back up the system, meaning  no water lost lost in the system.
The voice sounds VERY AI.
Why is there no mention in this video of the impact of the Chinese-built upgrade to the Panama Canal that allows huge Super or New Panamax container shipd to transit the Isthmus of Panama?  This waterway, opened June 2016,  has had a terrible impact on the water levels in Lake Gatun.  This environmental impact was unforeseen by the Chinese (not that they would have cared anyhow).
If the crap hits the fan, the Panama citizens will die of thirst.
World War III  will be over the control water, directly or indirectly.
Why do I feel like the video is sped up 😂
Too many people. Stop having babies! Wrap that rascal!
Suggestion....BUILD A NEW CANAL IN THE NEXT NARROWEST ISTHMUS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. Today's tech can do it. Preiod.
So if they used ocean water, they would need to pump it, and risk some contamination of the fresh water lake if it leaked out of the locks? Sounds like they may need to go down that route.
the bi oceanic corridor would make so much more sense being a rail route. rail is able to carry far more cargo far more efficiently, the fuel costs per tonne are lower and your staffing requirements are a fraction. it may be more expensive to construct the route due to grade limitations. but it would be so much more efficient to operate going forwards
its not dying... they just need to dig a deeper path
Your "lake" low water pictures are actually the beachs along Panama City, which is part of the Pacific ocean. These low water pictures are known as low tide pictures. They are not pictures of exposed lake shore.
As long as we insist on buying everything from China and its neighbors we will have these problems.
The solution is simple, but implementation will not be simple.   Instead of dumping the water into the ocean, they can recycle it back to the lakes or into holding pools on the side of the canal.   This is the opportunity to fix this problem.
Don't believe it believe it's 100% political. There's no way they spend 5 billion dollars to Upgrade it just far to die a couple of years later. I'm sorry it's political.
What's a nautical mile?
If I did the math right, it would take approximately 50,000 kWh per ship to pump the water back up to the top of the lock, or about $6,000 if electricity costs the same as it does where I live (I know it doesn't - just for ballpark estimate). For 36 ships a day that works out to about 10% of the electricity consumption of Pamana City. So while they would need to build some infrastructure, it seems within the realm of feasibility. (Inputs: 200 million gallons per ship, raise 85 feet, panama city annual consumption 8,000 GWh).
This sounds like an excuse the WEF will be using trying to starve out the populations. Elites want us peasants to stop using their resources. I say this, what good are resources if there is no one to buy them..
Why no roads and, highways in Nicaragua!? Why only propose a canal with water poisoning issues?
Good try but you lost me at the idiotic assessment of lithium mining.  Sounds like a propaganda machine that ignores the enormous ecological toll placed on the countries within the lithium triangle.
Excellent video.
didnt the commie chinee buy it?dig outta this one commies
Wow instead of setting up water pump to transfer to canal from the ocean.  How greedy are government is.  I would be top priority to set it up.
Americans giving back the Panama Canal to Panama was so stupid
I have one word for you: “Solar pumped hydro”
Which uses more fuel: pumping water back up hill, or traveling the further distance? When water is scarce, pump water. When it's plentiful, use gravity.
I have a simple idea. A railway and pipeline crossing the country. It will be less than 100km long and can be built in a little more than a year. This alternative transport will allow ships to unload it's cargo on one side and either go through the cannal empty or load the containers from another ship that unloaded on the other side and return to where they came from, just with another load.   All ships have a "regular" route, so they always start and finish their journey at the same port. This railway will only cut the routes in half, making them double the amount of travels keeping the same productivity.  The same can be done to oil and gas ships.  Basically, the canal will only keep being used for cruise ships, RO-RO and military vessels
The rain that Panama was suppose to get, went to Los Angeles lol
0.85x perfect speed. 1x too fast
Panama has to get China for a mega project. To excavate the chanal that extra 26m deeper so only sea water can be used.
Dumb Panama
It seems so wasteful to dump that fresh water into the ocean. Its too bad they can't use the salt water to get a ship through the locks.
Oh no stuff from China won't git through... WE'RE  GONNA HAFTA MAKE OUR OWN STUFF ! WHAT A TRAGEDY.... OH THAT'S RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY THAT NOSE HOW TO MAKE STUFF....                              👃
LOOKS LIKE THE PEOPLE WILL HAFTA STOP DRIVING MORE WATER AND START DRINKING MORE BEER....                           🐰🤳🏽
Quit cutting down the rain forests
Operator corruption posing as climate change as usual,  this marvel of modern engineering didn't work for almost a century and all of sudden it can only handle 1/3 of the crossings because it rained a little less, if you buy that 1 ive got Ocean front property in West Virginia for you dirt cheap ! where did these lemmings get there degrees? A cracker jack box ? Pathetic...
Mine the lake's through way 1\16 of an inch will literally save a ton of water per ship.
Why can't seawater be pumped into the water elevation process ???? Much faster, less expensive and it would be preserving the fresh water. An easy solution guys. Why is it not being done ????????
Can they not pump the water back up the locks? At least on the end where the ship is descending and the water is all fresh water.
This sounds sped up and I hate it
Nice
25:09 only issue is that means you need 2 ships
Yemen just keeps bringing out W’s
I still am not conviced that climate has as much to do with it men wanting to move money around to gain control an use this power to do the evil things that have been happening for hundreds of years.
They should just use water from lake Gatun that it travels through.
Why is there no west coast naval base that we could use to deploy in Asia?
your bias is showing in all your videos lmao, absolutely no context as to why the Yemeni Hou this are doing what theyre doing so I'll say it: Under the Geno cide convention, any country thats ratified it are obligated to take measure to stop it
Reverse osmosis.
Reject modernity, embrace tradition.
Humm… *  The Panama canal will be vulnerable as a strategic target in the event of a major worldwide war or a terrorist could possibly blow up a LNG tanker within the locks.  Hummm…* alternative road and rail transport across  other isthmus means higher shipping costs for the same volume loads. 3 carriers versus 1.   4 loading points versus 2.  Hummm… would it not be possible to use piped in ocean water to feed the canal locks? We pump oil through hundreds of miles???    OPEN DOOR
THEYRE IDIOTS FOR FLUSHING THE FRESH WATER OUT INTO THR SALT WATER WVERY SINGLE TIME A SHIP HAS TO COME THROUGH...THEY SHOULD HAVE FOUND A WAY TO PUMP THE FRESH WATER BACK WITH THE FRESH WATER THUS LEAVING MILLIONS OF GALLONS THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE PREVENTING THE ENTIRE PROBLEM..IM SURE DROUGHT WOULD STILL SUCK BUT SEEMS LIKE A BAD IDEA JUST FLUSHING OUT ALL THAT FRESH WATER INTO THE SALT WATER.
could they pump seawater up to the locks instead of using lake water?
Why does the water in the bottom lock at each end need to be wasted by emptying it into the ocean?  Just pump it up to the canal above the locks.  Or even back to lake Gatun.  This seems such an obvious solution, I imagine there's some reason its not done.
Look at all that garbage!! 😢😢 humans are the reason for most of the planets issues!! Mother Nature keeps trying to get rid of us but we just keep making more!! We are what has ruined this beautiful planet!!
Isn't it amazing that so called global warming hasn't made the oceans rise? I guess somebody was full of shit!!!
Doesn't it seem reasonable that it would be cheaper to put in pumps and use ocean water to run the canal?
I enjoy all this content
Or use the ships power to run pumps
Recovery by pump on solar power
Dieses Video hat so starke Gefühle in mir hervorgerufen. Einfach unglaublich
Total reengineering needed. Must install a desalination plant using ocean water pumping the desalinated ocean water into the fresh water reservoirs.  The revenues being lost from the restrictions and the drought continues can shut down the canal all together.
What about building another canal through Nicaragua?
While building the new locks they noticed this problem why did they not construct holding tanks and pumps to reduce or eliminate the loss of water.
Why dont they just build a reservoir so the fresh water goes there instead of being pumped back into the sea and thrown away??
Mfw Panama chose to rest on their laurels for the better part of a century rather than plan ahead for potential problems.
It’s Panama,not america.
They need the technology from Israel on how to desalinate ocean water
Desalinate ocean water for either the canal or drinking water? el ninos and la ninas are both cyclical droughts happen.  They need to plan ahead.
change the microphone man . go back to the old one .its better
Battlefield 2042 has a nod to this fact. Theres a level on Lake Gatun, its dried out with container ships grounded.
So why not just pump seawater in to raise the level in all but the last freshwater lock instead of using water from the lake? Seems like an easy fix.
Why don’t they recycle the fresh water amount the 3 levels on both ends.
This would have happened even if the canal was not there. Alternatively the use of fresh water was the first mistake. In the end  it a design flaw .  Use salt water in the first dock each end.   This will save around forty percent of your water.
If the polar ice caps melt, according to those who are pushing the global warming agenda, then the Panama Canal will be ok.
Panama has been getting record rainfall levels in the past 3 decades.  Check your facts before you spew BS global warming comments.
Guess it’s time to build the proposed 2nd canal in Nicaragua I believe it was.
Start digging sea level Panama canal, now. (yea not easy) Climate change has just started, and it'll get way worse..  p.s. you'll need the fresh water elsewhere
Former Pres Carter must feel vindicated for divesting the US of that canal.
Stop eating the mic. You’re over driving it. Can hear it at 16 min. Sounds like I’m listening to damaged speakers and like you don’t care.
Howcould Carter be so stupid?  Giving control over any part of the world used by all to Latin America is a recipe for disaster.  Look at all their countries; they are run by corrupt governments whose own countries are mismanaged, whose infrastructure is substandard and poorly maintained and whose politicians pocket the money allocated for maintenance.
The two oceans should be used for the carnal  not the fresh water. And also the carnal can be dugout  for what they need. .
The Mexican cartel has entered the chat.
Ask a real scientist who actually studied global warming what the facts are. You can't blame everything on climate change.
15:50 the reason this is happening is because Israel is committing genocide. This was not the case before, Yemen uses this as a last measure of retaliation towards Israeli atrocities
10:10 Funny how the stats to back the hypothesis of Global Warming are often hypothetical. Maybe wait until the facts are in, rather than (semi)permanently publishing a guess which may well turn out to not be true. Reminds me of when the civil engineering guy claimed that Arizona was in a drought, but his data was a year old, and in reality Arizona had plenty of water at the time. Yall know that climate is always dynamic; right? I'm amazed that 40something% below average is the lowest rainfall they've ever had. Anyway, you gotta do your part; you can't wait until the facts come in, because they might not serve the propaganda well, so gotta state the claim whether it's true or not while you still have plausible deniability ... very scientific.
seems like all they need to add is a huge powerplant that drives equally huge waterpumps to save everything. 1 billion might be enough
Call me crazy but a if solution with a railroad across Mexico is feasible, why not just use the railroads across the US? Or is this railroad going to be big enough that it will drydock entire fully loaded ships from one coast to the other? That would be an impressive railroad. As far as offloading containers to be taken across the country on trains to be loaded onto another ship however it seems like it would be just as effective to do that across the US mainland.
Thanks!
Climate hoax
Time to shift to salt water....
Why not pump it back?
😂😂😂the USA still claims there is no climate change and the wasteful use of fresh-water for the Panama Channel is coming back to hunt the US 😂😂😂
This educational video is the internet at it's best. Thank you.
Extrapolating from the expected "time saved" am I correct that the time to cross the bi-oceanic corridor is estimated at about 4 days?
If they want to save fresh water, pump sea water up instead except the last lock to not mix sea water into the lake. It's got nothing to do with climate change propaganda.
More canals and roads = deforestation and species extinction
Around 1950 there was a proposal to use atomic bombs to blast a sea level canal across Nicaragua. Ah, the days of innocence...
Water recovery back into the lake. Problem fixed, it's time to upgrade...
It's a it's an American design system you know it doesn't work 😂😂😂
7:32 and you do know it's not really being replenished if they're dumping it into the ocean.
6:22 why would somebody do all of this it seems like a lot of unnecessary steps to just float something across some water
the design itself is flawed, why use fresh water when  you can use ocean water...=.=
I hope they put turbines on the "pump" really there is no need for pumping the water is always going down hill, but they can be using the potential energy of transferring to below them to the next lock and sea/ocean ⚡⚡⚡ Hmm 🤔 are there mineshafts in Panama? There is a cheap option for converting old mineshafts into gravity battries:   π  π  π   |||   |||  |||  🔋 🔋🔋 In which they can use to pump the water up stream from the lower locks in dry months... Anyway I'm sure they will find a way to solve their problem's
Sounds like it's time to find a way to capture and re-use the water..... or stop using the lake water and use ocean water.
Who told you we are gonna sell YOU our lithium?
The US never owned the Panama Canal - it was on a perpetual lease.
Our engineering capabilities have advanced a ton. It's so important for the global market so build a salt water canal. So we can stop wasting fresh water and having to deal with all the issues that come with what's connected to that. So I know it's a big project BUT it's so important for the global market so just make a 2nd fully salt water canal.
Well containers can also be transported by trains instead. However they might not have the same capacity.
People are blaming everything on climate change. Couldn't be the greed of sending too many ships for too many years and a massively inefficient design.
That Mexican rail link looks like a huge win-win for everyone.
Shippers are coming to the west coast and then putting cargo on rail bound for the east coast.
Can the water be pumped back into Lake Gatun instead of it being put into the oceans?
Desalination plants at both ends
This all assuming there will be a drought. There may not be
Solve two problems with one solution. Build a giant canal connected with the rio grande, right along Americas southern border. You wouldn't even need guards if you added hippos in. Built right, it would make back the investment and create lots of jobs.
The amount of US propaganda in this video is just staggering.
What is the status of the Northwest Passage through northern Canada?
The Panama Canal is dying because the United States after spending a fortune to construct it and countless lives lost to malaria etc., turned it over to Panama who simply aren't capable of running it properly.
The problem with "less of an issue" is that it is still an issue that needs to be addressed. And, thus, it will not be a solution period. We're not looking for bandaids on our problems. We are looking for a long-term solution to these problems. And, if our governments can't get their shit together, then I suggest the People rise up and take the power back.💯✊️
Just pump water between 1 and 3, leave 2 the same. No need for external water source.
I liked Jimmy Carter he seemed like he genuinely cared about people but giving away the Panama canal after the money and manpower the US poured into building it was an awful decision. Also basing your entire economy around one canal seems silly. What are they going to do if they build one somewhere else lol? The price reduction completion brings would deeply cut into your government's budget
Or they could just pump the fresh water back up to the lake. They have the money.
Sell your boats and buy planes 😅
PANAMA!... Panima, aa.
Well, if a canal like that is important, they can dig it deeper, right?
52 million gallons does not give any information besides "much". Its roughly 14M liters.  14 Million liters fill a volume of 14000 cubic meters to put it in picture. With the metric system you get at least the chance to put it in picture without using bathtubs or miles per eagle or some obscure unit. I would prefer you use it.  Not to say that its internationally accepted and the measurement system used in science and economics when discussing anything related.
Wait a minute. For the flat Earthers in the audience, isn’t there a faster route than what the globe theory people are saying?

It's almost impossible for shipping companies to save $1k per container by going over land through truck vs by water. It costs 20x more to ship a container by land vs sea...
The Panamanians should have risk assessed the reliance on the Canal and used a small amount of its incomes for 100 years in building its own railway for transferring containers across the short land distance between the two Oceans. Blah blah American comments trying to greenwash their poor design choices based on cheapest economics. The answer has always been to pump water from the seas both sides to level the canals!!  Yes, higher electricity costs -  there's always a price somewhere.😅but USA weren't interested in future fresh water needs of a central american country.
This channel makes so many stupid statements and presents them as facts, making a lot of propaganda and talks bs about countries the western world dislikes. But it always discusses very interesting topics. So its worth a view but if you're really interested always take a lot of the info with a grain of salt when its about politics.
Increase, well, they increase the size of the locks to carry bigger and bigger ships there lies to problem.. The man made reservoirs was never made or designed to carry that volume of water
Someone didn't take into consideration the amount of water consumption the new locks would have upon the Chagres River and Gatun Lake, i.e. bad engineering.
Good grief talk about disseminating rubbish information. By your own admission El Nino is regular and cyclical - this one may have been a bit drier but has lasted for a shorter time than expected. If this was ever going to be a problem they would start pumping water into the lock back up reservoirs (not mentioned in the over simplified schematic). The locks are always being updated and have just been so to allow larger ships through whilst retaining more water meaning a massive increase in tonnage. This is the absolute normal climate catastrophe drivel. There would be a reduction in traffic at the absolute worst , the Panama Canal is in a better state now than its ever been, it most certainly is not dying and is unlikely ever to do so. This whole video is Kindergarten level use of knowledge. I gave up 2/3 way through
The area around the channel could be redesigned to permit large amounts of ocean water to flow through rather than relying upon local lake waters.
Trucks????! Train ftw wtf.
Just pump the water back up. Ask the Dutch.
a friend from Panama says all this is bullshit by Bill Gates and his climate fanatics. False information
Maybe I'm thinking of it wrong but say with the current difference at the locks say 15-20ft, so every ship releases that amount of water. But if you increase the amount of locks a ship need to pass through to make the difference of lock height is say 5-10ft releasing alot less water.
WHY CAN'T PANAMA RECYCLE THE WATER WITH INVENTIONS TO USE WATER EVEN CLEAN AND PROCESS THE WATER SOMEHOW.. 80 YEAR OLD FROM THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS ISAIAH 2
Why do they not pump sea water into the first two and last two exit lift and drop sectors of the canal?  Thus using one half of the fresh water involved in the process!!!????
Yeah my dog got ran over by a truck due to 'climate change'......
I'm looking for information on what country has the contract to manage the Panama Canal.
Looks like Panama  cant keep it up after complaining they want control of it
You left out that Panama sold the Canal to China. Yes China owns the Panama Canal.
Maybe the United States could offer to help pay to correct the problem We do have the engineers and know how It could work a deal with Panama on a profit sharing partnership
Why can't they not build parallel locks for transferring water sideways to its sister lock who operate alternately raised and lowered instead of dumping water into the ocean side of the eastern and western ocean sides of their 1st gates saving water and doubling shipping traffic flows or for a more ingenious solution of building a ship elevator with two ships in a counter balancing wheel the same type as the Chinese have done as part of the three gorges dam with their commercial shipping when negotiating its hydro system navigation needs. from alternative proposals this far dealing with initial design and engineering short sighted view regarding increased traffic and natural weather cycles which is the same system that affects Australia's climate cycle of drought and flood along with increased freshwater demand from Panama's population growths from prosperity and standards of living being raised to western civilizations standards with political and geographic pressures mitigated it looks to be the cheapest and mutually beneficial solution for all financial interests parties.
Why instead of dumping the water in the ocean they just pump it back up to the reservoir?
Seems that the emerging alternatives to the Panama Canal are simply relieving the canal of traffic increases in the last decade or so. Nothing to worry about.
Climate change. The answer is climate change. Climate change is why I get up in the morning and why I cry at night.   But for real, we need Pan American NAWAPA infrastructure project to save ourselves and show good faith between neighbors.
"Sorry, we have to restrict water usage due to a drought.... well, unless you bribe us"  Yeah, that sounds about right. USA needs to annex the canal again and just pump ocean water tbh.
FWIW the USA should probably just take the canal back over. It's honestly nonsense that we ever gave it up.
Your ability to consider the entire picture in the global scope without a bias and with such detail is amazing. Excellent work.
It's amazing how Paraguay went from having no paved roads, to having 3000 km of paved roads all thanks to Chinas Belt Road Initiative. The Bi-Oceanic Corridor which was funded by China should be in operation soon and cut the travel time by up to 2 weeks from shipments coming from Asia and Oceania.
why trucks for the bi-oceanic corridor? wouldn't trains be the more economic choice long term?
Man, this video could’ve been a two minute concise explanation, but you drew it out as long as you could
Isn't the answer for the water problem to engineer a reserve that the fresh water is moved to instead of dumping into the ocean. The water need be flushed back into the proper lock using electricity for pumping instead of new water. It is windy and sunny and the usage would be steady. This sounds like something that renewable energy projects might actually be good for. If panels and turbines (or preferably nuclear powered)  pumps that shifted, instead of dumping the water there would be way more fresh water for the people.
2:30...the new millenium did NOT start on Jan 1, 2000.  It began just like the century and the decade and every example of counting to 10 I ever heard of.  With 1.  Jan 1, 2001.  Unless you count to 10 by starting with 0.  Then it might make sense.  Sure, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  Just ignore the 11 numbers in that count to 10.  I wonder what people did in year 0.  Nothing apparently.
Why can't they build a salt water pipeline, instead of using fresh water?
Sea level dropping? We need to melt more arctic ice. Hurry!!  Just kidding. That can't raise the sea level more than 4 inches.
Would it not make sense to use the water from when water levels need to be lowered to sea level to pump into a water treatment/filtration plant for drinking water or similar? Or would there be too many contaminants to consider? Or is that already being done and it's just not been mentioned?
Trucks, trucks, trucks - carbon emissions, road fatlities etc. At 24 minutes a little rail is mentioned. At 30 minutes - a little rail is mentioned again. One track of rail is about the same cost as one lane of bitumen to construct. With proper container transfers, rail is an efficient way - better than roads. USA should have this worked out - and faster than shipping - if we need to think about speed with unrefridgerated goods. Likewise, a trans-eurasian fast rail route could take some carbon emissions from air flights too.
How about just pumping the last locks water into a storage tank and then pumping it back in when needed
You lost me at "climate change". What I really wanted to know is how the Panama Canal deals with racism.
China Vietnam War, China Korean War, did China occupy the land of Vietnam, Korea? Not really. Americans need to stop treating themselves like human beings every day, okay? In the last 50 years, has there been no American soldier in any war? Only Russia-Ukraine war, Israeli-Palestinian war no American soldiers. That is because the American soldiers in front of the Russian soldiers are not anything is a water cannon, the Americans too want to send troops to the Israeli-Palestinian battlefield, only to send troops in, it is equivalent to announcing to 7 billion people that the American soldiers in front of the Russian soldiers is a water cannon. I'm sure it's the same in front of Chinese soldiers. Not to say that the United States is not capable, it means to tell the Americans, do not always put themselves as people in front of the nuclear powers. Americans pillage the world every day and think they are gods.
Solution, desalination of sea water pumped in to the locks for ships entering the canal.  Cost of desalination taken up as new fee for transit through the canal.  Project funded by the IMF and money paid back to the IMF over time.
I'd love to listen to your information however, your rate of speech is so fast my tablet has an echo, which in turn garbled the information you attempted to provide.
Seems to me that manufacturers should begin spreading out their manufacturing facilities.  It's  not like they don't  have the money.
Was the possibility of a sea level canal ever considered  for the Panama Canal? I know the prospect of clearing and grading would be a grueling and expensive task, but was it ever considered even in theory?
I have news for the people of Panama, if the US needs to use that in a wartime emergency they will not be asking, they will use it.
US built the panama canal. We should have kept it. As soon as we gave it to panama, they quit unkeep on it. Now that we are paying to use it, they want us to come and pay to fix it and maintain it while they collect all the profits. The US needs to take it back, we built it, just lease it from Panama.
why not use pumps to put the water back in the lake, instead of dumping it into the sea?
The sun will eventually explode, and thus the wars in the middle East will eventually end.
well if there is global flooding, start building huge desalinization plants. plenty of sea water.
Drinking water from the same lake thousands of ships burning diesel travel through??? 🤢
Build that road through Panama, or pump used water back to the lake.
Your audio sounds f’d up in this video. Maybe it’s just me? Idk
Wow, get to the point.
5:28 The narrator uses the word "pump" to describe the way the water is moved from one lock to the next. This is a bit misleading as the water is just released through valves, meaning the water can only follow gravity down to the next lock. Only being used once as it travels from the lake to the ocean. The video eluded to this, but if you didn't already know the system it was not very clear.  Using pumps to move water up to the next lock could be a partial solution, but the energy and time to move the amount of water to have any noticeable effect would be substantial.
Who decided to use fresh water for the pumping process to begin with ? Lol a military power that didn't care about the local population.. just invest the money to pump from the ocean.
This channel is such an imperialism apologist. No historical context whatsoever
Why would lower displacement ships use less water? Seems like if they were displacing more water, then there would be less water needed to fill the lock.
Rationing the canal is the correct move here. Shipping dollars whilst a big deal is not immediate life or death.  Human beings can only live 3 days with no drinking water.  This is a no contest decision panama's government is actually, in a rare show of decency and actual governance, realizing power (money) is worthless when compared to actual life, literally life. Without drinking water life stops. It ends. Simple as that.  So good on them
So....why isn't Panama building their own "intercontinental railway" if that is the answer?
Should be a train, not truck.
it sounds like when the Locks are being emptied, the excess water needs to be pumped back into the lake. it would involve quite a bit of pipe work and a few pumps. no problem!
Any country that sells its soul to the Chinese is doomed!
"green"...😂
No matter what is done it will seriously impact the environment! All so China can ship its cheap garbage products to the world to end up in landfills!
Let’s hope they don’t mow down the Rainforest to transport goods!
Why can the fresh water not be re-used? There is no need to waste it by emptying into the see, why not just pump from lock 1 to lock 3 for the next ship in the cycle. The only objection I can see is introducing salt to the fresh water environment, but the rains when they come should make that a non issue. And I'm sure there's worse than that discharged from large ocean going vessels. Just my two-penneth, though I'm sure someone will put me right. 😁
The sound of your video's have been lower quality lately.
20:00 in the city of Letica, there's a road leading into the brazilian city of Tabatinga
Fewer words at a slower rate would be welcome. The information was interesting.
The alternatives to the Canal are intriguing, but the fact is that the canal is the best option on the table or in the pipeline, as it were. Those container ships are massive and the time for transit is but a blip. If everything is operating at peak levels then nothing else beats it. Road or rail would involved the transfer of containers from one mode of transport to another and back again. And passing through several sovereign countries would invite shenanigans. The problem is complicated but the pressure at the chokepoint can be somewhat reduced with the alternative pathways. The problem(s) of the Canal needs to be solved, whether it's climate change, geography, or politics. But that bi-oceanic highway in SA is awesome!!! I'm no civil engineer and my understanding of the complexities may be limited, but I have been to the Canal a few times and I'll tell ya, it is a marvel.
USA stole panama from Colombia
Wtf happened to the audio quality
Could they use solar power and turbines on the water flowing out of the locks to power pumps? These pumps could then move the water back to the lake? Big infrastructure project? Yes, but looks like we need to do something sooner rather than later. They could tax the biggest polluting ships to pay towards the project.
It sounds like rather than using fresh water from the lakes, they need to start using the sea water via pumping it into the first two locks instead.
US propaganda. Why don't you mention the illegal slaughter in Nicaragua by the Reagan administration. The world's most corrupt government is the US's. They spend their entire time, and our tax dollars on trying to be the head honcho of the world. Any leader who stands up to our govt. gets the ol coup treatment. Fortunately for people like Daniel Ortega, the sun is setting on our country. And it can't happen too soon. How about letting other countries do their own thing while we spend our tax dollars on a national health care system, free college, child care for working parents, affordable housing, and bringing industry home. Oh no, can't have that. Have to spend trillions on our pathetic attempts to rule the world. And believe you me they are pathetic. We're not happy unless we're committing a genocide somewhere.
The land grab of Panama presented itself where it could be tored from then Colombia. Nice choice or words there.
Ah, don’t forget to add the additional longer routes being flown by not flying thru the Siberian air corridor. I love the west imposed iron curtain 2! Waste more fuel by flying around vast continent like Asia
It’s got nothing to do with the so called climate change  ! It’s got everything to do with human incompetence …
There is no such thing as “climate change” the climate by its very nature is cyclic. The problem is that people don’t comprehend that the multitude of factors and their effects on each other makes long term climate projections impossible.
Only a dye in the wool soulless capitalist would even make it a choice between drinking water and earning dollars. There’s not even a choice! Plus clean up all that environmental damage.
Stop with the ridiculous “climate change” narratives.  Panama added a new lane to the canal for larger ships and didn’t add an additional source for water.  Yes, there is a drought but that is not the problem with the canal.  They’d have plenty of water even in a drought if they hadn’t added the third lane.
I am sure the Americans wish that they would have a decent railway system.
I wouldn't drink that water, with ships and all the garbage in there, no thank you,  and while the water is dropping go clean it up
Am I really supposed to be worried about the problems of the most inapprpriately wealrhy folks in the western hemisphere?  If it wasnt for that canal those 4 million people would be living in shantys and surving on guinea pig.
I think the canal in Mexico will be the best alternative as it will also be way north than any of the ones ins South America
Why not use seawater totally
The Panama Canal has the environmental problem. A bigger problem is that the new RORO container ships, with automated shipping, do not fit through the canal. This faster, cheaper shipping method made the canal void after the last canal shipping lane expansion. WE consume and move too many goods for the Canal capabilities. Also, many of the new US Navy ships are too big for the canal. It costs too much to expand the canal. And, what if they retrofit the canal for the new larger ships then different shipping methods than so much reliability on maritime and the expansion project  once complete is obsolete again? Panama must concentrate on keeping a piece of the pie because it's neighbors have good ideas. And, forget about how it was once the only shipping option. I hope the folks working on expansion keep a firm grip on the environmental impact to some of these Nations very beautiful areas. They are beautiful because we have left them alone.
The US should have bought it off Gran Colombia back in the day...  By doing so, perhaps Colombia would still be in possession of Venezuela...
Nice
When you get to the point where you are unloading containers putting them on rails and reloading them, surely there are railways between Texas and California that are already in existence?
Well explained video once again.
I love how in the animation the water is laying on top of a cushion of nondisplaced air.  As if physics does not exist!
Not any more...!!  You for got to mention 🇲🇽 MEXICOS.. the new 2023  ITSMO DE TEHUANTEPEC located between OAXACA and VERACRUZ.. 10 TIMES BIGGER AND WIDER..divided by two Oceans the PACIFIC & ATLANTIC The Panama canal is now obsolete. "BE SPECIFIC DONT LIE..!!"
There is ZERO evidence that the droughts in Panama have gotten worse.   There IS evidence that the Panama Canal is being used many times more than it ever has in history.   That's the problem....NOT FAKE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT ISN'T HAPPENING.   Stop making bogus claims.  This is a man made system and will require a man made solution.   Build a new more robust canal instead of relying on 120 year old technology.
Ground troops would be an inefficient way to have war with china. I imagine we’ve armed Taiwan with drone and tech to keep china fighting a war of attrition that makes it not currently cost efficient to invade that country. But I’m fully making things up as I go
I love the video of the parts of Panama City with the low tide having absolutely nothing to do with any drought.  Great propaganda for this video.  Get your geography and editing straight next time.
The Panama Canal was dead on arrival when they finished the last expansion.
Your  introductory comments are so biased and misleading , I wont bother watching further
Corruption is ramped ...If Panama  had not black mailed the Congress men in the vote to return the canal  It would have still been run by the USA... And we would not have this issue..... Ill bet the US war ship dont wait ....
Your mic is peaking hard. It's maxing quite high too. Really had to adjust volume. Kinda surprising for a channel already with 7 mil subs. You should consider investing in a new setup or adjusting settings.
Well now im more depressed, no matter we have Valium and Xanax,lol🎉😂
"Climate Change"
As anyone should be able to see, Jimmy Carter was the incompetent gift that keeps on giving.  This was inevitable once Carter signed control over to Panama.  And you left out the fact that China controls the ports on either end of the canal.
“Climate change” my ass.
There won't be war with China, because the US already said that they do not guarantee Taiwan's independence
More western propaganda regarding Nicaragua
I never I thought I would side on the side of Zuckerberg. It is difficult to watch him being railroaded. Disgusting theatre to support censorship legislation.
Why don't they use the water from the sea?
Good luck 😂 im sure it will follow the ancient plan of being gone eventually like all idiotic builds. The amount of death that thing has caused through history is insane. Its only for rich individuals anyway, so it doesn't effect anyone who doesn't need it like myself.
The processing on your voiceover sounds horrible this video.. Sounds like you're talking through an old wired telephone. It's even distorted for the most parts.   Maybe look into that for the next video?
4:30 You should have mentioned that Panama would not even exist as a country if it wasn't for the canal. It used to be part of Colombia. When separatists declared the isthmus independent, Teddy Roosevelt immediately officially recognized them as an independent state because of his interest in building a US canal through that land.  Edit: Roosevelt also sent US warships to blockade both Panamanian coasts so that Colombia couldn't send in their troops to restore control; and southern Panama's impassable Darien Gap prevented the Colombian army from driving up there, too. The new Panamanian government was naturally grateful to the US and granted the US a perpetual lease for control of what would become the Canal Zone.
Train tracks alongside the canal..?
so instead of releasing the water, lets pump it,  12 ships a day ≈2.4*10^9 L,height ≈26 m → yearly energy needed ≈  1300 GWh (and this is the worst case scenario). Typical nuclear reactor ≈ 7000 GWh per year. So fundamentally i see no reason for Panama Canal to stop working
they could just rebuild the canal. funded by goverments and shipping companies together. still billions of $, but less, than the economical price in the long term.
Yeah, every battle ends. But each one ends in it's own way. In other words, it brings change
I so hate these clips that now get AI doing the audio part. It’s so difficult to listen to with the god awful (and this one esp. it’s also grossly camp; yuk) accent, it’s so hurts the ears and make us all feel sick. Bring back real people!!!! Well I guess, only people that don’t talk like this actually.
Or, instead of dumping into the ocean on both sides, create two new reservoirs to maintain a self contained system, where one is pumped empty to raise the level, then filled again. Keeping the entire thing soft water only. Don't need to stop operations until both reservoirs are built, then close down the time needed to connect them to the canal. And simply then create an overflow for the lakes to dump excess water to the ocean instead. Keep both the drinking water for the population, and the business provided by the canal without needing to chose one or the other in periods of low rainfall.
Would the use of the united states railways not be feasible to connect the east coast ports to the west?
As commented above, no water is pumped in the Panama Canal, it's all gravity fed. The new set of locks are hugely larger that the original set, to take much larger ships, but they use 7% less water. 60% of the water in the new locks is reutilized and never leaves the system.  When talking about all of the different projects in other countries, what you didn't mention in the video is that Panama has two Canals; one wet and one dry. The Dry Canal is a very efficient container cargo train that joins the ports on the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea (there is no Atlantic in Central America). The Dry Canal train transports goods across the 80 km isthmus much faster than any of the options in other countries, and has been running for many years, so all the logistics and other issues are well-proven.  To increase the water capacity of the lakes, Panama is looking at options for more reservoirs. As mentioned in the video, the vast majority of the population of Panama is near the Canal, and the sites of proposed dams and lakes are in low population density areas.
very informative
get to the point! Screw it not worth  my time!
What a non-shock. Another foriegn policy failure from the Carter  administration. Wonder if President Carter ever looks back at the chaos in his wake & doubts his actions? Probably not, just like Biden is causing problem after problem for the western world but doesn't realize it. -Unless Biden's incompetence is by design. At least Carter wasn't a Machivellian villain.
Pump sea water up the canal to a reservoir from both sides and just use the fresh a supplement. Stupid idea to begin with to depend on freshwater.
It will go on as long as gaza is being attached but occupying forces
It would be interesting if China ever signed a military and economic alliance with Panama
Why can't they use ocean salt water? There is an unlimited supply.
There is a sick conspiracy that Gazza is going to be used as a new artery for western capitalism to profit, but ultimately less is more past the cost of extended travel miles and days onto the consumer. People buy the most useless things let them pay.
so this is an old video?
See, back in the day, if you fucked with the British Empire’s tea shipments, they would send an army to fight you and/or seize the territory. Now it’s “pwease don’t shoot at our merchants. Stop iitttt.” Then they toss some bombs and call it a day. D-Day, take their weapons, then go home and sell them to your own people for a fat stack of cash.
Truths within a big lie is still bullshit
Climate change, climate change, yada yada yada.
What idiots.pump the water back in lock 2 to let the ahip in from sea level and reuse it to level between 1 and 2. Its.not rocket science. Stop emptying the lake, reuse what water is already in the locks. This is absolute moronic lunacy
Just consume the basics like water, foods and housing. Do not buy more stuffs. Human race will be on decline due to greeds, power hunger.
Climate change.........  A political football, used to control weak minded people.   It's 100% total bullshit, but the propaganda has worked wonders on this brainwashed younger generation.  Carry on.
Or we could just reduce our consumption of stuff, and be better off for it.  Same for the planet.
But but but climate change isn’t real
Sounds to me like they need to build holding ponds they can pump that sea level lock into and reuse the water. I'm sure there's some engineering challenges but hell it's the 2020s we should be able to solve engineering challenges,
I would love to be a part of building a Mexican trans-continental train super highway! Too cool. Uruguay thru the Andes sounds cool, too.
Yeah that does sounds like a pickle indeed.  Tho why trucks? Isn´t trains more efficient?  Or is there an other reason not to go with trains? Also why pump the fresh water from the lift gate into the sea? could they not build a basin to pump the water into instead?  I know 52 MN water is alot to pump but surely there is a tech solution for it!?
Forgive my ignorance. As a non military person, if the US is concerned about threats from China, won’t the US make sure that she is prepared on the west coast, surely a much shorter route, without having to consider using the Panama Canal ?
Dragline dig the lakes deeper and have more capacity when filled
The video was interesting but Im giving you a DISLIKE because the Title is very misleading from the content of the video
12:50  Restricting load sizes makes no sense and actually makes the situation worse.  The locks only hold a fixed volume of water and have to lift/lower the same height regardless.   The most water they would consume would be to cycle them with no ship in the lock at all.  To minimize water use, they should want the largest, heaviest ship, displacing the most water possible.
great video at usual!  🤗 um, the audio tho . .    😢
Lithium wont remain the rare element everyone wants as new types of batts will come on line soon and these new ones wont wear out and will be able to recharge in perpetuity.
Dont worry bout patagonia either as it was mostly bought up by the likes of ted turner and sylvester stallone. Ranches it takes days to cross there so large.
Well, all they need do is wait another 10 yrs and therell ne no more amazon.
To the ''Swiftie wannabe'' narrator, you are American, how about using our form of measurement. Instead of kilometers, WE use MILES.
Ive an idea.....open all the locks and let the two oceans level out.😂
28:15 Oh that poor sap
Why can't they add pumping stations on the final locks and pump the waste water back to the reservoir? I would think it would be cheaper than adding reservoirs and much quicker to implement. Ask the US to invest in a nuclear plant to run it and issue a discount on US shipping and free priority positions for US warships in return for some period, like 50 years.
And how about no one ever thought to just recycle each pond / lock water into an extra reservoir then pump it back into the upper one 🤷
11:22 Or maybe buy some large pumps and starting conserving the fresh water in the lake instead of pissing it all away each time a ship passes through 🤦‍♂
like so many things these days greed will play a big part in its downfall
Why not pump the water dumped into the ocean back into the lake?
How would displacing less water make it use less water?
Not because of climate change, all weather and climate happens in cycles. Goes back and forth indefinitely.
the solution here is water desalination, its expensive in energy but you can make up for it in fees to account for the price
It rains plenty in Panama. 2023 being drier means nothing, check the previous years, it rained too much. Stop lying
If instead of making a proper canal, we just blasted away at the land until the 2 oceans met, would we get a giant version of those viral videos we see when they dig a trench on a beach?
Orrrrr pump the water back up to the lake rather than dumping it into the ocean
Why is it they always go for the climate change instead of the actual problem of over population and over irrigation of the newly claimed land. There is always droughts and EL Nino's and EL Nina's and the time that it now takes for the waters to be made up. Nature has don it in the past so the only explanation is over population not specifically climate change.
Why not build one more lock at the beginning and pump sea water into it ?
Surely this could be fixed by building pools next to the locks and pumping the water from the lock into those pools and then visa versa? Wpuld mean you only lose water from evaporation.
Could the water on the Atlantic lowest gate be pumped up back to the lake? It would be a huge engineering project but could potentially lower the water usage by half.
Ok, so we need to stop buying stuff 🙄 Right, our consumerist economy stopping buying stuff 🤪
Calling Lithium "Green" is so FUNNY. Also, why don't they pump the water back up to the lake instead of discarding it?
climate change is at it again vecause el nino is ending down there and la nina is taking over. in fact it is raining there as I type this post and is expected to rain 4 of the next 8 days
If Panamanian Authorities fail WAKEUP, they will be destined to LOSE a Great Deal of Financial Benefits. Two possible Solutions would be: ▪Develop a Pumping System to compensate for a loss of Gravity Fed Water. ▪Develop a Massive Transportation Rail System whereas Panama is still the Shortest Distance between the Atlantic & Pacific Oceans. If Panama fails to do Something, they'll lose Billions in Revenue once other Transportation System become Developed & Completed in other Countries. 😢
Excellent Video. It answered So many questions.  Thanks
This video is amazing. Can we check the sources used for it anywhere? I mean the numbers for water usage on a single passthrough, the water usage for each avg Panamenian, etc.
Biden just gave the canal away...
So what's stopping them from setting up some separate reservoirs and just have some massive pumps constantly pumping water up to them to be used in the locks? edit: never-mind, I thought about it more, this would end up putting salt water up into the fresh water. I think there would have to be some separation of some kind between the stages.
I am very much a novice on this topic so this may be a really stupid idea. But could you use the ports on the west and east cost of America and build a speedy railway system that could transport the goods from one side of the country to the other? So instead of having the ships go all the way around South America, they could just drop it off at the closest port and have it transported by train? Again, I know very little about this so forgive me if this is very stupid lol
You say "real life" but in real life taiwan is part of china. Hard pass for this warmongering shit.
So they will have to pump sea water into the reservoirs and gravity feed it back to lift the ships.
Millions of American dollars and priceless American lives were lost making that modern marvel, ONLY to have a phkn democrat give it away out of some simplistic and stupid sense of altruism. Leave it to a democrat to phk things up. Take a look around you now, then thank the Potato-in-chief. 😂
Climate change is real. Climate always changes. Period. Forever! Don’t blame it on global warming. Don’t fall for the convenient lie. Climatologists who aren’t milking their incomes from the narrative are happy to tell you that we have no idea what or why the climate is doing or will do. Don’t fall for the WEF propaganda!
RLR mics seems off in this video
The war in the Middle East will eventually end? Sure, it has to - to make way fo rthe next one and the one after that and ... (There was a reason why one only lasted six days ...)
Chinese company will make the Nicaragua canal, wow good luck! if they are building a tofu canal.
Well it easy, but not so easy, they will have to spend some money and build a water system in which they turn ocean water to fresh water like swcc is doing.
Very informative. thank you
if the government hadn't destroyed the manufacturing in america this wouldn't be a problem
No mention that the Houthis are trying to enforce a blockade against Israel, to prevent their genocide of the Palestinians?
China is the problem

What about draining the lake and have the water level the same as sea levels? Or a different path away from the lake?

Why cant you pump the ocean through there?  Wtf?
Why wouldn't they just pump the fresh water back into the reservoir...?
David Lee Roth tried to warn us, the only way he knew how...
Why did they make the bi-oceananic corridor a road instead of a train rail across south America
Tbh adding a pumping system to the bottom lock to pump it back to the lake would solve this
Tuned out when he started pushing the climate change bs
"the Climate Change! The climate change!"  Proceeds to describe El Niño as the cause 🤦‍♂️🤦🤦‍♀️
36:08
All they need to do is use the existing locks and instead of one ship...place in two ships...side-by-side in that narrow lock....then let each of them exit carefully out individually into each lock or..into the narrow canal. They can put a protective separation barrier in each lock to keep ships from drifting into each other. Is it rough, extra work...yes...is it doable...yes. Does it double the amount of ships thru the canal per day...yes. Thank you and you're very welcome.
Well, doesn't the US have forward leading bases all over the globe? Can't part of the Pacific Fleet deploy to Guam?  I get that the canal s having issues and it's a vital structure, but creating an undercurrent of paranoia is not very productive. Also treating the Middle East as a minor problem that will resolve soon and allow Suez traffic freedom is over simplification at its finest.  Probably just stick to explaining the engineering and not the politics, or meteorology. This is not the 1st El Niño.   This is a drought, not El Niño. Guess climate change isn't a hoax, huh?
EVERYONE IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS SHORT ON SENCE. ITS ALL PATHETIC. LIKE LITTLE KIDS THEY KILL EACH OTHER BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES.  I TAKE PITY ON EVERYONE OF YOUR MOTHERS.
dang i didnt know panama was becoming african
this video is dumb.  if you think the red sea crisis will magically end, you probably haven't been paying attention to your history.
Why trucks??!?! Ffs, trains!!!!
Some logic is missing here. But i think it can be solved by digging wider and deeper canal, and let the sea water flow freely
It’s political . You a government shill.
Why Panama doesn't build a transoceanic train or highway?? It would be much cheaper, and then update the channel
It’s always going to be needed.
or just add pumps, they make billions surely some pumps  can be economically viable  resolve the issue heck add just to the outer locks and when there is sufficient water they can add more for faster  transit.
The idea of a huge roadway for hundreds of roadtrains across South America displacing forest and Andes mountains is the opposite of "green". The Mexico rail route makes a LOT more sense.
Too important to die.
War doesn't seem to benefit anyone except for the very wealthy.
Why don’t they alter the ocean facing locks to recycle the water?
There is another choice.  You will need ice breakers.   It might be easier to break ice than trying to solve the issues with these canals or bottlenecks.
As soon as trump is elected again, he starts digging. borderwall has not worked, but a big deep canal will. 😂
Emphasis on so called "climate change" negates your credibility. A couple drier seasons thzn usual doesn't mean panic over the imminent death of the canal.  The Mexico proposal does sound interesting though.
Ünpredictable climate change?????? What kind of BS is that? You lose credibility when you say stupid stupid things like that.

The water shifts, the earth shifts, the rails are old, the trucks have many recalls, however the highways belongs to the Trucks and drivers of that truck,  Cars NEED to slow down, Stop switching lanes and breaking other traffic rules/laws, there are traffic violations for "following to close"  of another vehicale, allow trucks the right-of-way, when the driver of a car CANNOT SEE The TRUCK DRIVER SIDE VIEW MIRROW,  THE CAR IS TO CLOSE BEHIND the truck, and the driver CANNOT SEE YOU, driver of cars. In 2017-18 Truckers were fired/let go due to medical or retirement. The younger truckers with approx. 1-8 yrs.  experience filled some of that shortage during the worst times of covid-19, and stated that they were enjoying, learning into their career, and making good money, then the lay-offs, again. While some more experienced truckers, U.S. truckers, were protesting, about the 2020 election, even going to Canada, disturbing some of  their peace and, then lay-offs again😢. I love truckers because they bring us goods, everyday food, and love to see them on the road, helping us fulfill or needs and wants. They are sacrificing being without their families, and their own lives when car drivers really do not know or care about driving safely.❤
Sooo Lucus was right. Star Wars Phantom Menace main storyline is about trade federation and blockage is the main threat of the galaxy …
The audio in this one kinda sucked ngl
Bet on Mexico instead! The transnational rairoad systen from the gulf of mexico to the pacific is already in full service and the military is control of the operations. Cheaper, better, faster!  Viva Mexico gringo bitches!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3:30 7th Fleet: Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!  Can you hear me now?
is it possible to pump water back up the locks?
If built in Mexico….keeping the cartels at bay will be a challenge.  Mexico will have to have an army force that is loyal to the gov’t, and capable of fighting off the cartels.  Where money can be made…the cartels show up.
Joe Biden is a moron.
9:20 ‘before climate change was well understood’ …unless you’re a global player with a vested interest in people who think weather is supernatural.
Why don’t you just pump water from the ocean into the first locks? Problem solved.
With global warming, the Northwest Passage is an important seasonal alternative.
They forgot to mention that the only ships passing though the Red Sea being targeted by the Houthis are those belonging to Israel, the Untied States, Great Britain and other countries supporting Israel's genocide in Gaza.  Ships belonging to other countries, including those from China and Russia which are not supporting the genocide are free to pass.
Introduce WARPUCT. War pollution control act.
Not a very good graphical display of the locks, and is not unique to the Panama canal as you say, if it were displayed correctly.
Soooo much repetition... does no one proofread the script?
Just did the Panama canal in December, it was an incredible experience but I learned that it is hot as shit year round lol
I didn't know that the canal uses fresh water.  Wow.
Simple, take some of the 4 billion in annual revenue and the illegal corrupt graft money and hire some engineers to figure out a way to save water.Don't look to America for help,we have our hands full with a roque President and an open border.
it’s not climate change, just unpredictable weather events….
If I'm not mistaken, this video is blaming the drought but the drought is such a large issue only because they built the third lane that the US planned to build before giving the canal to Panama but neglected building the additional dam that was supposed to accompany the building of the third lane.
I still wonder why america cares about taiwan?
Interesting video but it would be more honest on your part if you specified that ships intercepted by the Houthis are only of countries supporting the genocide in Gaza
Is it possible to recycle the water from the panama canal locks and place the water in pools, reservoir or under water containers pumps somehow to use the lake rain water?😮
Dam the canal on either side keep the fresh water in its own channel underneath the ocean water in giant concreted storm drains & connect the 2 oceans and just utilize the gates as the gate toll fee . Won’t have to dry up their fresh water supply and torture their locals / the ecosystem down stream
The Houthis have the USA and puppet UK by the throat. The USA can't even beat Russia or protect the Texas border.
Yap Yap Yap.
Engineers are so stupid.  Reroute the pumps of fresh water to sea water.  Wake up!!!!
Same scenario as the hoover dam. Blame  climate change and say when they built it they didn't count on lack of rain,,,,,, blah, blah, blah. 100 years ago,,, did they plan on today's increased shipping traffic??? Not the same as 100 years ago,,,,,  Yeah,,, blame climate change but forget facts.
I Have An Engineering Solution That Would Be Net Zero Cost (Utilizing Renewable Free Hydro Energy) - Paid Completely By A Small One Time Fee Levied On Shippers (Exorbitant Bribes To Jump The Line(s) Will No Longer Be Necessary) - Environmentally Safe With No Risk Of Salinating The Lakes(s) Sources - Full Upgrade Project Completed Via Component Installation Within Ninety Days - The Panama Canal Would Then Operate At Full Capacity While Using LESS THAN TWENTY PERCENT Of The Past Fresh Water In Total. That Is Correct As You Read! Less Than Twenty (20) Percent Total Bidirectional Fresh Water Usage And No Risk (Actually Much Less Than Current!) Of Saltwater Entering  And Contaminating The Lake Source.  Take Me SERIOUSLY! STOP Over Thinking And Start Undertaking A Resolution To The Issue At Hand.... El Nino.Proof .... One Trimester Solution!
Good time for a clean-up!
The B1M construction podcast just did an episode on the Panama Canal.  Not surprised at all the QAnon morons denying climate change.
More climate change nonsense. More intelligent people refer to this problem as WEATHER.
Interesting video, but down voting because you mentioned climate change.
Most RLL videos are AI fakes -- so easy to tell -- the AI reader  voice talks too fast to understand what he is even saying.  No pauses.   It's not just a dumb human.  The robot makes all kinds of mispronunciations, further demonstrating an utter lack of comprehension of the subject matter.  If it says RLL, skip it  -- not only fake new but AI version of fake news.  Every place in the world is empty - that's their ridiculous thesis.  check it out!
There’s no man made global climate change, there is today solving tomorrow’s problems
Very "clever" decision to use fresh water for this system!
So, by design, the supply chain gets disrupted.  Hmmmm, just like Klaus Schwab said
Excellent Presentation
I’m surprised there was no mention of the Northwest Passage.
Wow, a real world example of how water consumption matters.
Water is drying up from the entire earth due to global warming, which is caused by cutting too many trees from the forest, even in my country of about 300 rivers, some already dried up compare the amount of water they fifty years ago.
US needs to rebuild the Panama canal again. Then the  democrats can give it away again. Just like Clinton giving away the NASA HIGH PRICED DEVELOPED GPS SYSTEM to China to help them farm. Now they can guide their missiles accurately. Just like FDR giving much of Europe to Stalin. Such intelligence. Go figure.
why can't they pump water from the sea and de-salt it with machines.
Don't worry, world! El Niño is not a new event and its effects will not last forever. If this year rains begin late, let's say in May or June, in the last semester of 2024 the Panama Canal will have its regular 36 passages per day.
Panamas ideas to use even more fresh water for the canal is simply not sustainable. Why do they pump the used water into the sea anyway? But it would be easier and cheaper if Panama builds a railway: I would be shorter than the railway projects in Colombia and Mexiko.
WARNING!!! This video contains all  you've ever wanted or didn't want to know about The Panama Canal. Worth at least a couple of watches at minimum IMHO...
So - they want a road accross southamerica through several banana republics for transportation? why not build the road.. you know.. besides the panama canal? Or thorugh another State there like  Costa Rica? Nicaragua? Guatemala...?
So... they need a water reclamation system to reuse the water in each lock...  In the Sinai, companies will get fed up and hire PMCs to deal with Yemen and the terrorists.
You say the Panama Canal works completely differently, and then just describe a lock system which has been used for centuries?
Where is the second canal for larger ships?
AFAIK they do not use pumps - the whole system is gravity fed - that is why the fresh water is lost.  The solution is simple to define if technically difficult to implement.  Actually do use pumps and send the water back up to the upper lock.  Biological and salt contamination is why you don't want it back in the upper lake.
For a minute there, I assumed you were smart…
Makes you wonder why they don't use some sort of tank system to capture the water from the low locks and pump it back up into the lake.  Yes, it'd cost electricity to pump the water up 85 feet, but it'd prevent the water from being wasted.
Wait, ain't that Neon Knight from Witcher 3 vids I subscribe to?
There are 3 trade routes... (Sad Brazil noises)
Nicaragua may want to look at creating their own canal. With Lago Cocibolca, they may be able to do it. Not good to have China involved. New government would also help for the country.
Climate change bs
I live in the north of Belgium, a region that historically tried to get rid of water. But latelly we need to keep that water. Problem is all the structure is adapted to get the excess water to the sea as fast as possible. And there are still not many solutions for the draught months that now start to happen. Panama also needs to start creating a better system to store rain water. Ideally they should re-use the water.
Why not just build pumps and use sea water?
Also shipping solution won’t be replaced by land transport alone
Remember if you think this is wasteful use of water: think about how much drinking water we use when we go to the bathroom…
Call me crazy but a heavy ship displaces more water therefore using less to get it to the same water level as the lock above it not more water. The canal depth isn't an issue nor has been correct? Also maybe they should start building reservoirs for each lock to reduce water consumption especially the first salt water to freshwater lock. Stop flushing it out and start recirculating it in each section. Yes it'll cost more but it would massively reduce the water issue in drier years.
Im sure they can modify the canals to be a closed (or mostly closed) loop that dose not need to dump water as much. There just has not been enough incentive to do it until recently
Dam rocket money got you too bro rip 😭🤣
Fascinating documentary: thank you! The train route in Mexico appears the most feasible within a short time frame. Hopefully they also could double it with a Truck capable paved route which would offer even more flexibility in the transportation of merchandise. Could Panama look at desalinization plants? If desalinization plants were possible at the correct water volume, they could be used to fill the first lock at both ends and reduce the fresh water usage.
Stop using climate change as part of the reasons for the locks failure. Climate change is not real, but 3rd world work ethics is. The Panama Canel is failing due to maintenance.
In the past 100 years no one could figure out how to use the ocean water for the canal instead of the drinking water from the lakes??? Wow. Just wow. Stupidity abounds.
Honestly a modern Panama needs to be ocean level, unfortunate as it is we need something new and massive for our era
why don't they just desalinate sea water and pump it into the lake when drought is at the levels it is now? Yes, it may cost a bit more for the canal to function normally, but, when spread over the amount of use by the ships that rely on it, it would work. It  would solve the problem of drought and if companies wouldn't have to pay the extra charge when weather patterns return to normal and rainfall fills the lakes naturally. Also I think companies who send trade through the canal wouldn't mind paying a bit extra if it would save time and money by going all the way around South America.
I all comes back to democrats jimmy carter and joe Biden
3 MINUTES IN, NO EXPLANATION
Pumps...
Great video but gosh that microphone is trash.
It takes enormous amounts of water to fill the chambers and the pumps would take prohibitive amounts of energy to fill mutiplied by every ship that transits every hour. I know because I used to work there and it's pronounced lake Ga-toon. Maybe after we solve the fusion energy problem will it become feasible. 1:10
This makes it look like the flat earth  ? ?  ?   🌎
An electric railway could be safer for the planet
It may seem stupid but can't they pump the fresh water they use in the locks back into the lake? Why does it have to be pumped into thee ocean?
The size of Austria…..
What do you think about making a train rpute paralel to the panama canal? It would help solve a lot of problems?
All they would need to do to solve this is install pumps that pump the water up to the lake instead of leveling it with the ocean.  It would take a lot of energy ofc but it doesn’t seem that hard to me. This way they could keep quite a stable level in the lake
How can this channel accurately identify the issue of rising transport cost, and then fail spectacularly by saying that this contributes "inflationary pressures" to the economy? Lmao the cognitive dissonance is insane. It's not inflation, it's rising COST.
If there's a river threw Panama that connects to both side of the oceans then why people build this cannal?
Wow huh
They should have started a hundred yrs. ago digging a whole new canal from one ocean to the other. Would have been finished by now. No locks and bigger so all kinds of ships could get through.
Why did they not dig the canal at a closer level to sea level?
Why don't they pump one side of the lock to the other side, second lane and not.use any water from the internal lake. The difference can be held in a holding ditch/pond/man made lake. Obviously when lake levels are high you could use gravity and empty the lake so it doesn't overflow but you don't need to use any lake water for every passage.
Okay, so make a water pump, and use hydropower from the flow of the canal’s own water
Seems to me that there's an obvious solution to this. Install pumps to use sea water to raise the locks instead of draining water from the lakes
Only 1 accident at a canal has shut it down for a week. If Mexico goes with their railway, then just 1 train wreck canshut down the entire railway for weeks making the railway a poor idea. They would be better at making a canal.
Now would be a good time to expand the Panama canal to take on the biggest cargo ships. Like they did before.
Naturally, the imaginary "climate change" is to blame for almost everything.
Use water from the sea to fill the Locks Dont use sweet water in the Panama Canal Locks.Pump sea water into the Panama Canal Locks so it can be business as usual.
Mismanagement, incompetence. Those are the reasons the canal is failing. Be honest.
Easy solution. Build pumps from the ocean to the second locks and use ocean water. That by itself is gonna reduce the freshwater consumption by 2/3.  However pumps will require electricity and fuel. Do we have any green energy in Panama? Since not using renewable will only cause the situation to get worse faster.
Why don’t more people realize that this problem is much more difficult now than Joe Biden is a bling. This is really war and making everything for everybody much more expensive to transport goods from one part of the world to the other. Why don’t you liberal idiots. See this as a problem?
This felt like a SMACK awake. And one I clearly needed. Thank you for the thorough, well-done essay.
10:17 - "The currently ongoing El Niño had a 60% chance of lasting through to the summer" - In this context I think you should specify the months because I can't tell which summer are you talking about
Instead of letting the water go to the Atlantic ocean, pipe it to Panama City for their water supply
When they decided to double the capacity they didn't do any studies to determine if there was enough water available from the lakes to supply the locks
why not just cut the canal down to sea level all the way a crossed...Oh because they couldn't make money
It’s called ocean level
Why not just pump the ocean into the locks instead of using fresh water?
The Panama canal is one expensive toll
Seriously, we all know that globull warming has melted all the glaciers and that ocean levels have risen flooding coastal cities and wiping out the Isthmus of Panama..We were all told this in the 1990's right?
Now ripe what was seeded
The sound is extremely tinny. Like you recorded this through a tin-can telephone.
Perhaps the French had good intentions and idea to build a canal similar to the Suez but were limited by geography, engineering and disease.
No climate change here?🤣🤣
The idea of ​​a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans also passes through the borders of Nicaragua. Lake Nicaragua can connect two oceans with canals. And even better, ports can be established around this lake. A canal can also be built between Lake Nicaragua and Lake Managua. Another canal can be opened to the west of Lake Managua. In other words, all oceans and lakes will be united with 4 canals. This positively impacts Nicaragua and the region economically.  Also, I think that with a small border change, a part of the southern part of Lake Nicaragua can be given to Costa Rica. Thus, both countries will benefit from the ports to be built in the south and north of Lake Nicaragua. This is a project that will improve regional cooperation.  In addition, Guatemala and Mexico can build canals to connect the Oceans in their regions.
We don't need so much ship-globalism And since we now have focus on the climate, maybe it's time to go more local The amount of fuel burned and polluting for long distance transport is extreme
How about america mind its business he says "military interest" i think he meant "corporate profit" but he did get the "market share" point right pump it from the ocean (we still cant figure out salt water pumps come on)
So instead of taking some of the billions of dollars they've made out of this operation to come up with an engineering solution, they made a series of bad administrative and operational decisions. Brilliant. Take it back USA.
This is climate change propaganda. Last October had less than average rainfall but the water levels have not been affected as predicted. If your information was current, you wouldn’t have a doomsday story though. Also, the lakes used for the canal are man made specifically for the locks which means they are unnatural and you didn’t mention that.
Considering the amounts of money and importance....why aren't they pumping sea water into reservoirs used for the canal?  Instead of relying on a consistent fresh water supply.... seems beyond reckless all things considered
Eh? Why are you releasing the water into the sea after they have vacated the first lock?? When the boat enters the second lock simply pump the water back into the second lock? This will raise it to the the level there lock??
There’s enough corrections here to make me doubt the information presented.
I appreciate that this channel both gives as much time as needed to get the subject through thoroughly while also managing to make every minute matter in a way that respects the audience's time.
To be a serious channel you can’t build your topic on on the globalist’s talking point that is the VERY fluffy claim of “Climate Change “ Therefore I won’t subscribe to your channel.
Blame neutrinos
Good chance for many Central American countries with both Pacific and Atlantic coastlines: unload at a port on one end, drive/train to the other and load up again. Empty ships just wait for a load from the other side. Fkn Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Colombia should be making mucho moolah!
Why don't they just make a pipeline. That recycles the fresh water that comes from the lake. To simply get pumped back up to it.
Why doesn't Panama just build a highway and railway to ship containers across from Atlantic to Pacific. It would be a much shorter route that driving all the way across south America further south.
So heres an idea.... and it may be a bad idead, but its an idea... why not just clear a seas level path through the country... its a large task, but prevents a large water source from dumping water into the ocean...
So has anyone been thinking to pump water back up to the canal.
I think there is an issue with your microphone gain. I had to lower volume 5% and you still sound staticky.
That was facinating
This channel has become incredibly click-baiting. :/
Well, I guess it’s time that Every Country begins to take care of themselves.
The Bible talks about Climate Change / Global Warming in the last days. Y’all need to read the Bible to see what is to come in the future.
So what is happening now is actually a fulfillment of Biblical prophecies.
And what is Egypt going to do about their cash cow canal now being bypassed ?
I wonder what all that fresh water dumping into the oceans at either end have done to the ecosystems. Probably not as the dredging, oil leaks, ship refuse  etc etc. I’m surprised only 5% of the world’s seafreight passes through the Panama Canal. If the US male fleet kept on the west coast isn’t enough to have a major effect on any Chinese invasion of Taiwan then the rest of the fleet will merely be ensuring mutual destruction
23:15 “if they play their cards right” by that you mean if the US doesn’t coup the sheesh out of us to stop it from happening…
If I remember correctly, Democrat President Jimmy Carter gave up our control of the Panama Canal and that among other things is why that Peanut Farmer lost his election to Ronald Reagan in 1980
I'm disappointed at the level of clickbait here.
Lost me at climate change
Didn't al gore say we were going to flood?  I'll call BS on man made climate change.
"until the idea of panama canal presented itself"... Major BS.  Panama was a far region from Colombia and when the government was granting the contract to build the canal to another country different from the rats in USA, a separatist movement started in panama region stronger than ever during the 1000 days civil war, all financed by USA government, they told to colombian authorities that independence had to be granted otherwise they will wage war against their power... The conflict ended in just over 10 days with the signature of the treaty of Wisconsin in 1903. This was one of many imperialistic successful interventions by the corrupted USA... This is why Colombians laugh at Panama as slaves of the white house and despise the USA government, even though, diplomatic relations are good... All a façade.
Just did the back of an envelope calculation on energy need, Emma Maersk (if she can fit in the channel as such) takes a displacement of about 140000 tons. Applying a basic high school formula of energy=mass*height*g we get approximately 10.000 kWh assuming a price of 0.2 $ we and up with a tab of $2000 for the energy under ideal conditions or 14 millionths of a cent per tonnage. But duh, efficiency, duh. Running a ship that size for 18 more days would end up at 1000 times that energy.  My guess is as mentioned in the clip corruption and stagnation forcing the channel to run the same way as 100 years ago. But why make investments when you can make 10x that as bribes. Now feel free to roast me with your usual debate club arguments.
This is not a hard issue to fix, make a concrete canal through the middle of the lake connecting both sets of locks and flood the thing with salt water, effectively making an artificial salt water canal separated from the fresh water lake, sure the amount of concrete needed to do this will be substantial, but it will easily disconnect the the canal from the lake itself, meaning climate will no longer play a role in the usage of the canal
The Northwest Passage is looking really good right now.
The new millennium began on January 1, 2001, not 2000.
Why is the audio so low quality smh
70 years of records isn't long enough to even know what your long term climate is much to decide if it doesn't stay the same forever, it's not normal. You're talking about weather, not climate.
Was just reading recently that the El Niño is actually in the process of  already transitioning back to a La Niña, which is definitely much quicker than people were expecting for how strong this El Niño seemed to be
You pump water down hill. Just open the valve, it'll find its level.
It's man made. The 400 yrs r up. Genesis 15;13&14. Read that then look worldwide and see the Bible speak.
Use the salt water to replace the fresh water
feels like using solar power to pump that water up 26 meters would be pretty easy.
Is there no way of building a bridge with a section for ships to cross under, nowadays it should be feasible, Panama could set a fee like they do now. Just a thought, there are bridges around the world ships can pass under.
I thought china now has control of the panama canal
the bi-oceanic corridor sounds like a great idea, but Panama could do the same thing there already is a highway and rail line running from both ends of the canal. Both would certainly need to be upgraded but they are already in place
If China takes over Taiwan, the U.S. Navy has no chance of fighting a naval battle. Have to get real 😂
Is this read by AI? The same points get repeated over and over
They can make it rain so this is planed to hurt us.
desalination plant would fix the problem would it not?
"Unpredictable Climate Change"? Are you kidding? It would be very difficult to find anything on this planet, at this point, that is more predictable.
New millennium didn’t start 1.1.2000, but 1.1.2001.
This was fantastic.  Thank you.
b02 is gonna really happen in 2025 trust
Why the heck did Carter give it away ? Another dem failure
The RAIN ☔️ IS COMING  S O O N
Couldn’t they just pump the water for the canal from the ocean instead of the fresh water supply? In my uneducated brain, that seems like an obvious solution, so I’m assuming there’s a good reason that isn’t being done?
You forgot to mention a canal through the chocó region of Colombia which already has 2 water ways conecting to both sides one of them being atrato river, so as long you connect the 2 rivers you can do a cannal at se level, it has been proposed multiple times but no government ever had the will to do it.
Its intentional to affect the worlds economics.
You forgot to mention that the Water Source in Panama is a Source of Electricity, which will also be screwed very soon.
Nice video but the narrator lost using the “climate change” propaganda word. 😂
Mexico can make a canal by taking out Panama canal. That can save even more days and money from the Isthmus future canal.
: The changes should not come as any kind of surprise, not to anyone who has ever studied history. As the global economic crippling during WW2, the US was going to be the Big Dog, but even the US government knew that eventually things would balance back out and that it would start by the 1990s and come into full effect some around, well, the last ten or so years. Change is the only constant. People act like everything is permanent, and nothing is.
Panama dont want to use the rail...cuz there's a rail already but its just not the target
MANUFACTURING GOODS IN AMERICA IS A GREAT START WITH THE NEW LABOR FORCE THAT'S BEEN IMPORTED??
Lol the solution is so simple, if there is 18 ships per day where it used to be 36, just double the fee companies must pay. They have no option.
Wouldn't be surprised if this channel also "believes" that Climate Change Killed the Radio Star.
Watch Tony Heller for actual facts on history.
Should I now feel sorry for these shipping companies?! A genocide is going on and the only thing entitled white people are worried about is getting their consumer goods faster from Asia?! Are you guys for real?!
Enter...The Northwest Passage.
Other have also mentioned this, but the audio quality in this video is really off. I don't really know if there's a good way to describe it, but it's... crusty? Like if the microphone used was really rubbish, and constantly causes the voice to break.
How much has the population increased around the canal since it 1st opened?
Northwest Passage May also have an effect
The way I see it: Is it a problem: yes Is it a solvable problem: yes  it's just a matter of resources countries want to divert toward it. It'll be accommodated no question.
Very interesting.
The solution to the Panama Canal situation: The U.S. government must take over the Panama Canal. Otherwise the Panama Canal will cease to exist. I knew this would happen after the Torrijos-Carter treaties were signed in 1977. The situation that the Panama Canal is facing today, never occurred when the U.S. government was in charge of the Panama Canal. El Niño is not responsible for dropping in water levels in the Panama Canal. Corrupt Panamanian government officials are. The Panamanian government allowed the Panama Canal water to be used for mining and they also allowed deforestation in exchange for money from communist China. That's why rain in Panama has decreased. Corrupt Panamanian government officials are destroying the Panama Canal to fatten their pockets. The Panama Canal should have never been ran by the Panamanian government. New locks were built, but the Panamanian government didn't bother to think about new sources of water for the new locks. I think if General Omar Torrijos was alive today, he would have petitionedthe U.S. government to take back the Panama Canal. The Panamanian government has failed in the maintenance of the Panama Canal.
Simple solution. Instead of dumping the water into the ocean pump it back up to the previous (ie. higher) lock.
All of your videos are super informative and well thought out! Do you have a place where you cite your sources for the data?
this video doesn't spend much if any time actually answering the question of why the canal doesn't work anymore.
Buy local!
I don't understand if it takes 18 days to go around. South America wouldn't make more sense to port somewhere in California or the west coast and then use railways to transport goods
The canal isn't threatened by climate "change" but by climate "conditions ". Language matters!
There is no climate change, please tell the truth.  Pumping cargo ships with lake water and emptying it into a sea is not smart.  They could have invested in Ocean piping.  There should be no ships allowede untill they pipeline water from the ocean.  If salt is a problem, then filter.
Would it be possible to just dredge thru PANAMA and connect the 2 oceans
A lot of comments about pummping the water back up and reusing it.  It takes about 1kwh to raise 325k gallons  1 foot.  The water would have to be raised about 80 feet, so for easy math 80kWhs.  That's about 12800kWh per ship.    @ 40 ships a day, thats 512k kWh per day, ~187m kWh per year.  These are aproximations, and I'd be glad of anyone willing to check the math.   Not sure how that converts to MW per year, so no idea how big a plant you'd need to run that.
So, why not just pump the water from gate 1 back into lake Gatun temporarily??? Making the locks "use" 0 water?
Thank you for this video!
Wow. Great video. Been hearing about this crunch for a while from people like Peter Ziehan - but he didn't totally explain it and could not figure out what the problem was.
Usually if it was to function there suppose to have water storage or a water battery combination system.
well the problem with lithium is that its super bad for the enviornment and the harvesting is also bad and its expensive to replace but maybe one that lithium triangle area is done itll get cheaper
It will cost a fortune but... I think the only practical solution is to incorporate a set of MASSIVE water pumps so the water is not simply allowed to flow out each end!  Even though it won't be realistic to pump ALL the water movements but every ton you don't discard is a ton saved.
Make a video about Transnistria conflict.
Just a tip, you're making the name Tehuantepec harder than it needs to be: it's only four syllables, te-wan-te-pek. The digraph "hu" before another vowel is always a W sound in Spanish, and languages spelled according to Spanish rules, like Nahuatl ("Na-watl"), which is the source of many Mexican place names.
What about the Trans-Arctic route?
Another "Fake Climate Change" propaganda piece to help brainwash the undercated masses.
The last 3/4 of the video ignores the military uses of the Panama Canal.  The US navy is probably already involved in solutions.
Or... and hear me out... they could change the design of the canal to where it works more intelligently.   Like, say, using the water in the ocean instead of from the lakes.  Or, digging the locks deeper so that they don't need to use near as much water.  I guess that' why I'm not a politician.
You just have to re-engineer the plumbing. It’s going to cost more to maintain.
Why isn't the fresh water that goes out to sea re-routed to drinking water. Would need a little cleaning, but could be done.
Of Course the Chinese is looking to scam another poor country
Ships would sail through the Magellan Strait or the Beagle Canal, not next to Cape Horn.
The mic used in this video….   Burn it.
Why not just use salt water pumped from the ocean is it just because salt water is too dense?
USA and the world: we can help fix Panama.. Or.. hear me out..  we can build a cannal, or roads through south America, across unstable countries, countries that hate eachother, the Andes and cartel territory.. not to mention what would happen with weather and accidents or "accidents " the middle of nowhere.. lamao sounds fun lets go for that lol
Panama has been a corrupt, disgusting country and has failed to invest in the Canal that was built for them with US money! Perhaps the USA need to take it back, because Panama will just continue to screw it up!
So why can’t they just pump ocean water into the first two locks to save the freshwater?
"Green" energy
Another Failure of the U.S. Government , leading the destruction of the USA.  The U.S. did not do anything that was in the interest of  the U.S. Citizens.  Handing the Canal away instead of doing the improvements.!!!  Strategic  destruction  of our Manufacturing,  Transportation and infrastructure .   Nothing but Mass Murder,  Constant Warfare, and removing our Borders , and recently Biological Warfare directly against the  Citizens.   Wow i like how the You Boob Tube propaganda , tells us that it is "Climate Change "  !!!!!!!    Hilarious !!!
Poppycock..
😴 where is this clown getting his information
Welp.. time to desalinize water back in? Maybe?
Don't we have cloud seeding tech now..??  Make it rain..!!!
there will be an economic impact and the people will indeed die......
China might be able to plan a saltwater canal between the two oceans. The dirt from tunneling across might produce an island.
Uhhhh why not pump the water back to the lake?
As global warming continues, the Northwest Passage will be a more and more viable option.  Too bad Franklin will never know.
Invest in Mexico! I’d rather give twice the money to our brothers to the South than the Chinese government.
When you talk about how having control of the eventual Nicaragua canal is unacceptable to the Americans...I wonder how acceptable it is to the Chinese to have American bases just at their front door....makes one wonder if the Hong Kong guy's fortune were wrecked just because of his involvement in the canal....hmmm
Why don’t they just use sea water?
Just cut ties With Europe and Asia. We have everything we need in America and Africa. Not to mention Africa would be a better ally if we put as much effort there as we did in the middle east.
I miss the solution of pumping back the water that would otherwise flow out to the sea. That can't be such a problem. Here in the Netherlands we do it all the time to keep out the salt water of the sea. Call 112 for help.
Would it be feasible simply to pump ocean water up hill. I understand the energy cost wiuld be enormous, but it might be the only choice.
Im not sure roads and rails are gonna be enough. You will need very large ports as well as many rails/roads to handle the tonnage. Such infrastructure would also get pretty beat up by the traffic and would also need huge investments to make it happen. Ideally I think making an ocean powered setup may be the best approach. Having a freshwater lake supply that much water for a sustained period of time is inherently unsustainable...
Just want to remind the entire world of Global Reach and Global Power.  The US Air Force will reach any adversary with more fire power than can be defended against with a single order.  God bless the Navy.
bro… ur mic… check your gain staging cuz damn this is painful to listen to. or maybe you’re just compressing the hell out of it.. either way I couldn’t make it more than 3 minutes
Stop dumping the fresh water into the ocean. Pump it to crops at least.
Solar powered water pumps?
Welp a valid reason to raise prices is happening One canal/straight is being bombed And the other doesn't have enough water to make it work
15:22 Info on the two Canals under 5 minutes
They can take some of that money to build some desalination facilities?
The Carter Administration did not agree to hand over the Panama canal.  They agreed to honor a previous agreement made back before the first shovel was set to the ground.  This seemingly minor point is important because it places responsibility where it belongs.  Carter did not come up with the idea of giving ownership away.  That was already decided 50 years earlier.  Carter merely honored our promise.
There is the potential canal in Nicaragua but also the Darien Gap canal.
Swap the pumps. So it goes like this instead: sea->1->2->3->gatun. This way you will have more or less equal production and consumption of water. As a failsafe you can build a damp into ocean to dump excess water.
Records of rain fall that began since the 1950's .Which means you have no basis for any conclusions.Besides everytime there is a storm or a draught it's climate change.What caused them before Al Gore? The water problem in the canal is old stuff,I read about it in the 1950's when I was in grade school.Then the problem was also deforestation that endangered the water table of lake Gatun.
Wooooow the amount of info in this vid is insane!! ... and the fact that it's all cohesive makes this such a great, informative mini documentary! I'm subbing!
Back pump the water up to the lake using solar powered pumps ,like a battery .turbines in the pipes can add to the power needed
You need to nix claiming climate change has anything to do with current weather patterns and droughts. Ipcc papers tell us that there is no shown link whatsoever between any extreme weather we see and the increase in CO2. This is just anti-science speculation that we hear every day from non-climate scientists media types, and for honesty's sake it needs to end.
Trucks ? don't they know railways exist ?
We really needed to keep the Panama Canal since we built it , and it wouldn't be able to be sold to China, as so much of our American land has been.  Ridiculous!
How this is a issue? Just make artificial lakes on the sea side, where to release the fresh water and use that to city water first. Easily cuts out what losses there is. Sure pumping the water takes energy but that can be solved by couple nuclear reactors. Alternatively start diffing the canal deeper so locks are not needed anymore or there is far larger capacity in the lake.
Would it be possible to run pumps with solar panels during the day to lift up water from the first locks into lake gatun ?
Cut down on water instead of looking at a better way to prevent fresh water being dumped into the ocean.  LOL sounds very American and/or Capitalist to me.  They act like this will be a one time deal instead of providing a permanent solution to solidify the transportation of goods and military through the canal.
All that carbon being burned by ships.  Oh my, when will all these ships run off Tesla batteries?
Pumped is a poor choice of words for describing tranfering water between stages... you're better than this @RealLifeLore
Why are we in those Sh!t hole countries again? 👇🏽😅🎉💙
change the functionality of the first gate...pump the water back into the lake, instead of the ocean....this is a duh answer....
Why can't the Pannonians' use the ocean water at either end of the canel. this would save the lake for the people. this would save the lake and only need a change to where the water is brought in from.
So obe major issue with the panama canal and a US navy needed to get ships from the east cost to Taiwan or china most us fleets are Carrier strike groups and the carriers cant fit so they have to go the long way what good is a bunch of escorts without there air power the only major units that could be tasked around that dont primarily base arou d carriers as Subs and they dont take canal's where they are targets maybe you could get an extra ASW fleet for the east to the west quickly but china isn't a sub nation
🤔 The reason couldn’t be they recently created a second canal to accommodate larger then Panamax ships? Thus using near twice as much water as the original system was designed to handle??  No it has to be the BS climate changes fault… Perfect example how truths are spun and critical data left out to support a political agenda.
Still the second biggest spice export in the world.
The US should have never gave up control of the canal just like the US should have let the Feench and British keep the Suez but we cant show any signs if colonialism can we
maybe it's time to dig through the entire trench so you don't need a water lift system at all. For people complain it might be financial impossible to do that, the original cost of panama cannal is about 1 months of amazon's retail revenue. For a corporation depend so much on retail shipping, it might be worth it to spend that money to fix the canal situation instead of wasting it on stock buyback.
That part of the world routinely goes through severe long droughts. Implying Global Warming <tm> is creating this situation suggests the presenter doesn’t have all the facts. Or, at least, some very important ones.
It’s that dumbass pump system at both ends of the canal that’s WASTING the canals water sending it to the oceans instead of pumping it back to the top lock and reusing the same water over and over again, could even put some salt water purifier system in the pump system to purify the salt water coming in to keep the water fresh water going through the canal… simple fix… use all that money they making from the canal to upgrade it to stop wasting water into the ocean and add a salt water purifying pump from the bottom lock back up to the top lock and SAVE that water!!! Problem solved, ur welcome… pay me and I’ll be more then happy to come down there and design a perfect low energy cost system on both sides of the canal and save that country and the canal  25:52 bad idea to create the same problem again for another country in the future. Better to fix the original problem rather then destroy another country in the future
Considering that Drake’s Passage/Mar de Hoces is one of the most dangerous maritime routes - the issue is even worse.   The US should be investing in rail infrastructure to transport goods across the continent
Why can't they pump the water from number one back into number two instead of out into the ocean? Really going to have to perfect desalination at some point.
climate change hoax, continues
The Fords and later Nimitz class carriers can't fit through the canal...
Modern climate change is well under stood ? Don't make me laugh, climate change is a religion.
Is research being done on the destruction of the Amazon effecting possible climate in that region? Because it seems that since the burning of the Amazon started there have been significant climate changes to the area surrounding the canal.
I don't get it, why are they using fresh water? when the ocean is right there, at each end to boot?
Panam canal is no longer available.  Not the first time in history. Time to move on.
Modern man, just can't stop messing up useful inventions...Sad.
Why did obummer give away this vital canal?  And china owns it now!
Sounds like Panama needs to invest in a medium sized reactor or two and use huge pumps to move ocean water and only collect, process, package and sell fresh water to the world.
There is a man made desert in Panama. Due to government changes to land rights. Land holders clear cut vast areas of forest and they created a desert. I have experienced the dust storms.
The new locks have pumps that are supposed to pump the water back into a holding pond
I don’t understand why they don’t just pump the freshwater back up the system instead of venting it into the sea?
Philep what a mess you've made
Yemen has the right to defend itself, sorry. The canal should be closed.
All part of the WEF Climate Scam, one of their battle fronts for global control.
One solution with canals, Industries go back to making products in the USA instead of shipping the jobs overseas. Military? Go back to having several bases in the Pacific, Atlantic and Med. Simple. // Use salt removing facilities to augment the amount of water in the locks?
Both under going restrictions at the same time well theirs a fucking coincidence right ye ?on the other subject time to consider theirs global communication/cooperation the enemy of my (is) this shits not gonna end well
Wonder if there is a way they could recycle the water between the locks
Killing the Amazon Jungle = TEOTWAWKI 😢 all for supplying the world with products, didn’t learn from the Panama 🇵🇦 canal 😢
ur telling me in 2024 we cant make pumps to use the salt water????
YER AUDIO IS FUCKED
No mention of the North-West Passage? Should be available soon.
What would it take to cut a canal all the way from the West coast of the US to the east coast?
Why dont the shipping companies and all concerned sue the fossil fuel companies for the loss of revenue. Fossil fuel companies knew of global warming since the 1960s. They should be paying for their malfeasance. We should be siezing control of fossil fuels instead of giving them billions of dollars. The cost incurred by fossil fuel companies will cost us billions of lives and untold trillions of dollars. But what the hell. Lets just keep going the way we are. Forget this lesson on global warming. Listening to this I keep hearing those old news reels they had in the 40s promoting the US empire. All of this skated over the the affect the US empire has on all of central and south america. I loved the US doesnt like the Nicaraguan government. Yes, we dont own the canal anymore but we control the government. Norieiga stopped playing ball and suddenly he was no longer a beloved leader but a drug kingpin we had to remove for the sake of the can....i mean people.  I really like this video. Great information. But it grossly fails in one major respect. It ignores the people in all of this. The reason all of this exists. Civilization. This only reflects industry and profits. I know this is your point.
What about Panama invest in developing roads and a railroad system in order to cope with the problem? Also, what about developing desalination plants to solve both potable and canal’s requirements?
Land transport options are not the answer. When you consider that these huge container ships can carry 20000+ containers, transferring them to road or rail transport would be a logistical nightmare. The carriers would also need to double their shipping fleets.
Dredge and maintain the depth and sediment.
TL;DW  Short Answer: We let it go into the control of people without the resources, skill set, determination or Fs to give to maintain and police it.
Your videos are very cool, greetings from Spain
To much talk.
Add some pumps recirculating back to the top and move on, crisis averted.
Your propaganda against Nicaragua is despicable, the US crimes against Latín and south America is why there so under developed and your giddy about the US sabotaging their canal is so typical. Americans want nothing if they can't get rich off it and Impoverish anywhere they go.  I just spent a month in Panama last year right before there was a wave of revolution in Panama, and you can see US empire on full display and in decline
Let's not forget Daniel Ortega's pipe dream of building a competing canal in Nicaragua......
It's not the "climate chenge" Stop it. It's water management + El Niño. Stop it with that.
There was a time so long ago it's unfathomable to most. When there was but one continent, generally referred to as Pangia. It's is believe by both the religious and the scientific communities that "WE" meaning human's have only been in existence since the end of the last ice age, which in it's description give's credence to the fact that there were previous ice ages. But I'll digress on that subject. The globe as we know it today and since we first supposed came to be as alway's had the various several continent's it has today.  And as such being separated the way they are, human's have a vast difference's in our way's of governing ourselves. But now we've become reliant of all of the various contenet's and their various governing's of their individual's and though we have some difference's in the way we do what we do vs what they do when they do. Rely on both of those supposed choke point's. Neither of which should any longer be under the direction of a single country any more. They should both be in controll by an organization of the world. If and when anyone or a group of anyone's atempt to thwart the usage of either. It's not the duty of a country or two to react, it's the duty of the world to react. Though there's not one continent any longer, the continent's now divided depend on one another as it was when there was but one continent.
Why can't they use ocean water to pump into the panama canal?
The closure of the Cobre Panama copper mine made the economic situation even worse.  Panama could go bankrupt.
If countries want there's is nothing stopping political leaders from merging countries together. There's isn't really a global law. Though unrest on the citizen might become unfavorable but then again, the whole world isn't happy as is.
Just be american and do what you do best take over land. Take over the countries up to Panama integrate them into us. The countries can do so "willingly" and join to make one nation with many smaller states. Lowkey should also add canada while we at it. 😅😅😅
BUTT GLOBAL WARMING MAKES WATER LEVELS RISE.
Ohhhhhhhhhh bullshit 😊
Two words: Desalinization Plants  You have oceans of water on both sides of the country and if you clean it, you can use it without affecting the reservoirs.  Has no one thought of this?!? PuhLeeze
The Mexican railway is the best option as it already exists !
At a few seconds in, I was yelling, "Why are they dumping all that fresh water into the ocean in the first place? Build a containment system, and recycle it!" I'm sure that would be expensive, but is it really as expensive as all the lost trade?
22:44 😂 that's the stupidest thing I've heard in a while 😂 we need to get away from lithium ion batterys and use other sources eg sodium, of electrical storage and energy. How do you truck the goods across Paraguayan route, by diesel trucks 😂 use big trains and containers can be moved cheaper and more of them if your going down that route.
Going thru south America half of cargo will be HI-JACKED. THRU CARTELS. THATS A HARD NO.
No worries, the sea level, raising due to climate change since 40 years, accoring to Al Gore, will solve the issue ... right? *lol*
The problem with the Panama canal is that is pushing fresh water to the sea thus create storms all over the area
It's always so exasperating when mainstream climate change is thrown into a video without knowing the full story. Pseudoscience misinformation perpetuates and the fear porn continues.
On the way out they could use ocean water for leveling instead of lake water without risking getting sea water in the lake's fresh water.  I'd be surprised if they don't already do that.
A train can do more than a truck Coast to Coast
If there's not a ship going in the opposite direction then pump the water back up to the top using solar as it's sunny hence no rain or wave, hydro or something else like electric stored in big batterys (different types of these is a full video in itself )
"climate change," I'm outta here. Good luck with your propaganda.
Could they start pumping water from the locks back up into the top level? Not super familiar but seems like that would start helping a bit.
Global capitalism is killing global capitalism.
Damn that canal needs a upgrade
Panama needs an innovative method to solve this. The problem is they are consuming all the funds and need to make a massive investment to resolve this technical challenge.
Two solutions: pump ocean water to replace the dwindling fresh water supply to raise the canal's water levels. Seems easier and cheaper than building roads through South America; second, build trucking roads through Panama. Seems like a lot less work.
The mayor stumbling block of the projects with the possible exception of the Nicaraguan option is the need to unload and the. Load the container from ship to ship which adds to the time requied and impacta costa as well.
😂 least amount of rain in history... Or rather in 70 years. The latter doesn't mean the world is coming to an end! Many all-time high temp records in the US state I live in were set in the 1930s. The world moves in cycles... Seas become deserts and deserts become tropical forests... When I grew up everyone was scared of nuclear war and today's kids are scared of impending death by climate. Recorded weather history is very short and tell very little in the grand scheme.
Green rnergy😂
"Because it works completely differently than other canals around the world do."  Uh, no. Differently how?  This system has been in use around the world for centuries.  The Grand Canal of China, which was begun in 540 b.c. and opened in sections over the next 1,800 years, remains the longest artificial waterway in the world as well as the oldest still in use.  It is a summit canal; that is, it follows the contour of the landscape. The changing terrain required boats to go up and down hills, so a system of locks were introduced.  The first to be built were flash locks, followed by the first pound lock in 983 CE.  The first pound lock in Europe was built by the Dutch in 1373, at the junction of the Utrecht Canal with the River Lek at Vreeswijk. It used guillotine gates, which move up and down to open and close. Around 1500 CE, miter gates — thought to have been invented by Leonardo da Vinci — began to appear in Italy.  The historical Panama Canal is just a container-ship-sized set of paired pound locks with mitre gates, while the expanded canal has rolling gates.  Building it certainly was a feat of engineering, but it doesn't really work any differently from other canal systems.
Saying "climate-change" is how you let people know you are super gullible without telling them directly that you are super gullible. The climate in Panama is not changing. The climate is the same as it has been for millenia.
Why do I continue to believe that there's an engineering solution, as expensive as it would be, which could recycle the water?
How can I say this? That was enough Biased, Propaganda, Politically Driven Bullshit in this video to fill all of Texas
It's also been reported that the Chinese government has had a presence at Panama.  They would want the canal shut down to stop the United States from being able to use it.
"War in the middle east will eventually end." Thats cute.  But seriously good vid, good info. Thanks.
Ok, so many on here are saying what should be obvious,  pump the water back up. It's not happening. Why? Could it be the politicians in Panama are making millions of dollars charging under the table for passage?
Seems like the entire canal system in Panama needs to be reconsidered. And either dig a new canal that sits at sea level (which seems insanely difficult but not impossible to do) or redoing the system so it doesn't have to pump out the fresh water anymore. Maybe some kind of freshwater reservoirs that sit at sea level which get used as the primary fresh water source for the people living in Panama to drink from or simply pumping it back up into the reservoir. The downside there being ofcourse having to pump all that water back up being a big energy cost that would need new constantly running infrastructure
build several reservoirs and pump the (canal) water into those and reuse the water instead of flushing it (valuable fresh water) away and or start building pumping stations at the gates to use sea water.  the solution is not that freaking hard, it's if they had the will to do it for such a mega project.  But it's most likely a corrupt government that's pocketing away millions and millions of dollars from the billions they're making off of the canal.
Nicaragua is the smartest choice and living there also for a while it probably will, but your propaganda media bosses don't want you to say anything
'What's going on with Shipping 'taught us this months ago. Probably where you learned this too. Slow poke.
Living in Panama the Chinese have had the Contract with offices at both ends of the Canal for decades taking a percentage out of all profits and a trade agreement with Panama.... I guess your biased report conveniently left that out.. you must work for the Western bankers ass ALL Major media does with all Propaganda in place as THEY chose.....>?
The obvious solution is to pump the water back into the Lake instead of dumping it into the ocean.
Now maybe we'll start getting some good drugs back into the country
Sounds like a good place to set up a toll booth
Oh no, if only the companies had massive profit margins they could be perfectly fine with cutting down on.
We really should level the Amazon so the rich can get richer. Fucking scumbags.
When was the nuclear bomb started flying in a volcano start erupting no that's going to matter..
wouldn't they be able to make it so the water they push back into the ocean is saved and pushed somewhere else instead of the ocean tho? cuz that's the main issue.
Why don't they just open a Suez Canal up and let the water level equalize on both sides😅
Another note on the Nicaragua canal: the easiest way to build it would be enlarge and connect the River San Juan, that already ends in the Atlantic, with the Nicaragua Lake and then dig the Pacific connection.  The problem? River San Juan is in Costa Rica, and Costa Rica will not agree to the project because Nicaragua has already tried to steal it with violent means, two wars were already fought for it, and several more invasion attempts
How is the water lost from the reservoir? Wouldn't it go back into it on the return?
Wouldn't actual pumps be a decent stop gap measure, you'd only need them on one lock to prevent the fresh water being dumped into the ocean. I'm sure it would require a lot of power and not be efficient or ideal, but it would keep water in the lake.
thats a big ass fucking lake
12:00 Surely this is wrong! A heavier ship that displaces more water is better! It will require less lake water to fill the lock to the required level than a lighter or smaller ship.   Please explain the logic if I'm wrong. This clashes with my mind!
Just use salt water instead?
There surely must be a solution to recycle the locks' water. There have been ingenious solutions for building the canal. Now, engineers have a new challenge at hand. Let's get cracking!
RETURN OF THE AGE OF SAIL RAAAAGGHHHH!!
How much longer you think a Nicaraguan canal,  _built_ _by_ _the_ _chinese,_ will last,  considering how all the _TOFU_ _DREG_ _CHINESE_ _CRAP_  that's been built around the world is _FALLING_ _APART_ _already???_
Im going to take a shot in the dark here... if the States still ran this thing a solution probably would have been found to use more sea water🤔
non Japan, UK, USA,France and Israel ships are allowed freely sail around Yemen. Only those states that support Gaza genocide have these problems...
Why dont they pump the water up the hill with wind energy...? one transit needs 196'841 metric tons of water; the rise is 26m; that is 14MWh/transit... and a 6MW wind mill can make 10GWh(electricity) per year in germany...
It sounds to me that they need to add a system to use during droughts. I'm assuming they are trying to keep the salt content in the lake to a minimum, especially if it's used as a drinking water or irrigation reservoir as well. Perhaps instead of disposing the extra water in the last lock into the ocean, they set it up so it goes into a storage tank to be pumped into the locks it needs to be in when going the opposite direction. It wouldn't need to be done all the time as that could cause other possible problems like pollutants building up (perhaps a filtration system can be added to help reduce that), but only in drier seasons. It would just be a matter of flipping a switch to redirect the water flow. I know that takes money, but I'm sure all the countries who benefit wouldn't mind helping to pay for it if it keeps the Panama Canal functioning even in a drought situation.
Wow, he went from El Niño being a normal condition to climate change? Apparently this guy thinks at sometime in the world history the weather never changed. Bonkers! Apparently nobody's ever asked him what caused the ice age? I'm thinking that was slightly before people created any sort of problem. Nobody ever told him about the medieval warming that was caused by a change of weather. Nobody told him about the little ice age that was caused by a change in weather. Nobody taught him to think for himself. Obviously gobbled the matrix blue pill of ignorance willfully. How sad
free palestine
9:13 BS
Always interesting, thank you.
why not just pump the fresh water back into the lake!!
The death of the Canal might mean the birth of PaTO=Pacific Treaty Org.=western branch of NATO:USA,Canada,Japan,Australia,NZ.Nobody in Europe challenge mighty US
If that rail system is actually completed in Mexico in the 2030's, that will eventually mitigate the migration problems at the US southern border. With new found wealth, why come the States?
I’m still confused. Why not just removed this whole system and open the canal?
This might be good for Valparaiso. So can't complain
please fix mic
Iran-backed ... do you have proof
Instead of dumping water in the sea, why not drop that water in a reservoir to reuse when needed.
*Extremely disappointing that 90% of the video doesn't talk about why the Panama Canal is dying.* Fortunately, Google helps to find the answer.
A sign corrupt administration is one than can't figure out how to pump sea water into the canal. I know salt water isn't an option because of corrosion.  Nothing a liitle planned maintenance and increasing usage fees couldn't over come. Investing in improved design wouldn't hurt. They said man would go to the moon now we are talking about going to Mars.
Your comment about lading levels affecting water use is simply nonsense.
A railroad across Panama seems the easiest.
I'm sure the trillions that have been spent in US alone on "covid" could have been invested into digging through a flatter Panama canal, but you know, "priorities"...
Panama could spend some of its wealth on desalinating sea water to provide drinking water for its citizens. Alternatively the freight could be unloaded at one side on to a rail road, then sent across land to the other side to be loaded onto other ships to continue its journey. US warships could be permanently docked on the pacific coast. There are always solutions.
Just pump the freash water to a seperare reservoir and reuse when needed? Why is this not a solution? Seems pretty obvious
OR... Build a pump into the reservoir and get the water back into the lakes...  Hey, just an idea...
So if I was the president of Panama I would put a shipping embargo tax on All Ships that want to go through the Panama Canal saying that if you want to shorten your trip and save on gasoline or diesel we want millions of cases of water or we're going to stop using the canal and you can go the long way around and we'll save our fresh water for our citizens❤
Back to Drake's short cut I guess?...
Our goods ship on these vessels, and the price increases coming are very real, COVID all over again. Vessel carriers are charging 300% more, just like during COVID. Big inflation coming for sure again...
Panama should allow the USA to use the HAARP weather control and modification program. So it can increase rainfall.
Add pumps at the lowest dock and pump the water back into the lake, if the water level is to low. Problem solved
can the excess water from the first lock be pumped back up the second lock? I mean it will cost energy and fuel, but the water will be preserved, right?  BTW @11:11 the graphic shows 1 ship=2.25 million people per day while the voice over says it equals half a million people per day. Which is it?
Why don't they pump the difference in each lock back to the lake?
Should have use sea water to pump n level e canal. What a waste of fresh water by pumping out into e seas.
In te Netherlands we have huge pumping stations to kerp our country dry. Easy job making 2 pumping stations to pump the locking water back into the lake, I'd say. Better than spilling it out to the sea
Why don't they use seawater instead?
The Isthmus of Tehuantepec train in Mexico has been in operation for at least one month, not in 2030 as the video says. The train takes approximately 6 hours to travel from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico.
The Panama issue could be solved rather simply, it's just going to cost a great deal of money. You simply need two pumping pools. One either side and a way to equalise both levels via a pipe line. Using the same water again and again. No need to out source the water ever again. It'd cost billions though so no one will do it.
You would think that the water to change ship heights. The Panama government would just put pumps and reservoirs near the ship locks.  So the water is just recycling in the lock area. No need to dump the water in the sea.
The narrator talks about US Navy ships redeploying during the Cuban Missile Crisis like that was a good thing. We all almost died because of that.  Edit: Narrator immediately pivots to we need the canal so we can start a war with China over Taiwan. Good grief! I'd say China is not likely to allow a nuclear exchange to start on their end like Russia might, but that was also true of the Soviets. Even a psycho war-monger like Reagan admitted he didn't think he could push the button, even if the country were being attacked, which makes the real danger accidents, but we know we've narrowly escaped accidental nuclear war way too many times for comfort. How much longer can we rely on that kind of luck?
My question is why they don't reconfigure the pumps to push the water back up the system instead of into the ocean?
They could use the water for ships next to each other but going in the oposite direction to recycle the water. Regards, Geoff. Reeks
This is a plan to destroy the us and Europe economically. By 2025 both will be hurting big time!
Hold on. China loaned money to build a cannal? What could go wrong
This is a dumb question, but, why don't they just pump sea water to fill those gates? Is it energy cost? Or just speed?
They should just stop shipping container ships thru the Middle East , Just take the long way around to America and Canada and south America , see if the Jawas can try and survive  on their own agriculture and  manufacturing skills... 😂  It might be really funny and we could start a little reality TV show about it...  Animal prove a point that you might not want to attack the hands that feeds you... 😂
They can use sea water?
I can not speak on the engineering, but I know the forest contribute the the charging of the aquifers and reservoirs there. The world also had a strong El Nino and particularly La Nina the past few years arguably these conditions were made worse from climate change. Some of you may agree or disagree with that last part. But rivers were drying up all over recently globally and the jet stream has been unusually wavy.  Either way the canal is an exercise in a system with inflows and outflows, The rain is the inflow which pools in the lakes. And we expend that water as an outflow to move ships. Agriculture, evaporation, and residential use are also outflows. So long as the inflows are greater than or equal to the outflows then the system remains stable. We can manipulate the system by trying to increase the inflows and or reservoirs, or reduce outflows. Reforestation might capture and attract more rainfall, larger lakes can hold more water. We can also try to install a feed back loop that would pump water back up stream however while this could work it would be at the expense of and additional input cost "energy" as you would need to pump water uphill so it may or may not be worth it.     My take on it.
Just wondering why US East Coast - Asia trade wouldn't just cut across the continental US via rail? No extra borders to cross
Why wouldn't they cut off lake use and dig the canal out to make it even with the ocean on both sides so the lock is no longer a lock and is instead a salt water toll route for ships. Done right this could be done without affecting shipping through the canal.
There is another solution:  Grow, produce and buy local. That solves a lot of problems.
I mean they could, instead of letting the fresh water drain into the ocean just pump it back into the lake. They the hecc they let it just drain into the ocean in the first place is beyond me
I don’t like the usage statement at 11:10 about how each ship passage (uses 52,000,000 gallons from Lake Gatun) is equal to 500,000 Panamanian’s daily use. It should be that on a “per capita basis,” each ship’s passage uses an equivalent of 500,000 Panamanians. It’s the country’s use just divided by its population technically.
Thank the Chinese for that. They are the ones who talked Panama into widening it for their big ships. They don't care if Panama has any drinking water.
This is way off! If you want facts, don't listen to this.
Can’t they just pump the water back up to help recover it?
Pump from the oceans, it’s XXI century, bgs
The rains will come eventually. As you said, the El Niño phenomenon is a cyclical event.
Why are we able to see thousands of ships passthrough everyday in the red see without heading to Israel
Panama is one of the most corrupt Latin American countries. Unfettered capitalism and bribery is the rule of the day.
While rain is low in central america? It's record high in south america. It's not climate change, It's just normal climate cycle.
Why is the audio so trash? Did you upload the wrong file?
Dude, I can't even watch your show if you keep mentioning "climate change" every 10 seconds. In this particular case, absolutely no one is blaming "climate change" for the natural nino-nina cycle.
I wonder if they were to build two small nuclear power plants at each end of the canal.  Then use the electricity they would generate to recycle the water back into the lake using large pump systems.  When the lake levels at normal levels the excess energy could be used by the public.  I realize that nuclear power is frowned upon but if properly managed it is the cleanest form of energy and is very reliable.
Add Desalination plants? Ship in water? Pump from wells and fill reservoirs? Reroute water to the lake? Build more man made lakes?
What am I missing here? If most of the alternatives are land routes between ports on opposite sides of several countries, why not simply do the same in Panama over the shortest distance of all?
8:00 it's not raining enough
Well that clarifies a lot about current world events
there is already a passenger train running between colon and panama city.  i remember taking it some 20 yr ago -  was staffed with young women who all looked like models.  why cant they expand the route for freight?
I bless the rains down in Paaaanamaaaa
No mention of the fact that the Houthis are only attacking ships from countries that support Israel's genocide in Gaza is a choice... Cool, goo to know not to watch this channel anymore.
I don’t know what it would entail, but they should reuse the water they’re dumping into the ocean.
The short answer to "Why the Panama Canal is Dying" is very simple:  It is no longer controlled by the United States.  End of story.
Do the locks now consume 3 times as much water than pre 2016? They hold 3 times the volume.
Climate change is a hoax
The suez is the worlds shortcut grow up no one cares about california
Why not build pumps to interchange from different stages instead of just dumping to the sea each time? Obviously a massive project but still…
China is running the Panama canal now, they were hired by Panama
It's not just a shortcut, the Drake passage is incredibly dangerous.
the frankly disrespectful omissions & inaccuracies used to describe the “maritime crisis in the Red Sea” was quite disappointing. It’s an interesting & informative video, but you’ve displayed either ignorance or callous bias…I’m not sure which one is the culprit.
you'd think they'd pump the water back up rather than out to the ocean.
If it’s not raining, then it’s probably sunny. How many solar panels would it take to pump the water back up to the lake instead of letting it go out to the ocean? No idea if this obvious idea is realistic or not.
Disagree. The Panama canal cannot accept the ships being built.
Easy solution, use ocean water for the first stage when necessary.  The small amount of salt water that makes it into the freshwater lake will be insignificant and will save millions of gallons.
1) why not use trucks to transport goods across Panama?   2) why not getting fresh water from neighboring countries instead of relying on the lakes?
OMG! Climate Change!! The was never El Niño nor droughts like this before now. Uh, huh.
a railway cargo system going from atlantic to pacifc to an awaiting ship on other side may be an option?
What about the Northwest Passage? Melting ice is making it more and more practical
God, why don't they recycle the water back into the lake? I know it wouldn't be easy, but it would seem to be completely worth the effort. Wait, now I remember why I don't like this channel. THEY DO RECYCLE THE FUCKING WATER. THERE ARE RETENTION PONDS NEXT TO THE LOCKS. JESUS, WHAT LAZY WRITING.
EQ your mic better bro
Desalination plants....it's not too pricey. Just ask Israel.
Heres an idea for a video for you... "why youtubers hyperexagerate everything and try to con people into watching crap by clickbait thumbnails", i might actually watch that
China runs the canal. Hutchinson Wampoa used to be the company. Not sure if they are still involved but, most of that company was owned by generals in the Chinese communists military. They wanted to take over the ports on the west coast too but Bush administration squashed it after 9/11
Instead of letting water out to sea pump it back up to the lake
Why can’t they use the sea water on the lower locks and pump the fresh water back into the lake instead of dumping it into the ocean? Seems to me that would be an easy solution to stop the waste of fresh water at least.
They need to overhaul it get a clear path from one ocean to the next take out the locks
We built it why would we give it up seems foolish considering the importance of the canal
Just get a bunch of buckets of water and refill it. Not that hard
Don’t just reduce the ships passing through, charge way more for the ship to pass through.
"REAL LIFE LORE"...Sounds like a bunch of liberal talking points...why can't you just be honest?
I noted that whenever American utubers quote distance,  they do so with both statute and metric distance.  You don't do that.  I also note that you spend much of your talking points on climate change...which is a very real phenomenon,  that has happened throughout the existence of the Earth. I firmly believe that you are a Liberal alarmists,  and that you are now mongering fear. You're Mama must be very proud of you.
It's not climate change!  The reason the Panama canal is struggling is because of all the clear cutting of the rain forests.  Hot and humid air tends to condensate in the rain forests, which feeds the streams that feed into the reservoirs
in the long run - we are phucked
Why not use saltwater instead of fresh water?
Why can't they just build ports and  roads in panama, colombia or costa Rica so the ships off load on one side.. trucka move the containers to the other side and another ship takes it away. 🤷
The Panamanian government is composed of a group of thieves.
Panama was created for the Panama fo Canalr  end of story. Only permanent fix is to Remove 50 m of elevation between the Atlantic and the Pacific.. No longer relying on fresh water to conduct trade  Or kindly give back panama to columbia now that we're no longer using it.... ... o😅r tunnels Underneath the fresh water eliminate the need for it ... Third, and final option is to recycle the water. Pay to pump it up instead of using gravity and the loss of the water itself. Most efficient way is fossil fuel. Bring import it or right there from venezuelafor cheap. And ultimately that will be the solution.
"Climate change" didn't cause this. And there's no "climate change" fix for this.  Panama wanted ownership, they got it. And the world will suffer for it, due to mismanagement since. Once again, Jimmy Carter was the 2nd worst POTUS in history. Let's hope the US, after losing countless billions handing it over, isn't stuck with the bill. Unless Panama agrees to give the US a good ROI.
Why not use seawater instead? We have plenty of that.
Mexico it´s on their way to complete the INTEROCEANIC CORREDOR Project ! ! !
Fascinating. Just fascinating.
The Panama Canal locks are NOT operated using pumps.  Valves next to each gate are opened to allow water to pass between adjacent locks, and gravity equalizes the water levels.  Then the valves are closed as the gate is opened.  Pumps are just a needless opportunity for mechanical failure, and would be a tremendous cost to do something which gravity already does for free.
In the year 2000, Pres BILL CLINTON DEMOCRAT before leaving office TURNED OVER CONTROL OF THE CANAL TO PANAMA AND CHINA......To Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong–based shipping interest owned by Li Ka-shing.  Hillary Clinton was a partner in the Rose Law Firm when Bill become Governor of AK.  The Rose Law Firm Represented Walmart to facilitate CHINA goods into USA killing Main Street America....If you were small town USA and tried to keep Walmart from coming in, it was the ROSE LAW FIRM whom sued the town to get it built there.....and they almost always won......Beginning to get the picture yet ?!?!?!?!?!?!
It is adorable.   We are told to believe that “global warming” is CAUSING droughts.   However, ANYONE who understands the hydrologic system KNOWS that IF there is really global warming:   A. The ice in the North would have opened up, revealing many routes over the North…not happening.    B. There would be MORE water in the world, as ice melts to water and water vapor.  This would lead to MORE water fall.    C.  Don’t the global warming alarmist tell us that the oceans are rising (they are not) would this not reduce the amount of water needed to raise ships?     D. They really need ONLY route pumping from the ocean to the locks.  This, of course, is not economically easy….and THOSE WHO USE LOGIC, know that this draught is temporary.  So not necessary.
Actual answer in the video starts around 7:00, in case you want to skip the writers stringing you along.
Why couldn't the water used to raise the ships be treated used for the population or is too polluted to use? That would help with water use.  Also desalination plants would be a good idea.
52mio Gallons is 196.841.000 Liter is 196841 Cubicmeter. So you have to pump 197.000tons of water 26 meters high for one ship. Epot=m * g * h (kg*m/s²*m) 197.000.000kg * 9,81m/s² * 26 = 50.247.000.000Ws -> 13.958.000Wh -> 13.958kWh  Lt‘s put efficiency at 50%. So you need about 28.000kWh of electric energy. At 0,1$/kWh we talk about 2800$ that I would charge the ship owner.  Ok, machinery, maintenance and personal must be added.  But if the other option is to close the channel, I think pumping is a good Idea.  Maybe energy could be recovered while flowing to the lower chamber? But maxbe the effort does not pay off?
Draw😊 water from the Atlantic and the pacific
Your logic is wrong... A fully loaded ship rides lower in the water, displacing MORE water, so it takes LESS to raise or lower it. The higher a ship rides in the water, means MORE water required to fill the lock. I have been thru the canal no less than 10 times each direction while in the Navy.  It is pretty impressive to see it in actual operation. AND the water in the 2 middle locks actually just feed each other.
Get a better microphone.  Please.
for cargo shipping, the obvious solution is to use rail to transport containers from one coast to the other - sure, have to unload and load the containers, but it's doable and the ports could expand to add more cranes  and it means coordinating shipping routes to have vessels operating in both oceans that participate in the overall delivery of containers, so more effort there  but that all would probably still be preferable to 18 days of a longer ocean only route
Super easy.  US built and run nuclear reactor and pumps!!  We get a tiny cut too.
I am absolutely convinced this dude is paid by the deep state.
Why didn't they mention the obvious solution of pumping the water from the bottom locks *back up* into the top locks? That would make the system closed-loop, never needing any new water really, and all your problems are solved. ??
WHY SHOULD THE USA PAY TO BUILD ANOTHER CANAL FOR US TO GIVE THAT AWAY TOO
Why dont they just add a pump system to pump back into section two from section one instead of dumping into the ocean? Same from two and three. Problem largely solved. You're welcome. Only a drought that empties the lake would be an issue.
YES THE CATER ADMINASTRATION ANOTHER DEMOCRATE, GAVE AWAY THE PANAMA CANAL, AND OF COURSE THE GOVERNMENT THAT RECIEVED IT TOOK REAL GOOD CARE OF IT LOL
When you are describing how the locks work there are no pumps, only valves. The valves are opened from the higher lock and water flows due to gravity to the lower chamber and stops itself when they reach equilibrium.
Let me save you 36 minutes of irritating chatter:  There is a drought in Panama, which makes it less fillable by reservoirs which lift ships into and out of locks in the canal. There's a war in the ME, making passage through the Gulf a problem due to Houthi's (Iran) attacking ships. So many shipping companies are choosing to go around the SA and African continents instead of through canals.This increases the costs of goods.
I couldn’t take the robotic AI voice for more than 10 minutes. Sorry
They should not have STOLEN the Panama Canal from America, who built it , afterall. That's what the Chinese & Globalists did, who are trying to run it now.      PANAMA WAS A JUNGLE WITH NO INHABITANTS, SO THE U.S. DID NOT TAKE THE LAND FROM ANYBODY, BECAUSE THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT DID NOT EVEN EXIST WHEN WE BUILT THE CANAL, AND NO PEOPLE WERE EVEN LIVING THERE.  Give me a break.     Globalists & Chinese are always jealous and stealing from the United States, and it blows up in their face.   THEY ARE disgusting..
Shouldn’t it be useless now because of all the sea levels rising?!?!?🤔
A canal across Mexico looks the best bet. A rail line can only be interim.
Thanks Carter administration 🙄 We are constantly dealing with the ignorance of the leaders on this left.
I wonder what creating an artificial lake (Lake Gatun) does to climate models over 100 years,  I wonder if creating this artificial lake has any affect on el nino.  I can only suspect creating a large body of fresh water where there is naturally none, might affect climate.
What happens when the army core of engineers has no engineers.
18 more days doesn’t sound so bad.
I guess I don't understand why pumps can't be used to bring the fresh water back up into the locks in a self-contained system?  It would save on water long term.  It would take some holding pools along the sides, which could be difficult, but it wouldn't be the loss they are experiencing now.  Maybe it's a question of volume?
You neglected to include the Interoceanic Logistic Canal (railroad) mega project for which Honduras has already completed preliminary and advanced studies over the last 10 years.  South Corea, China, The United States, Italy and several other Middle eastern countries have already shown interest. The government of President Xiomara Castro, during her visit to China, last June 9, announced specific conversations to finance this project with President Xi Jinping.  Various official and technical delegations of the Chinese government have visited already visited Honduras to discuss this mega project to link the Atlantic ports of Puerto Cortes and Puerto Castilla with the ports of San Lorenzo (or Henecan Port) and the new proposed deep water port of Amapala in the Pacific Gulf of Fonseca.  This project cost is estimated at about 2 to 6 Billion Dollars. Thank you. Riverdale, Bronx, New York.
The Houthi are not a "faction", they are Yemen
Oooooh they gone start doing sun bout climate change when it affect dem pockets
I have said this over and over and over that the U.S. need to build a canal from SEATTLE Washington down to the Gulf of Mexico. It would not only stimulate the economy, it would create many positive benefits for rhe country. They should build numerous nuclear power plants along that canal and possibly hydro power plants. They could even create desalination systems for our water supplies. It may seem like a big project, but for the future of the country I believe it would be brilliant. It would be more strategic than the Mississippi river while also connecting the Mississippi river wirh the west coast canal. Which would make the entire country have cheaper shipping cost for manufacturing. The thing is, along the distance of that canal could be shipping docs that have rail roads and trucking companies that could ship the products from those docs.
I doubt the lithium will help those countries. Historically, countries selling raw resources do not get much value out of them, comparatively.   Now, if they build processing plants and battery factories there, that would change the situation, but if they stick to exporting raw mats, the money will probably mostly stay with a few select companies/governments controlling the area, and the people will see little benefit for the major ecological impact.  Also - why can't Panama build train track(s) across the country?  Ships offload on one side, and since containers are standardised they could be easily loaded onto trains, moved to the other side and loaded onto ships again to move along.  Seems like it would be much cheaper than building another canal system.  Also, the question of trains continues for the south america corridor - why on earth would you want to use trucks instead of train for cargo?
I belive it's humanly possible  to completely separate the two continent surfaces to build essentially a small seaway 'strait.'    But of course it would be massively costly, dangerous, and couldn't be used anyway since it would require lots of blasting with nukes which would kill us all anyway lol.  Not to mention what it might do to the climate and ocean currents, Earth's  rotation, angle, and a host of factors, even if it could be done without nukes.  Another way is to set a long term plan with conventional explosives. 100 years of blasting with explosives and work in earth moving, or however long the math says it takes.   Under this far fetched scenario, it might cost at least a trillion, but make it a mandatory buy-in for all countries that wanna use it, in on sliding scale by country, or they get banned from the new Mega Canal.  Again, this would devastate the environment, and maybe wreck the planet, who knows what the Environmental Impact Studies would conclude, but would make trade flow like a mofo.
25:19 would t a hyperloop be a good investment?
Im no engineer, but wouldn't it be easier to build a resvoit with pumps dedicated just for the pumps so xyou can recycle the water
24:53 and much easier for cocaine trafficking
Wouldn’t trains be more useful for “the Bi-Oceanic Corridor?”
Has it ever been considered to make a sea water reservoir or to otherwise use sea water for the locks?
Re-building the Panama Canal infrastructure seems like the least expensive plan. Having a road through 3 countries seems problematic as well as one through Columbia.  I’ll see all those road/ rail alternatives when I see it.
If Panama made locks side by side they could use the same water twice.
What don't we use the HAARP project to replenish the water?
Why not build holding tanks to recycle it?!
Why dump the water? Can't you pump it back to the top lock?
"Route" is pronounced _root,_ not rout.  So irritating to listen to.
Anyone take into consideration that when they made the canal wider to accommodate these new super container ships. Wider ships more water to fill the locks. The builders of the locks didn’t even bother to do the math on water consumption. All that ANYONE ever thinks about is the almighty dollar. When are humans going to realize that money can’t fix stupid people
Massive pumps to use sea water to fill the top lock?
I hate to inform everyone but the science does not support this claim. Investigate this for yourself.
My 2 questions would be why not build a newer better canal and why not build holding tanks of sea water to use. I'm assuming money and environmental impact.
So, without the climate change element there would just be ENSO cycles. AGW is a successful hysterical argument, a fabrication designed to reduce the brain power of generations of emerging minds. Love watching the locks, so for that part thanks.
Well china’s military industrial complex is completely messed up so we got a few years
Elon?
Seems to be poor use of land and water to use current style canals.   Overland roads or rail would seem more logical.   Or how about using ocean water and recirculating through the locks?  Just spit balling, but if we can conquer space, surely we can build a workable transport system.  I think the only problem is 💰💸💵💶💷 no country wants to invest unless they can control it,,,,and cooperation for joint project is unreasonable, right??🤔😠😳
Why not recycle the water in the channel? It would be easy and save a hell of a lot of water that the people need.
Make a new channel or create more jobs shipping in Mexico.  Possible make a road across Costa Rica,  Mexico,  or Honduras.  It would also create jobs in these countries.
well, at least th Panama canal wil alway be usefu for military vessesls transfers at least. iguess...
There's nothing unusual about the operation of the canal as shown. Reservoirs and flights of locks are standard features of canal systems. The water isn't "pumped" from the upper chamber to the lower in such a system. Gravity does the work. The new locks pump water out and pump it back in to conserve water, but that's not what shown or described.  One unusual feature at Panama is the first lock is flushed out with a flow of fresh water before closing to bring a ship up. This is to avoid bringing too much salt up into the lake, and it uses up a lot of fresh water.
There obviously a perfect answer, but why do they use limited fresh water instead of abundant in comparison salt water?
And somehow NG is at like $2. And we think Nicaragua is corrupt
Climate is always changing, just not by anything that humans do.
dude what happened to your microphone.. you have 7.3M followers, you can afford a replacement. this shit sounds terrible
I doubt that the canal was designed for the amount of traffic generated by shipping goods from China and around the world.  The builders could not have envisioned such a tsunami of world trade.
So why are they using fresh water from the lakes instead of sea water from next to the canal?
Time for Panama to spend some of that Canal money on Pump Stations to fill the locks with seawater instead of lake water.
It only took panamanian government 24 yrs to run it into the ground
So profit and turning away from people in need had one canal blocked and the other hindered. Karma on a world economic scale.
I like mexico and columbia's ideas the most.
Could they not just pump it back in the lake?
Great video!
WHY, dont they build a new canal around to the right at La Palma? inlet ? its flattish land and barren?  Mexico is looking at Veracruz location to build one?
Wouldn't it be much more efficient if the bi-oceanic corridor relied on trains rather than trucks? Highways are way more costly to maintain and also far less energy efficient.
Why don't they build pumps to pump the water back up on the bottom lock? A couple of large pumps could save both the economy and the lakes.
The mic sounds like its halfway in your mouth.
This was a very interesting video, UNTIL they start blaming the problems in the Panama Canal on Climate Change.
Climatechange is of all times lol, not something new. Stop the fearmongering.
Can they not use ocean water for the lock system instead of fresh water
Why don't they just pump ocean water?
I prefer the southern south american route, bc those countries are the most stable
The canal was built on old school thinking, the lock fresh water is pumped out into the sea depleting the fresh water supply. Long term you build a holding pond to collect this water and reuse it. Yes it will be expensive but no where near as expensive as running out of fresh water in Panama
It's all gravity driven, so where is the power coming   to drive the pump to lift the ship? Why not lift the ship all the way 26 meters, needing only 2 sets of doors? the answer is the locks are in parallel, with the descending ships . Oversimplifications lead to questions lead to the guy doesn't know what he is talking about. Think about it. No power no pumping, no lifting. why 3 stages ?
Amazing that the weather controllers can do good weather where it's  needed.  They only destroy.
One way or another a solution to the Panama Canal issue will be found and implemented, as soon as the cost of doing  nothing outweighs the cost of of doing something, Money talks.
Oh and what about option 6: NW passage in northern Canada?
The foresight of the canal's designers were phenomenal.
Shouldn't we all collectively bite the bullet and just flatten the entirety of the Panama canal? Or just drain water from the ocean instead of from fucking inland basins. It's clearly still gonna be used until teleportation or planes become magically easy to use and make. 21:55 this just proves that the "global south" idea is fucking nonsense. Not that it needed proving. 23:00-23:40 and it's all gonna be controlled by the next empire. Be it nation or internation, it'll be a tyrannic totalitarian govt. 26:20-27:00 see. Like this. 28:55 an autocrat in a socialist nation. Say it ain't so.
Why don't they just do the incredibly obvious thing of pumping the water up to the lock above with water from the lock below? There would be slight sea water contamination from the bottom gate, if this negligible amount of water was considered too much of an environmental impact for the lake, then you could definitely do it for some of the trips through the locks. Also as the ship is transiting down the locks the water is ending up in the sea so pumping salt water into the lock below, and the water from the lock with the ship in being pumped up would result in no contamination of salt water. The only difference would be the increased cost of pumping water against gravity than with it.
I don't understand why they don't make reservoir by the locks to save and reuse the water to raise and lower the ships
I recall an article published decades ago in something like Popular Mechanics a proposal to build a canal along the US Mexico border using atomic explosives,
The canal was supposed to be owned for 100 years. Just like Britain with Hong Kong
So why are they not building a pipeline to pump ocean water to the lakes that fill the locks with water?
You duckspeak Empirespeak doubleplusgood.
Why do they need fresh water?  What's wrong with the two sea's salt water?
Why can't the Panama canal use ocean water for the lock system?
Don't forget the Northwest Passage, through Canada.  There's already a lot of things heating up (literally) about that, too.   It's a faster route to Europe from China than any of the options in this video.
They need to figure out how to recycle some of that water. Looks to me to be a moneymaker if they can figure it out.
You missed to mention the project of a rail and highway "dry canal" in Costa Rica
Why not just use salt water?
Im surprised they didn't build a back up pump that pulls from the ocean
How about the Northwest passage through northern Canada with the use of ice breakers for the winter months
This video critically miscalculated the amount of helicarriers that can simply float across. It only takes 1 - 2 small countries annual GDPs per flight
America should buy it back.
I wonder why Panamas population is centered around the canal… could have anything to do with US involvement right? Right?😮
What an excellent opportunity to jncrease manufacturing and export in the America's.
Desalination plants at each end of the canal, pump from the oceans, desalinate, use for locks, reduce impact on lakes?
So build another underground cavern to hold lock 1?
Why is the Panama Canal dying, China bought from the United States America, Enough said.  Edit Update: I guess that China thing was just a rumor, or they bought it from Panama or it's the Panamanians have a tough time with it, I was about a serval seconds in when I posted.
See - Panama Canal expansion project
Why can't they pump ocean water instead of fresh water?
No problem, just build a reactor and replace the hydroelectric power and rain with electric pumps. Should be easy to finance with a fraction of ownership.
This could have been explained in 5 minutes
Get ready to pump water UP instead of down.  Get started NOW.
why just not pump that water upstream and not in the a ocean
Honestly, they simply need to do a manger physical change, but a simple fix - retain more fresh water during lock usage. Which requires holding tanks and extensions to the pumping systems that don't exist. To much is lost to be lost when very little is actually not hold able!
Just another moronic climate change video 👎
Just make a holding tank and fill it with sea water, use it to fill the bottom lock instead of lowering the second. Need the 2nd to lower? Make another tank for that to pump into. How is this hard? Its not like whole economies are dependent on this grain, chicken, fox puzzle...
😊😊
The solution could not be simpler: energy is stored in so called pumped storage. Instead of dumping the water from one reservoir to the other you pass it through Kaplan turbines, recover the energy, electrically and pump if right back up with a loss not exceeding 20% The advantage all the equippment is used today, the pumps, the generators,  the low pressure Kaplan turbines. Just order them from.Esher Wyss in 🇨🇭 the cost , order of magnitude less than building dams. In summary: reverse pumped storage  Water savings: at least 75% This would be higher if the transient operation would not force a continuous adaptation to the variable water level . (Head) That also means that electrical energy is also available , free of charge, almost, transformers filled with Sulfur hexafluoride are needed to adapt the voltage for distribution.
You are doom and gloom saying this is the worst drought since records were ketp. A whole 70 years? Get real. The west part of the US was in a drought and was never supposed to have the lake levels back to normal. Then one really wet winter and there you go. It is an issue that will come and go, but don't pass that climate change crap on to your audience like it is pure fact.
Let's just use the water from the  oceans. Instead of fresh water
"With lighter loads the ships displace less water and require less water to move through the locks."  I assume the Panamanian authorities understand the engineering here, but why is this the case? The water the ship displaces is just that--displaced. Only the water that fills "below" what's filling the lower chamber needs to be drained from the level above to raise the vessel, so it should be the same for a rowboat as a container ship. What's pushed out the first chamber when the vessel enters the locks should equal what it pushes out of the locks back into the lake when it enters the locks at the other end of the canal.  What am I missing here?
34:00 why would you not just figure out a much more efficient way to capture and reuse that fresh water for multiple reuses buy many ships instead of just one at a time and then flushing the water away? There is no free lunch and any solution is going to come out of cost so why not go with the best solution in order to justify the cost is the smartest thing to do given the available options duh
Sounds like we need to melt some icebergs
24:46  Well finally a well-thought-out proposal....  What's that doing here with all these other stupid ideas?
Make stuff in europe again..
Panama is a Province of Columbia that the US Annexed to create the Panama Canal
i don't get why these road and rail networks are considered "alternatives to the Panama canal??.. Mexico, the US and Canada all have road and rail networks that connect the two oceans already... why would these new proposals be any better?
Ships carry a lot more load than trains. Trains carry a lot more load than trucks. And they want to go from ships to trucks? That seems incredibly dumb. What am I missing here that they don't at least establish a train route for the bi-oceanic corridor?
20:58 green energy leveraging one of the dirtiest Industries known to man the production of lithium ion batteries that can be exported once they're put in a truck and driven using fossil fuels across the continent to countries who won't need them any longer by the time that's fleshed out. I would say brilliant but that would be the exact opposite of what applies to the strategy and instead encourage you to rethink that idiocy before you build it rather than afterward
Are we not able to pump salt water into the to lock 3 using that to raise and lower water levels inside the locks
These low effort AI generated scripts are becoming exhausting.  I will not ever be clicking on a RealLifeLore video again.  Also looking at what channels are the same team and avoiding them.  AI is great if you leverage it to create better content, not as an easy fix cash grab.

How about pumping the water back into the lake?
“Work’s completely differently to how other canals work” then explains how a normal canal works…
The simple solution is they're just gonna have to pump in salt water unfortunately.  That are they will have to drill a well And start pumping fresh water out of an underground aquafer or pull the  Freshwater from a different source Until the local weather stabilizes back to normal, everything in nature is cyclical,  They will just start half the building a pipeline to pull the water from somewhere further away if they want to keep their trade route open
I know they probably don’t have the infrastructure for it but they should reclaim the waste water from all the people living in the homes and high rises and send it back to the lakes. And if the Panama’s government can’t they should get a loan from the US to install infrastructure for this case and the US should put a small interest on the loan but have a larger interest of discounted usage on the canal that will be used for American ships both privateer and military which then would save US tax payers and will help enforce more shipping companies to register with the US to help the US economy because they would save money on using the canal. Just my small thought process on this whole issue.
It's too bad the war mongers see more dollar signs in war than in trade which is why they keep enabling conditions that fund Iran's attempts to disrupt global trade and I'm not referring to pallets of cash although that was a problem I'm referring to increase petroleum cost that are kept elevated intentionally while still allowing for the most profitable endeavor known to man that being a constant state of War
This guy criticizing the shortage of fresh water created by the Nicaragua project while being totally OK with the shortage of fresh water in Panamá
Time to start using salt water to fill those locks. It's not rocket science it just requires some effort and resources that has thus far not been allocated for that but if you're willing to sit around and watch your biggest Cash Cow die then you panamanians are dumber than you look. Never mind I've got a much better idea...  This solution actually address is two problems at the same time for us here in the US who can simply Stop importing everything become self-sufficient again secure our borders and stop using them Panama Canal all together and therefore freeing up all of that freshwater for drinking by the panamanians problem(s) solved.
Propaganda. US inspired and propagated conflict.
The pronunciation of Bab al-Mandab Strait is off.
if a part of the problem is loading stuff on ships on the US east coast and then sending the ships through the Panama Canal, why not just send the containers by train to the West Coast and load the ships there? There are already railways available. Failing that, at the Panama Canal, (a) rebuild the locks so there are (e.g.) twice as many but the fall of each is half as much - reduces water per transit by half (b) backpumping at the lower lock levels so the water is not lost, but arranged so as to avoid ever getting salt water into the fresh water lakes (c) side ponds so the first 1/2 of the water released is saved to use for the next ship - a quick tour of canals around the world will produce all sorts of ideas for saving water. Water was always a major problem for early canal contructors.
Need to recycle the water. Instead of pumping into ocean, pump it into a holding tank or back to the lake.
Is this narrated by AI? Unsettling.
1:36 Cape Horn? Has the rapid speaking speaker forgotten about the Estrecho de Magallanes? It Is a significant short cut to avoid the icy icebergs near the cape Horn.
Why not just pump ocean water into the locks?
Blaming Climate Change again? How much money has this channel received from the governments?
make fresh water from ozean water, enough money the channel should make to pay for this?
Why take water away from the lakes when you could use the two oceans instead? The structure is there to use, so no one needs to build another wheel. And a bit off topic, we can all thank the brilliance of Carter's administration's foreign policy.
I wonder what it would take to pump most of that fresh water back into the lake instead of dumping it into the ocean....
1:42. Astronautical miles? Man, is that  long, interplanetary distances like the distance from our astro, the sun to us, 149.6 million kilometers, better stick to the SI units, but the error is understandable  , SI means Système Internacional des mesures, French, a language few understand, except Lesseps, who started to build ze Canal Du Panama.
So.   This hasn't been inevitable?
I’m surprised desalinisation isn’t mentioned in the video
It sounds like this can befitted with some desalination plants.
The research here is lacking. I live in Chile and there are several roads through Los Andes to Argentina. Trucks can come and go easily. As a matter of fact, the prices were so low on Argentina because of government helps that some people from Santiago in Chile choose to go to Mendoza in Argentina once a month (or so) to buy groceries. In the south I even have an uncle that runs a tourist business and take people on a bicycle tour to Argentina and back, through a very scenic trip. Now, the Amazonas I don't know. Perhaps someone else can comment on that?
Project Plowshare?
If the amount of water used for a single transit is so much higher than the water consumption of people, doesn't that make the decision to allocate water easier? Because then clearly the water consumption for people is negligible compared to the ships, so it doesn't even have to be considered. Any allocation for drinking water won't affect availability of water for the ships.
The one solution I didn't hear would be the cheapest and simplest. Recycling of the canal water back up into one of the upper locks. The entire system currently relies on gravity. So naturallyall the water required the operate the canal must flow to the ocean. The simple addition of pumping stations at either end would save enormous volumes of water and would cost a fraction of any of the other proposals you mentioned...
You’re wrong about the reduced amount of cargo reducing the amount of water used. The draft (the ships depth in the water) restricts the amount of cargo/ depth. If a ship were perfectly square, the same size of a lock,, minus an inch or two,  it would require mere tonnes of water to lower or raise it. If the draft/weight is reduced, it requires an equivalent amount of water on top of the reduced cargo to lift or lower the ship. Reduced cargo is increased amount of lake water used.
Interesting Fact about the Panama Canal. During WW2 when Countries like Japan were building the largest Battleship of all time (Yamato) the United States largest Battleship designs were limited by the width of the Panama Canal. So the United States largest battleship was the (Iowa Class Battleship) instead of building wider was built longer. The Iowa Class Battleship was a full 24 feet longer than the Yamato.  This extra length made the Iowa Class much faster than the Yamoto. Iowa's could travel up to 37 MPH meanwhile the Yamoto top speed was 31 MPH.
Dozed off on the canal history. Who cares?
US vassal state back by Israel. Houthis are their own thing.
The Houthi never have had a connection to Iran this is pure BS if they had then they would have had full access to Iran's drones this is obvious that this is not so whoever has made this false connection is trying to get into a war with Iran please stop the BS as it does no good in the past sources were believed but now they are not so if you say something prove it or shut the F up as a loose mouth can kill many got that
Lithium Ion batteries equals "green energy"............are you fucking kidding ?????????????????
And the Panama couldn’t simply build flood tanks instead of venting fresh water in to the sea?
So... losing access to the Panama Canal would possibly prevent us from starting WW III, starting with China?  And this is a problem... why?
I love that "climate change caused this crisis" translates to "We knew El Niño could create this problem but couldn't be bothered with preparation and now we need a scapegoat while ruling class hides their riches."
Maybe the United States should stop destabilizing the Middle East so oil companies can steal their resources.
You didn't mention that do to global warming. The northern pass is now open and shipping is going through it.
I wonder if it needs something like the Falkirk Wheel to stop the amount of fresh water being lost to sea.   Or more pumping of water from the low locks to the upper locks. would be costly but with solar and wind power shouldn't be too costly longer term.  The other option is more east -west rail routes across America.
Can't we use huge pumps to  fill and empty the water so lake won't loss fresh water?
Your audio quality in these videos has been going downhill, also you speak super quickly
If the U.S. is going to spend money, why not spend it here at home.  We have the ability and technology to build a super freight rail line across the country. There is still penty open country out west to build hubs needed to make these things effective and efficient.  This would negate a lot of the traffic going through Panama and make the goods in the country really cheap.  Yes it will require two trillion dollars but it would bring a new round of stability and prosperity to our nation.  It would raise our status around the world as a place to do business and start businesses.   We need to get the Over the Road Freight and the Airline Industries to back off and get on board if they really value this country.
Why not just make it so the whole thing runs at sea level, or am i missing something?
Why not just build a pump and use seawater to mitigate the fresh water usage?
Recycle the water in the highest lock back  To the lake
The fact that Panama is reducing traffic to save water, rather than installing desal plants for her people, shows that, as much of a boon as it has been, The Canal is also quite a burden. They're planning on making more lakes for increasing water supply, and there's been talk about increasing The Canal's capacity. But sharing the load across several of the mentioned options would alleviate a LOT of political and economic pressure.  Panama has been well paid, and likes her job, but she's been overworked for a while now. I can see her taking a "vacation" for a couple of years and expanding and refurbishing The Canal, as well as other industries.  I feel sorry for the politicians in charge. As the video mentions, if not handled properly, this could be the collapse of Panama in general. The pressure's on, kids. Try not to screw it up.
What is wrong with audio? I cannot watch this.
Ummmm....1. Why are they not installing a system that moves the water in lock number 1 back up hill or into a side storage tank.  2. The water shortage is going to become a bugger issue over time. The Saudi Arabians 🇸🇦 and Kuwaiti governments jave become experts in desalination plants. Panama could benifit from one at each end of the canal. They should make a trade for passage for free for tankers in exchange for getting a desalination plant built.  3. The North West Passage no longer holds ice pack 8 months of the year. It is now passable from Atlantic to Pacific between 6 to 9 months of the year without a lead ice braker and the other 6 to 3 month can still be done with a small ice braker in front. If traveling from say Paris to Seattle its actually faster to go north now. If Panama 🇵🇦 wants to remaine relevant they need to deal with this fast.
Why not find a narrow without mountains and dredge a wide trench from ocean to ocean? No locks, no fresh water. Would need bridges, tunnels for land passage north-south.
Bullshit:  Climate Change Climate Change Climate Change Climate Change Climate Change Climate Change
I wonder if there's any way to bite the bullet and alter the mechanics of the locks to use seawater for the first stage or 2? Pump water from the sea into lock 1 to raise it rather than pumping from 2 to 1.
In the short to medium term, why not place floating solar in out of the way parts of Lake Gatun to generate electricity but also to reduce evaporation and thus slow water loss from the lake?  This electricity can be used to desalinate seawater to reduce the dependency on the lake for drinking water as well and potentially add any excess fresh water back to the lakes. So instead of relying solely on rainfall to replenish the lakes they can assist it by other means, such as in times of drought.  This would be expensive but in the long run probably pay for itself.
Well, fuck the US miitary interest
32:10 ... You keep on doubling up on your prepositional phrases, "...within only a decade from now" ... Should simply be "...within only decade." ... The final tag phrase is redundant.  "... poorest part of the country for centuries (now?)"  "keeps the Panama Canal authority up at nights (the longest)."  "... continue growing worse (in the future)."  Please, in the name of all that's Holy, learn the economy of language.
ZZZZ climate change. Wake up brother.
PUMP THE WATER FROM THE LOWEST LEVEL BACK TO THE LAKE, NOT IN THE SEA.... PROBLEM SOLVED ! YOU'RE WELCOME !
28:30 corrupt elections in Nicaragua? You mean like the stolen election of 2020? You mean like the fake Biden presidency?    You mean like the 2014 coup d'etat in Ukraine that overthrew a duly elected presidency?  Do we have to go back to 1973 in Chile?  When I go all the way back to 1953 and throwing over the Iranian Prime Minister?  Or we could go back to 1946 and President Arbenz in Guatemala.  Think of all the peace that could have continued under Trump these past three or four years.  Think of gas being about $1.50!
No, reducing the displacement of the ships INCREASES the amount of water used in passage.
9:05 if 2023 was the second lowest rainfall, then don't we need to know when the first lowest rainfall was? Was it before all of this manmade climate change alarm is nonsense began?
why not just remove the gates and make a level passage way through it?
4 million people in Panama? Half the population of NYC. Where are the immigrants from said Panama? None of it seems to make much sense. Over 60 yrs now and I can’t say I have ever met anyone from Panama or seen a neighborhood chock full of Panamanians here in the US. All very mysterious. All govts are fake anyway. That route they keep showing from the US is only routes from east coast. Lol. Leaving the US from west coast eliminates this bs from the Panama Canal equations perpetuated here. So shut it. Really
5:38 The valve wouldn't "pump" water, it would simply let gravity take its natural course.... We never should have given back the Canal.
Have been through the Panama Canal nine times. Manmade climate change is bvllsh:+. The guy who started Greenpeace said so. Solar power on my house, 100,000 mi of homemade biofuels. Eat me.
Is there a reason you mentioned Iran but not the genocide in Gaza? It the stated reason they are blocking traffic.
Still no sources for the information? so useless
The chaos on both shortcuts is manufactured. Two reasons and both are western elitist and their sub circles perspectives. One. Control. Two. Choking off their competition before they become sincere rivals.  It's like two mafias manipulating people to get their way.  Terrorists to these mafias are simply henchmen.  ISIS was created, Hamas is a symptom, Houthis are also a symptom. All symptoms of war being waged for what they call "full spectrum domination".   It's a war being waged everywhere including your classrooms, workplaces, churches, synagogues, and mosques.
at least they have a heart. 105 days after oct 7, 2023, over 12,300 children and over 6,700 women in Palestine got killed by massive weaponry that the US and the western nations supplied to Israeli military.  Such high loss of human lives concern them more than business
No worries, the Mexican government is building its own canal.
It's me, guys. I'm sorry. I fell and dropped a pointy stuck and now the canal is leaking D:
Climate change will be causing meteor strikes next
Will the USA start caring about mitigating climate change now?
Why is the audio on this low quality
Why dont they reverse the pumps at the first lock and fill it with water from the seaward side. That way there wont be water loss from using the locks. It might require a new pumping system. But surely its an easier solution than anything else. Also, once through the first 3 locks, the pumped up water can be used for the reverse operation. I dont see why there should be water loss if they operated a closed system similar to a central heating system. There must be some simple (doesnt mean it will be a cheap one) solutions to this problem.
So install reversible pumps … 🤷🏼‍♂️
Funny how you started with Houthis attacking ships, leaving out the genocide in Gaza that the Houthis are responding to...  Was this a conscious choice, or were you unaware of the connection?
19:53 WHAT???  I traveled by bus from Colombia to Peru back in 1994..  pretty sure there are roads ;)
Would it not make more sense to bring water from the ocean, sufficiently desalinate it, and put it back into the lake? The salt can be either sent back into the ocean (so it nets the same overall) or used for other things, such as converting it into table salt.
Install pumps and siphons to convert Lake Gatun into a salt water system?  Install aqueduct system to import fresh water internationally to the Panama system? Use a desalination plant to control salinity in system?
Thank you jimmi caTER.... most everything you touched turned to s**t ...
It's too bad human society hasn't developed the technology to somehow magically Lift water uphill 🧐
As long as I have breath, I curse the name: "jimmy carter."
the yemeni people have a right to defend themselves and their territorial waters
Cargo Blimps begin to sound like a much better idea with all this going on.  And with Global warming still ongoing, routes through the Artic Ocean are something that might become a real option soon.
Can they add pumps to the system that would reverse the water discharged back to the other direction?
migrant Ebola
option 1: in the short term, pump the water from the bottom locks back up to the top water storage basins. They already use cross-filling with water storage basins to save a lot of water, so the pumps wouldn't have to pump the whole volume of each lock for each transit. Even though this would be very expensive, I would have thought the economic benefit of guaranteeing business as usual in a drought would be worthwhile. option 2: in the long term, lower the canal to sea level. The problem with this is it would have to be isolated from lake Gatun.
Instead of draining the last lock into the ocean, could you not pump it back to the lake?
🖕USA
Port of Cape Town waiting for the traffic 👀
Why not just lower the whole thing to sea level. Guess eco-nuts in the way as per usual?
"one transit uses the same amount of water as 0.5 million people". Yes, which is not that much water and all following transits will use the exact same water. This doesn't compound.
Panama Camal is one hurricane from having all the water they will need for 20 years...  Because it was in the same status about 25 years ago.  Then they had a hurricane and  the lake filled.
Seems the world could build a resivoir to captue the water from the last lock. Then pump it back up.    They do it with oil (pump it across countries), seems they could do it with water, but for oil once again. :)
Just make Israel stop their genocide and Yemen will stop its attacks.
could water pumps like hydro dams be used? Building a reservoir each side that collect the fresh water when levels equalise could be pumped back into the lake when electricity is in off-peak demand. This is how some Hydro Electric dams work.
The solution is fairly simple in concept, slightly difficult in execution, and expensive for the canal and ship owners - PUMPS. Capture the fresh water, pump it back to the top of the locks - it still needs to be kept separate from the lake water, due to contamination. Salt water probably cannot be used, as it will damage the locks and other systems.  Yep, BIG pumps, and that requires power (electricity or diesel) - not cheap, but what is the realistic alternative?
This is an easy but expensive fix .You need to pump water from the ocean .and I know vessels go though a lake of fresh water so if you want to keep it that way! You will need a desalination plant . But that will cost less than what you make a year .You need to use science instead of depending on the weather
Why doesn't Panama consider building a fast rail across from ocean to ocean?  The length of the railway will be so much shorter than the competition in South America.  And no need to rely on water levels, or destroy the environment.
Why can’t they just pump water from the ocean into the Panama Canal instead of using fresh water?
Wise one, don't waste time on Middle East is a trap
This is click bait, fear pron. No thanks.
Which of these proposed projects are most at risk of being hijacked and controlled by cartels, or would global interests pretty much never allow that to happen?
Interesting video. But I watched only until middle.
You might have mentioned that Houthis were *only blocking Israeli ships* in the Bab El-Mandeb strait, rather than "merchant shipping" in general, and they stated clearly that this action was in protest against the Israels treatment of the Palestinians, which the ICJ found showed prima facie evidence of genocide. Seems kinda important.  In Jan 2024, in a foolish attempt to stop the blockade, the UK/US bombed Yemen, and since then, the Houthis harass US and UK ships too.   Everyone else's ships are (at time of writing) permitted to pass through Bab El-Mandeb strait *without* harassment.   Slow hand clap, anglos. Have you heard of diplomacy?
Seems like very easy solution tbh. Just save the fresh water instead of flushing into ocean. Will be slower, but no waste.
Except russian and Chinese ships aren't even been affected by the attacks in the red sea.
Double the fee and hope that this will half the traffic... Wait until it rains or keep on earning the same with half the operating cost... Seriously that's like 5th grade capitalism
If only there was a way to make the capacity of a cargo ship into an aircraft, that way they don’t need to rely on anything beyond our planet having an atmosphere
Why dont they fill the Canal with ocean's salt water instead of the fresh water!?
y do they just use sea water
The video topic starts at 4:53
As for the Panama Canal, I find it extremely suspicious that the Canal started going to hell shortly after the Chinese took control of it. You'd assume the Panamanian government would fire the Chinese and hire a Company to run it that has no ulterior motives for wanting the canal to fail.
Why isn't Panama do what Israel did?  Desalination and Recyceling used water
Why not just pump water from the ocean into the gates
Maybe they can invest in desalination and use seawater under drought periods.
It's about time the USA dug a REAL canal, not a system of locks.  Just a actual waterway,  between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, at sea-level the whole way. It would remove that bottleneck from world shipping. And this time-- KEEP IT!
Is it possible to remove the locks and dig out the rock/dirt to create a direct connection between the Atlantic & Pacific oceans? Panama could still charge for passing thru but it would be very fast and wouldn't be subject to local rainfall totals.
Another crossing point if you are willing to load and unload from ship to train was used for years here in Canada. The st lawrence seaway leads from the atlantic ocean to the great lakes. Containers can be shipped to the top of lake Superior. Trains connect already to go west to the pacific ocean.  Songoods can get to UK AND Europe, and goods from the cross the pacific east to asia, and other island nations and south.   Best thing is the routes exist, it would justvrequire new container lake ships.
Because the Panamanians wouldn't fix the AUDITORY canal.  Giving it back to them, was the DUMBEST thing the US ever did-- even for Jimmy Carter. Americans should have elected Ronald Reagan in 1976, he wanted to KEEP it.
Voice quality is bad. Bad propaganda tainted channel.
Why not create a purification and filtration system where grabbing ocean water and piping that water back into the lakes as fresh drinkable water they'll be able to keep the lake topped off at any moment allowing them to maximize the number of ships per day to pass through the canal then they won't be losing any water due to drought. it would cost then some large amount of money but they would only really need to use it during a drought assuming they get enough rain and since they can control how much it costs to let ships go through they could have an increased fee during droughts to mitigate the use of the pumping filtration and purification systems to refill the lake and then they won't have an issue with drinking water either everyone wins except for the people who have to pay the additional drought cost but that's kind of the price you pay for convenience
They thought the El Nino would end this year. Unfortunately I read the other day that El Nino is predicted to be back.
Great stuff
The only country that is capable of building any great infrastructure, is China. They have technology and know-how of building these massive projects. They have proved that by what they have done in their own country.
bad design should reuse water duh
What battles me is why not find a way to pump Sea water into the first 2 gates? I get why it wasn't designed that way originally due to technological limitations and salt water not being kind on machines, but you'd think technology would be better now for that. Also there is the potential issue of contaminating Lake Gutan it is connected to, but based on what was said in this video that lake it doesn't seem like it was being used for drinking water anyway. (At least I hope it wasn't with all the potential contamination from the ships.)  I am sure there must be some other reason on why they haven't serious considered this yet, but it seems like an "easy" work around compared to the other proposals.
Only Isreali related and ships going to and from Isreal only. Get your facts correct
If the canal system raises the water level up 26m and then down again then why not flatten the middle section so you dont need to raise and lower the boats thus saving freshwater?
Old age?
You covered an incredible amount of ground in this very informative Video- TY for all the Statistical Facts and Analysis and Projections you laid down in this one…IMPRESSIVE!💪🏼👍🏼👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
So, just restructure the lake to use seawater instead? Expensive? Yes, but it's worth it. I bet everyone who is doing business on that route will gladly help to pay! 🙂
Once sea levels get high enough we won't need a canal at all because Panama will be under water. Good bye shipping crisis hello refugee crisis.
At about 8 minutes in, the background music becomes totally distracting.
why can't they just use train from one coast to the other?
Quick correction… As someone who has actually been through the Panama Canal… The water is not pumped. There are not any pumps involved, unless there are pumps in the new section. The original locks use gravity only. I do not know if that is the case for the new locks, but I would imagine so.
it seems like figuring out a de-salinization solution to solve the drinking water problem would be hand in hand with ignoring the ecologic disaster and converting Lake Gatun to a salt water lake, filled via pumping, instead of waiting on fresh water replenishment.
Your sound balance is off
simple (but maybe expensive fix) desalination plants on both coast to replentiate the lakes
The value of the Canal to Panama is exactly what will keep it from "dying".  It is valuable enough to Panama that it would be feasible to install a pumping & desalination system: pump water from the ocean, take out the salt, pump it into one of the two reservoirs. There's plenty of unused land around the Canal for solar power, too.  Some back-of-napkin numbers indicate that it would cost about $7 billion to to build a plant that would pump/desalinate the entirety of the water usage. But conceivably, rainfall isn't going to drop to zero any time soon, so figure about $3 billion. This is not beyond the capability of the government to do, especially to protect and even *enhance* an asset that brings in more than $4 billion/year.  You could plan a modular $7B plant, but build it incrementally by adding one pump/desalination/power module as needed, to keep yearly costs low.
I say we all pitch in and buy RLL a microphone that isn't out of a cereal box.
With the billions they make why not build pumping stations from the ocean side and just use sea water or is that just to easy
Put a 500MWe ThorCon TMSR there, to provide the energy to always  lower water levels in lowest locks by pumping 90% of it to new storage and filtration ponds along side the upper locks. QED
I don't understand how lithium ion is considered "Green Energy"
is it just me or why is the audio SO TRASHY
Slight correction for you, sir: Panama took over control a year before the new millennium.
The next giant leap for the North American continent would be the unification of America and Canada in order to provide enough clout to develop an arctic route for goods. As it stands now, the border between the two great nations divides people, creates tension between some people and stunts the growth of the two countries.  On another note, just thing of the number of Canaians who have gone to seek their fame and fortuneand achieved their dreams. The reverse move has not happened.
Too freaking long!! Didn't finish.
Oh no not climate change again!!!!!!
Hope that AMLO and future mexican governments really finish the Transatlantic.   It would help not only México, but the entire world. Only I Hope that It doesn't get cancelled like Mexico's City New airport....
Why not just pump seawater to operate the locks?  The amounts of water don't seem crazy since the bottleneck is actually the amount of ships going through the lock.
Why the hell did they give the canal away!
Interesting, except for the climate hoax propaganda
why dont they just add another pump and a reservoir that keeps the water they would have pumped out? stop wasting it? reuse it? even some of it per ship would help.
None of the water used in the Panama Canal is pumped. The ships are raised by water flowing from an upper lock chamber to a lower chamber. Ships are lowered by lowering the water level in the upper chamber were the ship is to the upper level of the next lower chamber.
Idk why would you travel through the Panama canal and didn't make another base on the another side of your island. Man, I'm so confused....
Y use trucks y not rail
Yeah, the weather caused the weather to weather all the weather. Blah, blah, blah.  Snooze fest bullshit.
Climate change. Climate change. Climate change. 😅😅😅 Brilliant.
Sounds like they need to build more ports and ship yards on the East and West Coast of the US for trade to keep up with the rest of the world and until they are built we will have supply chain issues.
Another thing Panama can do is instead of dumping the water into the ocean, pump it back into the lakes. Would that help with the water problem?
So your climate hysteria is based on your definition of history beginning in 1950?  How dumb is that?
Climate change is a scheme to defraud the middle class…
Geo-engineering with particulate suspended matter will reduce the rain cycle. HAARP or Reduced geo-magnetic field could possibly do the same. One can imaging the energy a reverse pumping scheme would require to conserve water but at some point it might become necessary.
Amazing amount of information. We have a political crisis affecting trades in the Middle East and a climate crisis affecting trade in central America for the northeast in China. Double whammy. The world is far less secure than in the past. For so many reasons ! 😳🤷🏼‍♂️💰🤑
This water problem is mainly due to the Globalist playing God with their Geoengineering under the guise of their so called :climate change". I reality "they" want the populations that can survive to live in grass huts when they are not at work in prison factories.
just wait a few years and youll probably get more rain than you need, thats what happened in Australia, we were in drought and all of a sudden been raining non stop in qld
Is there a reason they can't use water pumped from either ocean instead of the fresh water from the lakes? Honest question.
How can it dry up when the sea level is rising?
La Nina forecast to come by the nothern summer
Yet another bullshit climate scare! Expect more price hikes and bullshit comming from this. Just 70 years of measurement for rainfall, then calling it the worst crices, but later on we're told the 2nd dryest year!!!
Good thing there is a huge ocean that it can get water for the canal.
Use industrial pumps and use sea water for the locks during drought conditions. Both Atlantic and Pacific?
why don't warships on the west coast go to China instead of ships from the east coast?
Sure we can blame on global warming but global warming is thanks to the human population growing exponentially, the population more than tripled in a little over 100 years. The solution to every global crisis can be prevented by having less children to start. Resources are finite so matter how greatly or poorly distributed the are because if nothing is done, we'll reach 10 bil and have fished everything from the oceans and deforsted everything....  Time to implement a 1-child policy across the board, and if you want a second one, pay up or adopt. Vasectomies should become mandatory past the age of 45 or so. If you have a second illegal child and didn't pay, punishments should be very high. This is for the planet, not your selfish desires.
Build more large pools next to the locks to pump the water into and out of instead of pumping the water into the ocean. Basically recycling the water. More ships on the lake will displace more water which will increase its depth. Another possibility is sending more ships in one direction for a set period of time. Then reverse the direction.
giving canal back to Panama was a dumb idea
Geez, if this guy says "climate change" one more time  gonna hurl.
Perhaps it is time to construct and deploy fleets of gargantuan dirigibles?
It seems to me that the heavier the ship, the less water in the lock. The draft is another issue, when traveling through the lake.
Climate change is there as part of the dinamic earth. Adapt or die
6:40 Instead of pumping the water from the first lock into the ocean when you're done with it, pump it back into the lake. Problem solved and you can say that you beat climate change in this instance.
How skillful you avoided mentioning Israel and Palestine but put in Iran and China. Good job!
If the US were to engage in Asia, it is rather unlikely she would deploy assets from anything other than the Pacific/Indian Ocean and Western regions. 7th fleet fast followed by 3rd fleet.
Can they pump water from the ocean instead to raise or lower the gates?
Climate change will cause more rain...or less rain...or more rain...or is it less rain...wait, it's more rain. OK, it doesn't matter. It's whatever we want it to be to make our point and use it as a hammer to make changes to "whatever" we want. Thaaaanks Marx.
Recycle the water used to fill the locks for gods sake...instead of. Pumping it into the ocean pump it back to the lake or find a way of using it again ..I'm sure a way can be found to do that.
So.... pump the fresh water from the lower most loch back into the reservoir using a floating intake? Like, stop flushing it into the ocean duh.
The trucks for option 1 will never compete with any train. One operator per two or three containers compared to two operators per hundreds of containers. And trains can't compete with the ships each carrying thousands of containers. Fuel consumption per container mile makes it cheaper to go around. It's not even faster. The ports are most of the way south in South America and the time to off load at one end and reload at the would be more than just sailing around from one port to the other. The only competitive option is another canal, hopefully at sea level the whole way, so no locks like Suez.
Time to design some salt water pumps.
How far is the canal from the ocean…how about getting the water for the bridge from the ocean?
What kind of leftist feminist garbage is this?  Must everything be blamed on the climate change boogeyman?
Recycle the water.  And clean up the lakes!
COSTA RICA dry canal is the best choice with 100km in length. Could be double capacity road and train. EASY BREEZE... Self pay to any investment
It’s pronounced route not rout!
what have i missed? why not use sea water?
Can they not pump the water from the lowering of the levels back into the lake?
As a Panamenian I didn't fucking know that the canal was drying.
12:40 But wouldn't it take less water for a larger ship?
We're 30 trillion $$$$$$$$$$$ in debt, do we need to be investing billions more $$$$$$$ into some other nations infrastructure ?  Nations like Mexico aren't our true friend, never have been,  and are subject to turning against us when they feel that they don't need us anymore..
Why don’t they just spray barium salt in the sky? It rains for 3 fkn days every time they do it in Sydney
maybe I'm naïve but couldn't panama just recycle the used water back into the canal system instead of discharging it into the ocean. seems too obvious to not be thought of though must be something making this not possible.
There is a simple solution for this. It will cost much money, but very doable. They can construct artificial reservoir that can store extra water and where they can pump water into and even pump seawater into if needed. It will cost much money and take time for sure, but will still be very much worth it for Panama. Claiming that the canal is dying is just silly speculation.
I'm surprise it took you 5 whole minutes to expose yourself as a climate Cultist wacko jacko.
Why does it just feel like we will end up back in Iraq and back in Afghanistan?
piece of cake.    put some tanks on the side.  when water is pumped down to raise a ship.   pump that into tanks for the next ship to be raised.
The Western country need to leave middle east.
Я живу в Панаме. К сожалению в видео забыли упомянуть об огромном скандале, связанным с  китайско- канадской компанией  компанией First Quantum, которая построила в Панаме медные рудники. Продажные президенты Панамы за миллионые взятки официально отодвинули границы национальных природных заповедников, в которых протекали множество рек, питающих озеро Гатун. Во время работы First Quantum эти реки были полностью опустошены и учёные говорят о разрушающем влиянии на экологию Панамы. Проэкт был закрыт, но виновных ,как всегда в Латинской Америке, никто не найдет
So this might be a stupid question, but why not just pump the water from the first gate back up to the lake instead of dumping it into sea level?
China.. owns the canel
This is all very interesting and completly caused by some lazy engineers that didn't add water reservoirs to hold the fresh water instead of wastefully dumping into the ocean with every ship like fresh water will last forever 🙄That just seems crazy! 🙈
I don't see how these canals can be considerred "rivals" when there's too much traffic for both to handle. Basically, each will get as much traffic and money as it can take in.
World's No:1 writer Captain Ajit Vadakayil elaborated this in detail on Mar, 2022. Google 'el nino and la nina a mariners overview capt ajit vadakayil' for more details.
the irony that climate change could also worsen climate change because the ships aren't stopping, and just burning more fuel.
Use ocean water to fill the locks and recycle it from one end to the other (closed system). Large volume pumps could be used for transfer of the water.  Building a new canal is just a sales pitch to generate more tax $$$$$$$ for the Industrial Complex. (always something newer, bigger, better, and more costly.)
Can’t help but think that shipping by road/rail from Houston to LA would be cheaper than the Bi-Oceanic Corridor through Paraguay and three other countries.
is it just me or would this be better without the background music? Intresting & informative but finding that music does annoy me a bit.
“Between the US east coast and..” whatever happened to Canada and Mexico?
The host makes comments that imply we understand climate change, and we do not.
So, will the US step in to actually fight climate change now that the effects are disrupting trade?
"Death by a thousand cuts" sounds pretty accurate when your currency is based upon bribes and Bitcoin.
Now both SA’s are seeing epic commerce action
There is NO SUCH THING AS climate change!  I wonder what else is in error in your reporting?  ❤
Turn them into Glass, at least when Britannia ruled the waves, the pirates were nervous
Surely the answer is to pump the water back into the lake, instead of releasing it out to sea.
I really don't get why Panama does not pump water back up, with big enough pumps reaching 100 m3 per second it should only take about half an hour and cost about $2500 in power.
For the ships going around both South America and Africa, why not just stay in the south Atlantic, reducing some of the lost time?
Dig the canal deeper?
Seems like a rather easy engineering problem. Pump water back up. You already have most of the infrastructure in place. Only need an adapted pipe from lowest to highest. I'm sure it can be retrofit in less than two years.
I hope there both shut down, this will make manufacturing in foreign  countries less attractive and might bring manufacturing home where it belongs.
Ironically, the canal isn't really that critical. The US has a vast and efficient freight rail network that can easily transport goods from east coast to west coast. The rest of central and south america is hardly relevant on the world economic stage, aside from maybe brazil, so them benefiting from the canal barely matters. And central america is so thin that they can transport their goods easily into either ocean using rail and road networks over land. The main issue with not having the canal is that it will simply take longer to ship goods as transporting them over land is far less efficient. Like, let's say goods produced in california need to go to europe, you can simply transport them via rail to the east coast (or even just any coast on the carribean) and then ship them, instead of shipping them through the panama canal. It's probably even faster to do that tbh, though will have less capacity.
Ah yes climate warming.  Remember back in the 70’s when it was all artic blast coldest on record and then they said oh and btw by 2020 we will run out of oil there be none left.  Well so far then been 100% wrong 100% of the time.
They will pump seawater in there if they have to but it will still be operational.
What invasion ? Taiwan is literally a part of China , it is IN China.  Right ?
Man-made climate change is not to blame, because it's inconsequential.
Latin America: DO NOT ever do business with China. You WILL REGRET IT!!!
I didn't realize Mexico had such a potentially viable railway alternative to the canal. Thank you for another interesting and informative episode. I didn't even know Panama was struggling to supply water for the canal. God be with you out there everybody. ✝️ :)
The recent widening of the Canal has affected the amount of water used.  The increase capacity probably did not consider the water needs in low rain years.
Sounds to me like the Panamanians better man up and install a pumping system that can pull water from the sea to operate the locks. Im sure they can afford it.
In other words: If China develops weather control technology to keep it from raining in Panama they can effectively cripple the US military response time?
I was trying to figure out how you were going to bring up global warming in this thing. It’s a shame I knew you would. I shut it off right after I heard that if the shame I really wanted to watch that.
why dont they just pump the water back into the lake :3 ?
China desires this outcome and why they took control.
Instead of discharging all the fresh water into the ocean, why can't you make the locks parallel where one ship enters the Panama Canal and the other exits? That the water that would be dumped during lowering the ship to sea level for the ship sailing out is now pumped into the other lock of the ship that wants to enter the Papanama canal and need the water to rise the ship.   So if you do that no considerable amount of water is lost if you keep it in the loop.
If Canada would have built a much larger port in the Vancouver area and another on the east coast in Quebec and/or maybe Sault St. Marie. Also they would need to put in a dual rail line to the east coast (running a much straighter pair of lines through a tunnel through the Rockies). Of course, they would be advised to use European technology/companies to do the tunneling.  Knowing there are now rail cars where a semi trailer can be backed right onto them, no matter what the cargo is. Canada should invest heavily in electric cargo trains anyways. We should be getting a large percentage  of the semi trucks and trailers off the long haul roads anyways.   The problem with Mexico is they have the issue of the cartels.
Lost me at the harping on about Climate change, and records going "WAY BACK" to the 1950's. 70 years of records. That's it?  Give me a break.
They should engineer a 26m deep gorge for a alternative channel. So the hole canal can de at see level and doesn't need logs.
You know i can name 6 ways freight can get around the Panama Canal... they are known as Norfolk Southern, CSX, Canadian Pacific, Canadian National, BNSF, and Union Pacific. They can haul a ships worth of containers easily overland when they aren't falling apart!
Why don't they just change how the locks work?  Seems they need a holding tank instead of dumping water into the ocean.  Should be solvable with the money they are getting from it.  Maybe put some of that bribe money to work.
The elephant in the room is: why don't they simply safe the water by pumping it back and forth between the locks? Now they just let it flow down, but if they used huge pumps to pump it back afterwards, the water would not be wasted.  I understand that they would need to be careful not to contaminate the lake with sea water too much, but that could be minimized by still letting some lake water out.
Chat GPT generated gets a -
Why can’t the used lower lock water or ocean water be pumped back up into the upper locks? Or into the lake?
Why not just build rails through Panama and Nicaragua? It doesn't seem like melting permafrost in the andes is being taken into account. Also that such a long connection between the Pacific and the Atlantic isn't being looked upon in terms of potential conflict and thus rising costs of transport is somewhat distressing...
Here’s an idea why not use sea water instead. Theirs plenty of it and you can leave the freshwater alone to use it for other uses!! 😊
What about pumping water from the ocean into the first lock?  just reverse the flow on one end, and keep it standard on the other.
panama decision are imbecile.  contionue full canal operations and use the money to build sea 3water transformation centers.  long term solution,   but these country are poor for good reasons.  they have no visions.
and the governments had decades to get de-salination technology installed, as well as fixing the lock system so the water equalibrium doesnt lose water to the ocean... Oh.. so just blaim climate change instead. This is another reason to follow the money.
Why not Invest some of the profits to build a lake bypass canal?
They're only targeting Israeli related ships.
why not  sea level in the canal ?
china is said to own the towns on either  end ..  why did jimmy carter give away thhe canal ?
Climate change BS. Too much ship traffic with Asia. Once more manufacturing is moved back to North and South America this will clear up.
EXCELLENT MOVE PARAGUAY BLL DIN DO HAYWAY IT'S ONE OF DO BEST DEALS U AD DID
What would be the economics of using solar-powered pumps to return the fresh water to the lake on lock level change?
Y NOT BLL A CANAL IN COSTARICA OR NICARAGUA JUST STOP DO TAKING N START  DIGGING N IT WLL SALVE ALL OFF YOUR PROBLEM
Why not a freight railroad along with the road for the Bi-Oceanic Corridor? Too steep for railroad?
Why does the audio sound bad on this video? The voice/micrphone/etc is not as good as in other videos. I thought it was my speakers at first.
Why not setup a couple of huge salt water de-sanilation plants. Take the salt out of the saltwater and pump it into the lake. You would pump into the lakes via underground pipes or through channels built on top of the ground.
Your mic was a little ear raped on this one hahah
Why can't they pump sea water instead of wasting all that fresh water?
Why do all you tube narators have to speak in that homersexual accent?
Global warming? Turned it off. Thumbs down. Bye bye.
Not to mention that the CCP are buying up land that drains into the canal. And slowing the flow. Which is in their martial interest.  Global warming is a United Nations, WEF lie.
So.... what you're saying is that China should send a cargo ship packed with explosives through the panama canal and coordinate its detonation with their preemptive strikes on our protectorates?
So this is a complete NON-ISSUE.  Ok.  Rain fall is down.  The canal is vitally important.  Build a solar powered desalanization plant to convert sea water into fresh water and replenish the canal.  The ocean is righth there.  This is absolutely solvable with current technology, just add money.  The canal is "vital", so obviously the money can be found.  If nothing else the US will end up doing something because as stated we need this.
Would it be at all feasible to deploy massive pumps to flood the lake area with sea water?
2:30 When Jimmy Carter gave it away. An economic illiterate.
Panama canal start using water from the sea. It's not rocket science
There's no reason for US freight to go through the Panama canal.
Sounds like all they need to do is instead of releasing the last locks of water to the ocean they need to pump it back up to the lake problem solved.  You could also put a desalination plant and have it pump its water back up to the lake or both.
LOL yeah, sure. "Climate Change." Totally not weather CYCLES.
Looks like its time to invest more in to the artic passage
Good video touching on many of the details of this global shipping challenge.  One important detail about the Red Sea conflict is the HIGH cost or War Insurance making a transit through the Suez Canal prohibitively expensive even they don't end up being targetted by a Houthi lauched missile. Another detail about The Drake Passage is at some times of the year, those waters are EXTREMELY dangerous.  Even at good times The Drake Passage is no walk in the park. I'm  not trying to impugn the Bi-Oceanic Corridor, but it takes on average about 500 trucks to move the same cargo as one large ship.  More Traffic, more fuel burn, heavy wear on the road, and slower frieght movement overall. That being said, if the Panama canal thru-put continues to slide, any new possible shipping method will help. Also, the exchange of goods between both coasts of South America WILL benefit from the Bi-Oceanic Corridor in any case. The Interoceanic corridor railway would definitely provide greater thru-put than the proposed roadway to the south. Trains can carry much more than trucks and are more fuel efficient as well. BUT still nothing beats the cargo shipping economy of a large cargo ship.
Seeking content on South American countries as it relates to geo-politics; (sic:drugs), economics and migration. Attention to American influences.
It's called seasons
Pump the water from the ocean for the first lock. 33% less fresh water needed. Problem solved.
Much of the canal traffic can be bridged by US and Canadian railroads that routinely run stack trains with ship's containers from coast to coast. It'll keep our east and west coast ports busy too.
1:32 that's probably why California and Newsom are China lovers. They're the closest. It's strategic for China.
I dont think that any railway will be a viable alternative. You would have to unload a huge ship, transport their load by many trains and then load another huge ship. That is very expensive (in operation, not to build) and a lot of effort and logistics. Those numbers from Mexico are not real, that is just what they clam, it will never be like that. Any viable solution will have to be a canal to transport the ship as a whole.  In the end, there will be a way to fix the panama canal if the issue occurs again, using huge pumps and so on.
With respect to the diagram @5:41, rather than pumping the water from #1 out to the ocean, why not recycle it by pumping it in the opposite direction and up to a storage tank, then replenishing #3 from the tank rather than the lake?  It would require more energy but much less lake water (you still need some to replace loss through inefficiencies).  You could go further by building a nuclear reactor for power and, if you don't need fresh water in the canal, eliminating the need for lake water by pumping new water from the ocean.
4:38 My first ship as a cadet
Hate to say it. I’m really interested in this video but the narrator is talking way too fast for me to process what he’s saying. Note: I’ve got audio processing disorder, so that’s probably what’s causing it.
There's another option that wasn't mentioned. If the climate keeps changing then you can just sail through the Artic
Pump up water back to the system ,problem solve yagoong
You would think they would of used (still can) salt water  rather than fresh, after all they just dump ut back into the ocean 🤷‍♀
Or, instead of dumping the fresh water into the ocean, you can pump it back into the lakes.
It's been decades the autorities could've invest in just a sea to sea passage and stop worrying about fresh water reservoirs.
Narrator is saying things that dont match up to the video, @11:05 he says 1/2Million peoples consumption but the graphic says 2.25M people.
The American Naval Fleet need A new Option , It's not just about trade .
I also thought there was a plan to use the North passage through Canadian water?
why not foix it up where the drinking water can be dumped and collected so its a win win for both?
Isnt it better to use a train rather than trucks to transport goods on ground?
Couldn’t they just pump the fresh water back up? Or atleast parts of it?
Simplified version: The Panama canal is dying because of a flawed and wasteful design. And yes I know it was built a century ago, but they've had TIME to update it for when climate change struck.
While I understand it would use a lot of power (power that could easily be generated by Solar or Tidal generators), the "easy" solution (there is no easy solution) would surely be some way of pumping the lock water back *up* the lock chain, surely? To me that sounds like an easier and cheaper alternative to all of the options discussed here (although the Mexican and/or Colombian rail solutions sound workable and a good idea in any event anyway)
I think anytime someone says "passing cost on to the consumer" their next sentence should be "which could be reduced if corporations stopped price gouging"
I thought most canals, including Panama pumped their water back into a separate resouvouir?
I'm only 12 minutes in, but you haven't even mentioned the obvious solution.   Instead of releasing the water from the lowest-level locks into the sea, pump it back into one of the higher-level locks. Sure, this would require some massive pumps, but that's an engineering problem.
Maybe array of solar panels and batters is a good idea, to use pumps instead of gravity, and then we have no limit, and we are not using water  ... I'm curious why this is not under consideration ? :)
I wonder why this program spends so much time talking about 'crack pot' ideas and so little talking about the enlargement of infrastructure that is already operating successfully like the Panama Railroad? The Panama Railroad is already carrying large amounts of freight and transports more freight per mile of track than any railroad in the world and yet it isn't mentioned at all. That's just not a simple overlook by the producers of this program, it is a tactic to promote the other projects mentioned.
Build another one  at sea level  that doesn't need  locks. ❤😅😂
Hahahaha, lithium ion and green energy are two things I did not think I'd here in the same sentence. The process to make and store energy in lithium batteries is by no means green.
That’s why a sea level canal through Nicaragua has been revived as a possibility. It has been surveyed extensively and the route is well known.
a very misleading question!  Perhaps WHY DO MAJOR WORLD GOVERNMENTS WANT THE CANNAL TO FAIL?   Without inappropriate questions, you can never achieve relevant responses!  Try leading by enriching rather than deceiving, After all you're not a government.  Now hear is a real question:  Isriel fills lakes with desalinated salt water, doesn't the rest of the world have pumps too?
Solving the Panama Canal's water problem by taking water from the Indio R. and directing it to Lake Gatun is nothing more or less than robbing one group of people in order to pay another group of people. Where have we heard this before? Some place in a Russian soviet, I believe. The genius's took water from one great body and directed it to other areas, thinking they were going to establish a great cotton field industry. And now that area is nothing but sand and dust. To the people who depend on the Indio River I would say, "Beware!"
Dumb question: why not use sea water instead of fresh water?
The problem can be fixed by pumping the water back into the lochs instead of the oceans. With a constant flow of traffic through the canal it's possible. It will be a  little more expensive but it is easily doable.
Punps pumps pumps pumps pumps!!!
climate change, huh magats!
Colombia already has plenty of exports and is very integrated in the global economy. Although, their variety of exports is very limited.
the project is wrog...instead of using fresh water the designer should choose to use salt water
With seas on either side, I don't quite get why there is a need for fresh water to operate these locks.  Perhaps there is a lack of WILL or FUNDS to make this work.
The problem with said Canal is a drought. Yes there is a drought in Panama. I think because of the El Neeno that is effecting the weather right now. When the drought ends, it will come back to normal. Yes the whole gate problem can be solved, with time and money. We never should have give the canal to Panama. I do not think they have the technology to keep it running. Only time will tell.
Maybe they should dig the lakes out larger so when they fill they can hold more water.  They could also dig wells for the people.
I'm no engineer, but why is the water wasted into the ocean, why is not pumped into a hold reservoir and reused?
We're gonna destroy this beautiful world and it's habitat on account of our constantly growing greed 😢
Well duh—build a pump and water line that takes the water out of the second lock to the people as well as pumping the water from the last lock last lock and sends it back to a desalination plant where it combined with ocean water to be used by people. If the Panamanian government can’t afford the construction costs the U.S. should reaquire  rights to use the canal in return for doing the building. As a side note ship the illegals from here to work there  in return for possible legal return here.
I smell WEF.
1.5 Millionth
Hear me out, what if we dug down another 30 meters and just connected those two oceans, put a single gate on each side (the two oceans are never the same level)? Problem solved, the whole system would be salt water only, and ocean water could easily be pumped in to keep the canal filled as necessary.  The 30 meter drop in water level would eliminate the artificial lake restoring that part of the land back to the way it was after a couple decades.  Panama keeps it's canal and vital revenue source, the world keeps a vital canal open, and no more locks that require fresh water. No, that won't be cheap. No it won't be easy. But it's a permanent solution, with the bonus of a partial restoration of nature.
As usual, political lack of planning
I remember that a female captain (got position due to her birth) crashed a cruise ship into the canal and stopped the trade through that area in 2022
go back to local production in europe and USA and trade across the Atlantic.
*cartels rub their hands together gleefully*
Why does the audio sound so... Weird?
Crew less sailing ships are coming up more and more in discussions about this topic.
South America dry canal will be always longer (more time) that to open un Central America one.  Thus cheaper and faster in Central America.
They should boycott the canal to pressure Panama to so something about it
Well, could you recycle the usages between gates?  Just open a reservua of the recycle dimensions. Walaaaaaa,  gave the solution.  Please send 1 million dolars.  OsoYolo, Antigua Guatemala.
El istmo de Tehuantepec is the future, mexico will controll the word
I know there must be an easy answer to this question or else they'd do it: why can't they increase the toll on the Canal to pay the electricity to pump seawater uphill into a manmade reservoir right beside the locks? Clearly the pumps can deal with high volume as they lift and lower boats 24m in just 2 sections. Why not continuously pump sea water directly up 30m into a lock reservoir and release it as needed? This would free up the freshwater lakes for civilian use.
just dont pump the water into the ocean. problem solved huh
Panama offers amazing retirement VISA and was a destination before my due diligence taught me why stranding myself there would not be a good idea, but what a wonderful place! Why not for me? Too much colonization bullying the indigenous tribes who pretty much raise all the county's food. A hydro dam (desperately needed but it's placement very questionable and done without consent of the landholders) base skirting indigenous lands and once completed will flood them and the food base gone. The colonization is defining classes, haves and have nots. There is a great expat YouTube channel and he says pooh-pooh to any of these situations and c'mon down the water is fine! Hmmmmm
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 ✊🏽
I guess rail lines are useless, huh? Such massive stupidity all around.
Well researched video as always, but man, the audio for this video is grating with the extra gain. You're often my top pick to listen/watch while doing stuff around the house, but I couldn't finish this one as someone with high auditory sensitivity. No hate at all, much love and best wishes to your team, but please look into this issue!
Why not pump sea water up into the locks to supplement the lost water in dry years? You can keep the water in the lake fresh for use by locals by pumping it into the uppermost  locks.
If we get enough sea level rise then the problem is solved
The Panama-Canal's greatest boon is also it's greatest drawback. That is it's reliance on Lake Gatun. Having the lake saved them the building of additional locks and blasting through mountains, but also makes the entire systems reliant on the lake's water level (as shown in the video). The Suez Canal by comparison doesn't has that problem because it runs on the saltwater that enters through the locks on either end. Of course doing that in Panama would make Gatun saline and ruin the freshwater source for the citizens of the country. The only feasible way to fix this that I see is too decouple the lake from the Canal system and have it run on saltwater without affecting the lake's salt content.
Climate change has nothing to do with it. There is no climate crisis.
Why not to pump water back? Yes, it would cost something but it's better than shut down.
No mention of the northwest passage?
Silver lining to the climate change that's closing the Panama canal is that the Arctic will soon be tranversable by see. Down side is various countries are already staking claims in the Arctic and we might soon have conflicts over these new trade routes and accessible natural resources around them
Quicker to actually go around Africa then South America. :p  Shorter by 3-6k miles. also going around the horn of South America isn't often safe weather wise.  Umm, something like the South Aermica overland road canal has been done before, the Greeks did it to carry boats between the north and south ends right where the Canale di Corìnto use to be a road with logs used to roll boats over land, before they dug it out and filled it with water.
I know nothing about engineering but I have to ask the question. Can't they just retrofit the canal somehow to recycle the water instead of just losing it. Where does it go?
Holy shit. Please turn down your gain.
Colombia seems doable
Stop dumping the water in the ocean, pump it into a holding reservoir the equivalent in size to the water in the lock and dredge a narrow channel in the lake to the exit point. That will last a long time and the extra pumping charges are not that big a deal
Two lane, same water
Mexico seem doable
El Niño is Spanish for, the nino.
I really do get sick and tired of hearing about 'climate change' being the root of all problems.  The fact of the matter is that climate changes.  If you want to believe it's man made and therefore man can 'fix' it, then go right ahead with that fantasy.  The fact of the matter is that the Panama canal is being used in a way it was never designed to be used.  Sorry, Panama, your 4.3 billion dollar toy isn't up to snuff anymore.  You can either adapt and overcome or have channels like this one use it as a platform for their own political views.  Set the daily limit to 12 ships, still make a ton of money, AND provide fresh drinking water to your citizens.  BTW, Panama, you do understand the importance of drinking water, don't you?  This is a made up crisis that I really don't give a sh*t about.
Isn't it amazing that whenever infrastructure is given away by Northern European whites, it goes to sh/t?
It's a strange channel he4. Some good facts and alot of propaganda
Sound is worse than the usual high standard.
Not gonna mention why the Houthis are blockading the red sea, huh?
Are they narrating these by phone call now?  Something definitely changed in the sound quality in the past 3-5 months.
Why can’t lock 1 use salt water from the ocean? Or why can a reservoir be constructed to capture and reuse the fresh water instead of flushing it into the ocean?  Either way, I was wondering this as soon as the problem was described. I am certain I am missing something, but am curious as to what.
Because it is being run by a corrupt and incompetent government?  Should America retake panama and own it again?  Will Lassie save Jimmy in time to get to school?  Why is there air?
18:16 my god we South Americans really love to use a bazillion trucks to carry cargo that some trains could do in much, much less time and emissions. We do be USAs lapdogs till this day
28:15  “Only 900 million dollars “ 😂😂😂
"iran backed" but doesnt mention they are only targetting ships carrying military equipment to israel....
Talk a little slower please. Love your content!!!
When the bi oceaneianic road comes on line will ten car long truck, and buss trains a reality. Possibly run by eltricty like a tram eventually?
If the government of America built the Panama Canal at sea level the Suez Canal being shut down by Iran would not be as important 😊
The Panama Canal could also invest on Reusing the water that fills tle Locks, It's an investment, but hey, If you don't do nothing, you will finally really do nothing!, Just a few storage ponds and really big pumps will help them a lot! And of course prevent contamination with salty seawater!
This piece claims that ships w/o reservations sometimes "pay bribes" to canal operators.  Then they go on to cite prices paid to "skip the line".  If these were bribes, we wouldn't really know the amounts involved.  This sounds like an organized bidding process to auction off canal crossing space.  NOT A BRIBE.  Bribes and organized auctions are very different things ... especially morally.  Why does this "author" spin facts into fables?  Is it to smear the operators??
as Always when a gringo says "the world" he is refering to the usa
Mexico will complete its project. Watch out world
Perhaps the government of Panama could use the money generated by the canal to invest in desalinization equipment so that people can drink the ocean water.
26 meters a little digging problem solved.
Can't they just repump the water back up?
Thank you
Since they are near the equator they should get a lot of sunlight. How useful would a solar powered desalination plant be? Would it produce enough fresh water?
Pretty sure the cost of fuel for trucks is 1000x more than the cost of fuel for a ship. So the extra couple weeks at sea going around is still worth it
18:16 trucks!!!? Seriously!? Trucks, are u kidding me? The whole thing is a result of climate change and they propose trucks... Why not trains!? Trains exist ffs
Reading the comments there are many solutions but the usual panic reporting meant to scare us is the way lefty media works.
What's the big deal. They'll fix it. This project is worth billions of dollars annually. If they have to build another Reservoir or pumps or whatever they have to build even a Great Pyramid they'll do it.
lowest rainfall in Panama "HISTORY "  As long as Panama's history doesn't go back past 1950's😂
Giant Trebuchet
Why don't they pump the water they use back up to the lock above instead of pumping it into the ocean?  That way it would be self-sustaining using the same water over and over again.
Another proposed dry canal is in Guatemala by train
People tend to waste a lot of water. Ration the water to the population. They would learn not to waste.
We lost 35,000 workers building that canal. Then Carter and the democrats gave it away.
Ok, they sre getting paid to ferry ships in the Panama canal. Desalination is a thing.. use that money to do that, it's a  business, you don't akways have to profit every year... simple economics..
They need to eliminate unnecessary complexity.
It’s ok with global warming it will be possible to use the Northwest passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
😂🤣
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz more bs
Likely a stupid question but why did they design it that they have to raise and lower it again instead of just building a straight channel? You can still have doors that need to open and collect tolls without the water needing to be moved. Hell, you could drain it between ships and let it rush in from both sides. (yes this will irrode like crazy and not be sustainable)
So what you’re saying is: we have a desalination problem that only Israel can solve. Maybe it’s time to let the good guys fight war their way
I, too, am Panamainian, and I wonder why this video does not mention the already existing railway that exists in Panama. This railway runs from the Pacific to the Atlantic adjacent to the canal. This video just tries to raise an alarm without giving all the info available. I guess it's a good way to creat traffic.
The solution isn't that much. Simply pump water from the main body of the canal to raise the water level in the lock!
Due to the corruption by the current administration and people who deny God.
As someone who lives in Panamá I can attest that the drought situation is becoming worse. Besides climate change, it is primarily bad cattle farming practices that cut down all trees around natural water springs that eventually dry up or produce significant less without the local ecosystem. Also, the canal uses an unfathomable amount of fresh water. So not good!
Who in the heck thought utilizing freshwater was a good idea for this? There's ocean water on both sides... change the pipes peeps!
Ya know I started watching this but after 7 minutes of crap I know and did not want repeated to me.. I left.. Get to the freaking point.
England. I find 99% of US documentaries absolute ****. I give full marks to this one, I'll even Sub and have a look around the channel. Well done team, excellent job. Please come and show the BBC how it's done. Unfortunately, I'm not joking these days. I learned a lot, and that's what it's all about.
I don't get the statement made that lighter ships use less water.   Ship tonnage just displaces more water in the lock so ultimately there is less water in the lock with heavier/bigger ships.  The space is taken by the hulls draft and displacement.  Seems to me that larger ships use LESS water to raise the lock a specific depth.
where do these illiterate people to narrate?
good example about how consumerism chokes itself to death
21:05 Is China lending money for this and other foreign infrastructures with the hope of taking over when the debt and interest aren't repayed?
That's stupid. Why not pump it back to the second level instead of dumping it into the ocean..................Simple Solution............Z
OMG...... NO WATER....NO WATER....   BULL $HIT.... Like he said they have had and will aways have wet and dry seasons some good some bad....... THAT IS NOT THE PROBLEM OR TROUBLE..... SO DON'T LIE.....    1# Ship builders got GREEDY......  BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THEN EVEN BIGGER so BIG they would not fit into the locks...... You built them you go around..... BUT The PANANA GOVERNMENT GOT GREEDY...... WANTED THAT MONEY.....       So they built a second set of locks that were even bigger so now you have to sets of locks taking water out of the lakes and you just flush that water into the sea...... You were told by 1,000 of people that the lakes could not handle it you got sued in courts for years and the corrupt courts and government people lied and said no problem it would be fine......     LMFAO...... NOW THE TRUTH SHOWS UP....... EASY FIX...... SHUT THE OLD LOCK DOWN AND JUST USE THE NEW LOCKS........   WATER WILL GO BACK VERY VERY FAST........ REFIT THE OLD LOCKS TO PUMP ALL LAKE WATER BACK INTO THE LAKE....... EASY FIX.... WHEN ALL IS DONE...... A CHILD CAN FIX THIS..... anyone with a brain can fix this..... but how are we to take your money if we don't lie.....
IMHO Xi and the CCP of China would love to control this.
Tere is a bioceanc corridor currently working without Paraguay. It runs from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Santiago de Chile. works 95% of the time, only slowing down and closing 5 to 20 days a year for climate issues and maintenance. Far cheaper and far less distance in trucks.
Fortunately, there are parallel routes still available between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
the bi oceanic corridor really needs to be done with trains
ummm.  why don't we just build things locally?  rather than sending it all across the world?
The simplest solution seems to be to dredge a channel through the lake that is >26m deep, which would not require any locks or dams.  Unfortunately, keeping fresh water and salt water from mixing would be difficult, if not impossible.   And the current of fresh water would probably not be strong enough to force the salt water back.  Aquatic life and the human population would be affected, but it seems like there should be a way to make it work.
as a former Zonian- its pronounced Gah-TOON.  Gatun Dam 07:38    You can also practice with this sad sentence: "My old house is under the holding tanks of the new locks at Gatun. "  HAHAHA
Hello....WE GAVE IT AWAY...now the idiots could not maintain it!!!! NO ONE SAW THIS COMING???????
Free palestine 🇵🇸
Is there a history of El Nino effects elsewhere that might show if this is a recent series or it started before heavy industrialization? Was it man-made or a natural cycle with El Nina?
What about the increase of size from panama's reconstruction of the canal in the early 2000's did that add to the daily use of water???
Water isn't pumped into the lock. It is allowed into the lock through a valve from the higher level source.
Too sensationalist and you beat around the point to pad out time far too much. Won't be watching videos from this channel anymore
Am I stupid or does it make zero sense to require lighter loads to "reduce water displacement" in the canal? The way my reasoning works, the more water displaced, the less remaining volume in the canal that needs to be filled with water.  On the reverse side, if you imagine sending a rubber ducky through you have to move the entire canals volume of water with zero displacement, and you use it all for comparatively little cargo.
Elon Musk has said desalinization is very cheap. If this problem goes critical he will make a new company to solve it in a week.
Climate change will open up another routee for trade to pass through. The arctic will soon be ice free most of the year as the planet warms. The Northwest Passage will soon become a major trade route. The travel time from Shanghai to New York would be reduced by 7 days compared to travel through the Panama Canal.
If you could change the shape of the locks (length) by having more gates, or a moveable gate, you could save a lot of water. Or you can make a lift which mechanically raises the ship and water. Scotland has one canal lift.
Even if the Panama Canal has problems. I don't see how unloading ships, loading trains or trucks, unloading the trains and load them to another ship would be an effective solution.
Would it not be cheaper for a coalition to form, and use a military option to neutralize this problem? Everyone involved sends some naval assets,  spreading the cost of operation so as to have minimal cost to each. This naval force could then be used exclusively to remove houthi naval assets. Combined with Air strikes already being used. The Houthi wouldn't last long, if they even risked operations at all. This would be perfect time for Yemen to put pressure on them on land. Iran can be told they will be blockaded if they continue to fund these terrorist acts. If they want to prevent lawful trade in the world, then their own trade should be the consequences for their actions.   In Panama couldt the 1st lock be fitted with a dry dock set up, holding the ship as the ocean water is returned to the ocean. The fresh water is then used to fill the 1st lock , and reverse procedure exiting the canal. This way there is no large loss of fresh water. Building a drydock on each side of the canal should be affordable, as its ship count increase, alone would make it viable. Not to mention help with freshwater use in the area.
Thanks!
After months of warning about the weather phenomenon of the El Nino where there is a warming in the equatorial zone that has potential to bring heavy rain to the middle latitude zone in the central area of the world but now all of a sudden there's a drought in Panama
Okay buddy. It's all global warming...
My family on my Mother’s side helped build the Gatun Lock, your #3 on the North side of the Canal. Although President Roosevelt is recorded as riding on the 1ST boat through the Panama Canal, another boat went through the day prior as a test. My Grandfather and the family were on this boat. I still have my Uncle’s  Gold Crew Medal awarded all workers.   Just quick looking at a map, Panama has Lake Bayano in a sparsely populated area east of the Canal. It feeds into the Rio Bayano. Why can’t Panama dam up the Rio Bayano, create water pressure via gradually constricting pipes, and feed this water into Lake Alaguela which is already connected to the Panama Canal?  An alternative would be to pipe Lake Bayano water directly to Panama City so the choice of people or Canal could be avoided.
Is there a reason not to build a new small reservoir and pump the water into/out of it instead of the ocean allowing some recycling and conservation?
Correction: most ships will use the Magellian channel and not Drake’s passage. It doesn’t makes much difference in distance but less hazardous.
I love the thought immediately goes to trucks. What is wrong with people? We could easily make trains to carry tons of cargo easily through land. And it would make a lot more sense... smh
They could pump the water back. Panama took a risk and it unfortunately has not paid off. It really is unfortunate. Because running something at less cost would be great for the economy. Hopefully, they will invest in the canal since this will reduce pollution from ships traveling farther in the ocean.
Was your sound engineer on a tea break when you recorded this voiceover?
"until the start of the new millennium on January 1, 2000" oof, it's 2024 and we're still getting this wrong?
lithium  batteries are already on their way out.  Silicon batteries are the new thing, and other techs are on the horizon
Mad to think Nicaragua is only 10 places behind the United States for most corrupt.
Isn't it easier to install pumps that will return the water in the lake, instead of pouring it in the ocean?
Climate Alarmist Communism BS!  UNSUBSCRIBED!
“You gonna go around the horn like a man? Or go through the canal like some kind of democrat? YOU GO AROUND THE HORN!”- Butterscotch Horseman
Well, then USA needs to stay focus on its own region. It can begin by FREEING HAWAII!
Every conservative who has a stake in trading should be watching this video.  Climate change, a myth or not.  That shit dries up, expect cost on everything to go up.  It means more gas used, longer transit times.  It will affect the whole Western economy.
So the road will be destroyed in around 10 years 21:27
Wow, that's crazy about the Houthis. I wonder why they would do that? Like, what specific event or events are unfolding that would motivate them to do this thing they are now doing, which they weren't really doing previously.
What the flying fluff am I missing here? Essentially they've been getting a free lunch from their lakes. Who in their right mind throws away fresh water?  I think they're just saying that they don't want to pay for pumping the water themselves. They could easily make a holding tank for sea water that they continuously pump into for use in equalizing the locks. Oh but that would cost money and therefore cut into the transit fees! But one thing it would not do was destroy their ecosystem and be subject to climate change.  Okay you want me to do this for you? When you equalize the water in those locks, that's called potential energy. You can in fact get most of it back out by running that water through a turbine on its way to the next lower place. If you're really really smart, you could have those turbines directly pumping water back into your holding tank.  Obviously  this will not reclaim all of the energy. For the rest, I believe Holland had a solution for pumping water...?
What a real wasteful process. You think we would’ve came up with a better solution.
Oh god, what is wrong with the audio?
Why don’t they build some multiple train lines across the area. Bring your boat to the eastern shore of the Atlantic, take a train to the Pacific side, then board another ship.
The problem is, we, the United States, gave control of the canal zone to Panama.
I was impressed with how much garbage lines the waters around Panama City.
Stop w the climate change crap. Droughts happen. Period. A 60 year historical record isn’t that long.   Ruins your channel.
Why don't we have ships permanently based out of the West Coast to cover stuff that happens on that end?
Changed Mics? Using deep-frying oil as a recording device?
Just dig the canal deeper lol
Eventually end? 😅After the 'eventual' loss of how many lives?
You should talk a little faster
Answer: Develop a pump system that can use SALT water. That and accept the fact that the Upper Lake will get salty.  I didn't say it was a great answer.
why don't they just pump ocean water
You cant just pump water back up the locks because it will introduce salt to the fresh water. They need desalinization plants to create a closed loop
Realistically all these would simply increase trade and I don't think it would end use of the canal
This doesn't ruin the canal.  It just makes it more expensive to run.  Just pump the water from the first lock into a holding tank to fill lock 3 later.  1 extra step.
We could also stop exploiting labor in 3rd world countries
Love learning about places that are far away from me.
I went through the Panama Canal in 1993 on USS Whidbey Island LSD 41 in support of UNITAS 34-93...
What if you pump the water from 1 back into 2 instead of dumping it into the ocean? Then pump the water back into 3 when done?
Unusual winter  at 38.4 North  in Spain  , some high temps ,sometimes minus 3 at night ,hardly any rain due  to Climate  change
Can you imagine  what would  happen if Alaska was joined to  East Russia  with an undersea Tunnel !
''green energies'' hhahahahahahahahahahahaha
sooo a desalination plant and a big pump is all that's needed to fix this..... really this is just dumb.....
Doesn't mention that the Houthis are only attacking sips going to or owned by Israel and will stop if the genocide stops. You are highly selective in your info and highly suspect in your framing.  i hope you improve.
US oughtta build a coast-to-coast mega high-speed rail system and then FUCK the Panama Canal. Prolly only cost a few trill
Never underestimate China’s ability to F things up. When they expanded the canal they didn’t understand how it works. But you can operate bigger ships now.
ukraine is the most corruptive country in the world....4billion wouldn't even be big enough for a tip for the Ukraine gov,t
you would think that the sea levels rising would require less and less water for the panama canal lol or that some new technology like a water pump would be able to recycle the water used in each sluse in the canal -.-
Why can’t they just back-pump the system and recycle the water used to raise and lower the levels in the lock?
It's kinda sus that every project that could rival the Panama Canal, even though some of them were better got either destroyed or never took off because of some environmental issues when we all know the Panama canal is an environmental disaster.
Don´t worry about Panama Canal. Russia might soon open Putin´s strait between Canada and Mexico.
Please learn how to say "Paraguay"
Here's an idea, but it might be expensive: dig a new canal along the US Mexico border. Added benefit would be that it could control immigration.
And we wonder why we have migrant crises. 💀
Should build some RO machines to desalinize the ocean waters from both oceans. Pump this water into reservoirs to help feed fresh water supply into the canal. Or pump it directly into the lakes.
( SOUND: TRAIN HORN)   Other wise , Here is an opportunity for the US to step up and offer another Alternative.  Over land Rail with supporting PORTS on West and East Coast side to facilitate modular transfer from Pacific to Caribbean or Atlantic.  Yes this will present the time that it takes to unload on one side then reload another ship on the other side, but it beats waiting those 18 days .
If they ( initial US Engineers and earth movers ) were able to dig deep enough to make the canal, why couldn't they have simply continued to go deeper and avoid the locks altogether ???  That would have been the best solution , it seems.
But what about the North-West passage?
Interesting...."the problem is more natural and geographic in nature"....lol😅😂 of course it's not because of anglosaxon capitalist GREED & ARROGANCE when "they" disturb the original environment continuously.....
Surely it’s an easy shout to just flood the locks with salt water , pump it in
18:26 As a brazillian, not only geography, but corruption and bad governments aswell, hopefully that changes, but power hungry politicians never want to lose their power.
cant water from the ocean be used instead of waiting for it to rain?
Corruption-list is made by corrupt people, so can not be taken seriously. West has easily the most corrupt leaders.
why can't ocean water be used to operate the lochs?
It's down to entitled people no longer wanting or knowing how to maintain things. Just buy a new canal.
Just dig the whole canal to see level. No gates needed, problem solved.
AI generated narrator lol
How about another solution? Maybe pump the water back to the lake instead of dumping it to the ocean?
Sell it back to the USA and we will fix it. Its a fraction of our budget.  An we will probably expand the locks to accommodate future ship sizes.
I wouldn’t count on war in the Middle East ending lol
Literally like has anyone heard of this thing called a recirculating water pump 😂 Pump the water back up to the second lock then there’s virtually no water loss. Certainly easier then trying to add more water storage 😂
Something i don't understand is why wont they use sea water to fill up the gates?
Why flush fresh water to ocean when you can put it back to the cycle?
Build a railway system parallel to the canal with some of the profits they are making.
the issues in Yemen are only with US, UK and israeli ships, not to the global majority
This is such an easily solvable issue that of course isn't done because someone would lose some money... That group of people who would lose money would still continue to be insanely rich even after completely fixing the issue, they just don't want to... Thanks capitalism...
It’s interesting they talk about a highway network to connect South America.  I’d suggest one in North America, but we already have several.  There are 3 major highways that span the length of the continent in the USA alone, I-70, I-80, and I-90.  Canada also has one, but it kind of sucks.  The three in the USA are pretty dang efficient, having at least 2 lanes in both directions at all times.
Panama isn't "a country heavily reliant on the canal"; it is a country created wholesale by the US for the purpose of owning the Canal. It's one of the OG "Banana Republic".
it seems to me that the continents are placed in the most inconvenient way possible for human interaction
Start using seawater.!
Why won’t the pump hundreds of underwater balloons in every shaft? Other canal Guatemala livingston
What about another idea at the Panama Canal? Instead of releasing the fresh water into the sea, diverting it into a basin or artificial sea at the low level and then using solar panels and electric pumps to pump it back up into lake Gatún?
They dhould pump the fredg water back into the lake instead of the ocean... seems obvious.
I’m annoyed that the narrators assumption is that the listeners have no clue what the Panama Canal is or that it was man-made, and begins the video with an unnecessarily long explanation of fundamentals. The demo for this video are not people who don’t know what the Panama Canal is.
Climate change smh, such bs
Such a great informative video, thanks!
Fortunately, the most recent forecasts indicate a very high chance that El nino will break down this year, and an even chance that a la Nina will occur. So we're safe this year. But it's still a problem that needs to be solved
They really should use trains instead of trucks
Can't they just update and engineer pumps which can use saltwater aswell?
No, just no, water are not pumped, it only use gravity, compared to a detour of 8000 NM, it would be way cheaper to pump the water up, instead of letting it drain out,  But never mind, you mentioned global climate change, every year the most trusted climate scientists publishe a report on the climate, in January of 2023 they predicted that within 10 years ocean level will raise 1 meter, within 20 years ocean level will raise 10 meters, and within 30 years we will have the rest, there's some uncertainty of how much that is, but probably no less than 60 meters, that was 2023, it's still valid, only one year less, in a near future, it will no longer be a canal, but a strait, Every year we are closer to seeing the Strait of Panama.
begin 2canals just South of Panama border,cement seawater"great circle"&fresh water overpasses, hence,rail,traffic&aquaduct,to finally connect S,Central&N.Americas en free trade. an economic bomb,for sure,tho good for long term benefit. hell ,by completion,there should be automated,ships, trains,trucks,loading&unloading. imagine getting an item,from Chile,you ordered 3days prior, boggles the mind. g5,Q&theoldmaninthecave
Less water displaced by the ships would require *more* water to be pumped into the lock, wouldn't it?
Because of course the US military,  cleverly named "Department of Defense " though we attack the world if you dare challenge capitalism
why not build freight trains for the bi oceanic corridor?
Oh, poor companies.  How about treat workers fairly, better yet, allow us our fair share of the work WE produce
i can still make it work by pumping sea water to the top. the locals wouldn't like it tho
A decrease in the United States' addiction to conspicuous consumption would certainly help.
Please, whatever you do, do NOT use trucks
a small logistical gaff over a century ago. start  redesign to exclusively use sea water while  beginning construction,in a different country,of another canal,period. when completed the  seawater would be a circular path via the  resultant 2canals. g5
Whoever thought it would be a good idea to dump the fresh water in the ocean failed! Reuse it wtf it’s not that hard?
It hurts a little that the best way to get a cargo container from the west coast, to the UK, is to go through the canal, instead of rail shipping it to the east coast.  What if the US rail system was so good that companies bid for the right to unload in california, and pick up in new york, using two lines of ships.  What if the rail trip across the USA was only a single day.  Only takes trains that can handle going 160 MPH to do it.  Not even world record speed for a train.
The rail options don't move US warships from one ocean to the other.
The canal's lake loses water to the ocean? Why not just pump the water into a giant man made "holding pond" and recirculate it instead of losing it to the ocean? This way the lake content won't be depleted.
Get people and machines digging right next to the canal in Panama to even out the level from one side to the other.
Dig a big ass new canal without researching  earlier engineering and not accounting for it and call it climate change and than base rain on Panamas entite history of rain going to the 1950s?
They need to build a pipeline and pumps to use sea water to fill the locks.  Then they can keep their freshwater and their income from the canal.  With all the money they're making from ships wanting to skip the line, they have the money for it!
Why not make a chanel in sea level
I think that for each ship passing through the Panama canal, they need to use 300,000 m³ of water from the reservoir. They need to install some giant turbines to pump sea water into the reservoir.  Seen the elevation (>30 metres) and the flux of water required (500.000 m³ / h), they need a local power plant to generate the necessary electricity to pump such amounts of water. This is a truly expensive solution, but it would allow the Panama canal to operate 24/7 independently from the weather...
Why are all the routes originating in the SE United States? Why not truck across the US and ship from California to Asia?
US Navy ships aren't going to be displaced by train or truck alternatives. The Panama Canal will still be vital to US interests.
27:05  THIS IS IMPORTANT.  CHINA takes over for 50 years.  Every country that makes business with the CCP IS FUCKED FOR YEARS.
The real message is that we need to stop relying on foreign countries to support our economies, and must right-size to be able to fend off the issues likely to be brought up in the future such as changing weather patterns, political instability, etc. Countries reliant on foreign trade would do well to change their economic structures to ensure they don't suddenly get cut off in the not-so-distant future
or or we open multiple trade routes so theres not monopolies and high rates
1) Why not a railway or dedicated Highway that runs a similar route to the Canal?  Then ships can pick up and drop off.  2) RECYCLE THE WATER INSTEAD OF DUMPING FRESH WATER INTO THE OCEAN!!!  PUMP IT BACK TO STAGE 1!!!!
Can someone explain why do they use fresh water instead of sea water?
This does not seem like an unsolvable problem: desalination is easily possible and only not used everywhere because it's expansive. In the case of the Panama canal however, money is not really the issue. So just build a few desalination plants and everything is good to go
Pump the required water from lock 1 back to lock 2 before opening to ocean. No?
I know that it would be expensive, but the best way to prevent drought from having a significant impact on the canal would be to pump water from the ocean into the first and second canals and utilize the lake for the third lock that would drastically reduce the water needed for the lockswhile increasing the lifespan of the canal itself, however this plan would require extreme amounts of power to function due to the amount of water that would have to be pumped from the ocean up into the locks
Ya ya ya ya of course its the "climate change" that is the big problem for the Panama canal, always the "climate change". I get so fu--ink tied of this "climate taliban's". Are you shore that its not Trumps fault, or the white middle ages men or any other of the brain ghosts you crazy lefties have?
Oh no the bully won't be able to send it's war ships fast enough...  Good.
Recycle the water used to raise and lower the ship.  Build giant cisterns at each lock where the water is pumped into and out of each time.  This will greatly reduce the amount of water taken out of Lake Gatun.  The main loss would be from evaporation.  You could cut down the water needed from the lake by 80-90%, if not more.
Your microphone input is about to clip. Too mouch volume.
Yet another climate change reasoning. I am sure the opening of the larger hence more water used locks has nothing to do with lack of water
I love how every drought is the fault of climate change now lol drought has been an issue all around the world for thousands of years.
The most laughable problem between two oceans. Theres not enough water ....
Technically Suriname lacks road connections to all neighbors since you need to take a river ferry to cross into Guyana or French Guiana.
When the sea level goes up 100 ft due to climate change, the Panama Canal will be far less important.   The problem will be salt water intrusion.
A cruxial choke point, 5% of all world trade, makes a whopping 4.3 billion US dollar per year... Indeed. But that is only about 5% if the wealth of people like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk. That is how crazy the world has become...
"The government really have no choice other than to ration water supplies for the canal or ration water supplies for its people, and so far the government has been choosing to ration the water supplies for the..."  Me : "People, of course its people"  "...canal"  Me : "God dammit"
If they are using pumps to move the water, why not just pump the fresh water back uphill and into the lake again? Would require new pipes to be installed, but I feel like this would relatively negative the fresh water loss from the canal…. Am I missing something here?
Climate change another eco weirdo
lol why not pump the water back to the lakes instead of the sea
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
4:32 some of these countries actually belong to North America
Once you play the “Climate Change” card, I stop watching.
For me, Tehuantepec has to be the front runner. Whichever one happens, it probably won't be in my lifetime.
Fair chance more water is being diverted to other uses, combined with an unusually dry season. Climate Change is a political strategy based on corrupt unscientific lies.
Israel is a big part of the red sea shipping problems. Why are you not talking about this?
Such a waste of water. There has to be a more efficient use of water. Like using the salt water instead
Desalination!
"...effects of climate change have been worsening around the world." What a giant load of bull crap.  You just reminded me why I unsubscribed. Were you bought off to vainly repeat the climate change mantra, or are you a true believer?
Mile wide channel on USA border from Pacific to golf of Mexico would eliminate dead zone in gulf, provide shipping lanes, places for mega rich to build boat docks along south side for their super yachts , they will build fences and provide upkeep, and any scaling walls will be hired for lawn and building maintenance. Thus solvingthe border crisis. They being the rich of course.
"the lowest level ever recorded in Panama's history. since record-keeping began in the 1950s" So in other words, it's not really that remarkable. Geologic timescales for events are pretty big, 100 years is nothing for unusual events to occur.
No matter what else happens, the USA will "'need" to transit its warships (and cargo ships) as quickly as possible via this "choke point". Hence, a much WIDER "sea level"  canal WILL be built (eventually).  After all, 26 metres is only the height of an 8 story building ! Digging out the rock etc. for a Sea-Level canal WILL cost a great deal of money. However, the construction ability for this is much more "available" today than it was, over 100 years ago !  However, diverting ships around South America also costs a great deal of money - AND TIME.  A new "Sea Level" "Panama" Canal WILL be built - eventually.
What if the water pumped from the locks went back to the freshwater lake?
If they can pump the fresh water into the canal? Then why can't they pump the excess water back into the reserve? If it has salt in it, then treat it beforehand.   Panama is making a ton of bribes. Handle it. They wanted it. Fix it.   The war in the middle east will never end.  Also? The U.S. needs to be making a secondary canal anyway. Don't you think that "if" China did make a military move? That this wouldn't become a military target quickly?
Any reason Panama doesn't just make a land based system across the country to use in addition to the canal?
Shows pictures of normal low tide the dramatize the "drought" 🤦‍♂️
Australia is experiencing the wettest period in history
If panama can think of ways maybe they should give it back to u.s.a cause u.s.a has alll technologies and men and women that are capable finding ways😎
This problem is so easy for this generation!why?all modern technologies and genius are here!remember this canal was made limited technologies!adding this planet earth vast about 95 percent water..the problem is how to convert it grom seawater to lake water?
the houthis began the raids because of the Isreali genocide. if that ends the houthis wont attcak the routes that they previously did not attack
something is up with your audio in this video, kinda rough irritiating voice
Panama needs to join BRICS and gain funding to dig a new canal that sits at sea level. This would take about 10 years at most, but it would guarantee the economic benefit. By the time the new canal is finished, the US will no longer be using the canal to threaten the rest of the world.  Panama provides a great service but.. if they do not act, someone else will dig a canal like they did in the middle east.
He gives us history lessons about the canal and other non-important factoids. Just get to the point and tell us what's wrong with the canal right away. I never got to the place in this very lengthy video to find out what the problem is he claims is causing it to die (supposedly). I'm out at 2:15 in!! Holy smokes, shorten this video!!
At 2:32 THERE IS an incorrect statement The "New Millennium" did NOT start on January 1, 2000.  It started on January 1, 2001,  BECAUSE there was no Year "Zero".
You can’t beat rail. Digging canals to float ships across just isn’t as efficient or economically and environmentally viable as building a decent railway line.  The faster the rail links, the more it can eat into the canal’s traffic. If they build the railways with 4 or more lines, then it can obliterate the canal.
Throughout history, there have been periods where certain years experience more rainfall than others. But, you take the simple minded approach and blame it on climate change.
This audio fucked yo
Very interesting. And LOL China man tries to use corrupt country to do something. I am sure that would have went well.
I lasted for :47 because it not only talks much too fast, the narrator takes the POV of view of the genocidal's  propaganda. 👎
Miss the hypothetical space videos
Why don’t they just use salt water for the Panama Canal?
Deering, Warrald.  Lol.
The Biden Administration gave Iran nearly 20 BILLION dollars to fund Hamas and the Houthis. But hey no mean tweets.
Lowest rainfall in Panama's recorded history....since the 1950s.  Lol
That’s where they have all the alligator-giraffes 😮
Please inform your viewers why the Houthis are doing what they are doing. If not to educate your patrons, then maybe for the sake of fair, balanced complet, comprehensive and ethical journalism. Thanks
Thanks for not mentioning why the houthis are disrupting trade.  Zionist.
No where do they mention the Norther route through the increasingly reduced-ice Arctic Ocean.  Use a globe to see the short direct route from China to the ports of Norther Europe...
11:50 the government chose to give to the people that's the most shocking thing i've heard this year
Miss leading
Not to mention the Cape has unbelievable weather - Aircraft Carriers have been damaged making that trip
This is all very good. But none of these routes solves transporting US naval ships from Pacific to Atlantic, vice versa. What would the US do to combat transporting warships from one side to the other? Travel by means of the Northwest Passage?
Big problem with the to canals problems one because of war and the other one by natural cause. We can used the see roads known as Vasco da Gama and Fernão  de Magalhães
Maybe Panama will return to his original country Colombia
Men fighting against Nature? Nature can be hurt but will always need
All those people that are crossing the south frontiers maybe can be used to build railways to croos the USA coast to coast? Are they  so strong has slaves were, for shore not but good for the work that machines can not do?,?
I was surprised by it only taking 18 days to go around South America. I had alway thought it would take about a month.
Why don't they just pump the water back upstream of the locks?
What if  a pump system is made to pump the water back in to the reservoirs instead of the ocean and then dig another reservoir for fresh drinking water is made for the panamanians kill two birds with one stone I bet shipping companies and nations knowing the importance of the canal would get behind it
Climate change 😂
Unfortunately, you can't easily re 21:45 grow the Amazon Forrest and with such huge amounts being logged or destroied will mean the issue will need generation's to re over and by that time the Amazon will be nothing but a small park
That lake is pronounced Gah Tune not Gah ton
Navy doesn't use it anymore
The money towards the Road Building in  Paraguay/Bolivia/Columbia/Chile/ Argentina/  Peru is from China....  It's plain to see what the future  outcome will  be in 10 = 15 yrs.
There is so much misinformation about "climate change" here. No, draughts are not getting worse worldwide. The stats clearly show no change. And Panama only has records starting from 1950. That is way too short to make any conclusions.
Why don't they just capture the water instead of flushing it out to sea. Or even pump seawater up to brine ponds
another great video
LOLOLOLOLOLOL.  Okay troll.
Couldn't a desalination plant be built that could bring fresh water into the artificial lake for the canal and to bring drinking water to the people?
Sounds like you just need to re-construct it to pull water from the ocean
For some reason, you're mentioning the Iran backed part, which is irrelevant,  but you fail to mention the reason for the Houthies attacks?? genocide against Palestinians is ok, but preventing ships from going to Israel inorder to stop the genocide is a good enough reason for bombing another country?? If you fail to mention the cause for the attacks because this is a logistics channel, then you should not be suggesting that the attacks are linked to Iran, misleading people to thinking that the attacks are connected to Iran's conflict with the US, I really used to love this channel, but what is going on right now is really revealing the truth about the world we're living in... You have just lost a long time subscriber.
Crazy how often we so casually speak of war with China these days
The Isthmus of Tehuantepec crossing is being considerably improved;  not only does it provide a way to transfer goods between the Pacific and Caribbean, it connects with the North American railway network, and multiple large industrial parks are under construction.  It will make a good alternative to Panama for many sorts of traffic.
This episode should have called South America's shipping nightmares. Why is it that it's always a South American country that is staring at making a literal ton of money from a white powder? in this case Lithium Carbonate. But it's still...  A   white   powder. Wow.
I doubled my investement in north america railroad in november. Considering price of maritime freigth is cheaper the land transport, usualy the cheapest way to move cargo is to get it to closest port, even if that mean going east for a good heading to china, but with longer searoute, amd with less ineficient freigth going around africa and south america at the same time, all that extra travel time mean each boat amd container can move less cargo per year, so it could cause a capacity crisis and price spike, wich mean longer land transport could now become more efficient if it cut a reasonable amount of sea transport.
I am far from anyone knowledgeable on the subject or logistics behind it but couldn't they build a feeder lake that the water is pumped into rather than out to sea and reuse that?
The only problem the canal has is greed!!!
Make a video on how rich is Elon Musk
Many engineers had predicted that the Panamanian government would ruin the canal with poor management.  That prediction has come true.
Wouldn't it be cheaper to find a way to desalinate the water that enters the locks, especially at the third Lock?  That seems cheaper than damming/building another lake.
Couldn't they also build a road and railway in Panama?
Allegedly Iran... stop saying stuff you cannot prove categorically please
Awe that’s no good :(
Why doesn't Panama pump water up from the ocean to the first two tiers of locks? That would cut fresh water usage by 2/3.
Why not pump water from the ocean
Just cycle the lake water from the locks back into the lake… smfh
Well done.
What happened to China's plan to build a canal through Nicaragua?
How long does a US Navy ship have to wait to get through ?
what happened to microphone?
My questions will reveal how little I know.  He mentioned pumping the freshwater in, so why can't they pump in the saltwater from the ocean instead?  Why can't they just dig the canal deeper so they don't have to raise the ships up?  I think it will be best to have all the options working simultaneously, especially for the future of a global trade market.
Now they will use  water from the sea in orther to avoid to expend the rain water they solve the problem.
Nuke em
USA and Canada could simply use the trusty old railroad to carry goods from one ocean to the other. Railroad transport has been declining for decades but it’s still faster than ships going around cape horne.  They could just pump water between locks or in reservoirs instead of dumping it in the ocean. This is utterly stupid.
You mean the huthi terrorists?
The guy talking is making me hyper ventilate! Does he not breathe?  I need to log off it’s giving me breathing problems and making me anxious! Lol 😂
yerz
Just add one more pump system. On the bottom level, instead of letting the water out into the ocean, pump that back up to the lake. So you are essentially using the same water over and over again.
This is why I don't subscribe or pay attention to this channel all that much. You make issues seem bigger than they really are and your analysis is usually bad too. The year is 2025 not 1900. Yes, you can create a loch to reuse the water or save the water or whatever you need to do. We put a man on the moon. Lochs and water management is a joke. I'm sure the panama canal will be just fine. Trust me. I loved your comment about bribes being used to skip the line. That's not a bribe. That's a fast pass. Same thing a Disney Land I guess everyone is bribing everyone to get the fast pass. You also have to say something about a potential war with China and Taiwan. Please...
Good content poor audio
The sad part is, people would have been mad at the USA for keeping control of the canal. We gave away control to Panama, and 20 years later it's a disaster. We should have just kept it.
Severe droughts come and go. And the climate change is bunk. It is not getting worse. And there is more demand for water from the people. Pump water up though the locks, instead of down through the locks. Problem solved.
Jimmy Carter you are still an ass's ass.
I'm not familiar with logistic does anyone knows why sea water can't be used to function the lock in this case?
The other other Crisis is the music in this video 👎👎👎👎👎💩💩💩😬
You forgot the northern Canadian sea route. How did you even miss that @RealLifeLore
Why are those beats in the background? Kinda inappropriate
Once again, our previous designs built during times of plenty will have to be replaced by systems that recycle.  Since the canal has massive national security implications for the US, it sounds like the US and Panama should bond together and build a water-recycling pump system to replace the fresh water-ejection-into-the-sea system Teddy Roosevelt's engineers built. All those idiots that say we will "adapt" to Global Warming, "no need to worry", no need to mitigate it, will need to start embracing just how expensive that is going to be.
Am I missing something ? Short on water with 2 freaking oceans on either side ??
You had me in the first half, ngl. I thought you were gonna go on about a flat earth with an ice wall and I was like "ahh great, not another one of these guys"😂
Yeah, the shipping company I'm using for the move to Japan has warned me that it now could be up to 6 months from when they pick my stuff up at the end of the month in Virginia.  One correction though, is that most of the ships which use the Canal now, use the more modern locks series on either side, given the original set of locks were never built with modern super cargo ships in mind. So while the older sets are still there, Germany and the US Army Corps of Engineers built new sets on either end back in the 2000s (Germany on the Pacific side, US on the Atlantic).
What happened to the audio this video? Faster talking, rougher audio quality, and it sound like the audio gain is boosted too high. Makes an otherwise good video difficult/annoying to watch.
Most canal water usage is trivial to mitigate.  Anything that doesn't directly connect to the ocean can be pumped in and out of storage tanks at will.  The Panama Canal made a decision to keep these flows gravity-operated, which saves them a few ten millions in energy expenses, but those are looking like paltry savings if it impacts the main revenue stream.
Actually by using electric pumps, you could greatly reduce the amount of water being lost. You exchange water for electricity but electricity could come from either solar power or wind energy and both do not depend on rainfall.
so, lets address some pachyderms in the room; PRC, if (hopefully not WHEN) they began an attack on Taiwan you can be SURE that more than USA bases in that region would be attacked, the Panama Canal would be hit as well! That's a given!, Columbia, that's a current non-started as the government there can't control the drug gangs. Nicaragua? That needs complete flushing of it's corrupt government. Mexico and the Gulf of,,seems the best bet.
Solution from some Random guy on the internet. Panema invests in Nuclear Reactor, country now has lots of Energy. Next, country invests in a desalination plant that would pump fresh water from the ocean into lake using the energy from the reactor. BOOM Vote for me as problem solver. Explain why this wouldn't work
My foot hurts. It's climate change.
There's already a railway crossing Panama, parallel to the canal.
I really don’t understand why they won’t just add some pumps and reservoirs to conserve the water in the locks instead of draining it to the ocean. This isn’t new tech here. And paying for a few power plants to supply the extra energy needed is vastly cheaper than losing your entire market share to something else, or not being able to operate at all.
The alternatives will never happen. When was the last time any Latin American country was able to actually complete a project like this? They are too busy stealing from the people.
I don't know much about this but my understanding is that the route(s) south of one or both the continents is some really rough ocean as well, another reason ships prefer to use the canals if possible
Just build a ocean water pipeline .
Obviously it would require a lot of electricity but why not install pumps to pump the fresh water back up the locks so they don’t waste the fresh water? How much electricity would be required?
So why not just have an 85 food deep channel? Seems like even having a deep channel would be less work than flooding a plain for a lake and the whole Lock system. Drain the water out and just dig. Then all you have to do is make strong barricades as walls, or dig out the topography so it’s not 85 feet. Then it’s just a canal not a Lock. If water supply is a concern, then they could make all the water dedicated to drinking water
If you have enough electricity you just pump the water back up to a higher elevation, and don't need to flush it out into the ocean. This does cost a bit of money (reservoirs, pumps, power generation) but it's not exactly rocket science.
Why not make a series of pumps that pumps the fresh water back into the lake so there is "Minimal Fresh Water" loss?  I know that costs energy, but that's far better than losing access to the Fresh Water by dumping it into the oceans.
China is already making a land bridge across south America. It will be ok
Let nobody talk about why the Houthi - or any other terrorists - do the shit they do. ~eye roll~
Imagine running out of water while being surrounded by water 🤒
I am not a rocket surgeon, but why don't they pump the water from the lowest canals back into the lake. Rather than releasing the water into the ocean, pump it back into the lake or recycle it in the locks.b
Dude fix your audio. Your voice is clipping and distorting and it makes it impossible to listen to
I never connected the idea that raising those water gates would have a fresh water cost. Crazy that theyre just dumping drinking water by the millions of gallons for every single ship that goes through.
I don't care just fix the problem
I assume pumping water from the outer locks back into the higher ones is just too slow to be viable (in addition to the cost of the power required to do that, of course).
btw the Mexican corridor is already operational.
Woke video. No such thing as "climate change" disaster.
This has nothing to do with climate change and everything to do with poor planning and management.  The locks were recently enlarged thus utilizing more water. In addition, the number of ships transiting has greatly increased. Larger locks, more ships, more water is used.  Also, instead of recycling the water by pumping it into a holding reservoir, they chose to just dump it into the ocean as a cost cutting measure.👈 Thus poor planning and management.  But rather then admit the poor planning and management, it's much easier to blame climate change.
The saddest part is knowing that even if this greatly contributed to inflation, if ALL of these alternatives were operational, you know they're not gonna lower prices once they start saving that money again :)
Sounded more like global warming pushalong...    I dont think theres an explaination as to why the ships have to be lifted  26 meters and then lowered 26 meters. Was that because of the lake??? Im sure there would be another way to go about this...  Built one hundred plus years ago, isnt it time for a rethink...    The global reseters are busy creating problems not fixing them. And their fixups are in fact, actually the other type of F,ups.    I mean, electric cars are an irretrevable fail for anyone cares to look outside the great reset fantasy land. Dont be scared, reality is coming to a town like yours !!!
sounds like we need the ice caps to melt
Sucks to be a living monument, can't believe its dying so soon.
Climate change is a hoax
When the Suez got blocked the entire world learned just how much we all rely on ocean shipping. As recent as that was it still seems like nobody is talking about how much of a precarious situation we’re in with the problems in Panama and Yemen.
Your graphic showed the comical sight of the BOTTOM of each lock moving up and down.
For ppl that actually know about world trade these issues that happen between suez and panama canal is huge reason why most goods you pay for is more expensive not the president but really any1 watching video like this prob knows that.
instead of dumping water to the sea, can`t you just pump back the water from the first tank back to the lake to save the fresh water?
Audio quality sounds weird on this one
Why do they drain the excess water into the ocean instead of into a side tank that can be reused? This seems insane, or are the energy costs of repumping the water back "up" into the tank prohibitive as opposed to just letting it flow down from the lake?
The U.S. hands over the canal and Panama had to screw it all up.  There needs to be a new canal up north a little more.  I’ve heard that suggestion in the past.  Not sure if it’s feasible.   Need some competition.
Maybe Panama should consider not dumping the water into the ocean without pulling some back or help supplement the canal with railways
Well there is technically a street connecting the Colombian city of Leticia with the Brazilian city of Tabatinga, yet, truth be told, getting to Leticia is often done by plane since it's on the beginning of the Amazon forest
Perhaps they could make a cascade with more in-between steps than 3. That would lower the water consumption. It would be costly, but would it cost more than redirecting water from rivers that flow rather far away? I don't think so. It is a diminishing returns approach though. Let's say it takes 52 millions gallons per ship now. By doubling the steps count (in ideal state) they would be able to reduce the consumption to 26 million gallons. But it would require further doubling to reduce it by 13 more millions. And there may also be limits given by the length of the canal. Moreover, it would require a downtime of the canal itself.
AI voice??
It’s been mentioned that the Ben gurion canal will pass through Gaza , which is now cleared of buildings
To think that over 100 years, literally no one considered pumping the water from the lower lock into a holding tank to reuse in times of drought boggles my mind. But I guess that's normal for 5% of the world.
What kind of system does the Saint Lawrence sea way locks use? Because they allowed Sea Lampreys to infest the great lakes and decimated the lake trout.
The simple fact that Panama isn't one of the richest countries in the world tells you everything you need to know about their ability and competence of governance.
It IS also possible that the water can be recycled.  Pumping millions of liters of water isn't the cheapest thing in the world but is much better than unloading, loading onto trucks. paying for drivers and gas to move across a continent, unloading from trucks, and loading back onto ships.
The amount of fuel consumed going around South America must be a lot compared to sitting and waiting for your turn.
How about large pumps to move fresh water uphill at the locks.
Why not use ocean water to pump the sections instead of their drinking water?
it's pronounced tewantepec (strong syllabe is the last)
They need to make it an electric train
Can't wait until climate change disrupts trade routes.   I honestly cannot think of another way that the powers that be will take climate change seriously
You know, if there's any solace in this, it's just that if climate change starts cutting into large corporations' profits too much, they'll prioritize funding research to reverse it. Not because they owe it to the people that support them, but because they just love the almighty dollar too much to watch it slip away from them without a fight.
Wouldn't the BI Oceanic corridor cause more trash and pollution across the southern cone of south America?
I wish that producers of many different documentaries cease hiring auctioneers as voice over actors.
i just want rail man.
The audio is so bad.
My guy, the audio sounds ass
It's not just the fact that water displacement of a ship just means how much less water needs to be filled into any given section, that was state wrongly here, but the fact that the audio also sounds strangely compressed and slightly too fast compared to older video, that make me think this is entirely AI-narrated. That in itself isn't a crime, but I dislike that on one side the quality drops and on the other someone doing a great voiceover job has possibly lost a contract. I don't consider that progress. If I am wrong and this is simply a faulty upload, I am happy to be wrong. If not, I am fairly dissappointed and will likely quit watching their videos.
its clearly because they cant math and u also cant math! light boats use more water then heavy boats!  IF u have light person in a bath it takes more water to get full. now if have a fat person in the bath u will clearly need far less water to fill the same bath! MORE MASS = less water
The lack of rail in this discussion is so sad. So much cheaper once built than highways, but nobody wants to front the costs
Stupid idea.  Dredge out the canal to below sea level, and nice and wide.  Yes, it would be spendy.  But, so are the alternatives, and once completed, the day to day costs are very low.  No locks, no rainfall issues.
Sounds like it's time to find the north west passage
Reuse the water and pump it back into the lake instead of letting it flow to the sea. Would need massive pumps, but energy can be supplied via solar/wind. Can be done without introducing salt/lifeform contamination upstream.
At just past 13:00 when they say that the ships being allowed to past through are carrying 40% less cargo to converse water, that doesn't make sense to me.  Wouldn't a heavier ship ie more displacement mean the volume of the lock is filled with more ship and less water?  If you reduce the ship weight or displacement wouldn't that use more water pre cycle?
Not to mention Cape Horn is one of the most dangerous passages that exists
America should take the canal back we built it and we should charge the fees over it
Why don't they use desalination... oh wait for it to become a crisis and get some sucker to pay for it
I have been to the canal & lake Gatun and its so beautiful
America: literally digs a canal and creates two giant lakes that sustain the entire country of Panama  Panama: can’t even fucking maintain it enough to improve with the changing times.  Just hire some Dutch engineers they’ll figure it out
paraguesis or is not part of Chinas Belt and Road . scam
It's not climate change that's to blame. From a quick study...  1. The change from reusing fouled freshwater in the locks to dumping it to the sea.  2.Since the year 2000 traffic tonnage has more than doubled.  3. The locks were widened.
SO HOW MENY FRESH WATER DESALENATION PLANTS WOULD IT TAKE???
Bro such an easy way to fix this just at first and last two stages pump out all od the water and replace salt water with lake water and put something like made our of rubber huge rubber sloping things from both sides so ship can have some place to be standig on and it’s not hard and bum u replace water
Another bad move by Jimmy Carter, America's worst president
maybe someone could get a few people on board with the idea of using a tankermount Desalenation Plant to provide some fresh water to Panama's Lake or build a Desalenation Plant on the behalf of the worlds People.  Come on you guys this so doable . and an asset for the future of Panama.
Can't they use seawater for part of the process?
Why can't the pump water from the ocean to fill the gates?
I wonder why the don't consider creating a train link through panama? If the ships only reaches a peak height of 24 meter above sea level, it shouldn't be a major problem for a train to rise over.
The canals in Great Britain were designed to conserve water, apparently the designers of the Panama Canal did not foresee a need for conservation. The cost now to recycle water is going to be more expensive. A pump storage system that generates electricity to run the pumps might be promising.
So: Mexico Railway. Paraguay road. Reduce pressure and create redundancy. Bad for Panama. Good for South America in general.
Bruh, fix your audio levels- remember the meters aren't supposed to be in the red
Going to go check the US position on that corruption perception list.
2:50 “From the Pacific Theater into the Caribbean”  Who writes these videos? The Pacific Theater is what combat in the Asian South Pacific was called during WWII. These people think that it's the name of the US west coast.
“When the new millennium started in 2000”  The new millennium started in 2001. Is that so hard to understand?
Why does it have to be fresh water that needs to be pumped. Why can’t they use the ocean water?
the Audio needs to better mic'd and clear for the narration to shine.
the audio quality is absolute shit in this video
nothing is breaking down it’s a cycle of storms
The US should solve our border crisis and the canal issues by building our own canal nearby the US south border.  It acts like a moat along with full US control of the canal for trade
we don’t own it but if they said no we would take it back   who owns it
The highest part of the canal is 26 meters. Just blast out a 200 m wide sea level channel and be done with it. Surely comparable gashes have been dug in the past.  The kennicot open pit copper mine in Utah, for example.  You could also create an auxiliary salt water reservoir of lock water at the altitude of the fresh water reservoirs and use that for the locks.
Northern Sea Route between Europe and Asia via Russia is wide open.
Here's a 36 minute video with about 10 minutes of information and 26 minutes of repeating it.
Never forget 30,000 Americans died building the canal and jimmy Carter sold it for 1$
"El Ñiño" is Spanish for... "the Niño"
So why can't Panama modify the canal water supply by getting the water from the oceans instead of using fresh water from the lakes? Is the salt errosion the problem?
Instead of letting the water go from the locks into the lower lake why don't they pump the water from the lower lock back up to the lock above.  Keep recycling the water through the locks?  Is this not possible?
@moaningpheromones 1 second ago 'green energy' = lies and propaganda. 'climate change made el nino worse' = lies and propaganda, both climate change theory and the effect stated as fact. Apart from that BS political dog shit to step around, not bad.
what happened to the audio quality? is this some weird ai voice stuff?
Maybe, just maybe, infinite economic growth on a finite planet is bad?
The USA gave it up too soon and should have kept to the original date of release.
just pump it back lol ...where is the problem there?
Audio is very harsh
Puro MEXICO!
Obviously this proves that what was "Global Warming" then as that didn't sound scary enough became "Climate Change", and now "Climate Crisis" is real. Recognise Brainwashing for what it is.
You need to fix your audio. It sounds like you're blowing my speakers out lol
May more alternatives to the Panama canal be built and may worldwide commerce boom!
Let's see... Water for people or our money... Our money - i love panama
Facts combined with speculation and opinion do not constitute a real assessment of the current situation.  Please STOP the BS
“Before modern climate change was *well* understood…”  Lmao predict the weather 1 month out, now tell me what it’ll be in 50…… years…
No, the Panama canal is not doomed. A cyclical climate event will balance out.
Do we need another video on this? every channel and their father has made one.
9:00 NOT even 100 years of record keeping about El Niño, and they make out to be dire. It's a cycle. NOT climate change hoax. Then the ships have to go around. When the cycle repeats back. Go back to the panama canal. Problem solved. Or Built another canal in Nicaragua.
March last year, i started to plan to move to Panama for retirement. I'm a Swiss, living in Thailand,but i have enough of all the problems here, and they getting bigger as well. The more i searched for infos the more and more i found out about the Canal problems and they got much bigger since then. The domino effects will create huge problems in Panama. People demonstrate more and more,block many Highways for weeks,people die because of no food,water,gas and meds not get through. The Gov will have more and more problems to control the masses if they have much less money....Nobody who works at "helping people to relocate" to Panama talking about that. In fact, when i started to ask Q on their social site, i got almost no answers , oh not a big problem they say. I wanted to know more and asked again, and then i got shot down. I will not move to Panama, invest money there to have a nice retirement, only to have no peace when the troubles get worse. Thank U for that Video. Take care.
Technically they could pump the fresh water into the lake from both end instead of draining it into the sea. Seems like a lock is not that big of an ammount of water. Then they are talking about road but wouldn't train be a better solution ? IDK we'll see what future as to bring :)
Is it really that big of a problem to pump water back in? I really doubt it. If so much trade is happening there shouldn't really be an issue with money to finance it.
There might be something I don't understand about the physics of how a canal works, but it seems to me like you could install pumps in the locks to recycle the water back into previous locks or the lake itself, instead of releasing it into the ocean at the lowest lock. It probably wouldn't be cheap to pump water at that volume, but that cost would just be carried over to the shipping companies by higher fees (and by extension, consumers), and it would likely still be cheaper than traveling around South America altogether.
Your videos are great. Continue making them.
Invest in Mexico.
I will solve it for them. Instead of using the lake water to feed the canal, use the sea water. Use the money considered for other new routes to build the infrastructure to pump sea water and might as well invest in desalination to ease the lack of fresh water.
There is another alternative it's called barges
Finally, something interesting is happening in south america!

You are conflating weather and climate (like most seem to do).  While you do mention the El Niño, which is weather, you neglect to touch on the fact that this one is unusually strong.  That is why the particularly dry rainy season.  One (or even two) rainy season is not climate and, yet, you say it is.  I've gotta tune out after that.
Why not just build a railway in Panama then?
Nothing much green about lithium mining...
What about Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, is that place obsolete that we cannot send warships from there? Are we unimportant? Not a strategic area in the Pacific theatre?
Pump water from the sea. Problem solved. You're welcome
I'm not an engineer, but why wouldn't Panama just install pumps to use sea water instead of lakewater?
Control. Once you're done learning about control and why to stop it, this here sweet spot opens back up. If there wasn't a (Castro is my hero) idiot standing in the way the laziness and wokeness goes away.
26 meters 😮
52 million litters of water for each freaking trip? WTF?
Who ever is doin the voice over? SLOW IT DOWN!!
outside of litium (which is very very important), there is also something to have in mind for the alternative #1: food brazil is the world's biggest exporter of animal protein. most of it goes to china and the middle east. it's also the world's biggest exporter of soybeans (which are grown roughly close to that region, despite people saying it's grown "in the rainforest"). by a large margin. most of it goes to china. so using chilean ports would save a lot on logistics. A LOT. also coffee and other stuff but this goes everywhere. and food doesn't stop being consumed, so
淡水化設備も含めてパイプラインで水を供給する必要があるようですね、重要海路です。
There is also the land bridge in existence between the US Pacific NW & the US East Coast. The Ports of Tacoma & New York have been operating together for years.
One big problem for the panama canal is a political one. We are right now 5 years deep in the most incopetent Administration we ever had. 2024 is election year and if the same political party wins we can say Bye Bye to the panama canal because the A-Holes are more focused in stealing money than actually solving problems. There are so obvius solutions to this problem and the gob is doing jack shit. I am worried about this because this represent a huge part of the economic sector and foreign investment... If we loose the canal our economy will go to drain
Recycle the water. Instead of discharging water into the ocean, then draining new water out of the lakes, drain the lower lock by pumping the discharged water back up the slope to raise the level in the upper lock, and let it flow back down through the middle lock. Costly yes, but better than having to choose between killing the canal (and losing the toll revenue) or killing the people (and losing the tax revenue).
Climate change isnt what caused the lack of maintenance on the canal. Our entire world is obsessed with climate while refusing to acknowledge the amount of work that comes with maintaining nice things.
build a desalination plant and add the operational cost of the plant to the ships going through the canal. probem solved. so long as the cost is cheaper than 18 days of shipping per ship.
If not for the Rockstars Van Halen most of us would have no clue. El niño is man-made weather manipulation. If you pay the fee you won't get drought or flood whichever causes damage to your land
Since the US has such a strong freight rail system (ignoring the derailments and lackadaisical safety measures), wouldn't make since to use trains instead of the canal?
if you manage it better by not dumping it in sea but pumping it back it the system you will not loose that much, the loss will be only about 6%  of the total loss it is today.
Love the video
Desalination anyone?
Why don’t they use salt water
Voice is ai generated, lol. 🤖🤖🤖
i'd like to voice political support for infrastructure projects generally and their role in modernizing the world as a whole.
Am I the dumb ass here that thinks. Why the fuck wouldn’t you just create a catch system for the lock water. Instead of spilling it into the ocean every time…?
we should make larger boat that go really fast
They should get the chinese to widen it. I bet then the US will offer a super low loan to avoid chinese influence, otherwise the US will just send money to Isreail for free
Why can’t Panama use the ocean water to operate the locks
The Panama Canal is operated by a Chinese company that pays Panama for the right to control it.
Call me stupid maybe but wouldn't this whole problem be solved if the water from the first chamber would go back to the 3rd one to be recycled?
We have the technology to run a resivor from a larger water source the lake.
They should ask fundings from their new friend, China. Wait, China's broke 😂
So many words, so little said.
I was in Panama from early December 2023 to late January 2024 and it rained heavily almost everyday around Panama City ☺️
It can cost as much as 300k dollars to cross Suez canal. And up to 1 million to cross Panama canal.
Sounds like a strange AI generated version of your usually high quality voice overs?
What’s with the sound on this episode? Sounds fucked
My reminder that Jeffrey Epstein and John McAfee didn't kill themselves isn't blocked
Funny how the UAS wont allow major Chinese investments on the continent whereas the Chinese should allow UAS millitary in their own country
Why not use pumps. The fresh water is now pumped into the sea. Why not just pump it back to the highest lock. Then you can use it practically forever, and you have water left over for the population. Yes it takes energy. But place solar panels and a one-meter high wall along the canal and you have gained your energy.
Remember that suggestion back in the 50s about using nukes to make an alternative for the Suez canal? Would probably work in Central America too...
The canal has paid for itself 1,000 times over. Just build a new one. One that's not a century old.
I think most logical choice would be building a desalination plant into panama, if money is to be splurged even more, then also widen the canal.
I suppose the climate change that's causing this here is global warming. To intensify come summer.
You changed your sound profile?
I like your videos but "climate change" man. It's an unproven theory that's main goal is to reduce carbon. Btw were the carbon they're trying to reduce...
If I had a nickel for every time there was an unprecedented maritime crisis through one of the world's most critical trade choke points...
So, world's strategic logistic choke point rely on rains... Great design.
Panama Canal solution - obviously with some cost.  Use solar-powered electrical water pumps to pump fresh water back up the chain.  So instead of lowering the water by letting it flood into the lower lock, pump it out, back into the higher area.  That would need a lot of very high volume pumps, and would consume a lot of electrical power - but would conserve the water.  If the electrical power can come from a solar farm, then this might be possible to do economically.
The best solution is to go to the nearest Country in the region and build a new canal using modern technology  that pumps sea water in to facilitate the function of the locks.  And as another commentator suggested... Building it to facilitate the passage of ship in both directions.   The Panama Canal is antiquated  bygone  technology.  Carter: the Bean King actually may have done us a good service by getting the U.S. THE HELL OUT OF THERE 😊
"while this major maritime crisis rocks the Middle East and is negatively affecting the global economy, there is ANOTHER similtaneous maritime crisis happening one the other side of the world"  this might be one of the best opening lines to any video essay I've ever heard
Maybe a stupid question, but why cant they use sea water in the locks?
Your narrative is very annoying.   No one is impressed by someone who speaks so fast that their brain is stressed just to follow along. The only people impressed are followers of (           )  you know who I'm talking  about. 😅 I won't  mention his name here because He's a Jew, and I don't want to be censored for being Anti-semetic. 😮
It seems they need some big pumps to feed the canal from the sea instead of the lakes. Of course to power said pumps they might want to use hydroelectricity, which puts them back at square one.
Why don't they pump water from the ocean???
LOVE TO COMMENT BUT YOU ARE  A DIRT
I wonder how much of this problem was caused by the increase of water usage due to the larger locks.
More climate change BS. If its getting hotter and the ice caps are melting there should be more water, not less. Im tired of people using the so called climate change interchangeably.
Your audio is a little rough friend
2024 it's just January!!!!!!! I thought atleast in India it's going well but India Maldives row escalated and Nitish Kumar joined BJP . As a BJP supporter, i really hate this decision , that sexist and misogynist politician deserves ti be in prison
Man no need to compared what happened in Middle East with what could happen in Latin America, just not and we could start by mentioning that the lithium in Bolivia, chile and Argentina won’t be half as revolutionary as the oil then we can mention the mediocrity and corruption of the governments that cycles over and over again.  The potential of this region could’ve been greater just with the oil and gold but instead only brought misery and poverty, so you have a great optimism but I think it won’t happened.  Great video as always.
Water controlled by government is the same as when the nobility were the  only ones allowed to hunt deers.
Why can't they just pump sea water instead of fresh water from the lakes?
Easy solution: instead of pumping the water in the ocean -> pump it back up. Problem solved. The cost of some pumps and electricity should be less than the cost of passage for big trading ships.
They had a chance to make a second canal decades ago and wasted the opportunity
Slow down
Seems like they could pump the water for the first lock into a water tank, instead of into the ocean. Then draw it back out of the tank to raise the lock up again. This would save a huge amount of fresh water. They could even use a water tank for each lock if they wanted. The first one is the most important though.
Wait, wouldn’t ships with more cargo, that displace more water, be better? Why does displacing more mean that you need more water? Wouldn’t displacing a larger volume increase the water level thus requiring less water to pass through?  What am I missing?
Is it just me or did your microphone quality take a massive drop in quality recently?
Oh you believe the climate change bs 😳🔫.  As u said natural cycle every 2/7yrs ffs
If they with use additional damns for the municipal water supply- they could change the lake water in Lake gatun, to sea water and use salt water all around?
Wouldn't adding Pumps to the locks on the way out instead of flushing the water into the ocean help?
Why not pump the water from the first loch back into the lake or the 3rd loch? Energy?
you need to turn ur gain down bro
Why can’t they pump seawater instead?
So basically they need to set up some pumps in each of the canal gate sections and instead of draining it all off into the oceans pump that water over to water treatment plants for drinking water...
Why not skip the lakes, add a couple more kilometers of canal and have a direct, lock-free connection?
How about trains?? Does all of America hate trains so much? Why build a truck road through the amazonas
We are sitting at the precipice of the projected timeline of this “project”. Really an atrocity but I get why it was thought of as an idea to help trade routes. Jus, like why don’t we EVER listen to the science behind the investigation? Like seriously, no forward thinking when they decided to cut into an actual land bridge. Even someone with the most basic knowledge of currents can understand that what we completed 100 years ago would change flows of water thus changing how the over all ocean health would be in jeopardy. What we do to our waters is put right back into our selves.
All ships travel the suez canal freely. Only the one destined to israel
Why didn’t the people who built the Canal use salt water instead of fresh water to refill the first couple tanks?
They need a desalination plant.
I know how they can solve inflation A. You sort stop blaming it on this and say it's greed of the rich. B. To fcking bad shipping companies and big companies in general can take the cost for once and deal with it like the normal mug has too and stick there profit in there arse too bad you have a year without profit
Pumped hydro is the only option...
Fake news
Im sure that someone or a group of someones have already solved the water problem. But, its being held up by government as theyre trying to figure out how to pay for it. I suggest they solve it soon before another route is utilised which could end up being far cheaper than the current cost.  The overland options are one potential route which shipping companies may seriously consider. Costs cannot continue to be passed on to consumers at the current rate as they to will soon run out of money and will decide against buying certain products which could cause a massive slowdown in consumerism.
Confused.  Why choose trucking over rail for moving cargo?
I am sure the USA will find endless wars to uphold their interests.
Lithium should not be counted as green solution. It is a toxic substance and as battery technology a massive fire hazard.
why dose your audio sound like that?
Why does America have to police the world? Seems to me this is a European and middle east problem, they should solve it not us.  Also, about Panama, just use pumps.
Panama needs to invest in desalination plants. But i understand that you don't get rich spending money and won't stay rich if you do.
Color me surprised that they're prioritizing the citizens. Doubtful that would happen in the US
When you remove the human context from events you sound a bit sociopathic and propagandaish.
Why no mention of the passageway through Canada?
Jimmy Carter made a big mistake losing power over the canal
Seems like the fix is emptying the bottom locks into a separate reservoir then pump that back into the main reservoir.  It seems like a waste to just pump it into the ocean. Yea when the canal was built climate change wasn’t a big issue. But now with it being an issue why don’t they just route the water from the bottom canal back into the lake? It was just take massive pumps and electricty to pump it back up hill. Yea the electricity will cost a bit but it’s better than wasting billions of gallons of fresh water.   Am I missing something because it’s clear as day to me…..
++ the trade only disrupts tpilet products/ trash filler from china this helps push for domestic sources and pivot away from them
tHats all I win copycat copying me
Can they trench out the path across Panama to sea-level depth so locks are no longer needed?
U left out y Yemenis are blocking and which ships
Install pumps of seawater, thereby using more salt water than fresh. It will only detain the eventual loss of fresh water.
The new millenium started on Jan 1, 2001. There was no year 0 mate.
why not use sea water instead of fresh water?
TLDR There isn't enough rain because of the 2023 droughts caused by El Niño. That fucks with the canal.  There, I saved you 36 minutes of your life.
It is not blocking shipping to Europe, only and only ships to Isreal, with a condition that if they stop attack on civilians in Gaza, the blockade would stop immediately.   So please be specific and don't mislead your audience.
Why not pump salt water in to locks 1-2 and not lose any fresh water?
That's why my temu is taking so long
Argentina is busy trying to sell their economy to the US
ah yes the Chungus river I see
The solution could be to cut the canal down to sea level on both ends! That is only around 200 feet overall the length of the canal. Then no fresh water is needed!
How much energy would it take to pump the water back up the locks rather than just pumping downhill? Would recirculating the water be feasible?
While it wouldn't make a huge difference, if we are playing the game of "every ship counts," perhaps we should not allow cruise ships to traverse the canal.  Big point--the new locks were too big for the old reservoirs.  Serious design flaw.
If the elevation raise is only 27 meters, why not deepen the canal and get rid of the locks?
This El nino may be bad for that canal, but it has been a huge benefit for the Horn of Africa. May it last longer
…or enforce a permanent ceasefire and end the current genocide..Houthis settle down and everybody goes back to counting their money. Pretty simple.
Learnt a lot from this but in that education I now have questions. Why would they restrict one or the other normally water restrictions are imposed on everyone domestic and or private enterprise with very few exceptions belonging to the government infrastructure hospitals etc. And why can't they use sea water to fill the lochs? I understand that salt water is more corrosive and damaging to infrastructure but there's solutions to that. Was gutted when you didn't mention anything about the most obvious  water choice solution that covers 71% of the planet
lol as a geologist/environmental scientist who has actually been to the canal it is very very safe to say this is complete bull shit. Mental gymnastics and correlations for click bait for the uneducated
As soon as you said “ effects of climate change”, it made me think you support the current scams that governments of the world use to fool people in thinking that suddenly the world will burn up when it’s been changing constantly since time began
So, why can’t I be pumped back into the lake? What the problem with that?
Wtf is up with the audio quality of this video. It's like it's been compressed to hell and back. Hasn't happened before :(
Is it my ears or is the sound quality of this channel gone to shit?
Just went through the locks.  The answer is obvious.  Pump the water back uphill out of the locks. Put in some big pumps.  Will raise the cost of transiting the canal but should be worth it to ships.
Wait...the Panama Canal's locks consume water? I thought the Canal recycled the water it uses.
When you keep making the false statement about "pumping water" to raise and lower ships, since the water uses gravity and all they do is open the valve to allow water to flow from the higher lock to the lower, completely discredits your video.
B1M's version was better sorry.
This was an outstanding analysis. I learned a great deal. Thank you for all the work creating this.
I think you should make shorter videos
I just did a partial transit ( via cruise ship) in December- it was pretty cool and it’s also running out of water in the big lake - can’t recall its name 😮- so lack of rain is a massive massive problem with the Panama Canal
Video is LOUD!!! Audio overdriven. Please record at a lower volume. Sounds like old fashioned ear r*pe
12:50 a gta4 reference
:)
Why is the mic quality so weird?
not sure why any governments with shorter links from coast to coast - say, panema... don't just have a rail network to replace the canal...
China gave up on Nicaragua but they sure putting their faith in Mexico and their canal even investing on it same with the USA but it seems China has the upper hand thx to the investment and relationships alongside Russia and with the USA sorta beef with Mexico it’s not helping the USA situation for their part of the Mexican canal
Everytime we witness a long drought, we witness the same area getting rain again! The climate hasn't changed anywhere!
I don’t understand why they have to pump the freshwater out to the ocean. Why can they not pump it into a new holding  reservoir and then reintroduce it to the canal when need be? Seems like the cheapest/easiest solution.
Panama is not capable of managing and developing the canal.
Greetings from Paraguay! We are working hard every day to transform our national economy that is still dependent on agriculture into an industrialized economy.
Did you change mics? Tbh the audio quality is really bad compared to most of your more recent episodes. Lots of reverb
Desalination plant needs to be built
Interesting information.  Horrid presentation.  Was almost painful listening to it.
Tunnel Boring Machine = solved
Why don't they just dig the canal deeper to sea level?
Unsubscribing because of the AI generated narration voice
I f**king love this channel
records going back to the 1950's aren't historic lol could this channel be anymore bias.
Incredible amount of information in this video and animation footage. 100/100!  I enjoyed learning from this video.
Carter blatantly lied about TMI (despite his area of expertise being nuclear power), weakened Cold War talks, tanked the economy, was weak with Iran, and screwed up the Panama Canal. God Carter was awful.
the big question is how long will egypt allow a bunch of hoodlums in junk boats starve them from the money that the suez canal otherwise brings in. Now im not suggesting that egypt will ever endorse israel but most or all of the ships being attacked arent even relevant to the gaza incident. Its just another chance for the "rebels" to "stick it to the west", at the expense of a large and powerful middle east player
The War in the middle east will end and it will be business as usual? Seriously? You have taken glossing over reality to a whole new level.
maybe a dumb question but why cant they pump in seawater to raise the locks?
15:48 “unfortunately there’s another simultaneous maritime crisis happening right now you may have heard of around the Suez Canal. With Iranian backed Houthi’s firing missiles and drones at ships in the area, And the United States and the United Kingdom bombing them.”   😐😦😂🤣🎉
You forgot to mention that Yemen did that bc isreal is starving gazan...and the attacks are only on Isreali ships
Why is mining lithium OK for green peacer hippies but oil is not?? Same shit! Its minerals
Great CHACO!!!
@12:30 "to reduce the amount of water used, reduce the volume of the cargo" ??? wtf, its the other way around guys! less displacement means more water is needed not less...
Why wouldn't they build 1 extra empty water basin, where they pump the fresh water. Then when they need to empty it empty it into this basin. When they need it again pump back the saved fresh water into the lock?
I'm 12 mins in so maybe he explains it.... WHY DON'T THEY USE OCEAN WATER???? WTF
Here's a bar bet for ya ...  If you travel from the Atlantic to the Pacific, do you travel through the Panama Canal from: A: East to west B: West to East  (The answer is ”B")
Why don't they just dig out the massive amount of land to allow the ships to pass through at sea level?
17:48 is actually a bridge in my hometown it’s called the Kohlbrandbrücke in Hamburg there are some cool spots where you can sit and smoke a joint while watching the ships and the workers on the docks I also drove many times over the bridge sadly it’s gonna get demolished in the next years
Excessive use is what is drawing the lake, not climate change.
Mexico opened recently an alternative rail line in between the golf of Mexico and the pacific, looks like the best alternative to the Panama canal so far
I still don’t understand why they don’t just use the Boring Company to build two tunnels  (end on a west coast harbor and starting at east coast harbor) and just unload and send them in tunnels then reload them on the other side. Would be why cheaper (Costa Rica would be perfect) they already have the ports on both side. Musk claims it was only 1 million a mile. So it would be way cheaper then even 1 billion and would upend the Panama Canal monopoly. $
Last i checked weather and climate aren't constant! Study up on the Roman warm period, the little ice age, the cause of the black plague, how the gulf of Mexico used to reach into Canada and palm trees grew in Colorado!
What a dumb ass system. I thought they were simply recycling the same water every time. What a lazy, cheap, medieval solution it is to just send all the fresh water to the sea, because they're too lazy/cheap to build a holding tank.  It's not that complex. If you can build an entire damn canal, you can build a holding tank and power source for pumping. What a bunch of lazy ass BS. Only possible because we give corporations/businesses free water. If they paid market rate for this water, the canal wouldn't be feasible at all.
I find it frustrating that in the first 30 seconds you divorce all the actions of the people of Yemen from any precipitating cause or event.  This didn't happen in a vacuum. They are acting in response to the genocide being committed by Israel.  If Israel would stop commiting genocide the problem would be solved.  It's disappointing to see you tapdance around the most critical piece of this puzzle.
Probably a stupid question but why can't they pump the water back up instead of out into the ocean? I mean it would require a pipeline and a lot of power but that's got to be better than building new reservoirs. I'm sure there would still be some waste, and it wouldn't make transiting the locks "free of cost", but why waste the water?
How is your audio that bad? You sound like you're talking through an AM radio with poor signal, but you have 1m views?
Why does the canal water have to be fresh water?
ok why don't we just make another  trade  route  through Panama  but down at sea level  or would that be more difficult? hay, what if we can make a train  that uses 4 tracks to move ships from one side to another  like we do with cars pulling a boat out of the water  and taking it to the other side and putting it back in the water. like the super cannon Hitler made waking a shit load  needing 2 rails to move it just have   two trains that pull and push the boats as  the boat gets close to the side it is pulling tords it can stop detach then the cradle  holding the boat get pushed by the other train pushing the cradle and bot into the water the boat is destapped down and another boat comes into it get strapped up and pulled out of the see then the train reattach and they  move to the other side, or would that idea be stupid?
I live in Costa Rica, the rains in 2022 were insane.  The Nov and Dec rains were above average here.
So why don’t we just pump water from the ocean into the locks ? We can build huge pumps.
Why not pumping the wasted fresh water back into the lake?
Audio was REALLY rough sounding on this one..
Please fix the audio quality in future videos!
If one solution is to build a roadway across South America, why not just go through the United States.  The US already has an extensive highway system that goes across the country from coast to coast.  Seems to me (definitely no expert), that if it were that easy of a solution (one long roadway), there should be plenty of countries that already have such a set up in place.
AMANAPLANACANALPANAMA
That $4 million “bribe” is less than $0.10/gallon of freshwater, in the worst drought in history. That is an unbelievable, downright outrageous bargain! It’s the Panamanian version of growing alfalfa for export in the desert. They should add a zero to their price on water and see if they can still get 18 ships a day.
Unwatchable with this sound.
whys the audio fucked on this
If you played Factorio, you would know there are always consequences to increasing capacith on one system...
I wish I knew what you were talking about
How is lithium "green" when it has to mined from the earth? That is not green. Solar, wind, and hydro power are "green". It's not "green" when you have to extract it.
So this GENIUS design as you called it could not just pump fresh water back into a fresh water lake, huh? So genius my ass.
"Before climate change was well understood" This guy should be a comedian. 😂
Dig deeper and wider. Problem solved. Do not waste fresh water.
The Dutch need to step in to pump water up instead of down
"The Panama Canal is different than any other canal": proceeds to describe every canal ever.
I think the Panamanian government is more concerned about the revenue they make from the drug cartels than the canals.
something is wrong with the sound 🤔
Thank you - Informative and entertaining as always.👍
Thanks!
why does it HAVE to be sweet-water? why does it HAVE to be used and let out into the ocean instead of pumping up and down ocean water?
For the love of God, fix the audio!  Mic sounds blown out!
Was this recorded on one of those soup can string phones? 😂
why us the audio quality so bad?
Altho it would be insanely expensive, could they build some type of pipeline to channel water from the ocean instead of Lake Gatun to fill the gates?
Why on earth do they "pump the remaining water back into the sea"? If they can just as well pump it back to the canal.. and since it's dryer, they could use solar (mostly) energy.
Nice video.   Sals channel "what's going on with shipping" talks about this. It's a great channel even if your not a Mariner
Can't they just pump the fresh water back into the lake instead of releasing it into the ocean?
What did the women say?
sry, but your mic is awful
MrBeast could do something to solve these geographical problems.
Panama already has a rail connection that follows the canal. It was designed to transport intermodal containers, Sounds like it's time to expand that operation.
Columbia could build its own canal, it has La Honda River which runs to the Atlantic Ocean and at the narrowest point to the Pacific Ocean it is 42,47 km. Also if Mexico considered building canals across its isthmus, so then almost any Central American nation could consider it too. And if the USA is so rich and has a lot of nuclear bombs it could build canals through Texas to California or from Lake Superior to Vancouver island using those nukes. That way it could also separate itself from Mexico without building a wall.
Stay strong brother 🤝
Easy solution: wind turbines, pump the water from the lower locks to the higher locks to cut the amount of water used. When not needed, power the country with the electricity. Don’t have to be Dutch to figure that one out
Between this video and your balklans video - I am done with your channel. Spill your misinformation to someone else. Sad to see a good channel turn to such garbage. Bye from Canada.
Wouldn't the best solution for Panama be to update the system to pump water back into the second lock from the first lock? Thus preventing it from being washed out to sea.
After spending 6 weeks in South Africa right now, I can say their ports cannot handle this. Father in law works in Durban Ports and its already a 3 month wait time because 1/4 cranes are even working.
I think most shippers would rather just go the long way than try to coordinate 2 or more ships and pray that the added ports and railroad are all running smoothly.
Ok one thing I don't get.  During covid things were at a stand still for 2 or 3vyears.  Would rain over that long period replenish the lakes?   I think they need to find a salt water solution.
Why not install generators for the water moving from lock to lock, and use that to power a pump to pump the water back into the lake? They could do this for at least a portion of the water since there's always going to be salt going into the lake. Maybe they just do it for the upper locks, but still it's much better than draining the lake. They could also use solar power to power the pumps.
The Panama Canals are fine. There are two, I’ve been there.
Modern era, flips narrative back to historical era trade routes
I hope that the alternatives still develop. More options are always good and some people will prefer X over Y. That and the jobs created will be a MASSIVE boon to the local economies!
It seems like there's a huge opportunity here to redesign the locks. They could pump water back up a lock as they do this process to lower the previous lock down. Obviously they can't pump salt water into the lake system, but they could use ALL salt water in the locks before the last one and pump it dry in between back towards the ocean and pump it full of lake water to balance the level so that no fresh water is "consumed" in the process. The people need fresh water, no disputing that. It also seems like there could/should be an opportunity to look at building another canal that ONLY uses a straight saltwater passage through that strip of land without destroying the lakes.
Simple solution made another lock  on both ends and flush the water in reseve lock instead of releasing  inthe ocean and pump the water aagain in canals locks recycles
Why couldn't they pump the water back into the lake from the first lock when it is lowered.
For people not familiar with the maritime trade, a few numbers. Panama canal fees today for an average container ship with 15,000 TEUS is $5mln, including a hefty water surcharge. That comes to $300 per container, a substantially higher price than what it was just a couple of years ago. If the Tehuantepec option were to be used, unloading and loading each container at the other end would cost $200, or $400 for both and the railroad portion would be some $200-300, totalling $600-700!  Were numbers different, the project would have been done years ago. Likewise the simple idea of unloading cargo in Santos and trucking it for 1,500mi or 2,400km is simply absurd. At $0.10 per km that is $240 per ton. A ship will take that same ton from one corner of the globe to the opposite for less than a third of the price. Rail over long distances cost half as much as by truck, still grossly uneconomical. 90% of the world’s cargoes go by sea, and for good reason. It can be done for half a penny per km. 1/20th of the truck rate, 1/10th the rail rate. For non time-sensitive cargoes, absolutely nothing beats the ship. Nothing. And this is for containers. For break bulk cargoes, like cereals, iron ore, fertilizers, coal, the difference is yet more lopsided. For bulk liquids like petroleum or chemicals, even more. And for LNG (liquid natural gas) it simply cannot be transported other than by ship.
Having been the Panama Canal, I think they should rename it the "Panama Irrigation Ditch".....
did pro just say pandabuy canal or am i hearing things 1:20
SUCH Good videos
These ads where you say you're using stuff for things you're clearly not should be illegal.  I get that you're just reading a script but damn, I'm supposed to believe that with 7.3m subscribers, you need help saving up for a house? lol
I wish for you to use metric units one day. Like the vast majority of the world.
Why dont they reuse the Water in the Lock ? Some big Waterpumps shoud do the Job ..  Yes this will cost a lot Money  Or why not use Seawater for the Lock and leave the Lakewater for the Drinking Water Supply ?
In short, Panama needs to implement a queue system and a 2D space filling system that sorts the best paying ships..?
Panama needs to cloud 🌧 seed .
Spare us the climate change, global warming and acid rain nonsense. The Earth is a large place. There are good year and there are bad years. It’s not easy function on Earth, but spare us this nonsense.
RIP
Are you trying to make a point, i find one history lesson after another. And tiresome. bye
You forgot that the Panamanians added a new set of larger locks in June of 2016 that were never part of the original design and use more water. These new locks have been plagued with seepage problem. This coupled with the old lock system still working has more than doubled the amount of water needed to run the canal in recent years. Add that to low naturally occurring rain cycles and there you have the problem.
I don't see why the panama canal should die . All they have to do is dredge it .
So basicly China could hit the Panama channel and disable half of US fleet...
Instead of releasing the water into the ocean, could it be desalinated and pumped back up to the top?    It might be possibe to let the ship into the lock without the water getting ocean salty.
Ahhhhhh Climate change  That's why they spent all that $ expanding it recently
17:01 "Unlike the the problem, in the Red Sea that the US and UK are currently trying to solve with bombs, jets, and warships, The problem can only be solved..." - I think you underestimate the potential of bombs, jets, and warships to open up a choke point, assuming we don't care about collateral damage. On a less silly note, the Drake Passage is continually mentioned as "viable" but mostly restrictive due to the 18-day difference in transit time. This is not the Cape of Good Hope. The Drake Passage is way too dangerous. Your graphics and notes should include the Strait of Magellan. It's a small passage through Chile from the Southern Atlantic to Pacific, but avoids the majority of dangerous weather and currents that the route around Cape Horn is known for. The Strait of Magellan gets much narrower than the Bab Al-Mandab, but Chile and Argentina aren't waging a war here. It's plenty large enough for big ships, because many ships already transit here.  Tl;dr the Strait of Magellan is viable but adds three weeks or so to the journey. The Drake Passage is not viable. The storms make it a fool's journey for shipping. Braving Houthi missiles is probably safer.
I'm curious how much more it would cost for ships coming down the Mississippi, dock in Mexico, unload their cargo to trains, and shipped to the other side of Mexico and get on another boat. Instead of just sailing a littler further south and just go through the canal. It's seems like a great idea to help Mexico manufacturing but not for global trade. Same thing for the Paraguay highway. Really good for trade coming in/out of South America but not so much for anyone else.
Sounds more like a USA problem, rather than worlds
Please make a video about US Mexican border
That bit about not allowing fully loaded ships to save on water consumption makes no sense. If anything the opposite is true. The more water a ship displaces the less water is needed to raise the ship up. An empty lock would consume the most water.
and how's the dumbest solution to separate both America? Means levelling the entire 200km to make an actual canal. Like it would be cheaper than making a new river that long ?
dig canal at seal level and forget about rain
If only they had been able to make use of ocean water.   Yes, it would ruin fish life, but back when this thing was built, they didn't care about such things.
That dude lost 90% of his money and has 905 million lol
Pretty simple problem to solve. Just pump the water from the lowest loch back up to the lake. it may take a bit longer but you don't lose as much if any of the lake water. Also, why not use the drought to clean up that nasty lake?
18:02 HE SAID IT he said the funni
Kinda shocking a youtuber of this size has such shitty audio setup.
Why not just build container ships with giant wheels?  Then we can just build a road where the Panama Canal is, and the ships can just drive up out of the water, take the road to the other side, then drive back into the water and continue on their way.  Or, attach rocket boosters to the ships and build a jump on both sides of Panama, so they can just fire up the boosters a few miles out from shore, jump over the isthmus, stick the landing on the other side, and keep going.  It's so simple!
Is there a reason they can't just pump ocean water into the leveled gates?
Appears that the owners shall have to invest $$$$$$$ to continue their income.  I suggest considering huge pumps to pump the "used" water back uphill to be used again.  Reinvest in your main asset.
A land bridge will never be a viable alternative to the Panama Canal for a lot of reasons. Loading/Unloading ships is time-consuming and usually takes a minimum of a day. Trucks simply aren't viable because you'll need thousands of trucks running around the clock. Rail in Mexico is the best option, but at that point, you can just divert North American cargo using rail links to the US/Canada instead of loading it back onto a ship.  A land bridge requires coordinating 2 ships on each coast, which isn't ideal. Then you have the smuggling problem, which is probably one of the biggest issues. The Panama Canal is ideal because the containers are safely secured on a ship. As soon as you take it off the ship, the container is vulnerable to looting or being used for smuggling because it's so hard to manage thousands of containers. Even in the US, container security is a big issue that gets worse every year. People have no idea how bad it is. Containers usually have at least 100k worth of goods with minimal protection, which makes it a very attractive target.
You know.. these manufacturers and producers are a bit short sighted.  Why set up camp on the East cost and need to go through the Panama Canal to go to Asia when you can set up in West cost and go to Asia.  Likewise the other way.  Just goes to show that the people in charge are not necessarily the smartest.  Also.. Panama could just invest and dig 23 meeters across the nation..
Dont want to be like that but how is lithium and the mining of it in any way "green"?
Use very bit buckets in Creative mode.
Future future future. How do you fuking know.
I'm sorry, but why can't they retrofit the valves to handle saltwater?
Remember before capitalism had its strangle hold on the world, where we could actually collectively solve problems??
I'm from Paraguay, and I can assure you no one in here knows this info. I've never seen such a detailed explanation of South American logistics, honestly.
Ditch the locks, dredge the channel out so that the entire passage is at below sea level, and convert the lake to a dedicated resevoir. Make the canal into a passage.
Well, thank goodness this video is blaming "Global Warming" on decreased efficiency of the Panama Canal, instead of increased canal traffic consuming more fresh water.
Why all the fast talk
If only there was some type of mechanical devise that moves water in cylindrical tube that could put water used in some type of holding area that could recycle the water used to lift an lower..... someone should invent that
Another option is to connect the Alaska Railroad to the rest of the North America rail network. Freight could go from Asia to Anchorage and then be shipped by rail faster to the East Coast than coming through the Panama Canal.
"times of crisis" ...you mean times of war .... And Americas "full scale invasion" of countries that are realistically still in the late middle ages ....
why does the canal need fresh water? does salt water not have a higher buoyancy? wouldnt that make it even better to raise ships? is it an engineering issue regarding pumping?
Why you sound different in this video.
I wonder if they could pump water from the ocean into reservoirs near the canal.  That obviously costs money, but how much and how quickly would that be achievable vs the alternatives.  I would assume any alternative that requires over land transport will cost more for the shipping company than going through the canal.
There was an idea floated during the 1950's Atomic Age to use nukes to cut the ithsmus to form a channel 5 kilometers wide and 1 kilometer deep below sea level.  That way, no locks are necessary as all the shipping traffic can just cruise through the channel.   I wonder how the change in ocean currents would affect the oceans and weather, though.
You forgot the Panama Canal Railway, which has been in operation for decades.
why is the sound quality so bad on this video?
What about the rout up and around northern Canada?
Don't think I've ever heard somebody refer to Panama as 'South America' before...unless by "beneath," you meant 'to the South of'? 🤔
There's also way more people living there using way more water! They need to build pumps on the bottom lock and pump it back to the lake but it will take lots of power!
4 more years! 4 more years! 4 more years!!!!!
Easy. Once the canal was given to Panama they dont have the money or resources to improve it.
Awful microphone
Option 6: Let's just start paying the true cost for things and quit effing with the planet.
more climate change global warming bullshit.  Just like the middle east will have peace.  fuck off.
Pump sea watter in
Idk we can always rebuild the canal. Like we did when there was no canal
Theodore Roosevelt along with a bunch of Americans built the canal. A fact history books fail to teach
Would it be possible to operate the canal by pumping in sea water or would that require too much power to  make it economically feasible?   Also, why not improve the Panama railroad to handle higher a volume of freight?
Why not pump the first steps with ocean water?
Whenever I want to know how whoever is doing what and where, there’s a @RealLifeLore video for it
Why isn't ocean water just used or at the very least why isn't that water pumped into a holding tank and then refilled into each lock it came from - this seems idiotic
In UK canals we pump the water back into the water pool, they should really stop wasting all that fresh water it not that hard to do, just a bit expensive to rerofit what's already built, but it's still just a pump that should be capable of sending the water back into the lake
your script could use a lot of trimming. it felt like you kept rephrasing the exact same thing over and over again
So why dont they just build large tanks or reservoirs to store the water in the first lock as opposed to dumping it into the ocean? Like 50mil gallons is alot of water, but wouldnt it be easier than digging aqueducts in the mountains?
Russia's northern sea route has been expected to take off for almost 35 years now. The climate has changed enough to make it worth it, the time savings even over the Suez is worth it, and the ability for one nation to broker the passage (atleast directly to Europe as comparison) is much more viable. I believe like many others, that "This is the age trade passages will change and trade leaders will shift."
So basically there's no problem at all, unless all the dire predictions about "climate change" suddenly, magically and uncharacteristically start coming true for a change? Another  load of 💩 about "gl💩bal warming." Glad to see there's nothing to worry about.
Why not just use sea water?  Is it more corrosive thn the lake water?
Why can't they pump the sea water?
Had to stop watching the video. The speed of his narrative gives me a headache. It never used to be this fast.
Someone please help me understand why the Panama canal is not using salt water? Understand the corrosion that you would face with salt water but you would think that the maintenance of the equipment due to the corrosion would be cheaper and easier to deal with in order to avoid these costly delays.
Why dont they use Salt water for the ships instead of freshwater? xD
"Climate Change"...
Why not build desalination plants in Panama to create a fresh water supply ?
can they use ocean water instead?
Rotten!!
It has 3 gates, why not pump from the first section to the second to lower it to sea, then pump the second section back into the first?  You also don't have to worry about that water being salty as it's a small  section.  If it was a 2 lock system it would not be as easy. Only problems I'm seeing is "it cost to much to pump it back up rather then dump into the ocean". (the excess water from smaller ships vs larger ships could easily be put in a storage area near by)
Sounds like they should lease the Panal Canal to America again to get it done.
Why not build storage "tanks" in for form of reservoirs next to each lock and instead of pumping fresh(ish) water into the ocean they use that same water to raise and lower the locks, changing it out if it becomes too salty so the lake doesnt become a saltwater lake
Excellent documentary, I was unaware of the proposals in Mexico, thats interesting
Do you know about the proyect canal atrato truando in colombia . Thi will be at nivel ocean.
Green energy isn’t actually that green.
And...of course the Panama Canal expansion project has nothing to do with further depleteing the available water supply. Blame it on "climate change" Right!
why the fuck dont you put the measuments in metric too?? man fuck MILES
Time to invest in the lithium triangle.
So isn't the rational solution to pump water back into the lake instead of the ocean? At least when it's needed.
If 2020 taught us anything, it's that you can't trust globalization when it comes to creating goods. The inflation we sustained was created when the demand exceeded the availability. Having a 'Just in time' manufacturing processes that relies on foreign materials is a risky business to be in, and it's only getting riskier.  Buy American made products made from American made goods.
You gotta fix your audio man, not sure what happened, but it's really gone horribly sideways.
I hope the bi-oceanic corridor would have proper police presence, since i would be mostly concerned of the cartel / gangs that ravage those area.
Why dont they just build a rail line right beside the Panama canal? Shortest route, and the infrastructure is already there to support the project.
Man Mexico could be a world superpower, if they just got their shit together. The more I get older, the more I see it's unlimited potential, and how much they have fumbled it in the past via cartel corruption.
Why can't they pump water in from the ocean to fill the locks?  Or what about build some tanks at each of the locks that either pump water in, or suck water out of their lock to control the level, and reuse the water?
Costa Rica has also been dreaming for years to build a land canal,  to connect both oceans with railway and pipeline, recently Saudi Arabia show interest but I doubt it will lead to anything
I remember a Chinese company offered the Argentinian and Chilean goverment to build a railway that would connect both costs in the nortern patagonia region but there was no agreement
audio seems i bit off this eppisode, kinda sounds like talking through a tin can
Today I learned the scale of people commenting on youtube with their solutions to this problem is a new level of stupidity I didn't know was even possible.  Adding the climate change denial and Panama going through their worst drought in 120-year history, makes it even better.  Also the guy blaming the local population for drinking too much water, you are my favorite.
Maybe instead of doom and gloom, you discuss pumping the water back up and making it a ‘closed’ system to preserve water instead of dumping it in the ocean.
Surely they could re-engineer the locks to use a mix of sea water and then desalinated sea water in the section where they enter the fresh water lake. It would be a challenge but compared to the building of the canal it would be fairly easy
If the canal is so diplomatically & economically important, and MASSIVELY profitable then the solution could be to stop using gravity to waste the water into the sea (when lowering bottom lock levels), but instead PUMP the water up 26 meters ABOVE the start of the locks.  It wont stop the impact of droughts etc, but it would stop the loss of millions of gallons of "fresh water" into the sea with each passage. This would undoubtedly be slower than gravity, but compared to the "drying up" of the canal, might be the best solution, in that it could be added to the existing infrastructure (outlet of lowest lock feeds into water pumps to send the water back up.  Assuming the locks are consecutive, the length the water would be pushed would be "trivial" compared to domestic water supplies.  So there is "little" new technological "new" items that would be needed.  Love the lock animations↕⬇⬆
They could just build a dry dock transportation sysytem
Why not just dig it 26 meters deeper,  get rid of the gates and connect the two seas??? Or if they really need the gates and this is so necessary for world commerce then why not build a nuclear tractor close to it and use it to make all the energy needed to pump salt water into the gates instead of precious fresh water ??? Are my proposals as detached from reality as the phrase "if you are homeless just buy a house" ??? Is it economically unfeasible ???
Yeah, how about we start making things in America again and stop importing everything.
Why don’t Panama build their own railway connection adjacent to the canal? Feels like a lot of the infrastructure is already in place, no?
Why doesn’t Panama pump the water from the valves back into the lake instead of letting it flow into the ocean? Or better yet, why don’t they pump water in from the ocean and keep the lake water entirely for drinking? Salt erosion might be a concern but it’s nothing that regular maintenance can’t fix
love the comolete lack of engaging as to why and which ships the houthis are attacking. theyre doing it as a protest of israels genocidal assault on gaza and specifically targeting ships to israel. habent even killed anyone while the bombs the us and uk are sending have. biased much.
Since vision is a road to progress , bringing a pair of optics to see that vision is helped by the investor houses to sway  who gets their rewards with investors in tow . Theirs a carry over here , politicians and dictators across the world , this progress has always a steady flow of the crows on perch’s cawing .
Wait, wouldn't the water be replenished (although salty) as soon as a ship travels in the opposite direction?
This is why you always monitor and test sound. :(
Its interesting that the solution Panama thinks about is just drilling for more water. Instead a modern approach would likely be to actually utilize the canal similar to how energy storage in reservoirs works in Europe. Basically you can get energy with turbines when the water is released from a higher reservoir to a lower reservoir and then put energy in to pump water from a lower reservoir to a higher reservoir. The efficiency is very high with losses of up to 85%. So potentially the water could be pumped back up again with investment of energy (which will increase costs, but likely less than building a new canal or huge new reservoirs). Most of that energy could however be regained if the water that is passing through the levels of the canal is used for energy gain (if that is not already done).. But clearly a good functioning railway would also work out, I am not sure why it has to be in Mexico though and not simply right next to the already well developed region of the Panama canal.
You liar! That is the exact same all other canal works!  You called it different from all other canals then your explanation of how the Panama works turned out to be the exact same thing. That's how Canals have always been made to bring ships over high ground. All canals are like that! In fact the panama design is actually low and outdated tech. Modern canals are equipped with whats called a gravity pump. Its made with a pipe shaped like a cane and it sucks water from below and brings it higher. Its powered by gravity and the pressure in the pipe. This kind of pumping is called siphoning and the Russians have been using this tech for more then century. You arrogant Americans always call your tech superior to everyone but you don't even know how to siphon water???
There is another interoceanic way plan in Honduras also.
Is there any reason they're not pumping the water back into the lake instead of the ocean?
The irony of Panama canal is that the precious water is right there in that lower ship lock, the infrastructure to pump it is all there, but we cannot pump the water uphill because it would destroy the freshwater lake we are destroying by pumping it  downhill in the first place...

New Fitzcarraldo!
"it works complietly diffrent from other canals" Eeeh.. it works exactly like pretty much all other canals around the world
22:50 BINGO!
I remember the joke that the US decided to return full control on 1 January 2000 because of Y2K. If Y2K destroyed everything like a handful of people predicted, the US would have maximized profits from fees. If no boom, no harm, no foul giving it back to Panama.
what nonsense!!! literaly everything is WAR, WAR, WAR and WAR, whats wrong with USA?! dont you have better things to do in this world?! how pathetic!!!! your people are literaly dying but youre all invested in wars for what reasons you only knows!
Sayin the lithium ion batteris are the future is bigges nonsens i hearda, lmao. They pollute, and they are dangerous..maybe you meant Lithium IRON phosphate..
Shadeballs
The fact that they are considering every solution except for actually fixing the climate
Maybe I'm not understanding why it would be so hard to pump the water back up into the lake instead of letting it out in the ocean for every transit? Seems like that could have used more explaination.
The region in Paraguay the size of Austria: finally a "number" I can relate to as an Austrian xD very interesting to watch, as I was so deep in my studies I have not heard about any of the crisis in the last week, this is so crazy
What when rains come back?
Why not just pump that water that would be going out to sea, back into the Gatun Lake, sure the pipes longer, but that solves the problem right?
why da frage do they not use sea vater if the lakes are arteficial?

What evidence is there that Iran is backing the houthies
What tf is wrong with the audio??
I think you are missing the Mayan train.
If the governments in OPEC were willing to lower the price of oil would really help inflation in multiple ways. As for ships, the run on an oil fuel (like diesel) called Marine Fuel. If it were cheaper it would help make if more affordable for the shipping companies to take the long route without greatly increasing the cost. It would make good transported by train cheaper with the lowered cost of Deisel fuel and  it would make transporting good by airplane cheaper by lowering the price of Jet Fuel. This would then slow the fast rate of inflation in most of the world.  I just did a new budget recently because I knew I had been spending a lot more on food than when I did it last, two years ago. I was amazed to find that I am spending 2.4 times as much at the grocery store for the same amount of food. As for my debts that I'm paying off, much more of the money is just covering the increasing interest rather than paying off the debts. Housing has gone up so much that I don't thing I'll ever be able to afford a house where I live and I need to live here because I'm disabled and all of my specialists are here, not that I can afford a house anywhere else other than some I found near my mother's cottage, but you have to travel down a 30km dirt road into the middle of the woods to get to them. I have epilepsy and chose to not renew my driver's license because I was scared of harming someone else if I had a seziure while driving. Now i have to start from the beginning to get it again and I wish I didn't and that I just kept it but didn't drive because eventually I might have to leave this area and where I would move is my mother's cottage. I would have to buy an ATV for the summer and to get to town I can go most of the way on an ATV trail parallel to the highway, but I technically need a driver's license to go over the bridges and to drive it in town. I would also need an Snowmobile for winter... The -30C weather won't be so nice... And I don't know if I can get a PSW up there.  War sucks... Global warming sucks... AND DON'T BS YOURSELF THAT IT ISNT A HUGE ISSUE!
I might be missing something... So I understand that everytime they open the first lock after a ship has gone through (or is coming from "above") they drain the water into the ocean to equalize the water levels, so can't they just pump the water from inside the lock back up into the lake? Sure it would take some pumps and pipes which would add some costs but overall it seems like a pretty straightforward solution. There might be some saltwater mixed in but it shouldn't be a significant amount as the lock was just filled with fresh water from the lake, plus, from what I understand about the operation, some salt water already gets mixed in anyway...
Why use fresh water?
52 MILLION Liters of Water per Ship?!😮
The way out will be to build for each "see-step" an very big hydraulic cylinder for take the water what be used for lift a ship for each step away and back to the pool... Pumps will be ineffecive about the volumen but a cylinder would be more effective. thats my idea...
Green energy isn’t what it’s cracked up to be…..especially the cars.   You want green energy, nuclear power is your best bet.
the Spanish didn't keep track of weather back when they were colonies
Get a new mic
6:47 Pump the water from the sea, not the second lock. Same with the second lock the top lock can use the old system. 12:52 The more water a ship displaces the less is needed to raise it in the lock.
The audio on this sounds terrible
Why don’t they just create a dedicated salt water reservoir for the canal?
It's not "two point eighty-five " it's "two point eight five"
Back for my weekly dose of existential dread
Last i checked it was laTin america not laDen america....
I LEARNED A LOT FROM THIS THANKS
please fix ur mic settings
Bad audio quality. Distracting
I am ignorant about this subject. Why didn't they just dig a line and let the ocean water go through?
Instead of dumping the water into the ocean they should dump it into a reservoir.
waste of fresh water... why they don recycle?
They can always use the water from the ocean. It will be an expensive project to do but they can use the billions they rake in annually to invest in such infrastructure.
audio jacked up?
Green energy what a laugh. No country is close enough to even transition hahahahhaa
Is it just me or does the audio sound slightly off this video?
Let’s make the bold, baseless assumption that the voiceover is AI. If it is true, then I don’t see why u guys would want him to not use it at all (instead of improving quality). Its his freaking voice, and if this saves him time and money, then so be it.
Why doesn't Panama simply do what Mexico is doing, and BUILD A DAMN RAILROAD RUNNING PARALLEL TO THE CURRENT CANAL, TO SUPPLEMENT THE CANAL'S VOLUME OF TRAFFIC ITSELF!!! And then they can undersell the transport rates to other countries, to undercut whatever Mexico/Columbia/Paraguay can offer, thus driving their competitors out of business. No water would have to be diverted to make this a reality. And no Panamanian citizens would have to suffer, as a result. How in the world is this a bad idea??
When is the reupload with fixed audio?
Only this guy will weave war rhetoric into a simple climate based message. Can stop goading for war!!
Cough cough bolstering cross country/continental rail infrastructure
When the first transcontinental railroad across the United States was built, it was promoted as reducing passenger travel coast to coast to one week.  One year later, to a lot of people's surprise, 95% of the revenue was from transshipment of freight between Europe and China.   Not having to go around the tip of South America was even more important in the 19th century.  I'm surprised the rail option isn't being used (by at least US companies) to skip the Panama Canal.
Your audio is overdriven and clipping, creating an annoying buzzing artifact.
The mexican option is thought as a giant conveyor belt where products are received, assembled and shipped out.
So why exactly can't they dam off the fresh water reservoirs and pump sea water to use in the canal?
Kinda ironic how the canal is failing due to climate change, to which the ships that pass through it contribute so much
Stupid question? Not sure this was explained? But why can’t they use salt water in the canals?
Why not retrofit a closed loop system so they can avoid releasing tons of water into the sea?
You need a new Mic, or fix your levels my dude, this is almost un-listenable and blown out parts
This mf don't miss.
Wht a forgot Philippines add list bro USA plan depends china
Why do apparently intelligent people always get this wrong?  "...until the start of the new millennium on January 1, 2000."   January 31, 2000 was the last day of the previous millennium and January 1, 2001 was the first day of this millennium. There was no year 0!
Wouldn't a ship with a larger displacement take less water in the lock? -because it displaces the water with ship.
I have lived my entire life amid non stop global crises. What a fucking time to be alive
THE CANAL IS DYING BECAUSE THE NEW LOCKS VASTLY INCREASED WATER DEMAND AND NO NEW SOURCES OF WATER WERE PROVIDED.  NOT ONE WORD OF THE VIDEO ADDRESSED THIS.  The need for more water was known during design of the new locks, AS WAS the decreasing rainfall.   Water savings basins were subsequently added to the design which helped, and the lake level raised 3 feet, however if the rain doesn't arrive the extra 3 feet is not realized.
I think it is a BIG omission to say that Daniel Ortega has been in power since 2007....  This hyper corrupt individual was already called "dictador de pacotilla" by Ronald Reagan in the 80s!!!  Daniel ortega as been a dictator of Nicaragua for 40 years.  Four decades!  Saying he has been in power since 2007 is  HORRIBLE understatement in my opinion.
Omfg!  It's not climate change! It's because they built another set of locks much larger than the original locks and its using more water than the system was designed for.
This is one of the most well done RLL videos I can remember
To the 4th & final proposed alternative to the Panama Canal. Love how the biggest alternative to the canal wasn't even mention. Sorry Canada, so long as the US considers your stomach as international waters. It's not happening.
Fascinating, informative and easy to watch.  Loved this docu. thank you.
Why can’t they just use ocean water to supply the raising and lowering of ships? 😊
To prevent future bottlenecks, it seems wise to see most of these projects move forward (though likely not Nicaragua). Or, countries like the US might want to consider not buying so many cheap chinese goods.
God Carter was truly one of the weakest presidents
Someone tell Panama that climate change isn't real.
Or build a pump
I feel like I'm missing something cus there seems like a really obvious answer here: Don't use fresh water and instead use the salt water from each side of the ocean for their respective parts of the canal if it ends up flowing back into the oceans regardless. Yes it may require some work to change it over to prevent corrosion and use systems which can tolerate a salt water environment, but that would avoid the whole running out of freshwater problem if they end up switching to the near infinite source you dump it all back into regardless.
Simple although costly solution: Install a few powerful gas turbine generators connected to massive pumps. Run them when needed to pump the water back up. Charge ships extra when pumping is needed.
Yeah could put salt water desalination plants on each coast of panama and artificially increase crease freash water supply into the lakes.
9:59 song?
You think they would learn their lesson and stop with the canals, or use more canals that would still be affected by the climate and go with something like rail.. Lol
1. Why dont they just build a road in Panama like they want to in South America?  2. Why doesnt ship trade go through the arctic? Trade from the Mediterranean going to Japan using the arctic is around 10-11k miles while around South Africa it's like 17k miles.
jesus christ I had no idea the canal had three different water levels
2:30 - Minor correction, the "new millennium" began on Jan 1, 200*_1_*, not 2000.
Why don't they add more pipes that move water originally destined for the ocean back to a lake?
That guy only has 900 million now. He's not even a billionaire anymore. No canal for him!
Idk if they do charge the US or not, but I feel that Panama should grant US military free passage through the canal. If they do cool if they don’t they totally should! Considering the US built it
Ahh now I see, population growth like crazy and water consumption per capital 8 times the average of Latin America 😂 it’s funny how the primary reason never gets mentioned, when I check the story they are always not mentioned the primary logical reason for the problem always climate change 💩 or something else to make people think they have something to do with it, unlike as much as the locals or everyone else on the planet but always western countries are claimed to have a special sin status, shut it down and the Suez Canal to so we don’t have to deal with the problems, let’s make our own things, and oil and LNG can take the long way.
Dose the idiot narrating this video understand that the cargo being transported from the shipping ports to one side of the country to the other. In all of these countries they were proposed all would have to be protected and guarded by the military 🤔 due to the cartels that literally run half of South America lmfao at least with the panama canal they got the military right they’re protecting the entire stretch of the canal 🤔
But it's incredibly inefficient to unload ships, load trains or trucks, shuttle for a few hundred miles (or many many hundred miles, in the Paraguay case), then unload the trucks and load new ships! There's no way that can rival the Panama Canal in speed or cost, or the Cape Horn route, surely!
Why can't they just build pipelinesand use seawater
Am I the only one who feels like this video is playing at 1.1x speed...?
Nuclear reactors to power pumps to move water back up to the top of the system?
I don’t understand why the water used to lift/lower ships has to be wasted to sea? Can’t it be sent to the lake or stored or something?
Why don't they spend some of that sweet sweet canal moola on some fresh water from other countries nearby that might have some to spare? Or could they possibly pump water up from the sea to the lower locks so they don't have to use as much fresh water from the top? Or could they build another canal at sea level so they're not using the lake? They could possiby even use some of the existing canal and then just bypass the lake. IDK, just some thoughts I had. If anyone knows why these aren't good ideas let me know.
Real question, I know that they couldn't do it at the turn of the 20th century due to technology, by why can't we do a sea level canal across Panama.  Mines literally level whole mountains now, and it would preserve the drinking water for the Panamanian citizens.
I like how he saves the punchline for the end and it’s home to 50% of the lithium stores in the world. Oh now they’re building a highway through here no wonder ha ha ha mystery solved
Sounds like rail might help ship by train coast to coast.
How many trucks would it take to load/off-load one ship?
Since 1952 is not a long time, one average earth will have much more rainfall in the future and climate change is going to open up Northern routes past Canada or Russia, but maybe we should start making more stuff we use instead of sailing so long, it’s not like it’s not possible, whit automation it will make sense.
This is so obvious that there must be a simple answer to explain why it is impossible, but would it be possible to pump seawater into the locks and use that for the elevation changes for the ships?
Why don’t they just make movable baffles to reduce the amount of water and dimensional space in each lock based off the size of the ship coming through use the freshwater to become the weight that the equivalent behind the baffle so I’d be like a hinge baffle attached to the floor of each cell And then fill the backside with freshwater and then if it’s hydraulically attached to the actual wall winch that sucker clothes and pump the water back and use the water weight from the ocean water coming in to assist with the assist so you’re not talking a lot of extra juice, to which those back out again  This doesn’t make sense why they haven’t solved this along time ago
Awful audio man.
When the original locks were built there wasn't ever really a capacity issue. Since Panama has doubled the capacity of the canal and  with bigger ships lake Gatun dries out faster. This was a short-sighted engineering oversite by Panama especially since we've had El Ninos for like forever.
Maybe they should pick up the trash they have in those lake areas huh?  Nah just keep blaming global warming and keep dumping trash into water ways.
Tha idea that a boat uses more water the bigger it is makes no sense, should be the other way around
That global warming hoax is gonna kill us all unless a world Communist government is not allowed to take control of the world's means of production.
Would sailing through the arctic circle be faster than rounding South America?
Houthis only targeting Israeli ships only after usa n UK attacks yemen now theirs ships are legally targeting by houthus
Why not dig a surge tank and pump the water in and out of Panama
Crazy the fraction of toll fees for something as important as the canal vs the billions laundered in a corrupt and long lost war in UKR. "If we just give government more money and power they will make the weather gooder." Modernize the locks, return flow instead of waste to ocean, and fill lower locks with seawater Time to return manufacturing to America, and look internal.
There is another project, a railway in Guatemala. But it might be difficult for our history of corruption.
what happened to your mic
This is a fixable problem.   And could easily not use ANY fresh water or rely on ANY rain water.  Atlantic and Pacific are 25 ft. sea level difference depending on tide.  Lago Gatun averages 85 ft. above ocean level.  Either big ram or wind pumps and sealed reservoirs for sea water.  Or, git rid of all but 1 lock at each end (for tides), dredge Panama Canal 50 miles long, a mile wide, and 200 ft deep and drain it lower 85 ft.  Maybe get ready for big eco disaster (that will eventually recover) on the 2nd idea.  Either way spending big money and time.  Be a good time to build new canal at capacity size 400% larger, with low water level and all.
Water is power. They can pump from the lower locks to the higher locks, or even back to the lake. They can pump sea water up to the locks. It would effectively supplement the lake water with electrical power, and it would only be needed during low water problems.
An interoceanic railway was made in Panama in the mid 1800s, its just that is easier, faster and cheaper to cross the canal , rather than moving everything by train, I mean if the railway solved the problems it would still be easier to build it in Panama than in any other country in latin america since its the narrowest point in between the atlantic and pacific ocean, just 77 km.
And all of the fossil fuels that will be burned by the trucks using that corridor will be mined and burnt with exceeding joy. That's green energy for you.
Summary: There is an unprecedented crisis happening in global maritime trade due to problems at two critical chokepoints - the Bab el-Mandeb Strait leading to the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal. Hundreds of missiles fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen have caused ships to avoid the Bab el-Mandeb route. Meanwhile, severe drought in Panama has led to water shortages that are forcing drastic restrictions on ships transiting the Panama Canal, causing major delays.  The crisis at the Panama Canal is caused by historically low rainfall failing to replenish the lakes that supply water to operate the canal's locks system. Climate change and the El Niño weather pattern have disrupted Panama's usual rainy seasons. The canal may continue facing reliability issues if drought persists.    With ships facing weeks-long waits to transit the Panama Canal, some are opting to take longer alternate routes around South America or Africa instead. But conflict near the Suez Canal is disrupting that route too. The bottlenecks are increasing costs and exacerbating global inflation.  There are several infrastructure proposals to build alternative trade routes across the Americas that could rival or complement the Panama Canal, including roads and railways across lower South America, an inter-oceanic train across Colombia, and an inter-oceanic corridor in Mexico. If realized, these projects could reshape trade flows and reduce reliance on the Panama Canal.    To remain competitive, Panama may need to invest in expanding the canal's water supply and make it more drought-resilient. However, climate change threatens to undermine the canal's reliability long-term, benefiting alternative routes. Controlling the critical chokepoint may not guarantee Panama's dominant economic position this coming century.
“I am El Niño! That’s Spanish for…the…Niño!!” - Chris Farley, Saturday Night Live
The North west passage through Canada should be exploited more as that is becoming more feasible each year.
Build a big power plant to power a bunch of very large pumps. At the very least it should make a difference.
The Panama canal is not dying, its true that there has been fewer rain on the canal basin in the last couple of years, but the country is not lacking water and there are plans taking place to  connect other water sources to the canal. Though the goverment is trash, the Canal operates as a private entity and they are usually pretty responsible, hence they will probably push for the solution.
I'm sure there is a good reason, but why isn't the water reused rather than being dumped into the ocean?
Again great work! Thank you for this in depth analysis! Love your effort!
2024 will get more rain 2023 was the hottest year on history 😊
Container ships beat freight trains, which again beat trucks in economy on all fronts. I don't see why anyone would do a massive scale logistic belt with trucks as the foundation...
Just… redirect the used fresh water back into the lake.🤷‍♂️
how has RLLs mic quality become worse as the time goes by
Looks like a great time to clean up all those nasty looking shorelines and do some major upgrades to the canal for water while they wait for the normal rains to return.
So they waste tons of scarce and valuable fresh water. Great. 🙄
The "green energy revolution" is and always has been B.S.
Rail
Why did they not just.. Put the water back into the areas with fresh water?
Why don't they just use the seemingly infinite amount of seawater to flood the gates instead of the lake water?
"Climate Change" Bwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Why not use sea water?
The audio mix on this was pretty bad.  I couldn’t play it very loud. It’s not my speakers
`why dont pump the water from the sea instead of the canal??
We are so guck. I hope i become an oldmam before the world dies
One thing you didn’t mention is the recent expansion of the canal with several additional, much larger locks. These would undoubtedly have put significant strain on the water supply as they are significantly larger than the originals
Thank you so much Jimmy Carter another democrat idiot. The problem now you have people running the canal with not enough engineering and construction innovation.
why dont they just pump water from the ocean instead of the lake?
Great video
If El Nino is a regular event, why are you attributing this problem to "climate change"?  It looks there is room for two ships in those locks.  Hey, you know how they lift thousands of tons of ship with water? Maybe that's how the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids! wink wink, nudge nudge. Hey, maybe we could spend less on weapons and destruction and more feeder lines into the canal from more distant lakes of Panama!  What? Why build a road across thousands of miles of South America. Just build it across Panama.
Ten and a half minutes to say the Panama canal is running out of water. That should've been the headline.
Can the carriers get through the canal?
What about desalination plants? The increase of canal traffic can pay for it.
My concern is that China could potentially sabotage the Panama Canal. Perhaps they send spies and saboteurs in to disrupt the infrastructure, maybe they arm pro Chinese insurgents to take over the Panamanian government to deny American access to the canal. Or maybe they even intentionally cause a shipping disaster similar to the Evergreen in the Suez Canal a couple of years ago. Whatever the case, this could significantly delay American reinforcements into the Pacific and give China time to blitzkrieg across Taiwan.
Imagine no more canal perhaps America will develop their railways system.
You totally ignored the fact that the Hothies blocked the Isreali ships only in an effort to force a ceasefire in Gaza, and then blocked the US and UK after they boombed them.
Wow! You are REALLY dragging this out... 🤨
Just make a pipe from the ocean to the canals to get more water from the ocean. Don’t depend on rain.
Nuclear desalination plant on both sides.
Can they just build a giant pump from sea water up the 25m into the lake?
why not just use sea water instead of fresh water for the panama canal?
The start of the new millennium was 2001, not 2000.
11:10 you say 1 transit consumes the same water that 0.5 million people consumes per day. the grafiks says 2,25 million people a day. which is it?
This is really not an issue.  Or more correct to say this is simply an engineering issue. Technology has gotten 100 times better than it was 100 years ago, so check out. I'm messing with the easy , but it's quite possible for somebody to recreate the canal for modern times. The real difficulty is how long it will have to be shut down for this engineering. Marvel 2 happen, but they would have been working around. The clock and probably got it done in two or three years.  If they notice this becoming a long term problem they'll figure it out.  Also, you need to stop spouting that nonsense about climate change. Because you have no evidence that is from climate change. When you're admitted , the el nino effects have been changing for a long time, not just the last two times.  You run straight to climate change. Way too fast and it just comes off as fake. You don't need evidence, you can just say it's that because everything is that.   Sounds like this is just a normal cycle that is having a slightly unusual effect some years.  Rarely at any point in history have weather cycles been perfect. The u s farmers almanac will record the changes and show you the slight differences over time.
Just dig the canal 26 meters lower and connect the oceans endless water supply
Why Panama canal don't use sea water to raise water levels? Since both ends are at the seashore by neccesity, there would be no shortage of sea water. If I would have been an engineer planning the system, that's what I would have done in the first place.
The Houthis originally targeted ships with Israeli ownership, or travelling to/from Israel, to stop weapons/munitions going to Israel while they conduct genocide in Gaza (2.3 mil pop). Since UK and US bombed Yemen, in support of genocide (supplying munitions), Houthis now add UK and US ships to their target list. Once the genocide stops and humanitarian aid is allowed into Gaza, the harassment of shipping will cease. The International Court of Justice in the Hague found on 26 Jan 2024 that Israel does indeed have a probably case of genocide to answer for. Subsequently, the Five Eyes nations have withdrawn funding from the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRA), further abetting in the Gaza genocide. Yemen is probably the only country to stand up and actively intervene on behalf of Gazans, bless them.
Back when the amount of water being wasted didn't matter it was easier to have the pumps function they way they do now. The sea side locks should only pump sea water back and forth the middle gates could mix either way. At least that would cut the amount of wasted water almost in half.
18:25 Southamerican here and This is the Main reason (apart the corruption and stuff) of the under development of South American countries that even other American countries likes México believe that is only the politicians that keeps us poor, I mean that too but si hardcore for us doing trade even with ourselves
You can not forget the north passage that is forming.
Is it just me or is the audio f***?
Why not create a recycling of water system????  Invest one years 6% earnings to this development or more if needed will pay off.. has to be a way to do that.. Too bad we shit on all the Da Vinci's today...
You failed to explain the more important reason for the Panama Canal problem is tied to that the enlarging of the canal for super tankers and container ships did not consider the almost doubling its use of fresh water. If they made the required water requirements when they enlarged the canal this problem would not exist. Also if they did not enlarge it the problem they face today would not exist. Greed is often the root of our problems. It is now becoming more cost effective for the United States to bring manufacturing back to North America.
33:53 - I see what you did there ;) I know this lyrics...
bids are the adjustment for market value due to changes in supply and demand
I wonder how much the big boys playing God with the weather has to do with this event  ?
If you want to know more about technical side of Panama canal, channel Practical Engineering have whole film about it and also how they save water in locks.
The situation on the Red Sea is not due to the "war in Yemen", it is due to the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. If that is stopped, the Yemenies will stop interferieng with ships. Don't missinform your audience.
Plis stop the use of x2 audio
Excellent information, expertly delivered.   Thanks!
23:01 seems like a great case for trains here. Way cheaper per ton of freight than individual trucks. And we already have electric trains... Electric trucks are still a bit of a dream, and definitely not going to be widely implemented in south America for a while.
11:07 you say, half a million panamanians in a day, but the text show 2.25 million, what is the right number?
..... How bout pumping the fresh water back into the lake instead of draining out to the ocean? Seems that would cut down on a lot of water loss & the canal makes more than enough money to fund the engineering to build/manage that.
Kind of ironic that climate change, caused by burning too much fossil fuels, is rendering the Panama canal non-functional. Causing ships to burn more fossil fuels to transit around South America. Causing more climate change. Further rendering the Panama canal non-functional.
I'm starting to think that Sam's narration is now done by an AI. The should have more than enough training data at this point, and his delivery is eerily consistent.
Channelise lake Gatun. Run ships through the channel with salt water pumped from the sea at either end.
Question, cant panama pump sea water into the locks to replace the lost water, and then the lakes qouldnt dry up. This may not be possible, so let me know
Why cant they tunnel under the andes?
Ok did some checking  ‘23 rainfall was down 30%. Huge number from 2415 to 1690.  But this is attributed to El Niño, a cyclical event not climate change. The early to mid 2010’s was down about 10%. So rainfall does fluctuate. But to use climate change is lazy at best and misinformation at worst. Be beter
Maybe im being dumb, but why not just pump the water back into the lake instead of dumping it in the sea???
Why are they not pumping water from the lake to the sholding tanks and vice versa? This will not drain lake water to sea
If Panama were smart from the beginning they would've charged 0.5% to 1% of the actual product being moved and would have an endless supply of goods glowing into the country. And when I say the product I mean the actual stuff being moved not a fee.
this is Iie.   we have another lake to fill the canal lake. and 3 more rivers to multiply x 3 , the zone of rain water caption. making the basin of the canal lake bigger than Puerto rico or lebanon.   the canal is the spin of the Economy of panamá. we will do anything that we have to do to make it work.  the last last option is fill it with ocean water.  but before that desalinisate  and make more efficient the canal gates.
If Mexico can use a railroad and say its an alternative to the Panama Canal.... why cant Panama also build a railroad too? it probably would be even shorter too.
The US government built the Panama canal when "the opportunity presented itself" ah you mean when the US made Panama become independent from Colombia?
The Road that connects Peruvian Ports to the Brazilian one is like fuck my drag, right? Sure it takes like 7 days to cross, but it could still have been mentioned
While the water levels are low, they could collect some trash from the accessible lake ground. Its sad to see so much garbage that does not belong there😢
Chinese investor interested in Nicaragua canal then collapse in 3 years. Coincidence?
Can't they just start closing the channel route taken on the lake, then excavate the earth out of the lake, now a channel,  until leveled with the sea?
The project in the middle of South America won't work. Tunneling through the Andes aside, South America is SO corrupt at almost every level I can't imagine someone wouldn't want the chance to hold up the entire global economy if they don't get what they wanted. I used to do business with some latin American countries, and know a bit about the logistics. Correct about how they all ship to each other because of the roads and geography. However, of the roads that do exist - say between São Paulo and Rio, for example - there remains the risk of cargo getting stopped and hijacked for bribes. Sea pirates would be replaced with land bandits on motorcycles. I love latin culture and South America, but that continent is a mess.
I wonder if RealLifeLore is using a cheaper backup microphone lately. Maybe his previous one broke? It sounds like the current mic is at a constant peak. The distortion is extremely noticable and it kinda hurts my ears to watch these videos lately. I don't know very much about audio, but it almost seems like his gain is turned up as far as it will go
My information is that the original engineers that planned the old Panama Canal, built reservoirs for the full locks to pump their water to when then wanted to lower a ship.   The new "SmartAss" Panamax Canal builders neglected to build the reservoirs and chose to flush the receding locks into the ocean.   Now they are scrambling to build the additional reservoirs.
isn't this rather easy to solve? rather than dumping out the water into the ocean, just store it in a reservoir so that it can be recycled
So the lack of rain is climate change? Glad you’ll get your green cookie, but what evidence do you have? Or is it just part of a cycle that repeats itself. Love to see a video on weather patterns in Central America
The Bi-Oceanic Corridor is going to need to become a rail route as well if it's going to be to be a truly serious high-volume route. I'm also a little surprised the Panama Canal Railway was never mentioned, though it does need some significant expansion to become a bigger player.
Ah that EV talk and messing up Mother Nature more and more, both on land and water 😒
dig or dredge deeper
Don't say "climate change", don't say "climate change"..... ahh damn it.
Possibly dumb question: why don't they just use ocean water to fill the canal? Alternatively, has there been any discussion of using desalination plants to replenish the fresh water?
If container ships are built to squeeze through the Panama canal and the Suez canal but are no longer going to use either of these canals, imagine how big they could build these container ships in the future......
bro talks as he was from the DHARMA initiative 😂
2 RealLifeLore videos in 1 week is just comfy man.
Great story❤. I predict that that Panama lake will fill up in a week in the next 6 months.
Lake : 26 m high  China : We dig ! I mean , if the Suez canal is possible 🤷, why not ?! Just excavate !
I know, this is Mr Putin dried up the Panama Canal because what would happen in the world Russian are usually to blame, it's very convenient. Hello everyone from Russia btw 🇷🇺
Worth mentioning that the canal is useful and can save millions of $ (and many, many lives of crew members) because Cape Horn is the most dangerous and vioent stretch of ocean on the planet. Many ships that go through there face unreal waves (sometimes surpassing 15-20 meters of height) that travel very fast and are incredibly steep that badly damage the ships and their cargo if they are container carriers, without mentioning the enormous weight that the ice adds to them, as water is sprayed by the waves and immediately frozen all throughout the ships, making them very unstable and prone to sinking.  The clash of the currents from the Southern Ocean with the South Atlantic combined with the immensely powerful winds create some of the most unique and destructive waves on the planet.  Once you go in, you can't turn around, you simply have to proceed. The weather can go from extremely bad and dangerous to straight up deadly in a matter of minutes with no warnings.  The horrific stories that many seafarers have to tell about that passage are heart wrenching to say the least, many of them thought they wouldn't make it out alive because the conditions were just SO bad.  So yeah, it is a very dangerous place to go through, you really do NOT want to go through that passage unless you absolutely have to.
Lets quickly take note again that this is a consequence of CLIMATE CHANGE and climate change only. This problem was forseeable for at least 20 years, and like all the other consequences of climate change, couldve been largely avoided. And its not the last consequence of climate change were gonna be facing. On top of it being bad, it also makes things worse: Shipping emissions are among the highest sources of all CO2 emissions (about 3%). By losing these shortcuts, these emissions will rise and worsen all climate change consequences. Diverting to rail alternatives would be fine if they were powered with sustainables, as rail is also fairly eficient, but taking the truck way sounds just like another big L.
would desalination work? it's power hungry i know but good system could give them some time
I wonder how many extra days of travel it would take to go around South America... 🙃
Panamenin here, the canal is not dying and the classic photo of ships in line is a turn thing not that they are being negated to enter . We just had a really bad dry season as the whole americas
lol...Panama...dig the canal deeper so you don't need to raise ships as much; less water used.
But why does the water need to be emptied out in the ocean in the first place? Just put the water in a large pool and use it to help elevate the next ship going in the other direction. Or just pump the water directly back to the lakes. Or wouldn't that work?
Imagine telling to English speaking people a century ago "Paraguay presents a serious competition to the Panama Canal". And it not being a joke lol
5:38 the valves don't pump water. Gravity
Mexican cartels are the only issue I see when it comes to the passage thru southern Mexico, besides that Mexico would be a sound alternative, especially for US/Can
18 days .  12 weeks + 4 days,. That is 18 days .  3 weeks minus 3 days. 18 days.
26 meters high sounds not so terrible. Why don't they just dig it through like Suez?
If the high & mighty US won't support the eleventh most corrupt country in the world why does it support the #1 corrupted country in the world, Ukraine?
Its the age old tale of the boy flicking the other boys ear over and over till he turns and punch himin the head. The first boy runs and yells of how he was punched and how it is such a travesty, believing himself the victim, when in fact he started it and lost again. And so it repeats in the losing of the ages .
One love
The South Mexican railway solution looks really interesting. Especially if they eventually could manage to connect that railway and the industrial and logisitic hubs along its route, and by extent both the east and west coast ports, with rail going north and south. North into central and northern Mexico and the US, south into Central and south America. That's a lot of ifs and maybes, but in conjunction with the other national and international logistics projects on the continent, it _could_ completely revolutionize trade, commerce and oppertunities across the whole region. And if they're sensible and forwards looking in so doing, thee bulk of these logistics could have a fairly low carbon footprint too. Especially as the economic windfalls of this picks up, there will be a greatly increased capacity and ability to make the rail portion electrified, ideally using a regional-environment-suited combination of hydro, (off-shore) wind and nuclear energy.
👍
You didn't mention that Panama recently completed the Panamax locks which are much larger than the old locks, big enough to accommodate the larger container ships and supertankers. Larger locks mean greater water consumption. The dams and reservoirs  built for the old Panama Canal didn't have the volume to run the new locks. The Panama government will have to build some new dams to supply enough water to overcome a drought.
why do you always have to add "Iranian backed" in front of the Houthis? You don't say "US backed" in front of Israel or Ukraine or anyone else for that matter?
Watching this whole video, I kept wondering why they don't just pump the freshwater in lock 1 back up into the lake at the end... it took me a while to realize that because it mixes with the ocean water, that permanently taints it, so none of that water can get pumped into the lake or it will eventually salt the lake. However, if you could desalinate the water before putting it back in the lake, that would work. That might actually solve the pumping problem too... you'd need a lot of energy to boil that much water (gigajoules of energy), but you could offset that cost by using the steam to generate energy as well. Also, because the heated steam rises, you could use its natural buoyancy to transport it to a cooling tower at the top of the locks near the lake.
I like listening to the information you convey and the tone of your voice but I have noticed that it is somehow clipping and making it sound unpleasant, as it distorts quite noticeably. Please fix!
the Tehuantepec isthmus railway project in Mexico is just full of corruption and violence. People have been robbed of their lands, human rights violations have been committed. The regime, the cartel and the military are the only ones winning there. At this point I don't know if Mexico will have free elections this year.
The Canal is Dying all By Design..  47
The railway infrastructure project for Mexico’s Tehuantepec Corridor has already been completed.
Why can’t the canal use ocean water instead of fresh water?
With all the land-based transportation competitors, why doesn't Panama just build their own rail or highway connection across?  It still seems to be the single shortest distance connecting the two oceans, and it would be able to supplement the canal's throughput no matter the weather conditions / water levels...
My information is that the original engineers that planned the old Panama Canal, built reservoirs for the full locks to pump their water to when then wanted to lower a ship.   The new "SmartAss" Panamax Canal builders neglected to build the reservoirs and chose to flush the receding locks into the ocean.   Now they are scrambling to build the additional reservoirs.
"Stupid climate change, people have to stop waisting ressources like they did from dacades. We have to stop climate change, so we can continue waiting ressources like our grandparants did."
The easiest solution. (in my opinion) is to pump the water from the first lock back into the lake
Mexico new canal will solve this problem..
Sounds like it’s time to go dust off the plans for 1950s US operation PlowShare. Remember the Sedan Crater in Nevada? Easy and quick way to get through the mountains of Panama, heck we could turn the US into an island nation, a deep moat around the US no one can swim across, plus an easy way to get rid of the dust covered nuclear bombs. 😂
Pumps? Why not pumps? They’re making billions, spend one on building pumps…
Hot mic on this one, kinda rough to listen to
Good I genuinely want to know how sea water rise can lead to lack of water in the canal. Yes I know there is a system of locks.
This could benefit North and South America as factories will be built locally so not to depend on Panama and the Suez Canals.
they could invest money into building a system of pumps to fill the gates with saltwater atleast the lower gates so they prevent saltwater from getting into the freshwater lake
"...but, unfortunately, if I talked about that, YouTube would LITERALLY go back in time and DESTROY planet Earth with UNRELENTING fury, and you would NEVER have gotten this video to begin with. Thus: Nebula."
Blah,blah, blah man get to the point. 15 minutes in and you haven't made a point!!!
why not make a solar or wind farm and pump water from the ocean
why would they plan this with trucks? WE HAVE TRAINS
Almost seems they are cutting off their noses to spite their face!!!!
Why has no one ever built a desalination  station, when they know so well how do di it?
Restricting the water to the Lochs of the Panama Canal is Economic and Geopolitical suicide, and a short sighted, terrible and ridiculous decision by the Panamanian Government.  I live in Northern California.  We’ve been living with severe droughts for decades. In order to preserve the Economic core of California, Agriculture, Residential Water Rationing, SEVERE Water Rationing, has been a way of life, on and off for decades.  To cut water to what makes Panama Geopolitically relevant, what breathes life into its Economy, what makes it viable as a Nation, as a Democracy is utter insanity.  Rationing  water to citizen’s use is the only viable solution.   There is a solution available that takes advantage of Global Warming and existing technologies for Sea Water desalination used in the Gulf States and Israel.  Using the same pumping technologies for the first 2 chambers on both Atlantic and Pacific sides of the Panama Canal would use solely Sea Water to elevate ships in the first 2 locks.  By using existing desalination technologies, thereby leveraging the Sea Water of Rising Sea Water to refill the lake, drought pressures would be eliminated.    Clearly little thought has been given to this problem.
Propganda channel alert
Laughs in mexicos new train that is an alternative for the channel of panama.
What the hell! I didnt know that each ship passing through the Panama canal unloads so much fresh water in the ocean 😭😭😭 It sounds kind of like an enviromental disaster
Mexicos rail way is already up and running and a European company already announced to build a plant near the corridor
What is with this audio quality? Fucking hell.
Usa is the most corrupt country in the world.
They’ll engineer a storm and steer it towards Panama if they can
wtf is wrong with the audio quality in this video :S
A whee bit warmer then they can take the way between Grönland and Canada.
the mexico railways seems a good bet. of course climate change has been going on for billions of years, you never know what you are going to get. 1 big volcanic eruption could eliminate all of mans flea sized impact and put the world into a very cold spell.
Why wouldn't a neighboring country make a port on their Pacific and Atlantic sides so cargo could off load and travel to the opposite port via rail or truck and them be picked up by a new ship?
Corrections from the get going...  the Huthis are ONLY targeting ships of Israeli ownership and israili interest caring war related items to istail.. [the same the english and Americans do for israil] all other ships from allover the world of another flags have no problem sailing through the bab al-mandab straits and the red-sea... This became an international issue when we our ships  together with the english navy arrived at the strait  and started a war with an allied of Palestine...    ...scarring all the shipping companies to change their shipping agreements and their navigation routes to eu... ..and as a result the LNG and all fuel costs skyrocketed.. something that America wanted anyway..
Silly question, why can’t they syphon water directly from the ocean?
Why not build a reservoir to store the extra water in the first lock so it can let a new ship entering from the sea?
Something i haven't seen a good answer to: why are the locks drained into the ocean instead of being pumped back up into into the lake?
Shouldn't we all be dead from Climate Change by now? I remember fear-mongering back in the 80's and 90s.....
I’m surprised the Northwest Passage wasn’t mentioned. I believe more ships will be using that route as an alternative to the Panama Canal and the Drake Passage as arctic ice continues to melt and allow ships to traverse the region. This would be very beneficial to Canada and by extension the US as it’s not only cheaper and faster but also more secure since the US navy can patrol those waters
thanks lore, find your vids very informative and insightful, from Colorado
18:16 - BRAZIL MENTIONED
Why road and not rail for this trans-oceanic corridor is my question. Rail is more efficient, no?
Love your stuff, but your mic is a bit tiny
Buy oceanic corridor. What it looks like to me is someone along the way is going to put up some tariffs and then there's going to be a new reason for war in South America.
I really wanted to watch this but the audio is horrendous
It's almost like TRAINS WOULD BE GREAT.
I never thought the Panama Canal would die
The UN should build a desalination plant to supply lake Gaton with fresh water.
Which ships have Yemen been attacking? Is there a pattern, or is it random?
New Orleans can pump 45,000 cubic feet per second. Seal off the top with and pump in salt water run the locks on both sides on saltwater and keep your fresh water for people.
Pump water from ocean to fill first two chambers cutting water use from lakes by more then double.
Maybe naive question: Wouldn't it be possible to pump back the water to the upper stages of the water locks? The power needed would be huge (around 50 GJ or 14 MWh per passage, if I calculted correctly), but most of it could be replenished if the system is built like a pumped storage power plant. Maybe difficult, maybe expensive, but maybe an alternative to drying out or draining more drinking water?
In recording arts, gain staging is when the preamp gain is set in order to acheive a robust signal with optimal signal to noise ratio. i would know. i am the signal itself
Don't let little ships go through by themselves That's a waste. Panamax ships are the most efficient water usage. And of course Panama city's just going to have to suck a little canal water.
Why can’t they use sea water for the locks? Seems like this would solve the issue?
If you dredge the center of the lakes to make a passage worth traveling on. There will be much less evaporation because of the smaller lake. In addition the lower you can dig those lakes the closer you get to sea level.
How about.. Instead of lowering the first lock by letting the water out into the ocean, it's just pumped back into the second lock to raise the ship up to the third locks level... Its really not too complicated lol.
I think building the Suez and Panama canals were a big mistake.
Cloud seating. Make the rain.
I think we are listening and watching to an AI setup for a while now, which would explain the high frequency of long videos as well as the modulated voice in this video
Install giant screw pumps. If they can get all the rain out of New Orleans with screw pumps. You can keep the canal running. They just don't want to spend the money.
So why not use sea water? Just curious why fresh water has to be used
I find this hard to believe given Canal winchester just had 2 weeks of consistent rain.
Can`t they just pump drinking water from the lower gates as they lowers
Great stuff, keep them coming 👍
Man, poor foresight smdh
We should have kept the canal.
I vote cutting a saltwater canal straight across at sea level. Sure it’s expensive, but the most complicated part would just be concrete. Dump the excavated material on the side and let it be used by locals to develop their own land. Win-win.
1) why does it have to be freshwater and not seawater which is abundant? 2) why not recycle the freshwater by pumping it back up instead of letting it go to waste by flushing it to the ocean?
That’s Saudi Arabia my man Yemen is on the southern end of the peninsula. The Houthi’s control about Yemen on the southeastern side. 0:26
Why not just dig a 25 m deep canal at the narrowest point with the use of modern machinery replacing those water gates and lake would be protected for only public use?
the houthi are only targeting ships bound for Israel and will stop once there is a permanent ceasefire in Gaza it's disingenuous to not provide that context
Just wait a few years for sea levels to rise.  Problem solved.  ;)
Ok so how about we add some massive pumps that feed the locks with salt water
uh... why dont they just build trains in panama
It's at least good that China and India just got "farther away" from the rest of the world.
It would be economically feasible to pump seawater into the first few locks.  Gotta take less energy than sailing all the way around S. America.
This might be a totally crazy idea but what about a de-salination plant? Lake Gatun is fresh water so what if sea water were de-salinated and pumped into Lake Gatun, helping it to maintain its water level when drought occurs? I'm just wondering if it would in any way be a less expensive alternative to Panama's other options.
Someone needs to build a large pipeline with x large pumps from one side to the other and run the canal on sea water only.  Thx for sharing....
Raise prices, use excess money to have engineers come up with a solution.
Couldn’t they just use the ocean water
There is also a fifth option that wasn't mentioned in the coming years. As the climate continues to change and the earth warms up we will see an entirely new route become increasingly viable: The Northwest Passage.  The route through the Canadian Arctic is far shorter and much more politically stable than even the Panama Canal and this has been known for centuries.   The only problem with it is it's frozen solid most of the time but this is already changing. The Arctic route has already started seeing its first freight traffic and the Canadian government is investing in more icebreakers to help keep the passage ice-free until the climate changes to the point where it's fully open year-round.  This will place Canada in a position of enormous global political influence.
You forgot to mention why Yemen is blocking only certain ships and not all, besides being their territorial waters. And it's not a war its massacre sponsored by the USA, UK, Germany and France mostly. Also they hadn't killed anyone so far but the USA and UK felt it was their right as the imperialist sociopaths they are to bomb Yemen insted of doing the right thing and stop Israel from committing genocide against Palestine they illegally occupied since 1948. GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT. Cheers
Why don't they just fill the water from the ocean?
i thought this a palwolrd map
why not build huge water-storage tanks at each end to store most of the water-cycle for repeated reuse in the canal locks??
Lol based
The Mexican solution sounds most appealing to me. I love that they use trains, not lorries, and the Mexican people really deserve their own wealth, disconnecting from that awful bully that lives up north.
Of course , because of climate change. Good boy saying the right buzzword. Its just freaking weather !
"This doesn't work how other canals work" - goes on to describe exactly how canals normally work?
Wouldnt you want more displacment if you wanted to use less water?
So instead of using the fucking ocean watch to raise and lower the canal locks they use fresh water like idiots thus stripping a river or lake.... god people are fucking stupid. The ocean is literally right there.
I don’t understand why they can’t use ocean water for the entire process, or maybe it should have been dug deeper in the first place.
Please, buy new mic
Let the drug cartels control it... 😂 sory i meant democratic drug cartel southamerica.
Bro I know you are rolling in that YouTube money, get you a Shure SM7B microphone and a Focusrite 2i2. You’ll never have to worry about audio again.
Pump the water back into the lake…
Are you telling me they can't install a water pump to drain water from the lower lock back into the lake...
If they really think that offloading all the containers from a ship onto individual trucks to drive them across the entire continent to be then loaded back onto another ship will be competitive with the Panama Canal or even going around Cape Horn
why don't they just pump the water back up after they pump it down? lol.
Love how you give context to the western reaction to Houthi attacks but won’t give context to why the Houthi’s are blocking the canal lmao
Ah, I see. You’re going with the bullshit climate change narrative and not the fact that the canal is now run by mouth-breathing third worlders. This channel is utter shit.
Bro please invest in a shure sm7 B 😭🙏
Green energy has nothing to do with lithium. It's another extraction product that doesn't move the needle one way or the other. Green energy is about generation, not storage. And we're still not doing enough to clean up the grid in general, though some countries are doing it better than others.
Wrong wrong wrong. Simply raise the price of transit. More income from fewer ships. Duh. Unsubscribed
Bro what is this mic setup? You have 7m subs lol
All this desperation is a strong signal that the collapse of civilization is approaching fast.
Panama needs to reuse the lake water instead of dumping it out. What idiots. And all the other alt routes land based are going to be slower and require two ships from offloading back to the other coast onboarding those containers.  Mexico should just blast from one end to the other. Let sea water flow between and put up gates to charge ships for this extremely costly endeavor. I'm sure the US will give money and manpower to make it happen.
Death by thousand cuts 33:54 ❤ (if you know you know)
Hahahahaa haha, long before we were having problems with the Houties.  When they were only battling Saudia Arabia. I said that should America have major problems in Israel. The Suez Canal traffic would be threatened. Followed by the Panama Canal.  Reason; these damned Globalist. Between the UN and WEF Agenda 2030. It's necessary for them to wage siege Warfare against the western countries. Here in the USA we've had a problem of factories blowing up burning down with any business associated with the food industry. And of course a large portion of the world's food supplies is transported by the sea lanes which are dependant upon  both the Suez & Panama canals. Which further causes more supply chain problems. For the food industries. Which in the early 1980s made the transition to warehousing, which became just in time restocking. Which Eliminated the warehousing industry and the high inventory taxation rates.   It's all basic game theory in a global economy. What's in your best interest to meet your basic needs & necessities.  And too much time playing simm city. And once again for Humanity it's sad bad news we all lose to these Globalist Monsters. Who are determined to stave us into submission.  And who can explain this unusual anomaly to the El Nino & La Nina  weather cycles. Don't ask Alice, I'm sure HARPA knows. A World Wide Weather Modification program is being passed off as climate change to hide the facts! Welcome to Modern Warfare in the 21st Century
I may have missed this but can’t they use ocean water instead of fresh water to operate the locks? Isn’t there a way to not pollute their lake?
😂😂😂  Dig it level with the other end, sea level to sea level. 😂😂😂 Wide enough to never have locks and uses sea water. Idiots😂😂😂😂
why trucks for the bi-oceanic corridor not trains... Trains are more efficient, need less drivers and i am sure can be loaded/unloaded better automatical and faster.
Why not just add a rail in Panama too?
Putin is funding the Houthi's to take the money out of Ukraine
Not to mention that the drake passage is very dangerous
I sometimes use x2 in channels that speak too slow... here I need a x0.5
It's kind of insane they built a road versus a railroad.
Tell us why the Houthi’s are bombing ships
I mean it shouldn’t be too hard to build a system to reuse the water in the lochs. It’d be expensive and probably shut the lochs down for a bit but that would drastically reduce the amount of water needed
Okay hear me out I got a real simple solution to this problem that should have been thought of 20 years ago instead of dumping this water into the ocean just clean and pump it back into the lake problem solved I've been watching this video for 13 minutes and 20 seconds and I've already figured out how to solve the problem it's not complicated
US and Britain killing people in the middle east again. Someone set History on Loop.
...so just develop a system to pump the water back into the canal? FFS, how hard can this be?
Very informative ty
I can’t be the only one thinking that pumping the freshwater in the bottom lock out And back into the lake might be an option? Yes, it would be an investment and also energy intensive, but surely fairly similar to getting more freshwater from other means, no?
Canada and Russia playing the slow game and just waiting for ice to melt and trade will just go over the top of the world
The thing I don’t get is why transporting goods from east America to Japan and west Canada to Europe cant the government just switch sides? If that were to happen there wouldn’t be any use for the panama canal.
CALLING TRUMP
Didn't the new Panamax locks expansion include reservoirs to catch and reuse water instead of dumping it into the ocean? Shouldn't this solve the water shortage problem?
Couldn’t they just use sea water to flood the locks? Pump it in and pump it out. Just seems like a waste of a finite resource when a virtually endless supply ocean water is available. If not sea water, why not have reservoirs where the water can be reused as much as possible. Idk, i just feel like there is a better solution.
You somehow raped my ears
The microphone…
I know its obviously easier said than done but why don't they just make a 2nd salt water Chanel that's at sea level so no fresh water is lost?
Looks like the drought is a good time to clean the lake
Can you do a video about East Africa Geopolitics,Ethopia,Somalia, Kenya.
Reduce your emphasis, it drops value and raises boredom
Just increase the price 100x and import drinking water.
Switch to salt water in the locks?
I think that in this situation will be acceptable to actually pump water from ocean to chambers and only use lake water in last stage.
Give them a chance to clean up some of that trash...    STOP SENDING PLASTICS TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES
I don’t understand why if they are getting BILLIONS from this system, that they are too cheap to build pressurised water storage to pump into INSTEAD of just dumping it into the F’ing ocean?? How stupid are they?
0:35 wow, the houthi war is still going on? those are the people that bombed the us navy ship and started the war on terror/war against the taliban in afghanistan and led to the iraq war... this was like in 2000 or something b4 the 9/11 attacks happened even if i recall correctly and it was supposed to be like 6 weeks or 6 months and they were supposedly a small faction going against the legitimate yemeni government and it was a huge black eye on yemen because they were a historical ally supposedly from back to the 1991 gulf war or somethign and even prior to that or something...   yemen oman and the uae were supposed to be our allies against the religious fanatics in the middle east and the piracy in and around somalia/ethiopia.   yet apparently we are still fighting this small rebel faction 24 years later? and it seems the area they control of yemen has actually increased/gotten bigger by the controlled area shown on this map?  argh  and it says the air strikes were done alongside britain...yet another cluster**** the british got us dragged into..just great.
there actually very simple solutions to this 1- isolate the fresh lack from the rout of the ships so it doesn't get effected by step 2 2- use pumps to fill the doors (chanal) with sea water
Fun fact: lithium will become *less* necessary in the future. There are tons of alternative chemistries, including sodium ion which is cheaper and safer.
is the audio bad on this video or is it just me?
I gotta stop like a minute in, the mic is just painful.
They’ll have to invest BIG TIME on pipes and pumps to return the water to the lake.    That would be the smart thing to do.  But, humans…
This seems like a problem that could be solved by better water management. It seems silly to say that the issue is a drought when you have oceans of water on either side of the canal. With plenty of water on either side of the canal, the issue shifts from being a shortage of water to being a surplus of salt. If you could devise a method for moving a ship from a tank of salt water to a tank of fresh water and back, using as little fresh water as possible, you could potentially reduce the amount of fresh water used by the system to a point where mitigating the lost fresh water with desalination becomes feasible. There is so much commerce that travels (or could potentially travel) through the canal that it seems like there should be enough financial incentive to bring all sorts of solutions to the table. We should be trying to decide which solution would be most beneficial rather than throwing our arms up in the air and blaming climate change (that's not to say climate change isn't to blame, only that blaming climate change doesn't solve the problem).
Free palastine
I wonder how much it would cost to retrofit the canal to pump water back up into the lake instead of just letting it flow into the ocean.
This problem could be solved with power generation. Instead of expending fresh water to fill the locks, pump sea water. The canal itself may need to induce a small effluent current to prevent salt water from contaminating the lake, but that would be peanuts compared to what they're using now.
The Panama Canal can no longer function properly and may continue in this failed state far into the future. The American military are hobbled. American exports devastated, putting the countrys finances in dire straights. All because of nature itself. Well what to do about it. Clearly the Americans have to declare war on god himself. Get a couple of carrier groups out there to show god who is boss. It has always worked in the past. Look how well it is going in the Suez canal, the Houthis are shit scared. Ah. However this time there might be a tiny problem. God might have been sending a message. Back to drawing board I guess.
Ya'll realize that canal is man made? I mean you can always fix it. The mentality of people now is really pathetic how they are talking about this like it's the sky falling. People dug this out many years ago and nature is not static.
Just spit it out, saying the same thing over and over.
Surely instead of pumping the sea level lock out to the sea repump it back to the lock😮
why nobody try to connect the us rivers?
Why don’t they just build pipes to pump the excess water back into the lake??
i don't  get it, why dont the make a buffer chamber so save the water instead of dumping it into the ocean? can someone explain?
Дякую за цікавий сюжет!
22:00 They should have chosen trains instead of a truck highway.... way more cargo/way more efficient to operate. carry entire containers and a shit ton of them back and forth.
Trump: I will build a big beautiful canal across the border and make Panama pay for it
You mean the Dutch can pump water out of their whole country but the US can't pump the water back to the lake?
Cant you just build a water holding point insted of pumping the water in the ocean?
Dig the canal deeper, duhhh
North west passage?
Why not have storing tanks for those bottom-level loches so the fresh water is pumped into tanks rather than released to the ocean?  Then, when ship is in the loch, refill from the tank rather than the loch above?
Ezekiel 27
So we have 1% fresh water on earth and they go ahead and dump it into the ocean, wtf bro
Thank you, Jimmy Carter.
You have to replace your microphone.
You need a compressor/limiter on your mic/daw/mixer...your voice is distorting.
Pretty simple fix, the Yemenis will stop attacking ISRAELI bound ship when the Israeli occupational genocide of Palestine ends. The USA and its prosperity guardian attacks on Yemen are illegal and immoral
The Mexican revolution threw the country in to chaos for decades... you mean that's still on going...
“Climate change” isn’t real. It’s called “the weather” and the idea that it would stay consistent or that everything rise or drop in temperature is somehow always mankind’s fault and is always a bad thing shows how moral bankrupt people who believe in it are.
😂🤣😂 Iam laughing when it comes to the military conflict between the US & PRC. I dont know why some people are so horny for that one. Sorry but it will not happen. The consequences are just to gigantic and unpredictable and the gains so small that China simply wont do it. No matter how horny the Republicans are to have that one. Two nuclear armed countries, what could go wrong, right?   For something like that to be a probable scenario, you need someone like Putin at the helm of the Chinese state ship. Only then do we need to dread this but right now and for the foreseeable future, the red coated dictatorship is occupied with domestic stuff. And having Taiwan is also useful for China, perfect distraction in the news. Like when the Republicans are telling their voting base that the US is getting "invaded" via the Southern Border by immigrants. Anyway ...
BIGGEST QUESTION??? WHY DONT THEY JUST PUMP WATER FROM THE SEA FOR THE LIFTS IN PANAMA
Climate change…. Natural and normal
Fun fact, the Suez Canal being closed was in response to Saudi Arabia, the US and the UK continuously bombing Yemen. Attacking the Canal was not a first strike, but a retaliation.
Thats just bad engineering and a waste of water.  Why not reuse the spent water for the locks, drain it into a holding tank instead of releasing it into the ocean?
The canal authorities are aware of this, and also use "cross-filling" to move water from one gate to another to reduce water usage, quoting equivalent to 6 transits per day.  This model should be considered for extension to further reduce water usage.
Cant they just construct some building to keep the water in or move it back to lake Gatún through pipes?
"Opportunity in Panama presented itself"? The US backed the Panamanian  rebellion to have Panama become a separate country from Columbia and put a US friendly leader in power in order to build and have control of the canal. US Navy warships were stationed there, to threaten Columbia. This type of thing was done throughout Central and South America. Many authoritian dictators came to power due to US influence, weapons, money, etc because  these leaders were pro US, anti "communism". Not actually communism, just not nationalizing resources and allowing US companies to come in to make all the profits.
Mexico can't control its drug Cartels . The railway will fail because of the drug Cartels.  Mexico could be a very rich nation.
The Nicaragua Canal was first scrapped because the proponents of the Panama Canal convinced Congress that there was an active volcano constantly erupting there
Just for grins - I did some googling.  The largest oil pipeline pumps I could find on a quick online search can move 40,000 barrels per day and cost $1,000,000. To move 52 Million gallons is about 1 million barrels - so  25 such pumps and 25 12" diameter pipes to send water from the bottom lock back up to lake level at the top rather than releasing it into the ocean would be sufficient to pass one ship per day.   To do one ship per hour - would require an alarming 600 of these pumps working at once(!!)- about what a typical long oil pipeline requires - at a cost of $600 million - which is peanuts.  Doing that would eliminate 100% of the water requirement from the lakes.   We don't need to eliminate 100% - so it seems like 50% would be more than enough.  So 300 large pumps and a lot of large diameter pipes probably isn't a whole lot of money to save the canal.   Build a big solar farm next door...solves the energy cost of doing it.   For about a billion dollars - you'd be good to go.   Why is something like this not being considered?
Why don't they pump the water back up so less is lost to the ocean?
dang I never realized operating one of those canals meant flushing millions of gallons of good freshwater each transit
Why they are using sweet water? and not sea water?!
Your analysis that they would need to prioritize lighter ships to use less water is wrong.  It would require the same amount of water to lift or lower a heavy ship as a light one.  Therefore, it would be more advantageous to prioritize heavier ships than lighter ones.
...Why aren't panama just expanding the roads they already have going from coast to coast for trucking?
The easiest way to address climate change is to de-indistrialize the 3rd world. No one causes more pollution
And we're told to switch off the faucet when brushing our teeth to save water... pissing against the wind, really
how to pass red sea savely: DONT SUPPORT ISRAEL MILITARY
CORRECTION: The Houthis aren't attacking merchant ships. They're attacking ships carrying supplies to Apartheid Israel.
I know Colombia really well. Zero percent chance that railway becomes viable in the next two decades.
Why is the bi-oceanic corridor not a cargo train line? Doing everything by truck seems inefficient
Instead of letting fresh water into the sea. They should filter the water and use the water consumption.
Just pump the water back up from the first gate😂
Wait a second wouldn't a heavier ship ship use less water because of displacement. It would sit lower in the water causing the water level to rise higher.
how dont bros take the water from the sea? or use water of gate 2 do fill gate 3 instead of opposite? they dont want to mix sea water with the lake?
panama could solve it's problem if they don't pump out the water into the ocean, simple as that. pump it back into the lake.
Uhh... Why don't they just pump salt water instead of fresh water into the locks..?  Edit: oh duh, it'd contaminate the lake with tons of salt water. Maybe they could build a barrier through the lake to make a salt water shipping lane and the fresh water reservoir. Maybe they could lower the water level on the shipping lane and only need one or two locks.
Why can't they just pump the "fresh water" from the first and last gate into a water treatment plant that could then send the water to the citizens instead of pumping it into the sea? 🥱😏
What if they built some more lakes where they could dump the water and them re pump it again as if it was a close circuit? In theory they would only have to change the pipes and create some extra lakes 😅
i suggest make the ships smaller? to have a better mobility rather trying to move big ships across a small canal
So how hard is it to pump water in and out? Granted you'd need a power station to run it but how much water is pumped for energy storage? Isn't it the same?
If the elevation is "only" 26m, why not just dig a sea-level canal through Panama, or if theres a narrower point in Central America? Can the oceans mix without consequence? Or is the dig too big?
The El Nino / La Nina cycles are natural and the only difference is this one is more pronounced, just like the LA Nina was before it. This will be temporary as the weather cycles back and forth. Blaming everything on "climate change" is just stupid as the geological timescales are vastly different than the mere short lifespans of human beings.
I cant tell if its just my speakers or is his audio levels a bit too high for the voiceover track?
Why don't they just pump the water used for the locks into a reservoir instead of dumping it into the ocean?
Why does panama canal not just build a train system instead?
Nicaragua is one of the most corrupt countries in the world?!  No problem!  All they have to do is say they hate Russia and support Israel’s genocide against Palestinians and the US will give them all the weapons and money they need
Horrendous effort.
If push comes to shove, why not have a desalinization plant?
If Panama keeps acting up like this and continues to choose to supply its population with drinking water instead of facilitating worldwide maritime trade, then I'd reckon they'll be getting another visit from the Freedom police real soon.
Ok, stupid question... Can't they pump the displaced water back into the lake?
It's a wonderful and informative video about the Panama 🇵🇦 channel...
LOL, the guy skipped over the part where the US faked a war and too Panama, which didn't exist, from Columbia.
This is why it's important to buy as much local when possible
Am I the only one who sang “Panamaniacs” when he said Panamanian?
Is it just me or I don't understand why they can't just design a different pumping system and use ocean water instead sure it will cost money and you will need quite a number of pumping stations but surely to protect 4 billion dollars and the global shipping system it's well worth
This may sound dumb, but not considering money and energy problems could they pump the waters back up so the oceans can help keeping the levels of the locks?
mics kinda choppy alot of feed back   allmost hurts my ears and i turned it way down
Desalination domes. Low energy, nature driven already developed technology
Just dig through the whole country instead of the current stair system, problem solved permanently. Will it be expensive? yes.. but is it worth it.. probably.
There are four alternatives mentioned in this video, three involving roads and rails. None mention the possibility of supplementing the Panama canal with a route across Costa Rica. Only the route across Nicaragua involves another canal, and this is frought with problems. Seems like you didn't really pay attention to details of the video.
Degree in yapinology
Couldn’t they build a tank for the water to drain into. So the fresh water drains into that rather than the sea; you can drain the saltwater back into the sea thus preserving the water
Why not use sea water?
I stad with the HOUTHIES
Why not buildrail insteadof inefficient highways?
I visited Panama a few years ago and got to see the canal in action.  Its an incredible engineering feat.  I love Panama and the people.  I wish it the best of luck.
Why don’t they use salt water from the ocean instead?
Doesn’t work like other canals… Explains how it works like every canal in the U.K.
actually terrible video. way to fast editing. terrible mic. its either peaking or terrible compressed. bad mic. and very hard to listen to if not dialed down do 0.5x speed. what is wrong
welcome to YouTube. this is a great first video
please get a mic
Or simply quit shipping so much stuff thats not needed and we get back to making our own things in our countries
because of course they have to use fresh water and waste it into the ocean for every single ship.  LOL....my god we are retarded. Do we have to constantly kick ourselves in the dick or can we for once....just once use our brains?  Nah, this is more fun.
Did your mic break? This is painful to listen to.
I’ve got one problem with the bi-oceainc corridor, trucks for transportation would be a CO2 powerhouse if the corridor would be an alternative to the Panama Canal. I believe that first of all it will be almost impossible for them to build that road the right way, just because the work required to cross the Andes or to make a tunnel through it is too much and too costly, it would be maybe even more challenging that what Switzerland did with the Gottard Gallery and that too a lot of time to build and an amount of money that probably Chile Bolivia and Argentina do not possess or want to invest on. Plus it may be better on train than trucks, for the environment, for the speed and for the capacity of the train itself.
In alot of videos on YouTube I end up turning the speed up on the video. This might be the first video I considered turning down the speed. I live in upstate New York too. We speak pretty fast naturally but he went a little crazy on this one
Panama needs to build several desalination plants at both ends of the canal. A medium size MGD SWRO plant would cost about $80 million dollars each. You could build 10 for less than a billion dollars total. Or 4-5 big desalination plants for around 1.5 billion total. They can then provide their citizens drinking water and replenish the lakes and the canal. Problem solved. I mean, there is an ocean on each size of the canal right?
23:17 why trucks and not a high speed transport bullet train
Its Disney Fastpass all over again...
It's fine bacause the future is transport by zeppelins anyway.
“The war in the Middle East will eventually come to an end” ye right 😂
Sounds like the Nicaragua canal should have been taken more seriously
Genuine question: Why can't they pump the water from the first gate back into Lake Gatun so no water gets lost?
the ai voice sounds awful man, even normies are saying your “mic” is trash
Why can't they pump water from the ocean itself for repleneshing the canal sluices?
interesting that they wouldn't just make a seawater bridge and call it a day like the Suez. But the reddit thread was fulfilling there.
Waisting Drinking water on such a scale is probably not such a bright idea...but it seems that those decision´s already have been made by reckless politician´s  as always.
cant they start building a second canal right next to it where the water from the exiting gate raises the water in the entering gate and so they don't need to waste so much fresh water and avoid this whole crisis but i guess it would take 10 years to dig a new one so its too late now
I think they need to do desalination.
U lost me blaming climate change lol
Thanks. This is getting little to no attention.
The canal's diagram is wrong -  you forgot to close the locks behind!
Why can't they use salt water? Kills the pumps?
Could have gotten to the point WAY quicker. Too wordy! Just giving some feedback.
This seem like a maintenance problem. That could be fixed. They may have to shut down the canal when the work are done.
Use toll dollars to desalinate and refill it with sea water. Easier said than done but still.
6. a Panama-Rail-Connection
The more a ship displaces means the less water is moved, because its filled with ship instead of just wasted water.
Can't they just use the seawater to fill the locks? it might take a while for the levels in the lock to change but it is better than using drink water
How About the Idea of  .... 😊 !! Ta Da : Creating Desalization water treatment plants which depending on time , and money from  x  Countries? Could fix / help replenish Panama's fresh water lake shortage problem 😢? As of 2024 , the Countries that uses this system the most Are. Yes the USA , Saudi Arabia, Isreal, and India?  Let's ask these countries  / people for their advice.  I have several other ideas also to help this very important , and most marvelous ever world engineering creations to continue operations properly 😊 . Cheers 🍻 G
Rare earth batteries are “green energy”?  WTF?  You libs are the biggest dopes ever!
Canales only require 1 ship where as rail roads across Central and South America would require 2 coordinated ships which adds additional challenge and cost.
For you to say the houthis are iran backed and mention nothing about only targeting Israeli ship or ships heading there or the fact they haven’t killed anyone lets me know within the first twenty seconds im watching propaganda and not journalism 🙄
Get rid of the locks.  Aren't humans good at blowing sh*t up?  Deploy a bunch of old, expired ordinance in there and make a true canal between the two oceans.
And all of this BCS OF ISRAEL.
Can't the 1st 2 locks be filled with pumped sea water?
Honestly sounds like an infrastructure problem. Just build more water infrastructure and the problem is solved.
Why not also build a parallel railroad track to the Bi-Oceanic highway? Trains could haul freight far more efficiently than the highway.
why don't they just creat a railway in Panama? Seems to me like this would be the easiest option
Why do they build the bi-oceanic corridor with trucks and not with trains? they are so much better for transporting large amounts of goods...
The country of Panama and the US are currently working on a project to repair and dredge the canal thats projected to take about 6 yrs to accomplish. Besides the suez canal its the most important waterway in the world being a trip around the tip of South America would double costs to transport not to mention the terrible weather and sailing conditions at the cape.  The Panama canal won't just be abandoned or Panama will be hit economically hard and cost on goods from fruit to blue jeans will double if not more.
Interesting video.  I remember back in high school (1980) in history class discussing alternate routes to the Panama canal.  My personal view though is that the world is too dependent on global trade.
Don’t tell me this is another rushed video just like your last video about the Balkans? You have a lot of information rushed into one video speaking too quick. You can do 2 videos on the same subject.. Your first videos were never rushed… Why you rushing them? You a good YouTuber!!! It is like it’s becoming a chore and not something you enjoy doing. Mate come on…
Lol, RLL with 7.3 million subscribers is saving for a downpayment on a house by using Rocket money to cancel his unwanted subscriptions. I repeat, lol. 😅
So annoying when he's saying the water is getting pumped. The reason why it's made like it is, is to avoid to pump water overall.
It is just me or transporting cargo to Europe form east cost of US and to Asia from west coast would solve the problem. I believe east-west railways already exist in US.
Why don't they just pump sea water of which there are infinite amounts of water.
Re upload this when you fix mic it’s so unlistenable I stopped 52 seconds in
it's not a big problem for Panama to lose 6,5% of its GDP (4:07) in favor of saved fresh water and ecosystem compared to undeveloped countries for which this kind of project (canal) would propel them to a brighter future. Don't be greedy Panama - share your wealth you already had a head start in this monopoly
US terrorism around the world need to stop! Due time for Americans to start voting for non-psychopaths in elections.
Climate change bs
Lithium is not oil. Most of the world's lithium is in the ocean.
After 100 years, I believe humanity is able to build another canal in Panama. This time wider, deeper and use of seawater instead of fresh water needed for Panamanians and wild life. Takes lots money but USA may fund this mega project in order to have some rights for next 99 years.
average real life lore video: to fully understand this topic, we have to go back to Christopher Columbus and him discovering the Americas 💀💀💀💀💀💀😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I blame the Roman. Empire for the road not being great.
It’s coming boys
They could just dump the water into a resevoir instead of the ocean so the water is not lost.
You never mentioned the fifth alternative.  A sea level canal in Panama that needs no water reservoirs but lots more excavation.
Pump in seawater?
the bi-oceanic corridor is a security nightmare and will get hijacked everyday
Still yet two options Northern Western  passage and Northern  Eastern.
could they try diverting the water that would normally be dumped into the ocean and use it for drinking water instead?
Make a reservoir near the first lock on either side.  Instead of dumping fresh water into the ocean, pump it into there.  Continually pump water from these reservoirs into Gatun.    Ta da, I fixed the system for maybe a few hundred dollars worth of electricity per ship, on the outiside.  "5 million gallons" sounds way scarier than "15 acre feet."
One wonders how long the Ortegas will control (degrade, steal from) the once noble country of Nicaragua. Sad that one corrupt family can control a country for so long. There are many precedents in history, unfortunately.  Really solid video once again. Globalization of trade is always such a boon in games like Civilization. What they never (or rarely) model is the disruption it can cause in people’s lives, damage to the environment, and increased strategic risk as countries controlling vital infrastructure (such as canals) become subject to the greed of nearby countries or create internal conflicts—perhaps even attract the attention of terrorist networks. I think globalization is inevitable, but it’s a far more complex affair than simply lessening trade barriers and creating geographic access.
What is wrong with your microphone? I cant watch this because it sounds like you are recording 20 feet behind the mic :( Its annoying
don't reinvent the wheel or anything. I can tell you were not good at science since you are pretty blind to engineering solutions to an engineering problem.  Need fresh water for the people? Get fresh water.  increase/improve/modernize water  purification. Using too much freshwater in the lochs? supplement with seawater. pump the sea back up to the lock. If you are saying the world is changing, these solutions are small, especially when I am only talking about distilling units, pumps, and thorium reactors.
@18:20 Why trucks? wouldn't it be much cheaper to use railways? @33:00 I'm a little confused. Sure, using the lake water to raise the ships is cheap and doesn't need energy, but couldn't they just use a tank and pump water in and out of it as needed? That way they use the same water again and again, and have no need to flush any of it away into the ocean, ruining it.
4:20 The legend says persons instead of people
A kg of manderines costs about 10ct to deliver from California to Bavaria. And those are actually more difficult to deliver than most goods. Well if their price raises be 2 CT I'll survive.
Mexican president: "We are going to build a canal and USA will pay for it"
War will come to an end in the Middle East  😂😂😂😂😂 The line everyone is saying for the past 40 years
A key trade route across South America - what could possibly go wrong..
Could they evan build a system to bring sea water rather than fresh water or desalination watwr to stop ecological disasters which the desalination unit would be a mega project but wouldnt it help save fresh water through the canel? Like i said would be a mega project in its self but wouldnt it save fresh water from the lakes or possibly create extra frsh water for more fresh water for the people possibly creating more revenue in long-term?
How about pumping the water into reservoirs and use the same water to level on stages? Yes it will cost more money, but it can be factored in the passing fair fee.
Something strange with the audio here, cadence also different
Jimmy Carter is the traitor who gave the canal for free.
Rerecord your voiceover please
bs story. The panama canal is not going away soon, which is good. Building a funny video about a bunch of corrupt governments constructing huge infrastructure to compete with the panama canal is just that, a video. Making up a story about the fall of the canal because of "climate change" from the events of one year it's just that, a story
go back 2 years and the narration's quality is waaaay better in every way...
now hear me out, what if usa does their own ultra rail network? :)
Im sure the shitty engineering they did expanding it played as big a role in its issues as climate change. Its 2024 there's no need to just dump 52 million gallons of water each transit. Huge pumps exist that can put it back in the lake.
Explains why my gamersupps cup hasn't arrived yet 😂
Wouldn't it be more logical to just unload the Atlantic ships at the ports of Galveston, New Orleans and Savannah and transfer the freight on the existing US rail network to the ports of Los Angeles and San Francisco to continue it's journey onto the Pacific than any of these proposed alternatives?
You had to let it go 5 minutes until you made the point?
This was bound to happen when such a crucial piece of infrastructure relies on nature.
Why would they go with trucks instead of trains?  Trains are far more efficient.
why on earth is the bi-oceanic corridor not a train
Good. Maybe we can stop shipping things halfway around the globe and produce them locally
Why dont they just pump water from third chamber back to lake
They just need to Flow back the 1st reservoire water into the lake instead of the sea ! Easy Peasy
The panama is still usable guys the US gotta pay up
Dude wtf is wrong with your audio. Unwatchable
You are STRESSFUL AF TO LISTEN TO.
What a waste of freshwater.
I Blame The Cavemen. They must have did some some serious global warming to end the last ice age. Not sure who to blame for ending the other ice ages before that but we need to find out. So, they don't do it again.
The question is: Where can Panama, situated between two oceans, find water for the locks?   Panama is surrounded by salt water, so maybe they are afraid of having some salt water in the canal?
Your view on the Lithium Triangel seems very american. Many nations see their future in trains instrad of Lithium powered cars, which have many flaws in comparison to trains
Great video but did you sell your expensive mic and bought a $13,99 one?
Cant they just use sea water instead of destroying lake and river ecosystems?
while it will require a lot of energy, but would it not be possible to pump water back instead of releasing it into the sea?  surely this would be cheaper and easier to implement than desalination planst?
The last time the climate didn't change on Earth was.... never.
Climate change is nothing but a convenient excuse for all kinds of mismanagent..
why trucks? why not cargo train
Panama couldn’t maintain the canal. Another Great decision by Carter
Holy hell what happened to the sound on this channel
desalinisation plants?
At lake Gatun the water does not need to be emptied out into the ocean. They could use some kind of a reservoir. They just choose to empty it into the ocean, because I guess it was easier.
Here is how I rank videos:  - Amateur - Professional - World Class - Real Life Lore  Your videos stand alone.  Amazing!
@5:09 “the war in the Middle East will eventually end” 🤡
if the united states needs to get warships through that canal for a military operation there getting through, no questions asked
America again being stupid and not realising the potential of using ship to rail cargo points to achieve the same transit, but on land. You have both coasts use them. Money going to waste.
Globalization is becoming a growing disaster. Country's have to begin relying on themselves, and not "free trade".
You've got to start saying decimals properly. Please stop saying "four point thirty two". I know it's just a voice actor and and someone else is writing but how does that make it through
@6:55 instead of emptying the freshwater into the ocean, why not into a battery or reservoir that then goes back into the lake?
is your microphone broken?
Their solution is kind of dumb. They can always create a water pump from both oceans to supply the canal and release the same water in any of the oceans Pacific and Atlantic respectively to the direction of ships movements.
STOP SATURATING YOUR MIC, IT’S REALLY HARD TO LISTEN TO, THX
may be a stupid question, the water lost each time is there no way to pump it back upto the top level?
please inforom yourself better instead of perpetuating the climate hoax. Start researching the benefifts of elevated co2.
Why do they not pump water from the ocean?
I thought that a heavier ship with increased displacement would use less water in a lock.
Planet Earth is in both climate and manmade ciaos 🤔😔😢
how in the fuck can someone make such a simple video 36 minutes
is the voice now an AI? something been off with the resent vidoes
Why dont they just dig the mountain to make it a normal Canal ?
RealLifeLore: "The end of the world is approaching from multiple directions! There are 5 separate World War III's happening right now! There is no escape!!!!" *casual, jazzy lo-fi beat playing in the background*
This might be a dumb question and I'm sure they've thought of this and there's a very good answer to it but why can't they just use sea water?
so why not just pump sea water into the lake and set up desalination plants for drinking water..? I know that’s probably really expensive but I don’t really see an alternative here..?
The water must be reused. In the new  portion of the canal the water is reused
Bro recorded this with his earbuds.
TBH, the USA should have a better inland transportation infrastructure. I know, that truck drivers have a huge workload for almost no compensation, but trains could be a solution for goods transportation. However, this doesn't solve the relocation of ships. But I think this is a really good thing for globalisation, as trading could not just happen in the Northern hemisphere between rich countries, helping them get more money. The extra fuel usage though could make the climate change worse, especially to developing countries. Pumping seawater into the gates (not the lake) should also solve the problem to an extent as water flows outwards and not into the lake.😅
The audio quality is so bad today.
Sounds like you're talking inside a pipe, speeding up, and down. Ditch the AI.
The solution is to build a railroad from China to North America!
Flying Whales’ airships could be part of South American logistics
There is a proposal to continue the concrete canal across the lake and widen the canal. There by being able to fill the canal with salt water instead of fresh water. The whole project could be financed by the countries that depend on the canal. Climate change is now allowing shipping to pass through the Artic Ocean.
The audio is unlistenable. Re-upload
Could be absolutely tripping here but I swear I watched a video two days ago with the exact same title!! It's like these content creators have 0% creativity and just want to earn a few bucks. Surely not though right 😅
Originally, this was supposed to be a sea-level canal. There’s no problem here TNT cannot fix.
At 17:22, where is the rope coming from??
Why is this voice irritating my ear drums 😢
5 minutes of information to start with that has nothing to do with the subject header. Gave up.
Thank you for using the Metric System!
Why do they rely exclusively on roads instead of rails in South America? Goods in particular can be transported much more effectively by train than by truck.
Sushi
Why not pump the water back instead of letting it into the ocean.... It cost more money for the pumps yes but it would reduce the amount of water
This seems like such a well researched and clearly explained video. Really interesting. Subscribed.
can't they just make it deeper by 26 meters?
why not just use WEST COAST?! you have port of seattle, and port of los angeles, there?! wht not just fucking use that? why must through panama canal, it's too far away and costly!!!
My ears are bleeding. Please fix audio!
9:55 That looks like a good opportunity to clean the shoreline from all the trash with excavators.
With the icebergs melting,  going over the Arctic could be an option.
Why not simply pumping the water back to the next sluice and reuse the water instead of draining it into the ocean?
The fall of the west has begin.
So use sea water.
I didn't see much talking about the Northwest Passage.  It is an alternative that need to be explored more.
you should've also note that Houthis only attacked "West" affiliated  cargo ship because of the whole Israel fiasco. Asian ship can go safely
Can’t they just reuse the fresh water instead of pumping it into the ocean?
They can use sea water for filling pools or water that is used for first pool can be flushed in lake instead of sea
It just seems stupid that they drain the loch into the ocean rather than pumping it back into the lake… even if they didn’t design it that way with climate change in mind isn’t it worth retrofitting it?
The answer is simple but initially costly. You build a ENTRANCE lock. at sea level. One that collects the fresh water and pumps it back up after running it through a desalinization system and make the whole system a closed loop. then other than from normal evaporation you don't lose most of those millions of gallons of fresh water and you don't pump too much salt into an environment not meant to have much salinity.
Can we stop with this Houthi Rebels stuff, and just call them the Yemen govement, it is the country now, they run it.
Am I missing something here, or can they not just use sea water in the canal? If they've not had the rainfall, thats where the water is!
The video was fine until you mentioned Climate Change. After that it's not worth watching. Worst drought in history? Since panama is millions of years old and records are only from the 1950s, I call complete junk science. Sorry, what a joke.
There is NO war in Yemen 🇾🇪 it’s only an issue about people the Yemen wanting to stop people of Palestine 🇵🇸 been murdered by the Zionist regime supported by the same bombs 💣 that Western countries using on this poorest country in the Middle East. So, stop this genocide madness and then this problem just goes away!
You got El Nino and La Nina mixed up. La Nina is the one that makes Australia wet and south America dry.
cant they just make one side colcest to the sea use sea water instead of fresh just seems stupid to me.
That's a fatal flaw
Here's an idea,  use the ocean water for the locks. It might cause more damage to the system but with the money they are receiving for a ship to get through, they could replace parts when needed.
Imagine spending all that time generating nice graphics only to use THAT microphone. Jeez dude my ears are bleeding. Get yourself a microphone ASAP. With such a big audience, you kind of owe it to them to pay attention to that aspect or they'll leave.
Your opinoins on climate change are kind of retarded. 50 years is not enough data to determine what a normal pattern is.
The Houthis are right
Seriously? How hard can it be to install pumps? Instead of emptying the water into the ocean, just pump it back to lake Gatun if you need to. OMG.
Big pump goes brrrr?
Huh and here I was thinking that the Houthis were protesting the palestinian genocide.
NEVER GIVE UP. HEY WHAT ABOUT THE SEA WATER. U.S. SEE THE DUTCH FOR EXPERTISE😊❤😊
Why build a transcontinental highway, when a train line would be orders of magnitute more effective?
Get Real. Nicaragua is the ONLY option. That a Chinese pop-up billionaire failed at it is not a death-knell. If the US gets involved, Nicaragua will happen, and happen quickly, efficiently, and correctly.
Captain: hey ya'll how longs the wait? Other Captain: 15 days. Captain: How long ya'll been waiting? Other Captain: 5 days already. Captain: alright thanks mate, fuck this going the long way.

I think your microphone is dying too
The Columbia Choo Choo train idea is a childish conception. Not a chance in a million it happens.
Nice try RealLifeLore but I'm going to get more than 2 hours of sleep tonight!
BECAUSE THE ENTIRE BIDEN ADMIN IS WORTHLESS.
The Paraguay option sounds like a total pipedream that cannot be financially viable for transporting world goods. It's a billion miles of truck roads that is supposed to replace transport over water. Not a chance of being a reality.
So glad we gave it back. What a good idea
I would die if I Only had 905 million dollars
Inflation is recurring faster that when I was a teenager in my room.
A fact not mentioned is the recent opening of parallel wider locks on the Panama Canal, thereby increasing capacity significantly, and consequently using a lot more fresh water.
That Tehuantepec isthmus has a lot of potential for putting in a sea-level canal, too. It doesn't get too much above sea level for what modern machinery and explosives can shift, and with it running through at sea level it would be drought-proof. A smart government would use the revenue from the railroad to fund the construction. You can move freight a lot more efficiently on a train than on trucks, but big ships are orders of magnitude more efficient again.
What happened to your mic?
Cant they use sea water instead of the lake water for the canal
So we shouldn't have given the canal to Panama.
Super video
Yuo*
Could a decent freight railway across the USA solve these problems?
I wonder is farming rain would work. I live in panama and sometime hou see plenty of clouds that never become rain during these days
at 11:08, in the video you talked about how moving 1 ship through the canal uses the same amount of water as “half a million panamanians do in a day”. when reading the statistic on screen it shows “2.25 million panamanians in a day”. i was wondering if there was possible any clarification for that? im sorry im not trying to be rude or anything i love your videos your channel has been my favourite one especially lately! thank you!
Funny it looks like give up with helping Ukraine will be able to fund all these investments :D
What a mess ...
I think it’s a first to hear a “the size of Austria” as a measurement of scale 😂
1, Why doesn't Panama just build pumps directly from the Ocean to fill Lock 1-2-3, and then build a desalination plant to treat the water in Lake 3 so it can be put into Lake Gatun?  2. Why doesn't Panama just build a railway parallel to the Canal to deal with the changing rainy season and water levels for when there is a backlog of ships?
Why not dig deeper so less locks are needed?
So… before even watching it I’m gonna guess that it’s the fact that ships are outgrowing the size of the canal. And that it’s not really feasible to widen it.
it might be more expensive to do so, but just pumping water backwards seems like an easy solution.
The boomers did all they could to deprive future generations of jobs that had made them succeed. Now everything is coming together to bring those back. Can't say I'm devastated to hear that.
You can't take 70 years of data and conclude that climate change caused the current dry period.  The driest recorded time in US history was in 1930, long before any artificial climate change would impact the weather.  It is EXTREMELY likely that this would have happened regardless of climate change, and the impact of climate change on weather patterns is completely speculative at the moment.  There simply isn't enough historical data in most areas to tell the difference between a definitive change in climate and normal occurrence of extreme weather.  Even without climate change some weather patterns only repeat after hundreds of years.  Climate change also is much more likely to increase rainfall at these latitudes.  It is known that the Sahara is only a desert because Europe cooled off reducing moisture levels in the air that circulates into Africa.  The same effect would be seen during an El Nino with air coming down from North America instead of the Pacific Ocean.  Warmer air carries more water so a warmer climate will carry more water towards the equator (result of the Coriolis effect)
With all the potential business that is happening in South America, we still have these people trying to illegally make it to North America.... wtf
Swap American money from other projects and subject them to others?.
Ironic that the industrial nations that get the most benefit from efficient international transport are also the nations most responsible for the global warming that is making El Nino worse. But, as usual, it is those who weren't wealthy enough to be part of the cause of the problem who will suffer the worst from the consequences.
Every country in Central America should have Atlantic to Pacific Cargo trains.  Colombia too. A Cartagena - Buenaventura giant ass cargo train would give them so much money. This is likely the future as I dont think other central america Canal is feasable. The proposed Chinese Nicaragua Canal ended up being a big clownfest.
One person destroyed the Panama Canal. His name is Jimmy carter and prior to the year 2020 was considered the worst US President in history.
No canal is needed if the world is divided into 8 major confederations, europe which ends in the urals, east Asia, South Asia, Oceania, South America, North America, Middle East-North Africa and sub Saharan Africa.
What about the Northwesr Passage?
The millennium started in 2001, not 2000.
JUST ONE MORE TIME I WOULD SEEK THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE
What is stopping a team digging the cannal deep enough so they dont need gates anymore and the whole thing is at sea level ? No water needs to be pumped any more, ever again. Just a control station for traffic.
That system sounds really stupid. This was guaranteed to happen. They just need to lower the lake, and their problem will be solved.
Just get shitter speakers. It sounds fine.
As always, great content, awful narration.
What if Panama gets help making some sort of pipeline capable of pulling ocean water from the Atlantic to where it would be needed within the canal for proper operations?
Don't worry, the Arctic will be soon open for transit
Poor audio quality on this one. Love the vid though, this is interesting
As much as I want to learn about this, only 10 seconds in and it’s not the same voice I’m used to. I’m sorry I can’t, I’ll catch you in the next video
Sound system is very unfortunate
This Overland highway through South America isn't such a bad idea and it is good competitive business for Panama Canal until they can solve their water issues except there's gonna be a few problems I'm going to point out like transit feeds law enforcement border control like what happens if one side gets a bit too greedy..
As a Bulgarian ... I cannot offer any solution to this problem. But it sucks as I used to buy 1kg of bananas for less then 0.5 EUR and now it is close two 2 EUR. And somehow I blame the Panama channel for this!
I feel a bit weird when i hear about Droughts happening in late 2023... with how much my own country has basically been drowning since October.. (We have had some snow atleast, but 2023 has been the wettest year in recorded history for my country)  Climate Change ftw huh?
Air transit is going to be reaping the rewards!
also what about the northwest passage?
I support international law.
Time for my weekly dose of existential crisis
❤❤❤❤
Free Palestine!!
For the ad at the end, who the fuck is spending $3000+ on food and only $150 on housing?!? Where the heck do you live and what do you eat!?!? 😂
Why would you bulid a highway when you coule build a railroad? Its so much more efficient.
Clean up the rubbish you dirty bastards
I laughed hard when you said lithium mining will power green energy.
Trains will never be as efficient as ships for hauling extremely massive amount of cargos, not to mention the time consuming process of off loading them to trains & back onto ships on the other side, it's just not worth the extra effort. The Nicaraguan passage was ironically the only one that could directly challenge the Panama Canal, despite it now being the least probable of the four to materialize.
Why would China attack the US to take back mini China?
if you wish to skip the built in commercial at the end of this video, stop watching at timecode 34:40.    other than the egregious errors in the US military capabilities i mentioned in a previous comment, excellent video. thanks especially for the 4 alternatives to the Panama Canal i was not aware of.
Chile should just give back Bolivia's coastline!!😡😡😒
what climate change no waaaay
Lol, just pump salt water to the lake. It's artificial anyway.
Speed costs and society has been speeding along at breakneck speed. We need a slow down, a degrowth. We need to learn to do more with less because we cannot continue to consumes as we've done in the past.
why dont use the sea water from the Atlantic ocean to level the water along the canal?
I've wondered if a neighboring central American country like Costa Rica or Guatemala could build a pair of rail tunnels from coast to coast to make a pair of connected ports that can move a shedload of containers between the two oceans.
Why aren't they pumping the water back up stream rather than release it into the sea?
Something wemt wrong with this one bro .
he forgot to say the 4 routs the one rout he missed, and it was sailing through upper Canada.
Wait, you can just show up like a wedding crasher to the most expensive canal in the world, and they will just let you through if you pay? And why would these million-dollar companies not do something as simple as making a reservation? Even I make reservations when going to fancy restaurants.
Use the Northwest Passage. Use global warming to our advantage.
Queuing might easily add 18 days to the travel time through the Panama Canal. Revival of the southern and northern routes?
Your audio needs improvement.
I remember reading the China Threat by Bill Gertz written in 2001, and he thought China was going to take over the Panama canal.  Funny in hindsight.
I work in logistics and we pretty much never ship through the Panama Canal…. All products from Asia heading to the east coast just disembark at LA or Sea/Tac and rail across the US to the east coast. Doesn’t make sense to use the canal these days since most of the ships coming out of Asia can’t even fit through the canal…
I agree with @samheldmann.  Stop draining the water in the last lock into the sea.  Either build reservoirs or pump the water back to the lake instead of the sea.
My ears 😬
Going through South America is the worst idea. I can't even imagine the amount of theft and corruption that would ensue, but that's the lesser problem to it being so massively inefficient to just taking an extra or week or two to go around. The canal won't always be this way. They just need to dam more water and be more efficient. Also, China's and other ships that don't have anything to do with Israel aren't the ones being attacked. There's the normal Pirates to worry about, but they're less of an issue.
I heard there was a mining company using water from the lake too, that probably doesn't help
This guy must not sleep
11:20 Is there not a third option. Don't ration water for the people and simply buy water from elsewhere. With this, many billions on the line, won't that be a viable option? Also, start building desalinization plants for the future.
Why do you skip that the Panamanian government added two larger sets of locks in 2016?  Because it's added use of fresh water doesn't fit into climate change?
You really need to figure out your spoken audio quality. It is severely lacking.
Remember that human-caused climate change is the result of too many people demanding too much of scarce resources. Freshwater will become more scarce. Do you part to back green initiatives, reduce consumption and population growth.
I just dont understand why you don't ever mention the connection between South America east coast and North America west coast...
There is a LOT of truck trade between Argentina and Chile, and part of the corridor already exist,  also there is a pre-project to build the large tunnel underneath the Andes connecting Chile and Argentina to Coquimbo which is also a port city. Truck trade between Mendoza (Argetina) and Valparaiso (Chile) in the central part of Chile through the Andes is very common.
This sounds like a great student for desalination...   $5B income being threatened because of lack freshwater, do take a good size chunk of that and desalinate the ocean water. Problem solved.
Switch the pump from the lake to the ocean 😎 crisis averted ur welcome Panama
I love your information but your scripts are entirely too wordy and badly need editing. It is getting irritating.
The sustainable solution here would be to convert the canal to use seawater and pump it in from the ocean instead.
3:40 THAT 18 days is VASTLY incorrect. US Naval assets are MUCH faster than huge container ships designed for highly efficient and CHEAP fuel costs over a long voyage.   also, rapid redeployment of Atlantic Fleet assets to the Pacific is hardly necessary... the Pacific Fleet itself has been projected by DOD planners to be capable of ENTIRELY destroying any forces deployed on China's coastlines adjacent to Taiwan. additionally, US Air Force as well as Australian air force assets could be in the airspace above Taiwan in less than 8 hours. i also believe the Philippines would be happy to act as a landing, refueling and staging area for US and Aussie air forces if necessary.   just skip the military side of things. you guys OBVIOUSLY don't know crap about it.
Secure the shipping lanes period.  Well worth war I'm sorry
Carter was a soft idiot, the USA created the country of Panama then paid for and built the canal. Then Carter GAVE the canal away. They are mis-managing it.
I can't believe I watched a 35 minute video that spends a not-insignificant amount of time discussing future alternatives to the Panama Canal and not once is the Northwest Passage even mentioned. That's crazy
Peaceful community
Much of the modern global economic system is built on a few key assumptions: 1) Sea transportation of goods is cheap, plentiful, safe and relatively quick. 2) Investment capital is plentiful and will go wherever a profit can be made. Neither of these assumptions was anything close to true for the vast majority of human society. Hyper concentrated, long-supply-chain systems as the way most things are produced is a modern phenomenon. We are seeing the limitations of those assumptions grow every day. How about we use a bit less stuff and make it closer to home? Most people in North America actually already own too much stuff. Buying a bit less, paying a bit more, and having it made close to home would be a good thing.
So many things I didn’t know! Thanks.
I know it would be expensive but why not just pump the water back up?
Why not just dig a channel at sea level? It's only 26 meters deep (ok, more likely about 35 meters for some depth), and under 100km in length. Somewhat expensive, but nowhere near prohibitively and likely would pay off in decade or two, drastically reducing maintenance cost and throughput.
29:44 Not as "fast" as the Canal idea but now there is the already operational and recently rebuilt Ferroistmo: A railroad part of the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, connecting the ports of Coatzacoalcos in the Gulf of Mexico, and the port of Salinas Cruz in the Pacific Ocean. Cheaper, more sustainable and a lesser of a bottleneck for the global trade route.
Mic 😢.
¡Gracias!
Why don’t they just pump the water back to the lake and not straight into the ocean, is it salty?
Well that was a very biased intro
Hey bro just wanted to let you know I used to watch your videos a lot you seem like a great creator for this kinda stuff but you might benefit by making shorter videos cus I wana watch your videos but I don’t have time to watch all that
¡Gracias!
Bro, on your last few videos your mic sounds really bad. Either the gain is way too high, or the mic is broken, but it's now a regular thing that your voiceover sounds dogshit...
1.4 million a year is nothing given the thousands of containers many ships carry single-handedly.
This is only greed problem. If they get about million per cargo ship, they have enough money for pumping up hill the water. Not to lake, just avoid massive loss on other gates.
Another Climate change propaganda video. The weather has always been changing before humans and after. A man made canal will fail and the result is climate change? “Most scientists agree”, ya sure they do. Especially when you pay for their research. If only I’d pay more in taxes this would go away. Dumb!
Audio was disappointingly rough but great and timely topic!
You should reupload with better audio
Still watching and halfway through the video..... Why not just pump the water from the final lock back up into the lake? That would preserve the water instead of losing it to the ocean. There are allot of residential pumps that can handle 100 ft of head pressure and move 1 million gallons per day for around $5k. The pumps the Army Corps of Engineers put in New Orleans after Katrina can move 11 million gallons per minute (1 pump station with 17 pumps working in tandem). I would be surprised if there is no large, commercial or industrial pumps which could handle moving the 65 million gallons extremely quickly.
¡Gracias!
Sounds like it was recorded in 240p
The reason it's failing is that they doubled the size of it to make larger ships go through and they only use the fresh water of the lake to refill the locks and the area is currently in a drought. So you have two options shut one side of the locks down or put in pumps to refill the locks. I'm tired of blaming everything on global warming you get that crap on lake mead and lake Powell and the only issues with those reservoirs is that las Vegas has grown by a couple of million people in the last 30 years and southern California and Phoenix have grown massively and they are taking huge amounts of water and the majority is going for agriculture uses so you are taking more water out than what's going into the reservoirs. Same issue with the great salt lake they are blaming global warming for the lake drying up but they took the water that used to flow into it and took it for the salt lake valley to expand the population. It has nothing to do with global warming it just has to do with bad planning.
The Panama Canal is not really a canal.
He loves his own voice so much that he repeats himself 4 out 5 times unnecessarily... these 35min vids, could and should easily be 20mins.....
NICARAGUA IS GOOD.   USA KEEPS TAKING Ls
La Nina is coming back. The rain will return
Amazing videos as always, but you could have said all the efforts that the US went through to precent any alternatives to the Panama Canal.
This wouldn't be happening if it was still under American control. Share it with the Panamanians, sure, but don't lose control over one of the most vital waterway in the world.
I miss the time when you only make 10-15 minutes videos
Man I tried to watch this buut after a few minutes I just cant stand that microphone. Hope you have a new one soon!
As a brazillian I can say that the road network project will never work because South Americans don't trust each other 😂
Thanks for the great video.  Isn't it ironic that a new road in South America (one that will replace the Panama canal in part), will actually generate an enormous amount of carbon emissions for the same tonnage that used to travel by sea, thereby worsening the climate problems in Panama.  Curious.   Also, speaking about "unused" or "empty" parts of the countryside, especially swamplands, etc. is a little bit crazy, as those are the very areas that provide biodiversity and climate stability in the first place.   Mowing down untouched lands and running roads through it is bonkers.   Rail may be expensive to build, but doing so would be just slightly better.... What does everyone think?
I'm not an engineer, but this seems like a problem some big old pumps would fix... just pump ocean water up to the inner canal locks instead of relying on fresh water. Done.

Very interesting and insightful, would like to here about the canal in Ukraine/Russia you were afraid they were fighting for
If Panama can’t get their shit together, which they probably won’t since they let this potential problem fester for 20 years, the Canal should be taken from them and managed by some sort of international organization set up by treaty.  WTF has the Panama Canal Management Authority been ‘managing,’ if they let this obvious risk reach a point where it’s disrupting trade over the entire planet?  Don’t tell me there weren’t any hydrology engineers that had thought of this exact scenario, and don’t tell me the Management Authority didn’t just ignore it because of typical Latin American politics and corruption.  I guess this is what happens when a 3rd world country is given the responsibility of managing a trade route that directly affects worldwide commerce.  The world should just give Panama an FU and resolve to build another channel.  May as well, since the ‘world,’ as in the United States, will have to foot the bill to fix the Canal anyway.  While I’m ranting, I’d also like to slap the morons who accuse us of Imperial Colonialism, and remind them we GAVE them this massive trade route we built in the first place.
It's really not such a big deal. There are still options. So the price of some piece of Chinese TEMU landfill goes up a couple of cents a piece to cover the cost. Meh, whatever.
Great video.
¡Gracias!
So Why don't they simply pump the water in an artificial lake nearby and reuse it instead of releasing it to the ocean?
It looks like Panama is trying to raise the water level by throwing garbage into the lake.
You forgot about the northwest passage.
Raise the cost of passage and use the money to import more water elsewhere 🦢.
How about mentioning that the hoothies are doing it in support for Palestine , and they only target ships that are related to Israel? then US & UK decided to get involved ? why only half facts are mentioned ?
The tolls are divided up between Texas, New Mexico, Chihuahua, and Sonora.
I am baffled that it only accounts for 6% of the country’s GDP. I figured it was at least 50%.
I got an idea.  Texas, New Mexico, Sonora, and Chihuahua could build rails on steroids.  Nuclear powered.  The ship is unloaded onto the steroid train.  The train crosses from the gulf to the sea of cortez
Put in a desalination plant and use sea water idiots

Is it possible to build another canal which does not require fresh water?
i think i’m about to ask a stupid question, but why doesn’t the canal put water from the ocean?
Every time you say "Climate Change" all hear is "cow farts" So, the Panama Canal is dying because of cow farts.  Because droughts, floods, and famines have been happening for millenia. But today, we think it's our fault that these are happening, and not simply natural occurrences.  Is there anything more arrogant to say than mankind has the power to change the climate? Polluting the rivers? Fine Salting the earth? Ok Draining lakes? Sure HALTING THE WATER CYCLE? Hubris.
The audio in this one sounds the way a psychopath looks? Like it's just making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up for reasons I don't understand.
In to the topic, this is fixable. Is it an huge problem? Sure. But compare it to building it in the first place and you're talking a releative paper problem.  The biggest issue is that Panama can't solve it. They didn't do their due diligence in reinvest in R&D and infrastructure, and just took the cash.  In 1999 Panama took control and went for the profits without any planning for development, nor reserves set aside as a contingency.
What about the Northwest Passage? As global warming progresses the Passage is transforming into a viable option.
This is an amazing simple problem to fix. Holding tanks and using pumps to fill the tanksneith ocean water. Or they can skip the tanks altogether and just use a bunch of huge pumps. It's a relatively small infratructure modification compared to the money they are leaving on the table. There isn't a reason to use the lake water at all.... I just googled the difference in sea level between the Pacific and Atlantic is 3 feet. There is no reason this ride difference could be utilized to assist the pumps for both sides locks.
We’ve had the luxury of cheap abundant freshwater but that’s changing.  The PC is a great example. Thanks to the effects of climate change, Panama needs to disconnect its freshwater sources from the canal and rebuild it to use sea water.
Will Panama make another canal?
wake up babe new hyperfixation just dropped
What if on the other hand, countries in Europe like Spain, Greece etc can use this opportunity to take over some of the manufacturing and trading that was originating from East Asia. It would solve a lot of the transport problems. Maybe even Chinese funding could be used partly so that China doesn't spook out and create problems. It would be a win win.
The lake’s water reducing is actually a blessing bc they could use that time to clean up all that trash and left behind human waste.
I wonder how well the panama canal is protected from missile strikes..1 OR 2  well placed missiles from china can make it inoperable and is considered a strategic target?
maybe this is a dumb question but why not pump sea water instead to raise and lower the water level. or have reservoirs for the water that has risen to drain?
Forget about the bi-oceanic corridor. No matter when you read this, South American governments will somehow find a way to screw everything up eventually.
Better start pumpin’ that fresh water that drains from the lake back up into the lake.  Maybe Panama should start using that $4.32billion from fees to build some infrastructure to maintain its gifted commercial resource.  Oooh, it and the next 20 years of fees have already been borrowed against??  No problem, America will foot the bill.  I mean, why not.
Can Panama do what Mexico is doing with rail? The area surrounding the canal is already developed thanks to the existing of the canal, so is it possible to build a rail network and deep water ports on both coasts to supplement the canal? Having such a rail corridor isn't just a supplement, it is also an insurance policy to keep fresh water for people while maintaining revenue. If a Panama rail corridor can reach the same level of Mexico's corridor's potential of 50% capacity of the Panama Canal, that would mean Panama can fully shut down the canals and still be competitive with Mexico. At any capacity over half of the Canal, Panama's rail corridor can afford to undercut Mexico's own by supplementing the revenue of the rail partially with the revenue from the canal.
Past that, if you turn your volume down, a) not so bad, and b) you might hear when your moms have dinner ready for your 30 year old asses still living at home. Give the cat a break, this is nothing but rare and can easily be fixed.
India is responding, while impotent Saudi Arabia is sitting on their thumbs.
There's one obvious alternative that it is not being considered here. All Latin American countries (the Caribbean ones included, since every country in the region will be benefited by providing a safe route to the rest of the world) should work together, economically and technically, in the enormous task of opening a communication via between the two oceans, either by land or through a canal, or both.  The problem with all these present projects is that every one of them is trying to outdo its neighbours to become richer and more powerful. Working together on a project of this caliber, even with the help of China and/or BRICS, will make this region truly independent and able to thrive on its own.  Once again, the problem with this idea is that Latin America is still divided by greed and selfish attitudes that only benefit the ones that have been kept it separated by the old colonial powers. New rational ways of thinking should be brought into this projects and there are serious political decisions to be taken for the benefit of all involved. Greetings from Toronto.
Woahhhh global warming affecting capitalism???? Who could have envisioned this
But why not just rebuild the locks in a way that recaptures the water used? They could take the opportunity to also build for larger ships, and expand capacity while still reducing water loss.
You actually state that the authorities are restricting the amount of cargo a ship can carry. Wrong logic and I think the authorities understand that less water is required to transfer a large ship that fills in more of each lock. What is your source more this misquote, or are you just making things up?
Can you really blame climate change for what’s happening in the canal? A little bit maybe. But the canal isn’t natural and is man made. Is it surprising that this natural phenomenal, El Niño, is causing problems to our man made canal? You made it seem like El Niño is a negative thing.
A lot of containers travel by rail from Panama City to Colon and vice versa.
Narration audio seems different(worse quality?) than normal.
Panama is in drought, so shipping is a problem
What's the f*k you are talking about China? Do you lose your mind?  Taiwan belongs to China.
But they can just use sea water  😂😂😂😂 and build walls on lake ghutan 😂 are they stupid 11:29
NO! This video is completely incorrect. We have these lock systems all over the UK they are called staircase locks, you simply need to balance traffic going both ways and no water is lost. Even if that werent the case you could simply pump sea water into the lake........ durrr
No worries mexico is working on that already
Now in 2023
Why not have a collection pool to reclaim the majority of the water rather than dump it in the ocean over and over again? Maybe I’m too stupid to understand.
the government of Panama are not smart i mean you got the Caribbean sea you can pump water from the Caribbean sea (DESALINATION) in to the lake.
holy jesus will the next video about sugar be 10x this length
Apologies if this off base, but it sounds like you're trying to shorten your videos by speaking faster so you're inadvertently louder, you gotta turn down that gain. But better yet, slow it back down.
What about the northwest passage
Let me get this straight. Panama is draining its fresh water supply by releasing it through the locks into the canals and ultimately the sea and blaming it on climate change. In Australia the climate catastrophists said in the early 2000s that our dams will empty due to climate change. Guess what happened. The opposite. This video will not age well.
Why not pump salt water from the ocean to the top?
Wouldn't a ship with more displacement need less water to go through the locks?
Why can't they pump the seawater instead?
Why don't they use pumped ocean water?
North American railroads gonna get busier.
the USA has 4 cross country rail mainlines, we could unload freight on the west coast and move it east that way and the same thing in reverse for export.  Usually the canal has been cheaper than this, but if the ships have another 18 days at sea burning thousands of gallons of fuel then the trains will prob be cheaper and faster.
Why not use the northwest passage,
Yeah avoid dealing with the CCP in any way South and Central America, if you know what is good for you.

How to take a 10 second clip ("Climate change driven drought is causing a shortage of the fresh water necessary to use the Panama Canal") and turn it into a 36 minute video. Just add lots of fluff!
This is one of the problems that were foreseen decades ago, which is why the US government didn't mind giving the canal up in the first place. At some point, a viable replacement will come around. Nicaragua is a promising candidate, as I recall.
You didn't mention that Panama recently completed the Panamax locks which are much larger than the old locks, big enough to accommodate the larger container ships and supertankers. Larger locks mean greater water consumption. The dams and reservoirs  built for the old Panama Canal didn't have the volume to run the new locks. The Panama government will have to build some new dams to supply enough water to overcome a drought.
Mexico is building a railway to easy this problem
what about the proposed alternatives to the suez, such as a canal through isreal?
Panama used to cross 24 ships a day 20 years ago, rain patterns change, now it rains more in December. Water reservoirs got a lot of water in 10 days. There is also a rail line serving 3 ports in the Caribbean side and 2 in the Pacific. Check this video back in July and lets see how this video ages.  Those other options are to expensive to build or run. You basically made a video to follow the trend and get clicks. Sad
Install big big pumps
33:24 WHY! please just do the smart thing and keep the fresh water fresh, start pumping in idk ocean water...
Solution is easy as heck. High speed cargo rail.
Mexico didn’t build a canal but today has opened the railway project and is operating partly today and is espectadores to be fully done in less than was projected
Wow, brown people take it over and it breaks down. I'm shocked.
9:46 look at all that trash... what is wrong with this country?
Good thing climate change is a hoax
I don't understand why Panama doesn't just build a new fully sea level canal elsewhere in the country. It is clear that the current system of planning and construction doesn't work so it's worth doing it a different way. Have a budget of 1% of GDP annually going into construction, government job advertising through secondary schools like some national service, ask for donations nationally and internationally and don't set a time limit on when to complete it because it is clear that it will take decades anyway. It's not as if global trade is ever going to slow down at such a critical choke point.
maybe I'm missing something here, but why can't they just shift the same water back and forth between two lochs at the time? 😕
lol US gives up ownership to local government, infrastructure breaks down.  Reminds me of when apartheid ended in south africa and rhodesia.  Europeans left those countries with so much amazing infrastructure and they just let it decay.
I was surprised to learn that fresh water is used for the Panama Canal. What are the limitations that rule out the use of seawater?
Why not just make it so there are no locks? Time to rebuild it.
😎 I'm not hearing a no on the boat catapult idea.. ...
it's good to see that reallifelore has upgraded his mic from a potato to a russet potato
Carter really was the worst president.
If a ship carries less cargo, it uses MORE water, as the ship displaces LESS water, thus, MORE water is used. I don't see how carrying less cargo helps.
Couldnt they charge more money the price if water is high. So they can offset the useage. Im sure there will alwas people shipping stuff im sure they would just make money
Isn't one potential solution pumping water back up to the lake or to a water processing plant instead of dumping it in the ocean?
So it was maintained and upgraded just fine for 85 years, 65 by another country and 20 jointly so still the other countries money... and now in the last 25 Panama has only taken money from the canel and hasn't upgraded anything since lock C's doors in 2011... typical.
We all know the only way the USA is going to do anything major about climate change. Is when it starts affecting the military.
no doubt when the el nino cycle ends and switches back to la nina the weather will change and the droughts will as well
I find it surprising that there was no mention of the far northern option of the Northwest Passage. With increasing global warming, a nearly year-round trade route is likely to open up. While not economical for most southern hemisphere locations, it can certainly service any location originating in North America, without the interruptions inherent in a canal and lock type setup. Perhaps this idea might warrant it's own video.
Since we’re all throwing out ideas to join pacific to Atlantic. I propose a high speed rail LA to NY double tracked each direction. Freight yields to passenger rail.
Why don't they just build tanks to store the water next to the locks and reuse it?
Don't forget about post-panamax ships like Maersk's, which exceed the keel clearance of the Panama Canal, and thus can never use it (and aren't affected by this)
A few thoughts: What about an area North of Panama for road/rail transit? Could a new canal be built anywhere in the Americas that has sufficient water?  Could they somehow alter the canal to use ocean water or pump it in? Or, more unacceptable, could they seed the clouds to create more rain in the area? It’s widely speculated that governments such as ours (USA) have done this in the past for… reasons unknown!
And as soon as they sign rights to control the canal back to the US, suddenly they have normal rainfall again...  What a coincidence it will be!!!😅
Why is the audio so shit?
Why are you eating your microphone?
just have to pump the fresh water back up to the start. re-use as much as you can. it's a nice gravity fed system, but with more shipping, comes more water use too.
Loved the Paraguay segment. Lotta potential there...
Would it be possible to just pump in ocean water, eliminating the need for fresh water? Also, would it be possible to deepen the canal to eliminate the need for lockes at all?
your audio is clipping real bad. it wasn't like this before.
Thanks RealLifeFed
Lake Gatun is properly pronounced gah-TOON.
There's probably a fifth (or sixth) alternative that wasn't mentioned - the "Northwest Passage" through the Canadian Arctic.  It may not be a viable alternative today, but it might well be in 10 or 20 years, especially if some of the more dire climate models are correct.  This would be a particularly attractive route between Europe and Asia.
this audio SUCKS bro
I'm just watching this and thinking... Let them fight. Get that mexican railroad back to working, get that highway across south america, and let everyone enjoy the economic boom and slight price decreases.
CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX.  GET THAT THROUGH YOUR HEAD.
The third millennium didn't begin in the year 2000.
Huge mistake by Carter
the audio on this particular episode is so bad it made my migraine a lot worse.. What happened?
Couldn't Panama make a highway that follows the Canal and have the tankers offloaded on one side the cargo is moved by truck(or rail whichever is better) and then loaded on to a different ship?
Built 2 giant tanks to collect that excess water so it won't get wasted.  Use a computer system that monitors both the external gate and the sea.
Wouldn’t ships carrying less cargo cause MORE water to be consumed per lock cycle? The levels need to match, so wouldn’t a ship sitting deeper in the water take up more volume in the lock and therefore less water?
Stop the Israeli occupation
Can't they just install pumps to pump seawater?
5:06 "The war in the middle-east will eventually come to an end."  Sure, probably around the time when the heat death of the Universe happens.
Love yours videos I always watch them on Nebula but I wanted to pop into YouTube to point out you forgot an incredibly important alternative route. The ice in the north is melting at an incredible rate, ice that's normally present year long is gone. A couple more years of this and sailing from California north over Canada to Europe and/or the US east coast will be viable. That's why both the USA and Russia have started staking claims to any bit of land near the north pole that they can
Hevely loaded ships displace more water which actually causes less wastage when passing through the locks.  The problem is that the lake is now so low if a ships draft is too deep it wouldn't pass over the sill in the lock to get into the lake
Ignore the weather wars .
Butterscotch: You take a boat from here to New York, you gonna go around the horn like a gentleman or cut through the Panama Canal like some kind of democrat?  BoJack: Um, the canal?  Butterscotch: You go around the horn the way God intended!
What's up with the audio? Sounds like your in a box or something.
The bi-oceanic corridor sounds like a pipe dream. It would be so inefficient to drop everything on one  side of south america, truck it all the way to otherside, and then pick up it again.   Also, not to throw shade at this channel, as im not making cool and informative videos. Keep up the good work sir. But ive listened to this channel enough to know this guy is left leaning. We do not have enough lithium or nickel to put a half ton of batteries inside of every vehicle. It doesnt work, its not feasable. Stop drinking the climate alarmist koolaid please.  Almost all of those green energy initiatives are failing, badly. Solar doesnt produce enough energy, nor does wind, nor does waves. Throw in the fact that its quite difficult to store any built up energy. We have a self imposed moratorium on coal plants and nuclear. Take into account that most power grids these days are barely keeping up with current demand. Where exactly is all the power coming from, even if we could produce billions of giant l-ion batteries?
wait what do you mean they didnt plan for this contingency ?!  like...... woulda been... a smart idea... "hmmm what if rains alter? should we plan a back up?....hmm your right whats the point lets pocket money"
So the Panamanian people are wasting the canal's water it needs to survive.
I'd hate for someone to invent something that could like pump water, that could  pump water at a pretty fast rate Ebenezer hey wait there is
Oh no!  Not climate change again. 😐
Hope they fix this. Without this, Panama has nothing.
Every time a video utters the "climate change" I give a thumbs 👎... We live in a ice age you can ask Google.... Quit lying and spreading disinformation
Just pump all the water back into the lake with each locke
"The war in the Middle East will eventually come to an end..."  The only line I've ever disagreed with on the channel
Im a quarter of a way through this video and he hasn't once condemned Humas or October 7th. I can't believe how someone can support terrorism so heartlessly. Sad
The USA could fix but we want another 100 year lease.
The USA will just replace the lost water with oil.
At least climate change could help open up the Arctic
I wonder if there’s a Northwest Passage…
“The war in the Middle East will eventually end.” That’s what I love about this channel: it’s boundless optimism.
Russia arctic fleet: allow us to introduce ourselves
The United States' hypocritical foreign policy, characterized by interventionism in Muslim-majority countries, has reached an alarming level. From Iraq to Palestine, America's wars have caused immense suffering to innocent civilians. This behavior is unprecedented globally, as no other nation engages in such negative practices. It is high time for America to stop its destructive habits immediately, refrain from interfering in other nations' affairs, and hold its officials accountable for their warmongering. The true identity of America will eventually be revealed, and its downfall is inevitable. Meanwhile, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has lost its ability to represent the Muslim world, and it is disheartening to see Muslim nations turning against each other for their own selfish interests. The plight of the people of Palestine is heart-wrenching, and it is time for every Muslim nation to stand up for their fellow Muslims and put an end to this senseless violence. Shame on every Muslim OIC nation for their inaction.
Port on each end of the Panama Canal, rail road connecting both ports, tranfer cargo.
Why couldn't they just pump sea water instead of freshwater
Why trucks? Why not trains?
Anyone that thinks lithium is going to become a saving grace for green energy is just as dumb as our politicians.
For the love of god fix your audio levels! Love this channel keep it up!
Calls it a unique design, literally describes how a lock works, which exist everywhere all over the world. The Suez canal is the weird one that it doesn't contain any locks.
Could have been a 10 minute video. Bro really doesnt value our time
It's weird, I've been listening to these videos for years, but it's like he's on speed or something. He's barely pausing between words even when it would help with emphasis and clarity.  I'm actually now a little convinced it might actually be them using an AI to lessen the workload because an editor could do the script and the voiceover. They might not have the settings dialed in yet, but he's definitely not speaking normally and the volume is crazy blown out.  Could also be a manic episode, but it sounds like pressured speech...
Jesus you "content creators" are a real group of daisies.  You think people don't f'king understand canals? it takes you 7 minutes to say "it's running out of water" for what?
I mean just hear me out, instead of pumping the water into the ocean we just pump it to a separate reservoir
merchant ships going the long way 'round south america can use the magellan strait as well on winter months where the drake passage weathee becomes unbearable, although the 3 biggest class ships can't go through it, and Chile requires piloting that can rack up the cost as well, although it's better than loosing the ship to inclement winter weather in the treacherous drake passage
"cLiMaTe cHaNGe" a year of drought is not "climate". Fucking stupid. El nino isn't on a set schedule and variances are COMPLETELY NORMAL.
Didn't the current administration take the Houthis off the terror list? Almost 2 years to the day! Things that make you go, hmm.
Never should’ve stopped American Manufacturing and convinced all American children in school that they needed to become professionals to be considered successful. They destroyed our culture now they are going to destroy the world.
Brother. Ik you got cash to fix that broke ass Taco Bell Drive through mic.
I thought there was something wrong with my phone speaker but it’s just your mic
so, is there anything going right in the world?
There is literally a second wider canal that has been being worked.on there for years to allow even larger ships. 🤷🏻
I don't think you mentioned the option of adding enormous pumps and a couple of reservoirs so that the Panama Canal loses much less fresh water per cycle. Probably very expensive, but not as much impacted land as some of the other options.
9:09 um, then why doesn’t Panama just do cloud seeding to get some water to replenish the lakes? Granted there is probably a reason why that wouldn’t work that I’m in aware of, but thought I bring it up
Good news - the more the economy goes down, the more the population of the western world will come back to its senses and end all the crazy politics - its sad that we need many crisis to get back to not crazy
26:35 "Hong Kong-Nicaragua Canal Development Company" is a little on the nose lol
Climate change😂. Water water everywhere but not a drop to drink.
So why not use the north west passage? I thought that was a thing
There’s lots of money in dramatizing fear in the public!
Summarize in 10 minutes or less.
2024 will be a great year!   2024:
"Climate Change" is a hokes? Ya right!!! Why truck stuff when railways would be cheaper.
There is a transoceanic train in Panama that border the canal and connects two huge ports in the Pacific and Atlantic side. The issue with transoceanic railways is that now you need two ships to transport things. One in the Atlantic and the other in the Pacific. Mexico’s alternative has the advantage of transporting final goods made in Mexico's huge factories.
Okay, Panama builds a bathtub (a really, really big one). Next, Panama builds 2 multi rail, railroads (think around 10 rails in place of 2) from its east coast to its west coast (see where I'm going with this?). This Panamanian "bathtub" slips below the water in the Pacific (or Atlantic, depending on direction desired). A ship gets tied to the tub, the tub gets pulled across to the other side and Bob's your uncle, you have your ship in the water you want it in. German engineering created a huge coal digging machine. The thing takes up a couple of acres AND it moves. Drop that machine in Mexico to dig a new canal so ships dont have to dock, unload....only to load on the other side, on a different ship to have it cast off to wherever.
You know what might help this problem? Transcontinental railways in both North and South America that are actually designed to work at modern scale with modern technology at high speeds.  If Russia could be a functional state we might even be able to engineer a rail connection between Asia and North America.  I would also love to see a railway connection between all of North and South America.  India and Sub-Saharan Africa also need rail connection to the pan-Eurasian international rail network.  I believe Japan is currently attempting to make a tunnel connection to South Korea, though I could be misremembering and they are connecting to Russia, which would actually allow for connection to Europe directly.
Wait, why cant they use salt water?
China was also behind a project to build a cargo railway between Peru and Brazil. They wanted to take advantage of existing roads and towns along the two countries
Something tells me the U.S. will end up footing the bill at a gazillion dollar cost to the US taxpayer. The politicians will say its, "national security" while they and their connected families pocket most of the money. How about the shipping companies and the manufacturers that use the canal pay for the upgrade and/or fix? How about Panama raising their rates to cover the cost of maintenance and solving this problem? After all, the canal is theirs now plus, it's a revenue generator or them.
Why not just pump in sea water🤷‍♂️ boats come in from the ocean as is  its right there seems like a no brainer
Why do they waste all the fresh water by dumping it into the ocean instead of using ocean water in the first lock? Is it just logistically not possible?
when you said the war in the middle east will eventually come to an end i laughed out loud!!!!!
Globalism is shattering and that's good damn thing. Supernations being dependent on each other, like they are now, is absolutely brain dead .
Can't they just build massive retaining pools and just pomp water into and out of them, instead of dumping it into the ocean ?
Pump the water from the 1st lock back into the lake instead of letting it go into the ocean and wa-la problem solved.
@ 11:30 you can seee the new system installed to recycle freshwater. This could aid the situation
Trucks seems kind of short sighted for the Bi-Oceanic Corridor... If you're gonna spend that kind of money, why not opt for train infrastructure as well?
Simple solution when a ship disembarks build an aqueduct that takes the water to the people. Build water treatment plants next to the canal. None of the water goes back into the ocean.  So people can drink the same fresh water that carried the ships.
The only bad thing about RealLifeLore is that theres never enough videos <3
Holy shit your mic is fucked up
Panama should have used nuclear power to pump seawater into the locks to conserve fresh water. Blaming ‘climate change’ for every natural cyclical weather pattern is just idiotic.
Why trucks? Why not a trains?
Lol just melt the ice caps
mic check
Couldn't watch with that audio
Whey they don't use the money they've been earning for years to dig it all out and let both seas connect naturally like the Egyptians did with the Suez canal? Anyway why they can't just pump sea water, why it has to be fresh water?
The North West Passage is lurking in the back ground
wouldnt recoup systems fix much of this issue? like, the system already depends on a bunch of high power pumps. wouldnt it be a smart and *relatively* easy idea to just add cisterns to the system to pump in and out from to re-use more of the fresh water?
Instead of letting the water go into the Atlantic/Pacific why not pump it back into the lake or build desalination plants on each side and fill the lakes?
Do all of these things, to be sure that if one route breaks down, the others can tKe up thexslack
SADLY YOU CONVENIENTLY IGNORED THE REASON BEHIND THE HOUTHI’S ATTACKS ON ISRAELI SHIPS THROUGH THE BAB AL MANDEB STRAIT.  THE REASON BEING THE CURRENT GENOCIDE COMMITTED AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE BY ISRAEL.  PLEASE GET TOUR FACTS STRAIGHT.
Seems like they could just build a system to pump water from the first lock back up into the lake instead of releasing it into the ocean
You didn't watch or review this video before you posted it? Audio issue seems fairly obvious
Why can't Panama build a road or railway system across the short stretch of land between oceans?
did you record this on a grammophone
Jeeez get to the f’n point
SADLY YOU CONVENIENTLY IGNORED THE REASON BEHIND THE HOUTHI’S ATTACKS ON ISRAELI SHIPS (AND ONLY ISRAELI SHIPS) THROUGH THE BAB AL-MANDEB STRAIT. THE REASON BEING THE CURRENT GENOCIDE OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE COMMITTED BY THE TERRORIST ZIONIST STATE OF ISRAEL. PLEASE GET YOU FACTS STRAIGHT.
Enough climate change BS
Is there any reason they can't pump ocean water into the first and second gate? They wouldn't have gravity on their side but it'd reduce reliance on water from the freshwater lakes. I'm no expert though, just curious!
If Panama is smart they would build the road infrastructure as the alternative option. It's the shortest and most feasible
"Renewable energy" I never get tired of chuckling when people say that. Lol. Good video, though. Definitely did the work.
What this really shows is how accustomed we've become to the luxuries, comforts, and conveniences afforded to us by uninterrupted international trade. Going back is unthinkable.
When you talked about the Colombia's project I thought that you were going to talk about one of the naval projects, the Atrato canals were actually  prefer by US generals because the Atrato river is bigger that the Panama canal's waterways, the Atrato river moves more water that all the rivers in Europe combined, also is one of the deepest with an average 15m depth, in some places is +20m for kilometres!!!! also the average width is 50m, that is double the Panama canal's width after they made expansions, also in large stretches the width is +120m, there's also options, the Atrato-Truandó is the more famous and more expensive as a mountain has to be destroyed, originally the US army proposed to blow it up but Colombia oposed and the least known Atrato - San Juan canal, that uses almost all the Atrato river's length but is cheaper and easier to build, just 56 km and still 100m width and 12m depth
Freedom!    Freedom is more important than water for Mexicans.   America should secure it’s freedom
Why do i get the feeling that the "Houthis" are going to be the new Taliban/weapons of mass destruction?
We're all missing the most obvious solution. Fix US rail infrastructure!
A pile of stupid lies. Panama is the wettest country in North America. Average rainfall today is HIGHER than 1900-1968.  1970-2010 was a VERY wet period with few droughts. One drought in the 2010s is not the end of the world. This stupid propaganda has already been debunked - by lots of rain in December 2023.
I think I remember seeing a report/study done back in the 1980's-'90's about this very scenario and a number of exorbitantly expensive fixes that were proposed to deal with it. The main issue being what you covered about there being a median of 85'-100' of elevated terrain that had to be undermined, blasted, and then removed. Nuclear weapons were proposed at one point to do some of the excavation, even. Because going through Drake's Passage is unwise at best and suicidal at worst, depending on the time of year. Back before the Panama Canal was finished, everybody and everything transshipped and used a dedicated railroad before being loaded back onto a ship on the other side. Likely going back to just such a situation.
Pumping the water back up into the lake will help make it more sustainable water wise
The panama canal could be re-built to double the number of ships passing through using the same amount of water. Currently, the locks can only be run in one direction at a time so when ships are going up, the level of the locks are changed with no ship in the lock when the level is lowered. If the locks were separated by a small lake, big enough for two ships to pass they could run ships in both directions simultaneously so that the locks never changed level without a ship in the lock, doubling the throughput without using any more water.  BTW, the reason they are limiting the cargo on the ships has nothing to do with the amount of water used, the same amount of water is used to change the level of the locks when a fully loaded ship is in the locks, or completely empty. The reason for reducing the cargo is to prevent the ships from running aground. The lower level of the lake means the channel is shallower, and the ships must have a shallower draft.
Panama also already has a railroad running parallel to the canal.
insane how they keep blaming "climate change" for normal meteorogical phenomena
"war in the middle east will eventually come to an end"   Bold assumption
It is interesting that the very environmental situation that these ships and cargo create is what is now threatening ongoing use.  Karma?
Why wouldn't you just reuse the water? Or just use ocean water?
Shouldn't they have sorted a salt water source for the canal like say the sea? Engineers can be idiots sometimes
build a rail route in panama
I See 3 Options….  1.) Exodus 2.) Only Purchase Goods Locally 3.) Seek Professional Help  Can anyone think of any other options I’ve overlooked?
Can't they just upgrade it to pump the water up? They can get power from moving ships down and in last lock pump that water back into highest lock. That way it would not even cost that much power to run. Even if they use only power that they got from moving water down they'll reduce water usage enough they don't have such water problems anymore. So only cost is upgrade and maintenance of water pumps.
Drake passage is English 19th century propaganda.
Im surprised we haven't seen any of the climate change crazy people start complaining about this. Because the boats are using loads for fuel going around Africa. Figures when theres a real problem they wont thorw there bodys In front of ships or Missiles. They just clog up the hwy
Rain as a phenomena has been happening for billions of years, records have been kept since the 1950’s   That’s like less than a second of history was condensed into a day.    How can anyone say the cause is climate change and not just normal weather patterns that fluctuate over 500 years
Retrofit, at enormous cost, so that the first two chambers on either side of the canal are pumping water from the ocean up and then filtering back down
Ask yourself, why is usa's military bases so far from its own sovereign land? Would you allow china to have an arrangement with cuba to place a military base there? No you won't, so why the hypocrisy where suddenly you placing military bases in Korea and Japan is for superior moral superiority to defend these countries?   From the Israel Palestinian conflict It's obvious you don't care about countries right to land or their independence. Its all for your own selfish interest. So don't paint yourself as having moral highground when all your problems strive from your own selfish will to dominate the entire world sea trade routes.
"Most corrupted country" Do I hear "the US?" Oh, no! I guess I'm going crazy
Why not build a railway from A to B? Trains are cheaper to run and carry 100x more containers than South American trucks.
Can you talk faster ?
Papers Please but it’s through the Panama Canal
5 hours, since you uploaded that vid, and you are already at a quarter million vievs? Impressive and well deserved
i'd say panama should build shipyard in both ends, then lay 8 ways road inside the country. Or build a new canal that connects both sides of the sea so no need for fresh water.
Interesting topic, but hard to figure why this report spends so much time on possible routes through two or three countries in South America. Not likely.  What seems more likely with current technology  is that private interests agree to pay for Panama's leveling out the sea lanes to cut back on the number of, or just obviate need for sea locks.
Why not cut the lakes out all together and just pump water from the Ocean? Back when it was built, pumps suck, but now it wouldn't be an issue. You could even make turbines on the other side where the water goes down to generate electricity to offset the power cost.
The solution seems DIMPLE AS HELL, just drain the water back into the lake, instead of into the ocean.
your voice audio hurts, really (even distorts - please calm the audio)
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸✌️
Love your videos but somethings definitely wrong with your audio this time.
Why can’t they use sea water in the canal locks on both the Atlantic & Pacific sides?
Sounds like the canal pumps need to be re-engineered to not dump water into the ocean. Im sure they can find a way to pump it back up into a special reservoir to be re-used. I feel like the current design didnt consider water shortage as a possibility and thus there was no thought to re-using it
As a Mexican I promise you you won’t have an alternative to the canal in Mexico. The ones in charge will steal 90% of the money then blame the people and play stupid. I want it very very badly in Mexico but I doubt it immensely.
In fifteen, twenty years, when the Arctic is mostly ice free in the summer, Panama is going to feel the pinch as ships from Europe to the Pacific just sail over the North Pole.
Instead of dumping the water in the ocean, why not pump it into the next lock?
WTF  take the salt out of sea water and then put it into the canal....problem solved 🫡🫡
So the problem is the sea water and the locks. Raising ships 26 meters high and dropping them again. Using the lakes was a great idea in the past but now it seems like a new canal is needed. One that it at sea level. There is no easy solution...
I’d rather have our military build more warships for the pacific and leave the east cost fleet stay
Use sea water stop using the lake 😉.
*Panama will destroy their country and environment*
The Trump administration pulled back on Paris agreement and tried to downplay climate change as not being that bad. Yet another reason to not let that clown back in office.
With my engineering head on me. Maybe just fix the problem. Ie change how the locks work. Ie don't pump the water out to sea... Keep the water in...
where can I buy lithium stocks or something? I want to be Chilean royalty in 40 years
when did this channel become clickbait doomcasting?
Any one who thinks trucks on a road can replace the cargo load tonnage of a ship is delusional. Where do they plan to get all the diesel to power those trucks. What a joke the worlds green revolutions lithium will take millions of gallons of diesel a year burned in the highly polluting second hand rickety trucks commonly found in South America to be delivered to the coast.
Just dig the hole until it connects to the ocean, lol
Couldn't they just "simply" pump the water back in the lakes instead of the ocean?
large pumps to pump the water to higher levels...  seems like a easy fix.
Interesting options, but you have to factor in Guerillas, Revolutionaries, and the Drug Cartels if they behave maybe it might work.
Bravo 👏 great report 👍
so is it just impossible to create a closed loop system to keep fresh water from going into the ocean?
Saying its inconvenient is pretty insensitive. People in Panama need drinking water too
While i wish panam luck with the canal upgrades, and i hope they go for a more reause / reduce method  instead  of just fluidng more lands. I also am really  hoping  that the Mexico  rail line restoration  / upgrades  + the building  if a industrial  park along those rail is a very good idea and i wish them the best! It would bring hopefully  more manufacturing  over from china an give  the Mexican  population  more job opportunity  an pull more people  away from the cartls.
Long story short, this is why stuff costs more.
Buy local goods and stop having wars with everybody, then we will not need the canal that much. PROBLEM SOLVED
This is management issue and much less an environmental one. 100% of the blame is on the GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA for mismanagement and incompetence. Friggin El' Nino is a poor excuse given that's not the reason this is happening lol, they are only feeling the effect because of poor design.
So, you're saying the building of a larger canal next to the old canal has nothing to do with the loss of water in the lake? Come on, yall always present this climate change argument and ignore a massive canal opening.
Instead of dumping all that fresh water into 2 oceans why not erect holding tanks alongside  each lock and recycle the water? Even better, use the water from the opposing canal lane and shift the water back and forth.
Bro, That's literally how almost every canal works.
The fact that we are literally going straight back to 15th century trade routes is insane. So much for globalization. It's only a matter of time before we end up having severe shortages of what our home country doesn't produce, either due to global warming or countries fighting over trade routes. Then, it's welcome back to the good old days, where places like South Africa, Argentina, and India once again become pit stops for trade ships.
"A major military faction in Yemen backed up by Iran..."  You could also call them "The defacto government for 90% of Yemenis, who are also supported by the much smaller 'official' Yemeni government."
Why can't  Panama rebuilt the US rail line we built and use that?  The Panama government abandoned it when they took it over.
Because it isn’t.
Wow, where are the ingenious renewable energy sources, that would allow to reuse water used by locks? Or is this video just agitprop for green cult, crying that the weather is not gooder...  ?
Let me ask a stupid question. Why aren't they talking about pumping the water from the bottom lock back into the lake? Trust me, I understand how expensive and energy-intensive that would be, but when compared to the billions of dollars and years of construction needed for their other proposals, wouldn't that make it a little more competitive of an idea?
The audio is awful again.  I can't bear listening to it. Sorry my guy...
Can USA really talk bad about anyone else’s elections?
I like your video, like the content mostly, but please stop repeating yourself. Like the fact that is 18 days longer was at least said 5 times in the first minute... This is a pattern across all your video.
Fix ur audio.
Great channel. But, your microphone levels are really bad. You have way too much gain. Please invest in some higher quality gear &/or adjust the levels of the mic.
bro's recording this on the go
Why not use the sea water to replace the fresh water
Another brilliant video, thank you 👍🏻
Am I crazy or is the audio getting progressively worse on the channel? O_o
How exactly will a South American land route replace the Panama Canal? It will take money and time for containers to switch from ship to truck and back to ship.
In a few decades we'll see probably some files declassified as a flex to demonstrate how the CIA thoroughly and vociferously orchestrated the demies of the Nicaraguan canal for the sake of American chauvinism, and not a single person will be surprised 😂
Are the pipes a one way street? Couldn’t they pump back in the freshwater from lock 1 back into the lake instead of out into the ocean to conserve water?
Not a very merry isthmus😂
All I can think of is how much the drug cartels Would love all this options
The distortion in your vocal audio is pretty hard to ignore. Something in your audio chain has too much gain.
Dig out all the land under the canal so it's just a long ditch like the Suez Canal.  Problem solved.
Why not build road across Nicaragua?
lol, batteries don’t create energy and are not “green”. We are headed for a toxic nightmare making all these batteries polluting our planet.
Panama Canal was a terrible idea to begin with. Literally carved, needlessly, through a mountain.
so why cant they just pump from both sides if its so vital to their economy. just sacrifice the lake as a brine lake
I prefer the alternative plural of isthmus; Isthmi
there is some news coming. el nino is weakening. by that neutral area by april to july then la nina starting august of this year. good news for the canal but bad news for the western usa because of the drought is returning. so and our last fear that might be a muiti year super la nina which might flood panama easliy that means the city wil be under water for idk how long. so that what we are still watch on here. and that is it here.
Can't Panama also build its own railway?? Don't they already have one?
Okay I’m stupid- why does it have to be fresh water used? The corrosiveness of salt water on the pumps?
Could they not just pump sea water into the locks like 10-15% of the time? Idk how much salt water it takes before it starts affecting the reservoir but it seems like pumping in sea water in every 5-7 times a ship comes through could help. Plus, a little salt ain’t never hurt nobody 😏
Great way to connect several geopolitical topics to an issue with environmental origin
Why don't they just flood the canal with the ocean water? Like if the sea are rising wouldnt help both problems like da fook
CaRbOn FoOtPrInT
Why did America give away the canal great job government
Your  kidding  me... they just dump millions  of gallons  of fresh water into the fucking  ocean each year! Wtf, they should  be dumping  back into the lakes not the ocean, reuse that water!  Also anyone  else think that cordor being proposed  in South  America  should have rail as well as road. Rail would be much more effective  for cargo transportation.
why cant they just pump water up? am I stupid?
This may be a stupid question, but why couldn't Panama re-engineer the canal to recycle the water instead of pumping it out to the ocean?
I love your videos dude, but you desperately need to either get you mic fixed or get a new one. It’s become impossible for me to watch your videos in one go lately because the sound quality is so terrible, it sounds like you’re recording thru a coffee filter that is actively filtering coffee. It sucks because the production quality for everything else in your videos is so high, the terrible audio doesn’t make them justice
El nino is expected to end before the end of summer.
Regarding the Panama canal: In my humble opinion, would it not make sense to stop using fresh water reserves all together, and instead rework the pumping system so that it is pumped from the Atlantic Ocean from the west and/or from the Caribbean Sea on the east? In other words, don't use fresh water and use salty sea water instead. Let me know what you think?
Weird it’s like manufacturing of basic life needs should be based on the country requiring them.
Whatever the situation will be, at least the US pulled out from ownership of the Panama Canal so they won't get stuck with a useless canal in the future. I wonder what will happen with Panama? Revert back to Colombia ownership?
You should do a video on the Hiram H. Chittenden Locks and Fish Ladders on the  Lake Washington z shipping canal and  on the Saint Lawrence River and the Erie Canal and the Straits of Macinsc.
What's next, a crisis in the Bosphorus Strait?
ocean is rising the waterway is drying
They should pump the water from the oceans into the lower locks so that they drain back into to ocean once the doors are open. And if you keep in the 3rd lock as fresh water you use substantially less fresh water and also prevent the salt water from contaminating the lake.
The people who maintain the canal definitely should either dig the canal deeper & make it level in a way that is parallel to the sea level or create a new lock system that uses water from the oceans themselves.
Hypersonics make navies a liability
"Green energy" doesn't look so green when you see the massive heavy metal and rare earth element strip mines (usually in countries who don't give a rat's *** about the environment) which are carved out along with roads by petro-using machinery, transported, processed, assembled, packaged, and shipped by hundreds of petro-using machines.
Is it just me, or is the audio in these videos always super distorted (clipping)? Sounds fine on laptop speakers, but awful on headphones
A modern canal on the scale of Suez won’t be built until construction can be automated.
Maybe I'm a bit tired but it sounds like you're saying Pomeranian
Am I dumb? Why not just pump the water from the lock back into the lake instead of the ocean? And if it’s cuz it’s mixed with sea water then just like back from it from the top lock so you’re using the least salty brackish water back into the lake. Or desalinate it (which would cost a lot of money and energy but like it’d cost Panama less than the canal stopping working, also I wouldn’t be against the international community, esp the US, chipping in on the cost considering it’d cost global trade a lot too if shut down) I realize this wouldn’t fully replace the water levels and fully fix the problem but like it’d slow it down by a lot.   Also I’m so sad, in terms of that first alternative route. Why does it have to be a highway, was a railroad really that much harder/more expensive? Be like Mexico, they did it 100 years ago and they’re doing it again(“but it’s a smaller/easier area” -they had to build the roads from scratch it parts too anyway and there’s more than one country working on/funding the first alternative option).  The irony of it being an inefficient and most likely carbon emissions intensive (there is not a good enough nor widespread/cheap enough electric cargo truck) logistics route for the lithium triangle that’s “fueling” the green energy transition instead of a train that could be made to produce much less carbon emissions and would already lowers emissions anyway just by being a more efficient transportation method for cargo, ESPECIALLY RAW RESOURCES LIKE LITHIUM AND AGRICULTURAL GOODS.
the one in colombia is DEFINATELY, FOR SURE, 100% NOT HAPPENING. Only thing that matters to those who really own control and power over colombia (and the delimited zones in which the trains planned to build) is narcotics. Yeah, trade is good and there is good money to be earned in that proyect but the the people who control the territory would have to share or ultimately loss the money they're making of it with narcotics so... yeah, good fact but not realistic. You should take a look at the region called "nasa" or "el nasa" which is the main producer and exporter of white powder due to geographic circumstances and all the network is been set to get thw drug out
had to skip firts 5 minutes of yapping, but when you got to the point the video is watchable
They need to figure out how to recycle more water with pumps and holding tanks.
The draft restrictions aren’t to reduce water usage per transit. It actually increases water consumption per transit. The deeper a ships draft, the less water needed to be added to each lock. The draft restrictions were added (really reduced from what they are normally) because ships would otherwise potentially run aground given the lower lake levels
Love your channel cos you challenge mainstream assumptions. But not all of them. There is literally NO evidence that Iran directly created or funds Houthi. While the Islamic govt might declare support for any anti-Zionist/colonialist groups, that is all Iran has done. Same with Hamas. Someone needs to start correcting the record here.
I wonder if increased traffic and population of Panama also affected water levels of the lake
What happened to your mic it sounds off lately
Butterscotch: No, you didn't. You slacked off and took the easy way out. In this world, you can either do things the easy way or the right way. You take a boat from here to New York, you gonna go around the horn like a gentleman or cut through the Panama Canal like some kind of democrat?  BoJack: Um, the canal?  Butterscotch: You go around the horn the way God intended!
Why is it hard for us humans to understand and get along with each other.
Some of the Rail ideas are a fair trade off but how do you get ships across on a rail Line.     Also I think your audio seems off but that might just be me
Build another canal that's actually a canal and lined so you can just pump seawater agaian and again instead of wasting fresh water.
Poor man's economic sanctions.
The majority of your viewers are in the USA, use Freedom Units not that communist shit.
They really going to overlook the name lithium valley
El Niño is ending this year 2024
why is the audio quality garbage?
Why not pump water out and back into the loch instead of dumping it into the ocean? Not as cheap but - use solar and only when needed.
Easy fix stop dumping the fresh water to sea and  use sea water for gates 1 and 2 and pump water from gate 3 back into the lake when when lowing the water lvl instead of waiting it you will still use water but you want cost as much this will come at a power cost tho
Good. The globalized economy was quite the cancer upon the world.
The inter oceanic corridor in Mexico is already partially operational. Passenger trains are running with great fanfare and this year 2024, it going to meet with AMLO signature project- Mayan train to deliver both high speed passenger rail and cargo rail.
Your mic was a bit hot and you're overmodulating. But great video. :)
Panama needs build some kind of system that pumps the fresh water back into the system, rather than discharging it into the ocean. That way, even during major droughts, there is no water loss through the canal, and can continue operating at maximum capacity without any major downsides. I'm certainly no engineer, but that doesn't sound impossible.
There is already a single track rail line running between Panama's ports on either side of the canal. I can't imagine it would be very difficult to simply add a second track compared to basically any of the alternatives. That way they could have ships on either side essentially swap cargo, so ships waiting to use the canal could utilize that instead of waiting days.
What is up with the damn audio?
“Climate change “…???    LOL!!!!!!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I find it funny that Paraguay thinks it's going to take the place of Panama with roads. While paving roads might be easier than laying track you aren't going to get a competitive rate of tonnage to a panama compliant freighter without trains.
Sorry Phil but Putin called it at the beginning of his war that the West would buckle. Pelosi is just speaking truth. The masses that want peace are naive if they don't think the flare up of hostilities in the middle east isn't tied to Russia's war in Ukraine.
I just passed through the canal on board Hafnia Lotte <3
I bless the rains down in Panama ...
Every video since November has just been getting worse and worse for audio quality
hope they find a way to engineer retaining some  or all of that fresh water they're having to dump in the ocean
Why is your audio so terrible?
Idear 😅
Just build a desalination plant and imply stricter tolls
I know Panama previously added some water storage alongside the locks to help with water consumption, but at some point it'll have to make sense to just pump water back up.
It’s me, I’m killing it. Every day I drain 5 buckets worth of water **laughs maniacally**
It’s ok guys, half the politicians in the US say climate change isn’t real…
what´s going on woth the sound? did you literally phone that in ?
The end is near! Run for your lives! The sky is falling!
Global warming fixes this
Why don't they just dredge out the Canal?  Maybe take a few years but imagine how much it would benefit global trade routes
There is a permanent fix to the canal's  water supply problem.  Dig a new canal across Panama directly connecting both oceans. This would eliminate the need for locks and the dependence on freshwater from lakes. Ships could just sail straight through.
"Saving up for a house" Bahahaha hes trying to pretend hes a pleb. HE makes millions per month from this. LMFAO
Backed by Iran? Do your homework before you just repeat propaganda, then you will have credibility.
Panama’s Canal is dying. 68k people liked that.
Good video.
At the attention of the youtubber, your voice recently sound like if you speak in a canned micro. This make my speaker rush to ptoduce your sound and the quality drop. Only your vides do that recently
I did a back of the envelope calculation. Without accounting for any efficiency (pumping is not very efficient), it would take roughly 13.6 megawatt-hours to move  196 million liters of water up 26 meters high for every single ship. That's a little more than the average American's yearly house hold consumption. In the past, all of that energy came from the sun evaporating water. If the rain doesn't come back, the only solution I can think of would be to bore through the mountain or it's going to cost thousands of dollars more per ship.
Panama is bold for a place without a strong army and missile defense.
A few years ago the canal was enarged to accommodate wider and longer ships that require much more water to operate the locks. The original canal  was engineered for the   smaller locks to operate efficiently. Your rush to blame climate change may be only part  of the problem. Let us submit the problem to:
Heh "green" energy. A little "digging" into how those batteries get created will show that the green movement is not so green.
If rail systems thru lower S. Americas mountains, Venezuela, Columbia or Mexicos regions are the answer Why not a rail system alongside the shortest, flatest route....the Panama Canal?
This is the same story. How companies have the power to force countries to WAR! All of this because of Israel and Palestine! Its the same story just the packaging changed! These are the same countries that started the entire Palestine and Israel problems!  This has always been the plan for all of our sons and daughters to DIE for Israel and Palestine! War gives government more and more Power, control, and WEALTH! Corporation grow bigger and bigger and they become the government! They create CHAOS and CRISIS then have the solution WAR. Because they have the bigger guns!
AMLO has made an airport without traffic, a train slower than driving, a empty warehouse for medicine, so I can pictura Panama going lol about that proyect.
As always with this clown more climate change propaganda. 🥱
why sea water cannot be used???
"War in the Middle East will eventually come to an end." Best joke I've heard in a while.
Its honestly strange the world has two extremely important areas that allow massive amount of distance to be shortcutted. Out of all of the way are continents could have move about its strange we have these shortcuts.
Why the audio so fucked lol sounds like a Xbox 360 headset mic
A legitimate question here: instead of hoping the weather will solve our problems, why don't we use desalination plants to refill the canal during droughts, especially considering its vital importance to global trade?
The US built and paid for the canal and should have never given it up to a country incapable of operating it on their own. I'm sure the American taxpayers will end up footing the bill to fix it.
is this guy funded by the PRC?
Why would South American states build roads across the country rather than trains? Especially when an enormous use is expected to be going direct from coast to coast?
The use of locks isnt technically need though for a max hieght of 26m, surely you could dig a really really deep channel through the land and have no need for any locks. Of course the immediate cost outways it, but it wouldnt need any fresh water to run and would keep itself clear of sediment from tidal forces. Anglesey is a manmade island, some believe, a natural feature exploited by humans to make a highly defensable piece of land. Panama definetely could connect the oceans without any locks with enough bulldozers and diggers and dynamite. It would be worth it in the long run just would take a while to pay off
You mean to tell me that the ONE THING allowing Panama to exist as a country relies 100% on rainfall to work?!?!?! And NOBODY thought about, YDK, building reservoirs to pump the level 1 water instead of just emptying it to the ocean? It's not like El Niño is a new phenomenon. Dam! (hehehe) And I thought the Brazilian government was stupid.
Watching this channel is so depressing (the channel is awesome tho, authors are doing an amazing job). It feels like the world is going to hell and we witness its demise.
30:27 is this a drawing of a real event or just an artists dream? no credit or description at all in the video.... are we running a genuine channel here or just stealing content from whoever doesnt notice
just pump in ocean water this video is so stupid, you put that ROC in front of Taiwan so you wouldn't hurt the CCP's feelings? then you talk about climate change, just a scumbag who jerks of to his own voice
Thanks to climate change, the Artic Sea route may be open for year round cargo ship traffic soon.
LMFAO what about how China companies that maintain the canal these days? JC really gave the people what they needed by giving that land and water way up. First one finished will make the most money and get rid of the Monopoly Panama has...
War in the middle east will never end
Why can't they just use sea water to operate the canal, it would probably be more expensive but it would also never dry up since the source would be the nearby ocean?
Just pump the water back up to the lake instead of dumping it into the ocean.
Wait so ... People never thought to install recycling pumps incase of drought!? 😂😂😂
Do you have a source for them being backed by Iran?
What's the problem? They could just pump the water back up, it would just cost electricity.
The only problem is mismanagement.  Water can easily be pumped from the ocean to operate the locks.  Rainfall is a complete non-issue and entirely irrelevant.
Or, Panama can just build a new Canal and this time design it to actually be on water level all the time? It's really not an issue, this is more than doable. The whole "elevator" technique of the Americans is very redundant with the tools and technology we have today. It is practically easy to just carve out a canal through the land and into mountains in tunnels and keep its water at sea level.  All of these proposals are trying to fix an issue that even a 3 year old could come with this solution
Bro just blames it on climate change
Is it just me or is the audio quality on this video insanely bad
Please buy a better microphone
What I heard was, "giving it back was a mistake."
What's up with the audio? It's like it's got a low.bitrate... lower quality and gained out. ...did you use ai to generate the audio for this episode or something? sounds like a recording made by a potato made of tin
Real Life Lore is one of those channels with a team of production professionals. This clipped audio is inexcusable and unwatchable.
Wild to me that the video talked about the unlikely South American trucking route but neglected the Honduras dry canal (truck route) that is already built or the railroad that goes along the panama canal.
Can it get any worse?
Lowest level of rainfall was 1950.  Honestly, seems like a bad design to not account for a large variability.
Any Real Life Lore video is appointment viewing as far as I’m concerned.
The "new millennium" did NOT start on Jan 1, 2000 - it started on Jan 1, 2001 - as there is no true 0 in our calendars, 1-100 is the "first century" - 101-200 is the "second century" and so forth. Dislike for not knowing how time works.
Is it just me or is the audio quality bad?
Or Mexico could just build and Interstate trucking system that coppies the USA and connect it to Interstate 69 in Texas (Both East and Middle routes) Connect the western route to Interstate 5 in California and then build 1-3 East to west Interstate that connects the routes near Chihuahua and Monterrey. Connect those 20 million people in Mexico City to the USA Interstate system and nearshore Electronics made in Guangzhou and Shenzhen China to Mexico?
The audio seems to be imbalanced on this RealLifeLore... coming more through one speaker?
dont know why panama never built huge water basins to alleviate the amount of fresh water used
I would never trust a canal built by China. Not worth how bad their other infrastructure projects have ended up. They'd not only either never finish it or make it with "tofu dreg" mentality, but they'd financially subjugate Nicaragua with tons of debt like they did other countries
What if the US just blows up an land in the middle of the country and build a giant man made river from California to North Carolina?
Can they use the ocean water?
thanks
If Trump were in office we wouldn't have to worry about all this.
I'm surprised you didn't mention arctic shipping routes as a future alternative to the Panama Canal.  The Arctic Ocean is projected to be sufficiently ice-free to allow commercial shipping as early as the 2030s (and no later than 2050s) and there's tons of interest in developing it, especially from the Russians.  Pretty much any route that goes through the Panama Canal could go through the Arctic instead, no canal or other massive infrastructure required.
For those who don't know what el niño is, it means, the niño
Nobody’s using drake passage around South America unless they’re trading with the west coast of south America(in which case they’re using the safer Strait of Magellan) for vessels to/from the US the suez is only 6-7 days better than cape of good hope so most of the vessels my company works with have rerouted that way.
Holy shit your mic sounds horrendus wtf
Lithium-ion is a dead end btw.
"About precisely the same length"... Whos writing this? 😅
seems like someone needs to figure out how to use saltwater in the locks instead of freshwater
Why not pump the water from the sea level lock back up to the lake instead of out to sea? Seems to me like that would close the loop and solve the water issue even if it uses a lot of power.
Wouldn’t it be cheaper to install pumps to reuse the water in the locks?
your sound, sounds really bad in this episode for some reason. It sounds like it "hot" as people like to say. Whatever it is, the sound is not as good as your other episodes.
Looks like straight up greed. They can retrofit these locks to have self-contained, reusable reservoirs.
Can't they just like, stick some big pumps in the Panama Canal and pump the fresh water back up or use salt water?
He mentioned climate change a few times. Global warming is fake ….there is no such thing….its a political SCAM by the elites to raise taxes worldwide and to scare us into readily accepting the Antichrist’s world dictatorship. Global warming is a lie !!!
Canals will become irrelevant anyway once we see giant anti-grav air transportation barges.
Can't they pump the extra water in the outer lock, back up into the lake, rather than into the sea, when they want to lower it's level to sea level?
Why doesn't the Panama Canal pump the water from the lowest lock back up to the lake and reuse it?
Audio is funny
Huh. The audio on this is odd.
This is some god-awful microphone quality
GREAT INFO as always. THX.
simple solution, panama has loads of sun, build some solar fields, build a couple of desalination plants, pump the water from the ocean in to the lake again ...
Can someone please explain to me why they are using freshwater for the locks and then just pumping it away every time a ship goes through? Why don’t you build a reservoir next to the locks and or just use seawater?
simplest solution is to pump the water from the last two locks back to the lake, then you only have 2 locks releasing to the ocean at each end?
I dream of the day the audio quality of this channel will match the video production! It's so damn compressed it's fatiguing to listen too.
inb4 panama begs the US to build a new canal and immediately steals it again like the snakes they are
The proposed alternatives in Mexico, Paraguay, and Colombia don't seem to be able to address the actual transit of ships though, especially military ships
Obviously very solvable, just costly. Why do they need to dump all the water into the ocean each time? They don't, fixing this would just take a lot of money and material.
That's not a bribe. Use of that word just perpetuates an unhelpful stereotype. Or I guess every time I drive through nexus I'm bribing the Americans 😂
Chinese funding? Get ready for tofu dredge.
Still baffles me how the US could give up the canal in the first place
Trying to bring unrelated climate change into every problem across the world the only problem of these videos
Why don’t we take the Panama Canal, and push it somewhere else?
It seems to me that much of those issue could be helped by simply making the gate system use water more efficiently. In other words minimize the amount of freshwater lost to the oceans on each end.  You would think that some thought would have gone into this when they widened out the canal.
mic is really bad this vid
Do you know the main problem that I see here is the fact that they have to go up from sea level to the lake if they could lower the lake which I know would cost trillions of billions of dollars maybe my grandkids could see it the problem would still be there, but it would be way lowered Pun intended
The over-land routes are great for trade and should be pursued, but only the water routes can be of use to navies, I think. Having redundant and competing water routes which are controlled by distinct geopolitical entities would be advantageous for the U.S.
I feel like if something is making me billions of dollars a year, and is basically the goose that lays the golden egg of my country, i would spend a few bucks to modernize it. Why not just make it use salt water to transition instead of the precious fresh water? Make the pumps suck in as well as push out.
Why not just cut a deep straight line between the two ends and connect the Pacific to the Atlantic? The Saudis are building "The line", its basically the same but filled with seawater.
How come the Panama Canal can’t just use salt water from the ocean and then pump it back? Feels like using that amount of fresh water is ridiculous
PANAMA MENTIONED LETS GOOO
Merry Isthmus!
The West gave something away... it was never improved or expanded on in 100 years... now it is failing... and the best explanation this video gives is climate change?! Panama needs to just give back what it clearly cannot manage properly... and Liberals need to take this as a lesson... stop giving away what you don't understand...
Why not just build a seawater desalination plant for panama city?
De na na  De na na  De na na......Pa - na -ma!!! 🎉
I love how every video about the current Panama Canal crisis: 1) says the canal is dying, when in fact it is going back to the capacity it had before it was expanded, and 2) turns everyone into a civil engineer able to confidently provide a solution to the crisis, and 3) no one actually includes cost or time estimates for construction of their epic re-engineering, nor the payback time for this investment.
Simple fix. Build reserve tanks to hold the water for each lock. Limited water ever leaves each lock.
How can you tell me that lake is fresh water after showing me how much trash is in it?
We should have built it in Nicaragua.  That was the original plan, but they wouldn't let us.  Yeah, I know Nicaragua is much wider than Panama.  But if you consider the giant lake in the middle of the country, then two short canals from the lake to either ocean would have been more efficient, and you'd also have a much larger reservoir of water.  I misunderstood the 26 meters to  mean that the Pacific Ocean was that much higher than the Atlantic, and that didn't seem reasonable.  So I looked it up.  It's actually only 20 centimeters taller, which is insignificant.  The 26 meters is because the canal itself is higher than sea level.  Hypothetically, though - wouldn't it be possible to build a canal at sea level?  It might not be worth the effort to dig 26 meters down from sea to shining sea.  But wouldn't that be cool?  Especially if it were in Nicaragua?  Ometepe Island would be the new financial hub of Central America.
Me living in California realizing a LOT of the ships that went through Panama to go to ports in Texas aren't gonna bother with going around South America and gonna just drop cargo on the west coast instead. Especially if it's all going on trains meant for the US interior anyway. Bad for world economy, maybe not so bad for US West Coast states.
why isn't Columbia building a road to Panama and another one to bypass Panama altogether?
4:04 what's that quiet notification-DING noise left-speaker? Did your phone go off? I wasted like 5 minutes trying to figure out what here (at my desk) made that noise before I realized it was in the video lol (Edit: Another one at the end of 4:09)
Today’s other fact: one of the reasons why many Nicaraguans immigrate to Costa Rica is because it’s the least corrupt nation in central America
Hi, Mexican here... Just to say... The president usually have OTHER DATA than no one has/know...
Why can't they design a water recapture system? If the total volume is 54,000,000 gallons each transit, then each side would need a reservoir of 26,000,000 gallons. You can fit that much water in a 100ftx100ftx100ft (33.3m x 33.3m x 33.3m) cube. I'm not implying it's an easy task, but surely it's a less complicated and costly task than the other countries are undertaking
Dang, if only it connected to one or more oceans it could use the abundant ocean water instead of the extremely limited and vital fresh water. Maybe they can dig a canal to an ocean and get water that way?
First off is it just me or is the audio distorted and low quality for this video?  Anyway I'm half Panamanian and got a lot of family there.  it's kinda sad the effects of such a vital part of the economy and world economy, but it's resource usage harms the citizens so much. i've often been down there in the dry season and it's usually pretty bad and there's water rations and stuff going on. I can't imagine how much worse it could get.  I'm curious what would happen if we just started investing in local small businesses instead of transporting everything around the world.
Great video! You preach the truth. This is the time to ramp up and understand the gravity of the global situation... Train, be professional... Be ready and flexible. The more you work now means the easier it is later on.
21:44 it's centro-oeste (western centre), actually.
12:50: Well that's just wrong.  Hypothetically if a ship displaced 100% of the water in a lock it would require almost no water to be moved, light displacement vessels require more water.
#4 is the answer. Only one country is in charge. Stay Away From The Damn Chinese!
Why doesn't Colombia just dig a canal too isn't it too much trouble loading and unloading trains?
Why does the fresh water need to be pumped out into the ocean? Why can’t it be pumped back into the lake or a separate reservoir so it can be reused?
Ridiculous amounts of global trade not sustainable?! Who would have thought…
If rail between the two oceans is the answer then why not just rail direct to destinations in mainland North and South America.
Something seems off about the voice. Did RealLifeLore switch to AI voice generation?  I'm not against the idea of using AI for voiceover, but it's a bit hard to listen to.
how much would it cost to just pump the water from the lowest lock back to the lake?
What is stopping them from building a railway next to the Panama canal with like 15 parallel freight lines that just transfer the ships' load in a few hours?
An affordable inconvenience. The US has multiple carrier battle groups and global basing because wars are natural to humanity. Realigning who makes what and how it's shipped is only a matter of money.
Does the audio sound... _off?_ to anyone else, at least in the beginning? It sounds kinda tinny and/or clipped, like the mic was way too sensitive or something.
Your audio is clipping! Stttioppp
You can skip the first ten minutes to actually begin getting what you remotely clicked on this video for🙄 Jesus Christ guy
How does lower displacement reduce water use? By definition displacement displaces water.  Same as running two ships at a time, more ship per transit should improve water usage. It's gravity fed, there's no local energy expenditure to lift the boat.
I love your uploads, I learn so much thank you Joseph
With these issues ships can finally change their shapes and become more sturdy in high seas. Because ever since the Panama canal was built, large ship designs that made global travel had to be designed to fit into the canal this made container, oil and gas ships very top heavy.
So you need a pump system for the end lock on both sides, that pumps the water out of the first lock and keeps it fx in the second lock until the first lock closes againaround the ship. The system could be run on solar, since you wouldn't need it in rainy seasons..
Ai voice?
U show not just the economical situation globally, I get to learn the country
Forgot in the intro. Houthis are actively attacking ships due to the conflict in the Gaza strip. Also u imply that China could attack Taiwan then attack the US military bases.
Were I the Panama canal authority, Instead of simply reducing allowed ships to 18, I'd increase price until only 18 ships even want to pass through each day, use the extra revenue to build some combination of 1. pumps that move water from the lowest loch back up to the lake 2. Desalination and pump facilities to renew water in the lake 3. Additional reservoirs and 4. Ways to prevent lake water from evaporating (floating solar panels?)
Great video!
I think America and Mexico should make a canal from Texas to California. That would be cool. Then Central America would be an island I think. But that would make a lot of jobs, imagine all those jobs. Then we could charge China like $10 a boat and they would have to give us back all our dollars that they have. This would make America and China best friends too I think. Because China wants to use the canal. I just solved world peace in one comment. Get your shovels ready. There’s no shovel emoji 👎
You would think railroads would jump at this opportunity. Or better yet look for other narrow, low lying crossings in lower Central America. Or use better techniques in canal making. We have tunnel boring technology, try that!
the climate has always been changing and there's really no evidence that this variation is any different as a result of human activity. the data doesn't prove this out so it's really just a theory. Some scientists and  the media have jumped on this bandwagon but if you actually spend time looking at the data, you will see that it's just a myth. A few decades ago scientists were warning about a global cooling and of course that was not true. So back to the panama canal, perhaps water levels will adjust upwards, but perhaps not. Predicting these trends, whoch really span millenia is impossible to predict
They need to figure out how to use sea water to fill the locks in such a way where it doesn't contaminate the fresh water lake.
As a Panamanian, the government is planning to dam other rivers to supply water to the canal. We have a lot of water, it's just not distributed efficiently.
Install desalination. Use it to move water from the ocean to the fresh water lakes. Use the fees from the canal to pay for the energy to run the desalination. In addition, use dehumidifiers to capture moisture in the sea breezes. Even if there isn't rain, any time the air is close to the dew point, much water can be extracted without much energy. Install floating reflectors on the surface of the lakes to prevent evaporation--both by being a physical barrier and by reducing heat gain from sunlight. Lower water temperature reduces evaporation rates.
I certainly feel like they could modify it to pump the water back into the lake as opposed to into the ocean. However I am not stupid and realise that this would be a massive undertaking.
Love your videos, but notice some info gets very repetitive once halfway through.
The Panama Canal is great, the Panamanians are amazing! Fantastic nation that I've had the immense pleasure to visit.
Wow, fascinating video. Here's hoping that some of the alternatives to the Panama canal come to fruition sooner rather than later. Would kinda blow if the U.S. Military had to pay $4 Million a ship to get through the canal in war-time.
I like your videos, but they've become too long and exaggerated.
Mexico is constructing an alternative to the Panama Canal for commercial shipping at Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (CIIT)
Droughts come and go, typically shorter lived than wars! Panama Canal is just fine. Just wait for the weather to change and in the meantime find another source of water. Maybe pump seawater into the locks instead of lake water. Takes more electricity to pump it but would keep it going
Well, maybe we'll finally really start doing something about climate change.
Just pump the water back up instead of pouring it out into the ocean.
What's not mentioned is that the US has an ace card under the sleeve which is the vast rail network running from coast to coast. Not in optimal condition, but it can be upgraded. As for the other countries like Brazil and Argentina, unfortunately it's a different story. There were talks of creating the Bi-Oceanic corridor back in the 1990s. Yet 30 years later it's still a dream, which is something expected of those countries with endless funding problems and rampant corruption.
This video is littered with misconceptions that confuse the topic of Climate change.   - The Climate has always been changing, a lack of foresight (or just perceived foresight) on the designers isn't due to climate change not existing, rest assured they had devastating droughts every now and then back then too. - Now when those same droughts happen some people get CONFUSED and think it's a modern phenomenon when it's just a phenomenon.   The Earth has literally frozen before and it's been significantly warmer than it is too, why do we ignore these historical cycles? The same ones that show that we're on track and should more or less know what to expect next?
I don't know if you did enough research on the transoceanic railway in Mexico was already inaugurated this past December and although it isn't working at 100% that they hope to have it working at for a few years,it is in fact already up and running. There's videos on YouTube showing the inauguration ceremony by AMLO(in Spanish bust still there to check out).
Time to dig, duh!
The fuck is happening to your voice?
The Bi-oceanic corridor is a terrible idea, you'd need THOUSANDS of trucks just to service one cargo ship. It's crazy that they didn't use rail for that since rail already can support containers and you need significantly less crew and fuel using a railway. Additionally the Northwest Passage also exists as an alternative.
Why is the voice scratchy in the video?
I'm guessing thr reason you can't just pump the water back up the chain is that you'd always have to pump it into the lake and pumping salt water into the lake is not an option.
I'm confused. Why not use sea water?
The Northwest Passage is looking better but it will also require infrastructure improvements such as icebreakers and port facilities along the route.
This seems like a water storage and water pumping problem.  Would it be cost effective to invest in generation plants and pumps?   The Chinese are quick at building coal plants for electric generation and reservoirs for storage. And they give zero f's about the environmental costs, so I bet they could make it work.
1:40 Nautical miles, seriously?  I know it's technically what you're supposed to use since you're talking about something that's, well, nautical, but a very small amount of the population know how long that is.  Regular miles are bad enough, but at least most people who watch American media know roughly what they are. Even a nerd like me who knows a lot more about units than the average person only vaguely knows how much a nautical mile is.  Great video otherwise, I just get irrationally annoyed when people over-complicate things with weird units.
Why don't they just pump sea water into the first or second locks? Obviously it would turn the lake into more brackish water but probably not by enough to make a huge difference.
Trucks are not an economically viable option for replacement of cargo shipping.
Poor people stuck in Yemen 🇾🇪 ❤😢
Why does the audio sound like he boosted the gain on his mic too much?
I don't know if it's your microphone or your sound mixing, but the audio quality is getting worse
Did anyone else think of Chris Farley el nino?
Why isn’t water pumped back into the  lake before the locks open, am I missing something
As an engineering simpleton it seems to me the canal is in need of an overhaul with more modern plumbing and engineering practices and tech. Like using one way valves in the freshwater source lakes to prevent flowback, osmosis filters in line with pumps feeding/discharging the locks to keep things separated as possible and still maybe, keeping a quota system in place just to keep wear/maintenance cycles predicable.
Your mic is a bit high (almost peaking). Turn down the gain by 5% Great video as always :)
How can you call that genious? Just dig a little deeper and use sea level.
More lanes open, more water is being wasted. Instead of dumping the fresh water into the ocean, pump it back to the lake.  They are making enough money to do this.
A big problem about this for the United States is not necessarily moving product and resources but moving naval vessels in quick order at least how I see it like sure everything else hurts cost of goods and the like but keeping the US fleets from quickly moving from coast to coast is huge… big enough that it could become an issue I would make it an issue
They can also pump it up back, right?
Mexico should build a canal from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico. That would eliminate a lot of troubles for ships going in and out.
Wow! You really elaborated on the Transcontinental lithium triangle solution. That would be the stupidest and most costly solution. With historically eating countries. I don’t see any potential issues with that. The Colombian resolution is dumb too.  Lake Nicaragua is more probable and will save billions. However, the correct solution is to install massive inflatable Blatter’s at the bottom of each lock. That will inflate and deflate each lot as needed. If done correctly you can reduce the number of locks as well as recycle the same water restoring the natural flow that once existed. This would be the smartest and safest and cheapest solution.
You need a better mic, or check your levels, IDK, I'm no audio engineer. But you sound audio-crushed, way too loud.
They need to start using pumps to reclaim fresh water. It costs energy, but it's the only way to increase traffic irrespective of rainfall.
Whoa what is wrong with your audio? Sounds you got a webcam mic instead of the dedicated mic or something
get a better mic
All this climate change and the end result is more emissions from trucks, which are far worse than ships
or... and hear me out why don't they move the pipes from the pump on the last lock from the ocean back to the lake.
Could Panama just replace their canal with a shiplift or to take some traffic like the smaller ships. Lift the ships up into a higher canal and then, at the other end, lower them down again. You just need to have a large power source.
So, i decided to look and see how much it would cost to pump all the water for the ships, imagine just pumping sea water up only. (terrible idea).  39k on electrical pumps. Give or take. Based on the U.S. electricity prices. Figure triple that to pay for the pump maintenance per year, extra staff, etc.  Still a hell of a lot cheaper than running the cape. I think we can do this better.
Panamanian here, I think this just comes down to a competition of which goverment can handle it's corruption the best and sadly Panama is not really good at that, it seems that just about everyone who wants to govern in this country just seeks to enrich themselves and in doing so, leave the country in worse shape than the previous goverment. This likely makes it so that one day we'll wake up and the canal will be rendered irrelevant by global standards.  Corruption in panama is so bad that you can count infraestructure projects in one hand, this is latin america we are talking about so I know that the other countries listed in the video aren't exempt from this either but from the looks of it, it seems that they have nothing to lose and the world to gain, meanwhile our goverment is still proving to be the biggest and most expensice circus I've ever witnessed.
"Houthis and the Blown Ships"
why not pump the water back to the lake?  I don't know how much would it cost, but I hear this situation costs millions monthly, so...
lol wouldn't you do trains before trucks. am i stupid.
As a seasoned Civilization 6 player, whenever I play the Earth map as one of the American Civs, I always try and build a city where Panama is because your ships can just easily slip through the city. It's absolutely vital for controlling the seas around that part of the world!
Only humans are stupid enough to think that throwing fresh water into the ocean is sustainable
why can't Panama re-use the water with containment tanks?
Good time to be a longshoreman on the West Coast.
Why not just recycle water instead of throwing it into the ocean?
The modern technology permits to build a level canal in Panama.
For a travel time of 18 days, it would be better to offload at a port in the on the West side, and then drive it all across the continent(3 days in the US) and then load it back onto a ship on the East side, and continue on.
25:56 This is misleading. The US didn't start the Panama canal. They bought it half-completed from the French then finished it.
Oh no, we'll have to find new sources of water for the Panama canal, where will they find another large body of water near by?
You dont need to use sensationalist headlines. The Panama Canal is not dying and none of the other options are viable for like a decade.
25:00 to add up to the Colombian alternative: - In the past, Colombia had overcomed the geographical difficulties of the mountains and had a respectable railroad system. Due to various issues, like lobbying by the trucker guilds, most of the lines have been abandoned. The current government is pushing to revive them, and popular opinion wants the trains back. - The US had also proposed a canal through the Darien Gap in the Colombian part, but it was discarded for environmental concerns.  I say that Mexico is the only one right now that can get profit out of the situation, as it already has a transoceanic train.
Panama needs nuclear powered desalination plants on each side and then pump in freshwater into the lake at the top whenever it gets low. They should build the pumping station first, using any fresh water they have, in parallel build the desalination plants and connect them to the pumping station when done. When the nuclear plant is finished connect it to the desalination plant.  They should start this project yesterday.
Just dig a huge channe through without the locks
Reminder that no matter how often they use “ *global* shipping crisis” and try to scare you into believing all ships are targeted, it’s not true. The Yemenis are targeting legitimate targets, not unrelated ships. Just like how the Russian oligarchs were targeted when Russia invaded Ukraine, same thing here. lsrseli connected ships are being targeted, wether or not they are heading there. If they have a connection to that state they are a legitimate threat.
The population explosion along the Panama canal explains the great expansion of water usage that lowers the lake, The rapid cutting down of the rain forest and the draining of swampland are the major causes for the canal water level problems.I wish people would quit trying to blame other people for problems they brought on themselves.
"Super" El Nino.
You mentioned global warming but did you mention of the Northwest Passage opening for China to East North America and Europe cargo traffic? If so and i missed it, sorry. Not gonna rewatch.
Probably a dumb question but why couldn’t they just pump the water from the first lock back up the the lake instead of releasing it into the ocean??
At the mercy of the weather. To replenish the lake water at a minimum of what the locks use per day ..... there's 26m rise to the lake, build a desal plant as closest point, pump desal water into the lake .... that'd be the easiest fastest solution and it would replenish the volume of water used per day by the canal operating at max capacity.
Climate change, climate change, climate change. Time-frame: 70 years. Age of earth: 4.6 billion years.
Panamanian here: The main problem with the Canal is that the mentioned Panama Canal Authority has grown complacent and inept. The stories of corruption and incompetence have become common, when ti used to be that only the best of the best got to work in the Panama Canal.
It’s time to create a full river in Panama
I find it funny that the cost of insurance is not mentioned on the video. Going around south america is quite dangerous, so not only extra time, like the case for africa, but insurance companies surely add a huge premium for sailing that route
Pump it back up instead of draining it into the ocean..? Like wut?
Why not a Panama high speed cargo railway built quickly as a backup alternative too? If 3/5 alternatives are rail-based I don't see why Panama can't do the same thing in the interim by offering an Atlantic port and a Pacific port connected by a high capacity cargo railway. Surely it would be faster to build than 6 years and $900M+ USD...
Why just recycle those water ib a tank? that isn't so complicated.
It's time for the US to LIBERATE the Pamana ... AGAIN!    It's just Too Important to be left in the hands of the pamananian mexicans.  They got to have all those decades of keeping all the revenue; now, that the canal needs more work, the mexicans should peacefully transfer the canal Back to the US.  It AIN'T like those mexicans are going to improve and modernize ANYTHING of it; just milk it of Everything, and watch it fall apart.
Audio is a bit off on this I think.
I'm Sure Aircraft Carriers couldn't fit but I heard one of the Reasons The US  stopped building Battleships was because they weren't big enough to Fit through The Panama Canal.. If Those Merchant Ships 🚢 can fit through with all that Cargo, I'm Sure Battleships could fit.. I heard The US Also built The Destroyer ships to Fit Perfectly through The Panama Canal and I've been on a Destroyer and they aren't that Big.. Very Slim in comparison to those Merchant ships..
Well maybe they should STOP PUMPING FRESH WATER INTO THE OCEAN.  Pretty fvcking certain instead of letting the fresh water go into the ocean at the first level, they can figure a way NOT to pump that water into the ocean.  Perhaps pump the fresh water into a separate staging resevoir and use sea water to flood level 1.  BUT NO.  THEY KEEP FLUSHING THE FRESH WATER INTO THE OCEAN LIKE IDIOTS
Waiting 18 days is still significantly cheaper than traveling 18 days, though at some point it might be cheaper to unload it onto land transport over land and load onto another ship - that is though requires a lot of infrastructure change to streamline something like this
PLEEEEEASEEE MAKE A VIDEO OF THE LITHIUM TRIANGLE
You lost me when you said climate change was well understood. Now I know you are a CIA plant.
if they really cared they would cut the canal wider and drain the lake so the cut can go from sea to sea without the time consuming locks. panama has made more than enough to do it but they wont
Aw man not my country under fire. Big fan of your videos!
Why doesn't Panama use treated wastewater that was used for drinking water first for the canal?  That way every gallon of water used for drinking would be used twice.  And every gallon of treated water would offset a gallon of fresh water from the lake.
I, too, read the Economist. A lot more in depth then what was printed last week (or was it the week before)? Anyway, solid video man. Appreciate the effort and good info.
If I owned Panama, I would do two things. 1: Go ahead and dam the Indio river. 2: Invest in nuclear power plants that would pull hydrogen out of the ocean water and pipe it to Lake Gatun. At lake Gatun, I would run it through fuel cells to generate electricity and water. The water would go to the lake, the electricity would power trains that cross the country as an alternative to the canal.
i love your shit
The Mexican Rail project seems to be the best for global trade, and could be a key for Mexico's rising manufacturing industry, and have access to east and west ports, close by to one of the most population dense areas on the planet. The trade between Mexico and the US will bloom.
Instead of trying to put a bandaid on the situation, why not actually tackle the problem directly. Why not have a giant holding tank to hold all the water that would normally get dumped in the ocean? Then you could just reuse the water. Maybe im making it sound simple but obviously what theyre doing aint working. And im 1 fuckin person. They got a whole country to figure it out. Chop chop
Looks like South America is about to blow up.  Edit: in a good way
That mic sounds like it's borked mate.
I'm curious why for the Bi-Oceanic Corridor, they didn't opt to go for a multi-track railroad? With the capacity of modern container ships, it seems like relying on hundreds of trucks and drivers places some caps on the system's reliability and capacity if the purpose is to offload a ship on one side and reload on the other. As for growing local economies, it could certainly be transformative. But as an alternative to the panama canal, seems like a questionable investment.
Shipping companies don't care about the boats, cargo, nor the people going through the Red Sea... they care about the price to insure the ships and the load.
Here's an example of current development  that still has ICE transportation as it's backbone
Climare change  no water
High lock, up goes the ship Low lock, the ship takes a dip First they raise the water level, then lower it again Through the Panama Canal, it's really zen
Does Panama own its canal or is it under another entity with different Allegiances?
Please read the numbers after the decimals the proper way. 0.32 is point three two not point thirty two
Another mention of climate change. Climate’s been changing on earth since way before we were here bro.
“ War in the Middle East will eventually end “ it’s been going on since the days of the “lord”
Thank you for this info.
A desalination plant can't fix the problem? Well, one on each end of the canal to provide water for the lock system - to me it seems obvious, I'm just curious why it isn't being considered by the professionals.
Mexcan "Corredor Interoceaánico" is already working.  Please make an update on your info. Or maybe the US is not receiving $$$ from this project and doesn't want others know. Yes the amount of containers is much less than the Panama Channel but it's worth a try  since conpanies are invited to do Near shoring business thru 10 huge industrial parks along the corridor.
im argentinan, PLEASE GOD PLEASE
7 million subscribers and still using a $20 headset mic. Shameful audio quality.
Panama didn't invest in a train yard or any train infrastructure?! Yikes
"The war in the middle east will eventually come to an end"? The sun, taxes, death and war in the middle east are one of the constants I have in my life.
Uhhhh, actually, I just got back home from Panama, and you are just fear mongering!   There was a small drought last year, but there was but there was never much risk of not being to operate the panama canal.  The tropics have heavy rains in the rainy seasons and panama gets hit by that hard AF, and global warming will do nothing but create more rain.  And you're cherry picking one year, and it was during el-nino!  And you readily admit that we didn't understand climate 100 years ago, as opposed to now, when th weather man is only correct 42% of the time?  Right, that's called the "but we know better now" fallacy.  You assume we actually understand all the septillions of kazillions of different variables that make up long term climate.      And like I said, you are wrong, I was just there is no drought there! Nobody there is actually worried about his because the wet season is just a few months away.      Not another thing to be worried about!
@reallifelore dude, u got bad info, here in México the train Is already done, the inaguration was on december 2023 not 2033
Why don’t they use pumps… to pump out the salt water then pump fresh water in go to the other side pump out the fresh water n pump the salt water in?
The records go back to the 1950s" - which is less than one human lifespan.  So a once in a lifetime weather event means the end of the world as we know it - got it!  All bad weather everywhere is due to climate change.  No bad weather existed before humans began using fossil fuels in the late 1800s.
Topics like this are what we need to focus on in the Climate Change debate. The sad fact is corporate suits don't give a damn if they cause an entire country to run out of water and damn tens of millions to dying of thirst. But if a canal they depend on for their profits dries up, that will phase them. Appealing to compassion will never work on people who have none.
Wouldn’t it make more sense to build a bunch of straight line railroads across the shortest part of Panama unload the ships on one side and load the goods onto ships on the other it would take some serious logistics but your basically having the canal still operational even when it isn’t
Video sounds like the audio has been compressed at least 3 times.
Slowly the whole planet is...
The sound was a bit tinny for this video compared to usual videos.
Did you forget about the inter oceanic canal project in Colombia?
Why can't they pump the fresh water backwards to the start poimt instead of releasing it into the ocean?  The energy expended to do this with Solar would be cheaper and easier to do than building more dams wouldn't it?  And since the water would only be in the locks, mixing salt water with fresh water wouldn't be a concern.
Disrupting world trade is one way to get politicians to care about climate change
I'm not an engineer, but why isn't one of the solutions to the freshwater problem to pump the fresh water back up to the top rather than releasing it to the ocean? I know that would require MASSIVE pumps that would probably use a lot of energy to run, but it seems like a much simpler solution than boring a massive tunnel to pipe in more fresh water or building a new dam (and is probably more energy efficient than shipping freight across the continent by train or truck). At least to me it makes sense, the problem is that too much fresh water is going out to the ocean, so release less of it into the ocean.
Why not just build a big pump to draw sea water to elevate the ships instead?
Australia, we have have your rain, its falling on my roof right now!
7:12 wow that’s Gatun of water!
The ismo rail in Mexico is already open
I’m not surprised it wasn’t mentioned but there was a 5th alternative idea. Haven’t heard anything about it in like 10 years but Costa Rica for a little while considered making a dry canal with a train track and road crossing from coast to coast. The dry canal would be around 50% longer than Tehuantepec but so far hasn’t gotten beyond the early planning stage as we would have to build 2 massive ports.  It could be built in the south close the border with Panama and it would be shorter than Tehuantepec but then it would have to cross the Talamanca mountain range which is just not feasible since the region is very hard to traverse and has very little infrastructure and overall very underdeveloped. At least it could use Golfito (a big-ish port) on the pacific coast and upgrade it instead of building a port from scratch
I just wanna say, the narrator pronounces the word during like "deering" and I find it unique and interesting and also a little bit strange/confusing
Dont see the road working. Maybe if it was a freght rail
Alternative number one makes no sense trucks are nowhere near as efficient at transporting goods as ships are may be a cool new trade route but doesn’t at all serve as an alternative to a canal
I dont think the size or displacement of the ship affects the amount of water used in the locks.  You also say that some boats go through together.
Ah....I see... San Diego got all of Panama's water.....
The US was ok taking Colombia's Panama but stood against UK and France doing the same to Egypt's Suez 🤔
i might be an idiot but can't they install pumps and pump seawater in the locks to raise the level, only using the lake to fill the last lock so salt water doesn't mix with fresh water?N
A simple solution would be to pump seawater between the locks and not only rely on local precipitation. You have two massive oceans on both ends but are still complaining about water. The freshwater and seawater contamination will still be negligible considering the size of Lake Gatun. But I suspect the environmentalists are blocking that from happening.
If climate change keeps warming things up, the Northwest passage through arctic Canada may become the most viable option to transport goods between Asia & Europe, and West & East North America.
Dude, why the fuck do you spend so much money on these videos and then record the VO through a Nintendo DS in a coffee can? You realize all the reasons not to do this, right?
Lithium batteries are going to do what ? 😂 propaganda is insane. Straight from Davos w/ the WEF talking points
And all 4 alternate proposals would become a centerpiece for the cartels.  Panama better roll up their sleeves.
Why not just use market forces by raising the prices on using the canal?
...just pump the water from the first lock back up into the lake after the ship leaves?
Bi oceanic corridor doesnt make any sense as a competitor to panama canal. No one outside of SA is sane enough to go though that.
Why do you sound so rushed? Did someone speeded the video up during editing?
Oh my friend, the Mexico project is not happening and iwll not happen. Mexico is corrupt as hell. And this stupid ass goverment spent their pollitical power on building the train in the Yucatan Peninsula
bad audio... very pitchy :/
Why don't they pump seawater into the lower locks instead?
Just use salt water ….
@11:00 narrator say half million people, graph says 2.25 million. So they use around 23 or 104 gallons per person daily. Hundred gallons a day seems awfully high so graph looks correct. Script error.
L M F A O "the war in the middle east will eventually come to an end"   That's a good one 👌🤣🤣
All problems are due to climate change. I am going to tell the bank, "I can't make my mortgage payment due to climate change".
So.... why are they not investing in a desalination system that would be able to reclaim lock water/ocean water to refill the lake or created lock ponds?
when white ppl arent in charge, everyone suffers
Forgive my ignorance... but why not just pump the water back into the lake instead of into to ocean. seems like a painfully simple solution.
All these projects and I just can’t help but think what will happen to the environment WE MUST PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT!
I hope for prosperity for my country Mexico, but I also hope for Panama to recover as well.
U.s.a and the most powerful nato members should control all canals and vital shipping lanes. No one can deny the world would overall improve if that was the case.  We have the resources to protect and maintain.
fyi, you have your microphone’s preamp gain too hot. your voice over is distorted and it’s obnoxious.
Why can’t we just dig the Panama Canal out at one depth and maybe a little wider?
I remember in 2013 I lived in Colombia for a while, one of my favorite conversations was about how Colombia has been planning to connect some of those rivers to create a second inter-oceanic path, one that would be less convenient than the Panama canal, but with a much higher capacity for ships.
What he said at minute 5 made me laugh: “When the war in the Middle East comes to an end…” Fat chance
Powering the damn thing with fresh water is a subpar solution.  Reservoirs that get replenished can be used for much more basic needs. Like drinking it themselves or giving it to people who actually need it 🤷🏻‍♀️  The cost is most likely horrible to stomach but in the long run it might help more than it took.
You failed to mention a fifth alternative to the Panama canal. The Panama Canal Railway. Opened in 1855, this is an already well-established cargo trade route linking ports on both sides of the canal. Most shipping companies are just choosing not to use it. Because of this I don't see how many of these other road and rail projects will be able to succeed without a drastic and permanent reduction of cargo capacity through the canal or significant increase in cargo moving between the Atlantic and Pacific.
0:17 The Houthis are only attacking Israeli-related ships, not all merchant ships.
No mention of the northwest passage?
I dont know nothing about this but, Why dont they use the sea water instead ?
Well it was a stupid design to use collected fresh water for filling locks😆 Gaz UK.
TL;DR  The man-made lake in the center of the Panama canal is running out of water to raise the ships to the height to traverse the length of the canal  And its loosing water because of global warming reasons (more droughts) and because it looses water each and every time the locks are opened to operate the canal as the lake's fresh water drains out to the sea
Panama Canal is fresh and alive as ever. 😍😍😍
Something up with the mic ? And that background noise 😵 17:40
Would a fifth option be a desalination plant? This is not the greenest way and would contribute to the global warming, but it can potentially save their economy, and also bring more drinkable water to the people. But what do I know, nothing. Just 1/7billion.
Have not watched this video but I'm guessing the reason involves some State Department enemy country.
Sort version because panama canal use sweet water and panama safer from dry weather . Bro you need to do short videos, max 15 min .
Jesus fucking christ, man, you take way too long to get to the fucking point.
Maybe I don't understand the engineering challenge, but why can't they run a massive above ground pipe (or series of them) from the locks by the ocean back to Lake Gatun?  I imagine you could just puts some massive pumps in there and pipe it back to the lake and save 99% of the water.  Systems could be brought online as needed depending on drought conditions and if the cost to operate the system is worth the extra transit fees they would get from a higher throughput, etc... Obviously it wouldn't be cheap but it seems straightforward enough and much more of a stable design than being beholden to cyclic and possibly diminishing rainfall.
How is it a question between 6% of gdp or 1 million plus lives?  Stop calling it climate change, it’s geo engineering.
A really interesting topic, but man. There is some super shitty writing in this, from a grammar perspective. Redundant or repeated words, sentences which don't flow proplerly, a stilted audio recording...  Something is really off about this video, and overall it just gives bad vibes. Like. The point about an "area the size of Austria" not having paved roads... you said that twice. Was that because this video was rushed out in a hurry, and you didn't even bother to proof read, or are we looking at some AI shenanigans?
Whatever you do, don't mention Israel!!!
How about just building a water treatment plant right next to the canal? That way the water that would be dumped into the ocean, could instead be turned into drinking water.
Seems like its time to build a desalinization facility to start pumping fresh water into the lake then.
Sounds like the canal needs to build a pipeline to use saltwater
Bro mic isn't on properly in this video
It's maybe a stupid question but can't you just carve a channel that doesn't requier elevataion change? so you don't need the extra water?
Why would the Colombian and Mexican railroads be necessary when the Panama Canal Railroad already exists?
Dont be silly, of course it's not climate change, it's because we didnt deported enough immigrant to the god of economy and we didn't raised the wall high enough and with enough wire in the mexican border.... Trust me i know...
It's so beautiful and magical if you fly over the canal in the morning. It's like flying in a different world
Multiple shortcuts blocked
Correct your voice volume please it's jarring
they could use a hydraulic elevator with weights as an alternative to the old system.
I really don't think that these rail and road projects can match the sheer volume of ship transport at a reasonable cost.
You need a new Shure Sm7b bro
How to work around that? Build desalination plants powerd by Solar/wind to refill Lake Gatuin :)
'About precisely the same length as the Suez'. Inconceivable.
Could they use sea water to help with the lack of water? Maybe making the whole cannel to be at sea level?
Mexico has a good chance to do a "Pro gamer" move and build that railway, time will tell if corruption doesn't get in the way.
Wonder if there was a way to use seawater instead.  would have to isolate the canal from the lake somehow or create a whole new passageway.
" The lowest level ever recorded in Panama's entire history" since the 1950's right ? I guess Panama's history is larger than 73 years. I understand your concern but sometimes you exaggerate.
You'd think that the easiest fix would be circulating the water back, instead of flushing it out into the ocean. Perhaps if the world's merchants reliant on this canal pooled their resources together, a desalination plant (or two) capable of producing an offset might be the fix here.
I’ve never been so emotionally invested in maritime shipping
Solution: instead of fresh water, pump ocean water to replenish the lost water.  Solar energy is getting cheaper.  This is actually more of an energy problem.
I'm surprised you didn't cover any of the North American *existing* alternatives to the Panama route and other potential yet-to-be-built alternatives. For instance, the container port at Tacoma, WA has been the northwestern terminus of the northern railroads for over a century, and primarily serves as a container port for transfer between ships and trains. It also benefits from having a natural deepwater salt-water port (no dredging necessary), and is one of the deepest natural ports in the world.  Seattle also has a strong port capable of assisting with the transfer of containers. And the Salish Sea and Puget Sound are the pinnacle of safe harbors as a large body of saltwater surrounded on 3 sides, with a quarter of a state guarding it from the weather of the ocean, allowing absolutely huge numbers of ships to anchor safely for long periods of time.   Already some 70% of trade from China to the US comes through these western ports (LA and Vancouver as well), and are loaded on to trains for movement through the interior. Adding traffic to and from Europe on those rails would be trivial, rail is extremely efficient cost-wise like cargo ships, and arguably lowers liability for loss of goods while also impacting the environment much less (and has a very real possibility of being fully electrified in the near future).   Jon Talton, a columnist at the Seattle Times, has been writing on the Puget Sound ports for over a decade and has some great articles out covering these topics. There's a lot of focus on cargo staying in cargo ships, but tbh trains are just as effective and have many fewer downsides -- especially when so much of the goods on the seas are making their way between the US and China.   If tariffs with China were to drop, container traffic in west coast ports could explode and completely eclipse the importance of the Panama Canal.
I don't know why you thought it was acceptable to release this video with such bad audio
Two obvious solutions.  One pump the fresh water back into the canal instead of just letting it flow out to the oceans.  Two Finish the canal the way the French wanted to make the canal. By digging the passage to sea level.  Pick one and get it done.
The fresh water lake which supplies water for the Panama locks is drying up.
Stupid question but why don’t they just use the water from the ocean?😅
Mexico's interoceanic corridor will also give more geostrategic value to the island of Cuba, because all ships will have to pass through the bottlenecks that it forms when entering the Gulf of Mexico.
Video clearly delayed a little in publication.  Has just gone live but states "this year in 2023" ;-)  very interesting video indeed. Many thanks for the research that went into it.
Why are you pretending locks are unique to the Panama Canal? Locks are used all over the globe in canals.   It sounds like you've never heard of locks before and just learned the Panama Canal uses them like so many canals throughout the world. The Erie Canal of NY, for instance.
RLL you're spoiling us, it has only been three days since the last upload
"Lithium" and "Green Energy" don't belong in the same sentence unless it has the phrase "is not".
The increased number of ships using it would also increase the amount of water being used, adding to the problem
Why dont they just build tanks to store the water
2:30 01.01.2000 was not the start of the new millennium, that would be 01.01.2001
Panama canel when it's being neglected while influences higher shipping rates, "global warming is issue."  Nah America has weakest president in its history of politics. He's literally watching world burn.   Invest in our southern neighbors, before its too late!
Good grief, did you listen to this audio before you released this? Appalling quality. Unlistenable.
Why not use the water on both sides of the canal in the ocean. Seems like an easy solution. They are pouring fresh water into the ocean. That seems dumb. Just use the ocean
I listen to this and a simple large desalination plant providing free energy to Panama but pumping water 24/7 into the system coupled with fresh water recovery from the final sea locks would suffice paid for by global trade! But the issue is about panicking the people with this Climate change evils so the world has to suffer to stop the change !! UN con men at work again
Fix your audio man. It sounds like you are shouting into a $6 mic.
-1. They're not called Houthi and it's unclear who backs them. You're just blindly distributing D.C. propaganda. 0. Panama is not prosperous, it's per capita GDP seems high but then you look into the wealth and income distribution and realize it's a tax haven where a few millionaires and foreigners extract most of that $, similar to Ireland (but not as rich). 4. Mexico's corridor wasn't announced in 2020, it actually started construction in 2018 as soon as AMLO came to power, as it had been a proposal of his since at least 2012; And it's not going to be operational in the 2030s but this year (2024). In any case it's not a canal alternative: its goal is to produce value added goods in the country, not to just let cargo trough.
It feels like the gain is set to high on your microphone. Some words seem to be maxing out so the audio sounds a bit frayed.s
No pumps from one lock to another.  It's all gravity fed.
All those problems with shipping would have existed if our dear corporations wouldn't move all factories to another side of the planet, for cheap labor and higher profit margins.
damn weather!... its everywhere..🤷
For one ship, 52 million gallons of water raised 85 ft is 13.9MWh of energy. That's about as much as a single US home's annual energy consumption (10.6 MWh).   That energy normally comes from the rainfall, but theoretically, we could park a nuclear aircraft carrier at either end of the canal and use them to pump the lock water back up to Lake Gatun's level. (Which produce about 100MW of electrical power each, so 14 ships an hour or 120,000 a year. More than the 14,000 ships that went through last year.)
Even today, shipping by sea is still the most efficient. I can't imagine a land route Rivaling the Panama Canal.
Mexico spending 2.85$ billion for almost 200 km of railway, meanwhile Slovenia building Drugi tir (second track) from Koper to Divača (roughly 30 km) for over 800€ million… one third the cost for one sixth the length 🤦🏽‍♂️
The Bi-Oceanic corridor should contain (pun intended) a railway for the end to end freight
A rail system across Costa Rica should be considered. Port facilities at Limon and Puntarenas already exist. A railroad already exists across much of the country.
there’s a whole ocean and they used fresh water?? can someone more knowledgeable explain please?
Real Life Lore videos need a permanent TLDR in the comments section.
they should  have built rail roads instead.  they are much more efficient.
Well, I guess sending all or manufacturing overseas was a stupid idea.
Keep up the videos about Latin America
Wouldn’t a easy solution to lose much less water is for the last section before the ocean to have a pump that pumps the fresh water back to the lake I explained it really bad but if you get it I think that would be a perfectly fine solution unless I’m wrong
Stop with the climate change Bullshit
If we can't have a wall then we should expand down until we have the canal as a border
Nicaragua canal ?
Republicans: "See? Joe Biden's America!"
AnsarAllah are one of the best in humanity & Islam.
Bogota definitely one of the most interestingly placed capitols in the world.
Fun fact, Costa Rica had a trans-oceanic railway network connecting the Pacific with the Atlantic via trains, but it was discontinued in the 90´s for "financial" reasons and now the train only runs in the central valley area where 60% of Costa Rica´s population lives, leaving the rest of the line in disrepair.  To be honest, its shocking that the government is not seriously proposing fixing the rail line as a possible proyect, specially with the current events :(
What if, listen up, dig a canal from ocean to ocean, directly connecting them
2:29 new millennium info is misleading and incorrect. The new millennium started on the 1st January 2001. There was no year zero, the millennium started with 1CE.
We can't just Kobe shipping containers into space and have them parachute down to their destinations???
I have no idea if this is physically possible, but couldn't Panama build some sort of pumping system to lower the water level, with which they could keep the water ? Or is that too much water for pumps to handle reasonably ?
Skill issue, dig deeper canal
Why not install pumps to move the water from lock 1 back into the lake?
Once the artic melts permanently it'll be easier, except most food will be gone and global industrial civilization will be gone too.
I didn't expect this
Why cant they just install pumps to reuse the water instead of just dumping it into the sea?
Why not pump from the lower locks to higher ones rather than discharging to the oceans at the lowest ones?
Um so why not just use salt water? Like ocean water? That seems like such an easy fix...
Lets hope they dont end up shiping the gods by truck.
2 RealLifeLore videos in 1 week is just comfy man.
Lmao theres alot of newly minted engineers in the comments. My brain is getting smooth reading these recomendations.
I would love to watch your videos but the last few have had super harsh audio making it impossible to listen to...
Anyone else get terrible audio quality in the video?
They could use solar power, to pump back water.
Climate change is a Marxist hoax
Mexico and Honduras are looking to be country-wide dock. China will build it.
Why can't the pump seawater into the locks? Obviously it'd take some work but seems like a potential solution.
The Panama Canal Authority will always have at least one consistent and reliable customer, the United States Navy. The canal is the primary way the USN transfers warships from the Atlantic to the Pacific aside from its super carriers, which are too large for the canal. If it comes to a strategic military situation, the US  will come to the rescue to help foot the bill to upgrade and maintain the canal and fix the water problem.
Our Father is in Control 🛂.
Pump back to the lakes not to the Ocean. Genius :)
A PRC invasion of Taiwan would spell D☢️☢️MSDAY.  The utility of the Panama Canal would be irrelevant at that point.
One minor detail. You mention that they pump water into the fist lock from the second. Only this is not how it works. It is all operated by gravity. At the beginning of this century I was working for a firm that was building a rail and shipping facility that would take containers by rail from one end to the other to accommodate super max ships. Perhaps they will have to move ahead with this.
Don't normally comment on videos but what is wrong with the audio? It sounds like it's fluctuating in voice speed and there's no richness in the voice. Have you switched to AI voiceover? If so please dont, it sounds awful.
audio is weird in this episode. Sounds like your 15 feet away talking through a filter
What about the Northwest Passage?
The US literally already has a rail and road network that goes coast to coast and massive dockyards on both coasts. Why cant they just better utilise/improve that? Ridiculous that no one puts this forward as a solution/alternative.
If the next president Trump makes the coming border moat wide and deep enough… we might have a workaround.

I normally like your videos but the audio quality in this is is so bad that I had to stop watching.  It's distorted, thin, echoey, and very much lacking in the lower registers.
The water and the ship dropping should spin turbines to generate electricity which should pump the water back into the reservoir instead of the ocean before releasing the ship from the last gate No brainer  Prob solved  Get to work
Going up more displacement will have wasted more water, but going down it will save the same amount. So it doesn't matter how much load is in the ships, unless they take on load while in Panama. If anything, more load saves water because that requires less trips. Also, all they need to do, is change the lowest lock system to pump its water back up instead of just letting it run into the ocean. Such pumps exist and in the bigger picture installing such pumps is going to be a chip in the bucket compared to the cost and losses of a population starved from water and a canal that's not functioning anymore. The minimal amount of salt water that will wash in with the ships will not be so dramatic.
52 million gallons for one ship. I would like to ask that engineer at what point did this sound like a good idea.
Convert the Panama canal to Ocean water, stop using fresh water!!!!
I mean it was nice of Clinton to give it back… but everyone knew they couldn’t manage it alone.  Set them up to fail.
wait who is backing the Houthi?
...THIS ISNT DEATH, THIS IS AN *_OPPORTUNITY_* .....!!  ......YUP, THAT'S RIGHT.........  .....ABOUT *IT'S OBVIOUS THAT PANAMA CHANNEL MUST VE BEEN DEEPENED TO THE SEA LEVEL AND WIDENED AS MUCH AS SUEZ CHANNEL!!*  ......Y KNOW, PANAMA CHANNEL ALREADY *WAS* A CHOKEPOINT WITH IT'S TINSHEN DIMENSIONS............AND KIND OF NOW IT'S JUST ABOUT JUST BIT MORE OBVIOUS.........
I imagine once the North Pole melts away the arctic ocean will become the main shipping route.
I could understand the worth of Bi-Oceanic Corridor if it was a railroad, but relying on trucks? That still won't replace ships due to how much cheaper sea transport is compared to that, especially if the products carried are relatively low price to volume, like produce.
Another boring video we already know about the drought
I'm about a third of the way through, why couldn't the canal just use salt water?
So they need to collect the dump water. Desalinate and return to the top fill….
Reuse the water?????
is it only me or does to mic sound bad?
Man how I wish for long, detailed videos talking about some ongoing territory invasion. Just like I used to have during the first 6 months of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Truly a time, every week having a new video showing how the invader was about to really do something surely. I guess there's no interesting ongoing territory invasion worth talking about anymore.
Very open eyeing that they'd use precious fresh water for the canal. It would probably be better (but more expensive) to build a giant-ass tunnel instead. :o
Did they steal your microphone? Wtheck is this audio? I will still watch it but I´m used to better RLL :D
How much would it cost to pump the water back into the lake, instead of the ocean?
I'll be honest I never realized that the Panama Canal was actually a series of interconnected cambers and not just a straight shot from one end to another... I thought that brute forcing something like that was impressive, knowing that it's actually this complex series of cambers and water pumps makes it all the more impressive. I can't even imagine the sort of trail and error and balancing act all of that has to be.
Why do they have to use fresh water for the locks when sea water is so abundant?
I believe the United States should expand the Rio Grande and begin building a canal (or series of cascading hydroelectrical dams) starting a diversion at El Paso continuing along the Mexico-American border and ending south of El Cajon connecting the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico. It would solve the issue of the issue of the border crisis by creating a permanent separation and heavily guarded infrastructure between the U.S. and South America as well as provide either a quicker shipping route from the oil refineries of Texas or simply be able a massive amount of green energy by creating cascading dams.
Sounds like the canals need to be re engineered.
Need to invest that money back to canal to upgrade it and to pump water back not out in the ocean. Looks like they just take money from the canal and never invest back for dem upgrades.
What a thing, eh . . . Shipping is said to be the largest contributor to carbon emissions globally, thereby making it amongst and perhaps the largest contributors to the same climate change that is crippling the Panama Canal!!??!? What a thing.
Is the mic distoring are my airpods pro 2 faulty?
Why would lighter boats use less water?
Why don’t they just make another box or pipe line to pump it back into the lake?
This isn't minimising the issue, which is obviously real, but the narrative of too much rain, climate change, not enough rain, climate change is mental, as is attempting to extrapolate a trend from 70 years' worth of data on a planet that is 5 billion years old.
instead of draining the water down stream in to the direction of the path, could the rate of water usage be mitigated somewhat by draining the water laterally between the wells of the lanes traveling in the opposite directions?
Pump in water from ocean dedicated only for canal.
PUMPS! pumps right? Just pump the water back up.  Which is obvious, so would love to know why this wasn’t addressed!  In an otherwise great video!
From my understanding, limiting the amount of cargo that each ship is able to carry decreases the displacement of the ship.  This means that more water is actually needed to move the ship through the system (each lock has a finite volume and with lower displacement, more of that volume would need to be filled with water).  The decreased displacement helps with the ship traversing the lake which is shallow.  When there is a water shortage, ships are more likely to get stuck which would cause major delays and expenses.
Why don't they just pump the lake water back into the lake instead of pumping it in the ocean? I mean why don't they invest to modify it...
If Panama is so rich, why don't they get machines that separate salt from drinking water?
Wouldnt it be easier to build a rail system or highway along Columbia's coast, instead of going through mountainous terrain and wild forrests?
Why don't they just pump seawater into the first 2 locks
Why I know travel by boat is cheaper but couldn't America just use road to travel from east to west or west to east in case of emergency?🤔🤔🤔
Could they not use salt water?
Bad year for international trade indeed
Shipping itself as a means of global mass transportation is dying. Evergreen, the Houthis, Panama... The routes can hardly be kept operational. If I were an inventor I'd start figuring out how to take the business airborne for roughly the same price as shipping.
both an easy and long-term fix is why not instead of draining the water out to sea just from each level the ship goes up have them just regrain the water back into the lakes. for both the first gate when entering and the last before exit and have supports for the ships on exit to hold it up until the sea water can fill. and rinse repeat
Not enough water for the Locks due to climate change. The solution? A bunch of highways...for trucks....to keep the treats in motion. Amazing
Why are they using FRESHWATER!!!!
Y wouldn’t they just pump the water from one side of the canal to the other so u don’t have to waste any water..or just pump it back up to the lake instead of just dumping it into the ocean 🤦🏽‍♂️
what about the north west passage? Can't ships go there
Doesn't sound like the canal is dying, just undergoing a regular climate event which affects its water supply.
Some of the footage did not match what you were talking about and seemed misleading
Obviously, it would be expensive, but does anyone know if Panama has considered pumping the water back to the lake when draining the lower locks instead of dumping the fresh water into the ocean?
And why does it need to be "fresh" water??
Why dont they just dig a long 192km trench (of sufficient height and depth in that mexico plan), fill it with thick layer concrete, make it so that every 50 or so meters there is an elevation of half a meter in height (so water flows from one end to other by gravity), and keep pumping sea water from the higher side. Ships basically have to travel a gentle upstream and there's no limit to sea water. Maybe to balance it out do this again from the other side so that there wont be any rapid sea level rise......i thought of this on a whim but want to know why this wont work out
East side, west side, whatever side that you're on.  As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.  Don't sweat what you might get by assuming the other side as a threat. Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.  East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.  We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free.  We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair.  Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along!!
Your videos are consistently way too long now.
Strange how whenever UK (Suez) and Panama (USA) give ownership of the canals back to the locals they don’t maintain them, ruin them and show why they shouldn’t be controlling them.
Why can't they just use sea water?
IDK if it's been addressed but there's some problems with the mic, sounds like your sat too far away maybe? Not the end of the world but thought I'd mention it.
Is it me or is the audio harsh? 🤔
The houthis it's not a major military thing backed by Iran It is a freaking terrorist group It is attacking ships cargo ships that's going through that area every day and that is why the UK and the US are attacking the houthis
I do not understand why they cannot pump salt water from the ocean.
New vid!
LOOKEY LOOKEY WHAT WE HAVE HEREE 😈😈 A CHIPPER YOUNG LAD SPREADING BAFOONERY ON MY TERRITORY?! 🤣 STEP ONE FOOT IN VERMONT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 🤭
Is this an AI version of you speaking?
Bet you that cape horn economy is poppin rn tho 😅
The bi-oceanic corridor is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. Anyone who knows anything about logistics knows that floating goods is 10-15x cheaper than running them via truck, not to mention it would probably barely be any quicker, and miles less fuel-efficient. Also, it would take years to build the infrastructure, probably upwards of a decade.  Side note: anyone who thinks lithium ion batteries are going to power the green revolution is not a serious person. They're fine for local, small-scale projects; but to make that happen at scale, we'll need an entirely new battery tech and associated materials science. There has been a recent breakthrough with solid-state batteries that is potentially quite exciting, though.
I'd have thought that the water goes back and forth between the locks and the lake. I didn't expect them to just pump millions of gallons of fresh water into the damn ocean.
Why don't just pump back the water to the lake, instead of dumping it into the sea?
In my opinion the easiest thing to do is just to build reservoirs along the locks. This is what the (admittedly smaller) locks on the Rhein-Main-Donau Kanal in Germany do. Since they don't have much water entering the canal at its highest point when a ship wants to go down through a lock they simply pump all the water into a concrete tank. When a ship wants to go back up they pump the water back up into the lock. It uses basically zero water and solves the problem.
Wouldn’t a train track be more efficient because as it can carry a lot more tons then a truck can?
You are reporting with lightning speed !!!
i notice that you say everything twice, just in a different way, makes your videos too long, boring and i cant get thru a whole one, i wonder if its just me that thinks this.
Why don't they pump in ocean water?
They could decrease the water consumption by pumping it back in to the first two locks from the output/ocean
Is it me or the loudness is too high? The audio is saturating
Capitilism killing the earth as usual.
What about charging ships a desalination fee to cover the cost of Desalinating the ocean water. Since it is expensive it would jack up Canal fees but unless they want to go around they have to pay up.
Pump (some) of the fresh water back up instead of dumping it into Ocean.
Just a thought, if you need something, buy it now.   If this gets bad, you won't be able to.
God almighty, buying stuff is aboutta get expensive as hell💀💀
Why can’t they get water from the sea?
Trinidad and Tobago is NOT part of Venezuela and we seek the Queens English 😂😂. Why do youtubers keep adding us to their maps 😂😂
dude, the videos showing people cleaning up the shore are not from gatun lake but from the ocean coast. water is so low because panama has unusually strong tides. pretty missleading. also the point about only lighter ships are being let through (12:55) makes no sense. heavier ships should in fact be prioritized as they the water being displaced by them is not lost when letting ships transit through. a more logical reason for not letting heavy ships through is that their draft is to deep considering that the lakes water level is now 3 mts lower than usual, i.e. its a safety issue, not a water management issue. Also I still dont understand how the "risk of introducing salt water to lake nicaragua" is supposed to work, I remember this being a concern voiced  during a tv talkshow  by an environmental "engineer" that clearly thought osmosis was way stronger than it really is. By his logic lake Gatun should also be a briney lake and it clearly is a sweet water lake. hell by that logic we should be wonderin how rivers dont taste salty
I'm just wondering how in the hell Iran get so many supplies to the houthis. I would be very surprised if Saudi or Oman would let them use ways through them
El Nino/La Nina cycles are normal, the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia has already said that El Nino is likely ending in February to April and we will probably see La Nina sometime between June and August.
Maybe a railroad to facilitate container traffic would work.  Of course, they would need another boat in the other side, but a big company could facilitate that in Panana.
cLiMaTE ChANgE!
Something is different about your audio, and not in a good way.
Something different about the audio, got a new mic and not quite dialed in yet? Lower quality then usual.
5:00 "The wars in the middle east will eventually end" are you sure about that
Or we could revitalize our train infrastructure and ship overland to avoid the Canal.  But hey, who needs trains, right?
Great video. But did it really need to be 36 mins long?
Going through the Drake Passage is not only longer, its way, way more likely to sink your ship. There's a reason it was feared by mariners of past.
Worth mentioning that the canal is useful and can save millions of $ (and many, many lives of crew members) because Cape Horn is the most dangerous and vioent stretch of ocean on the planet. Many ships that go through there face unreal waves (sometimes surpassing 15-20 meters of height) that travel very fast and are incredibly steep that badly damage the ships and their cargo if they are container carriers, without mentioning the enormous weight that the ice adds to them, as water is sprayed by the waves and immediately frozen all throughout the ships, making them very unstable and prone to sinking.  The clash of the currents from the Southern Ocean with the South Atlantic combined with the immensely powerful winds create some of the most unique and destructive waves on the planet.  Once you go in, you can't turn around, you simply have to proceed. The weather can go from extremely bad and dangerous to straight up deadly in a matter of minutes with no warnings.  The horrific stories that many seafarers have to tell about that passage are heart wrenching to say the least, many of them thought they wouldn't make it out alive because the conditions were just SO bad.  So yeah, it is a very dangerous place to go through, you really do NOT want to go through that passage unless you absolutely have to.
damn even mother nature can't handle modern day politics
If they had giant water storage facilities,, then they could recycle the water.  They could also recycle sewage to supply water to the locks.  Probably massive underground storage allowing water recycling is the only way to operate at full capacity.
The canal uses salt water from thr oceans. Who care if it rains. So idiotic
TLDR?
Wait Climate change?   Omfg its militant groups doing militant things. Exactly fuck all to do with climate change.
Why is the audio so bad and sped up
Why does it sound like you are speaking through a cup
Every time I hear el Niño it reminds me of Bill Nye the science guy show.
6:56 This is a dumbass design decision. Why pump the water back into the ocean? Just pump it into big storage tanks or pump it back up to the lake. Problem solved. Dumping it back into the ocean is dumber that a rock. If there are concerns about contamination, just build a water cleansing plant to make sure the water is compatible with the lake.
Oh dear! How did humanity exist before international trade and shipping?! We actually might have to be more self reliant and make stuff again?
Are nuclear powered desalination plants a realistic possibility to power the canal instead? Drinking water could also come from it as well, greatly reducing the consumption of water from the lake. And on top of it, nuclear energy is by far the strongest way to combat climate change which has led to this whole problem to begin with.
*I can’t help but think that as much as I like the new 30min/ hour-long weekly videos by RLL (almost completely on Geogpolitics now), I really at times miss the old-style RealLifeLore 6-12min educational videos (2016-21 ones) with those colourful animated thumbnails, colourful maps, diagrams & animations, the wonderful music tracks by BrandonMaahs, Toyota Corollas & the ‘This video is made possible by’…so many memories with those ones.* 😌
Well, this is what happens when people dont listen to scientists and also the huthies arent actually called huthies their actually called Ansar Allah which like Hezbollah in Lebanon, their not Iranians or Iranian backed proxies they are indigenous yemenis, they have created a defacto government ( if I spelled that right) where about to percent of the yemani population live. A bunch of western propaganda and its much more complex than what they actually are telling us and imperialism relies on ignorance and let me tell you the houthis are not terrorists the reason why their attacking is the war in gaza because to stop ships from going to Israeli are blocked. Americas military is starting to get stretched to its limits
Only true RLL fans can like this comment

Interesting that the Houthies are doing this so Humanitarian Aid can get to the people in Gaza, while there are an estimated 20 Million people in Yemen who are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.
My Like 818th
Well there also a border crisis going on in Texas, so why not nail 2 birds with 2 stone and make a “Border Canal” to separate Mexico and The US, while also creating a new sea route that can make its money back more than a mere wall ever could?
Another 1? Wowza, that was quick 😮!
We just need to finish digging it and forget the stairs.
In short, can't use a water canal if you don't have water
looks more like a dumpster than a lake....
It's crazy both the Suez canal and Panama canal are both suffering rn. It's actually terrifying for the global economy :(
Just finished watching a video 12mins ago Amazing content! The quick turnaround shows how much grasp you have on current global affairs

So the canals abusing the water not climate change
The proper pronunciation is "Who tee" like Houthi and the Blowfish.😂😂
The audio quality is absolutely horrific 😭
The nicaragua project will never happen. It would end up destroying one of the largest fresh water lakes on earth and would be one of the worse ecological disastors that ever happen in history.  Also china no longer has the money or will for insane vanity projects. especially in foreign nations.
its worth pointing out how january  to february is the driest part of the year in panama.

so much lore atm
Only 36 minutes?! I'm disappointed.
The audio seems really wonky, like you're talking through wax paper or something.
Imagine if a rebel group took over land near for example the panama canal and the blockaded it
biggest eff up was giving the canal to Panama
it's pronounced more like lake gatoon but is spelled gatun
I love how even with all the confusing war and politics, mother nature is somehow a harder thing to understand and handle 😭
Last
I went through the Panama Canal the other day. Excursion for a cruise. When we went through it was 2 ferries, a small sail boat and a large gargo ship. We used the old locks.
Me learning about lore in real life:
I’m ready to watch this video 😊
Great content but the audio is rough
Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec will be Panama Canal's replacement. Aside from Mexico, Argentina and Chile could benefit this scenario by making ships pass through the Strait of Magellan.
I think we should have a large canal that goes from the east to west coast of America.
UK and France loses the Suez Canal:  WAAH WAAH WE ARE A BUNCH OF IMPERIALIST ELITIST TWERPS WAAAH  USA gives away the Panama Canal:  We are the True Harbingers of The Revolution and are generous as such!!!
I know it's a minor point to the video, but the Houthis are not a military faction.  They are an ethnic group.  They are firing on shipping through the Red Sea because most of the West is either accepting or supporting the Saudi's war against them.  The State Department designating them as a terrorist group is an endorsement of genocide.
It's almost like every region of earth is at the brink of WW3, these videos got me sweating fr😅
