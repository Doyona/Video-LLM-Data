9:42 made me laugh so hard I had to pause to literally roll on the floor 😂
9:42 made me laugh so hard I had to pause to literally roll on the floor 😂
Jerry really needs a raise.
Can they survive hand sanitiser
Great video other than the language and sexual jokes. I was showing my children so they can learn. I was disgusted by the language that I had to hope my kids didn't hear or understand. After a while, I just shut it off. You can make the same content without being inappropriate for children
Winners of the most beautiful feces in nature.  I was going to say "most beautiful shit in nature," then I realized how much being literal made the statement ironically unclear.
1:19  this made me giggle  2:30  This too
Someone pls draw tardigrade on moss couch in therapy
"getting very dead" .. I SPEAK SCIENCE! I UNDERSTOOD THAT!  :)  fun video. .oh and THEYRE SO CUTE I COULD DIE!!!!
Scientist think they come from space ...on a meteorite......😮
That's graphic isn't it... But that IS how a tardigrade do
Dear jerry.... Are tardigrades everywhere? In my drinking water. Or in my bathtub? Or in my body fluids?
Like POV pornography. Nice. Can you stop thinking about sex long enough to make a video? Perv!
Omg! Roger the alien is a tardigrade, it explains his golden jewel encrusted 💩
Our galaxy was shat out by a cosmic moss piglet.
I know this is a bit late to tell you, but in lockdown your tardigrade video got me and my children out to reanimate moss piglets. We achieved it with a microscope, and built core memories which endure even now. I love you; thank you for teaching me with remarkable humour. You are incredible and helped me make core memories. Keep doing what you are doing, because you’re the embodiment of joy and learning xxx
I'm going to start calling my wife an egg filled skin bag.
Just found your channel. WOW! Oh my do I ever wish I had you as a teacher growing up!! There will never be enough thanks given for all that you do but sincerely thank you! Awesome, funny, educational, really wonderful stuff and I've only just watched this one episode. AMAZING on so many levels for so many reasons! This world needs more teachers like you!!!
So.. we could, theoratically, shoot a "dust" of tardigrades into space and if/when they land on a "suitable" planet, they could just keep on living. We could make the first invasive species for the universe! ... wait. Maybe that's how they came to us. Or their ancestors.
4:39 ‘mouth holes’ are def the scientific term 😂 I vote for ‘eye holes’ too
omg, I laugh so hard,  thank you !!
ZeFrank..... the love child of David Attenborough and Jimmy Carr. Love ya  man.
1:08 WHAT  DID  YOU  JUST SAY.
"Science isn't a style of photography, Jerry," might be my favorite gag in the series yet. Along with that endearingly janky balls-in-a-bag-with-a-kitchen-strainer-mouth model
Figure out a way to put that moss piglet toy together without staples and I would definitely get one.
"Science isn't a style of photography, Jerry!" 😂😂😂
Tardigrades poop galaxies 😂
When you said that it loooks like a galaxie, it made me think about Men in black and the cat’s leash. So maybe they are popping galaxies.
We need a lore drop on this Zefrank - David Attenborough beef
'Think masturbation with consequences'  - strikes terror in every teen tardigrade ever😅
One other weird thing is they have evolved into basically only the head portion of their past body design. I don't know of many other creatures that thought this would be a good idea?
Doritos individually wrapped in glass. You know what, they'd never go stale.
This is one of my favorite, and lets be real, Jerry, they're all my favorite..
At this level of survival
As the tardigrade filmed pooping I want to say that I did not give permission for my likeness to be used.
Cryptobiosis is the universe saying: keep doing what you do, no matter what, even if you die. Just keep doing it. You are important. ❤
I wish I'd had Ze Frank as my high school, or even college professor👨‍🎓
Really ANNOYING narrator!
He’s only mostly dead. Anyway, have fun storming the castle.
"Science isn't a style of photography."  Tell that to any "I f***ing love science" group online. 99% of it is just deep space photography.
Dehydrate the masses.....
The oribeez in the hair dye glove with the spout connector.. I swear to God I am literally dead... 💀💀💀💀 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jerry tries her/his best to improve the videos time and time again and what does s/he get for the trouble? Scolding! Zefrank would be _NOTHING_ without Jerry, I tells ya! *_NOTHING!!_*
Our planet's life insurance😮
Saw this back when it was first posted and it still makes me smile/snirk/giggle. So much happy appreciation for these videos! \o/ ✨❣✨
3 body show!!
I would love to see a video of my face when I'm watching a Ze Frank video. I'm pretty sure I always have the same horrified-fascinated-delighted look for every one of them!
This is the best video I’ve watched all year. Thank you!
Were you inspired by BaronJ?? There's a very similar tone and joke style that he used in his old videos, as well as a side character named Jerry!! The coincidences are endless!!
My earliest memory is being poked in the eye......lol.....traumatized me before I was born...
Most of the footage reminds  me of Spore the video game, prolly the inspiration behind the cell stage. Funny that.
Could almost be called a dust mite, as it's essentially dust that becomes a mite when you add water, or sperm.
I used to snack on these as an embryo.
these things terrify me for some reason
can they be selectively bred so i can have a giant pet tardigrade living in my pond? like perhaps the size of a rat
Its not a style of photography, but maybe it should be 😂
Gmo them an opposable thumb and they will soon rule the world
Octopus+Vodka+manatee
How are the tardigrades they turned loose on the moon? 🤔
😂 this is too much… ok some more
❤😂😅❤
🤣😆 so funny
Mmm.  Have any good recipes?
How can anyone look at the astounding complexity and order of life on earth and still think "yup, this all came about from an explosion."
“No we can’t sell that as merch, Jerry. There are staples in it!”  That line fucking sent me
Yeah, hence why I named My band the Tardigrades. We have passed the age of 60, but still pops up alive after many years. Rock'n'Roll never dies !
these would make a great monster (just make um a bit bigger)
Very very cool 😎
Okay so let's start our own mossy bear farm
The music only detracts from this information.
POV pornography LOL
Take that Unicorns. Tartigrages actually do shit rainbows  They're crystals but still, they're rainbow crystals!
I feel bad for swallowing lake water now. I ate these adorable micro-gummie bears.
“Science isn’t a style of photography, Jerry” is such an amazing line
I like Jerrys art here😂❤
Rotifers are some of my favorites! Can we get a whole video on them?
Yay!
Great video. What size microscope would you say is needed to see Tardigrades?
How the hell were these things discovered?
Checks out.
'temperatures below -270°C' lol.  not a lot of temperatures left below that mate -273.15°C is absolute zero
I want a video where Jerry is allowed to get away with all of his shenanigans. Ending with a statement of, “And that’s just how a Jerry do.”
But how does a Tardigrade do? :)
Plot twist; You are actually a Tardigrade, that has augmented itself with the body of a human. Controlling it safely from the brain, pooping little galaxies in it.
These are so quotable and I want so many t-shirts of some. Parthenogenesis: it’s like masturbation with consequences.
I... love you--
10:40 So dark and hilarious. Pure Ze.
I now want a tiny, moss cup couch for my therapy sessions
Such a strange, wonderful mind 😊
This is how the tardigrade do.
What if some got loose in Space & landed on a distant planet where they continued to grow in the vastness? There could be a planet full of giant Tardigrades that will one day return to earth to rule us all!!!
So there poop has living things in it too? And do those poop and also have living things? When does the pooping stop?!
Better than Sea Monkeys!
I want one!
Worlds smallest Cutest creature.
What if we're this small to something else?
Jerry's in rare form on ths one!
“Masturbation with consequences”😂😂😂 yes!
2:34 *J*
They have 5 fingers just like us!
I want a microscope so badly right now so I can find some these adorable little moss piglets
Entertained, horrified, & educated simultaneously. Rah.
Seeds of life scattered throughout the universe by an ancient and otherworldly civilization
"Can't sell that as merch".... Trust me, if a minecraft youtuber can sell a bodypillow's image on the image of a mug, on an image on a bodypillow then you can also sell a tardigrade lookalike bodypillow.
😂 funny as hell
The CS ad just sent me 🤣 So great!
What if we're just tardigrade poop
You forgot to mention they can survive terminal velocity and being shot out a gun. Legit only way scientists found they could kill it is by hitting it with a hammer. Those mofos survive ANYTHING
YAY I LOVE WATER BEARS
is our galaxy just the poop of a gigantic tardigrade?
I must regularly watch moss piglet do the dog paddle. Otherwise I am sad.
My partner doesn't lay eggs
Ze Frank is my favorite channel on youtube!!!
Tardigrades are the cutest microscopic critters that I know of.
“No we can’t sell it as merch there’s staples in it!!”
I say, Jerry is a masterful artist.
I can't poop crystals, I mean there are surely some crystals in there but they're not crystals as a majority. That actually sounds painful and or somehow magical but I can't poop crystals like a tardigrade. I think I might be thankful for that or somehow disappointed. I'm not sure. I'm going to weep openly now in my uncertainty😭
Tardigrades those perverts
These get cooler everytime I learn about them :D
0:35 schmooth, we gotta a Stewie wanna be here, lmao.
Tardigrades are so chubby and dinky looking. Like clawed little hazmat-suited bugs.
Now that I have seen the wired talk from a while ago re:buzz feed, I have to ask - has that studio of creation come to fruition? If so, how can I explore my options there?  And, as far as the vid that led into it (being alone) the best advice I ever got was actually made popular by Nike: just do it.  It is understood that failure is scary, and to avoid failure, you aim for ‘good’. If you want to stand out, you will take the risks and fail, repeatedly… and then fail more until one day, you have a pseudo comrade named Jerry.  And yes, caught the seed that became a beet farm in later broadcast media.  And, I just finished placing a nice point on my favorite pencils that I really like to hold.
The sticky-toed variety have toes that actually work just like crested gecko toes, down to the flipping capabilities :D
The voice over sucks. The video is great.
Hahahaahahahahaagaaaaaaa "Masturbation with consequences "terrifies me
Yes, I am amused and I learn so much. I wish teachers knew how to do this.
11:21 I would buy that
4:19 me eating doritos at 1am: *makes this comment*
aww, god blass jerry's liddle heart for trying to be part of the science. just think of all that work he put into those tardigrades to try and fool Ze Frank. well done jerry, bravo
5:38  what if our whole universe is just a giant cosmic tardigrade poop
Like how they have little feet.  Like Jerry’s little hamsters.
This is the most hilarious series of nature videos I have EVER seen! Never stop!
If you're feeling sad or down, watch a video by Ze Frank! 😆 It makes you happy and makes you laugh!😂 Thanks!!
10:53 Incredibly graphic for me, since I once had a sunburn that was so bad, when it started to heal I could peel my skin like a wet t-shirt off my back. I am lucky to not have skin cancer. Or at least, I don't think I do. I'm nearly 28 now and don't have any reason to think I have it. I did get a bunch more freckles on my back after that burn. I'll never forget it.
I did not know that Tardigrades were crystalline critters.
More micro! Love it 😂
That was soooooo good
A video with no bips!! yeah!!!
5:37   ...well I can make a pretty good Tikka masala that turns into poop?
Evolution: "youre extra durable and can survive drying out for decades, as well as extreme heat, cold, radiation, and the vacuum of space"  Tardigrades: "That means we're also immune to predators, right?"  Evolution:....  Tardigrades (nervously): "......right?"
my friend sent me here, I need to thank her. Oh, also, you got 1 subscriber.
Crude and disgusting narration mixed in with good information completely unnecessary and immature
I cannot trust any life form that enjoys a kale flavored capri sun. Not even for Jerry. 😜  "Think masturbation with consequences. I told you theyre perverts". We need that on a shirt Jerry!
"There's David Attenborough...show off."  Sometimes it pays to watch the ads
Maybe not this exact video but absolutely this channel, is by far the best channel on YouTube!
Absolutely love it 😂
This is the aliens from the three body problem 😂
I hope Jerry was given a good talking to off camera and a pay cut!
He’s like the white Morgan freeman
I don't want to come back as a tardigrade. Masturbations with consequences would be financially ruinous for me
the universe being created by giant tardigrades is now my headcanon, thank you.
I was asked about this creature in my university entrance exam.
Masturbation with consequences lol
I think you have a legit clinical faecal fetish.
Who the f drinks a Glass of Gatorade?!
amusing oral backup..
Stop playing dicky dicky in the sand… what does it mean!!!
"They can reproduce by themselves! Think masturbation with consequences." 🤣🤣
Our entire universe was shat out by a ginormous water bear
Like masturbation with consequences lmao 💀 simply brilliant narration
You remind me of Mr. Peabody from the cartoon
wow!
They poop mini galaxies
Looks like a galaxy???!! What if we were just poop from a God-sized Tardigrade???
Highly informative and hilarious. You keep doing you cause your really doing us.  A favor 😉
Their eyes are “eye spots” and not eyeballs because their eyes are made up of one, singular photoreceptive cell.
Parents: Be prepared to explain "masturbates" to your kids who watch this video. Others: it's a great segment.
Y'all are funny. ❤
To this day, I'm still waiting for someone to make s little compilation video of all the moments Jerry decided to be silly.
this guy is a nonce.
Battle-leap-us moves like Stitch ❤️ 3:13
I watch this channel more than I watch Netflix . I seriously can’t stop . I just get high , and blast thru 40 videos 😂😂😂
What is a scientist? Stick with Science Hippy! Gets me every time :D
I thought the only thing missing is you coulda showed how small species of tardigrade are a fair bit smaller than some larger single celled organisms and can actually be eaten by them!
what if we're living in cosmic tardigrade  poop
water bear sloppy 🔥
Ya, 'cause evolution. 🤣🤣🤣
I wish these lived in our bodies. I would love to be a moss piglet taxi.
"like masturbation with consequences" BRO I'M DYING
9:30  Me: welp.... I guess we know where life came from
I'm way too high for what happened at 5:40
I wonder if they have a relationship with the forming of quartz crystals? So curious!
Thanks!
Even the smallest creatures are made interesting thanks to Ze Franklin. Thank you for this!
This was just so enjoyable
Phylum: Tardigrada Class: Eutardigrada Didn't know them before this video.
Fun fact: kale-flavored capri sun is banned by the Geneva Convention
Dutlniv tioogattlyg
I can’t be the only one who thinks tardigrades are super cute, right? :3
I'm not a prude in any way, but it should be said that this video is absolutely awesome taken out all the sexual references... there's too many and watching it all becomes tiresome.  Its a shame that content of such good level can't be used to teach kids...
I'm firmly convinced that tardigrades and slime molds are alien species. Seriously. They're both so weird, compared to other Earth life.
Allow me to throw in some spicy topic.   All these micro-organisms= Life Fetus (according to pro-choice)= No Life
Also, given the way they reproduce, wouldn’t you agree if you’re “born dumb you gotta be tough”?
I describe others as “shitting bricks” but water bears figure out how to do this eloquently by “shitting crystals”
As a child I saw a tartigrade in a magazine they horrified me, now I find that they still terrify me
Why do you keep calling him Jerry? ;O)-
I love how the creature’s’ name in my language is “Bear animal”
It’s real Tardigrade hours, who up?
all joking aside, i had no idea these little critters are that adorable and awesome
Tardigrades are so cool. Jerry is like a retardigrade
Gay=dead has to be the wildest form of homophobia I’ve ever seen. 😂😂
Marvel Comics Galactus can eat a planet, but he can't crap a galaxy. Tardigrade can though, 'cuz Tardigrade don't give a fvck...
Amazing content, been watching for years. What is the song at the end
"Science isn't a style of photography Jerry!" 😂
"PASS."
6:52  reminds me of the Cosmic Microwave Background image, only its galaxy looking crystal poop and Tardigrade. Cheers pal x
"it's kinda like if your partner gets a sunburn and then your first instinct is to... Wait, that's too graphic" Too fucking late.
what if the whole universe was just a tardigrade shit
Well that solves the question of where galaxies come from,  they are pooped out by tardigrades. 😂
Tardigrades are seriously the best
The fake micrograph with the "small" scale is genius. Absolutely hilarious.
If you drink freshwater, does that mean they are inside you and living there?
Almost two years already ?  Wow. That went by quickly.
Truly facinating, and funny
Frank, I need more!  Please! We will pay you for more videos!
Big bang = tardigrade shitting
You are friggin hilarious! And I don’t care what my Brain Witch says, I believe everything you say is Fact. Or is that factual. See now, she’s all in my head! 😝
"Masturbation with consequences" 😂😂😂
What an informative and CUTE video! I love the little water bears!
It's like masturbation with consequences. OMFG! ROFLMAO!!!
You have such a soothing and consistent voice. What sort of vocal exercises do you do before recording a video? Any tips on how to maintain a consistent vocal tone throughout an entire recording? I really look to your videos as references when practicing my voice-over voice, but I'm still too nervous to start a vocal portfolio.  I also love the amount of research you put into these True Facts videos. Thank you for educating and entertaining us all!
I’ve yet to find one of these that doesn’t make me laugh to tears!
Parthenogenesis. Think masturbation with consequences. I'm dead
11:00 the skin fic
I used to work in a parisitology lab, we found a tardigrade in dog poop once, best day I had at that place
Smuthe
That shade he threw at Attenborough was great ☠
Love these videos! Wish I could show them in my high school zoology classes; some of the phrases would get me in trouble.
"think masturbation with consequences" had me nearly gag on my breakfast
Why are you not on Joe Rogan!
' smeeeyoooove'   this bot has waaay too much diction
There's all the nutrients over him the back body is the pharynx
Oops that's embarrassing runaway runaway tardigrade in genius batelipus however
I can use microscopy
It's not real
Jerry that one made of poop
Most have two little eye spots there have limited
Beautiful like a galaxy
Don't mess with a moss piglet
Don't teach you dad dragon school
Tardigrade he's of the mess
Oops that was embarrassing runaway runaway
Tardigrade don't give a crap
A very good example of how life could traveled extraterrestrial
Can you imagine how fucking cool it would be if you could pour boiling water onto a mummy and have it rehydrate like ramen and just come back to life?
You never disappoint Zefrank! Another epic educational video to ensnare my senses!
What if we’re all living inside and our galaxy is just the shiny insides
So our galaxy is tardegrade poop on cosmic scale
Wonder if they survive being Digested
cool!
Fact that these things are related to Opabinia from the Cambrian makes so much sense given how bloody weird both are
dang i wish i was a tardigrade
I think Jerry is Frank's imaginary friend. Like when you were 3 and you broke something and you were an only child but you didn't do it.
🤣💙love these so much
Tardigrade are kinda studio ghibli-y
Well produced, well explained, and the humor, OMG! I love this channel!
I wonder how many survived the Israeli spacecraft crash? If they happened to burrow down into the surface of the crash landing site, and stumbled across some water they very easily could have started a colony.   Just think,  the moon may be inhabited by water bears.
This information was presented in hilarious fashion.
4:15 5:11 5:30
Parthenogenesis: masturbation with consequences 😂
never heard "moss piglet" before.....heard "water bear"...
That reproduction description was hilarious 😂
I think Jerry is owed money from StarTrek Discovery
Fascinating maybe they came from space - kidding, sort of
"They are essentially a fluid-filled sack." Same, same.
" No we can't sale that as merch Jerry, there's staples in it." 😂
The fact that their poop looks like galaxies is amazing.
Best sponsor ad ever
1:25 Absolutely dying at the scale bar that just says “small”
"There's David Attenborough. Show off."
Man I really wanna try that curiosity stream!
"They're basically water filled sacks"... Umm, so are we...  *: )*
1:16 that looks like it's got the Megadeth skull face!  With a gasmask filter upfront!
So Tardigrades are the only things left, if everything on Earth dies??  That's cool.
I'm here to tell you all.....  Tardigrades have been known to snuggle for pleasure (not that kind Jerry! That's naughty! Oh you said pillow farts. Well that's perverted Jerry. Didn't ze have this conversation with you already?)
True fact about me:  The grooves that hold in my kneecaps are half a millimeter deep. I've known this for about a year, but it didn't truly hit me until zefrank told me just now that my kneecap grooves are the same size as microscopic organisms -_-
"Mstrbtion with consequences" I died.
Fun fact, moss piglet is what I call my child.
Me eating... Zefrank: now imagine if your partner had sunburn... Me no longer eating
I learnt something and laughed a lot 😂
Ichiro Hiruma liked this video
He has always this morbid amused tone when he has to address or explain some sexual stuff. Like this bit of innuendo, that i dont know if i find it hilarious or creepy.
Sometimes at night I wonder… have I ever eaten a tardigrade?
if science classes were done like this video, we'd have many more smarter kids 😂
Egg filled skin bag.  I never thought of myself that way before.
Oh my gosh I'm dying.
What if our universe is the poop of a tardigrade?
Can the immune system kill them when they get into wounds ?
“Tardigrade don’t give a crap” OMG! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 this guy is so hilarious I am hooked!! Been watching now for hours 😱 Cheers
I love you #zefrank1 ❤
"don't just put it in black and white"
Is Jerry real, or just a figment of zefrank1's imagination?
Tardigrades are just so charming, how they're the most animal like microscopic animal. Like there are other microscopic animals but they aren't chubby with two eyes and grabby legs.
the way he said "are not smewth"
A tartigrade starred in an episode of Star Trek Discovery.
Tardigrades are awesome
Yes
I come here cuz im not banned
Discovered this channel today and not only learned a shitload of new useless facts, but also feel considerably less depressed than before. Thank you.
I can't deal with how cute the eye spots are.
What if every universe is a moss piglet poop...
"Think masturbation with consequences."  That line got me.  As if being legally blind and having to shave my palms everyday wasn't enough.  And don't get me started on those damned angels giggling at me every time....
They 💩 out galaxies , what can you do?!?! 🤣
Sold it in tick tock it's totally great it's too late to the great can die it's so hard here true grace R real life real life it is it is it is it to frighten is it isn't it a free tour it'll be excessive it's about something something get this happened in this preacher it's been in this preacher this furniture survived
Chair waves chair praise this soon is so hot this unit is so hard to kill it's so harder it's so harder it is disspecific specific research groups coming in the and it in the snow and then no in the swim anything lost like that
Poor Jerry 🤗🍁🇨🇦🐘
You are hilarious  And super smart You are appreciated!!! Found you from Thoughy2 Glad I did .)
"Here's a tardigrade in the genus It's Hideous" LOL, nope, that's not what he said, but that's what I heard! ROFL...
.                                       "I don't feel tardi."                                                   ---- David Lee Roth  .
This one was so funny as always, you are a light in this world~
theyre soooo cute if we could change they're face 😊
I am a tardigrade. And yes, my poop is like a jewel-studded little galaxy. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Look at this poop.  Now our sponsor.
Jerry really cracked me up in this one. brilliant job guys. I find these so informative (with a bit of fun thrown in)
This looks like Spore
I just found the best YouTube Channel out there
Love this guy. Funny and interesting at the same time. I like to think Jerry is a Labrador Retriever like Olive and Mabel.
scale bar says "small" made my day
I've found this channel and love it.  And I love the happiness too learning.  You my man ,are funny also..l 😁
youtube can make learning fun
Mate - you are bloody funny and very educational too. A real pleasure to watch and learn from. Thanks. Bebbies indeed!
Bwahahahaha 😂 god damn he's so funny
Is there anyone who can tell me that what kind of microscope shall I use to see tardigrades?
Jerry needs a girlfriend.
The Tardigrade is immortal, like the Mother in Law.
In the novel "It,"  giant turtle claimed the Universe was created because he sicked it up. But the crystal footage makes me wonder it it didn't come out the other end of a cosmic Tardigrade (Or would that be Turdigrade?) certainly explains a lot.  Let's see someone do a SCP-001 proposal for THAT.
Thank you for the new tardigrade video.  Feel free to feature these little guys often.  They're always entertaining.
why is that thng actually cute💀
You always make me laugh and brighten my day. Thank you 😊
God I love this Chanel
Suddenly I’m worrying about all the tartigrades that are drying out in California that will never be rehydrated.
10:37 Why we're all here.  😀
Is the game Slime Ranchers based on farming tartigrades (sp?)
I'm currently in Biochem, and having this man as a prof would make things so much easier 😆
Tardigrades:  "I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense"
I used to get low scores in school for being late. It was called a tardy-grade.
🤣 4:40 " like it was a Capri Sun "
2:35 😄
Sucks to see how many views your videos get yet the likes are low as fuck. Just so you know, I have liked them all. How can I not?
I’d buy one of those fake tardigrades.
💕
"we'll get to that in a minute" secks stuff. he means secks stuff
Who's Jerry?
I knew it! We live in poop! Some call it space i call it poop
Hilarious and informative.   Who''s Jerry?   'Jerry' gets discussed in other clips.  Heard about the exposed in space part.  Makes one think that there might be something to this 'pan via' notion that I learned about in High School.  I bet you could look up that 'pan via' bit too.
I just came over, because Casual Geographic said you are funny, and I subbed halfway through the tardigrade saga. The tardigrade reminds me of what Les Stroud said. Whether or not you survive is often down to what you’re willing to do. The tardigrade is willing.

World's smallest animal poops crystals, awesome
Why are these moss piglets all covered in shit.
This is one of the most underrated channels on the whole of YouTube!
I'm waiting for the tardigrade gene GMO upgrade to humans so we can dry ourselves and travel the universe.
Imagine if they evolved to a larger form
I gotta say, Jerry's artwork is pretty darn good!
your videos are amazing. Educational and hilarious and it doesn't delve too deep into the technical side of how everything happens which makes it much more retainable and much more entertaining. Keep it up zefrank1 you're amazing!!
"Jerry that one made a poop, well no don't focus on it"  "think masturbation with consequences" you're videos have the best quotes 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Watching exactly one year after this was posted
"The technical term for this would be 'getting very dead'..." I choked on my coffee! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣☠☠☠
I just watch these videos to hear you say “bay-bees.”
It is invulnerable to everything...except the things that are actually out to get it. In other words, it's like me being invulnerable to bullets; they can't kill me, unless they are fired at me.
Wow...disco poop.. they’ve earned my respect.
The information on Tardigrades leads me to believe that they could  be engineered to eat cancers viruses and bacteria that get into Humans and they can go decades without food or water, that after getting rid of the bad things in your body they could be made to go dormant until something else makes its way or they could be made to just not disturb anything else and only be modified to eat those diseases.   what do you think?
I'm laughing so hard, my face hurts. Thank you for the info-tainment!
Smeeeoothe
I get the feeling that Jerry is zeFrank' s inner kid
I still want to know what: playing dicky dicky in the sand means.
Just had hernia repair surgery. Watching mostly educational stuff so as not to accidentally rip out my stitches with belly laughing. You caught me off guard here. Caused me some serious pain towards the end there.
Tiny eyes which are limited "like you wouldn't want to ask one to read the menu for you". Laughed for about five minutes after that!
"Think masturbation with consequences" lmao
Between tardigrades and bat fish the planet will be  strange indeed one day. I wonder what they will make of the odd species (us) that they dig up.
Tardigrades...they will inherit the earth
“What was your earliest memory”?” “Pass.”
I love the channel's videos, but after binge watching so many, the dumbass sex jokes get annoying & flavorless as flippinheim.
Thanks Zefrank, great humour and learning thanks.  Loved the 'masturbation with consequences' quip, if they can do that why do they need to fertilize eggs?
this is the first one of your videos i’ve seen, and i already love your channel, i love your sense of humour
*My Favorite Animal~*
(That’s a compliment, where I come from)
The heteros are at it again
"Think masturbation, but with consequences" is the best way to describe parthenogenesis
Maybe our galaxy is just a tardigrade’s poop.
Suggestion: True Facts about the Shark
My next prayer is for God to put my soul in a tardigrade. I want to ride out the next century or two on some dry moss.
all around awesome video!
I just seen an ad for ECHO microscopes attached to this video....I'm not even a scientist and I want one now lol That's some boujee science
Not the scientists... The tardigrades😂
Who is Jerry ... Im new this channel
Hi
5:48-6:42 (For me to skip the advert[Or anyone else])
Jerry it made a poop.....spit my coffee all over the place!
The universe is really just water bear poop! Woah!
LOL the Puffin Freak song at the end. *GOLD*
Until now, I didn't know all the things I should be laughing at. Been missing out. Thanks ZeFrank!
"Jerry, can we have tardigrades?" Jerry: "We have tardigrades at home."
They poop colorful little crystal gallaxies.
I love Jerry's work!! 💜
Jerry is just horny for creatures. 🤣
OMG i just realized our entire universe is just a tardigrade poop crystal.
Dangit, I was just in an invertebrate zoology class, and tardigrades were covered, why was I today years old when I learned there were gecko tardigrades?!?
New Theory. Flat Earth is for chumps: "Our Galaxy is Giant Tartigrade Poop however~"
5:30 And this is how we light their shit up.
I like the little diarrhea I made with matches °~☆~°
"They are essentially a fluid-filled sack." - Well, honestly, so are we.
Cryptobiosis would have been useful during the pandemic
"Kale flavored Capri Sun" - a horror of an idea
Now that Triops are appearing in AZ from monsoon, a True Facts about aquasaurs needs to be made
Water bears
Hilarious
Despite all this, tardigrades are terrible at resisting common dangers such as other predatory microorganisms. What good is radiation shielding when some other creature slightly bigger than you can suck out your insides in an instant.
love these
Is there a way to see stuff glow under polarized light?
My guy, your videos make my day. Thanks for your time and effort. And tell Jerry hi.
What is the outro song?
This is SO incredible! I LOVE these little water bears/moss pigs 😍
Ok serious question from an ignoramus...is this an animation or is it real?
great writing and performance, I didn't expect the humor, very funny.
Oh, they're cute and everything while under a microscope but just wait until a toxic waste spill that they feed on then all hell is going to break loose........Do we have the weaponry to defeat them?
5:44 "Looks like a little galaxy" So... we're all just... tardigrade poop?   Jerry: "Always have been" (gunshot)
Fake science
I'm here for the Tardigrade merch
Water bears are even more alien than octopi
Fucking Jerry, I stg
Counterpoint: Putting the word "small" in a picture does make it scientifique.
This video made me want to buy a compound light microscope 🧍🏽‍♀️
Whoa, what if our entire universe was actually tardigrade poop? Like I know the picture was a joke but we could be living in that & not even know it.
Oh wow...I am almost at a loss for words, laughing and in pure enjoyment  of the so far 3:47 I've watched. @Zefrank1, the music, production, the everything, your voice....THANK YOU INFINITELY is all <3  PS: landed here because of Ben Davidson's (Suspicious Observers), genius mind on GMF or now HMF.  Again, so many thanks, and carrying on with the video now.
Tardigrades are the reason why some sadists become scientists.
“Take a curiosity shower”  I’ll never look at the Y in Curiosity Stream the same way 😂
What if the milky way is just a tera tardigrade crystal shit?
"Some species are parthenogenic, which means they can reproduce by themselves. Think masturbation, with consequences."   LOOOOOLLL
God damnit Jerry.
I don’t really care what the subject is, I just like his voice and delivery!
Hey, I like watching David Attenborough narrating the widlife, just like Morgan Freeman narrating people.
I can’t decide who’s funnier , zefrank or jerry !
Was anyone else just thinking about the game "Spore" when watching this? XD
yep media says tardigrade dont die. but its a big lie just to make some clickbait articles.
There's gotta be a way for the geniuses to enlarge these fellas to at least an axolotl's size just so we could pet one.
They really are the most beautiful shitters on Earth. That’s the kind of scat kink I could get into.
I hate water bears... I supposed this video helped me to see they’re pretty cute. Just a little.
Funniest and most informative channel I’ve ever had the fortune to find.  Their poop is beautiful 😁
"looks like a galaxy" what if we're living in a tardigrade shit?
small scale made me snort
Brilliant!
ZEFRANK  is the funniest stuff I've watched while still learning !! Cant figure out what idiots would down cast these videos !!! Morons I guess !! Thumbs up for me on every vid !!!
This guy is funny as hell.
Bro I didn't even know this existed.
What about the one in ST:Discovery? 🤔
You need your own nature channel
Definitely taking a curiosity shower.
New  startreck guest star
"what was your earliest memory?"
Getting very dead
You sound like Internet Historians big brother.
"Butt Segment" made me chuckle 🤭
7:06 I don’t think this line is appreciated enough
Well done moss pig, well done
Ma quello è Vincenzo!
they poop crystals, what can you do?
These make up 99.9% of NFL fans
Our universe is contained in a tartigrade poop lol
I lost it when he started with "Sunburbt skin..."
Have we been eating these all along?
I have never laughed while watching a science videos before.
"Looks like a little galaxy" Perhaps we too are just tardigrade poop. Behold your gods!
so in addition to everything else thats ridiculous about these creatures, they also poop colorful crystals
So u use patreon for the company and feedback?
I just stumbled upon the True Facts collection the other day while looking for more more more nature docs, which I have been huffing like the hummingbird do with sugar. I'm thrilled that you have made so many of them, that you use flora and fauna that are recognizable, as well as the whhaaa bugs, cellular huhs, and animals soon to be extinct. You crack me so completely up. and there ain't much to laugh about these days. I'm gonna join the Curiosity Stream, which sounds right up --or down--my alley, but mostly I am doing it to make sure you keep working. Jerry too. Oh to be a copulating exotic fly on the wall of your rehearsals! Mille grazie
Well I know the next god for my DnD homebrew world now. The tardigrade, shat out the multiverse.
Noot *paddle paddle* Noot
What if the universe was just a huge tardigrade pooping galaxy
I wonder if we are living in a universe sized tardigrade poop
The big "J" at 2:37 f'ing killed me
@7:35 cucumber bending be like
I used to look galaxy's photographs and wonder possibilities. Now I can't shake the Tardigrade's poop image from my mind.
You manage to exactly capture the mindset of the working natural scientist: a mixture of sophisticated theory and plain old gleeful childish wonder.
Man I love your videos but stop being such a pervert! Why do you have to talk that dirthy? This is what i really dont love in your videso. It also really unconfortable if I want to show the video to someone
Always was fascinated by microworld , This is my favourite video now.
"Imagine if your partner got a sunburn... and your instinct was to..."  I'm choking to death over here.  Keep educating us, ze. This is my favorite educational channel. Lord have mercy, I'm dying.
He's bloody nuts... love it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🥰
✝️  Fellowship invite
This little guy is one of my favorites. They can not be killed Do the water tiger next. They are carnivores and eat any and everything that gets close to them, even prey that is much larger. They fly and store air under their exoskeleton, for breathing under water. They are viscious and their face looks like something out of a monster movie.
I’d like you to feature the pistol shrimp.
Parthenogenesis: “It’s like masturbation, with consequences.”  XD
"Science is not a style of photography, Jerry!"  That had me dyin 😂😂
“Like masturbation with consequences…” OMG, I am so dead that I’m posting thus from the other side!😹😹😹😹😹. Like everyone else here, I need a True Facts on Jerry. Thank you Ze for making the world a more delightful place😘.
A TierZoo video has taught me everything, they aren't viable at all in the meta and probably the bottom of the bottom tier.
Good Show! The .. Oh Mai GOD ( Gloate + Urge = G0D ) reaction vids !!!
Tardigrade is a galaxy pooper
They are not smyeuthe.
Let’s be glad this guy doesn’t do history documentaries
Yes we need Frank!
half a millimeter is actually bigger then i thought they would be.
Ah Jerry, you lovable scamp.
Hahaha some of them need theraphy xD
I love the off hand simile about parthenogenisis being like masturbation with consequences, lmfao!
Totally going to just put "small" on the scale bars of my next paper and see if anyone notices...
i love how i learn as i am getting entertained
If only I could be a moss pig. Basically indestructible, smol, and full of spite
Science with a great dose of mildly adult humor.  Hysterical but rock solid science.
Water bear bro moss piglets are lame
Tardigrades are the cutest fluid-filled sacks I’ve ever seen 🥰
Masturbation with consequences....I freakin lost it.
Is jerry even real lol
Wait. They poop galaxy?! That's cool.
"Hey, we would love to sponsor a video!" Great, I'll transition into right after talking about turds!
Maybe the Milky Way is inside a giant tardigrade poop
You are so funny!!!!
Captain tardigrade
I've yet to find any tardigrades. Just rotifers everywhere
Jerry being extra this episode
Wait, you forgot the Hideo Kojima tardigrades, they are much larger and pink.... And can float in the air
1:42 those eyes are so cute!
👏👏👏👏😆😆😄💖 Amazing!
Yo, quick question broski's.....who Jerry?   (I'm new to this channel btw)
Can I hire Jerry as my assistant? He’d screw up a lot but it’s be a barrel of monkeys.
They're actually kinda cute...  I wonder how many I've inhaled in my life...
This is my first video and it is great!!
Everyone: Aww cute water bear  Me: They have buttholes for mouths
Watching the sponsor clip just to hear franks voice more
I would love to have a snapchat filter that was called "science" but was just a black and white filter
do u know alphasavior1
this whole time my brain has been reading “zef-rank-1”  he is ze frank. how did i not see this sooner
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Maybe a giant tardigrade pooped our  galaxy.
Y’all narrator needs a raise… I laughed plethora of times during this video😭😭😭
Can you imagine if tardigrades evolved to be the size of like... Like even a mouse? They'd honestly be very formidable
never stop doing this.
Masturbation with consequences?...Are tardigrades blind or pregnant? I missed something there, while sipping on my vodka sippy cup and, background porn was too loud. My hearing and my eyesight are slowly degenerating...  Another fun, great clip...Why can't we have more teachers and professors like this, instead of worthless jerks teaching hate, in educational institutions?
That would be a shi**y galaxy to live in
Ok is anyone else freaked out that the creature that ran the spore drive in star trek discovery looks like the thumbnail... Was is called a tartegrade also?
Those r some big ass eggs.
We might be inside a gigantic water bear's galaxy poop.
Imagine if our universe was farted out by a giant organism...
"Moss Piglet", The cutest and most docile sounding animal name ever.
Cmon jerry
"I'm not a fucking bear!"
i prefer Tardigrade sht theory than bigbang theory
It's like dorritos who got individually packaged in glass Poetryh 0_o
If science and biology class showed videos like THIS?!?! I probably would've passed AP BIO 😃.  (or maybe just passed reg Bio.🙄) Or even made it to "Bio for Dummies".......😕  Great stuff Jerry! Thanks.
“Jerry that one made a poop” Haven’t laughed that hard in a while
*"When They Got Back They Just Added Water And They Where Fire And Even Started To Make Babies **_I Dont Mean The Scientist_** I Meant The Tardigrades"*
Funny and educational - this guy rocks
Go Mulholland
What if our galaxy, the Milky Way, is just the poop of some gigantic water bear? 🤯
Cool
Forgot this series existed
Tardigrades shall become the next  evolution of creatures.
"Masturbation with consequences"  That sucks.
Lol.”Space!” No such thing! We cannot have a pressure system while next to a vacuum! It’s called thermodynamics!! No vacuum can reside next to a non vacuum without a solid barrier separating them!! FACT! Irrefutable!! Great vids except for all the space agenda and evolution lies! You really think ., yeah ex.. your ‘Ogre’ spider.. “ Margaret?” You really think the complex ogre spiders spinning mechanisms evolved? You have any idea how ridiculous that sounds? When did the eye evolve? Huh? And what force determined it needed eyes!? To see what? When did this Big Bang ( lol the only explosion that made rather Than  destroy? Well in the explosions defense it was its first day on the job... smh.. explosions that make things!! Perfect circle moons.. 🤦‍♂️ done here. Love your work still . Especially the behind the scenes people. Thank you . You are hilarious! And viruses aren’t contagious. Proven fact during ww1. NOT CONTAGIOUS! why don’t you help humankind and get your researchers on that!!...
The Tardigrade sucks algae chlorella like me sucking grape jelly from a jelly box!
My career is water and wastewater treatment. Great video.
Doritos packed individually in glass.... not an image I ever wanted to imagine.....
I just got my tardigrade squishy off Etsy today and had to come back and rewatch, gotta know all the deets about my desktop tchotchkes 😂
Gods creation 👍
Think masturbation with  'consequences'  9:59
This is BY FAR my favorite!!!
Tardigrade looks disgustingly cute.
"Think masturbation, with consequences"                     *oh no*
Still waiting for “this is how Jerry do” clip😂
Tartigrades are not real bears but related to the South American bears😂😂😂😂😂😂
Just brilliant. I have not laughed so hard in a while, and learned a lot too. Thank you.
These little bears are gonna outlive all of us and humanity
Lmao!
Lmao!
“Don’t mess with the Moss Piglet!” 5:21 Lol. Words to live by.
😂sucking it down like a kale Capri sun 🤣🐛🥰 I love learning from comedy 🤣
Where is the Russians subtitles??😖
I wish my shit looked like a lil' galaxy...  I'd stare into the toilet with even more wonder each time I took a dump! ^_^
Prettiest poop ever!
They are oddly cute.
anyone know on average how many of these dragon bears people drink daily?
😂
I wanna hear about their BEBES!!
This is hilarious and brilliant.  Education with the draw of humor.  I'm going to Curiosity Stream!!
Side note: Gatorade IS good for a hangover ( 7:17 )
Another member of the incredibles
There was a water bear plushie Amazon was selling, I bought one without knowing much about water bears and the real thing isn’t as cute.
The bs attempt at comedy makes this un watchable
*S M A L L*
are they called Tardigrade because they arrive late?  ...  ...i'll see myself out.
Imagine if Tardigrade poop were universes with galaxies then atoms are solar systems aand quarks are the planets n stuff. They are just too small to measure differences
"Ya can't just put a bar there that says small,it doesn't work that way" I foresee Jerry losing his shit and climbing a clock tower.
I do deserve a raise.  Who's with me?
I like moss piglets
Hello Mullholand! (Kipo and the age of Wonderbeasts reference.)
Mother Earth's ferry, the beginner's of life of the water.
Whats The final song?
I feel like we are just microscopic organisms to some other form of life
Douglas Adams would have been very proud of ya ; ) Good stuff sir!
626 Dislikes, must be Jerry's family and friends
Tardigrades be like: I F*** poop CRISTALS
I like the watermarked J that jerry left on one of the totally real tardigrades
Missing u
Im always wandering if Jerry is a real person
reproduce by themselves... think masturbation but with consequences...... what lol???
Fucking Jerry, man. He's just trying his best.
😂
"NO, we can't sell that as merch, Jerry! There's staples in it!"   But you COULD auction it. lol
finally! poop that we want to see!
Oh. My. God. They Shit Rainbows
"Looks like a little galaxy..." *wait*  We're inside a tardigrade poop, aren't we...
Nature is metal when a Water Bear can outlive a Cockroach.
I come here when I need a good laugh but still want to maybe learn something
So does anyone know the name of the song in the end??? Such a funky and catchy beat!! Lol 😂👍🕺🏽
I freakin love these! Just stumbled across one by accident and subscribed straight up! Wish our science classes were like this when I was at school. I might have actually learnt something
Never in a million year wouldnt't have imagined myself smiling like a father who just got a baby while watching the microscopic tiny little bears I mean animals.... What a world! Thanks for sharing

If people can do what these guys can do imagine all the new tags on pornhub
7:19 it has been 2 months and I just realized: who puts Gatorade in a glass?
Turdy Babes
Video was great , just like all of them. I always look forward to them. Especially if its anything with frogs since I'm a huge frog lover. Maybe african dart frogs or different species. Seriously though if I'm feeling down I watch your channel and maybe a handful that I actually really like and watch all the time
when do we get a zefranks onlyfans?      i cant wait to see some super hot pictures of submolecular organisms
Nice educational yet funny video. Can you make a video about honeybees?  Everyone says they are vital for those ecosystem but yet we know nothing besides the fact that they somehow produce honey...
Why are tardigrades cute
Aka the most overrated survivalist build in the game-tier zoo
Incredible! 👍
THEORY: The first waterbear was an alien from another galaxy, and our galaxy’s creation was the result of it having shat after consuming a dangerous substance.  Yes, i know this sounds more like an acid trip than a scientific theory.
smyoothe like the sundyoo!
Is it just my imagination, or are True Facts becoming more informative...?
I'm convinced this is an alien
I’d buy some tardigrade merch..,
All glory to the most high
“Oh there’s David Attenborough. Show off..”
Jerrys trying his best
I. Love this video but. why did that guy have to mention porn
I love diatoms, they need their own episode
Why live in the shrubbery when you could have a throne?
So we are tardigrade poop.
7:35 I'm gonna need more info on this. What is that and why is it making those cell things SPEEN at stupidly high velocities?
If I were a tardigrade, I’d move out from home.  Why live in the shrubbery when you could have a throne? Anyone who understands this, I love you.
"a big glass of gatorade" what kind of absolute weirdo pour their gatorade into a glass?
As a design student, putting a scale bar that just says "small" is aspirational. You do you, Jerry. You know how to save time, Jerry.
Man.. Your voice is dreamy but your script is nasty. I'm sure kids would love to learn from these videos.
Freaking awesome 👍👏
Can't these things survive a nuke or something
Man, I always get so excited when you upload something! Your humor and new facts literally get me through my day sometimes. This is also great ASMR stuff on low volume; helps me sleep quite well. Can't wait until your next upload! I know it takes quite a lot of effort to make each one so I will be as patient as humanly possible lol. Thanks for doing what you do, man. It means more than you know.
Tardigrade taken to space
musterbation with consequences LMAO
If we could all poop like that, I could only imagine what early Instagram would of been filled of
Great visuals to explain these little critters. I wasn't expecting it to be so funny too!
I may not be as impressive as the mighty tardigrade, but the meth hobo down the street sure can poop crystals.
I found Mulholland's family.
I love this guy's videos sooo much
I wonder how well the tardigrades on the moon are faring.
Ze: No we can't sell that as merch Jerry, there's staples in it! Me, who also watches Baumgartner Restoration: well what if we use steel tacks? I want a stress-ball tardigrade dangit 😂
I had a phobia of these for some reason growing up and this was a very nice way to get positive exposure thank you 🥺
M o s s  p i g l e t
Dude I just gave you a standing ovation..
Great vid 👏🏻  What is the song used during the closing credits?
The tardigrade lives up to my mom's wise words "just drink water and you'll be fine"
sometimes I really do think we live in a world full of Retardigrades
Well heck. This makes “War of the Worlds”, a bit less frightening. And that’s a good thing
7:44 this is the gross's and funnyist sense because its look weird and i liked that you said "jerry i think this was dead".
Ze Frank is the best zoology teacher on earth
Tardigrade poop pretty
This makes me happy calm dis is sum funny stuff def my favorite Youtuber
But but... What doeeuwh the tardigrade females doeeuwh with the eggs in their skin when theres no compatible male near?
"think masturbation with consequences"  Like… humanity would be… I don't think this would work.
SCP 682: Finally, a worthy opponent
run away r u n  a  w   a     y
Will Jerry ever get his shit together? The answer is no.
"Tardigrades poop galaxies."  **Unicorns have left the chat*
Please do more true facts with microfauna! I love it and i love learning about them!
This is excellently interesting. I've never wanted to learn this much.
Jerry cracks me tf up and I dont think jerry is even real
Ah, indestructible, cute, tiny, asexual. Have claws and horns like dragons. This is why water bears are my favourite creature.
Does anyone have more information regarding the genus battleleapus? I cannot find more information via the google and I would love to read more about them.  Thanks for another awesome video, Zefrank!
Water bears are my favorite things ever. Cute. Weird. Indestructible.
10:01 Solo :D
Brilliant stuff!!! My new favourite channel :D
I'm touched by how much inspiration Jerry found in these silly little wigglybits.
I love how jerry made space out of poop! hahahaha
When you said they poop crystals that reminds me of the troll movie which I hate because it was like a drug trip. Why is that movie so crazy I'm trying to learn about these things and this is what it reminds me of.
Does that mean I’ve been drinking these moss piglets?
This thing reminds me of the game Spore
Loved the narration.  Haven't laughed so hard in a while.  Glad I did learn quite a bit about these little creatures.  I had heard about them but didn't know their name.
could you please tell me what BGM are you using? this classical music. thank you so much!
I would sincerely pay to watch documentaries about anything with you as the voice over. You would be a great teacher.
I’m studying entomology in college right now, and honestly it’s crazy how many structures in the tardigrade are the same/similar to ones in insects
if we lost just the 60% of water we have in our bodies... hmm.. probably groddy... or jerky... or ... dusty?
SMEEEWTH... I'm dead💀
I pee calcified rocks.  I'm just not supposed to...
After this video, the Tardigrade is my Spirit Animal. I mean, wow.
I want a Tardigrade T- shirt!
Man, now this is a mutation that I think X-Men missed out on. You think Wolverine is hard to kill?
I love u man. My brother just showed me ur mudfliper vid and i loved it. Keep up the great punz and vids. :)   Edit: Mudskipper
Kipo's Tad Mulholland brought me here....
Pls mister water bear eat more so sand won't run out
And Class....This is how you narrate to get a very short attention span (like mine) to FOCUS & Learn...lol
i am so grateful that zefrank didnt go to see a psychiatrist when it was highly recommended that he do so.
“It’s kind of like if the people who made wolverine had been dentists.”  That’s the actual lol I needed this evening, thank you.
That was the most amazing footage of tardigrades I’ve ever seen! Awesome commentary too as usual.
I just watched like 10 of these videos about tardigrades and none of them explained a damn thing about how they do what they do, this video answered every single question I had while also being hilarious. Thank you for this. I'm officially a huge fan. Keep up the good work!
10:55 imma finish that for u   "imagine if you got a really bad sunburn, and your first instinct is to peel off your sunburn skin and pour your period blood into it. then your boyfriend comes along and ejaculates into it."
Actually the technical term is desiccation because I'm a science nerd he's got a ruin your fun
Pls— consider doing a true facts of the priapulida!
What is that outro song? I can't find it anywhere
"Its got staples in it" 😂😂😂
This is crazy!!
David Attenborough probably has Ze Frank envy... 😅❣
I want someone to talk to me, the way Frank talks to Jerry
Butt legs are for- eh sorry, but legs are for-
Ever tardigrade poop is its own universe lol
THIS is how you sell stuff to the public! You get somebody like this guy to talk about it for a moment in the middle of his work. I would listen to this guy read shampoo bottles, so whatever Curiosity Stream paid him, it wasn't enough! I'll probably check it out.
Scale: 1cm:small
looks like Spore
no star trek comments?
So if I’ve drank water on accident while swimming in the ocean or lake by my house, I probably swallowed these guys and since they can survive space they probably live in me ! Yes I love water bears
You need to do a video on the Ratel (honey badger). Please.
My new spirit animal
Their feet are cute..
I wonder how many people are drinking water while watching this?
I love your videos 😊
half a mm? that's actually quite big to what i thought they were.... I thought they were microscopic lol
I'm so glad to find out you're still doing these.
Microscopic creatures always wig me out, especially after I found out about the tiny slug-crab-spider things that live in peoples’ eyebrows.  *Everyone’s* eyebrows.
Tardigrades are actually unicorns because they poop glitter
I can't tell you how happy you make me.  I am so glad that you are back! Thank you for bringing joy, laughter and learning to a pretty empty time. Peace brother.
Where do you even get all this footage??
I have been watching him for since he had 21K subs, I still don't know who is jerry
Dam it Jerry.  Also, these guys are awsome..  They will outlive us all
Because they're tardy... at degrading
I feel like I've already seen a tardigrade vid on here, but this one is (relatively) new
Zefrank1: They are smooth and plump like a Gummy Bear that might pop in your mouth like a Grape.  Me: **Eating a bag of Gummy Bears**
haha those things are kinda cute
Okay so let me see if I understand... Our galaxy was pooped out by a tardigrade?
They look so cute, crawling about with their fluffed up transparent bodies with two cute eyes. I did not expect microorganisms to have two eyes
POV porn.....I died lol
what if our galaxy is just a giant tardigrade turd
They smol bois They good bois
Unicorn poop has nothing on water bear poo.
Thank you for making biology funny :)
The fascinating but decidedly weird thing about these creatures is that at some point the species encountered conditions where temperatures were that low and radiation levels were that high, that they had to adapt to them.
im curious is jerry real or are you just talking to your self for comedy
Hilarious!!!  I learned too!!!
Screw Curiosity.  I’d rather listen to you!!!
Damnit, Jerry!
Oh man, echidna's gonna be thrilled that there are new members of the "having your back legs on backwards" club lol
Atleast we realize how the galaxy beautiful.
4:20 "Nice"
a triumph! (even with the commercial in the middle... hey zefrank deserves to get paid, right?!)
5:38 so those sparkly sht I see on the ground is their crap
Incredible!!
9:05 So they can survive near absolute zero degree Kelvin!
I just realized I was listening to it like I was at school
Lol
I LOVE EVERY ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS THANK YOU!!! 🥰
I really liked learning about these tiny creatures 😂👍🏻👏🏼

I'm a biologist and this: "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins don't have a defined shape and are Floppy Floppy like cooked spaghetti. These seem to act almost like Styrofoam packing noodles, holding organelles in place and making sure things don't stick together as the cell shrinks" --what a genius explanation
"some species are parthenogenic which mean they can reproduce by themselves, solo. Think masturbation with consequences"  I laugh out loud on that one!
Your the funniest and best nature person ever even better then David atambrouh
I’d like to introduce my new religion/ creationism theory we are born from a tardigrade poop
In 1979 I  was on a secret mission with a team of specialists. We traveled to an area which I can only identify as   LV-426. One of our operatives came in contact with one of these things and it attached to his face by wrapping around his head. Needless to say our mission did not go well and I'm convinced the "Company" is researching this thing for our weapons program.
My ma says their unicorns. If they poop cristals, then they're just tiny umicorns.
You are the best Ze 😂 I've been in a depressed funk lately but this video perked me up a bit. Thank you for knowing what's funny. 😂😁
i cant tell if they are gross or cute...and also i keep thinking of the water bear from kipo and wondering how many of these things and their poops i've accidentally swallowed
“Think masturbation but with consequences.” 😳 Hahaha I lost it. Then ZeFrank proceeded to further shock me 🥺
Glad to hear Jerry's on the job. One of the most alien-looking critters I've ever seen. These videos are like gold; this one is no exception!
Babey. Little feet. Tiny eyes. Love
Think masturbation with consequences
Can you do a true facts about hippos? They spend most of their life in water, yet cannot swim. They just run along the bottom, at 30km/hr.
holy crap, best channel on youtube, where do you get your footage from? awesome stuff!
i think zefrank accidently proposed our universe is just a tardigrade poop
I just found this channel and this is so hilarious and informative at the same time. I know what videos I'm gonna waste hours on now.
Tardigrade drinks your tiny tiny milkshake
"Science isn't a style of photography, Jerry!"  I love your little quips. 😂  I was laughing and learning at the same time.  Fascinating and hilarious content as always.
Is teddy still doing good ?
I would love to see an episode on lobsters. WHO WILL JOIN ME IN THIS NOTION?!?!
Like it was a kale-flavored Capri Sun©.
Dude finally we have a vid on one of my fav animals! I’m so happy rn!
... what if our entire universe in giant microscopic poop? mind=blown
the last two minutes are absolute Au
LOL!!!  🤣🤣😊🙏🙏🙏
This is great, I am fascinated by this lil creature.

Ho, please do the Napoleon fish! They are so misunderstood. I misunderstood them.
I love tardis!!! 💧🐻🌱   Aw I wish they could survive gastric acid.
What if our galaxy is just a one big tardigrade poop? 🤯🤯🤯
Could you make one on Manuls/Pallas’ Cats? They’re grumpy looking.
Do one on Fireflies
Parthenogenesis (noun) : masturbation with consequences
Oh and heres a thought ive lived with for some time now, that you have just jogged.  As you can see the mighty tardigrae poops galaxys.   Imagine for a second our universe was just the atom of another larger being we could never comprehend. We are nothing but beings that live on a spec inside these poop galaxys that are based in this atom sized universe.  All hail the might all knowing, universal tardigrae!  Hail tards
MOARRRRR!!!!!!!  The people demand MOARRRRRR!
this was awesome and hilarious 😂 glad I found your channel!
So every time we drink water, we accidentally drink them? I’ll never drink water again...
I really want to hear what you’d have to say about the bag worm moth caterpillars little stick cabins they glue to their backs
Narwhal???
Started watching this through my phone speakers and it freaked my bearded dragon out. She started waving to show submission and puffing out to make herself look bigger. She did not calm down until I turned the video off.
Christ Jerry get your act together (kidding of course)
How many complaints would I get if I sent this to all my Biology students?   I may be about to find out. POV tardigrade porn is suitable for the over 12's, right internet?
True facts about the geoduck. A shellfish that looks way too much like a giant dong.
You better sell those orbeez tardigrade models as merch RIGHT NOW
Are you the voice of the current scientology commercial?
Jerry is the perfrct embodiment of my enthusiasm towards living this life
tartigrades: reproduction via diy skin condoms
why are these things so....   ADORABLE
Glass of Gatorade?! You barbarian!
Nice but a little bit less Jerry would be great.
I wish I was a tardigrade
Could you do a video on peacocks please? Pretty, pretty please?? Picture me peacocking ! Lol
Hello Frank,  I hope you read this. I just learned about the existence of the (more or less spooky) "Potoo", or "common potoo" (Nyctibius), and I would love to learn about it. By you :)
I have a hard time believing aliens don't exist after seeing this. I thought Jerry did a great job in those models! 👍
Please make a video about terrestrial isopods. They are gaining popularity in the pet community and I have them. Would love to see a video on them from you
(“
It isn't good for them to obtain or get close to Borealis,otherwise not to mention 7 hours but not even 7 minutes war...
Because humans have the stupid bias that assumes advanced forms of life must be large, they've failed to realize that Tardigrades are the alien rulers of the universe who came here from a galaxy a trillion light years away to add earth to their empire.
Jerry is very good at making models, he probably has a curiosity shower every day before work
I love Tardigrades! I think they are so amazing. Thanks for teaching me more about them. I've loved and shared your videos since I first discovered your Sad Cat Diary. Your voice and manner of speaking are the best 😁
*Jerry is what you'd call "Passive-aggressive"*
Do a true facts about cockroaches
This is the first time frank made a video about an animal they did before
Our universe is made up of tardigrade $#!+
Great movie! I hope that someday in the future I will get an audience like yours. Please visit my channel, maybe you can advise me something :)
So what you’re saying is that a bag of tardigrades is essentially a bag of rice with protein that makes them come back to life after you poop them into the water in your toilet. Do we get nutritional value from them?
“It looks like a galaxy.” Wait,,, Is our whole universe *a water bear’s poop???*
Whats the name of the song at the very end?
It’s official.  I will never get enough of you and Jerry.
This video was amazing!! I'd like to see dust mites in a future episode.
Yeah.... *LEWD* 😂
They're so cute, I want all of them
Just a reminder: This guy did an operation on a teddy bear
You should do one on the mountain chicken
Teach us about the jellyfish
I love Jerry
Love you Ze Frank's,Your amazing, you made 12 + years of my YouTube expensive awesome,Oh and plz Do one on another small creature,The Sea Monkey.
Water bears are only cute because they aren't big and can't kill you like regular bears.
Can u do a true facts about Humans
I Follow and Get Excited when a new vid is posted, I just love his Narrations and the Simple Witty Humor. Thanks Man Don't Change.
Is the universe Gods poop?🤔
Jerry been acting up lately.
Dude you are amazing
Today I learned that tardigrades have disco poo and life feels a little better.
Great white sharks no reason just like them
I wish i could get smaller to taste moss bacon
zefrank, first off, I’m a huge fan. love all your videos, especially True Facts, and share them with my friends often. Special request though, can you do a video on Bearcats? Which are neither bears, nor cats, but do have a prehensile tail and smell like popcorn. Pretty sweet, right?
I don't know why, but this little thing is adorable. It looks like a tiny animal not just the usual blob.
Scatter them and some GMO lichens all over Mars.
Is Cancel Culture gonna ban you for offending these things?
The sticky toe ones...so cute
Damn it, Jerry.
lol brilliance as always! Also...we love Jerry lol
👍
Wow, this was educational!
Is teddy ok
Absolutely fantastic, as always. <3
😁😁
Amazing 🤯
Star Trek Discovery.
This is the best thing i've seen in a long time
Tardigrade, the manatees of microscopic world.
I LOVE the true facts series...humour and science <3
Thank you for this incredibly detailed and completely serious video.
Ze Frank is just the bizarro David Attenborough
This channel kinda like national geographic and darkweb got smash together to make a smoothie of animal pornhub but super informative
What mic do you use
This is so great, i wish this channel grows to infinity
zefrank and Jimmy Carr. Podcast. Go.
well at least we know that once we kill off the human race, tardigrades will take over and become the all powerful.
I love these videos! You should do one about Potoo birds!

That tardigrade was roughly 5 small long.
Absolutely love these videos! Thanks so much zefrank!!
Your pfp makes you look like gorden ramsay

My husband and I love your channel we watch a few of your vids every night before we go to bed. We always have a good laugh and learn a thing or two 😁
pov pornography
Is this in me, are these cthulu creatures inside me?
Imagine if we pooped crystals.
“Teddys on drugs 🤯”
Wait so the giant alien in starship troopers was a giant tardigrade??
I REALLY appreciated that the adult content was almost entirely at the end. Small children LOVE this content but many parents won't let them watch. If you can release more content that is mostly PG, we will watch more content and share more. I  think the content is brilliant.
#gummibeartardigrade merch
I think we are all living in a galaxy of a single tardigrade poop
Aka moss piglet? Where did that shite name come from? Its actually Aka Water Bear.

"masturbation with consequences" - I'm laughing hard here
What if the universe is a tardigrade poop
Biology has never been this interestinb
Do a video on humans.
You should do a video on the Perry the corpse flower.
"Oh good, now it's stuck to its foot" I had to pause I was laughing so hard I couldn't hear what you were saying! XD
Water 🐻 bears awww
Jerry needs an agent. Scale up those models and they would fit in beautifully at MOMA.
I wanted to share this video with my kids.  Thanks for ruining it with the pornography reference.
I love your explanation of animals, insects or fish or lots of other things. I actually learn alot. Your very inspirational,
For a moment I didn't relize  i was listening to zefrank1 😂😂
No one  Literally No ONE :  Zefrank1 : Think of Masturbation with Consequence.
Thinking about previous episodes: butt violence (macaques), butt molecules (lizards, snakes),  butt beetles (army ant riders),  butt feathers (hummingbirds).  Me (after seeing this episode): don't even think about it!  My mind: Butt jewels!
Imagine not commenting: ""“Minecraft" "ASMR" "pewdiepie" "music" "Fortnite" "markiplier" “YouTube is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits.” "Runescape" "World of Warcraft" "Shadowlands" "Dream" "MrBeast" "Warzone" "FaZe Clan" "100 Thieves" "Call of Duty" "Pokemon" "Pokemon cards" "card unboxing" "Charizard" "they don't want you to know" "Flat earth" "round earth" "triangle earth" "the earth is not earth" "what even is earth if not earth omg government is lying to you" "Minecraft" "ASMR" "pewdiepie" "music" "Fortnite" "markiplier" “YouTube is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits.” "Runescape" "World of Warcraft"
if this were an anime character it would be friggin OP
doctor: so, about your ingestion problem, may I ask how your poop looks like patient: like stars, in a galaxy, under the polarized camera.
Huh so everyone forgot teddy that he got surgery strange
I just love the way you narrate your videos. It's funny to watch and not boring like typical doco's where they sound like zoned out zombies.
This is Journey to the Microcosmos - except hilariously fun. Thank you, Mr Z Frank!
zooplankton 💩
Don't mess with the moss piglet
Whenever I read the book “WTF NATURE?!” I always picture the narrator as you, it just fits so well
Hello there  I am Sørensen-Hygum, coauthor of one of the papers you cite. I just want to say that I am very happy and impressed with your video. It is a really great feeling to see my research become part of an educational youtube video. I am really proud of that scanning electron micrograph of Echiniscoides sigismundi and seeing it reproduced makes me happy.
Is teddy still on drugs?
.."looks like a galaxy..".. mayb we're living in a galaxy made by tardigrade poop..
I've learned more from just this video than I have throughout all of my time in school
In response to the question "What can you do?" (After it pooped a crystal) my 12 yr old son quickly replied "I can pee crystals!" & Technology he's kinda right 🤷🤣🤣🤣
Aren't all of us essentially fluid filled sacs? I mean sure some also have bones, but still.
That was really fun and captivating! I didn't even skip the add! Haha
9:36 Jerry invents Space Poop!
4:11 "It's a healthy snack, get your vitamins."
been watching these for years and I gotta say, this is the first one to truly gross me out 🤷🏼‍♀️
It's like if you peeled your skin off and fashioned it as a grocery bag filled with cracked eggs, and your partner is expected to impregnate that.
Wait, so you're saying, that, that's how you pronounce chiten??????!!!!  God, I've just wondered my whole life and no one has ever known 😂
Tardigrades are going to take over the world...
How many of these have I accidentally swallowed?? 🤢😭
Unicorn poop has nothing on tardigrade poop.
Brill8ant
is narrator the guy from LGR channel?
@zefrank1 Could you tell us the name of the 11:25  song please?
You guys are crazy!
Best one yet!!
IIRC these little guys were the monster in Harbinger Down. A cosmonaut took some to space, and then they mutated and merged with him when he crashed in the antarctic. Then it became The Thing on a boat.
I just started watching your videos and I laughed at every one of them they are soo funny, I think I watched 20 videos continuously.
and that just what they do - I love your videos.
I got genuinely upset when the little dudes dried out sjdjdj then I got happy again when I found out they're fine
1:09 "sorta like POV pornography" 😂😂
These lil things are why I would bet all the money in the world that life exists somewhere else in the universe.
I bought a Behbeh shirt.  Can't wait to get it 🙌.
Smewth 😂
THINK masturbation with "consequences" ...  That's rough! Good for them but imagine if it were like this for humans? We'd have a huge population issue!
-270°C is 3.15°K if anyone is wondering.
This came at a great time. I’m currently studying this in my biology class.
I’d buy it
How jerry ain't fired yet🤣🤣🤣🤣he da goat
"Smewwwth" 🤣🤣🤣
I love the "gummigrade" that Jerry prepared. The juicer for the mouth and the visible scotch tape is so extra!😂
I wanna see True Facts about the Stoat- they look so gawd damn cute I wanna know more about with Zefrank's voiceover-   Pls notice me Frank-
Put a whole new spin on resurrection
Where’s the sequel to Teddy’s surgery
I'm sad that this apparently got buried in my recommendations and I didn't see it existed until now.
Thank goodness they are tiny.  Imagine if they evolved to the size of a mouse!!  I'll stop talking shit now.  But this was Fascinating and very funny!!
Adults have to make money, zoomers.
😅😀 Where to start? I enjoyed so much of your video; the scope captures are fantastic and the commentary cracked me up!  Seen a lot of tardigrade vids, but this is by far the best! Love it! Subbed.
Jerry should get an A for effort for his Tardigrade model.
speaking of pooping out crystals, big thanks to our sponsor for todays video!
Can you do the iron shell snails that live in volcanos?
I'm so intrigued 😃 why am I just now finding your channel
You got beef for david man?
so happy to live in a hydrated aeon of planet earth where zefrank has emerged. :-)
I'll spend the rest of my life trying to fit the phrase "masturbation with consequences" into casual conversation.
"It's like if your partner had a sunburn, some of their skin peels off and you ..." Why, WHY didn't he continue?  I was interested to hear what he was going to say about that.  :-D
I'm the 1m viewer
Such comfy viewing. A welcome respite for life.
“Oh. There’s David Attenborough— show-off..” XD
Learning that tardigrades poop crystals really changes my perspective of Swarovski crystals..."it's just tardigrade poo"
(Pronounced: Fil) Phil the Villager gave Pill a pill the illager
What's the groovy to on at the end of this clip
What the heck is that song called at the end of the credits??
I love how I actually learn things from you. Octonauts taught me waterbears existed, you literally taught me cellular analysis on them. I love you.
Unknown fact : Tardigrades are the little dudes that makes the  Force work !!
Those little legs are too cute for some reason
My oh my!! My fav...so far...
Please, please try your skills within the realm of The SCP Foundation? Just for shits n giggles, for my birthday? Thanks either way, for all you do xoxo
If I’d had Zefrank for biology in college my life might’ve been completely different.
I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE BACK ON YOUTUBE WHY NO ONE TOLD ME oh yes life is good again
Can you do one of the lady bug?🐞
My earliest memory is being a stroller on a hike up a mountain. I remember going over a big bridge over a giant cliff. It turns out that there was no mountain, more of a long hill and only a very small bridge over a small stream.
I wish my poop was beautiful too
"Masturbation with consequences" caused me to go into cryptobiosis
awesome video ,super interesting and  i will check out curiosity stream it sounds nice,like,scientific,not pawn shop wars of whatever they do on discovery these days
I hate to be that first tardigrade who got dried out on a slide, it’s not like the bio students knew they’d rehydrate.
I hate to be that first tardigrade who got dried out on a slide, it’s not like the bio students knew they’d rehydrate.
So, what are they do with the  tardigrades that are on the glass slides when they’re done looking at them?
Zefrank, I love you man. I swear I'm constantly checking to see if you have new uploads. You entertain me more than 99% of the other things I see on TV or the internet. Oh, tell Jerry I believed his Tardigrade was real.
If I recall correctly, Star Trek: Discovery used tardigrades. They were the sources of Discovery's ability to jump. Soon, the crew found a better way to jump rather than harm the tardigrades, and the one they had was set free in space.  Of course, those tardigrades were significantly larger.  I get the connection. Space poop. Great creative thinking!
How does he keep improving these videos!!?! 🤣
That reproduction thing gives me weird necrophilia vibes 😢
I do like curiosity, but curiosity doesn't like me
jellyfish turritopsis dohrnii: bruh
I for one Jerry, greatly enjoyed your DIY Tardigrades. Very well done.
Funny and insightful all in one tiny and amazing package, and yea the video was great too!
Why does Tardigrade sound like a sassy insult?  lol
_smyooth_
is that Winnie the Pooh bear narrating?
In middle school, my class went into the mountains for a field trip. We took samples of water from streams to look at the microorganisms there. I was one of two people who actually got to see a Water Bear. And, yes, I saw it poop as well.  Mine wasn’t as magical of an experience.
Why the pornography reference? Not cool
I love the black and white clay Tardigrade with the 'small' scale bar. That is hilarious, makes me want that for a desk top background.
Tardigrade:  "I shit exquisite crystals that resemble miniature galaxies"
Look at their fkn nails!  ....squeeeee
I love these little fellas, I’m so glad you’re still making these. I remember my dad showing the chameleon one to me when it came out and it’s how I discovered your channel. Wish he was here so I could send him these videos again
OH! I really hope he does more on *microorganisms* and the *microorganism* world! That'd be some dope ass micro- shit! 👍🤭
Do you do VO on curiosity stream because if you do I’ll sign up this minute
eww kale flavor capri sun would, not sell well at all
Absolutely wonderful video.   Have you thought about doing a video on canids or possibly about migratory salmon?   I would imagine both subjects would prove to be both extremely educational and would have a lot of comedy value.
there are so many facts from this episode that intrigue me so much about the HOW. Like, how do scientists figure out what minerals the tardigrade's exoskeleton or jaws are made out of??
All I can say is "yayyyy!!!" whenever I see a new video from this channel. This is my nerdy/educational/motivational/humorous happy place.
By far my favorite.
I love Jerry
Yeah, well...I pooped crystals once too so explain that science!
if they've helped keep you sane, they're not doing it right.
'Ope there's David Attenborough... showoff.'  I love this show so much.
“Think masturbation but with consequences.” Ha! That’s funny.
I love “Jerry”’s attempts at model tardigrades! 🥰
Tell Jerry to get you some footage of Assassin Bugs!  Because an episode on those little wonders would be F@*kING great.
That was MINDBLOWING!!!
I'm to deliver an urgent message from somebody by the name of Python... I believe he said his first name was Monty(??). Never heard of him. At any rate he adamantly requests that you cease and desist. Everything. He said you've gone above and beyond "Silly!" and you're to stop at once and this instant! Right!! Carry on, then.  This was honestly the most fun I've had learning anything here on YouTube in the last decade. You, Sir, are a comedic genius. Break a leg!
522 dislikes came from Jerry's friends and relatives
"Heterotardigrades, on the other hand, are not smewth." dunno why but the delivery of that line made me cackle.
"How a Tardigrade Do".....a fricken MASTERPIECE.
Please do not shine your "Polarized Light" at my crotch area. Thank you.
Micro gummy bears.
I must know. -IS- there actually a jerry?
. . .and the tardigrades will inherit the earth.
Tardigrade Of The Rings: Return Of Ze King.
Tardigrades are also known because they can intuitively navigate the universe's mycelial network!
So glad to see more regular video uploads! Been a long time follower. When should we expect a scaly-footed-gastropod video ;)
I needed this. Thank you sir.
Tardigrades will always be a favorite.
"imagine having doritos each individually wrapped in glass and trying to eat it... well the tardigrade doesnt give a crap"
These things drying out=those shrinking hoses.
These Spore Let's Plays are getting weird.
Jerry has been hitting the bottle again
Ah!! My viewers suggested your channel!  You are great.  I require these animals. Somehow my axolotls don't seem as cool now and they would definitely be easier than my Onni, the now teenage, Cockatoo.
Zefrank1: "It's kind of like if Doritos came individually packaged in glass, Tardigrades don't give a crap!" Me: Trying to decide of the three Nacho Doritos I just shoved in my mouth are safe to chew.
ITT we protect jerry and his artistic desire to create scientifically accurate models of moss piglets
I always wait for ur new videos 😍😍😍 its alwaysss gewwddd and mind blowing~~ super niceee
Water?  No thanks. I’m really not that thirsty anymore.
That is how a jerry do
Hilarious as always! Thanks!
Plot twist: Jerry is his alter-ego
Tardigrade's poop looks like a thousand Galaxys
Big Bang theory confirmed.. except the bang came from a tardigrade pooping... we are much smaller than we thought.
Damm you could be a voice actor with your voice
‘Imagine masturbation with consequences’ Killed me
What about the giant space ones that talk to mushrooms??
I have to thank you for the new callsign. "Moss piglet"
also cool fact about these guys is that they have lived the longest on earth
They did NOT teach me this in dragon school.
Thank you for funny presentation of tardigrades as unique creatures! Best wishes!
*smol
"True facts" is a name that gives me the impression that this an incredible unreliable source of information that should be avoided at all costs.
I have Been waiting for this one for years
Can't sell that one....but you said merch and I want a gummy ball tardigrade!  You know the Discovery Store is just going to steal the idea.
"Think masturbation with consequences." LOL!
this is the best explanation i've seen in a long time
That moment you are graduating in biology and you understand every therm he throws at you
Zefrank's voice is always music to my ears, even with the wit and scientific knowledge 😍
"Science isn't a style of photography, Jerry" Hubble Space Telescope: _stands up and leaves_
Ive been waiting far too long my friend
Life is so amazing!
What is the song at the end, I have got to know
Love the viewer comments and I am so glad you keep showing back up Ze.... your videos are so funny and endearing!  I especially titter like crazy when you pronounce the word "bbabies" the way you do!  I also was glad to see you use your patreon account in such a productive way. Plotting world domination is extremely important and I look forward to seeing you move forward with that goal.  I am sure the world will be a much better place dominated by you so good luck with that!!  ♥
Im high af watching on .5x
Rotifers are the David Attenboroughs of the microscopic world. Frickin' showoffs!
Truly disgusting, that some “people” would do this horrible thing.
This is my birthday 🎁
You should do one on flies
Weak assed star poopers can't survive a day in 100F water though
This just gave me a new hyper-fixation
Lmfao @ Jerry’s depictions!  Absolutely brilliant stuff here!
If humans by some fluke of nature achieve crypto biosis nobody would ever know because of cremation or embalming.
frank hear me out: *_more_* *_protists_*
I can't get over referring to asexual reproduction as 'Masturbation with consequences'
Time to get a new Jerry, Ze.
Finally, the shocking origins of.... CAPTAIN TARDIGRADE!! DEFENDER OF THE MULTIVERSE!!
what is the song at the very end?
love the episode...but the ad in the middle was a horrible choice......... end or beginning, dont interrupt the goodness.
For some, the fantasy of eating glitter and shining a laser pointer into the toilet just got too very real.
Anyone else reaeeeally wanna boot up SPORE after watching this?
Thank you, Ze.
You said mouthole and i had to comment
Is this narrated by Mr. Fischoeder from Bob's Burgers?
My first thought about this video was "how informative!" but then I remembered that this is the same guy who told me that the universe emerged from the butthole of a farting hedgehog.
"Don't teach you that in dragon school" 😂
"For most creatures the technical term of this would be "Very Dead" " *😂😂😂
David Attenburrow?! He's not a rabbit. It's pronounced Attenbrah.
Wonderful content and spectacular microscopic photography. Thank you for posting.
The most fun fact they don't tell you is that most tardigrades die from extreme environments like desiccantion or exposure to the vacuum of space
Fun fact: These little guys can be found living inside of plants with high water content like Lettuce, cucumber and watermelon and they are animals not single celled organisms as they have identified organs and body parts and specialized cells which makes them a full blown animal like a cow or a chicken and most important of all is that its nearly impossible for vegans not to eat trillions of these little guys which are animals, which means vegans do not exist. Yeah some of them make an exception for tardigrades but then i just tell them about the micro shrimp in their tap water.
"Tardigrades poop galaxies" should be a T-shirt.
Star Trek Discovery much!!! Love it!!!!
It is Lego not Legos Lego translates to let’s play so Legos Will translate to let’s play’s
Thanks, Ze. Good to hear from you again!
Mmm, kale flavored CapriSun. 🤤
The. Best. Thing. Ever!
I love the glowing footage.
*This video:* exists *My brain, immediately:* "IF I WERE A TARDIGRADE, I'D MOVE OUT FROM HOME!--"
This channel is hilarious! I mean I Learn a crapload but it’s still absolutely hilarious!
Horton Heard a Tardigrade That's who!
1:24 When your professor tells you to draw to scale. "Small"
my brain is confused, it stuck between being blown and amused.
Jerry is upping his game.
Tardigrades are immortal. You can't change my mind.
theory, galaxies are just cosmic tardigrade poops
Do tardigrades make good pets?
tardigrades are basically cockroaches but cooler
It's hard to have a straight face with all the jokes, but it's ok to lighten up. I wouldn't mind hugging tardigrades that are the size of humans.
I'm definitely not pooping little galaxies
So like...the motivation for taking these cutie patooties up into outerspace is to test their ability to revive themselves after exposure to extreme hardcore conditions that us mere humans are surely to perish in? (e.g. radiation, dehydration, oxygen deprivation, extreme temperatures, hard space vacuum, etc.)??  Are the scientists any close to figuring out how we can do what these tardigrades dOoOo~?
I've been fascinated by these creatures for over a decade! The amount of information we can learn from a species that can survive radiation, dehydration, extremes of temperature, and the void of space, is limitless. They needed more public exposure to pique the interest of young aspiring scientists/biologists, and this video may finally do just that!
Yyyaaaayyyy!!
If I were a tardigrade I'd move out from home Why live in the shrubbery when you could have a throne? Pressure wouldn't squash me and fire couldn't burn These are the things that I never will learn  -Tardigrade Philosopher Cosmo Sheldrake
I mean, at least when Jerry used chicken eggs they appeared to be the correct size for a larger scale 😂
“Science isn’t a type of photography, jerry” made me blow hella air out of nose. That’s comedy. Thanks ze Frank
I'm surprised no one has mentioned Cosmo Sheldrake's Tardigrade song.
That was the prettiest turd I've ever seen.
If you'd streamlined the jokes this would have been a solid video.
This was really cool
Disappointed that I’m somehow 4 days late to the party despite aggressively searching for fresh content😭
New favorite animal
Anyone know what song is playing at the end credits?
No wonder water bears are so durable. They have the infinity stones inside them!
"Sort of like POV pornography"   I mean true, but not a comparison I was expecting in a pop science video.
Tardigrades can also travel through the micillium network of space time and dimensions
I keep being awed and disgusted, idk what to feel
I love this guy! 😂
10:48 "nooo pls no we don't need the explanation!" 😂😂😂
It's nice to know he thinks my poops are beautiful
I had a practical at uni where we were looking at microscopic animals and the only one we couldn't see was the Tardigrade because somehow this creature that can survive in space couldn't survive the journey from Kent
I learn sooooooooooooooooooooooo much more from this than I ever did back in school a long time ago. The laughs add a dimension and interest to the subject that was ruined in school. They don't get it. They think they need to be boring to be serious. But the mind and the memory work by associations and the mind has to be open to work properly, like a parachute. Not so open the brain falls out but yaknowaddamean!
I waited so long for seing the tardigrade on this channel!
Let me have a girlfriend
This is how all science classes should be taught
*god really likes details if he went through all of that to make these guys*
Jerry is finally pushing out of his shell after years of holding back, just like the Tardigrade
Welcome back zefrank1! Missed your vids!
Some species are parthenogenic which means they can reproduce by themselves... solo.... think masturbation with consequences 🤣
Theory: the universe was made by an ancient void tardigrade.
2:00 Turdigrade
Apparently they can be used to power Federation Starships through the universe aswell. Cheeky little buggers.
Nobody calls them moss piglets. You made that up to try and sound white girl cute
No cammeos from Capitan Tardigrade??? Shame on you
That footage is mind blowing!
How are these microscopic creatures so resilient, and yet we can die choking on a potato chip.
True Facts: Zefrank - on my desk monday 😡
GET IT TOGETHER, JERRY.
3:58 This man is out here randomly taking swipes at 'How to Train Your Dragon'
They are like tiny hippos haha
Water bears. How do you get to minus 0 Kelvin?
Every time I love these
Funny thing you might not know: The german word for those little fellas is "Pantoffeltierchen" - A Pantoffel is a not very serious word for slippers, you know that cozy warm ones you're wearing at home while winter, sitting in front of a fireplace. And "Tierchen" is a cute version of the word "Tier" which means animal. But a "chen" at the end of the word makes the original word sweet, little and adorable. Like a nickname. So you could translate it like "little sweet Slipperanimals". So, now you know that. #bebes #koalasintherainnofucksgiven
What if our Universe is just the shiny poop of an extremely large Tardigrade?
I will never stop recommending this channel!
Did anyone notice how zefrank’s voice has gotten more light pitched over the years for “true facts”?
Watching this while having my breakfast was a bad idea...
I love the technical term 'getting very dead'
This now my favorite science channel, just my favorite channel actually.
i used to be obsessed w true facts in high school-- crazy how all these years later the series continues and is just as funny! nothing will ever beat the sea pig in my heart tho
So Cute ! :-)
I love this. It's such a treat whenever ZeFrank posts anything ;)
So happy to see a new ZF on my timeline. Love you man!
Tardigrade don’t give a f*ck about global warming.
I love them so much. They are the PEAK of Nature.
for me it was the sex stuff that really made me laugh
"Think masturbation with consequences."  ... oh no
I'm going to watch this on acid. Wish me luck.
Knowing about parthenogenisis because of reptiles and then hearing your explanation of it here "it's like masturbation but with consequences" made me cackle omfg I mean you're not wrong 😂.
Is that the same Jerry from Rick & Morty? 🤣🤣🤣 ✌💗
*God:* Every living thing must die eventually   *Tardigrade:* Hold my rejuvenating cells
But can it survive the Coronavirus?
What the hell did I just watch?! But... I think I ... learned something? I'm not sure though because I'm too busy trying to remove all of the demented imagery from my mind! 😂
*Plot Twist:* Each individual universe is just Tardigrade poop. So essentially they are Gods
Lol!
Seriously dude. You're killing me!
BAD ASS MUTANTS
I love your voice 😍
This is what i've been looking for 👊👊👊
Maybe our universe is just tardigrade poop, and that poop is in another universe also made from a  larger tardigrade poop universe...oh dear god how far does this rabbit hole go?
Watching a tardigrade poop made me uncomfortably aware of how often the tiny creatures on our skin poop on us everyday.
Now i have a topic for ice-breaking session!
I'd listen to your streams
Are they dangerous to humans?
Somehow, it reminds me of stitch from lilo and stitch
"Oh, there's David Attenborough. Showoff."
Now imagine vegan animal rights activists being as resilient as tardigrades are: that’s how a Biopantheist do.   PS : this is my favorite episode of all time, and it’s not just because I’m high on my non-pharma medication. Thank you, @Zefrank1. Your curiosity inspires me every single time, as do these ancient immortal teeny tiny moss water bears. 🙏🌲🌒
Pov corn
Okay, maybe this is because I'm high af on painkillers, but why can't we do that revived-decades-after-drying-out thing? Like, if this little microscopic organism can do that, then why can't we humans? If we're evolved to be "the superior species," why do we die? We're just big dumb meatbags aren't we
Wow this was amazing. Even the sponsor message was great
Tardigrades are what kept me going during my molecular biology courses. Couldn't do it without the water bear
I lost it when Jerry made space using poops. That's genius.
I'll be honest. I'm kind of glad I don't poop crystals.
How does it do?
I love zefrank so much 🤗
Imagine being one of those things... huh... uhhh... ahhh! Noooooo! Nope. Never want to imagine being one of those things ever again.
Tardigrade don't give a crap!  lol
G-rated zefrank is just not as funny 😒
It breaks my heart to know that a scant 80 years from now you will not be posting any new videos. This is a loss for all mankind.
Those tardigrade with toes blew my mind.
I think you mean AKA the water bear
I found this very fascinating. A tiny world of creepy critters. 🦠🔬
So they're immortal. They survive ice, fire, and the vacuum of space. They're probably doing just fine in the pandemic, too. I feel so insignificant :(
Who told you it was called a moss piglet? It's a water bear.
This is lovely~~
Jerry is an misunderstood artist. I appreciate his work😉
LMAO!!  Dude I love you.  I want to be like you.  I love everything you say.. hilarious!!  Give some pauses for us to breath.
I swear, this voice sounds like a knock off Morgan Freeman
Why did no one tell me about salt water tardigrades?!?
I'm starting to suspect nepotism is the reason Jerry is still around ;)
The knowledge level of this one surpassed my expectation.
Oh I've missed your uploads , for some reason I don't think YouTube is notifying me when you upload. I just seem to randomly come across your videos grrr thank you for giving me a good laugh though x
Does anyone else think this guy sounds like Morgan Freeman? This guy is going places for sure!
I wish Zefrank was my HS biology teacher.
We know how tardigrades reproduce, but not eels
Glorious, as always. <3
Holy s***😂😂 I'm so glad I found you!!
Tardigrades poop tiny galaxies
Awesome, as always - thanks.
Idea for the next vid    Here we have true facts about the jerry  The jerry is scientifically known as retardus jeriatrus  Home to the family of retardus the jerry is a close relative to the zefrank. The jerry and the zefrank live in a symbiotic relationship but, due to losing a game of evolutionary blackjack,the jerry has a nine in charisma but a 1 in intelligence.  The zefrank uses entertainment to keep its predators busy so they do not devour it.  The jerry takes place in this as the special effects man. But due to the jerry being a retard, its shit at its job. The jerrys habitat consists of a studio apartment on vernon Ave. Missouri.  The jerry survives off of Doritos,mountain dew and instand noodles provided by the zefrank.  The jerry can survive off of this unhealthy diet by simply not pooping  Whenever they feel like dying they take two advils and continue their work.  The jerry has an amazing evolutionary trait. The jerrys arched back provides cover and protection from sunlight while editing videos at 6 in the morning.   And like the jerry,you too can have an arched back watching videos 6 in the morning,  Todays documentary is sponsored by crunchyroll blah blah blah. Now where were we?   The jerry has no natural predators as it is fucking disgusting, but poachers have recently started hunting them for their hunch backs which create an excellent pelt.
Aww, cute little toes
geezz it poops crystals look out now we will have tweakers digging in our moss in the lawn "yes I live in WA we have moss lawns"
If this were around when I was in high school I would have majored in zoology... tardigrade scat could have changed the course of my entire life.
This was very learny learny
I was waiting for the "That's what a ___________ do" line, it's my favourite of this series!
"it's like masturbation but with consequences" lmao
if you haven't listened to the song 'Tardigrade', you are missing out! it's by Cosmo Sheldrake and it's super catchy!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCkSr0ugTIM
Tardigrades must have the most beautiful poo of the animal kingdom.
Masturbation but with consequences. That shit killed me
I want Jerry's merch      .....wait that sounded dirty 😳
how i would love to be a scientist watching tardigrades and sending out adorable water bear footage for a living...
Jerry tuned science into art
Started making babies, not the scientists, the tardigrades. LOL
Haha! Now when I stand up after a nap I'm going to say I have; "water balloon legs"
Unbelievable - amazing - stunning... hard to keep remembering this whole realm is happening around us....
You should do a series of microscopic life living on our bodies. Eyebrows, eyelashes, skin, in our eyes, in our system, etc.
I would love to buy the Orbeez filled tardigrade, even with the staples.
“Think masturbation with consequences” I don’t know why but this killed me
Man its amazing what can be considered alive
Jerry obviously has lock down neurosis like the rest of us. "No Jerry. That's NOT an excuse."
Fuckin Jerry
I love these vids
Never thought I'd hear a comparison to viewing Tardigrades w/ POV pornagraphy...Well played sir...Well played.
I'll take a bag of glass coated Doritos. TIK TOK fame here I come!
This Jerry reminds me of Rick and Morty's Jerry.
I love water bears. I want a stuffed one.
jerry fucks my whole day up i cant believe the shit he tries 2 pull some days
So wen I take a 🚿 are these things in my water eating my body up🤔😳
can you do "True Facts: Jerry" just so you can make a whole video about him
Excuse me, but is this meant to be all ages information? There is a porno reference right at the beginning of this. No offense, but why is that in there? I can learn about Tardigrades elsewhere. Not sure why you feel the need to introduce "porno" as a reference in a film about this.
Lol get a dog
smeuth
I'd like to befriend Jerry, please and thank you
POV
My son got me hooked on this channel. Never a dull moment. I'm always laughing while learning, which is (IMO) the BEST way to learn. 😅
Jerry, the tardigrade maker
Thought I’d watch something relaxing before I fell asleep. Now I’m laying here crying in a puddle of pee. Thanks guy.
I wish I was a tardigrade - life would be so simple... And I will poop crystals!
I can honestly cannot get enough of these videos. I laugh so hard everytime and just deeply appreciate the original content and the smiles the whole thing gives me! Thank you zefrank!
I love both your voice and your sense of humor.  Thanks for the giggle.
I love your channel. You should post more.
I could listen to you all day, you make me giggle giggle and smiley smile all the while learning something interesting. 😀😊❤️
so that's how galaxies are made.  Now I know that I'm just the creation of an Intergalactic Tardigrade.  Thank you
465 diatoms watched this video
That benedikt sure got you some good footage!
The Earth is the Universe to the very small
I wish I could poop galaxy out
G's man this was the first ad on youtube I didn't try to kind of click over. I'd listen to this guy read toilet paper.
Well i now have a whole new sci fi concept where the universe was created from a galactic tardigrade poop.
If we could learn this in  school science, more of us would  have paid  attention! LOL
This was *WAY* more educational than most of his other videos. Like I was genuinely feeling like I was watching a real documentary,  lol
I love comedic edutainment.
Behbeh 👶
"After the head comes three body segments, each with a pair of legs. Finally, they have a butt segment, which also has a pair of legs." Killed me. XD
Tartigrades help convict murderers as well, puts these little guys into perspective
Wow, their mechanism in surviving in space is probably one of the reasons why life started on Earth. Truly fascinating! Next thing you know, ores are actually micro poo! Truly fascinati- Wait... Dear god...
Good stuff.
GOLD @10:00: "Think masturbation with consequences!"
If I don't get reincarnated as an octopus or squid it better be a tardigrade or imma throw hands.
Jerry, get your shit together hahaha
Why does Jerry still have a job? He never gets it right😖
I loved this haha facts plus jokes makes for a happy Matt
I thought they were called water bears.
"Black and white"
Is it weird that I think tardigrades are adorable and wish they were dog sized? I want to cuddle with one.
See this on a big screen . See it again on phone to read comments !
I learned a few things.  Most importantly, that they have an enormous poop size to body size ratio.  Delivering poop behbies on the regular.
Why do I have dejavu? I thought you've done tardigrades before
This guy had Tardy Grades in school.
No... all of them need therapy. Gotta love the freaky freaky tardigrade!
I am so happy you were in my recommendations! I love the calm and humorous commentary you give alongside the classic elegant music. Subbed :)
We really need a True Facts about Jerry.
I saw the title and just thought "Tardigrade don't care." It's become a reflex to seeing/hearing the word. So glad to have Ze videos sprinkled in here and there during this unending lockdown.
bebbiez
Hey, I love David Attenborough! Be nice, jealous  much?
White Morgan Freeman
"MOISTURIZE ME!"
Educational and hilarious! Well done.
I LOVE JERRY!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the thing that survive everything
i wish i pooped crystals....... wait
What was your earliest memory?  Pass. Can I pass?
Sooooo....essentially you're saying we might all be tardigrade poop!
Literally sounds like you are taking to 5 year olds
I wonder how much some tardigrade poop jewelry would cost.
I love it when he says bebe ❤
Pretty poop
That was truly fascinating. Wow, I need to watch it again.
Thank you
We live in Tardigrade poop.
And no one is going to talk about that song at the end of the video are they?
"curiosity shower" sounds kind of dirty, doesn't it. Lol
Hetero water bears??? but where r my gay water bears they even have BEAR in the name 😤
455 people (so far) have no sense if humour.
Next paper I submit hat has a microscope image I'm using "small" as the scale bar.
Oh my god I shuddered when he said masturbation with consequences...
Someone should show this to Justin Roiland and Chris Parnel. They could dub it in character as Rick and Jerry
awsome
Thanks for the good morning laugh. And teaching lesson.
YAAAAY! You finally did a video on my favorite animal! I watched this while holding my giant plush tardigrade and eating pizza. It made up for my crappy day at work.
Thank you so much for finally clarifying what those water balloon things inside are!
What’s the song from the last 15 secs of the video?!   Just spent 15 minutes searching “just wanna see boobies like we in a big movie” with no results and a need to clear history
And 8 years ago can you believe he made a true facts video about morgan Freeman
Ok, but, they're actually kinda cute...
Oh ze frank, thank you for coming back. We were all in desperate need of our YouTube David Attenborough
There is so much wrong with the statement "Take a curiosity shower."
Diving bell spiders at some point please
I love these videos so much. From the music, to Jerry, to the creative pronunciation sometimes used. I curl up and watch these on a loop when I’m down, instantly comforting. Thank you
"Getting very dead"
I do love that you recognize that these moss piglets need a designer.
Temperatures below 273 degrees celsius? Also known as absolute zero? I'm not a physicist but as far as I can remember, it's not possible to go lower than that.
Hilarious and informative!
I WISH I COULD FAVE THIS MORE THAN ONCE!!?!? I have loved waterbears since I was in high school and have plushies of them, but I've never seen such great footage of them before! Thank you so much for covering these awesome lil beans!!!
Tardigrades are the future
Oh how I’ve missed these tidbits from ZeFrank!!!
Aaah after the ending the ear worm is back
My new spirit animal.😂
so tardigrade's reproduction is basically.....   using a sex doll with consequences
This is great as always but...i need more songs.
I think it is called fetish rather than straightforward perv.
I want to live as a moss piglet
This should have been recommended to the crew of the USS Discovery
No one is going to talk about the fact that tardigrades hide two stone daggers in their mouth? And they stab their prey in the gut with retractable mouth-knives, only to suck out the entrails through the hole? That's how tardigrades do. Metal. A.F.
This is an eutardigrate. It means "The True Tardigrate". Some also calls them Water Bears.  We call'em moss piglets :3
Amazing video
“Think masturbation with consequences.” 😂😭😂😭😂😭
TRUE FACTS WRONG: STAR TREK DISCOVERY STOLE  THE STORY  FROM AN PC GAME ON STEAM. one rule for them, one for me
In this one he sound more upbeat
What would happen if a honey badger got a lot smaller, grew a more butt legs, shat galaxies, and had exactly the same number of £¥<|<$
Do honey badger please
I really don't think I could ever have too much zefrank . I know this to be true because when I have finished viewing the new video I return to the first ones and begin the whole process again LOL
I've never been so envious of another creature's poop before.
Tardigrade: How many layers of cellular defense are you on? Algae and bacteria: Like 3 or 4 my dude. Tardigrade: You are like little baby watch this. Tardigrade: S U C C
3:55 “He’s a bit of a mess.” I’m in this image and I don’t like it.
Coinciding nicely with my bio lecture
I wanna pet it...
you can tell, Jerry is trying his best.
Give this guy Jerry a raise. 😂 He is a master innovator.
I remember this guy from the animal planet series Most Extreme
What... what if the universe is just Tardigrade poo...?
"Think masturbation with consequences" LOL!!!! Im DYING!!! hahahahahahaahahahaha
So today I learned that tardigrades poop crystals
Don't forget they like to dance to Taylor Swift
I would gladly purchase the stapley moss piggy
Imagine if there we were those things to other larger beings in the universe and they were just looking at us that way.
LOL. That description of parthenogenesis is perfect: "Masturbation with consequences."
IS PHIZER ON THIS WE NEED A VACCINE NOW.
liked and commented
please do one for dolphins and their fucked up behaviours
True Facts: narrated by The Incredible Ze Frank.
My favorite commentator talking about my favorite organisms
Jerry deserves a raise
I need therapy now 😳
If you learned all about Lego how did you miss there there is never an 's' added? Lego is the proper for both a single and any multiple of pieces.
These jokes are all painfully horrible. Video w facts only 10/10, video with these jokes 1/10
My new favorite moss piglet video 😅🎊
There's a protein for that ☝️
these jerry-made animals are magnificent.
I’m not really interested in the subjects of your videos, but your humor compels me to subscribe.
I <3 Jerry!  Do you sell t-shirts?
Damn it Frank, leave Jerry alone!
You are my guru
I lost it at "Masturbation with consequences"
Water Bears! South Park fans will get this :p
We know about U Tardigrades now. But I want to learn about the Re-Tardigrades!
I'd love to see a collab with Ze Frank & Hank Green.
Amazing job covering these amazing animals. These guys are darn near invincible!
Finally. A Jerry I like.
I have seen videos of them before but didn't know that much about them they are so ugly they are cute..🤣🤣. I love the narration you are so funny I did not expect it to be funny most of the time nature videos are so serious. Loved it.❤🤣🤣👍
Thumbs up if you could spot the mitochondria- the powerhouse of the cell!
Also love that he mentioned the cryptobiosis haha, anyone who played death stranding know the cryptobiotes that help with timefall are basically floaty floaty big water bears   But yeah, surviving vacuum, super high and low temperatures, they're basically immortal
"Masturbation with consequences"... now that's a man's nightmare
Anyone else agree that he should narrate documentaries like planet earth and stuff?
“Sorta like POV pornography” wouldn’t have been my first comparison but I welcome it 😅
These things must be opposite of humans considering the hetero's are the weird ones.
it made a poop
I learn so much from this show
THIS is the BEST THING I have seen ALL DAY.
All this is in water??!🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮. Well I guess imma die  in Three weeks.
Fascinating
Water bears look like actual bears about as much as sea pigs look like actual pigs
This kind of reminds me of huggbees
I always look forward to the random awkward commentary 🤣 mast with consequences rofl
I see Jerry is maintaining a consistent quality of work
He found the password for his YouTube account again.
I get extreme anxiety after work and your videos make it disappear. Incredible. Thank you sir.
A bit too cute for people who care about such things I think.
Hit like for Jerry
"Now, for most creatures, the technical term for this would be getting very dead." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wonder if this is how God sees us.
Dear Curiositystream,     All but like 3 of your dinosaur documentaries are garbage if you're older than 8 years old.  Fix this shit.
What if our galaxy, or the entire universe is inside of a single tardigrade's poop?! Makes you think, huh?
Before watching this video: I want a tardigrade plushie toy After watching this video: I want a tardigrade plushie full of WATER POLYMER BALLS
This was amazing lol
lol
I had to pause this after "think masturbation with consequences" just to take a minute to appreciate and laugh 😂
Check "Watch a tardigrade shit out a galaxy" off some list
Absolutely hilarious narator!!!
Please tell us about the shoebill bird.
Once again another great video! Thank you.
asking a tardigrade to read the menu for you is rude and lazy. only for tardigrades though.
Star Trek Discovery!!!
I'm huge fan of tardigrades but I've never seen the Marine type. I love that they have cute little suction cup toes, kinda like a gecko, such neat little creatures.
Always time will spent watching your content!!!! I love this channel!!!
I fucking love tardigrades. They're so cute. It still blows my mind that there are animals that small, with little eyes and little feet, and tiny mouths like the head of a spray bottle. They look like they're just merrily going about their business without a care in the world, perpetually going for a nice swim.
Disturbing.  Next time I go hiking and sit down on moss, I'm going to be uncomfortably aware of what's going on right under my ass.  O_O
My favorite animal is finally getting some shine!
Raccoons cld make an awesome video, they’re smarter than ppl generally realize
Thanks very much. Your videos are a garanteed mood lifters even when I'm very low on endorphins. I love you guys and your precious work, wish you all the best and hope you stay with us as long as you want. Cheers 😊
Buddy, this was one of the funniest things I've ever watched. Smart and funny. Get that jerry guy under control will you please, he sounds like trouble.
I love your narration
Jerry gets more powerful with every video.
FINALLY ABOUT TIME YOU DID A SEGMENT ON THESE CUTE LITTLE MOSSPIGLETS!! Thank you!! 😇
How shit would it be if you had to poo crystals
DO A COLLAB WITH JOURNEY TO THE MICROCOSMOS. PLEASE!!
Keep up the good work Jerry.
Omg the guys voice though 🤪🥴💖
Bebes
People who are not your Patreon subscribers are missing at least half the fun. C'mon, people: sign up and play along with Ze while he's still making them!
How phenomenal. Zefrank, we are indebted to you with our lives. This series been enriching my entire life
"...Think masturbation with consequences"
Tardigrades are called "Bärtierchen" in German, which literally means "little bear animals", and I think that's beautiful.
0_0 he who controls the spice, controls the universe XD
Maybe this unverse we live in is just tardigrade poop
I thought they lived in dirt too?
10:02,  i want Jordan Pelee on thiiiss
Love your videos, both super entertaining, as well as educational xD
I love how the electron microscope photographs of tardigrades look like the monsters from Monsters Inc. wearing HAZMAT suits.
If they made a “I wanna see boobies like we’re in a “B” movie” shirt with a picture of a blue-footed booby I’d buy two in a millisecond. One for me and one for my boyfriend 😂
"Now for most creatures, the technical term for this would be getting very dead."
Lol they poop galaxies
very funny and informative. its so great that your making this stuff.
Ok, how'd youtube know I watched Star Trek recently?!
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
This was the best explanation of tardigrades I've ever seen, thanks Ze! ~Trav
Good thing we can't see this with the naked eye 😆
6:45
Fun thing about diatoms is that they can make diatomaceous earth. It’s a great way to keep bugs out of your house without toxic chemicals.
I came here from a video on Shoebills. Please do Shoebills next!
I usually watch for the humor but this is legit freaking interesting
ARGH!  I want to *LIKE* it again
YYEEEEES!!! I live for these videos by this amazing dude. Always cracks me up and teaches me something new. Consider this channel on my 'Notif List' so I know your videos come out immediately!
cool
Finally did an episode on my favorite animal! Everyones always shocked that its an animal, its great. Shine on you little survivor.
I pray that everyone who sees this comment will one day be successful🙏
I like the science style photography!
Too too much
People: "But why is it called a water bear sometimes?" Ze: (permanently erases this question from the human discourse with a single thumbnail)
Bebbes
I sincerely hope Jerry’s real. Is he
I want to kill them
gotta catch'em all!
Who are you calling a fluid filled sack?!?! You’re a fluid filled sack! - Tardigrades
That was a very well done, very cute, voiceover narrative.  I couldn't have done it better.  But I digress.  And everybody wonders, what alien life will be like.  When, we meet it.  Well, I don't know anybody that can do outerspace without an outerspace suit.  And do it for decades.  Perhaps, millennia.  Self autoerotic freeze-drying.  Sounds cool to me.  Let's see?  What galaxy should I head for, today?  Probably one that's got some nice warm beaches.  No Coppertone necessary.  When you are designed to ignore, gamma radiation from Coronal Mass Ejections.  They don't have to worry about sunburns.  Or skin cancer.   And a tiny little critter.  So you can pack lots into asteroids.  Which come smashing into the earth, every day.  And have for millennia.  More than millennia.  Bulimia.  Perhaps that's one way of getting around?  Bulimia.  Where they can spew forth plenty of,, tardy grade's.  From that organic salad.  Into their gut.  And right back into the toilet.  Just minutes later.  As this could have been going on for Bulimia of years.  Karen Carpenter didn't come back.  When they added water.  Knocking on heavens door. RemyRAD
Some species are parthenogenetic which means they can reproduce by themselves solo. Think masturbation with consequences.
Now for most creatures the technical term for this would be "getting very dead."
goddamit jerry
"They poop crystals" and "masterbation with consequences," had me rolling!  Zefrank you are an absolute national treasure.
I've been waiting for the water bears 😁
Oh zefrank. How I've missed you.
looks at my socks: oh no XD
I love tardigrades
I was so busy laughing at this entire presentation that I almost missed the song at the end "Wanna see boobies".. Wait, what? LOL!!
Did he tell about the backwards facing feet and I just missed it?
He got me at, "think m*sturbation with consequences"
i missed those videos.
Plot twist: tardigrade poop is in fact a whole galaxy full of life and diversity. Second plot twist: our universe is tardigrade poop.
Awesome.
I hope that one day we reach a level of technological prowess that would allow me to have pet tardigrades at home in a mini terrarium/aquarium thing and have a magnifying lens or zoomed in video feed to watch them. THEYRE SO FLIPPING CUTE
I would buy a jelly bean filled tardigrade as merch.
"Kale flavored Capri Sun"  NO!!! Just... NO!!  That ain't right!!
Are we not going to talk about When he said «Like a POV pornography» ?
Am I the only one who thinks of "Jerry" from Rick and Morty? XD
Jerry needs to get his shot together
....probably explain my IBS....
damn, Jerry be getting better and better.
"For most creatures the technical term for this [being completely dried out] would be getting very dead"  I lost it.
Acts 2:17-21 [17]And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: [18]And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: [19]And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: [20]The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come: [21]And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved...
Poor Jerry...he tries so hard
After all this time making jokes at Jerry's expense, does Jerry actually exist?
That's amazing. I love it°
I'm waiting for you to do a video on .......... Jerry.  Think that will be very interesting.
Can't poop crystal, but I can sneeze backward!
“Stop playing dicky dicky in the sand.”
Is Jerry real?
The most indestructible bear 🐻 on earth 🌎
Maybe our galaxy is just the poop of a really big tardigrade...
I REALLY wish your vids were around in school days
The Wild Kratts ain’t tell me all this...
I was Looking for David but he isn't there.
NEW VIDEOOOOOOOOOOO
Scientific term : really dead
Looks like water isn't very vegan after all.
Jerry is surprisingly creative.
Thank you for this vid and kisses from Germany
What I wouldn’t give to be in ZeFrank’s high school biology class during project presentations...
If I had this zefrank's voice, humor and creativity I'd never stop talking. Even in my sleep
I just made a quiz on these a little while ago! https://youtu.be/u_LdhzJAkoc
We missed u Zefrank 😔
Water bear is my nickname in high school.
It's like masterbation with consequences.  OMG I DIED
This is hilarious subbed
TINY HANDS
Tnx to you and the discount i subscribed to CuriosityStream, and i love your videos !!!!
I am subscribed to curiosity stream! Best decision of my quarantine life ever~~~💕
Eutardigrade? Based on the description it's definitely a Me-tardigrade.
ZeFrank laughing , life is complete.
These creatures are wild
And they've now colonised the Moon!
Welcome back sir!
That's how a zefrank do
Educational and Funny
I feel like I saw a zefrank tardigrade video long ago but everyone kept telling me it didn't exist.  I got Mandela'd
is it only me but i find tardigrades are kinda cute XD
This video would have been helpful a year ago when I had to do a project on Tardigrades. I could have just pulled this video up for the class and called it a day😅
I know travel through space, like in star wars discovery
I miss the """Morgan Freeman" voice. LOL
I mean look at it, it looks like a little galaxy. What can you do. 🥴🤪😂
What if we are just a giant cosmetic poop from something that is basically just a tardigrade but on a universal scale that appears macroscopic to us?
I must have preserved myself like a tarigrade for years... maybe I'm alittle bit tardIgrade maybe a little dickidicki in the sand (lol)
Ooo curiosity streamy showers
Yay!  My favorite animal!
Just when I have finally and completely purged that song from my head, you sneak it into the end. Why do you do this to me?
will they become the first non native invasive species in outer space?
Glorious ,!
I’m the water bear voiced by Patrick Stewart!
Love these videos but goddamn do these things look gross.
Think masturbation, with consequences. Lmao
Are you telling me South Park wasn’t playing????
I want to poop like the tartigrade do.
this is a work of art and so dumb.
u r the man !
I'm worried about Jerry. He's slowly losing it
Micro knowledge!!
I'm calling on the anime community to make Tardigrade-chan!
is it weird that i actually find these adorable?
Love the narration  "Freaking show off"
They're all so friggin cute!
Today I found out that Jerry is a frustrated photographer and sculptor, who identifies with tardigrades enough to make art inspired by their very existence.
“Big azz eggs form in the female’s body” lol
Amazing!!! You're like a fine cheese, just gets better with age!!!
I would gladly buy that as merch
Some of them need therapy... on tiny moss couches...🤣
I was going to turn down my brightness before I started the video and I accidentally hit the 1 key. Go ahead and press it too and share my shock lol
If I was indestructible and shat crystals, I wouldn't be scatophobic.
I love the voice over guy. he reminds me of the "Dear Kittin" videos.
Can we appreciate that this man started in the early days or YouTube: before ads, professional YouTube's, when YouTube was basically America's funniest home videos, left for years, return in a time when YouTube was basically a television network, did the exact same thing as before, and was successful.
I feel like this narrator has done a funny cat and dog video...
Curiositys best sponsor.
1:40 really said .w.
I love Jerry 😂
This is friggin hilarious, it's always hilarious.
Ze, please reach out to Hank to guest narrate an episode of Microcosmos or two <3
I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THESE BUT I LOVE THEM SO MUCH AND NO ONE ELSE LIKES THEM BIG SAD
I once owned a 750 Arthropod. That thing was wicked fast. Shut up Jerry, you know nothing of Arthropods.
ZeFrank you are the best. David Attenborough got nothing on you... I mean besides the huge corporate sponsorships. But on the skill set, you got his time clock.
Thank god human poop didnt evolve in this direction, yet
IF I WERE A TARDIGRADE I'D MOVE OUT FROM HOME WHY LIVE IN THE SHRUBBERY WHEN YOU COULD HAVE A THRONE🎵🎵
all jokes aside, tardigrades are invincible fuckers.    essentially imortal fuckers
Been waiting for this. Glad you haven't stopped lol. Or dissapeared  for forever and a half
yes, a dorito encased in glass. Now, who's the asshole richguy who will actually buy it?
Therapy on tiny moss couches lol
The hand built models of Tardigrades are gorgeous. Keep rockin' the mad skills, Jerry.
AAAAAAA NEW TRUE FACTS I GOTTA WATCH
6:10 that voice crack
This man is genius
🤣
6:39 Where were we?
2:30 HE SAYS "FUCK JERRY" HYPERPOGGER
'Masturbation with consequences', that is an excellent line! XD
This guy makes learning fun!
I love the booby song
Just remember when all other life has die these bad bois will still be cruising
1:09 came out of left feild
In 2021, there is absolutely nothing new that you can tell us about the most talked creature of the last the decade...
watching this makes me think of that episode of family guy where brian and stweie met those waterbears
You are so entertaining!  Thank you for all the vids!
Awww i want a couple thousand as pets....
Freakin knew it
Just made a cup of coffee and this video popped out in my notifications - now I will enjoy risking not enjoying my coffee.
I wish I pooped galaxies.
What did David do 😭
Broke all of my ribs laughing at "microscope" joke
darn nematodes
You are my favorite part of the internet
Kinda looks like a star nose mole but with more legs
Thanks that was freaky and fun
Jerry is very talented
What fun! Great images, so much information. So Ze Frank!
Gods, Jerry, get it together! :D
Tardigrades look like little naked mole rats that are see through Science isn’t a style of photography JERRY
Sorry but I don't like Curiosity... It killed my cat.
I absolutely love you, lol.
This episode was honestly so beautiful
Jokes aside, it makes me question life 😔 These guys are so small they have no idea that we exist, so is the reverse true? Are we just microscopic cells running around doing random shit under some other beings microscope? 🤯 and for them the same? WHERE DOES IT ALL END?!?!?!?!
Frank, you are truly a Renaissance Man. Love it
Are u not on Nebula? It's a service that comes with curiosity stream.
Really outstanding visuals on this one, Frank. And the usual genuine lol commentary. You're a real benefit to biology communication.
Ah very nice, I was researching these the other day.
"Masturbation with consequences" ily narrator
I find the Tardigrade to be quite credible actually.
Unto the breads & ovens with a wish for a new..then income babies..wala..
I needed this today
Dude they are like small robots.
“Sortta like Like PoV Pornography”     Lol lost me there 🤣🤣   edit: what is up with this commentary? Lol is he the entertaining commentator on Discovery?
10:55 is what we came for. If he doesn't say it in his videos I feel so underwhelmed 🤣
God I'm so glad you're still doing epic fun fact videos after all of these years. They're both entertaining and educational and it is amazing. A perfect balance of humor and wise facts.
The process they use to survive ought to be called "Tardigration"
1:42 oh so adorable with those tiny little hands reaching out.
And people tell me watching TV is a waste. Jokes on you, I learned about cryptobiosis from Star Trek!
Can we get a honey badger true facts? I feel like that would be gold
And.........beh-beh’s......
Zefrank I think you need to do the voice over for my existence..... at least my cats if nothing else.
oh no my friend. it's like some woman had wicked sunburn, pealed it off, then used that skin as a maxi pad and put it aside for some dude to jerk off into.
Is Jerry only a figment? I mean I  think Zefrank writes all the material. Jerry is an alter ego. If so this took me a loooooong time to figure out.
He said: “Smeeooothe”..........
Why hasn’t he done true facts about humans?
He really knew we needed this right now
Originally the quote from 2001 - A Space Odyssey was "My God! It's full of tardigrade poop!"
Truly loved this presentation.
“...If Doritos came individually packaged in glass”
#NewFacts 🥵🥴🤔🤯
zefrank1 has me in a coughing fit from laughing too hard. Now I feel good the rest of the day. And my house is literally surrounded in moss. Definitely time to drag out the microscope for some good Tardigrade porn. And just think, millions of channels to choose from.
As a biologist I can say these videos always have plenty of interesting up-to-date facts, but also plenty of good laughs.
yayyyyy the happy vibes are back
Alright,the magnified mugshots of these bear's are not what I would consider "cute". I really hope my katadyne's ceramic filter has been keeping them from my inside's!? He's got 10 claws on his left hand!I just picture him free climbing out my urethra
TARDIGRADE MODEL MERCH?!?! *MAKE IT HAPPEN PEOPLE!!!*
How....does this thing exist. This entire order of life just....existing like this.
Tardigrade therapy, from moss couches.
So unlike roaches these little guys are everywhere but not a nuisance, are cute, and double invincible? Just add water and they're fine?
And... This is how The Zefrank dooo
Thank you for the best laughs I have had in a while! And I got educated, too! Perverts in my water... ew...
It looks like a little galaxy! 🤣
And Nat Geo doesnt abandon david Attenborough for zefrank why???
Funny and informative as always!! Love it!
This video was so aesthetically pleasing to watch.
Tanks Frank
fascinating and funny thanks
Please make video on Sharks.
Very funny and very educational! You get a A+!
2:01 “Jerry that one made a poop! Dont focus on it Jer— Oh good. Now it stuck to its foot.”  LMAO
Educational and entertaining, I like it! 🥰🥰🥰
Did you forget Jerry's birthday or something? It seems like they are acting up abit more than usual.
What if, putting water into mummies would turn them back to a human like a tardigrade?
Just jizz in the water bears trust mr
Ok Im ready to see something disturbing!  10 seconds later   Awwwe that’s soo cuuuute
Always amazing content (even if you’re trying fucking hard to be on point scientifically speaking....and I think you are...I don’t know,I suck at this.....) but this willing to share music....nop.désolé,je ne comprend point.pas sauf dich auf 🙏
Thank you for continuing to make these, they're wonderful! They always make me smile. 💕
"Like a Kale flavored Capri Sun." LOL! The video you stitch together is awesome but it's that exemplary verbiage that keeps me coming back for more.
How can we be sure that our galaxy is not actually a tardi-turd? Like a giant tardigrade ate a milky-way.
Is this thing even from this plant.
I feel like that was far more informative than funny. Still: very funny.
I mean... you *could* sell it as merch
Amazing I love it
I sometimes wonder what the relationship is between zefrank and jerry... quite odd
Ah! My profile pic! Nice to see YOU talk about this one
Okay but like,,,,,,,, the playdough model looked pretty accurate so idk y ur complaining
Jerry was really showing off
Good job Jerry!
Poop crystals LOL 😂
I never thought that not being able to poop crystals would be an issue, yet here we are...
Black alert for the YouTube algorithm
I will urge anyone, especially frank, ze, to look up Captain Tardigrade :)
Captain Tardigrade! Defender of the Multiverse!
Every time I see a diagram of the cell I have an urge to yell, "THE MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL!!!"
Need more of this in my life
TIMMY!..... Do YOU remember what a tardigrade is?!
Oh my goodness you crack me up! Thanks for another great nature video 🤣
That was a GREAT episode!!!  Thank you!
Is Ze Frank the voice for the new Frank’s Red Hot radio ads? They use the phrase “don’t judge”...it has to be him
Blur bnblinch
Love your work
I'm disliking this just for calling waterbears moss pigs
Was browsing anime tiddies when I noticed you had a new upload, so I abandoned the search. I'm glad I still have my priorities straight.
This video came out yesterday on my birthday and it was the best gift I received this year! I am a high school science teacher. I really wish I could show True Facts to my students, but I am not tenured, so I can’t. Love the videos, though! Please keep them coming!
Ah yes, they’re 3.5 smalls in length.
Excellent video, very interesting and educational.    Thanks for posting this video!
🤣😂🤣😂
'Masturbation with consequences'. Hate when that happen
Tardigrades are the real world Kryptonians!
Amazing!!
Me: Preparing for physics lab. YouTube: Perhaps you'd be interested in...tardigrade? Me: Yes.
Love the commentary... amazing little critters...
Damn it, I'd buy a bag of those Jerrybeans in an instant.
Except if you put them in room temp water, they die within hours. They’re weird creatures.
Love it...sooo funny but also informative.
This is awesome
Can we get a video on Jerry?
Yay he’s not dead
Everybody eats everybody
Why can't you be my AP Bio teacher 😭
The very limited eye spots are now called Biden Spots.
"Diatomaceous earth consists of fossilized remains of diatoms...." you should totally do an episode on diatoms and diatomaceous earth. :)
I love you 💕😄
You should do one on the Telescope fish next.
The amazing tardigrade.  Thank you for sharing.....
I learned a lot from this and had a good laugh, hell yeah man.
What kills me (actually them but...) is that they SURVIVE radiation, the vacuum of space, extreme dehydration, extreme temperatures,...  And you know what can KILL them? Snails, worms, spiders, larva, small insects and other tardigrades! xD  So like... WHY?!?
Those fucking things are fucking crazy!!!  Fucking monsters that you can’t even see!   Fuck!
I’ve subscribed to Curiosity Stream forever! Tardigrade critters are my favorite microscopic organisms. They are so cute and adorable and amazingly adept at surviving virtually anywhere! Your descriptions of animals, etc. are priceless and funny, as well as sexually sweet?!
My favourite nature boi
I want to be friends with Jerry
Explaining parthenogenesis as masturbation with consequences killed me
A cryptobiote a day keeps the timefall away
Tardigrades are AWESOME!
Clams are stupid - there I said it
Tardigrades are cool. And they are much smarter than their relatives: The Retardigrades - also known as epidemiologists. Those guys believe the same pathogen could kill here and somewhere else not.  The funny part is they believe that were science (Dunham-Kruger effect). The sad part is: real scientists believe them they’d actually know stuff.
Yes! I love tardigrades! I'm so happy you made a video about them. My life's complete.
Two of my favorite things - True Facts and really good DIC microscopy. (no Jerry, I didn't forget the K)
It looks like a very cute and expensive pet.
Don't encourage Jerry, he mooches on your sympathy.
Always the highlight of my day. Thank you, zee ee eff arr ay en kay. Thank you.
I live 4 your vids! I very impatiently wait & as soon as I see it, I go 2 my hubby, he stops anything he may be doing & we watch & we laugh & we actually learn shit. Also, yours are the only in video ads i don't skip through bc u could make flossing my teeth funny
Poor Jerry, all he's trying to do is expand his artistic repertoire by creating those delightfully weird looking models. aye
Kinda disappointed that there was no attempt at a 'retardigrade' joke.
WOW!    This for sure wasn't by accident.  To much specialization.     ===   Evolution = Self Assembling Atoms = Impossible     =====
Tardy grades? So like.. an F?
Excellent
Been watching Ze Frank's works since 2006 and potentially much earlier. Love it.
I was actually fine with the tardigrade mating habit until an attempt at a human equivalent was made 😨
You should do a true facts on Republican insurrectionists at the Capitol, that would be SO chef's kiss.
should just play that puffin song each time you explain reproduction, be perfect lol
Hey Ze! I love the "True Facts" series you do, but I really miss your vlogs! I wish sometime you can get back to doing them. I've been following you for about 8 years, and you really helped changed my perspective on things in a positive ways. Ways in dealing with depression, being apart of a community/caring for others, as well as looking at life in new perspectives. I want to say thank you for being apart of my life in that sense. I'm sure I'm not the only one who misses the old content. If any viewers here is down, would you like to help me make a community based video on how we miss Ze?? I write music on my channel, and having a ton of people working on this, I think it would reach Mr. Frank.  Stay awesome, Ze! Stay awesome fellow fans!
I’ve always loved tardigrades. They look so cool and they have a very interesting story, awesome video!
I know its been a hot minute since you came back to us after your disappearance.  but never leave us again.  I don't think my heart can take it.
the music made the vibe all the more funnier, i was laughing throughout 😂
Yay new vid to watch with dinner!
Jerry deserves a raise.
Right now, a mummified tardigrade from 2001 could be being moisturized and resurrected.
It’s great to see  zefrank1 back in the studio making videos. Best entertainment on YouTube for sure!
Watch my video 🥶
If I was a tardigrade, I'd move out from home...
now I want a curiosity shower
Is it normal that I find them uncomfortable to look at?
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!
6:48
Waterbears like football too.
Wow!  These little transparent squirmies pack a punch in their DNA!  They're like the Captain Marvel of the microscopic world!
Tardigrade: "I want to be invincible!" Nature: "In what way?" Tardigrade: "I want to be able to survive in a total vacuum." Tardigrade: "And survive at absolute zero.  And super massive doses of radiation!" Nature: "You're microscopic.  You can still get eaten.  But you can at least survive things that will never happen!" Tardigrade: "Damnit..."
How can you talk about a single microscopic organism for 11 minutes and make it interesting?
If their poop looks like a Galaxy then whos pile of sh!t are we living in? 🤔
Ever since I first saw footage of tardigrades, I've been wondering how is it possible for something so small and primitive to be so cute.
We need more of these videos
That POV porn joke got me good.
HES BACK!!!!!!
Fine every one.
Tardigrade my animal spirit... poops out whole galaxies, no wonder they can survive in space. Also, gives me a weird sensation that maybe our galaxy came out of the butt of a massive tardigrade that suffered diarrhea. 😨We are all tardigrade shit!
There is something wrong with Tardi...
The only Space that exists lies between the ears on those who believe it does.
The thing is called a water bear not a moss piglet
The king hath returned!
Imagine if people were like tardigrades and could survive after dehydration
Yes.
priceless.  where are all the tardigrade based children's books?
Kale flavored Capri Sun sounds awful.
I like a bit of humour in learning. It helps me concentrate.
I swear every time this man posts he gets on trending. Deserves it too. So much work that they guy puts into it.
Like POV what now?
Life uhmmm... finds a way
I feel deeply saddened by hearing this venerable channel doing in-video sponsorships but I guess it was inevitable.
Masturbation with consequences....auhauhauhauua...I'm dead!!!!!
I thought you already did a vid on the tardigrade
Finally
Fun fact: We have all eaten a tardigrade at one point in our life. From water to leafy greens, they live in there and we eat/drink them.
Zefrank iz back
Zefrank has been helping me learn and pee my pants from laughing so hard for the better part of a decade now 😂  Thank you sir, you truly are a pioneer of comedy
If I were 3 mm tall I would definitely keep a tardigrade as a pet.
Yay!! a new ZeFrank video!! ((happy hobbit dance))
Taxation is extortion (theft/ non-consensual). Thereby, makes all governments slavery.
You don't learn that in Dragon School... 🤣
Jerry's face reveal?!
This is really funny but this is also the best documentary on tardigrades I've seen. The upclose footage of them eating with their needle-like mouthparts is amazing, as well as the footage of them failing to run on glass 😂
Water bears have like, the prettiest poop
I wonder if tardigrades could colonize Mars?
Thank you zefreank. I apreaciate your effort, work and the information and entertaiment in this and all you videos :D
DAMN IT JERRY! Get your shit together!
Now I know why this video took a while to come out, Jerry had to make those amazing tardigrade models
What's the name of that song in the last few seconds of the video?
This makes my urine microscopy look very boring by comparison.
They said the unicorn can poop out rainbows, mah boi waterbear can poop up sparkles and gems lol
SUBLIME! Beautifully done. Especially the crystal shit :) We couldn't survive Lockdowns without you <3
some of them need therepy....on tiny moss couches ... "what was your earliest memory's" "pass" somebody draw a comic for this.
I like Jerry.
Could you imagine HOW BRIGHT THE MICROSCOPE LIGHT MUST BE FOR THEM! I mean it can see though them! They are just chilling and suddenly SUPER WHITE BRIGHT LIGHT!
OMG, I wish science, back in school, was this fun. Thank you for this!
what's the music at the very end?
"Tardigrade don't give a crap" Really? 'Cause we just saw give craps
This video is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
wait isn't that thing also known as water bear ? i mean how many akas can there be :|

Love these vids keep it up
Dogecoin
Fascinating
This thing is a lot stranger than I gave it credit for It's an almost fully formed, traditional animal, in the sense that we understand them: it's got limbs, a mouth, a stomach, even little claws. It even _acts_ like an animal, catching little foot holds and sniffing things out.  Except it exists on the microscopic level and swims around with diatoms and stuff, a place I am _not_ used to seeing animals. It's like zooming in with your microscope and seeing all the bacteria and cells and stuff, and then finding a dog, just sitting there looking like it has absolutely nothing in common with anything else
It’s a bear
heheh, im impressed by the effort to make those goofy models XD
What if a water bear pooped out our universe.
Ah ze frank..... If you were covered in fingers...
The fun commentary helped me temporarily forget about the fact that we’ve all probably accidentally swallowed tardigrades at the beach
If there was a way to produce an ultra soft translucent material I'd buy a glow in the dark Tardigrade beanie baby from yall.
What if we are the poop of a tiny living form that poops out galaxies?...
Bruh this creeps me out
I needed this!  I love tardigrades even more now.
The song at the end tho is the greatest 11:24
Great
Where have you guys been all my life. You just got a new subscriber.❤️👍
Tardigrades are Amazingk!
If you poop crystals and can read this, go to a medical doctor fast.
Ah Jerry. he is the best assistant ever. Hahaha
S p o r e
So basically... *Smol sea pig*
👏👏 thank you for the humor while teaching! 😂
Jerry put the art in science
I've been waiting for you to do this thing for a long time.
These are always great
Was half expecting Rick to come in and say "Damn it Jerry!"
I don't know who Jerry's tryna  fool. There not SMALL their MICROSCOPIC. Try again Jerry🤪
Don't mess with the moss piglet
zefrank, you should probably let people know if Jerry is just your alter ego before his rapidly expanding fanclub gets even larger
5:36 i live in a galaxy. does that mean i'm living in poop?
Cool.
"What was your earliest memory?" ...."PASS!"
So galaxies are pigshits?
smyooth
Tardigrade merch!!!!
Gawsh, I love Jerry.
That's the best definition to parthenogenesis I've ever heard.
How amazing!
Nature is absolutely incredible!
The technical term for tardigrades' cryptobiosis is "alarmingly hard to kill."
Boy, humans really got shafted in the evolution process.  I mean we can't even poop a galaxy.  We can pee stones but that tend to hurt a lot and isn't a healthy process of the body.  Also, Zefrank!  When are you going to drop a CD so we can hear all thise awesome animal songs?!
1:09 "sort of like POV Pornography."
Littel moss bebbeh
Jerry just wants to be appreciated!
I am very impressed with the in-depth information. Jerry needs help
Bebes
Imagine that our universe is made of giant tardigrades' poops, and the poops of small tardigrades we can see under the microscope are mini galaxies with atom-sized planetary systems. And so on...
Science isn’t a style of photography, Jerry!
Jerry is just try his best to replicate it
:)
I didn‘t know there were Tardigrades that weren‘t smeewth
Just when I think boredom is finally going to finish me, zefrank produced another true facts video and I'm saved.  Funniest man on the internet.
Just when you think nature has enough strange methods of reproduction the waterbears say 'Hold My Cuticle!" lol
Chiton Claw sounds like a bad@$$ kung-fu style.
Just discovered where slither.io came from 5:31
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
Tardigrade poop is probably the coolest thing I've ever seen in a YouTube video.
Ok but the heck you take a curiosity shower? Do you use some kind of "curious" material?
So its Spore: cell stage?
Thanks, Ze Frank for yet another delightful, if not slightly perverted, video. Great Subject! Gotta love those Tardigrades!
Zcash (ZEC)
The narration is phenomenal!
Yes! I've been waiting for this!! 😀
pov pornography, was something you really had to say like seriously there was nothing else that could’ve taken the place of that 😂
“They don’t teach you THAT in dragon school!”😝  Worth the wait, as usual!!!!
I think I saw Mulholland
I just realized that tardigrades are the smallest organisms that look like animals.
Go pro stock is about to blow 🚀🚀 Get in right now!!!!
we are now just the poop waste of tardigrades
Imagine if my dude did a whole movie like this. Omfg the epicness of it all ❤
Gonna listen to my favorite cover band: Crystal Shits
looks like a little galaxy. ....😂😂😂.....that's some cool poop
For the first time, I couldn't understand a thing🙄
This man is a genius
nice Jerry
Need Jerry's Instagram asap.
Jerry's Jellybean tardigrade plush demand is about to soar higher than a baby tardigrade's therapy bill.
Cce
Hey! That's me!
"Think masturbation with consequences." That's a terrible thought.
I would love to see a video about various nematodes
Funny... I was thinking about how tardigrades can survive the world without elements and this came up on my notifications.
I want to sub to this channel over and over again...quite the content.
I'm going to need you to put the humble potato bug on your list of creatures to feature. My grandmother called them "ninas de la tierra" or something-I wasn't really listening because I was terrified of the damn things and her yard was lousy with them. There was some folklore about them stealing children's souls or somesuch.
Somehow I knew you would make a video on Tardigrade. Pretty sure even Star Trek (new one, Discovery) showed these guys as "aliens" in one of their episodes
true facts!
"He's walking on the ceiling again" lol
I thought the title was the incredible tangerine
Gotta say, Jerry is stepping up his game.
I have been waiting for this video my entire life. Water bears are my favorite.
Think masturbation with consequences🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm so impressed how this channel provide true facts about science even a non science guy can understand and while being an asshole haha...
AKA Water bears*
"Tardigrade don't give a crap" 🤣
loved it
Im new , and this guy’s voice is satisfying
Congrats on trending
If I ate a tardigrade would it live in my tummy yummy for ever ?
Zefrank put the idea of "kale flavored Caprisun" into my mind now!
Comment
What if our galaxy is just tardigrade poop?
I LOVE the Blue Booby song at the end! I watched that video like 30 times.
Moss piglet?? We called it the Water Bear
Thank zefrank. I have been with you channel long before the 5 year break and am happy to see these again I miss this.
Ah. A new true facts. I can stay sane for another month
POV PORN? WTF?
I love you Jerry
Oh thank you thank you ❤️.  There isn't enough of you in the world!!
They frickin’ poop crystals.  What do you do ?
YouTube recommended does it again
I got a baby elephant vacuum cleaner.
"They pooped cryatals" Yes
what happened to peppa pig
Ohh Frank Stick to the macrocosmos, you do good with that
This is wonderful
I love your videos so much
That is the most beautiful poop I have ever seen! Their poop is mesmerizing!
Moss piglets!
You can say everything to jerry but you can never deny the guys creative
If this channel was the source of all those science videos from high school...I would of learned something. Lol
The apocalypse happen Tardigrade : i've got a protein for that
I'm glad you covered these guys.  Both evolution's engineering marvel, and strange, gross perves.
The galaxy is made out of GIANT SPEHHSS TARDIGRADE'S POOP that's some lovecraftian shit right there
I think I've been waiting nearly 7 years for this vid to appear... And it was well worth it! So thorough and insightful, yet hilarious as per usual. Dang it, Jerry!
Someone skipped butt leg day
I love those lil water bears so cute.
Thank you, Zefrank! First sponsor I've ever actually purchased after checking out! Can't wait to dive in, there's a lack of good documentaries on most streaming services.
Show off!
You're not jealous of David Attenborough, are you zefrank? 😏
I loved it! It was so funny and makes microscopic organism fun to learn. Did not know such tiny living moss piglets lived in water.  😁😂❤
5:44 Galaxy poop
I missed these guys
True facts of Jerry
They Live.
Oh i love this videos
Makes a great insult too now that certain words have been banned.
I love you! You're my Tom Jones! If you were doing this live on a stage, I'm sure you'd get pelted with bras! :D :D :D
Poor Jerry. The harder he tries, the less intelligent he gets.
Scientist: "So we managed to create 1 meter big Tardigrades" Normal person: "Do they still have their proteins that protect them from cold, heat and radioactivity?" S: "Yes" N: "Do they still super hard needle able to puncture sillica and suck every liquid from a target?" S: "Yes" N: "Do they still have their bio armor shell cells making them so flexible they are basicaly invulnarble to trauma damage?"  S: "Yes" N: "Are they still omnivores?" S: "Yes" N: "All it takes for them to stay alive is moisture, on a moist planet, and are they still able to reproduce easily?" S: "Yes" N: "That doesnt sound like a good idea, arent humans mainly just soft liquids?" S: "Eeeerm..." American military guy: "Can i have some?"
CLAMS VIDEO. ITS TIME. YOUVE KEPT US WAITING LONG ENOUGH AFTER YOU ROASTED THEM IN A PREVIOUS VIDEO   love you, please make a clam video
Now this is gold
Informative and comedic. Likey
Thank you
my earliest memory was me gaining sentience after taking a shit.. no joke gained sentience mid shit
Another hilarious video! Well done, can't wait to see more.
Well zef stop blaming jerry for making that pic colorful, at least it was pretty  Ugh
One Huge like in advance. Now going to watch this little fellows 😁👍🙏💯 Edit:- very scary
"It is how the tardigrades do!"
Wait...I thought we all pooped crystals!  I should see a doctor
Masturbation with consequences is a horrifying prospect.
If my bio professor had 1 millionth of your creativity, I would’ve cured cancer by now.
Come on Jerry...
Oh man
Goddamn you zfrank! I JUST got that puffin muffin song out of my head last week!  You fight dirty😭 Good info about the walking anus bear though lmao
That footage was mesmerizing. Thanks for yet another lesson that was fun & edumacational.
That was Hilarious! I can see you pulling a Mystery Science Theater 3000 on an David Attenborough film. Great stuff, Thanks! jbc
This is my favorite episode you've ever made.
"Masturbation with consequences" is now forever stuck in my mind. Thanks, man
Come on, Jerry.
"Look at that it's beautiful !"  So a literal piece of excrement has gotten better complements than I have ever gotten my life .
Why am i so entertained.
Your amazing 🤣
I adore these, and this one made me laugh harder than I have in a while. Thank you for all the work that is put into your videos:)
Jerry is an Idiot  _______________________________________________________ *Change my Mind*
They so cuteeeee 😭
Moss piglet
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😜
I'm so happy I could poop! I mean pop. Or do I? I'll never tell Anyway I enjoyed this a great deal.. .
Ah tardigrades.  They're immune to pretty much everything.  Except being eaten.
I got a tardigrade in elementary school once..
You made me subscribe to Curiosity, when others failed. When you said 14.99 a YEAR...you had me. And when it said ZeFrank , you had me more
as the zoology 101 ta said... Teddy bears!! super cool guys to study, especially when you get to see them under the microscope.. and I have to say, I enjoy your voice overs almost as much as Attenborough. you should do more nature oriented ones. and bring Jerry along too.. haha
Water bear don't care. Moss piglet gonna get it.
A yo is that carbon 0:
4:02 no no they dont, one of the reasons i cut mine off
It is incredible how much these things act like mammals but are so tiny. This is also some insane footage.
We’re all just inside of a water bear’s poop.
WOW. I did not know they could dry up and be like that for decades and still come back! That's amazing
The more you know
Thanks Frank! Best tartigrade footage I've seen!
Photograph isn't a form of science? I disagree
You know that it's gonna be a good day when Zefrank uploads a new video...
ive been waiting for this
Helpful hints: To all  who have channels. Make sure you make the hashtag the name of your channel and put it in your title for more views.
if you ever need a song about tardigrades, cosmo sheldrake made one
And now I wonder why these tardigrades are not conquering the universe. Evolutionarily they are the real OGs and figured out a total masterplan. Is there a predator for them?
I think this thing was in Ant Man👀
Tardigrades are so incredibly adorable for literally no reason and I love that.
10:02  Man that's scary 😂
...I didn't know they could look like microscopic blood demons.
Just what I needed to start my day.
I love how you can still learn a lot from these video and strangely even though I always expect a tasteless joke to be made, they never feel out of place and tie right into the knowledge part.
-------- SMALL
"They frigging poop crystals! I mean what can you do? Not that." :( well... i can do cool stuff too!
Why do we haveto wait this long!! Huhu
I love u
jokes aside, i luv how u sometimes make your own props to illustrate a concept/piece of information esp when there's no existing footage of it (like in 8:35)! 😆
#11 on trending!!!!! 🤩
Wow so fricken interesting man the tardigrades are fascinating.....☺
Haha ‘science isn’t a style of photography Jerry’
How all encompassing this is!
Man, I wish I could poop crystals.
Another fantastic chuckle vid!
I wonder, can we use electron microscopes to see microscopic life?? Because electron microscopes can zoom even closer than a normal microscope. But not photos...
Exotic Amor, nice
Real nerd stuff? Booooo. I’ll take my nerd stuff goofy Frank style.
I knew a lot about tardigrades already thanks to Journey to the Microcosmos, so my main takeaway from this video is that galaxies are made from tardigrade poop. Neat!
If resilience was an animal the tardigrade would be it
Strange how the ad gave me the best laugh as zfrank was looking over viewing choices, "Oh, there's David Attenborough. Show off."
I love this series. Although I wish ashow would come back. I loved your vulnerability in those videos!     Also we share birthdays so that’s fun
How tf do we have microscopes that can catch these suckers on film?
LOVE your videos!!!!!
7:10 I'm laughing so hard
Aw they look like the Baymax of the micro-world
I just imagine the host saying Jerry like Seinfeld said Newman!
I absolutely love your videos. Your fantastic. Haha you could do tardigrade therapy, like cat therapy. 😂
Bruh #11 on trending. Everybody likes True Facts
I love how people are actually learning stuff from this.
Omfg that's really wicked funny shit.....I couldn't stop laughing through the hole video
Tardigrade when anything bad happens: There's a protein for that ;)
after that clip at 5:44  maybe we're all living inside of another tardigrade poop
learning and being humoured from this...
Fun fact: they were originally called Homotardigrades and Heterotardigrades, but due to persecution one of them had to change their names.
True Facts? is there any other facts?
small _________
The puffin song should be the default outro song.👌
1:08 i'm done
Well now, those are...disturbing...don't know why.
The potential of the tardigrade to evolve for a thousand or million years because of its incredible survivability is amazing. It can even outlive us humans if some great calamity or a destructive WW3 occurs and wipes us all.
Great as always
So my mind is like: isolate the antiradiation protein and get the patent for 'radiation poisoning Tardigrade drink'....
It's like I can see the entire poo-niverse   (leaving the hyphen out was considerably worse)
*"They freakin' poop crystals!"* - zefrank1 2021
Love these vids need more
So that's where galaxies come from
Stupid narrator😑
I never realised quite how mangled they get while drying out
I love that they used these in Startek Discovery
Jerry is awesome! Some of his best work!!!
It's been too long since a new video, as usual this one didn't disappoint.
WE LOVE YOU ZEFRANK!!!
WaterBearWithME when times are dire
"Its what they Do" 😄
Jerry
9:43 looks like there’s a little demon in the corner made of the poop wth
Excellent, educational and funny! What else do you need for the sex lives of   tardigrades to be forever branded into your brain?  Thank you!
*Where are all my Journey To The MicroCosmos fans at??*
Having to poop a crystal would really hurt.
The same animal from star trek discovery?
Love thease vidio so much thank you  What is that song at the end of the vidio it's stuck in my head and I love it
That was completely fascinating and hysterically funny.
I want a tardigrade plushie.
this was so good ☺️👍👍 love it 💘💘💘😻💘😻
Hahahahahahahaha! One of the best so far!
I need a dessert modeled after tardigrade poop now
Imaging making a blow-up doll of yourself to give birth for you... and that is how the space-bear do.
In Germany, we call them Baertierchen - Bear Animals. Good to know that they have weird names in different languages too
This is my spirit animal.
Big man Frank dwag
This is probably the best tardigrade footage/video on YouTube
That’s so cute!!! 🥰
OH IF I WERE A TARDIGRADE I'D MOVE OUT FROM HOME , WHY LIVE IN THE SHRUBBERY WHEN YOU COULD HAVE A THRON E
9:34 So that's what USS Discovery jumps into every time they did the spore jump.
That is likely the world's most beautiful poop.   And I'm certain this is something I never thought I would ever say.
What the last song ? anyone know?
Thank you so much! These lil thangs are my favorite! 👩‍🔬🔬
As a drunk person. This is fascinating and took forever to type
I literally learned the same amount of info as i would've in my university level course just now - so be thankful
how this thing ended up on trending is beyond me, but at least the humans are not entirely fixated on teenagers and the silly things teenage acting like people do.
glowing poop!
this is funny AF
Only fans of the Discovery would understand why this is recommended to them..
If humans are parthenogenic, the earth would be overpopulated in no time.
schools everywhere should request a zefrank1 series ...
Can we make them pets. They are so cute.
do a jerry reveal
I'm here for the Fxxx jokes......I mean, knowledge
Zefrank is so creative. Its great
Finally someone made a video of this
Now this is the one I've been waiting for!
Yo' Frank, let Jerry be creative, man. He's trying.
"Think of a masturbation but with consequences"  Bro I can't 😂😂😂😭😭😭
THIS IS BEYOND AMAZING 😭😭😭😭 WHERE HAVE THIS  CHANNEL BEEN❤️❤️
Great one!
“ this isn’t some *pass me the lip-balm* I’m feeling chapped sort of dry  “
zefrank man, it's 2021, please give us 1080p videos...
Yuk
YES!!! Can't wait to watch this!! Since the Teaser I've been waiting for the notification... Hooray!!!!  And yes, I just abused exclamation marks, but I'm mad for Tardigrades and that's the truth.
Please consider doing an episode on the upright walking gorilla at the Philadelphia zoo. Thank you.
Now all I can think about is the “Tardigrade Song” by Cosmo Sheldrake.............
somebody likes Will Ferrell
Do one about Corona virus! 😅
This keeps me educated yet entertained
Art 🥰👍
Sooo... mini Jesus?
LOVED IT! Love them all actually. Though a lot of the humor goes over his head ( which I suppose i ought to be grateful for ) my now twelve year old son gets a kick out of your videos. This one is going to tickle him silly. We've been saving money to get a nice microscope, specially for the purpose of finding and viewing tartigrades. Thank you and your crew for being hilarious, informative and truly one of a kind!
This was a very good episode, well done Ze the information about how it survives all those crazy circumstances  was amazing ❤
I don't know man, it all looked real to me.
This one had more great jokes than your average, great work.
Kale flavored Capri sun!?!?  I laughed and threw up in my mouth at the same time 🤦‍♀️
Top content as always
I love the creator I'm amazed everyday from what is created in this realm there is beauty and love in all things.
OUR GALAXY IS JUST TARDIGRADE POOP
The small grade should've said 'smol' instead, then it might've been believable.
YEEEEEEES!!!!
Guess i'll just... not eat
Amazing wee beasties :)
"Masturbation with consequences" Oh mai.
Fukkin amazing!
Tardigrades are my new favorite animal
Sooooooo glad you're back. I <3 these videos!
That oil on your nose is the waste.
I'm gonna go fetch myself some wild moss and start up a Tardigrade village.
Ahh so thats what u make
A Zefrank video is not complete without at least one ' behbeh' and a 'deur'
Can these proteins be synthesized to protect human cells from damage?
You bring me life and information yet again
Pliz give me a shout out
I thought it was very interesting when a giant Tardigrade was used to run a Spore drive on Star Trek Discovery. Another great educational video by a guy who knows we learn more when we laugh. Now how about Diptera? They make up a huge percentage of the insect population on the planet!
Love the content keep up the great work!
Every time I laugh out loud. I can never watch one of these without cracking up so hard I have to pause just so I can breathe.  This series is masterful.  It's how it do. #Smyooth
Zefrank: “look at its crystal poop, looks like a galaxy!”   Me having an existential crisis wondering if our universe is just comprised of a much larger Tardigrade’s poop.
Deja' vu
scientists do be pervs
I sense a personal vengeance behind the name "David" 🤔😁
So you're telling me I've been drinking water with living things in it that are taking a shit and making babies in it?
Tardigrade overhyped ngl
True Facts: Jerry
Where are my Journey to the Microcosmos viewers at?
Aren't we all bags of fluids when we think about it?
'Egg-filled Skinbag' is the name of my new band. Or child. Either one.
"Oh look, there's David Attenborough. Show off" best paid promotion line ever
Wait, how do you kill a nematode then?
Stop playing dickie dickie in the sand!
we need true facts about jerry
no lunar tardigrade mention? That demands a sequel! Rise of the Moon Bears....  Moss Pigs in Space.  wait, can't do that one.  Disney owns everything.
I think you just gave some killers out there the great idea of skinning people and then ejaculating in them o.o so anticipate that being in the news...
YESH
I love how he would be talking about something and as soon as the animal does something weird he has to address it.
Rarely has a documentary made me laugh so much :'D
1:14  awwww... he looks like a plushie!
How is this not a collaboration with Hank Green?
This one is just brilliant. Jerry was on his A-game here.
Awesome. I love these!!!
that old skin uterus is next level recycling
Jerry trying his best tho
trending
Always liked Tardigrades
Big ass eggs😂
YAY IT'S FINNALY OUT. I was so excited hear you talking bout them. I have to say, this video was so high quality, you could sell that.
What i would do to literally poop crystals
i was wondering if they're in drinking water..
7:04 LMAO
Dammit, Jerry
i have never tried, but it seems like pooping crystals might be painful.
You forgot the Retardigrades
Zefrank :Think masturbation with consequences                         😂🤣😂😂🤣😂 So many Be-be's
great stuff!
"Science isn't a style of photography, Jerry." That's a genuinely fantastic quote. Much like this entire episode.
They are so cute
im very itchy now..
This man and his videos is why YouTube was created
Okay but real talk I would pay very good money for a tardigrade plush
I actually think I hate these little bastards now. I always had a relationship with water bears best described as ‘indifference through warmth’. But now? I think these little ‘thing-wit-no-Kurt-Russel-or-the-rest-,-they’re-all-actually-very-delightful-actors,-but-still-the-thing-with-no-Goldie-,-wait...-I stand by it all.’” And -‘“
TY needs to make a stuffed version of this. I think it would sell like crazy.
No, it's not necrophilia, he is just "depositing sperms into the old molted shell of a female tardigrade that just so happens to have unfertilized eggs" you perv
what do they drink, crystal poopsi?
#FreeVoxJerry
Human -"your shit stuck to your foot' Tardigrade - 'yeah but can you survive in space?'
More informative than funny this time.
I have been waiting for this true facts video ever since the samd bubbler episode.
True facts: face mites
1:30 - that's my Spore playthrough.
the dislikes are from crystal poops...
Beh-bays
With all the stuff that's happened already, I think I needed something like this in my life right now.  Thank you!
I'd love to see a video on how the Jerry do. What an odd, mysterious creature that Jerry thing is.
THESE ARE MY FAVORITE CREATURES AHHH. I LOVE THIS CHANNEL
So essentially, when you're swimming and you feel something bite you that wasn't there...he was always there.
Tardigrades crap crystal galaxies. Absolutely incredible.
Tardigrades: Just add water.
Yeah, yeah the earth was created in 7 days...
I like everything about their reproductive cycle, Frank.  It sounds graphically delicious.  I'm over sixty, too.  What does that make me?  A Tarter-perv?
THIS. IS. MIND. BLOWING!!  There's so much life and activities on a microscale
Water bears
I love Tardigrade!
Incredible, as always
Thanks again, ze...you are ze best!
Kind of like POV porno ??lol wtffffffffff
LOVE YOU!!!
Enjoyed your video and I gave it a Thumbs Up
Hi, I'm Big Head Bob!
So how do they know how long they can live
too many jerry jokes
These videos give me life
I first learned about this creature in a The Most Extreme episode and it's been one of those random animals I remembered too well over the years. So cute.
Jerry is very artistic...🎨
And a very few traverse the Mycelium network to travel the universe at faster-than-light speeds. And yes, this does actually qualify as the most ridiculous thing in Star Trek.... even beating out the joystick on the Enterprise’s bridge floor, and “red matter”. 😉
What's that song that plays at the end?
This was released on my birthday!
How does Jerry still have a job?
HAVE I BEEN DRINKING THESE LITTLE FRIENDS?!?!
"Behbehs"
Best one yet! Hahaha
I LOVE YOU MOSS PIGLETS
I missed you so much. Welcome back
Who the fuck calls it a moss piglet???? It's always been Water Bear
When I saw this new zefrank I got all excited and made the family watch it. These are great! Please don’t stop.
<3
Looks like a microscopic bear
It is very creative
I have waited so long for this video, and it was worth it! Day = made
If only I can $#!t galaxies, just like God do.  Oh!   ZeFrank... You're a smart guy? Can you answer a question for me.   Do you think it's called SAND because it's in between the SEA and LAND?
SO SMEWTH
Moss Piglet might be my new favorite word
I could poop crystals too it just wouldnt be as fun to watch
Does a tardigrade have enemies?
Thank you for the great video.
Perverts !! 🤯🤯🤯
Nasty when u think about it small things that exist and we don't see everyday
Wow. Made it on trending. Nice.
"Masturbation with consequences." Friggin' lost it! 😂
I just want to call them arachnids to make them a little scary, for street cred.
I love water bears!
I've missed you Ze! Glad to see you. ❤
#CommentsforAlgorithm
Imagine having a pair of legs on your ass . That's a legitimately relevant comment I just made... Never change Zefrank XD
Thicc BUT smol BUT STILL THICC
My god, Spore is actually accurate in the micro world
@Barbascura X  Vincenzo è stato qui
1
Tardigrades are like.. (checks notes) POV pornography. _ah yes_
2:33 what candy is that? it looks good
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for showing video photography of tardigrades! It is difficult to get an idea of what they look like, as most sources show exclusively electron micrography of them!
Love water bears. I learned about them by the space anecdote, but it's cool to learn even more about them.
Parthenogenesis: Think of it as masturbation with consequences. 😂
True Facts  Best Facts
I just love your videos!!! So funny! And informative.
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE 😍💜
So basically in a thousand years, these things are gonna rule the Earth.
Captain tardigrade!
Today's episode of Journey to the Microcosmos is weird
Water bears are pretty cute
Still waiting for the clams video.
I think i need to wait for couple of days first before watching this. Cuz' if i missed i joke, then i can find it in the comments section.
HAHAHAHAHA I'm DEAD!
Iv been waiting for this one!
Don’t forget, they also help guide Starfleet ships through the mycelial network! 🖖
wait... diatomes are silicon lifeforms?!?!?!?
Do not watch while having spaghetti dinner.
The Internet wouldn't be cool without zefrank!
“Science isn’t a style of photography Jerry” - Tell that to NASA man. Even now in 2021 they’ve yet to produce even one non CGI photograph of Earth. Only cartoon “images”.
If scientists don’t make these things the size of gerbils, I will claim that the earth is flat, we never went to the moon, and there is no Santa.   You have been warned scientists, hop to it!
At last.
Idk you all... but they are actually cute.
Tardigrade merch.  IT MUST BE
Aren't we all really just fluid filled sacs?
Tardigrades are my favorite animal :D
So you're saying I can't drink pure water?
ZeThanks ZeFrank! This was both Zentertaining and it was ZeForking FUNNY! Cheers! Eh!
They are also the last hope of the NFL.
Water pigs are amazing.
5:45  Oh like a little galaxy cool...  *realizes our universe might be an enormous poop made by an ever bigger water bear  ...wait a minute
What is the song at the very end credits of the video? 11:25
Are the crystals they poop the matter in your eyes on the morning?
Finally... one I’m not trying to do like they do…😓
Plus they can traverse the Mycelial network.
"Masturbation with consequences" -Zefrank,2021-
This was so cool! Thanks! 😊
Basically live forever, glittery poop, social distancing reproduction and lose weight instantly. I'm in lol
“Tarigrade don’t give a CRAP!” is where I lost it.
"Learned all about LEGOs", except, apparently, that the company's preferred plural for their product is just LEGO. I'm not saying I agree with that, but I'm doing my duty as an internet jerk for the day.
"Shmnooth"
Zefrank, can you do one on hellgrammite s please?! 😄😂
I wanna say hi to Jerry.
Very nice!
I will totally accept this monthly upload schedule
I just love this guy.
Thank you, I love my water bears and this is just what I needed
TierZooooo....we know you will comment on this, do not predent you dooonnnn't!
1:10 And great now Im too scared to drink water.
You should do a video on dust mites😂😂
Spore cell stage: RTX on
Jerry was the real hero here!!!
Love the descriptions of the dehydration process and tardigrade whoopee. Video left me cry-laughing. :D
Yay!!!!!! More from Ze! Thank you sir! Xo
Thought the thumbnail said moist piglet haha
Why are they so cute 🥺
I signed up with Curiosity Stream, thanks for the recommendation and coupon!
I love Jerry, I never see him but I love him.
And that's just how the Tardigrade do.
Heheheheh
I miss when zefrank use to do his show. Very inspiring.
What if we just are living in a galaxy that’s just tardigrade poop
Well, that's using your imagination, Jerry.
Because that's how Jerry do.
Jerry gets no respect.
Oh God. That whole last minute is pure _gold._ XDD
I learned more about tardigrades in this one zefrank video than in a  year of watching other nature content videos on YouTube. The footage was also exceptional. Thank you for the knowledge paired with humor, it is yummy food for my soul.
I LOVE TARDIGRADES
😂
To a photographer, everything is a style of photography!
Lol "think masterbation but with consequences" lol
ZeFrank, I think you need to replace Jerry.  (JUST KIDDING)
Sweet. Time to ride the Mycelial Network with this guy
Our whole universe is just a tiny poo-poo of a massive tardigrade, which is actually microscopic in its own reality, and we're all inside of an existential fractal, each tardigrade poo-poo being an individual universe.
And this is how the Water Bear Do. <3
Ze, it sure seems like Jerry messes up a bit. If you are ever looking for a replacement, or just somebody to work together with Jerry, to kinda... fact check, I guess, I would be honored. Our names together kinda sound good... reminiscent of something, just can't put my finger on it. I'll give you a good example of the invaluable input I could give your highly esteemed documentaries; "So after the Tardigrades have dehydrated and gone through the tun stage, when they come in contact with water again, they are now known as Retardigrades." Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Plot twist: Universe is actually a giant shit taken by a tardigrade.
Who else needs more Jerry in their life??
Too bad humans can't do that Cryptobiosis thing. If we could we might actually be able to leave  our little solar system and explore the universe.
It's 2021 and all videos should be a minimum 1080@60.
Kale-flavored Caprisun 😂
All The dislikes to this video were submitted by diatoms
I can't blame Jerry for wanting to try new things
Back was here
each of its eyes are only a single photon
Theres literally a song dedicated to these horrifically cute microbes. Tardigrades- Cosmo sheldrake
Why did you post me on YouTube
This is the best channel on YouTube never leave please I’ll die
"Science isn't a style of photography, Jerry." Both funny on its own AND sounds like a line out of Rick & Morty.
Haha, I always get a laugh from these.
This is the best channel on YouTube never leave please I’ll die
I love it’s little... paws? Their so cute!
Water bares are my favorite micro organism
Lmao my new favorite so far.
SLUUURRRP! LOLOL  David Attenborough, *show off*. LOLOL Damn I love these vids!
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE TARDIGRADES ARE AWESOME
*True facts about Jerry* ... DO IT!!!!!
Oh Jerry!!! 😂
My lord I already love zefrank and tardigrades but I learned so much and was thoroughly entertained by this video.
Don’t think we didn’t notice the honey badger reference
Can't wait to see how this one evolves. Maybe I'll check in about 50 years.
God is Amazing!!!!
"They don't teach you that in dragon school."  Hey, you're right... So, where's this dragon school?
This was mind blowing not gonna lie
tardigrades are one of my favorite animals and i am so glad you covered them !!!
My life would be both simpler and better if I had been born a chubby little tardigrade.
Mezmerizing
Don't Facetime Jerry at 3 am
That was  cool, ever consider covering "tape worms"?? ;🤔🤔Thank's Ze!!
True facts about Jerry next please
*TERD e grade
bacteria:  evolve hard outercases  tardigrade: sucky sucky
These have to be the ultimate lifeform
Olde Science : Life can't survive in space Tardigrade : Hold my diatom
best animal ever
[content engagement]
"it's like masturbation with consequences"  That's it, I've got a case of the very dead and it can't be cured.
Ccc.
ZEFRANK HAS RETURNED! May the harvest commence
The F tier trash.
I asked for this one a while ago! YAY! Thanks Ze!
I want Jerry to narrate one just for kicks. Maybe like the Reverse Anteater...
I don't see no muscle
I have been waiting YEARS for this.
Glad you have now a sponsor! :D
Are we just a galaxy poop?
" kissy mouth hole." I'm done!
yay
Did zefrank really just dump on me for not being able to dump crystals? ;( Also, tardigrade reproduction sounds like the woman saves up several periods in a body sized luna cup and then the guy uses it like a Real Doll. That's like.. next level perversion, what the hell guys.
I love the combo of real science and crude potty humor. Just my style. Excellent!
Pls do a oppih true facts
The “Jerry” joke was funny at first, but now it’s just old and ruins the jokes Oh my god look at their little feet
thumbs up
"Hetero tardigrades are not smooth they have horns" just like hetero people
Tardigrades are so cute! I've loved these little guys ever since I learned about them in college.
our galaxy is tardigrade poop confirmed.
I'm amazed how Jerry hasn't been fired
So these dudes are pretty much immortal?? 😂
The microscopic world looks so crowded, things squiggling all over the damn place you'd get no privacy!
I can't help the laughing out loud! I absolutely hold this channel in my top three! Sorry about the exclamation points. Not 😐
I imagine getting rehydrated would be like the absolute worst time your foot was waking up. But worse. And your whole body
Do you do the voice-over with the music playing in the background? And if not, is it awkward reading a script while 2 inches away from the microphone?
Hey, zefrank. Just want to say, always brilliant! I would watch you more than national geographic or BBC. Your stuff is actually factual, but with a twist of humor that I can't get enough of. I just love it, keep up the good work
Did one just glowed oooh so pretty I wish I was one I'm jealous of them grrrrr
Oh how I've missed you and Jerry! Thank you for brightening my day
You need to get back to the basics... you're being over creative and over thinking your videos lately... it's not working
i love your stuff so funny keep on keeping on mate your amazing
When the CCP virus spread like wildfire in late January 2020, the city of Wuhan was suddenly locked down without any warning. Everyone was anxious and worried. As it happened to be around the Chinese New Yearholiday, people could only make phone calls to extend their New Years greetings instead of visiting each other.   My Nephew's Wife My nephew's wife contracted the virus and was quarantined at home. My nephew was concerned and upset. I told him not to worry. I reminded him that reciting the auspicious phrases “Falun Dafa is good” and “Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good” will bring hope if he and his wife could say it sincerely.  I called him again the next day. He sounded much calmer and told me that his wife was improving.   Several days later, she was completely recovered.  My Cousin My aunt is in her 80s. She called me to say that her younger son had come down with the “Wuhan pneumonia” but that he refused to say the auspicious phrases mentioned above. My aunt and her son had heard me talk about Falun Dafa many times in the past and had already withdrawn from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its related organizations.  I told my aunt to calm down and then called my cousin. When I called him the first time, he did not pick up the phone, so I called his brother and asked him to pass on my words to him. My other cousin repeated the phrases loudly on the phone and said he would call his brother right away.  When I called my virus-stricken cousin the second time, he answered and told me that he did what his brother had relayed to him. He said he felt much better already. He continued saying the phrases, and days later, his fever was gone and he was back to his normal healthy self.  My Aunt and Uncle Shortly after my cousin recovered, his father also contracted the virus and got very sick. His condition worsened very quickly. Before I got a chance to talk to him, he had already passed away.  After my uncle’s passing, the village officials wanted to place my aunt in quarantine in a centralized location, but she refused. In the end, they agreed to let her self-quarantine at home.   My aunt has been saying the two phrases daily. She never had any symptoms. The village officials later got her tested at a hospital, and her result was negative. They were surprised that she didn't catch the virus when her son and late husband were both infected.
I would totally buy it Jerry :)
This voice is so soothing! Really enjoyed the presentation! Students would love this guy as a teacher.
Commenting for glory.
Tardigrade poop looks like a galaxy? What if that’s all we are? What if we are all living in tardigrade poop from a gigantic tardigrade?
Good job Jerry,  don't worry, I could buy your models
Oooh, and a sample of the boobie song at the end. Time well spent.
1 like = 1 love and respect for Jerry
"That's how a Tardigrade Do" Me: *Fangirl Noises*
Oh yeahhh like that thingy from family guy
I never expected him to call it a *moss piglet*
Have a comment
Jerry’s doing the most with the least and I’m here for it
"Think masturbation with consequences." Good God.
Me likey zefrank videos. That is how my brain do.
How long can they go dry without being "very dead" tho
I’m starting a Go-Fund-Me for Jerry to go to photography school
I’m surprised jerry hasn’t been fired yet
Great video.... Hugs from Esquimalt
I miss when he did the Morgan freeman voice for these but still hilarious either way
kinda bummed he didn't mention that there's now tardigrades on the moon permanently
#PoopGalaxies
could have done without the music at the end. I like everything else
Do true facts about the skunk,cougar,manned wolf, or wolverine
Truly the best! Whats the song playing at the end credits about the racy movie boobies?
MOSS PIGLET
I like the waterbead tardigrade. That’s really neat.
Remember when he said, I'm actually called a Tardigrade...but I'm *always* on time.. Hahahaha hilarious things..
what if we're all just on a multiverse tardigrade's giant crystal turd
You're awesome
We need a true facts about the sentipeed or the get that the fuck away from me rope
"It poops crystals. What can you do?"
Egg filled skin bag, you just described my ex, but I prefer to call her by her given name, The Sewerpipe. :)
"For most creatures the technical term for this would be 'getting very dead'".  Pure gold.
It's strange to watch a zefrank video without any Freudian lips.
I've been feening for a zefrank's video thx bro
Tardigrades get more and more interesting with new data. I'm sure that, if we had the choice, we'd all poop "galactic crystals".
Lol #15 Trending #TrueFacts #Tardigrades
Zefrank1 add read is the only one i'll watch. Because he goes "off script."
Woah why didnt anybody tell me that you started uploading again? Look at all this content I didnt see, time to binge Zefrank again for the first time in years
“It’s like your partner had a sunburn”  *skin fic flashbacks*
"I aint no farking waterbear" -Captain tardigrade
Awww he is back 🤗
Tardigrade turn into kinder surprise of cells
I feel like I'd be insulted if someone called me an incredible tardigrade...
insane to believe this man was the president of buzzfeed. starting to feel like jerry is the president now...
lol aka moss piglet? i think u mean aka water bear
Love these videos! I watch my favorites many times over, like fave movies.
I feel like they’re cute but also gross... Nature is incredible.
I can't get over the fact that their poop look like tiny galaxies
Lol I really needed this since I had to call off work because hell no I'm not risking life, limb and my car in this snow lol. Thank you for this wonderful cheer up 🙂
99% of animals when encountering a moderately threatening predator: "Crap, I'm in trouble..." Meanwhile: Immortal Jellyfish vs Time, Diabolical Ironclad Beetles vs being run over by a car, Camels vs. Sandstorms, high temperatures, and landscapes with almost no food, water, or solid ground, and Tardigrades vs. Radiation, sub-zero temperatures, and the f*cking vacuum of *SPACE:* "Boring! Let me know when a *worthy* opponent shows up..."
so if these water bears become human size hiding in a tank is useless............got it
5:34 "...and yes, you know where im going with this." No, zefrank, i never do and thats why i love this channel xD
Didn’t he already make a video about tardigrades?
"Masterbation with consequences",  Love it.
Yes! finally a video on the best animal on Earth
"For most creatures the technical term for this would be getting very dead"  dude was shriveled up like a sucked marshmallow how the hell
I like Jerry's hustle! His work is part of the great tradition that brought us Piltdown Man.
Holy shit, the images for this is incredible all things considered!!!
Quality: unrateable  Quantity: debatable
Wow,I love stuff like this but I just got a science overload
Isn't -270 c...just 3.15 degrees above absolute zero?

Love you, thank you so much!
Is this were Starbursts come from?
Tardigrades are my favorite animal on the planet.
Ok he ended with like earliest memory, mine is really funny, it was ( baby me) laying on my grandma’s bed and my aunt changing my diper, and as she takes the old one off i just let it rip and my aunt gets baby pee all over herself while im just laying there laughing, oh baby memories, then nothing! FOR YEARS 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Much like Morgan Freeman, Zefrank could say that he’s going to kill my family with a chainsaw, and his smooth, soothing voice would instantly calm me down.
The scale bar that just says “small” kills me. I want to use that
Have you done true facts on plankton? You should do true facts about plankton.
i dont appreciate you attempting to stifle jerrys artistic talent. you cant hide the truth from us after that recreation of an ostrich laying an egg
@ZeFrank has a remarkable, informative & downright hilarious mind - though in the Russell Crowe acting as a psychotic Nobel Prize winning Mathematician kind of way. That, is how the @ZeFrank do...  That he also poops crystals is just a party trick (in the really disturbing & kinky, vinyl-clothed German, kind of way).
I swear, zefrank is the only youtuber who can pull off 'hey, you like curiosity? how about an entire stream of it?'
Cant wait for humanity to die out so Tardigrades can reenter as the apex species
Now that I have learned that tardigrades poop crystals,  I am wondering what percentage of sand is made up of tardigrade poop.  Is clay actually mostly tardigrade poop?
Good thing these things are microscopic, they're harder to kill than a xenomorph.
Dear Zefrank. As your enthusiastic viewer, can I request a one simple thing? I want a caption. I'm not good at English enough to fully understand your video. So If you enable to turn on a caption, It will be much helpful. Thnx.
You can sell that as merch.
so basically they have sex with fake corpses
Hey! Leave Jerry alone... He's trying his best.
🍄Water bears boiiiiiiisssssss🍄, this is my new favorite episode because they are so fabulous! 🧿🕳🧿👍
The early screen shots made me think they were used for examples. Little did I know it was Jerry fooling around.
Finally he said something that has nothing to do with a penis
And the award for best video of this year so far goes to... Zefrank.  Raptuous applause.
And when the world needed him the most, he appeared.
Tardigrades. Poop. Crystal. Rainbows. SQUEEEEEEEEEEE!
Hey can we see true facts about the stock market?
My face hurts from laughing...  why does my face hurt from laughing???  :D
There was a nematode!
"Getting very dead", omg 😂
This man needs to be sponsored more So he can upload more
wouldn't it be fun our entire galaxy was just some giant tardigrade's poop
Dear god, I need to go find myself a pet tardigrade.
You are so funny!! I never wanted to learn about these little creatures until you. I appreciate your humor and teaching style.  It’s a lot of information learned with a grin. Lol
I missed ZFranks velvet voice. X3
Thank you, that was the hard laugh I needed!
moar tiny creatures please. i want to learn more about little transparent specks.
"Think masturbation, with consequences." Uh, I'd rather not!
5:00 I can poop crystals and it's not fun when they come out the wrong way, I can tell you.
True facts about the Geoduck, please?
Now I want to know what Jam's Germs thinks of this video.
Staples or no, I still want that
Time for Jerry to do a voice over & have Zfrank do the research.  Has Anyone ever heard Jerry say anything🤔 he needs to retourt Frank when Frank gets "bitchy BITCHY"  Frank you acted like a bebe, and that's what you DO!
incredible visual.  thanks for posting.
Nature's way of telling us that "SPORE" was a mistake.
The crystal pooping god uploaded
Made it through the video, then had to go watch the Puffin Muffin video, again.  Damn you, subliminal messaging!  Damn you! =)
He has returned. The inspiration of so much of early YouTube
I'm trying to find if Journey Through the microcosmos commented on this video Xd
Please ask David Attenborough for his endorse to be the next documentary guy!!!!!
4:18 THAT!... was hands down the most sadistic thing i may have heard this year, all though tiktoker's might try this as a challenge prank or something
"Some species are parthenogenic, which means that they can reproduce by themselves, solo. Think masturbation with consequences."  Zefrank1, you are just what we needed in this hour of need.
"Think masturbation with comsequences" jesus christ
Therapist: What was your earliest memory?  Tartograde: Well... It was a wet night. Like always. Okay, well actually, it was technically the first of many wet nights to come; seeing as how my first memory is from the day I was born. But we're getting sidetracked. So like I said...  It was a wet night... Like always... And I'm stuck inside this wierd, stretchy, almost flesh-like substance; on the low nutrient side of a moss patch. Think rotting tofu prison near the dumpster of a Trader Joe's, and you're pretty close.  So anyway...  I crawl out of this weird, fleshy-fleshy baby prison, only to discover that it is a lifeless skin sack, that once belonged to my mother. Oh, and to be clear, at that time-- I had no idea that it was my mother's skin sack that I had just crawled out of. And of course that's not my fault. I mean come on, I had just been born! Okay, tell you what, Mr. Brain Witch; how about I kill you, you know-- so you can get isekai-ed to one of those "parallel worlds" the hamburger apes keep going on about, and you tell me how you feel after crawling out of a skin sack resembling your mother!  Uh-Huh...  Yeah...  Okay...  Well alright, I guess a lightly veiled death threat was a little un-called for, but I feel that we're both missing the big picture here. All I'm saying is, if you're going to have children, and subsequently-- allow said children to crawl out of a hollow meat husk that looks like you-- leave a note!  I mean how hard could it be?  "Hey kids. It's mom. Don't worry about the lifeless shell of a tardigrade that I just left you to escape from. I'm fine. All that was was a discarded skin sack. Not to be confused with an actual living being. Unless you're your father, apparently. But I digress. Anyway... I am alive. So that's cool. And here's hoping that the same can be said of all of you."  I mean really. How hard was that? What...? Uh-huh... Yeah... Well alright, I guess  a note wouldn't really work underwater. And of course, I had just been born, so there was no way I was going to pull off the whole "reading" thing; but it's the thought that counts, right? What's that? That only applies to gifts? Oh well that's just great. Now I feel like a clam! A dumb, stupid, non thinky-thinky clam! I wish I could just bury my head in the sand right now. You know... how the Ostrich do.  Oh great...  Now I have the Ostrich song stuck in my head again. What? You never heard the Ostrich song? Oh come on, everyone's heard that song! No? You really haven't? Well, maybe it will help if I sing some of it for you Ah-hem!  "I'll stretch, I'll stretch, my neck out for ya!" "Cause I adore ya!" "Baby, on my knees, for ya!"  How was that? What? You don't give a duck? Oh, I see, you're talking about last year's #1 single. Yeah, that one's called, "Koala's in the Rain." Yes, I like that song too. No, I agree, it was totally revolutionary when it came out. It really re-defines music as an artistic medium, if I'm being honest. But you know, I think that newest song that just came out has the same kind of potential.  You know the one...  "Puffin Lovin?" Yeah... the writer for these songs has to be some kind of genius. Definitely no clams in his family tree.  What...?  Well of course I would love to hear an all animal music album! Who wouldn't? But thanks to Covid, we're all stuck inside. Speaking of being stuck inside, did you hear about Bob? That guy lost his mind.  Oh, I heard about it at one of those Zoom parties. And you know what, they still suck.  Yes, they still suck.  Look, at some point, you run out of things to say, and then you're all just staring at each other's faces! And then you have people like the Millers who won't hang up, or whatever it's called. In the end it's just painful. Like... really slow, millions of bloody dots, acupuncture painful.  Huh? Oh Kaylee's fine. Still giving her old man hell, but hey, that's what kids do. Or at least, that's what I'd do, if I could actually talk to my parents!  Sorry... Sorry... You're right...  Don't mask the pain, just, let it out. *Sigh* I'm sorry... I'm just... I'm having a day today. It feels like I'm living under a butthole, or like someone is continually throwing dirt in my face while I'm trying to get ahead in life. You ever have those days?  Yeah... I guess we all do...  Well. I'm sure it will all work out. And who knows, maybe one day I'll be able to look back on all of this, while I'm holding onto my lover under the light of a full moon, and laugh.  Huh? No, I mean laugh at the pain, not at my lover! What kind of cynical bastard laughs at love? I certainly wouldn't. And anyone who does deserves to take one in the noodle!  What's that? Okay, okay, I get it. "Violence doesn't solve anything." I get it. Jeez, with all of the reminders you're handing out, you'd think I'd graduated from dumb, poopy, butt bird school.  Huh...?  What do you mean I mispronounced it?  So it's "byurd," not "bird?" Well who decided that? Huh? Zefrank? I've never heard of him. Look, I'm not questioning his credentials, all I'm saying is I never heard of him.  Huh...? Really? He's worked with the "Et. all?" Well I guess that settles that. This Zefrank guy has to know what he's doing. He even has a partner, for crying out loud! Let's see here... "The multi-nippled Jerry." Why does Jerry's title mention his nipples?  Well sure I understand taking pride in one's appearance... but I don't think this is what the burger apes who made up that quote had in mind. If anything Jerry's title should read, "Jerry, devourer of the hamburger."  What's that...? Well I know it's not original, but it doesn't need to be. Come on, let's be real, all of those burger apes look alike.  How is that racist?  Oh really, this where you're gonna call time? Not when I was graphically describing my escape from what was essentially a corpse?  Oh, alright. I guess it's fine.  It gives me time to catch up on Sir Shrimperton's novel.   I knew that Clam was up to something!
Plot twist: *The universe is actually a poop*
Thankyou zefrank we love you videos keep up the great content
For those who don't know curiosity stream is also on vrv
Bless this man.
if you need another weird animal to talk about, check out the tenrec! it's like the bastard child of a shrew and a hedgehog. one species is bright yellow and black, I'm pretty sure it's actually a Pokemon
They shit galaxy, it's beautiful... What can you do?
Music link is bad :(
I wish my poop glowed......
What is the song at the very end? I can't find it anywhere
But if you were a tarigrade, would you move out from home?
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring back "A Show."  These true facts are getting too formulaic.
Star Trek Discovery has been mentioning the tardigrade for about 2 seasons now.  One of the writers must be as fascinated with them as ZeFrank and Jerry but ZeFrank explains it better.
Wowie
Those Batillipes tardigrades are the cutest thing ever
5:40 looks like a disco light at a party. they are party poopers.
Why this guy sounds like MADARA UCHIHA?
This was the most informative video I’ve seen on Tardigrades. And still hilarious
Tardigrades are just those anime characters who are secretly godlike
i love your content so much, your humor makes my worst days better
"Smeewth"
This is beautiful
They are also my favorite band
I come here for the comments.. and crystal poop
you know you're running out of animals to talk about when you go to the microscopic world
Aaahhh my ZeFrank fix.. Your voice is so cute n smooth..
Water bears look like a hippo and a vaccum cleaner had a baby.
I think Ze is the only one I'll sit through and listen to a paid ad, lol
We probably all live in a little galaxy of moss piglet poo.
I learn more things from this channel than my science class :^
What the hell I just learned about these today in my Astronomy class
'Getting very dead'
Dammit Jerry!
Dammit, Jerry! Do your job!
Galaxy poop. Not what I was expecting to come from 2021 yet I am unsurprised
Captain Tardigrade approves
That was surprisingly informative. Like, this channel is usually pretty informative, but I know a thing or five about tardigrades, and this was still surprisingly informative!
"Science isn't a style is photographic Jerry"
Masterbaition with consequences. 😂
I have been waiting for this video since I learned about this channel I am so happy right now! (Also, we love you Jerry)
such cute little indestructible water behbehs - was fascinated by them ever since I first heard they had come back to life from dried moss found in an Egyptian tomb lol
I broke my mouse clicking it so hard
God: Ok, that's space, and it's totally off limits.  Animals: but why? God: It's dangerous, you'll die. Any more questions?    Tardigrade: What's a die?
I remember learning about these from Octonauts
Cubone is not impressed by the tardigrade's birth.
Maybe. Just maybe. We all live in a tardigrade poo. A galaxy in every poo
I believe Star Trek Discovery used this little critter in a few episodes. Only it was bigger than a Buffalo and lived in space.
Love your videos. I so need that music with the blue boobies but I can’t find it anywhere. Can you fix e up? Point me to its availability?  Thanks so much.
1:09 Thank for your choice of words.
Have you tried playing the hokey pokey?
this was a really good one, like even gooder than normal.
How was this posted 7 hours ago??? This video is like 7 years old?
does post nut shame count as a consequence?
Thank you for making a video of my favorite micro-organism! I am 100% that nerd.
what if you were a mutant and your power was just to dehydrate like this guy.  every time you got thirsty you just shriveled up and you friends had to put you in the tub.  that would be a stupid mutant power.
#Smewth
*Cryptobiosis* You invested in that too? Hear the values rocketed over the last few days!
This video came out so late relative to the teaser you posted; I'm not impressed by your tardiness.
This might be my most favorite so far
Now imagine our galaxy is just a tardigrade crap from an alternate universe...
In the words of the great count Dooku. I've been looking forward to this
Jerry, you’re drunk, go home   Wait, you’re already home !
The King of YT meets the Emperor of microscopic life. A meeting made in heaven
Jerry is getting better at his work
I am sooooooo thrilled to see a new video by you when I wake up today. I'm going to enjoooooy it!
Electron Microscopes are quite a fantastic tool.
*Ah yes, the 'water bear'* I can see the canny resemblence of the 6 legs, 2 buttlegs, caterpillar shape and 0.5mm size
Yes... Tardigrades!
True fact, I freaking love your true facts! I laugh so hard my rear end falls off. Think bullfrog wearing a tiny pair of skinny jeans and inhumanely forced to walk upright. That is how I do. However, continue. Thank you.
I too, am also often referred to as a *Moss Piglet*
thank you, your videos always make me smile.
"Think masturbation but with consequences"  "Oh god.....the horror"
*Must eat tiny water gummy bears*
can we meet jerry just a video on jerry? XD
Cool!
love how he played the boobie song XD
Imagine if humans could dry out like that and come back to life, shit's terrifying
First time I’ve heard about hetero tardigrades, I guess I just assumed they were all homosexuals.
"Kissy mouth hole"? That's a face anus sir.
Wow. That is a beautiful poop.
He even makes his advertisements funny; "Oh, there's David Attenborough; show off."
check out the tardigrade song folks its relevant now
누가 이 채널 전담 한국어 번역 좀 해주세요 ㅠㅜ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
When do we get True Facts of Bobby Duke?
Me: finally, I've got that puffin mating song unstuck from my head 😌 Zefrank: Let me fix that for you😏
Oh God it's cute
Bread
As an artist, WOW, I've really been sleeping on the beauty of microbiology. I mean I was aware of tardigrades but i didn't realize their biology was so articulated. And the micro algae,gorgeous! your videos never fail to inspire, zefrank.
I love taridgrades! I have squishy one named teddy. Could you do one on my other wierd animal knick knack, the blob fish?
this was a loaded ep!! sugoi!
pooping crystals.... being part Tardigrade sounds great
Can we get a True Fact about David Attenborough?
Maybe our universe is just cosmic tardigrade poop
Gosh Jerry.
I was waiting for this one.
Fucking Jerry man
One ultimate chimera would be  Grizzly Bear, Lyre bird, and tardigrade.
Jerry's models are actually pretty good.
Next should be True Facts About Jerry
This is very educational thank you.
"Think masturbation with consequences" that line had me creasing!
I've never clicked "Like" on a video faster. This just made my day!
Yoooo I was researching tardigrade and this video not only helped it also very funny!
YES
I've been loving Hank Green's new channel Journey to the Microcosmos. And this feels like a beautiful and amazing direct satire of it! I love this channel too, but these two feel connected and i'm so here for it
1 vote here for Stupid merch.
AHHHHH asked for the tardigrade and from wits it came ~~!!!
Every comment is a quote
Wow! Usually not a fan of the sponsored content on Youtube, because it's usually one of the 20 VPN providers or Raid: shadow legends! Curiousity looks very nice, especially given the price. Good job securing this one, Frank!
Tardigrades: Just add water.
Wait, do I find these in my tap water?
I fucking love you dude
Day made! Moss Piglets indeed!
I would buy that merch tho^^
Probably the coolest thing is that tardigrades may be functionally immortal (as in, they can't die of old age) Living specimens were found in a dried moss that had been in a conservatory for the past 120 years when water was added again! They can still be eaten and die from infections and things like that, but it may be impossible to prove by human scientists that they have a (left undisturbed) natural lifespan when they can simply wait it out for centuries if conditions ever get unfavorable.
Mosspiglet... 😆
I want a collab between Jerry and Danny...
This was something I didn't even know I needed!! 😍
Smyewthe. Just the way the ZeFrank dew speak.
What if our universe and all the galaxies within it are just poop from a giant tardegrade?
Not as funny as usual but I guess it's cause of the sponsor...
I love watching this, its informative and hilarious, me and my ex use to watch your videos and while I miss her I absolutely love these videos
Am I the only one reading these comments in Zefrank1's voice?
This was actually true fact. Tardigrades are really incredible. All that microscopic life is amazing, both beautiful and ... incredible. So I object, this wasn't fun. It was informative. Except the pervert tardi part, that was a bit fun.
Holy shit he uploaded
Real question here...If I were to take some moss from some flagstones, would I be able to see these little buggers  under a scope?
It's like if your jack socks got pregnant
A true unicorn
This channel has done wonders for maintaining my sanity and sense of humour, and that's how the Ze Frank do.  Thanks for everything.
Amazing what's in nature that we can't see. What does kill them?  Zefrank,  good to hear from you again!
Fucking Jerry
So how do we kill them?
I love you! You kill me! Best part is when you say babies 👶!!! 😂😂👍🏻❤️
I happened to be eating breakfast as you started explaining the human version of the tardigrade circle of life.....I stopped eating.
The return of the king
Too lewd for me.
Great content man. Been a fan since sad cat diaries. Keep up the good work
I've been waiting for this video for 500 years...
This is awesome, I wanna get high and buy a microscope
I want to see the behind the scenes where "Jerry" makes these amazing scientific models
💥 owch. I mean like im not even a patreon. 💥  yet
FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO!!!!!
Thank you. I have been checking daily for an update. My soul is at rest now. Until the next long wait.
Great👍🏼, so we do eat and drink them. Dang it. My bottle of water looks different now🙃
I mean the scientists probably made babies too in celebration of finding out tardigrades could survive in space
There are two flavors of tardigrades. . . nacho cheese and cool ranch.
Stop i havent seen this account since i was eight hello i love you
I wanted to be uncomfortable but I couldn’t stop watching.
Smewwth.
Could be worse. They could be retardigrades.
Yeah...I got my tard-i-groove on!  Ze-ank you.
So vampires are macro versions of tardigrades?
Zefank you should see if you can get your videos on nebular
i want that tardigrade poop as my pc wallpaper ma friend : wow... is that galaxy? me : no, it's tardigrade poop
Had my science classes in school  been this interesting, I might have had a very different vocation!
Ze's back, rehydrating his tardigrade-like fan base with the precious water of YouTube content! We live again! 🥰
Time to get all streamy-streamy with my curiosity.
11:14 Stop playing Dicci Dicci in the sand. Oh my lord that’s funny bro 😎
"The technical term would be: Getting very dead" I lost it
Now I have to research and make sure I’m not drinking these things
These Animals Are Always In Your Food!
They're functionally immortal, poop little galaxies, and can survive in space. 💫What can you do? 💫
THEYRE SO CUTE
oh thank you so much for this!!!! as soon as i saw the notification i wondered what Jerry was going to do this time <3 you made my day!!!
The see-through version is much cuter than the 3D version.
O, to be a tardigrade, immune to god yet vulnerable to snails
I like how Jerry is actualy geting more character development
Yeah!!!! More about other microscopic animals
I'm only subscribing to curiosity tv if zefrank narrates a show!
Maybe the first video ever that made me focus on the ad as well...
3:08 I have a *_mighty need_* to adopt a glass full of these sweet little baby sun-gods-in-hiding 💫🙈
Jerry has some talent
Oh, Jerry. That goof
I’m sorry, you put your Gatorade in a glass to drink it? Not the very concur wing five gallon jug? That’s not terribly efficient Frank
What if we where living on a water bear poop , and the Big Bang was just a big poo 👁👄👁
the crystals they poop are Turdigrains
my favorite scicom does my favorite animal. e-pic
We need to adapt their abilities for our own use.
Once my friend was trying to say tartagre but couldn’t think of the word so she said “walking microscopic hazmat suit” 😂😂 I love her
"For comparison, here is a picture of a land bear. As you can see, the two are virtually indistinguishable."
my life is complete
Like, Commenting, and Subscribed. The YT algorithm is garbage so this apparently needed.
Finally, I’ve been waiting ever since you hinted at this
Hilarious man
this made my egg filled skin bag feel bad....
🤣😂❤
I'm glad we saw them poop. It proves they're not worms.
If I where a Tardigrade, I’d move out from home. Why live in the shrubbery when you can have a throne?  Pressure wouldn’t squash me and fire couldn’t burn. These are the things that I never will learn.
One reason I love this series is the incredibly fun commentary, but the other is getting so see high quality videos of a lot of animals that I have a hard time finding otherwise on the internet. Thank you and keep it up
Just when I thought that Puffin song was out of my head 😭
Always great  Used your code for curiositystream
Tardigrades are one of my fave animals, but I didn't know there were different kinds! The more you know🌈✨
Lmao I love the dynamic between Zefrank and Jerry. He always finds a way to screw up the editing XD
So I guess tardigrades are the true unicorns of our world since they poop glitter
Imagine you as a person dive or fall into a flowing stream of lava, only instead of instantly suffering 30 degree burns, you're just like "no no no, its ok...im gonna curl up in a ball and go to sleep" and somehow you end up being completely fine, then some 40 years later you get dug out of your rock cocoon, someone sprays you with water and you instantly come back to life, THAT is how the Tardigrade do
Of course the hetros’s look mean-
Of all the things a can poop, crystals aren't there
This video is very "corporate zefrank" like "we made this one for elementary schools"
You are best thing since sliced bread
wait they spaced living tardigrade in space?  i know star trek is real
Jerry maybe a side character but I know he's gonna be the star of this channel someday.  Like if you are on Team Jerry
Hooray for Ze👋
Words of support.
Just the hero we need. Love yourvideos
So, that's how we cryogenically freeze people to be woken up in the future.  Just have to figure out how to make their cells do that.  Vacuum sealed in a bag and frozen, you can just stack peoples on top of each other until rehydration day.
Wait, wait. Two kinds of tardigrades, u-tardigrades and hetero-tardigrades. Did Zefrank just call me gay?
Gay!!!!
whatever you upload is  makes me happy
I didn't know they were this cute. The way they're tap-tapping all over the place <3
Smyooth
🤣🤣👍
I would have loved working with Jerry back in school to make models in science projects. No joke. Haha
Why don't scientists try and find out how to make us hibernate?  I hope I live for the day I hear, " introducing, Dr. Rex Feelgood. He is officially the first person to successfully hibernate a human!"
"Masturbation with consequences" I'm dying 😂😂😂
These are always so, so good. Thanks for the video!
*_"Yooo Death, what up? It's me, Tardigrade! What are you gonna try and do to me today!?"_*
Whelp, guess I got CuriosityStream. The price seems really good, so let's see how it all works out. I'm curious if it's worth it...
In Germany we call them Bärtierchen meaning 'tiny bear animal' 🐻.
Finally , A Tardigrade Video .
I appreciate jerry's attempts at creating supporting visuals 😁😄
Welp, I've been going back and forth on curiosity stream, but if they sponsor you they're worthy of purchase
why do they get all the best upgrades?
"Think masterbation but with consequences." About killed me lmao.
Jerry's photography is brilliant
Imagine dying and being reincarnated into this?
sey yaS
"parthenogenesis: Masturbation, but with consequences" - I snorted xD
That's how the tardigrade do....
"Tardee grades" Every time I brought a report card home from school.
Tardigrades are crazy and awesome!!!!!
Finally
I'd love to see True Facts: Jerry
The Tardigrade is "A national acrobat.".. (Only hard core black sabbath fans will get that.)
I like Jerry
I think we need a tardigrade mating song, since I'm pretty sure there is footage of tardigrade sex on the YouTube channel "world of the Microcosmos"
It baffles me how some people can watch something like this and say, “Nah…I don’t bEliEvE in evolution. My gawd made everything in 6 days”. Lmfao!! Love your videos, zefrank!! Poor Jerry🤣😂 I got Curiosity Stream through you and LOVE it! #SCIENCE
XD
Oh my God I have been obsessed with tardigrades for years now! You have so much information here I didn’t know! Thanks for making it fun! Please keep making more videos!
Damn it Jerry you added the booby song to the end of the video!?
Nature is flipping amazing.
This is some great journey to the microverse content right here, I would be very curious to see ZeFrank do a collab with Hank Green
Think masturbation with consequences. Lmao.
Funfact: freezer burn is ice crystals breaking cell membranes and breaking the lysosome. The lysosome is full of acid and that creates the bad taste
Rosie O'Donnell,  you are not alone.
720p D:
Cosmo Sheldrake wrote a song about tardigrades. It's called Tardigrade Song. https://youtu.be/aCkSr0ugTIM  "If I shed all my liquid and let myself dry out I'll shrivel and sleep for some 15-odd years I'd wake up, come water, and get on with living With time in my pocket to pass by the day"  It's a real bop
Jerry is next level. He's making props now.
Do one on the honey badger
Microscopic organisms aren't see through. If you lay down on top of a blinding white light, you'd look pretty see through too.
We need "big ass eggs" merch
Tardigrade poop looks like galaxies...wait, I think we've just solved the mystery of the Big Bang!  May the Great Pan-Cosmic Tardigrade be praised!
He's back!!! The best nat geo wild documentary narrator 🙌
Yesshhh, another great masterpiece that your teaching us
Pooping beautiful crystals. That’s all I needed.
I must've confused them with Sea Pigs... the Moss Piglets I mean. But I didn't realize there was more than one Tardigrade.
You cheer up my life Zefrank. Your absolutely awesome :D
🖤💜💙💚💛
after a week or not pooping my pop was hard like a crystal. does that count? p.s. pooping crystals was not pleasurable.
Homer: -Mmmm, tardigrades!😛
True facts about the Cassowary please???
I wish they were the size of turtles
It isn't ZeFrank if he doesn't include one poop joke
1 like = 1 prayer for Jerry
Poor Jerry, don't be like this with him. He always tries to do his best
"Not smyooth"
Wait a minute, I just realized the channel name is "The Frank1" in German!
Zefrank, we love yuuuuuuuuuw
Think 'masturbation with consequences'.....
Keep up the good works folks!
Water bears are so cute.
love from bangladesh
Another cool fact he didn’t mention is that Tardigrades are born with the same number of cells they’ll have as an adult. Their cells just... get bigger(?)
Most of nature is rather horrifying when put into human terms.
Zefrank should be awarded an oscar or something... This guy is a living legend.
Brilliant, interesting and funny. If my teachers taught like you do (that bit was said in your voice!!) I would have learnt an awful lot more. Have a good one!
You, Sir, are a genius.
stepping up the game. Always exquisite. Thanks for this! Always looking forward to the next 😍
To be a fan of Zefrank, one must be like a Tardigrade.....able to wait long periods with nothing and able to spring back to life when something comes.  I've waited SO long for this episode....both for the tardigrades and Ze Frank!
H2o baby pig
They freakin poop crystals!
OOOH I’m here early!!!
Been waiting for this episode.. finally
I love water bears. There so cute.
Jerry is my favorite
knowledge
"Masterbation, but with consequences"   - zefrank
I want to play Spore again
so that young gal on OnlyFans with the heart shaped cristal in her butt? she's a tardigrade???
The first commercial I did not skip! Good job
Friendship ended with Journey to the Microcosmos.   Zefrank is my new best friend.  (JK, J2tMC is great, but this is hilarious)
Jerry be messin up big time on this one.
Wow the new Spore game looks amazing!
Damn it Jerry! Hehe, Classic Jerry.
A half remembered quote from Slaughterhouse Five comes to mind when you mention "masturbation with consequences": American newly arrived in a WW2 prison camp tells British long timer to go f#ck himself. The Brit replies "don't think I haven't tried. mate". That is how British POWs do.
Look, I appreciate Jerry's effort, but I sometimes feel like he is not being managed correctly.  :)
Always let out a pleasantly surprised "Oh!" When I see a new upload from you in my feed.
Wait this is not Journey to the Microcosmos???😹
bruh
What I like about the water bears is that. I think we all shallowed some without knowing when you accidentally swallow water while swimming in a river or outdoor pool
Tardigrades can poop crystal? Well I'm sorry I'm just a shitty 3D Printer.
Funny as always wish I had a man like you
2:32 that "J" nearly killed me with laughter 😂
Hitting that like button before even letting the video finish buffering  Are you guys going to do more microbes? Just gonna say virus are a hot topic right now
Nothing is better then watching Zefrank while eating.
"Science isn't a style of photography Jerry" LET JERRY SCIENCE ALL HE WANTS!
When u compared it to pov pornography you earned my love
This is just what I needed for my bad mood. Love him. Sooo funny! 🤣
God you will always be one of my favorite content creators.
Zefrank1 for teacher of the year 👍
I was poop shamed by zefrank, and I liked it.
Jerry's art is on-point 👌
I wish that there's a Pokemon named Retardigrade
This is a great one!
Galaxies are tardiegrade crap
wait so humans are like 60 percent water so to tarigrades live in us please tell me yes
Can we get a True Facts: Jerry?
yay, i love this series
5:34 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBEXo2hfnns   I guess this means that Roger is a tardigrade.   I also means that Roger is canon-compliant with _Star Trek: Discovery._
I put on my tardigrade t shirt specially to watch this. Thank you
Zefrank should collab with micro cosmos for a episodes
Great video. I am amazed
"Science is not a style of photography, Jerry!" ...I burst out laughing and scared my cat when he said that. 🤣
“Think masturbation with consequences” Thanks
if there's one thing that can gey me to subscribe to curiosity stream after all these years of seeing it from my favorite creators, it's a zefrank video about tardegrades that I asked for just like a month ago. I love you zefrank, You are amazing, I hope my subscription helped you out in any way because your videos are amazing. I shared them with my proffesor/mentor and we started watching them in zoology class because we love them so much. <3 stay awesome.
Tardigrade merch please!!!
Thank you for the new video! Made my night so much better!
So, no to water now? idk lol
I love tardigrades. They’re so cute!!
When you consider there is no Gerry it's just zefrank!
Hnnng, how did you manage to make me find them cute by the end???? They're little flesh bugs, that's, the opposite of cute, and yet they're just jwjdjejf cute!?
"oh, there is David Attenborough. Show-off..."
Fun facts:  Each of those eyes are single cells! Tardigrades are not invincible. They die really easily under normal circumstances, they're just resistant to a few specific things like drying out and radiation
I sooo love your videos, they're educational AND hilarious! LOL Thank you very much and please keep em comin! 😊❤
Anyone here learned about water bears for the first time from the animal planet show, "the most extreme."?
If humans did parthenogenesis, I’d think the rate of masturbation would drop by 80%.
Look... galaxy sh*t! Now a message from our sponsor. roflmao... your humour and wit knows no bounds @zefrank1. Love it. :)
The views are bound to go up on this, buy up apes DIAMOND HANDS 💎💎💎🙌🙌 $ZFRK
My favorite song at the end!!!!  I love your videos, watch them over and over again!!  This one brings a whole new concept as to why, exactly, you lose weight drinking only water... little dudes eating you up from the insides out... and, I guess from the outside in!! 🤔
man you’re crazy and i love everything about it 😂😂😂😂😂 do noooot stop your humor and creativity ever for whatever reason it may be
Finally a new video🙌🙌
Smeoouve
So happy to see this 💖
For those joking about how they never hear from zfrank except randomly, follow him on patreon, he posts a lot there to update what he's doing!
Goddammit, I've been waiting for you to do tardigrade since forever. I'm saving this for later.
I like how they poop Christmas decorations
these are one of my favorite doggos
What kind of a psychopath drinks Gatorade from a glass?
I am ashame that I have forgotten which video that the 11:26 song come from. I need help guys
This week has been absolute shit, and it's only Thursday. Zefrank helps turn my shitty week into sparkly crystal poos.  Thank you dear.
This is the peek of my humor fluid filled sacks     I love it
Thanks again Ze Frank for making a wonderful video as always.  The Tardigrade has been a favourite little critter of mine for ages now, thank you for finally covering them :3  Also thank you Jerry for the awesome Tardigrade models xD
Thank you for uploading !
Any else down for a “True Facts” x “Journey to the Microcosmos” collab vid??
For fans of Journey to Microcosmos: It is a quite contrast - "Our microscoper James" vs. "Jerry did you make space out of tardigrade poop"  But tardigrades always win :)
Love your videos
Tier zoo would like to know your location
I'm not sure this is actually by Ze Frank.  I have listened to it a couple of times but there is absolutely no mention of a penis or cloaca.  That is NOT how Ze Frank do! I suspect that Jerry has gone rogue.  Jerry?  What have you done with Ze?  Jerry!  Where is Ze?!?  JERRY!!!!
Why is their poop gold?  They're not the secret to alchemy, are they?
We need a ZeFrank-branded Tardigrade plush.
Keep doing it ze you are in a great path
this man just yung Morgan Freeman
Oh, Jerry.  Bonus points for using staples as the tardigrade claws though.
I remember learning about these on Animal Planet and thinking how cute they were haha I love this video!
I so needed a zefrank fix.  Thank you!
don't mess with the moss piglet has to be one of most adorable sounding threats
They’re so cuuuuuuute
"Listen, it's kind of like..."  Immediate fear from that sentence.
It's just like spore game
That protein they make to protect their DNA could scientist make a mrna to copy that protein for us to use like the covid vaccine
I was introduced to tardigrades in middle school science class. Still remember my first glimpse of one through the microscope.
Jerry played with shitty footage and made it beautiful.
Youtube cash grab 101: Make the same videos everyone else has made with your own twist.  No hate, I honestly respect the hustle...
All my brain keeps saying is "Spore."
makes me wonder what they'll evolve into or stay the same after a gazillion years
Since you have dove into the microcosmos, may I suggest Stentor Coeruleus or other species of Stentor for another video?
What is this outro music
Yay
*hits blunt* "like, what if the stars are tardigrade poop and god's just a giant cosmic water bear?"
White Morgan Freeman back at it again, yes.
Another masterpiece of knowledge, name calling, and humor. Thank you my friend
"Do you like Curiosity" HAHAHAHAHA so random
Like and comment for the algorithm
Finally the Video is here❤️❤️
True Facts: (about) Jerry would break the YouTube
I can not stress enough how much I love this series. Also Curiosity Stream sounds dope af.
Don’t suppose you’d make a vid on spider mites.
I allways when a new video drops
I want to play Spore again.
Wonderful as always
🇨🇦✌️
In this video I learned actual, real facts about the Tardigrade.  And I resent it!
This made my day
YESSSSS
Call me Tardigrade?! no U-Tardigrade.
I hate thinking about how many little animals live in me
Yes
It's like if you have a sunburn... Me: oh no I don't like where this is going
I have not slept and I thought the thumbnail was a grey bear
OH MY GOODNESS HE UPLOADED HE UPLOADEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDD
What is your first memory?
True facts about Raccoons please
Return of the King
It’s official. The universe was created by a extremely massive tardigrade’s sparkly shit
Excellent!
Jerry needs a set of Lego for christmas
Hahahah love this Channel Ty for the endless laughter
WE NEED MOAR
"Science isn't a style of photography, Jerry"  Now that's a true fact.
10:55 Was getting scared for a minute there...
Zefrank we missed you like a dried Tardigrade misses the rain. Wait Jerry was that a spit? Well whatever will do as long as it works
So glad to have you back!
The episode I've been waiting for.
Oh Jerry don't ever change haha
I fuckin love ur content, I just wish u had ur Morgan freeman voive, that shit is asmr
Finally something microscopic that isn't horrifying
where's the zefrank category curiosity stream ;)
zeHell Yeah... our boi is back!
Crystal Teddy Bears! Water Bears are the best!  THANK YOU ZEFRANK! YOU'RE AWESOME!
Now I want all food to come in that packaging
You and Jerry need help! LOL!
It's always a good day with a zefranke upload!! Thank you for your endless void of knowledge and humor, I love it!!
aw shit it finally came
Spore never lied! It was all TRUE!
I love how educational all these videos are. But they do keeps things interesting.
I love you papa Frank
Zefrank, you're my hero.
Ah yes, tardigrades are slimes that excrete plorts when they eat.
I love tardigrades and I love your videos. Thank u for this, ur the best 😂
I want tardigrade MERCH!
At a mushroom nerd party I asked my mad scientist friend to find some (by squeezing wet moss) and put them under the microscope. It looked like a dancing croissant. I am glad to find out they poop crystals.
I dont think you understand how happy we are that your back to your channel
Tartigrade when hit by a nuclear explosion: 😴
that’s right, they shit in the water you’re sipping on rn
Thx for the video.
Did several projects about these little guys, I even keep a colony like people keep ant farms
Plot twist - Jerry doesn’t exist :)
Can you poop crystals? hahaha!
yes
This is an amazing video and footage. Very very good, Sir.
Bold of you to assume I wouldn't pay top dollar for tardigrade merch full of staples.
Poor Jerry, all he's trying to do is expand his artistic repertoire by creating those delightfully weird looking models.  "No we can't sell that as merch Jerry" ... aw darn, I would have happily paid for Jerry's delectable work of art, who else is with me?
I like Jerry
VERY NICE.
My favorite microscopic organism!!
CBSAllAccess will steal this tardigrade video and claim they thought of this first.
Seeing a new upload from you always makes me happy =D
The best
This is the only animal show I watch these days <3
Science isn't a style of photography Jerry!
I love them
But when they don't die and the females lay eggs, isn't there a overpopulation?
when are you gonna fire jerry?
Man you crack me up every time man! love your work zefrank! I wish you live a thousand years and make a million videos like these :D Honest fan of your work bro. Keep doin what you do. Lots of  Love!! Robin
This is both absolutely fascinating and immensely horrifying
“They’re essentially a fluid filled sack”  No u.
JERRY!
Does anybody knows the classical music?
This is a strange Journey To The Microcosmos video.
I always laugh and learn with this channel, if those are your goals, you accomplish them incredibly well.
You're the best.
I want tardigrade merch
I especially liked the one made with those disgusting gooey ball things.
Tardigrades made the universes after eating, that's my new philosphy
water bears are overpowered tbh
Jerry is trying his best but just not getting it. lol
Thank you for stopping with the explanation.... :D Oh and a round of applause for the Jerry's ingenuity :D.
"Think masturbation but with consequences" I'm dead
1:29 ist smoll
Genius. Absolute Genius.
We need: True Facts: Humans True Facts: Zefrank True Facts: Jerry
Israel launched a spacecraft to the moon with a bunch of these little homies on it. The spacecraft crashed, and now our little buddies are stranded and still alive. We need to send someone to save them!
It's a Water Bear, not a Moss Piglet ;_;
Zefrank 🥇 is better than Discovery Channel 💩 CHANGE MY MIND
OMG that music at the end... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Poor Jerry is just trying to do his job
It was a mistake to watch this while I was taking a bath.
Forgive me if this has already been answered....but I need to know how in God’s green earth you find these creatures to teach us about? I love it!
Thank you, Frank. This episode is fantastic. I like it very much. ❤️ Can you make a video about slime mold in the future, please?
I havE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!!!!
Hey Zefrank. I just wanted to say hi. And if you said hi back that’d really make my day.
masturbation with consequences got me laughing so hard bruh
extraordinary content once again, good game as the kids say.
Jerry's tardigrade art as merch? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
brew had one of these on their youtube channel
“A very technical term called ‘getting very dead’” 😂
Zefrank has some nerve thanking people for keeping him sane. We all know he has never been sane.... Thank the powers for that!😊🐝❤
*"Kale flavored Capri-Sun"* 🦠🥬🧃 😜👍
Tardigrades are the best animal.  Change my mind.
"Masturbation with consequences"..... So not hairy palms then? 😂😂😂
OHmg my fave video TO DATE!!!  x)
I have been waiting for you to do facts about these monsters
they are not smeuuuutthh, however and have spikes and plates.  smeuuuuuuutthhh......perfect, lol
No mention of how they are also an integral part of the Spore Drive?
I'm not sure if you're interested, but I thought I should let you know if you keep doing this so well, you're gonna have to travel the whole world looking for cool animals as the new David Attenborough when you're 80 like he is.
For more very small creature knowledge I highly recommend Journey to the Microcosmos
0:01   In the first age in first battle when the shadows lengthened one stood burned by the embers of Armageddon his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension he chose the path of perpetual torment in his ravenous hatred he found no peace and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him and he wore the crown of the water bears, and those tasted the bite of his sword named him the..... doom bear
YOUR BACK YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE US AGAIN DADDY ZEFRANK1❤💛💙💚💜
accept gerys artistic talent damn it!
‘ stop playing dicky dicky in the sand’.  Ouch!
XD
I, for one, welcome our Tardigrade overlords.
Whenever I watch these, I can’t stop repeating what he says and adding Jerry to the end of the sentence! 😅
next ep is gonna be about wombats and how they poop minecraft cubes
You always manage to put a smile on my brain regardless of how my day is going. Thanks for that.
Nevies....  If you know... you know
Loved it!
"kale flavored capri-sun" i couldn't make it any farther than that! i had to take a laugh break! lol
So many delightful new words, I just can't!
stop playing dicky dicky in the sand
Love how zefrank has a grudge against David Attenborough
Tardigrade Inferno, a Dark-Metal-Caberet band out of St. Peteresburg, is worth a listen. Their cover of "We are number one!" is a hoot..."Execution is fun", "Hypnotherapy for beginners", "Mastermind"...fun stuff.
Tardigrades laughs at the concept of death
Dehydrated tardiegrade
I really want a video narrated by Jerry 😭
Our entire universe exist within a tardigrade crystalline poop.
Dragon swimming in the ocean:  Comes up from the ocean horned covered in human pollution. Dragon flying in the air: Lands covered in soot from coal factories with plastic speared on their horns.
*cuteness overload 1:36
So happy with this one love the comedy and fascinated by tardigrades
So are those in our drinking water ? Are we drinking bears ?
Intriguing... but highly disturbing
Plump lil Water Bears!!!!
Star Trek Discovery celebrity right here 🖖
Zefrank is the best!
Ooooh it was inevitable. I've been waiting for this one!
Booyah, Tardigrades!
I love this guys videos
Lol I live for these hilarious commentaries and Jerry’s shenaniganary(how to spell?)
deep down though aren't we all just fluid filled sacks?
Finally, True Facts about wildlife and deranged screaming returns!
I love Jerry how ever useless you are
Thank you Ze
I just love this line "the technical term for this would be "getting very dead".' I will make use of this!
Watching this while eating was a bad idea... laughter and food don’t mix well
See you all in a few months to next year for the next video
This April fools you should do true facts about a mythical creature. I feel like that would be fun.
Small
Your stuff brings me great joy and this was no exception! <3 Thank you for all you do!
Man, that is the prettiest poop I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of...it.
Illusive and mysterious maybe,  but always providing excellent content !
I hope you are a fan of star trek, bc the newest version on Netflix taught us about tartigrades gone rogue! This was as creative and informative as all your videos!! Keep making them and I will keep watching them!
😲
Itsy bitsy teddy bears!🐻
This is my 10th ZeFrank video in a row since getting it on my recommended.   I showed the channel to my girlfriend and she pointed out that this was the fuckin Honey Badger guy.
My antidote has arrived, im going to watch this infinite times
nothing will ever be as amusing to me as the fact that most of the world unanimously decided that Tardigrades are just cute little bear things and just decided to adore them all.
9:48 He said "babies". My day is ruined.
been impatiently waiting for this since the teaser, weeks ago😁😁😁
He started on the sunburn part and every part of my body recoiled immediately
Tardigrades are sooooo cute
Wonderful, thank you zefrank1!
I think that we can all agree that there is never a good time to say "kale-flavored Capri Sun." If the wrong person should hear that it might come to be.
Why shouldn't you put water bears onto asphalt? Because the tar degrades.
Loved tardigrades ever since I saw a picture of one. Couple years ago (2018) Family Guy had a talking one.
I found my spirit arthropod and one day I hope to achieve the ability to poop crystals. 🤣
The king is backkk babbbyy
If I could poop crystals I'd give em to my little siblings and tell them that it's rock candy-
Actually, a skin-sack filled with eggs doesn't sound like a bad way to reproduce. The eggs don't have to be fertilized internally, so she doesn't have to mess with the male (nor he with her). The eggs also aren't completely left to the elements, because they have their mother's skin-armor protecting them.   Although I don't like them, the way bed bugs reproduce horrifies me. Did I say I don't like them? They are hell-spawn, and I loathe them with the burning hot plasma of a thousand suns. Their way of getting jiggy with it still horrifies me, though...
Let me just say, I adore these explorations into nature. They never fail to crack me up, and honestly I think it’s quite useful to expose the ridiculousness of nature at the same time as celebrating the overwhelming wonder. It gives a more centered perspective on the world we live in and our place in it.
yeah, they don't teach a lot of things in dragon school
If ZeFrank says "reTardigrade" i will lose my shit
Finally!! new bebes.
I’m just so thankful for this channel
Wow, using their molt is super resourceful
OMG So Cute and I actually learned something about tardigrades I didn't already know!!!!!!!!!
Anyone still trying to do the whole gene manipulation thing? Cause long distance space travel would be easier with half slime tardi folk.
"Incredible Tardigrades"...  think Tierzoo would disagree    Great vid though, as always!
I'm terribly sick. alone, hurting and not getting better. Please, I needed this. Thank you 🥺❤️
Am i the only one that thought that they showed me a mutant bear with 9 claws?
David Attenborough is a treasure and I will die on that hill.
for how long have I waited, its fanally here, and it did not disapoint
Little galaxy poops🤣
are the water bears in the water we drink tho? Are they in my glass that I filled with purified water that I bough from the store ?
“Think masturbation with consequences” 😂😂😂😂
Parthenogenesis = Masturbation with consequences. I so very wish that there was a reason to use this in my real world on the regular. Unfortunately, most of the people in my world would just look at me like I'm speaking Latin.
Those are the cutest little toes I have ever seen.
Tgis may be the perfect animal for zefrank to discuss
"Heat resistance? A little unorthodox, but ok. Ice resistance? Why would you want both? Radiation resistance?? Ok, how often do you think that's going to come in handy? ... Supernova resistance?! Gamma Ray burst resistance?! Meteor Impact resistance?!?" This broke TierZoo
the single cell things: has a harden shell to protect its self the bear: that's cute
WHY ARE THEY SO CUTE!!!
YES YES YES
That was trully didactic! Better than my Biocell teacher :D Amazing job!
Love your videos always brightens my day when a new one arrives
Jerry is awesome
You really need to retrain that Jerry.
This is weirdly satisfying, like looking at those little eye squiggles that you usually can never focus on cuz they chill in ur peripherals. Does anyone know what I’m saying or should I be committed?
Waiting for the day I wake up to a notification of a video called "True facts about the Jerry"
I am so into this video my boo just called and I said "I'll be right... bear" 🤦‍♂️
Hey, i know what these things are thanks to the channel, Brew!
This critter was special made for True Facts 👍
Tardigrades are some of the most badass creatures on the planet. I kinda want a shirt with a tardigrade on it and some witty catchphrase
So on top of everything they poop galaxies.
Damn it jerry i told you i wanted photos of spider man not photos of a spider in a mat.
Imagine if the Milky Way is just one Tardigrade's poop crystal.. as if we're all just microscopic organisms to some much, MUCH larger beings.
Bear o water
Imagine being an animal that shits space
I swear to God, you and your channel need to get its own tv show on Netflix or Hulu or something. I wish I watch new episodes every day lol
The radioactive resistance is also present in the parasitic wasp species Habrobracon hebetor, if you're looking for another video idea ;)
"It is how a tardigrade do"
#kriegrock LOL
An 11 minute video YESSSS
Alas, one may not simply post a black and white picture of their genitals and add a scale that says "big" to impress the ladies 😫
This is beautiful o(´^｀)o
@zefrank1 Love your stuff so much! It's good to hear you laugh too hehe
If I were a tardigrade I'd move out from home. Why live in the shrubbery when you could have a throne? Pressure wouldn't squash me and fire couldn't burn. These are the things that I never will learn.
Those little legs are amazing
It's ok zefrank1, you're our David Attenborough.
i want evolution to make it bigger so i can pet it
There are also 35 collections of— Oh, there’s David Attenborough. Show-off.
Imagine if that's how the world was created, a bunch of water bears pooped
Weirdly, this made me very very happy.
Tardigrade sex -> The PornHub search where you zero results and a WTF?
WOW! I actually learned way more than I thought I would.
Don't mess with the Moss Piglet. Put that on a T-shirt! :D
Someone tell me why I was literally listening to the adventure zone Podcast episode where they fight these and this came up on my notifications… I was really spooked😂😳
MB with consequences... that's the moment you got me. Nicely done
“Some can survive temperatures lower than -270 degrees Celsius.”  That’s incredible! That’s 3 kelvin away from absolute zero (all atomic movement stops)
Thank you! Been missing you!
Me and my friend had an on going joke a few years ago that the tartigrade is the answer to everything
PHUCK YEAH!
Always happy to see a new video from Sir Ze & Jerry.
Love you Frankyyyyy thanks for another video
Totally unrelated but... See the green thing that the tardigrade pushes? I can see something similar floating over my vision when looking at something bright. I swear I've first noticed it when I was a child and now in my teens that single "cell" has "grown" longer over the years. WTF is this.
When I die, I'm going to ask God two things:  (1): What inspired Him to create Tardigrade, which may or may not have inspired us to make gummi bears and Pokemon? and (2): Who the Hell would want a kale-flavored Caprisun?!
Can we have "True Facts: Jerry" one day?
If you are reading this: Have a great day 😊
Today I can say: I've seen something poop crystals. My day is done.
Mooooorre videos please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jerry is the true MvP.
Not enough sex jokes >:(
Zefrank is the only channel I actually watch the sponsors on, makes them content lol
😂 pretty interesting
10:00  :D :D :D
My week is made, thank you tardigrades and zefrank
Now it’s gonna be a good day when I see zefrank in my feed.
Tardigrades are awesome!!!
LMAO! Thanks ZEFRANK!!!
That was way more informative than expected. Thank you!
Tardigrades will probably outlive us
Its just too amazing that something so little looks so much like the animals of the big scale.
omg amazing <3
It's weird to watch this while hydrating yourself.
“Do you like a stream of it? A curiosity shower?”  😂😂😂
This man got me thinking there is an actual person named Jerry that works with him.
Hey Frank, I just learned raccoons wet their hands to get more info from objects they touch How about a raccoon episode?
A thousand likes in one hour?? Amazing
Mulholland!!
Jerry needs to ask for a raise.  Immediately.
Aren't water bears F tier
1000th comment
I cant wait for these to drop!!!! The humor is amazing!!! Love it, never change!!!
Yes he's BACKKKKKK!!!!
"Just think masterbation but with consequences" this had me dieing
Moss piglets and gecko- like sea piglets.
You could watch this video upside down and there would be almost no difference
Awsome video. Hope to see one with a reptile like Iguana or bearded dragon.
lil' squoosh bois
I peed crystals once. Not my greatest moment.
One hour into posting and there's 85K views and 12k likes. Your a freakin boss! Btw I LOVEEEEEEE JERRY!!!!!
Small
Amazing and funny.
When I scrolled by. I thought the thumbnail was a grizzly bear. Touché, tardigrade nicknamers
They're cute is a squiggly sort of way. Edit: "Masturbation with consequences" I almost choked on my drink laughing.
I'm glad Youtubers have a wholesome sponsor to sell their soul to when YT fucks content creators over. Thank you Curiosity Stream. XD
peripatus next plz
True Facts about the Centaur, please.
15-16 vids a year
What if our universe is one massive tardigrade turd.
Never did I though hearing masturbation with condequences
Finally
Jerry needs a stern talking to any put on a performance plan
Awesome
smol
"Think masturbation with consequences." 😂😂😂
Are there any other WondLa fans here?
Please upload more often
Jerry... the best worst help editing ever.
"And that's the problem with having horns and spikes and things, all kinds of crap gets stuck on them. Don't teach you that at dragon school"
So, when I get a drink of water, tardigrades go for a fun slide down to the waste treatment plant.
I have a proposition: Talk about the absolute dragons known as turtles
Here's a True Fact for you, despite being almost invulnerable to most things, lukewarm water is lethal to them.
Welcome to the Microcosmos, eat your translucent heart out.
"Think masturbation with consequences." I don't want to think about that.
Recommending my new favorite documentarian to all my friends! (I'll mention this channel too)
Pooping crystals seems very uncomfortable and I'm glad that I don't.
You gave real religous people a new way to scary kids from masterbating. Lol thank god that's really not consequence
Dammit Jerry
Smjoooth
"What was your earliest memory?"   Pass.    "They are less good at navigating the glass slides used in microscopy".  LOL  Man, you must have done a long shirt ton of research for this one.  Scarily enough, I learned a LOT about Tardigrades, and have always found them interesting and cute.   Cockroaches have NOTHING on these guys for survival, and furthermore, they are definitely NOT cute.  NO Jerry, don't do one on cockroaches...seriously...DON'T.  I don't CARE if you want to use your small scale and 'scientific' photography again...it won't work...at least half the population will run away screaming.  10/10 on this one, they are always hilarious, but this one is gold.  I was absolutely AMAZED how many different variations (or possibly even species?) of tardigrades exist, and some have 12 toe nails.
It's been so long since he updated, i thought I stumbled upon a really old video until I checked the comments xD
2:34 Jerry will make it a style of photography.
A zefrank and tierzoo collab could be great
2:35 😆😂🤣 Thanks for the science and the laugh! 👍
Yes love your videos learning while laughing
He came back from his cocoon made of beans.
Aaaaannnnnd now the Boobies song is stuck in my head again.  (*sigh*)
What I learned from this episode is that you are all beautiful. Even the tardigrade's poop. But...    Not everyone can see it... 🙃
JERRYYYY!!!
"Masturbation with consequences" Never change.
Ah. I bet diatoms are minty
I find ist very interesting how the Tardigrades move around, it seems like they were (bigger) animals and they can decide where they want to go or what to do. But they are so incredible small, they even do not have a heart or lung, I also read in Wikipedia that some muscles are just 1 (!) cell.  Thanks, didn’t know about these animals!
One thing is for certain.   Tardigrades have cute little hands.
Jerry is a very gifted craftsperson
The water bear is my favorite creature on earth (or off it, for that matter).  I like them so much I think their ugly little "faces" are cute!
What is the song at the end??
The babeh tarts grade (my iPhone is stupid) craw out of their moms...that their dad... ROFLMAO. My sides hurt.
What if... our galaxy is just a tardigrade poop?
You sir, are a legend.
Get it together Jerry! Lol. Finally more try facts videos. More please 😁🤙✌️
Looking at my room, I realized that I’m an unTardigrade🤪
I Love You zefrank1  Nowhere else in life is it so fun to learn subject matter that normally couldn’t hold the attention of a tardigrade turd.
Imagine zefrank  explaining true facts about snom....
Hahahahahaha
This is amazing, it’s educational and funny
If I were a Tardigrade, I'd move far from home Why live in a shrubbery, when you can have a throne? Pressure couldn't squash me, and fire couldn't burn These are the things that I never would learn
How on earth does Jerry still have a job? 🤣
early.
Who will win: - A water bear evolved by living millions of years in harsh, moist conditions - My Bunsen burner when I'm boiling river water for my coffee
Tardigrades: when teachers are late in reporting their students' performance.
Is sex with a woman from Australia a 69  by default? Just curious.
Significant other* Why is everyone becoming so damn pretentious and using that stupid as fuck term "partner"? It's so damn stupid.
Today I learned tardigrades poop crystal galaxies.
*BEST.* *ANIMAL.* *EVER.*
I find Jerry's jokes offensive.
Theory: zefrank is an anglicized version of ancient language name, and zefrank is actually an omnipotent god-like watcher, who was sent to instruct the human species on the different animals on earth  Edit: and he swears and is kinda sassy so people are interested in what he is saying
Thank you thank you I've had a bad week  my disability claim was denied again thats 6 years 2 lawyers down the drain.  Your a Angel. May God bless you 🙏 ❤.
They so cute🤗
"There's David Attenborough.....show off" lololololol
Am I the only one that could've sworn he already made a tardigrade but in reality he never did until this one?
Happy as I always am to see a new zefrank video, I kinda miss his intro from older videos where he used to say "here we will explore true facts about the X"
Ze, I thought you should know:  It's been a tough week, and your content always helps with tough weeks. Sometimes it's the soothing wisdom of A Show, sometimes the nonsensical energy of The Show or the hilariously true facts in True Facts, you make stuff that helps people.  You're a good dude, Ze. The internet is lucky you exist.
I feel like this time good ol' Jerry got some extra attention, and I think it was well deserved! P.S. don't listen to them Jerry, those pictures were very scientific
I’ve been eating for this, for so long, I love you
LOVE THIS
I almost instinctually skipped thru the sponsorship but I stopped myself cuz I remembered that everything is cool when zefrank is narrating it
Kale flavoured Capri Sun? Don't give the world ideas please....
1:19 I don't know I think Jerry did a good job plus it did sort of fool me when he turned it black and white.
And when they needed him the most, He appeared
Beautiful.  Also the shirt link returns error 404
The scale bar saying small was amazing
When you get your microbiology assignment back late from the teacher, that's tardigrade.
Is it a dot or is it a speck...
A few months ago I found your videos and have watched them repeatedly on and off since I'm so glad you're still active your videos really picked me up at a bad time you're a star.
This is the best thing ever
"Science isn't a style of photography" lmaoooooo
Now*
No go watch the puffin mating video
I told you there were perverts 🤣
You have no idea how much I love your vids. Tiger king hell no I live 30 miles from where his park was (never been). Thank you I just can't even tell you how manyvtimes I just started back at the beginning need this the past year. 😆🤣🤩😁
Chicken eggs in a tardigrade shell
Science isn't a style of photography.  I learnt a new thing today.
Hi Zefrank. I was wondering if you could do a video on uromastyx lizards? Theres a lot of really cool things about them but if the content is lacking i completely understand. Thank you for all of these entertaining yet informative videos i love them.
No matter the animal, I will learn how it reproduces by zefrank. XD
So glad to see another video by my favorite voice on youtube.
😂 This is great!
I remember when Catie Wayne made a video... Anyway, great models Jerry!
5:43 What if God was a tardigrade and all of our galaxies is its poop?
oh I know this will be a visual nightmare for me
Anyone else see this episode of true facts pop up while they were on the pot?
Thanks to you... I am a grown ass man that instinctually says "behbehs" by default and gets all sorts of looks for it.
Only Zefrank can make the subject of tardigrades funny.
What's the song at 11:25?
What if every time a tardigrade poops, a new galaxy is formed and we were both spectators and inhabitants of these galaxies? Basically, what if the Tardigrade was God? Now that's a trippy thought.
I'm so excited that i don't know what to say here! 😂😆
"Think masturbation with consequences." TFF! Made my week.
Do a true facts about Poto Bird, they're freaky looking and hilarious looking at the same time.
Although curiosity stream sponsors alot of channels I watch, they sponsored this gem so you get credit.
I kinda want a caprisun now
they kinda cute tho
Humans won't be the first inhabitants of extra terrestrial planets - the indestructible tardigrade will be.
The water beear
the footage was absolutely awesome
"Masturbation with consequences" I don't think I could live with that lol
Our galaxy is just one massive shiny tardigrade poop. My life is a lie.
I needed this so much today. Thanku zefrank for you impeccable timing.
What is the song at the very end of the video?
5:35 and that right there kids is the big bang! That's how the universe as you know it started off.  I'll shit in a cup if you tell me otherwise
*happy noises*
Water bears are the only microscopic animals that are visually similar enough to a bug that I am not afraid of because tbh, they are pretty cute.
Imagine someone big narrating our lives like zefrank narrating these little creatures
Well now I think these lil guys are adorable
The wait felt like forever but you did not disappoint
Wait this is 1hour ago?cool      2am here btw
Welp, if youre doing the middle of the video ad thing then Im not interested in your channel anymore. That shit takes me out of the video immediately and I go looking for something else. Put it in the rear of your videos, its not funny. If one out of a million are actually interested theyll watch but for the rest of us its annoying.
Jerry is always doing such good work.
Jerry I give you credit for turning it black and white you swayed me that's all I'm saying
That annoying pop sound in 3:45...
Don't watch this while eating. This'll ruin a nice lunch
Aren’t these the little guys who just crash landed on the moon and could cause an issue?
This guy got a sponsor?! You're lucky man! Thank god you can keep up this great and funny videos!
You need to do more videos man
I need this in my life today. Thank you zefrank1!
Another YouTuber just fell down the sponsor-drain. This is a sad day 😢
What if our entire Galaxy...Was just the shiny turd of a galactic tardigrade...WooOooOooAh!
Jerry had me fooled for sure...
I’d buy the staple tartigrade😂
*I guess 2021 will be our year*
My favorite animal. I got a stereo microscope during quarantine last year and spent hours just watching these little guys swim around.
My favorite was the dead one.
When I started watching Zefrank, I wasn't sure if Jerry needed to be given a raise or demoted.   All these years later and the answer is still unclear.
Hello. I’m new to your channel. Who’s Jerry? 👀
...... So how small are Spill, Brew, Grill, and Chill? Since... Brew's tardigrade is huge lol  Edit: Was... did... did Jerry make a tardigrade with a glove and gummy bears? If so... I'll happily take that off your hands 👀 lol
Everyone carries on about their favorite sci-fi monsters, all you need to do to witness true alien terror is watch tardigrades mate.
We definitely need merch that says "Parthenogenesis: v. - masturbation with consequences"
=D
Thank you Zefrank and the scientists for your hard work and giving us another fun and educational video.
*talks about beautiful poop* And now a message about our sponsor 😂
Idk why but I'd love Jerry less if you could actually hear what he's saying,  know what I mean Vern?
The universe was pooped out by a giant tardigrade. All hail lord poopshaw
Thank you sir.  You make science fun, have more humour and so much more interesting to learn.  Wish all the science teachers have more good sense of humour like you sir.  😂😂😂😂😂
Thank you for giving one of my favorite animals the spotlight ;)
It's always fun to listen to Morgan Freeman
Perverts!
Best vid to date 😆👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Tardigrade sounds like a unit for measuring stupidity.  Ex. "Swallowing mouthwash to make your farts smell minty fresh?  That's 24 degrees tardigrade."
Friggin’ sweet images, I love it.
What's the song at the end during the credits?
How does jerry still have a job?... Frank is a great boss :)
I'm about to blow everyone's mind: zefrank1 IS Jerry
Science isn’t a style of photography Jerry 😂
when i saw the image of a cell i got some vietnam flashbacks to high school "The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell !"
I'm speechless..
And here I thought masturbation always had consequences.
That's how the tardigrade do
I swear this animal was just made to be a True Facts animal
I just looked up this animal a few days ago... Now you make a video about it. Not sure how I should feel about this.
Yay
Every school needs a teacher like ZeFrank 🤗
La ciurma del messer Barbascura X é giunta anche qui
Poor thing had poo on it's foot
Posted: an hour ago. Views: 55,517. This makes me happy
Tardigrades probably watching this right now, in their home TV. Chilling after 9-5 job
Just perfect
Morgan freeman Jr. is back
Zefrank: Looks like a little galaxy Me: *my tired brain starts to think* What if our galaxy was pooped out by a giant tardigrade. *Remembers I'm Christian* Woops.
Okay, but can we get actual moss piglet squishy/plushie/beanbag merch? I want one... @_@
Hate when I get very dead.
I love how “Getting Very Dead” is now a technical term. Thank you, zefrank1
zefrank1 learned all about Legos... except for the fact that they aren't called Legos...
I was wholly tired of the whole tardigrade business here on YT, but zfrank actually taught me many new things here. Noice!
This is my second favorite animal. the first is the Isopod.
Omg My day is blessed with superior knowledge
"When exposed to the vacuum of space, the tardigrades get frisky"
I missed that :D
Leave Jerry alone he’s doing his best!! 😂😂😂 awesome as well ZeFrank!
Getting very dead, im gonna say that for now on
bean
Welp, I won't be drinking water again without boiling it first, thanks! 🥴😅
Thats the only channel where i watch sponsor time lol
Now I understand why Zefrank sticks with Jerry. He may not be the smartest employee, but his passion and creativity are admirable. After all, good help is difficult to find these days.
David Attenborough, the showoff. And for nothing. His brother ALMOST got away from the Nazis and then grew dinosaurs. He the real showoff.
God is just a tartigrade that pooped a lot in the same spot
He's back! And with the Tardigrade! It must be my birthday!
The return of the king
You don’t need be so hard to Jerry, he really put effort on those impressive art projects.
I always kind of feel bad for Jerry
They poop crystals and they can go to space without any preparation or consequences... and, I just looked it up, they can live "up to 2 years, not counting their time in dormant states", so if they wake up once every 10 years they can live for 5300 years, that's some strong crystal-pooping bear
Some talented kids Jerry's got there.
This came together so well!
*YUES*
Jerry is really losing his passion recently... Everything ok at home?
Immediately clicked on this. My Astronomy professor was obsessed with these little critters.
"Science isn't a style of photography, Jerry."  <--- Oh this is going to get some use.
"Science isn't a style of photography, Jerry" Hahahahaha!
Ah, an exquisite video to show my nonexistent friends. What a lovely find.
I love it when Zefrank comes out of his long Odinsleep to bless us with his presence :D
Imagine an alien race abducted you, thrusted you into the vacuum of space for laughs, then returned you to Earth with a glass of water, and you couldn’t be better. That’s how the Tardigrade do.
they poop rainbow colors .. they are tiny no horned unicorns LOL
Only the truest facts for my boi
China dropped and left some on the moon.
How does Jerry still have a job??
"...David Attenbourough, show off."
POG A NEW ONE!
Science isn’t a style of photography!
Love it! But now I need theraphy!
"Looks like a little galaxy" wait are we living on poop?
And then sometimes they grow giant size and help a starship teleport across the galaxy by eating intergalactic magic mushrooms...  ...no wait, that sounds like the idiotic plot of a really bad science fiction show.
Jerry gone wild on these snap shots. Lol
Hey! You're back!
Gods I love 💘 these. I have watch all of them and they have always made smile and laugh. LOVE 💘 the side talk to Jerry,  those are the funniest things. PLEASE do more. 🙏🧚‍♂️
✋ *Wait ......* *Their poop .* 💩  *looks like a galaxy .*  😲 *What if all galaxies are actually a massive Tardigrade poop .*
This show went from 2 minutes of jokes based on a couple of facts to full on nerd stuff with a couple of jokes in there.
More true facts, i love these so muchhh
I AM SO HAPPY YOU TALKED ABOUT TARDIGRADES. Sorry. I love these things.
Jerry can you quit your funniness !?!😂😭
the clay model looks like if satans anus fell out and grew legs
Most tardigrade videos: Tardigrades are awesome because they are totally invincible and can survive anything TierZoo's tardigrade video: Tardigrades aren't actually invincible and therefore they suck zefrank's tardigrade video: Tardigrades are really cool even when they are not hibernating and being thrown into space
*I've been waiting for this moment for all my life.*
Humor and education should always go hand in hand. Makes learning fun! 😁
That's the prettiest shit I've ever seen
When are you going to do a True Facts: Humans?
"Cute, tiny fellows"? I think that introductory clip made them appear to me as "WATER TERMITES"! I'm not going to fall for your fake news! You and the They are pushing these water termites on us just like they did with flouride!
I'd buy that merch, staples and all.
God dammit jerry stop
They poop galaxy?
“Jerry he’s walking on the ceiling again. Well tell him to get down!”
Homygod, slime rancher is alien tardigrade
Kissy mouth hole..! Lol!
“Masturbation with consequences”  Dude, not while I’m eating, Jesus Christ. 😂😂😂
This video made all of our days better because that’s how zefrank and Jerry do
Please do one on birds of paradise! You'd have so much fun with their kooky looks and strange mating behavior.
683rd!
Tardigrades are my favorite microscopic beings, also you should do one on axolotls
They look so squishy, I wanna poke it
Sure glad you didn't do a show-n-tell about skin bags with humans, lol
I liked it before i even watche it
I love it how some of the best quality scientific footage of these organisms is only available in this troll format and microbiologists have to watch it.
That's amazing!   😅🥰
If you learned about Lego, you would know that that Lego is an adjective.  Never ever ever say Legos, Its like putting the toilet paper roll facing the wall.  Rant over.
10:28 really tiny prohibited cum sock
Calls David Attenborough a show-off.
"True facts about the Berd"
Truly disgusting how some "people" would do this horrible thing.
HELLO?! You're the best man- never stop!! 😍😜👍
Damn these little fellas are cute
Your videos always inspire me to do better when making mine, the more obscure random animal facts available for the public the better!
I am surprised and delighted that Jerry hasn't been fired yet.
I'm going to be completely honest here... if you made tardigrade shaped candies filled with jelly beans or something for valentines day I would absolutely buy them.
They are kind of cute....kind of
FUCKING JERRY!
Fantastic creatures, I'll decorate my ceiling with their poop!
If I was a tardigrade I'd move out from home Why live in the shrubbery when you can have a throne Pressure wouldn't squash me and fire wouldn't burn These are the things that I never will learn
Best YouTube channel, hands down. Not down there Jerry!
"Think masturbation but with consequences".  I don't wanna live in that world. 😕
Just what I needed for today.
Only if my science teachers were half funny and interesting, I would be a biologist by now
Idea: Wobbegong
Glad to have you back, doing what you dew!
I normally come to your videos for the comedy, but I sat a fascination to this one, learning more about Moss Piglets than I ever knew before. Thank you for that.
Meiofauna is the best fauna. Thank you for this video.
9:42 I’m dead XD.
Aren't they used to travel through the universe?
Ok I have the dust idea. Hear me out....  Zefrank and Bill Wurtz collab.
I like how “getting very dead” is a technical term for an animal losing 97% of its water
Jerry....
That Attenborough shade. 😆
We need a True Facts: Jerry at this point.
always a good day when another of these comes out
so Jerry the fuck up took on photography and poop crafting... jesus. get him laid for pete's sake
What if the universe wa created by alot of these things
this made my entire body itch like fucking CRAZY
"There's David attenborough. Show off." 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So thats why slither.io has the worms poop glowing crystals
MAKE MERCH THAT SAYS STOP PLAYING DICKY DICKY IN THE SAND!!!!!!!!!!! The world needs you
E
Teacher: Why are you laughing?  Me: *Retardigrades*
I absolutely love all your videos
always a good time!
Awesome
My god. I'm so early on one of these videos, I feel so lucky
Stay golden, Ponyboy.
Ok
Where is the link for the shirts?
And when we needed him most, he appeared before us. I actually saw tardigrades up close in a museum of microscopic life. It was such a fascinating museum
Absolutely one of my favorite creatures! Love it
You made my morning and it was already good
I mean, I'd buy that as merch
woaaaaah how did u breed so many (they prop had some good times)
Its appas fetus
Ze you should treat Jerry better, he really tries.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
This video was great keep up the great work 👍🏻
@hank green can journey to the microcosmos have zefrank guest host a few times because this is glorious
Most definitely the best biologists on YouTube and Jerry always fools me with his version of the specimens  - you’re a spoiler Zefrank 🤣
This reminds me of a Southpark episode :))
Just Great and way better than David Attenborough
"Just think about Masturbation but with consequences" - Zefrank      Well!! that's a sobering thought isn't it?
Love waking up to see a new Zefrank video(especially True Facts).  That sunburn bit.🤔 That is how the Zefrank do Analogy. 👍
you brilliant man you :)
This channel is one of the most informative and interesting science shows ever. Thank you so much. ❤️👏🏼👍🏻😍😘😷
Fucking Jerry, STAPLES Jerry STAPLES!
It was all fun and games until he brought up Tardigrade reproduction
Aaaaaaaa new episode! I wish I could observe these instead of dead
To the 4 people who disliked this. I hate you.
The visual of tardigrades drying out is genuinely horrifying
Oh yeah, My favorite creature is here!
your jerry is best
Do Uranus.
It is how they DOooooOooooOoo 🤣
When the world needs him most he appears
Laughed a lot at the "small" scale, love the whole video, amazing animal
Thank you for the new video, Zefrank. I loved it.
Great content thanks for another fun and informative narration.
I love you videos bro keep up the good work
Truest Fact I Learned from ZeFrank in this Video:  David Attenborough and Rotifers are showoffs.
KYUT LITTLE BEBEHS
I really appreciate all the original footage and research that goes into making your videos.
Now I understand why the internet is obsessed with these little critters!
These lil' guys are exactly why it's impossible to be truly vegetarian or vegan. They are infact, classified as animals. Found everywhere and almost in everything(especially plant matter); and are easily digested by humans and other animals.
I finally found the use of these sponsored messages. It helped me notice that I have been watching this video upside down
"It's kind of like if ..."  Noooo, don't go there!
These hardcore little bastards. ;P
YESSSSS!!! Now it’s gonna be a good day - thanks Frank!!!
At 5:43 what im hearing is our universe came out of a tartagrade?
Didn't the Israelis accidentally release tonnes on the moon whom are all still just floating around up there?
Please show us Jerry someday
Brilliant!!
It's a wonderful day when zefrank downloads a new video!  Doubly blessed, as tardigrades are my favorite microscopic creatures!
Love the Black and White Filter!💙
And now I know how our universe was made.... moss piglet poop
"sort of like pov pornography"
Weeeee more Zefrank
zefrank: says anything Scientists: WRITE THAT DOWN, WRITE THAT DOWN
I like’em long!...the videos Jerry, the videos. Perv.
I want one as a pet
Dang this got uploaded in my birthday. What a great present
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
such a cute, lovely video. thanks!!.... 💕😊
"Hand picked by experts, not some random people off the street..." True, but it's those random people on the street that are making the content.
The hero that we dont need but the one that we deserve
Jerry is as elusive as Dr. Et al
Just reminds me of Ant-Man Where's Paul Rudd
Fuckin Jerry lol
I feel kinda bad for these creatures because they are transparent and the thing that is most visible is their poop. Now imagine if humans were like that.
You need to get with the folks from lucid chart. that would be epic.
Absolutely loved that you dived into the details of cryptobiosis, thank you!
Hahaha I couldn't stop laughing.  The sunburn part got me.
Jerry is my favorite character
Like a Dorito individually packaged in glass   Yum
Aren't we all getting very dead..? *sigh*
to all the people that thought unicorns pooped sparkly rainbows , HA !
Amazing as ever. Seeing "True Facts" in the new video alerts automatically makes the day a grade better. Thank you, Zefrank!
Its just like the game Spore but only the first part of the game
Every time I read the word tardigrade, I think of the tardigrade song by Cosmo sheldrake.
This is creepy as hell itself.
If my marine biology teacher taught like this, I’d never skip a day of school
Zefrank has taught me more than any biology class ever has
When we were doing a biology lab, I asked my college professor whether the pond has polar bear instead of tardigrade or water bear. Took him so long to figured out what i meant. I felt so stupid
YES YOU CAN SELL TARTIGRADE MERCH, STAPLES OR NOT
These just keep getting better and better!
I don't know what's worse:  Fapping but with consequences or being born from the lifeless husk of your mother and a father who may or not  be into necrophilia
My new favorite quote “science isn’t a style of photography, jerry”
wait, science is not a photography style?!
9:22  we've all woken up having to do the same...
David Attenborough needs to do a collab with this guy. I'd pay good money for that 🤣
wow i never knew about tiny animals like these, they were kinda cute but kinda gross at the same time
Hell yeah! My first new upload since I found and subscribed!
"Some can survive temperatures below -200 degrees celsius!" ... -273°C is Absolute Zero(0k)... *Why does an organism that eats moss and lives in pretty average environments have the ability to live through NEAR ABSOLUTE ZERO*
Holy shit can we keep Jerry in lock down forever? That shit was golden.
Not gonna lie they kinda cute
I really love your vids brohh, love it💜
You are awesome, so glad you have us another titillating video. Here to hoping you find the time to download more often. Thanks
i love the galaxy poop <3
If everybody was as good at maintaining a job position as Jerry is, there would be no unemployment.
Awesome stuff as usual! "Think masturbation with consequences.".... As if going blind isn't bad enough. Maybe that's why they have such tiny eyes.
See through creatures, that was a lot of looking at poop.
When David Attenborough finally retires, ZeFrank1 should be immediately introduced as his replacement for all nature documentaries, except he is allowed to script it as well.. None of the BS he had to deal with while working for Buzzfeed.
If I were a tardigrade I'd move out from home, why live in the shrubbery when you can have a throne?
I learned about Tardigrades via The Most X-Treme on Animal Planet. on the first day I was medicated for ADD. That doesn't sound important but I'd accidentally took my sister's meds (also ADD) then asked my other sister and she just told me to take mine as well. So The Most X-Treme was on in the other room while I was insuring those dishes were Clean.
Your videos are my favorite by far
Stopped everything when I saw this come through. Work can wait. TARDIGRADE!
Ay lmao
I’d buy that merch if the link worked
Sell it as merch, Jerry! Do it!
Jerry is getting more creative. We should encourage him, unlike David.
I think the candy-bag “tardigrade” is one of the cutest things I’ve seen in a bit.  Aside from perhaps tardigrades’ little lizard fingers and toes.
"Okay so basically I'm very smol..."
Omg these theory about macro and micro being connected... Our Via Láctea has been popped by a giant water boar!
Imagine changing the ilumination of your bathroom in order to create galaxies with your butthole.
Noice
Hilarious and informative as always! You rock Zefrank!
Masturbation with consequences...lol
I really like this lol!
I want to laugh but I just giggle. Because I don't want to miss anything.
15 years and I am still entertained by Ze.  Forever a sports racer, racing sports!
oh so that's how you pronounce "chitin".
OH MY GOD we exist in tardigrade poop don't we?
Aah yes. The forbidden gummy bear.
Zefrank curiosity stream needs to hook you up with a full length documentary series, society would benefit greatly
Zefrank is like a tardigrade, he cocoons himself and his YouTube account into a near death state for months or years at a time, and then suddenly, when conditions are ripe, he reemerges with fresh comedy and knowledge as if nothing had ever happened.
I'm pretty sure someone sold me tardigrade poop at a rave once
Personally I don't like ads in the middle of videos. Just my personal opinion. I do like how you inject humor in to your ads, just kind of rubs me the wrong way when an ad interrupts the video. And as always, I greatly enjoyed the video and curiositystream actually seems like something I'd enjoy.
Oh boy that was a real funny video
Think masterbation with consequences. Freakin' brilliant!  ...also, I'm not sure if that's even how you spell masterbation.  I don't want that on my search history.
“Science isn’t a style of photography, Jerry”
This is the highlight of my day, I love water bears. AND you're the one narrating? Hell yeah
Welcome back! Youmayneverleaveagain. And also, hummingbirds still wins the internet.
10:55 HE SAID THE LINE !
True facts about the huuuuman
For I am a tardigrade, And I'll stay at home. With my whiskey in the cabinet, And my feet all clothed in socks.
My standards are so low🙃 that I actually think they're ADORABLE 😍 and hope someone makes them it into a see through🥺 jelly squishy!!!  I'd gleefully throw money at them for one....two...... three hell who cares it'd be cute AF!!! Dear Critter birthers of the Tubes of You.... MAKE ONE 🙏 of each PLEASE, because I know I can't be the only one who thinks they're adorable...
i identify as a retardigrade
somebody better make a superhero movie based on this marvelous creature
Ze, here's a list of animals you should do. Tarantulas, jumping spiders, bumblebees, prairie chickens, dogs, paper wasps, woodcock.
I love this film channel best channel on YouTube
Don’t ever change mate, love your work 🥰😉
I thought zefrank made a video about Star Trek for a minute there...
So, tardigrades encase themselves in carbonite when the water runs out.
Yet another awesome episode!!!😂😂
If you narrate for curiosity stream I would buy a hundred years
Thanks for the new content frank! Also, Jerry leveled up in this video. Esp with the space poop art. He should get a raise
cute yet disgusting     *I like it*
Aaaah, it's always a good day when ZeFrank posts a video. Thank you, you've turned a driech snowy day in lockdown into a spring morning in a field of wildflowers... and moss, moss with tardigrades pooping & doing things with skin sacks!
2:56 The way he pronounced Microscope tho
Damn my comment is so late, sorry for the tardiness.
Boxing crab pls
Masturbation with consequences would fully populate the earth in just minutes.
Parthenogenesis, “masterbation with consequences”. Brilliant, just brilliant!
The Return of the King
So cool
Love me my *tardigrades!*
I needed this during $GME's dark hours.
At 10:38, he says "egg-filled skin bag."  👀
please never die
"This isn't some "pass me the lip balm I'm feeling a bit chapped" sort of dry"  He doesn't miss
Thank you for the entertainment good sir.
“Masturbation with consequences...” Hahaha!! So much to unpack on our soft moss couch 🧡 Thank you for your hard work. I love you 😍😍😍😍
Your content is just best. Makes my day every time. This was classic. My favorite is still the one on giraffes. 😂🤣 all your videos are epic. David Attenborough has nothing on you he's just glowy glowy tardigrade poop
Always an ultra quick clik for Ze!!💖✌🖖
Been waiting to see "How the Tardigrade Do" for too long!!!! Jerry! Wth? You spent all this time making silly fake Tardigrades instead of working on our video! What can I expect, that is How the Jerry Do.
Hella good!!! Thank you!
"Looks like a little galaxy." Mmmmm Are we all living in a giant tardigrade turd? Edit: spelling error
that puffin jam is life. im going there right now
Floppy floppy like cooked spaghetti - Zefrank
They’re like those dogs that don’t know how to go down stairs properly
Jerry's commitment to scientific excellence is inspirational
Great video, but I think you confused parthenogenesis with selfing. I mean it's already pervy enough with their "normal" mating...
This was probably the best 11 minutes of my week. And for the record, Jerry, I would buy that as merch.
i died at 10:11 "bIGaSs EGs"
This is exactly what I didnt know I needed. A hole in my soul has been filled. Thanks moss piglets.
Jerry god dammit
I am fulfilled! I have seen a zefrank video and now I may nap well!!
Lol Jerry is the MVP of this video
What is that outtro tune?
Wasn't expecting intrinsically disordered proteins and ice nucleating proteins to be mentioned A+ 👌👌👌
OMG HE FINALLY DID ONE OF MY FAVORITE ANIMALS
Oooooh man I needed this 🙌. I was having such a stressful week. I swear you have perfect timing.
I would buy that merch
3minuts in an theres no mention of penises. i am disapoint. >;(
Jerry on fucking point today
Woohoo
Sci-Fi continues to become more Sci-Fa
Parthenogenesis..think masturbation with consequences 🤣
No such thing as vegetarian either.
These videos are seriously the best part of my day. Can't wait for the next one!
Thank you for curing my depression again.
Psychiatrist: What was your earliest memory? Tardigrade:  Crawling out of mom's lifeless skin sack. I don't want to talk about it.
No such thing as vegan then.
I love moss piglets :)
I 💕 love 💞 Jerry.
How is Jerry still employed?
The bears of water , forbidden micro gummie
Truly disgusting that some “people” would do this horrible thing.
Idk I think I'm with Jerry on this, his models were quite convincing.
What a great day
Our entire galaxy is just tardigrade poop
Yayy my day just got better
I would like to see him do true facts on mourning doves.
I like this jerry guy, very imaginative also very very dum at the same time
I love that shade you threw at David Attenborough.
You did it. Its happening .
I forgot how adorable these little guys were
I would buy that merch. staples and all! you did great, jerry!
These videos are just amazing
Tiny shiny water Bear poops magic
“Think of masturbation with consequences.” That’s horrifying
My god.
Likewise Maestro <3 be safely
Yep. You did it again, you genius you.  Thank you.
Oh we missed you daddy Frank 😍
What if our galaxy is just a giant tardigrade poop? 🌌 💩
Thank you!
Jerry gets a reward for his amazing sculptures
"Think masturbation with consequences..."
THE RETURN OF THE BOOBIE SONG
Thank you so very much for doing another of these! I love them!
The problem with these animals is that they can never tell you how many exam questions you got right in a timely manner
This is the best thing that’s ever happened to me
Tardigrades be wildin
DO ONE ABOUT THE HOUSE FLY! Ples
Well done, Zefrank. Well done. I truly appreciate your intellect, grace, curiosity and humor.
Ah not hibernating,but cryptobiosis
Only today from this video did i find out what curiosity stream was even about
Lol at Attenborough.
Yes!!!!!!!!
Very interesting. Thanks!
I'm currently watching Sir David Attenborough, and i paused that show, watch Ze instead. That's how important this guy in my life
This guy should do a True Facts about ZeFrank video.
Literally the most strongest species on this planet.
Thoroughly enjoyed this!!!
Reducing the colour palette and complexity of the background, really makes Spore look more impressive
It's beautiful. Every second of it
Huzzah, he's back! That's how the zefrank do.
Yessssss!!!! Finally!!!!
Smyooth
I am NEVER early.  But today, I have been blessed for showing up just on the same day ALONE as this upload.  Thank you for these adorable water bears, Mr. Zefrank!
I may not be able to poop crystals but I have peed one out😂
jerry face reveal?
Finally. It's felt like AGES....
0 dislikes!
Whether it’s Parks and Rec, Rick and Morty, or True Facts: Jerry can’t seem to do anything right 😅
"Small"
imagine pooping crystals
"They freaking poop crystals! What can you do? Not that! ..Looks like a galaxy!"🤣
The one guy that can make learning about Tardigrades hilarious
Tardigrades are literally walking heads.
He finally made one about these guys, yay
The most awaited true facts episode
What the hell Jerry!!!! Sheesh!!!!
Epic
YES let's go baby THIS is what I'm talking about! This is what i've been waiting for!
I know it is going to be a good day when the first thing I see is a new true facts vid.
Hysterical!
Sick!!!!!! Love yiur stuff!!!
Thank you so much Ze! I love your videos!
I'm convinced half the words Zefrank says are actually made up.
Zefrank is the only person where I don’t skip the sponsorship ads
the smooth ones are beautiful chubby babies
Really thought he already did this one
"Now for most creatures the technical term for this would be getting very dead" LMFAO.
Jerry Couldnt afford Royalty free tardigrade footage, so he had to get        Creative
I'm glad
Do a True Facts: Humans
My friend has drawn an anime girl version of tardigrade, she has become a full on star in my friend group
Tardigrade don’t give a crap.
Tardigrades poop galaxies into existence 5:44. I think I know what God is now.
When I see zefrank, I click
Only zefrank1 can make something as boring and monotonous as tardigrade funny and informative.
Quick, draw a circle! *drawn oval instead* *proceed to get pummeled by millions of microscopic water bear*
Squishy tardigrades
they're like instant-creatures. just pour in water and boom. like ramen or something
Ssmmeeewwth
Wooo! Thank you Zefrank! My day is blessed and my heart is full.   Will use this for a happy boost after work.  Much love to you and stay safe!
Jealous of David Attenborough 😂😂
They honestly look really cute, especially when they walk, like little anteater bears
That looks like a A red turd shaped red Loaf of bread
Finally!
Remind me of Spore game.
This is great talking about these little dudes yesterday in zoology class
I love this
Once again, asking for a True Facts About Jerry
I can’t be alone in being ok, NOT pooping crystals.
The Legend Has Returned 🙌🏽
YESSS
First
tardigrade is my favorite
heheeh poops crystals
How many tardigrades come out of my shower while I shower?
Yaaaaaaas! Finallly~
I am henceforth refering to tartigrades as Micro-gremlins.
They look like they have gold in their bodies at the beginning :0
HE HAS RETURNED
This has been uploaded 7 minutes ago and there are already over 200 comments, what the fuck guys?
Ad starts at 5:46 and ends at 6:39
Smeewth
The scientist who named the Tardigrade never saw a bear, that I'm sure of.
So happy to see another video to pop up! (:
tiny worm
The only documentary series that can keep my attention
Jerry is really slipping today but thanks for the VID! What a wonderful animal
Gummy bears
"You see the animal from above or below, kinda like POV pornography." I will always love this channel.
You’re late my friend. You said it would come out at noon. It’s noon o’ 7 my friend
Wait a minute...    _That ain't a bear..._
True Facts about Jerry when
I was ready
Jerry is obviously inspired by the work he does with you and is just trying to impress with his amazing tradigrade modeling skills
HETERO TARTAGRADES WOO HOO!
It looks like a Demodex mite. Jerry needs to get his act together. Can I have Jerry’s job?
"Science isn't a style of photography,Jerry!"🤣
"Science isn't a style of photography Jerry!" -zefrank, 2021
Early for the true facts™️
Damn it jerry.
Someone should make an AMOLED wallpaper with the tardigrade poop.
wake up babe theres a new true facts video
I have never clicked on a new upload faster...
F, I hate my YouTube. I hit like, subscribe and the bell so I would get a notif at release but what's this? 174 peeps already.
Diatoms...... Diatomaceous Earth?

Jerry is becoming self aware
Tardigrade feets are so adorable
You’re a genius
Insert obligatory “The last time I was this early” comment.
Yes, new True Facts 😎❤️

Jerry deserves a raise for all the effort he put into making those models.
Pop
First time I'm early.. I've been watching all his old vids
You be so smart..
I love that zefrank is collaborating with real scientists to make these now
Thanos: Finally! A worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary!
Jerry just wants a photography career
Such beautiful creatures.

Nice way to end my day 😂😂
YAAAAS! This landed just as my lunch break started. 😀
What a lovely day now that I’ve found this video!
I knew today was going to be a good day😂
I'm sure Jerry love his job.  And i would too,if i had to work with Zefrank1
He chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace. And with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. And those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... Tardigrade
YES
we don’t know when he’ll appear but he never disappoints
It’s a good day when Zefrank uploads
Ive waited so long for next upload that I jumped when I saw the notification
Its happening! Stay calm!
Yeeeeeey zefrank! ❤️

"I'm fucking invincible!"
The name Water Bears implies the existence of an entire microscopic forest including water Honeybees.
Look like they ate LED lights
Who came here just to see views?
When I die I want to be reincarnated as a tardigrade.
I love this channel
*h*
I see a zefrank1 video, I click like and then play :)
Last time I was this early...no.  I can't say anything.  Truth is, my life has not meaningfully changed in the last few years.
Hell yeah
♥️♥️♥️
better than Morgan Freeman
Sea blob! Sea blob! Sea blob!
Oh snap, here at 4 views.
The tardigrade, also known as Nature's doomsday prepper. Can survive space, boiling hot water, arctic etc. But any small fish could pick them up and eat them.
I'm glad your back!!
