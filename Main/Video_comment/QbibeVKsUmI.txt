On his day pogba
Priverma chaine Juventus u10
wish poggers stayed at juve man, wouldve bin at his peak by now
🇨🇻🇨🇻
Ma perché esulta Bremer
Finally Pogba debut 🙌🙏.
Надо Юве строчно менять защиту и вратаря, вратарь нужен надёжный как у Барселоны минимум.
Вот это дерби я понимаю. Супер. Юве всё таки одержал победу!
most cheatest team in the world !!!😂
Forza Juve💪🏻🔥
Everyone started to pass with the heel like Kvara 😁
still will make it to top four
Where was Di Maria? Gone missing again. As always
I dint understand , why chiesa isn't getting the 90 mins he deserves
0:09 Where's the right back?
Congratulations Juve ⚽⬛⬜
Delusional if you can’t beat Torino that’s Juventus new fans name 😂
M
That Radonjic substitute cameo was iconic and memorable for all the wrong reasons. What a derby!
2:14 ❤
Glad to see Pogba back 🤝🥂
Locatelli upgrade 🔥
I Pray For Your Soul  Judgement Is Justice #WeThePeople
Not bad. Now give back those 15 points, thanks.
Juventino!
forza juve!!

Come SEMPRE Torino e solo BIANCONERO 🤍🖤💪🏽
Giant club.
Eccellente
Juventus will be great again I promise
I wonder Juve won almost all of their matches after got 15-points-penalty. They barely could win any game before that penalty.
Diz aí  tal Deus justo porque esses macacos merecem e eu nao ?
2:06  wow ❤️
Flopped on the ground when the ball came over, was nowhere near for the other goal. What talent does Poopa have? Same as at MANU for 6 years, a heap of donkey doo.
My Boys Pogba 10, Chiesa 7😍 Let's goooo Juve
This is a derby and in a small stadium for a big club yet still so many empty seats which is embarrassing. No wonder Juve are broke. 😂
Wih mantap lah serangan comeback nya nih
Juve harus perbanyak pemain lokal dan perancis :)
What a game
MOHAMED YANN NATHAN
Poor allegri. He never had a real team from the start of the season...now he had to back straight at the top in the next years...chiesa pogba di maria valahovic kostic are great players.
Nice to you fan's Juventus
Great to see Pogba back on the pitch
Fagioli is the real deal
Allegri out
Goooo juveee
Forzaaaaaaa❤
Bremer and Danilo great defender💪
Pogbaa🥺💥
If rabiot is underrated 👇
vlahavic and rabiot to united
Миранчук не затащил
Epic game seriously
wspaniale, forza Juve!
Thanks juventus, I needed them to win so my fifa 23 sbc player I completed is getting an upgrade
Most of Juve goal come from set piece not open play this season and the season before,,such a waste line up
Погба вернулся,теперь будем смотреть ювентус
Cuadrado🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴
надо еще с них 15 очков снять
Ювентусу повезло , практически всё залетело, а так равная игра ..
Pogba change the game instant
Forza Juve
#Pogback
Juventus Torino⚫️⚪️
The game was so Worth watching
We are doing so well and didnt let the 15 point deduction affect us. Forza Juve!
Wow Chiesa really changes the game 😮😮😮
U am ac Milan fun but I like the old back again congrats
I hope we get to see the best of pogba this time around
it's so reassuring to see an actual visible difference when those subs came on. Fagioli is really shaping up to be a top player, too. And the whip on Kostic is mad.
Juventus тамаша ойын женыс
Cuadrado's "goal" should have been given as an own goal LOL. He hit it straight at the keeper until it was deflected. None the less, what a game. It not for Serie A punishing Juve fans and the players instead of the real culprits, Juve would be second in the league right now.
Люблю такой Юве!!!!удачи с аппеляцией.
Forza Juve 🖤🤍
Should have stayed with us at Utd Pogs........you would have won trophies.
Vanja so bad goalkeeper
wow juve roster is thick now that the injured are all coming back
Juve can still get top 4
Welcome Pogba dan chiesa 👍👍👍
Merci beaucoup
If Juve get top 4 after the points deduction then Serie A should be liquidated.
Glad to see Pogba.. I had completely forgotten about him
Влахович ни о чём, Погба ноль.
Bremer is a fool or something, he scored with his own and is still celebrating 😂
Bremer saved them
Gantikan alegri dengan acerbi pelatihnya brighton,juve bisa bermain atraktif dan menarik.
Grandioso ...
Pogba 🔥🇫🇷
three brasil behind were still great💪
Once again Bremer failed to defend on both goals they scored. Nice header tho.
Thanks you
Gleison bremer scoring against his former club 🔥💪
FORZA JUVE !!!
what a game ❤❤❤
Pogbaaack🎉
Pogba is back...
This is the best league in the world .epl best side pass, back pass league in the world.
Отличная игра
Let's respect Pogba all my Fans l know when he likes to play football he will make u all smile
not nice Bremer's exultation
Elportilo elkontolo
Juve ganti kiper nya jgn dia lgi
The moment people started criticising pogba he became fit all of a sudden.
Problem of Juv3, they dont have a goalkeeper already for years and nobody from staff cant see that. Ps: Also Rabiot :))
I love how Vlahovic kept cheering his teammates up after every goals even though he didn't score himself...👍🏾
Why Bremer celebrated 😑
Karakter asli sudah kembali ditemukan😍  Berjuang hingga akhir✊🏻💪🏻  Salam hangat dari Juventini garis keras Indonesia  Bravo...
Pertama kali ngefans torino waktu derby sama juventus di 2001 waktu skor imbang 3 - 3 dengan duet ferrante dan luccarelli
Pobag 🐷🙉🦍🦥🐈
Forza Juve!! let's gooo!!!
F.kostic aslinya gg juga umpan ny🥰
Am happy to see #Pogba on pitch after a long time 💪💪🙌🙌
Красивый матч! Ювентус возвращается!
Bremer no Respect
derby yang selalu berat sebelah,. kasihan ama si torino,. resiko club pas pasan
Nice my locatelli is getting a plus two upgrade
No more skate diving Pogba please
Super MIRA
Excelente por Cuadrado!!
Di maria 💥
happy to see pogba back
Brazilian defense line....sigh.....We were lucky
Even for a derby the stadiums not full
Juventus only needed Pogba and chiesa to come from bench so that to change the game.
Cheers for my locatelli upgrade
Torino actually not bad
legendary first squad is now happened
0-1 Karamoh 1-1 Cuadrado 1-2 Sanabria 2-2 Danilo 3-2 Bremer 4-2 Rabiot
Miss Pogba so much . Welkom back PP
terbaik pokoknya Juve  gak masalah dikurangin poin  ttp kalian Harus Bangkit seria coppa italia Liga malam Jum'at  semangat Bianconeri  bangkit dari keterpurukan jangan kalah sama keadaan
Bremer celebrating on his old club 😔
Juventus one love!
jovantas ..
Forza juveeeee
Tony Sanabria pake gaya mr tukul arwana
Great to see Pogba back in action in the farmers league
BRAVO JUVE !
Jubentu£
Juve gave pogba #10. That's lot of respect.
Y di María?

Juventus the best

🅿️🅿️ is back
Thanks for this match resume.
หวานเจี๊ยบ
🇮🇹 🙏🏻
Forza Juve congratulations
So happy to see Pogba back again, strong & playing  ...
I had respect for Bremer, until now. Why did he celebrate the Goal with the former club that raised him to a Top level?
Wait...I thought Pogba in MU
Must starting up pogba chiesa no sub
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Pogba Is home
finoallafine 💪💪
50 point
That Brazilian back like for juve needs to go , so unstable at the back .
POGBACK BABY
Welcome back pogba 😁
Pogboom
People will always try to sink Juve, but Juve always find a way to going back up 💪🏽⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛
1:52 - Vlahovic don't want to score against his National Team Goalkeeper 🤣🤣🤣
Bravo juventus
What a derby 👏
Forza Juve sempre e per sempre 🤍🖤
My face hurt from smiling, when Chiesa and Pogba check in, I feel so proud of my team, the players been through a lot, hope they all can have sweet ending at end of this season.
Salam 51 & 15 poin. Forza Napoli sempre
Glad to see you back on the pitch Paul ... and by the way Bremer you shouldn't have celebrate like this against your old team
Hay errores en defensa que debe corregir la Juventus
Kostic movement just like Rin Itoshi
Yes my locatelli got upgraded lol 😂😂😂
Hmm none of that goals come from striker,dusan wasn't lucky to score that
Thanks for the +2 on my locatelli boys sound
Torino's set piece defense is horrible. 🙃
-15 point.. and juve will be finish big 4.
bruh why can't PL highlights be like this
Vlahovic become a just mediocre player in Juve.
I think Rabiot play better this season.
Pogba and Chiesa are the difference between Juventus attacks
Juventus is my team in the SERIE A
Welcome back Pogba
28/02/2023 às 09:21 PM
I love Szczęsny but Perin deserves the 1st spot of goalkeeper
Juve deserve so much better than their parasitic directors who got them the points penalty...Allegri is doing wonders
Considering that Torino, as always played without goalkeeper, I am surprise they conceded 4 goals only.
Kostic’s been really consistent man
kostic is juventus most productive player and hardest worker. lucky to have him
Вы для чего ходите на стадион? Вы можете скандировать чтобы воротах был Перин а не этот клоун!?! Что вы за фанаты такие непонятные!?
#ForzaJuve *🔥J🔥*
Juventus win W 🗿🍷
🤍🖤🤍🖤🔥🔥🔥
Juve can ball if everything goes as planned.
👍💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Bremer's celebration 🤨
Told y’all all the sudden you will see them top 6 zone. #Allegri the dinosaur.
Harus juara europa league biar masuk ucl musim depan 👍
Pogba 😍
JURIC IS STUPED!
Forza Juventus
juve 🤟
Forza la vechia signora
FYI: The last time Torino beat Juventus in Serie A was on 26th April, 2015.
Dimaria❤️🔥
Welcome back Pogba...😊
Local rivals and they still can’t fill the stadium shambles
Juventus is back don't be that surprised that Juventus might qualify for the UEFA champions league.
포그바가 돌아왔다.pogba is back

Chiesa pembeda di babak kedua
