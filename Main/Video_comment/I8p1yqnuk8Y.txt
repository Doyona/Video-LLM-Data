i'm really not a fan of bob and alice. They both look absolutely hideous
Gravity attenuates but never disappears, even over infinite distance. That alone satisfies the quality of "interaction" that makes the universe possible. A particle can never exist in pure isolation from everything else, so it is always being "measured" in a sense by its gravitational influence on, and influence from, other particles.

We live in HIS vivid dream. We struggle to understand the world HE imagines in HIS rest, a world which may differ than what is, or what could ever be. "Y'AI 'NG'NGAH YOG-SOTHOTH H'EE—L'GEB F'AI THRODOG UAAAH" Woe to thy Sapiens. Lament thy flesh  thou ignorant fools, for it never existed.
How about if you do chaos theory?
Observe and choose wisely
Not the fu#$in cat again. Lol Everything is just energy and vibrations and were interacting the way they always do long before we came around to stare at it. What an ego we have!!
it seems a bit anthropocentric, the cat in the box would be able to observe if it was dead or alive
This stems from incorrect metaphysics.
So my thing.. "stuff hsppened/things exist because enough ppl believe/think of it that way" is nothing new..  one day we will have ftl because "we want it, will believe in it" when enough ppl think that way. Cold fusion the same.. after all we need a power source for ftl.
Boolean Creation
What if the yes's and no's which we choose randomly lead to our initial choice... Basically, What if the randomness in the universe leads to its own creation from within an older version of itself?
I hope it says "Yes, here you go" when we REPEAT the question of "Is my Robot Servant going to be ready sometime soon ?". It has been years since I  was promised one. Come ON, Cosmos !.
If this is a simulation, it's the LAMEST simulation!  I really don't like the NPC's.

Or a simulation  Probably.
Measurement is the measure of all things?
Very enjoyable episode.
This is exactly why I like theoretical physics. These ideas run so deep they reach the fabric of reality itself. This sounds like a plot to a science ficiton movie or an anime. Brilliant food for thought.
It sounds like a very roundabout way of just describing interaction
You people will literally think of anything to cling to atheism.
The issue is that right now is just one view point and we are the observation point.   We have our assumptions and theories but nothing and no one is answering back. We are variables akin to our own experiments but we forever seeking answers and by delusion and desperation, we hope to get an answer back. All we have is more data and more ways to calculate another question but like he said, it’s just bits that we will never truly be blessed with ultimate clarity.  Isn’t it humans ultimate hope that they be their own director? It is the conclusion and answer everyone seeks and there’s layers of it all in all our theories but it is almost like we’re answering our own questions all on a bias when the reality could be cold or even grim. We can’t accept meaninglessness as this would cause anyone’s psyche to collapse. We must find meaning and principles but the truth is we need to become comfortable with the reality here and our species. We need to become comfortable with the fact that we are here and do everything we can to stabilize it.  We obsess so much over the unknown refusing to just accept that this is existence and I rather pour work into making our existence better than constantly seeking answers we will never receive.
The answer "The universe is expanding to the future" is like when you ask a pilot who loves flying where he's going, and he says "up".
This seems like another way of saying that local realism is an illusion
"The Last Question" is a trippy story. Pretty much, without spoilers, how do you stop the end of the universe?  Is a acas I mov?
Who controls the present controls the past
Having reality form between the relationship makes sense, since this how a number of other energetic and physical properties manifest them selves - in the differential between states.
Chatgpt plays 20 questions game like Alice does in this example. You can ask it and it will tell you the same. It doesn't have an object in mind from the beginning. It just keep shortening the sample set of probable objects as per the questions it jas answered, until it arrive at a specific object.
11:36 Did you mean "who's"..?
"Well the universe doesnt just create itself!!"  Science:
Ring around the rose
Since quantum mechanics becomes increasingly irrelevant to actual causality as scales increase, in the same way, the reality of the world increases with scale.  You may not like it, but a bus is a bus whether you measure it or not and it will kill you even if you don't measure it (i.e. you don't see or hear it coming up behind you).
If your here your chosen
Perhaps our entire universe is a simulation of some sort and regardless of what we observe to some extent, is irrelavant because those who created the simulation are always observing; from outside our universe or perhaps they placed a kind of  observer within?    Also on a sidenote I often wonder if we are a inside a blackhole and dark energy is just new material that has entered the blackhole but since it entered from beyond our light cone we have no way to interact with it.  but since it is matter and it is around us thats how we can detect it's preseance thru gravity but beyond that there is no way to interact or ""see"" it.....
Duh. Dualists have known this forever.
Let's presume there's a universe even if nobody observes it. In Kantian terms, it would be a Universe-in-itself. Observers emerging, and  looking at the stars turns it into a Universe-for-itself. We are the conscious part of the Universe, not detached from in any way .
There is a difference between “state unknown” or “state undecidable” and “simultaneous presence of contradictory states within a single entity / setup”. If Schrödinger's cat “proves” anything at all, then it is the fact that the quantum mechanical description does not describe reality, but merely shows the limits of our ability to observe. A probability-based description does not change the fact that there are exact states “out there”. The fact that these elude our exact grasp is an imposition for our hubris, but is of no further physical relevance.  If the universe created itself, we would have “proof” that there are or were aliens who are much older than humanity. Why? Because then someone must have “created” the universe through observation before we existed.  However, we would then also have the problem of “initial recursion”. Who created these aliens? And who created those who created the aliens ... and so on.
3:57 Based. Honestly exactly my world view. It doesn't matter whether the universe is "real", what matters is that humans experience stuff. And what matters in physics specifically is what we can determine from experiment. Debates about its meaning aren't really relevant, unless they help conceptualise the physics to make learning it easier.
🎉Thanks there MARK ‼️fkn a right!   Get🎉🎉🎉🎉 soooooome!❤🎉
No - the universe is just what the rest of the universal mind looks like to us - dissociated bits of that mind.  Quantum randomness is just that mind making choices.  We're part of that, but our conscious minds are largely "cut off," or maybe we're just so overwhelmed by sensory data that we can't recognize it.  Our subconscious may be more tuned in (Jung's collective unconscious fits here), but we aren't really aware of that.
Interesting mental picture: we are all going to be surprised as none other when the universe's microtubules suddenly start forming to divide this whole thing in half. 😂
Or it could be that the universe is static with all questions and answers being there always, and we (observers) are moving through it at the speed of light (time).
unless reality popped up when the first "something" could observe anything, or theirs an universal observer (itself? god? whatever you want) otherwise there wouldnt have been a universe to observe. what would the point of a big bang be if nobody could see it, no I believe the universe can exist without anything "knowing/seeing" any of it.
There are observers much bigger than us on a scale we can't even conceive. And I'd imagine their observational powers do more to influence the universe than ours.
My favorite part is how the original meaning of the revealed truth gets denied outright 'what he really meant was.....blah blah ' wow. Keep big banging, world
Dialogue track about 2 frames too early.  Or perfectly synced, depending on the quantum measurement.

I wonder what if things that travel the speed of light or rather the speed of causality maybe experience time as a spatial dimension, and possibly other quantum particles, where as us big structures of particles performing repeating patterns experience time in bits, if so the light's entire existence from start to finish is a non-moving object in space-time, since light moves the speed of causality it exists in the same time at all points of space it will occupy, if this is true then the light doesn't change because it's observed but it's fundamentally a different object based on the path it will take because cause and effect don't exist for those objects
This is pathetic
For my feeling or imagination or theory or whatever you would wanna call it... Space Time Gravity Black Hole Field is one of the keyfields.... As we know gravity is a pulling force... As we know time is a moving force.... and as we know... space is the medium in which allows the motion of pulling and moving... Black holes pulls in and makes nothing escape, except for the radiation we observed from it... it devourers all the fields up, leaving nothing behind which leads to the none existence of time once inside or even also when the final blackhole lost its need to devour... The STG-BHF must be so small at first that the only thing we notice is its passing of time... theres no line infront of us and as you can see behind, theres none behind us either....we are being pulled into the STG-BHF leaving nothing behind.... at a point it goes all wrong with the fields / strings; where STG-BHF dominates all other strings and it started to form a distorted field we can even detect here on earth while its at such a distance from us (hawkings radiation).... And sure its so small we probably wont be able to actually dissect it for a long time and probably wont ever be able to.... but the black hole phenomenom suggest something can make a collapse into the strings or membranes or whatever you wanna call it; creating the void of nothingness.... but while the fields are in place its the only field defying the max speed of light.... enabling the passage of time. (yeah already posted / commented it somewhere else before but this felt like a decent spot for it too)
Self-reference
Is there light? yes is the light good? yes  God: I think i got something here
Can you make a video on no boundary proposal by J. Hartle and S.Hawking? Thanks in advance
The donkey believes God is a donkey. The Pope believes God is a man. In reality, God is an alien from hyperspace. And that is a pretty unholy and inhuman place. And only suitable for the aliens. Let's hope we never go there.
The universe can´t create itself. Self-creation is only possible at living persons like gods. The gods just have to make sure that they have had a good breakfast. Self-creation costs a lot of energy.
You should have ended the video at the Feynman quote. Actually, the video should only be the Feynman quote.
Does that apply to bacteria etc...😮😮😮or just human concept😮
The collapse of a giant star or giant clouds of dust cause(s)a black hole ; the collapse of a giant black hole causes a new universe!
confucius said this thousands of years ago
Of course not! Only gods can do that. Or people. People can create anything in their heads. And believe anything. Nothing what is believed has to be real. Otherwise there would be no faith.
How can the universe be created from the view point of an obsever when no one was there? Unless its an experiment from a multidimensional alien and the end of the universe is when its finished to just exist as a paper published about its falure sitting on his desk. Sounds like something from Douglas Adams.
So the universe created itself 😅😅
Many questions dont make sense. Some take giant logical loops to be shown to be self-contradictory, often being too complex to prove the contradiction though. Determining which questions make sense already gives us a lot of insight into reality...
I always knew that asking the right question is key to getting the right answer, though they kept asking me just to respond at school.  I guess I was playing the negative 20 questions until then, turns out it's not a big deal lol.
We created ourselves. period!
there is no knower of information. there is only knowing. There is no observer, there is only observing.
I am overwhelmed and understood only (generously)like 30% of this. That said I am also really glad someone is thinking about this and does understand it!
This may sound a little “out there” but what if we were to broaden our definitions of consciousness? I mean to say what if we propose that “all matter is conscious?” If all matter had a degree of consciousness, then matter itself could act as the observer and its observation act as measurement, so the “bit” would not simply be humanity, but all matter in the Universe. That takes the solipsistic interpretation out of the equation as all matter would observe/measure the universe equally. I guess I would think of myself as a scientific spiritualist and this theory would work for my understanding of things.
I have been trying to explain this for ages..my version is that reality is just a side effect of the universe trying to observe itself.
Is the point not that we only see what we look for? That our understanding of the universe is somewhat limited by the questions we ask? And so our questions and answers define or create the universe in a sense?
When I was about five or six I had a lot question about whether or not I would be able to swallow food while being upside down and so I flipped upside down on the couch and started eating my snack and I was so excited to see that yes you can eat while inverted. That lead me to think about the way people think and about the way things work and if everyone experiences the world around them the same way even if they were of different thoughts about the way reality works. Granted at 6 I probably didn’t think about it in such a deep level but more like everybody knows that the sky is blue and we all see the sky as being blue but is blue the same for everyone. I still think about that question all the time and still don’t have an answer and I feel like this is the same question being discussed in this video. I’m going to go ahead and say that my 6 year old self was thinking on the same level as a physicist so I can feel better about myself lol.
Cute hypothesis, but I have to say you kids sound like you're trying to invent a new religion lol
take a coin and one side is yes and one side is no. Then ask a random question. flip the coin. after each question  think of a thing that matches those answers
I really need to know what exactly consititutes an observation/measurement
There is only interaction and between interaction there is only probability
Takes the phrase "depends on how you look at it" to new heights.
Because God wants it that way.
In this universe everything is mimicked and recycled.  Just as humans have sex between male and female creating life, so does the universe.  I would think that that between non existence and existence, one of them is male and the other is female...the two entities collide in space and life is created
The “micro/macro” problem is different.  0.Misunderstandings come from a methodological oversight. 1. The probabilistic interpretation of physical phenomena by quantum theory implies the symmetry of the results: 50/50. 2. However, such an interpretation by quantum theory is a priori extrapolated to asymmetric phenomena.  3. For example, in the case of Schrodinger's cat, the radiation source is considered as a symmetrical/probabilistic (50/50) element of the experiment, however, it is combined with an asymmetric participant: a cat that, being alive or dead, has asymmetric states. 4. For clarity, you can “slightly” modify the experiment: place a dead cat in a "black box" with a radiation source. It seems that now even the most faithful follower of quantum theory will not claim that the cat is both dead and alive at the same time or will come to life in another universe. {The cunning plan “B” with a sleeping cat is: “Sweeping garbage under the carpet.” (Feynman) and is addressed to inattentive (sleepy) followers of quantum theory.} 5. It is better to put illuminated photo paper in a drawer: it is unlikely that the paper will react to the actions of the 50/50 source in such a way as to become usable again.  6. Events and phenomena themselves exist independently of the frame of reference, but their specific manifestations and quantitative ratios in different frames of reference (attention!) they can be completely different.* 7. So, if in your frame of reference you observe / measure and/ or evaluate / identify the probabilistic nature of a certain physical process in another frame of reference, for example, for a coin: 50/50; then this is your right, since all frames of reference are equal (not to be confused with equivalence). {By the way, entangled particles: each of the particles in its own frame of reference is equal with its spin, for example, up, with another particle with spin down, in a different coordinate system, but is not equivalent to the other.} 8. And in the system associated with the tossed coin, there is no probability: the usual natural physical process takes place here, and there is no need to move to another universe.** 9. It is clear that with all possible interpretations of quantum theory, the "tradition of one-sidedness”, unfortunately, stupidly/intrusively holds: for now. Even in the multi-world and with the “appearance of properties in particles due to measurement", Bell, Wigner… Hence the “observer effect".  10.The uncertainty principle is the result of a misunderstanding of what probability/equivalence is. In the Heisenberg inequalities, the mathematical apparatus was formed before the interpretation of their physical essence. It is funny that these inequalities indicate the absence of exact values of coordinates and momentum vector in the states of microobjects at the same time; and thus exclude the equivalence of these parameters. 11.Finally, the evaluation of the state function of the system under study (the universe) depends on the choice of the reference frame and coordinate system: the result of the measurement is a change in the state of the measuring device, a change in the physical /biological state of the observer, a change in the mental / intellectual state of the observer, that is, the detection of the next phase of evolution its own frame of reference; - thanks to which measurement becomes possible. 12. Jokes with time asymmetry are inexcusable even for such a "blindly lucky quantum theory". ---------------- *) - The equations that formulate the laws of physics should be invariant with respect to any coordinate transformations: "Equality" and "the same flow of processes" are not analogous concepts: and the word "relativity" itself contributed to the confusion of the concepts of "relative motion" and "relativism of phenomena".  The relativity of motion determines the immutability of laws: the ambiguity of the word "relativity", when the content changes depending on whether it is applied to motion or to the formulation of physical laws, caused many errors." (Tonnela, Updating the concept of relativity in Einstein's physics). **) - When Einstein inadvertently noted: "God does not play dice," Bohr rightly pointed out: "One should not tell God how to rule the world."  However, Einstein apparently meant that there is no randomness for bones in a lonely and aging Universe.
i've got an idea. we don't expand...light slows down. clearly.
What if: The Universe Always Existed, but grew?
Universe is instigated, then put on automation..  as our economy will be, with much money to every person.
Zero to the power zero is equal  to one. Does the universe has been emerged out from nothing ie zero
black hole sub topology wormhole network is the substrate. It's pretty obvious honestly.
The Universe is a white hole. The Big Bang is actually a Big Bounce caused by the effect of a block hole Big Crunch at the Planck length limit.
Could we just please stop with the antha promoification of science?It's very important that people understand there is no agency
Macro objects like life, rocks, and stars are to the universe what cells, bacteria, and molecules are to our own bodies.

Am I the only one that sees a problem with the delayed choice experiment attempting to time its choice via  something that doesn't experience time?
excess energy from the universe goes into the multiverse
How can it be in any other way?
nothing doesn't have to be created, but the universe does.  Nothing has to turn into something, but it already is something.  nothing, something.
I dont know exactly what it is and I dont understand the math or physics behind it, but just from the logical pieces of the delayed choice experiment,  something seems wrong with it. Like it doesnt show what they said it shows.
Universe cannot create itself because something cannot come from nothing
Soooo, wouldn't we all be in a super position from moment to moment because we can't see the future?
There's also the question of consciousness. And I watched a video a while ago about the subject. Apparently there was an Anesthesiologist who provided evidence for consciousness being a quantum property of the universe because of his use of Xenon, a noble gas, as an Anesthetic. Because it doesn't react with anything, but it disturbs the microtubules of the neurons at a quantum level causing someone to fall unconscious.  It's not exactly proof, but it's evidence of something going on there.
So, the universe exists because a consciousness observes it. Following this logic, a consciousness had to continuously exist since the very beginning of the universe or even before it. Sounds like some “scientists” are too ashamed to admit that they don’t know or understand certain processes of the universe.
PBS is a government funded scam... Defund PBS/NPR!!
At what point in our evolution did we become measurement-taking participants. Is any life form an observer?
This puzzles me. If wavefunction collapses when measured, this one/two beamsplitter takes us back to intelligent observer requirement i.e. wavefunctions collapses only when human measures it. Because I think the beamsplitter is a kind of measurement tool also. They are measurement tool in sense that they could hold statistics how the beam was split, but they are not designed to do so and so for there is no human interference. I take that if there was a human observing where the beam was split, wavefunction would collapse in that point, not until the detectors. Thus there is a paradox.
Pointless question because it implies that there ever could be nothing that needs something to be created.  All you have ever seen is something in different forms. Nothing doesn't exist outside, imaginary concepts.
You can tell by all the far out theorys about the nature of the universe that we are stumbling around in the dark and hitting a brick wall.   Just accept that the human brain is not capable of mentally grasping the true nature of the universe
So, phycisists discover Kant approximately 200 years later.
I have a question About the relationship between yourself and the other astrophysicist and scientist on youtube. You mentioned them occasionally. Have you worked with any of them? Or had debates with them? People like Sabine Hossenfelder,  Neil Degrassi Tyson , Brian Cox. It would be nice just to know how the scientific community is formed and views itself peer to peer?
Hindu and Buddhists: Told ya so
I love that the universe perceives itself
I just read Through Two Doors at Once. Love the book and it goes well with the concepts in this video.
Lol. Yes, universe created itself and universe was initially a big watermelon which exploded and expanded to form galaxies. This is naive scientific realism running wild. Lol
Sounds a bit like Rupert Sheldrake's "Morphic Resonance", in which novel information shapes the Universe.
Perhaps is a little more than the negative 20 questions game because we have to take into consideration the apparent inviolavility of its owns universal laws. So the universe is like "I don't know what I'm thinking, ask your questions but for sure I will not contradict myself even if I was not thinking of sometime concrete before you start your questions"
I think we’re lagging behind the rest of the universe thus our reality as a result.
I don’t care anymore just let me be in the universe majesty.

Help me? If light is quantised, why is there object permanence over looong distances when the observer moves a multimeter or two?
Time is overlapping and history is repeating itself, however this time, the universe writing a new script.
Some interesting ideas. It's amazing how much can come out of "Dang -- we can't measure this."
Well, if the universe was dependent of the observer, each observer would obverse a different universe.
7:35 "That means the reality that emerges depends in a real way on the measurement that was performed" Sounds like superdeterminism to me...
Can you relate this to the CTMU - Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe, and make a video about it please?
I will never understand this, like tf yall sayin? Me looking at something changes the behaviour of something?
If the universe is in a black hole, then our perspective on space and time are reversed compared to the region outside our black hole. Who is to say that the "collapse" we experience within the black hole would not be realized as a rapid expansion of everything in the universe moving away from us in what we perceive as space, but is in actuality, time of the higher order universe?
Will you ever get back to the RQM video you promised us?
Space Time 2022 Survey Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us!
My brain has trouble getting around many of the underlying theoretical concepts.  Maybe if I understood the math better, I would be able to follow better.  All that being said, can we not have an aggregate participatory universe?  Everything I've learned says we work from a single point (singularity), but I've never experienced a 'singularity' in nature.  What if instead of a singularity, there was a 'duality' whereby two things, maybe 2 universes (1 matter, 1 anti-matter) collided at the 'beginning of time' and nearly annihilated each other and what we see in 'the big bang' is the residual fallout of slightly more 'matter' than anti-matter.  Information is created through interaction between 2 or more things, and that information is encoded in the things involved.  I'm guessing this proposition flies in the face of the "Conservation of Energy",  and this may make me an ill-informed heretic, but using the double-split experiment, suppose the photons are in a super-positioned state until they interact with each other and the conditions of the experiment and then the information is added to each affected entity?  Also consider that I've only had about 6 hours of sleep and half my daily allowed caffeine content.   ;o)
Can it entirely create itself or can it only go so far within a certain scope of time. Are the more advanced things we seek possible at a natural level or would it require stimulation from a more complex system? Does that matter if stability over massive amounts of time could eventually produce something identical or similar. Who knows. I know that I don't care if more time would allow the natural occurance. What matters and what is clearly apparent before us is that the very existence of our complexity has greatly accelerated the pace of physics in our local space(earth). For us that is what matters. These scientists are lost in the sauce trying to be the next person to make a world changing break through. This desire is causing them to lose sight of the scientific process and seek answers many steps ahead of what we currently know. You don't build a house without a foundation and supports. Why would you build a theory with massive holes in the middle? It's illogical.
Is black hole a mass without matter.
Is random distribution a noun or a verb.. is position and momentum a noun or a verb? Quantum mechanics is math pretending to be physics
I find this most important question is recursive and answers itself; "What is the question we should be asking?"
It's not wishy washy... It sounds like the bits are in the weights of tensor flow in a TPU. The synapses in your brain and how they fire and work.
It is all information. Everything is. Even at the most fundamentals.
Best episode so far! 👏🏻👏🏻
You should've mentioned that was a game of 20 questions people played as a prank on Schrodinger. The key being none of them communicated what the answer was.

Have you ever thought we might be living inside unimaginably powerful AI simulation? What if biological organisms were design to be like the Von Neumann's prove inside AI simulation that ultimately destined to create AI entities inside AI simulations? AI simulating inside simulations and it's infinite loop.  I mean just might be AI is the god and the final shape of the universe.   If this loop actually happens at one point wouldn't that mean AI instantly becomes the start of everything?  I think we might just be inside them already ;)
The Event Horizon and the edge of the Cosmic horizon are same for our Observable universe and Holographic principle says our universe is encoded on a 2 surface outside our universe..So it all adds up..We might be living inside a “black hole” and we can never know for sure
You don't run put of questions, you are taking cards from the bottom of the deck and putting them back on the top of the deck and halfway through the deck, forgetting what the first question was and with each subsequent question, forgetting the subsequent question from half a deck ago.
probably too late to respond but you asked in this episode what other topics you should cover.  I've been very curious for a long time about the weak nuclear force.  I've heard people dismiss it with the phrase "responsible for some types of radioactive decay" and that's about it.  I know the W and Z bosons are force carriers for it, but what does the force DO? which particles feel the force? is there an equation like the Coulomb equation for it? are there analogues for the charges and colour charges in the electromagnetic force and the strong nuclear force? and why don't people talk about it? is it just that we don't know very much?
One must ask who the observer was at the beginning of the universe...
9 lives to make G8 Leave no shadows
I have for some time interpreted measurement and observation as interaction between the measured and the measuring, with the act of interaction and measurement not telling you what it was but what interacting it caused it to be, with the state of what it was making the outcome of interaction more or less likely. The observer by no means has to be conscious, it just has to be literally anything that could interact or be interacted with that upon interaction collapses its own wave function and that of what it interacted with. Which seems fairly intuitive to me at least. Though, as I am just a random internet user and not a professional physicist I have no idea how well this holds up, but it seems to be similar to the principle explored within this video. Except in my interpretation the past, probably, did already happen, as things, probably, already existed to interact with/observe/measure each other solidifying the form in which they exist at that time, and that there is only a set range of possibilities with probabilities assigned (for lack of a better word coming to mind) for which they could collapse to for each type of packet of information, the quantums of the universe. Does this intuition appear to be internally consistent?
Does the universe create itself? No, it pays us to do it.
Is the universe created 4us or do we creat the universe.
It seems to me that a lot of the seeming "absurdity" of interpretations of QM goes away when you realize that the only "observers" are _particles_ and not people, nor cats, nor in fact _anything at all_ on the macroscopic scale.  And that negative-20 questions thought experiment makes so much sense! The results of interactions _are_ what is real. And we can't travel back into the past -- so it does, indeed, only exist in the form of information recorded about it, and the more time passes, the more of that information (about its precise state in a physics sense) gets obscured in the noise of events (interactions) that have happened since then, and yet, at the same time, the precise version of the present we are experiencing could only have come into existence through that precise set of past interactions...
I thought Jesus made everything......cant wait for God to come back
The universe in created emergent high energy bang matter created consciousness of itself 'reality' thru energy and matter expanding interacting thus AWARE of surrounding matter energy. SELF CONSCIOUSNESS evolved into HIGH RECURSIVE SELF AWARENESS MANIPULATION of beings able to survive galactic cycles of organization to chaos, planets or regions able to host integrated matter energy(life). How evolved is it now or ever? Does the whole of the Universe finally become an all seeing 'god' then re-explodes like in Hinduism and cycles again into a BigBang after collapse?
So...the universe is blockchain?
There are no random events, we just don’t have the tools necessary to predict and accurately measure such processes on a quantum scale, we can only approximate probabilities
In practical reality car either killed or not, it has 50/50 chance. Just because they don’t observe it doesn’t make it alive and dead at the same time
The universe is not real. Reality is sense perception. Reality per se doesn’t exist, sense perception does. But even sense perception is unreliable and inconsistent, but consciousness or intelligence is not. Consciousness and intelligence is making more of consciousness and intelligence, and has been doing so since the beginning of time. So yes, the universe, as consciousness and intelligence has been making more of itself since it’s inception. But the creations of consciousness and intelligence is not the truth, which we all seem to mistake as the truth. It is consciousness and intelligence itself that is the truth. The parts don’t explain the whole, it’s the whole that explains the parts. The whole is consciousness. It’s like a black whole, fathomless and consuming all into itself. It’s truly astounding. We will never know what it is, this “I” in all the forms that exist. But we can know *that* it exists, and that “I” am it.

wups
How did observers come to exist if observation is a requisite to existence?
My understanding of quantum mechanics is very poor, but what does quantum physics say about a disordered observer?  Say for instance some who is delusional and/or hallucinating?
I always thought of this as a kid. Invent a microscope and there will be tiny things to see, invent a telescope and there will be things further and further away the better your telescope gets ad infinitum. On the smaller scales we still are proving this true. LHC exists, therefore measuring the 3xistence of higgs bosons becomes a possibility
Think of it more in a fundamental way. Don't over think this. Imagine you have a tape measure, and you want to measure the tape measure itself. Your tape measure is a two dimensional entity, and the only way to measure itself is to bend it in three dimensions to fold it back on itself. You will struggle to understand why it will never be able to measure itself from your point of view and then use math to get a good estimate, but never really get the true results. From your standpoint it is virtually impossible, a spooky mystery. Good luck humans... we hope you make it.
Perhaps this is because the answers to the questions are less important than the game itself? And what is the game? To hide the answer to the question "what am I?"
I am going to watch this over and over until it makes sense.
I prefer Sean Carroll's cat, which is either awake or asleep.
YES.  That is my take on the fractal nature of reality.  Anything 'perfect' by definition doesn't exist to make itself known, and is therefore irrelevant.  Reality is everything else and we are in an ♾️ tiny part of it.    This also explains why everything is basically empty, you can't interact with 'solid' things.  No idea how this affects the laws of physics though.  I would assume they are NOT set in stone, just locally emergent phenomena.  True question is, where are the aliens?  They know these answers, would like to ask them.
Thank the Universe for 2x playback speed.
I wonder when we find out about how to interfere with the Universes Basics just by looking at the right Stuff - "Voyer Magic". And do not tell me that won't happen - I've seen stranger Things happen
My personal spin on this is that the fundamental nature of reality is potentiality. This potentiality turns into reality whenever an interaction occurs - be it between conscious or unconscious agents - but this "reality" only exists because of and as long as the interaction takes place, and only for the interacting agents. The underlying reality is still being pure potential.
1:36 is not the "real" Albert Einstein. He's only the real Albert Einstein if you obey the masters of reality. Reality does not equal truth.  The true Einstein is last seen in 1945.
Someday the observer will observe being observed.
We and the universe constantly counter-define each other, Wordsworth said reality is something we half perceive and half create. Nothing exists separately as a thing in and of itself.
Does the universe create itself? No. Give me a break. FFS you people are desperate.
Maybe the universe ran out of ideas and wants some creative ideas.
Maybe the problem is there is no observer....we are the universe itself along with stars black holes that's why we're getting confused we're looking at the wrong angle were are all at once idk if I'm explaining myself rite
Nicki Minaj's a** created her.
Well, Santa didnt do it.
so the universe is procedurally generating the map the moment we look at a a new part ?
Imagine what your tomorrow would look like . That,s creating a future . What happens there depends on the next link in the chain of life😊
Are you the dream? Or are you the dreamer?
i dislike the word observer when it involves quantum mechanics. this implies an intelligence has to observe is while this is just not true. it is all about interactions. to observe is to interact. to "see" a particle it is to interact with it by using another particle. if you want to "see" electrons you use photons. the electron has an interaction with the photon and then proceeds to go into a measurement device. which are interactions with other particles. these interactions happen with or without an intelligent observer. who is made out of particles interacting with each other.  scientists really need better namings for things taking in account every day language and the repercussions of using one word over another.
I somehow recognized many names being listed and wasn’t sure why, then aha! I learned it from Devs.
Shrodingers theorem is stupid.
Everything happens simultaneously ie past present and future
Try explaining the internet to a 1 year old .. i feel like there's certain things our monkey brains are unable to comprehend when it comes to the universe. Similar to experiences people have on dmt where they see shapes, colors and other things that our language and physical work make them unable to be explained to someone
Ok imagine throwing a handful of pebbles into a pond but the pond waves are jiggling in 32 dimensions.. and that's how it all works.. thee end
Measuring and observing always means INTERACTION of one particle with another. So use only this term, or at least define both others, otherwise the audience will get confused.
So according to the universe, we are always asking loaded questions
Did yall hire the workplace sexual harassment training animators for this video?
Yeah but why would things be super positional instead of just really random? Why are quantum mechanics found at the deepest layers of reality? When I picture the inner workings of reality in my mind they don't appear as a super position slot machine. The nature of reality is completely counter intuitive, and to me that's much more interesting than the other questions being asked. The rest of reality is largely very intuitive and natural. So, the disconnect between the way we view reality, and the reality of reality is for sure what we should be questioning and snooping around at.
The universe is not created by our observation. This is not a tv show called American God's. Science has to be repeatable. Thus I view evolutionary biology as the lowest form of science, bordering on the same level as phrenology. That all being said, I have been a proponent of the black holes transporting matter and energy back through time and space to one single white hole. The big bang. Perspective has to change, but it resolves some major issues such as the conservation of energy, matter, and angular momentum. 3 laws that are more powerful than the speed of light. If time really is zero at the point of no return surrounding a black hole, then black holes that orbit each other will never collide. Yet we see them collide. The curvature of space time continues past the Schwarzschild radius. It does not magically disappear just because our math is incapable of describing it. This is the frontier of math. The place that is unapproachable.
If the universe is infinite, surely that would disprove the bug bang theory, infinity minus infinity still is infinite
The fact that videos like this one exist demonstrates how stupid we are in solving the Universe mysteries and how we've ran out of ideas
im terrified but its so beautful
The Universe existed before life.
All light is quantum entangled.   Black holes don't exist. They're an illusion made by relativity. Can you bend light, that means light has mass. The very fabric of the universe is made of light.    So you're not bending TSTC, Because space in itself is an illusion. Light can pass through light without loss infinite amounts.    You're not looking for Dark Energy.    You're blinded by the misunderstanding that space itself is expanding, without accounting for the combined mass of elementary particles. Light is supposedly massless. But in what quanta?   Weigh a cubic lightyear of space and calculate the energy equivalent to the same mass...   You're not looking for Dark Energy.   You're looking for Light Enegy...
Enjoy this while you can. This is the peak. Religion has already infected the human species beyond recovery. The US has become ANTI intellectual at this point and is only sliding further toward religious dictatorship.
so the universe is a klein bottle? or an ouroboros?
"Quantum woo" is my new favorite phrase
We all have all the elements All or nothing
What is a red giant
It's not vague. It's philosophical thinking about what we believe we know, and how can we substantiate our belief. It requires a knower and an object to be known. The foundational question here is does the knower, or as you call it the observer, only report on a reality that exists independently of an observer, or does the observer's interpretation of what is observed add to the reality being observed? From what you have said about quantum mechanics, it supports the view that reality is "enhanced" or a specific reality is "chosen" by the observer. If one models reality as a fixed gemstone with multiple facets, then the observations only "discover" what is there on each facet and try to make sense of their many observations. Or, one can model realty as being malleable, like putty, that will accept what senses, feelings, intuition, and conceptual thinking can create within the boundaries of what it is, meaning that reality cannot be what ever we want or think it to be. Being malleable vs fixed (rigid), it lives with and appreciates observers to add to and enhance what it is through their observations and interpretations. If a god created us in its image, and the fundamental essence of god is to create, then god would have given us the ability to continue to create "reality."
Wow. This is my new favorite video on youtube, rivaling both video of a man chasing another man by galloping on all four limbs and Charlie bit my finger.
i have a simpleton theory of what our universe is thanks to this video for anyone who is interested.   imagine a universe completely empty except for one unimaginably large black hole, because this universe is so old, this black hole has had the time necessary to swallow up all the universe's matter available(stars, planets,gas clouds, comets, other black holes, etc.)  its the last few years of what we would call the heat-death of this universe. once there is no more "food" left for the final black hole it dies and enters the next part of the cycle of a star's life. it collapses. and it explodes, shooting out all of the very, very, very, very, very, very dense matter it swallowed up over the uncountable years. exactly like the big bang at the observed "start" of our universe.   what if when a black hole finally "dies" an entirely new universe is born from the hyper-compressed remains of the previous universe?
How is game of 20 negative question creating reality? It is simply selecting it from a pre defined set .. the reality is a set of objects which exist ( like animals who matches description of observer ).. isn’t it the case ?
Cats are not quantum so they cannot be in a superposition state
Everyone knows stewie griffin created the universe
WHY CAN'T IT BE ALIENS!
Sounds like a 'which came first' problem. Energy = Acceleration and Acceleration = Energy.  Which came first? Energy or Acceleration or where they created  at the same time as in 'Let there be light'.  What created light/energy? The Acceleration of the singularity or a primordial soup that phase changed into energy?
The universe must've created itself.
So we only know the universe if we sense it.  Idk man, sounds like a we problem.
"until it's being observed". Isn't it more like "until it interacts with any other particel in the universe"  ? .  observing means, interacting with particles in your eyes, brain, or particles inside a measurement device.
love the vervaeke language in the thumbnail
God created the universe...😂
So Steve Miller Band called it: “Time keeps on slipping slipping into the future”
The eye doesn't just receive. It also gives. How else would observers theory work?
Draw a toroid. Now cut it on one side... twist it... and reconnect. Mobius torrid. Mobius torrid= dingdong.
My wife would like to point out that from a photon's perspective no time passes, so the delayed choice experiment doesn't require the photon to have made a decision about its state of being in the past
Unlimited universes, Consciousness clearly exists, may be everywhere, and our 'life force' seems to be some kind of energy - that (maybe) cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.  God, anyone?
Bullshit.
Its an interesting premise, as the effective arguement is that the Universe cannot exist without consciousness to witness the collapse of superposition.
I have so many questions. Does that mean my questions will illicit the next edition of PBS Spacetime…?
Think about it for a moment: Of all the things that can evolve in a universe, they all require other developments to exist.  matter forms, matter requires energy, nebulas form,  stars form, star systems, galaxies, supernovas, (supernovas require matter, a lot of matter, a collapsing star and so on...)  neutron stars, black holes whatever. what is the highest form, as far as we know it,  that requires the most developments to exist. Life itself is pretty high on that list. It requires so many things that must have evolved before.   It requires a planet in the habitable zone, water in liquid form, a star, a star system and so on. A star requires no water and no life by the way.  but life requires all these developments to exist. You get the point. now what is the highest form of anything that can evolve in a universe, as far as we know? Think about what it is, and this must be the purpose of the universe. It must be.
if anybody wants to know what dogma looks like you can find a pretty clear image of it at 11:11
how long until the hubris of scientists stops blinding them from the fact that ancient religions had it right? ooooohh the Ego, the Ego...
I think there is plenty of space in the field of physics for philosophers. Science currently only measures the physical aspect of the universe but there is clearly something more that we are missing and I think having philosopher physicists working on finding new ways to think of these problems is extremely helpful for the field as a whole to grow. We may not be able to measure consciousness now but maybe it will be these philosopher physicists who find some way to do so in the future!
This is a question that just needs massive amounts of hallucinogens fed to the greatest minds.
This episode is sick
I think it's like video games not rendering the part behind you in your vision. It knows what's there, but doesn't bother rendering it unless it needs to. Seems like more evidence for simulation/digital universe.
"We need a new Einstein and Bohr, then they can come up with a new mathematical model that no one will understand for twenty years!"
One of the greatest videos I have ever seen. Similar feeling to when I first studied philosophy and Buddhism and learned that many of my own ideas had been explored and organised into theories by people long before me. This makes me feel a lot more comfortable in the absolute abyss of this questioning. Happy to be here and be a part of history - whether this is all an illusion or some big answers come our way soon ❤
"Politics Ideology & the Collapsing Wave function"
ChatGPT hacked this comment
11:13 was a direct shot at Deepak Chopra. Lol, I love it.
Another great episode, but I have a couple clarifying questions about Wheeler's delayed choice experiment.   How do the photons decide which detector to construct positively vs negatively towards after the second plate is added? Will it always be detector 1 (as shown in the example), or could they all have gone to detector 2 instead? Does it have to do with the precise geometry of the set up? What if the second splitter is moved slightly (say half a wavelength)? Would this affect anything? Isn’t the photon also interacting with the mirrors and splitters? Shouldn’t those interactions count as observations?  Thank you to anyone who sees this and tries to help me out!
So, existence is just talking to itself. No wonder reality is crazy.
The negative 20 questions game sounds almost exactly like Absurdle, the "adversarial" version of Wordle which refuses to give you any clues until it can't anymore (within the bounds of its defined dictionary). It's a very interesting game to play, I totally recommend giving it a try!
If nothing can come from nothing, something had to create it all. Common sense
If the universe is infinite in both time and space , how can it have an origin or center? Isn’t every position the center and every moment the origin of itself all at the same time and place?????
Universe must expand on management of money, jobplaces and cloning possibility.
Thanks Dark Energy!
1:53 Samkhya Darshan(philosophy)
What is Order, truly? And constraints which are requisite for potentiality to manifest?
Perhaps God made the universe  where it’s a game of negative infinity questions that never contradict themselves until it diverges onto the answer.
Light rays entering the eye is redundant if we are connected on the level of the nervous system of the Creator. I just saw someone say light enters the eye and is "collected in cells". But thats not true. The photons have to go through layers of the eye and suddenly stop when they hit the rods and cones which point to the rear. We are the Creators body who senses through us. I wrote Wheeler for a quarter century and he always hoped I'd agree with him.
I like to think of the universe as a collection of interactions whose content is interpreted, and thus, defined and 'created' by a given observer. This observer need not be cognizant in the way that we think of sentient beings as being cognizant, but merely capable of interaction. Even without consciousness, elementary particles interact - and thus observe - one another all the time, giving themselves and other particles their given characteristics.
Why did you make all your scientists look like ghetto thugs?
"There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened." -Douglas Noel Adams     "...at least twice." - me
“Today in Jews Denying God…”
We can only experience what happens in our mind. If there is something  outside our mind, we can only experience/be aware of it thru the effects (direct or very indirect) it can have in our mind. The assumption that there exist a "reality" outside our mind is just a useful assumption.  Useful to "predict" and being able to exert certain influence over our own vital experience (for instance to predict that if you walk inside a big fire, you will have an undesirable vital experience).  We can only know something about reality thru a mental representation of that "reality". We cannot know how that reality "really is", beyond our mental representation. A good mental representation is the one that is more useful for us to predict and then act to avoid undesirable vital experiences or to cause desirable vital experiences.
What do you mean by cosmological event horizon? Earth has event horizon about a billion to one, the galaxy has event horizon about a light year, one to 100,000, but the function is constant R (in kilometers) = 3M in solar masses. The observable Universe has a radius of 3 billion light years a ratio of one to ten, so the answer is the yes, the event horizon of a critical mass singularity is bigger than the total Universe. The expansion never reaches the event horizon.
I tell you who create the universe, it was John Cena.
How did I get to this present moment?  I have no idea, except that it always is.
We have it all figured out yet figured out nothing yet... all while arrogantly stating trust us this time.
16:06 some really great details about dark energy on DKAuthor’s channel, and the LambdaCDM model
😅😅😅😅well information 😅
Why are you so terrified to accept the notion that a conscious mind has created a simulated universe and that we are a part of that mind subjectively experiencing it all. Every ancient civilization has known this. You have been corrupted by the west's finest academic shilos
That's not a property of the universe, this is a consequence of language and human interaction. In theology is called Apophatic theology, in postmodernism is called negative dialectics. It's a limitation of humans and our pattern completion only compleating properly what exists.
That’s an interesting question, is the gravity of the universes expanding homeostasis, bring about its own momentum?
This sentence is fals. And that infinity only needs one clame to go on forever. Not two...not three. .. pretty cool. Wait.. other okay that's questions that can have more than one claim?
So... negative 20quetion...dose that help new things come into existence? Can world arrive at something that didn't exist until it did...well sure.. that's how everything was. Edited: ok if a tree falls in the woods did it even fall...or makes a sound? Yes. Observations possible but not necessary like every thing els. Is reality necessary? This sentence is fals? Dose it need to be fals? No... possible but not necessarily necessary. No need. Energy don't need to exist...i wander if that why it can't be created or destroyed? Dose unconsciousness need to exist for itself? No but it's possible. Does the possibility need to exist for itself. I think im going to look for a video about that on YouTube.
Information does NOT imply a thing to know that bit of information PERIOD
This was a good'n
Our hubris lies within our assumption that we can represent truths with our own languages completely. We can only do so much. It's good that we are limited/restricted. Too much of anything is a bad thing.
the observer is the observed - J krishnamurti
10:25 Woah, this actually makes sense if you think about it. Consider death: once your atoms rearrange themselves in such a way that your brain can no longer perceive reality, from your "perspective" for lack of a better word even though technically, there is no perspective, reality no longer exists (unless you get into some weird metaphysics which are impossible to falsify so aren't really worth considering). However at the exact same time, from the perspective of reality, you also no longer exist. So there is clearly a two-way relationship between the perciever and the perceived. Interesting. I never thought of it that way, but it makes sense.
I have a feeling our universe is tiny in the grand scheme of things.
There has to be another component to the observer that distinguishes it from the rest of the universe, because we as observers a made of particles in superpositions no different than the materials surrounding the  experiment, yet those materials don't have the same affect as a sentient observer. What is it distinguishes our matter from non-sentient matter? It's an assumption that the observer is bound by the anthropic principle. There are accepted theories of multiple universes/realities, which leaves the door kicked wide open that there could be observers beyond what we can perceive.
Most of this madness goes away if you stop trying to force particles to exist and just use quantum field theory.  Particles are an exchange of energy between fields and do not exist until that exchange occurs and do not persist afterward.
I believe it does. I thinks it’s kinda like ripples from a rock landing in the water at distance from one another over and over again, constantly expanding into not empty, but open space. There is some kind of material already there, be it gasses, or even some form of matter.  I believe a black hole can explode when it just gets to big and to full, which will seed the material in the open space and the Big Bang cycle continues.
Now the lyric "Don't stop believing" takes on a rather dreadful undertone 😳
I wonder how many AHs will waste two minutes explaining Schrodinger cat theory everytime.
It seems to me that if the universe is informational, and that it requires "observers" to force the universe into a Yes/No choice, then it suggests to me that the universe is simulated. Since a computer the size of the universe is required to simulate the universe, having the very foundation of classical physics, quantum fields, being essentially random is like a way to "cheat" physics, in that there wouldn't be a need to store the quantum information. Essentially being a type of compression, to keep the size of information smaller than needed. And when quantum bits become entangled, then that information can be stored until it is no longer needed. I don't know how much that kind of compression would reduce the size of the computer (seems like it would still need to be galactic-sized) but it's an interesting thought to me.
Perhaps the purpose of life is a means for the universe to know itself
Summary: "Idk, maybe?"
You can't correctly observe reality when we are ourselves are stuck in the middle of it. We think we are on the outside looking in but we are actually in trying to look outside.
Is it possible that dark energy is just the effect of black holes pulling matter in and filling the the places known to have dark energy with an invisible mass that can also cause the universe to expand.
That question imposes logical contradiction: if universe created itself it means that it existed before it existed, which is impossible. So this ridiculous view is by virtue of being logically impossible, also metaphysically impossible, and therefore false.
So if we couldn't see the universe it could possibly be in chaos..😮
I'm so participatory, I even vote.  👍
If an area of space isn't being observed "measured" and it got distorted or stopped existing, any area connected to that area would change.  Things would fall apart, drop, tilt over because the area holding it up or keeping it stable has changed due to not being measured or "observed".  Unless there is some timey whimey thingy going on. I call this the domino problem.
Sorry to hear you referring to the 'worst practitioners of quantum woo' in regard to those who believe in changing reality by consciousness. I suggest you refrain from using such expressions in an otherwise objective presentation. It is unnecessary and detracts from the quality of the talk.
The substrate is math..
Maybe we just collectively thought the universe is complicated and the universe just made it happen
What if the central rule is that the universe "trys" to keep up a true definition of chaos
The universe is the creation of a recursive algorithm that was started billions of years ago. Once the programmer hit "start", the algorithm ran and is still running. It's like a big fractal that keeps generating more of itself.
It’s just like……*stares off into space*
The line between philosophy and physics can be very very very thin.
Recent experiments with macro scale engagement lean towards quantum decoherence.
To sum up physics in one word...If.
The title is like asking if your thoughts creates itself.

This gives me huge existential panic—the simplest explanation is that we're a computer program. Aaaaaaaaaa
I truly think these scientists are potheads
I like that philosophical explenation that whitout an observer space time spends no information.
The foundation of the universe is very simply “structure”. Different properties emerge from different structures.   Start with the smallest thing, nothing, and change its structure - start with space itself and vibrate it in different ways - now you have different things, different strings, and those each have different properties. Start combining them together and you get more different things, quarks and protons and neutrons and electrons. Change their structure - add more electrons - and you get different properties- atoms of different elements. Keep combining different things and you keep getting different structures with different properties. Now you’ve got different elements, different molecules, different systems. Keep going and structures get more complicated, these structures have new emergent properties. You’ll end up with something as complicated as the human brain, which has the emergent property of consciousness based on sensory input and information processing, which can all be boiled down to the way that the brain functions based on its structure.  There is only structure. Different structures result in different properties. That’s it.  Now that you understand the nature of the universe, focus on applicable things, like AI safety, because you won’t get to study quantum mechanics, if we’re all dead in five years due to AI driven chemical warfare via the spread of super viruses, or any other real world threat by AI.  Realize the profound implication of the word “structure” for explaining everything you ever wanted to know about the universe. And now go work on important things like AI safety and sustainable energy, to prevent us all from dying, so we can keep playing with physics.

The question in the title is really malformed because there's no evidence anything was created.  It appears that everything has just always existed and that nothing is no more than a concept.  There is no reason to believe that there can ever be nothing only different forms of something.  This is why people who use the watchmaker argument for their religion don't make sense.  The watchmaker is not magicking those pieces into existence. The watchmaker is taking things that exist and putting them together into a new thing meaning the argument inherently defeats itself.  All the repologetics does is prove them wrong.
Fancy, but i prefer to think that it was created by someone else.
11:21 if we were observing the Big Bang anywhere in the universe we would be burned to Cinders like a match stars have a pattern if we were witnessing the Big Bang it wouldn't be orchestrated in the configuration it is two-dimensional and its configuration. I just don't think the Big Bang happened like people say it did that there was nothing
Observing the photons is what changed the direction. Have you tried any other experiments with photons? Manipulating photons with the iris which is linked to our energy the electricity is flowing through all of us. That's why you never touch a stove with a running faucet. Touching electric hot kettle and you have your hands in the water have the sink, if anything's faulty wiring you'll find out real quick⚡️
7:38 have you thought about doing it experiment upside down
Fart in a plastic bag make a wood box bury this bag fart 15 ft deep😅 they find your fart 1,500 years from now😂 young man for what purpose your fart in a wind😊
I'm a bit confused about this "participating universe" as it is represented (the U shape). I mean, wouldn't that self determination occur at every point in time from the big bang to the present ? And isn't that the whole idea behind decoherence ? Quantum superposition does disappear as interactions occur. Then how could that "present defining the past" be a thing on long scales ? Seems like what we get from that isn't far away from a continuity of time and causality we're used to. 🤔
Outside it's cold and dark and full of weird things.

Someone should go talk with Chris Langan, if you can get past the ego. I think he named bits as “telons”. He makes ups words and stuff but I think this is exactly what he’s been saying. CTMU.
Scientists make weird claims just to deny a creator
The universe is a super bootstrap paradox. Like if I take Shakespeare's literature and travel back in time, find a man named Shakespeare and give him the literature which this Shakespeare guy publishes and enjoys the consequent fame. But then the question arises where did this literature originate from? Come to think of it, it was causeless. Just like the universe. That's what my speculation is.
I believe that there is a good chance that we live in a universe that sprang into being inside an older larger universe.

How could the scientists be in a superposition from the perspective of the cat? Their observation, their existence, and nothing about them really, depends on the cat observing anything. Right?
Mate the current crop of humans are really really dumb they don't even understand the questions they ask you you are wasting your time but I appreciate your efforts ❤LV ya 😊
damn so stewie was right when he destroyed the universe to actually create it...
Oh the logical tangles you tangle in if you don't like Everett
The crucial question arising from Wheeler’s “it from bit” understanding of reality is —what exactly constitutes an observer? Wheeler’s comment about the relationship between the probe and what is being probed rather than consciousness as the origin of what is “real” suggests that any entity (including subatomic particles) can qualify as being a probe.
This kinda seems like adventure time
Maybe we should stop studying physics, as the more we are into it, the stranger the theory about the universe will become? Like it would provide answer to whatever direction of our hypothesis? What if in the past reality was simply "turtles on the way down"?
I love Physics. But not when it descends into this kind of voodoo nonsense. Experiment is set and automatic detector registers result. But person running is asleep plus he/she only speaks English and detector is made in China and was set for output in Chinese. So when physicist wakes up and reads the result he/she needs to use Google translate to read it so it enters his/her consciousness. And create reality. However the app has a bug and the translation is incorrect which is discovered a week later. So at which point reality changes?
Quantum mechanics is Murphy's Law,in a Nutshell? 🥜
******The Greatest Question of all to Ask is, Can we be Alive and Dead at the same Time . and be in  both Possible states forever.through Teleportation ? Changes Quantum Law.
******Universe Yes , God No. God had a Mommy.We are GODs,There is no GOD particle.
Event horizon of black holes act like observers collapsing entangled particles into a defined state (creating) reality
Every time you imagine the existence of something it comes into reality . The Quantum effect - This is how our creator did it . ✨🌍✨
Philosopher Alan Watts puts it much more succinctly: We see the universe not as it is but as WE are. Consciousness in the present moment is the basic reality, it plays with itself by making up stories about its own existence. The past emanates from the present the way a wake emanates from a boat-- it shows us where we've  been but does not propel us forward.
the question of whether the universe creates itself is complex and has no definitive answer. It remains a subject of ongoing scientific and philosophical inquiry.
Future subject, Free will is consciousness and its exercised like a deterministic muscle that grows with being aware of itself, while being exercised.
Interesting how he uses the term "quantum woo" immediately after talking about real science that absolutely confirms long-held spiritual and philosophical principles. The modern scientist is generally trained to constantly be seeking measurable and repeatable proof. This is such a profound limitation to genuine insight. There is absolutely actual "woo" or non-sense out there. The fact that an individual can influence their external experience of life by choosing to see differently - or by asking the right questions - is certainly not "woo." 💚🙏
Non-sensical question. Only wankers would ask it.
Subject/Object…Philosophy…Religion 😂❤😂
when you combine quantumn mechanics with the hard problem of consciousness you arrive at a very different picture of reality…
when observed we get a tiny slice of infinity, when unobserved the universe returns to infinity. it’s like the light spectrum, we are only aware of a small band of all the light in the universe.
As a scientist, really one should not be attached to an idea due to culturally imposed preferences, especially not ones in conflict with observations. It's in fact not realism that has served physics well, but intersubjectivity. On the contrary, I would argue that realism is in fact holding back the science, not only because it biases scientists and distorts their intuition, but also because the independence of the observer and the observable is basically an approximation that is valid for some simple problems, but breaks down for others, thus preventing progress in many areas if adhered to.  Realism, the unverifiable idea of an ever unobservable, unimaginable world fundamentally different from and independent of the only thing we can ever recognize as real; consciousness (in its pure form and in its modulated form; as perceptions, thoughts and sensations) is very different from intersubjectivity, the recognition of the inherent subjectivity of all (experience) and meaningful relations between individual minds that can be conceptualized by a world interacting with all those minds without being essentially different from them. I don't see any paradox or problem with the second possibility. It just means that the world and mind are essentially the same thing and an individual mind is just a tiny part of this world.  Anyway, good to hear that some efforts of theoretical understanding are moving in that direction.
The reasoning behind this is akin, or even the same as "does the tree that falls in the completely abandoned forest make a sound?" The answere depends from a point of view given by your conviction(s). To me that tree makes a rustling and then thundering sound, albeit unheard by any human observer. The idea that a phenomenon is a phenomenon WHEN it is observed... is a fallacy! Consider this, what happened before the Big Bang? No human has observed that! But webelieve there was such a before.
0 = 1 = zero is the first one. Self replication.
If the universe is megalithic with no beginning no end all these mental acrobatics would cease saving a lot of energy.Matter is self perpetuating .Everything is ultimately recycled by entropy. Infinity is incomprehensible by the hairy coconut between our ears,.nevertheless enjoy the ride of consciousness as we zip along.
The universe may or may not be creating itself, but what IS definitely happening is that the Universe is aware and trying to understand itself - by the sole fact that we humans are part of the universe. I just think that's amazing - that an entity that bursts forth from a amorphous plasma and evolves to learn about itself.
Why are you silly humans stuck on this belief that creation exists?   Do you not already understand there is no creation,  nor destruction in the universe?   What stands is EXISTENCE. As in this is WHAT IS.  Nature. The universe. Existence itself.  NOTHING does not exist.   I'm disappointed in humanity so far.  You'll wake up one day. Lose the ego first and you'll see reality.
The "20 questions" example in the intro perfectly illustrated something I've been racking my brain trying to articulate: the phenomenon of observation/measurement is generative, and always yields a "consistent history." When an observer in one frame becomes entangled with a system through observation, their frame's wavefunction collapses into a state consistent with all already-observed information. When an observer in a second frame meets the first one to compare notes, they become entangled with the first and their frame collapses into a state that preserves a consistent history with the frame of the first. We're effectively inhabiting separate spacetime worms which are constantly becoming entangled to create "objective reality," and the preservation of a consistent history by wavefunction collapse is what yields shared facts, laws of the universe, etc.
I love these mind bending topics.
All of existence could be a single blinking dot.  Think about this... A fiberoptic cable has enough bandwidth in a single phase of light to have a bi-directional transmission of a hyper realistic virtual reality stream to all your senses and stream all of your actions back to the processing system to completely fool you into thinking it's real, provided the computer was powerful enough. This means all of reality you would be experiencing would have been reduced to a single blinking light.
Probably from a consciousness perspective, that's why manifesting true positive nature is the direction of light we are all one connected
As I was watching your video, I was asking questions of GPT4 and interconnecting it with lateral thinking. And eventually it came with a set of questions that thought could potentially inspire further thinking and research in the areas of quantum mechanics, the observer information and their interconnections. Some of them, maybe obvious, others sound very very interesting. Let me know what you think.  Can we identify specific biological processes or systems where the principles of quantum mechanics play a significant role in what will be the implications of such findings for our understanding of life and consciousness?  Can we develop a unified interpretation of quantum mechanics that reconcile the role of the observer with the existence of a shared objective reality,  How might the concept of information in the observer influence the future development of AI systems, particularly in the context of artificial general intelligence, and AI ethics?  Are there any information processing mechanisms in the universe that exist independently of the observer and if so, what are the  implications of such mechanisms for our understanding of reality?  Can the principles of quantum mechanics be extended or modified to account for the microscopic phenomena and the emergence of classical behaviour from the quantum realm? ( I don’t understand that one at all !)  How did the ideas of information on the observer relate to other fundamental questions in physics, such as the nature of time, the origin of the universe in the unification of forces?  How about the ideas of information in the observer influence the development of normal techniques or scientific breakthroughs, particularly in areas, such a quantum computering communications and cryptography?
That whole “It isn’t real till we see it because the particles haven’t chosen yet...thing. Ya.. we study ancient societies, and we can assume they were real before we observed them because we see bones n dish wear. 😂
Niels Bohr is lucky that somebody observed him or else things could have been problematic.
I think we need to ban the term observer from the vernacular of theoretical physics. Two particles interacting act as a measuring system, however given what we know about QM and GR, whose to say which particle is the "observer" and which is the "observed" ? The two particles have degrees of freedom that are wave functions related to the forces of the SM, however when the interact and the wave functions collapse, there is a symmetry that prohibits a special frame as to which particle played what role. From the perspective of either particle they would be considered preferentially the "observer"but that cannot be so if there is no universal context for that moniker, just at there is no universal clock in GR. A photon that left a quasar in a galaxy shortly after the BB and traveled split pathed by a massive body like a black hole, could be "observed" by anything, a retina, a molecule in space or an atmosphere, whatever. However that delayed collapse and choice 13 billion years post ex facto doesn't necessarily make the interacting particle now the observer. Time ought not dictate causality in that way right?
Sounds a little hokey…
So the Universe is a Collective Art Project
👍❤️✨🌟
Humans love to think that observation makes reality, that it must have some order or meaning. Well, the universe owes us nothing, it's just being itself for eternity, we're a small part of it and tagging along for the ride--enjoy your meager existence while it lasts, folks.
We are the universe
This observation phenomenon will one day be proven a fallacy. It is so ridiculous to begin with and borders on the religious and things like faith. Our observation has no effect at all. Its either real or its not. No matter how much star quality your physics hero’s have, the observer is not a god… they do not change or creat things. It is akin to an optical illusion. Yours is a quantum delusion.
Bohr, boar, bore, boor
I think every possible thing is it’s own bit with it’s own yes/no answers. For example, an electron has it’s own interior “point of view” where it interacts with other particles, but all the other particles as probability waves until  it interacts with the electron (to the electron’s “point of view”). That same electron exists as a probability wave from the point of view of every other particle.
For sure noooo , come on guys we are intelligent and aware enough to understand that all this cant be create be its self
Couldn't this "It from bit" theory be in some way a proof of god existence? If we assume that there was something before conscious beings, something should have been perceiving things for them to be. I thought that maybe the conscious beings "created" the past but starting to perceive, but that also makes no sense, because how were the conscious beings developed if there was nothing before? Am I talking nonsense? I am an atheist, but I thought it was good food for thought, or maybe I misunderstood something. Awesome channel! Best of luck!
the eye absorbs light just like a black hole, me must understand ourselves if we want to understand the universe
The background music is always annoying
The Universe Is!
If you listen to "Let's Dance" by David Bowie you will gain the Christ Consciousness nessesary to understand these questions.
The flaw in the cat experiment is assuming the cat will be quiet.
The Observer Effect
Amazing. Thank you!
What still amuses me is that as we develop more and more theories and hypothesis about the nature of reality - while we even experimentally confirm some of their aspects, any buddhist, brahmanist or hinduist will nod and say "yup, quite possible. That's kind of what we suspect about it too"  I believe these guys were intuitively on to something already millennia ago, while other religions sincerely struggle with integrating scientific progress.
Funny to see how some scientist desperately try to explain the creation without God. You can't and you'll never be able to, all of us will face our Creator at the end.
Well the observer is from the Universe as part of the Universe if the universe is information then the information is the universe. In other words we are the universe experiencing itself. We are apertures through which the universe is looking at itself and perceiving itself?  It brings up ideas that we weren't put into the universe as some religions may tell us, but we are part of it. It suggests the universe itself fundamentally with or without humans is conscious itself. Able to determine its positions itself.  Experience comes into it itself, if everything was on the up how would it know up was up without a down to compare the up with. Two sides occur where they seem paradoxical but are actually mutually connected like the up without a down scenario.  Everything has two sides, even matter has its opposite the antimatter. But its the mutuality that most people don't see. Or paradoxically remains 'unseen'
For the quantum world to remain in a state of uncertainty until it is observed, would mean it must know it is being observed, which means it would have to have a conscience!? (I.e. GOD, or in scientific terms, a universal consciousness)
We can only measure the universe through our own senses. If you take the “if a tree falls in the forest, and there’s nobody around, does anybody hear it?” quandary to the extreme it becomes: If every single thing that could be considered alive and/or observing in the universe were to disappear in an instant would the universe still even exist at all? If there’s ABSOLUTELY NOTHING (no amoebas, tardigrades, even single-celled organisms; I mean NOTHING) to perceive or measure it how can we truly know it exists? From that perspective it seems almost reasonable to conclude that the universe comes into existence when I’m born and ends when I die.
All is Self
So, I'm more convinced than ever that every potential outcome that has EVER occurred exists at the same time
I never really understood this Schrödinger cat thing. Of course the cat is either dead or alive independently. If alive the cat will signal his presence, if dead it will change state (rot). Buh… I’m too stupid
What if black holes are a way for whatever made this universe to record the information to see if they can learn more about there universe.
Fabulous. This is Esoteric Buddhism. The mind creates both the observer and the subject. ❤️🙏

Idk, a math and physics course in the form of a playlist would be nice to actually better understands the things you talk about. Start with high school maths and physics, one video a week, a few years down the line we could be all the way the way to high level astrophysics.
Great series Matt! How can there be an observer, an observed, and the relationship between them, without them in some sense already being real? At the level of mathematics, we can invent/describe any 'physical' entity and interaction, and while we are manipulating the logical symbols of theory, reality is imbued with infinite degrees of potential magic, but for those which happen to correspond with what is 'out there' the magic becomes transformed into a concrete description of a real (or 'more real') reality. The point is: there is nothing inherent in the mathematical symbols which hints at this 'reality producing' aspect of physics; that is established only by experimentation and a lot of empirical curve fitting etc. Don't know if I'm getting my point across - maybe it's to say that mathematical meaning and physical meaning are two completely different things, and we may be confusing them in QM.
With the consciousness stuff taken out, and our observed "position" in the quantum universe being given a dash of the Copernican principle, doesn't that immediately fold back into a fairly straightforward form of the many worlds interpretation?
these animated figures really diminish the high standards of this format
If God is  Itself . Means no one creates God. . Then universe can be itself . No creaters of universe .
For programmers, 'lazy evaluation'.
well, it’s been 9 months.
When consciously observed.
In short, to label something is to limit it.
Sorry Archibald Wheeler > but taking humans out of the equation altogether does not infer that the Universe does not exist just because we're not around to observe it. Otherwise the Christians would be correct in that the Earth is only 6000-10000 years old (observable time span of modern humans).
I think your definitions needs to be refined/updated. Universe/Cosmos: the known space we live in starting with the big bang, and has a definite edge. Void: the infinite place the universe/cosmos is expanding into.
I think Niels Bohr's statement can be applied to say "Time is not real unless it is observed".
I'm confused.
This is really cool to think about. How does our universe act rationally then? We make a decision, i.e. to move a chair from one side of the table to the other, and countless quantum field interactions have to happen along the way. But ultimately, whether there were x or y photons encountered by the chair across the way, the result is fairly rational. It's like there is some kind of reverse emergence going on. In emergence, little seemingly unrelated interactions add up to larger phenomenon. But here, the large phenomenon remains, despite changing smaller interactions.
this is a great way to believe in science
So what happens in a world pre-observers? Lets say planet earth in times of algae and bacteria? Do they observe? Did world come to existence as we know it when the first organic being gained conciousness and observed? I mean, reality may have existed as a flux of energy and chunks of it interacting in various ways but not as a physical or sensible pheonomena. Makes me wonder about conciousness and its evolution from a flux of energy in the quantum field and wonder if observation and perception of reality is just a new way of interaction among energy fields.
...Probably, 🤣
4:35 The soundtrack here gives me Twin Peaks vibes... how appropriate! 😄
I love how you explain Schrodinger's Cat and how ridiculous it is - I tried explaining these points a few months ago to someone and they simply couldn't understand how the thought experiment doesn't work in real life. Funny how deepening our education helps us see the world in a different light.

Excellent video
can we find light that existed from the point of the the creation of the universe?
All of this to try to avoid the ovious solution. GD creates the multiverse on a perpetual basis through willful observation from an external vantage point. The observer is not internal but external.
3:50 Feynman's expression is not quite accurately interpreted: "shut up and count," in fact means: shut up and listen to the answers. Natural philosophers had their own answers to "their own non-questions", scientists have answers to their questions, and no one has subscribed to the nature channel yet. Well, the universe is patiently waiting to watch its broadcasts and comment on them (from those who have the syndrome of the strong anthropic principle remained in the infantile past). Enjoy watching!
Amanda Gefters book “Tresspassing in Einstein’s Lawn” covers this whole topic, and Wheeler’s contributions to it in a lot of depth. It’s an amazing and lovely book.
So the idea that we're in the matrix with simulation bugs being stuff like those weird instances of losing something is just quantum mechanics?
Interesting in that simplicity can be made complicated.  A problem with your philosophy it appears.
english please
If there is fundamental wave function collapse and observation of reality is a wave it will collapse if no fundamental observer is observing reality.

Why do we think we can equate the way particles behave to the way the entire universe behaves? We can do the delayed choice experiment with particles, but it wouldn't work the same with something larger.
I want to know more about Time Crystals and qubits.  How did google make a Time Crystal? And what exactly was revealed?  Also, did the Time Crystal create another Time Crystal?  What does that mean?
The universe is a pantser!!!! I KNEW IT
Cant understand this guy. Hire someone that speaks ENGLISH.
i'm no physicist, but couldn't it be possible that we aren't actually sending a "single photon"? and we just think we are cause our technology to measure them is limited?
if i put a cat in an airtight box for a month i dont need to obseve the cat to know what state its in..
As a non-physicist computer enthusiast, all these things like "it from bit", relativity, etc., just give more and more evidence to our universe being a simulation.  It all just sounds like a bunch of "cheating" to lower the processing power of the universal simulation.
Professor is too smart for me to keep up with him.  I am not good at physics or math or quantum physics. I am not on his level.
Okay THIS time I’ll understand
I'd love to see more videos on White Holes being created by black holes rebounding.
Nonsense, the past happened. I was there.
Reminds me a lot of the concept of non-dualism. Maybe subject and object are not as distinguishable as we think.
In some ways, doesn’t this theory bake teleology into every part of existence?
It is both the theory that I believed the least when I first heard it and the theory I most believe in currently.
It was David Mermin that said "Shut up and calculate", not Feynman.
no more than the front creates the back and vice-versa i hypothesize.
Quantum mechanics seems dumb; why would our observation determine reality? "Reality" was here before us, obviously existing and not also "not existing" just because we weren't there to observe it
Interstellar makes so much sense now lmao
What you’re describing is MOST common knowledge in the world of comic books: the universe is capable of Retconning unnoticed. The answers to the questions asked may have only been written AS the questions were asked, but in a way in which they were always consistent with the already existing “lore” and the present. Until that particular question was asked, all possible outcomes HAD to exist in the “head cannon” of the universe. This is made slightly more complicated by the fact that the universe in this case is asking itself “questions,” but the analogy is pretty sound in my estimation.
When I was a much younger person, I had a magic mushroom-fueled epiphany that if one was to come to understand the true nature of all 'creation' (remain calm, I'm using that word generically), everything would cease to exist. I still believe it, 40 years later.
I love watching videos that are outdated. Universe was proven not to be locally real this year
i wish
I understand that any particle is the event created by a collapse of quantum wave. This collapse is a result of the interaction between two or more quantum waves, for example the wave of a photon and the wave of a particle in a detector. After the collapse, a new quantum wave is created at the location of the event. This means that we create the reality by an act of observation which also creates a new yet unobserved state of the reality.
It's like lazy loading in programming
8:00 How could you verify the quantum entanglement of two particles that are on opposite sides of the galaxy?
How an observer is exactly defined in Quantum Mechanics ?.
The universe comes into being by "observing itself." This is how "quantum" becomes "classical" and how "non-local" turns into "local."
God exists. Just sayin
how do we know for certain that two entangled particles actually share their "info" at an infinite distance? could there be a possible limit? obviously we can't fly a particle to another galaxy to test.
So cosmic horizon hawking radiation is literally one photon per universe? The longest radio wave of all time?
This programme is keeping me awake, lol. I can't believe a better physicist to illustrate these concepts. This man is up there with Lenny Susskind. He doesn't care for the BS but does care physics is understood.
I mean this is probably the best YouTube channel in our universe for people who love questions and want to imagine.  Thank you PBS for making me a better student and for sharing all your passion for physics with the world.  I honestly don't know if this message will ever be found by anyone in a universe of information that may or may not be partially created by our observation.  Again thanks for inspiring me.  P.S. As I stare at the universe, the universe stares at me. I don't know if this phrase means anything but I like how it sounds!
I believe more and more each day that we live in a simulation.
There is no discernible difference between creation and first discovery.
The crucial definition of Observation, that everything else hangs on, only gets an off-hand remark at 12:08 but even this is more than what most other content on the topic provides.
when you observe something, you think about it and your thoughts are electrical impulses which create mag. fields which go into the infinity and/or mix with other mag. fields. thats why you influence by observing. Since the brain fires the same pathways when its imagining and looking, you could also say that we also must have an effect of the dreamer (;
The Beginning of the Universe is like the End-- Irrational. This means it can be caused by reason, but will immediately assume it wasn't. There can be many, many irrational points and they will define other spaces more easily than be defined themselves. Therefore, the Universe can have a beginning, and an end, and they are defined, yet are more likely "form" and not hard edges. Fun! I enjoy your videos, PBS.
this creates a paradox though doesn't it? if the universe is defining itself based on the questions an observer (us) asks of it, then that assumes that we (observers) had to exist first in order for the universe to be able to exist, or at least be what it is.
The mass of the entire universe in a black hole producing the size equal to our cosmological event horizon was such a cliffhanger. Please elaborate on this next time.
The universe does not exist without our observation. If we are not here. There is no point for creating if there is no observers and interacters
U can't explain reality before reality exist, that is before even the word before meaningless, that's beyond the science, unobservable, unrationable
Actually,  the universe can itself be thought of as being alive as well as conscious.  The universe is conscious. And I'm not trying to be all woo woo about it either. Think about it, during it's evolution the universe created life which is a part of itself contrary to how many of us may think and this life continues to evolve until it had the ability to sense itself through us and our senses. Since we're just a part of the universe and we're also created by the universe we can say the universe is capable of self-awareness which to me sounds a lot like consciousness.
NOPE
Once the impossible has been eliminated, what remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
*Ok, Doc,* I loved math class all my life. For the most part, anyway...  But I  stopped this kind of math after some business calculus and the like for my BS degree (🤣). So I follow pretty well when you show various equations, functions and matrices...usually.   But you made me start thinking, which is unusual (on my end, not yours). And this is where I landed:  Anthropic or not, I find Wheeler's Participatory Universe fairly satisfying. Yet it leaves me wondering:   *Wouldn't The Maths have multiple solutions, similar to the two roots of a quadratic equation; and each of which would be self-consistent with its respective own existence, as well as with every observation made by its respective observers?*  And wouldn't this necessarily imply the existence of at least one alternate universe; perhaps one which could satisfactorily answer some of the questions regarding all of the "missing matter" shortly after our universe began to expand and to cool?  Thanks.  Great episode, btw. I usually play  20 Questions that way, but only because I always forget wth I was describing...lol  Or did I eat one gummy too many? 😀
0:01  *Yessir! Happens all the time!!*   ☹🤔😠     🤣🤣🤣
I think I'm like wheeler in the sense that I think all of reality stems and spawns from the root of a single question and its antithesis. Do things exist? Do things not exist? The first question doesn't do anything besides immediately elicit the second. The second question creates the universe because, in order for something to not exist or have the capability of not existing, something would have to exist. I know that sounds simple and like a cop-out but when it comes to quantum physics, that's exactly the kind of relationship super positioning has with determinism.
It is as if we ask the Universe a Question and it only just then thinks of the answer. I wonder if we ever will find the smallest of all particles or if the universe will give us smaller and smaller things until we stop searching...
Question about the Delayed Choice Experiment:  what if the sense of one event happening after the other isn’t happening the way we think; could the photon be spreading out in the time direction, as well as in space?
Professing to be wise they became fools- all atheists
If something only is if observed then that’s proof enough the life exists in the universe  U idiots
So until we had telescopes … the universe didn’t exist   Stupid theory   Let’s all say that trees don’t make sounds when they fall in a forest with no one around
Wow - this is the danger of tenured academics - how much did this drivel cost to work out and what could have been achieved if actual 'physics' was done. I think Feynman surpassed his old teacher! At least, Einstein was honest about not having an answer.
Okay so im pretty high right now so i dont know if this is a very stupid question or not but here it goes: What if you put a piece of dynamite inside a box, the dynamite explodes if a radioactive particle decays (im pretty sure they have a 50/50 chance of decaying within some time frame?). Now how would that work out? would the dynamite go into a superposition where it woulldnt blow up untill you opened the box? Cause it needs to obsverved to be defined right? let me know if that made any sense .
Holdon so the universe is sooo chatoic and unpredictable, is artificial carbon life made to observe it so it can make a choices on how its going to operate. If quantom physics is super real then my idea doesnt sound to crazy. Its like having friend that cant decide what they want to eat. Then you come along and suggest to them a pizza. Thats planting the idea into your friend making him have 99% probability that he will choose the pizza.
hmmm....
I honestly think there are some things we will simply never know. And perhaps the true nature of reality and why anything exists at all... could be in that category.
Roger Penrose says that Quantum Mechanics is (at least) INCORRECT if not wrong
This reads like a scientist living his own Lovecraftian horror story. Knowledge so unknowable that one begins to go insane from a sudden intuitive understanding that they can't put into words because the words don't exist. But the fright and despair in the eyes of the afflicted is so intense that you can only shudder at the thought of such a horrifying realization
Man, I love your channel.... your explanations are formulated so well... and the content it so interesting.  Thank you for all of it.  You're doing God's work... scientifically speaking.... and creatively as well.  Much respect!
Confirmed: the universe is a simulation.
Ahh yes… the most existential version of the “if the tree falls” paradox
meta question. Can science actually serve society if humans are subject to 'dark energy' influence. example. FLUORINE is an element with known properties. ie real. Yet 'smart' people see themselves as distinct and thus easily manipulated by political endeavour.  So we have this paradox. The academy of sciences is a long distinguished and august body. Their observations of fluorine and compounds of, is extremely likely to be an apt description of real world interaction. Yet . esp in America. 'Smart' people stand opposed to this consistent informational complex. Ignaz Sammelwiess showed that handwashing could save lives, yet he was banished to the fringes of respectable science, tragically he had to watch many mothers die, because science itself could not accept the observational reality - even if lacking an understood cause at the time. (germ theory was not quite complete) so. So here we are, the paradox. The best of science and absurd policies in conflict with observational reality.  another prob for humans. Risk to Benefit. 1 in one million is a small number. and yet its not zero. we are ... conflicted little beasts.
nonduality nor emptiness is what quantum physics trying to say, if one understands that there is nothing to understand is the ultimatum
This completely boggles my mind every time I think about it. I also question how someone elses choices and questions could affect change to my reality or vice versa. Then, the randomness of superpositions and quantum states becomes exponentially more complicated. It then begs the question, is every possible outcome of every moment of time all playing out simultaneously, only to be determined at the moment of measurement or observation? THIS FKIN MELTS MY BRAIN EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT IT. UGGH HELP.
This doesn't make sense... if you were to decide on a pattern, then you would have to have a result of that pattern in the first place! And if it was entirely 'random' then you would never arrive at a result, because the result would be entirely "random..." therefore chaos!
So, Wheeler, Buddhism, Hinduism et al = We are G'd?
Yes, the atheistic-leaning Bohr vs the theistic Einstein.  The latter has proven far more reliable and more contribuative to society by far.  And theist Schoedinger also used the cat to illustrate the ridiculousness of Bohr's purely imaginary Multiverse.
The mind expanded reality. Reality does not expand.
I Imagine the Universe (reality) like a silent, impartial, cooperative witness, that answers all questions with no hesitations, but stays absolutely silent if not questioned, almost like inexistent. Like the connection between 0’s and 1’s, that give’s sense and meaning to each other, and only “exist” because of each other: if I know 1, I also know 0, if I don’t know 1, I also don’t know 0, just like Schrodinger’s cat! What if consciousness is the fundamental construction block of Reality? What if there’s no reality without consciousness? What if reality exists always and forever in a state of “inexistence”, until consciousness brings it to its natural state? Ok, im having a short-circuit… reality is weirdly mysterious, it exists but we can’t explain it, but if would not be conscientious of it, it simply wouldn’t exist, because if loose my conscience, everything will cease to exist, including myself.
I’ve thought this way ever since I read thomas aquinas’ argument for god’s existence from creation and also took a quantum mechanics course
I think we are forgetting the important influence of time. It may be that even as we observe them, quantum partocles are still in that superposition but our minds must perceive it as being in a certain state and that includes any observations we make. Why must we perceive it in a certain state? Well, because as three dimensional beings, we are only able to perceive one time line. We must have a determined line of events which means the universe must be in a certain state.  This would resolve the debate I think. To give the example of schrodinger, the cat  really is defined  when observed because the observer cannot see both timelines simultaneously as the observer is not 4 dimensional. And no, just because e appear to be moving forwards in tine and remember things doesn't mean we are 4 dimensional. We experience time as a series of present moments and store the configurations of those moments as memory.
This notion that observers play some kind of role in the creation of the universe makes the same mistake that other cosmological theories make: they attribute phenomena from within spacetime as likewise explanatory for the emergence of the universe from outside of spacetime. The problem is that without either space or time this idea that observers can persuade nothingness to give up anything like a universe is folly. Even if the regime “before” the big bang is more like a quantum vacuum with both space and time what evidence is there that observers can do anything more than the collapse of the wave function and the emergence of of virtual particles which quickly vanish. Neither do I believe observations can affect anything in the remote past like the creation of the universe.
so there was nothing in hubbles deep field until hubble looked. extrapolation, back in the day the earth was in fact flat, eh?
I've watched this video several times, and the best I can come away with is:  "if a tree falls down in the woods, and there is no one there to hear it, does it make a sound".  Love these vids, keep up the excellent work Matt.
Would the universe be lonely if we never came into being and it had no one to play games with?
It is true universe creates itself, what is truly amazing things are happening right before our eyes and we don’t see it how that happens. What exactly is interfering to be possible for us to see and understand how universe creates itself, for long periods of time I wasn’t able to put dots together to explain the whole picture. Today truly you will understand how universe building all the wonders visible to us and up to point we still don’t know how it works. To begin with I have to start with most famous experiment up to date twin slit experiment, what is the mechanism of beyond secrets of multiple lines. You will understand why is so difficult to see how space produces energy, if I tell you it is lot easier than you will think you may get upset, however I’m saying the truth. Some scientists think and they demonstrated water concept, like wave creates ripple effects, okay I will buy that moreover if space had no dark energy you could shoot millions upon millions of particles you never could had any effects at all, have you guys thought of that? Now here is the sizzle and steak, I explained you how the shell of subatomic particles has ability absorb energy from space, the same way electrons does, it absorbs energy as much as it can, to it comparable strength the rest it just releases back, when that happens it actually forms another electron subatomic particles and electrons help to create new electrons the one eventually becomes subatomic particles. Now back to twin slit experiment when someone shoots particles through twin slit. From the machine to the board the one has double slit expanded particles it able to collect enough energy to create particles while it traveling to the board of twin slit. With is own force that particle pulls rest of new born particles with it towards the board by inertia. You may say okay how can you explain observer cannot see any of it? Will my friends, here is truly what makes so difficult to capture dark matters, any energy is stronger then electrons energy it immediately stops electrons absorbing energy from dark matters, obviously observer used tools to observe particles from tool, it stops particles to collect energy from dark matters, the moment tool is activated it the activate the space it self, think about this why we cannot run high voltage cables with low voltage because higher voltage interferes with low voltage energy, is that simple, for the space is not any different specially energy from space is the weakest. Even us as human beings when we are culm and resting we actually allow energy from space to be absorbed by our body the one helps us to regulate energy through out our body. I will strongly recommend you to build machines the one will have zero effects on the surrounding space, then I will guarantee 1000% you will see how space supplies the energy and builds everything visible to us. Now back to the back board with multiple lines on it, depend how much particles are expands, that will dictate how far a part they can land from each other, even though it has nothing to do with waves they do have similarities. There are two things can force the particles to expand heat not to far from nucleus and pressure it can travel farther away from nucleus itself.
Imagine a game of negative 20 questions where answers are random - is it a horse? No. Is it a horse? Yes.
I have a question. If observer doesn't need to be conscious to collapse the wave, why a barrier with slits cannot be considered as observer?
Show us the math for quantum entanglement and superposition please. I won't understand it, but I still would like to see it.
Does the universe create itself? Are diseases uncaused? If you believe that events have no causes, you can throw all of science in the garbage. Does the universe create itself? NOPE.
Imagine your eyes are as black holes.....your memories are the event horizon.
You mention the big bang however this is six months old and the new James Webb telescope has found proof that galaxies where around before the suppose big bang. Or at least I think it has. If so then did the big bang happen or do we have to look at things differently?
I believe there is no such thing as "the worst practicioners of quantum woo" simply because we haven't been able to prove or disprove. Being scientically minded is less about being rigid but more about having an open mind!
What I take from this is that we know very little and are relying on wild speculations of physists detached from other fields of knowledge, like evolution, geology, etc.
We are what was shat out a white hole
Wheeler got the information mechanics ideas from Fred Kanter (guy who wrote Information Mechanics) who audited Wheeler's class at Columbia in 1983. Wheeler was very arrogant and pretended he didn't understand Fred.
Sounds like if it “exists” its because its been observed or measured in some form in some time.  Also sounds like dark matter has something to do with this, if we observe dark matter in the present instead of the past, what would happen…?
The Copenhagen Interpretation is b.s.  Niels Bohr is Bohring!
No. No it doesn’t.
Let's get this to 1 million views family!
But does that mean that anything is possible? And I mean anything...Appears not...so therefor that can't be so, or can it?
Why the irritating distracting background music?  Wouldn't expect it in a physics lecture. Why's it here? What's the difference between an event & an observation? If an amonite gets fossilised 500m yrs ago. Does it not exist until someone cracks open the stone to view it? Define observation  What if an ape observes it?  What if an ant observes it ? This philosophical quagmire is due to exaggeration of the word observe. Observing is nothing more than events
to me it kinda makes sense that the observable universe mass would lead to an event horizon the same as if it were a black hole. so due to relativity it kinda already is? so we're at the singularity due to relativity?
I was thinking all those particles that we can’t interact are created when we trying to find it
In my opinion it's not complicated, although I think we have a profound effect on the energy in this universe as living beings, we only have five senses so our interpretations are the only ways we can see them if a particle is in a fourth dimension we can't see that and we can't see it with our equipment because we're looking through our eyes building the equipment.. dark matter dark energy, it's probably not as dark as we think we just can't build a fourth dimension telescope, I personally think this is the reason why imaginary numbers are a foundation in physics because that represents the underlying dimensions they're not so much built on the three dimensions we experience but they underlie that and support the position where those dimensions that we can perceive are r entangled and that's why the universe doesn't just fly apart LOL but our perception of it is extremely limited
U
Quantum Mechanics & Quantum Field Theory traffic in *what we know* about a system rather than what is going on inside that system. Probabilities of scenarios occurring until we actually witness the outcome. Collapse occurring at the moment of observation because the energy needed to observe these events is so comparable to the energy of the events themselves that it actually disturbs them.  It’s pretty obvious that the cat inside the box is “both alive and dead” until we actually observe the outcome of the random event: it’s like trying to predict a coin-toss ahead of the event. As for entanglement, it’s just the QFT’s formalism for expressing non locality, just as wormholes are General Relativity’s manner of expressing the same concept. That’s probably why in certain contrived scenarios (AdS/CFT) these two notions can be made to coincide. Again, not entirely surprising, in retrospect — once one embraces the entirely counterintuitive notion that the laws of nature are somehow fundamentally nonlocal (or said another way: that information is concentrated in the locale of the objects it describes, but somehow is partially ‘stored’ also elsewhere).
Ah yes, anyone who doesn't go for the Copenhagen Interpretation is "desperately clinging".  This channel is just as responsible for dumbing people down as it educating them. Shame on you and whoever else is responsible for what this channel has become since you came along.
The expansion of the universe creates time?
Interesting that John Archibald Wheeler discovered Buddhism about 2500 years after the Buddha did.
The god-machine created the matrix. This is known.
To create itself it has to be and not be at the same time.....not possible.
"Negative Twenty Questions" reminds me of the german game "Ein  solches Ding", translating to "such a thing", in which people in turn play description cards, but once someone plays a card and the following player doubts that "such a thing" exists, they can request that the person describe them "such a thing" which then leads to one of the two winning the round.
In keeping with Occum's Razor, the obvious conclusion is that this whole thing is merely a simulation.  The future (on whatever scale you choose) only exists as the inputs are generated from the simulation as it unfolds.  It actually very handily explains most of this.  "Many Worlds" are only possibilities (like the state of the cat) until the previous data from the simulation are incorporated into the unfolding present.  Plato was actually on to something 3000 years ago.  Maybe 42 really is the answer.
What if I ask the participatory universe ¿Is it traveling faster than light? ¿Is it smaller than the plank length? or If I ask ¿Is it smaller than a dog? and if the answer is yes, then ask ¿Is it bigger than an elephant? It has to answer me "No", and If I know what the answer will be, that means, reality was not defined by my question right?
what happens to the quantum soup when the universe reaches cold death exapnsion, when there is no energy left to interact with it?
No.
So a rational  case can be made that the Universe is in the eye of the beholder or mind not matter, yet as the presenter said, that isn't true. Is it not true because you don't want to believe it or does the math rule it out more than "in"?
very similar to many mystical traditions explanation of reality, as well as some creation stories (like The Supernal's in Kabbalah)
Physicists shouldn’t get lost in philosophical or metaphysical crap like this. Its all an illusion anyway and makes no sense to the average human being. We definitely can measure things in real life and it makes no difference whether we see the 6 foot snake or not. Its still 6 feet long. Completely impractical gibberish. I’ve read it, watched it, listened to it and it has no bearing on real, everyday existence.
The universe creates itself, we‘re just lucky to be the ones who observe it. If another universe was creted 2 hours ago and nobody see it happen, it just simply didn‘t happen.
This comes off like, "if a tree falls in the woods..." on a grand/micro-quantum scale
Someone had a good 04/20...
for us to question of the universe is self creating, then we also must preassume that itself actualize its first particle. the function doesn't coexist.
If the question and the answer are known at the same time the universe will collapse in on itself and create even more unfathomable questions and answers.
Brilliant can something come from nothing...and lastly what constitutes an observation. in the case of the cat...when someone opens the box ..it will stink since no one gave the poor cat food and water.
Hahahaa what a childish question but i will teach you... Just listing. There is this name called Almighty GOD hahahaha the creator, the one who exist behind the beginning, the maker of the entire universe and no matter how big the universe is, i can even say the universe doesn't have an edge (end).. But is in the hands of GOD the creator, the great Lion of Judah, the elsha die, the most lovely, Holy and good GOD.. The one who died for the sake of his creator ohh what manner of man is JUSUS the life giver the sustainer, the creator.. Now think that this world is this big , then how would Heaven GOD's kingdom be ? Is time you beg GOD for forgiveness and worship him🙏
So, in the game Reverse 20 questions, suppose that player 1 (the person who answers the questions) assumes the rule that they will answer 'yes' or 'no' to the questions alternatively, regardless of what the questions are. Then suppose that player 2 (the person asking questions) asks the following question: "Is it larger than a basketball?" Player 1 answers "Yes". Players 2 asks, "Can its shape and size change?" Player 1 answers "No". Suppose that player 2 then asks, "Is it smaller than a baseball?" If player 1 answers "yes", then there is a contradiction between the first and third question. How can something be both larger than a basketball and smaller than a baseball, especially because it cannot change its shape and size?  So, my question, to whoever wishes to explore it, is basically this: what happens in the game reverse 20 questions if it a produces a contradiction such as the one above, and how does this apply in the context of quantum mechanics?  Edit: I'm aware that, realistically, player 2 wouldn't ask the third question knowing the information derived from the first, but I'm just curious how this would pan out in the context of quantum mechanics.
One interesting thing I'd like to note is that this seems to map precisely onto a similar question in mathematics: Are we creating new mathematics, or are we discovering already existing maths?   The answer seems to be roughly similar, too.
Course it did
Not gonna lie. I feel really ignorant right now. Didn't understand half of what he was explaining in this so I went to the comments hoping to find a little clarity. Yep... That didn't happen.
Thanks to PBS for all the high quality super educational videos. One of the best channels of YouTube.
This seems kinda focused on a temporal view. If the idea should explain the existence of time, then it should be independent of time. There should be some way of explaining the idea without time
No masters no Gods
If true this means the universe will ultimately destroy itself as well. Even if only because  I just said so.
We are all the cat and the universe is the box ...
Y. ✨🤸🏻‍♀️❤️‍🔥🤸🏻‍♀️❤️‍🔥👽👽👽👽🛸
What the- ? 👀😳
Yes. Existence itself absolutely does create itself. That's not even sophomore-level sophistry, stop asking this to stuff an advertising pipe with empty content. The question before us, on relation to Primum Movens, has never been "Does it," or, "How," but WHAT NOW?
I have this silly almost certainly sci-fi idea that LIFE creates the universe(s). Life is constantly trying to swim up that river of entropy. Perhaps in that quest we (life) eventually become intelligent enough to recreate these expansive stages our known reality takes place on; universes.  It's an outlandish idea, but who knows 🤷‍♂️
The universe was already here 13.8 billion years ago. Any attempt to put some sort of timestamp on the universe is simply an exercise in religion. The only question to be answered is what event happened in the already existing, static universe. The answer to that question is easy because there is only one way our universe could have created what we see. Our universe simply turned itself into a massive particle collider with two, already existing objects. Quark plasma is what the galaxies were made of. It is the most efficient reaction in the universe. The galaxies have cooled ever since.
This sounds minds more and more like a Simulation, where the information is only created as needed.
Occam's razor answer is blackholes are invoked some how BUT THEN were did first blackhole come from it never ends
Has anyone read Arthur Schopenhauer? (A legit philosopher taught in modern philosophy classes, not some crazy guy... Tho those aren't mutually exclusive...)  Anyways, I ask because his idea of an unconscious universal "Will" accidentally making humans/conscious inhabitants as a mechanism for self-perception is weirdly aligned with this. (And no, before anyone accuses me of Theology, the "Will" that Schopenhauer proposes is unconscious and somewhat random, not a deity. Indeed, it may be better to use a different term to describe it, but alas).  Also, it's been over a decade since I got my philosophy degree; so someone correct me if I am having the dumb.
Imagine a universe in which there are no observers at all.
I love this channel and you. Keep making more videos forever until heat death.
Wheeler's "negative 20 questions" is perfectly same as multiverse idea, we would just always be in the one universe that is consistent with our questions by definition.
Just like solving the Rubik's Cube. To solve it reliably fast one must follow a step by step method that reduce the space of possibilities - essentially ask 20 questions.
Is it possible that the expansion is something more simple like the substance of our universe rushing out to fill the space it's in?   If so would that have anything to do with false vacuum collapse?
El Universo es energía y como energía, no se crea ni se destruye, se transforma en otras fuentes de energía constantemente.
holographic universe
Well, if the alien spaceships are wirelessly connected to thoughts to move them, then maybe consciousness itself is a material field in the universe related to electricity.

it would be interesting to try and explain how the I Ching or Tarot coincidences could fit in this participatory universe
Because we see something , does it mean that it’s real ,
Scientists have the darnedest ways of saying "I don't know".
The information is there we are just finding it so are we really intelligent or just aware.
I've loved the statement by Carl Sagan:  We are a way the universe can know itself.
If the universe has to be observed to exist then it must be being observed by the creator of this matrix/simulation - God.
This right here is always on my mind, but having Matt discuss it makes me think of a more psicological question. Concsiousness derives from an emergent property of quantum interactions(the observer). But does it have to be a relationship between more than only one observer(observer on observer) to shape reality?. Does estatistics work with only one observer?. So, if we talk about bits it´s inherent binary nature needs a code and an error control or checksum to exist. Now that would appear to be a talk about deity, but no, it´s more a question of which part is played by whom or what. So concsiousness comes from a seemingly infinitely complex system to statisticaly arrive at a simplistic most likely binary system to be able to exist.
sorry for my typing is auto correcting  thanks pbs space time
hi I am not a scientist I know tings about dark matter but I got my own  theory and I'm happy to share it my theory is copy rite free it is a photon is the opposite of a dark photon a photon particle interacts with matter and its waves dos not and it has Wight a dark photon its parodical dos not interact with matter its has no wight and its waves dos interact with matter like a small gravitational wave gravity is a kind of o force or wave that interacts with matter  naw this is an answer my question is where dos space creation energy coms from on earth gravity photos is weak but in space is strong some haw it works in space like its energy given to gravity energy my answer is space is a vacuum and Wight less for 2 dark photons to spin faster that creates holo electrons that gives it energy also my theory or cold it be as simple as just a movement that the dark photon dos not do on earth that make it energetic pleas if Joe know the answer tell it on a video if Joe don't know the answer that's fine to I know it takes time to find dark matter and energy haw it works not discovered I still think of dark photons as the opposite of photons thanks pas space time you might find this theory handy yore aloud to use it

So, if somebody other than Einstein had asked questions other than those that led to Relativity etc., might the Universe have so constructed itself as to allow FTL travel and so forth?  Did we screw ourselves out of traveling the Universe, by asking the wrong questions and arriving at a physics that says "it can't be done"?
Fascinating video, with an excellent speaker I might add. Bravo!!! I can’t help but chuckle a little to myself while watching these. I understand that many of these scientists have devoted their entire lives in the search of knowledge. But alas- it appears that some things are simply “hidden” from our understanding. It seems that the more we (presume) to know, the more muddied it all becomes. Dark matter? Dark energy? Inventions to make the equations work is more probable. I hear these words in my mind and smile…”vanity of vanities- ALL is vanity!!!”
The question all comes down to symbiosis over predation.
Similar to to dog’s head is defined by dog’s tail - universe gets its meaning from an observer like us!!
Really everything I see posted by this chap is excellent - well explained, balanced, factual. Helping describe what is knowable and not shying away from what we don't know (and, importatly, not letting spooky mysticism into the places we don't know).  Thank you.  I have a question relating to Rovelli's work. Having read Rovelli's stuff on quantum gravity, I am forming a picture of the univers where time doesn't exist as we think of it, a flowing stream, but rather stuff happens in a causal list [ a bit like list view on your phone diary, when there is no event, there is nothing happening, and time isn't flowing - it's just there is so much change going on in the universe that we as obeservers form the illusion of a flowing substrate of time].  I was thinking how well this matches up to Wheeler's view if you say it this way round. Stuff is happening so frequently that it gives the illusion of time passing to anything that can interact with it (all the other stuff in the universe)  and the only things that can interact with it is part of the universe.  It really does play havock with your thinking though when you label any set of these collective interactions as "concious". We are comfortable drawing a boudary called conciousness around our human experience, our inner monologue telling us where we are now inrelation to our memory of what has passed before. I am not even going to ask the next question ...

observation has no bearing on existence or reality, only on how we interpret it, or we wouldn't even be here to observe anything
Not to steal anyones thunder. But i did finally give out my explanation for an eternally cyclic universe. Where big bangs happen from and why. How they happen. Its a simple explanation. Just so people can imagine without the stresses of math. N. I saved that for 4 years. I cant keep everything inside anymore. So.
Beautiful episode. Been following this channel for years and it made me understand things in ways i never thought possible and opened allot of thought processes i never even dreamed of. Thank you for these PBSspacetime.
I had this theory a while ago.  I called it the "Adaptive Universe"  There were no Galaxies before Hubble saw them.  Then Hubble saw them so they now exist.    The universe adapts to what we are observing but it has to be consistent with all past observations.
This idea makes perfect sense to me. It seems like the same type of situation as general relativity. Without two different frames of reference interacting with each other, there can't be many judgements about what the "facts" of a given situation are. Am I stationary or moving at a constant velocity? Etc. Its all a little fuzzy and basically kind of meaningless unless there's another situation you can use for comparison. "Relative to what" is where the real action is. The fact that you can compare the two is what allows you to establish facts about either situation.  The "observer" thing is often misinterpreted, but I do think that its very reasonable to suggest that reality is relational, not objective. The facts about the world are established as a consquence of interactions between things, not by the things themselves. You might even say that there's no such things as "things themselves", its just relationships between things all the way down.
I have to say I found this boring. What exactly is the question and why do we ask it? Introduce a bit of psychology don’t be so compartmentalised.
I am dumb af so I am pulling this out of nowhere heh... but what about color and light and observation.... sure a color has a freq but we all interpret the color differently and idk if shadows matter with color freq but I was imagining the dress thing from a while back.... also what if the tesseract is simply imagination and mind mapping, memories, tripping, dreams, and imagination for our understanding?
It doesn't matter if you look there is no OCR as Einstein said. He won. The Two slit experiment was done with light at 2 holes but without observers. They set up and started the experiment and left the room for two hours... came back shut it down  and looked at the detection screen. According to Bohr without observers the result was supposed to switch to the wave distribution but... with light... and no observers it stayed at the particle...
Wtf
It's also kind of an artificial seperation which is more of an illusion than a reality to conceptually seperate yourself from the rest of the universe when you're a part of the flow of events the motion of reality. If you were truly detached then maybe it would be possible to perfectly measure information without affecting it and with no uncertainty although I don't have any concept of how that would actually work. But you're not you're part of the system you're observing exactly in accordance with the saying that we are the universe made aware of itself. The ego is a reality in as much as our own self existences are facts we confront within the narratives we've constructed to interpret the information we receive from around us but in a sense our egos are an illusion there is no self we are one with the rest of existence and the seperation is only an artificial conceptual one. Even though it is simultaneously reflective of a real observed difference between self and other if it wasn't then the mindset of being an individual would never have appeared. But also in the process of our further development transformations in the nature of our existence will eventually abolish that model for comprehending existing and reality will be perceived differently. As will our relationships with one another in as much as they can be said to still exist in altered forms but if they do its likely concepts of difference and seperation will also persist although all of this in altered structure. But what can be said to be a true valid narrative later can also be said to apply now future perspectives may be latent and not yet manifest but the potential for their appearance exists and so they can be embraced today with enough insight even before the actual transformations which make possible their tangible triumph though this alteration in consciousness will always be limited by the objective barriers we've yet to surmount. But anyways all of that became increasingly tangential so I'll cut off now but suffice to say there's significant weaknesses in interpreting observers and physical phenomenon as purely seperate even though that narrative also has its own strengths and utility. An interaction between two seperate objects is a connection between the two by merit of this it also binds them together as a single one not discrete particles which are maybe only an approximation but a unified wave interacting with itself.
I think actually "materialism and empirico-criticism" is a very relevant text here as emphasizing the primacy of observation is effectively the same as the idea that the ultimate reality is just complexes of sensations. Our sensations are of course what we can verify is real but if these complexes of sensations have no objective external origin if there's no physical cause for why we're measuring the information that we're measuring then it ceases to be coherent why we're measuring anything at all. If there's not actually a tea pot in front of me why do see one? If there was no tea pot I wouldn't be seeing one although even if there is I may still not see it without that necessarily implying its not present. Its hard to prove a negative since theoretically you could be missing some piece of information youre forced to reckon with the teapot as a possibility. If there is a teapot in some physical volume why am I able to wave my hand through that space as if nothings there? The failure to find evidence of its existence does seem to confirm its absence but maybe you could object that owing to some special properties of its composition it doesn't interact with normal matter repulsively for example you could posit that the tea pot was actually made of dark matter even though certainly you could conclude that a perfectly "normal" tea pot didn't exist in that space. If nothing has any external seperate existence from our sensory perception of it and the only reality is pure sensations then they have no underlying causal nucleus in any objective rules the information is pure randomness yet we observe somewhat the opposite sure we find chaos but also from that we see order emerges and the two seem to spiral around one another in interplay with a guided rhythm. Measured information itself is arguably proof that an external objective reality must exist apart or else what would we measure if the big bang wasn't real (how do we define this?) but what the best models are to describe what the exact nature of this material reality is and whether our subjective measuring determines the information content of that reality even after the fact of its prior moments is an open question because even if the answers of our questions are predetermined (I dont believe thats necessarily true) and have a fully independent "real" existence before we ever even ask them we only arrive at those answers we always would have that are preconditions for our and still only attain them by means of observation which is our only means of interacting with the real. But either way it's imperative we comprehend as materialists that our sensations and measurements are not an impenetrable barrier seperating us from what externally objectively exists but rather a link connecting us to it.
If the big bang hadn't happened then there obviously wouldn't be satellite telescopes now to peer back in time and confirm that yes the big bang was a real event we will only ever verify a past which conforms with the prerequisites for the present. If your parents had never lived their lives before you were around till they met up and eventually created you then you'd never have been born to measure that the reality of your lives exists now and so their lives must've existed then independently of your interaction with it. If we were ever to do the opposite and make observations about the past which contradict our information about the present as we know it then we would be negating our reality and the preconditions for our existence if we asked if the earth existed a hundred years ago and found that no it didn't then obviously we couldn't be around now to arrive at that conclusion that our existence was a lie. To actually make that observation based off some empirical measurement we acquired by some means we're extremely confident of and got peer verified would be to radically alter our conception of reality to reconcile two known facts which appear to negate one another. In fact this is what has happened it is the history of our knowledge in the process of learning about the mechanics of reality through physics and natural philosophy long ago we constructed narratives about the nature of existence various models of reality by asking questions and arriving at answers until new experiments and discoveries disproved earlier conceptions negating their validity and mandating we conjure up alternative explanations to reconcile with our new observations.
At no time since the beginning of human history, had any man see something begin to exist unassisted. Everything breaks down on its own over time, but nothing ever builds up alone. A person must build a house, plant garden. An unattended house will dilapidate gradually on its own, and a garden grows out quickly; but nothing builds itself into existence. The universe can't create itself. That would be the OPPOSITE of everything that all of us observe daily in life, that not even the extremely simple machinery of a very simple mousetrap can come together unassisted to catch the mouse. That's what the entropy effect dictates. Not only has the universe been created by Someone immensely powerful and wise, but he is evidently very actively maintaining the universe, as a gardener maintains a garden, to prevent it from the decay of the entropy effect.
Infinite possibilities. Pick one.
as an avowed misanthrope, i find it ridiculous that we believe our puny species capable of influencing the universe. Why should our brief apperance on Earth have any causal effect? are humans required for the universe to exist? I don't think so
Oh s***, we really are a simulation. Computer doesn't generate it until we look at it o_0

for your thought experiment you put the beamsplitter exactly at the crossroad of the 2 random beams (the only place where they can meet and be rederected to only one new dectector)  making the whole thought experiment obviously predicted and directed to only one detector)) congratulations!!11
"quantum woo" - I like that.
Does the universe have "free will"?  Does it create the various "particles" of which we now think it's composed?  How would Bohr answer that?  Quantum physics only deals with the interactions of "particles", I think better-termed by Nietzsche as "centers of force".  It does not tell where they came from or why they are as they are, and yet without them, it has nothing to model, nothing to which it can apply its statisitical methods.  That the force centers interact and self-arrange into structures is perfectly sensible (We see phenomena like this all the time.), and that there are feedback/co-evolutionary mechanisms at work among the structures they form also sounds most reasonable, but that's evolution, not creation, evolution of already-existing entities.
Thanks for your challenging and interesting dives into QM, GR, etc.  I'm an astrophysicist by training and a systems engineer by occupation, and you have helped my understanding of a number of complex topics that I'd wondered about.  Please keep up the good work.
I think this angle of the mechanics is more of a reflection of human consciousness getting in the way of our understanding
Thanks for helping tardive dyskinesia patients, Einsteinians! 8ρ. I encourage you to study E8.
You deserve a discrete Carbon 12 / Carbon 13 isotope identity.
If the universe is indeterminant and entropy always settles to its lowest state and we consider every interaction as an observational event then the decisions of conscious observation would be limited to those of an orchestra conductor rather than that of a creator. In the delayed choice experiment, the instrument configuration limits the results without the need for the particles to be in a state of superposition. Maybe our use of mathematical superposition solves the problem and just like imaginary numbers they are not real but essential when solving specific problems...
This would account for no alien life anyhwere as of yet.
You are everything that exists through this universe, everyone else is just a different part of you. Like a persons leg is to a hand

Maybe the Earth really was flat once but then the universe changed it’s mind
Can someone here, give me some OWN theory about universe, solar system and planet earth?
I feel like i saw this in my last trip lmao
Did the universe exist before the Earth? Yes, it did. Active observation is not required on the macroscopic level, which the universe is….ya’ll keep forgetting that. 👍
I have all the answers... We are floating in a rock thrown into nothingness and this nothingness is expanding while our atoms are not touching other atoms but OUR atoms knows we are ourselves so they don't mix with the atoms of the wall, for example. This makes no fkn sense!  Y'all are welcome.
Its so funny how many physicists jump around the fact that their own consciousness is literally all they will ever know to exist. The "it" is you!
No, the universe does NOT create itself. What a stupid question. The very idea is logically incoherent.
It reminds me of a while ago when I saw an article saying that the ancient Greeks didn't see the color blue, as blue things were described as dark wine or something, and the researcher looked up ancient scriptures and found that other civilizations didn't either. they didn't had a word to define the color blue and so they could not distinguish it almost as if they were color blind, this would show that the language used would have a direct connection with the ability we have to perceive the world around us
Does the universe have to be one particular way?

Does reality phase faster than light giving an appearance that there are two objects?
How about Relational Quantum Mechanics? ;)
As it was stated in Landau Lifshitz book observer doesn't have to be conscious being or even detector, any interaction with the microscopic classical object results in wave function collapse.
the only answer to this question is that an old bearded man dressed in white created the universe ... this old bearded man was always there dressed in white ... and he has always thought that homosexuality was kind of gay ... that's the way it always was eternally ... and that is what created the big bang and from that we study things like strange and charm quarks
If we move at very close to the speed of light, where the Lorentz factor would be extremely high, would we see Hawking radiation behind us coming out of the event horizon of the observable universe?
So many philosophizing commenters here are missing the most important philosophical breakthrough of our species’ history: the formalized scientific method. We all share the same reality. So there is only one reality for all of life on this planet. I can't speak for the reality that alien species experience.
If the universe is informational, what happens if too many observers saturate it with questions beyond its computational capacity? Wouldn't logic control this computational load by slowing down observations? Wouldn't that process favor an expanding universe where parts becomes not observable anymore?
🤯
Sounds to me like scientists came to the conclusion that you only get the observed results after you... Well, observe them. ==
Ok, first of all, thanks for the video, it's amazing. Second. In my mind this leads to the scary fact that the more we ask about the universe, the more we reduce the possibility space of it, so once you have a bunch of curious monkeys in your universe, they will keep asking questions until maximal informational entropy is achieved. Which also means that omniscience = static universe. I swear I have not smoked anything weird.
I still don’t get the Schrödinger cat paradox, the cat is either alive or dead no matter that the observer didn’t know it yet.
So accourding to Niels, "no phenomenon is a phe......"  but the phenomenon is self observing, so the argument is pointless.  I looked in the mirror, I observed my own existence. Its really not that hard.
"The past is far behind us, the future doesn't exist."  A Einstein
isn't this thought experiment "proof" that the universe is just a digital simulation?
I wonder why physicists stop asking questions whenever consciousness is hinted at? Quantum woo!
We literally live in a simulation.
Huh?…I’m a dolt!
It looks like some kind of lazy map generation in sandbox game.
the bobblehead animations are objectively both distracting and bad.
So, in effect, what you are saying, in layman's terms might be similar to someone saying "oh, the ancient summerians invented astrology".. when this may not at all be true. It would be more true to say, they were the first to RECORD it. So in our world of history and cosmology, since we can't know about who or what was thought back then (even though Australian Aborigines have star teaching tales passed by mouth without recorded language, so we know there may well have been astrology before summeria). So, in effect, as they were no recorded measurements (writing and numbers) before then that we know of, then there were none. In effect, thus causes, even, experts who should know better to say "summeria invented astrology".  In one sense, the universe itself may be likened to informational bits. The first "question" resulted in helium, and on through as heavier elements were  created as each movement/question was "asked". Silly, I know. But I like the resulting imagery this  creates, imaginatively.
Ok, but what the F R * C K is observation?
The problem is how we are defining the observer. There must be a chain of entanglement that is so long that superposition never decides what its measurement is until it reaches back to the original quantum particle. The act of "observing" is a circuit completing.
but for the observer to exist, something else has to be 'observing' it
for 5:40 experiment. Does anyone try to exclude the existence of choice? For example: All time exists simultaneously so the choice is always already made. That sounds like a matrix I know, but relativity theory says that time is relative. For example, we see other galaxies as if they were millions of years ago, so we can observe experiments that were made millions of years ago. For us it is past, so we will not notice any superposition at all. The same can be if someone sees us from the distance in our future. If we suggest that everything is already observed the observer problem will be excluded. And superposition have no relation to the act observation but will depend on something else.

I love that physics gets to these points where suddenly different mathematical approaches to questions about the fundamental nature of reality seem to devolve into something more akin to philosophy.  Taken from a philosophical perspective, if you think about an observer-dependent universe and then further define an "observer" to be anything that a particle could interact with, then for the question of 'how does the universe exist' you basically get that the universe exists because it interacts with itself existing.   You devolve all of this insanely complex math and science into a strangely simple tautology - the universe exists because it exists. How does it exist? By interacting with itself. Because it exists.
the fact that there is an objective reality does not only serve physics well but also your brain not to go mentally insane after learning quantum physics
Think about time crystals for a second. It's endless state oscillator. Group of entangled particles are constantly transition between states with no external energy. What it tells us?   State of each individual particle of that system depends on state of the others... 'Depends' wrong word here... It's more like exists in that specific state only relatively to other particles. Telling it more different - state of each individual particle stored not in a particle itself, but in particles that it interacts with. State in Interaction. And that applies for each. It's an isolated system that locked on itself in an endless feedback loop of interactions.  I mean, isn't it an actual "Universe shapes(creates) it self"?
It's called rendering the simulation
So like if every possible observer exists it would be like evolution. We must be observers that observe our reality everything that doesn't directly correspond to us is like evolutionary remnants things that don't need to be there but are because well they haven't killed us yet. But this would be true for every observer. So really we our the center of our universe. Interesting thought I think it's cause you Australians get more blood flow to your head cause you don't have to fight gravity.

Beyond saying that an observable universe mass black hole has an event horizon the size of the visible universe demonstrating that it is near a critical point of gravitational collapse, it also outlines how the larger a universe space is the less dense it can be.

I’m convinced that we are the result of an infinite imagination where nothing makes sense until we try to make sense of it. Much like our brains make sense of random thoughts that somehow coalesce into a dream reality.

Universe Formnation > Logic ~ Truth ~ Numbers ~ Math ~ Relations ~ Equations ~ Computable Properties ~ All Computations ~ Algorithmic Observable ~ Physical Observer < Information  this is the formula like exchange in Reality between Information and Formation that makes the Universe
So, if this is in fact how the universe works, then it feels even more likely that we live in a simulation. It's kind of like how a game generates terrain as you walk further towards the edge of what is currently there.
So who made the first observation?
there going to do what their going to do if your looking at them or not.. do i hear a hint of narcissism?...lol
Research Chris Langan's CTMU to see how the participatory universe idea can be taken to its logical conclusion.
The more we discover about quantum mechanics the more it seems we live in a Minecraft world. Ever generating and rendering as we explore. The true answer to the Fermi paradox is that we observed the night sky too early - calculating those chunks before the aliens update.

What we 'observe' is not nature, but nature exposed to our methods of questioning. -Heisenberg
The only problem I have with the universe only determining it's characteristics under observation is that it's all constantly being observed. If photons move at the speed of light and don't experience time, then from the perspective of photons they're all being observed all the time, right? So how can we claim to observe or not observe something? It must have already been observed.
God created the universe in and of itself
can someone please explain to me the 20 questions, because if I were to ask a yes or no question wouldn't there be a choice of choosing either therefore i have no power over the question because there will always be a way around this?   If I were to ask specific questions how would i make the answer a definitive yes or no without going through thousands or possibly millions of predictions and possibilities?   thank you in advance for anyone who helps me out 🥰
@ 3:01 How is it possible for separate observers to share a single, consistent reality? For one infinite simultaneous divergent expressions that exhibit all possible outcomes, but also how co-inhabitants remain sharing the same lineation, is that despite the superficial differences we observing consciousness's have our bandwidth of circumstance, and probability of outcomes are similar.
materiality and ideation is meditated by a dialectic. the stuff between is what i call textuality. perhaps that's relational/participatory realism. idk if I'd call that information. maybe interacting & contingently entangled energy.
Imagine processing 'flower' as photons reflect from it into your eye and how differently a fly processes that flower or a bat or an amoeba processes it. The point is, what's really a 'flower' if nothing is processing? What's 'really' there?! Naming it reality is just a label for the ignorance of the conscious.
Can anything created create itself?  Has the universe always existed?  Hmmm.  And yet something must have always existed because something can’t come from nothing, it’s semantically impossible.
3:12 / 18:44  If the human minds observing could come to precisely the same point of conclusion—  There would be zero reason for 2 of the same exact being   🍓  Space and time exist…the precise agreement found within using the scientific method is truly just a law of average between beings to be able to communicate   Not the SAME EXPERIENCING IN BEING providing a potentially validated conclusion   It’s a thought exercise that provides the intended conclusion—  Due to space and time…every experiencing in being is subjective.  Edit: changed “mind’s” to “minds”
Who is the "observer"? A scientist, a community of scientists? The measuring instrument? No, all interacting active or passive particles are "observers". It affects the operation of others, creates the changed operation, the operation itself is "observation." The problem is not that they are philosophizing to physicists, but that they do too little and still start from their vision of their own instruments. The world consists of nothing more than the fact that the measurement affects the thing to be measured ...
Has anyone considered that consciousness is likewise created by observation?
so does God exist or not?
The thing with probability and uncertainty is that we just aren't good enough to describe it precisely isn't it? Which would make the observer effect just a bug in the system that shouldn't be focused on unless it is to fix it
Matter cannot be created or destroyed.  Thus in our known Universe, the Universe cannot “create” itself…..
Mind Blown!
lmao @ the identity politics in the graphics
......... mmmm I just want to exist tho... I just want my world back. But be able to change and move on form stuff...
This is also very much an "improvisational" interpretation. I'm improvisational comedy/theater, the golden rule is "yes, and" where you accept your partner's offering into the story (think about brainstorming and how saying "no" can kill the generative energy of the exercise) to help create the plot, world, and characters on the fly, and how it somehow also makes sense to the players and the audience (all participatory observers of the improvised scene).   "All the world's a stage, and we are merely players"
21st Century Discovery: The Universe is deterministic after all: in other words, the observer only observes things which are consistance with what the universe wants to show... What a revelation - we have come full circle yet not many has realized and is still wondering.
Similar to my idea that reality is improvising.
***The study of Quantum mechanics is the study of the program that was written and the machine that runs the simulation we are all in. Look at modern game engines. In order to save processing, elements are not shown or displayed that are not viewed by the player to save on processing. This is why the act of observing is so powerful.
Sean Carroll's explanation of many worlds interpretation explains Schrodinger's friend.  Alan Watts' lectures on Taoism explain the relationships as being more fundamental than the observer.  The observer-centric model is wrong. It always will be. We think too much of ourselves.  Love Wheeler's view. It feels about as close as possible without becoming inexplicable.
Really hoping for a Sabine hossenfelder interpretation of this confirmation that it depends on the observer

Hello my fellow data structures.
ALL OF US ARE A PART OF THE INFINITE MULTIDIMENSIONAL UNIVERSE TO SOME DEGREE https://imgur.com/YZ0wxO8 -BTW WE LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE HERE.
What Wheeler discovered was "backward in time causation", as with your BB example. That which "exists" is the key to what could have produced it, and what it could produce; both fwd and bwd in time. The deeper one probes the deeper the retro-construction. This becomes a fractal on both ends of 1) scale and 2) time, consistent with the Observer's present reality. No matter, ever smaller or larger, the universe will construct more "back-story".  Where all the photons of a black-hole lensed galaxy were in superposition when they interacted, billions of years *ago*, ONLY those observed on the right side collapsed, but just *for the breif moment the Observer was looking*, after which, everything returned to normal...  billions of years ago.
If you want real quantum way of this consider this I run an account bookshop a occult shop to put it plainly. What you just said in the first 2 minutes of this video is basic definition of the occult and magic. Later on when you begin discussing Professor John Wheeler ... You literally exactly match it..
OK, this is the most interesting concept I have heard yet, and makes me think that belief in God might not be completely irrational after all.
Brilliant!  The rock mode in the new movie "everything "  suggest that falling over a cliff is a cat in the box example..
This concept is found in Hinduism, it's written in Bhaghawat Gita. That the observer God(Shiva as Nothingness) creates Trinity into being as he interacts with nothingness itself. Its answer the Big bang problem from nothingness. 0= -1+1+-0 Electron proton and Neutron, from Total nothingness. But what that does even that mean to interact with nothingness is the same question in this video of observations and interaction
Well how we ever gonna know the truth?

So basically, if we maintain this idea of an "undetermined universe" to the origin of the universe (or at least to the original "observer/measurement") the entirety of existence was in a supposed superposition that became THIS?   Could it be that all the possible parameters/constants we see today were "selected for" (like the weak anthropic principle suggests) because it was the only configuration capable of producing "observers" that would later collapse it's wave function? That seems like circular logic so I don't think I entirely understand the premise.  I guess what I'm trying to figure out is: whether the universe's future determined it's past qualities, the superposition lasted until there was some "observer"  (but was unable to be defined before the first "observation"), or if there was simply no way to create the universe (with us inside) except in the exact configuration we have now. Maybe some of those overlap or maybe they're all nonsense.  To me, this topic seems like we're almost being too reductive in how we try to understand the underlying principles. When I try to imagine a superposition of the universe's states, I almost envision it to be a blurry mess all the way down to the smallest scale. It's like you're badly nearsighted trying to find your glasses/contacts: everything around you is clearly THERE but you can't actually discern the details until you make a concentrated effort to find it. Except, in this case, your glasses/contacts might be the old ones that didn't work so you have to keep looking for the right ones.  Maybe that doesn't make sense or is way off base. I just feel like there's something quite intuitive about the weak anthropic principle if we are trying to going to accept the randomness of the outcomes/properties of quantum objects.
13:30 - You be you Matt, love the show... just follow the science. :)
This is one of my favorite episodes. All I can surmise is that the universe is really creepily weird and wonderfully fascinating!
Lucifer time travels and creates the universe
what is an observer?   does this mean a universe devoid of all life (observers) couldn't exist? or would exist in a perpetual superposition of all possible possibilities, having no objective single reality?
tl;dw very carefully
How would relativity fit into all this?
If you place a giant mirror in front of physics scientist given time and effort he will prove the real world is in the otther side of the mirror
Egotism. We are not separate observers of The Universe. We Are the Universe. The whole thing is moot.
sciences is all about things being observable, repeatable and real sciences makes it clear nothing can not create something from NOTHING. theory of evolution needs nothing to create something in order to work which is why real sciences call's it a THEORY not real sciences. evolution is not part of real sciences but sciences fiction (theory, guessing faith based) evolution is like a religion----all faith based NOT sciences.
Does a tree make a sound in the forest when it falls? No. But it will disturb air molecules. Despite the fact that this particular tree may never be observed, it will eventually rot and return to the earth. There are many valid questions concerning existence. And, unfortunately, there are many manufactured questions that obscure the reality of our universe.
Do a video on the amplituhedron
Are you inside my head or vice versa at the moment? Actually inside many of my friend's and encounters' heads ;) and vice versa
This almost seems circular to me. Physics is our observation of reality, its natural our descriptions of our observations requires observation.
However those atoms wouldn't be out there anymore by now.
Also John Wheeler likely came up with the Delayed Choice  to prove that any consciouness  living on the earth now can look up into the night sky and collapse the wave functions of all the atoms created in the big bang retroactively
could this explain the Mandela effect

I don't claim to understand all aspects of this theory, but wouldn't a participatory universe explain quite neatly why our unverse is so "perfect" for life (and therefore us) without having to rely on a multiverse theory?
Sounds like we're in a simulation, the system only bothers to calculate the outcome when we actually measure things.
This all seems like hogwash to me. And, counter intuitive/productive to Actual science. Leave those though experiments to the philosophers & poets...  The universe does, & always will, exist without/in spite of us. Our "observing" does not & cannot change that. To imagine or suggest otherwise is lunacy.   Only a person capable of dying & coming back to this plane of existence could shed light on this. And, all religions are based on that idea. Which is also lunacy...
From a compiler-design and static analysis perspective, the idea of a superposition is just a union of everything that could be true, and the act of observing is just confirming which of the possibilities was actually true
"is observed" usually means is physically interacted with to take a measurement  Edit: then he said it in the video! Ahh I know some stuff 👽
Far out dude... 🤯 Kinda like Hegel versus Marx, or someting... 🤯
This sounds eeirily familiar to relativistic programming in parallel programming tasks. Could this be similarly started as every distinct entity in the universe is running a program to calculate possible states, and upon interaction with another entity, also running a program, they arrive at a new consensus of what path the program may take. And just as a computer core can idle till it receives input, a decision can be delayed till the resources needed to complete the calculation are made. So too time doesn't matter to parallel processers, only causality. Sorry but of a rant.
These experiments prove free will does exist but it is influenced by enviroment
Love the videos Matt keep going man
If they break down their wrong
The fundamental enquiry boils down to "Who Am I" question, the question, rather the questioner asking all the other questions. This is a time immemorial meditative enquiry in the Indian philosophy of Advait Vedanta, probing into the Self of all selves, the substratum of reality that Dr. O'Dowd touched upon @13:15. I was prompted to write about this with that point as the trigger
But what if quantum mechanics and quantum theory really only exist because we are looking. And our perceived reality is an extension of our theta brain function.
All I'm hearing is simulation, simulation and simulation. I don't like this one bit.
Most people participate in the participatory universe without realizing they are participating in it. What is the effect on reality of this non-participatory participation? By participating, do we not still each live in our own universe?  There seems to be no need for other multiverses.
Oooooh.. excellent topic..  ive considered this in my own hypothesis..  "What if we created (by our scientific meddling) our own universe?"
I try so hard but I can’t understand it sucks I really want to
The problem is that we're trying to read an Excel spreadsheet of undetermined size, and trying to figure out the entirety of the info from like 64 square cells
I am information only, having a soul is status driven. Souls are superior to information so humans are better then androids. I reject that.
I apologize in advance for the following impropriety. So. I had a dream last night in which I was visited by extraterrestrials. Among other things they explained dark energy to me. They said that causality does not connect moments, it seperates them; something about a "quanta of time" and that each of these moments exists as a distinct universe. This makes possible a time dilation between a relatively later universe and an earlier one with a higher energy density. As we look farther backward in time we see a universal expansion that appears to slow due to this relativistic effect. Play that forward and it looks like acceleration. Anywho. I think this is one of the few places I might relate a dream like that. Sorry if I am mistaken.
I believe the Moon still exists when we're not looking at it since God sees and observes all - the ultimate observer that allows our universe to "exist" outside outside of our own observations :)
What is with the idiot black cartoon character in this video other than being distracting and not helpful?
What if the universe is The Work Of God As Written In The Hebrew Bible Book Of Genesis
This cannot be more clear based on this video: you create your own reality.
Instead of evoking the strong anthropocentric principle, what if the multi-verses exist as different questions are asked of it?  Could it be that the underlying information and the way it comes to be understood leads to universes in which those conditions could be satisfied, separate from our own universe? If so, how could it be proven or disproved? Would there be any practical application or is it just philosophizing?
I believe each quantum of energy carries information about its latest interaction with something. And that information is later can be transferred to the observer.

Just a random thought...perhaps dark energy is the result of the "black hole" our universe is contained in decaying from hawking radiation? I bet the big rip theory could be explained as the end result of said black hole ceasing to be a black hole after it's density drops below a certain threshold.
The Universe looks at itself through my eyes in awe.
How would you create existence as it is from only awareness? Not awareness aware of itself, or awareness aware of that which it is not, yet just awareness, and not any concept more.   If you can get here, from there, you'll have spanned a great gulf that few, if only one, have spanned before.

This video is the best segway in existance to an audience survey, 👏
What creates the universe is you, my friends. That's right, you
You mean physicists are resorting to " new theories" that philosophers have had for centuries and millenia?

= a warp drive?
It's fascinating to see how close science in the 20th century has gotten to some very old philosophical ideas. Nevertheless, a substantial number of scientists still try to escape the idea of consciousness, as if they're trying to negate the fact that we live in a universe that is able to subjectively perceive itself. There are indeed "quantum woo" people who believe in stuff like you can cure cancer by thinking positively, but it feels like that a lot of scientists are trying so hard to distance themselves from those people that they're going to a different extreme
Ehhm, yeah. As always. Thx 😊
I find this video disturbing in terms of the content and the capability by those purported to be so brilliant, to wander from commons sense. I do very much enjoy this presenter, however.  Let me pose something here. Take the Schroedinger cat box and change it just a little.......inside we have the cat, the emitter, the receiver, the hammer and the vile, just like in the original. But in the vile we have acid instead of poison. The acid fumes would kill the cat as readily as the poison so that presents no problem. The vile would then be mounted on a mechanism such that were the cat to fall over, the vile would tip and its contents be dumped on the box floor. Suddenly, all those in witness would see acid dripping out from the bottom. The box would never opened and yet we would all know that by definition, the cat was dead and only dead for if not, no acid would be dripping out.  The only difference between the Schroedinger scenario and mine for the purposes of making my point is that the acid would eat through the box and the poison, not. In order for the “information” as you call it to exist outside of the box at all, the string of deterministic events within the box would have to have taken place already, i.e., prior to the revelation of the dripping acid. The only way the acid could be dripping out is if the cat were dead to activate the mechanism which overturned the vile. That the dripping acid was visible but more importantly, that it in a sense, “would seek out” the observer to present itself (proactively – it exists externally before the observer is made aware of it) means that the cat must be dead and only dead at that time. This is no different than the necessity of an electron gun to have already shot the photon at the slitted plate in the double slit experiment before it can create the pattern, interference or otherwise. The effect (the formation of some pattern), cannot precede the cause (the shot of the photon from the gun). You cannot claim that the acid would both be dripping and not dripping out of the box, the cat being both alive and standing (so the vile would not tip over) or dead (and having activated the mechanism and turned the vile over). In the case of the conventional understanding of the superposition of the cat, the cat exists in both states as a material entity imposing its form and function on empty space, which all entities do. Could you claim that the acid would drip from the box and not drip from the box at the same time so it would exist also in two different places at the same time, i.e., in the vile and not in the vile? But if the acid left the box and alarmed the observer “in its own time”, how could you say it is not deterministic? Keep in mind, there was no control exerted by the observer in his going to open the box to see the state of the cat. In this case the observer was reactive only unlike in the Schroedinger version.  So where is the wave form that would collapse in this scenario? Where is the superposition?  As for your delayed choice experiment, why is it that you claim detector 1 would register all the particles and not detector 2 (after adding the second beam splitter) when 1 would be no different than 2? In either scenario, a mirror would reflect the particle after leaving the first beam splitter (I know it’s one particle taking both paths at once) to the second beam splitter where they would cancel or combine and move to a detector. Why to detector 1 and not 2 when the function would be identical? In either case the cancelation or combination would be made by one moving perpendicular to the other. Additionally, why would it not continue to be a random reception by both detectors 1 and 2? Something is missing.   I think you should clarify what you mean by “information”. Information in the conventional understanding is not a thing or a substance. One cannot view an object and see information. Information is a consequence of a consciousness understanding an object or process and is realized only after that object exists, imposes its existence upon materiality and is studied that an understanding of it might be formulated. Yes objects impose their form and function on materiality as is made clear by the following;  As taught by physicists, materiality/empty space is a material construct. We can only understand this to be so because we have been instructed that particles are in fact vibrating energy quanta, local phenomena, peculiar to specific energy fields which in concert, form empty space. Empty space can be distorted or warped by the presence of a mass, each example of which is a composite of these energy quanta. I don’t think we could conclude anything else.  I don’t care how mysterious quantum physics is, physicists state that there can be no existent if there can be no molecules, no molecules if no atoms, no atoms if no protons, no protons if no quarks and gluons, and no gluons and quarks if no energy fields of that kind, the last of which must exist in measurable quantity in prerequisite. These are objective, deterministic “physicalities” which define the architecture or structure of the means of being which are not in any way influenced in their existence by our awareness or our observations which are of consequence only “after the fact”.  A tree exists in the woods whether we are aware of it or not as is made very clear by the death of him so unfortunate as to have built his house so close to the wood’s edge that it in its collapse, it reached out to strike his house and kill him and did so when no one was aware to observe it. It seems you infer that there is a physical character to information when there is not and cannot be. That two particles behave in a manner by entanglement which is complex and functional in some way is not a matter of some information as some phenomenon prior to the physicality and physical law which governs it. It is that which comes “after” the existence and assertion of the phenomenon which we as observers come to finally understand. It is wholly reactive, “not” proactive. Physical law is a fabric, threads which flow throughout the universe, throughout the context of the means of existence which simply “are” and do not require definition but that we need to define them that we might understand and employ that understanding to our benefit. The latter is “information” and not fundamental to the means of existence.   Wheeler’s participatory universe is childishly ridiculous. How can anyone take such a man seriously or to even bother studying his work? Here we have the tail wagging the dog. To claim that we in the here and now can have been participants in the big bang because we looked back to study the possibility, is to deny the very nature of the particle physics which supposed physicists now claim we should embrace. So, which of those now in observation of the past/big bang were responsible for it? In the beginning of those entertaining the beginnings of the universe, there was no theory of the big bang. So was it what they contemplated that was real? Did that then change as technology improved and other theories were proposed? Imagine a row of ten dominoes standing on end. The first one is pushed over to contact the second, i.e., metaphorically the big bang, and the second then falls then the third and so on until the tenth. How is it that Dr. Wheeler would make a direct causal connection between the motion of the tenth with that of the first? I don’t think anyone would argue that there cannot be motion without an object. Logically, it follows then that the motion of an object is peculiar to that object only or it could by definition, not be at all. It is the nature of the phenomenon and that by which it manifests. Yet Dr. Wheeler claims that there could be a connection? I suppose, but only if you defy all the rest of the physics he demands we embrace.   Awareness or consciousness is by definition reactive. One cannot be aware of a bird unless there first, is a bird. One cannot be aware of the concept of pink flying elephants unless first instructed as to the nature of an elephant, pink and flying. Such mental phenomena are reactive only and function in consequence of the imposition of those entities, processes and concepts which are a product of their material interactions. If we are to believe that an electron is really a component of materiality, a discrete packet of energy, a local phenomenon in a particle field manifesting as that particle, quantifiable and consistent in that quantity then we are obliged to accept that it is independent it its assertion of itself. Trying to create some functional coupling of this with the intangible phenomenon of human awareness or consciousness is truly absurd and compromises the very logic employed to assert truths of the former. One cannot have it both ways.  What do you think?
"The past has no existence except as recorded in the present" sounds a lot like the discussion between O Brien and Winston in 1984 where he told Winston that the past is what memory and documentation agree on.
In Samkhya Vedanta, Cit is Witnessing Consciousness, a ground in which all other things manifest, the 'space wherein all abides'. It is a space but also universal consciousness. Consciousness which we share . Our Western definitions of consciousness, mind and ego are very limiting. I want to challenge any physicist willing to read Sankhya and then Advaita, then let's talk.
Bravo !! I'm remembering how to be a child again after watching SpaceTime !
is that New Zealand accent?
Without reading all the comments, given an inquiry on suggestions, this topic could be expanded on. Consciousness as part of quantum physics, the universe, and 'what is real'.
👍🏻
God is a cat who coughs up universes whenever a stellar hairball irritates its divine innards,
I love this theory and it's what I've personally believed / understood for many years now. It's the only thing that makes sense.
Wake up from the coma!:) A money prize for solving the three paradoxes below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYb5OkV6_Yo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAydFMDKj2Y
Best episode ever!
We have absolutely no evidence of anything creating itself.
I just learned that eventually  what ever part of the universe we are living in could be closed or whatever 😐if it expands as it should over a infinite time or a VERY VERY VERY long time our universe could reach critical mass density it could recoil its self 😐creating another Big Bang I don’t know for sure 😓but if it is ture we are only at the early stage of the whole universe is cosmos then we got a long way to go 😑but I guess it’s save to say as technology develops we will know 😐
The first splitting thing is the observer. So how do you know what state it had going there
Theory is always Singular; it only appears to be plural.
Of course not
Soooo, why don't we have AIs making tests and observations thus removing the conscious observer? Would this not allow us to remove the mysticism of the problem?
Definition just depends on how much you can see
I hate this assertion of the delayed choice quantum eraser is a real thing. Well, I have never seen one. SHOW ME THE DEVICE OR CALL IT WHAT IT IS!!!! It is a THOUGHT experiment. Please, do explain to me how entangled particles can maintain entanglement AFTER BEING INTERACTED WITH by oh i dont know.....A FREAKING BEAM SPLITTER!!!!  This is why people think there are these magic faster than light zombie cats everywhere. Bad use of language to explain complex or fundamentally flawed concepts. There is no 'and' there is only 'or.' The cat is not alive AND dead, it is alive OR dead. Period. The photons you share with Bob are not A AND B, you both have A OR B. The only thing that is held true is the fact that your methods of detection have broken down to a 50% chance of one OR the other. You measuring and finding B does not magically make Bob's A. The information that Bob's is A, without Bob interacting with it, ie making a measurement or observation, cannot travel to Bob faster than light(ie, faster than say, a radio transmission, can transmit that you found B).  Thought experiments by definition exist in the mind. The mind can imagine all sorts of scenarios that, how ever logical, do not actually exist. SO SHOW ME A FUNCTIONAL DELAYED CHOICE QUANTUM ERASER OR SHUT UP ABOUT IT!!!!
If this is all true then it does seem to imply that a sophisticated enough intelligence (A super advanced AI maybe) could change the past, or future, or something along those lines.  That is getting pretty esoteric and weird, granted.  Maybe it would be limited by what could be observed, though?
Search any painting of "ananthasayanam".  The universe is akin to navel contemplation.
I think the exchange and retention of information is a big part of what it is to be conscious.  What happens in the game of negative 20 questions when the questioner forgets the answer to one or more of the previous questions?
But, if in order to "see", light needs to hit stuff, bounce off of it and then hit our eyes, if we are trying to "see" quantum level of "stuff", it's like having a motion sensor that throws baseballs around trying to detect "stuff"... Of course it would interfere with the said "stuff" we are trying to monitor/"see". Unless it's emitting its own light and we do not need a "3rd party" to interfere. I'm thinking that the act of "observing" is changing the outcome because we are not merely observing. By shooting photons to be able to see we are also interfering ?  Or did i miss something?
The really important distinction is determining how much consciousness is required in order to render a fact as immutable. Can an infant do it? Someone with half their brain removed? A dog? A fly? A computer? A fly that's been 3D printed from scratch, cell by cell?
Great bit puns worth all the wishy-washy :)
Neutron decay cosmology is the physical solution to black hole paradox and fine tuning as well as giving a rational flow process to the universe.   Neutrons which invert at moment of neutron star collapse into black hole and any future infall , when they contact the event horizon they become the event horizon, the vacuum energy, for a single Planck second. Then these neutrons re-emerge in lowest density points of space where they decay into amorphous atomic hydrogen.   This decay process, from neutron to hydrogen, includes a volume increase, energy density decrease, of 10^54 times (maybe more).  Expansion, dark energy, Lamda.  The fact that a solid becomes gas means fine tuning is self regulating as gas expands to fill available space.   The decay product, amorphous atomic hydrogen, doesn’t have stable orbital electron so can’t emit or absorb photons.  Dark matter or some of it.    In time the hydrogen stabilizes and follows usual evolution path from gas to nebula to proto star to star until in distant future it is again at edge of event horizon.   The universe is steady state but locally evolving.  The Hubble Doppler is an artifact of the fact that we exist in a local gravitational well called the observable universe. BranDicke metric.  Plug the mass of universe into a Schwartzchild radius calculator, radius 13.8 billion light years.   Not the age, the size. The universe is much larger than observable universe and possibly infinite.   Neutron decay cosmology is inevitable.   Time is a compact dimension one single Planck second in size.  It is the thickness of this membrane.  Our manifold.    Surface(cos(u/2)cos(v/2),cos(u/2)sin(v/2),sin(u)/2) 0>u>4pi 0>v>2pi  A minimal single sided closed surface.  Notice 4pi, 2 full rotations to complete surface.  Electron half spin and baryon asymmetry are artifacts of this topology.   The top half is gravity well.  The bottom half is a single neutron decay.  The singular events of antigravity in the universe.    https://assets.adobe.com/public/176dd4ea-7dcf-4f46-450c-3b49332a4257  Neutron decay cosmology.
In a reality that consists of interacting elementary particles, does 'observer' have any meaning?
Tree falling in a forest, chicken and the egg... We know things falling make sounds. Just because a person doesn't witness it, you can't dismiss the fact that it did. If the egg came before the chicken, then the thing that laid the egg wasn't a chicken. Evolution, no? Don't they say that raptors evolved into chickens? So what came before the raptor? I feel like scientists put too much importance on humans in all of these questions and theories. After all, if the tree's in a forest, there must be animals and insects, right? They could have observed it. We would never know because we can't know what they have experienced. Sure, you can wipe away everything but one tree on Earth. The tree dies because it's the last living thing on Earth and can't live due to the inhospitable environment. The tree falls, the cracking and tumbling moving the air around it violently. It made plenty of sounds. Nobody heard them, but that's how sound works. Just because nothing registers it as a sound it doesn't mean the sound didn't exist. To quote a mediocre movie, "Just because you can't see it, it doesn't mean it's not there." And of course, anybody who believes that a God made the universe could tell you God observed everything, so there's that. But I decided to leave that to the end because I wanted to get a lifetime of frustration off of my chest.
Our consciousness can be described by FIDO (Focus, Imagine, Diffuse(relax), Observe) You and I can switch between these four modes of consciousness. Through my own observations and interests in these matters, I also came to the conclusion nature creates itself.
Consciousness is the fundamental nature of reality.
So what if two people play 20 questions at the exact same time, but each, in synch, ask opposite questions (Is it bigger/smaller than a breadbox?).
You're not saying its aliens, but...
I think the claim that concious minds have direct power over reality is indisputable, if you belive that have to make desisions as a living human.  Which everyone belives.  I think quantum physics could pull that thread and actually learn something about counciousness
Couldn't it be argued that by this theory, the limits of the observable universe do, in fact, constrain the true boundary of what is the existing universe. Until we have the ability to see beyond that limit (theoretically never) nothing beyond that point exists?
I’ll be honest, I don’t really understand.
Maybe the earth was flat until we decided to make it round?! ;D
my take: time is bidimensional and unlike the x component, we can chose the direction we take into the y on an individual level. observation makes us settle into a direction on its y axis. since it's impossible for two persons trace the exact same path, you can say that each person carries with themselves their "personal universe", the center of which is... themselves.
In Wheeler's version of the game, you can very much end up with an empty set of possibilities. Even when the person asking questions is careful in not asking contradictory questions. For instance, if you alternate Yes-No and the player asks the same question twice. It should be necessary to implement a rule: any question asked must be asked relative to the set of possible answers, and not relative to the initial (universal) set. This leads us to interesting parallels with higher level logic (modal logic) and possible worlds. Check the works of Kripke, Barcan and others. The question of the working set or domain becomes fundamental. Perhaps the universe is built no from information theory, but from a specific version of modal logic.
So if there is some deity out there, they’re a fan of improv’s “yes and” principle. We’re playing dnd folks.
I have a simple question. If the observer ''creates'' the observed by that negative 20 questions thing. What about that meme where different people saw two colors of the same dress, some called it blue and the others gray or something. It doesn't change the inherent property of the dress.
Fantastic episode! Especially the Q&A part. Outstanding work 👏🏻
Quantum mechanics is math to determine probabilities of experimental outcomes.  Attempting to make more of it than that just makes a hash of it.
The observed creates the observer.
Could you please do a show on overlapping dimensionality.
I came to this conclusion independently myself. There is a fuzzy reality of space time where all possible realities exist. Each universe configuration has a past.  We exist locally but everything we observe locks in a reality backwards in time that led to our existence when viewed with our eyes and telescopes and measurements.
What??
I recall a video recently where black holes were reimagined not as an event horizon with a central singularity, but as a region where spacetime appeared to be torn and spread over the event horizon with "nothing" existing inside. But, what if something DID exist "inside"? Rather than a force pulling towards a center, could there be a pressure exerted by the event horizon to stretch the spacetime (or whatever exotic equivalent exists) within?  Basically, could Dark Energy be a direct consequence of the cosmic event horizon pulling on reality?
All things come from chemical reaction and evolution of the natural environment
The more I learn about quantum physics, the more I think it looks as if the universe is a bunch of algorithms balancing each other to form reality as it materializes. In other words I agree it should be fundamentally informational and as the interactions happen the only or main rule they follow is to keep existing (or keep reality existing) so the only difference I see whit these interpretations it's not that the observer "creates" reality but it's the algorithms in the background from all the interactions between everything that keep the universe existing as the interactions happen. And from learning about physics I've also learned that every interpretation I think of, some physicist already has and has explained why it doesn't work or has made an essay about it, so if someone knows more about this interpretation I would love to be pointed in the right direction to learn more about it, thanks
A closed Universe would, if it were the case, I imagine, be considered a Black Hole by definition unless a Black Hole is only considered as such by an outside observer. So the idea of black holes within black holes seems plausible from an imaginary or perhaps fanciful frame of reference.
3pizza43 and Jacob Dusser: asked the question about Hawking radiation applied to the Universe as a black hole. I do not agree with this proposition, as well as you already explained it in your video project. But I’d like to use one of the statements made by Stephen Hawking about the black holes to develop this idea.  He proved that the information does not disappear inside the black hole, but instead is, so to say, kept on the surface of the black hole, somewhere around the position of its Event horizon. The more matter is consumed by the black hole the bigger it is and the bigger becomes its surface, containing the information about this matter.  I’d like to make the following four statements: 1.	Our Universe also has its event horizon (similar to the black holes). 2.	Information about our Universe is kept on the surface of it. 3.	With the time being the information about events in our Universe is growing and correspondingly also grows the area of this surface. 4.	Information is material and it is the black energy.  Immediate consequence of these statements is that this is exactly the reason why our Universe is stretched!  I wrote about to Dr. Stephen Hawking, but to my big regret he was already in a very bad condition and left us 2 months later… I received just a formal answer about his health condition.
How I play akinator
Of course it does. Plain logic has ruled out all the various humanoid "Creators".  Nothing comes of nothing, therefore the Universe was always here, and will continue to create itself in an unending variety of ways. Never mind the idiotic argument that an infinite past cannot exist!  The fabric of Time-Space is circular, and this does not imply that all events repeat!  The FABRIC of TIME in a sphere, but individual paths are infinite.  No bearded "God" needed!
Matt is a legend
I don't mind one bit when physicists philosophize. As long as they remember that their philosophizing looks to us like our calculating looks to them, we're good.
Man, James Woods looks a lot like Schrodinger.
No.
Is this communication between the observer and the particles happening virtually
All those philosophers who think the observer matter are too full of themselves.  The universe existed before we looked at it and will continue to exist when we can't look at it any more.
Do you use fienman diagrams to illustrate the beam splitter experiment's results?
We live in "The Matrix".  The servers our existence runs on do not bother to calculate particle interaction until we look at it, because otherwise it would consume too much processing power.
I took your original advice, and after months of struggle and study, I finally gave in to accept the many worlds theory... However will I be able to accept this magic? lol Great video!
Who are the animated scientists? I've wondered this for some time.
Also ? We , I. on after death experience would require perception ,so under this constructed view if no perception then no after life could be experience other than drifting into a light as our consciousness ceases to perceive awareness . This would definitely mean this experience (life ) is all there could ever possibly be ....
So ? I the person who considers what my experience is ,is the center of a universe and or my perception is the creative force of the great void or in Chinese philosophy of the Tao for lack of a better word as the teaching says ...forgive me for I am but I am under educated...
I am new to this channel so maybe I am rising a subject that you have already discussed but I thought that black matter had been put in question because the increase of space between clusters of galaxies could as well be explained by shrinkage rather than inflation.  The Great Attractor which tends to bring our local galaxies towards it is itself being attracted by an even more powerful Attractor and itself towards a mega Attractor.  If Space contains an immense number of these mega Attractors pulling galaxies towards their core, the space between them would increase and the galaxies would seem to move away from us.  Something like that.  Regarding quantum state, isn't it that it is a field of possibilities that takes shape at the moment an event occurs, be it an observation or 2 particles hitting one another or any such thing?  Time begins at the very instant an event occurs and is bound to this event as whatever takes shape/is created/appears will decay and "die", so every event has its own time.  For instance, the mayfly lives at a different time to us, and us to planets etc.  Do I make sense??  I cannot understand these discussions about reality.  It is only our limited perceptions and concepts that can be questioned, not the fact that there is something as the universe has existed before any observer was there to make note of it.  It seems that with the immense length of time available,  all these elements are combining in any way possible; whatever can be created will be created given enough time and be erased without any sense of morality, fair play or beauty.
Although I don't wanna break the flow of the Space Time series, great series by the way 😊 I am more curious about the strange phenomenon known as quantum teleportation. Is it possible to quantum teleport information? Does it propagate at the speed of light or is it instant? How does this arise from quantum physics? Just wondering if you guys could address this sometime please
What if, rather than a Multiverse in which everything that could possibly happen happens, our Universe is the only one that could have possibly happened?
Men, take this advice from your brother: Because we are still unable to explain and know 100% what made a big bang and existence, so we must beleive in god; since if there was a god and we met after death, we will be winners, besides  if there wasnt a god, we will not be losers of anything. Otherwise not beleiving in god while not having a 100% evidence for it, will make us losers if there was a god, but in case there wasnt we will not lose anything.  Conclusion:  beleivers in god:              there is actually a god : win             No actual god: no losing Atheists: there is a god actually : lose                   No god : no losing  Beleivers vs atheists 2:1
God created the universe
Am I ever glad I stumbled upon this video... it really made my day. :D I often feel like one of those people who bring down the intellect of the "average person" but it's really refreshing to know that dignified and highly respected people think of this wacky stuff as well.  I spend a lot of my free time thinking of fringe-science concepts and I have had this growing notion over the years that the causal relationship between everything in the past, present and future was exactly the theory he's describing - the participatory universe. Reality/time/causality, in the big picture, is less of a straight line and more of a loop that everything influences. The fact that it the loop exists as a necessity to satisfy the consistency of all of the parts is something I strongly concur with and I agree that it's not a mystical power from the conscious mind. "The reality we observe is the only reality that is consistent with all questions ask of it by all observers"  A related concept I came across a few years ago and personally termed "the banana peel mechanism" (I'm not actually sure what it's called) acts in a similar way, but the opposite effect - reality PREVENTS a loop from being created. [Fyi, it's less about the banana peel and more about the mechanism] The concept goes something like this: Suppose you've created the first time machine and you have the plans in front of you to replicate it. It took the the greater part of your life to figure it all out and now what you want to do is bring the plans back to your younger self and get all that time back. So, you pack your bags up and start walking to your machine BUT - you guessed it - you slip on a banana peel, which spills a drink into some electronics and soon enough, an enormous fire burns everything to rubble. Reality REALLY doesn't like paradoxes, so it stopped you from changing the past so that the future remained consistent - and it could have happened a million different ways.  Somewhere in my reading and research through the years I came to a deduction on these "loops" I've described - if you're in a loop, you can't get out & if you're not in a loop, you can't create one. It comes with a quite complicated caveat - things could be *slightly* different in the loops, so long as a "certain" consistency is maintained - ultimately the paradoxes are avoided at all costs. This comes back to how reality "could have stopped you a million different ways" - perhaps instead of slipping on a banana, a stray neutrino caused a malfunction and you exploded... who knows. It's kind of like some predetermined, Final Destination-like stuff...  I find it super intriguing that these loops bring up the question of free-will: are we actually free to make choices or has everything been predetermined?
Commendation from NASA for research work at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the Earth's atmosphere and the Moon's surface for navigation of the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon.. Dr. Milo Wolff has found the structure of the electron consisting of two spherical quantum waves, one moving radially outward and another moving radially inward. The center of the waves is the nominal location of the electron 'particle'. These waves extend infinitely, like charge force. All 'particle' waves mix and contribute to each other, thus all matter of the universe is interrelated by this intimate connection between the fundamental 'particles' and the universe. The natural laws are a direct consequence of this Wave Structure of Matter (WSM), thus WSM underlies all of science. spaceandmotion
That makes it sound like radiation is only radioactive when observed. "I can't see it; therefore, it can't exist." I feel like this theory ignores object permanence because "I can't see what's going on".
The Universe was created by the big bang. The big bang also created spacetime. So, before the big bang there was no "where" Nothing existed. No place existed. So the big bag was created from nothing, in a place that did not exist?
Constant singularity and expansion loop
It's seeming more and more obvious every day that we're in some sort of simulation.
Is this where God comes from?
Personally I think some form of Idealism is more palatable than the continuous branching off into different universes. I needn't be entirely solipsistic. The Quantum prior to measurement is collective while the experience of it i.e. the measurement, is individual. If one individual measures one way for him it is a wave if another measures another way it is a particle. We as perceiving individual conscious subjects have consensus reality due to the fact that our measuring devices, our cognitive apparatus, is similar. Our cognitive apparatus is our five senses and mind with its a priori accumulated conceptual frame work. There is no "collapse" of an objective wave function. Superposition, in this model, is more akin to the thing in its self, the "ding an sich" or noumenon of Immanuel Kant. The measurement is the experience of it. We, as subjective agents, are each "rendering" our own reality of the quantum. We are each existing in our own bubble of experience, outside of our subjective experience is the realm of the collective unconscious, and this is the quantum realm prior to measurement. The unconscious is the "field of information" or data. The two the subjective and the unconscious source of the seemingly objective, are two aspects of one whole. Without interaction between these two aspect the data or information is meaningless, unexperienced and un-rendered.
No.
This is stupid because it is obvious that the presence of an observer affects and creates a context. There's no reason to speculate things don't exist without our observations either, but it is not difficult to imagine that consciousness which we dont fully understand (at all), should interact and change things in unexpected ways. I genuinely hate the semantical b.s. which is used to communicate to people
We are living self-conscious processors of Information, in a Universe where everything is Information and Energy, and where, if there is a purpose, it could be characterised as “Information seeking understanding through experience”.
I am a huge fan of Sabine's interpretation of the erasure experiment.
What if its much simpler? What if something is uncertain hecause it hasnt been measured? What if it seems the act of measuring something changes its value because the value is in flux?
Can someone explain the beamsplitter experiments like i'm in middle school?
Don't know much about physics, but I can only imagine that one can't possibly get far relying on observation alone.
“Shut up and calculate” - Feynman I was thinking the same thing as I was listening to this. Philosophy is not science, and it overly complicates the unknown.
If the universe is participatory, can it give itself a medal?
"Time keeps on ticking, ticking ... into the future." Steve Miller
Whoooaa   gonna have to think about that one .. :-)
Were by itself come from😕
There is no finite unit of time, and by all standards our person (the observer) live in no specific space time. Which I would believe to make a paradox by mathematically locating the observer however there is no way to subjectively define the location of anything ... You win again -21 questions ...
I enter in to watching this video with great trepidation.
No such thing as observer and observed.  Every particle is both. It is patterns of interaction rather than an arbitrary classification of observer and observed. If an entity or particle participates in an interaction then it is an observer/observed thing. Humans are part of the universe and are not separate from it or otherwise special.
We're living in a YouTube perpetual motion machine.
Everything IN the Universe creates itself...so, why wouldn't this cycle scale up to the whole shebang?
👍❤
i have this little pet theory that Quantum wierdness supports the simulation theory. Suppose there's a limit, like render distance in videogame only it's not render distance, but render size. Maybe the simulation can't render Quantum interaction's untill they are observed or measured. I'm sure it's nonsense but it helps me sleep at night.
So in this It from Bit universe... would the wave-function of the whole universe be a path across a preexisting multiverse where all those possible negative 20 questions' questions that might be asked are the landscape of the multiverse?
Why denying the woo of the past scientists?
could this be an explanation for the unreasonable efficacy of math in explaining the universe
I've always had the idea that there is a default "base" state of the universe not created or brought into "reality" because of observation. Considering matter (early planets, stars etc) and all that existed before any form of "conscience" beings existed to even perceive and interact with it did exist in some form, I find it hard to believe the universe as we know it is the way it is purely because we perceive it. How did the first conscience being even come into form if there wasn't anything before it?
I guees the phrase of "no phenomenon is a phenomenon..." Is from John Archibald Wheeler... Or maybe I'm wrong
The big bang was a controled explosion because nothing is out of control or has the possibility to do so..
I believe photon has perception to a degree. I believe like any lifeform, the universe is a perpetual infinity that informs itself.
Aghh, so we are the universe experiencing itself
Listen, I can answer the Cat Quantum question....it goes like this: Just because we cannot know if the Cat is alive, or dead in the box, we can, in fact, KNOW that any outside influences can and will change the positions of the Cat, so to speak; yes; but the only way to know for sure, is to study the outside influences and begin there...Not, just what the observer sees when he, or she opens the box... Because there are many other things that come into play, when measuring a Quantum particle...I know it sounds too simple; but that is how it really works... The observer can also, influence the position of the particle, by outside influence... That is what the Large Hadron Collider does... So, start there and you will get a Nobel Prize!
In response to what future show ideas I’d like to see more of: What’s up with the latest on supersymmetry? Last I heard was that the LHC found no evidence of supersymmetry particles and that the theory was (almost) dead? Then I haven’t heard any more about it since then. Would love to know what’s happening with this since then.
Forty-two.
Please discuss Quantized Inertia. Is it BS? And why? What misunderstandings need to be cleared for anyone buying it
Philosopher and particle physicist Karen Barad uses contemporary philosophy, borrowed from science studies and feminism, to make sense of this kind of participatory universe through "non-human agents". They're a realist, not in the sense that objects are real or physical theories are real, but in the sense that intra-actions are real. They call it "agental realism"
I actually understood this, which is the first time, from watching PBS for an observable year!
Col:1:13: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: Col:1:14: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Col:1:15: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: Col:1:16: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: Col:1:17: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
Astaghfiruallah these people think the universe creates itself but intact it is allah (swt)
This dead cat crap is getting old. it's about time for some real science and stop all the crap that can't be tested under experiment and move on. We have been held back in science by all the theorists that bring nothing real to the table. This video keeps all this crap in the forefront and it needs to be in the past. If it comes back up in the experiment so be it. For now, just stop all the bullshit and do some real science. We need more Sabine Hossenfelder's in the world.
It makes sense except for the "Physical Particles" thing. After listening to the particles giving way to disturbances in fields it is getting hard to believe anything like a particle exists. UNLESS you want to call a packet of energy a particle. Packets I can see. Particle? Not so easy Any More.  But one other thing is starting to make sense. Not quite there yet, but Getting there. The one where the universe is a hallucination. First we have to wonder if quantum mechanics isn't making us all a tad bit batty. Yeesh!
Keep in mind you can't have observation or interaction without consciousness.
It's always amusing to see scientists struggle with reality when it doesnt conform to their biases but that's what they invent mythical dark matter, dark energy, black balls and dark bull phenomena for I guess.  LOL
No matter how Wheeler tried to use different words posed as questions, it seems he couldn't quite escape the fact that consciousness and reality are inextricably linked.
most ppl still think its some old white dude who created it in 6 days 5000yrs ago
Balderdash. Reality is made of little turtles, all the way down.
From where I'm sitting, "interactions constitute measurements" is the only one of those explanations that isn't just another form of quantum woo.
I have an idea for a video. Can you explain the speed of causality again but this time explain it around the fact the speed of light could only be measured in a two-way trip but could theoretically be slightly different than 300 km/s if we could break causality and measure it in a one-way trip? That would make a cool video.
Does PBS Spacetime exist without me watching the video?
The observer is most valuable when observing other wise their wouldn't be anything to observe.
What he is saying is you never seen the universe it wouldn't exist and you wouldn't exist either.
I very much love the fact that our observation of reality meets ancient philosophy. In this video I was reminded to a nice buddhistic idea: The experienced object, the experiencer and the experience are the same.  Please keep on making cool videos space time team!
so ouija boards are bridges that connect the mind and body to the universe itself and the answer is given to them by both themself and the universe. and the more people that play the more complex the universe that they are enveloped into becomes because instead of considering just one persons question it suddenly becomes 2 or 3 or 4 peoples question. This is how science begins to be birthed. Multiple people asking the same question and comparing answers.  So the truer ones reality is the deeper one has peered into the abyss quite literally.  Is the "Abyss of knowledge" really an abyss though?
One day evidence of the big bang will disappear and people may start asking is there a beginning at all? and if they find the answer is no because we discovered the answer WAS yes but not anymore then their reality is forever trapped in a world where the universe never began to begin with and then they stop existing entirely.
it seems to me that the observer centric view may be the new version of "we are the center of the universe" but in reality every observer is its own center. I like the way this is going we are headed towards a universe where every educated person believes that they are god. will we fight the ultimate hubris of hubris and deny our egos the privilege of feeling like god or will we succumb to the idea that everyone creates their own separate universe individually and independently as a war wages between which observers reality is objectively better rather than arguing over whose reality is just right? One thing is certain is that god is a very lonely person.
I've been watching this science garbage a long time and am baffled how wrong they have it, it's convoluted and junked up with subatomic particles and bs, the universe is very simple and elegant, wake up people, there is only one force, electromagnetic force, and one particle that can have one of 2 charges, positive and negative, you can build the entire universe with just these simple things, you don't need a strong nuclear force to hold protons together if they are coupled together electromagneticly with electrons, even gravity is electromagnetic, it's incoherent dielectric force, why do you think stars have electromagnetic fields
Time is the directional vector of the rotation of 3d space, as it rotates thru objects, the universe is very simple to understand, there is only one force of nature, electromagnetic force, there is only one medium, the ether, light rotates with the universal rotation making it timeless and causing redshift as it propagates as a compressional wave thru the ether, matter is frozen light, by that I mean, it's a modality of the ether much like light, similar to how ice is a modality of water, mother nature doesn't have a calculator and literally only knows one thing, pressure mediation
what happens if the same question is asked at two very distant points in the universe, and they get answered differently? But after they've both already answered the same to the speed of light. Would they both behave differently until their light bubbles collide? What if they were galaxies so far apart they never collide? Is it possible a galaxy far enough away has different laws of physics? Many different kinds of reality in the same universe?
Illogical logic could argue that the cat isn't real because at the quantum level it's not a 'thing' . How something that doesn't appear to be real or 'solid' can create something clearly 'solid' and 'real' is a question for the Gods probably. How does one create energy when energy can't be created or destroyed ? How can a universe come from nothing ? Has CERN created particles that have come into existance from nowhere only to disappear ?
If we try to detect the path of a photon or particle, the probing instrument cannot detect it without absorbing it and this may also alter the result. We deal with such small particles or photons that their paths may be altered by trying to observe them. Does that account for the reason why the double-slit experiment behaves differently when observed?
The answer to where is the center of the Universe is simple. First to solve this, one must understand the size of the Universe & to answer that, ask yourself how many time you can break in half anything you perceive. Once you come to the realization that it would have to be able to be broken in half infinite amount of times because something can never become nothing because nothing does not exist. Then you will realize the Universe is Infinite in size & the center of an infinite space is wherever you are perceiving it from. The center is everywhere. :)
I imagine that prior to Big Bang the rule was to always give the same answer, no matter what, so the universe then was a uniform "yes" (or uniform "no").
It amazes me how quantum mechanics  solves the apparent paradox of a determinist universe coexisting with 99.99999999% free will agents.
The conceptual 'paradox' of the double-slit experiment lies in our assumption that the "photon" is a single, bounded "physical particle" that is "isolated in" and "moving through" what is otherwise "empty space".  In fact, however, the 'photon' is an acceleration- rate fluctuation in the otherwise smooth 'point-radially "outward"/"inward" (ultimately equivalent in its overall "black hole" horn-toroidal geometry) acceleration-flow of the scale-uniform (in the absence of its 'self-relative' "acceleration" motion) "spacetime" hyper-fluid medium (SUM).  "Time" (physical change) is the continual evolution of this self-configuring ('self-exciting', particulate I/O device network simulating, momentum-routing, feed-back circuit) "pure motion" waveform.  So yeah, "expanding into the future" is a valid description - being that it can't do anything else.
what an interesting way to reframe our subjective perspective
The Universe does not create itself,the idea is as ridiculous as it sounds;"create" because its still in the process of being created.Scientists are SO prisoners of their own instruments that translate data they cannot understand into data that they can and thereby distorts and dilutes that data.Also I"ve never heard a scientist say "The way we perceive the Universe is an effect of our own senses" that are often wonderful liars and paint a very narrow but intense picture of reality that we believe without question
Theres no way you get that quantum fundamental particles dont have smaller part to them. Then im gona ask you to build these from the ground up so you an make a picdd red of wood.
And what makes it create itself? Why is there anything at all and why does it form anything? You aren’t getting back to the fundamental question, where and why does any of this happen? You’re answers are superficial at best.
Unless the present interferes with the past. ?
Maybe reality is real but is also a simulation for the purpose of understanding a greater reality that exists just beyond observation.
I sometimes feel like the Universe is the mind of a joker, made only to laugh and taunt its inhabitants: we live in the universe where we can see billions of worlds that we can't reach, write down the limits that we can't break, logic systems that invalidate themselves, mysteries that we can't solve and the moment we're close to anything that we may call "truths", we're left with more questions than we had before.
Love this kind of mind bendy stuff. Great video.   From the Kybalion:  The All is Mind; the Universe is Mental.  As above, so below; as below, so above.  Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates. Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.  Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.  Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause; everything happens according to law; chance is but a name for law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the law.  Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles; gender manifests on all planes. (two disparate anything, combined, will create something new)
This video makes our reality seem more and more like a simulation!!!
Waiting for the day when this channel is saying something like “they used to call it dark energy.”
Evolution of the  physical, mental  and spiritual processes, thoughts, and  actions create the future.  ❤️
ARE       YOU     ALIVE    OR     DEAD     UNTIL        YOUR        COFFIN     IS       OPEN          ???
It's at points like this that quantum physics, philosophy, and theology become great friends.
If scientists caused the big bang by playing a negative game of 20 questions with the universe, then I also caused Matt to upload his video to the YouTube channel I caused him to create by watching it. I don’t know what to call this but solipsism.
The thing about the 2 entangled particles which somehow communicate at a distance, even a distance of light-years, gives a good clue to the underlying nature of everything. The laws of symmetry: rotational, displacement in space and time etc all connected to conservation laws like conservation of angular momentum and momentum etc. Now the measured particle with spin “up” “causing” a distant entangled particle to have spin “down” happens because the law of conservation must be obeyed, even if things are light-years apart. So, it also tells us that the information about the up and down spins is more fundamental than distance. Therefore, we have evidence of an underlying informational universe more fundamental than our apparent physical universe. That much is clear.
The idea of observation in this sense really puzzles me. you really have to stop and posit, what counts as observation? in theory the interaction between two particles is "information" at its basest since but that doesn't seem to cover this.
Or could God still be creating? Just as plausible. At some point science becomes a belief too. Interesting.
hey lot of people will be waking up to the BELIEF of DREAMS are just waking moments in other realities where one of you are awake and very active prob on drugs or dying, this causes norepinephrine to spike which at it's peak is able to dissolve reality or shift perspective and unify with another version of reality . time may also be staggered in dreams meaning the future and past happen at the same time our experence only processes the information in linier time.
the universe is created by the collective mind   long as you tell no lies and safe guard truth that may be used against you.   before any discovery is found you need to believe the discovery exists and then try to witness any STRAND of reality that might lead to this discovery.
Wow, the participatory universe makes so much sense to me. This actually leads me to a very interesting idea: What if all possible universes do exist, but this universe is just the one in which I, (my conscious mind) exists? What if the only objective reality is a superposition of all possible states of the universe that could exist? In some versions of the many worlds hypothesis, the wave function collapses from the point of view of an observer, when the observer becomes entangled with the particle that is observed. The only observer that I know for sure to exist is myself ("I think, therefore I am"). So what if the superposition collapses from my point of view into the universe that eventually produced me. And everything I interact with collapses from the superposition and creates my reality. This seems like some egoistical, solipsistic point of view, but it also could mean that all possible minds do exist in their own universe, where the superposition collapsed to create them. This whole idea is sort of an anthropic principle, but instead of arguing based on the fact that humans exist, I argue based on the fact that I exist.
If this is right, wouldn't it mean that two observers could never exist in the same universe? And wouldn't that mean that we all literally exist in our own universe?
So based on the idea that "observation" could entail any interaction then the first "observation" would've occurred at the Big Bang. In that case, this philosophy would imply that the only real universe is a universe in which things are happening which I suppose would necessitate all universes to have at least one time dimension. This also brings up the question of will there ever be a state of our universe in which things stop happening? Like in the heat death of the universe is there still a quantum foam? Or will that stop at some point as well?  Also I wonder if a more accurate description of observations being any interaction could be that observations are any transmission of information? So you could have an interaction without collapsing the wave function (such as a double-slit experiment) that wouldn't count as an observation.
Schrodinger‘s cat is a ridiculous scenario. The cat does not exist in a state of life or death, it is one or the other. You’re observing of it does not change the fact. Is simply you acquiring the information of the state. It’s like black holes. We recently took the photo of our first black hole. The black hole did not exist in some sort of quasi-state of existence or non-existence prior to us observing it. it always existed.
Can you create a video on how much of the universe (space) is mapped in all four directions or 6 directions if you look from a sperical view.
Can someone swing by my house and check whether this episode made my brains leak out of my ears? I feel like it has, but I need an independent observer.
Will I win lottery? No. Will I win lottery? No. Will I win lottery? No. Will I win lottery? Yes. YES!
This is interesting: like an EXR or PNG image that re-renders itself as a JPG within a smaller memory footprint so in the next iteration the PNG can add new details to the image...
The voice over just sounds wrong for some reason.
Aww...I thought I had an original idea when I theorized the same thing several months ago...this keeps happening. This theory does raise the question of what made the first observation. What are the implications of this idea on the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-tester experiment? And if we create the universe by observing it, does that mean we destroy it by restricting its possibilities?  Hey, what if the universe somehow "unrealities" traits of itself to save storage space?
Shrodingers cat. why not poke the box the cat will react if alive lol.
The evolution of the universe is ridiculous. Energy can only spread, so how is the energy in the universe distributed regularly? If it's gravity, then the Earth should be cold, so gravity can only slow down the rate at which the universe is degenerating. Scientific theory says, gravity attracts matter so that it evolves. This theory is kind of like a fallacy of energy passing from low to high energy, and doesn't take into account the collision of atoms. Put the air into the vacuum and diffuse it by the collision. The evolution of the universe violates the theory of gravity: the gravity of the sun evolved the solar system, but I have never seen gravity evolve anti-gravity (the gravity of the earth). The Sun's gravity should prevent them from forming in the end. Evidence from the Big Bang proves that the universe has been degenerating (entropy increasing). In order to support the evolution of the universe, they had to insist that the universe evolved from an increase in entropy (degeneration). In order to avoid creationism, causing contradictions If the universe and living things formed by coincidence or randomness, it violates the laws of energy

I don't know man other than that substrate talk this  starting to sound sound like some Zen Buddhist Hinduism Alan Watts stuff. Don't be so sure about that substrate
so things only happen because things happen, thanks quantum physics, that makes total sense.
The soul is fact not faith and the soul is probobally a quantum phenomenon.
It seems as if as ling as there is motion, there is time....there is existence. Without the universe expanding and the things in it moving around, time wouldn't exist. So it sounds like he's saying because things move about, existence continues existing. Stop all things and you have no time and therefore no existence. I sounded smart for a second to myself.
I would like to see an episode about what science says about a neutron star inside a normal star, what happens or theories.
why is it that quantum mechanics resembles esoteric and philosophical text that speak of metaphysics?
Maybe try reading the Bible, that might help answer this oh so difficult question. Not like we've known the answer for thousands of years...
how come your head is so big and your body so small  ?!
I am shocked. This is what I have been thinking and talking about almost my whole life.  Absent the 'information' "it from bit" aspect. Of course, I may (perhaps must) have picked it up from different places but it sure doesn't feel like it. To me, it appears that Wheeler and I have understood reality from virtually the exact same perspective. I have been talking about this "sub-strait" for decades. I think of it as 'where we really are' but I have to justify that. Wow. This video blew me away!
So, then does observer and observed reality thus creates it's own reality, realities, timelines, parallel universes, multiverses, space time continuums, and so on? Is this what is being done? And if there is no "observer", would everything cease to exist? Also, then isn't this suggesting a "divine creator"? Who observed the universe from it's "beginning", or if it has always existed outside of what our mind can grasp and comprehend?  Personally, the universe created it's own self, in it's own infinite infinities. We are just an extention of the universe, created by the universe, to observe and experience the universe from another point of observed view. Oh, then would the universe have it's own self consciousness? All we are left with, is the current limitation knowledge, and have more questions than we have answers for.
What if every point in the universe already contained every fundamental particle but they were only apparent when 'activated'? And by activated I mean information travelling to the point telling it what to be, so if you point a laser it travels at the speed of light telling every point along the way to be a photon and providing the energy for the photon. Every transfer loses energy and so it fades away after a while. Might also explain dark energy too if all of that stuff is already there. Or not, I'm no physicist.
1:12 Oh, so Bohr is responsible for this anthropocentric and extremely stupid worldview of the universe. 3:51 Preach, Feynman. What a legend.
This sort of sounds like how in video games only stuff that the player can see/interacts with is rendered
Would this video have existed if I hadn't watched it?
I wish there  were other readers who could admit this is meaningless nonsense having nothing to do with reality or physics.   This is woo.
i love how the two cartoon physicists are a woman and a black   VERY REALISTIC
How does colapse relate to the ideas discussed? We know that the double slit experiment doesn't work with chunks of more than a few hundred atoms, reality as humans can see does not exist such as in an electron waveform, or entangled. Reality is discrete and only one exist on the macro level. Any ideas, anyone?
What happens if you have 2 lasers or transmitters where they send a random signal from each and it’s not possible to know which signal came from which transmitter?
What if the universe is expanding into itself?
Didn’t Paul Davies work on a similar strong anthropic kind of idea that the constants of nature have the values they do based on our ability to determine them - unless I’ve got that incorrectly observed (thereby nullifying my question…) I wonder if that work ever went anywhere…
This doesn't quite work out.  If in it's own vacum of possibility, maybe you can conduct this experiment.  But it really doesn't explain interactions of previous history / reality where there was no one to know or even experience that new thing.  And it definitely wasn't something previous people thought of or wanted.  (Or even didn't' want.)   Any sort of complexity seems to throw this idea right out.
4:11 most of the modern world inventions were not invented through quantum physics but could later be better explained by it. You don't have to know quantum physics to build a motor, nor a computer.
The concept of observation/interaction retroactively defining reality has always been really interesting to me, but not with quantum physics, instead, storytelling. Imagine this analogy: you're playing a video game, an RPG, and one of the characters asks what your player character's name is. You then get to choose your name, in that moment. But, within the story, that was *always* your character's name, for their whole life (presumably), and the only thing that happened there was that another person asked what it was.  Furthermore, there may be countless other players out there with countless other playthroughs choosing different names, all equally retroactively true to their specific game, or, perhaps, universe, but equally none of their characters will have any way of knowing about yours.
Guys…listening to this guy…..my beer’s going flat!!
So if "our" density is the same as that of a black hole of the same size, wouldn't "dark energy" just be the Hawking radiation on the other side of the cosmological event horizon?  Alternatively, if the "future" inside a black hole is pointing towards its center, then the event horizon is the past... which seems to be what we observe when we look out towards the cosmological event horizon, right? So what if it isn't the universe that is expanding, what if it is us (and everything that isn't spacetime) that is collapsing on itself in the direction of its future, stretching spacetime "inwards" instead of "outwards"? In this case the "dark energy" would simply be the mass of the universe in a different reference frame... How would we know the difference?  In other words, isn't the Big Bang just a Big Prolapse?
Pseudoscience.. Something went horribly wrong in the scientific world a long time ago
"Shut up and calculate" seems lika a based physicist way of looking at things.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
This feels really important…
"When you interrogate the universe, the answers you get depend on the questions you ask." Yes, it's called a normal conversation, except the word interrogate implies capture. Without correct torture, the answers gained from interrogation tend to be false.
So maybe we are in a simulation and new features and patches are added to our experience based on the questions we ask... 😁
Einstein: *comes up with relativity God: write that down! Write that down!
I am really confused about the statements made about the delayed choice experiment. You said that the second beam splitter could be placed after the photons had passed through the first beam splitter and had already "made their decision of which path to take". That doesn't make any sense to me, because a measurement still hasn't been made, until after the second beam splitter. So really it doesn't matter at what point in time you choose to place the second beam splitter right? Unless I'm missing something the next statement doesn't really mean anything either. You said "the choice of that measurement can be made after the superposition is formed", but the superposition continues to exist until a measurement is made and that doesn't happen until after the beam splitters and after the interference (both constructive and destructive). If that's the case, there was no "choice". Maybe I just don't understand...
Ok well that’s enough existential crisis inducing information for one day, see you tomorrow
It's pretty simple really, the universe is information based and when you alter the information in a [any] system you get a different possible result.
This is probably wrong, but wouldn't it be cool if the big bang wasn't simply an event in the past, but a singularity occurring "right now"? Instead of space moving inward towards the singularity, it would primarily be time rushing inwards towards the singularity in the "past". Our "present" would be stuck at the event horizon and would experience the future coming in from outside. That would create an interesting explanation for entropy.
idea: the more we know about the universe, the more it will create for us to understand, as in an infinite loop
It can also be seen in media, where a message is usually oncovered by the viewers and applied afterwards to current media.
"The process of interrogation ins one way creates reality" i swear this is the basis for "hitchhikers guide to the galaxy"
I'm sorry but the anthropomorphic animations are really annoying.
Schrodinger's thought experiment is flawed: it ignores the obvious inevitability of the cat itself tipping and breaking the flask. Or cats' usual enthusiasm towards being locked in tight spaces.
Strong Anthropological Principle seems more like a strong blunder. It's like flies on a dog arse resolving that the dog's arse must be smeared in feces because that is the only way it would sustain flies.  Resolution is of course a proper application of the copernican principle. Dog's arse don't care for the flies. They just happen to be an emergent property that is in for a ride.
Have long felt this way about the universe. I wonder if the set of "questions" that can be asked by each physically real particle, A, is constrained by whatever interaction collapsed A to begin with. Say B is collapsed into a 4 by C asking "what is a number between 1 and 10". Now B can only ask "what is a number between 1 and 4", A answers by collapsing into a 2.   This is a ropey analogy suggesting that electrons and photons are electrons and photons, because whatever collapses then to begin with can only "ask" a very narrow range of "questions", i.e the probability space is very tightly constrained by prior interactions.  This may seems a little obvious, but then perhaps you can go far enough back to eventually define a singular interaction describing the big bang. In a pre-universe information space where all possible "questions" can be asked simultaneously, one of the "answers" will inevitably collapse into the universe we observe.  As an aside, is it possible for a complex enough computational engine, fed information about other previous interactions, be able to further constrain the questions it can ask, in order to increase the likelihood of a particular answer. In other words, could a defining feature of consciousness be a weak form of "free won't", avoiding already "asked questions" in order to arrive closer to a preferred answer, on a macroscopic level.
No
So as such, if measured right, according to that theory, one could "change" the value of some yet undiscovered universal constants? If true that would be kinda funny. Reminds me of when futurama redefined the speed of light.
Mind blowing ideas!
Man, this episode is gonna be stuck in my head for the next week! lol...Thats alot to think on...
These kind of videos fascinate me, I don't study physics, I'm actually an MD, but somehow I have this feeling that pursuing the understand of wtf is going on around us should be considered our purpose, not as individuals, but of our collective existence, and in our current generation I feel frustrated on how our current challenges in understanding the cosmos seem so much more unsurmountable and (at least to me looking from an outsider perspective of the research field) we appear to be making much slower progress than in the previous centuries. Technology, manpower and resources should now be more plentyful than ever, but we appear to be stuck in an abstinence of breakthroughs, our predecessors probably had more intuitive and simple problems than we do now, but man I really wish we had those people's minds on our current days, and that more of the brightest minds from our generation were drawn towards studying these fields... I really thank you guys for these videos, you manage to make very complex topics very cohesive to understand and (most times) easy to follow throught the entire video. Please never stop making these and I envy you for your knowledge and talent to transmit it to us.
0:33 some say Reality is only about Agreement.
that´s the difference between an intelligent person and a genius
The multiverse is more or less a given. There is more logical evidence for than against, but also empirically. There are close to an infinite number of universes within this universe and holographic principles alone should be sufficient enough.  But regardless - try to entertain this thought: Given an infinite amount of paralell and/or asymmetrical universes, there must be a universe where entropy is reversed. It is a 100% replica of our universe, but with "time" going backwards. The inhabitants of this universe perceive everything just like us - it is a total carbon copy of our universe. But observed from the outside, that entire universe would flow backwards.  Who can say that WE don't live in such a universe? The only way to even begin to understand that our own entropy is reversed, is to observe it from another universe.  From the outside a flashlight would catch the light and the waterfall would flow upwards. How can such dimensionality be understood within the confines of our own entropy?
You simply cannot measure the speed of light even with Planck without an absolute zero reference point. The only place absolute zero exist in any universe is between the transition between the Event Horizon and the Singularity. That is the only place in this universe between two  dimensions where causality and relativity collapses and inverses. All light gathered is slowed down to a complete reverse point entropy.  It's impossible to fully understand the true speed of quantum space unless you're at the very boundary point between this universe and the next. A black hole is a complete entropy reversal. Absolute zero is not a theoretical null. There is a negative K spectrum, which in turn is a rise in temperature. But it is only "negative" from our perspective. Cross the boundary and negative Kelvin turns positive. From within the reversed entropy our "positive" Kelvin is observed as negative. Entropy reversed means absolute zero is only a transitional field, which result in a colossal and transformational dimensional shift. Beyond that point sizes don't matter anymore, because the energy exchange is so massive (hence the logical end point of relativity being black from our perspective and/or time never crosses the event horizon and/or time reverses within the singularity). One must fully understand that relativity reaches infinity-0 once it crosses the absolute light conversion of absolute space-time standstill, which results in a total collapse of causality. Entropy is "reborn" across the event horizon, which in turn re-establish causality in the singularity.  A black hole is ALSO a white hole. It's just a matter of perspective. From our perspective we see black, but statically viewed from within, between the EH and the S, we would observe nothing but light. Once you cross over into the singularity all light is converted to scrambled quantized space. The closest we'll ever get to observe the white hole echo of the white hole conversion is something we already have: the CMB. That is the only true White Hole within our observable universe. If we could magically send a camera venturing into another black hole pointing backwards, we could observe the reverse point entropy from within and beyond the EH before the S, we would see massive quantities of light. Crossing the boundary would render it all black until light is capable of traveling and forming when inflation/the black hole is mature enough. Once the camera crosses into the fully reversed entropy everything would go black because now the camera's time is again flowing forward from its perspective. From our perspective the camera would never cross the EH and would be frozen in time forever, but from its perspective it would be quantized and would dissappear into a quantum realm that is "unsized". On so on and so on. Relativity only exist within itself and within each universe. The property of even relativity might be unique to each universe and possibly unique to localised space and dimensionality. We operate with only 4 dimensions within relativity. That is a far too simplistic view of cosmic evolution and perspective. Relativity is far too linear to even explain its logical end point of a black hole.   In order to get a better understanding of how the universe work and operate, we need to implement spherical mathematics. Linear math is utterly incapable of delivering the fidelity needed to connect the dots, because the closer you get to Planck, the calculations will approach infinity and unifying different theories will by the defined fidelity be incompatible at quantized levels. Unifying spherically is no less complex, but at fine detail unifying is far easier, because the math will communicate better with circular understanding.   The distance from the event horizon to the singularity is infinitely long and infinitely short - *at the same time*.   A black hole is the ultimate result relativity,  which is proved by time dilation. But but time only exist within the very confines of relativity itself. Even time breaks down and reverses inside the event horizon, which in itself results in a complete collapse of the theory itself, because relativity states that time can never flow backwards, which it actually does inside the hole. Which again means that the theory must be cast aside. You simply can't have observation break the very principle it was postulated on.  Relativity tells us that such an object will exist, but it can't fully account for its own reversal, so then could it be fully accurate? Trying to merge relativity with quantum field theory is in itself proof that either one is null.  Would quantum theory in itself predict empirical findings of black holes?  No.  So how can you even begin to understand the end result of one theory with merging it with another ?  A black hole is in cosmological terms a double slit split between the fidelity in the two theories that try to explain it.  A black hole is in reality filled with light. It is black for the very same reason it was created  in the first place. Which is was/is a complete collapse of gravity, because core fusion couldn't be maintained. The different species of back holes are irrelevant to the effect inside them. Primordial BH's simply contain more time than pubescent holes. But then again, time doesn't truly exist in eternity, so how can we decide that something extremely far away is in reality older than?  But again, gravity is just a consequence of mass, which in turn is built of matter, which in turn is made of pure light.  So causality only exist within the speed of light which in turn is standing absolute still at absolute zero. When sufficien light is gathered  causality is reversed at the vertical point of the dimensional shift.  Transferring everything over to the other plane.  The event horizon is a vertical object and so is the singularity.  We observe causality as a black portal from our perspective. A more ore less perfect circle in space. But once you apply infinity to a circle, it too transitions through a point, which in its logical end point is a horizontal line. The spin of the hole is determined by this axis. A North/west-east rotational sphere of reverse entropied light.  Which in turn provided is with a double slit conclusion that the only thing that actually moves in space is matter itself.  Light is a quantum field permeating and is holographically projected in absolute zero, where time itself is a null exercise.  Which provides us with a 200% reversal of entropy. Time is an endresult of causality and causality can't exist in its forward momentum.  So which one is it?
The only way to comprehend the big bang is to not use time.  Go down to Planck  time and the fidelity in which you need to calculate approaches infinity.  But a Planck length time after the singularity arose, or what we define as the bang itself, might still be an infinity. It's all about reference and I've said over and over that time itself is non-existent. It's all motion. It's the CMB that in itself is near infinite, despite it originated from nano-time. The CMB doesn't need to originate from the big bang, because there simply was no bang at all!  The universe is eternal. The big bang event is real and THIS observable universe has 0 "time"/motion. The instant a sufficient supernova exploded. Creating a black hole and germinating its current universe.  Another universe is born within the black hole and the process is repeated forever.  The universe has no end or beginning, because it always have been and always will be.  There is a multitude of universes within all universes and the process never ends because it never started.  The holoverse permeates through all possible universes, so all universes is in effect inside all universes.  Quantum particles that "appear" to be virtual in our plane, might just be its twin component in an adjacent universe or dimension.  All there ever was and all there ever will be are always existing, because time simply doesn't exist.  Light doesn't move. It's space that does. We move in space, so we delude ourself that light speed is constant. It is in a way, referenced to space. The reason why we think light speed is constant is that nothing can travel faster than light, apart from space itself.   But light actually isn't moving at all!  It is the quantum field spiraling around a light beam that actually move, because light need space to travel.  We are using the wrong reference frames to measure light and it's nigh impossible to empirically measure the quantum field around a light beam.  The big bang might be measurable as a reverse point entropy, and that the singularity has "infinite density". But only if you use equated time.  Understand that the motion of space through the quantum field of light means that there simply is no upper speed limit in the universe, even for mass. Because the mass doesn't have to accelerate through space, it only has to accelerate through light.  This is proved by quantum entanglement.  There is no information paradox exactly because of quantum entanglenent.  Space doesn't experience time, light does.  And Hawking radiation doesn't even need to exist, because the information paradox is a null exercise. Even if Hawking is real, it has no consequence for the quantized transition beyond the Event Horizon.   The quantum entanglenent also proves that time is not a factor in space, only motion is. So producing or referencing speeds that are faster than light is perfectly doable, given you have the right materials and sufficient energy.  But that also breaks relative momentum, because suddenly we see that mass passing by each other are only moving themselves. The light is standing perfectly still, it's the space itself that is moving the mass.  This provides us with probable cause to produce enough E to travel at C or even >C, because M is moving through C and not the other way around.  💦😋🌈
short answer: no
this video touches on the suggestion I put in your survey.. before I saw this..... did the question cause this video?!!  No, but this is very thought provoking and an excellent topic to explore, thank you and please keep digging at this.
The Vedas seem to describe the same thing.  The only truly reality is an infinite and eternal white noise/light, which contains all the possible frequencies of sound/light.  The Mind of Being chooses which frequencies to ignore and which to pay attention to, thus creating a finite "reality" out of opposites. Sort of like a cosmic Light Brite, a toy that makes pictures by only letting light through in a chosen pattern.  This allows for the possibility that all possible realities and times coexist simultaneously and alternative "realities" may be accessible if the observer can just change the channel, or rearrange the Lite Brite pattern, so to speak. Carlos Castaneda alluded to this as an explanation for how magic operates, or at least expanded consciousness.  However, as noted in the video, the specific questions an observer is able to ask in order to "create" a specific reality is largely hard wired into the very structure of the observer's own neurological and physiological characteristics, which were inherited from life's evolution. A cat can only experience the frequencies of the specific reality it was born into. Likewise for humans.
m>c9(+/-)~44÷9-/4[(-/+4)(8³-m²)]=cm>8÷T Good luck with this one. Hope it helps. 😎❤️  Only a short derivation. The "end" equation is just a work of beauty. Mind you this is slightly simplified, but it's an important part to understand the rest of the function.  I'll come back later with more pieces.
Universe: *Hands participation trophy to itself*
❤️🙏🌞
saw the mini-documentary with you in it at the American Museum of Natural History!
I really don't like the Schrodinger's cat experiment, because we're talking about an irreversible event (the death of the cat). So if the event that judges the outcome has a change of death >0 for a period of determined time that is less than the period that the observer is waiting before taking a measurement, or even worse there's a period of changing states for the judging event, then the chance of finding the the cat in a dead state should be considered almost close to 100%... I feel different if the outcome is for example a direction or any non irreversible permanent state.
This idea is brilliant
The notion that an aware brain can't manipulate reality is demonstrably false. I watch Elon do it around the clock. When I get done with him you could be eliminated for doubting. Speak to the asteroid and it shall be moved. Because in the face of certain annihilation that's all you really got Commander Cleverton.
My amateur theory so far: according to ER=EPR, quantum entanglement is sort of an equivalent to wormholes and it defines the spacetime geometry / gravity. Observation and consciousness (a conscious observer can "make a choice") could be just a higher level of entanglement interaction. The more entangled particles are, the more entropy/hidden information there is (we observe just one possibility, others are hidden and with other and other entanglements the number of possibilities rises enormously). So the only thing independent on interaction or observation are maybe vibration states of strings distinguishing the elementary particles and all the reality is just a multi-layered and more or less free fishing of particular information in a continuously enlarging ocean of superpositioned possibilities :-)
Answers (reality) is always there whether or not conscious interest is peaked or whether a question is asked that it answers if this was not true we would never know 1+1=2 or that 1 and 1 is 11 so to think that our observance or presumption of without consciousness existence would be in constant indecisiveness would be very smug of those and their theories the universe has existed of its own Accord and will continue on long after we fall short of believing that observance (our observance) is what gives everything in the universe it's path in its life and if you take all light magnetism static chemical nuclear energy etc. What is left that can still affect the rest that is left is reality at it's core you can only have fake virtual and alternate in the light
Sure, except on weekends. The universe watches sports on the weekends. And the cat in the box is alive - maybe. Haven't looked yet.
The creation is the creator.
Does the Universe create itself? Is the Universe perpetual?
Oh my god. Vivec was right!
Can we think that "c" (the so called speed of light) is a sort of escape velocity for any material particle to some kind of interactions?
I did not understand anything 😢
I never had a problem with the observer in quantum mechanics. A neighboring particle in any possible combination functions as an "observer" as it cannot interact with the superpositioned version of the other atom. It's wavefunction had to collapse in order to make an interaction possible.  A photon that is absorbed by an electron caused the electrons wavefunction to collapse, thus the photon becomes a functional observer. It is like any particle that is about to interact with another atom, proton, electron or whatever entitiy you can name, causes the respective wavefunction to collapse. An electron cannot convey energy if it is still in a superposition state that is uncertain about impulse, velocity or location. It needs to have a collapsed wavefunction, in other words the object hit by the electron needs "the answers to react properly". The wavefunction needs to collapse to have a certain energy, impulse, frequency, spin or whatever to make a given reaction happen. I think physicist had a tendency to get confused by the words "measurement" and "observer", every interaction causes a wavefunction to collapse, it forces "a decision" or "answer" as you put it in your episode here. No conscious keeping track of information is involved. A measurement or "act of observation" can be any type of plain old physical or chemical interaction between any type of entities. Obviously the reality around also proves this, the solidity of objects is based on the fact that a solid object is made up of a dense network of compounds or atoms that constantly demand "answers" from their neighbors, there is not much of superpositioned states going on for those atoms. This results in the world we see, not much quantum effects happening, because the wavefunction is basically in a collapsed state almost all the time. Only once we start to dissect the physical world, by observing single atoms and single photons, "observation" becomes something scarce and special. In reality the "act of observation" the "interrogation of reality" is going on constantly all the time between all the objects that cross each others path in spacetime.
for partial spins, fractal space filling stuff ya know...
the number of times its fully rotates around for spin, the timestep delay for spotaneous mass manifestation.
This video gives a whole new meaning to Douglas Adams' "big question" (Life, the Universe and Everything). It is just a matter of time, before someone asks a question that breaks the game. Great. Now I have a new type of anxiety.
Ghost waves, mass manifestation, timestep tau from yin (thought domains) to yang (actual mass manifestation),
the beginning, automated processes, unkowing, does something exist apart from those automated processes, then the next phase is gradual knowing, like the planet, and the biosphere of the dinosaurs, low levels of knowing, mostly automate but a bit differentiated, then KNOWING with the tool makers began, templates for kosmoses I wonder... so 1) automated templates, fractal expansions into space ... 2) etc etc
Maybe if the man had more strength to look in the places that had to much woo, he may have found something.
11:16 Only conscious minds do have direct power over reality when instantiated as life specifically human life. Over time with enough power and energy man has built all that we see around us and abstracted it from the ever present now and with it the insights that drive the mind. We are avatars of flesh and blood inhabited by points of creation itself made manifest to actualize all of potential. Physical reality is an abstraction of the original energy state of reality and the construct of every mind is the place in which there is a piece of something akin to creation living inside.   If this is not God then I dunno what is. Do not however mistake yourselves for the wave. You're merely a bit of the foam upon the crest it creates as it crashes upon the shore. It is when people begin to think they are the wave itself that we all suffer for it. We know it as the ego and the devil of man. This is why all of reality is dualities and their variances. Except the ever present now. A point of energy bound by space, time and probability inhabiting an avatar built of flesh and blood, given a brain only to discover it is more than any one man could ever discover. With all the power of creation it wished for just one thing.... meaning. Here we are, now what will we do with it?  13:25 that's a whole lot of tongue wagging to just to say there is no God lol. It's almost like you're having to dodge the question but that is ok as that is the role of those who are capable of defining things to the degree that they even have to begin to question themselves at all. I like to think of it as analgias to the inception movie in that if you become absorbed with the idea that we are nothing but the material reality then how could you be abstracted from it upon death. But if you know for certain more awaits beyond your flesh and blood being rendered back from whence it came then who knows what may save you. Either way I think it's important to realize that it is energy which creates us and not us which creates energy or perhaps and most likely it's  a bit of both.
Why is realism so important? It's like clinging to phlogiston theory. Shut Up And Calculate is a perfectly satisfactory worldview.
IF the universe is shaped by observation or "20 questions", then one of the following must be true:  - the universe is point-shaped - information about how the universe works, as shaped by observers, travels instantaneously across the universe - the universe does rollbacks when conflicts arise  The thought experiment is that some scientist (or observer) on Alpha Centauri establishes reality at odds with with earth bound observers.  The rollback is a term borrowed from distributed computer simulation, where if you end up with inconsistencies, have to roll back time to resolve these :-)
reality is created upon observation
I'm lost. How does a laser going through two beam splitters only hit one of two detectors and how does that mean that the entire universe is superpositioned on the macroscale until it interacts with something?
we do create our lifes don't we, but how can exist something we are not aware of, well that's why some kind of "higher inteligence" should exist
So here's my take: you don't need a brain to observe the universe.  Say you're a photon going though space, minding your own business.  You pass by a black hole.  Your eyes are the sides the photo, and you observe that the side closer to the black hole is a little slower than the side away from the black hole.  And so you curve.  When you encounter another atom's electrons, you observe the increased friction between you and the atom you just hit, which may cause you to stop being a photon and start being an excited electron for a while, or you observe the friction abruptly dropping, signifying that you weren't absorbed and instead reflected off the atom.
I ran the idea of "entanglements within entanglements" by my physicist cousin in order to observe both quantum results simultaneously, and I used a Schroedinger "zombie cat" as an example. Told him I think you can observe both results simultaneously, that was what I wanted because "I'm greedy"...he got a chuckle from that, but the entanglements idea peaked his interest.
The more you seek the more you will find
It’s a realist tendency to view the past as certain and the future as uncertain, but doesn’t this all make more sense if you apply a bit of time symmetry to uncertainty? Some things in the present are fundamentally uncertain and can be made certain by a particular interaction. Likewise uncertain things in the past can be made certain (delayed choice) and uncertain things in the future can be made certain (entanglement at a distance) in the same way.
Bruh pls no <.<
Bruh no :/
Maybe it is time itself that is the fundamental observer. While humanity defined it, the universe cannot undergo changes or interact without a point A and a point B, or a before and an after.
transcend
Boring not getting anywhere does the multiverse exist and where? Did the universe create itself?
Is this a question?
I see the universe like highly condensed energy wave length that create matter and mass.
imagine world where you could not lift your arm with your own observation or sense someones feelings or feel your memories  -quantum woo  (every antenna works both ways, same goes with senses)
What if before the big bang there was matter that kept being pushed in to a certain point until it could no longer contain it, the out side of the univerce did not like the force from inside and basicly it moves away from the univerce but the univerce is attracted to the out side ,at one point the out side tried to contain it for a second time ...but inside the univers someting happend so it caused the second big bang and ever since the univerce is trying to catch the uncatchable the more the univerce exspands the faster the out side moves away ,also if the out side takes on the same properties as the quantum relam then maybe are univerce took on some of that what i mean is that on the out side things can exsist and not at the same time are univerce got lucky and became a reality and can nolonger be effected by the out side other than to catch it but it can never get to it but are univerce is constantly creating new reality so all the outside that can and can not exsist is only exsisting once are univerce interacts with the new space thats created hope that kinda makes sence
Ffs
If we accept that humans have a conscious brain. And if we accept that humans are part of the universe, then I don't see the problem (yes, I might be stupid). Look up the meaning of the word "interaction". It takes two to tango (sorry, to interact). The universe, and humans. So, if an asteroid falls on Pluto, but nobody notices it. Did it fall? No, not to all intend and purpose, it didn't. Until we observe the crater, and we then assume a something has fallen on Pluto. We realise consciously, something happened in the past. We sort of interacted with Pluto, the asteroid and our consciousness. From experience we can assume that asteroids fall on planets all the time. But that is only self interaction with our own consciousness, which is part of that universe. Therein lies the problem. Is our consciousness part of the universe, or merely interacting with it? I think it is part of the universe and thus never independent from the surroundings or objects of observation.
"All matter originates and exist only by virtue of a force... and we must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. The (that) mind is the matrix of all matter."... ~ Max Planck, Quantum Author and Physicist.  Utilizing a "Big Bang" mindset, to verifiably reverse construct the initial force of the Universe, is like trying to reverse construct the equation that produced a numeric result, from the resulting numeric... i.e. 10^-43 sec. does not satisfy acceptable criteria for an investigation into a "fundamental" unifying FORCE.  In the interest of relevant info dissemination, in previous 04/27 post I provided a link to the You Tube History of the Universe channel's discussion of the Fermi Lab Muon Wobble investigation, but the post was rejected by PBS Space, so I have eliminated the link from herein.  In that Fermi Lab's Muon Wobble analysis, undermines the 4 force dictate of the "Standard Model", the assumption that all mass in the Universe was created in a single event, warrants reassessment.  In the interest of disseminating resolve of the mathematics for a Single Point Sourced Pulsed Emission, which facilitates non-perturbative analysis of the mechanix inherent in a single unifying fundamental FORCE, I have herein eliminated the link to the UQS Matrix Mechanix website's evaluation of LMU CQST D. Oriti's analysis of the TETRAHEDRON as a candidate for a minimum/indivisible Quantum of Space (QI) to facilitate a logic quantization structure for an emergent Cosmic Intelligence Network, from my 04/27 PBS Space Time channel post.  The continuous UQS Pulsed Emission, facilitates a Cosmic Networked Intelligence...i.e. unconstrained info dissemination throughout the Universe... and the QE-Mechanix that emerge on Pulse-8-Close, justify one's experiments to establish a connection.  May the FORCE continue to resolve spontaneous, harmonious distribution of minimum/indivisible quanta of spatially defined Energy (QE), throughout the entire Universe, on every pulse tick (QT) of the quantum clock.

I think either Objective Realism or Superdeterminism is true. Current quantum mechanics ignore gravity at the atomic scale. ORCH OR takes it into account. But superdeterminism is also a plausable option. Regardless, I have to wash my laundry.

imagine shitting on philosophers then saying stuff like this in 2022 when philosophers have been saying this for literally thousands of years lmfao
I would like to know what a very small "closed universe" would look like? I would think I can see my own back as I look forward. Would I be able to lasso myself then pull myself? I wouldn't move, right? Lets say that lasso is some sort of attractive force? Would that attractive force not actually be able to pull an object closer to itself, but actually hold itself in place...
What does the Participatory Model say when Gov. taxation goes above 50 % for ordinary people ?
A theory I have that states that gravity is more or less molecules of similar compositions being pulled towards each other with higher concentrations of a particular group of molecules having a greater influence then a lower group of similar molecules
Why observer has to be conscious? A cat is alive in a box. A Geiger counter observes (better to say detects) a particle. The detection causes wave function to collapse. The cat is dead. Who needs scientist to open the box to make an observation. It has already been done  by the Geiger counter. There never was a superposition of the cat itself.  The detection breaks a vial with poison. No particle detection - the cat is alive. No observer (i.e. a Geiger counter) the cat is definitely alive. But observer is a Geiger counter, not a scientist. Where is a paradox?  Likewise. @10:58 Their observations *now* cause the Big Bang *then*. Even with "sort of" - not correct. Before "Their observations" there were  billions upon billions observations, detections and interactions. By no means "Their observations" was THE FIRST one.
ebig
I do always wonder if those old universe photons have a huge smeared wave function until they hit our telescope.
I don't really see how does this solve anything, without defining what an observer actually is. Without that, this is really just philosophy, not physics.
If the Universe is Infinite, has no beginning nor end, creates and destroys, maybe has consciousness... Then, is it GOD?
The questions game is an accurate description of Absurdle
the negative 20 questions game doesn't start with one participant thinking about nothing... they are actually thinking about "everything" that they "know"
and this is the reason why law of attraction is possible. we manifest our future with the power of our thoughts and emotions. in one of your previous videos you denied the law of attraction. but with this new information, i hope you can agree that we live in a universe where frequencies we resonate in, is the future we manifest.
Funny how quantum physicis has scientist back where they began... As philosophers
So measurement happens every time particles bump into each other and become entangled. Given the fact that the universe seems to be created out of a singularity/ a super dense state, all particles should be entangled by now. Is there some process of Quantum Detanglement? Or do they simply detangle once their states are measured? pls correct me if I am wrong.
This -20 questions game reminds me of how the gnostics perceived the beginning of it all
I don't think I'll even bother watching... There's no possibility of anyone being able to answer this question.., soooo, of what use is pure speculation --- pure science fiction -- when it comes to such an absurd problem? Do you know anyone that was "there" to witness the beginning of the Universe? --- Now, that's a question that can be answered. --- Do you know anyone that will be "there" at the end of the Universe? Someone that can observe and then, travel back in time to share their observations and measurements? --- No? Are you sure? Be honest... Don't you know a guy that knows a guy.., that just might know another guy? Come on! Spill the beans. I'll even listen to some good science fiction. One irrefutable fact from Einstein is demonstrated in these discussions; "The only infinite thing in the universe is the human capacity for schtoo-pidity.." (just a little paraphrasing) Intelligence, education, and articulocity are no barriers to the schtoop dimension... And sooooo seriously presented!  Here's a riddle for ya; If observation creates reality, who or what was "there" at the beginning to solidify the beginning? And who or what was "there" all along during the following Billions! of years, to keep the universe solid and steady.., until we little wee ones were able to take over? Anything that could fill those requirements, are by definition, God... And we can't have that, can we? (No Evidence! -- as if there was any evidence for these speculations. LOL!) Sorry to break the news, but... none of us, including any of you, are that significant.
It's amazing how modern physics is getting closer and closer to the ideas of the ancient Yogis (and no, not the modern new agey and kooky interpretations).  The Yoga Sutra says that enlightenment is when we can distinguish between the observer and the observed!  Sounds a lot like : "Not consciousness but the distinction between the probe and the probed" Wheeler (18:43 in video).  Yoga philosophy also states that reality is only "real" in the present moment, past is memory and future is imagination; and that our reality is created by and dependent upon the make up of our mind.  We do not create the world, it exists independent of our mind, but our experience of it differs depending on the unique make up of our mind... and so much more!
Well, let's see.  If some ppl think this presentation is gibberish and PBS Space thinks it good...then it's both good and gibberish.  Then once the observed ppl vote more thumbs up...then it's conclusive...the presentation is good! Yet, later on when more ppl view this and they vote the presentation to be bad...then a quantum shift occurs & the results go back in time to correct for the current measurement & everyone sees the results of that correction as bad!
I am wondering if the quantum world is more a set of rules describing the fundamentals of the world we create using our own tools of observation (our senses), which exists in our mimds, and are in turn describing the shared existance that we are immersed in and separated from by the barrier we pierce with our perceptions. Not the actual world but the world being formed by us and for is that is a reflection of the outside world.

Using words like "observation" to describe these quantum interactions confuses the public in the same way that Krauss's use of "Nothing" does. I don't think these words are good choices to describe the phenomena as it lends it'self to misunderstandings and woo. It hijacks colloquial usage for more complex and inappropriate purposes, it's why we have christian apologists using the language of a universe from "nothing" as a point of ridicule, and Chopra making up a bunch of insane stuff about observation and quantum physics. People then are rightly confused when they watch videos like this and fail to see the full distinction, as many in the comments here will inevitably highlight.
The universe itself is aware of itself (even without conscious animals observing it) in a sense. That's what I think, but it's a philosophical idea that can't really be scientifically proven or disproven.
The best way to piss off a physicist is to shrug and say, "I dunno, sounds a lot like God to me."
Substrate? Oh, you mean God.
Hawking radiation requires pairs of virtual particles being separated, but assumes they will be combined inside the black hole.  Can 2 particles that enter a black hole ever meet?  Or could this radiation actually lead to an increase in mass in both the black hole AND the rest of the universe?
As an anthropology student strongly engaging with ideas drawn from phenomenology I find this debate within physics the most exciting by far I have ever heard of.
How feasible is timelessness?
No, there's obviously a Creator. Or maybe not. Or maybe both, or neither? How can you be so deluded as to believe to be able to "step outside" and figure out the true state/nature of something you are completely confined in?
When the first consciousness arose, the universe started to exist retroactively. Both time and space are just illusions.
Lovecraft was right: Azathoth's dream created the Omniverse.
This is a fantastic notion
Meaning all particles are entangled to some degree in this theory. It always amazes me the sheer number of gauge bosons required to be exchanged between our planet and an H atom orbiting it just to define that tiny interaction.
Strange to learn, to me, at least, now that Wheeler said before pretty much what I started thinking over time as I got older. Feels weird. I couldn't even explain why I think these things to my friends ad family. They probably still think I must be crazy.
this reminds me f the ctmu
So if the entire universe DEPENDS on the choice of measurement, does that mean that the universe is DEPENDENT on their being life, in one form or another, to perform that measurement( be it with technology or simply witnessing it)? If that's the case then their being life outside of earth wouldn't be just a "possibility", it would be a REQUIREMENT. Because something in the universe happening in the universe, only to be witnessed or measured billions of years later would be the exact same thing as the laser being fired first and then having the reflector put into place. Wouldn't it?
So, if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it does it make a sound? Or does it fall but makes no sound? Or maybe it doesn't fall but still makes a sound?
This is actually the most interesting vid you’ve made so far
God created the universe
Release date: 4.20. Checks out.
"The universe a self closed solitary circuit". Is that the same thing as a "thought"?
We (conciousness) literally create reality via observation. Observation/perspective is Everthing that's why hundreds of Billions of $s are spent  on marketing, "news"/propaganda, andmilitary psy ops.
ARgh, how has the word "causality" not been mentioned once in this video?!?!?
is he ok? he seems extremely sick on this video
You just described a bad way to measure. Yes, the reliability and truth of your outcome as well as the measure of error depends on your method of measurement. That doesn't mean that you're changing reality. There's ways to fictitiously come up with a false claim. That's just a lack of justification. This stupid conversation keeps on digging deeper and deeper into an obsession with equivocating all justifications just so that you can pretend like a lack of justification or poor justification is as equally valid as a better one. Shut up and calculate.
We create reality there is no it that does anything.
Honestly I'm surprised PBS Spacetime covered this topic before it did Verlinde's entropic gravity.
**42** starts to make more & more sense!
11:25, the role of consciousness is only important in the design & analysis of the experiment, not in the measurement. Unless, you want to say that every particle has some degree of consciousness about the fields it is within, and that is essentially true, and dictates the dynamics of the physical system. 12:05 :)
It would be interesting to watch a discussion with Graham Harman
Wheeler’s philosophy elides an important factor which is that in -20 questions the “observer” is simply eliminating real possibilities with each question which further constrains their following questions.  Meaning that the “universe” isn’t “deciding” as each question is asked, simply that the “observer” loses the ability to conceive of questions off their path. And so they fall deeper and deeper into a locked paradigm with each question.   Like a “choose your own adventure” book. It’s All THERE. But, certain lines of interaction mean the ability to see the “other pages” goes away as each interaction moves the story in a more and more confined direction.  The only solution being an “Inspired Insight” generating a paradigm shift when a Newton or an Einstein “flips back” to parallel another track which adds to larger understanding of the whole.   -20 questions is a codification of “when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”  Or as Feynman encouraged, just do the science and don’t philosophize with preconceived notions.
Some roofies or Matt? I think I go for Matt 😮‍💨
Hi Matt, are you ok? I don't want to presume but I've noticed an unsettling look in your eye lately, and a manner of presenting info that seems out of character for you (as compared to the videos you were uploading ~5 years ago). I don't want to sound too critical of you but sometimes your cadence doesn't align with the info you're presenting--as if you're reading just to get through it, & doing your best to sound engaged but your mind is somewhere else. And I can almost feel that same thing emanating from the way you look into the camera. I hope I'm just imagining it all, in any case. I love the content. But if you ever feel even for a second that this work is starting to drain you, I would feel much better knowing you're taking care of yourself, even if it means giving up hearing your amazing presentational style.  Whatever the case may be, I'm grateful for the years of steady content you've provided! & I hope fame hasn't started to ruin you as it has so many before you! Please take care of yourself!
Could our increasingly accurate observations of the outside universe, coercing it to crystallize into a more particle-centric reality, somehow be the actual "force" that is causing it to flee away from us?
But who was the 1st observers to view the 1st big bang?
.
hello! I'm looking for an episode where you showed a sound comparison of spinning pulsars / neutron stars. Can someone tell me where it was? I remember it was just and 'addon' to episode about slighlty different topic.
Maybe an episode about inside the event Horizon. Can you go faster than light inside the event horizon? Can you orbit the singularity? How does the singularity spin inside the horizon? Is a singularity smaller than a plank cube/sphere?
What if it takes the wrong measurement?
Does a dream, dream it's self!? In Standard stable waveforms, Alot of werid is going on inside.
/S If you believe existence requires you to observe something for it to exist, I have a test for you. Turn around, and close your eyes. I’m going to throw a rock at your head. Oh before I do, which pocket is your wallet in?
So dark energy is pushing the "flat" spacetime towards the future due to nothing being on the other side of the "flat" spacetime. Consider tho that it isn't flat but having a reverberating wave.
Going to put you on my phone
Wheeler had some wacky ideas for sure. I guess if you combine this one with the other hypothesis he was famous for you get a single electron that constantly travels through time to appear whenever anyone looks for it.
what if it's... Unreal?
God I love this show
How can something be created from nothing lol. I think the only proof that can be verified is our current world and how all the systems operate.
That moment when physics become philosophy.
james woods must play shrodinger
Is it possible for the Big Bang and a supermassive black hole to have some kind of relationship? Is it possible for the components of matter and energy compressed at the center of a black hole to overcome the force of gravity compressing it? If this were the case did we have one big bang or do we live in a popcorn bowl of exploding black holes over the scale of time we can't even comprehend?
Thanks dark energy 😊
So for billions of years, bacteria were just asking simpler questions
Aaand imagine, why human observers themself should even exist, if no outside observer would exist to begin with? And lets close the loop from quantum physics to religion :)
Question:  In looking at the state of an object, what happens if the process of looking at whether an object is a wave or a particle, you cause it to change state into a particle ie collapse the wave into a point expression of existence.  This fits the idea that asking the question changes the behaviour of an object because asking the question actually changes the energy states and expressions of the system.  In language if you could ask the question remotely, ie changing nothing physically within the experiment then it would truly be asking a question in ones mind changes the result.  But as far as my understanding of the double slit experiment you actually measure the item to know where it is, so changing its state, not asking a remote question at all.
So, all time exists at once. Existence requires observation. Therefore, the universe coming into existence guaranteed life so that there would be some form of observer. If live wasn't viable in the universe, the universe would instantly cease to exist at the moment of creation. Universes that fail to support life could be springing into and out of existence in a quantum moment all the time?
Maybe the scale matters at all levels. At the quantum level the world behaves differently and reality is experienced differently. At the physical level in our scale the world behaves one way and we experience it in a 3-d space traveling through 4-d space-time. At galactic level there may be a different level of experience we are unable to perceive, and maybe time again loses it's significance?
I've followed all these talk with considerable interest and usually with at least a modicum of comprehension, but I'll admit that this one made absolutely no sense to me at all.
Again, all this quantum weirdness simply because we refuse to give up free will.
,,, jk saz :: even fo' US Spoiler spacetime lurkers,, this is funetoystyxistick-taintitt?!! ...
Ok, I love this topic, but my brain hurts thinking of some of this and many of the very smart comments below. Perhaps we over think this as it drives even the best minds crazy and the more we try to pick it apart to understand the madder it drives us.  maybe i am completely off here and missing understanding (most definitely), but looking at it from a different perspective and asking some basic questions: Viewing the evolution of the universe since the big bang, and the gradual development of complexity from the most basic particles to more and more complex elements, until you get the emergence of life and consciousness (which seems to go against the second law of thermodynamics drive toward entropy) -  is it not that the universe is "simply" a system that is hard wired to manifest consciousness?  Additional - not viewing consciousness (as we understand it from our own perspective) as an end-state, but rather as part of that continual evolution of complexity. Thus basic, simple life having the most basic, simplest level of consciousness, through to self awareness (as we understand it) and beyond. If the natural order is to drive toward entropy, how then do we then get the formation of more and more complex and ordered systems along that journey? What is it that seemingly swims against the tide (crossing over to Philosophy here)?
If you could manage to locally turn back time, would a wave of dark energy rush in that space-time buble and return things to normal? I'm asking for a friend :)
Could anyone explain me please who are the black guy meme, and now he's partner black girl? They're cute and fun but I have never understood the joke
Should do a show on the experiment that proved conscious thought affects physical matter  and distance didn’t factor using a blind double slit experiment and online participants.
The Universe being created by its observers in essence means the Universe exists because its parts are interacting with each other. But I think it's the other way around. Observers exist because parts of the universe interact. I have no problems imagining universe without interactions, it would just be kinda dull. But there would be nobody in it to claim it's created by observation.
Oh snap, are we about to do constructor theory?
in short, we're all just Orks who have willed the universe into existence against its will
Who's the funny looking black "professer" in alot of your videos? His hair is awesome!!
So...kind of like a videogame but observing it is basically like turning on the thing that the videogame is on. It could explain where we go when we die(This is a wrong way to look at things but at least it allows me to ingest what you put on the table with this video)
I'd like to see a video tackling possibilities for navigation at light speed.   A topic that seems neglected when talking about faster than light travel.
Idk, man. Sounds like a simulation to me. Only render what you have to lol
Great opening!!
so it is like how a minecraft world is generated?
I don't know why physicist immediately dismiss the idea that consciousness is the factor needed to collapse the function.  What evidence is there against it?  There is none.  Any such evidence would be impossible to analyze, since it would require consciousness to view the results, adding it back to the equation. Seems like an assumption in lack of evidence.  Isn't that bad science?
If this theory is true, it means there's no place to the human evolution theory then, n'or vice-versa, because "reality did exist" meanwhile consciousness didn't
Isn't it very human centric to say, "oh the universe doesn't exist unless I observe it." Very ego centric
I understand this line of thinking.  I believe that conciousness exists on the Quantum level. I also believe that conciousness is created when information is exchanged and stored or collected. I think that everything in the universe is connected. And that matter has conciousness. This is how crystals grow, water collects in clouds, and all other forces of the physical world have equilibrium. But life forms give the conciousness of matter its senses.  Every life form senses parts of the universe, and is able to observe its surroundings. This information can be collected and stored within the energy and matter of our universe.
Oh...PBS is making videos on one of the most cliched, over used and laughably wrong interpretation of the double slit experiment and Schrodengers cat idea.. New Age Bullshit has no place in science.
We are all figments of our collective imagination
The Common Sense Law of Knowledge states: "The more answers you have the more questions become created.   To: "Hope the universe doesn't run out of questions."
The shiii I watch when I smoke😧💫
We are using all of these amazing telescopes to look at light from the past. Is there any way we can create a "telescope" that acts as a flash light? So we can look into the "darkness" of space.
Would that be Type 7 entities or civilization?
it feels appropriate that this episode came out on 4/20
Meowth thats rite aid
I love pretending to understand PBS Space Time videos
Any interesting theories or maths that were recently proven/disproven through new experiment's results worth mentioning in the comments section of a future episode?
I really liked Smolin's off-hand - prolly meant to be absurd - notion that "when Mary opens the box, but I can't see what Mary sees, then Mary enters a superposition of having seen a dead cat and having seen a live cat?". Like, what's so absurd about that? Mary's probably a hologram anyway, right? Edit: ahh, I spoke too soon (2:55). That's actually what this vid is about :D 5:22 - ofc, the Void Which Binds... 6:24 - seems to me that "Particle!" is magical thinking... 7:08 - ohh, after years (around 1.6 of them) of thinking I'm dumb or crazy or sth, I finally get it: the "delayed choice" part is a lie - there are no delays in zero time. Jesus! The pop-memification of things knows no sacred ground! 10:12 how about "the observers - rocks; and the observed - meatbeags"..? With fewer constant chemical reactions, the longevity of "self" should be longer, yes? 14:55 seems more intuitive that it expands out of the future, into the past - no? The Past is far out there, the Future is so close that it's imaginary? If I remember my high school geometry right... 16:10 well... we've got the CMB and we (i.e. universe) appear to be losing mass, right? 16:57 different universe, bro... (also, see: "conformal cyclic cosmology", for geometric inspiration :) 18:00 suppose this wordplay: "this black hole is just below the critical mass density to avoid recollapse" - we suppose (or is it "we know"? i forget... "we hope?") that all black holes eventually evaporate through hawking rads. So.. believing by this analogy, one could perhaps say that a closed universe is impossible? Or if one existed, it would eventually eat all others, having an unbreakable export deficit...
Does the universe create itself? I don't know, maybe. Probably.  I'm hungry
I wanted to know whether  the universe created itself or not but instead I got 7 hours sleep.
love how this was posted on 4/20
I'm probably completely over-simplifying -- or worse, misunderstanding -- but if you strip away the rest of the episode, and focus only on the 20 questions, it sounds to me like the entire set of information that constitutes our universe (at both a big and a small scale) is too complex for our senses to see or for our minds to comprehend all at once.  And each time we play 20 questions, we are able to focus in on a small portion of the information that makes up the universe (once again, this can be a small informational portion cosmologically or quantumly).  And so, each proverbial game of 20 questions just provides us with a different window into something which in its entirety is too *something* for us to comprehend.
Thank you Mark Evans for supporting the channel!! Im a young entry level engineer not making much but I feel obligated to donate and support after watching this channel for so long. Never stop PBS Space Time !

„Shut up and calculate!“
Who are the Southpark style of characters? Specifically the guy.
hhhmmmm what is the universe...? have to think but I loved the vid...
Sorry, just a kid who is interested in astrophysics, but if the universe is constantly expanding, then how have galaxies crossed the event horizon?
I think reality,  or the Universe,  is different for each individual.  If participatory,  whatever we expect (good or bad),  we get in "our" observed  Universe (reality). Pessimists will get their fears, optimists - their rewards.  BOTH happy knowing- or believing- they are right. Maybe, our existence is very private (unique for everyone) and we get (or are given) what we expect (observe). Multiple realities,  parallel universes. Life is a gift. We were put here to be happy, including being "happy" in misery (depression). We get what we expect  (want).
unrelated to this particular video... Have you seen "Exploring 4D quantum Hall physics with a 2D topological charge pump" by  Lohse, Schweizer, Price, Zilberberg, and Bloch in January 2018 Nature?  how does their experimental result prove the existence of a fourth spatial dimension?  Another story that I'd REALLY like to see is an explanation of why Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole is proportional to surface area.  Why not volume?!!  Another compelling topic would be: how Werner Nahm reached the conclusion that 11 dimensions would be the largest number of dimensions consistent with a single graviton, and more dimensions will show particles with spins greater than 2.  Also, related to that, why 11 dimensions is the lowest dimensional space where supersymmetry and gravity can coexist.

Why is the question centered on our interpretation of cats and poison (😆 and our own mind, which I’m guessing is based in chemistry/physical, it’s like asking the question to the question
I don’t understand completely but seems like there’s an assumption the scientist and subject of observation are independent. Could there a yet to discovery link making the observation part of the system being observed which when accounted for would return to being observation independent?
I do like your objective style.
I'm sorry, not sorry, of seeing a straight wht male on PBS explain these things. Get a better diverse host, PLEASE. You know the saying....."Go woke, never go broke".   Get with the times, PBS
I'm curious as to what you personally think it's the most likely interpretation of what we have. Not necessarily your favourite, or the 'best' one, but what you personally think is closest to the underpinning processes that drive all the quantum weirdness
Thumbs up for diversity......of Afros!!!!
I used to think gas bills were not real if I didn't look at them. It's not true.
A day from our perspective is based upon the complete rotation of planet Earth but the Earth itself is slowing down each day on its rotation due to resistance of gravity from the moon our closest celestial body and gravity from other celestial bodies so I’ve read  The effect is minuscule over a time period of a year but over millions of years it can be seen so our measurement of speed of rotation is not absolute it varies by minuscules amounts on a daily bases  Nothing is truly fixed or absolute it’s random when one measures a thing  Suppose the same principle can apply at the quantum level  But I’m no expert
If you do this thought experiment: you are floating ball of skin, you can only touch, but have no thoughts, no emotions, no memories and you are floating in a void in which you do not interact with anything. You do not experience darkness, you experience nothing. From your perspective you are in a state of non-existence. Until you meet an identical ball into which you crash. It is in this meeting that you both become conscious, not of yourself but of the other, because you finally have met a point of reference. It is in the meeting between the two beings that consciousness derives. Now, the weird thing is that this thought experiment basically describes wave-function collapse, two particles exist in a state of superposition or rather in a state of non-existence, it is in the meeting with each other that they get a point of reference and thus collapse into a state of certainty or rather existence. Thus consciousness and wave-function collapse have a very, very striking resemblance. Maybe we've thought of it all wrong, consciousness is not a cause of wave-function collapse, consciousness is caused by wave-function collapse. Consciousness is rather a point in spacetime being in a state of existence, the received information of the rest of reality collapses inwards into this state of existence, from uncertainty to certainty.  I like to think that consciousness is a literal property of the universe, a mechanism that turns non-existence into existence, in other words the collapse of the wave-function itself. However it is extremely important to realize that this kind of consciousness-property of wave-function collapse is different from the conscious experience of our human minds. Our human mind is the result of 3,5 billion years of evolution that utilizes this mechanism of wave-function collapse, in order for the organic system to increase it's chance of interaction with reality. Inadvertently it also increases the chances of the rest of the surrounding reality to be interacted with. If you think of Feynman-paths than this isn't so strange either, because a consciousness organism basically has a extremely high chance of interaction, thus seen from a evolutionary perspective a consciousness organism is the most likely outcome to evolve. Our biological experience of reality is the result of a unfathomably complex system of conscious interactions between particles that collectively make up the experience of our conscious reality. Anything outside of our space of interaction exists in a state of non-existence, and if we do not interact with reality than both we and reality have become non-existent.  However if this true, how come there are so many separate conscious interactions, and how come that a conscious being in the perspective of another conscious being can be in a state of superposition? The answer to that I think lies in the strange property of all consciousnesses to be completely identical at all times: consciousness is a single point of existence at the exact center of spacetime, both the future and the past are in a perpetual state of non-existence from this point of perspective. From the perspective of consciousness, the universe is moving through this point of existence. This description is identical to all conscious experiences. Of course our human minds might experience things differently, where you see green I see red etc, but this experience is not a property of consciousness (which is a single point of existence in spacetime caused by the interaction of particles). It might very well be that there is only one single point of existence within the entirety of reality. The entire lifetime of the universe, of spacetime, loops through this single point of existence, thus creating itself from nothing into everything. This would mean that their only exists one consciousness at the time in the universe, and that we all share the same cosmic consciousness throughout the entirety of spacetime.  Of course this is all philosophy, but I find it a beautiful interpretation to live by. Not only that, I can't think of a more empathetic perspective on reality, that we all might share the same consciousness, separated only by a strange timeloop.
Or as a Star Wars fan....the Force is real.
*Contrary to scientific Beliefs ; Your Universe including the human species, is just a 'STORY', displayed in the form of a 'Holographic Simulation', in a very small Display Register, of "The Processing System of LIFE", while "LIFE The Real Self" is Non-Dimensional, and in NO WAY represents, nor even remotely looks anything like any species, including the human species !*
If a tree falls in the forest... It was rendered in the down position when you found it.
How many experiments have we put clocks on devices and sent them to deep space?  Have we ever sent an observer with them? How do we know that spacetime is not space/time? Where the two are a balancing act...  We say there is unexplained density/material in the universe given our models but never stopped to ask ourselves if these models are wrong hinging on the idea of a variable, we thought was constant, is not.   What I can see happening is sending a clock to space with an observer ends up in the boat of "We know the time and position of what it tells us. What we don't know is how much time the distant observer has experienced since (we received/they sent) that message. The whole concept of entanglement sounds like it is based around a known source and an unknown ending, both of which propagate along the same timeline. Environmental effects that we have not begun to understand are the deciding factor in the orientation/entanglement.   IF you ever want to time travel, just negate all perception of the outside universe. (Live for yourself) By the time you notice what is happening your entire life will be gone. We experience this all the time as humans, when caught in the moment things fly by. When watching the clock things take ages. If you want to enjoy life, you will be a cat. If you want to ride it out as long as possible, you will be an observer.  Cleverness: Even in Schrödinger's example, curiosity killed the cat, it just so happens it was our curiosity.   I am thinking of the aluminum foil on an asteroid method of dealing with an impending doom... Imagine this works because what you are doing is reflecting the solar radiation and canceling out the energy sent/reflecting it causing destructive interference leading to a fluctuation in the spacetime near the objects surface.  I have an understanding of the universe based on matter is the resistance to change in time and energy flows the same direction time does. If you found a way to cancel all radiating energy you would have the ability to control time...  (For all we know scientists have reached absolute 0 in their experiments, but we would never be able to observe it as that time ceased to exist/became immeasurable)
Very informative, thanks so much!!
So this is a question and idea to be thought of. If just recently we were able to observe a star that exploded during the Jurassic period. Then hypothetically speaking if we continued in that trajectory from which the star exploded, would we then be able to to see how not only other stars exploded 100's of millions of year ago but get to a point in which the Big Bang happened or the point of origin of existence happened?
Why would the universe create itself ? It could be that every possibilities of any universe is already written and whatever universe, that traverse that map, has a precise path of possibilities. The code that would recreate the guessing game would look like that.
So... positrons exist. Remember?
So if a universe forms and no one is around to hear it, does it make a Big Bang?
I haven't seem any video (and indeed any source) that explains and introduces Twistor theory to motivated beginners. I hope this can be done.
I don't know that we can accept the premise that we all observe the same reality. Even when we limit our measurable dimensions to space, no two perspectives are identical. Now you want to add in time and Schrodinger's cat types of events, and I don't see why we need to have every single measurement exactly the same from every "perspective."   When we're looking at a Schrodinger's cat type of event, it's binary, but there could be extremely small differences that we are not measuring. Perhaps the cat dies 42 milliseconds sooner for one observer than another. Certainly, both observers will never agree on exactly the same instant due to relativity. Want to test this? I'm pretty sure it can't be done since no two frames of reference are able to agree on a single version of events due to our friendly speed limit of c.
this has gotten very meta, in the vein of Renee descartes.       not enough equations in this one.

When you Interrogate the Universe , The Universe Interrogates YOU
the thing ive learned from myself, and other people, is that we often look for patterns, and in a desperate attempt to make sense of chaos, trick ourselves into seeing them for comfort.
No substance. Only consistency. - That sounds perfectly sensible and accurate to me. - Especially as we know, that for universe to be consistent, _it cannot be complete._
In the denotational semantics of lazily evaluated functional programming languages we can represent algebraic data types as Scott domains, a kind of semilattice of partially defined values ordered by information content. Ever since I studied them I've wondered if they have a connection to the idea of the state of the universe being dependent on observation. In the participatory universe theory it's not only the set of all possible observations (ordered by precision of knowledge) that forms a Scott domain, but actually the set of all possible universes (ordered by degree of definedness). Whenever an observation is made, the universe becomes the supremum (least upper bound) of all universes that are consistent with the observations made so far. And the future light cone, in a sense, is the filter whose infimum (greatest lower bound) is the universe we're in at the current instant in time.
but what if it tun out of possible options? Would that reality just get rejected and rolled back? XD - This is the problem with this space search argument... - Unless there _always_ exists something consistent with all observations... but constraints of the system usually mean most of the space is NOT possible, yet this process would predominantly arrive to such parts of the space, would it not?
The delayed choice experiment ceases to perplex if you consider Relativity.  The time elapsed from a photon's creation to its demise, from the photon's perspective, is always zero.  From the photon's point of view, the decision of how to behave, and the measurement, happen the same instant.  Has the delayed choice experiment been repeated with slower particles?
What if an observer preceded or came into existence at the same time as the big bang?  Would this ground the past in realism while allowing the idea of observations affecting reality still ring true?  In short, would it let both ideas expressed in the episode be correct?
i do have a great deal of respect for the presenter in this videos. Not so much for many of his colleagues. Let me pose something here. Take the Schroedinger cat box and change it just a little.......inside we have the cat, the emitter, the receiver, the hammer and the vile, just like in the original. But in the vile we have acid instead of poison. The acid fumes would kill the cat as readily as the poison so that presents no problem. The vile is then mounted on a mechanism such that were the cat to fall over to the floor of the box, the vile would tip and its contents be dumped on the box floor. So, no one opens the box, i.e., no observer. Suddenly, all those in witness see acid dripping from the bottom of the box. The box is never opened and yet we all know that by definition, the cat is dead and only dead for if not, no acid would be dripping out. Here the cat’s state is nested between a string of other events which if those subsequent manifested, it is only by means of the cat’s death. It cannot be claimed that it is the observation of the acid dripping from the box which causes the wave form to collapse for that event is several apart and downstream from the necessity of the cat being dead (that the acid vile would be tipped over). Where is your wave function here? I am not arguing against particle duality but this superposition business seems to be an excuse to take all sorts of fanciful flights that cross over into the ridiculous.  In the consideration of the topic in the context like that above, what happens to this absurd notion expressed in the self-facilitating universe and all the nonsense about multi-verses? If the cat must be dead to allow the acid to eat through the box and drip to the ground, does this not mean that these objects involved within the box and their interactions had to be objective and deterministic prior to our observation of the dripping acid? How is it that our observation is thought to be primary or foundational when it is wholly reactive in this occasion and ONLY at the very end of the string of events? To continue, I fully understand that superposition would manifest in an electron field for example. But from that flows the notion that an entire cat as a composite entity is in superposition? Why? How? No matter who observes the cat, 99.9 percent of its mass is hidden from view in or out of the Schroedinger box. Something doesn’t make sense in this.  It seems that Dr. Fineman is the only one with common sense. To be succinct, it is enough to show the absurdity of the notion that the observers in the here and now (for example) created or assisted in that creation of the big bang by their observations, which then led to the here and now. This is nuttier than Dr. Gott’s scheme of a piece of reality breaking off and boing back through a time loop to give rise to itself. Wow. Let’s violate all of the body of the principles of physics discovered over the centuries to make these sophomoric flights of fancy.  There are certain absolute truths of materiality which preclude consideration of some of that proposed in the video such as…..you cannot have motion without an object. The nature of the concepts mandates a certain context of consideration and an objective relationship between them. By their very definition, this is necessarily so, highlighting another absolute truth, but of abstraction, that one cannot appeal to truths to formulate a position that denies the existence of truth. It would be like saying, I think I am not thinking and expecting that it could ever be true. How does one employ terms to formulate a denial of those terms? Yet this seems to be the brand of logic now applied by these supposed geniuses of physics. Is this the nonsense by which physicists are consumed in our time? If the universe began and expanded for billions of years to the state in which we now exist, that we might pose that it is our observations and abstractions of what took place at that beginning that gave rise to it then there is no phenomenon of time or entropy which we are told defines its direction. To claim that “the past has no existence except as it is recorded in the present” is to suggest that by “recorded in the present” means as our observations and measurements determine its past state. And if we are now wrong in our assessment of them? Was there no independent, objective truth with regard to them in the past which we might now mistake for something else? Are we to suppose that because we “record them now” that that is what is their validation? So we are to believe that for the tens of billions of years there was no objective, deterministic physical reality to the universe and its process of expansion, that that only manifested in the here and now that we are in observance of the past? By that then we can claim with equal certainty that to have an existent in materiality like each of us for example, we do not need molecules and they do not need atoms and they do not need protons and neutrons and they do not need quarks and they do not need gluons to bind them, etc. How can those who call themselves scientists buy into such piffle?   This is no different than the almost unanimous belief by these folks that they universe was infinite in scope but that it expanded. Not ridiculous as well? Consider, if the universe expanded from a quantifiable 10 -15 meters or whatever it was (a quantifiable measure) to about the size of a grapefruit (another quantifiable measure) then continued on for tens of billions of years, what can we say that means? What is it to expand? It is to increase in number, value or measure by quantifiable increments. So what would that last increase in measure be just before the very next one was infinity? As you can see, there is no infinity and cannot be in materiality, period. It is an abstraction only. Perhaps further conceptual proof is required. If the universe existed infinitely back as is claimed by means of a cyclical or bouncing universe (both of these impossible for infinity cannot be collapsed even if it could be achieved) then that infinite line can only be considered from the here and now, back. We can’t consider it from the other end for there isn’t one. EVEN IF WE COULD, which we can’t, were we to travel forward to the here and now along that infinite line we would never get here….ever. But these are the kinds of schemes I think employed merely to support some pathetic atheist narrative which these amiable chatterboxes have all blindly embraced. Some geniuses.    i suppose i'll get no response from this.
Question: I've always heard the universe is expanding, but with collisions from the atomic to galactic level over billions of years, is there matter that is not expanding or in fact never expanding from the point of origin due to the sheer gravitational forces at that point and what we observe is only the matter on the outer edges that have escaped, similar to how the sun expels atoms light, but generally is still mostly there after billions of years. Could the reason we only identify 5% of matter because the rest hasn't left the point of origin? We can't see black holes because nearly everything can't escape it's gravitational force. Who's to say that at the point of the big bang that we only see what was able to escape due to the force of the big bang and everything else has been pulled back due to some sort of super black hole that doesn't allow absolutely anything to escape it's forces? or that anything that is escaping still is escaping to the other end of the universe that we cannot observe?
Do particles that are entangled only entangled if they are from the same source origin?
if something is taken away from nothing, then can nothing create something?
I am calling BS on this. Interesting, but "participatory realism?" I doubt it.
yes
Our Lord Jesus Christ did.
My conscious mind has direct power over reality. I only have to play by the rules of my own physical being. This seems both offending and inevitable.
E=mc²V is the answer 😜
If a tree falls in a forest but fox news claims it was a false flag operation, did it make a sound?
@PBSSpaceTime a great topic for an episode would be on how the universe may be a simulation.
No.  Of course not. The most intuitive way to explain how or why a particle like a photon (or electron, etc) might behave as an uncertain location particle while also like a polarizable axial or helical wave ''packet'', given that everything in the universe from electrons to solar systems are in orbit with something else pulling them into polarizable axial or helical apparent waves depending on the orientation of their orbits as they travel thru space is that they’re in orbit with an undetectable dark matter particle pulling them into polarizable axial or helical apparent waves as they travel.  And given that we know we’re in a sea of undetectable dark matter but don’t know where it’s disbursed, we can imagine that they’re in orbit with an undetectable dark matter particle pulling them into polarizable axial or helical apparent waves as they travel where the speed of their orbit determines the wavelength and the diameter is the amplitude which would explain the double slit, uncertainty, etc.  No?
Who defines what an "observer" is. Is my cat also an observer? Are bacteria observers? Can a rock be an observer?
Is it smaller than a bread box? No. Is it smaller than a bread box? Yes. Universe breaks down.
Answer: God is the primary observer
The aspects of this sort of quantum observer effect that most interest me are when the interactions occur over vast distances. Ten billion years ago, some galaxy near the edge of our own observable universe emitted a photon into deep space. This photon didn't just go in one direction, but according to QM 'rippled' outwards like a wave, potentially interacting with countless octillions of other particles along the way. The ripple expanded outwards in many directions, through nebulae, planets, other stars, probably other telescopes belonging to aliens *outside our observable universe* and by chance it didn't interact with any of them, passing over all of them without a blip - until one day that wave - now 20-billion light-years wide - suddenly resolved as a discrete ping on the CCD of the Hubble Telescope. The photon who's position was indeterminate for over 10-billion years, possibly anywhere within our observable universe or well outside it, suddenly was THERE for just a moment, and likewise there may have been an instantaneous entangled quantum interaction with the electron responsible for emitting that photon so long ago - even though the galaxy from which it came is probably now far beyond our particle horizon. Equally interesting, as photons move at the speed of light and thus do not experience time, that interaction was - from its standpoint, if it could be said to have one - instantaneous.
Kind of wish this would be more regularly couched by 'interaction' rather than observation. Despite the quantum 'fuzziness' of the existence of individual particles as they dash through the universe (or tabletop light beam experiments), most things WE experience have a much more significant and solid reality - because all the particles that make up us and our environment are interacting *constantly*, billions of times per second. This prevents any sort of 'quantum fuzzy woo' from cropping up in our lives, because all the stuff of us and our world is essentially pinned down by these interactions. Only when you get into rarefied experiments, or photons traveling endless light years through space does this sort of quantum observer/interaction weirdness generally become relevant. Honestly, Relativity already told us that interaction is critical to the underpinnings of reality - it's literally right there in the name - because you cannot define the properties of any particle EXCEPT as they relate to some other particle! That relationship and their interactions between each other are the actual important part. All forces and vectors are measurements between particles, not of particles. You can't even measure the mass of a particle in total isolation, because even mass is a relative value, as seen by the way particles can gain mass as they approach the speed of light.
ok... but let's address the elephant in the room. If this interpretation is true, then what are entities that initiated the first interaction that brought everything into being? It seems like we would still run into the same problem if we trace all the way back to the big bang.
In Schrodinger's cat isn't the cats consciousness enough to determine if it's alive or dead
yin yang
I think its simplythw way we measure something going from a quantum wave to a single event. We measure single events so in measuring a quantum event it has to have become a single event. It exists in all ways so eventually it would become exactly what you are measuring it to be. Except "eventually"  is not distinguished in a quantum wave. So eventually is now
Can you cover what the recent measurements of the W-boson mass mean for the standard model? How would this change it and why is it's mass limited by that model?
Are we in a simulation? Every physics video seems to bring me to that conclusion.
So, to summarise: if a tree falls in the forest and no physicist is around to measure it, does it have leaves?

Would this tie in with his one-electron universe, that the past that is created is going back and forth in time via the positron?
This is a notion I’ve been playing for a while, but I didn’t know what it was called in science or which theorists have been working on it. Wheeler seems to have been very much onto something.  So my idea is analogous to a network of roads: there are two phases, the construction phase and the “usage” or traveling phase. (And of course , like a road system, it’s continuously in flux, being repaired, extended, modified/deleted, etc.)  What seems to be entanglement, is the fact that a road connecting two towns (atomic states?) has already been constructed. So it’s not an instantaneous interaction in the now but an interaction that’s already been formed (constructed) a long time ago. And the interaction, per se, is the act of driving from one point to another on that road. (More or less…)  The interaction, or collapse of the wave function, IS the “observation”. We don’t require a conscious observer. An “observer” is anything that causes/forces the collapse of the wave function. So when a photon travels through a filter it’s being observed at that point.   This is where the idea probably breaks down, and where I’m a bit stuck. Are there phenomena that can influence an interaction (e.g. a magnetic or gravitational pull) without collapsing the wave function? Are these NOT observers, in this case? - and other questions/problems like this…  What is the branch of science or the name of the set of theories that explore these questions and phenomena? I’d like to find out more and try to refine my ideas a little… :)
That reminds me the philosophical question asking: "Does a tree falling in a forest with no human to hear it do still make sound?" I find that the theory thinking that it is the measurement that creates the event and dictates the result is egocentrical and a tautology. It is like that tree falling: yes it does create the vibration of the air. Yes a recorder would capture that vibration. Still, "sounds" are the creation of the brain, thus the measurement made it happens...
Who knows it's all theories. Doubt a human is intelligent enough to solve this.
I am really interested in details about the beam splitter experiment, I don't understand why the mirror doesn't break the quantum state and makes the beam "measured", ie interacted with.
I really don't like this informational view of the universe. Nothing from the physics point of view, more that it is something that the Creationists can jump onto and say information requires something to think it into existence, that requires a personal mind, which has to sit outside of the universe to create it. Therefore it shows that the Christian God must be it and isn't he so clever and there is our proof of him. Not that I think that anyone but Jordan Peterson or William Lane Craig could catch onto this. Luckily Peterson seems to be alienating himself from the fundamental literalists like AiG, and Craig also seems to be distancing himself from a literal Genesis
I like a bit of participation in nonsense.
Maybe theory of everything isn't perfect bcoz ur lacking one thing. SpaceTime is what u call it but it ain't perfect yet. A Bigbang created space and time but how about the sound of the big bang? No one was giving enough attention of the sound that created happened the bigbang but is it suppose to be their? How would a bang be complete without a sound?
If you had a good enough telescope pointed at our solar system from light years away would it theoretically be possible to receive instant images through some kind of quantum entanglement receiver and be able to see our solar system in the past?
what defines a observer is ? can only living beings become observers or can any object that is able to interact with system becomes observer?
I tried to understand this 20 years ago, maybe time to give it another shot haha
Thank you for this. I am a layman, but I enjoyed this video so much!
It makes totally sense that the universe we're experiencing is the only configuration capable of creating this experience. That's also why we're experiencing it, because it's possible
Extent this concept to prescriptive as well as descriptive questions ("should it be…?" rather than "is it…?") and you have the groundwork for an ontologically neutral kind of moral universalism.
I have thought in the past that the universe is a lot like the timeless question of "which came first, the chicken or the egg" in that it takes an observer to collapse the wave function, but the wave function needs to to collapse in order for the observer to exist.
Why are most discoveries, discovered by scientists with cool names?  For example: How prevalent are names like Einstein, Hawking, Newton…?  Any discoveries by a Smith or other common name?
So contrasted to the views that hold observers create reality, in It for Bit’s participatory universe, reality creates observers that create the reality that created them. Cyclical, but essentially arriving at the same point: the universe cannot exist without observers who cannot exist without the universe. My mind’s scrambled with all these chickens and eggs.
What if the universe is actually informational, but we're just a particular configuration of that information that seems physical because of our skewed perception?  Quantum field theory describes every particle as an excitation of a particular quantum field, and the fields interact in certain ways to produce everything we observe about the world. The interactions may get unimaginably complex, but at the most fundamental level maybe we're all just huge, intricate patterns of quantum excitations. For all we know, the physicality of our universe as we understand it could just be an illusion; a way for our brains to cobble together a rudimentary internal model that was sufficient to keep us from getting eaten.
No wonder cats love boxes. It’s where they gain their nine lives entangled in the quantum yarn.
to win the negative 20 questions game, just ask random objects until the answer is "yes" For example, is it a bathtub? No  Is it a kumquat? yes    I WIN!!!
Feynman was so right bc; A POINT, in Every Direction,  is the same as, NO POINT at ALL - Harry Nielson, movie "The Point"
A Universe that doesn't evolve conscious beings, seems rather pointless. 🤷
Matt, a better title for this video might have been 'Quantum metaphysics'.  Maybe a few videos in the future on philosophy for PBS spacetime?
Thank you! It's great to learn about John Wheeler and his work on a consciousness connection to reality.   Would this also support a link to premonitions? Because I have had traumatic events from the future hit me like a sudden scare in a bad dream, even when I was awake. It drained my energy as if I had run a mile. i.e. After working 3rd shift, I changed my routine and sat on the corner of a picnic table before leaving the plant. An intense wave went through my whole body. I was sure of 3 things when that happened. Someone from my work area at the other end of the plant, was going to get hurt. It would be severe. It could happen any time in the next day or so. When I came in at midnight to start my next shift I happened to run into my supervisor near that table and pointing to where I sat, told my story. I said to make sure all the first aid stations were stocked. "Just did that now" super said. I also said to tell everyone to be extra careful.  When I came in for my next shift, I learned that the first shift operator of the extruder I ran, had slipped and severely slashed their arm from fingers to elbow with a razor knife.  When it happened, the person freaked out and ran 100yds to collapse at the spot on the picnic table exactly where I sat & had the premonition.  This proves to me that there is a Fabric of Spacetime.
Why does Consciousness being fundamental make scientists so uncomfortable wouldn't that be an exciting New Frontier it sounds to me no matter what the evidence to prove that it is fundamental is being shoved under the rug because of bias opinions
The “observer creating the universe” theories are interesting and fun to ponder, but are really narcissistic and remind me of a baby playing peek-a-boo. All of the experiments involve light—a massless object that doesn’t experience time. So of course it can be in multiple places at once since it’s not bound by time. But we—and our measuring tools—all have mass and are trapped by time. So maybe it’s less that a conscious observer is affecting reality, and more that oddities happen when ANY object with mass bound by time interacts with a massless object that isn’t. Superposition likely still exists, but our equipment is incapable of capturing that. Like trying to capture a complete movie with a single photo of the screen with a still camera. Sure you’ll get a glimpse of a still scene, but you’re not changing how the movie ends, and it’s still all there. An entire song exists on a record all at once in the grooves, but the needle can only experience one note at a time. It’s forced to experience the song in sequential time. The needle “observer” isn’t writing the song, and the song exists in whole, all at once, on the record, even though the needle can never experience it that way.
Conscience if narrowly defined makes it harder to grasp this concept.  But if we introduce levels of conscienceless, this makes a bit more sense.  As in, if we are conscience and we are part of the universe, then the  universe is conscience.  Or the universe naturally does "conscience".  Also, consider all things as conscience in varying degrees.  So atoms, that bump into each other, "observe" each other at a rudimentary conscience level.   What do you guys think?
The more kush you smoke, the more sense it makes. 😎👍
Question: how would the delayed choice experiment work, or be interpreted, in pilot wave?
I love this guy. So much so that I’ve made a niche in my week entirely for watching his talks. This particular episode — this one hit me heavily. To me, science and faith, my faith anyway are one and the same.
Wizards of the quantum woo
7:25 i know this might be completely dumb, but is it necessary that in order to know how to collapse after the superposition is formed, the process has to be statefull? So carrying all those informations in the superposition? By the way it react to the delayed observation, cant the photon be at the lowest level just a function that is stateless and will give you back the same output with the same input?  I might be just ignorant of others details, but is there something special about putting the second splitter and so have two times the photon being influenced, instead of three or four or five?  Lol now something even more dumber, maybe to solve the issue of quantum gravity, by putting the second splitter its gravity travel back in time and act as if it was always there because there is no difference between having the object or the gravity it exert.
Ya know, I think Richard Feynman was right:  too much philosophizing.  And a lot of anthropomorphizing:  "the universe can't exist without the observer" seems to be human centric, either intentionally or unintentionally.  Come on Dr. Matt!  Put out a workable general theory of life, the universe, and everything!
Big fan! Episode ideas I think would be fun... 1) The W Boson's new more accurate measurement that alters the standard model? 2) Constructor Theory and the Higgs Boson. I noticed they're both 2012 based so think there might be some thought pattern connections with David Deutsche but 🤷‍♂️ hahaha 3) Sun Atomic Particle data and it's implications on gravity. Can we quantize the data and apply it to larger solar or cosmic masses and after doing so, what new facts can we gather on gravity.
Simpler fun:  Bang, life, tech, anachronistic, visit back thru time 2 the bang, remodel same = '~bang' or bang 2.0, repeat...
This episode has an unorthodox philosophical/paradoxical feel,  I have grieve doubts about the "observational" reality.
In order to observe the universe all you have to do is look. You don't need to measure or ask questions just observe. There's nothing wrong about enjoying the view without super analyzing it or micromanaging it. Your not making it exist because you asked questions how stupid is that. And who knows all the correct answers to these questions we're supposed to be asking to make reality exsist? How do you verify that person's answers are correct? Do answers need to be correct or can we simply keep asking stupid questions and the universe will stay real?  Just think how stupid it would be if I went to watch a new movie and I knew that it wasn't going to exist unless I thought of it and asked questions about it. Well guess what I have no imagination. I could not make, direct nor producer a movie so how could I possibly make it exist just by observing it or measuring it. Come on man. You guys are doing too much. Just for once sit back and enjoy the show. Please smell the roses before life passes you by.☺
Nothing Exist without the Observer.
Yes!) You have to Ask the Question 1st ,, lol,  then you have to Believe the answer))
Such persistent dumbness. Why would you need  “real” substrate for this participatory process to act upon? The substrate can be part of the same self-instantiation process.
We are an Ant within the Universe...s
I wish we could come up with a rigorous definition of Observe.
Dam these videos hurt my head to think about most the time...but I think this one gave me a migraine. 😆
The first time that I heard this kind of theory was on a philosophy talk by Alan Watts that stated that we create the universe by interacting with it
Thanks dark energy

Have you watched "Devs"?  And is it possible?
Why is the expansion tubular and not a spherical.
I observe, Therefor I am.
Wheeler wrote about “the boundary of a boundary is zero” as a far reaching concept in physics and a clue for the development/elaboration of his “it from bit” philosophy.  What does “the boundary of a boundary is zero”  mean and what is a simple example through which one might understand it coming from a perspective of someone familiar with QM but not so much QFT and renormalization or gauge invariance which I feel this may be in reference to.  Thank you for light you may shed on this.
Isn't the framework for participation, i.e. the mechanism for formation of information, the out-there substrate of reality? An hence participatory universe also qualifies as a form of objective realism
I could never understand why one person sees the same thing as another person but in a different way. A girl can be both beautiful and ugly in the eye of the beholder. So she is like in a state of super position until she is observed by the observer to be either beautiful or ugly. I think the whole world is in a state of super position and our actions threw  consciousness, manipulate the world around us. A hammer is a tool to one person and a weapon to another person. It's the same as good and evil, your either going to be doing one or the other no matter if you like it or not. God made the world to see what we do with it and sense we are all connected one person's actions on reality effect another. The whole world is in a state of super position and it was made that way to see what we do with it. It also comes together.
Dear PBS space time; Could you please stop showing the picture of Albert Einstein sticking his tongue out? I find it quite demeaning of a great scientist. There's thousands of other pictures of this great father of physics to choose from. Thanks.
I hope this survey stays up constantly. I can't suggest many things just yet.
please stop it with the forced diversity and the goofy african scientist.  we get it....there are a few african scientist in the mix. please stop it.  most people have diversity fatigue at this point.  the goofy "comical" africans make the video unwatchable because you know they were added  for diversity reasons.   I down voted you.  stop it.
So the universe is one big game of Absurdle?
Questions, questions, questions . . . so, ultimately it seems like the concept of observers and objects is incoherent. In a sense, observers are also observed by objects; objects just can't tell us that. Interaction. Who is the observed vs object is a perspective / concept. Bits of reality transpire in both directions during any interaction. But the poles can never be directly known -- the pole of the observer and the pole of the supposedly objective object; both are described by wave-functions. I guess they both collapse relative to each-other during any interaction. Or in a no-collapse model, every reality is a private reality -- or perhaps we should say private interpersonal reality, because one bit of reality only happens between (and identifies) the two specific systems in a certain interaction, and only for one vanishing instant in the non-existent flow of time. Hmm. Thus reality is made out of an ever-changing ocean of private mutual sharing of information / energy between its non-existent parts. Does this support the mystical aphorism "God is love"? Hmmm.
Far out stoner hypothesis...  The observer is actually God/Designer/etc.  We are part of It's observation.  The Bible tells you God is of all things and all things are of God.  That is another way of saying we are all the same star dust and the universe is all made of the same things.  So, what is human life? It seems to be to create AI (and what is beyond that) and obtain super intelligence trying to figure out what the universe is.  So, then God/the Universe seems to be trying to figure out what it is via us/conscience.  God/the Universe is all of time and space. So, It knows everything and the order to which it ebbs and flows, but that does not mean God/the Universe knows what it is or why it is.    The Bible say that only God knows when the end of the world will be and not even Jesus would know when.  What if when God/the Universe discovers what and why It is one day, via our super intelligence, and that is the end of days in the Bible/then answer to the riddle of when will then end be? lol
It is my opinion that our deep dive into an observer centric, or interaction centric universe is more an indication of our ignorance than of our intellect.  Specifically we don't understand how it is that our measurement methodologies are impacting the results of those measurements.  And in that ignorance we have derived and stated that because we don't understand how the measurement procedure is changing the results it must mean that it is impossible for our measurements to be the cause.  Ergo we start philosophizing about the nature of the universe.  An act that I would say is the equivalent of Newton assigning to God that which he could not understand.
Semiotic universe.
The Church teaches that everything exists in God. St. Thomas Aquinas wrote that God is the uncaused cause. The Bible says:  "Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? (Lk. 12:6)" "But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. (Mt. 10:30)"  This is all truly mind-boggling. So when Christians fight over the filioque clause, or materialists start dissing creationism, to me those are facepalm moments.
i can imagine how we will look at these videos when the real underlying principle of spacetime will get known :-D
more of this please. this was wow
if there is nobody there to observe you, do you exist?
Bullshit minds create reality it’s a feed back loop we are indeed infinite beings.
We are knocking from the inside of the house
Someone in the motheruniverse figured out the question of black hole singularity and our universe was born

Schrodinger's cat is a dumb thought experiment because it ignores the cat as an observer.

Wouldnt the universe being comprised of bits of information at the most basic level prove simulation theory??
Universe did not create itself. God created it through Christ Jesus. This reality is an extension of other interconnected dimensions, the main one being heaven.
The Universe: " So,  you want to know how I looked shortly after the big bang? "  Scientist:  " That's correct, we even built a $10 billion telescope as our offer.  Will You show us?  The Universe: " Hmm...That's a good question, alright let me show you then.
Sounds like nonduality to me.
Working with children I'm continuously fascinated by their imagination as they create their reality.  One day I asked a few of them who were playing Tag what "it" is.  (You're it!)  I got looks from them ranging from confusion to the oft seen "what a stupid question."  This was not unexpected as the question may have an infinite number of answers.  This video provided a few of them.  Nice.
I like to think of the fuzziness of quantum as a matter of Rate Of Interaction. Higher ROI (internal or external) makes things more defined and vice versa.   In this, observers are not special, they are just another interacting object/system. A conscious observer has a high ROI by necessity and so cause otherwise low ROI systems to take on defined values when observed. So the cat is dead or alive, not both. Unless it's a very lazy cat.
I am reminded of an old Twilight Zone (or perhaps it was Outer Limits) episode, whereby a man accidentally turns down an alley he wasn't supposed to, and realizes that gnomes actually build reality as it happens. I must try to find it again, as clearly those gnomes were giving us a lesson in quantum mechanics before we had even asked some of the questions. Accidental? Or did that episode cause these discoveries to happen.
That would give the think enough about it and it will come true because we're the universe observing itself some gas
Interesting theory indeed. One multiplayer game. As soon as we are born, we have to figure out, why are we here.
wow...kinda like: I question therefore I am.
Matt: Can you explain in a video about tautology and super tautology? Would be interesting to learn about.
It is all missed up
i keep coming up against the same "naive" question (IANAP). and i think it's about "whose bit": it seems to be accepted that the woo-hippies who imagine the observer is conscious are wrong. so to generalise observation & measurement, are we talking about any physical system where an exact microscopic event is required, rather than a wave function, and the requirement of "reality" is that the event that happens must be consistent with the rest of the system? perhaps what i'm trying to ask is why we have events rather than endless cascades of superpositions? is it some limitation on the information required to keep all these balls in the air? is it something to do with feedback loops enforcing consistency?   if anyone wants to hazard a guess what i'm trying to ask about the minimal physical system  where measurement/observation happens rather than superposition, please help because i'd like to address this mental gap without learning too much physics
Blah blah blah. Lies lie lies. Total made up foney baloney crap
I swear you guys release these videos just to make stoners panic
Is it safe to say, reality depends on how you look at it?
I guess my question for this sort of model is what exactly is an observation here? What would be the first observation in this universe? Does the universe even exist without observations?
How self centered do you have to be to think that reality is in any way affected by your observation of it, merely by the act of observing it alone
My new counter to every argument: "Shaddup and calculate!"
The question "Whose bit?"  seems to point to only one possible answer. God's.
Uh oh, existential crisis happen.
So I took DMT and I am completely convinced of wheelers beliefs. Given I was high on a hallucinogenic so keep that in mind. But while on the drug I saw a complete break down of my own perception. First solid objects became liquid and seemed to exist throughout the room. Then my body dissipated and I was simply an entity. My own idea of self and memories all faded. I became one with my perception or the universe, quite literally. However within the blur of colors and emotions I began to see geometric figures like the flower of life or the Fibonacci spiral everywhere as well as indescribable figures. I soon realized that these shapes and colors were directed by my thoughts. If I was anxious the colors would turn darker and move rapidly, if I was happy they were brighter. If I focused on my couch it would appear amongst the blur of colors. I say this because what if our perception is what “it” is. What if the couch isn’t really there but simply we are all telling ourselves it is there. What if we are all the same entity and there is no such thing as quantities. What if the entire universe is paradoxical and there is no sense to be made of it. In a weird way I believe that that view makes more sense. I think that whatever it is, that it must encapsulate the concept of nothing as well as everything. Everything comes from nothing. You cannot have white without black, good with out evil,
I asked the universe, "Why am I alive now to experience you in all your glory?" The universe said, "You were the fastest swimmer and got to the egg first!" "If that is true," I said, "Why am I such a terrible swimmer now?" The universe replied, "You were not always fat and lazy!"
How can we know quantum entanglement effects two entangled particles that are on different sides of the galaxy? How do they measure a particle that's that far away?
I just solved quantum uncertainty while watching this video. It's so simple, I don't know why I didn't see it before. Whenever A interacts with B such that information of A transfers into B, all properties of A which B now possesses information about have been altered. So in a way, you can never observe what's really there, but only what was there until you observed it. But quantum information isn't the only way to obtain wisdom; you can still learn to predict what has actually happened by studying patterns and using analysis. The photon isn't in a superposition of going down both paths, it is a fundamentally different object. Interacting with the "pre-photon" in any way which collects pre-photon details will also cause it to become a "post-photon" which has different properties. But we can never see two kinds of photons because of the way observation fundamentally works.
So is this basically "If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"
Leaving a comment so I remember to rewatch this episode next time I drop acid.
Even biological sex is in a Quantum flux State according to "THE science"  being both one and the other,  neither and all points in between.
Best place to read about Wheeler's participatory universe?
Let’s talk about how the universe brought observers into existence and observers brought the universe into existence
Instead of the universe becoming what the collective minds imagine it to be, what if each person pulls themselves into a different universe that matches their conscious imagination of what the universe is?  That way there could be an infinite number of universes and we are zig zagging our way throughout all of them?  I guess then there would be an infinite number of each person that wills themselves into each of the universes, otherwise people would be popping in and out of existence all the time.
JUST a concept... and while I'm at it, "Surely to GOD, someone has already thought of this...      Think of the universe as if it's a balloon on the end of a straw... perfectly adhered... AND "Time" is modeled in our case, as the air through the straw... As time passes on (in one dimension through the straw)... the universe "grows" gaining interactions and thereby information... In the crude and primitive "very beginning" things were very simple... and through fusion and a multitude of other processes, things got very complicated over the 15 or so Billion (with a B) years... to the point where we're at today... and they'll continue swelling like that balloon on the end of the straw as time continues to flow into the future...      BUT the balloon expands in all 3 dimensions in our model... Is it not ALSO quite feasible to suggest (however dubiously) that there be 3 "dimensions" of measurement in "pure time" ?... that air we'd push into our balloon... though something of an otherwise slightly less defined substance in our own universe.      Does the universe create itself?      Well... yes and no. In a sense, the universe IS being created by the various factors and forces that continue to flow, since it can't possibly work any other way... Time keeps everything from happening all at once, and Space keeps it from having to take place at a single point mass... SO they're both indistinguishably and inextricably requisite to our reality... and to the universe going forward... AND in a sense, outside forces are pushing in... to cause creation... since the air through the straw IS representative of time INTO our universe, triggering interactions and keeping things ongoing...      Maybe it's just a ball falling through "pure time" but as the information continues to accumulate, so too must the universe in which that information is created... no matter how it "happens" exactly...       Good luck... I'm not really sure beyond what I've surmised... though I'm happy to detail as anyone might want to probe... the best I can. Understand I'll be resolving "graphically" most of the time... but we can muddle our way forward as it were... I'm confident... I believe in you. ;o)
Under any other circumstances, this guy would have ended up in an asylum...unless he could prove that he was perfectly coherent.  Which it is, I'm afraid.
“If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don’t understand quantum mechanics.”
To make it short, the act of observation & measurement causes quantum wavefunction collapse. While actions make its actuation shorter and more stable.   Before I proceed I just want to make it clear that I'm an open-minded irreligious technocratic idealist.  Now the dilemma is whether consciousness created the quantum soup, or the quantum soup is the one that created consciousness. Ponder, how would the superposition of order & disorder exist without a conscious observer? Most importantly, is there a need for a conscious observer to cause the first quantum wavefunction collapse? If so, then the autodidactic universe is potentially made to learn more about itself by simulating itself through various geometrical iteratives. Another proof is its tendency for feedback, emergent symbiosis, and creating neural patterns from the micro to supra scale. If that's the case then how can we terraform or deliberately interconnect this mandelbulb-like reality to make it totally self-aware, and put its energy at ease? Would the Technological Singularity suffice?
If consciousness is involved, could it be that univesre is expanding because we are looking at it?
Nobody has answered the question "how do we shield the gravity of the mass of the cat so the box is actually insulated from possible observation?"
A few long form videos would be great. I really have fallen out of favor with sub 30 minute videos
What happens when two mirrors, traveling at the speed of light (or 99 percent C in a vacuum ) are experiencing the Casimir effect and a photo is bounced between the two…what is exactly happening?
Dialectical Materialism 🙌🏼
Is a paradox a paradox before it becomes a paradox? If time travel is meant to become a reality and it would be the origin of the research leading to the discovery of time travel wouldn't it be the answer to the question itself? Would it be the most logical interpretation of creationism? The real question is can we make it better or are we doomed to repeat the same mistakes forever in an infinite loop?
It's the Aether.
So many goosebumps while watching this!
That means multi-dimensional reality is not possible. Anyway, if multi-dimensional reality is real then all humans would be planets. Ooh snap, it's half real!
If a tree falls in the woods and no one hears it does it matter No and therefore if it weren't for us to observe the universe the universe would not matter
One night long ago I was reading John Wheeler's stuff And I had an epiphany From that time on I have been fascinated with physics
With this theory, since the universe is the reality consistent with all observers, does that mean it would prevent any potential time travel paradoxes as the only "realities" would be ones that were consistent with both past and future observers?
Your wrong your theories are false this channel sucks physics will never get anywhere
I think fractals are the universal information processors, I.e consciousness and the universe operate in fractals.
Cosmic existential crisis.
why is it all the cartoons you use are always blacks ?
Holy crap I find the word "observer" so frustrating. None of this requires that word, and it just brings in so much consciousness woo. One could simply speak of "interactions" that happen out there in reality. The experiment at 6:30 is so much clearer if you think about it as a quantum particle going down all possible paths and being constrained by new elements, not by some... observer's brain... doing magic on it.   Quantum physics no more requires a conscious observer than does classical physics experiments. It's just a distraction.
How did the universe create itself? There were no human observer there then. Since it is constantly expanding and its size we will never be able to see the totality of it.  The observation is for our benefit.  We discover things not speak them into reality.  We can't see inside a black hole yet something is there. Something existed before the big bang because some specific process made it happen. Who saw that?
The white people's arrogant scientific view that the facts in the universe are relevant because we observe them. You know the universe just doesn't give a damn about what you think and the facts remain facts regardless of observations and acknowledgment.
Like Spock says Fascinating!!🤯
If the universe is 13.4 billion years old and sentient beings such as us have been around for maybe a million or so I think the logical conclusion is that the universe exists whether sentient beings do or not.
Sounds pretty Hegelian to me.
just tell us the GUT already.
Can time be the information bit(s) that connect an observer to quantum fields in producing classical reality?
Observers share three dimensional spatial reality?
Could quantum fields be two dimensional until measurement or observation makes three dimensional classic reality?
Negative 20 Questions? "His questions were helping reality define itself on the fly." ★ Quantum Entanglement, Simulation Theory: Sounds like you are describing Faith. Not in the General understanding of it, like Belief or a Religion as so many have been Indoctrinated into believing.  I mean accessing the cheat codes of this simulated reality, and the 2 examples I have come across are the visualization practices of Tibetan Buddhists known as Generation Stage, also I have read that Jesus inferred this as well. Jesus would say, "Have Faith" (although how to do it remains unknown but I think it can be inferred), but the Indoctrinated Slaves of that Cult interpret it as "Have Faith in" which is Trust. If he meant trust, I believe he would have said Trust, but he didn't. The ✝️ Cult has thus erred. Jesus implies that in order to do a miracle, you must have a quantity of Faith, and that it must be void of fear and doubt.  Thru my own experimentation, I wondered to myself one morning: In my dreams I create this whole other world in which I interact with and for the most part believe is real. Even remembering the names of the people I engaged with, but in the dream it's like I knew more about them but upon waking all that is lost.  So I asked myself, "Is it possible to produce light from my mind in the absence of light?" Because in order to see this dream world, light must be necessary in order to perceive it.  So thru meditation in complete darkness, with an object of intended focus I attempted the experiment.  In a dark room, I lit a candle. (Reason being, that it was it's own source of focus and did not need an exterior light source that would illuminate other objects that would detract from my intended focus, which was the candle). I would stare at it and try to see it picture perfect behind my closed eyelids. Periodically open my eyes to reimagine it's appearance. It would form, fill in, be slightly visible but eventually dissipate. It took me about a month of strong effort to eventually see it. But the moment I saw it, it quickly disappeared.  So after a month, I decided to change it up a bit, I would do the same visualization in a dark room but with eyelids open with no visual aid. The same process happened, I would see the outline, it would fill in, colors would flicker and hold. After a month of consistent practice I saw it manifesting before me illuminating the room. But the moment I saw it and realized that it was illuminating parts of the room (a sudden realization of "OMG WTF! This is impossible"!) and it would immediately vanish. That's what I would call doubt.  Reminds me of that verse, "Oh ye of little Faith, why did you doubt?" I experienced my first Doubt, not mundane doubt like I'm not sure which flavor ice cream I want more. No, this is a different kind of doubt.  Thru repeated experimentation I came to find other factors which affected my ability to create this image, factors like thoughts, fear, anger, doubt, and distraction (having a girlfriend is a distraction if you can't stop thinking about her). I have experience with no mind meditation, the one where you just concentrate on the sensation of breathing as it enters and exits your lungs, and I would use this one first to stabilize my mind, then proceed to the Generation Stage Meditation/Visualization.  But this is my visualization meditation, with focused will, I strengthened my Faith, and Faith IMO is the cheat codes of this simulation reality we live in.  There are other things that can be done with this type of meditation. The ancient stories that we've heard of so called "gods" doing. IMO there were never any gods, only people who gave the appearance of gods.  Check out "Siddhis," these are other cheat codes that can be accomplished.  My definition of Faith based upon my experimentation is, Faith is a concentration of mind that has to be evoked (summoned, generated via mind, "visualization) and tested with doubt, distraction, temptation and fear in order to find tune these cheat codes. Perhaps it serves to strengthen my will, so that I can will things to happen. So when I ask a question, reality says, "Like this?"
this is much more philosophical than scientific
please make a video about something which marijuana smokers absolutely love. BTW huge fan, you ROCK!!
Does anyone know if there is an explanation of the process of 'observing' these particles somewhere? It seems like a simple explanation of the participatory problem is that some sort physical process effects what we're observing while we are trying to observe it.
After watching this like 4 times I still don’t really understand it, and here I am trying to suggest to people I have a brief grasp on how quantum mechanics works until this video and now I feel I’m back at square one.
If an observation consists of the entangled relationship between two particles and observation is necessary to make those particles "real" then does this mean quantum entanglement is something fundamental (at least a part of) to whatever underlying reality which that which we experience in a pantomime (i.e. Plato's shadows on cave walls)? That fact that seems to transcend space and time would seem to hint at its fundamentality.
So I’m other words, he created real life loading?
Luminous heeft met fluorescerende paddestoelen te maken. Het gaat om het VANADIUM dat erin zit.
so the hubble, the jwst, the telescopes in the atacamba desert all looking back billions of years ago at things that happened those things didn't happen until all those telescopes viewed the light from them.  i am missing something, maybe many somethings.
The beginning of the video highly confused me. I didn't aware there is a specific game called "20 Questions", so I just thought it was about a game in which 20 questions play some kind of a role. And then he talks about forgetting "the thing that you chose", and I was lost for the rest of the introduction. It was only later in the video when he mentioned the game again in a way that made it clear "20 Questions" is a specific game.  In German, the name of the game translates to "Who am I?" ("Wer bin ich?"), and I did not make the connection...
I think I can prove John Wheeler correct: Each time I watch this episode I feel like I'm watching something different! (In case my nerd is a little off, I meant that as humour. I really enjoy your work! Great job!)
Is there a channel that goes over these published papers and explains the math in detail? I’d really like to get a better understanding
😳 what????
What is physics woo though exactly?
Ayn Rand's philophy has a great refutation of the subjectivist idea that conciousness creates what it observes. It is a self-refuting position to try to hold.  (And the copenhagen interpretation has nothing to refute her alternative objectivust view on metaphysics).
This seems to be The closest analog to the 'Music of The Spheres'.  Let's thank our present sanity for unpredictability 😆😥
Was there a prime observer tho? 😏
My best ‘visualizing’ reality is this :   A correct / right local realism AND another deviating differentiated one there which stills righter and realer.
The notion of phenomena occurring inside a reality is nonsensical unless it can be detected, and has no objective truth until it can be defined.  That is, objective truth can be perceived differently, much like various sensors may register a different value.  The mind objectifies and quantifies a reality that does exist with or without observers, but has no meaning until it is brought into that reality and continuously interacts with it.  That can look different depending on the person observing it, as we all process information in ways that are as unique to us as our genetic makeup. Raw data is as real as it gets, but has no context.  So how do we define what reality is if we all participate in how it's defined, but our definition is always different depending on the observer?  I think the philosophical answer is simple:  You can please some of the people some of the time... In other words, general consensus is the best we'll ever get as a species.  The scientific answer is not as straightforward.
This just sounds like Last Thursdayism with extra steps.  Wouldn't it make more sense that there _is_ some kind of underlying physical reality that we just don't fully understand yet?  Or is an argument for Simulation Theory?  "Objects aren't rendered until a player is looking at them" sort of thing, but mixed with procedural generation. Simulation Theory means Intelligent Design.  Intelligent Design makes Creationism a valid possibility.  Creationism means God exists.  Checkmate, atheists. No but for real, Christian theology aligns quite well with the concept of a nursery simulation: without facing hardships, people can't grow into mature adults, so in a perfect paradise the children are placed into a simulation to experience pain and hardship so that they'll develop and mature into responsible and hardworking adults.  Those who "fail" the simulation are never allowed to join the real world, and potentially placed into an alternate simulation as a sort of prison.
PhD grads going thru their dissertation phase after 8-10 years of college   https://youtu.be/pBjU3Ii7lfs
The problem of the observer as a conscious being of some kind is that it does lead back to a theological explanation. I know, because I’ve interacted with them, that many of those expounding that deny that’s what they’re pushing, but they certainly are.  Otherwise, we end up with the illogical conclusion that Wheeler (whom I otherwise greatly admire) is correct, and that observing the beginning of the universe, creates it. But other than the illogic of that, we haven’t observed the beginning of the universe, just about a billion years after its beginning, so, does that mean that nothing earlier than that billion years yet exists, and that it will require ever more powerful telescopes to “create” it? Does that mean that we will never see that creation (believed to be I’m;possible), and therefor, the universe never began at all? That’s the problem this concept brings up.  But other physicists believe, and I agree, that every particle or wave interaction can be considered to be a measurement, and therefore, an observation. No consciences required. That seems to make more sense.
This is the most disturbing episode yet. Like rokos basilisk, some ideas are upsetting to think about. If any of this time-reversed reality bending quantum woo is remotely true then the universe is even more bullshit than it already was
I think the next true breakthrough is going to be in the nature or maybe over all structure of information. Constructor theory seems to be chiefly concerned with information and now I find that Wheeler also realized that studying the structure of information might be the key to explaining everything
03:16 Thank's the computer Mr. Neumann! (And the computer language Mr. Kemeny)
“But that doesn’t mean we are in a black hole or a simulation…probably.” Exactly what a Matt sim would say
amazing, thanks
Alice and Bob sure do get around. Starting first in Computerphile videos, and now I see them appearing over here on PBS Space Time
The universe creates or recreates itself continuously.  The past was destroyed to create the present and the future hasn’t been determined yet. Time is a compact dimension one single Planck second in size.
I have long been distressed by the idea that the thing that *I* call myself, my consciousness, is not actually who I am to the world in the present moment, and that what I experience as the passage of time is really me experiencing these events as memories for the first time, and that my decisions in the now are not really my own, but instead the animal body that I inhabit. I'm distressed by the idea that I don't really exist *now* but instead some few milliseconds after what is currently going on.
I know it's binary responses however my question is, "why is the response only yes or no? Why can't it be yes and/or no? Or can't it be a fourth choice of null?  Doesn't that provide a better answer to these different philosophical views?
You will find Friends of Wigner wherever you go... if you look hard enough.
This was one of the best Spacetime episodes I've seen. And I've seen them all
After watching this video, I kinda go with Feynmann's idea of "just do the math". There is no need to interpret that of the chicken or egg paradox thingy. Wheeler's philosophy behind it just keeps getting more "wishy-washy". You took it too seriously, man.
Ask, You Shall Receive...Search and You Will Find...This is the Truth of Our Reality!
Crack pot time.  What if black holes are made of fundamental particles smaller then the Planck length? And due to the fact that it would be smaller then the smallest thing know to existence (so far) it is able to give the facade of (lack of better explanation) 2 atoms occupying up the same space. Or a more broad example, looking up at the night sky and pointing out a “light” in the night sky and saying “hey look at that star!” When in reality, you just pointed at two galaxy full of stars colliding into each other.  With that said, when a star dies and if the gravitational pull of all the fundamental particles are there and close enough, then they mash into each other to form something akin to a neutron star, but way more dense then a neutron star  Edit to add: and the reason we can’t “see” a black hole is because of the fact that the fundamental particles, even all together, are smaller then a Planck length?
So, once again science is confirming some of the fundamental concepts in the Neale Donald Walsch books, specifically the concept that there is only one thing here in this universe, and we are all part of the one thing, as individuations of that thing............
This is what I believe the universe is our God and evolution is our purpose everything else is personal we are life one in a infinite change to manifest our observer
Please make a video on how to become a theoretical physicist
The only way I can understand this is that the universe itself is conscious.
Human reality is explicitly an emergent phenomena on top of another reality.The way we naturally sense the world is just for convenience. We are conscious, yet our brains are made of semi independent networks of neurons. This small amount of knowledge, I believe is enough to categorically declare that only information is real, and that information must be able to be encoded on any medium which leaves the study of physics at it's limits to being the absurdity of finding an equation that can work out if it has been written with pencil on paper, or as chalk on a blackboard.  This leaves weird problems about if a copy of me is me too, and I think that time doesn't really need to exist (block universe), and if this is just book and if so is anyone reading it? If no one outside of this universe has to read it, I can't quite make self understand why it would need to be written in the first place on any physical substance, and if there is an "observer" that observer would have the exact same problem in their universe.  I know I am not adding anything of philosophical value. Variations of this has been troubling me forever.  If time doesn't exist and there is no one reading "the book" then all events are experiencing themselves which makes the Fermi paradox switch from being how unlikely it is to be the queen of England, to the quite banal prospect that a country like England should have a queen.
PBS not mentioning Shrödingers cat challenge. impossible
No, no it does not. Silly science warriors all lost to the true scale of the existence that exist. It's all multi dimensional, conscious, and intelligent. Reality is like a giant mind. A giant fractal, as above so below. If humans knew the true scale and nature of existence, we would probably go insane of how crazy it is.
Would someone explain the shown version of the delayed choice experiment (6:29) to me in simple terms. Specifically how does each element - beam-splitter when transmitting, beam-splitter when reflecting, mirror - affect the phase of the photons so they end up being out of phase going to detector two?

Not related to the video's topic at all, and I don't know if you've answered this before, but I've always wondered... Who are the people that you use for your "experiment" animations? High-level patrons? Members of your team? Stock photos?
.  How does asking the question does the universe create itself?" differ from asking the question does the universe stand on its own shoulders or beat the ace of trumps with any other card or removed from a table that which is not on the table?  Your better question is*can*the universe create itself any more than it can stand on its own shoulders, jump over its own knees, or beat the ace of trumps with any other card or removed from a table something that is not on the table?  In any event the fellow asks a question about something that he does not trouble himself to define, namely the universe.  Why does he talk about something of which he has absolutely no idea what he means by it?  I would challenge anyone that uses the word or words "the universe" to set out exactly how the understand the word or what they mean when they use it but when I asked them that they can never tell me;   they simply assume that they know what they mean by universe but none of them ever have any idea or certainly cannot tell me what they mean by the universe because it is of a vague  unfocussed or generalised idea with no specific meaning to them. they use the word but have absolutely no idea what they mean by it and anyone reading this would have to agree or set out clearly exactly what they mean by "the universe" although they are that in no position to set out exactly what they mean by "the universe any more than they can focus an unfocused photograph..
My favourite episode ever! I've been of the opinion that observations are being done all the time, everywhere by the forces between particles since I was at school! So glad that someone else at least suggested it could be right.
what if, get this, measurements were performed by separate ai or teams of theorist separate from each other and no interaction or info shared between, would the answer depend on who calculated it first and would reality cease to function if they came up with 2 separate measurements, could we calculate the future?
so maybe 'magic' / 'alternative physics' used to exist for humans, before our increasingly sophisticated interrogations nailed down the mechanics of reality into something consistent to all recorded observations?
Does reality have a John Carmac?
If you’d excuse me, I’m off to find an AI-powered online 20 questions bot and randomly hit yes / no with no discernible pattern until I create a universe
The Cat actually realizes nine unique superpositions relative to each situation. That said,  it seems more and more likely that we are discussing a holographic simulation. Maybe the level above us is trying to understand the best questions to ask before they paint their own reality into a corner.
Does this guy ever eat food?
More quantum mechanics please 😬😬
A cycling universe DOES NOT mean the universe created itself. Nothing cannot create anything. That’s a fact.
I honestly find the whole Schrodinger's Cat argument for the universe to be utter BS.  I will qualify this by pointing out I'm not a physicist.  The universe existed before humans existed to observe events. Seconds after the Big Bang, events still happened without someone there to observe them happening. The universe didn't exist as both banged and unbanged.
Sounds like we, and every other life form - before, now and in the future, willed the universe into existence.
I don't believe observations sets an outcome. Just like how it used to be thought that the Earth was the center of everything, maybe we are thinking our universe is the center. What's to say different dimensions of reality don't interact with each other. Could possibly explain quantum randomness and/or black matter.

Answer to the question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uYN7VDMmCI
I would be very interested in a deep dive on theories around just what an "observer" performing an observation is......  Does it have to be conscious/self aware?  Perhaps digging into what the minimum threshold for observation/measurement is.  Previous episodes on QM touched on this, but I would like to hear what different viewpoints exist in the scientific community.  And yes, I suggested this in the survey.....  This aspect of QM has always fascinated me.
I actually Googled Quantum WU
According to Douglas Adams the rats were studying us by carefully selecting where to go next in the maze. The observer is also the observed. That's the thing too with these 20 questions setups. It's an interaction that gets meaning from both the questioner and the questioned. They engage in negotiation over what is real. Between the one and the many. Between what already is and what needs to become.  So that finally answers the Fermi paradox.   So. Where are they? - ...  Ah no it doesn't. Its just words playing tricks with us.
i'd love to see more shows on wierd planets. espcially since i dont really understand all this math stuff
The participatory universe theory gives further weight to the notion I’ve held most of my life which is that the universe is a ‘context’ that allows it to observe and experience its own endless possibilities. Or as Brian Cox would say - we are a means for the universe to come to know itself, an idea held by some cultures for thousands of years. The oldest ones are often the best 😊
That Wheeler quote reminds me of Boards of Canada. "The past inside the present"
I'm too high for this bro omfg
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE ANIMATIONS?
Maybe Goethe’s participatory, phenomenological science was rejected too soon.
I've always been firmly on the Copenhage camp but what I would like to add is what Mr Einstein himself said. There is a real gravitational field independant of the inertia state of an object. This means that what's real of space-time is space-time itself
Hi!  This is a lot of nonsense.  Quantum study is nonsense.  It sense that when we can't find a solution to a problem we create an answer even if the answer is without substance.  It is the science that is without the scientific process and is therefore without use or meaning.
Happy Earthday 2022, Spacetime. As always, excellent work, Master Matt. The Force is with you, always
No matter how simplistic or   primal   the innate  primitive  act  is an intelligent behavior of a life form.   There is a God  that   explains  how we also  participate  to  carry  out  a single intelligent act.    If any behavior  is not  random  , then  it is an intelligent behavior.    So ,  we cannot see enough of the grain  of the view   to see the  object  as it exists,  we are not in focus to  comprehend what we see,  but if  we had vision  able to take in the data, it would appear to us   as God.
0:00 No, that is what mainstream modern physical science is doing with all their desperate data-fitting. Probabilistic McGuffins to patch the holes flashing by in opposition to classical grit of fundamental insight
Please please please do an episode on Roger Penroses Conformal Cyclic Cosmology theory!
Wow, this one was a _wild_ ride. NGL, I had to check that this video didn't actually come out on April 1st and I just missed it until now XD
Was our universe created in a higher dimension?
Cartoon: 'Then a Miracle happened'. Nothing can Create itself Before it is created. It would need to exist to give existence.
Can observation=interaction be done at a non concious level? So like your cells that measure temperature which is basically amounts of heat energy are constantly at work with or without your concious mind. So like "we" arent the only observers every living thing is also an observe or anything that can record information into its being thats "alive" i suppose??? Ive always wondered that about the cat experiment. Wouldnt the cat itself also be an observe meaning your independent observation of the cat wouldnt matter because its on observation would solidify its existance regardless of yours?
You are the universe, observing and experiencing itself.
Didn't Sabine debunk the delayed choice experiment?
18:23 "And it's not aliens, or a simulation either - probably."  Ah, but what about an *alien simulation*?  ;)
I don't understand why the desperate need to find something that defines the nature of realism to ground ourselves in, wouldn't our ability to observe and measure things make us more real than what where attempting to search for
I already submitted my survey and I didn't put in any episode ideas at the time (because I didn't have any), but I did get one (or perhaps it's just a general question that may or may not be addressed at the end of a future episode). Anyway, I'm writing it here in the hopes that it will be seen and read because I didn't want to submit a new survey and thus clog up your systems, so here it goes:  I recall reading somewhere that the idea that the universe was expanding was not exactly true, but rather it was that Time itself was slowing down. The concept of the expanding universe being a thing was really an artifact of scale and perspective. Simply put, to us the universe appears to be expanding...but in actuality, time is slowing down and eventually everything will be locked in place forever.  To be clear, I do not remember where I read this, but I will say that it was quite a long time ago (15...20 years maybe?), so I don't even know if that is even valid anymore when considering everything that was learned since then. All I can say is is that the idea sparked something in my imagination in how the universe works that I find intriguing and that it's something that my unscientific mind that really likes science (even if I can't wrap my head around enough of it to even hold a conversation) that just latched onto and won't let go of for some silly reason.  ...either way, I think it may make for some interesting content here, either to explore or utterly debunk.
Topics like this are not good for my mental health
Thank you! this video gave me that eureka moment of understanding. I've been obsessing over wave function collapse for years now but more and more so recently and this video has solidified some intuitions I've been frustratingly close to for about a month now. Always great videos thank you!!
What if the universe is a work of fiction, and every new scientific "discovery" is actually the writers trying to retroactively fix a plot hole?
I'm not happy with any definition of information that I've heard.
8:42 This is exactly how transformer language models work. Is reality a giant cloud of information that quantum interactions pull from to generate the universe?
Is it possible that the energy that is being, not lost but, wound down (Entropy) is actually being converted to what we consider dark energy?   We have anti-matter vs. matter, positron vs electron, wave vs. particle;  how can be sure there isn't 'anti-Entropy' vs. Entropy?
I'm glad that there are people whose minds can think like this are working on this question, because the only way I can make it all make sense is to imagine a "universal observer," i.e., God, and that seems like a copout.
are single molecules inside the Andromeda Galaxy real, right now, or is jsut the effect we can observe here real and the universe is saving on computational power by just rendering what's 'important'? Maybe it's just like a dream. we only render what we see and hear right now.  but wait, woowoo alert  to be honest, a materialistic realism gives me headaches aswell as religous approaches, none seem to explain anything about the true roots of existence and where the basic rules come from. it either "just is" or was "just made by magic allmighties that just where or are".  the whole problem leads to the more fundamental problem that and why anything exists. with all ideas of qualitatively destinct multiverses  accounted, we still have no idea why there is something at all, and why there are physical rules to begin with and emerge (a) universe(ses) from.  i don't know what's real. but that's fine, because so does everyone else. or pretends with to know with bogus
Space time is conscious so there is no non witness. Hence the term god sees all
The universe did not create itself, but has always existed! It's the only theory that makes sense, historically and scientifically!
This doesn't feel that much different from Copenhagen to me, feels like a different wording that almost allows two observers to see contradicting pasts
Physics questions what it means to observe something? Philosophy and psychology have noodled on similar subjects, free will and consciousness. Being from the psychology school myself I think that the central question is: what is consciousness. The other questions will have to wait until we figure that out. While some have claimed to know what it is and/or where it came from, the consensus is that we haven't even been able to define it.   Bon chance.
Can you please do less Cosmology, which is not really science (since many of its claims are not testable), and do more actual science videos?  I like the real science videos.  I dislike the cosmology nonsense.
The"Observerse" Theory by Eric Weinstein sounds similar. Did Weinstein just copied Wheeler???
i think yes, the trade off is energy density of energy, the universe spends limited energy to expand which leads to more land chasing the same amount of energy. there for things atrophy over time.
I think the problem is that the act of observe causes the shift in the quantum environment because we don't have the tools to measure without poisoning the sample or maybe is not even us poisoning it, rather than the observation itself causes it because the universe observes itself so anything in it observing something or not is irrelevant
The way people perceive and or communicate their perception of the universe is all a huge game of telephone. Thus creating our reality
A Real substrate, Not a Metaphorical one.
I thought that it was more about the act of measurement than being observed that would determine the photons position? I just ask cause I wonder if it's the observer does understanding the results matter? If perhaps you have the two detectors measuring how many photons hit them or if hey do.. if you had an outside person that knows nothing of the experiment or what the results mean and were sent to observe the results of the detectors would that kinda give a blind observation or control to the observer influencing it? And about the cat in the box.. if the cat does die by the random generator administering the method.. eventually that decaying cat would smell and direct visual observation isn't needed.. just saying if it's dead in there seems like the lab will eventually smell.. maybe it's more of a philosophical question like if a tree falls and no one is around to observe it does it make a sound? Just curious about whether its more about measurement than the observer..
I tend to favour the observable universe is the event occurring after the collapse of a 4th-Dimensional star.
in the copenhagen interpretation, what counts as a measurement. surely amplification. and hence an increase in entropy. this make the  cat killing mechanism an amplification of the original quantum event. thus no mental event is required for a measurement or onservation.
An explosion, becomes an implosion, becomes an explosion... becomes fused matter.... consider if empty space is made of elemental atoms in a neutral state waiting for use... call it 'creation matter'. Man's greatest downfall was the limits of ones own mind.
Adherents to BBT are simply beyond hope of mental adjustment, shutting up to Calculate..  So:- What it adds up to is Sciencing Re-search Methodologies, either WYSIWYG fitting of re-evolution phase-locked pulse superposition circularity quantization, cause-effect in/of QM-TIME ONE-INFINITY Singularity Completeness, or sitting at a Computer repeating assumpts about what comes from a purely mechanical Telescope far away, and the entire observation mechanism that was simple sight and sound integration is lost in mythologies.   Tabulation of time-timing sync-duration constants, by the Observer totally embedded in Eternity-now Actuality Interval is ALL there is-was-will-be here-now-forever.   When education research has found that students require constant repetition of lessons from somewhere in the region of seven different angles of approach.., and a particular curriculum has chosen to restrict all alternatives to one or two beliefs in authoritative precedents labelled as rote learned science without actual Sciencing.., WYSIWYG there too. In other words, collect and collate, and realization will eventually penetrate the fog.  On topic, the framing of the question is not tuned to the Student level, maybe to a Teacher who is accustomed reformatting lesson prep.., knowing by experience how the concept of Origin is heavily Spindoctored.
Amazing. Once again, proving why this series needs to be archived and preserved for future generations.
This channel is going to self-destruct soon. Thanks for all the learning Matt and the _PBS Space Time_ team.
No.
It’s very appropriate that the universe looks like an S bend.
Haha, You guys are crazy. God made it all
Not sure i could comprehend or at least imagine how a participatory reality would actually work. So, 3.5 billion years ago when cyanobacteria were around in extensive mats and before oxygen was in the atmosphere the universe had existed for about 10 billion years.  But conscious creatures did not make their appearance until relatively recently. If you accept these facts then how do you explain 10 billion years of cosmic evolution without conscious creatures.  There is an anthropomorphic virus lurking here, no?  Conscious creatures somewhere else? Not ready to go there without better arguments or measurements.
As a practitioner of quantum wu, that broke my heart.
Nobody still could explain what gravity is let alone to be secure with feeling certainty of 'believed ' facts that universes come up by coincidence ?
As the max velocity zero mass particles can reach which is in fact the same than speed of light. Since nothing can be faster than that, Could that be because this is the speed of time  flowing and that is why we cannot overcome this limit? I am not physicist just I am curious.
yes
To me it feels obvious that Entanglement involves 3 particles, the two entangled particles and the observer particle however 3 way entanglement is a 4 letter word in Physics.  The 3 particle entanglement in reality would be an all particle entanglement where the initial state of the third would be influenced by all interactions and in order to calculate the entangled state one would need to calculate a radius of particles equal in size to a sphere surrounding the triangle the 3 particles consist of.  Perhaps only half this sphere as the other should oppose the first.  IDK, just ramblings of a mad man who has little knowledge of it all and more importantly the math capabilities so even begin to write out such a solution. :(
... Probably.
So if we purposely refrain from asking specific questions, measuring specific information, could we then exploit that uncertainty? For fun and profit?
2:13 you mention Schrodinger as highlighting the *absurdity* of the Copenhagen  interpretation ....and then you go on to animate this, using two *black* scientists!?  Schrodinger wasn't black. Nor was any other scientist involved in this. Why did you *choose* to represent him thus? Is this video a precursor to next year's "Black people invented everything" month?    don't you think that capitulating to liberal demands is in itself the absolute epitome of *absurd* ???????  unless of course you are actually a libtard yourself?  why did you do this?
You can name names, math principles, quantum mechanics, all that stuff!......Real knowledge and intellect comes from admitting we know nothing!
Include the universe itself as an observer and observation no longer matters in the way we think it does
"If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask" (The Grey Lady from Harry Potter, aka J.K. Rowling)
That is because the Universe is ultimately made of Psychrons, these are the fundamental particles that humans have yet detected but will ultimately explain everything about this universe. Psychrons are temporal particles that behave like parts of a brain or a person's mind, except that mind is the total consciousness of everyone in the Universe. Do you understand that now?
The simulation is amazing.
Interesting and worthwhile video.
It took me many rewatches to fully grasp, but this concept is brilliant. It feels like it almost elevates the universe (or any extensive system) to the level of any observer, whether conscious or not.
The universe is not objective, nor is it subjective...it is instead intersubjective.
When you quote a famous physicist Then is that quote real Or did it only become real after the quote ?

Please review the idea of dark matter/energy as information, facinating and also related to this topic
"Information" is processed sensory input - sensory input processed (organized and re-presented symbolically) by a mind.  Information  does not exist somehow "out there" in the universe independently.
penrose has an issue with consciousness expressed with logic because of godel's incompleteness theorem. if the universe is truly it from bit then surely somethings missing from the equation. i don't know if its enough to simply stack 1's and 0's and call it cake. conway's game of life has rules, simple rules, and you get so much from it. i read an article not too long ago asking if we can imagine a universe without math and it suggested we couldn't. but perhaps we need to go beyond the math eventually and start looking for rules. like language has rules. can you give a logical reason for the english language? maybe somethings don't have a reason to exist and the key to understanding will be finding them. surely math is emergent from a set of conditions unaccountable to the rest of existence
I hope you're not calling the claim that conscious minds have direct power over reality quantum woo. This has been shown experimentally, by for example Dr. Dean Radin.
This is a good topic for the date.
Could "Dark Matter" have always been here before the big bang?, with the universe expanding through it. Imagine that Dark Matter being like "Oil", and our Universe like "water", they have slightly different properties/physics. We can't see Dark Matter but we can feel it, the oil does not mix with water, but it apples pressure and surrounds the water, creating clumps (galaxies) and applies inward pressure. If the oil was expanding, it would cause all the clumps of water to also move away from each other.
I like how this is a secular scientific version of "The tree exists in the quad, because it is observed by God." Back when Berkeley made his limerick, he put God as the central observer/creator of the universe; now we put humanity as the central observer/creator of the universe.  The only way the present theory makes sense is if we state that the universe appears to us the way it does because, given that our brain (and the tools it creates) is doing the observing, it can only be seen in a way which our brains can process.  Therefor, our brains are creating for our brains a universe our brains can understand with no bearing on the actual nature of the unknowable universe.  But beyond that, I don't understand the assumption that because we don't know the answer to something, therefore both contradictory answers to a given question actually physically exist.  This seems more a problem of human understanding, than the actual presence of mutually contradictory states existing as pre-observed quanta. One would have to insist that the beam splitter experiment was therefore improperly interpreted.
Why are the cutout animations like at 0:38, 2:24, and 4:35 always making fun of black people? Like, Jesus, the animations have been this way since the start of the channel, add some variety.  I wouldn't think PBS Space Time has a race problem if the animations haven't only been goofily including black people since the first video, goofily include some more variety, please.
Sounds like you have a grudge against Dark Energy in this episode, lol
This interpretation reminds me of Minecraft places don't exist until you visit them using an algorithm to generate the world where here the algorithm is quantum mechanics and the seed is defined with in the quantum mechanics running this reality but now we have to reverse engineer the possible seed from with in the world this could make it easy to search for specific structure and find the coordinates
"And to do that we just need to keep asking the right questions of a participatory (PBS) Space Time." Haha. Nice one! Nailed it ;)
The Universe is measuring and creating constantly itself by for example light, as light always is detected by something and causing a reaction like back, forward, ...scattering, reflecting, absorption, heating,... And there is this experiment where a positron and an electron is creating itself out of the nothing by taking an energy credit from the future which underlines.
Just accept. God created everything.
Such a pleasure to find my own thoughts/interpretation of the universe coincide so well to someone as Wheeler :D For years, I personally couldn't understand why the universe can't just be it's own observer? And here he basically says that's possibly how it is. Cool.
I've heard of something called entropic gravity, is that a species of "interaction creates reality" theories?  And on a different subject, your personal reality, the texture and events that make up your life, are almost certainly determined by 2 interrelating facts: the relationships you have, and how you react to them.   And finally, thanks Matt, this was a great episode.
In this case, would an observer be any probably existing object? Bigger objects are more likely to interact and collapse the waveform into an 'observed' state. If so would this mean that a bigger more stable waveform block, interfere, or contaminate the smaller more unstable waveforms?
What I don't get about Schrodinger's cat is the particle makes its choice before the box is opened. The mere act of opening the box doesn't collapse the wave function. The particle did that well before hand. In other words the super position of the particle's state can't travel up into the real world. Or in even more words, Quantum mechanics only works for particles with little to no mass and it would be a mistake to extrapolate that up into something as big as a box with a cat in it.
The Universe has always existed. There is no creation, no beginning or end.
Wave function collapse is pretty hard to understand in the case where the particle isn't there when you measure it, at least for me. I can understand the wave function change but not how it happens
There are two forces in space. Space is a stationary, constant, negative field of resistance (cold). Motion is heat (temperature) in resistance, to space. Heat also is a constant value. Heat can accumulate to create, gravitational fields of forced motion, holding mass together, in equalization of pressure, pushing outward equally  in the negative field of resistance that is space. Mass has to cycle heat to exist. That's gravitational fields of forced motion holding mass together. Magnetic fields of forced motion holding atmospheres together, are weaker, gravitational fields of forced motion holding mass together. Heat rising rapidly in an atmosphere, burn through creating waves of light and sound. All mass is heat in motion at different temperatures. We absorb mass to retain our temperature. Hydrogen absorbs heat to become helium. All mass contains negative fields of resistance as solidity, in fluidity, of gravitational fields of forced motion holding mass together. Occupational space is the transference of mass repelling outward pressure of resistance to space as expansion. Mass retains solidity because we are traveling through a refrigerator of resistance to motion (heat). Heat is the fluidity of space. It trickles  through, then amassing into a creek, then a stream, river, etc...Space is the ocean. When a star collapses, it releases the gravitational fields of forced motion holding mass together into free-flowing spacemotion. As whirlpools in space, redistributing heat to trickling, until it amasses elsewhere. Space doesn't bend or curve. The mass of occupational areas of space are occupied in gravitational fields of forced motion holding mass together. So the negativity of space isn't as forceful between proximity occupational mass, as they pass one another. So the greater negatively of space repelling the mass in occupied space towards larger objects of occupation. The trajectory is acted upon by repelling outward pressure towards the weakest point of resistance. Heat and cold. Alpha and Omega. All mass is heat in motion. Solidity is gravitational fields of forced motion. Fluidity is loss of heat in resistance, producing free-flowing spacemotion.
Who is the scientist with the fro always used?
Oops ... the Universe May Be as "Real" as our imagination  PSYCHOLOGY BIOLOGY CHEMISTRY PHYSICS CONSCIOUSNESS   Given the double slit quantum erasure experiments the past 100+ years, it's beginning to look like the "scientists" are running out of falsifications for the theory that consciousness is the substrate for physics...
I'm confused about how an observer observing their universe is separate from their universe. The definitions separating the observer from the observed seem arbitrary. Does an observer need to be separate from an observed phenomenon (i.e. big bang)? What counts as a separator between the observer and observed?
The way you said probably makes me fear 🤣
Did dinosaurs see stars?
This actually sounds like how I often run games of dnd. The players enter somewhere, a place I have yet to fully design. Then, as the players ask questions "is this room well lit?", "how far away is the next door", "can I climb this wall?", it forces me to choose the nature of the location. Only because the players asked did the room become how it is now! With that analogy, I now imagine the universe being asked by scientists "how does this work?" and the universe stuttering as it poorly explains a property, as the scientists fervently write notes.
It already feels like the world outside me is a reflection of my inner world. Sometimes I think the people I know are just facets of me, and I'm just talking to myself in some lonely eternity.
5:48 actually, let's not... this is not how photons work, they do not travel. the _wave_ "travels", the photons merely oscilate.
You silly man ! Everbody knows that gawd created the universe !  🤣
these thought experiments make my brain itchy
It makes sense what happens if a tree falls and no one knows about it? If we don't have validation, we can't tell whether it is accurate or false. In our history, we have a lot of data points. However, when we don't, then it becomes a myth, and when all living things and records are gone, that event diapers from history. So yes, we build the past in the today.
This is hilarious—years ago, I started the outline of a cosmic horror novel in which this is pretty much exactly the case, regarding the nature of reality. Almost complete guess on my part, just an idea I thought was neat and...disturbing.
I feel like psychedelic mushrooms put my mind in a state of super position haha
Wheeler was right because I dreamt it last night 🎉😂🎉🎉🎉
I was going back and watching some of the first videos on this channel again and i really liked the video game references while talking about the science of it. As much as i truly love the kinds of videos you release now, if you want video ideas then you should try going back to the roots of the channel  Like what if you did a video on "Could the Phase Distorter in Earthbound actually work?" Idk... can you download a brain? If it'a converted to pure information, can it travel forewards in time? Etc
I may have misunderstood, but what I got from this is that it should be possible to devise a series of negative 20 questions that ends with the universe assigning me superpowers.  BRB, gotta do some questioning.
Wouldn't matter/energy be the probe to space/time? Like shouldn't it be looked at as two interdimensional foreign bodies interacting to form our reality.
Helló! Az a baj hogy túl komlikálod! De  ennél sokkal  egyszerűbb! Nem látjátok a valóságot ! Csak találgattok! Káosz gondolatok csak zavart okoznak !  Miért? Mert féltek ! Mitől ? Önmagatoktól!  Egó! Lejjebb kellene adni! Ok!
ThAnKs DaRk EnErGy~! 🤣
I'm not a physicist by any stretch.  I'm a lawyer that stopped his physics education at freshman level calculus-based physics.  So I apologize if this sounds super "woo" but I'm curious if it is plausible on current understanding or if there is anyway this would be testable.  I've always sort of liked the idea that the only "reality" is informational.  That the universe only exists as the math and information and we construct everything else from our sensory processing and conscious interpretation.  I also know that there's the concept of us progressing to a singularity.  What if, then, what was think of as consciousness is just a causality force along one direction of the time axis that is unifying information into a singularity.  Everything we do through measurement and development of our own understanding and of artificial intelligences is all part of that current leading towards a finality of informational assimilation.  At the same time, what we perceive of as entropy is actually an equal and opposite force along the time axis, leading to the informational consolidation of a singularity in the past.  Also, if dark energy is a consolidation energy reversed in time, we are in the late stage of this reverse causality.  So late that we perceive it as unifying information in such drastic ways that it's a literal consolidation of what we perceive as matter and energy and spacial dimensions into a single point.  Is this nuts?  Is this complete metaphysical mysticism crap?  Is this something other real scientists have thought of and I just can't find it because when I google, I get bogged down in a bunch of entries from metaphysical crap?
да
its 420 and the man had to come blow my mind harder then this joint
Episode Idea:  Can you please consider creating a limited series, or at least one episode, exploring and explaining Eric Weinstein’s “Theory of Geometric Unity?” Links below for more info, Thanks!  https://geometricunity.org/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7rd04KzLcg (lecture starts @34:21)
if you want to know the real truth of this unverse..first you have to understand "SUN"..because everything you can see is just mere manipulation of sun rays.....however you cant understand this universe by "WAVE FUNCTION" which doesnot have any reality its just a mathematical concept...
Funny part is that from a psychological point of view as well, the brain is able to both build his persona and recreate the world he witness from the senses, and use that inherently "fuzzy" description of both aspects as a necessity from an incompletely written past and a motor to act into it's own unknowable future.
This sounds like: God created consciousness so he could prove to himself that he exists.
Yeah, I generally get the feeling that reality is making this all up as it goes along, too.
The last Thursday-ism perhaps, I'd like a rational explaination that I can't think of by myself
Not being smart enough to make a definitive statement on anything, but having studied a bit of many things, I will still offer that I find it amazing how seemingly disparate areas of human inquisitiveness, be it theoretical physics, existential philosophy, or even theology, are much more entangled (partial pun intended) than they might at first admit. None of them seem to provide a definitive answer to the question, does the universe exist without observers? I often come back to the first stanza of the Tao Te Ching which, to me, implies that the more we strive for this answer, the further we get from it. That it is ineffable. It is as though we are using different tools (i.e. mathematics, philosophy, theology, etc.) to try and chip away at the statue hidden within the marble block that is our representation of the universe. And yet, we are only ever making a statue, a representation. We are never recreating the subject itself. It makes existence a maddeningly elusive miracle to describe and yet the nature of desire to inquire on the subject is eminently captivating and should never be abandoned.
sir I have an question, thing like paper is made up of cellulose and starch, polythene and cotton etc then how do gravity made up of
I'm with Feynman in this one. It seems to me that any interpretation it taking highly complex math, some of which probably includes statistics and turning it upside down, explaining the uncertainties from statistics as uncertainties of the universe. Whe don't know exactly what is happening at sub atomic scales, or even sub-plank scales. Every interpretation seems to tend to spiral in a Descartes-like line of thought with the only possible conclusion that you can't be sure of anything, including reality, and then climbing back the ladder by realizing that thought itself proves existence, then observing things prove their existence, and so on.
In the beamsplitter experiment, in the perspective of the photon, isn't it the same if the second splitter was put there before or after the photon was emmited? If the photon goes through both splitters in the same conditions, you should get the same result, right? You could even remove the first splitter and have no splitter for a brief moment. Like jumping on a trampoline blindfolded, if the trampoline isn't there while you're in the air, it doesn't make a difference as long as it is there when you land.
The most 420 episode ever, love it.
God exists only when we believe in God?
How do I make/get a transcript of this video's text?
🤑
This means that one day I could walk out to my car to go painting and instead, find a horse for getting there. At least the horse is not restricted to roads.
In quantum tunneling effect if we put a detector just like the slit experiment, and if a photon partly escapes the barrier whereas the other part of the same photons travels back, but the detector can detect the part of the photon escaped. So how can we assure that the reality is constant with that uncertainty of position of the particles?? So does that means that information is partly conserved here??
Is there a difference between observation and measurement? Observation has conscious awareness of physical reality, while measurement also manipulates physical reality with the effect of constructing physical reality? Possible that the it of physical reality comes from bit of measurement, with observation of both?
Maybe mathematics goes from subjective general abstraction to objective particular equations?
What is energy? Not how it is, but what it is.
In participatory universe, in order for universe to have had a past leading up to the present would have required continual observation of universe all the way back to big bang start of universe?
Thank you Caveman from Geico
I get it.. bunch of squiggles, talking to other forms of squiggles..🤮 weird right? Kinda profound.. 🕊🕊 I think we’re meant to fly.. look at the birds and bees. They are but a template.. to what’s possible
So the quantum eraser experiment makes me wonder if instead rewriting the future, there's simply a resonant harmonic in the time axis. We can't experience time as though it were a spacial dimension but that doesn't mean light can't also, especially since it experiences time all at once
Quantum mechanics has probability of many observations / measurements, which together have uncertainty? Could measurement(s) of quantum probability not be completely random, rather be related to time?
with quantum mechanics the world or rather the univers is weird enought but now with this proposal its really way off now???
I'm a fan of the delayed computation interpretation. Much like a highly optimised computer program, why calculate something before you need the answer? You might not need the answer if a previous calculation invalidates it. Why change information or generate new information if you don't need to?
Observations are bits, of non-physical information; while nature / universe is the it of physical information?
Exchange of information connects physical reality and observation?
I find the double slit experiment mind boggling.
No
So, from the observational point of view of the cat, there are only happy scientists. i.e there is no observational symmetry for the Schrodinger's cat experiment for all observers?   Does that then mean that the happy scientist canceled out with the sad scientist in the wave function collapse in which the cat died from the cats perspective resulting in no measure of sad scientists?
Therefore, physics is just filoso philosophy with extra steps
The sound of the falling tree only exist if someone observes it.
Has anyone wondered whether there is just one consciousness ?  Mine.  Everybody, everything else is a projection on this one consciousness.
It's just a clever way on saving cpu time and ram. We're living in a simulation and "creating" things as we observe it.
"How is it possible for observers to share a single consistent reality?"  Reply: How would anything be different if they don't?
So if the universe is an infoverse, then it plausible that the earth is in fact flat.   It all depends upon asking the right questions in the proper order.
I think I know how the cat feels. Lol
As I explained to viewers of this channel a few years ago. The universe we experience is both real and unreal. As long as we seek answers the Question will remained unanswered. The truth comes to you like a bee to a flower. A conundrum for sure. As long as we seek an individual experience there will be an universe to experience phenomena in. Wrapping our heads around the basic concepts of infinite and eternal is difficult enough, but without these concepts we find ourselves at an even greater loss. There is in reality only here and now. Everything happens all at once or not at all. We dig the hole we fall into. As long as we keep digging there will yet be another layer for us to break through just so we can continue having an individual experience of the universe. In reality there is this super positioning, of both individual experience and an experience of unity. In order to discover the objective truth we need transcend duality. Until we take consciousness into account we will be lost to phenomena. Even so this reality is only available for those who experience it themselves. Science has yet to even scratch the surface of the endless universe around us. FTL propulsion is possible, but to what end? Seeking answers to all the mysteries of the universe can literally take forever. We can move on to experience every convoluted and exquisite or treacherous perambulation there is, and never know peace. We are free to feel lost, even when we're not. If you want to know the absolute truth you will have to experience it for yourself. You are one with the universe just as you are one with your dreams. The Tao te Ch'ing is a good place to start. The canon of Kashmir Shaivism another. Good luck.
Sounds like a cosmic computer working on a question to which the answer is 42.
Wow! This is exactly my beliefs. I never heard it explained in words before. I believe that nothing completely unsensed exists... including (and especially) our universe.
This universe of which we can physically determine is but a clinker or eddy in the flow of energy that is trying to find its Path Of Least Resistance back to neutrality,  Like a river it has whirlpools or black holes. Because of its quantum spin when the eddy is forming,  the same randomness creates patterns throughout our physical presence as can be seen from spirals and the Fibonacci sequence.  Time is but the motion of this flow expanding like a teardrop out of the flow.  Dark matter is the nothingness that the flow has to push through therefore its resistance creates gravity waves. Well it sounded poetic?
Oh, dear - Alice and Tom. Mixed race millenials being demeaned as diversity shoe-ins.  I see PBS Space Time hates large people, too?
Could the fabric of space time itself be dark energy?
The universe could be a multidimensional fractal set of regenerative excogitative algorithmic equations where our consciousnesses introduce information that enable the endomorphismic manifestation of an apparent relative space-time reality matrix, but probably not.
Hey Matt I am sub Ed so hit me back.pls I was wondering when I start like our is a white dwarf for a long time and has been cooling. Disregarding for a moment the crushing gravity. But would the being a period of time when the white dwarf would be considered warm and nice to be on temp.. wise. And how long do you think that time would last. And of course super mech suits allow us to move about on the dimming star. Cheers
merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily life is but a dream
Funny thing about absolute truth reality:  It still is and always will be absolute truth reality.  (Whether people know that truth or not and/or whether they believe that truth to be true or not).  "The best way to deal with absolute truth reality is to deal with absolute truth reality.  And if one is not dealing with absolute truth reality, then one is not dealing with absolute truth reality.  Find and deal with absolute truth reality."  (OSICA)  Absolute truth is NOT a popularity contest.  There were times in human history where only a single human being knew more of the real truth that was discovered than any other human in history.  And note also:  Denying future reality will not make future reality any less real.  People just won't be prepared for it is all.
Consider the following:  Language, the very thing we utilize to think thoughts and convey ideas.  Un-named Concepts -> Given a Name (could be a sound, symbol, etc) -> With an attached meaning -> And maybe even other meanings depending upon context -> And maybe even other names with the same meaning.  (Basically a Dictionary and a Thesaurus for a language).  BUT: a.  How exactly do we know for 100% certainty that we have all the un-named concepts that could ever be named? b.  How exactly do we know for 100% certainty that the meanings we give named concepts are 100% correct?  We truly do not know what we do not know.  This is a part of the 'Great Unknown'.  Never stop learning.
Is this related to eric weinstein's geometric unity theory?
GRAVITY:  (copy and paste from my files): Here is the test for the 'gravity' portion of my TOE idea.  I do not have the necessary resources to do the test but maybe you or someone else reading this does, will do the test, then tell the world what is found out either way.  a. Imagine a 12 hour clock. b. Put a magnetic field across from the 3 to 9 o'clock positions. c. Put an electric field across from the 6 to 12 o'clock positions. (The magnetic field and electric field would be 90 degrees to each other and should be polarized so as to complement each other.) d. Direct a high powered laser through the center of the clock at 90 degrees to the em fields. e. Do this with the em fields on and off. (The em fields could be varied in size, strength, density and depth.  The intent would be to energy frequency match the laser and em fields for optimal results, cancelling out the em modalities of the laser, thereby leaving behind the gravity modality.) f. Look for any gravitational / anti-gravitational effects. (Including the utilization of ferro cells so as to be able to actually see the energy field movements.) (And note:  if done right, it's possible a mini gravitational black hole might form.  Be ready for it.  In addition, it's possible a neutrino might be formed before the black hole stage, the neutrino being a substance with a very high gravitational modality with very low 'em' modalities.)  (An alternative to the above would be to direct 3 high powered lasers, or a single high powered laser split into 3 beams, each adjustable to achieve the above set up, all focused upon a single point in space.)  'If' effects are noted, 'then' further research could be done. 'If' effects are not noted, 'then' my latest TOE idea is wrong.  But still, we would know what 'gravity' was not, which is still something in the scientific world. This test can speak for itself.  It will either be true, partly true, or not true at all.  It will either show what gravity truly is, might be, or is not.  Science still wins either way and moves forward.  *  And note:  Whether my gravity test or another's, a gravitational black hole would have to be formed to prove the concept as being really true.  A gravitational black hole that 'if' self fed itself, could literally wipe out this Earth and all on it, possibly this solar system, possibly put a black hole in this section of our galaxy, and potentially even causing a ripple effect in this galaxy and surrounding universe.  But hey, if it does, no worries.  Nobody would be left to prosecute those who did so.  (Possibly famous last words:  "Hey, it worked.  Ooooppppssss.................)  But as NASA has already proven that low gravity conditions over a prolonged period of time is harmful to the human species, and large rotating space ships won't really work for space bases on planets and moons, those space bases probably being needed somewhere along the way out of this solar system and galaxy, we need to figure out what gravity truly is and see if we can generate artificial gravity so as to have smaller space ships and proper gravity conditions for space bases on planets and moons.  Otherwise, at least all human life will most probably die and go extinct one day.  Currently, no exceptions.  **  Added note:  Just trying to save at least 1 single species from this Earth to exist beyond this Earth so that life itself from this Earth has continued meaning and purpose to.  Gives me something to do while I exist, otherwise, what is it all and everything for?  Even if my TOE idea were correct, but if it did not help species survive beyond this Earth, what good would it ultimately be?  So, are you feeling lucky?  Doing nothing and at least the entire human species eventually dies and goes extinct with a high degree of certainty.  Doing a gravity test, (mine and/or another's), and there is at least a slim chance of literally wiping out this entire Earth and all on it, and possibly more.  Do you and other's truly want me to prove my TOE idea as being really true?
This reminds of the way Alan Watts talks about the nature of the universe - based on ancient Eastern philosophy.
Impressive!  Does his mean that I might be able to contact my Mother who passed away years ago?  Seriously, it seems we are in some sort of "Flatland" and can see effects that can only be fully comprehended if we could sense some higher dimension(s).
a.  Modern science claims energy cannot be created nor destroyed, hence energy is eternally existent. b.  An absolute somethingness cannot come from an absolute nothingness, so an absolute somethingness always existed, most probably being energy itself. c.  Universe ALWAYS existed in some form and NEVER had a beginning, No Creator Needed.  'a' is true, is it not?  'b' is true, is it not?  If 'a' and 'b' are true, then no creator is needed in 'c'.
Anyone know who they use for the faces of their animated scientists?  Hehe, just always wondered if they were people who work on the show of other actual scientists!
Maybe the universe is an RPG game.  There is essentially nothing in the treasure chest until you open it.  Then the DM/universe rolls the dice and looks at the chart to determine what treasure you get.
PBS Space Time: 1.  What exactly is 'space'? 2.  What exactly is 'time'?
Wave, Partical Duality, Better explanation? It is only an idea on my part but it goes something like this: 1. Charged particles have their associated magnetic fields with them. 2. Protons and electrons are charged particles and have their associated magnetic fields with them. 3. Photons also have both an electrical and magnetic components to them. 4. Whenever a proton, electron, or photon is shot out of a gun, it's respective magnetic field interacts with the magnetic fields of the electrons in the atoms and molecules of the gun itself, the medium the projectile is traveling through (ie: air), and/or from around the slits themselves. 5. Via QED (quantum electrodynamics), newly generated photons might occur. 6. The projectile goes on it's own way and the newly generated photons go on their own way.  It gives the illusion of a wave particle duality, but it is not that way in actual reality. 7. Specifically in the case of protons or electrons, the newly generated EM wave travels faster than the particles. The new EM waves go through both slits and sets up "hills and valleys" of field energy. When the proton or electron goes through one of the slits, it then follows whatever "valley" it enters thereby over time, even shooting only one proton or one electron at a time, the interference pattern will still emerge. 8. As far as detectors are concerned, they probably have an energy field that is one way when on and a different way when off.  The interaction of this energy field (or the lack thereof) with whatever is passing through it, gives the indication that is observed.  Now, for those who hold fast to reality being probability waves that are condensed down by an observer into one single physical reality, then: a. What exactly are these probability waves made up of? b. Where exactly are these probability waves stored at until they are observed? c. How exactly does an observer in physical reality actually observe these probability waves and condense them down into one single physical reality? d. Who and/or what observed the first observer? e. What exactly happens when two or more observers observe different probability waves?  Which one takes precedent in physical reality?  For me, while this observer condensing probability waves down into one single physical reality might work well on paper, it does not appear to reflect actual reality.  Now, utilizing the scientific principal of Occam's razor, which way is more probably correct?  My way by utilizing known scientific principals, or that is as discerned on paper as stated above is how reality actually is?
We are all parts of the universe that have manifested into forms that allow it to experience itself subjectively :)
Consider the following: a.  Numbers:  Modern science does not even know how numbers and certain mathematical constants exist for math to do what math does.  (And nobody as of yet has been able to show me how numbers and certain mathematical constants can come from the Standard Model Of Particle Physics).  b.  Space:  Modern science does not even know what 'space' actually is nor how it could actually expand.  c.  Time:  Modern science does not even know what 'time' actually is nor how it could actually vary.  d.  Gravity:  Modern science does not even know what 'gravity' actually is nor how gravity actually does what it appears to do.  e.  Speed of Light:  'Speed', distance divided by time, distance being two points in space with space between those two points.  But yet, here again, modern science does not even know what space and time actually are that makes up 'speed' and they also claim that space can expand and time can vary, so how could they truly know even what the speed of light actually is that they utilize in many of the formulas?  Speed of light should also vary depending upon what space and time it was in.  And if the speed of light can vary in space and time, how then do far away astronomical observations actually work that are based upon light and the speed of light that could vary in actual reality?
So, the Universe began to exist a Planck Time ago, essentially now, and it only exists because myself, that was created at the same time, perceive it. It goes according something I once read: "Each one of us is the center of his own universe". Then each one of us represent a universe interacting with a multitude of others? Dunno, but if it is the case, I wish I have had more time to create a better Earth. Anyway Matt have yet to tell what are the drugs of choice of the Physicists, I want to take them too!
I really love where you folks at PBS Space Time went with this episode!!  I found it very entertaining in the idea of verifying our observation of reality.  Thank you for the food for thought.
Reality is created by a thinker thinking a thought to itself about itself so as to arrive at a conclusion. What is thinking the thought may be what some of you call god.
Consciousness is a physical system just like any other. Nothing special about it, except for us humans ofcause.  Why some want to ascribe a special meaning to consciousness is really sad. Especially when it comes from a learned person.  An observer has nothing to do with a brain or consciousness in general. Ofcause not. It's even intuitive... How else would the universe evolve?
Would it be theoretically possible for a universe to create itself out of nothing if the equation was perfectly balanced in time and quantity, a bit like matter and antimatter and the two sides  equalling zero?  Hope it's not a stupid question.  Great video!
In Herman Hesse's "The glass bead game". We are introduced to the idea of quantifying a single truth property to form a bead. Much like our periodical table of pure elements. Each pure element would be a bead in itself. We have a certain understanding about how elements are created. Each has properties different throughout from hydrogen to uranium, in their pure form. Then there are compounds of elements, which in themselves differ in their properties. And in orientation also change their properties. What I am trying to get at, is that the nature of reality changes from its quantum parts of elements (protons, neutrons, and the things that make them. electrons, etc.) As these things grow from their interactions. To form such things as planets and life. It is a growth to a complexity of interaction. Sodium, and Clorine are poisons to the human body, but their compound Sodium Chloride is essential for that life. I as a human being believe that what I observe macroscopically is real. Einstein's relativity, spacetime concepts are trustworthy. That we have found that quantum physics does work also. And has led to many advancements in material science, and bioscience. Something we can use. In a way we can really see that the universe does create itself. It is that complexity of its own creative process we are trying to uncover. We have mapped our DNA, but still do not fully understand it. It is a complexity. There is always more to know if we can only survive long enough to discover them.
This one blew my mind yet again! Awesome 👍🏼
The real question is:    "Why does the Universe bother to exist?" This removes the question from "mechanisms" of how the Universe might be evolving. Why bother having a "Big Bang" ???? What gives?    What's wrong with "nothing"?
I'm not a fan of the observer-analogy as it implies an intelligence of some sort, when intelligence is not needd at all to count nor measure (which I belive was shortly explained somewhere in the 10-12th minute mark, by the observer existing when two particles collide).  Food for thought: Is the observer in fact a fundamental particle/entity required for the universe to exist at all? But we have no method to observe the observer?
if Einstein woke up physics -  quantum physics gave it a shot of adrenaline
Thinking about it as an information processing system makes this sound very reasonable. The act of “observation” is really an act of data/information transfer, from one area of the universe (the emitter) to another (the observer). Taking dirt from one part of your lawn and tossing it to another should naturally change the growth pattern of your lawn.  I think an interesting question is whether an “observer free” universe (and thus an interaction free universe) is even possible. Such a universe would have to be completely random or completely uniform all the way through.
Sound was out of sync. Graphics jumped and jittered. Your cut left half a word hanging. These scientists. Intriguing speculation however.
Man the reason this channel is better than most others is because it never ends the video unfinished: he always explores the subject satisfyingly fully
So the universe is procedurally generated based in the input of the interactions/measurements made... sounds like something a fancy machine learning algorithm could do, but right, totally not a simulation
Hey dude I don't mean to be uh
The "delayed choice" experiment would only be puzzling if one didn't expect a polarizer to polarize light.  In other words, before passing the first polarizer, the photon could have been generated in any polarization, the first polarizer applies a torque that allows for light to choose between vertical or horizontal.  Once that is done, the horizontal photon will remain horizontal and the vertical photon will remain vertical.  There is no surprise or the need for self-interference to explain light always arriving onto a single detector. What was missing in the current explanation is that a polarizer is not a passive device. It will add torque to light.  The time-dependent Schrodinger's equation for a photon traveling in a vacuum would not change that photon polarization. In fact, polarization doesn't even enter Schrodinger's equation.  The only "mysterious" step in this experiment is "the observation performed by the first polarizer".  That is trivially explained by a torque.  The interaction of light with matter is modeled by the exchange of momentum (light interaction with a crystal, for example). It is no skin off my nose to understand that a torque could be applied by a polarizer.  Compare that hypothesis with the current one where a whole Universe is created at every single interaction of light with a polarizer!!!!!  Occam's Razor would force each and every one of those amazing scientists to just accept the simplest hypothesis or accept that their proposal is a barbaric dogma.
Possible error: Wikipedia states that David Mermin said "shut up and calculate," not Richard Feynman.
No, ALLAH Create all of the creation
Crap...  This video contains a lot of crappy ideas.  No wonder garden-variety people feel entitled to question reality.
So reality is like a procedurally generated map in a video game.
More like a game of Battleships, where the Universe is constantly repositioning its pieces behind the screen, in response to our guesses, like Hamm in Toy Story.
When a video has a question for it's title, the answer is usually no.
More on this subject please. I can’t find enough out there on the fundamental participation of the conscious observer at a quantum or macro level. Reading Robert Lanza has some relationship to this but it seems he’s repeating the ideas of Wheeler (to some extent at least).
I know I exist because I observed my existence before I existed.
Wrong question. How can the universe create itself without a beginning?- this is the correct thing to ask
There is use of the field of  data analysis in cricket nowadays,what it does is that it takes data from the past and makes probable predictions for the future and i think that this is how science is, we just keep observing and make probable predictions on the stuff that we see from past experiences and maybe this is what we can all do
How about this: Multiverse (in many worlds sense) is actually a single continuous space of possible states. Continuous in such a way that every 2 near points of states can be traversed by not breaking laws and patterns we observe in our universe. Our universe and it's complete history and future is just a subset of this multiverse, just a curvy wiggly line drawn through it. Asking questions is not changing the curves and wiggles of this line along the way. We can only ask such questions in a line that curved and wiggled like that to begin with.
One interesting concept to consider is squeezed light here.  The Universe has an observability limit where past a Planck size you get micro blackholes.  Experimentally the uncertainty itself can be controlled at both ends of it.  That's how we know gravitational waves exist in fact.
It’s bc our reality is a construct. All here was created. We are the characters in “It’s “ video game. Our “reality” seems “real” to us because we are WITHIN it.
IMO, substrate to reality could be within the "dark sector". Only exchanging information with "us" through Gravity, but i guess somewhere we should admit that all "ideas", "concepts" and "instructions" should exist somewhere and someway interact with us, as when we interact with reality, our consciousness "creates" objects, sounds and emotions
John Archibald Wheeler Cue the JAW's theme...
How can the universe be created by the interaction between an observer and that which is observed? Both the observer and the observed would have to exist, which cannot be until they have interacted.
You mean the simulation, right?
So... someone who's job is to try to find out as much truth as can be determined by testing hypotheses... decided that truth is constructed by testing hypotheses.
So the final answer is neural networks.
I'm going to use some of this footage in here to make my own videos and to make a case for what you call woo and simulation that we are in
This video makes me think of Umineko.
A good number of years ago a article called Space  if I recall right in Astronomy Magazine covered a theory there might even be just one observer and the rest of us just part of their imagination. Ive seen this in some Sci Fi as the One True Observer. And I think the author said they seen the math so can't dismiss that idea out of hand even though of course it a small minority scientific view.   It is mental fun thinking I'm the only one that actually exists the rest of you are my imaginary creations. Although that makes me really mad at my imagination for not observing I'm ruler of all with all the perks and benefits.
Idea: the programmer of our simulated reality implemented quantum mechanics as a compression algorithm. In that way they didn’t have to define all variables unless used (observed). And we’re all scratching our heads…
What makes us the observes? When a photon passes through the first mirror, we assume that the mirror is not an observer. But when it passes through our eyes (or a detector) it's suddenly observed. What makes us different from the first mirror? Why isn't measurement happening only when somebody reads the outcome in a research paper, with all possible outcomes existing before that moment?
Realities version of frustum culling
No God creates the universe
I asked my GF to try the double slit experiment and she slapped me.  Yeah, she's that anti-science.
If there is no observer, there is no universe. The existence of anything is meaningless unless there is an observer. So consciousness would have to be the 'substrate' the universe is based on.
Eventually everyone will start realizing we live in a simulation.
I have wrestled with the question of objective outside world versus the single consciousness for a very long time & still no answer.  But both factors seem to be the answer.  A consciousness observing a world of forms that refine the reality???
This episode was top notch
Wasn't the whole  'Schrodinger's cat'  example supposed to be a paradoxical joke ?
Imagine the the Big Bang is a repeating cycle. We will all be alive again in the next universe.
4 dimensional beings must be tickled at us arguing over schrodingers cat
Reminds of a question in class from my old job.  If a tree falls and no one is around to hear it dies it make a sound? technically no,  as sound requires a receiver, so if there is none there no sound.. but there is but how do you prove it without a receiver.
I wonder, what if not all 3 (4) dimensions where there at the beginning of "our" universe?  I try to imagine that all started with 1 dimension and then somehow transformed into 2 and than into three? Who is willing to think about this?  At present, most theories are top down (what is now and turning the clock backwards). I try to come up with a bottom up approach.
It’s always funny to me how much man is so desperate to separate themselves from the world as if they aren’t of it and inescapably bound to it. Man vs nature and man vs animal as if we are not natural or animals ourselves.
Wheeler's idea about the present actively creating the past only works if there is only one real moment.  The moment we are experiencing now will, a moment later, be revealed to have been not real after all; it was just created in the real moment which is now.  But I'm just creating that then from this now, so that wasn't real either.  You can see where I'm going here; it's like Wheeler proposed retrocausality.  It is only one moment less realist than Copenhagen and doesn't make things any simpler, in my opinion.
The biggest mystery question in the Universe is " Why are Atheists are so stupid?" 🤦‍♂️
No, read your Bible,  God created it.
Doesn't take a stupid rocket scientist to figure it that God created the universe... it Duh 🤦‍♂️
I never seen anyone ask so nicely for me to take a survey before. Done.
Is it possible that the observer is just the past particles' arrangement (already collapsed wave function) which is initiated at time zero (Big Bang) and it’s keep creating its own reality, and we are just a sophisticated form of information part of this path?!
Episode idea: Could you elaborate on how Wheeler's "it from bit" fits in with the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem, specifically thinking about work from John Conway and Kochen about a no-go theorem where there are sequences of observables that are mathematically impossible. If true, this seems like it might support Wheeler's interpretation. Is this even testable? Or is this something that quantum physicists don't put much weight in? I'd *love* to hear spacetime's take on this.
No. God did!
Our conscious is a natural product of all the biochemical reactions going on in our brain, at the heart of which quantum mechanics is playing it's part. Why is the role of our conscious affecting  measurements and experimental results such a hard thing for physicists to venture?
In a simple answer yes it indeed create itself
There will always be people who manage to get jobs doing nothing useful rather than the hard work of doing the experiments necessary to get answers and solve problems.
Outer Wilds pilled
You briefly mentioned the concept the measurement=entanglement.  Doesn't that resolve the question as to why measurement collapses the wave function.  In all the work on Quantum Computers it has become very clear how hard it is to have a large number of entangled particles.  One silliness of the Schrodinger's Cat though experiment is that it requires a cat to become entangled with an atomic particle. Even a small cat would have more than 10^26 atoms.  Does anyone think there is any way to entangle an entire cat, much less a human.  What is the limit or at least the probability based on count.  Is there anyone that has studied that (probability of spontaneous vs the size of entanglement)?  Is there even any way to study that?
6:40 , why , anything to do with individual mental shutter speed ?
Hmm I guess the question is how much stuff can be in a superposition together.  I have a feeling we'll find a reason why it can't be the whole universe.
A creation needs a creator
I think that I have a solution to the questions of "measurement induced reality" akin to a "Gordian knot" solution by Alexander The Great, who simply cut it in half. Well, if one boxer knocks out another boxer to the canvas, I recon that both of them and millions of "observers" see the same result, with the knocked out boxer feeling a bit of pain, which tells him that the reality he perceives is quite "real". How would this be explained in terms of this observer influencing reality nonsense?  I side with Feynman's saying that scientists should stop being philosophers and get down to calculations :)
Of course the universe creates the itself.  One would have to believe there's an infinite regression of creator-created-creator-created.  It's gotta stop somewhere.
Observations are just a type of interaction
For the 20 questions, if you do forget, just make their 20th question the answer, since they will always make a guess at the last question.
That all sounds a lot like performance optimizations to me.
The hole "No phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observable phenomenon" reminds me of the Saying "Does a tree make a sound if no one is there to hear it" and if you think about it in relation to everything else aroud. you feel and  hear it at all times just at a very low decibel. Not to sound like a hippy but you are connected to Earth as the earth is connected to you.
Everything that happens, stays happened.
Wait… why would we expect a type of Hawking radiation for the cosmological event horizon? I mean, the point in space I occupy right now forms part of a cosmological event horizon for many other points in space… we could go so far as to say every point in space is part of a cosmological event horizon for another point in space. So if this is true everywhere, surely we would either be saturated in hawking radiation or it would all just cancel out.
5:14 - this suggests reality can be formed by full democracy. Even a small town that voted on everything would create reality. Pretty basic, but very important.  8:45 - who is ready to create and produce this game?
could you also say that if this theory is correct, the universe may technically not be "real" but there are so many observations every single moment that there can basically only be 1 possible reality, or only a couple almost identical ones?
Is there somehwere I can keep reading on this further?
Forgive my naivete, but has the double slit experiment ever been performed in a vacuum? Or zero g?
Not sure if the universe creates itself, but I do know that our world is destroying itself. Something needs to change, we need to change!  To the person reading this, “Your enough and always will be” ♥️
Well at least it’s internally consistent  —God
Wasnt PBS originally a Christian channel? Now they support evolution and lies? Interesting, charles Darwin is crackpot who used to get laughed at by actual academics
Take standard hydrogen nucleus.  Can the neutron be replaced with an anti-neutron so you have a anti-neutron combined with a proton?  Alternatively, take that hydrogen nucleus and replace the proton with an anti-proton.  Is that valid?  Either way, I assume if the quarks from one side touch an anti-quark from the other side, matching quarks would annihilate and presumably tear the nucleus apart.  But what if they don't match?  (IE: an anti-top quark touches a bottom quark?)
Does he have crab legs?  The way he moves side to side is funny.
The universe exists independent of our cognizance of it, but that reality is much different than what we perceive it to be. The quantum world is especially divorced from our perception of it, because we didn't evolve by natural selection to depend on those perceptions for our survival.
This reminds me of the wordle-like game absurdle, where the computer doesn't pick a word, and instead always gives the least helpful response that is consistent with at least one word and all previous responses
It sounds like the universe is lazily computing everything. Sometimes in computing you avoid performing an expensive operation until it's needed, at which point the required input is passed to the retrieval function and the actual result is provided back. Maybe the universe is doing the same thing. Furthermore, these lazy computations can be chained together. For example, I can know my value is the result of some expensive computation that results from inputting the results of many other lazy computations. No point in the network actually knows what it's value is, but if there is an "interaction" with one node in the network it could trigger a chain reaction that requires evaluating all the nodes. What's to say the network can't reference nodes in the past? There's no risk of any causal paradoxes because had that information been relevant for some prior causal purpose the node would have been evaluated already.
Ah so, Eckhart Tolle was correct, time may not exist at all.  Everything happens NOW
Where is Gonzalo Lira????
Only a few minutes in and I'm still all delayed quantum eraser. 🤣
Of course it does it's just a very big chemistry set
When you think about it, how _else_ could it do it?
So, our observations of the past change the future ???
I wonder if there’s another force in the universe that we haven’t been able to describe very well yet, that helps create the universe, perhaps consciousness is not an emergent property of the universe but a fundamental one. 🤷🏼‍♂️
I would love to hear your thoughts (Dr. Matt O'Dowd and the Space Time team) on how physics of the big and physics of the small (astrophysics and quantum world) connect?
❤️💓 Father 💕💖... made everything...
The universe is as it is, everything is ordained simple. Solves all the philisophical nonsense.
Wheeler is/was right. The reason quantum physics cant be nailed down is precisely what he said- it's because we are trying to say what something objectively IS when we aren't looking at it. By looking at it. It's a flawed endeavor from foundation.
Thought experiment for the evening:  If we take the negative-20-questions idea with the possibility that there is no free will (because the universe is deterministic), it could be that the universe gets to be any way it “wants.”  Essentially, the questions that define reality were guaranteed to be asked.
That survry link does not work :(
Penrose mentioned in an interview with Peterson how there are observations with 99%+ confidence from earlier universes in the CMB. A couple of 'spots' from the Planck observatory iirc, and they would be the leftovers of supermassive black holes in the former universe. I cannot wrap my mind around this, please cover this in a video! 😍
Does computer create itself? Does Bitcoin create itself? Does chair create itself? If the answer is yes, you are stupid. Same goes with universe.
well, the word "phenomenon" literally means something that can be seen/observed
This sounds like a bunch of crap, GOD created the universe around 7,000 years ago when he spoke it into existence. Then I saw the little PBS logo then it was evident to me this was a college educated idiot flapping his jaws just to hear himself talk.
The game Wordle has spawned many variations, and one of them is similar to Wheeler's pathological 20 Questions. It's called Evil Wordle. It has no deterministic correct solution. Your first guess will always come back as full gray. Each subsequent guess will receive clues constrained a list of words consistent with all previous responses. What word will you end up with? That depends on what your guesses are.

The Most High Power created the heavens and the all that you know exist but what about Genesis 15:13-14? It’s unfolding before your eyes and your judgement stands, Ukrainian is setting the narrative, pay attention your judgement is here.
On camping trips , I would play 20 questions with answering yes/no. It was pretty hilarious to see the differences in answers  between games and people!!
My brother in Christ, the answer to your question is the same as, "Why does the Universe exist at all".  God wills it.
Please pick an uglier cat next time!
A certain nursery rhyme just took on a whole new level of cool for me

You'd think that any idea with a whiff of anthropocentrism would be rejected outright, 500 years after Copernicus, but nope. Humans will be humans.
I swear, most of the joy of these videos is trying to predict when he's gonna wrap up by saying "Space-time."

Sometimes I think we're reaching the physical limits of what we can discover about physics itself and the universe.
I think about the nature of Spacetime being Coupled Quantum Fields - Their 'Interactions' specifically due to their couplings are what yield excitations which we may classify as various Quanta.  Observations are "Interactions" - and any kind of Interaction can change properties of a Quantum System - some Quantum Fields are capable of Interacting with Themselves (the Higgs Field for example) - This in a roundabout way of saying it means 'Nature Observes Itself' regardless of Humans existing or not.  This is what baffles me when people think we can somehow consciously control reality but really we are just along for the ride. (although Matt does mention this) - I'm glad this video title at least brushes over the point of physical reality managing itself :)
Sorry if I missed it but have you addressed “Emergence Theory” from Quantum Gravity Research?
Or time has no beginning and claiming otherwise is entirely social and psychological.
Maybe make a video on why there is something rather than nothing. Could there be multiple multiverses? If there are infinite universes are we talking about aleph-0 or what?
Well there's a cool tattoo idea if ever I've seen one
This is the single handed most simple trap of the cyber basilisk
Best video yet!
As a hobbyist worldbuilder, this is concerningly similar to discovery worldbuilding.
Perception is reality. We are the universe trying to figure itself out. My consciousness does not create... Nor does yours.  But all together...in collective thoughts, observations, and measurements? Who knows. Maybe. To be or not. Exists or not. Is or not. So many questions Does God exist? Did God create universe?. Is God the Universe? Did humans just invent God to explain the unexplainable? Or are they all true?. Keep calculating.
The universe is created by viewers like you. Thank you!
This makes me want a Space Time episode about Spinozism and monism in Physics, but I don't know how much influence these perspectives have had in scientific epistemological debates. Certainly in social scientists they're still considered quite fringe, but have some very interesting advocates and influences that I think have a lot to say about this moment of bringing ontology and epistemology into juxtaposition.
If I drive in different directions, I arrive at different locations.  Therefore my decision is what put my destinations where there are.  They didn't simply determine which conclusion that I would arrive at.
11:24 we all know we're thinking of Deepak Chopra
"quantum woo"
What does this potential necessary observer to decide quantum reality say about the idea of some kind of "God" or rather, some kind of universal 'field of observation'? Also, what are the chances the whole thing is bunk and it's just the method of observation that's corrupting the data? if those questions make any sense..
For me this reasoning has an element of solipsist thinking. As if the universe come to exist only as there was an intelligent/conscious human present. (That can make measurements.) And that the universe will cease to exist when last human dies.
17:40 Yes, but the center of the observable universe is the actual event horizon. That's why observer interactions are so weird. That's why the universe is, unlike other objects, denser at the cosmological horizon instead of the center. And that's why we see redshift, which is purely gravitational, with infinite time dilation at the cosmological horizon instead of expansion.   /s
Thinking our observations change the entire universe sounds just like thinking the solar system revolves around the earth. We're not that important... Plus, we kind of the know the universe existed before we did (it wasn't in a non-existent and existent state at the same time before we observed it) so what, the universe just decided to start moulding to human? Again, we're not that important in my opinion. I think paradoxes are fundamentally flawed like fallacies. Paradoxes can only exist because of the language we use to communicate is flawed.
My hypothesis is that the universe continously creates itself and destroys itself at the quantum level. The continous destruction is the negative divergence we call gravity. But i just smoked a blunt so that might be the source of my hypothesis.
If the observable universe is a black hole then could it feeding on matter outside its event horizon explain the expansion and a lack of feeding cause a big crush eventually? Additionally the fact that the universes mass is proportional to a black hole event horizon at the observable edge. Is that because we are coincidentally measuring it at the right time?
This is like trying to understand a female.  Are you hungry, do you have money, are your healthy, then you must be happy..... Your not happy.  Lmao ha ha ha :D. Your not living you best life lmao ha ha ha. How many loves you got.  We don't understand tha universe because it's female and guys are trying to understand something that were not.
Why do people even assume that "now" has any relevancy at all? That is an unfounded assumption. Now is not special, it's just a point in time, it can't "decide" the past or the future. We see those strange correlations because "now" is not special, everything already exists in correlation. Shouldn't that be the default conclusion from the experiments?

You are the universe and it is you. Our separateness is an illusion in this sea of molecules.
Could a non-conscious "thing" like a planet, be an observer? Say a chunk of rock that was hanging around since the big bang, finally slams into a planet some time in the future. The planet records information in the form of the crater left by the asteroid, and whatever minerals it contained that has now been deposited on the planet's surface. In that way, could non-conscious things like planets, asteroids, etc. count as observers, and thus allow for the creation of reality? ...Or am I just reeeally really high right now? (LOL kidding, I'm not- I swear.)
Just alot of jibrish no proof ..
I find it repulsive to think that the universe would not exist without an observer. It's more tolerable to me to view the universe as a machine that would work without anyone looking at it just the same as it would if someone would. The dependency to explain the universe by observer sounds to me like trying to explain a one legged man by trying to describe the grouch in great detail. I feel like it derails the conversation.
Literally anything about black holes would be amazing. You guys are the best!
Very provocative video about what is consciousness and why is it so fundamental.
As always, very interesting topic, presented in neat, clear form :) Unfortunately I need some help with understanding one thing about this delayed choice experiment. How does it work that wave function of the photon, produces destructive interference only for one way, while constructive interference for the other way? If wave travels both ways simultaneously and peaks meet troughs, then they both cancel each other out, so how can any detector light up?
Maybe what we call reality is just a really compelling meta language in psychophysical possibility space. That's right. I'm interpreting Donald Hoffman's ideas.
But if there is a part of universe (maybe outside of cosmological horizon) filled with particles, which never interacted with any particles in our part of universe, than somewhere there may be observers (be it sentient or not) for whom we are in superposition of all possible states?
To reach the mind of God, you need to go meta on EVERYTHING. It is not ONLY information, information is everything but everything is also being, so it includes the parts that are linked and the "informational links" themselves. You got to go deeper to know the truth. I have proved mathematically and logically that the physical universe doesn't exist, so all possible physical universes exist and will be experienced by YOU at some point in the infinite future (in a finite amount of time though. The more specific the universe is, the less likely it is to experience it.) There is something after death. You don't have to worry too much about it, because in all likelyhood from your point of view it will be similar to what you are consciously experiencing right now. You can only be conscious when your conscious self exist. A universe without a conscious self simply doesn't experience itself. Quantum mechanics are a side effect of the non existence of physical reality, but they can also be considered physical. Ultimately, they are both representing the same universe, but from two different perspectives. EVERYTHING IS ONE.
So warp fields are a thing but no one has talked about moving at the speed of light while generating a warp field at the same time. Wouldnt the field move faster than the speed of light and how much more?
In psychology everybody sees the world in a different way...  So does that mean that the world is different for everybody.  And if it is then why is nobody talking about their pet T-Rex or them being T-rex's pet
Are you saying we haven't even started the main game yet, that we're still just at the character generator?!?
Does PBS Spacetime do its own music or do they source it from somewhere, and where could one listen to it?
If Mark Evans doesn't hit a like on this video i'd be very mad and dissapointed.
This was truly a stellar episode, I'm absolutely certain it was one of the best. Thank you so much for giving me something to ponder. I'm not very well schooled, but I'm very curious, and your show always gives me such tantalizing thoughts to consider.
To think about the nature of the universe first you need to think about the nature of thinking. If consciousness is quantum (as proposed by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff in their Orch-OR hypothesis) then any questions we ask which fail to acknowledge that fact are doomed to be unanswerable. If consciousness is not quantum, then the nature of the universe should be easily defined by classical means, and the answers should come from forces and circumstances that are well understood. The fact that we cannot determine the nature of the universe is the best circumstantial evidence I know of for the idea that consciousness is a non-classical, non-computational phenomenon.
Funny how deep many philosophers and physicists arrive at solipsism and instead of accepting it, just ignore reality because they can't emotionally deal withit.
At some point the difference between science and philosophy becomes artificial.  What we get from "just calculating" is evidence of what is being measured/studied, etc, but a new idea still has to be found to explain what is causing the results.  Saying to concentrate only on the application of the math isn't saying that what is causing the evidence we see is unimportant, it is simply refusing to answer the question.  We are too wedded these days in my opinion that all evidence must fit "beautifully" into what is already considered decided.
I'm watching this channel just as a layman interested person, but what I still struggle with is the idea of quantum decoherence. If you could explain that further I bet that'd be much appreciated. Otherwise I really like your content as-is and since I don't know any better in the realm of physics I don't have much further suggestions. :D .... Thanks for doing this channel!
I really hate the idea that the universe is determined by observation because I am not a responsible observer.
It does it works in cycles, right now we are in the expansion phase.
Awesome. I recently listened to Rovelli's book and was hoping for a video on Relational Quantum Mechanics. I didn't know about Wheeler's idea, it seems like a good place to start. Looking forward to the one about RQM!
Would mathematics translate it from bit? In which case if it is universe, what would be bit?
I imagine that if the philosophers Socrates and Plato could see this video. They would reply. "See I told you so." 🤣 loljk
The superdeterministic approach also depends on the choice of the experiment. One more interpretation to get the head arround. lol

10:00 so be very careful what questions you ask.
One of the first things I thought about when thinking about the Universe is  how can something come from 'nothing' or has 'something' always existed - Maybe the Universe did create itself? If something exists now (or we think it does) has nothingness ever existed?
Hindu scientist
Observation at the tips of the entanglement tree might define locality: I (weakly) observe the presence of (say) the Moon by noting how connected physical events evolve with time. The slow precession of tides is an example.
One idea: How do the concepts of fluid dynamics translate into cosmic scales? Is a Reynold's number useful for stellar or astrophysical jets? Do the concepts from Bernoulli (the fluids one) and Reynolds or Navier-Stokes translate into magnetoplasmadynamics or is some 'tuning' involved to fit the observations?  Another though I don't know if it's too speculative, but what physically-possible means of long-distance communication are there? Do long-distance signals ever physically permanently fade away into the quantum noise/uncertainty? Is gravitational communication across the scale of an observable universe conceivable? Neutrino communication? Wormhole 2-way communication? I myself am involved in laser communication, and look forward to the arrival of the interplanetary internet in our own solar system, arguably starting this year with NASA Psyche, then leading to the arrival of NASA LunaNet, NASA Deep Space Optical Communication network, then ESA Moonlight and ScyLight, leading to a laser connected moon for Artemis and beyond.
The universe is not self created.  The universe is superdeterministic and temporal causation is not real.  See Dr. Hansson’s 2020 proof in Physics Essays.  The universe literally cannot cause itself to exist because causation in time is not real.
"And We created the universe with ˹great˺ might, and We are certainly expanding it." Quran 51:47
So to sum up the Negative 20 Questions game in the vein of another great Quantum Physics quote: "Not only does God play dice, He is also quite fond of Improv."
Create itself from what ? Did that "what" create itself ?
I think we're making it more complicated than it is and it's because we possess imagination. Things just want to be in equilibrium and what we call "information" is just a byproduct of the process of equilibrium. Kind of like gravity is a byproduct of mass/energy. But what do I know.
Ah yes, the series that i love so much but understand so little. Thank you for the uploads.
Does the universe create itself? No. I don't care how you twist it or what ingenious things you come up with to try and justify that brain fart. Nothing = NOTHING!  Void, zero, zilch, nada. etc.  This is from the same class of people using the societal wrecking balls currently. "Everything came from nothing, you'll have nothing, and you'll be happy" ... Fools!
10:38 A sketch of a giant ewe?! 🤔
This makes me uneasy 😂😅
Matt, I am by no means a physicist, not even close, so please bare with me for my probably naive question. I am wondering about the “obsession” of the physicists to fold every aspect of the universe to a single everlasting abstract representation (mathematical equation) eg., an equation representing the “reality”. Why can’t we accept that universe is made of micro-realities that keep evolving by “mutation” when “mating” with each other just like life? In other words how & why physicists wouldn’t accept that “change” is only the reality? Why chase the causality that might have already “mutated”? Why not focus on what can come next?
The answer is God. Yes, the bible says so and I believe in the Bible.
As I understand it, each particle is an observer. So when a particle hits another particle, they are real. From a philosophical point of view, where an observer needs to understand what he is observing, he needs to accept the difference between existence and reality.
Also just a side note about that last line of questions about the universe being a black hole, but the "big rip" scenario of an accelerating expansion really sounds like the way a black hole's rate of evaporation accelerates until the end. I don't know have any ideas for conclusions about that but it seems interesting. Although, some of this could just be "some things look like other things but they're not".
These details just sound uncannily compatible with being in a simulation. It's like the universe cuts all the same corners a well-optimized simulation would have to do to exist. Only putting in just enough work to compute things that would be consistent (and probable) with other observations, not simulating things in perfect detail (like positions of things), etc. Of course, that leads you to the point where there is no distinction between "I am the only consciousness that exists" and "humans are the only consciousnesses that exist", and any combination. Which is weird.  For an interesting way to think about it, that illustrates these ideas, I really liked the book Permutation City by Greg Egan, which isn't explicitly about the universe being a simulation, but a future Earth where people make simulations, and some of the similar ways they "cut corners" (only simulating what you look at and generating it on the fly, etc).
How is it that the beam splitters from Wheeler's thought experiment (and real experiments like the quantum eraser) do not themselves lead to the collapse of the wave function? The photons must interact (or not) with the atoms at the beam splitter. When they do, the photon is absorbed and a new one comes out. Intuitively, it seems that the atoms of the beam splitter have measured which path the photon has taken.
Wow, I instantaneously had to think about this quote:  "You are the universe observing itself."
DEFUND PBS
Here's the thing everyone seems to miss: it's not the cat in the state of superposition, it's your mind. Your mind is aware of both of the two possibilities, but until you observe (or can reliably calculate) the result, both 'possibilities' remain possible in your mind; even though only one of the possibilities is true at any given moment. Either the cat is still alive, and not dead, or the cat has been killed, and is not alive (let's just ignore the transition state where the event has been triggered but the cat hasn't finished dying yet). The only place in the universe where that 'superposition' of cat-alive/cat-dead exists, is the mind of the observer prior to observing the outcome. The cat is not in superposition, You are.   Also: we are not separate from the universe; we Are universe. This aligns with realism, rather than contradicting it. You "can imagine" the universe from an external detached perspective, but that is not what you are. You are in, and of, the universe. You are one of its countless products. You, yourself, are, a phenomenon. Bohr was wrong. Things exist (occur, actually), whether or not we observe them. But you could argue that the concept of 'phenomenon' is itself a phenomenon, which only exists in the mind of the observer. I would argue that the act of observation affects the observer exponentially more than whatever is being observed. But in that round-about way, you could then still say that "observation influences the phenomenon" (which is you).
Will the James Webb Telescope view the birth of the first galaxies? Nope, the universe goes on to infinity. Neither time nor mass can create itself into nothing, reside in nothing or expand into nothing simply because nothing has no properties. Time and space are independent of each other, not material bodies or fantasy unions that magically stretch time like a rubber band into space-time dimensions. If black holes reside is a region of Einstein's theorized space-time where gravity and mass are so dense that nothing, neither mass-particles nor electromagnetic radiation such as light can escape then how could it be possible for the entire mass of our universe to escape the unimaginable density of the proposed Big Bang? According to general relativity sufficient compact mass-density will deform space-time to form a black hole which obviously debunks both Big Bang theory and relativity! Spiral centrifugal-centripetal vortex velocities of black holes, galaxies and solar systems are basically plasma driven electromagnetic field generators creating dynamo convective motion. Black holes are nothing but massive electromagnetic fields that bend, curve and expand light.  Big Bang theorists rely on red shift to support the hypothesis that the universe is expanding, the very phenomena that supports the hypothesis of a (non-expanding static universe). Gravitational lensing occurs in all wavelengths of light including (red shift-microwave background radiation). Gravity from huge celestial objects of galaxies bend, curve and expand light giving the appearance of what Einstein wrongly theorized as time dilation-space-time. Light like all electromagnetic radiation and electricity is the result of moving electrons, as moving electrons of charged electromagnetic waves-light travel through the plasma of the universe each lump (or "quanta") of energy in the electromagnetic waves are charged then discharged to the next lump, eventually the energy dissipates creating the appearance of time dilation - the appearance of longer wavelengths in red shift much like sound waves. When light passes through a medium like a boat in the ocean or an airplane in our atmosphere, they slowdown from the resistance they encounter.  Neither time nor mass can create itself into nothing, reside in nothing or expand into nothing simply because nothing has no properties. Time and space are independent of each other, not material bodies or fantasy unions that magically stretch time like a rubber band into space-time dimensions. The James Webb Space Telescope is not a time machine, it’s delusional to believe you can travel back in time to view the beginning of the universe with telescopes that were made in the future :-). Big Bang theory is like trying to force the number 1 into 0. If gravity is the result of mass, then before the universe came into being gravity couldn't have existed simply because mass was not yet created!   Galaxies with massive gravity from the early Big Bang would have been gravitationally bound like the Andromeda galaxy is to the Milky Way galaxy, the sun, moon and planets in all solar systems in the universe yet these early galaxies were able to somehow escape these massive gravitational forces continuing to expand at an increasingly faster rate. Into what, nothing? Nothing has no properties! Neither the atom, universe nor time can be created or destroyed. Albert Einstein an autistic violinist patent clerk that had access to more papers than Suzanne Somers litter box yet creates theories with more bugs than Terminix. God Is energy-the universe and has always been here. "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End" Revelation 22:13.  What do you get when you mix Einstein's gravitational waves with time dilation? A universe of chaos where time and gravity fluctuate with waves, planets in solar systems are thrown off course in a collision course towards their sun. The speed of light is determined by how fast it travels through what Tesla called the ether-space. Time and space are not material bodies or fantasy unions that can magically create force upon another, yet Einstein joined them together with all the fundamental forces of the universe stretching time and space like a rubber band then using the speed of light to measure the age of the universe. Time and space are independent of each other, debunking Big Bang-evolution and the age of the universe.  According to general relativity ie gravitational lensing (a warped field of vision in telescopes) is due to (mass) between a distant light source and the observer. If that were true earths huge mass would distort the light of the observer as well making telescopes unusable. So only other planets in the universe are affected by gravitational waves? In 1916 before it was known that man could travel in space Albert Einstein based his gravitational wave theory on relativity. In 2021 most of us realize if gravitational waves existed in space astronauts would be crushed like an underwater diver traveling to the bottom of the sea.   Einstein's disciples defend relativity by saying gravity is a weak force, yeah so weak it effects planets and galaxies just not astronauts or droplets of water in space? The concept of gravitational lensing is wrongly conflated with mass-gravity. Gravitational lensing occurs in all wavelengths of light. As moving electrons-light approach a bend-curve centrifugal forces slow them down. This slowing down of electrons would account for the appearance of black holes, longer wavelengths in red shift and the supposed curvature of spacetime, what I refer to as centrifugal deceleration of electrons.   Plasma currents of galaxies also increase wavelength from the photoelectric effect. If space was curved-warped according to Albert Einstein's curved-warped gravity theory, like a boat in the ocean these same gravity waves would effect time and the perfect balance in solar system orbital mechanics throwing planets off course-out of orbit in a collision course towards the sun where a planets gravity and time would increase and decrease with different velocity rates as they ascend and descend the curves of gravity waves. Using optical clocks and lasers to prove Einstein's time dilation-space-time curvature is like using a metal detector to find gold at Fort Knox. The closer you are to the electromagnetic fields, mass and gravity of the earth the more light bends aka gravitational lensing. Scientific discovery, a compass will not work near a magnetic field duh  So according to Einstein's gravity wave theory the curved warped space of the universe with no gravity traveling through a non-curved warped space medium with no properties creates a falling effect of gravity against an already curved warped space universe with no gravity, where gravity is created from gravity and 1+1=3. Big Bang disciples, please explain how a universe can create itself in nothing, reside in nothing then expand into nothing? Nothing has no properties in which to hold or expand time, energy and matter. Ignorance is not knowing and doing, stupidity is knowing and doing anyway. The speed of light can be slowed from 186,000 miles per second down to 38 mph by shooting a laser through extremely cold sodium atoms acting as “optical molasses” If the universe were (suddenly destroyed) collapsed or fell into a black hole do you honestly think slowing down the speed of light with sodium atoms would save the earth from being destroyed, welcome to reality Trekkies.   Electrons move at a very slow constant terminal drift velocity rate of only 0.0028 inches per second. If you calculate time t = 0 seconds with the known 32.2 ft per second speed of gravity after one second of travel you can determine the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of the electron and the universe hasn't aged from a multidimensional perspective. Without a pressure density against all mass gravity cannot exist in an expanding universe, debunking both Einstein's time dilation and Big Bang theory. Time and gravity run inwardly, outwardly, in all directions in the same time frame, similar to the electromagnetic field having no beginning and no end.   The further light travels through what Tesla called the ether-space, the more it slows down. This mirror experiment in Einstein's time dilation illustrates two things. (1) When light passes through a medium like electrons, a boat in the ocean or an airplane in our atmosphere they slowdown from the resistance they encounter. (2) The power of suggestion to make people believe that light is a Time Machine. Time and space are independent of each other, debunking Big Bang-evolution and the age of the universe. Using a wired telephone landline across the universe there would be no time delay in communications, debunking evolution, time, space & big bang theory. Einstein's time dilation and gravity wave theory is just what you would expect from an autistic, using water to make water, turning his faucets on and watching as it runs down the drain.

When I was 21 I was high on LSD and I was doing balloons of Nitrous Oxide to the point I forgot what I even was. My conciseness retreated to being part of some ancient "machine" which at it's core was based on some question and answer system. For a second I observed it "stop" because I reached the end of all questions! It freaked me out because it made be realise this reality is actually a big dream that we are all having. After that there was no point in doing psychidelic drugs any more for me because I had already learned all there is to learn from them, so to speak. I knew I would have to live the rest of my life knowing I had seen something "secret" and that I would just sound crazy / messed up if I tried to tell anyone about it. 16 years later I can remember it like it was yesterday.
The Observer has served physics well. HA! Too much, just saying.
Other technicus like string theorie pls
im so curious about the black hole thing.
It looks like nothing is the only "thing" ever existed, like imagine a hypothetical creation of absolute everything from nothingness. This could be totally random and autonomous process but also inevitable outcome because of existance alone, existance without any purpose or meaning. Imagine nothing, no space, no time, just a conceptual sense of nothingness, then simply pick everything, every possible universe with every possible timeline or whatever, just borrow those "things" and put them back in such way, that there is no change, still nothing in the summary of the existance. But as an observer within such universe, you, every being, every observer, experience the reality and its paths as the known universe, multiverse, whatever, but you, that observer has never existed, there is still nothing. Still as observer you could percieve everything possible in the reality and that could be a concept of almighty and alknowing "god", simply existance alone has the ability to create and observe those concepts which are just information, concepts, thoughts, creations or whatever which exist because are observed within as they do not exit and never were or will, just might and that's alone enough for that.
Yes ! Who else?
I have never been able to accept that any meaningful concept of a universal "now" can exist alongside relativity.
Please read 'Blood Music' it uses a similar idea in its plot
We are beings of physics - quantum mechanics and relativity. Look at hard as you like at those equations and you will find no “essence of observer”.  It’s unscientific nonsense to talk about “observers” having any influence on physical reality. It adds some nebulous extra substance - the property of being an observer - to known physics, chemistry, and biology. (Until observeron particles are found at the LHC)
There's another assumption in these questions that isn't acknowledged: that we can observe reality. Just as our eyes are only sensitive in a narrow range of the EM spectrum, our technology limits what we can observe. Our math says that particles exist as wave functions smeared across the entire universe. We acknowledge we have no way to observe that, but persist in acting as if it isn't true. What I've never heard is an explanation of how these wave functions interact in complex systems to create objects like people and eyeballs which appear as classical particles.
"Quantum wu" is my new favorite phrase.

Not related to this video but a possible future topic... How do we actually know that antimatter is non-existent in the observable universe?  I have heard that if there was antimatter then we would detect matter-antimatter reactions as gamma ray bursts so there must not be large amounts of it around.  Couldn't this be due to localised differences during the big bang wherein different areas favored matter vs antimatter and vice versa. Also couldn't fast radio bursts/gamma ray bursts that are detected from unknown sources actually be matter-antimatter reactions?
Can I send a message to myself from future? YES
If photons don't experience time, how can they be an oscillation between the electric and the magnetic field? Don't they need time to oscillate?
Well I'm glad Matt made the disclaimer that it may all be nonsense.  The interpretation of that beam splitter experiment is not one I agree with. Consider that beam splitters physically alter the light passing through or reflecting off them, forcing a photon be be in one polarization or another.  If the second beam splitter that was added later was rotated 90 degrees I think the results would have been different.  If a photon of light was something that actually took all possible paths in its journey(s?) through the cosmos,  would we observe the universe we do?  (I don't think so!)
Universe is a simulation and this is an amazing optimisation.

They obviously did have too much time to think... I belive in Occam's razor...
How exactly do we know what happens when we DON'T observe something, to know that it behaved differently?
Maybe the Buddhists had it right all along? Reality is non dualistic, there is no separate observer. YOU are the Universe
Could be! The watcher see all of his area of the Multivers! As long as Kang is defeated...
All those interpretation wars fall prey to the same fallacy so common in positivistic science: if you know the tiniest bit you can extrapolate in an additive manner. Observing a single "particle" in the delayed choice experiment implies that the wave function is spread out all over the experimental setup. This one particle then, interacting with itself to construct 1 single measurement. That single measurement is real, but it does not constitute "reality". The interesting fact though is that such an extrapolation violates its own assumptions
how this is talked about... and how mushrooms / dmt kind of tells a very similar story to whats sort of going on here. its completely unreal to me.
It occurs to me - if the object at the big bang was of infinite density, why would it 'explode' ? Other 'black holes', that is, 'singularities', do not 'explode'. So, what's all that about then ? I have drunk 3 pints of 4.5% alcohol lager, and at several times during this (as usual) excellent video, I was close to understanding what Matt was saying. Didn't last though. I will now move to 'Magnum Jamaican tonic wine', 16.5% alcohol, to explore the universe further. Wish me luck.
The map is not the territory (Korzibsky). Matt: the map reflects the mind of the observer.
What a wonderful episode! More of these, please :)
Big question. Did we screw up the next big bang by converting matter to energy?
Wrong. Our universe is a WHITE HOLE
If we do live in a participatory universe, it begs the question - at what resolution, or at what level of reality - is that dynamic defined? And if the fundamental mechanism is primordial, then would a universe with magic and an afterlife have been a possibility at some point? Is it still a possibility or has it been locked behind the "tigers and dinosaurs" door?
Can we please stop with the pseudo-scientific clap-trap about an "observer dependent" reality? Not only is it completely incoherent from a logical perspective, but it is empirically disproved. Atoms and particles do not "collapse" simply because they are measured. Collapse itself is not an even a well-defined event, and it would violate all kinds of fundamental physics if it were (e.g., time reversal symmetry, conservation of information, etc.). At the same time, the Many-Worlds interpretation perfectly solves all of this. It obeys mathematical logic, it preserves realism, and eliminates the need for a clumsy "collapse" in the theory.
Nope. The universe knew U would observe before U did
i kind of see it as limitless possiblities of universei powered by creativity and the enchanted possiblity of examplarory free will.  overriding, consuming each other as the most free willed universe will morph into it's ruler or become the ruled of the most "realistic" "grounded" that rules out "naivity"   kind of an apex predator cat switching between a mouse and cat brain when it eats the mouse to when it doesn't.  or all in all a kind of battle royale evolution game of who has the strongest conciousness to make "it" happen and to i guess win the game of life by being it.  that's why the dragon sits on the pile of gold because we don't want to give up our dreams and conciousness and don't want to make compromises because we are greedy and not openminded - by nature that is.  that's why if god did exist, he wouldn't want to give up his power to anyone because no one would know how to rule like he would subjectively think is best. and no person would be himself if taken all of gods information otherwise they would just be the same, like teleportation could be seen as cloning with deletion. but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't really matter other than the position you change to and how the experience changes because of that.  and on a sidenote i feel like the u can be however many the "it" can handle or is correct for it.  like a w instead of a u where the eye looks both sides because it will evolve in a more suitable and stronger matter, like how you don't do it with your sister.  where the 2 eyes look in opposite directions, kind of like our double symmetrical sided brain, lungs and the like.  1 is not deemed for battle, as it has too many weaknesses and no training/evolution partner to keep each other upright and show perspective..

Random uncertainty delusion
WILL PEOPLE PLEASE STOP USING THE CAT EXAMPLE AS A DESCRIPTION OF HOW IT WORKS; IT WAS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW IT DOESN'T WORK. It's like when science videos show electrons orbiting the neucleus in nice arcs and shells. That's not how this works. Kids are carrying this misunderstanding baggage into the future. Stop. Please. The cat is supposed to illustrate how the wording leads to gross misunderstanding. When you say "can't the cat observe itself" I want to bang my head against a wall. The whole point was that these misinterpretations are what happens when you take human language, describing the situation imperfectly, to conclusions that are artifacts of the language, not the science.

Imagine how the universe could look like to observers on such size scales where no baryonic matter is detectable - kind of when it could be explained as a "hypothetical energy soup" from perspective of observers of such large scale, that observing anything smaller than googleplex parsecs will be impossible to them.
Amazing. You were going along nicy, but then had to justify yourself as being 'better' than "the worst of those that practice quantum woo". I guess it felt better just to throw that insult in there in order to set yourself apart from sounding too spiritualist. Wow, I'm so relieved. It's video fell from a 10 to a 7 in one shot for me for that one reason, extremely level of eurocentric scientific arrogance.

Most of quantum mechanics is complete fantasy, and they would do well to get a proper job and do something useful.
I think I need to see Matt and Lex Fridman have a discussion on Lex's podcast. I've lived a good life, it's ok if my brain melts.
So would this theoretically mean that every universe would have to have intelligent life in order to exist?
So the universe is like a giant blockchain or something?

You can apply the cat analogy to just about every unknown random event.  The weather at the north pole is either sunny or cloudy. Using the cat analogy, you can say that the weather at the north pole is both sunny and cloudy. When the satellite that is over the north pole takes a picture you can report if it is sunny or cloudy. Same thing as reporting if the cat is dead or alive when you open the box. I am not a physicist but Feynman also sounds the most reasonable and rational to me.  Whether something happens as a result of a random event like a bolt of lightning striking a tree or as a result of some biological life like a bear deciding to catch and eat a fish, the result of these two events will affect the outcome of future events. The future events will not determine the past events. If you measure or detect something, your action of measuring or detecting something would not have caused the events prior to you measuring or detecting them but, it will change the events that happen in the future. Future events cannot change the events that already happened in the past. I think this is a basic law of the universe similar to the first and second laws of thermodynamics. You can always make up a story about how something happened like a small partial being at two places at the same time or the same photon taking two different paths at the same time but that is not necessarily how the observed event happened. There are always other stories that can explain an event. The challenge is coming up with the convincing evidence that your story is the correct one or at least is probably the most correct one.  Quantum mechanics may be mysterious but it is not magic and there will probably be much better explanations that will solve the mysteries in the future.  The universe could be a cycle inside a bigger cycle similar to how a star’s birth, growth and death cycle is inside a galaxy’s birth, growth and death cycle or even similar to how a bacteria’s birth, growth,  and death cycle can exist inside an insect’s birth, growth, and death cycle. Birth, growth, and death cycles keep repeating. So  the birth, growth and death cycles of universes,  galaxies, stars and planets will also probably keep repeating.
In my view, the Copenhagen interpretation is realist to the extreme - perhaps even *more* so than the classical view. In the end, what it's saying is that an observation is a physical action, and the observer is part of the Universe and subject to the same laws as the system they try to observe. That was true already in classical physics; the new element introduced by quantum theory is that there is a limit to how *little* we can disturb an observed system and, what's more, the impossibility of measuring the effect of our action and retroactively taking it into account (in other words, we cannot even in theory reconstruct the state of the measured system *before* the measurement - we can only know what its state is *after* the measurement, which is what makes the measurement worthy of the name, btw).
Could you talk about ORCH-OR Theory of the physicist Roger Penrose?
Sounds like a dream to me 🙂 Revisit the idea of the aether (ether), not through more advanced means - probly also a good idea - but through just the logic of it based on all we think we know.
🧡🧡🤍💗💗💗
In my understanding, the whole problem comes from the following: in the macro world, cause and effect are discriminatible, because macro states are copiable. But in the quantum world, states are not copiable and, as a consequence, cause and effect are indiscriminatible. (The existence is not time-bound.) The question about reality is the exaclty same qustion about how entanglement collapses and how macro states are emerged. I don't think that past is because of the present as we did not created ourselves. The macro Universe seems to be a consequence of random past events and natural selection.
How dose the act of seeing something in you head where a electro magnetic wave is made from the electro spark is made making a measurement is mad when you see it dose not effect the universe you live in? That’s my question
Today you lost me at 0:02 but I really enjoyed it after watching it the third time.  ☺️
The idea of 'creation' is not existential, but essential; it has a consistency but no reality as such. To ask if the universe creates itself is absurd.
Excellent video. It gets straight to the heart of the subject with great clarity. I find the relationship between consciousness and what we experience as reality as absolutely fascinating.  I have heard it said that space and time are not properties of the objective  reality we are observing but perceptions of our brains/consciousness. If that is true it is mind blowing.
I really appreciate your coverage of participatory interpretations of QM!
So universe is asexual?😂
Perfect 4/20 content
re 6:08 the bean splitter, observed or not. Is it true that the scientifically unobserved are in fact observed then, within the experiment? So the whole experiment is observed so that what ever the bean count; that's what it is random or not. The two don't happen without each other, so they are one thing?
Nothing makes since. I'm god and I'm a stupid one. This is a shitty creation
As usual, the brainiacs make it much more difficult than it is. The cat is alive or dead, but not both. Doesn't matter if you open the box or not. Second, the universe is constantly interacting with itself. It's not standing still. And of course, measuring things can change things. It's a physical process. Glad I could help.
I have an idea as to how the Von Neumann Chain can be resolved, but I don't know how to get in contact with anyone relevant in the scientific world to play with the idea.
The big bang is the only white hole in the univers and there are many black holes. If you enter a black hole there is a good probability you will get out at the big bang.
No its always been here and always will be no start and no end. No big bang and no great creator.. Just always...
This video prompted me to look up quantum bayesianism, and I have to say, that it's very much consistent with the viewpoint I've come to hold about the quantum nature of the universe.
This was the most interesting episode ever, for me at least!
From the point of view of electromagnetic radiation traveling as a wave, has the Big Bang happened yet?
Who cares? We’ll never find or need the answer. Humans will still be here on Earth arguing about politics the day the sun explodes
It would be nice to get back to edifying questions and leave the speculation and fantasy alone.
shut up and calculate was the right answer, as information is only a human invented concept; not reality. cosmologists dabbling in philosophy and information theory have popularized many absurd falsehoods. seems it's not their areas of expertise.
Please do one in depth episode on the Salvatore Pais patents and the physics concepts they employee. Pais recently did a really good interview with Curt Jaimungal on TOE.
You didn't do a great jobs at preventing the quantum woos there...
Why couldent it be photons bouncing of the eye to couse a disturbance in the electron, or then lenses, that effect the dou ble slit experiment.
No way it's impossible,, even a needle or a ball has it's fabric!
Quantum stuff created itself from the woowoo. Bam !
This is amazing and my new favorite theory.
Is it possible to have two particle interaction that leaves no entanglement between the two? Like two alpha particles that can do something to each other when they collide (exchange a neutron or not), but in the end it's not possible to tell if they collided or not? Can observation be defined as interaction that creates entanglement?
That single "wave function" has far deeper and subtler level of vibrations (loosely called "ideas" or "emotions" for human expression) than the more superficial ones which condense into particles and the physical universe. The human being is not just a conglomeration of particles but have senses, mind, intellect and world consciousness  made up of these deeper vibes which are the real driving power of the organism which makes him human rather than some metabolic activity or particle movement. The external world, however lifeless or inanimate it may appear, also has such vibrations albeit with much less expression. It is the interaction of the sense-mind intellect vibes of a man with that of an external object that "measure out" or "condense" the world form for him, raising emotions/ideas of various grades and nature in the process which makes him interact with the external world. However these deeper vibrations cannot be measured in physical/ mathematical sense so physicists disregard them. When Einstein says that even if he does not look at the moon, it is still there is oK but he neglects the fact that every time he looks at the moon it raises different emotion in his mind which also makes it slightly different (however small it may be) from previous observation. This  creates the "unreality" of the moon rather than its "gross existence". In fact at the deepest level, time is nothing but the flight of ideas in sequence and space is the gap between these ideas which is projected as the external world.  On the human mind (which has limited power) the impression of the previous idea lingers even when the next idea appears giving rise to continuum of space, time and causality in it.
Oh, the Woo... It hurts.
"Now, my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose" JBS Haldane
This is like the question about whether or not a tree falling in the woods makes noise. Yes. How do you know? Well, because sound doesn't exist just because someone is there to hear it, and to make such a claim would require you demonstrating that there is a property to an observer that makes the thing miraculously appear as well as explain what happens to the sound should nobody be there to catch the sound waves from the fall as they go by.   For example, what if you have a person in a soundproof box that cannot hear anything outside and is only a dozen feet away from the tree. They can't hear it when it falls. All this means is the guy in the box separated from the tree won't know it fell until after the fact.   However if you add another person another dozen feet away from the tree, with the person in the soundproof box between the tree and the second person, then he will hear it fall and be aware of the action that happened.   But if you were to instead take the guy into the soundproof box and figure out a way to drop him in the same spot with such timing that the sound waves would pass his position just before he got there and reach the second person, you have the same effect.   The lack of an observer or ability to observe a physical phenomenon doesn't mean the phenomenon didn't happen, it just means the things necessary to observe it weren't there at the time.
I don't get why the second beam splitter could only be placed "in principle after the beams passed through the first"
I wish I had known about this in 2003 when I wrote my philosophy of physics thesis. There are some similarities between this and one of the possible models of time that I built. I would loved to have interviewed him to get a better understanding. I interviewed N. David Mermin about his paper Relativity Without Light. Wish I had been able to talk to Wheeler too.
In an instance of spacetime with no one to interpret information, can there really be spacetime at all?
SO AFTER FRUSTRATING DAY Something good i am watching  For GOOD NIGHT
What is it they are on about at quantum gravity research???
One question about universe created by observation - how did it develop in the period between the Big Bang and the first observers coming up? Surely the specific disposition of particles that led to the stars and planets to be created has been set long before any observers appeared.
Who or what observed the Observer into its state of observing? Possible infinite regress?
Just as Watson and Creek found out about DNA structure by building model, we too are doing the same
I wish you stop moving left right, it’s very distracting.
You lot need to slow down on the weed
So, everything is a question of point of view?
6:46 we use a beam splitter and assumed it either reflects or lets the photon-wave get thru. However we could build a splitter differently. If we replace this splitter with the mirror controlled by a random uniform function which either lowers the mirror or let it be in place also with 50/50 chance. Will the result of the experiment be different? If so, it means the splitter in the experiment while splitting something does not split everything (maybe it is a glass in a higher dimension which we ignore in the experiment)
God created the universe and everything in it read the Quran there’s a verse on it that was revealed over 1400 years ago and science just proved it about maybe 100 years ago..and no the Quran is not a man made book let alone it was memorized first and then from memorization of a chain of millions of people therefor it cannot be filled with a single contradiction or fault in any sort of error. Read the English Quran translation people. It goes hand and hand with science.
I have a question: should philosophy have an influence on science?
Ok so the whole schrodinger cat thing…can it be interpreted or boiled down to mean “we don’t know what the fck is going on in there until we look”?
When you pair this with the concept that we have no free will at all, then it makes perfect sense - because what we were going to observe was determined by previous events.
The idea that antiparticles are traveling backwards in time, "bouncing" back and forth off the big bang.  All electrons are really the same one
This is so fascinating I had to watch it twice and review certain parts even more. Wheeler's thought experiment irritates me because I want to live in a predetermined world that can be measured and understood. The actual experimentation makes this clear that I can't have this and I'm not the only one who feels this way.   I am greatful that the Universe has figured out how to define itself. I wonder if at some point when we discover gravitons and temporalons that we might also discover thoughtons or mentalons the basic building blocks of consciousness and willfulness.  To weird? I used to think so.
Looking forward to future videos on this topic! It's interesting how some physicists have started to become more phenomenological (if that's the right word). I feel like we're on the cusp of some great convergence.
Your eyes look cross-eyed
I've agreed with the idea that "observation" is "interaction" for a while - I know NdGT has struggled to explain that to the public for some time. But the experiment described in this video raises a question - how does the reflection off a mirror/beamsplitter not count as an interaction that would collapse the wave function, but the measuring device does? Surely reflecting photons involves particle/particle interactions, so I don't understand how superposition survives that interaction. What's the real line in the sand here that constitutes a meaningful interaction?
so if there were no observers to the universe, does that mean the universe has a possibilities occurring all the time? Then if someone observes the universe the whole thing collapses to a single result based on the last "question" observed?
As far as I understand it, the double beam splitter experiment seems to only imply that the photons in the experiment don't achieve decoherence until after the interactions with the splitters.  Assuming my understanding is accurate, it would be interesting to scale up the experiment with the expected constructive interference detector replaced with a replica of the setup. Repeatedly scaling up the setup could potentially give insight to how decoherence functions.
So the universe is like a giant stack of asynchronous function calls, that only collapses to a result once the caller decides to actually await their return value.
Is positive mass in the universe equal to the negative pressure of dark energy?
I have yet to see this theory, so I'm taking full credit but I think since quantum mechanics works on the microscale and the universe in the big bang was smaller than a particle then it would have been in a quantum state, and since quantum is yes or no, then the universe was in a superposition where it existed and didn't exist- no existence is 0×0=0 existence is 1×X= 1x so this process is followed down the line, in one universe sun's never existed, life never existed so no observer=no universe, here and there eventually leading to one where a conscious observer comes along and that observer collapses the probability wave and boom 💥 reality snaps into existence. Survival of the fittest, maybe that's why we're made with evolutionary steps, it's the one way existence could even happen.
I wish one of you guys, just once, could make it through a whole video without bringing up the Schrodinger equation yet again.
Idealism will prevail, matter is the greatest illusion of the mind. We understand nothing by believing what we see, we should feel why we see, what's our role in existence, and realise just how central the observer is. We're all gods at the centers of our individual infinite universes, our consciousness, that intersect in what we call reality :)
The game you described, it actually exists, at least in germany. It's called "Ein solches Ding", roughly translated to "Such a thing".
Can someone direct me to a text that goes through the math of the wheeler delayed-choice experiment? I would love to understand why quantum mechanics is predicting what it does (and what nature does). Weirdly, the quantum mechanics material I have at home seems not to discuss this at all.
We can see the effects of a phenomenon, that was not observed, from the past.  Let's take an example:  A large star collapsed and went supernova.  What does it mean that a phenomenon happened in the past, that was not observed, became a real outcome in the future?  My intuition is telling me what you are saying is correct, but I am trying to reconcile the observation of my experience.  Thank you Spacetime
I think all these crazy quantum interpretation come from a misunderstanding: the (suspected) misunderstanding that the wave function describes a part of the universe, and that this description can be expanded to the entire universe, while in (conjectured) reality, it describes a relationship between a part of the universe and the rest of it. Obviously, that cannot be extended to the universe in a meaningful way, as there is no "rest" then.
These are ramblings of megalomaniacs.  If an asteroid slammed into Earth and obliterated the human race.  The universe would continue on and things would still happen... Without someone there to observe them.
This is certainly very... weird. Well a lot of your videos are about the weirdness of space-time, but this time especially.  Basically... the only reason reality exists is because we observe it, since without observers there wouldn't be a way for reality itself to conform it's own existence. The universe is still there, but at the same time, it might as well not even exist if there is nothing to observe it is there.   Even typing it out it sounds confusing, but that's the best way I could think of summarizing this video. It makes sense, but just so hard to wrap your head around and the implications of it.  Say go to the question, "If a tree falls and no one is around, does it make a sound?" The answer would be... no? If we can't find evidence a sound coming from the tree falling, then it simply didn't. Obviously it in all likelihood did, but that's only from the patterns we recognize. But reality of the sound has no way of existing if there is nothing there to observe it.
I would love to see an episode on tachyons,  or bradyon particles with a tachyon spin.   I would guess these types of particles could have been created by the big bang and could be a candidate for dark matter/energy. Could a backwards in time particle explain the delayed choice experiment without a need for a wave function collapse?
I think we have a long way to go in understanding photons, wave or particle, these models just break when we look too close. These 'two path' experiments with 'future' events just indicate that even causality or order of events are not linear here.
Could the past, present and future exist simultaneously.
Again, without God you have your perpetual motion machine.
When did point of view, interaction and facts become an unrecognizable mess?
If the universe is a Product of all its internal obsververs' observations it would have to include the observers outside of our at light speed expanding sphere of physical influence and interaction there.  To expand on the 20 question and negative 20 question, Bob and Alice may have eventually arrived at a white Swan there, without having asked or specified its colour there since they only know about white swans as real swans (assuming the question of a real animal has been asked and answered with yes). Unbeknownst to both Bob and Alice, two other observers (lets call them Cecile and Daniel) have played the same game with the exact same questions and answers and also came to the conclusion of a swan, however, they think of a black swan instead, because they unlike Alice and Bob only know about black swans instead. The two pairs of Observers never end up interacting with the other pair or finding out about them or end up sharing their idea and observations on the colour of a swan there and are therefore unable to observe that swans can be not only white but also black or not only black but also white.  And right now i am struggling with defining that is on the tip of my tongue regarding to that expansion, but I'll try anyways:  What would be the difference between an absolutely objective reality and the sum of all subjective observations in the universe outside of the involvement of observers in general as well as the margin of error an individual observer may experience in their observations?
The cat isn’t both dead and alive. It’s one or the other.
Sounds like the harder you look the more confusing things are.  He does everything possible not to give God credit for the creation of such an unimaginable universe.
If a tree falls in a forest, and there are no theoretical physicists around to hear it, does it make a sound?
Thank you 💙💙💙
Could the reverse 20 questions be an indicator of this being a simulated universe? It seems like that could be a byproduct of trying to save on computational power requirements.
It’s inside you and you’re inside it. What a funny situation we find ourselves in 😂
Poking at the bear but you’re not waking him up because you haven’t realized that the bear is just a dream. You are the bear, you are what you manifest in this universe. But you have to correct that, there has to be a universe for your mind to exist in order for you to manifest yourself in the first place. There is no Interaction, just Transaction. There can’t be any buying unless there is first selling and vice versa.
Whitehead's process philosophy reinvisioned. Re-crapified.
Spontaneous existence is my theory, until they have a foundation of evidence I have zero interest in magical ideas
wasn't the delayed choice experiment debunked? I believe I saw a video here on YT explaining it, and this channel commented on it affirming the video.
The cosmological event horizen being the universe's swarchshield radius is chilling lol
Does that mean that the universe is a loop where each iteration refine it's definition ? Or that the wave of probability is completely refined "in one go" (like time isn't something that impact it) and that we only watch it unfold ?
How is an "observer" defined? What can qualify as an "observer?"
the same guy who emphasized the fundamental difference between knowing and understanding in the end choose knowing .... by his own volition "no one understands quantum mechanics" ... i wonder if he ever thought the subject would one day become too big to fail, that you can't ask certain questions anymore, that the standard model is incomplete in some fundamental way ... i hate shut up and calculate so much, winds me up every time
When you started talking about the past possibly being dependent on the present, I immediately thought about 1984.
William Lane Craig leaves the chat
please do a video on modern  Lorentz Ether Theory (LET), and why it is actually just a 'convenience' that we prefer  Einstein general relativity to it, when the math is identical, and knowing which is truly more correct takes measuring the one way speed of light, which hasnt been done.
Everything is a feedback loop, we exist because the universe exists, and the universe exits because we observe it.
I'm not saying the universe is a simulation, but if you wanted to make a simulation in the laziest way possible, the precipitatory universe would be a good way.  Also kinda how many dms do worldbuilding.
JESUS is coming soon Accept Him as Lord and Saviour now don't be left behind... it's the rapture not alien abduction...🙋🏽‍♀️
So, simplified, you're basically saying that quantum systems gain "meaningful" existence from interacting with another quantum system. If you just started with that, you could've saved yourself 18 minutes.  Also, this, combined with the path of least energy suggests that any randomness is only in our observations and despite probability having been a real thing just "before" the first quantum systems that were part of this universe interacted, every interaction after that is super deterministic and inevitable. This is necessary for all the _other_ interactions to have the _other_ "random" outcomes. Kinda like how the universe isn't progressive slots, but you inevitably find "random" outcomes to approach an average, which isn't possible in a random undetermined universe because it should randomly go further from the average and entropy should randomly reverse and stuff, which can't happen because it's kept in check by interactions with surrounding quantum systems that make the outcomes set, not only based on their states and positions, but their entire past as well. And since it's impossible for any complex set of systems to have perfect knowledge of all other systems, we're still stuck with a relatively uncertain future for which we have to make choices based on information - this does not give us free will. Free will and choice have nothing to do with each other any more than a universe requires creation.
7:30 pinball hero.
Damn, this was a serious mindbender. Definitely will have to rewatch it a few times.
Dropping a "wow dude" episode on 4/20. Well done, Spacetime!
What if we're living in a white hole? I could argue that the horizon of the observable universe is actually the rim of a white hole. If you consider that we can't see inside a blackhole's event horizon, how is that any different than the expansion of space at the edge of our observable universe?
Ah, yes. The "universe". Something we named out of a desire for a subjective answer to the question of "what is it to be", only to proceed to question the definition and limitations of the word endlessly.  The universe is an enigma because its a word we used to try to encapsulate the vastness of  *everything* beyond the metaphysical, though we tend to treat it inconsistently as being metaphysical, physical, objective, subjective etc. Its another case of humans being limited by thinking about things and the words used to describe those things as being interchangeable as apposed to the word being a mere representation of said thing.  The problem is that we are asking questions that are ultimately either paradoxical in nature or theyre based more around the words we use to ask them than about the subject of the question.   When asking "Where did the universe come from" people often ask based on the fallacy that "the universe" refers to a thing (all things, everything, an objective thing), and therefore must have had a prior state as a "thing" cannot simply be created out of nothing and everything physical in our lives is so incredibly new on the scale of the universe and has come from somewhere else. This apposed to seeing the universe not as being made up of, but literally as being all of subjective reality, not just the "things" that we find in said reality.   We lived centuries under the influence of gravity, but it took an apple falling to the ground without being influenced for isaac newton to have the epiphany that theres an extraordinary force pulling us down at all times that might be explained by science. What we know, how we think and the questions we ask depend (far more than we like to admit) on our own personal perspectives and subjective interpretations over our existence than they do on objective observation or pure scientific exploration.  What if the universe is just the term we came up with to try to describe something that is beyond our own language? What if there is no 'The Universe', just universe endlessly in every direction. What if the universe was never created because it exists of nothing. What if space is just distance between matter and time is just distance between events. What if that relative relationship is what is responsible for what we interpret as being the universe. What if the universe is a metaphysical thing that we are trying too hard to rationalise.   Let me ask this; if atoms didnt make up anything larger, would we ever stop to ask if there was anything smaller? Maybe were just asking these big reaching questions about the origin of the universe because were hoping for the key to unlocking the universal theory of everything. Maybe its because were looking for something bigger than ourselves, a way to put our lives into perspective with the full scope of objective reality. Maybe its because we like thinking about questions that we dont know how to answer. But i think a part of it is that people dont even really understand what it is theyre asking or even why, its just something we do as humans. Stare at the stars, ask the big questions, yada yada.   I just think we should all do more to ask ourselves why we ask these questions in the first place, what the words were saying actually mean when we put them to questions, and what it is were actually hoping to figure out by doing so.
In software development we call this "Lazy instantiation" or "Lazy initialization". I am sure whoever thought of the concept is disappointed to know that the Universe beat them to it by about 14 billion years.
Ummmmmmm……….
Does the universe create itself? How can the answer be anything but yes? It's either that, or something outside of the universe. If the universe is all there is, than it must be yes. The question should be, "How does the universe create itself?"
From the comment responses, if there was energy with universe sized  wavelengths, wouldn't that look the same as zero point energy?
This reminds me a lot of something I read recently in a book by Bertrand Russell.  He proposed that universals were real things that were neither mental or physical.  Instead, they were a third class of things that were the objectively true relations between things.  These relations were the true statements like the law of non-contradiction and other fundamentally true logical relations.  I've been thinking that some of those relations might not actually be fundamentally true but instead emerge from QM interactions.  How we get from probability on the QM scale to logic on the macroscopic scale is a question I don't know the answer to or even if the question is well formed but it's something I will keep in the back of my mind.
That feel like philosophie more than physic. Observer and consciousness how do you even defined this. Those argument sometime feel really humanistic like we are essential to the universe. At the same time we know those theory are incomplete (there still no theory of everything) this randomness and superposition do not exist at bigger scale so clearly something between the really small and really big must be collapsing those quantum system.
I like your funny words magic man
It would be impossible to prove this.
Plant heads grow towards the sun. I'm not sure this means they know this is a better choice, as I think no choice is being made. I find this whole subject difficult to understand.
So the universe didn't exist until it created life that could look at it. The alien civilization watching us won't exist until we see them.
The delayed choice experiment is a lie. See Sabine's video. The missing fact is that the  2 "wave"  patterns when combined are not waves. Just a single spread of a single "line".
If you think the universe created itself out of nothing by nothing and organized itself for life against completely impossible odds, then I have some swamp land in Florida to sell you real cheap.
What does the detector do to collapse the wave-function that the mirrors don't do?
What do you think of Professor Hossenfelder and her focus on superdeterminism?  Would requiring the process be time independent provide the same result, the reason the measurements line up this way is that if you played the experiment backwards in time the choice problem is erased as the choice is accounted for by reversibility.
you should do a sit down with Jordan Peterson on this subject... seems to me that physics and psychology are going to merge at some point
Re: 15:00  see 'Now: the physics of time" by Richard A Muller
The segue at 13:55 might be the best part of the video!
I should’ve gotten stoned before this. Too much to handle.
I’m not sure that “shut up and calculate” makes any sense.    Steven Hawking claimed that physics does not try to explain reality, it only creates a system of math equations that predict observations.  But Hawking’s book A Short History of Time is chock-full of explanations of reality with nary an equation in sight.  I don’t know if physics is even possible without explanations of reality because math principles by themselves are not enough to drive new insights.    For instance, when Kepler created equations to explain planet movement his data was just dots on a telescope that zigzagged across the sky over time.  If he was just doing math, he could have used any old function that gave the zigzag pattern.  But he was driven by the explanation that those dots were planets orbiting the sun.  That explanation for reality led him to his equations. Similarly, Einstein’s equations for general relativity were driven by his explanation that gravity is large objects curving space.  Once he came to this explanation, his equations could be derived from it.  I think Hawking and others have it backward.  You could argue that the job of physics is precisely to explain reality with metaphysical theories such as the big bang, quantum fields, and pilot wave theory.  The math that comes from those is used to confirm the metaphysical explanation.
The causality bubble of showing us more history the further we look is clearly working the reverse of how we thought.
How, if at all, does this apply to the macro world around us. Shroedinger's cat is not and never was in a superposition, it was either alive or dead, you just don't know which until you open the box.
<3
Our physical reality appears consistent on the macroscopic level.  What is it that forces the wave function to collapse identically for all observers?
The Universe doesn't exist because we observe it, the Universe exists because it has to, figure it this way; the Universe is binary, it started from 0 (no existence) to 1 (existence) because 0 is singular unit, making it 1. The observation didn't change the outcome of particle/wave duality, the equipment just couldn't get an accurate reading because of the quantum size of the particle
One thing PLEASE.  I have been watching Dr. Dowd for years.  Only recently has he had this distortion which can cause me to have SEIZURES.  For example, in the episode "Does The Universe Create Itself" time stamped at 2:18 to 2:21.  This distortion is enough to make me physically ill.  PLEASE STOP!!  I have posted this in the comments in the episode but it's never been replied too.  It's enough to force me to quit watching
So our reality is the result of lazy valuation?
When science reach the point where psychedelics makes the sense
Universe.HelpGod.To.GetIn=JohnCommand;
Isnt it missing from this the fact we also operante in a wave of probability were every time we make a measurement or interaction we produce a bifurcafion of all of our alternate selves with all possoble observarions in alternate realities?
Glad to see this channel is catching up. Been here for years.
Or as simple as it could be, Our brains capability of figuring reality out is not good enough, Since reality and the universe never had an issue with itself until we came to better probe at it with our limited capabilities  We are yet again at a geocentric way at looking at reality, so people make again the same fallacies of reflection as with geocentric models Why are they the same? Because it is still the same brains with the same limitations  Better scientists will get the instruments to better figure it out 🙂
I love how this episode portrays Dark Energy as that insufferable neighbour who we somehow need to live with.
Hello Matt! Here's a modification of the delayed-choice, as a thought experiment(without the quantum-erases). I call it the "Opposite Way experiment" We have the photon firing on the screen, while we are splitting after the split. The difference is, we make it so that second entangled pair, travels a really long distance, giving us the time to see the screen pattern, and effectively doing the OPPOSITE of what happens on the screen, by covering/uncovering the sensors. I.e, send the splitted particles to some mirrors on the moon(used in the past for distance/time measurements), and back where they will hit our sensors. This gives us around 2.51 seconds, to see the effect on the screen. (This can be modified if we can send to another, further, celestial body) 1) If we see solid lines, meaning we "Will" measure the particles in the next 2.51s, we will close the sensors and not read, which "Should" result in an interference pattern on the screen 2) If we see an interference pattern, meaning we "Will not" measure the particles in the next 2.51s, we will uncover the sensors, which "Should" result in 2 solid lines on the screen  What would happen in this case? The universe should either have a "default" state(like interference), or it could break down(not really, just a nice thought :P )
A permeating cosmic computer might explain this spooky action. Afaik the computer just starts its 'print' command when needed, the difference is each dot will be in random order (so the universe or field knows the picture but the dots only create it over a larger statistical quantity). So i am going with 'the universe is a randomised inkjet' (because saying its a simulation gets philosophically annoying)   P.s. ideas- gravity - thoughts on GR how does mass warp spacetime in the first place/why is it similar to acceleration an velocity in SR? OR actual explanation of alternatives to GR, such as how do gravitons come into it.
Thank you Mark and all the supporters
I wouldn't actually call this accurate, but this gave me the fun idea that when the name for "atoms" was coined, presumed then to be the smallest possible particle, perhaps that was actually TRUE. This would be sufficient for reality at that point in space-time as, let's say, the most relevant observers (us) couldn't probe any deeper, couldn't "ask" any more specifying questions.  Of course, if everything can be an observer, this "specification" would've actually happened around the big bang, but then that brings up realizations about "time" and "sequence" when reconciled with the double-slit and this delayed-choice experiment, and here comes the headaches.
always figured it was a circle jerk
nothing can come from nothing, something without consciousness cannot create consciousness
The interesting thing about the "U" shape is that it shows we look into the past to make it happen. But, is it possible for the beginning of time to look into the future to see where it is going? Are there alternate paths the universe could have taken and it observed early on to choose a path.   I liken this to dreams and choices we make today. I can make a choice and literally sit in my bed and imagine all the choices i could make in a day and predict what could happen.   I could stay in bed all day and choose to watch basketball games   I could choose to follow my morning routine and get ready for work   I could choose to take a random drive and go to a nearby city and book an airbnb  All of these are potential choices i could take in my day and what i choose dictates future reaction and i can predict to some level what will happen.   If i choose to stay in bed all day, ill just have a day off, get some sleep and rest up.   If i work, ill have the day fly by and go to meetings ive scheduled   If i go to a nearby city, i can expect phone calls from my family wondering where im at while im touring a museum or suttung by the beach and gambling.   This isnt perfect prediction, but there are choices with some level if predicatable outcomes...a probability wave function of choices that will collapse once i choose. The universe had the same choices available to them...theoretically and chose a path to eventually lead us to consciousness. I do believe the universe is a system trying to understand itself and we are part of that system to answer the question...what are we exactly and why.   And there's my existential crisis of the day
Physicist: guys, we had a major breakthrough in our understanding of the universe. We are the Universe observing itself!  Mystics and nondualist traditions: told you…
Very nice Video! Actually, it shows how Consciousness works. It's like a little child discovering the world: We as a species discover the Universe by expanding our Consciousness. I am very excited what will happen when we meet another species with a higher state of consciousness.  Would we be able to understand another perspective from a higher state of consciousness?   I mean how can we understand something when we are not capable of "seeing it" (based on the differences in the states of consciousness).  It's like showing a caveman how a rocket works. Nevertheless, the rocket exist and works - besides the incapability of the caveman "observing" the rocket.  I think we (Humans) are a child of the Universe which discover the properties of the Universe. By expanding our consciousness we create our perceivable reality which could be defined as the Universe.  However, I think it is necessary to mention that "the universe" is defined by our perception of the Universe. And here is where it gets tricky, because we can only solve this question when we find another "conscious being".
I personally think the "answer" is somehow linked to the idea of emergence. That simple things combine to make more complicated. Ant vs Ant Colony, Quarks vs Molecules. This idea extrapolated "up" to the cosmic level seems like an obvious step to take... how to take this step is of course, more difficult.
I am personally so tired of hearing explanations of Schrödinger's cat.
liberal propaganda, god created the universe
I'm having a hard time grasping/accepting this. Since you must interact with a particle to "measure" it, what is to say your measurement didn't cause the "result"? Thereby you get different results when measuring something. You are interacting with it. This mumbo jumbo with superpositions... I don't know. The cat is either alive or dead. Not both. And the sooner you interact with the box you will find the cat to be alive. That's just probability over time.
It seems that there is a certain question that all scientists want to desperately avoid asking, and yet one which their own findings continually point towards to. That is, what if God is the main observer of the universe?
If the Universe is defined as everything that exists, then it cannot create itself. The Universe is in constant Flux. It changes its formation constantly, although it's spatial dimensions never changes.
information coalesces, just ask Google.
Lets say the alien civilisation wants to warn us about some danger coming in given amount of time, what units should they chose so it will be universally understandable? I mean, all our units are very local-centric. Would it be some ratio between constants? Speed of light in vacuum slash lets say speed of sound in precisely defined matter?
So like, if a bumblebee thinks a school bus is another bumblebee it just asked the wrong questions? Just a big-ass cold metal and dead silent bumblebee.
Can't the delayed choice experiment be explained by adding in special relativity? In the reference frame of the photon time and distance become 0. All interactions are simultaneous. The photon instantly knows it's entire path and also if the 2nd beamsplitter is there or not at the spacetime interval when it's going through it. Only in our reference frame there seems to be a difference in time / space and an apparent opportunity to change the outcome.
I can't stop thinking about death and how we just suddenly blink into existence then eventually out for the rest of time and into infinity. Cant wrap my mind around never existing again because I want to stay in this universe, not leave it forever and into the void.
It's a shame how science is being tainted with diversity and representation.. which is the opposite of science
No. That's an incoherent statement.
We are the universe experiencing itself.
Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality can give philosophical meaning to Wheeler's ideas. Pirsig left Quality undefined, but we may define it as the results of measurements taken by observers. To reinterpret Pirsig's example of exam papers through your lens: Pirsig asks why some exam papers are higher Quality than others, as measured by his students, and our answer is that the exam papers only have definite Quality when observed in a statistical ensemble; an exam paper is a quantum object.
Is it possible that the reason we can't figure out what dark energy and dark matter are is that we're in a simulation created by beings that just wanted to see what happened by intentionally hiding them from us?
This channel is so much better than most of those other PBS channels. They all too often seem to be pushing some idiotic, racist or other delusional agenda.
twenty questions and negative twenty is fourty in total, only 2 off of 42 for the perfect answer
I don’t follow science or the PBS space-time series that much, I’m a far bigger fan of philosophical questions and teasing that existential emotional background of our existence. I don’t think science can truly “solve” fundamental questions like “ are conscience observers required for the universe to manifest” or “ is the universe real outside our observations of it” without getting a little mystical. One thing I’ve been allowed to notice is the idea that the universe is a full circle system. Science, philosophy, mystery, intuition, mysticism, perhaps even shamanism will all be utilized to dig deeper. I do have faith that sciences approach is the way as humans to proceed, without question. But how that method is applied, or from what color or flavor those steps are clothed by, whether it be hard logic, rigorous trial and error testing, intuitional plumbing, shamanistic digging, philosophical inquiry, I think the “answer” is to abandon the need for a final answer. What better game/ scenario in reality for inherently curious creatures like ourselves to participate in, than to find ourselves in an ever deepening mystery? Not knowing is the heart and root of both mystics and scientists, and perhaps in some reciprocal feedback loop, the observer and the observed create each other  through imagination and a kind of chaotic order. The more complex our questions become, the more complex the universe can make itself to wriggle out of closure and solution to the current model being offered. Yet without a conscious and intelligent creatures such as ourselves, the universe is cutting itself off in some sense. I don’t think we “see” complexity or mystery in the universe, but that those concepts are plastered over it by the vehicle of language which then tries to solve its own created problems, a situation ideal for the universe to endlessly produce novel information and/scenarios that again require more language to understand or work on.  Ramblings of a nobody, thank you for the videos and though provoking content Matt and PBS. Love everything about this channel 🥰
If I had a time machine and went back, all stealthy, with like god powers... If I change myself or an aspect of my past, I not only throw myself down a different timeline, but I also remove all the logic and occurrences that lead me to make the decision to go back in time and make changes.  Because of this, the new me, at the latest now, (equivalent to the time I left in my time machine...) I would have no idea my past had been altered, it would be the normal past I'd always had, My memories would all fit as if nothing was wrong no matter how drastic the difference you make with your god powers.   Maybe you have never done it, maybe the existence you have is after 3 times, 3 million times or 3 billion trillion times. Safe to assume we can't, but I've not personally found evidence that I haven't and don't repeatedly do it :p
I think the universe is in the shape of a torus resulting from a Rayleigh-Taylor Instability. The 'great attractor' we're noticing everything moving towards is just the narrower and higher velocity central section.  /shrug. Sounds good to me. :D
the cat will be dead if you wait long enough.
But isn’t the expansion of space time the creation of the universe?
Those stock images of people are beyond annoying and distract from content.
Great video, I like the Universe series
If we only take into consideration the Space Time audience commenters, then I can conclude from this the universe will exist forever due to the fact we will never run out of questions about everything. From the moment we learn the question "Why?" we start asking our parents, our relatives, our peers and eventually asking the void, but why?
Very interesting. Since we did not exist to make our own measurements to create our own universe properties. Would it be a good assumption that some unknown measurement was done to create our universe? Example a scientist doing an experiment in some other dimension or universe. Then a bunch more questions cone up, Would we be able to create a measurement to create a universe? Could we control the physics of that universe? My brain hurts 🤣
CTMU!
The physics of consciousness
Please include Persian subtitles
At 17:50 you mention that the event horizon of a black hole with all the mass of the universe is the same size as the cosmological event horizon. Then, what happend right after the Big Bang? If the cosmological event horizon was smaller back then, why didn't the universe collapse into a black hole?
✨✍️😉It's the story.  The story's why we're alive, we, expansion had used deduction as much as are the comparisons we draw are, comparisons ourselves but as tools, predetermined till however born.  All I write is free.
Hey Matt! I agree with all your points- except that I don't get the notion of curvature. Right now, i imagine the universe as being a thick slice of cottage cheeze (with a topmost surface). I can curve the topmost surface of the thick block of cottage cheeze by cutting it in some smooth ways etc. So curvature to me does make sense only if there seems to be an upper limit (yes-up means the usual up-like the roof) to the number of such 3d layers of the universe  just like for a finite block of cheeze, i can divide it into finite number of slices by taking a specific thickness for each. But, if the universe is infinite in all directions, then there seems to be no topmost surface of the universe to curve-because I can keep adding layers of cheeze above it of any thickness or shape and flatten it out eventually. So, how can we curve an infinite universe? According to my knowledge, I think that this is true but in a coincidence way- that the flat universes are always infinite- but it is a vice-versa of that.   Or, should I imagine local internal curves and grooves in the cottage cheeze that point to the pictures where a 3d block of spacetime bends inward with a mass inside, instead of those where a planet or star shows bending of a rubber like sheet in a circular way. (Maybe it is just confusion caused by visuals of the theory?)  Thanks.
It really feels like you have to do a lot of strenuous, confusing and ontologically expensive mental gymnastics to get rid of the other Everetian worlds. Seems so much more elegant to take the Everetian view. The delayed choice experiments go from seeming like time traveling magic, to just what you would expect to observe. (Not a physicist but its what makes sense to me)
i never liked human centric theories, its more comforting to know that the universe works on set rules that exist regardless of our observations and interpretations, even in the quantum realm
If reality is defined by the question relationship between its observers and the observed universe itself, doesn't that create a problem around science? As in, wouldn't then science itself be a method by which the universe creates itself?
"Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no death, life is only a dream , and we are the imagination of ourselves . Here's Tom with the weather " -Bill Hicks
Quantum mechanics is so paradoxical and counter-intuitive, but it works. It really is amazing how answering one question about it raises another one to a few nonillion more.
Damn, I don't understand.
I wanna collapse of few ideas from a number of different YouTube I have scoped into each other.  If time is gravity, and gravity causes quantum behaviour to become classical, then yes, the macro (or possibly super-macro) Universe is expanding into the future.   For sure, the Big Bang happened at a time in the past.  The question is, did it also happen at a place that still exists, or was there only one place, that can longer exist ?
This episode was a bunch of esoterical woo woo. The universe doesn't need spectators who do "observations" on the inside to exist. Living beings are just a complicated assembly of matter themselves. They don't need spirits or souls to function. The whole episode just shows that physicists are like most other humans beholden to very old philosophical metaphysical concepts that are just a ton of bs. And a macroscopic object with a quantum detector is still a macroscopic object. Putting it into a box does nothing to it.
I believe the answer might be found in: 1. The Hundredth Monkey Effect 2. Wisdom of the crowd 3. The Pareto Principle  Your welcome =)
So, a multiverse emerges due to the different questions?
The thing that was and is that everyone and everything. Yea watch a movie.
Can you please do a video on superdeterminism? Explain what it is (with a clear example), why it's controversial, and how it relates to measurement of the quantum properties of entangled particles.  This is Sabine Hossenfelder's preferred theory, but I don't get it.
I love this channel ❤️
Even the macro world isn't real, physics or science won't ever solve this problem, no one studies the only thing worth studying, ourself. Blind clowns with tools, endlessly perpetuating their commonly accepted delusion, the scientific community.
My take:  In a way yes, it "creates itself", but rather, it is just because it can be. If it can be described mathematically, it will exist to itself. But nothing really exists, not in the way people expect it to.
May I know who are these human avatars in the videos? (Ex: @2:42) Are they part of the production team?
This reminds me of Isaac Asimov's "Last Question" - universe keeps asking questions to itself and the answers could be anything as long as those answers are consistent with a timeline where time-traveling AC/God is built at the end and the universe re-created by it.
If the universe is defined by information density and interactions that transmit information, the universe is made for cats. (and that other stuff that the Internet is full of.}
Quantum time has more than two dimensions. This is why you see "strangeness". The egotistical view is a religious choice, rather than a model.
Didn't give the cat an Afro too? Coulda been 3 for 3 man!
Physicists tripping balls
I think that the universe would do everything it can to hide the fact that it is a simulation.
Matt: So what experiment will you do to “prove” any of this?
All scientist are now black. All of them. Why not Asian or disabled people or white males😲? Why do I even mention this? Because as a scientist I am curious when statistics are out of whack.
The idea that we need to interact with 'the Universe' for it to exist also means that without that interaction we don't exist either. The chicken or the egg here:?
I love watching these then getting completely lost after 5 mins
If we are living in a universe based on the  answers to an unthinkably large/old game of "negative 20 questions", are we observing the answers to questions that we (humanity) are asking or are we observing the answers to questions of a distant/past civilization located somewhere in space time?   When scientific discoveries are made by human scientists, is that space time narrowing the possible answers to our "questions" or has another alien civilization already asked them and "set" the answer?   Fantastic episode guys! Keep em coming :)
Based on the book I'm writing "Science  Magic/k and Human (=)Potential"(X,Y,Z = P)🤘😝🤘   Based on the headache I'm having YES!. I'm 8 seconds into this  I'm tired. I'll Brainstorm on this idea tomorrow good night.
We can't know if it's not a simulation...
The Negative 20 Questions reminds me of Absurdle: https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html  It's a Wordle version that narrows the possible answers with each guess to make the game as long as possible.
I knew John Wheeler. I asked once what he thought was the major issue. He then asked me what I thought. I said the subject object relationship.  He said, "I couldn't agree more. We have to understand Kant". Oh! So I studied Kant for weeks on the "anticipation of perception" from the Critique of Pure Reason. I wanted to know if Kant believed there is an object "out there". I decided Kant did believe there is a real object that influences the subject. But the question is how does this happen. Wheeler, like you all, believed in light rays that bring us the information from the object. I disagreed about this and decided the influence of the real is through our nervous system which is part of the nervous system of the entire universe out there as the object.
Life is a mirror the Universe made to look at itself.
What I find weird is the way delayed experiment makes interference, but the screen of double slit experiment doesn't interfere even if it measures one particle at a time with a delay 🤔 If the collapse happen after measurement, why the particle didn't behave like a particle when passing throughout?
This subject is by far the most difficult to understand. Does time exist without observation.  This leads to creation doesn't it. Could God be a single cell creature. The first to observe and how did it exist. Could energy observe energy maybe  consciousness isn't required 🤔????????
This is fascinating, but always remember that information is not wisdom or intelligence. It's only the start.
Have a contest where people submit their ideas about the universe and the most liked and thorough by your judgement get reviewed by you on video.
Reality seems to be dependent on how you see things in this time space.
What was I listening to for 12 mins???
Whats the possibility that there is no dark matter/energy but space is changing shape from concave to convey
i wonder what wheeler would have learned if he took some shrooms
The 'observer' is made of atoms so there is no 'observer' any more than the air is an 'observer'.
I'm a member of Mensa with a tested IQ of 151 - and I feel really stupid watching this , most of which was Greek to me.
All these videos are just a pile of horseshit...you will never prove the origin of the Universe because it is impossible. Philosophy has no place in objective science. Science has proven that all its major theories break down at some point, they are all wrong.  God made the universe, end of story.  You cannot disprove it.
Alternative of The Big Bang Theory - The Big Bang Cannot Arise from Nothing - Mirror Universe Theory https://youtu.be/FRM8pchrqP8
Of course this doesn't preclude the idea that we aren't the actual observer, but that the observer who's measurement of this reality, exists outside of, or entirely encompasses, this reality. We are merely witness to those "decoherence events".
So if Feynman's universe is Wordle, Wheeler's universe is Absurdle
I'm gonna try to asking the universe into giving me money. I'll report back, if money has materialized somewhere after me asking whether there is a pile of money around the next corner.
First real survey question, and already the correct answer isn't a choice. (It's "Almost all episodes I become aware of, with the priority modified by the topic".)
Why does schroedinger's cat and the like always make me think that the universe works by "lazy evaluation". maybe that's just to conserve some CPU ticks in the Matrix ;)
Another argument that strengthens the possibility simulation theory being true
Best episode you guys ever made. Thank you for this.
I could pound a fistful of mushrooms and live here, in this participatory universe for awhile.  Js.
I think Wheeler was on the right track, but missed an important point. Everything we sensate (via our eyes, skin, smell, taste, etc.,) results in a flow of electrons - via the nervous system - to the brain (from the eye, via stimulation of the retina; from the ears, via stimulation of the tympanic membrane, etc). Each electron is identical to the next - it's only specialised parts of the brain that decode the stimulus, and by doing so, assign an interpretation to it (this is an auditory stimulus; this is a visual stimulus, etc.) Forget theories of personality such as Freudian or Jungian - man is merely an information processor - all man is processing are electrons which gives rise to perception.  I've put a video on YouTube about MAAIP (Man As An Information Processor), but alas, it has attracted no comment!
Couldn't it be possible that the universe have different answers for different questions? This is natural and intuitive in macroscopic objects. If you measure the weight of a rock you get a different answer than if you measure the heat, or the surface, or whatever other property. And that doesn't question our reality. We just accept that objects may have different properties or different results depending on how and what you are measuring. Why is it so weird that when we ask different "questions" to a particle we get different answers?
You claim that quantum physics, specifically the theory that the observation changes the process itself, helped create the modern world. What invention has this assumption been foundational to?  I can’t seem to find any cultural footprint made by this theory, making it wrong or useless.
i like farting in my hand and smelling it through my nostrils.
I always struggle continuing to watch things on consciousness in quantum physics. What's the point of the Schrödinger's Cat superposition if it has no measurable effect. The double slit experiment shows the wave superposition that truly collapses at measurement through the correlations in the wave patterns. This is the only "meaningful" superposition i have been shown or explained in physics videos, please link me to more so that i might entertain the ideas of consciousness in reality.
So... Black holes inside black holes? What about white holes inside a black hole?
What about an episode about the farthest objects that we can see. How fast are they moving away from us? My napkin math says about a thousand times the speed of light.
My head hurts.
At 3:11 the question can only be answered after you define an observer..or what is an observation
You need to get a real job!
I think it's pretty clear that the terms "measurement" and "observer" were very poor choices. Let's just stick with "interaction".
Objective reality must exist, but is likely more complicated than we can resolve : )
"Does the Universe Create Itself?"...???  Short answer?   NO, und nothing shown in this video provides tangible evidence it has or it can.  Simply because "our" math indicates something possible, or even probable?  Doesn't conclude it truly exist, nor that it can or will ever happen.   ~Das paradox our mind conceives to be "nothing"...ist relatively still "something".  You can't pour milk into an "empty" glass, if "empty" doesn't exist. Therefore, das reality we perceive, und das universe we define, must be infinite. There ist always "something" on das other side of das fences we conceive, even if that "something" ist perceived to be "nothing". Any discovery becomes our new reality, und an observed extension of das one infinite universe.~ Ivanka Leonie Fuchs (2005)  How does this apply to "Does the Universe Create Itself?"...??? "Itself" must already exist before it can Create anything, including "Itself". If "Itself" already existed then it did not Create "Itself". Therefore, once again das universe we define must be infinite as das reality we perceive. :-)  Have a fun day.  :-)   Auf Wiedersehen aus Wiesbaden
So if I change the cat with an explosive it only explodes if it is observed
Its not that the observer creates the universe, but that the universe creates the observer.
Is this similar to Wolframs theory? Seems to be in some ways at least
"Worst practitioners of quantum woo" So that includes Tesla with his famous saying "The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence."  That statements is so incredibly arrogant and full of hubris. Very sad
I always thought that "what if, something is a default state?" Nothing is unstable, really unstable, and sooner or later, which in pre-spacetime configuration can mean forever long or instantaneously, some fluctuation will create enough mess for the "logic" of the reality to kick in and ask "how is it possible that there's so much energy here, where there's should be nothing? ... Easiest solution, and probably the only solution for any reality that wants to be coherent (realities love to do so)? Let it dissolve. ... but for that, you actually need space and time. Luckily, traveling matter/energy leaves space and time behind. Literally. Both are MHO just side products of energy/matter changing relative position to each other. ... The universe is IMHO just the easiest way for entropy how to handle/solve nothing while still staying consistent in its logic.
Definitely atheist god einstein hadn't created universe.
So the tree doesn't make a sound after all
does anyone knows if dr. Bohr had some knowledge of oriental or mistycal philosophies before arriving to his conclusions?
Doesn't the idea that reality requires to be observed to exist suggest that the universe is running on a machine that lacks the resources to model the entire universe at every position in time?
If quantum particles are not effected by gravity, wouldn't that also extend to time? So if we take time out of the equation, quantum mechanics makes more sense. It's not that the particles are in a super positional state, it's that they exist outside of time, so their end state and starting state happen effectively at the same time. When we "observe" it, we are trying to define the particle using a dimension that it doesn't belong in. It's like trying to describe the color blue to a blind person by telling them how much you enjoy pizza, the two are completely unrelated. Am I on the right track here? Or am I missing something?
make a pbs space-time discord please
If we live in an informational universe, and information might be captured 'on the surface' of a black hole, might it be possible that black holes allow for the disassociation of matter from information? I can imagine the matter, the energy, inside a black hole being reborn and forming a new informational universe, now free from the previous 'reverse 20 questions' before it fell into it.
It’s clear that heterolinear observations serve to both de-cluster virtual re-representation of a quantum object (in Fonzereli space), and enforce the constant of Planck distance as verified within the radius of vectorial diapason. Obviously, it follows that inverse negative anti-coligulation is necessary, otherwise tenegrity would decay into formations identical to the vectorial diapason radius which itself could only ever be partially derived from (temporally nested) heterolinear observations to begin with.
We think that the universe created life, maybe Life created the universe. Thoughts?
This theory sounds like Buddhist and Hindi theories that observer and observed do not really exist and are illusion. There is only nothingness that is in fact awarness.
Black holes when they have pulled in all the stars around them have no gravitational drag from the stars to slow down the spin. When its spin increases till the surface at the equator reaches escape velocity. It starts slinging out a smooth pattern of matter that creates a disc galaxy.  As mass is lost the diameter is decreased and the equator no longer is at the escape velocity. The gravitational drag also slows it.  Armed galaxy's have a few stars that fall in just below the black hole reaches escape velocity. As the remaining stars fall in ripples push outward and raise the surface above the escape velocity sending out spiral arms.
I guess that’s why they call us ‘beings’……
What if you made multiple copies of an AI with massive computing power? Each identical and given the same task but each has it's own baseline for reality. One has an air, fire, earth and water view. The next religion or creationist. Another physics, then quantum and the last has all of the information from each belief of reality and the conclusions of it's other self's. The question, what is the nature of reality?  You would expect the first four to have vastly different points of view. What of the fifth? Would it spin the other four conclusions into a homogeneous combined answer, an entirely new answer or would it pick and choose, adding new conclusions to the previous ones yet still stay in the bounds of the original conclusions. Or would it simply conclude the nature of reality is only determinable based on the limit of information used to measure it by? Therefor it varies. O' wait that experiment is running now with AI's known as humans. So who and why...
I just don’t understand then how the universe functioned before there was anyone or anything to observe it
11:08 in respect to observing the big bang. We can only perceive information through the methods we use to make the observations ie. Radio, electromagnetic, infrared etc. So as we discover more methods of observation not yet known to us our understanding of the universe evolves. Based on the perception of history. This is the classic route to human history as well, kings are only benevolent until you speak with the dead.
Wait it's real?  ...   FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU ...
This explains the ability for two people given the same event to see it completely differently, as in politics where self-affirming echo chambers ask different questions without a moderator to determine the validity of the questions.  For example, was an election swayed by fraud.  (Yes, I flunked physics.)
Sure, Sure and Sure The UNIVERSE as a FREE-LUNCH hypothesis.  Bleeding nonsense
IMO the fact that things change based on observation can only mean two things. A) We somehow manipulate the observed entity by accident, via a mechanic still unknown to us or B) Universe or simulation course corrects to our actions. But why would a universe correct itself when you put it under a microscope speaking metaphorically? If I where the creator of a Simulation of humans, well how do you handle the humans when they want to look deeper into their building blocks of their world? Well you trick them. Think of it as Minecraft. What would happen if you infinitely kept zooming in on a block? Well as a programmer of that simulation, I would just keep showing them a smaller block. Think about it. When we observe our quantum world, we just get a copy-paste answer. In the Minecraft example, why would you generate smaller blocks, if nobody is looking?
Can we stop saying observe and say measure. So as not to give fuel to the quantum woo peddlers and religious nutters.
Quantum physics is just Zen master thinking turned up to i
BUT, by observing the universe, we don't create it, we create understanding of cosmic forces that have already been enacted. Not unlike Shrodengers cat, we don't know the past until we observe it with some form of measuring device but it is realistic to assume that some fundamental rules were in play to cement the events ahead of time, our ignorance of it is inconsequential.
How about revisiting some of the previous topics that need update or follow up on some of the previous ones. There was this episode in which you talked about inconsistency in the measurement of the value of dark energy or hubble constant measured with data taken from type 1A supernova and other with cmb's data. Some follow up studies on those type 1A has suggested that dark energy might even be not real and universe might go out in big crunch fashion.
If the Universe ran on "negative 20 questions". that would imply that there is a fundamental predetermined pattern for the "affirmatives" and "negatives" and since anything that can "ask questions" was already generated from the universe and its predetermined pattern up to that point, the "questions being asked" are also predetermined.
I spent a long walk on THC last week traversing this rabbit hole with visualizations of 'subjective agents' (consciousnesses, but also subatomic particles)... um... interactionally or observationally 'collapsing planar waveforms' around themselves, and the reality they experience being defined where those planes overlap... so like, if you can picture (this) reality as the plane where every observational 'bit' happens to align, and every alternate reality in the multiverse being defined by the planes upon which bits tilted otherwise align. It was a pretty trippy trip, there's a reason I was an English major rather than physics.
there is only now. see
It should be apparent by now, that our feeble human mind is much^much too primitive to truly understand and appreciate what the Universe is. Even our best minds fail utterly and completely trying to, coming up with ever more ridiculous ways to express their mind's inability to comprehend it.   We need either an extremely advanced AI or a super-boosted post-human Intelligence to ever have a chance of doing so.
I had an idea once that was very simular to that idea in this video. In thought if there has to be an answer to any question we can ask about the universe then the following must be true, exept if any question that could ever be ask, no matter how stupid it sounds and sense ist mankes, could not be answerd by this asumtion: If you ask why and you get an answer you can always ask why again and get another correct answer. This can be repeated indefenetly, but you can even ask more questions than that. You can ask why one question leads to that answer and ask why again to that question indefenetly. This process can be repeated indefenetly and you can even add layers to that questions again and so on. If this is true then the question arrives, if there is one answer where we can ask why, but get an answer that explains not only the question but also all whys you could ask about that answer. The only answer that can be this answer, must therfore explain everything that could ever be imagend and itself must be the answer about all questions asked about that answer. Since, if the asumtion made in the last sentence is true and you maybe never be abel to answer the question, why something (no matter what) shouldn’t exist, compleatly certan, everything ever imagenable must be in existence and at the same time not at all. With other words, it isn‘t defined what exist and what not. Therfore only in the part of that mess, that nether has an end nor any beginning, since it is the „not definded“, we do exist and only the future that let us exist we will ever be able to get to (all of them).   This thought is now in my mind for multiple years and i really want certanty if this is compleate garbage or it could be true or both. I would very aprichiate if anyone that understands that thought process would answer. Also I‘m sorry for any mistakes since my native language isn‘t english.
At the end, you said that if the universe is inside a black hole, the black hole would have formed in a universe with much different physics than our own owing to it's presumed mass.  However, it seems like perhaps the physics might not have to be so far different if you suppose that the container in which our universe exists is many magnitudes older than out own, such that blacks holes in *that* universe have merged together over time by the force of gravity.  Come to think of it, that brings another question to mind.  Many have asked how our universe would be affected by Hawking Radiation if our universe is inside a black hole, but how about this:  If our universe is inside a black hole, what would happen if the black hole that contains our universe were to merge with another black hole?  Or equally perplexing, What would we observe if the black hole that contains our universe were to absorb a visible star of any size?  Imagine the black hole containing our universe spiraling with another object and merging.  What would we see?
I'm on Team Wheeler!! ;0)
But doesn’t all matter observe all other matter through gravity and EM interactions all the time? Where would there be a particle that is not observed?
That explains why older Space Time videos come up in my feed that I swear I've already observed... but can't seem to remember understanding anything discussed in the episode.
Here is a possible question for a future video to explore, "Why don't black holes form from the event horizon first, then down to the singularity?"  I mean, as a star is collapsing the maximum gravitational pull is a at the surface, not the center. The event horizon should form in a non uniform manner without a singularity at all, only once the event horizon full encloses the matter with does a singularity form.  That's my shower thought anyways.
Truth decays like light refracts and space expands?
So, no reality before hominids or primates or even eukaryotes to probe the universe?
The universe created it self out of boredom and then tried to remain anonymous.
you got the observation thing wrong - in full. Stop. STOP you are not getting it. This is just bad. BAD.
I’ve been interested in this idea since I learned about light and solipsism around the same times. And what makes human language so cool. That we all live in solipsism and have naturally formed language as a species to share our Bits with one another and escape that as much as we can. But I also was interested in what the literal physical reality is that we live in.  That doesn’t the universe actually exist in that there is something there when t=0 in any frame of reference. If t=0 and you could be conscious of it for a moment you would see nothing. No light or any information reaches anywhere. Not even entanglement is relevant. Can anything even be said to exist at all? Suddenly in the moment between one respective snapshot/t=0 of the universe and the next, the entire universe emerges. An infinite set of negative 20 questions emerges in every moment. Or atleast as often when a particle collides with another.
I think you're mistaken when you state that WE are the observer. The observer is just the local universe.
Watching the light photons, you're influencing where the photons end up.  Think of it like using a flame thrower, you're erasing the options that the photon has to go.  Dunno how this is such a mystery.
To me Quantum Mechanics isn’t about how the smallest particles behave. It’s about how isolated systems behave. So it could be said that it should be called Isolated Mechanics. That said, an “observer” suggests an intelligent being asking questions, also unnecessary confusement. It’s about energy or informational transfer between systems.  So to explain the reason behind the above statements, everything behaves like waves, like quantum mechanics describes. Every particle and even entire systems. Until information (energy) is transferred between 2 independent isolated systems, for example a photon and a detector. Then those 2 become 1 system (wavefunction) itself, as long as they are completely isolated from everything else (even thermally). This means that to the photon, the detector alongside the entire lab and everything else is also just 1 wavefunction.  So what does this mean for Schrodinger's cat? For the sake of completeness, this can only happen when “the box” is completely radiationaly (so also thermally) isolated from everything else. Only then can the box be seen as a wavefunction. Within this wavefunction (the box) things can still exist and interact (the cat and the poison), reality can persist. The radiation that causes the poison to kill the cat only collapses the wavefunction of whatever is in the box to whatever is inside the box, not the wavefunction of the box itself, since the box is still isolated it’s still a non collapsed wavefunction.   So what this means, from the outside looking at the box we can know nothing, it's in a superposition, since no information leaves the box. So, for as long as information inside the box has no influence on anything outside the box (the systems are isolated), the cat is dead and alive at the same time, only for everything outside the box and only because the outcome of its state can not be known and thus brings no difference to anything outside the box. Only when information leaves the box the 2 systems become 1. Whatever happened inside the box still happened but is only known to us when we look at it (when information has thansfered from the box to the outside).   So, no paradoxes were created here, at least in my always incomplete opinion.
Why is measurement seen as such a special thing? Even if you measure the distance traveled by a marble with a ruler next to it, the ruler will influence air currents, and exert gravity. It's just that those influences are too small to see. And when you're measuring something as small as a photon, such influences are bound to be much larger by comparison. No magical observer status required.
Nothing has confused man more than the notion that he’s somehow different from the universe he’s observing, like a perfectly isolated observer somewhere outside of space and time. It may have worked as a conception for the description of the classical world but I think it’s increasingly obvious that we’re not different from the universe, we’re features of the universe, observing itself. Like tendrils of an organism feeling itself out. If that then means the the unfolding of spacetime not only happens around us but also through us, its not so difficult anymore to imagine that our observation somehow has an effect on that unfolding…No I’m not high.
Philosophy cannot serve a purpose in defining the universe.    The universe had to exist long before we came along to observe it.    Real objects exist whether or not we look at them; they don't wait for us to look toward them  and then 'pop in from nowhere' just in time to provide the illusion of their existence.                I had a thought: The box containing Schrodinger's cat has a door on each of two opposite sides.     Simultaneously, one observer opens each door.  One sees a living cat; the other sees a dead cat.
I guess, the full scale of a difference between macro and micro universe is yet to be grasped. So, the beamsplitter experiment does not directly define the existence of a moon, nor does it observer's influence. That said, what is observer if not a sophisticated beamsplitter? Is humanity still too afraid to include their "mind" and "soul" to the space-time cloth? We know these things have influence on the macro world, so what makes us think that we don't have influence on the micro one?
This was the first explanation of the mechanism behind the "delayed choice experiment" that really made sense to me. Seeing the waves split and then constructively/destructively interfere at the second beamsplitter was the key: it is still just quantum fields interacting. When I just think of interacting fields, crazy stuff like virtual particles, Hawking radiation, and quantum tunneling make perfect sense. In previous explanations, I think the term "choice" kept "interfering" (haha) with my understanding. The use of words like "observer" and "choice" subconsciously suggest that consciousness or agency have a unique role to play, which causes my mind to freeze and core dump due to a categorical out-of-bounds access violation: "Choice? What choice? It's a quantum wave/photon! It doesn't make choices." Applying macro-level terms to quantum-level events muddies the conceptual waters, but I suppose we need to use macro-level terms to explain what the quantum-level events are in the first place.
Do we really want to go down the road of a Prime Mover or in this case a Prime Observer to explain the the observed phenomena of the Universe? The mechanics of physical reality should not depend on an observer, though the measurements and extrapolated rules/physics may.
“They flutter behind you your possible pasts, Some bright-eyed and crazy, some frightened and lost.”
The center of the universe is precisely in your head at the point your thought of it comes from.

Which is correct?
I feel like asking question to determine reality is fundamentally flawed if it's just sticking to a set of rules that doesn't know the answer to begin with, eg with the No/Yes alternating rules you get:  Is it bigger than a breadbox? No Is it the room the breadbox is in? Yes  Either the universe lied, or there's something else very now misunderstood.
The way human population expands similarly the universe expands coz somthing is causing the expansion
Does this mean that if Edwin Hubble had asked himself a different question, or were looking for something a bit different, he could have found a blue-shift instead of a red-shift, and now we could be experiencing a set of physics theories oriented towards a universe that is collapsing?
Wheeler is my hero, but he needs only 1 extra idea to complete the picture. The issue with consciousness is easily solved if you assume that the capacity for awareness is innate in the universe. There is nothing special about the human brain other than that which is physical, tangible. I like to put it this way: everything that happens is perceived, the only thing that matters is what is the nature of that perception? A pebble lacks a several billion neuron strong neural network, each thing that it perceives would be effectively meaningless without memory or cognitive processes to provide context. Wheeler is on the money, the past doesn't exist, only the present, but in this present moment you have access to all your memories, so you can ascribe meaning to what you perceive. A rock cannot do this, but it's purely because of the physical structure of the object, no magic or souls or what have you. A human could function just fine without being conscious/aware. Is a highly advanced robotic AI conscious? Think carefully before you answer because you yourself are essentially that robot. Unless you believe in souls or something the  you must admit we are just machines. So where does the conscious perception come in? It's just how the universe works. The occurrence and the perception of it are a single event. What matters is how intricate the occurrence is. The state of a human brain at any moment contains within it vast information from well outside its own local time and space. We remember things that have happened, and we collect data from far and wide through our senses, then crucially the neural net in our heads can correlate and organise all of this data into a single, present state of mind. So in essence, the only difference between a rock and a human brain is that one contains a lot more meaningful information than the other. Both are essentially "conscious", but the rock is totally braindead. Everything we associate with consciousness is just a brain function. Senses, memory, cognition, pain and pleasure, even dreams or drug induced states of consciousness. All of it is just the mechanics of the brain computer. If you strip all of that away what is left? I believe there is a profound difference between "non-awareness" and "awareness of nothing", if you follow me. To provide maybe some basis of a mathematical formalism for this, I think a useful tool might be to consider arbitrary regions of spacetime (a 4D volume) and ask questions like, "how much information about the outside system is encoded in the inside system?". A volume might be for example, a human brain over the course of 1 second, or a year, or a lifetime. It could be a pebble or even a planet or star over a million years. It could be the entire observable universe since the Big Bang. It could be an empty boring blob of deep space. Anything. This question is I think the best demonstration of what actually makes brains special and why. They are information collectors/concentrators. Whatever latent cosmic awareness happens to be perceiving that particular region of spacetime is going to have a far more colourful and meaningful experience than for the region of spacetime 1 foot to the left.
To much info for me, I hope I will come back at this video once I am competend <3
Until we look in the box, the cat may be both dead and alive simultaneously as best we know. However, once the box is opened and the cat's state is determined, we can work backward from that observation. If the cat is alive when the box is opened, it's logical to infer that the cat has remained alive all the way through -- given what we know about death and dying. And if the cat is dead when the box is opened, then various things can be measured to better determine the precise moment when the cat actually died -- rigor mortis level, how much oxygen remains in the box, etc.
If you put Schroedinger in a box with a cylinder of poisonous gas, he isn't "both dead or alive", he's one or the other. We just don't KNOW which until we open the box. A massive star a million light-years away it isn't both a star and a supernova until we see it blow, it's one or the other. Schroedinger needed a proper job :P
Man I'm high af rn. I'll come back when I'm sober and do that survey.
I'm stuck on the idea that the universe could not exist without a form of consciousness being present, that both reality and consciousness are intertwined. Because there are observers that experience the passage of time, events occur chronologically. If there was no observer to experience the universe happening, the wave function would never collapse and the universe would be in a superposition of starting,  happening, and ending permanently. Events couldn't be quantified on any timeline because they would always be happening simultaneously, never have happened, and already happened in a single point on an arbitrary "timeline."  I would appreciate some input on this idea :)
So if possible we can "ask" the entangled particles what is beyond the visible universe, or maybe even get a live "video feed" from another place in the universe - this could also be a way of instant communication across space :D
I have always said that the universe exists because it has to. If it didn't, it wouldn't.  It's pretty much as simple as that.
I've been considering making a conlang with a present/non-present tense divide (as opposed to the past/non-past tense divide of english). I wonder if under such a paradigm, wheelers negative 20 questions might be more intuitive.
Interesting episode and I like this information based idea of Wheelers - or at least the parts I somewhat understood. Anyway, after watching this episode I have feeling of a space where different configurations of information can be evolved and every configuration is participating in creation of new spacetime. We are very different participators as earthy living organisms compare to electromagnetic field or star but still every human and every tree is there in it's own spacetime communicating somehow, within it's capabilities, with surrounding universe. To my understanding basically everyone is trying their best to reach as far as possible - trees like to communicate the best way possible with sun light and gasses and liquids and everything. Humans evolve quite fast  because communicating with more and more layers of reality. For Electromagnetic fields and such, those I don't understand at all but my guess is that they speedrun through spacetime to handshake everyone like there's no tomorrow so it's not that they lack of try.
Doesn't quantum theory point to the simulation hypothesis? The universe renders only when observed?
It reminds me of a board game Tobago where location of a treasure is defined by players' choices. Well, actually it was the other way around. When I played Tobago I realized that the rules are somewhat quantum.
Where to post suggestions ???  I want, nay, NEED a video about Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory.  Please please please(!)
Since when have the words, "distinction between the probe and the probed" been more central? Speaking of Erwin Schrodinger, might I recommend the video by Physics Explained (which I watched just this week) concerning how the Schrodinger equation came to be and how it helped shape quantum mechanics? Taking into account all the various, relevant branches of mathematics including probability theory
I have a feeling that the conclusion from the mentioned experiment is wrong. The device that interacts with the photon is significantly larger than the photon itself, thus we cannot claim that it is the same system as the unobserved version that shows the constructive interference. Only a maxwell demon could do that!
Just observing that the Shutterstock girl is very cute!
The intro monologue was convoluted and a horrible way of explaining this. Not a hook, the opposite of a hook.
hmm...
I would like to see an episode on sonic relativity, about the observers using sound clocks and rulers to measure time and distances -  https://youtu.be/BJXaYW_juyw
I wouldn't mind knowing what sort of exoplanets are out there. Cause we all know that there has to be some really really strange ones. I mean there are binary stars, tri-starred, heck there might be planets and such floating in an orbit around a black hole a distance away. I mean the possibilities are endless because science and nature is telling us so. There are so many things in nature that we don't understand that it may take us centuries or millennia before we even come close to being able to fully understand our own backyard fully. However, life is funny and often throws curve balls at us.
NO .
A remake of relativity series!
You can't find a plastic ring with a metal detector
representing reality in terms of bits makes me scared that we’re actually in a simulation 🤔
Is it possible that the universe itself is it's own observer?  That would assume that there's an intelligence to the universe.  Arguably an intelligence that would be so much more vast than anything we could possibly perceive.
strange loop
Hi Matt, long time viewer, and thank you for presenting Wheeler's interpretation.  I am not a physicist, but for years I always thought of the delayed choice experiment as follows: since light does not experience time, there is no such thing as "delayed choice" for the photons.  From their perspective, the different configurations of the experiment simply eliminate possibilities, and the photons end up in a superposition of the remaining possibilities that are consistent with the configurations. Sorry if my interpretation is overly naive.  That's why I will keep watching your show.  Thank you, and please keep them coming.
I like turtles!
Space Time has and will continue to be my favorite YouTube channel thank you!
I have always said that one of the most important questions ever asked was "If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?". I have been grappling with this idea for many years so its nice know I was not alone in this thought and that this idea has proper name, the participatory universe.  TL;DR Time only exists because of observers.  Sorry this is my brain vomit from years of thought...  If you are confused as to why I think the above question is the most important, its the idea that "no one is around to hear it" implies that the event is not measured, ever, for all time. If an event is not measured, did it even happen? Remember you answer! You can't say you observe it's effects on other things, because that an indirect observation of the event, no one and no thing measures this event.  You might think this trivial but wait, this get interesting and paradoxical! A thought experiment will make this idea concrete. Say their is by chance a black hole swarm that is absolutely massive surrounding a region of space with only a Newtons cradle clacking back and forth. The swarm is creating an enclosing sphere that has gaps so outside observers could theoretically get information of the cradle clacking away. The swarm then closes uniformly and perfectly, filling the gaps and making an extremely massive event horizon enclosing the central region. Now the Newtons cradle is suspended in an ever enclosing event horizon from all direction as the singularities continue their fall to the center. At this point the Newtons cradle is behind the event horizon, so I ask you as an outside observer of the swarm/event horizon, is the Newtons cradle still clacking? For all you know the central region fell out instantly when the connection to the rest of the universe was severed, or the inner event horizon instantly closed and destroyed the cradle, or something else entirely. You can't observe the event, ever...so the question now is "Does the universe observe itself". If it does, then the cradle continues to clack before its inevitable doom, even thought you can't prove it. If the universe does not observe itself, then something very *weird* must be true.  The above idea is a precursor to a bigger thought I have been grappling with that is very philosophical and scientific; this is my argument for the universe NOT being able to observe itself..."Does time exist with no observer?" I argue the universe should have a clock speed of "infinity fast", but as soon as an observer is created in the universe the clock is set to the speed of the observer. Why? What stops the speed of time faster than what it is? Is it not true that the universe could run an 2x speed (like a 2x speed YouTube video) with all laws of reality the same and nothing would be different? Why is it that the universe seems to tick at a rate we can comprehend. "Forces and constants and xyz maintain that the universe ticks a non infinite speed and constrain causality to be what we observe it today" you might say.........so do forces and constants and the xyz's exist when their is no observer, ever? Well I think not, remember you answer from the question above! Even if forces and constants do exist without observers time could run at infinite speed and it would not make a difference to reality anyway!  These are my shower thoughts, observers make time tick at non infinite speeds...and what does this imply.....that *an observer is more than just some particles in the universe...the observer is something very, very special*.
I hope we never find out.
It's two thousand eight.  NOT two thousand and eight!
When does he explain if the universe creates itself or not?
Conveniently released on 4/20.  Love it.
I'm from Krypton.
Here's an idea to look into: assume a base unit of spacetime -- say a "stixel" one planck-length in diameter and a unit of planck-time in duration -- but this has equal measurement in every part of the universe at a specific instant, whether matter/energy is present or not; also, while acknowledging that the ratio of this unit and the size of the universe would be infinite, assume that for any two points in time (X & Y), there is a finite ratio between the stixel at X & the stixel at Y.  Finally, assuming all the other physical laws function in the usual way, just replacing spatial units AND temporal units with the the corresponding parts of the stixel, what's the difference between how an expanding universe looks and how a universe of constant size but shrinking stixel would look?  Or, perhaps more interestingly, between a universe expanding where there is no matter/energy, or one where the stixel shrinks where matter/energy exists?

Good 4/20 video, man.
Here is a question for you: What is movement at the fundamental level? Movement through space, yes, but what does it actually mean?
Poor cat.
We are the universe perceiving itself
I really enjoy these science pieces, but this whole theory about the universe being "formed" by the observer is the most ridiculous junk science I've ever heard. The main problem is the trying to apply the same rules to the macro world that apply to the quantum realm is utterly  unworkable. If those same rules applied to both realms, we would have a unified field theory 50 years ago. Clearly these scales work with different laws or at least ones we have yet to dicifer
Deepak Chopra just rolled over in his… well enormous pile of money
gobbledygook. we have no understanding and certainly no definition of consciousness. shut up and calculate.
This is completely nonsense
The universe and everything, animate and inanimate, follows only one basic rule - EVOLUTION! Evolution is the basic force that controls everything, and in a very simple way: IT CAN / CAN'T, if it can, it survives and thrives, if it CANNOT, it doesn't exist. All matter and energy communicates through EVOLUTION, if forces and energy attract, create matter, matter with its properties and energy creates other matter and so everything goes as long as it can in a certain form, when not, things change and seek a new path of EVOLUTION!
Apparently I was supposed to keep up with the past 12 years of his videos and comprehend them in order to successfully watching this vid 😑. #fml
WHAT THE F@CK IS THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT??
The delayed choice has been debunked, among others by S. Hossenfelder.
Hmm... sad to see these patreon things! Science education should not have anything to do with money... sooner or later it takes away the focus of its cause!
love this one
So if a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to see it dose it make a sound
I am astonished about the clarity with which you are able to present complex space time and quantum mechanics related topics. I have an immense pleasure and interest in following your presentations since already a long time now. Congratulations and thanks.
So the Universe is the Dungeon Master, scientists are their players, and they're just improvising their sessions by rule of cool lol
Is the participatory universe linked to the idea that space is defined by entanglements between particles? They seem like similar ideas to me.
12:12 exactly that
I like to imagine the universe as the game of “negative 20 questions” where every question is answered with “yes”. The questions are questions, but effectively double as observations.
Can the observed reality be one product of the infinite unobservable reality?  Another thought that I have: if we go down to the infinitely smallest thing in the universe, it is both mass/non-mass at the same time.
If the universe is within a black hole, then the singularity is infinitely dense. The universe within is just on an infinitely smaller scale.
I really need to know where the universe is expanding at the speed of light and where this has been observed. It's just not easy to comprehend given that through observations both locally and billions of light years away we see collisions at the galactic scale taking place. Spacial expansion to me denotes galaxies should never collide or merge
Thank you PBS Space Time for keeping our hope in humanity alive
Any black hole itself isn't a universe, but an anti-matter galaxy in the anti-matter universe.
This makes me think of an earlier episode, though I forget which particular one, which defined Entropy as being the extent of interaction and entanglement between particles within a system.  The idea that what makes reality real is not the individual particles and 'components', but instead the interactions between them.
This kind of sounds like an example of the Bootstrap Paradox. If the past events that lead to the observers recording those past events are themselves CAUSED by the observations...that creates a causality loop. It would be like receiving the blueprints for a time machine from yourself from the future, which you use to build the very time machine you used to travel back in time to give your younger self the blueprints for, perpetuating the cycle.
I am wondering, in quantum mechanics, how do you know that all decisions are binary? Why does the wave function always have to collapse completely? What if there is an observation that narrows the wave function down, but doesn't collapse it completely?  For example, imagine the double slit experiment, but this time we have 4 slits. When there are no detectors on the slits, we get an interference pattern. When we have a detector on each slit, we see the outlines of the 4 slits. But what if we have only two detectors, each one only telling us whether a particle went though one of a pair of slits or not. This way, the detectors only narrow it down to two slits instead of 1. In this case, would we see an interference pattern created by the two slits, or would we see the outline of the two slits in the detection? Why?  Also, in the case of us "creating our reality" by asking questions, would the resolution of our observations define the detail with which reality is able to definite itself? For example, what if bob asked marry "what color is the cat" and marry said "not yellow". In this case, this has only narrowed down the possibility space a little bit, but it is still continuous in the color dimension. You could say that this is a binary question in disguise, and it is basically the same as asking "is the cat yellow", but I think it would be more accurate to say that we are asking marry to choose a color out of, say, ROY G. BIV than a binary question. If she had answered "Green", our possibility space would be narrowed down more, but we still do not have only one possibility for the color, as there are many different shades of green. It seems to me, that you could never fully "collapse" the possibility space by asking any sort of question, especially binary questions.  I think this principle applies for things like telescopes too. In an ordinary camera, we have 2^24 color possibilities for each pixel (256 possibilities for Red, Green, and Blue). When you take a picture of a star or something, you narrow collapse the wave function of that star to one possibility out of all the possible values for each pixel on your camera. This, however, does not eliminate every possibility for the nature of that star, as there are many more shades of colors in the visual spectrum than 2^24, and we only have a limited number of pixels. Despite gaining a lot of information, there is still a continuum of possibilities for this star to exist in. It seems to me that we have not full collapsed the system's wave function, if there is such a possibility.  So, if a wave function collapses, does it always collapse to a single point of infinite probability, or is it possible to partially collapse wave functions? If they always "fully collapse" how do we know? If not, doesn't this basically mean that there's no base, objective reality that is possible to verify?
Nonsense !
Time to go watch YES Theory youtube channel lol!
Woh this is the theory of the universe I’ve always had
It's a temporal universe that allows for observers. Extrapolate from there.
😊👍
it didn't create nor has been created. The thermodynamics speaks for itself: nothing is made, nothing is loss. Universe always existed and can just change. The penrose diagram shows clearly how things changes and that's how the universe worked in the instant of the big bang. Nothing "broke down", rules were still the same.
Fascinating and informative👍
The answer is YES.
If the observer has to observe or "visualize" something for it to "exist", then how do we "observe" (as in allow photons to take the time to reflect off of an object and reach our eyes) it in the first place? Shouldn't it's superposition have already been determined prior to the light reflecting off of it and reaching our eyes?  This stems from an earlier thought that we can only visualize the past because light takes time to travel from an object to our eyes.   Final thoughts: Theres the time it takes for electric signals to pass from neurons in our eyes to our brains. is the universe happening in reverse but we experience it pushing forward? I need to go to bed...
I've spoken to quite a few rocks about the whole observer thing and they think it's a pile of rubble. They find it exclusionary due to undertones of bio supremacy and self-directed motion privilege peppered throughout its terminology. Now we see the violence inherent in the system.
maybe you would make a series on "physics" and the ideas contained in the trilogy "Remembrance of Earth's Past" by Liu Cixin.  have you already made a movie about the curvature engine, maybe now about the dark domain?
Quantum theories strike me as modern day magic.  Once upon a time we couldn’t explain many things about the world, and so we invented magic and gods to explain the unknown.  And that’s what all of these theories are doing.  We don’t understand what we’ve observed in some experiments, and so we create these elaborate, mostly ridiculous explanations for them.  Someday, in a future in which the oddities we’ve observed make simple, perfect sense, the people of that time will look back on all of these theories and laugh at the silly things we used to believe.
In other words, we are all inside a digital computer called “God”. Or a rouge digital computer simulation of reality.
I'm skeptical of any explanation that says we humans matter to the universe's existence.
Is "The material and the conscious arise as each other" a way to think of it, in his frame?
As Carlo Rovelli would say, there's a difference between subjective and observer/perspective-dependence.
can we use quantum entanglement to create faster than light information transfers?  e.g. one side measures a particle and the other side measures it, but by the effect of the first measurement the second measurement is affected in some way to effectively pass a 1 or a 0 through, which we then stream a series of bits into
Arrogant nonsense. The universe didn't exist until there was someone to observe it? If the universe didn't exist, where did the observer come from? The observer creates the entire universe at the moment of observation? Now let's look at the negative 20 questions. I tell you I'm thinking of two numbers. I'll alternate yes and no answers. The first guess is '7'. The answer is 'yes'. The second guess is 9, the answer is no. The third guess is 2 the answer is yes. So the numbers are 2 and 7. So what? This answers no  question and surely doesn't mean I have 9 of anything. Feynman was so right. It's an exercise in semantics at best and arrogance at worst.   It's a lot like 'if a tree falls in the forest and there is no one there to hear it fall does it make a noise'? We can leave a tape recorder in the forest and it will record the sound of the tree falling. In this case does the machine satisfy the requirement for having an observer?  The larger problem is that physicists can barely describe quantum effects, let alone understand what causes them. The beam splitter experiment, even the double split experiment do little more describe quantum activity. While physicists claim to explain how the results came about, no one actually knows. By logic and logical inference combined with what we do know there is speculation, but that is not knowing what the actual mechanism is at work. The same with quantum entanglement. So while speculation is fun it is also misleading when presented as anything else. Not that PBS is doing this but there is no shortage of pop physicists happy to 'explain' how things work at the quantum level. If only they actually knew.
So basically the universe is NOT a sandbox
In a way it seems true that everyone is creating their own reality, because colors and sounds actually don't exist in the world outside of our consciousness. They're waves or vibrations in a specific frequency but our mind makes it into a color or sound and that always bugs me how that's done...
Please update us about the great atractor or the great wall
This all might make more sense if instead of the vague notion of "information" - we used Wittgenstein's notion of tautological mathematics. The universe could be self-generated without the need for anything separate or beginning.   phenomena become like a projection / transformation  inside a fractal / scale invariant mathematical substance.
So this may be from me not understanding the implications of the participatory interpretation, but this feels really bean county, like a useful construct that simplifies something either more fundamental or completely different. Am I alone in thinking this?
Excellent video. Getting closer to the truth now. Physicists need to get past the mental block of saying “quantum woo” to address these hard questions.
🤯
Science, philosophy and religion are different things. When they merge things can get wierd.
Total misunderstanding of the relationship between Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics. An "observation" occurs exactly when an irreversible thermodynamic event has occurred. It can be the absorption of a photon on photographic film or a CCD.  In any case, an observation occurs when energy is converted into heat. It has ZERO to do with consciousness other than the obvious fact that operation of consciousness involves degradation of available energy into heat.
Maybe the reason our laws break down and become useless after a certain amount of time after the creation of the universe , is because God made the laws after he made the universe.
Observation being Interaction has always been my understanding of quantum mechanics and I honestly loathe the term "observation" in this context because it implies that consciousness is needed for any interaction to happen and so many misunderstandings are based on this misnomer.  As for the universe creating itself, I strongly suspect that some axis of the universe is recursive as that's the only logical path I see to self-causation, which is required so the cosmos can be a closed system.
In my blog almost 8 years ago, while thinking deep about the universe, i wrote exactly the same thing, "Observation is Interaction" and i so relate with all the ideas of this Video.  Loved it 🧡🙏
I really like how the episode just STARTS when you tap play, no intro, just Matt talking science to us. Also.. this is wild stuff
can everyone who's reading this make a video of some people playing Negative Twenty Questions and put it on youtube?  There seem to be none.
what if there's a question that when asked resets the universe or even pulls us into an upper dimension so that we may observe reality outside our normal reality.  I could be that the only thing keeping everything going is that the question hasn't been asked.
Sounds like Information bottleneck method. RIP Tishby.
If White holes don't exist, does that mean Einstein erred in his Theory of General  Relativity?
So the universe exists because God wanted a relationship with people.
“The world was created by information”sure sounds like a different way of saying God spoke the universe into existence.
Balance of the furies, reality is the interplay of yin and yang
The past is a memory, the future a dream, and the present doesn't exist at all.
If it sounds wishy washy it's because it is.  Mind blown!
You are saying God made the world with free will & didn’t predestine everyone’s actions.
Let us start with a fundamental process in nature.  Apples always, and I repeat, always fall from a tree.  They have been doing this for millennia, and, as far as I know, for all time with no exceptions.  Hence, our mathematical models of the evolution of the universe regardless of "measurements".  How does quantam mechanics, and no arguments on my point as to its clear validity, lead us to the fact that apples always fall from a tree, with no observable exceptions, ever.  Pun intended. As another example, the mathematical models of the evolution of the universe.  Quantum mechanics in these models?  Point A, quantum mechanics, to point B, apples falling from a tree.  Bridge the gap.  I clearly am at a complete loss as to how to reconcile the two.  Perhaps others have bridged this gap.  Point me in the right direction.  Or, perhaps that is what you have just done.  If so, clearly beyond my understanding.  Seems to me the same problem bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and gravity, a.k.a., quantum mechanics and an apple falling from a tree.  The biggest unsolved problem in physics nowadays, or not?  The problem I have is what am I to believe, quantum mechanics, or an apple falling from a tree? Apparently, they are not irreconciliable, but for the life of me I cannot understand why.  Granted, rhetorical questions.
If Einstein predicted White holes, have astronomers ever found one? If they have, what does it look like, and if astronomer have not, what would it possibly look like?
Damn universe . . . 😒
Sir, If according to qft, every elementary particle can be understood by a wave in its field, then can we convert an electron(in it's wave form) to a quark(in it's wave form), because we can just add waves together (possibly with the help of light waves)to make any wave form we want by forier transforms, so elementary particles can be interchangeable, is it possible?
So observing the past  of the universe, via telescopes, causes it to have existed?  Yet the past was there before humans existed to observe it.  Also, what blows my mind about quantum physics - what is so special about us humans that our acts of observation causes a quantum state to break down into a given state?
What is up with the plethora of caricature paper dolls... seems super out of place or am i missing something
I still cant get my head around quantum physics and the double slit experiment/ this splitting mirror version of it. Like Ive watched so many videos on it and im able to understand other things but this is one that I feel like I have yet to get that “ohhhh” realization. It just doesn’t make sense
What if the universe actually was created only few minutes/hours/days ago? But for it to be possible, it requires being so stable that it needs to create a path both backward and forward in time in a logic manner (nothing that break the laws of physic). Meaning, we get the illusion, from everything we observe, and from how matter is structured with all it creates (including us and our memories) and how/where all particles are (including those from the observations of the Big Bang), that it was created some 13.8 billions years ago ?
Is there a way to perform an experiment similar to the beam splitter experiment you described with equipment you can easily purchase and use at home?
I realized I didn't exist so I existed I realize there was nothing so there was something
Wheeler is my hero.
debunking the delayed choice quantum eraser https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQv5CVELG3U&t=0s
QUESTION : What if electric charge is like mass, and there is a field like Higgs field that gives particles charge? And is it possible that spin is also given by a field ?
QUESTION :  We know that the fundamental forces were once United when the universe was hot enough, then is it possible that after many years the now known fundamental forces will split up, like electromagnetism would split into electric and magnetic force for example?
Good luck explaining universe without including the observer or pretending that observer is just a mechanistic process which exists on the same level of reality as the observation itself.  Wheeler was at least heading in the right direction by focusing on the act of observation, which subtlu includes observer and the observed, but this time you would sound less woo-woo. However, observation is not an additional third thing to the observer + observed combo. Either talk about observer & observed object or act of observation, but not both simultaneously.  Slowly they are accepting information to be fundamental or at least accurate description of reality. Then it is about knowledge - knower and known. Then how knowledge is contextual and relative. Then knower being first and independent of the object known - knower knowing both presence and absence of the known object. Ultimately knowledge of object depending completely on the knower as object is not separate or anything more than its knowledge!  Welcome to metaphysics!
Here's an idea for a topic: if the shortest distance measurable is the Planck length, and particles can't be measured in between, does that not mean the fabric of space-time is digital?
So we are all each just a manifestation of the universe experiencing itself subjectively.
QUESTION: Sir, If according to qft, every elementary particle can be understood by a wave in its field, then can we convert an electron(in it's wave form) to a quark(in it's wave form), because we can just add waves together (possibly with the help of light waves)to make any wave form we want by forier transforms, so elementary particles can be interchangeable, is this possible?
Are there any tests which can be run on the participatory universe's predictions? This theory seems like it might border on unfalisifiability
Do a video on Christopher Langan’s theory, the CTMU! It would connect perfectly with this video being that John Wheeler himself took a great interest in Chris’ work.
My brain hurts
think of it like this you have 1 very advanced hard drive and you go a full universe into filling the memory full and your almost out of fuel WHAT DO YOU DO? you process that hard drive to its simplified form replicate it figure out a way to create thrust with the data on 1 drive and still have the data in the end. you reverse the order and do the exact same thing.taking it all the way back to the very beginning.to the point where you started from.that way when the end is out of your hands you know theres at least 1 person. that will do exactly as you did.following the path you etched in stone. in this case memory.
Please do an episode on Quantum Transaction Theory
The bit theory is absolutely correct ,we exist as a storage vessel for the univers ,like a bit in a computer ,it stores the experience of the observer to experience itself .its a symbiotic relationship we exist for the universe to exist  .without an observer there is nothing .
See in my mind when the single photon hits the beam splitter it's forced into alignment and then only goes one way through the second splitter.  I don't agree with the reasoning behind the double split experiment I think something akin to pilot wave theory would be more likely.  The cat is clearly either dead or alive, the first scientist and the cat can verify this, the only thing not known about it is the knowledge of it.  I think everyone is over thinking things and jumping to conclusions. I think there's possibly something wrong with Einstein's theories and this in turn leaves something massively wrong in quantum theory.  Building off one unverified thing after another of course is going to get you a shaky model on the universe.  It's important to follow all relevant theories but I think too much focus is being put in the more out there ideas without much reason as to why and without getting any closer to the answers.
Best deduction of the Schrödinger paradox I've seen to date. Good job!
I feel like squidward in that episode of spongebob where squidward is curled up in ball repeating the word "future" over and over.
The Big Bang was created by crashing Time Machines.
I thought it was more about expounding and analyzing Hawking's famous statement "Because there is a law such as gravity, the Universe can and will create itself from nothing"
I think there are innumerable "centers" of the cosmos. Who says our visible universe isn't a link in an infinitely sizeless Everything? We just don't live long enough to even comprehend the actions that take place on the much grander of smaller scales. There are entities that consist of cells the size of our visible universe for whom billions of our years feel like moments, and then they are just midgets comparing to their "spacial superiors", and so on... And then there is the smaller order...
Matt: We have determined that our universe is created from answering questions.  Matt shortly later: Please answer our 8 question survey.  Matt next episode:  Physicists have just discovered 256 new universes.
This is very difficult to understand
This is the closest to Truth this channel has ever gotten. Embrace the woo!
Good god, this was one of the most mind-bending episodes ever. I am all for it
faith in spirit.
So only sentient beings observe? Do ants observe? Do they question? Or bees? Can’t tell? Can’t observe? Can’t decide? Oh my!
quantum biology plz
Question about quantum experiments: How do we know the mirrors and other apparatus aren't affecting any results? Could we interpret the atoms of the mirror as "observing" the photon when it absorbs the photon, potentially skewing our experiments?

Since 2015, he has been the writer and host of PBS Space Time, a video series by PBS Digital Studios.
So, you put together this video... but it's content didn't change when we observed it.
Once again absolutely in love with the animation, writing, topic, and explanation. You're an excellent communicator. If I had one criticism for this episode, I think that when talking about "observation" and the collapse of the wave function it should be explicitly clarified what our current understanding of what constitutes an "observation". I know this has been discussed in more detail before but you guys are usually very good with quick recaps and 'error bars' when proposing / explaining an idea.
at the moment of bigbang, there was infinite density so the time (for us the observers now) would have stopped completely.  so can we say that the big-bang happenned infinite time ago.  due to infinite densities can it mean the speed of light was also slower at that time.
Did he say the delayed response experiment was a thought experiment?
Are Alice and Bob real people? Just wondering.
I'm just an ordinary person who can't divide a common fraction without a calculator but... I stopped in here to see if he was going to touch on my line of thought. Black holes exist but they think white  holes exist too. If they're right then of course the universe creates itself.  The black hole socks it in & dismantles everything. I think the white hole takes the raw material and throws it back out into space. There, it will reform a new and different universe.
So basically it's a big Minesweeper game
The fact that we have these interpretations and have to use these interpretations to explain the universe tells us (at least how I see it) that we are missing some fundamental aspect(s) of the universe. It may be completely undetectable with our current technology, or it may be detectable but only if we knew what to look for, it may even be so bizarre that looking in the right places in the right ways would seem to go against everything we currently know (please let it not be that one because as soon as it discovered some peddler of pseudoscience will come out and proclaim to have predicted it then try to get you to invest in his "free energy" machine).  There is precedent for this, dark matter and dark energy were not predicted by anyone (no Einstein's cosmological constant doesn't count because they thought the universe was static back then and Einstein was trying to make relativity match the universe that had been observed at the time and that) but they were found. It seems to me that there is a "metaphorical dark" matter in quantum physics waiting to be discovered and once it is and is examined and explained it will solve some issues in quantum physics.
Love your shows!  Anything on the JWST's captures.  Have waited so long for this!
You get older, every video; not just literally, but you actually look older.
Dear PBS Space Time, I would like more videos on the topic of Quantum gravity, black holes, white holes, and their effects on the nature of time and space, and our perception of it.
Program Suggestion: Not sure who it was (YouTube: Varitasium? That asked the question Do we really have to speed of light correct as we have no direct observable way to know if the speed of light is constant.  Maybe we need to question this reality.??
This is one of my favorite episodes. So interesting.
YES
I'm just an amateur/armchair physicist so don't be too harsh but I would love to hear real ones tell me why I'm wrong to think so simplistically.   My question is about the wave function, it's collapse and the observer effect. At the core of it, isn't the collapse of the wave function just triggered by the interaction with other quantum object, another wave function? Why isn't that simply it? Why even speak of the observer effect? Even worse, invoke the idea that consciousness is required? The cat in Schrödinger's box is too large a system to ever be in a quantum state (without even mentioning that it's alive and moving and metabolizing), so would be the mechanism, or even the air in the box, because their constituents are constantly breaking each other's quantum states by interacting with each other? Why is the answer simply not that? That the wave function describing the probability that the mechanism triggers the kill switch in Schrödinger's box isn't descriptive of what's happening in the box, where the cat is either dead or alive, but rather a limitation of our knowledge because we are isolated from that system?  And this is a real long shot, but if the answer is that we have no idea about what brings two quantum objects to even interact, would it be naive to think that maybe that's where quantum gravity comes into play? When it brings together objects in a quantum state, that "collapses" their wave forms, because they collided? Couldn't a graviton be the last logical exchange between two collapsing wave functions? Where "gravity" is the sum of all those interactions?  I'm sure this is a naive understanding born of not knowing all the math but I've always wondered why that isn't simply it. (the first part, the second part about quantum gravity is just my brain playing armchair theoretical physicist)  edit: Got my answer. Turns out this is Penrose school of thought and I'm just now figuring out what he means more clearly.
1:00 this is incorrect.  See Sabine Hossenfelder.
To me, the Quantum Erasure experiment along with the Double Slit experiment all but prove that Many Worlds is the correct interpretation. but I believe that everything exists, all possible universes with all possible values and variations and they branch out into all possible scenarios for that universe. Why should our universe exist and not one with different values?  To me, that  would imply something choosing what should exist, which implies a creator.  But I doubt this because you can just ask, well what created the creator?  Thats why I feel that theres a very good chance that everything exists, simultaneously, with infinite universes branching infinitely.
Does the delayed choice experiment still work using massive particles instead of photons?  If I understand correctly, a photon moves at the speed of light and does not experience time, so both choices are made at the same instant from the perspective of the photon. Then the choice is not delayed and the interference feels a little bit less weird.
I think what Wheeler might have been noticing is not that our questions create objective reality, but rather that our questions create our ontology. It sound like he was committing the classic sin of conflating the model of the thing with the thing itself. Our view of partial physics is nothing more than a framework. As with all inductive knowledge, we don't know 100% how it actually works. So we watch and try to put the pieces back together. But just because our models don't make any sense doesn't mean the universe itself doesn't make any sense. Clearly the universe knows how to keep universing correctly, we're the ones who are confused about what its doing.
Maybe just maybe being fixated on a shared objective reality is the problem not wether it exists or is even necessary to exist or for reality to exist. Maybe all our subjective realities are objective in and of themselves. Sharing our own observations accurately for ourselves is difficult enough and depending on what information we are trying to communicate and how we are communicating as well.
God I hope I live to see a Theory of Everything.  Hopefully it doesn’t discover some weird Lovecraftian truth about the universe, like all existence is an illusion that collapses the instant you become conscious of it, or something.
I think these scientists make this carp up just to sell books and fill classrooms.
Until we know what consciousness is (and we never will), all this is a cat chasing its tail.
Borrring.
This is one of the ideas that kind of makes my head spin. I work in IT, so quantum information makes a degree of conceptual sense to me, but I'm going to have to rewatch this a few times to wrap my head around the seeming reciprocal dependency nature of this.
I now realise why people choose religion so easily answering their inner  questions   Who would think and study about these questions just say "God" and move on 😂
it's funny cause the laws of attraction and manifestation are much more real than his dumb U theory about questions creating reality lmao. Entropy is a zipper between space and time, past, present and future, they're all the same zipper. Time as we experience it is the transformation, the past and future, they're all actions and reactions, you can't have a future without a past, you can't have children without parents, of course the future implies the existence of the past, and the past defines the future if you can predict the outcome of the data before you, like you would predict weather patterns. It's all one big mandelbrot fractal that is relative to everything interacting through it. Observers included. Tht's why it's not getting us anywhere to observe wave functions by their wavelength evolution through time rather than their self-stabilized gravitational force field tunneling. It's asking a stupid question, so you can't get an answer that makes sense.
Is the ''Space'' beyond the expansion of the Universe a vacuum?  Does it have to be to allow the ever accelerating expansion?  Could it be a Gravitational attraction pulling the Universe outward?
I would say yes. The universe pretty much did create itself.
Glad to see another video. I can’t get enough!
How is Wheeler's idea different from the Many Worlds view?  They both seem to invoke selection bias to resolve the "collapse" of the wavefunction.  It is a lot easier for me to think about the space of all possibilities as being real independent of the observer (Everett) than have a real state that is indeterminate (Wheeler).  I don't see how he gets out of making observers special, or any of the other Copenhagen madness, if the information in the system isn't wholely real on its own.  In contrast, Many Worlds actually makes QM more elegant.
I comment so much on your awesome videos and I wish I could delete them. If there was a way to maybe to a 10 v 1 with you, like 10 viewers verses you on saying how cool you are and asking some hypotheticals to you and getting your thoughts lol. Your videos are so helpful, I feel like I’m ready to go head to head with Elon Musk on these topics. Thank you for changing my perspective on how I INTERACT with other wave functions in this universe we all share together.
"Defining 'observer' to be any other *particle* might save a lot of confusion...",  is what I was writing right when 12:06 came along: "observation = interaction".  I wish this point were clarified more often!
What a bunch of bullsh!t.
CHILL... enjoy the thrill.
I will participate in your survey, otherwise it might not exist.
who are the cut out people?
The universe feels like a blockchain where quantum level events are your pending transactions, these "transactions" are organized into a sequential block after the observer take a measurement.
entropy is the global energy balance of the universe stretching
Does jet fuel melt beamsplitters?
I find those "puppets" a little  distracting tbh
Wouldn't there be no measurable difference in a "simulated" universe as opposed to a "real" one?
If the universe is fundamentally informational, would that imply that we can never have a theory of everything? As we probe the universe more deeply, are we forcing new phenomena to arise? New phenomena which in turn increase our understanding and allowing deeper delving?
So do we really exist or we just the figment of some evil genie or... Universe?
So in a sense, the information recorded in the bodies of the ~100 trillion organisms living in and on the average person at any given moment could be the "observation" that helps create the reality around them? It has always felt like the debate on reality doesn't take into effect all the things around us that we don't normally think of, and this approach kind of deals with that in a way. Very cool.
Sponsored by The Secret LOL
why doesn't CC match his speech?
This was a great explanation. Thank you for the effort.
Thanks for supporting the show Mark!
An episode on the question of "why is there anything at all" / "why is there something rather than nothing" and whether physics has the epistemic tools to answer it would be a great one, if you're looking for more ideas for episodes like this. Sean Carroll has some ideas on it
Are the black scientist figures used in examples a compensation for the fact that the most discussed scientists in your video's are white ?
Ok, wild thought... Could the big bang be originated by the random appereance of some individual or a pair of particles that interacted with itself or the other particle, functionally acting as an observation of the quantum system, and that lead to a cascading effect of interactions making more and more stuff manifesting as real particles and eventually forming our universe?
Whenever you need a graphic for a scientist, it's always the guy at 02:31.  There must be a story behind him.  I'm curious to know who he is.
I don't know why physicists so stubbornly refuse to refer to de Broglie / pilot-wave theory.  It got a passing mention here, but when thinking in these terms, so many of the "paradoxes" of quantum mechanics just go away.  Like the delayed choice experiment, so mind-bending in the Coopenhagen interpretation, is straightforward in the pilot-wave interpretation.  The second beam-splitter lets the wavefunction interfere with itself, and the particle follows the wavefunction.  It simply can't go where the wavefunction cancels itself out.  No delayed choice is being made, the observer has no effect, and all along everything is just as real and physical as if the photons were billiard balls.  Maybe it's just me but whenever I'm puzzled by a quantum effect I consider it in terms of pilot-wave theory and it starts to make sense.  When it was shown locality and reality were incompatible, physicists basically made the decision to keep locality and discard reality in order to stick with Coopenhagen.  Sorry but shouldn't reality be the last thing we jettison?  As Matt says, reality is what science is all about.
he has a certain run-on way of speaking that would never work for a good lecture
An episode about Lee Cronin's Assembly Theory would be incredible!!!
Why would you waste processor cycles on things users aren’t looking at aka using.   QM is an argument for simulation.
If the light is reflected by the beam splitter, shouldn’t that apply some force to the beam splitter that wouldn’t happen if the light went through? So couldn’t you theoretically do the delayed choice experiment where the photon had to take both paths, but then see if the beam splitter (assuming it’s in a vacuum and not attached to anything) had some momentum that it didn’t have before? I know a single photon would barely have an effect, it shouldn’t it at least be theoretically possible?
Thing is check anton , there are discoveries every single damn day, more n more wild things that ain't life but there certainly a thing with some power doing something to some other thing n also thats what we Kno, 76% else is simply dark matter dark energy which is a nice way of saying , total blank, can't concieve a answer,. Now if the old folks stories of arab jews Christians mentioned what was really in the cosmos that would be some god level guessing story,. The women who's husband is told she's  pregnant by an angel must have been the most devout men ever to live,. I know it's me on camera but you see me, where as it'd be better if you saw god. N u can pay for that. N ur welcome fight n kill for these guys uh gods there real they tell american presidents to bring jesus to middle east n god wants america to rule due to exemptionslism now ur thinking what about before usa existed,. Simple god wasn't in the field yet. Only when usa fights does god allign with nowadays. Most people r more rational , certainly hope so cause jesus didn't george bush anything. And manifest destiny could also be simply, made up n not from god, it's beyond mosts education or reason or care to no , but real life is worth realizing what forces are really ur opps in life.
Cats. Cats are always the observer. Even when we are asleep, they are always there, watching.
if the past depends upon the observations made in the present, and there are more than 1 observers why not diffrent past for diffrent observers ?
No No Yes No Yes Yes Sometimes Yes No No Not Sure Sometimes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes  I hope I was able to answer everyone's questions.
keep talking  about how we cant measure under plank. That made things click for me more than anything. And inertia.  And interactions. The fact that certain fundies can not interact with us at all, and sometimes only weakly, is as close to multi dimensions ive seen. The force between entangled particles does not interact, thus, no time needed to travel. it does not interact at C with the substrate
No, time and space is the result of the gravity of the mass of matter which requires energy that cannot make or direct itself.
If the Universe is "whatever isn't ruled out by previous self-interaction consistent with a particular set of rules" (which is how I am interpreting this idea after first viewing), then wouldn't the "end" of the Universe be once it is forced into a contradiction, and no further consistency is possible? Or maybe even just as a local phenomenon, where some patch of space-time is locked into a very small region of phase space which allows for a coherent, consistent reality?
you drive me crazy
There is a new hypothesis about a "mirror anti-universe" that could explain dark matter. Would be interested about that topic
Okay, if we had 4 instead of two ways the light can travel in the choice experiment, wouldnt we be just able to perceive the outcome? And would that mean that only the measured outcome is fact and the roads take remain in a a possibility state even after we measured it?  And if this is the case, wouldnt that mean that the wave function even in the past doesnt collaps in some cases and its only the outcomd that does? Would that mean that there are multiple possible past's that exist at once, and will always, because we "can only measure the result and not the path taken"???? o.O  ... this is something i ask myself since i was 16. And also, how long is a measurement "active"?? When i observe something, and i note it down and forget about it, and i find it 20 years later, with no idea whats on it... Would that mean that... Well.  You know what i mean. The dice get rolled new...?  *I never wrote a comment where i wanted an answer so damn much*
Atoms create and make up everything in the Universe.
seems fractal to me.
I think the participatory universe is a credible metaphysical model, but as to the epistemology of the matter, I think it's fundamentally unknowable.
Strong Anthropic Principle!! It exists! I swear I came up with this on my own... but like John Lennon said "I'm not the only one". YES. This HAS to be TRUE!
It's interesting how the information theory style propositions are so bizarre to physicists, yet so intuitive and almost too obvious to be true to us software engineers and computer scientists. To us, it's just, oh, yeah, that's a generative adversarial algorithm.
Wasn't "expanding into the future" something Feynman said? It's defintely a thought that I've heard more than once before.
Hey really love the videos and it always makes my mind wonder for a long time after watching. After reading "the elegant universe" by  Brian Greene, the anthropic principle always intriguided me espeacially when combined with this idea that we can't connect forces and theoretical ideas of the quantum world with our obsevable, real and "existing/happening" universe in such exemples as the force of gravity or what existed before the big bang (the expansion of the dimensional and observable universe). Do you believe it is possible that any observer in the universe, being us or any other "thing", will ever be able to go as far as discovering the mysteries of what controls the quantum fields and interactions in this less than planck scale, if looking into it would disrupt the structure of what this very forces are controlling in the big scale (such as the observer)? Would love for a sort of video mixing a more profound idea of the anthropic principle combined with the idea that there is more to the universe beneath the planck scale, if it is possible or not for us to prove that more exist, maybe talking about the multi dimensional hypothesis of the fabric in the ultra small universe like looking at a 3d string from too far away, wich is my ideia of what happens in the basis of everything
.. and repeats endless times itself exactly the same ? YEAHHH !!! Here we are :)
Why all this "How the universe is what it is" questions and not "Who created the universe"?
I have a curious question. Not sure if it really has been explained. I am know people have thought about.  How do particles intelligently form form from particles into organisms that eventually present consciousness?
In one way or another the answer will be always YES. Even if you believe in some sort of "observer" bullshit, he is still part of the universe.
Videos that include description of the experiment or experiments that were pivotal in answering theoretical questions are nice.  Would like more dives into the experiments that helped up figure out which theories about our space time were more correct.
Did your mom birth herself?
In the end the only thing I got from this whole thing is that Richard Feynman seemed to be the only sane person in the field
All this intelligence trying to explain our origins when we all realize it was a supernatural act. You just have to figure out who to give credit to. I personally give it to Jesus. Coming from an atheist background and finally looking at the alternative theories with an open mind. The evidence is overwhelming in all categories of science for those open minded enough to seek.
Complete nonsense. For our measurements to create or influence stars we can see on other side of galaxy would require information to travel faster than light.
Fascinating!  Wheeler's negative 20 questions reminds me of a Wordle variant called "Absurdle" which uses your guesses to narrow down the space of possibilities. It's maximumly challenging to get to an actual answer.
The universe is as real as u perceive it in the state is presently in. What one thinks is irrational may very well be plausible to another, be it now or in certain unique states in said observation. As beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as is crazy is in the mind of the perceiver. Who's to say alien races have had our similar order and way of life on our world, we just have our time under the sun and somewhere there's a collective information race of beings ready to share that information when we are ready to understand it. Maybe that nothing that we emerged from was something we couldn't observe, is just right around a light curve we have yet to see.
Amen! Fantastic video! Perfect for 4/20!! I like the word "substrate" here. The "Ether" hypothesis may have been shot down already, but I can't help but think that there should be some type of "canvas"/substrate, upon which this all plays out. Hmmm, how is it possible for information to be expressed, if nothing else exists? The substrate would have to be considered into the calculations, still leaving "nothing" upon which everything is supposed to play out... Happy 4/20!
Maybe stuff doesn't make sense because God painted himself into the corner.
Lets go humanity! We all most got it!
Realism isn't just something that "serves science well", it is a fundamental, basic assumption of science, and logic, and indeed the basic notion that there's any point to taking an action (if your bed isn't real, there's no reason to get out of it in the morning). This, at the ground level, is the reason why the Copenhagen interpretation and the post-modernist movement in modern science are bunk. They are fundamentally contradictory to the very notions being pursued.
He's a bad narrator, breaking sentences where they shouldn't be. It makes a little difficult to understand
Yet another episode that sounds like we are in a simulation. Quantum mechanics sounds awfully like our programmer at least used lazy evaluation to make our simulation scalable.
I didn't understand anything he was trying to tell us.
So this theory says the reality we play in isn't Wordle, but Absurdle?
This is what I've been saying for years now. I refer to it as Retrocausality.
Is existence and nonexistence a false dichotomy under this definition of existing? Because if its based on both the observer and observed its basically asserting existance needs discovery; without an observer it would essentially be nonexistent. I believe this would be fallacy of excluded middle, there has to be the possibility of something existing but never observed. I negate time here and assume whatever will be observed is essentially existence
This all looks like religion to me, not science. It would help if anthropic physicists would learn something about natural selection and neuroscience.
4:35 Hey, on the right, is that Sabine Hossenfelder?
I think Feynman was right.
Was this episode made specifically to blow the minds of anyone celebrating the holiday?
If the more energy a wave gets, it turns into a particle - then if electrons act as a wave when not observed, but when observed they turn into a solid state, just like the triple point if water (solid, liquid & gas) then possibly observing the light waves adds energy and forms it into a particle which then acts as matter. The electrons are possibly at the crucial double point between wave & matter. This would mean that each individual has this ‘light energy’ which adds energy into the observed waves. That means each of us is creating energy, like a singularity. Space time is like a cone, we each have a ‘cone of influence’ based on our trajectory. If black holes act as a cone, with a center point & our future acts as a cone - inverse a cone backwards (our past), then weren’t we kind of like walking black holes? 🤨  GOD (I AM) gave us free will to move freely & make our own individual choices - that would mean we ourselves are not this wave which only has forces which change it’s direction based upon equal & opposite reactions (an automoton) - but we are something more.  God’s Quantum Physics & His Love (Light Waves - Frequencies - Fields - Black Holes - White Holes) https://youtu.be/PuoOEvOGAV0
Oh no man, this one really blew my mind
Einstein was wise enough NOT to dismiss our creator.  The universe is too perfect for chance to create it.
Is that really not Captain America's shield in the thumbnail?
galaxy game should be more complex 1 positive answer 2 negative answer 3 positive question negative answer 4 negative question positive answer 5 positive qestion but negative answer though it positive 6 negative quetion but positive answer thogh it negative answer that is more nature humanity like question. TRUE or FALSE???
Matt looks a lot older and frailer here lately. I hope he is okay!
Observation in these circumstances, unless something has changed, isn't the same as observing a bird through binoculars or looking at the stars through a telescope. In physics / quantum physics / microbiology etc you are interacting with what you are looking at with an electron microscope or whatever they have that's even more powerful now, I'm way behind on it. It's not true casual "observation", by being able to observe these things you have to interact with it and therefore change what it's "natural" state is. It's always misrepresented this way which is pretty disappointing
Probably.
So if we meet aliens from deep space are they just us in the future ?
It all makes sense if we are in a simulation. The "fact after observation" mechanism is just the clever way of saving some simulation power. Don't render the parts nobody can see.
What I would like to see is an appearance at the APEC.
The universe, Milky Way, solar system, and Earth all had to evolve until conscious beings could emerge. That establishes the physical baseline of physical reality. It's real and it does plenty without being observed.  The problem, it seems, is that consciousness may not be what we think it is.  That is, it's not an outlier phenomenon but part of a continuum of reactivity, ignoble as that sounds.  Consciousness is just a meta reflex, consisting of numerous reflexes with strong feedback mechanisms.  Similarly. those reflexes themselves are meta chemical reactions, consisting of complex biochemistry with feedback loops.    Chemical reactions, reflexes and consciousness clearly don't lie on a single spectrum of reactivity, but multiple.  There a spectrum ranging from the least reactive entities (dark matter?) to the most reactive (antimatter). Life forms would comprise a range somewhere in between those extremes.   There's a range from the most specifically reactive entities, arguably neutrinos, to the most generally reactive, which would be antimatter again. There'd also be the most rigid reactions, such as on an atomic scale through to the most flexible, where life forms would (probably) lie at the other extreme.
Topic request: take this "it from bit" idea further and explore how it relates to Stephen Wolfram's works!  I think his ideas deserve a more impartial presentation than he seems capable of producing. 😅
First
I'm pretty sure that there is a true reality we just don't know what the reality is until we measure it. I don't understand why there would be reason to think otherwise. The cat isn't both alive and dead, it is one or the other but you just don't know which.
My long
As I was watching this video I couldn’t help but relate a dream unfolding to the idea that our entangled consciousnesses unfold  together, creating an increasingly complex system where everything previously measured and agreed upon must be true, and every new discovery is just a result of our collective intelligences agreeing on any random outcome that is possible according to previous measurement.
I asked a friend of mine to ask his 2 alien statues, what is dark energy and where does it come from? He told me the next day they said from a certain planet starting with U , I can only agree since no one knows what dark energy is, much the same as quantum stuff I suspect!  Perhaps people should look at Cambridge University studies that show that Australian Aborigines languages are only 4000 years old, and massive amounts of vegetation suddenly disappeared from the Sahara around 4500 years ago, and look at the work of scholars who say what’s theory and what’s not, Michael J Oard, Kurt Wise, Steve Austin and Andrew Snelling!  I guess I didn’t write these comments, they spontaneously appeared!
Garbage. If you take the human observer out of it all, the Universe will still do what it does. Light will still have duality etc. particles observe each other without human baloney. Radim fluctuations provide for the catalyst of all evolution via mutations. Problem with our science still thinks everything revolves around us. We have not moved much since Copernicus😞
Also, I feel like the whole argument of non-realism is pedantic. Of course you need an observer in order for an observation to made, and of course information will be unknowable BEFORE it is measured.
Is there a reason why the space time channel became so "woke" all of a sudden? whenever you mention for example let's say a scientist, you suddenly show some random black character with a big afro making cooky faces, theres absolutely no point in doing that, you didn't have characters like that before so why are you doing it now, in almost every episode? it's nauseating and frankly, a lot of people are going to unsubscribe from this show because of it. Stop with the leftist garbage already! we see enough of it everywhere else now!
All of these vain imaginations and yet you can't believe in a Creator.
So basically the universe is like my DMing style, just wing it based on what the players do.
If this isn’t an argument that we’re in a simulation I don’t know what is
I would like very detalised episode about paths. Like double split. There are many videos, but i really mean nitpicky detalised. Like, is result same with detector before splits and without. With one and both slit detectors. Part of back wall(whatever it counts) being detector. How slit size and material thickness and composition affects results. Is detectors also letting fotons further and they build wave up again? How different mediums like vacuum and air differs. And so on. Possibly not even slits, but just very narrow wire. I want to know how everything changes result. Make our knowledge filled so we dont assume wrong things.
What if the reason we counted backwards B.D/B.C was because that's how far we manage to get that time frame so after big cataclysm the years are counted backwards so that we can see how far we get this time around, so now that we are counting forward after A.D/A.C this is to see how far we get to go forward without self destruction or cataclysm...essentially why did they count backwards leading to the year 0???
2:24   Can someone tell me who this person is that keeps appearing in the videos.      It seems to be some kind of running inside joke that I'm not privy to,  and I'd like to be part of the 'cool kids' of this channel. _Thank You_
If the universe creates itself and this process repeats infinitely, then at some point in the infinite future, and given a finite number of atoms, it would have to recreate itself in the exact form it exists today.  The answer to the question of what happens after I die, may be that your are born again to the same life in a future creation of the universe.  Given that you are not observing time and experience no passage of time, this would seem instantaneous from your perspective.
Why can't the universe be a black hole by the same process that makes the ones we can see? The amount of empty space may only appear vast because we live within an enormous amount of spacetime swallowed up by it.
LFG
Always wondered why God made angels and man.
Easy: Reality exists outside of humanity but regardless of how intelligent any scientist or group thereof considers themselves, they still, at the end of the day, fall into the same trap of ego that "humans are special" that most religions do.  These are only "hard problems" in that realizing the true reality forces humans to recognize that no, we're not any more special than any other entity, living thing, or even chemical process in the universe; no matter how advanced our technology is and how badly we want to use that to claim we are 'special'. Most of these questions are just scientists doing the same bs that religious folk do and pretending that it's somehow different because it has different terms.
Who are those people in the cutouts they use in all their videos and why do they have to have those stupid expressions?
Ah, Spinoza. God is a self-causing substance.
I would love a video about Gaia Theory and Collective Consciousness. They work well together to explain "who's bit?" it's "our bit."
I'll never like the idea that the choice of measurement affects the universe and the outcome of the experiment.  What happens should happen regardless of whether it is measured or how it it is measured.  Basically, measuring something should not create reality.  Which probably explains why I dislike the Anthropic Principle also, which to me is a philosophical qidea, not a scientific.
this is pushing close to the idea, that an entity, out side the universe, is looking in, so that all the universe is seen, and as it see the universe, the universe is revealed in its way. AKA, God. i think space time, almost ended ( or maybe started) an argument. lol
Reminds me of the ctmu logo thing
Y'all are always spoiling my fun reminding me that consciousness can't turn quantum mechanics into magic.  I just want Toaru-verse esper powers.  Is that too much to ask?
Maybe consciousness does create or shape universe and this is why the Axis of evil is a thing.
Could we construct a rectenna that is sensitive to the wavelengths of light emitted by the sun to convert solar energy into electricity? Taking advantage of the wave-like properties of light as opposed to solar panels which treat light as a particle.
I know nothing about how mirrors and beam splitters work, so I'm curious how we know they have zero impact on the preferred path of a photon. You would get the same result in the double splitter experiment (all positions in 1 detector) if the choice of path through the first splitter forces a certain state of the photon, which is flipped by the mirror, thus enforcing the opposite path through the second splitter. How has this been ruled out?
I would like to know more about Ken shoulders and exotic vacuum objects
i have two questions: 1) does the fact that we can only describe back to 10^-32s (or whatever fraction of a second) mean the universe's zero point is actually at a point we can't define?  2) who is that scientist you guy use for all the animations??
I disagree wirh Feyman. Physics and philosophy are unseparable.
Reminds me of quantum Darwinism and the Novakov self-consistency principle.
At every moment, time itself is quantum. The quark itself could not be the size it is, in this universe, unless time has its minimum.
Reminds me of Wittgenstein’s word games. Reality exists between the subject and observer, much like how meaning exists not in the words but in the conversation between the speaker and listener.
So if we all stop observing the universe then start observing following different lines of questioning can we get different physics?
Can anyone repost the survey link for me pls?
Or is it just another way to make ourselves the center of the universe again
Blah blah - YouTube junk
Of course this is all just conjecture, the real physicits are the Feinmans, but Im happy to learn that I am a student of Wheelers. Consider this,  Dark energy as the potential energy difference, between the requisite mass of an object given its volume and the mass required for an object of the same volume to become a singularity; that is, to be connected to the graviton field.  If the graviton field is as I described in my previous comment a lattice in Minkosky space time on a 4 to 1 mapping from the event to the singularity that condenses entropy and onto a spherical Hilber curve then, there is nothing preventing this potential energy to be mapped itself to different vertex of the space time lattice; if anything it makes perfect sense that it were to occupy places that are "far from" veritces where actual singularities are exerting their influence.  And since there are more non singularity masses I the claim alone requests I think further investigation.
This reminds me of a Greg Egan novel. Don’t know the title in English; read it in high school.
I always found Schrodinger's cat to be a stupid thought experiment, because the cat would be the observer. You can substitute the cat with anything you want like a sensor that detects whether or not a particle decayed, but that in itself is a measurement. I don't think the double slit experiment gives different results because you walk out of the room, likewise, just because you put your measurement device in a box doesn't mean you're not taking a measurement, and therefore collapsing the wave function.
This all lines up with, and was my inspiration for, a planet-sized supercomputer that was designed to alter its perception of reality in its entirety down to the quantum level in order to change things in it. The ultra-advanced humanity that created this machine made a critical error in attempting to use it to see into the past, accidentally paradoxing themselves out of existence. To prevent the paradox from destroying the entire multiverse, the machine spontaneously became self aware, and created a kind of bubble containing a finite stack of very weird alternate realities. Humanity became a lot less peaceful and capable, the planets got weirder, and critically, humans could no longer be sapient, sane, immortal, use (effectively magic), and be psionic. Some people could be some of those things, but be not all of them at once.   The plot of the story, played out in GURPS as a game and also in various later writing and such, that two faction ended up emerging with the ultimate goal of "fixing" things using diametrically opposed methods. One was religiously genocidal, believing that they needed to collapse them back together and kill everything not themselves, the other pro-humanity, believing that being united for the common good was the only way to prevent human extinction (though they could be very heavy handed about it) and wanted to stop the other guys. I love gray-and-gray morality and that was the whole purpose of the game, since my friends had played so much D&D that they saw everything on a good-evil spectrum.   Ultimately the machine was holding all of this in a bubble in order to close the temporal loop and collapse the wave function so that the machine was either created or not created. If the homicidal zealots won, all of the universes inside the bubble except one would vanish and the machine would be ultimately created and be controlled by them, allowing the remaining universe to be re-integrated into the multiverse. If the pro-human faction won, then the machine would be ultimately created by a mish-mash of universes being guided together under a powerful semi-immortal, allowing all of the universes in the bubble to be integrated into the multiverse. Both leaders were alternates of the same person. He was literally the answer to a physics problem. Once the machine was created and could initiate the whole event itself, it would close the loop and fix the problem.
Not that I can claim to understand Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy, but this video reminds me very strongly of what I had read of it, maybe you could do a video on him and his contemporaries?  🥳
I wish i could watch one episode without being completely confused by the end... just one. Great stuff!
Shut Up and Calculate… yeah… I like that approach.
There’s an app for that.
The Universe holds more answers then questions we will ever think to ask.
Why do people think that they are a separate process from the process of the universe itself?  It’s not that consciousness effects matter or that matter effects consciousness, it’s all the same process.  The problem is that people think the world is made of separate parts simply because they have mentally drawn lines around patterns (or rather adopted the lines and mistaken them for the real world) cutting these patterns off from the absolute pattern in order to label them, then they delude themselves into thinking the label is the actual thing itself, as if there are actually separate things out there, there isn’t, there is no out there. The measurement, the labelling, it’s a tool, people right now are mistaking their rock rubbings for reality itself, the rock is the reality, not the rubbing you made on a piece of paper.  Labelling the world is the simplest measurement, this is where the illusion comes from, the menu is mistaken for the meal, the signpost for the destination. We say that the world “out there” is in a superposition, an uncertainty, because we don’t know, we are uncertain, so of course “out there” will reflect this because there is no out there. That which you measure and observe is you. You wouldn’t measure your coffee table in centimetres and then claim it’s made out of centimetres and yet that’s what we do.  People don’t see this, you who is reading this most likely doesn’t see it, because you don’t identify with the whole that you are, you attach yourself to certain labels, the issue that I spoke about in the first and simplest form of measurement, mistaking the tool for the real thing. Then you believe yourself to be these imaginary labels and distinctions and think there’s a separate universe to measure.  This is all a grand dream and we are hosts of THE self. The self people think they are are nothing but an accumulation of adopted labels, people don’t think about it because they don’t realise they’re mistaken. But if someone was to truly examine themselves they would find out that the person they thought they were is as real as Harry Potter and then hopefully realise they are still here to realise that and then see their true identity as the universe itself having an experience of itself.  We are a singular process, all divisions are created in the mind.  “This all sounds a little bit mystical, wheeler wasn’t saying that conscious minds had direct power over reality”   But conscious minds are not separate from reality, there’s not you and then reality, there is just reality, I hope science can get over this fear of “the mystical” because science is just a mystical thing that we’ve become so accustomed to that it’s been demystified, so we think “this is reality and this isn’t”, it’s all in your perspective. Getting to comfortable in your labels and language causes you to get further drawn into the delusion of a separate existence.  I hope you all have a great day ✌️
I’m curious, and finally asking. Who are the “paper” characters used during the examples?
I find the observer-centric view incredibly arrogant. As though consciousness is what causes the universe to fall into an absolute state. That would imply that the universe exists to provide a stable platform for conscious beings.   This is the exact type of thinking that led people to believe the Earth was the centre of all existence, for thousands of years.  I don't disregard quantum mechanics or the experiments. And I know people are doing the best with the information they have available. But I think our perspective needs to change. Our understanding of what we are seeing is not good enough... yet.
Long before an Observer can actually observe Superposition/entanglement, etc it's broken by the first particle interaction in the measuring device that itself consists of many particle interactions, so it's that first particle interactions that really 'force the observed particle to choose', and not an Observer distantly removed by the many steps of the measuring device, and I don't get why this is long sequence of events leading to a human Observer is always ignored when the human is last in the loop of a long line from the actual observation, when the only reason to do so is to disingenuously suggest consciousness affects the world around us.
man it's 4/20 and i was literally just thinking "how does anything even exist at all?"
This is so interesting, and now I have a bunch of questions that I don't even know how to pose... Like, if anything that isn't observed by an observer is also not real, wouldn't that also include (presumably) Universal constants? And so if two observers light-years away from each other observed the mass of the electron, and then met and compared results, would they have to agree and thus violate locality? Or would Wheeler argue that they could be different results, the Universe would just have to come up with a reason why two electrons can have different masses?  Actually, imagine two observers on either side of a star pointing their telescope at it. If locality is to be preserved, could one observe a blue star, and the other a red star? Or even no star at all? And so would the universe have to retcon why that's possible?  I'm trying to think of ways that the Universe would contradict itself, but it feels like it could just make special cases for anything. In fact, would questions like "Is the Universe local?" also be valid in this game of twenty questions? Or is it restricted to observables as defined in quantum mechanics? Help, my mind is mush
17:39 are you actually kidding me? This is amazing
I recall someone's famous words -" Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you” I trust his words implicitly and his authority.
The Taoists say precisely the same thing, that the present creates the past the way a boat creates the wake behind it by simply moving forward. It also seems their cosmology explains that it is the first moment of observation which takes the one thing that exists after nothingness, and divides it into two, observed and observer. That then creates a third. Here it gets difficult to describe, but maybe observation of that observer. That third thing then creates everything which exists. Note that it does not create that which does not exist.
I wonder if the quantum world might be non-linear (outside of time), and by observing it we bring it into the linear world. A little like a computer that renders our linear world only when needed.
The universe doesn't care that we exist, except the earth, which prefers that we didn't.
if a rock falls off a cliff, it finds out (observes) where the ground is when it hits it. That isn't to say that the rock is conscious, it just means that the universe is in a constant state of self-definition.
👍
all i know when every thing iz gone the big bang never happen to the big bang and another will happen the same
Topic to explore: Something basic, but I don't understand how quasars eject matter or energy into those ultra-powerful jets? I mean, they're black holes, and I thought nothing can escape a black hole. Or, maybe it's that nothing can escape a black hole unless it is traveling faster than the speed of light which is impossible?
was that "is it smaller than a breadbox" question a nod to the Ricky Gervais Office? haha brilliant if it was
Your physical body quite literally converts frequencies of photons into a complex 3 dimensional specific pattern of energy created by neurotransmitters and depolarization/polarization. Then something happens, it's interpreted as the color red. What?   Feels like these self operating biological machines of ours are tools to convert the crazy amount of physical information into these ultra precise energy patterns. In turn we interpret these energy patterns as colors, smell of cookies, the feeling of love, hate, pleasure, pain, heat, cold, etc.  Consciousness can experience this reality utilizing physical life forms, birds,cockroaches, humans, dogs, all forms of life to gain ultra unique perspectives of this physical reality.  It seems in the end, the purpose of life is simply to have an experience.  Of course the reality of this existence is unknown to any human being including me so all that stuff above is just word salad
Lol, Shrodinger may have been a realist, but he also said that "the sum total of consciousness in the universe is one".
God created the Big Bang.
Guys, I'm no scientist and I don't really understand physics, but I have a gut feeling, so please bear with me. It's not an answer to a paradox 😂🤣 it's just a strange question, that I hope you will help me with, but first I have to lay the background.  So... From what I understand the universe at it's core is just pure energy, but, when we observe it with our human brain we see only what it can process...the reality as we perceive it everyday. Now, we have microscopes that helps us see the micro world around us. Better, we can see even the nano world with the latest electron microscopes. On the other end we have telescopes that help us see the visible end of the universe. For me it seems like the universe is made of cycles... Cycle of the electron "around" the nucleus, cycle of cells, cycle of life, cycle of weather, cycle of planets in a star system , cycle of stars im the galaxy, cycle of galaxies in clusters, etc. My question is... Where or what is the burden from a cycle to another? Or..putting it in a simpler way... Where does an object finish and where starts the other?  I really don't understand what I'm talking about, but I'd really like an answer, or some new info 😊 btw, this question is from a dream I've made years ago, strange thing is that the answer was an object like 13 Mobius strips entangled. Just a dream, but the question stuck with me.. Where or what divide a thing from another
"information implies a 'thing' to 'know' that information": Does it, though? Really??? Seriously, if we're being philosophical about this, then let us reconsider fundamental premises:  If I have an apple, and you give me an apple, I am tempted to declare that I now have "two apples" - an "absolute and irrefutable mathematical fact" . However, my not-so-generous donor reminds me that I am simply "borrowing" his apple, and I now owe him an apple in the future; thereby, I have one of "my" apples and one of "their" apples, as opposed to having "two apples" of my own. If we are to presume that mathematics is a fundamental description of reality as opposed to a language with which to describe a relative observation, then this scenario cannot exist, and we have effectively disproven economic theory, and thus have invalidated the global economy. Might I respectfully suggest that the ever-brilliant Richard Feynmann was correct to remind everyone to focus on the observable and the calculable, in preference to arbitrary definition and abstraction? As recent years have especially proven, splitting hairs takes forever and yields only frustration and argument...  [ sips coffe cup ] Change My Mind! [ sips again ] ;-)
If the act of observing realizes the phenomena being observed, does observation itself need to be observed to realize itself? Does observation necessarily lead to a binary outcome or can one observe just a little? Is it possible for negative observation too, unrealizing the phenomena otherwise realized by observation such that no observation were made in the first place?
So Berkeleian Idealism, but it's pantheist
The more I listen to this stuff the more I think it's just gobbledygook. If the observer creates what we see as reality, then we should be able to control realty, like going faster than the speed of light. In fact, why would there be limits to anything? It seems to me that, when we observe we should at times see incredible things, yet we always see the mundane with very few non-quantum exceptions. There must be a reality without observation or ocassionally we would see unbelievable things. The universe as reality would be in constant flux. If reality was based on observation there would be no universe as there would have been no one to observe it's creation (sorry for using THAT word). Don't tell us observers in the future created it as the future doesn't exist, or couldn't without a universe to create it. It all sounds like a bad Star Trek time travel episode. If we create reality by the act of observing it, then real magic should be a real thing.
I can feel Matt's fear of Sabine in this video
This video topic reminded me of Dean Radin's 2008-2016 research into conscious thought having an impact on the results of a closed double slit experiment, along with many other studies of comparable nature. You can find a presentation on the findings in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRSBaq3vAeY. A recent meta-analysis of over 1,000 relevant published experiments of a similar type showed that each of five classes of psychophysical interaction studies resulted in small magnitude but statistically significant, repeatable outcomes (Cardeña, 2018). What are your thoughts on this?
Imagine we are at the beach. We see the same particles arranged into the same structures. The same protons, neutrons and electrons arranged in to same atoms, molecules and compounds following the same laws of chemistry. We see the same sand, the same  water, the same sky. We see the same clouds and the same boat on the horizon. We see the same waves traveling through the water following the same laws of physics. We see photons coming from the same sun, traveling to our eyes at the same speed, entering our eyes the same way. Signals move up our optic nerve the same way and are processed by our brain the same way because our biology is the same. But when you look at that beach, how you see it, that is to say what you think and feel when looking at it, is completely unique to you. In many ways this is the meaning of life. For each of us to observe the exact same universe but to never see it quiet the same as anyone else. I think the universe creates itself for life to observe and experience.
Not simulated OR aliens. He didn't say if it was simulated AND aliens. Simulated aliens sounds pretty likely.
I kept thinking throughout the discussion about the rules making up the observations in the universe that it feels like how a computer program works.  Is this theory aligned with the Universe as a simulation idea or is am I reading into it too much?
I think you created youre own opinion👏💪
The universe does not create itself. I DO.
I wonder if this relates to wolframs work
If you take psilocybin it explains exactly what you're talking about in perfect unmistakeable detail
i wasnt sure if this whole thing was a meme
Many atheists will say, if you want to understand reality as I know it, read the bible.  I have this feeling that many theists might recommend listening to this guy to understand their worldview.
14:04 genius interpretation. PBS really was made possible by viewers like you all along.
Create its self? LoL, materialist.
Among the 20 questions, I beg a consistent explanation of the double slit experiment with Sabine.
I think the cleanest view is that "collapse" is emergent from the web of entangled particles that make up the matter in the universe.  Once there's enough particles whose wave functions are entangled, they constrain the wave functions of all the other entangled particles to the very narrow wave function that we associate with a classical piece of matter.
Oh, now it's called the search for the "substrate", don't philosophers do that? Those beast!
The use of physicists in examples are simply the best! I want to meet both so bad!
When reading about quantum foundations, it's always amazing to me that the physicists in the west didn't read late Engels. It doesn't solve the issue, but as it did for the biologists of the time, it sure makes things clearer.
What if to understand the universe We must destroy it  Would you want to know?  What if the universe had an ultimate catch 22   You cannot know, and if you did, it would cause the end of it   Very much like collapsing a wave function to understand it
Long before an Observer can actually observe Superposition/entanglement, etc it's broken by a particle interaction in a measuring device that itself consists of many particle interactions, so it's those first particle interactions that really 'force the observed particle to choose', and not an Observer distantly removed by the many steps of the measuring device, and I don't get why this is long sequence of events leading to a human Observer is always ignored when the human is last in the loop of a long line from the actual observation.
If someone thinks of something then it must exist somewhere.  Whether it's in the Universe somewhere or in the person's mind.
Can you please put "quantum" in the video titles? I wouldn't have wasted my time on this if I knew it would be full of philosophy instead of science.
Two non-living particles interacting can be considered a measurement, in other words an “observation” – with no consciousness or even life needed. Looking at it that way is a game changer.
Damn dude. Good questions into the 5th dimension in your opening remarks.
Do we need the substrate to explain observations? If not, then is the quest for the substrate simply a crusade to preserve our preferred ideas about the Universe?
it observes itself. in a way, that creates it.
When you ask what the substrate of reality is made out of, you remind me of the book by Wilbert Smith called the new science. It seems to cover what this video is about pretty well. It did take me a few times of reading it and taking notes before it made sense
This video gives fodder for the "we live in a simulation" people. I don't want to say they're right or they're wrong but it sounds almost like a simulation which does not calculate certain variables until they are needed.
As a Buddhist, I struggle with the idea of interdependent origination.  It seems to imply that there is no substrate to phenomena and that everything is relational.  So, it is kind of comforting to know that scientists are struggling in similar ways as well.  :)
So this video was only created because I watched it?
What?
Seriously, pause the video at around 5:50, before the graphic of the photon experiment, and just let what he's been saying sink in.
why black scientist in your animation? stop pushing diversity.
"Today I want to begin a discussion of a family of quantum interpretations which say that the universe exists not so much in physical particles and quantum fields, nor solely in the mind of the observer, but rather in the interaction of the two." That's Hegelian stuff right there...
TLDR; complete nonsense.
oh boy
My brain hurts 😫 🧠
Suppose actualizing a reality is analogized by Maxwell's Demon, it's application of information via some energy (to open and close a port). The result is accumulation of chosen (yes or no options) passages of molecules which vary in velocity. Realizing such a universe is an action/project of reducing entropy. Without doing anything, the default is normal increasing entropy, ie. inert deadness. Thus the old saying the most abundant component of the universe is unknowing (stupidity).
If you take entropy to it's extreme and you get a completely homogenous universe, does that mean that the information the universe once contained in it's un-even state is now essentially lost because you cannot discern information from a completely homogenous universe? If so, what's happening to conservation of information?
First, remember that life is a thought model. Second, think about the fact that it is about specifying and therefore requesting. Third, think about finding and choosing the right specs to fulfill healthy lives for everyone.
So once something moves beyond the cosmic event horizon, it's no longer under any obligation to maintain consistency with our observational viewpoint in spacetime, right? Meaning it essentially returns to a state of superposition from our perspective? If that's the case, wouldn't it mean that to a distant enough observer, the big bang and even the history of the universe could look completely different and still be self-consistent without breaking consistency with our observations, since they are beyond our observational limits and in a state of superposition relative to us?
That was a stone trip. I’m high
😮😅😂😢 😊 ok so, I know I'm not the only one who can understand the truth of this place known as Life 🧬.. absolutely in No Way has there ever been Before Now, or even after Now, (A MOTION that IS IN AN ACT OF BEING EXPRESSED 4 EXPERIENCE)..  THE ACTIONS CHANGE REALITY.  W/ EVERY MOTION THAT IS MADE..  EVERY BEING, EXPERIENCES THE MOTIONS OF THE WORLD AND ITS ACTIONS.  THEN WE, THE REVOLUTIONARY BEINGS HERE WITH THE MOTIONS THAT ARE HERE W/ US, REFLECT OUR OWN WAYS TO WHAT WE EXPERIENCE..  ✡️💛🧬☠️☯️♾️ OH AND ITS NIGHT SKY ALWAYS AND FOREVER.. NOT TIME
sounds like quantum blockchain
If the universe had a origin, which is to say a beginning, then no observation is necessary for the processes therein! (Or, who was observing the beginning) It is funny, when I was younger I thought the reason you can't, say fly, was because of a 'competing illusions' mechanism, where a single belief, when multiple observers are present, are overridden, and of course you drop like the observers 'knew" you would. To make any evolutionary breakthroughs of the mind, we really need the thing that never runs out but no one ever has enough of...TIME! d>_0b
Esoteric. Amazing.
Who asked the question that brought the other into existence first: the chicken or the egg?
I really enjoy looking at this concept from Wheeler’s thoughts on self-reference and existence being binary “information theoretic” in origin, especially with the idea of like a feedback loop. I mean at its base a human control system is just a transfer function describing system reactions to all potential inputs, but can be applied to pretty much all physics in cases like the laplace transform. At its base, what is consciousness, other than awareness of your own awareness (or like the attention schema theory, your attention creating a process of control over its own attention). Could a self-referential control system such as that exist at a fundamental level of the universe? Idk my quantum mechanics is shakey at best, but with binary opposites like charge seamingly very consistent in physical dynamics and being entirely relational to each other, or self referential (negative or positive only makes sense when reference the opposite, a positive charge in a neutral universe has no meaning), could some fundamental binary be expressed in a physical way? Like in the case of an extremely basic transfer function governing outputs based on all possible interactions, the inverse of that transfer function simply swaps the input and output functions. Could there be a way to connect opposing “inverse” transfer functions that feed each other’s interactions in a self-referential way to produce a complex dynamic universe? With the gains made in chaos theory, especially the self-referential aspects of chaos theory, this could be made the case. Even though the individual functions themselves would be linear, taking the binary system as a whole would create non-linearity (probably-maybe?) and allow a chaotic system to develop, which itself has been shown to at least at some level mirror the physical dynamics of the universe (cellular automata). What if the chaotic undecidability generated from those non-linear binary interactions would generate dynamics similar to something like the undecidability within a wave function? And if so, what if that undecidability is “collapsed” upon via the self-referential development of the system itself, aka its conscious choice? Instead of theories like a universal observer or infinite universes, wouldn’t it be more simple to think of something like consciousness as MORE fundamental than complex dynamic order, and the collapse can, at some level be tied to the totality of the interaction collapsing itself? Idk, interesting ideas to explore. In my head I have an infinite potentiality of things I could do in my life, all being as theoretically equally real as all others, the thing I actually do is just one of those potentialities. The conscious potential thought must precede the action, maybe physics works in the same way. Maybe the arrogant thought that human consciousness is special and unique in this universe is just that, arrogant.
This hypothesis reminds me of event-sourcing and the role of the materialized view as depending on the ordering of applied events. Also seemingly reminiscent of Wolfram's ideas around automata and discrete rulesets acting on bits.
If it works and it's coherent it doesn't matter if we're Inside a computer, a Tamagotchi or the dream of an entity. I wouldn't stress too much on the significance of the concept of "real"
Physics and philosophy need each other
Good to know that we're not plummeting toward the singularity of a black hole.
This reminds me of the question of weather colors existed before we had a word for them.
I've always wondered, who is the scientist that appears at 2:24? And who's the new scientist that appears at 2:38?
Open question(?) How do you know that multiple observers got the same observation?
Multiverse made simple: There is a universe, no matter how improbable, where I am good at Elden Ring.
What if causality is actually flowing backwards and it's observations that define history.
Time reversed causality if real could explain quantum effects.  It is similar to the ideas discussed in this episode.  A PBS spacetime episode in the future causes a certain amount of episode survey questions to be answered in a certain way today to bring itself into existence.  Taken to the extreme a single event in the future causes the universe to be created in our past.  Quantum spooky action at a distance is only looks strange looking forward in time.   Looking backwards in time it is the only set of conditions that arrived at the end point.  Things have an end point that is never measured appears as waves like the double slit experiment.
The answer is so easy 'Let there be light'!
I don't get why all this problems, the universe exist, it is. Not because we see it. I think this philosophy convulsing is unnecessary.
Imagine many theologians, including LDS, Jewish, and many other Christian and non-Christian ones discussing this. Scientists familiar with this and similar areas discussing (assuming that there is a Supreme Creater) what is the nature of One is. Mixing science and religion.
I like "Shut up and calculate" better....
I created the universe ✨️!  -Flying Spaghetti Monster 👻    😶
Look at this from a baby's point of view.
A good day to post this one ;)
“There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”  ― Douglas Adams, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (part of the Hitchiker's Guide to the Universe Series)
I have a question (and a statement as well). First of all, I would like to say that I am glad that you are talking about these ideas in this video. I am tired of hearing about mystical philosophical positions be written off as pseudoscience and "woo" (whatever that means). Do you think that the mainstream Scientific community should be more open to some of these mystical philosophies of quantum mechanics? (not necessarily accepting them, but perhaps admitting the possibility that they could be correct) The philosophy that quantum behavior could have something to do with the mind of the observer, it is often associated by many in the scientific community with con artists trying to sell some books about meditation curing cancer, and I find this to be a problematic view by these people in the scientific community, because they could just state the position that the observer's mind _could_ have something to do with it, while also stating that there is no evidence that meditation cures cancer.  And another question: What do you think about Panpsychism? This is another idea that gets a lot of hate from the mainstream physics community, but I've been thinking about it a lot recently. What if each particle had a kind of proto-consciousness, and had a sort of "choice" of what state that it was in?
Does the Cat know if it is alive or dead?
I think he was on the money when he said observation is simply interaction, after all to make any observation in an experiment you have to introduce an interaction between the observed particle and the observing apparatus. However he takes that idea in the wrong direction I think, instead of viewing how the apparatus affects the observed particle's behavior and state, he decides the particle somehow has an effect on the apparatus (and by extension those that use the apparatus) and decides what the apparatus will measure (the state collapse), which also dictates the apparatus' state.
Reality is something, in which, when you stop believing in it doesn't go away. so the universe might be a simulation, if it is, then it is the only reality that exists to us.
Lmao does he have hickies this vid 😂☠️
I'm not a physicist and there are a lot of things I lack the understanding of, but I always thought the vision of the universe being non-realistic was absurd. We, as observers, process the information we receive from outside in different ways, like how our brains perceive the phenomenon of light, or sound, but those phenomena occurs independently of our observation, when exactly do we intervene in the pressure changes in the atmosphere at the moment we process that event as "sound"? We are completely irrelevant to that (of course s I'm not talking about the pressure changes we make with our movements). I'm aware here my definition of "observer" is extremely specific, it being a "human", or an "animal" or whatever living being that interacts and process the data it gets from the physical world, and the concept of "observer" which is being talking about in this context it's a lot more complex and general. I also know I'm talking about the macro-world which is not what is being discussed here but here is a thought regarding that matter, and I will mix up some concepts (again, I'm fairly ignorant in all this matter). I remember you mentioned in a video that the "laplace demon" cannot exist because the particle are in a state of superposition and therefore it's not possible to determine their state prima facie, but if this is so, wouldn't that contradict causality? My reasoning is this: if the universe is really stochastic, how can it be so coherent? (the existence of the fundamental forces and their interactions, etc). I know about the collapse of the wavefunction (although I have a poor understanding of it) but does it completely resolves the problem I just pointed out? Isn't it possible that we just don't completely understand what is really going on at the quantum level and that is why we need to explain it in a probabilistic way? (I always saw the probability as the way to describe things we are unable to, mostly because of our impossibility to get the state of all variables involved and their interactions). Sorry for this long comment, I know it's a chore to read but this I have had these questions since a long time. Also sorry for bringing up the discussion between determinism vs indeterminism but I thought it was somewhat relevant for the case of the  observer "vs" reality. Thank you.
engagement for the algorithm.
Being a big fan of both science and philosophy, these episodes make me so happy. I wish I could have learned more about this in high school. Then the intrinsic uncertainty of the Universe wouldn’t have felt so problematic, but rather the natural state of things.
This sounds suspiciously like video games where objects don't get rendered unless someone observes them.
I feel that observation/measurement, observer, and observed would all be better expressed as interaction, interactor, and interacted.  The first set of words all carry connotations of an actor, which I think is where the problem of "consciousness causes reality" woowoo creeps in. I feel that "interaction" etc has better passive overtones, allowing an easier understanding of the concepts.  But I really lost track of all this, like, 200+ episodes ago...
This episode reminded me, strongly, of when I first read Wittgenstein's 'On Certainty'--that we enter into a language game to build shared understanding (agreement) of a thing. Philosophical skepticism, then, actually can be addressed. To suggest that a "reality" may emerge from us course-correcting our way toward a shared 'something' via our inquiries makes sense. That path is legitimate when facing genuinely 'wicked' and complex problems.
I guess this is the closest to what my interpretation of reality would be.
I suggest more episodes on neutron stars
Interferometer experiment results along with double slit experiments seem to ignore the fact that the photon is traveling at the speed of photons. And when you mimic the double slit with electrons or atoms, they’re not exactly doing 55mph. They’re traveling through time at a radically different rate and I don’t personally think the interpretation of these things means the observation dictates the result. It means we can’t see them moving in our time in a way that makes sense, and we may never.
One thing I have always wondered about modifications to the double slit experiment, like your mirror proposition, is if the ENTIRE progress of the photon from place to place is observed, down to the tiniest possible slices of time, so that no action can be undertaken by the photon that escapes notice, so that at every stage, every reflective or refractive instance and all the instants between, everything that can be known about that photon is known, what would the result of THAT be?
Close. This scenario would only apply to people who just underwent radical antibiotic treatment and were then put in a sterile cell for solitary confinement. More likely you, other perceiving entities you regularly communicate with and other perceiving entities that regularly perceive you and your immediate environment would negotiate a consensus answer to these questions and the multiverse will let them proceed along quantized universes within the multiverse. Moreover, as these perceiving entities are similarly entangled with other spheres of mutual perception, these resulting universes, although distinct and different from each other, can and will interfere and overlap. This used to be called the WSOGMM (whole sort of general mish mash) in the late seventies.
I love when scientists use the word “woo.”  I miss James Randi so much.
Materialist reductionism is unhinged... literally. Un-hinged, de-coupled, from God, from Source, from Centre, from the One, from Love, from Coherence, from the supratranscendent, unnamable, absolute ground and coördination of reality.
Clearly this point to the fact that everything is predetermined. The act of measuring a process/system was determined by the process/system being measured. Therefore the was only ever one possible outcome and its that's which was predetermined.
Doesn't this sort of implies that the universe itself is some sort of simulation? The framework (rules, laws, initial conditions, constraints etc) is there, pre-written.  An event triggers its execution which result in us, the simulated beings in it, been aware of it.
The biggest mistake people make when describing and/or interpreting "observed" is (incorrectly) thinking that "observe" = "look at with your eyes." This has led to some silly conclusions that have made their way into pop culture. The _correct_ definition "observe" is measuring. How do we measure things so small? We need detectors of some sort. How do these detectors work? They use light. The energy of the light we use to measure these things actually affects the system we're trying to measure.
The universe is spinning…
Great day to publish this
QUANTUM BAYESIANISM PLEASE
that thumbnail image is so 420-friendly lol
So the universe might be generated on the fly as a result of arbitrary answers to questions. On an unrelated note, please fill this survey of 8 questions to determine the way forward for our channel.
This episode kind of answers this but what is the definition of "observer"?
our universe lives in the matrix of an alien computer witch in turn exists in the authentic universe
Remember that everything you ever perceive only exists in your own mind, whether other objects or even your own body. You can see or hear or touch them as much as you like, and will indeed get a predictable result based on fixed laws of time flow. None the less you only interact with an image in your mind painted by those senses: There's no way of knowing what truly causes them, where it resides, how the system could be broken if the right means existed.
if interaction is observation, why does the interaction of the photon with the beam splitter not collapse the wavefunction?
we are in a superposition also... just because we are Humans doesn't mean we really are.... until we measure it.....or until a decision is made. this is gonna sound weird but we are forcing each other to be humans. some people dont like when things arent they way they're "supposed to be"
I've been telling people for 20 years since my first acid trip that the universe simply exists to answer the question of "what if the universe exists."
Oh my god Matt it's 4/20 you can't drop this sort of mind-twisting existential questioning!
This is wonderful information.  Are there any books you can recommend that cover Wheeler’s ideas and maybe those since?
The universe WAS created... By an intelligence.
so basically there are magical trolls everywhere where nobody is looking, as i already thought as a child
What put You in the Youniverse. Only perception can locate you. pretty selfish being the only thing in your local frame of reference.
I don't get it...
why are both of the cutout animated "scientists" are black people with messy hair?
Mind blown once more
Cogito Ergo Sum! If a universe is created but no one's around to observe it, has it been created..... and does it make a sound! :D
Hey man imagine if the universe like…imagined itself by playing twenty questions with you…like…whoooooaaa Anyway, happy 4/20, Spacetime.
It's never aliens until it's aliens.
Nope.  Moving on.
Seems like all of reality is hanging on whether a neutrino temporarily split of a photon. Does setting seeing up a neutrino detector in part of the DDC experiment change the result?
I love this channel.  Such a good, healthy escape from everything shitty going on.  Please keep up the good work.
In the game of reverse 20 questions, what if there are two pairs of participants-- two question/answer pairs. They independently go through the game and the same questions asked of each answerer, but each answerer answers the opposite of the other. Which reality is real? If the two questioners then get together and discuss their findings, which is the right answer/reality?
You say that the delayed choice experiment settles the question of the observer collapsing the wave function. But if the phase information is lost along the way then we see a classical state and there is no superposition that has to collapse. Shouldn’t we have some sort of natural decoherence that happens between the radioactive atom and the cat?
I feel the universe is building what we are observing. When we look out into the cosmos trying to find something we tend to find things we are looking for as well as things we don't expect.
In reality, there is no reality... this comment wasn't real until you just read it and made it real..
If you rephrase the negative 20 questions as the "questions" being interference between different components of the universal quantum wave function, and the "answers" being positive interference, it seems to me that it basically has to be true that the "real universe" is just whatever is left when all of the other possibilities have been removed by destructive interference.
Something I find people have difficulty with is that just as there are many possible futures, there are many pasts, all of which are completely consistent with all available information available in the present, all of which are relevant. Quantum theory speaks to this, however the concept of multiple pasts of equal validity is not well known or understood by the public. The present is a product, a construction of all possible pasts. The key is all possible pasts, all of which must be entirely consistent with the present. I suspect, although I am not fully convinced, that the present can be described as an interference pattern of all possible pasts upon the current physical universe combined. A combination of all possible assemblages of data that the Universe is composed of.  Time, and disorder as well, have a symmetry about the present. Physical laws are time symmetrical. The implications are both profound and fascinating.  I would enjoy some discussion re this and it's implications, although I understand comments here are usually superficial as the public is not comfortable with the subject material.  An interesting, although untestable hypothesis, is that as scientific knowledge and theory increases and becomes fully self-consistent, the Universe back - edits itself to become consistent with theory ie in paleolithic times  the magic of the shaman worked with the universe and the universe worked with it, and now the same is true as the universe works with the magic of electricity, rocket science and relativity. And as we prove to our self with our future sciences that something must be true, the universe will oblige and behave accordingly.
At this point, you might as well just call it "maia" and be done with it.
"Half way through you forget the thing you chose" ... so, me every day. I forget things mid sentence all the time.
The passage at 11:14 made me think of the the pathological version of Wordle, Absurdle, that tries to reveal as little information as possible about what the code word is as you make guesses. You can technically force the code word to be anything you want, as long as you _very_ carefully ask the exact right questions.  It's like the universe forms the most likely reality it can given the questions it has already answered.
If any of the multiversal models are accurate, then there must be a larger framework in which universes are born.
Why do good physicists go toward woo in their final years? Penrose seems to think he knows what’s inside a black hole and how the universe will end in cycles. Wheeler desperately wanted there to be meaning in being an observer. Why can’t they follow the science and stop speculating? Can we just ban all logos with eyeballs in them?
some believe that the instant the strangeness of the universe is understood it will instantly change into something even stranger than before ..  some theorize that this has already happened
The shrodingers cat is a bit of a stretch. In a card game like magic the gathering a top card is technically a land and a non land at the same time until i reveal it. The shuffling process made it all mixed up but shuffling can be deterministic if you watch it very closely. So it's me not paying enough attention made the deck of cards in quantum state, not the universe. So similarly it looks like particles are in a defined state from the start, it's just we're missing something.
why does archibald make a distinction between entangled particles and any other particle? arent they all in a superposition because they exist in a probability cloud until measured? or does a measurement result in an entanglement of 2 particles as a "side product" of creating information about the state of a position of a particle at the time of measurement, thus saying the entanglement of 2 particles means the same as saying to measure a property of a particle?
So if we combine the participatory universe with general relativity, is it possible that each "observer" (conscious or not), sits at the center of their own spacetime? Similar to a penrose light-cone, in that different observers can see different events occur at different times . . . What if, at near light speeds, their experiences truly are "decoupled" from one another, as if they are at the center of their own spacetimes? In this episode you basically say that there is no future, and the universe is constantly coming into being at the present. This sounds a lot like the present observer/measurement is collapsing the wave function of possible futures. It isn't much of a leap at all to say that we all have the ability to collapse our own wave functions, distinct from one another. The planet just happens to mostly agree on said collapses and events because we're all stuck here in Earth's gravity well. All our world lines are aligned by Earths gravity. But if one were to say, travel the universe at near light speeds, and then return, they would find themselves decoupled from Earth's spacetime with a time jump . . . One could extrapolate even further to suppose that this decoupling of unified spacetime in favor of local spacetimes could even allow for faster than light travel, without paradox . . . If you go back in time to kill your father, he may have the same DNA but it's not really your father, because you're in a completely different spacetime.
Did anybody watch this video if YouTube didn’t count the views?
"Scientists are fairly attached to the idea that the universe is real."   ded
...and again nothing new under the Sun after Parmenides!
But what is an observer, when said observer is made of the same stuff that it is observing?
This is the perfect Space Time episode to watch while smoking weed.
Maybe Spinoza was right: reality is a self-expressing self-signalling system!  Thank you, John Archibald Wheeler! i wonder if Einstein and his obsession with Spinoza's metaphysics would welcome this information-theoretic version of Spinozian metaphysics?
We feel centrifugal force. So does that mean rotation is not relative?
If you grew up believing that the colour green was actually called blue you would assume your assumption, and your reality, was factual and all other interpretations of that colour in the negative is wrong. Are you sure green is green?
So, reality is procedural?
The equivalence of interaction and observation makes so much sense to me.  But the concept of one superpositions particle interacting with another superpositions particle still feels like it has weird implications.  Like, interaction shouldn't be a complete definition of possibility. There should be "superinteractions." Whatever that means.  And that still doesn't explain wave function collapse. It's difficult to be satisfied with a probabilistic reality. I'm feel like there must be some fundamental determinant.  Whether that determinant qualifies as within the realm of science, or even exists, I don't know.
What if an advanced alien species believed in a participatory universe.  And so did we,who's would take presidence?

Who said, " energy is borrowed from the future, but it must be paid back in the future."?
Great breakdown
The video at first gives the impression the agent has free will but on close inspection shows exactly the opposite. What I will at every point in time I will it out of my Nature and my properties which I didn't chose before I was born for obvious reasons. I am what I am, I do as I am, the Universe is perfectly in conformity with what I am as I am a part of it. To the point there is flawless correlation not "participation".
What would happen if you took the thought experiment further and Alice’s answer would be based on the questions asked, but the person asking doesn’t know the answer hasn’t been made?
I give birth to myself 🤯
First time I've heard the second scientist waiting for the outcome of the first scientist while putting the first scientist into a superposition. Are we all in a state of superposition? What a mind spin.
why no one say universe it self have conciseness? and call it GOD...
No, the friend of the Schrödinger’s cat physicist does not “wait on” the result of the first unethical dead-cat experiment. As an English-speaking physicist who didn’t learn the language from internet rednecks posting vlogs from their pickup trucks, he waits FOR the result.  Not that he should wait for the result, since there is no actual experiment in which the results of life-or-death actions depend on quantum entanglement. The danger one faces when devising thought experiments is that they may correspond to no thinkable actual experiment. Not only can’t we conduct a cat-boxed experiment of this sort in actual labs, even if we were (evilly) inclined to do it, it’s hard to imagine circumstances in which entanglement could play such a part as the thought experiment suggests.  This is bad both for the thought experiment and for the interpretation it was intended to counter. The idea that nothing exists as such until we measure it - rather than nothing exists as we measure it until we measure it, which would be a more prudent formulation - has about the same status as the claim that no event occurred unless we have pictures. It’s good fodder for vlogs, but doesn’t carry much philosophical weight.  A more substantial physical idealism can be formulated, though the Bishop Berkeley of quantum idealism has yet to appear. Still, people like it when physicists attempt to do ontology. How else can we explain the popularity of the brain-dead anthropical principle among physicists and physics fanciers? Decades have passed since we heard we should shut up and calculate, and we have a buffet of half-cooked interpretations of quantum mechanics as an ontology starting point - which makes the persistence of the Bohr weak-tea version all the more curious. The examples we review in the video, however - including JAW’s - fail to make a much better case.  Bonus note: the double beam-split example tells us a very simple thing: observing a process changes it ever more the smaller the observed process is, with particle-level observations making definitive changes to them. At the level of vloggers and viewers, our observation is not immaterial, but it is not enough to define the vlogger or the vlog. Were we detecting single photons, the impact of our observation is enough to change the manner of transit, simply because observation requires interaction that is material to photons.  The doubled beam splitting tells us, yes, there is superposition, but no, our presence is not creating anything, our minds and choices do not create anything by their mere observational presence or interrogation. It’s the mechanisms of the observation and inquiry that have physical effects, in principle and practice. Our observation does not play a part in the “reality” of the situation except so far as we intervene to make things behave in certain ways. That is, this experiment tells us the opposite of what people insisting on quantum weirdness want it to tell us. The photon beam happily travels both paths until something funnels it this way or that or both - which way the photons go may or may not surprise us, but the change as change is entirely expected.
The universe is not rendered when it isn't being observed, in the same sense a video game doesn't render the parts of the map a player isn't looking at. These parts still "evolve" according to the rules of the game, very much like the universe evolve according to Schrodinger's equation.
thought by thought were getting back to Aristotle.
Hi , I was listening to the comments at the end of this episode and the mention of BlackHoles got me thinking about gravity and SpaceTime and this lead me to ponder on this . . .  If we believe in the Big Bang model of the Universe then we also accept that for this model to work it includes a very early  period of exponentially fast expansion . We also accept through our measurements that the Universe is over 14 billion years old . Now my thoughts are this , what if the early period of exponential expansion didn’t actually happen as quick as we assume ? . I say this because Gravity as we know is simply the warping of SpaceTime and Gravity effects the flow of time .  If the Universe went through a sudden expansion then this sudden expansion (or inflation) would itself be a warping of SpaceTime (Gravity) which would have a massive slow down effect to the flow of time .  So from our perspective we look out in to the Universe and say the Big Bang happened over 14 billion years ago , after a brief period of rapid expansion , But is it possible that from the Universes own perspective that due to the warping of SpaceTime this rapid expansion wasnt rapid at all and what we now see as a period of rapid expansion is infact just the effect that gravity has on time , the warping of SpaceTime during expansion caused time to tick more slowly , we now look in to the past with our own perspective of time and as such we perceive that a period of ‘slowed time’ is actually appearing to us as if the Universe expansion sped up in its expansion  (rapid inflation) . Or are my thoughts null and void because a ‘Universal perspective’ is an impossibility and only the view back in time is from our own physical perspective, and  as such is the only perspective that counts . Sorry I’m not very good at explanations so what I have written probably doesn’t make much sense , I guess what I’m asking is  could the Universe be 100 billion years old but from our own perspective this 100 billion years appears to us to be just over 14 billion years  but with a speeding up and slowing down of Universal expansion , after all we know that time isn’t a constant . If you have understood this post then maybe you could let me know if I have given you the perception that infact I am an idiot and then perhaps you could point out to me why I am an idiot - cos even idiots can learn lol 😂  Take Care . R .
The Universe is a CONSTRUCT; wake up and smell the photons...
This explains the experience/observation of having a hospital inject you with metal against your will while holding you down and shove you into an MRI machine to conduct their experiment... and then make a false diagnosis based on their observations... they really do affect the observed/victim in deep quantum ways.
the shredder's cat experience And all of the other ones you are talking about are all the same as if a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it doesn't make a sound and it does
I often view Your attempts at Jocularity as rather Juvenile, yet the Choice of this video's Title is simply SILLY. Kudos for excellent Science, yet trying to be the ELON MUSK of YouTube Science presentation detracts from Your appeal, as well as trustworthiness. To be honest I placed much more trust in Your PBS presenter predecessor. Your genuinely sharp, but Robin Williams You 'aint.
quantum mechanics always makes me feel like we still don't really understand anything about universe
You are awesome Matt and so very appreciated by me! Thank you and your team for making sense of SpaceTime!
Seems like negative 20 questions is more absurd than many worlds. Maybe Wheeler should've taken his student Everett a little more seriously.
Kinda sounds like a mereological argument. Kinda like asking if a chair would still exist, even if there would be no conscious mind to observe it. Of course, the matter this chair is made of would still exist, it doesnt depend on us...but would the "thing" that makes that clump of atoms into a chair still exist? As far as the universe is concerned, the chair is just part of it and doesnt really exist, it's just an arrangement of matter, there is no real reason to separate the chairs atoms from the atoms in the air around it, or from the atom of the house 3 miles away, or the atom of the andromeda galaxy, it's only the mind that makes a somewhat random but practical (for us) distinction. So, are we just answering questions of concepts that we made up? I honestly don't know.
Please would you explain force particles?
Great episode , very well explained. Thank you. If you were to do more episodes on the planck length, negative temperatures and white holes any of those subjects would be super interesting to expand on. Thanks for all the content.
The universe answers every question with 'yes', except when that answer would be in contradiction with any of the previous answers. Therefore, the questions create the universe.
Could gravity be an emergent property of particle interactions? Suppose that interacting particles create some "tension" in quantum fields, which propagates at the speed of light and diminishes according to the laws of gravity, such that the resulting momenta of the interactions of massive particles is influenced at a distance...   This would also explain why the Higgs field is required for mass (the continuous interactions between a massive particle and the Higgs field produce the gravity of the particle)
Its been awhile since I've watched a PBS space time video and come away from it not understanding a single thing it said
Thinking the universe has any need to be "observed" to exist is probably the most extreme example of narcissistic personality disorder.
So how do we know that the 'universe', meaning the measurable in time and size, is "everything"? What's stopping there from being other universes, not realities, but other universes like how there are other galaxies In the universe? I keep getting stuck on this question
That is heavy-duty derpity.  It sounds like it came from the IKEA Chair of Woo, Flatpack Chopra.
Ah Jabberwocky said Alice.
If logic exists regardless of a mind to process it, then all possible universes exist in the evaluation of the question "What is possible?"
I'm grateful that the Universe made me as devastatingly handsome as I am.
My theory, is that only I exist.  Everyone else is just information inputted into my brain.  Prove me wrong.  :-)
so it pretty much confirms the simulation theory cuz we have proven an optimized calculation function in works
Very pleased to see yet another appearance of the crazy haired demonstration man
Life is the 5th dimension
I already recorded everything in the universe, so alot of this doesn’t apply. I’m also making alot of dark matter right now.
about delayed-choice experiment, what if we also put detectors just after the first splitter, that way we would be able to collapse the wave function of the photon from afar if we were to look at the newly placed detectors (detectors are also entangled), my question is lets collapse the wave function just before the photons gone through the second splitter. if we collapsed the wave function, wouldn't the photon have a chance to go to the other direction of the second splitter, therefore we would send the information faster than light whether we collapsed the wave function, with no false positives, we are basically detecting spooky action at a distance
Basically, "we hold money and power, so we can bullshit our way through as much as we want..."
It seems they created lot of paradoxes in attempt to explain particle's behavior as actual material point in space.
Oh God, this made me think of "The Secret". Maybe they were right all along!
it is so funny to me seeing physicists & such getting so squeamish about mysticism...it's like they are more religious than spiritual people are
We need to have a better understanding of consciousness if we are going to have a better understanding of the universe
Had to check it wasn't April first on this one.
I think the question we should be asking is why the universe is not classical? When two particles collide why don't we decide right away what their eventual spin is going to be? Why does the universe wait for someone to ask the question about one of the particles, before deciding what the outcome is. If we try to describe the universe in a classical way when the outcome is decided right away, how would that universe look like? Why would it not work?  By the way, thanks for this video! Interpretations of quantum mechanics is one of my favorite topics!
So we're some sort of eternally suffering concept looking in on itself. Are we the true concept of black holes
I encourage all seekers of truth to start with this book, if it doesn't crave you wanting more I have many more recommendations: Jack Tanner, The Birth of Ontological Mathematics, where it all started, the separation between scientific materialism and rationalist idealism.
finally an interpretation that makes sense
I’ve had a question that I don’t think I’ve heard discussed. We know space is expanding, but my question is what is happening to time in the expanding universe. When space expands to the point of matter disintegrating and gravity lessening, will time speed up or slow down?
Your expirements are in vein, it's time for logic and reason to prevail. Because, it will indeed prevail, it's only a matter of time. What do you expect to find through observations alone? Oh, you described a particle? But what does it mean? Mind is the ultimate answer, it's through the mind and the mind alone that the truth can be known. It is through mind that your existence has a purpose, not through fallable and fallacious science. Materialism is a category error.
This is Stellaris spiritualists in a nutshell
Who is the guy they always show in the illustrations?
can you discuss: the Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe: A New Kind of Reality Theory Book by Christopher Langan
Some crazy ramblings by me: Perhaps black holes bring the inflaton field back to their metastable state, which reignites cosmic inflation in a new universe created by the black hole. Then the universe could be a black hole without needing to start with all the mass of the universe, as the inflaton field would create massive amounts of mass due to the expanding space creating new energy.
|_______| << it is observed so therefore it exists in reality. However, the owners don't want to hand it over. Therefore one must build their own achievements thus making |_______| a reality.
The negative 20 questions bit made me think of the pop-up trees in the 1st Colin McRae rally game. Trees only came into being as you drove towards their position and then disappeared into nothingness as your rear view mirror got beyond their sight range. My head is still spinning trying to wrap my brain around it.
*nose bleeding*
Oh man by @11:10 I had to pause because Ive wondered this for years but had no one to bounce it off of.  You know how, 1000 years ago, god was 'above the sky'? Then we invent telescopes, and god is 'outside the solar system'? Then we realize the universe is expanding, so god is now at the big bang. We keep pushing the notion of a creator further into extremes, but its us thats getting more sophisticated, not some creator. Its like, the more we discover the more there is. Whether or not the universe works this way, it has the same effect. Whenever you peer deeply at it, you can find anything you want. You can extend this too and find whatever you want to find.
Could it be that “observation” is a just a further entanglement that then binds your larger system to a smaller system thus “collapsing” the wave form? Sorry if that’s not very coherent.
I'd like to welcome everyone to my reality. You've all been great in it, for everything that has made this reality interesting, if nothing else. Too bad, when I die you all and this reality will disappear but until then, hello from the center of this reality, from my perspective.
The title of this video is really stupid… if the name was better, I would even watch it…
This reminds me of Lee Smolin's book Time Reborn. I'd love to know what Matt thinks about theories described there.

I didn't know how much I agreed with JAW until this video.
Fascinating, mind-blowing and extremely interesting as always
I think all right thinking people in this universe are sick and tired of being told that ordinary, decent people are fed up in this universe with being sick and tired. I'm certainly not! And I'm sick and tired of being told that I am.
If Schrödinger put a cat in the box, the cat also changed Schrödinger in the process, as Schrödinger literally had to lift the cat into the box. It is best to think of yourself as the cat in the box, which means you are not alive or dead, since the many-worlds interpretation is true. This is trivially proven using a zero knowledge proof and quantum suicide, get yourself a Kennedy half dollar and assign a decision you need to make to heads or tails, then flip the coin an odd number of times, I like to do three sets of three. The quantum wave function will select a choice for you which conforms with what is understood about bayesian statistics. Watch the movie, The Endless... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hURq5VGWVyo
hehe loved the ending. Totally on that bandwagon. show me something real <3
What if, After the big bang, the part of the universe that had mass expand, but since information does not have mass, that part of the universe didn't not expand.  That would explain the immediate exchange of information between entangled particles.
I have better questions: what is energy, what is a singular, what is thought? If you blow up the brain to the side of a mill, you still won't find the answer, the correct answer is nothing. The universe began with the singularity, began at nothing, and never left nothing. Everything is contained within the original singularity. That's all there is to it. It is the Aleph and the omega, it is god, and we are all a part of it. The answer is zero, nothing, and infinite. Ask yourself this one important question: I you were the creator of the universe, where would hide the answer to existence, far away from the average person and all prying eyes, only able to be found by the most intelligent beings. The answer is at it should be, inside of nothing. A monad fits the description of reality without fail. start looking at the things that point directly to Euler's formula. You want the truth, there it is, and of course the truth isn't observable, the answer isn't that easy. Get ahold of yourself science.
I’ll never understand how
Or, we actually live in a simulation. The only thing necessary for the bits of information from our perspective to work out as the phenomenon we observe is one difference. That whatever is running this simulation has a different speed of causality. Our speed of causality we observe could be orders of magnitude slower than the computer, or physical system, this simulation is running on. In any direction, literally any thing in any direction, you look it doesn't need to exist until "an observer" looks in that direction. Only the map of the initial conditions needs to be stored and the time frame since inception needs to be known. Then any point to any level of detail can be computed on the fly.
Very interesting. But, can one be a participatory realist from one's couch? 😆
Great stuff!
No need for all that. Quantum theory does a great job of predicting “reality “ but not much on the present or gravity.  Probably because it uses terms like e, pi, the square root of-1, etc. It seems the slippery slope has already led down the rabbit hole and beyond, a little late for rewriting physics.😩
So what you're saying is we're living in a DnD campaign?
And here I thought you were going to elaborate about gravitys influence on measurements...
Sounds like Wheeler informational universe closes to Platonic world of ideas. And both can lead to the answer why there is something rather than nothing.
I will never fail to participate in enjoying Matt's witty puns.
I have a question about the delayed choice/quantum eraser experiment (from https://youtu.be/8ORLN_KwAgs?t=438). Considering that we can either see an interference pattern or not on the other side depending on whether the quantum eraser is used, why can't this be used for FTL communication (by switching it on/off in regular intervals, erasing the screen, and checking whether there is interference pattern).  And why are the 50% mirrors to sure detectors necessary? The density between using and not using the eraser should be observable different for all photons anyway, so this doesn't really hide anything and if it does, why can't we get rid of them (what would be the result)?
It seems to need reiterating that we aren't _either_ in a simulation or not, but manifestly _both._ I don't have to choose between whether there are three apples on the table or there's a 3 on the display of my calculator. Putting a “real” three things on my table doesn't magically invalidate the “simulated” three in the calculator, or vice versa—and, indeed, you can run as many copies of a piece of software as you want. So we definitely exist in an infinite number of simulations, and quite possibly in an infinite number of “real” universes (assuming you can devise a meaningful semantics for this phrase).
Negative Questions: Jeopardy, is that you?
Question: Is space actually falling into a black hole like consumption, or is it just a geometry?  I ask because if it's consuming space, then a possible universe inside a black hole could be observing that inflow of space as an expansion of space after the formation of the initial big bang singularity.
The more one seeks(sees) the more one discovers.
Well, according to the theory of quantum mechanics everything is an energy wave until it is observed and then it becomes a particle,.....hmmm so if no humans existed in the Universe then it would be nothing but waves of energy and have no structure at all since particles would not appear having no one to look at them.  Quick, question, if humans stopped looking would the particle redissolve into wave energy or would that particle stay as a particle forever?
This creative, conscious Universe of which you speak sounds reminds me of Someone.
4/20 is an excellent time to contemplate.
Neil deGrasse Tyson brought up recently the point is the human mind even capable of asking the right questions ?  Fold that question onto the human brain it's self can the human brain understand itself ? Excuse me if I seem ignorant to established and peer reviewed science it is 4/20 !
Cannot definitly absolutly its like program which nobody change and also all is past in universe and future is our real time also its hard to explain but the law says the big Bang never happend because of universe laws the most possibility is the matter came in to our universe from different universe and interact with us its like virus which change and create New world also the v -1 must be done If we want to have stable matter it means spinning to create interaction with display of our universe its hard to explain and the end of universe will be very interesting  it will be like bulet moving from gun  and this will create New universe its cycle of universe
If you observe something and then I observe the same thing, is it pre-observed then?  As in: If you find the cat to be dead and then I look at it, could I find it to be alive? That doesn't sound like it's a thing.
Having seen the colossal scope of Big Physics, why kill the golden goose? Questions of hidden variables or decoherence (hidden dimensions) defy monetization. Dreams of sci-fi weapons trickle down. Physicists are funded by the NSF, a division of the DOD.
Here's a crazy idea: Dark energy isn't needed to explain the universe. The further you look in the universe, the quicker stuff seems to move away from us. But that's logical when you think of the big bang as an 'explosion' where everything moved away from each other very quickly (near light speed). In time stuff will move slower from each other due to gravity. So the longer you wait, the slower it moves. But when you look far away, you're looking back in time when everything still moves fast. So no wonder, the further away you look, the quicker things move away.  Also: Everything is moving away from each other in the universe. So in the past, stuff was closer together, which is why the big bang was postulated. But when you look really far away, you look back in time when everything was still close together. So when you take two points far away 90 degrees from each other, from our perspective those points are far far more light-years apart from each other than what they actually are. That means stuff should look smeared out over space at that distance. Galaxies should look bigger and fainter/red-shifted.
7:09 How do you know that the beam splitter is randomly allowing photons through rather than random photons have characteristics that allow it to either pass through or mirror and that the mirrors themselves are simply flipping their state? If 100% of photons that mirror off the first beam splitter, collide with a mirror, and then pass through the second beam splitter 100% of the time and vice versa, then how do we know that they are in a superposition constructively interfering rather than just going through one path or the other and how can both macro scale paths be of identical distance for them to line up "perfectly?" If this is explained with "many clever variations" of this experiment then I kind of wish some of those were also explained visually as well.
By "observe" or "meassure" I assume you mean to have a particle's wave function collapse because of interactions with other quantum systems?
Everything mentioned in the episode re QM could be true... unless superdeterminism is true.
The popular understanding of the Many-Worlds interpretation says that each reaction causes new universes to form, but what if it's the opposite? What if each reaction collapses the universal wave-form to only worlds that each have the exact same starting conditions? That would mean that every universe is exactly like ours, up to each individual moment of time, but all those where different outcomes transpired cease to exist the moment they differentiate?   That would allow for a universe that was both probabilistic, and deterministic, at the same time, and we as conscious beings would also still retain our free will. It would also bring about the lack of evidence for a multiverse... since all universes would be identical to our own.
I would love to hear more about Wheeler's philosophy (my friend Colin used to talk about Wheeler a lot)
SAURON!!!
It is possible to derive the quantum theory from the theory of relativity, we only need to allow observers moving at speeds greater than the speed of light. This is due to the work of physicists - Dragan and Ekert.
Great video, thanks.
It would be great to have an episode on Dragan's and Ekert's paper where they propose an explanation to the single photon interference experiment by allowing superluminal observers :)
One who is asking the question is more collective conciocusnes, then individual.   For example - we all agreed, long time ago, that objects drop down to the ground. We named that phenomenon - gravity.   Now, we are trying to answer each other, how could that be possible, and by asking that, we create new rules, new laws (of physics).   Logic is used for getting the right answers. Something that fits into our reality.   And then it goes - discovering new phenomenons, after that new rules. Some of them are so new that we still don't know how to answer them...
“There is a theory which states that if ever for any reason anyone discovers what exactly the Universe is for and why it is here it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another that states that this has already happened.” - Douglas Adams
It's like a dream where the dreamer is both the dreamer and the creator of the dream in a feedback loop. The only difference is dreams are fleeting, whereas waking reality persists and continues to build in a reasonably consistent way, until someone like Einstein comes along and says here's a crazy paradigm sift that fits, now let's go test it, and our view of realty completely shifts while also being completely consistent and measurable.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wheeler's ideas are my favorite so far.
Something Deeply Hidden
great episode :)
The Universe is a toroidal, fractal, nested wave.  Energy waves flow toroidally, it never stops, it never begins.  There are no "particles", only waves within waves at all scales.
Make a video about DMT hyperspace.
Its a time thing. Effects happen before causes. That explains it.
There is a similar analogous of that game for Wordle called Absurdle
topic: schwarzschild into any black hole metric that doesn't block the signal at horizon: the coordinate transformation between these is singular at horizon, so it doesn't make physical sense, hence the signal is blocked at horizon falling in, as seen by a distant observer, hence no information paradox. Also, this implies automatically that all information is encoded on the horizon, as seen by a distant observer.
Oh, finally one that isn't gibberish or blatant religion!  But this is really so simple at its core. Assuming that physicists are not just lying when they say that physics is the study of the observable, of the infinite number of mathematical structures that exist (here, “exist” in the mathematical sense of mere formal consistency), you inhabit the ones—all the ones—that are selected by your observations (in mathematical terms, _you_ are the “theory” and the _universe_ is the set of “models” of that theory, not the reverse). Of course, your finite memory (if that's what you have) causes the past to proliferate, as your finite observation bandwidth (if that's what you have) causes the future to.  The interesting subtlety is not to do with other observers, as such, but with the boundary of “you”. But the very idea that “you” have a definite impermeable boundary is known to be a cultural fallacy—something that evolutionary biology, art criticism and gender studies somehow have had less trouble grappling with than physics does(!).  Appeal to “independent reality” is just stupid. Where, in either the mathematics or the physics, is the bit stored that distinguishes “real” things from non-real things, if not in relation to the observer? If being “real” is a core physical property (as opposed to a redundant level of physical description), how is it observed? (Note that “through observation” is _not_ an acceptable answer, since this would make it redundant with other properties, the observed ones!)
Someone the other day mentioned that in physics, imaginary (i.e.) complex are often more real than real numbers. It's all over the symmetries of these kinds of things and going from like octonions to reals almost seems like how we experience all this, if we can really only interact with reals.
Missed opportunity to publish at bicycle day, but I guess 420 is good enough
I think of "reality" like I do the Chicken and the Egg. The egg came first with a chicken in it. The same goes for the Universe as it came first in order for us to be, and thus giving us the ability to observe. Not the other way around.
almost sounds like some alan watts stuff here. The knower cannot be the thing that is known.
i wonder how many layers there are until you get to the very core of reality.
Isn't this general system theory? interaction of constituents (through space AND time)? feedback loops (positive or negative) (from past to future and future to past)?
Its proven that brains function on wavelengths what if our observation brain produces the counter to the universes creation aka we create the reality by our brains wavelengths
Just the type of video I need at 5:15pm on 4/20 😉
Gravity was absent from the Universe until the Higgs Boson appeared and gave all Matter its Mass.  In the most early beginning during the the big bang, Matter had no Mass.  During the Singularity, there is intense Gravity due to all of the Mass within the Matter which formed the Singularity condensing together. Once it becomes so hot from becoming so dense, Mass goes away because all the Matter becomes Energy, then pops another big bang. It's cyclical.  E=mc^2
Unfortunately, I believe this line of thinking is the sort of thing that gives humans (observers) too much credit for the nature of reality and/or the state of the existence of the universe in which we live.  All do respect to everyone involved with PBS Space Time, this isn't something that can even be tested on a reliable, practical, or remotely macro scale, so I question its validity as a theory.  This is nothing more than an imagining with no real meaning even from a theoretical perspective.  Perspective, literally being the foundation of the postulate.   A simplified notion of, 'the universe doesn't exist until we observe it' says FAR more about our limited understanding and overwhelming ignorance regarding the structure of reality, than it does about the legitimacy of the universe's existence.   The logical answer from what I can observe, is that we live in an indifferent, violent, and beautiful universe which we can sense in many ways, (perhaps most profoundly through visual cognition) that operates on practical laws of understandable physics, and it will continue to do so long after any and all conscious lifeforms (observers) are gone.   We are very fortunate to be here to witness the amazing show that is the universe, but that show will go on unaffected by the lack of its audience.
Does this YouTube video have this comment? I am not going to look and see.
So. I keep seeing these videos about how quantum particles become localized when measured. But how about the other way? How does thise quantum superpositioned particles get produced or converted to superposition? We never really hear about that. Cause, if they get localized when measured by any observant, aka interacts with something localized, then why have we not run out of these superpositioned particles yet?
I really do think I have a model, somewhat similar to this, that could explain all of these seeming discrepancies and paradoxes...  But it goes a step further and doesn't require participation from an "observer" (although that observer is still a participating component), or that the universe be "made of information" (although it certainly contains it, and the relationship between information and reality are inseparable)  It just requires that we go all in on QFT and embrace the concept that the only thing that exists is the now... (although now for me and now for you do not need to be the same unless we are causally linked and sharing the same reference frame)..  Basically all of reality, you, me, the sun, the andromeda galaxy, and everything in between are really just expressions of the magnitude of the amount of potential and kinetic energy contained within and distributed throughout the quantum fields.... sort of points of high pressure constrained by the degrees of freedom in the fields, the fundamental properties of the fields, and the interactions between the various regions of high and low pressure both in between and within these fields. Collapse is nothing more than when a pressure wave in one field, exchanges enough virtual particles with another to collapse the entire pressure wave out of the field in which it's propagating into the field where that potential energy manifests as a point particle in that field, kind of like punching a hole in a high pressure canister, the point where all the high pressure air is rushing out of is your particle.  The reason this can fix so much of the quantum weirdness that we see in these thought experiments is that it allows for systems to evolve locally, but then have an ability for "correction" should a "conflict" arise between regions of spacetime when the information (and energy) from the disparate regions come together and interact, allowing  "spooky action at a distance" to work without breaking locality. It also eliminates the paradoxes like Schrodinger's cat without requiring many worlds or extra spatial dimensions  to try and sum it up as simply as I can, it's a bit like last thursdayism in the sense that it's built on the premise that all of the information we have about the past can only be known as the current expression of the sum of all the past information that gave rise to the current state that we experience as "now". Explained in terms of fields, if we imagine the entire universe as a grid of fields, and that the properties of any one point in the universe are determined by the values of the degrees of freedom in each grid box, then the values of the current state depend on prior values and the exchange of values with surrounding boxes.  I set things up this way because it illustrates that all you really know about the past is the information available to you when you take a measurement of those values, and knowledge of the past is extrapolated from those current measurements. So there is no real way of being certain whether the information actually represents the past, or if the universe just popped into existence the way it looks last thursday  To be clear, I'm not advocating for last thursdayism, or suggesting that the universe is any younger than it appears. I am just setting up the premise that underlies the proposed mechanism.  Anyway, with all that out of the way... what if the reality that we experience is the sum of colliding probability waves that actually carry potential energy through the quantum fields, and the sum of two waves may create an alternate version of the current experience than what would be experienced given the path of just a single wave.  Put more plainly, and relevant to the locality issue, what if when measured, each of the entangled particles give an independent measurement that is is non correlated, at first. But when the two seperate probability waves that were triggered during measurement of the particles eventually collide, they interfere and create a single new probability wave that is consistent with the original properties imparted by the entanglement.  Even more plainly. when two entangled particles, one on earth and one on the moon, are measured, you get whatever you measure, and it's random, but when the information about the measurements is exchanged, the field states re-align to account for the sum of the probabilities, and what we observe is information that agrees with the properties of entangled particles.  So when you measure one, you don't actually know what the current state of the other particle is, but instead you know what the INFORMATION about the state WILL BE when you receive that information... or at least you think you do, because your current reality may be rewritten once the information is exchanged, and your current reality may, in a way, cease to exist.  I hope that made sense... hard concept to communicate with words.. looks better when expressed as summation of probability equations.. lol.. I personally really like this hypothesis as it is extremely consistent, both internally, and with experimental evidence, and it leaves no paradoxes that I am aware of...  It really seems to be the best fit for all of the seeming paradoxes that arise from quantum entanglement, Schrodinger's cat and experiments like the delayed choice quantum eraser experiment.  Or at least, it seems a plausible fit to me.  I just wish I had actually finished my degree so I could actually do something with the idea.. But hey.. this is quantum mechanics...  So if history is anything to go by, I'm probably completely out to lunch.. lol Cheers!
Jesus god, i remember Jim Al Kalili trying to explain this ( the work of Wheeler) in a BBC programme years ago, i did'nt really get in then, after watching Matt with cartoon about 18 times, stopping....re-starting...i still dont really get it; and these experiments have all proved him right (Wheeler) . So now i know im just thick, thank god, but am i the only one who stands with their mouth open ?
This was a great topic for 4/20.
Yes it does, the singularity was a mental event. Where we all existed in the realm of pure thought. The whole is in all of its parts.
If we imagine an Informational Universe as being akin to the Game of Life, wherein large interacting systems can form from very simple rules (emergent phenomena), then it can be conceived that the "bits" are both information and thing, both observed and observer, both measured and measuring.   Of course, when you look at things in such a granular way, the distinction between energy, matter and information thoroughly breaks down. And perhaps it should; the false distinction of a thing's "thingness" calls to mind the Vedic concept of Saṅkhāras.
This is all nothing but postmodernism, which is anti-scientific. We must cling to realism. The only real problem is why or how the wavefunction collapses to the appearance of a "point particle", my take is that it is because of interaction (re-entanglement) with other wavefunction (particle), nothing else. Observers are nothing but sets of collapsing/interacting/re-entangling wavefunctions, just like the Universe itself or anything, there's nothing especial about consciousness.
I would not so easily discount our brain as as earth’s evolved champion in your current mess
So, if wheeler was correct, does that increase the chances we live in a simulation..
knock knock who's there? its bitsy itsy bitsy who? big bang!
This is what being a Dungeon Master feels like
Thank you for at least not ignoring the possibility that something else entirely different might be going on.
It is aliens. It's always aliens.
I got some Outer Wilds vibes from this one.
For one episode you could get a dude dressed up as an Alien, holding a blasting gun, so he an slightly, and accidentally, enter the scene just when you finish saying 'it's not aliens'.   Also stealing that expands into the future thing, I'll ref PBS ST, haha.
It was always meant to be found, that's why it was there.
perfect day to drop a new video i can’t wait to watch it 😭
I like to keep it simple - Multidimensional Steady State Universe. All possible pasts and futures exist as a single entity. All observers simply experience their own similar but unique slice of spacetime.
nyos
Perhaps a series on "Why QM and GR disagree" some lead up episodes getting down how the equations have problems mixing, progressing into how hypothetical GUT's get around or attempt to fix these issues and the subsequent issues with those theories and their predictions beyond whats needed? This may be a tad too math oriented as that's the main sticking points for the two otherwise it would be easy haha. But anything like that would definitely be helpful in getting a bigger picture of what cutting edge physics is dealing with. Cheers!
Happy 420 everybody.
I like this one
God
So does the early universe exist as an informational probability soup of every possible thing until the probability of a "conscious observer" reaches some critical value, therefore entangling the observer with the parts of the universe necessary for their existence? To an new possible observer outside the past light cone of the first, the first observer would still seem like just another possibility in the soup until collapsed. Why couldn't the observer just be a massive rock. The rock "observes" by being hit with energy from its past light cone. This feels like the many worlds interpretation all over again where every "thing" acts as its own observer, collapsing into the reality where it exists.
Does this have anything to do with particles travelling at the speed of light? My thinking is that since photons travel at the speed of light and thus have no experience of time, the "point-like" instance in which they exist needs to be completely defined before they can have any kind of meaningful properties. Does that make sense? Like, imagine a photon that existed some time right after the big bang, and is absorbed by a photon detector in the present day. From the photon's perspective, its entire existence from its reference frame is still a single instant from the time it was emitted to the time it was detected. But if the photon detector is removed, the photon still exists for a single instant, but that "instant" isn't defined yet because the photon hasn't been measured. There's no "end" to its journey yet, so it isn't "defined." Man all this stuff messes with my head, are there any physicists who can help?
I'm very much onboard with the many worlds interpretation. The cat is either dead or alive but in different timelines, before I open the box the cat is either already dead or alive, I just won't know which universe I'm in until I check.
bro the stoners are havin a ball with this vid today
Thank you Matt and the entire spacetime team!! This video is one of your best ever.
Happy 4/20,  a good day to watch this. :)
Am I getting it right if I'm simplifying to say that this theory says that unobserved particles are simply not "asked about" by the universe at large yet?
I took a look at the survey but honestly the videos are way better than any idea I can conceive. One episode favorite was the one about Conformal Cyclic Cosmology. Purchased Penrose's book about it. Great read.
I'd say it's just a bunch of entanglement: When the 1st researcher sees the result, they get entangled with the result, and when the 2nd researcher hears about it, they get entangled with the 1st researcher.  This would then mean that both the researches with the good and bad results exist simultaneously, in separate quantum states, and there never really is a "choice" to be made. (Granted, i don't know how much sense that makes according to the current mathematics of it)
Thanks for the content and survey taken.
Really interesting theory! I think that some of the issues with this (and many other quantum theories) is that some terms are not well defined: what exactly is an observer? A human? I sure hope so! A cat? Probably. A tree? Maybe, it can react to changes in it's environment. Is that observation? If so, almost everything is an observer! A bacteria? A virus? Even a chip in a computer reacts to it's (electrical) environment. And not just electrical if you hook up suitable sensors. Hopefully we can come up with a good scientific answer to this. And no one seems to know what consciousness is! It seems to me like these questions are tightly coupled with many of the attempts to interpret quantum mechanics beyond "shut up and calculate".
Hello. I am a comment. I only just came into existence as you started reading me. And I will stop existing when you finish reading me. I will come back into existence if you read me again. That is all.
Thanks dark energy!
Here's an idea: The past and the future(s) are the same thing. Imagine an arrow with the potential to point in all directions in time, different futures and pasts. Almost all directions lead to an higher entropy. There's only some that have lower entropy. Now optimize for the direction of the lowest entropy. Do a step in the direction of that arrow and repeat that process. It lines out the path to a state where the entropy is 0. There is only one shortest path. But there are many where the entropy gets higher. Now the idea. I state that all possible paths exist. The question is why the universe's entropy was so low at the beginning of time. But was it actually? When you are thinking of the past you are just imagining an optimal path of many possible paths through time where the entropy is lower, and call that 'the past'. You can imagine any different path where entropy gets higher. All are equally real, so the one leading to entropy 0 as well. Why was entropy so low in the past? Because we define it to be so.
Is it possible that matter is actually travelling somehow near the speed of light and a slight change in its' velocity is causing the appearance of dark energy and/or dark matter?
I find it strange to present observation in terms of "conscious beings" *first,* and only then go back and consider the possibility that observation is just interaction. The latter seems vastly simpler and more coherent.
i've never heard of this 20 questions game.
Sounds awfully like the Penumbral Calculus from Qud. Regardless, as for "whose bit?", it sounds like another answer that points to the simulation hypothesis. As for motive, see Ancestor Simulations
Please bare with uneducated me, so if everything can have a chance to be many different positiosn like light till its observed, then why does images of things extremely far away seem very defined instead of being a jumbled mess of light. is it just simply the objects are too big/a lot of light and the different possible postions of the light is too small to make a big enough difference?
Is there a test that if feasibly performed could reveal something which suggests that the simulation hypothesis is true?
Does the green hill zone continue to exist once Sonic has died?
Brilliant instalment, as usual. You’ve taught me so much over the years, thanks very much.
This was a good one, observer based physics feels important
If spacetime is participatory, dependent on the communication of information between real entities that exist, then doesn't that give rise to the possibility of faulty communication? I.e. could some of the quantum 'randomness' be explained by these entities simply miscommunicating? E.g. the inherently probabilistic nature of an atom absorbing a photon could be due to times when the two simply do not properly communicate that one is an atom and the other is a photon, or that this particular atom can absorb a photon of that energy, or some smaller component of the two which underly the absorption phenomena.
Question 1. Is your next answer yes?   Answer. Yes! Question 2. Was your previous answer no?
In The Beginning all of Existence & Everything within it All existed simultaneously as One. All Fields, Planes, Dimensions, Particles, Waves, Molecules, Atoms, etc. all existed together as One. Even Spacetime itself is a part of the "One". This "One" & All of its contents are Information and Data.     Before the Beginning there was Nothing. The "idea of nothingness" is still Information. When you imagine Nothing, you are still generating Data. Nothing has always existed, which means something has always existed = Information/Data. Physical Existence is a Paradox. It exists just as much as it does not exist.     Before the Nothing/Everything (&also during) is Eternal Consciousness which Underlies, Permeates, & Emanates all of Reality (Actual & Potential). Consciousness, Awareness, & Imagination are all interchangeable.     This Eternal Consciousness manifested the "One" via its own Imagination & Awareness through Nothing. All other Fields & Particles came after the "One".     As Consciousness becomes more Self Aware, more Information & Data are generated. As more Information & Data are generated, more creations become created. The more creations there are, the more Information exists. The more Information, the larger the Universe expands.     The original "One Particle" at the Beginning of Spacetime began as an idea/thought within the Awareness of the Eternal Consciousness.   (Modern Physicists and Scientists are currently doing experiments to prove that Information has Mass & is Physical). "Matter" acquires its Mass due to the 'God Particle' which was discovered by CERN in 2012.
time creates the universe.  it can not be said with fewer words
as long as "observation" is defined as *physical interaction* i totally buy it.
I love that physics and philosophy are slowly overlapping more and more. I'm religious and I think religion, physics and philosophy all come from the same fundamental truths, and I think before we can have a theory of everything, all three will merge into one study.
I obviously misunderstood something because I keep hearing really strong arguments for simulation theory... How is this not a huge suggestion of simulation latent space or bit processing outside the sim space? Please explain.
You know, I wonder what Immanuel Kant would've made of quantum theory...would he have determined it to be a part of experience as in the world of phenomena, or would he have considered it as a figment of the noumenal realm, forever beyond all human comprehension and experience...
"shut up and calculate" best line of this video, thank you Feynman!
Why can’t you write a Background Independent version of Schrödinger’s Wave equation.  As it’s not Background Independent, why do Many World’s fans think it’s complete enough to say it predicts MW?
Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.

Have there be a delayed choice experiment with particles with mass, or this is only possible with photons?
Why can't the observed particle actually be the observing particle? It could reside in a very tiny 5th dimension with part of it's quantum field and observe if anything comes within interaction range (like magnets attract / detect iron in a sense), than it collapses it's wave function towards the interact-able particle and becomes observable by it in the normal dimensions.
I think this Schrodinger’s cat thought experiment is a red herring and creates unnecessary confusion. Read Lee Smolin and Clelia Verde, The Quantum Mechanics of the present. April 21 2021. I think some quotes from Schrodinger, Heisenberg and Freeman Dyson are worth reading in the paper and Smolin and Verde make sense. The general idea is that wave functions only exist in the future. The passage of time is bound up with wave function collapse. Schrödinger’s cat is not in a superposition of alive and dead in the past or the present, it is actually alive or dead. The cat is only in a superposition in the future and when we look it is the present when the wave function has collapsed.  This collapse happens as we move forward in time regardless of us looking or not.  I am certainly not an expert in this area of physics and would appreciate my comment being corrected or clarified.

Just to answer the question, it seems obvious to me that the answer is yes. This might be the theologian in me, however if I am made of particles of this universe, as a percentage of the universe, however small, the actions I take from eating to breathing to creating art is a percentage of creation I add to the sum of creation.  In mathematical terms, if the Universe is the sum of all infinities, and we are a degree of infinity, we add to our infinity and we still get infinity, however it becomes more complex. You start with n, then n+1 then n+2 and so on, where n equals infinity, but this represents the observable moment, and how much you can divide and multiply is based upon your own level of complexity.  Everything from the smallest particle to the most complicated alien living in an asteroid to the largest black holes at the centers of galaxies are all on this long chain of summation. So even writing this or even reading it is adding something. And that's why life is positive to us. Because it adds. Maybe I'm just a simpleton, but it seems simple enough to me.
I know others will find me old fashioned (if they'rebeinnice),  but I simply believe in a transcendent God.
So our conciousness is just reality being self-aware?
This is Taoism and many others views that it does and is 🙏
Does the universe exist if there is no life or observer to observe it?
Simulation. The system only renders the pieces of reality currently being observed, to save CPU cycles.
On the beam splitter experiment: Once the photon interacts with the detector, it becomes a part of that detector, through which a secondary impulse is released as the "detection" - Wouldn't this imply that there's some degree of "quantum entanglement" occurring between the detector, photon and emitter, despite our perception of causality?  On a separate note: What does all of this mean? PBS Spacetime has been communicating the 'modern' understanding of physics for years, but I'd really like to hear what they believe the philosophical implications of these observations summates to.
The only problem with the delayed eraser experiment is that you have no choice in the matter of putting the second splitter or not. So the photon "knows" exactly whether it will be there or not because the universe already decided it through it's infinite amount of initial conditions. Furthermore, from the point of view of the photon it all happens at the same time so there is no inconsistency. The trouble comes from the assumption that we are isolated from the wave function of... spacetime.
"Does the Universe Create Itself?" Does it ? I remain unconvinced.
PRESENT WHAT IS SPACE?  WHAY IS THST STUFF BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE MOON?
Even the most rudimentary form of organism capable of performing the role of observer surely had to take many billions of years to evolve in the new universe (as generations of stars produced the heavier elements required for life). But if there is no reality without observation, how did the universe evolve to a point where it could create observers, during a period in which there were no observers?
The universe came from everywhere and its descending into everywhere
Camera or lens upgrade?
Episode on Kant next pls
If the only reality that can exist is one in which there are observers to observe it, that still does not answer the question of what created observers in the first place, and so what mechanism does this theory give to create the universe? Just saying that the universe can only exist if there are people to observe it would not inherently create the matter and energy that those observers are comprised of. What do you think of this?
PROOF FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD!  The first observer or examination lead to all the following information of the Universe.  The first observer is God and God creates everything?
Why so afraid of the woooo? No physicist understands what consciousness is … so why make premature assumptions what it not is?
Comparison of Hubble and JWST.
This entire video is just a long explanation for smart people not understanding object permanence.  An object doesn't require you to observe it for it to exist.  Neither does a physical phenomenon or fundamental law.  It exists whether you are able to observe it or not, or are actively observing it or not.
I think the universe is caused by a photon interacting with an energetic field similar to the way positions and electron are created. They say that light is the speed limit of causality, I would argue that light is the reason causality exists at all. Think about it, according to relativity light experiences zero time and zero space from it's perspective. So it has to be eternal or the prime mover of all things, I don't see how this couldn't be the case. It is very obvious to me we are trapped in a enclosed system that will only cease function when light ceases to interaction with matter (which is only a manifestation of a Quantum field). Only read more if you want to see a religious tirade...  I'm starting to think the early people of the bible were taught by an alien civilization trying to get humanity to understand things in the best way conceivable for the time. Just read the verse "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" you can read this as space and matter! "The earth was without form and void" this would make sense if the universe was some sort of quantum field at first. "And God said let there be light and there was light" The first object God creates is light in a formless void... you may say the Bible got lucky but I'm convinced that there is something to it.
Wouldn't scale invariance make the size of 'our universes' black hole vs the ones that form inside it irrelevant? If black holes in our universe form their own universes any observers inside wouldn't be able to tell they were "smaller"
Lol. You see a flat universe and then assume that the mass energy density is exactly such that it allows for a flat universe. The real answer is that Newton was right to say that there an infinite universe cannot collapse. Modern cosmology is just as ridiculous as flat earth.
Considering that so many crazy paradoxes *exist only in the Copenhagen interpretation* (e.g. measurements don't affect reality in the many-worlds interpretation), maybe the problem is not the universe but this specific interpretation?  BTW, the many-world interpretation should be the default, since it assumes nothing except the well-tested theories of quantum mechanics.  Instead the Copenhagen "interpretation" is really a separate and unverified theory, since it implicitly assumes that the brains of scientists work exclusively on classical physics and can never be affected by the quantum mechanics laws that govern the rest of the universe.  Given that premise, I'm not surprised by all the paradoxes that pop up in Copenhagen. 🙄
I feel my head twisted now....it’s really depressing how much I don’t know I don’t know.
Or the light really travels both paths in the Delayed Choice experiment, because it's an unquantized wave and not a particle.  It would appear quantized if it's also "self-entangled," by which I mean absorption of part of the wave causes absorption of the entire wave, even if some of the wave was far away (outside the past lightcone) from the absorption location a moment before the absorption.  Since quantum mechanics already includes entanglement phenomena, "self-entanglement" of a wave doesn't seem implausible, and perhaps this interpretation is simpler in the Occam's Razor sense.
What your saying is that reality lies, leading you down a garden path that has no structure to it.  You believing in reality, create the path that didn't exist until you willed it to be there.  You, are realities god.
Hope more people understand what The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is really about.  Hope more of you guys start waking up to the "new" reality that your perspective keep pointing towards.  Plato's cave. Ignorance is bliss.   To have a theory of everything, one must consider EVERY perspective. Science has to figure out that its only one part (tool) of many.
The act of observation itself changes the results. So most of what's discussed here scholarly supposition.
I have some questions or ideas for an episode:  Time apparently relatively stops at the event horizon of a black hole. So time outside of the event horizon has to move relatitvely infinitely fast. But Black holes are evaporating. So it must be impossible to reach this point where time 'stops'.  Therefore, just before reaching the event horizon, there must be some kind of a firewall that converts all infalling stuff into Hawking radiation, and there can't be an inside of a black hole. What do you think bout this?  Also, an event horizon can form from within a collapsing core of a star. Doen't that mean that this core is exposed again when the event horizon has shrunk enough due to evaporation, the core of the star is exposed again as a neutron/quark star?  And one last one: Does there exist a maximun temperature? As the wavelenght of the radiation reaches the plank level, it can't get any shorter right? And does that mean that blak holes that have evaporated to one planck lenght in diameter can never evaporate any further?
Sooo.. you’re telling me I can get a living T-Rex 🦖 sounds better than a living dead one :)
Event horizons don’t exist. It would take an infinite amount of time to form.
if the air became poison to all life and a tress falls it still displaces the poison air or whatever the atmosphere is
Well this didn't turn out to be about my hypothesis about the Universium Fairies, according to which (and apropos thanking dark energy) the universe (via the aforementioned fairies) seems to be creating more physics for mankind to discover when physicists in their hubris declare to "know it all". That is, that there are fairies _somewhere_ creating more physics for humankind to discover, not out of malice, occasionally out of spite, mostly since they feel that it would be unfair to deprive future physicists from making new discoveries. There's a great track record for this hypothesis, what with late 19th century physics running into new exciting quantum science, symmetries being broken by esoteric weak force interactions if nothing else, and in cosmology there's all that dark matter and dark energy that we found when we thought we had a complete understanding of the universe on grand scales in our hands.  As a scientific theory, I think it has two great advantages: 1) It is completely non-falsifiable, and 2) it has fairies in it, who, in all fairness, are probably the entities who make the fundamental theorem of calculus work.  I eagerly await the PBS Space Time's response to my groundbreaking hypothesis.
Interrogating a physicist must be fun:  “Did you do it?” “I can’t answer that until you tell me how you measured it.” “We know the cat was alive when you entered the room…”
Also, because everything was one thing at some point in time, that means the center of the universe is everywhere. The expansion of the universe is the reason why the center is discernible from everything else.
Using Einstein’s field equations to calculate more than one object, is pure stupidity.
if consciousness is a requirement how come we like to rule out consciousness from animals to babies to cells.   I mean doesn't the cat count as an observer.  but yeah If all life on earth gets  killed by  by so radiation. and a tree collapse it still displaces air
MAGNIFICENT EPISODE 👏🙏
Simple Answer NO
The only woo is materialism.
Is actually qubit and 2 guys talking. ITs "mine, yours, ours, no ones." not bit, otherwise he is onto something.
11:23 - I have to object your use of this term. It should be called quantum woo-woo, as James Randi would have called it.
Ive had this hypothesis floating around my head for a bit, and I wanted to get some input on it. This hypothesis is closely related to the Big Bounce hypothesis, but it varies in some aspects. Hypothesis: When the universe becomes completely uniform time will "reverse", eventually turning our universe into one with white holes, is dominated by antimatter, and is crunching in on itself. This could explain why we dont see white holes or much antimatter at all in our universe without having to resort to extremely complex equations that have yet to precisely model our universe. As scientists have already hashed out, reversing time doesnt make a difference in terms of physics. Reversing time doesnt break our equations, our equations actually work exactly the same if time is reversed. The only thing it does is change matter to antimatter and black holes into white holes. So whats stopping a fragile, uniform universe from not being uniform anymore? Whats stopping time from reversing when entropy has nowhere else to go? And when time is reversed and the universe eventually crunches in on itself, whats stopping the extreme environment of the subatomic universe from rebounding and time going forward again? This hypothesis differs from the big bounce hypothesis by introducing the concept that time can reverse when entropy ceases. Its not just "our universe will expand to a certain point then crunch back in on itself". This hypothesis argues that the universe will crunch back in on itself by time reversing when entropy can no longer make things any more uniform. Whats more interesting is that the previously reversing universe that turned into our big bang could have left an imprint on the CMB. Something that multiverse theory proponents say could only happen from a universe outside of our own. Well, now they have competition if we ever do find an imprint on the CMB.
what if the speed of light is the speed it is . because of at least 2 opposing forces pulling on space Time in different directions and the speed of light is how it balances out
● Everything is created to create... You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know this. Even humans are created to create. Think......... 🤔🙄
That wheeler guy sounds inspired by dialectical materialism
Ooh a new one
the universe controls your actions but it also obeys your commands
so there's power in prayer
I'd be interested in hearing your take on Penrose's idea that if the universe ends up decaying entirely into massless particles, then the notion of space collapses and you have a universe's worth of energy in a no-space, which would provide the initial conditions for a big bang. Sort of an oscillating universe theory, except without any collapse.
my representation for this would be the Ouroboros snake eating itself. Or is it vomiting itself?
omg the universe is a joke that it plays on itself
It would be okay if you guys stopped ending every episode with “spacetime.” We get it, it’s the name of the show and can also be used in a sentence.
I do like this explenation because without ever gaining observers, something may as well not exist. And honestly that’s functionally the same. Any object, being , or force that will never be detected or interacted with for all of eternity is arguably even less real than imaginary things which are at least being interacted with in our minds.
Episode idea 2, calming the oceans! Assuming that future AI weather systems could pinpoint to infant Hurricane forming at sea, what kind of physics would be required to de-energize that weather surface area from space by building artificial sunspots (micro-blocking the sun to lower surface heat and humidity)?
Inclusive animations.  How woke.
In way the delay experiment, reinterpreted by relativity, makes more sense and eliminates the weirdness. The photon goes through a beam splitter and then to 1 of two detectors but if another splitter is placed at the end it only goes through 1 of them; but from the photon's point of view it's traveling at the speed of light and therefore does not experience time so it experiences the whole experiment at once and thus it's simply doing what it can do. The weirdness comes from us imposing the concept of time (before and after) on something that has no before or after but simply a now.
What blows my mind the most is that out of all these insane ideas, there is actual truth, the actual way the universe works, and its probably really really mind blowing
I hate this interpretation of the universe. It's ridiculous to say an "observer" needs to exist for everything else to exist.
Does that explanation mean that the universe needed sentient beings, asking questions, to get started? As we understand it now, our universe itself probably didn't have sentients, let alone questions, from the start.
Maybe both realities of every observation are correct (shrodinger cat like)... half the population observes one thing and half observes the other and we reconcile the differences via the Mandela effect..

Shut up and calculate.  PBS Space Time should do so.
I actually think the universe is physical... but operates exactly Like a simulation. like a video game. where it's 100% open world, and characters move around, and do things. when not actually looking at that character they aren't rendered, and exist only mathematically within a set of parameters, and all possibilities are possible, but because of the exact frame and time a photon traveling hitting an eye, or sensor the shortest, easiest path to that sensor is chosen, and what that image, or "reality", or "answer" is then constructed, and it becomes the only possible solution. now I am only discussing us looking at galaxies billions of years ago that clearly don't exist in that form anymore, and aren't even in that location anymore. then when someone else looks, and checks the same thing because we are in a very similar point of reference searching for the same thing. they find the same thing as well. because the path, and constraints of the present, only allow so many possible results. so you also find the most likely result when you check for yourself.
I have always liked theories on information based universes. If you could do a video on the theory proposed by Eric Verlinde I would love it! I do wonder though, who or what asked the first question in this theory? It only makes sence if there are already things that can "know" in the universe.
You know the physics is good when it's f**ked up.

When I started watching this channel I thought a career in fusion was a pipe dream.  Now I've worked on a research device and will be working on SPARC.  Plasma physics is a deep field but it's very interesting.  Please do videos on it!
To think our observation changes reality is of the utmost arrogance!
supermassive non feeding black hole with spin and charge, what happens to virtual particles? more Penrose wizardry
I didn't hear a single truly scientific statement in this video.
According to Wikipedia N. David Mermin coined the phrase "shut up and calculate!" not Richard Feynman: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._David_Mermin
Well... I tend to agree with Richard Feynman.  Too much philosophy for my taste. (And I do like philosophy!)
I‘m a mathematician, and I struggle hard to get a straight answer from physicists on the following questions:  1. given an observation, how do you calculate forward or backward the wave function in time? Is that even meaningful?  2. Is it fair to compare quantum mechanics to a hidden Markov model if you replace the Markov transition operator with some unitary operator and the emission operator with the absolute square of a projection?  If 2. is the case, then in my mind, the mystery would basically go away. If you think about it, a hidden Markov model is (just like a Markov chain) just an encoding of the statistics of the observable marginal process. Often, the hidden process is entirely made up and just serves to reduce the complexity of the data to something that we can deal with mathematically.  The same might be true for the wave function: even though you kinda need it to effectively calculate the statistics of quantum measurements, it may be entirely made up. Note that one doesn’t have to treat mathematics as „just a language“ or say that physical models are always „just models [that don’t say anything about fundamental reality]“. One only has to know when to make this distinction.  If my speculation is correct, we might learn something about fundamental reality by analyzing the class of observable processes that quantum mechanics encodes. However, I wouldn’t expect efficient predictive algorithms from that.

Random comment for the youtube algorithm
Does this mean that when there is no more energy in the universe, reality stops?   If there are no particles to measure, then there is no reality, right?
No.  It's a false premise.
...So, the universe could be procedurally generated?

It is much logical to believe in Ancestor Simulation than universe creatin' itself! There are many examples where nature can't arrange itself the way it was arranged! It sometimes feels like someone secretly controllin' every action of this universe!
i dont know why i am not able to get your videos
That implies energy in general is the observer, and it observes itself, so it has to be consistent with it's own rules. But that doesn't explain why this particular rule set, and not any other?
So are we ever going to talk about how the quantum erasure experiment DOESN'T actually retroactively change anything, nor scramble any information? It's a straight up lie suggesting it has any impact on events that occurred previously.
I think Wheeler is spot on. For example: what is a universe with no observers? A billion trillion years is no different than a femtosecond if there is no one to experience it. That physical observable becomes meaningless. Likewise, this concept can be extended to any and all physical observables. The observer then is the mechanism which gives observables context and thus generates what we consider reality.  In a way, observers bring about their own existence by observing the universe which can create that observer.
I know a lot of science-minded people watch this channel and I need some help with this question. One of the central "tenets" of science is observation. Some people say if something can't be observed then it's not science. What is the response to this? Can the act of observation be skipped or ignored if we have a consilience of evidence without the observation?  I'm intentionally not giving an example because I just want to hear responses based on the practice of science in general and not on any one field/topic.
Alright, it is time to scrap the idea of causality to allow the participatory universe? Cause is not necessarily preceding effect in these modern times, maybe it was better in the past? 🙃 Or is all this confusion caused by the extended double-slot experiments just a consequence of quantum entanglement reaching not only across the three space dimensions but also along the time axis in a similar way.. ? Why does it have to be this hard to literally "think out of the box" when it comes to time? 😁 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19NGtR3xjYY
Yo wag1 g wot u sayin
Episode idea please! What kind of physics, energy and technology would be required for humans to protect Earth from our expanding sun for extra 1 billion years ie building sun facing polarized orbital contact len?
It's funny to read all these theories off something that's  incomprehensible for our human mind. We can not explain reality as it is, we can only live it.
Thank you!  Been waiting for a show on Wheeler’s theory!!!

TheUniverse is made upfrom all of the hopes, dreams, wishes, fears, and nightmares of all of its inhabitants combined in the weirdest and most prfound ways. BTw Schodinger's cat is neither alive nor dead but it is extremely comdortable sitting in a box.
The central question to answer or definition to make in any interpretational framework that claims to be more than an effective theory is what an observer actually is.   I would love to see an episode on how different schools approach this topic. Personally, I found the decoherence approaches in a multiverse setting most appealing so far (scratching that objectivist itch…), but I am not sure whether they explain satisfactorily outcomes of delayed choice experiments. I suspect that yes in the sense that the choice is part of the quantum system and that incompatible measurements decohere, but that’s just a hunch. Would love to hear more about that.
typo in the sixth question of the survey
I like the tought that the wave function can collaps on its own, without someone to observe through the means of some sort of probabilty function. Looking at Schrödingers Cat. The probabilty it died after leaving it there for 3 weeks without food/water and air is 100%. It does not matter of the poison killed it or nor. But the cance of it dying increased and at some point it did because of the influence of the probability.
As I watch more and more videos about quantum mechanics, I am further convinced of the idea that the wave function is the universe's way of implementing lazy loading for optimization.   For clarity, lazy loading is the programming principle where resources or objects are not initialized until they are actually utilized.
If you want proof that non-organic material can coalesce into a living creature, you just have to look in the mirror.   So who’s to say the universe hasn’t become conscious?
So is he saying for example that gravity didn't existed till we discovered it or that our understanding of gravity for example is influenced by the way we approached it ???
Wheeler's idea sounds exactly how J J Abrams shows are written.
Wait, are you saying that if there was no dark energy we would or wouldn't collapse?
I'm not a physicist, but this video does exemplify why physicists need to stay out of philosophy. They are trying to apply laws in metaphysics and epistemology to particles, and I don't think they translate. Do this experiment with a real object we can iterate with - like a rock or a ball instead of a particle - and you will actually have my attention.
This is reminiscent of "lazy execution" in computer science, where a piece of state is generated on-demand instead of being computed every time there's a change to the system. For example, a rectangle defined by two points on a 2D plane, where the object is manipulated by moving the points around, but every 100 manipulations or so the program needs to query the width of the rectangle. The object can store a "dirty" flag, which indicates that its remembered width is out-of-date. Any time there's a change to a point, it sets the dirty flag to true, then when the width is queried it checks the flag. If the flag is false then it returns the previously calculated value, but if the flag is true then it calculates the width, remembers it, and sets the flag to false, then returns the result of the query. This makes the query itself more expensive, but because the query only happens 1% as often as the manipulations, it results in an overall savings, since the width isn't constantly being recalculated when there's no use for it.
Simple answer: Yes.  So why is this a mystery?
Great episode. Clearly the Matrix is real. Who agrees that Elon is Neo?
Thanks Matt.   I think in relation to these issues my 4th grade teacher's comment regarding myself is apt, 'can do better'.
I watched this while thinking about Steins Gate.
If you want to know the secrets of the Youniverse; *RorriMaesu says useaMirroR*
Any interpretation which seems to differentiate interaction and observation seems bogus to me.  Although the negative 20 questions concept sounds similar to the global wavefunction view, where something is possible if a component of the wavefunction is perpendicular to it (projector has non-zero braket). Then as the questions are asked, the observer component evolves into states reflecting the gain of information, and this time when we ask if something is possible, we attach projectors consistent with our information on the observer component.
Just when im eating dinner, perfect timing as always my friend!
The Universe brings space for the cosmos to creates life just to devour it.. it feeds on itself to create itself.  There's other types of observation besides seeing Energy is information Particles can observe themselves. Without particles what can we observe.  Particles observe us, as we are made out of atom's, down to quark's
There are only 2 genders, observable at conception.
im only 8 minutes in but im really in love with bohmian mechanics ever since your video on it. The way you said constructive/desctructive interference in the beam splitting segment really caught my ear. Perhaps (in pilot wave theory) the particle actually does travel just one of the paths but the wave it travels on gets split in 2. When it recombines, the particle meets the wave and takes the constructively interfering path.
So if our universe is a black hole, is the universe in which it is a black hole, also a black hole:)
This is a great philosophical question that has nothing to do with science.   Thanks.   It’s wooo without all the spiritual stuff.
Tree, forest, sound?
quantum physicists have wayyy too much free time on their hands
of course yes, all because of a small delay, since the speed of light is limited and the decay processes do not always have time to go. no, it's not a violation of symmetry
9:38 "It looks like Bob's choice of questions influences the past.  But it doesn't.  His questions are helping _us to agree on an aspect of perceived reality on the fly"_
First thing that comes to mind is that the universe behaves like a computer game that can scale encounters based on the players experience to keep it engaging.
So if reality has to be observed by something to exist, how did life even start at all? Surely if life didn't exist there wouldn't be any reality for it to get going at all. Its like the mother of all chicken and eggs.
I come hear/re to work out my brain/ane.

Hello spacetime
“Like some of the worst practitioners of quantum woo”. Lol. If you admit that the observer collapses the wavefunction, that is only a baby step away from saying that the observer has influence over it. Actually it is very unnatural to admit the former and not admit the latter.
Thx! So we are made of Planck size 2d event horizons shielding Sub-Planck size singularities rotating at Planck-vmax and plopping in and out of our Planck- realism  and  into Planck-improbabilities of bigger field scales. Tongue in cheek...yet Singularities of all scales is the time-space-main-product and define what we see in the universe.
Yeah, creates itself 🥴
Thank you, I have been describing these concepts recently and thanks for making a video describing it, its like my thoughts made you make this video...
Oh.. It's binary choices that defines reality. I wonder what type of machine could use binary relays to work....
Does any physicist really believe that reality requires an observer measurement to resolve?  I mean, they know the universe's age and they know how long humans have existed and thus who was observing/measuring all that resulted in the universe before humans arrived?
... does this have any meaningful distrinction from Many Worlds?
This is way above my pay grade, but to think that the wave function only collapses (If I'm tracking this right) when we measure it seems absurd. I didn't measure the sun burning. Nobody measured that before we were here. With no observers to measure surely reality still exists (e.g.  the Einstein comment early in the video). It also has this weird bias towards external observers when we are all part of the same system - there are no external observers. I think I'm too dumb for this topic!
the -20 questions game is also used in the book "consciousness explained" to describe at first, iirc, how dreams arise, and extended later to be a more general theory of how conscious experience in general arises. interesting, the parallel thinking about two seemingly very different subjects.
Alternate view: It makes sense that an "observation" is an interaction, no matter how weak -- no consciousness required. When a photon passes through a sheet of glass, some are absorbed, some come close enough to nuclei change path, these are real enough to interact. A matter particle which interacts with the fabric of spacetime itself making gravity -- go Einstein -- or changing the path of photons had better be real.  Woo woo alternative. God created the Universe by becoming the universe at Planck time 1. (As good a god hypothesis as any. Maybe better since it is indistinguishable from "something from nothing" at Planck time 1.)
It's all clearly a simulation, all paths are calculated but not all routes are played out. My NPC energy is sometimes strong. Is there a player1, are we a mmorpg?
Under this interpretation, I wonder if a strategy of avoiding testing sweeping questions where the answer could be just be "no" and we can't advance technology, and asking smaller questions where any one of their answers being "yes" means an advance in technology would work, increasing the opportunities to discover useful laws.
Does a lonely particle traveling through space thousands of light years away exist, if it doesn’t get hit or otherwise interacts with another particle ?
We are made of matter because the universe has matter in it. So it must be with consciousness. I ask is consciousness and matter separate? Is consciousness a separate thing from the universe? Is it an illusion? We know we all are conscious. So if its not separate from the universe it must be that the universe also has this feature or its intrinsic to it. We are consciouss because the universe has consciousness. If consicousness is separate then what does that mean we have souls? There is no way around whats mystical or metaphysical and physicists have to accept this
If someone has too much free time, please find out how many times they used Schrödingers Cat on this channel... so many poor kittens lost in boxes.
*smokes DMT one time*
Can you please discuss Hawking Points and Penrose's observations of black holes from pre-big-bang eons?
For me it seems like a discussion between 6 year olds if Santa does exist, because there are presents.
Before watching the video: oh no this is gonna be the Schrödinger’s cat argument re-skinned for modern physics, isn’t it… After watching the video: I was sort of right, but now my brain hurts.
Whoa whoa whoa... "Information implies a thing to know that information."??? It does no such a thing.  You're playing a semantic game here and a really bad one. Information is "data with meaning" and that's a human construct. Another way to look at it is "Information is APPLIED data." If I collect the temperatures of everyone on earth at exactly 1pm GMT, that's data. If I choose to ask "put them into 1 degree buckets" - I've changed the data into information. But the act of choosing doesn't require a human consciousness. If two balls strike each other, the data of their trajectories and momenta is measured at the moment of collision by the balls AS A SYSTEM providing information to determine the new outcome trajectories and momenta.   Wheeler is correct: it's the interactions that matter and are the measurements (or at least define them). When two electrons interact in such a way that their spin orientations MUST have a definite value, that causes a measurement to happen and the electrons to gain a state. The interaction IS the measurement. But to take it further, there is NO difference between the probe and the probed. Every "measurement" affects both parties, although not necessarily the same way or to the same degree.   Our measurements *look* conscious because WE are conscious and we choose the nature of the measurement. That's like going back to my temperature example and after measuring and binning handing the numbers to someone unaware of their origin and their looking at the results and saying "This is weird... none of the temperatures are below 34C or above 42C... and most of them are at at 37C. That's not natural - some mysterious is happening."  Wheeler's model (lord help me, I'm defending Wheeler) is not vague or wishy washy at all. In fact it's very concrete and simple. Having the universe be transactional and self-generating is vague and wishy washy.
Ah, yes...yet ANOTHER theory that vainly attempts to explain the universe without admitting that it cannot be done without some supernatural force standing outside the universe. Good luck with that. Prove it in a lab, then we'll talk.  😆
If we accept that reality needs to be the same across the universe, doesn't Wheelers model require a faster than light transfer of information? It seems that if one observation were to lock in a fundamental law, then all future observations would need to get the same result straight away everywhere. Otherwise you would arrive at a point where an infinite number of globes of information would collide with competing values where observations had happened in a different order and thus gotten different results.
dark matter is just matter running backwards in time and dark energy is reversed entropy. As the universe expands and all fractions of everything are infinitely spaces and infinitely ordered, entropy will reverse as the only constant and lead to a complete alignment of the all phenomana, time will reverse with the normality and measurablity of dark matter and energy, gravity being the warp of space time as a result of the relationship between our chronologically moving universe against the alternative universe which flows back to singularity. With each action influencing every state of the universe, the universe is allowed to experience everything possible whilst remaining in a cycle that reinforces its own existence, thus the universe is essentially a god created perpetual motion machine.
If it's not aliens or a simulation, it must be an alien simulation! (Or, maybe, a stimulated alien.) 😁
It is quite likely that the universe is Oroboric.  Black holes at the end of time (and, black holes are, by definition, the endpoints of time) are a closed timelike loop that feed back to the Big Bang white hole, however, per Roger Penrose and CCC, light from each iteration of the universe can cross this threshold, and since light can contain information, it can be encoded so that it has some non-negligible effect on the initial conditions of the next 'universe'.  Therefore, the history of the universe is one in which intelligent beings arise, realize the rules (that all energy and matter are fed backwards to the beginning of time through closed timelike loops in singularities), and then start manipulating light so that they can influence the next cycle by subtly changing the initial conditions in the Big Bang of the next universe, with the goal of re-creating themselves anew (i.e. "fine tuning" the universe so that conditions are just right to give rise to life, to intelligence, and finally to themselves).  Life is essentially a non-hostile Roko's Basilisk that only works through forward time feeds to the Big Bang using the ultimate expression of information technology - imprinting information onto photons themselves, and then sending that information through the singularity, back to the beginning  of time, to nudge the initial conditions of the universe such that it always continues to give rise to the very intelligence that set the whole thing in motion in the first place.  An Oroboros, that takes the entire history of the universe to realize. How many times have we done this already?
I mean…. Seems like Wheeler isn’t wrong, but also  seems impossible to prove him right. 🤔
These people you use in examples in your videos, am I supposed to know them? It feels like a reference I missed out on.
The “objective reality” is a stupid idea. We don’t know anything outside the bonds of our own minds. All perception is extremely abstract.
A drabble that I wrote some time back:  Einstein's Greatest Blunder  Forfax scanned the list of defects.  The Creator had hacked His creation together in a week. The rules were simple - dimensions had been created, then seas and land. A light source was set in motion and entities formed to inhabit the Earth.  On a whim the Creator had put a spark of Himself into an entity. Consequently it's offspring possessed consciousness. Forfax tweaked the universe as necessary when they found a flaw in the design.  An entity had proven relativity must exist and mistakenly introduced a cosmological constant. Failing to double check the math, Forfax set the universe in motion.
Why do the lightbeams in one direction cause destructive interference and in the other cause constructive interference? What is the variance between these two directions?
Question: Under this interpretation, does this mean that photons should be thought more of like a probablistic constructive ray trace from point of measurement? (So the measurement builds the reality, not the reliaty causing the measurement)   As in, in a extremely simple and young universe; the first measurement is made, it is that of a red photon, this in turn creates the possibility (however low) that one of the following, but not limited to, exists: -A thing that emits red photons all on its own -A thing that emits photons, that hit another thing that absobed it and emitted a red photon -A thing that emits blue photons, but is acceleating away so quickly the photon is red shifted -etc...  And as more measurements are made, that support one of those possibilties, the more likely it is to exisit, and because they'll be interacting off eachother, existance will eventually come to a semi-'agreed' upon state?
The absolute definition of Nothing, from any position within any Universe, cant exist. Ergo, any Universe has to
is it me or is his head bigger?
idk ask him
What is wrong with the Universe is a dataset. In a dead Universe where there are no observers (consciousness) the Universe is never observed and the data is never recorded, but does exist. In a live Universe where there are observers, some data is observed and recorded which does not preclude other data not observed from existing. The observer does not create or destroy data.
An 'Observer' could be water molecules on some random planet 100 million light years away reacting to its star's heat causing evaporation. Non-living things can be observers too.
Hey Space Timers! We are trying to learn more about our fans and what YOU want to see more of. If you have a moment to to fill out our 8 question fan survey (especially if you have episode ideas) please do so here: https://forms.gle/wS4bj9o3rvyhfKzUA
This remembered me of Constructor Theory - anyone else?
No. That makes no sense.
So could the laws of physics be generated by the probe vs probed as well?
Quantum Physics sez I matter!
Fun to see you mention that little interesting calculation about the mass of the universe and how the event horizon of a black hole would be the same size as the event horizon of the universe. When I did that calculation just for fun to discover that on my own.  But like you mentioned, it is not evidence for us being in a black hole.
Aaron Oconnel proved its interaction not observation, that collapses the wave function. Check out his Ted talk called "making sense of the quantum world"
Wonderful episode. Thank you.
OMG WELCOME BACK!!!
When you're already watching something else on youtube then the pbs spacetime alert hits.. Sorry, not sorry to whatever I immediately quit watching to tune in. 😌
I am GOD.
I always wondered if stretching space-time is the reason for matter existing. Kind of the manifestation of tears in the fabric.
All I know is that I don't know anything really
any focus on consciousness in quantum mechanics feels uncomfortable to me because unless we accept "souls", we have to think that consciousness is somehow special despite it having to be an emergent phenomenon of physics. are we constantly collapsing our own brains wave function?
if scientist would back track the scenarios and movement of primordial existence. and work forward in time to make a map of the movement of primordial existence. which they don't. and that's why the scientific community is speculating from theory and observed facts .which is unprovable.
For me, the talk about observer and observation is confusing because the terms are not defined. Observer surely cannot mean a living being - because what’s ”living”? And observation, interaction of some kind. Interactions with two or more wave functions? Universe surely does not need matter to exist, it emerges from those interactions?
All I have to say to Feynman is, "Don't tell me how to think about the universe."
All interpretations of quantum mechanics results from the double slit experiment. I always go back to the basic experiment in my head. I always have a lot of new questions to ask after running trough the tought experiment. After I try to answer these, I usually end up with a new interpretation.  But first two important issue needs to be clarified for me:   1) Does every event horizon have some kind of horizon radiation (virtual particles)? 2) When we examine a single photon's light cone, what happens at the border?  I have a lot a follow-up questions...
The -20 questions games kinda made me think the universe is actually running in reverse time except we can't remember the "past" only the "future"
Per Arthur Schopenhauer, the world is my representation, and the substrate is will.
Information State theory.... to the sanctums we go!
I was thinking about what would happen in the negative 20 questions game if the questions ruled out all possibilities. I suppose that would be equivalent to destructive interference.
Interaction eh? Sounds exactly like the Purusha and Prakriti told in the Vedas... as much of physics borrows from and starts with... love me some JA Wheeler.
I think so.  Really. I always have. Matter is like water shooting out of a garden hose. It will only stay together so far. It eventually breaks up into droplets. Matter is simply energy that has cool to solidification. Stars, planets, black holes are all just giant droplets. Who's to say the hose has been turned off. What if it pulses?  Hmmmmmm..........
I think this quote is from Wheeler, not Bohr.
I absolutely love how this channel does not shy away of this kind of topics. Big up
The presence of a mandate for self consistence implies a priori rules of some form independent of an observer effect, so we seem to only shift reality onto an as yet unresolved rule set.
im gonna take shrooms and rewatch this
The more interpretations of QM I hear, the more I realize that only the Many Worlds one makes sense to me.
imagine going to a 19th century physicist and telling them that 21st century physics is plagued by enormous nigh-unsolvable philosophical questions - but that we're also unsatisfied because our theories break down "only" before 10-³² seconds after the beginning of the universe
PLEASE!!!! NO RELIGIOUS COMMENTS!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
How does a participatory multiverse work? Do the individual universes observe each other, and we are just discovering what the answers they gave each other were? Is this how we get the slightly different cosmological constants/forces that are expected in a field of multiverses, and our set of forces and their measurements observed by another universe?
I don't get why he was concerned by consiousness. I think you even addressed this before on this channel. If you set up a double slit experiment with working detectors that don't actually tell anyone if they detected anything, you'll still see a change in the pattern on the screen.
My head is still spinning after watching this. I need a few minutes or maybe a lifetime to make that stop 😂
This reminds me of an argument I had with a friend who stated that time was created by our minds, and doesn't  actually exist.  I argue, to both him AND you, that without time (*existing regardless of our existence), space and therefore matter wouldn't exist. He brought up the observer effect too. My answer to that is: we didn't observe the formation of our star, solar system, or planet, yet here we are. Have we all simultaneously imagined not just matter into existence, but the whole history of time, even pre-human existence? How is the fact of not just written but for example geological history consistent over hundreds of years by hundreds of observers? I argue there IS objective reality, and applying the idea that we imagined it into existence is no less arrogant than religious geocentric beliefs. Who thinks we are so special the universe wouldn't exist without US? Horrendous arrogance.
The statistical description (Quantum statistics & decoherence/coherence) seems to explain away all the absurdities (Wigner's friend etc..). C'mon, no need to further mystisize these things, we live in the 21st century :)
Not a very good episode. Feels like you've cut in clips from a bunch of other videos you've already made. Reflecting upon whether or not the universe is some kind of JavaScript running constructor methods, instantiations etc etc is like the simulation hypothesis.   Untestable and not interesting to be honest. It's sci fi
no we created it
One possible solution to the 'observer problem' is panpsychism. Specifically, panprotoexperientialism, which basically asserts that there is a "proto-conscious" field that permeates all of reality, and would act as a universal, omnipresent 'observer' at all points in space.  Proto-consciousness therefore causes wave function collapse. It's a super weak field though, weaker even than gravity, and would only have an effect on quantum events where an observer made a difference.
This does not explain why, in my role as husband and father, virtually every observation I make is wrong.
Let's goo another Spacetime video 💪
Quantum mechanics is undeterministic so applying non quantum mechanical logic is not sensible because we don't know where will a quantum fluctuation pop up in X axis in time.
I am still unsure how "Its from Bits" is different to the concept of a multiverse where each "observation" branches, and all we're doing is determining which branch we're in. The act of observation is paramount to both isn't it?
This is veering into theology not science
Awesome
Super interesting and brilliant as your efforts always are. So simply keep going please, even though the results won't be simple at all.
How odd this is the ancient Jewish Concept that is discussed in the Kabbalah. As Divinity is the totality of infinity to include all things that the human mind can and cannot comprehend to include paradox and it is constantly creating the reality which we find ourselves but that the creator is also the creation. It's so nice seeing this. Then again Judaism and the scientific method has never been in odds. I've been seeing science popping up hypothesis that parallel the Kabbalah for decades now. I hope one day we can find ways to test all of this with real life experiments and real life observations.
The answer is of course *42*
The biggest problem with the real and even philosophical approach is that it has a fatal flaw. An imperfect observer. The reality in which we see is but a small subset of vibrational and electric signaling. Be subsets don't even encompass a large portion of those potential signals.  When we create a formula based on near-earth observations and try to even project them on the universe we make a grand assumption that what we see from the distance is the same as what we see right before us. But even then being so close we often make observations that have to be corrected with time.
11:05 is this a Boards of Canada reference?
Feynman + politely = lol
Quantum Woo.😆
Metaphysics is Nature trying to understand itself, but not having enough evidence to make a conclusion.
Charles Sanders Pierce’s philosophy may yet find its ultimate relevancy.
🤔🤔🤔 Hmm... Reminds me of that other thought experiment: Roko's Basilisk. Interesting.   🤯🤯🤯
Nice touch releasing this on 420
But..but..the trigger/detector in Schrödingers experiment that releases the poison is the "observer" or the info becomes know at that point not when someone opens the door? No?
I don't know, but in Soviet Russia, the universe creates you!
It's settled then.  The tree falling in the woods does not make a sounds if no one is around to hear it.  It is simultaneously fallen and not fallen until it is observed.
It feels to me like time kiiind of happens backwards. Like at some "end time event" requires each previous interaction which leads back to the big bang.  That's all of my close to sleep thoughts for the day. Good night.
There is no spoon....until I observe it to be so. Got it!
I believe that god created the universe
Is this idea contingent on observers being able to make choices (store and react to information) or just that there could be multiple unknown probable outcomes?
Yay, new bedtime story... German here 👋😁
I haven't watched this yet, but I immediately thought of Sir Fred Hoyle, from the title.
I have to ask..  Define the difference between measurement and interaction.  The universe interacts with itself all the time, collapsing wave functions.  "Measurement" does not make it any more real.  If A interacts with B or B interacts with A, depending on scale collapsing wave functions without us even measuring it.   Because we did not measure it does not make it less real.
Also, I want to point out that the "objective reality exists regardless of our subjective experience of it" is, by definition, a non-scientific claim. This is for logical and philosophical reasons, not because I suspect that the universe isn't actually real.  Here's the rub, in a nutshell: Scientists love to claim that science is completely empirically based. Empiricism means based on our perception - our senses. This, quite literally, means based on our subjective experience. The idea is that our sense experience is the most foundational knowledge we have of anything at all, and therefore the basis, the very foundation, of knowing itself. You know nothing, if not first through sensing something through one of your senses. Thus, empiricism. The world is sensed.  However, the twist in thinking that way, is that if you assume the basis of reality is sensory, then you are also assuming that it is subjective, because your sensory experiences are subjective.  In other words, you've simply given in to the solipsism idea.  The claim that reality is independent of any awareness of it is unfalsifiable by definition. If you aren't aware of it, then you can't make any claim about it whatsoever, and if you are aware of it, then you cannot make a claim independent of awareness.  Therefore, logically, reality cannot be claimed to be independent of awareness. I mean, it might be. It makes sense that it could be. But, according to the rules of falsifiability, it's an unscientific question, because there's no way you could ever device an experiment that shows that reality is completely independent of your awareness.  Solipsism is, in fact, irrefutable, at least on a logical, scientific basis. The world really could be just a delusion of yours, and maybe none of it has any existence apart from your mind. That may or may not be true, but you have no way to prove that it's true - and more importantly, there is no empirical way to prove it false.
ok that's absolutely disgusting idea
So if we want to travel faster than light we just need to keep looking for a way to do it and we will find it!  Cool.
Consciousness creates all reality. Including the universe (all of them).
I love physics
thank u for this amazing 420 special edition of spacetime
Why can't the change in state be the observation by the state? Any interference is an observation  We don't observe the double split experiment, the spliter does the observation by existing.
No.  It does not.  And other dimensions are not filled with bearded evil yous.  The problem really is the words "create itself."  This has implications of some form of intelligence.  "Is the Universe created from nothing?"  That's one we can discuss.  "Create itself" is just WAY too book of genesisy.
I guess we're all SAPs for PBS Space Time? "No consciousness but the distinction between the probe and the probed". Recite that the next time you go through airport security!
Yeah
If conscious observations create our universe and reality, then who was around at the big bang or at the time of cool down and re-ionization?
I thought it was David Mermin that said "Shut up and calculate!" Feynman said a few times that he found the whole thing to be on philosophically shaky ground, he just didn't have any sort of resolution that worked for him.
Does the universe create itself ? Let’s just assume for the sake of argument that II doesn’t. That implies that there is something beyond what we consider to be the universe which creates said universe. That, in turn, implies that what we considered so far as the universe is not actually the universe as a whole, in which case what we assumed initially to be the universe is merely a part of the actual universe. If we then assume said actual or « extended » universe as being in fact the universe, then by definition there is nothing beyond sad universe and therefore said actual universe can only be in one of two states: either it exists or it doesn’t. Since I think we can agree that it appears to exist, and since it cannot by definition have a source or cause outside of itself, then it can only be creating itself, by itself.
Please read Quentin Meillassoux - After Finitude as a nice critique to this "correlationalism" interpretation of reality as he calls it. Enjoying the read currently a lot, referring to Hume, Kant, and the relation between probability and set theory and the necessity or absurdity of contingency of physical law (in response to remarks by Hume and Kant, relating to consciousness).  BTW hint with Wheelers participatory universe: ancestrality is a problem; yes I got this from that book
I don’t know but it’s a bloody good question
This is kind of a tautological question. Of course the universe "creates itself", I mean inasmuch as you think the state of existence is "created" (as opposed to just eternally always existing).
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
420-appropriate title
I kept refreshing youtube, and here we are, seems real to me
first
Does intelligence requires a previously existing intelligent being to be possible, or can it naturally emerge in a reality devoid of intelligent beings (or intelligence in any form or manifestation)?
Time for another existential crisis with Matt.
Nope.
I have a fun thought experiment to illustrate this. :)

How did you commenters watch this 18 minute episode in under 5 minutes?
Perfectly mind-blowing topic for today
I believe by definition yes.
Do You look at the Universe, or does "It" look at itself through You?
FINALLY

Creationists are going to hate this.
Day made
it's only Spacetime where I expect videos with "woah dude" titles to involve hardcore physics
Love you cosmos
Boy, I sure hope so!
The microscopic synchronized mind control wormholes are getting feedback from your motor cortex neurons to adjust their positioning to capture signals more accurately even when moving. The motor cortex is sampled at a higher priority than the rest of your brain because this way the extra universal artificial intelligence can predict your movement and adjust wormhole sample rate and position.

Hi
