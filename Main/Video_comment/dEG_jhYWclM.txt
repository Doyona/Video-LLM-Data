Daisy Jones & The six 10/10 It’s based on true story. I love anything based on a true story/back story! This was an amazing series.The story, songs, acting , plot and the quality of the show is a masterpiece . I love the fact that they created the music with the actors singing! I really loved the show. it war rollercoaster of emotions.(Layan)
i literally just finished the book two minutes ago and i am SO ready to see my fictional band come to life
CAME BACK HERE AND STILL THE BEST
Let's all agree prime video is the best at bringing book characters to  life!!!.... This is sooooo...GOOD!!!!!!!....can't wait 2 drive ryt in...
What song she was Sing in these vídeo?
Is this homage for Fleetwood Mac?
I’m probably in the minority but I found the relationship between Karen and Graham more enjoyable in the series. I get Billy and Daisy are the focal point but their initial constant fighting and arguing started to wear thin but thankfully Episodes 9 and 10 redeemed it. To each his own
That sideways look Riley gives ar the end of this clip, you cam a absolutely tell who her grandaddy is. ❤
1:14 she looks exactly like Elvis and Lisa Presley right there with the side eye!!!
I think I’m the only one that hasn’t read the book therefore my expectations are just based on the show itself which I love ❤️ my personal opinion so far is the whole kind of Documentary thing I’m not feeling it. I think it would’ve been better to experience everything new with them.  But no big deal this show is amazing and the cast is fantastic when I heard that Riley keough was playing Daisy Jones I was thrilled. Riley read the book and fell in love and thought she’d give it a go. I love her voice you can hear Lisa Marie she said that she channeled her mom who gave Riley inspiration
I know Lisa Marie Presley is so proud of her amazing daughter Riley Keough. This young lady is so beautiful and talented. Cant wait to watch this movie. ❤️😊❤️
Heard this was inspired by Fleetwood Mac
hard pass
1:10  Stolen from Petula Clarks " Downtown"
One dayyyy before it is showwn
Could’ve just made a Fleetwood Mac biopic.
RILEY KEOUGH
Go ahead and regret me, but I've beaten you to it dude.
I smell fleetwood mac… must be brilliant!
literally never been so excited in my life
I’ve been looking for an audiobook that matches the one for this book and i simply cannot find one
For some reason this gives me the same thoughts as an Evangelical Church worship team does. And trust me that is not a good thing this is going to suck
My joker
I apologise for the person I am gonna become when this comes out
Well the apple doesn’t fall fall far from the tree in the case of Riley Keough!  Mamma Lisa Marie Presley and Grandpa Elvis Presley would be proud ! 😊
Im so excited! I wish I could watch this tonight!!
This looks amazing - the new trailer looks TERRIBLE
This book was in my tbr for forever. And I finally read when I saw the teaser because I wanted to read the book first 😂😂
Just finished the book and I'm so excited for this series especially for the songs to come alive!  Even though I imagined all the characters to look different lol but I hope I'm still going to love it
they all look like how i imagined them to look like while reading im crying
the elevator scene 😭💔
Fleetwood mac?!
DAISYBILLY AHHHHHHH
OH MY GOD IT LOOKS SO GOOD
Sounds like Fleetwood Mac to me
I hear this is loosely based on Fleetwood Mac, is this true?
This looks amazing! I thought it is like a biopic hahaha!
The amount of times I’ve watched this isn’t even funny
Preciso.
so um i need to finish the book before march 23, thanks. 😍
I have been wishing for an adaptation of this movie since I started reading it!!! I get to see all the songs come to life?? IT'S RELEASING ON MY BIRTHDAY?!??!?
I AM SCREAMING, SCREAMING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope they don’t ruin the book. I just can’t wait to hear all the songs that I visualised how they’d sound while reading the book.
Somehow they cast the perfect actors
SO EXCITED! HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
I hope they film the scene where they're shooting the cover.
Please let the Malibu rising be next
This is the PERFECT CAST, perfect vibe, everything. This looks exactly like what I pictured when reading this book. I am beyond excited and the fact that it’s a series too !?!? WTH❤
arrepiei
She kinda looks like Florence
This gives off major almost famous vibes.
This is like mostly fleetwood mac with a little bit of Florence and the machine
sam claflin is the perfect billy dunne
I just can’t get over the fact Elvis’s granddaughter is playing Daisy Jones 😍 0:20 is such an Elvis vibe 👑
God bless
clearing my schedule for the first week of march because i know I'm going to be a goddamn wreck
OH MY GOD I CANNOT WAIT  literallydying to watch this rn!
One of my favourite books of all time has been brought to life and I couldn't be more excited
CANT WAIT <33
AaAaAaAaAa
OMG OMG OMG omgggggg
GOTTA GO REREAD THE BOOK AND LISTEN TO THE AUDIOBOOK FOR THE 10th time
IM SO EXCITED WHATTHEFUQQQ
exactly what I imagined
omg
OMG OMG OMG I AM HYPERVENTILATING THIS IS TOO MUCH
OMG ACTUALLY DIEING
why tf did they change the lyrics to regret me. No "when you think of me I hope it ruins rock and roll"??? I just looked at the album and they took out like all of the songs. I'm so mad
Going absolutely feral I am so excited
I'M SO READY
taylor jenkins reid rocks 😭💅🏻
I just finished reading the book and OH MY GOD when "regret me" started playing -- _chills, literal chills!_
SAM CLAFLIN MY LOVE
Oh my God!!!!
WHEN SHE SANG "REGRET ME" OMG OMG OMG
Waiting for my Evelyn Hugo😪
I really hope they do the brilliance of the book justice. Such a shame Daisy Jones wasn't cast as Daisy though. Notice how it says it's a New Series and not a Season? Good.  Any idea of who's written the music?
OMGOMGOGMOG
It's pretty cool to see Suki Waterhouse and Sam Claflin on screen together again :)
IN SO EXCITED TO MEET ALL OF THEM OMG I'VE NEVER WANTED A TV SHOW MORE THAN THIS
omfg I have to see this
Just finished the book last week...I CANNOT WAIT.
HOLY SHIT
Me before this: shelving the book to collect dust with hopes of reading it someday soon..   "FOMO" me After seeing this: 🏃🏾‍♀️ 🏃🏾‍♀️ 🏃🏾‍♀️ 🏃🏾‍♀️ 🏃🏾‍♀️ to read "Daisy Jones..." ASAP.
I've been loving Riley since The Runaways. Looking forward to read the book first before seeing this movie!
OMGGGG!!!!😭😭 DUDE I SERIOUSLY CAN'T WAIT OMG
She loooks like tov lo, is that tov lo?
this is everything ive ever wanted and more
IT LOOKS SO AMAZINF OMF
goddamnit imma have to get amazon prime now huh
I’ve been waiting to hear these songs for FOREVER
I AM SOOOO EXCITED
I cannot wait to hear the soundtrack 😭
i swear, idk why im crying. watching my favourite book characters come to life is making me so emotional. this teaser is everything i expected of the show. 3RD MARCH, HERE WE COME!
I am one of the few people who doesn't love the book but this does look awesome
I adore not just the book but the full-cast audiobook. They really made the band feel completely real, and there were so many moments when the history was so clear, it was like being nostalgic over something that never existed. I hope this show captures that same feeling.
Please, I hope this is better than the book, I hated the ending
So this isn't a real story (cause I've never heard of this band) but a fictional band?? Confused. Music sounds great though.
So excited i will throw up when it comes out
My freaking hearttttttt 😭😭😭
this looks so good omg, i can't wait!
This remains one of my favorite books. Been waiting for this for years. Riley Keough looks like a fantastic Daisy Jones. Looks like they changed the time in between, so that gives room for something extra at the end... One can hope! Can't wait!  Also, her smirk at the end kills me! Can't stop replaying
DAISY JONES SAME DAY AS MY HARRY SHOW WOW WOW
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGHHHHHHGHGHHGGHGHGHGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH im excited
Omfg I can’t wait
they made this series for me yall
Necesito verla ya!!🤩🥰
A love triangle so original.
fingers crossed they will do the book justice
Interesting
Not sure if we needed a 'series' as I think the book reads like a VH1 What ever happended to? episode... but OK
Band that big, somebody should be playing sax.
İ'M SO EXCİTED WOAAAHHHH
I want to see SNL performance and the moment when she changes the lyrics of honeycomb in climax on the screen so badly!!! 😩😩😩
i just read the book and really enjoyed it, cool that it's getting an adaptation! looks and sounds really good <3
Se abra inspirado el autor en la historia de Fleetwood Mac para crear este libro?
SHUT UP IM SO EXCITED
i literally just finished the book like 2 weeks ago, it's one of the best that i've ever read in my life. very excited for this!
I can't wait!!!
the adrenaline rush i got omg!!!! i can't wait to see these characters, the songs come to live <3
Omg 😱
GO AHEAD AND REGRET ME GO AHEAD AND REGRET ME GO AHEAD AND REGRET ME IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SONG FOR FOREVER
THIS LOOKS AMAZING
OMFGGGG
SUKIII
sooooo excited for this :)
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A BIOPIC
Ive never felt such intense love for a trailer that it physically brought me pain. Well done, I absolutely cannot wait for this to be out
After the disappointing This ends with us casting, this is a breath of fresh air
The girl who play’s Daisy’s voice is so good!!! The songs and the quality of the show make me excited to watch! It honestly felt like a documentary because the acting, lighting, costumes, etc. looked amazing! 😁😁
OMGGGGGGGGGGGG I'm gonna pinch myself really hard
🥰🥰🥰
Is this not just Fleetwood Mac?
I didnt like the book but this looks good
Chills
SPOILER... [i guess?!?!]            omg we have actual songs for the lyrics in the the end of the book!!
This looks good
I’ve never been more excited for something in my entire life
OH MY GOD
screaming crying and throwing up THIS IS EVERYTHING I WANTED
I thought the book was honestly just okay, and I hated that you couldn't listen to the actual songs because, well, the band is fictional. But turning it into a film is such a good idea
wow. literal goosebumps.
Ok but how accurate is that Daisy to how we all pictured her it’s so uncanny omg
Sad that her mum isn't alive to see it. I think she would have been so proud. Looking forward to seeing this.
Ah it looks so good!
So exited but I'm even much more excited for the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo!!
this is my joker
oh my god bro i’m so damn excited 😭
im ngl this teaser looks like it was made on iMovie ..
Her outfits and performances give me huge Florence Welch vibes
im in the aurora chapter now..I should really finish the book before this one comes out!!!! can't wait!
I'm so excited the book's adaptation is finally releasing soon!!
im gonna be the most annoying person you have ever met when this comes out
This looks INSANE!!! I can’t wait
MY FAV FICTIONAL BAND OF ALL THE TIMES IS NOT FICTIONAL ANYMORE!!!
I JUST GOT GOOSEBUMPS
How many times has this sort of warts and all Rock N roll biopic been done?
I'm just so happy I finally get to hear all these songs
Loved the book so much. Really hoping this ends up being good and not disappointing. We'll see. Fingers crossed
Reminded me back in the sixties & seventies,acting,music,seems to be an ok movie to see
Everyone Read or listen to this masterpiece of a book on audio before u watch this!!!! This book is Perfection!!!  U cannot possibly understand the excitement of this adaption unless u experience the magic of this story. I really hope they stick to the original story! Ahhhhhhhh SO. DAMN. EXCITED!!!
i'm begging this series to be as memorable as the book
I absolutely loved the book so I am so so so excited for the show because this looks spectacular
PHYSICALLY I AM NOT OK
Riley Keough! I adore anything with her in it, such a gem. I just wish I knew how to pronounce her last name. I say "Kee Ow"
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Finally!!!!!
This looks spectacular, can´t wait!!!!!!
Is this a series adaption from a book, that's about a band, that is fictionally based on Fleetwood Mac?? Also if that's the case, it's pretty cool that Elvis's granddaughter gets to play someone who was an inspiration from Stevie Nicks. I guess Rock'n'roll always finds it's way through and through.
this is everything I've ever wished for. IT LOOKS SO GOOD !!!! IM CLEARING MY SCHEDULE FOR MARCH 3RD
Looks loosely based on Fleetwood Mac
i am going to sob when i hear them sing honeycomb together for the first time, hell i'm already sobbing seeing them come alive in this teaser
THIS IS PERFECT I CANT WAIT AHHHHHH
Can’t believe how much she sounds like her mum when singing
Omg! I have no words to express my excitement
THE SONGS!!! WE ARE FINALLY HEARING THE SONGS EVERYONE!!!!
File under dreck
I actually cannot breathe
OH MY FUCKING GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DAISY JONE ZND THE 6 IS REAL.
THIS COULD NOT BE MORE PERFECT
omg they kept the same documentary style
Omg dreams DO come true!!!
YEEEESSSSS
i'm so excited oh my god i actually can not emphasize how excited i am
Been waitin a long time for this, let's goooo!😝
I LOVE the budget that is going into this!! This is going to be fantastic!
desperate for this to be good 🤞🏻
Oh I’ve seen this, it’s called Almost  Famous
THE OVERDOSE SCENE!!! THEY CHANGED IT
Yeah...lets remake a star is born and just rename it
I imagined Daisy different. More sth like Dakota Johnson vibe, but still can't wait to watch it
70’s rock is about to come back
I've gotten sick of all of these movies about real musicians, and I think a lot of other people are too. This looks like a breath of fresh, fictional air!
I’ve never been more excited for something!!!!
Finally, IT'S REAL. DAISY JONES AND THE SIX ARE REAL
OH MY GOSH
Is this any different from homelander and the seven ?
Riley Keough is a good actor
super excited for this one but a little worried about the change of the lyrics!! hopefully we get to hear "when you think of me i hope it ruins rock n' roll"
DAISY JONES VOCE SEMPRE SERÁ FAMOSA!
I’m ready!
Riley do it ❤️🤞🙏🏻. Became a real singer. We want it.
This is so exciting! 🙌🤩
Maybe because its her relation to Priscilla and Elvis Presley, Riley Keough looks like old Hollywood charm to me. Perfect vibe for Daisy 😍😍😍
Somebody wasted money on this rubbish.......smh!
SCREAMING AND CRYING AT THE SAME TIME
I DIED DEAD
“when you think of me, I hope it ruins rock and roll.” I need to hear this on screen 😭❤️
Spinal Mac?
THE KAREN AND GRAHAM ELEVATOR SCENEEE
AN ACTUAL BAND NOW. TEARS.
The fact that the girl playing Daisy is Lisa-Marie Presley’s daughter makes this trailer extra special 😢
WHAT WHAT WHAAAAAAAT OMGG
CACETEEEEE TÔ ANSIOSA DMS
this looks worth a watch; but, i'd rather they'd done this with the real fleetwood mac
I loved this book! So excited that this is becoming a tv show! I definitely can see some influences from Fleetwood Mac!
1:04 sensational
aaaaaaaaa
cannot wait for this one! let's gooooooooo
Fleetwood mac
BRB gonna ball my eyes out
My dream is finally coming true 😭😭 I've read the book when it came out in 2019 and since then I can't help but want to listen to all the songs live by Daisy Jones and The Six! I'm just too happy. Can't wait to watch the series 😭
i'm so excited !!! it's been so many years. however i kinda wish they had used to regret me from the book. there's a cover of this song on youtube and it's so fucking good
I don’t know anything about the story just yet, but Riley Keough! So excited for her, she always excels in the roles she’s in. Can’t wait!
yes yes yes
IM SO EXCITED
YASSSSS
THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING CANNOT WAIT !!!!!

IMPECÁVEL
i'm so excited but i wish daisys casting was more accurate 😓 the only thing similar riley has to book daisy is the hair and small figure
I CANNOT WAIT😭🤍
I remember loving this book when I had read it a few years back and thinking how it's perfect for a series. I don't remember much but I'm sooooo excited to relive the story of the best fictional band!
Very cool! Can't wait to see it!
Excited doesn't cover it. This is going to be HUGE.
we will be streaming
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
i'm so excited
I need the soundtrack as sound as the show comes out!!!!!
Screaming
So they wanted to do a Fleetwood Mac show, but didn't want to spend the money for it
cantttt waiitttt omg need it NOWWWWWWW
For the book readers out there... We've been waiting for this for years now, I feel youS 😭❤️😎
I am currently reading the book! I am so excited for this
I finished the audiobook a couple weeks ago. So freaking for this and to hear the music😍
This looks great, looking forward to it ✌️
I am FERAL

acheio meio paia, copiou o livro.
Is this about Fleetwood Mac? It's definitely giving FM vibes.
RAHHHHHHHHHHH
IM CRYING ACTUALLY SOBBING
Timothy Olyphant?!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
So this may be an unpopular opinion but I thought the book was terrible. It was totally up my alley, Daisy just doesn’t actually have great qualities as a protagonist. Little rich girl who was neglected by her parents ok so what else?  Had I not read the book I’d probably be pretty stoked.
ready to make this my entire personality for the whole of 2023
i’m actually gonna shit myself
this is going to be CRAZY
MEUUUUUUU, SURTO, PÂNICO, TREMEDERA, MEU EU VOU DESMAIAR ESTOU EM ABSULUTO PÂNICO
The book was okay so I hope they can elevate the source material and make this a great show. It has Finnick so I’m confident
Im soooo excited. !!!!
Manooooo tá perfeito
Que esse filme seja tão bom quanto o teaser! Amém!
this is my joker.
no estoy soportando, ya NECESITO <3
stop i’m literally crying i love this book so much
This is wild, dangerous and amazing
This is so real that seams unrealistic after reading it
SO EXCITED FOR THIS
Loosely based on Fleetwood Mac?
karen and daisy the next it-girls
this is my joker.
Can't wait for this!
no puedo esperar más
I'm so nervous. They better not fuck up this book
Dios se ve hermoso
