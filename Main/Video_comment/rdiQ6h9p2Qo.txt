It's Kathy from sleep well in the car that says:"Let's paint your house"
from 2025.
So that's the universe where y'all reside in? No wonder we see y'all so few.
No cry😅

2:01
Aw man I can’t vandalize things

This actually made me cry because the story is actually deep. The animation, the lyrics, everything is just... words I can't even explain.
Peak lives two years ago

Oh, look, Sokka's girlfriend
And yet, I never forgot about this peak
I just found a new song obsession. IT LITERALLY HAS MY FAVORITE ARTISTS ALL IN ONE SONG AND IT'S AWESOME 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I hope someday i can inspire people the way this song inspires me.

Sounds like green's jam too from AvM😭✌️
This song caught me in the middle of a depression 2 years ago and it sank me even further 👍
I can't believe cg5 cried while watching this
Nooooo 2:15
genuinely made me cry
WT...is bill cipher???
I came back after nearly 3 years, I don’t care what anyone says, this is CG5s best work.

This song alone gave me hope to still be in this world... This song made me feel the most powerful and this song was a  light in my dark shadows... Thank you for blessing us with this song CG5...
Aloo khaoge

0:41 LOOK AT THE BILL CHIPHER GRAFFITI!!!
I love this so much I'd have to guess the roles are cg5 singing oreo is the extra one that sings at the end and the living tombstone is the one for the music in it I would think cg5 and oreo were the ones who did the animation but anyways I love it good job❤

I watched this a few years ago and was like... "what is this video about?" Today, I came to rewatch it to see all the references to media I like, and I think I get the deeper meaning now. Thanks, CG5
umh... guys... i fall in love...
Y-yeah i totally didn't almost start crying...
i saw jellybean at the beginning of the song
Lyrics ❤❤   Moving on, moving on It doesn't really matter My brain follows a pattern Forget about it Breaking up, breaking down You think it'll get better, but it never does  I feel like I'm dying Nobody tells me I'm lying Couldn't hear when I was crying It's defeating when I'm trying To forget about it All the silence getting louder And louder and louder Maybe I'll forget about it Ba-dadadada  HEADACHE   I'm spending every day Wishing I was okay Surrendered to a world of gray (Hey) My car is broken down I can't get out of town So I'll walk along a road of shame  Headache  All my thoughts are getting scattered Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it (to forget about it) All the silence getting louder And louder and louder Maybe I'll forget about it Ba-dadadada x2 (Woahh) Maybe I'll forget about it

2:08 top 10 saddest anime deaths 😢
For those who don’t really understand some of the story, basically the guy you see in this video is named Flint, who is passionate about creating art with graffiti, and is very good at what he does.   He comes across a box in an alleyway with an adorable living orb creature. It is a very happy creature, and its special power is bringing its happiness to anyone that encounters it. The little orb physically passes through Flint’s heart, and he is brought an extreme amount of power, providing a new feeling of euphoria he’s never experienced before.   He drops everything he is doing to spend all his time with the orb, so that he can receive more of its power. However even after all these positive feelings, Flint finds himself in an extremely depressive state, to the point where no matter what the magnitude of the orb’s power, Flint cannot receive the same happiness that he was in the beginning.   He is exhausted, and eventually gets very angry for no reason, putting himself in immediate danger. On top of that, the orb’s power starts to weaken, because it cannot bring its keeper any more joy. But it tries its best to pick Flint up. It gives him his paint spray can, of which he can create graffiti with, but he cannot bring himself to do it at all. Flint has lost his love for his craft, because of all the time he spent receiving power from the orb.   He is almost entirely decrepit, and he knows why. And so does the orb. So the orb disappears, and Flint is forced to let go. But in the end, his contentment, his passion, it all comes back to him, and he is once again free.
I Like it its cooll im a boy
Or3o Might Have Hit The Highest Note In The Background Music in 1:45

I have been listening to this song for about 8 months now. I never bothered to check the description. Today I saw the docs link attached and read it. My appreciation for the song blew up and I feel so sorry for those who can relate to it. Hope everyone finds immense happiness and navigate through their troubles
Good song ❤

This is such an interesting way of showing drug use. It’s showing his psychology going through the drugs. At first, it was great for him. But eventually, it made him almost to suicide. This is such a powerful message if you think about it.

Ever since it came out I’ve been listening to it banger dude
1:26 METTATON???
How are there so many references in one video
LYRICS:   Moving on, moving on, It doesn’t really matter, My brain follows a pattern. Forget about it. Breaking up, breaking down, You think it’ll get better, but it never does.  I feel like I’m dying. Nobody tells me I’m lying. Couldn’t hear when I was crying. It’s defeating when I’m trying To forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.  I’m spending every day, Wishing I was okay. Surrendered to a world of gray. Hey. My car is broken down, I can’t get out of town. So I’ll walk along a road of shame. Headache!  All my thoughts are getting scattered. Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.       Yes I did copy this deal with it
i knew it wss gonna be a banger when i saw OR3O was in it
Describe the vibes 😊
I love this song ❤
Jelly bean is there!
W animation, W song. THIS IS GREATT. YOU GUYS DID GREAT!
ggfgdgdfjfshfd
And that sircle was drugs...(peak story completion)
I can’t believe I missed this…   I’ve been diagnosed with High anxiety (specifically GAD) and have been since I was 3. But what I can appreciate so much is how the music is so deep and the visuals connect so well that I couldn’t have even imagined this was about Flint’s struggle with anxiety…   Yet still on a personal level I can somehow relate to him. Great job CG5, and a massive congratulations to the rest of the team. Sorry for missing the debut.
Who here in 2025
I rlly loved this song I met me at a deeper level but it did end a bit sad 😁

I love your music!!
1:26 is that mettaton form undertale!!!
HELP THE WALTER WHITE PART-
😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭
Wait a minute it’s sad jellybean ?
SLAY!!
This a theory: The little glowing ball gets rid of unhealthy stuff, or, like, stuff that harms people, ex; a gun. Some people consider graffiti a crime, so the little glowing ball makes the guy not want to use the spray-can so itll be more healthy or something. But even when it is healthier, it's affecting the guy's mental health, but when he tries to spraypaint again, when the glowing ball went through him, it prevented him from spray-painting, and when the guy cried, it made the glowing ball disappear because he wasnt happy, like the glowing ball, wanted.
Did someone notice jelly bean on the pole? 0:03
Can never 4GET  this!

Nice video bro i like the animation
0:00
In the srart
I saw jellybean
This is the saddest music video in my life😢😢😢😢😢
This song hits so hard by itself, but with the music video it hits so much harder 😭
This song is so good but the story about the spray paint ghost and the human is sad
This gives the feeling of making a new friend, spray painting in a alleyway, until you both start hanging out regularly, until at the middle, you start to ignore them due to wanting to do your own stuff. Your new friend tries to convince you to stay, only for you to ignore them and push them away, till you realize what you’ve done. You run without knowing what you’re doing, running into the road, realizing a car is passing by. Your friend pushes you out the way, sacrificing their life to save yours. In the end, you rush them to the hospital, but it’s too late… At the end, the very end of the character trying to paint the drawings that are turning gray with color again is how he’s trying to save him, knowing there’s nothing to save. At the end when the light shines on the drawings, returning their color shows how even tho he’s gone, the memories they both made *would forever stay with the surviving character.* Absolutely beautiful.
Jellybean trying to get off of a pole in the beginning was hilarious
0:47 that head bob made it so much more realistic

I love this ❤❤
This song is the equivalent to the Japanese songs (like racing into the night by yaosobi) where the song sounds so happy but the lyrics are depressing/sad
ngl this reminds me of when u lose a toxic friend u were really attached to and it seems like u cant forget about them but you hope u will
anybody else realize the characters hair slowly went from dark blue to a light grey, i cant figure out why this happened lol
i used to listen to this song like crazy when it came out.  i came back this year and found out what the song was about, and that i had experienced something like that during the time i forgot about this song.  this song brings a tear to my eye

Who is a sigma and did not cry and saw jellybean
My interpretation: the orb is optimism. That's why she feels happy when it flies through her. But, as she remembers the silence waiting for her, she rejects optimism, thinking that this world is doomed. And as she rejects the positive, it's influence diminishes, that's why it disappears. But, it's not fully gone, that's why she smiled when she sees the moon; there's always tomorrow.
Clark David Gonzalez Brian Wilson Linda

This song has so many emotions in it so the lyrics are basically about anxiety and trying to forget about it. The orb in the video is basically joy and while we watch the video he is happy but soon starts to not be as happy because he is ignoring the orb a bit and at the end he feels no joy after he almost gets hit by a car and all his anxiety hits him. At the very end the orb disappeared and for some reason he starts to be happy??? Idk but that's basically what the song is about.

0:42 a bill cipher!
*me trying to find every. single. reference. in this video.*  i love this song. i can kinda resonate with it. just trying to forget about all the problems and anxiety in life. trying to ignore all the negativity. just trying to avoid bad things in general. but sometimes you cant. sometimes you end up sitting in the corner of your bedroom, in your hoodie and sweatpants, just wondering. what is it all for? where has your life gone? it seems like just a day ago you were graduating from fifth grade, excited but anxious for the future. sometimes, you just dont know what to do, where to go, etc. and its okay to ask for help. everyone should have someone to talk to. you deserve to be loved and accepted.
when i saw this i INSTANTLY thought of the living tombstone song :iv'e got no time: did anyone else think of that or am i just crazy?
bro its been a year and evry time i still cry
Let me cry with u yall 😭
I haven't listened to this song in a long time, I would listen to it when I was depressed....I still am.....but anyways it brought back some memories.....bad ones...but this song is awesome and amazing and the first ever time I listened to it I cried because I had so much like emotional connection to it...but I am happy that you made this. Keep it up. 😀

Accidentally clicked on it and thought it was an ad
I'm struggling too man. I just escaped my father, who physically, mentally, verbally, and emotionally abused me. But I know I'll be OK, and I know that you will too, for whatever you go through. In the end, most things really are growing pains, and they shape us into whoever we're meant to be
When kahoot has a new lobby music be like:

The lryics: (Im only doing this for fun btw)    Moving on, moving on, It doesnt really matter. My brain follows a pattern. Forget about it   Breaking up, breaking down. You think it'll get better but it never does....   I feel like im dying. Nobody tells me im lying. Couldn't hear when i was crying. It's defeating when im trying to forget about it. All the silence is getting Louder. And louder And louder..... Maybe ill forger about :)        I'm spending every day. Wishing i was okay Surrendered to a world of gray... (Hey!) My car is broken down. I cant get out of town. So i'll just walk along the road of shame.. (HEADACHE) All my thoughts are getting scattered. Am i madder than a hatter? Climbing up an end less ladder to forget about it. All the silence getting louder And louder And louder (Maybe ill forget about it) Maybe ill forget about it     The end

Did you make this animation?????!!!?!!!!!!!!
Мой комментарий под русским кавером:  Кажется, это уже давно не актуально, но переслушав я увидел для себя такой сюжет:  Главный герой имеет свои проблемы, от которых уходит в рисование. ("Да забей, да забей"). Когда картина была готова, он находит в переулке в коробке, так скажем, счастливый порошок и пробует его по неопытности с встречами с такими вещами. (Белый шарик проходит сквозь него). "Тишина звучит всё громче, и громче, и громче. Может мне забыть об этом?" - действие веществ на сознание героя, который пока не видит в этом ничего плохого, если ему стало хорошо. В каком-то смысле его жизнь действительно становится легче, но он становится зависимым. Спустя время можно увидеть, как нарk0тики сказались на здоровье героя (седина, 2:07 буквально "ранен"). "Печаль в душе растет сильней" - та самая маленькая легкая доза уже не дарит то счастье, что и раньше. "Мысли в голове всё тише, чувство будто сносит крышу" - подтверждает теорию о употребляемых веществах. "Бесконечно лезу выше, чтоб забыть об этом" зависимый герой принимает сильнодействующие препараты, чтобы вновь вернуть то чувство радости и счастья. "Тишина звучит всё громе, и громче, и громче... Может мне забыть об этом?" - те ощущения снова ощущаются после употребления, но герой начинает сомневаться в том насколько правильно то, что он делает. Часть, где его сбивает машина и, можно сказать, вся жизнь пролетает перед глазами. И тут до него доходит. Он смотрит на выпавший "пакетик" из своего кармана (на шарик в клипе) и впадает в ужас. Что-то ведет его в то место, где всё началось, герой находит свои старые балоны с краской, хочет вновь успокоиться как ранее делал с помощью рисования, но впадает в еще большую панику, вспоминая что именно из-за этого всё началось. (Кидает банку. Этот момент можно видеть по разному, я вижу так). В конце, когда выходит луна, он понимает, что можно быть счастливым и без вреда себе таким спорным способом.   Моя дурная фантазия, где ты была раньше? Вряд ли кто заметит мой комментарий теперь :P
1:26 METTATON??
Okay I'm sorry but AIN'T NOBODY GONNA TELL ME THIS ISN'T THE GAW DAMN BEST SONG IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE

What buket
I saw that pink mustache and thought "oh its just BUMBUM"
Idk but what I think why he was crying when he cant spray paint. Maybe its how he expresses himself and the yellow ball is how he expressed himself and I think the character also has anxiety and got tired so he ran away from the ball thingy to be alone only to get in trouble with the spray paint colourless to not express himself and the yellow ball to express himself too maybe that's why he brokw?
0:01  is that the dream smp 😮

Bro, why was I crying at the end😭! Charlie 😭
dang is it just me or it feels so fast that this song is already a year old
2:18 I, a gravity falls fan and a CG5 fan has been summoned.
4GET is a song written about the crippling anxiety that I have always fought through in my life, either during or moving on from a relationship. I have a pattern of overthinking, and I feel like that hasn’t ever changed. The feelings I go through in the middle of dating someone that I’m actively unsure about can be damaging, and I have to console with a counselor or friends in order to actively figure myself out. I’m unable to do the things that I love doing when I’m in this mindset that can’t be truly cured until I end things with a potential partner. I’m working on that to this day. So I wanted to write this song for anyone that can relate, but in whatever way it speaks to them, not just to my specific situation. Many of us overthink, but maybe we’ll forget about it. I created this song closely alongside The Living Tombstone. It was always a dream of mine to work with Yoav and Sam, and now I’m proud to call them my friends and close business partners. I brought OR3O on as well, because we’ve worked together and been friends since I started out in my career. She is a wonderful singer, and I’m grateful for her participation on this important original song. The animation was created by a massive team of talented industry professionals. I came to a group of them to discuss the video’s concept, which I basically thought up right before we got into that meeting. They spent a year on this project, and I couldn’t have done this without all of them. The story follows the protagonist, Flint, who is passionate about creating art with graffiti, and is very good at what he does. He comes across a box in an alleyway with an adorable living orb creature. It is a very happy creature, and its special power is bringing its happiness to anyone that encounters it. The little orb physically passes through Flint’s heart, and he is brought an extreme amount of power, providing a new feeling of euphoria he’s never experienced before. He drops everything he is doing to spend all his time with the orb, so that he can receive more of its power. Eventually, even after all these positive feelings, Flint finds himself in an extremely depressive state, to the point where no matter what the magnitude of the orb’s power, Flint cannot receive the same happiness that he was in the beginning. He is exhausted, and eventually gets very angry for no reason, putting himself in immediate danger. On top of that, the orb’s power starts to weaken, because it cannot bring its keeper any more joy. But it tries its best to pick Flint up. It gives him his paint spray can, of which he can create graffiti with, but he cannot bring himself to do it at all. Flint has lost his love for his craft, because of all the time he spent receiving power from the orb. He is almost entirely decrepit, and he knows why. And so does the orb. So the orb disappears, and Flint is forced to let go. But in the end, his contentment, his passion, it all comes back to him, and he is once again free. This story came so easily to me, because those feelings and experiences were very fresh to me at the time of coming up with it. I was going through a breakup that needed to happen for my own good. In the midst of the relationship, I knew that it wasn’t right for me, and it wasn’t fair to them. But I felt like I wanted to keep trying, and I wanted to hold onto the experience. But I was depressed, very anxious, and I hurt the both of us very deeply in the process. It took a very long time, but I came out of it feeling better and more hopeful for a brighter future. That doesn’t mean the pain and anxiety I feel is all over for me. But I’m learning about myself, and I’m learning to live a happier life, one song at a time.
Breaking bad XD

This song is fire man, I've listened to this when it was released a YEAR ago and even now it hits so hard, and the visuals are amazing with all the neat little references from the background, the animated people and graffitis all around the intro and throughout the song, man i wish a lot more animated songs were like this :3

I like at 0:04  the sign has what appears to be the orb that appears later in the story talk about foreshadowing
This song describes me..
Who is 2024?😅
Seguir adelante, seguir adelante, Realmente no importa, Mi cerebro sigue un patrón. Olvídalo. Rompiendo, rompiendo, Crees que mejorará, pero nunca lo hace. Siento que me estoy muriendo. Nadie me dice que estoy mintiendo. No podía oír cuando estaba llorando. Es una derrota cuando intento olvidarlo. Todo el silencio se hace más fuerte, y más y más fuerte. Tal vez lo olvide. pasando todos los días, deseando estar bien. Rendido a un mundo gris. (Oye.) Mi auto está averiado, no puedo salir de la ciudad. Así que caminaré por un camino de vergüenza. ¡Dolor de cabeza! Todo mi Los pensamientos se están dispersando. ¿Estoy más enojado que un sombrerero? Subiendo una escalera sin fin para olvidarlo. Todo el silencio se hace más fuerte, y más y más fuerte. Tal vez lo olvide. Tal vez lo olvide.

I cried so much 😢😢😢😢
Wish there was another song to continue. This one is just too sad, but sweet and beautiful.
That was so touching I loved it I'm literally dying now
Moving on, moving on, It doesn’t really matter, My brain follows a pattern. Forget about it. Breaking up, breaking down, You think it’ll get better, but it never does.  I feel like I’m dying. Nobody tells me I’m lying. Couldn’t hear when I was crying. It’s defeating when I’m trying To forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.  I’m spending every day, Wishing I was okay. Surrendered to a world of gray. Hey. My car is broken down, I can’t get out of town. So I’ll walk along a road of shame. Headache!  All my thoughts are getting scattered. Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about
I got me crying  too
* crying in sadness
Absolutely love 💕 it  Can’t stop listening to it  🤩
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😍😍😍😍😍😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😥😥😥😥😥

ITS WALTUHH WHITEEEEEE
0:05 if u don’t see jellybean
I just realized 4get means forget
Poor sun he sacerfas hes dhath poor sun
The kahoot short promoting this
I pasted the story behind 4GET here!    4GET is a song written about the crippling anxiety that I have always fought through in my life, either during or moving on from a relationship. I have a pattern of overthinking, and I feel like that hasn’t ever changed. The feelings I go through in the middle of dating someone that I’m actively unsure about can be damaging, and I have to console with a counselor or friends in order to actively figure myself out. I’m unable to do the things that I love doing when I’m in this mindset that can’t be truly cured until I end things with a potential partner. I’m working on that to this day. So I wanted to write this song for anyone that can relate, but in whatever way it speaks to them, not just to my specific situation. Many of us overthink, but maybe we’ll forget about it. I created this song closely alongside The Living Tombstone. It was always a dream of mine to work with Yoav and Sam, and now I’m proud to call them my friends and close business partners. I brought OR3O on as well, because we’ve worked together and been friends since I started out in my career. She is a wonderful singer, and I’m grateful for her participation on this important original song. The animation was created by a massive team of talented industry professionals. I came to a group of them to discuss the video’s concept, which I basically thought up right before we got into that meeting. They spent a year on this project, and I couldn’t have done this without all of them. The story follows the protagonist, Flint, who is passionate about creating art with graffiti, and is very good at what he does. He comes across a box in an alleyway with an adorable living orb creature. It is a very happy creature, and its special power is bringing its happiness to anyone that encounters it. The little orb physically passes through Flint’s heart, and he is brought an extreme amount of power, providing a new feeling of euphoria he’s never experienced before. He drops everything he is doing to spend all his time with the orb, so that he can receive more of its power. Eventually, even after all these positive feelings, Flint finds himself in an extremely depressive state, to the point where no matter what the magnitude of the orb’s power, Flint cannot receive the same happiness that he was in the beginning. He is exhausted, and eventually gets very angry for no reason, putting himself in immediate danger. On top of that, the orb’s power starts to weaken, because it cannot bring its keeper any more joy. But it tries its best to pick Flint up. It gives him his paint spray can, of which he can create graffiti with, but he cannot bring himself to do it at all. Flint has lost his love for his craft, because of all the time he spent receiving power from the orb. He is almost entirely decrepit, and he knows why. And so does the orb. So the orb disappears, and Flint is forced to let go. But in the end, his contentment, his passion, it all comes back to him, and he is once again free. This story came so easily to me, because those feelings and experiences were very fresh to me at the time of coming up with it. I was going through a breakup that needed to happen for my own good. In the midst of the relationship, I knew that it wasn’t right for me, and it wasn’t fair to them. But I felt like I wanted to keep trying, and I wanted to hold onto the experience. But I was depressed, very anxious, and I hurt the both of us very deeply in the process. It took a very long time, but I came out of it feeling better and more hopeful for a brighter future. That doesn’t mean the pain and anxiety I feel is all over for me. But I’m learning about myself, and I’m learning to live a happier life, one song at a time. Maybe I’ll 4GET about it. Thanks for listening!
man i cant stop commiting vandalism(cries)
2:12 -2:26 should be the lobby music after a soccer match
Why is this so ssssaaaaaaaaadddddddd😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Moving on,moving on♥️
ok 1:22
This is a really good song. But I see sooooo much references to various things, I have too make a List: 0:02 Let’s start here with some Youtubers I know are in this frame(idk everyone so correct me). So there Tommy, Quackity & Bbh that I know from this one. 0:03 In this frame idk anybody, but there is a fluffy cat on the balcony of the Pink House AND there is an among us crew mate behind the Yellow building. There also is a Spyro reference and a Store selling the light blobs. 0:05 The only reference I can get here is maybe the Dog is the Toby fox dog? 0:07 So there is a Joker reference on the window and this is irrelevant but I want you to know that there is a withe Creature on the wall. 0:14 So here is some juicy details. So there is Mr. Illuminati from gravity falls. Then there is Garfield’s eyes with a sandwich. 0:20 You can see in the Background Kirby and one of the bosses. 0:22 So here is some real stuff. There is dream on the boat. There are the chickens from the why does the chicken cross the road song. There are axolotls from minecraft. There is Freddy Fazbear. There is sonic. There are Among us crew mates. There is Luigi from Luigi’s mansion. There is Lancer from deltarune. And there is cuphead. 0:25 In the background there is Mettaton and Frisk from Undertale. 0:32  I just want you to know that there is a mini Mr. Illuminati. 0:58 Idk how the character is called but I know it’s from breaking bad. 1:23 Here there is a clear  Hatsune miku and Isaac reference. 1:26 Frisk and Mettaton. 1:28 A minecraft block. I didn’t find more but if there are more that I missed the you can tell me.
The song: fire The song video: cry
WHAT JELLYBEAN CAN CLIM THE POLE!
Do I even see jellybean?
I feel like the song is relatable due to the fact when you lose someone you don't want to let go due to the fact they want you to feel better but it's really difficult to do that because that ball of light reminds me of a relative or a friend that you lost and he's always trying to cheer you up that has the most saddest but beautiful part about life you must continue for them to help others carry on in life
Anyone notice jelly bean ?😂
What the hell how have i just realized Or3o worked on that i love the content of that channel

2:00  This Video Make Me Cry……
No one seeing jellybean on the pole at 0:03
Coming back to this a year after feels kinda nostalgic..
This song dropped at a point in my life when I was ready to die. Throughout the entirety of 2023 I was depressed to the point of attempting several times. This song was exactly my mental state at that time, I didn't feel like I could control my own mind and I was in the passenger seat but still trying to make the best of it. I used to listen to this song on loop back and forth to my psych appointments and even during the very few times I was okay during that year I listened to this song. It all came to a head when I was institutionalized on the 10th of October. I'm not okay, but I'm doing much better now. This song for that reason will hold a special place in my heart, not for making sure I was good, but making sure I was okay.
Goooooooo🎉
0:03 I like how jellybean is in the background
I cried while watching this part 2:08
No wonder CG5 was tearing up in that short 😂 Amazing song and amazing animation, as always. The way you put in so many colours and emotions in a song and make the whole thing balanced is just insane.. Yall got me thinking this was some disney show because of your talent 😂
Cool
I wanted I wish you were the two people who are on the tracks kissing with Danny DeVito I think they were kissing they were on the tracks on top of each other that's not safe don't do that don't do that it makes me mad ☹️ ☹️ ☹️ ☹️ ☹️ 😡 😡 really 😡 cursing emoji being emoji

Yo is that bill
The orb reminds me of a puppy or kitten You find it in a box one day and love at first sight But eventually the love seems to fade and the animal gets taken for granted Than the pet gets killed in one way or another and you realize just how much you loved them  Eventually remembering the love ang good time you shared making a feeling of contentness While still wishing you had your friend your happy you had a friend to began with
I love this song

The end was so sad but happy
Something about this song changed me, rather, I think I had been changing for a while, but this song finally triggered the chain reaction, I had been depressed for a long time, and it doesn’t even make any sense, I mean, how is this song any different from the other mental health songs I had been listening to? But… after the first time I listened to it I just… started getting better.
Or3o is tied as my favorite nerdy song creator with CG5 so… needless to say I’m happy.

I love how many references there are in this music video. Amazing lyrics
OMG JELLYBEAN
Bro how h so good
The mashup we needed but never deserved
my two people who i Liston to in one song
maybe this doesn't connects to the song but when i read the story behind it it's kinda like smoking cigarettes, you're counting on the cigarette to make you happier and after some time you receive stress and depressed. but after you stop with the addiction you start to feel more happier
Dear cg5 this is Ken vines I was big fan of you long time I got question can I put ur music and my movie and maybe make Nico nextbots song it we’ll be cool ❤

“ the fire in your heart, is your true soulmate, it has been with you the entire time, but you forgot to use it”- A wise person 0:34
Moving on, moving on, It doesn’t really matter, My brain follows a pattern. Forget about it. Breaking up, breaking down, You think it’ll get better, but it never does.  I feel like I’m dying. Nobody tells me I’m lying. Couldn’t hear when I was crying. It’s defeating when I’m trying To forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.  I’m spending every day, Wishing I was okay. Surrendered to a world of gray. (Hey.) My car is broken down, I can’t get out of town. So I’ll walk along a road of shame. Headache!  All my thoughts are getting scattered. Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it. Maybe I'll forget about it.
Wow this hits close to home it the best way❤
The most legendary collab
Ah yes the memories
0:46 This reminds me of glam from Metal Family
This animation is all gold.

THE WALTER WIGHT 😭 1:03
dont understand the theme ._.
Did anyone notice Walter white 😂
The more I watch this video I realize how it’s a song about addiction… someone was minding their business and something traumatic happened to them. They just wanted to forget about it. One day they went into an hour and a drug addict gave them something like heroin… the end shows how he dies. He gets ran over by a car. After hallucinating and chasing someone. It’s one of the best songs that I’ve ever heard, but… man once you really pay attention, it’s insane.
the ultimate crossover of gen z nostalgia music
light orb: dying CG5: *DADADADADA*
I really want to know the story on this because I didn't understand it very well.
This reminded me of my own life. It’s harder than what most people dealing with depression is like
Most depressing upbeat song spotted
Don't cry  Don't cry Don't cry it's just a ball.
Waltuh
Nothing can top this song! If somebody does, than they're basically the song god.
the badabadabadada is my favorite part of the song (You know what I am talking about)
Wow that looks like my art style
This is so good it's making me cry CJ5 is the god of music you're the best
If you dont want to commit suicide then dont commit suicide!!!!  edit: i was a different person 5 months ago.

Everything has an ending crazy how deep this song is my girlfriend broke up with me recently and I was feeling numb till I came back and listen to this song
1 year ago now, i remember listening to this eating a jawbreaker...    Also the end credits remind me of the YFM end credits from each gen2 music video
Probably will be the only cg5 song that i actually like...
This song is the representation to learn to enjoy small things.
Best music ever😢
Who saw jellybean :o
The references in this videos are crazy

0:03 not the among us and Jellybean😭
I love You music bro, it's Awesome 💙
This is so true for many. Cant forget about you CG5 Love you love yall Love everything.
This is a great piece of a video, with excellent and fluid animation! I was wondering what it symbolizes, but then it occurred to me that it could symbolize a lot of things about the self. How one adapts to an everchanging community and struggles, especially with conflicts with themselves. Notice that the characters in the beginning are gone. Maybe they left or transitioned?
This song still makes me cry to this day
Who saw the among us😂
THIS GOES HARDDDD 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love this song so much! I came back to it as ive been going through a hard spot in my life and its really helped me. My question is will we ever see flint or his storyline again?
Is it me or did I see a spray painting of the angel Gabriel from the mandala catalog at 2:16
Tier S Song

This really helps me to forget about it
I'm not crying... you are 😢
Love how there’s Markiplier in the beginning
one of his only good songs
Man i cried
This story, just in the story of the song itself, is interesting. A graffiti artist comes across a ball of happiness that brings him a feeling of happiness, of contentedness, which ends up fading over time because he had grown reliant on the orb, tossing away the craft that was the backbone of the happiness, in the end, the orb begins to break down into dust, and for once, it seems melancholic, but it manages one last smile, which brought to light the craft that our protagonist had forgotten their enjoyment of.  And then there's the story behind the story of the song. I listened to the song the first time, and nearly wept, not because I felt an overarching story behind it, but because I related to it more than I liked to admit. I went through a rough patch in my own hobby, I like to write, but I found myself writing less and less because it felt so taxing, so draining on my creativity, and it felt like everything I liked about my work was all the things I had to draw inspiration to write. I felt like quitting, stopping myself from continuing to try, and for a while, I did stop, even now, I've yet to fully start back up, I write to kill time, but I don't apply myself fully to it anymore, it's more of an idle thing, much like humming. For those people who too feel trapped to a cycle of doing something you enjoy only to start not enjoying it much anymore, you aren't alone, many people go through the rough patches, and you shouldn't give up, it will get better!  TL;DR: personal experiences with depressing things led me to learn that if you enjoy something, keep going, and no matter what, you'll find your perfect balance, and you can get through it
THERE WAS A TECHNOBLADE REFRINCE!!!
i cried T^T so sad but good song
Summary for the people who don't understand this song:  Some dude lost his ball and started crying, then remembered he had a second bigger ball-
That is just the same thing as the kahhoot thing
Get the shotgun Billy
New favorite song
Why do I feel like OR3O was responsibile for the Omori references
“Ay ima vandalize this alleyway” “I am now bonded with a strange yellow orb” “I think of life” “I cook” “Yellow orb splashes me now im pissed” “I ignore yellow orb” “I push away orb” “I run away” “near death experience by vehicle” “Orb dissolve” “I vandalize alleyway again” “Orb dissolves” “My graffiti starts having color” “I stare at the sun and get blinded”
I come the future…and the I say PART TWO👹👺👹👺👺
At the end wherever the yellow orb disappears It's kinda sad. Speaking of the yellow orb what is the yellow orb what is it supposed to be?
What This bubble are cg5?
0:22 FREDDY FAZBEAR
I would really LOVE to 👀 a entire series of music videos like this that show a variety of mental health issues including the effects of C-PTSD from long-term emotional abuse involving dysfunctional families...Catchy songs like this are a GREAT way to help people speak more openly about their various struggles & help break down the stigma😊🫶.
This is like the consequences of when a person ignores their Depression & it just gets worse & worse... But at the end he finally 😭 & acknowledges his very real suffering so seeking help & ultimately healing can finally begin.The little orb of light is like his will to live that disintegrated away but after he acknowledged his pain while 😭 his will to live became the 🌝 lighting up the 🌃 sky because he had some form of hope about things getting better with possibly seeking help🙂.
No se ingles, pero muy buen video y muy buena musica, y muy alegre todo, solo que no se si es alegre, pero buen video
Now this was added to my playlist 🔥🔥🔥
This song is so good🤩
This song has so much to it, I watched it so many times  It makes me emotional 😭

I love this song so much mate ❤❤❤
Fun little Easter egg when he found the little light there was the triangle
0:04 I found something sus
Most likely a symbolism for drugs. And when the ball finally faded, the paintings became colored again, meaning they were feeling true happiness for once.
they ran a red light
YO I FOUND SONIC AND OTHER SMASH CHARACTERS

SIIIIIIIIICK
Dont search up #peppapiggasolinameme
Man, this song... Awesome... Uhhh just... I'm so speechless. This one of the coolest songs ever made!
I saw jelly bean😅
Do not understand what it is
here's my analysis of this song: (read the story behind this song too, it's in the desc)  "moving on, moving on, it doesnt really matter, my brain follows a pattern, forget about it" this probably means that people with anxiety often feel like they dont matter, and they should just forget about it. the brain always overthinks but we keep telling ourselves to stop, and forget  "breaking up, breaking down, you think that it'll get better but it never does"  with anxiety, you avoid things that make you anxious, and hope it'll just magically disappear, but it's just avoiding it instead of confronting, which is very scary to do  "i feel like im dying" probably states the feeling of having a panic attack. it feels like you're about to pass out or die. your heart beats fast, ears ringing, hyperventilating. it's a very scary experience.  "nobody tells me i'm lying. couldnt hear when i was crying" i think it means that most anxiety goes unnoticed. with anxiety, you often fear what people will think of you and your emotions, and  you often hide it and no one can see your suffering. also why the music in this song is very happy, whereas the lyrics are about charlie's experience with crippling anxiety. it's about hiding the suffering  "it's defeating when i'm trying to forget about it" trying to forget about anxiety and fear is a very hard and mentally taxing thing to do. every time you try to forget about your anxious feelings, the more it comes to haunt you  "all the silence getting louder" it's a feeling that i cant really describe. you kinda have to experience it to find out. but it is not a pleasant experience.  "I’m spending every day, Wishing I was okay. Surrendered to a world of gray." this is more about depression. again, not sure how to explain this one, but the lyrics kind of explain itself i guess? but the gray part, it's like the world is desaturated. food doesnt taste as good, things arent that enjoyable anymore, and yeah, you get the deal.  "My car is broken down, I can’t get out of town." it's describing a feeling of being stuck at a point in life.  "All my thoughts are getting scattered. Am I madder than a hatter?" with a ton of overthinking, you can easily feel like you're going insane.  as for the last scene, flint tries to get back into his old hobby, but with anxiety and depression, it gets quite scary to do it. it is seen that flint is forced to let go of the orb, creating separation anxiety, grief and/or withdrawal.
0:03 is that 8-BitRyan in the foreground?

This reminds me of being obsessed with someone to the point it starts hurting you. You start realizing it's hurting you but you don't wanna admit it until it's too late. Because, y'know, maybe you'll forget about it.

When I heard this song I wasn’t paying attention cuz I was playing a game and when I looked at the music video at the ending I thought he cried cus he didn’t have anymore spray paint💀
I forgot how much I love cg5 until everyone started complaining about his meme songs
I like when they say it doesn’t really matter
I wish at the end the police pull up and gave him a ticket for vandalism (this is a joke)
We makin it out of the San Francisco gay hood with this one 🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️
How is no one talking about the literal spray pant on the walls? Guys take a closer look, one of them got me crying
I heard you made a short about this. *SPOILER ALERT* It's about where the class does a kahoot and the song really fits with the kahoot soundtrack

wultah?
Moving on, moving on, It doesn’t really matter, My brain follows a pattern. Forget about it. Breaking up, breaking down, You think it’ll get better, but it never does. I feel like I’m dying. Nobody tells me I’m lying. Couldn’t hear when I was crying. It’s defeating when I’m trying To forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it. I’m spending every day, Wishing I was okay. Surrendered to a world of gray. (Hey.) My car is broken down, I can’t get out of town. So I’ll walk along a road of shame. Headache! All my thoughts are getting scattered. Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it. Maybe I'll forget about it.
not gonna lie this song made me cry
So gorgeous ❤
Who’s coming back to your childhood friend because he just made the Smurf cat meme die

Y'know, the first time I listened and watched this I cried. I thought it was just that it was just a sad theme. But what I didn't realise is that I related. The hiding your emotions, heck, even the freakin art seeming worse towards the end It was just like me. Thank you for this beautiful work guys. Not only do you make amazing music and art, you change people.
OMG ITS BREAKING BAD

Childhood mash upp
Bro the music video makes this song so much sadder but sooooo much better
On a rewatch of this video after not watching it for a while, I started crying towards the end and I couldn’t figure out why.
The ending: Music video: a depressing ending where the mc’s friend dies after the mc gets mad at them, which is what caused their friend to fade away Music: yay happy music :D
0:12 is that technoblade

Uhh is this suppose to be sad? Cause I don’t feel a thing
After seeing everyone's comments I'm starting to get a feeling that this is not normal, but is it "normal" to have a mixture of every negative feeling and some sense of nostalgia after watching this video
Just like techno blade.
The best of 3 worlds: ya got Charles with that fire singing or3os singing, now I’m not a or3o fan so… but good  Then we got TheLivingTombstones unparalleled beat and song making

Wow this is great!!
No matter who dies or you're are no longer is with, it will get better, it will be gradual and it may take a very long time, but the You that makes it out after you persevered will laugh how it no longer bites your heart or haunts your mind, And Will be confident you can make it through back to where they're again it's just going to be a while. I wish You well Traveler

I can confirm this is true. I was the can spray paint.
the grey hair really mean that he is stressing out.
The end reminds me of when my boyfriend died, how everything hurts and feels wrong when something so integral to your life is removed, but after a while... you can look back and laugh and cry at the past and things that remind you of them. Like when he saw the moon, that's what the end reminds me of  Edit: I read the meaning behind and reas for making it in the desc. and hey, good on you man. You're doing great and I'm glad you're taking time to figure yourself out.
Lol not the Arianna whistle note somewhere there-  Love this song though :D
It took me so long to realize that with her hair turn gray she wasn’t old she was forgetting color
I don't know why, but I feel a nostalgic feeling when I hear this.

The animation going with the lyrics is so perfect, the symbolism is crazy in this. It really shows the struggles of things like depression and trying to hide it from others. Stay strong everyone, you will make it through this alive.   edit: I removed the number because of what has been shared in the comments below, thank you all for your information and sorry that it wasn't helpful, I had no idea about this stuff.

My guy snuck in a Fnaf reference, Kirby reference, A gravity falls reference AND MORE??
This make me cry.
i can't stop watching it yet it makes me so sad
Not only is this song really good but putting 8 bit ryan and I think John Wolfie is what made this especially good! You have a new subscriber
1:43 what happens with your inspiration in school
This song is so amazing
I never realized he made a colab with OR3O
1:26 glamour
Homelander!?
He reminds me of another character
i know this is a sad song but 0:57
wow
omg the dude in the orange-brown coat scaringly looks like my OC that I thought it was him
I think i just saw glamrock freddy in the first like 20 secs of the vid- did anyone else notice that??
I took one look at the graffiti at 0:24 and was like, " ....So I see a vibrant array of of colors and fandoms. Neat. "
This reminds me of one shot
This is possibly one of the most beautiful things I’ve seen and heard. AWESOME work guys!!
I wish the background music was a FNF song
I have listen to the song probably over 10 times
song: 😄 him: 😥😢😭
I can’t believe you did it with living tombstone this is amazing how much detail you put in this♡
See the love for for CG5 living tombstone and oreo coming for all sides

JELLYBEAN WAS ON 5THE POLE AT THE START
0:03 THE AMONG US IN THE BACKROUND 😂
0:01 TIMED 😘
It sounds fun but the music video looks sad and dark. Yes, CG5 has cried watching this. Like Racing into the Night.
The end is emotional
Random kid:rate this beat one out of ten Me:10000000000000000000000  out of ten

0:40
I'm so sad😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Honestly this song has earned its place in my head. Its literally 1 AM and I had to hear this song.
I like song
I'm crying (The reason why is causes its such a great video)
Cg5 you literally have my 2 favorite music artists I will be severely dissapointed if this isn’t the best song ever
OR3O is such a good artist and all of their videos are great especially karma
Team Cap down here tecnoblade never dies
Correct me if im wrong but at 0:23 the spray painting that he made is all of the video game characters that he did so far at least i think. Cg5 correct me if i am wrong
Mr. Cozmo is right right cg5
I can relate to this a lot…and what I found cool for some reason was the 3rd journal from GF (one of my personal favorite shows)
Huh???
This joins the club of one of the songs that can make me cry
Is he stil there
OHH WOW IT'S YOUTUBER'S OH GOD OH I-AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Was it me or i saw just badboyhalo AND THE CHILD WHOES TOMMYINNIT WT-
Love the music
my question is how did I cry in like two minutes
Animation:😃 Lyrics: 🙁
BEST MEGACOLLAB IN THE WORLD
Does anybody see jellybean
the first thing I noticed was 8-bitryan, amazing.
Haven't even listened to the full song it's already amazing
I saw a omori reference at the beginning I seen the eye
I love the references thoo
Did anyone notice the among us?
Jellybean casually sliding down a telephone pole.
Is that tommyinnit and badboyhalo in the first part?
Now that's what I'm talking about
Can you make a song about TECHNOBLADE for the community who misses him? PLEAASE
Nobody's talking about jellybean in the bg of the literal first part of zé song
0:56 breaking bad moment
the voice when his hair turning gray<3
Me when I lose pizza roll
Me 3 seconds into the song: omg, is that @JellyBean!?
💯 out of 10 Beans 🫘
NO WAY JELLY BEAN IS THERE
When sun pet has got evolution to solgaleo
I love you cg5
I liked this so much that i  watched this 8 or 10 times
Damn son
This actually made me cry at the end😭❤ I still loved the song
The songs I could find references to in the giant mural at the start:  Run ( Sonic running ) Evil team ( Lancer ) Phantom Dancing ( Luigi in the bottom left ) Superstar ( Freddy ) Why did the chicken cross the road ( Chickens ) Dear Calypso ( The Ship ) Devil ( The little cuphead in the bottom right Phoenix of the Sea  ( Axolotls Good to be alive   ( The yellow bean with a crown ) Parappa plays funky music ( Parappa ) and I see a dreamer ( Dream in a  boat )
RIP mr. Yellow happiness dot sir you would be remembered 😢
Bro people say this hits hard Just look at the scene in call of duty ww2 whne cames to turners death
Banger
Is it just me or it look hilda🤔
My two fav music creators making a COLAB? OMFG
Getting out of the deep meaning but, I love all the little references with the tags such as the billy, sonic, Kirby, metaton, fnaf
1:46 YO SOMETHING FROM OMORI!
I love how it's refering to a literal ball of light in his life and it's showing human nature about how we all take everything we have for granted
This is so sad😢
Did I just see the book from gravity falls on the wall as grafitii
They just like me fr

“JESSE STOP THE COOKING FIRST COME AND LOOK AT THIS”
Epic❤
Best song ever😢
The "Hey!" is obviously from the adorable specimen
That “Moving On” line feels like a really cool not to Bohemian Rhapsody, even the notes that it was sung in represents it too!
Me pausing on the pig to see if it was a technoblade tribute -
Rip Small Sun Guy Feb 10th, 2023 - Feb 11th, 2023 He was a great sun until he died

Nice
Hey can someone tell me what this songs about i saw the gravity falls book but i doubt its about that anyone know or should i google it?
I can’t believe cg5 cried bc of the ending😢
Watching this and listening to the song really hits home for me. I know what it’s like to struggle with these problems and how ignoring them makes it worse. Opening up to your problems with help make things better, not just for you but for the people around you too! I hope everyone has a great day and knows that things may be bad now but they’ll get better soon. Just wait! ❤
I feel like I’m supposed to get it. Just because I have ADHD means I’m supposed to get it right???
It’s so cool to see 3 artists I like making something together just awesome!
Cold costco pizza and tabasco be hittin different with this song 🎵🎶🎵🎶
Bro was that jellybean slipping off the telephone pole at the start?
Why does a character at the start look like tommyinnit lol
0:27 again bill chipper confirmed
I just love all the little references in it like all the little things that not all might see but they definitely bring soo much nostalgia to my childhood ❤
0:03 among us in the distance
0:14 bill chipper confirmed
I cried twice seeing this   or shed tears twice, if that counts  thanks I can bottle up my feeling a little longer now
I just realized something!  Not sure if it was a blatant reference, but the first line of the song,  "Moving on, moving on, It doesn’t really matter" (0:17- 0:21 into the song for reference)  sounds alot like  "Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters" (1:37 into Bohemian Rhapsody, NOT this song for reference)  from Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen except sped up and slightly different in tune pretty cool easter egg!
You all know the living tombstone OR3O wrote the song “still dancing” you may know the song but just look her up
i fell in love with this song when it first came out, but i just read the full story behind it and rewatched the video and it nearly brought me to tears because of all the strong emotions behind it. keep up the good work charlie, and thank you for sharing your feelings.
Liek if u cri evri tiem
Is it bad that I had to force myself to cry 😭
parappa the rapper
0:58 Wow

Thank you cg5 this song is really helping me though a really tough time in my life
i like the technoblade tribute
2:19. GRAVITY FALLS REFERANCE WOOOOOO
Help there's so much weird references lmao
Moving on, moving on It doesn't really matter My brain follows a pattern Forget about it Breaking up, breaking down You think it'll get better, but it never does  I feel like I'm dying Nobody tells me I'm lying Couldn't hear when I was crying It's defeating when I'm trying To forget about it All the silence getting louder And louder and louder Maybe I'll forget about it  I'm spending every day Wishing I was okay Surrendered to a world of gray (Hey) My car is broken down I can't get out of town So I'll walk along a road of shame Headache  All my thoughts are getting scattered Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it All the silence getting louder And louder and louder Maybe I'll forget about it Maybe I'll forget about it
I want a cartoon show about somthung like this
remember think before you act otherwise consequences shall be caused
I genuinely cried watching this...
2:18 gravity falls 😁😁

I thought this was about Kahoot
THE REFERENCES IN THE ART MADE ME SO HAPPY, ESPECIALLY THE GLAMROCK FREDDY
So... we're NOT going to talk about the Gravity Falls reference here. :0  Otherwise, AMAZING video. WE LOVE YOU, CG5!!!! ❤
I read the story. And saw this video when it came out, but never commented. I have adhd, but I understand you my friend.
The animation really reminded me of sunburn ( the living tombstone song ). I like to think the songs take place in the same universe
Quick question, Did I just hear the frickin Kahoot! lobby song in it or I'm js imagining it?
Oh... My.. Wow...
🤯🤯🤯🤯
I like how there is different drawings of different characters from games shows and movies
I SAW JELLYBEAN IN THE BACK
The point of the song is a part of my life
I love this❤
My life be like: (I am deppresed)

0:05 Are those human versions of Bloo and Trevor? (Oh and I also just noticed DHeusta on the background too, every time I watch this I catch something new)
Was is this supposed to be sad?
This song, is just amazing, I like how it gives the feeling that it is a good to be upset about someone you know dying.
Walter white

Jellybean falling of the lamp XD
The crossover we needed
One day when I was in class I had a  panic attack and I started to scratch my skin until blood started to come out and like two people noticed. And when ever I ask for help I'm afraid to ask for help because I feel like no one would help me. My panic attack went on for 30 mins. My teacher was like Oh YeAh I nOtICeD YoU DiDn'T HaVe A PaNiC AtTaCk. I DID I FELT LIKE I COULDN'T FREAKING BREATHE. I just didn't tell her. After school I listed to this song for an hour  it helped me a lot cause I have been bullied because of my weight or how I looked. But ik everyone has their own struggles in life and we can break the barriers  together like a family who has their backs. 😊❤
SHAGDHDHDHD
This is one of my favorite song thank you cg5!😄😀

Nobody gonna talk about how this song has lore AND meaning?
0:06 Mark
POV You relate to this song
You don't need it but heres the lyrics. Moving on, moving on, It doesn’t really matter, My brain follows a pattern. Forget about it. Breaking up, breaking down, You think it’ll get better, but it never does.  I feel like I’m dying. Nobody tells me I’m lying. Couldn’t hear when I was crying. It’s defeating when I’m trying To forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.  I’m spending every day, Wishing I was okay. Surrendered to a world of gray. Hey. My car is broken down, I can’t get out of town. So I’ll walk along a road of shame. Headache!  All my thoughts are getting scattered. Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.
I like the sonic amungus and seceirity breach
I love this song but it makes me cry
This is just like the owl house

0:58 walter
That was damn good animation ... Oh and the music was nice too.  Edit: Somehow I'm annoyed about how good this entire video is. Its amazing
Bro I’m getting goosebumps
😢😢
still here Listening to it again and again
Cool 😎
0:59
The line “maybe I’ll forget about it.” Really brings me into the moment, since I live with my parents and I’m struggling with my job, not telling them anything. You made me come out to my parents, legend, cg5
Amazing song 😄
*best cg5 song.*
my life fr
I keep listening its crazy 24/7
This is the best song that I ever heard❤
I like your drawings u are better than me
this contains almost all of what humanity has made, the internet is the only reason why we r sane at the moment, and it give me childhood thoughts, like BBH, gravity falls, those among us song we used to like, and so much more! 🥲
The way JellyBean was sliding down the street light with a Amougus in the backround XD
0:11 is that quackity
Actually one more gravity falls
These are all of the Easter eggs
Per rapper sonic Kirby Minecraft axolotl Lancer from Delta rude Glenloch Freddie and among us and undertale
I don't exactly know what are characters doing but I love this song!
The 2 perfect music Creators collabing= perfect song
I’ve been listening for so long and I still can’t get enough of this song! I would love to hear more songs from this trio. It’s amazing!
N-no, what do you m-mean? I-I'm not crying, you are. You're the crybaby.
Thank you for featuring my favorite artist, The living tombstone has been my emotional support artist for Thirteen years
Wow this honestly was so sad :(
I thought this song was for kahoot
Gives gen loss vibes
I saw mettaton 😂
There's an among us in the background at 0:03
this song is in brookhaven in roblox!
Legendary, simply legendary.
It’s it amazing!!!
Walter white
Me: a perfectly relatable song doesn't exi- CG5: 4Get (The whole ignoring a problem bit)
yes
I cried at the end
I love the amount of easter eggs there are in this. Absolutely amazing!
Yo, I'm more interested in all these Easter eggs, I see so many youtubers that I know, and the graffiti is also Easter eggs
I feel like i know what's the meaning of the song but at the same time i dont
Fun fact: the spray painted journal with a 3 on it at the end of the video is from gravity falls.
0:22 axolotl glamrock freddy sonic chicken weird dog thingy among us cuphead Luigi’s mansion
Time flys
I just saw jellybean from the poll in 0:03 💀-
The fact that the song before this was a song about death (the puss in boots villain) slightly concerns me
Me after submitting this song/music video in an English assignment about poetic elements: 😎
Bill!
ITS AMONG US 0:04 Edit:ITS WALTER WHITE YO 0:58
Don't think I didn't see jellybean in the background
Bro I love how you did a colab with them then they do a colab with you which is the best it almost makes me cry from it!😢😢😢
This song made me cry for 10 hours
Deep
BREAKING ba-tv screen
I love how they basically used kahoot music 💀💀💀
I listened to this without even considering the video- THEN I WATCHED IT AND PAYED ATTENTION- *this is absolutely beautiful- I truly have no words...*
😢 me in the middle of the song
Hey there was Bill Cypher:)
Your best song yet
BANGER VID!!!!!!
Waltuh reference is da best
You and good with songs
The vibes that this song gives is that ominous feeling hefore the attempt…
1:46 OMORI REF
1:23 MIKU NATION RIZZE
0:22 IT SAYS UR MOM AT THE TOP RIGHT CORNER LMAO
Is no one gonna talk about the gravity falls book
Walta white
I really really want to know the story behind the music video. The most i can understand is a story of anxiety, but there is so much im not seeing. Can someone help me here?
that beat is nice and cool
I love how jellybean is just hanging on to the pole for her life.
This song literally destroyed me. Especially when I heard the back story, I started crying again. We love you Charlie. You are not alone. <3
I SAW YOU JELLYBEAN
I just love cg5’s music style it’s so fun 😂
0:32 BEST LINE IN MY OPINION THIS IS THE BEST ONE IVE EVER HEARD
walter
0:14  Homelander!
Every song is so catchy. I love it!!!!
Watch this while playing a game and it made me go, absolutely god mode😂
the *best* part of video: 0:57 - 1:03
These Videos Are Absolutely Amazing
I'll NEVER 4GET MY WORK!!!!!
😢
At the living tombstone
Who saw an among us figure
Jellybean on a pole
Everytime i watch it i almost cry 😭
when all of my favorite music producers make a song together:
This would be a perfect anime series. Just saying.
Not the little light marble 😭😢
Same animation as The Owl House 🦉🤩🤩
Living tombstone x cg5= God tier music
Who else cried while watching this? The sheer beauty of the song and the animation being so sad brpught a tear to my eye. Wonderful work as always, y'all!
I'm currently trying to get through my first break up, and this song made me cry. It just hits so close to home. Wonderful job Charlie. This song is a gem, as are all the others you make.
1:35 wdf he looks like nagito komaeda from danganronpa  💀💀💀💀
0:41 Bill cipher
Walter white at the theater
Not me noticing when Flint goes back to that alley to try saving the orb in the background  it says L+Ratio-
He even included Walter White. What a legend.
This should be fnf
walter  pog
bro...the context of this song... are u okay?
Who is the dude with the sun buddy?
I can relate to this having depression and crap -_-
0:03 Amogus detected in the alleyway Another Amogus detected at 0:23
I like the detail that at first, the character’s hair is brown, and in the middle (the pond scene) their hair changes to grey. In the end, it’s a type of blue colour, kinda representing that whenever the orb of light isn’t around, it’s like they feel worse.
I like that he added markiplier into it
OUTSTANDING
That' look like fnf
SEEING THAT THERE IS A BUNCH OF GRAVITY FALLS REFERENCES, AND A BUNCH OF UNDERTALE REFERENCES, THIS MEANS YOUR OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER
It feels like the video and the song are telling seperate stories. The video seems more about people who support and help you and the pain of loosing them, while the song is about the denial of getting help from others, instead resorting to the non-method of ignorance
.
This is too pretty for my eyes
i can confirm this is what having anxiety adhd and autism feels like after you haven't gotten atleast 10 hours of sleep in a week
0:01- 0:13 aren’t these guys from other animations?
0:42 Bill cipher and Garfield!!!
I'm not crying I'm just sweating out of my eyes
It's to sad😢
i can't sense any TLT here, lol.
My fav❤
Me being the og CG5 fan back when he used to make fnaf songs
The third journal from gravity falls
Is that bill cipher
WALTER HARTWELL WHITE SCENE.. 💀
METTATON????
It would be cool if you did this with onlyjayus, she seems like she would fit the roll of the character on there
woah-- cg5- this is a bangerrr its soo underrated this brought  broughr back memories when i saw the youtubes and every detail mattered and it just reminds me of myself and i wanted to say thanks
i will never 4get this song
Wow!! 🎉🎉❤
Why did no one notice bill cypher and   The gravity falls ferences
Am i the only one noticing the similarity of the music with minecraft vs animation ep 16???
I love they too they are your friends CG5???????????
he has his hair brown in the morning but in the night has the hair color blue
And it is all your fault :)
the music 😋 the video ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️🥶🥶🥶😰😰😰😢😢😢😭😭😭😭
Wait is that bad boy
It gets better. It really does. I was trapped for a long time. Never thought i'd see the other side of the coin. But as deep as the depths of sorrow I was in were, even higher are the clouds I live in today. Don't give up. Mindsets really can change and you don't know what's around the corner in your life I swear to you.
1:00 HASENBURGER
This is actually a video on why you should do drugs and to never stop doing them.
I saw bill cipher
Here's one word that can summarize the entire video: d e p r e s s i o n
never in my life have i related to a song so much
Yo the background ln This video, the grass, the stores, the people, lt feels so alive. l wish this was a real place somewhere, l dead wanna live there
No one gonna talk about jellybean?  0:04
Absolutely love this
Yyoo
0:57 Walter we need cook math
Yes 🎉
Did I just see markiplier, jelly bean, and ranboo?
2:07 top 10 saddest anime deaths
This song just hits, and just listened to it after a few weeks it hits more, man. I have had the greatest year of my life, with such a good friend, and something about this song reminds me of that, especially that I have learned to say goodbye to my first good friends, and man, there is still that sense of hope that I'll know really that everything is gonna be alright. Even if it couldn't end the way I want it, that doesn't make my whole world end.  thank you cg5, i love this song very much.                                                                                 hello did u expect somethin
I love it i just love it very much 💖♥️❣️❤️💝💕💓💗💘💞😍🥰😘
i just realised that at 0:23, its a mural of the songs cg5 has done,  Boat: Dear Calypso Glamrock Freddy: glamorous Sonic: the speed in my soul Chicken: why did the chicken cross the road amongus: show yourself  The Guy in the boat: I see a dreamer Ace: evil team Cuphead sillouette: Run and gun Silloutte of Luigi (i think): Phantom dancing Parappa: Parappa plays funky music Idk who the owl with the red hat is  youre mom: reference to YOUR MOM HA GAWDEE
my sadness came in my Hart when the light pet died 😢
0:02 bro Dawko is leaning on a tree
I know nobody's talking about this, but I just noticed how at 0:03, it looks like the youtuber JellyBean sliding down the pole.
YOU PUT WALTER WHITE CRYING THATS PERFECT!!
That was so good and so sad.
That’s a little crazy would like to hear
CG5, OR3O and The Living Tombstone in the same video…   I need a minute to appreciate this sh*t, hold on-
he took little moon 4granted
Why does this song feel like the story of my life
0:26  JOURNAL 3 FROM GRAVITY FALLS?
Might be one of the best CG5 song I've ever heard
Fire song wont stop singing this and listening to this every single day
I love the living tombstone! This collab was the best one I've seen <3
00:06 Was that mark in the corner?
My favorite part is when they just almost got run over by a car and there’s happy upbeat music😃😊
my dog died i song this song to him 😭😭😭😭
I loove ❤❤❤
You know what I’m singing this at school
That’s David Tennant I saw on the background
i always thought that Flint supposedly was CG5 and that the little ball of light erased everything in his mind and he has to save it from darkness and near the end i thought he was running to the alleyway to get the light ball home and he didn't see the car
I SAW THE METTATON
*i forgor 💀*
Anybody else see Tommyinnit in the start?
am i the only who saw tommyinnit at start
0:04 - amogus?

0:58 Walter FALLING 😂😂😂
This would be an amazing TV series ngl
pov: can't draw
i dont know if many people read the story behind 4GET but its sad for both the characters mentioned in the document  to me it looked more like... finding something new that brings you joy/happines but eventually not finding it as fun/exciting anymore which kill's how much you liked doing it
The song kinda gives me kahoot vibes
Omg
fish
0:58 WALTUH 💀

other people: awww me: DRUGS!!
1:26 mettaton?! On the wall
nice auto tune 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now knowing some of his inspiration (ajr) it makes sense why this song sounds familiar
I need to know who animated this, this is probably one of my favorite animations and songs ever! I love the lyrics and the glitching in between the singing!❤I also love the music! This is beautiful and a masterpiece!
Walter
Amazing animation and song! I really like it. 👍🏻
Can you make a music video with markiplier PLEASEEEEE pretty pweaseeeee (you prob wont see or read this but still)
Imposter 0:03😂😂
As someone with Depression and Anxiety+ stuff this video literally made me realize how the hell I can describe the fear and sorrow. But with ADHD or ADD (they haven't told me which one.) its just that little bit of joy that always follows you- and I know thats not really what its about but this video/song makes it at least easier to explain to people who don't understand and think I'm being over dramatic or using MD as excuses.
Fun fact:Beavis and butt-head reacted to this no cap
wait you're telling me the 3 rulers of fandom music came together?! miracles never fail istg
I really feel this
sad sad
hey mr CG5, I was wondering, could you do a remake of Trogdor, but in your "CG5" style, if that means changing the lyrics around, thats fine, so long as it follows the same theme as the original, if you could do that, that would wizard, from the one and only "man of infinite names"
CG5 is the best THX
Is no one gonna talk about the among us character in the background at 0:05 ?
Only one thing to Say and it's YES
i all most cryd
Am I the only person who spotted Bill just chilling in the title card as graffiti
This is Amazing
The end is so sad😢
:)
No Bendy cameo
Saddest but best song yet
I LOVE THIS!!! Great job to everyone involved on this song! Absolutely beautiful 🤩
p
اعجبني هذا الانميشن هل يمكنني العمل معك
So many cameos but the one I like the most is the Markiplier one
But what do you do if the song never starts?  What do you do it the clouds never part?  What do you do if that smiling light never found its way into your heart?
My little cousin showed this to me saying it was the first time he's ever cried at a song (we're both really big fans of CG5) and while I didnt cry, It definitely hits me right in the feels
0:09 Charlie and OR3O detail😍
No one be talking about breaking bad man
I love this song cg5
FINALY MY THREE FAVORITE ARTISTS MADE A SONG

what the heck, Jerma985 is mentioned in the description!
#4GET

dammit, did I just cry during a CG5 song?
Surprising that it’s only been two months before the song released
No  2:08 - 2:20 when boys cried
the animation and everything is on spot the song the story everything you guys just keep blowing everyone away great video
Badboyhalo and Tommy!!
4 and GET = FORGET  Smart idea 💡brain free 🧠👈🏻
Bro, this song is very relatable and I started crying because I could feel the message of this!
Here is one little reference I noticed that no one I see in the comments noticed                                          Journal 3 from gravity falls
Minute 0:14 grace from mandela catalogue

Great song and all, but can s9meone please explain to me what's happening in the video?
Been listening to this since it came out and just realized that I share the symptoms, crap
“Silence getting louder and louder” doesn’t make sense yet it’s the most relatable thing i’ve ever heard
I love the song but the video of it is kinda sad
10 OUT OF 10 CG5 I LOVE IT
The song: 😊 The video: 😅
Film theory he died when the van hit him and the sun repents him going to the afterlife
i think it's squiddo💀Comment what you think
I love how jellybean is just sliding down a lamppost in the intro.
Good
Gotta be honest I cried my first watch through not just because of the story but also the connection and influence Charlie has in my life. Thanks for being awesome Cg5 even if you are out of your mind lol
I LOVE TO ART AND THE SONG IS SOOO YEA
This is something straight out of Steven universe 😂
never thought a music vid would make me cry
The gravity falls reference! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! I am a Karl Jacobs fan, so seeing him and a gravity falls reference in the same music video is just, chefs kiss.
😮
0:04 among us 😆
I have literally never cared about anything more than lancer deltarune in the first five seconds of this. Amazing.
Ok
The music was really good! It became my favorite song of 2023❤

Everybody talking about the song Me: his shirt looks like among us

0:05 ITS MARKIPLIER!!!!
The ending is so sad😭😭😭it makes me want to cry
The amount of references I say just blows my mind away, fnaf, many youtubers, amogus, minecraft, gravity falls, and alot more! Cg5, The Living Tombstone, and OR3O will NEVER cease to amaze me and make me hyped because of their music.
Profound skill issue
You should make a owl house song
Really cute animation! dat ending doe... still really good AND I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT PLEASE HELP ME IVE BEEN STUCK HERE FOR 14 DAYS

Wow! This is a great song!😊❤
I just went through a few comments and I really realise how gorgeous this song is. There's such a great association of lyrics, melody, sounds, rythm that really gives life to this music. Just read 10 comments and nobody will understand it the same way, will relate to it the same way, will have the same feelings while listening to it !  That's where this song excels the most for me ! It's so deep and strong that everybody will be able to have it's own interpretation and associate a feeling or a moment of it's life to it. congrats
My favourite part is Walter white falling down animation
0:03 Did I just see jellybean hangin’ in a red pole?

The Kahoot music hitting hard

You make such good music. I cannot lie.
Looked like meta runner
How did the orb push him at 1:35but go through him at the start
True this song made me cry
Fun little Easter egg that no one is talking about At 0:22, almost every piece of graffiti is a topic that CG5/TLT has written a song about. Pretty cool huh?
Waltuh.
Music amazing animation amazing this perfect
0:22 Glamrock Freddy: Glamorous  Sonic: Run Chickens: why did the chicken cross the road Parapa: Parapa plays funky music (with cg5) Among us: Lyin 2’ Me, Good to be alive, Show yourself Axolotal: Pheonix of the sea
MACK  A  PRT 2  TO  THE  SONIG

WALTAH
The amount of references in this are amazing
Waltuh white 😢
This makes us start the new year
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
YO
I loved all the little references in the background 😊
This hits hard at 1.25 speed
Bro really just put his eyes in front of the spray paint bottle and tried using it 💀
Did anyone see the Gravity Falls book number 3
So glad that you could share this with us. We love you Charlie 🤩
59:59:59 is the best part dawg
W A L T E R W H I T E (I showed my dad this song and he woke up today saying “ the new cg5 song it’s amazing!” Got you a new viewer lol)
When the kahoot lobby beat sounds baller

CG5gas
2:14 I had a situation like that if I met a really nice friend and I can't see her / him again😢
0:24 i see  freddy..... ._.
You see that sun thing? That's me also see that person ? That's me too  but I vandalize
Cool
Morale from this video is never pick up a shiny ping pong ball from a dark alley
They caught waltuh 💀💀🗿🗿💀🙏
The character that suffered the most there was that bristy little ball that was chasing the man.
I love this da da da da da da da
1:24 SUS FACE
0:03 what are doing jellybean?
I love yours musics cg5,you a very cool musics
This is my favorite
0:04 JELLY BEAN
CG5 and TLT collaborating again is definitely something I never thought would happen. You guys should collab more often
What is this based on? Anything? Also this song is pretty deep. CG5 never fails to dissapoint us. What a legend!
This was so sad and nice at the same time
Da memes tho
Broo- the musicians I’ve grown listening to made a collaboration.. that’s the best :,)
2:19 lol it’s the gravity falls journal 3 book
0:02 AMOGUS
did the guy eat drugs???
I love this I listen to it every day ❤❤❤
the reason CG5 is the greatest pop (maybe pop) maker or smth
thats not breaking bad thats smash evil
10/10
The that goes like moving on moving on sounds like kahoot
dude this animation is sick, as well as the song, I love it
Bro I am just addicted to this song
Hey CG5 this might be off topic and I know you probably have a lot of  work while making songs but why don't you make a doors song and maybe you can make the rhythm  with the doors elevator music and I love your songs by the way.
I love it😚
At the start you can see jellybean and amongus
i like the sone and the animation it shows and tells you in a way to spend time with the one you love and to be thankful for life
Awesome
Siuuuuuuu
Dude, no one told me that a fire song came out a month ago!
The song is very cool😊
THIS WAS IN FEB 2023 WOWZA,
I can see jellybean
Bro you got some beat at the beginning💀💀💀💀
Cant wait for your new song!
Awesome song!
ANYONE FOUND AMONG US 0:03
Omori reference? 0:01
4GET
The gravity falls journey
WORLD of grey why does that sound familiar hmm THAT'S THE PORTAL SONG FOR WEATLEY
Garfield I found and it's not Monday so win for both of us
Whoop I found frisk and Megatron
I found Kirby and the light from ultimate smash bros in here too also these are all his songs on the graffiti like lying 2 me,🎵chicken cross the road 🎵, super star and so much more
I FOUND BILL CIPHER DON'T EVEN THINK OF HAVING YOUR DORITO BODY TRY TO RULE THE WORLD
🤩 It's Grand
this actually kahit lobby music
I’m just now realizing that they get older throughout the video😅
0:05 at the top right is that an undertale reference or a coincidence? 0:26 an undertale reference at the right
Man the background music is giving me Kahoot vibes
Tommy innit at the beginning
OMG MY NEURODIVERGENT BRAIN ACTUALLY LOVES THIS SM
okay is this like some land of youtubers like I see jelly been on the pole badboyhalo in 0:02 with tommy oh at 0:12 I see the guy from lonely king!!!
okay am I the only one that thinks that the orb thing is the only reason they are alive like it dies when they got hit by a car so its like a fairy from legend of Zelda.
0:46 is like me mid math class
Ones of theez guy wrote the line: 'the man behind the slaughter'
Who else saw Markiplier.
For me this song is such a pointed look at toxic positivity. I used to be like this. Forcing myself to have a good day. Never dealing with my emotions. It becomes crippling. Sometimes the most healthy thing is to just feel bad for a little bit.
I'm still crying
I don't know if it is boy or girl
Do he has a crush on the sun?
Your video are like cg5
you kinda sound like CG5
0:25 GRABITY FALLS BOOK!!!
I am so confused what happens in the animation can someone tell me?
there is so many easter eggs
i like it better than i see a dreamer
why is this song so good
I have been listening to this song on loop because it is just that great, i listened to cg5 and the living tombstone's music a lot during my childhood such as i got no time, and crawling, i also liked one the newer song he made,  i see a dreamer.  im very thankful for cg5 being apart of my childhood
you seriously sound like cg5😂
Nice
good song but why nobody talkin about walter white?????????💀💀💀
Moving on, moving on It doesn't really matter My brain follows a pattern Forget about it Breaking up, breaking down You think it'll get better, but it never does  I feel like I'm dying Nobody tells me I'm lying Couldn't hear when I was crying It's defeating when I'm trying to forget about it All the silence is getting louder, and louder, and louder Maybe I'll forget about it!  Ta-da-da-da-da-da  I'm spending every day Wishing I was okay Surrendered to a world of gray (hey) My car is broken down I can't get out of town So I'll walk along a road of shame (headache!)  All my thoughts are getting scattered Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it All the silence getting louder, and louder, and louder  Maybe I'll forget about it!  Ta-da-da-da-da-da  Ta-da-da-da-da-da (woah!)  (And yes, this was copy+pasted from google.)
0:03 DID ANYONE SEE JELLYBEAN ON THE POLE Also Ik the lyrics are at the bottom of the screen but here are the lyrics Cuz I am BORED and I want to write something  Moving on moving on It doesn't really matter My brain follows a pattern Forget about it Breaking up breaking down You think it'll get better But it never does I feel like I am dying Nobody tells me I'm lying Couldn't hear when I was crying It's defeating when I'm trying To forget about it! All the silence getting louder And louder And louder And louder And louder And louder  And louder Maybe I'll forget about it! Im spending everyday Wishing I was okay Surrendered to a world of grey Hey! My car is broken down I can't get out of town So I'll walk along a road of shame Headache! All my thoughts are getting scattered Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up a endless ladder To forget about it! All the silence getting louder And louder And louder  And louder And louder And louder Maybe I'll forget about it Maybe I'll forget about it! "Woahh!" "Woahhhh"
❤❤😅
why is jellybean on a pole-
why is jellybean there-
I saw a lot of gravatiy falls stuff
Is it weird that I usually go by "flint" online. The drawings explain my interests. And that I have the exact feelings the character does? I just find it like such an extreme coincidence that this video explains me.
Did  anyone notice jellybean
i saw the 3 jornal from gravaity falls
0:13 well well well well wellwellwellwell WELLWELLWELL
we makin it out the hood with this one 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
can you put my logo in a vid

Beautiful song  😍
🎵🎵🎵🎵 MOVING ON MOVING ON IT DOESN’T 0:20
🎵
I think you were my idol for at least 3 years now.
I love the start the most with all the references
Is it bad that I don’t know what the meaning of the song is?
It’s cool that you added little references for the spray paint. Gravity’s Falls, Sonic etc. Love the song!
It's funny how instead of listening to the song, I'm trying to find the hundreds of Easter eggs there are 🤣
This song is so beautiful I cried during the end of the song!
Thats pretty good
I wish I could subscribe infinite amount of times
Ik, it's been a long time but, I still love this song so much
Omg. I still listen to this a month later. Brings me to tears. I really needed this
why did they make the ending so sad when playing kahoot lobby music😭😭😭
nice! i love this. sounds great. have you considered making a doors song?
why havent you put i must be out of my mind on yutube
this is my go-to song
WHY IS THERE GRAVITY FALLS
this is a masterpiece, this colab can be better if you call caleb hyles
I want you to make a technoblade song really badly cause of the death of the legend..
Living tombstone is ligot I haven’t even heard the song 😩
the amount of references here are crazy
when is the south park cg5 song coming?
CG5 is the best yt nusic.
Ive, already watched this like over 1000 times! Its so good cg5 keep up the good work , animation and voices are bussin
soooo SAD
Nice
It went from "No Nay Bye" to "4GET"
Most people know that CG5 and The living tombstone and maybe even Or3o have done FNAF songs, so i like that they added glamrock freddy as one of the graffiti drawings 😄 this was also an amazing song with many emotions, i love the animation too 😊
I need more bouncy songs like this in my life ;_; smth about this is way too good
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  MY FLOATING ORB OF CUTENESSSSSS-
Coment F to pay respect 🫡
I have so many feelings going like a shivering down my spine whenever i hear this song Just... Beautiful What a good work Cg5 never disappoint
I love you cg5
Magical graffiti
this song is soooooooo cool and the animation is sick dude!😍🤩
You make so many amazing songs that every time I listen to one I just jump and start sing along but this is one of your greatest songs yet one time I was at school listening to this song and during science class were allowed to listen to music and I was listening to this song and I jumped up and started singing along when I took off my headphones and everyone was staring at me so thank you CG5 for  that ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Just can't relate more.
Kahoot be like:
Ahhhh. It's so good, yet so sad. CG5, you never fail to provide.
I thought the song was about drugs because of the video I don't know how to feel about it still. Definitely mixed emotions
Hey cg5 love ur songs but I made @Vivilly listen to your songs in his stream sparkly  abz and why did the chicken cross the road. I waited 3 houers and he raged but it was worth it (plz press the red button)
God this reminds me of my depression
Man the beat and the music is us fire this is awesome 🤟👍😝😝
0:00 it’s a foreshadowing of the rest of the video  Edit: put it to 0.25x
0:01 Something from Omori easter egg 0:04 Jellybean at the pole thingy, Spyro graffiti drawing at the left, and amogus easter egg lol 0:13 the graffiti drawing like (bill cipher and garfield for ex.) 0:20 Kirby easter egg 0:22 oh shoot alot of graffiti drawings from other fandoms i cant say it all 0:27 Frisk easter egg from Undertale 0:58 WALTER WHITE  1:55 minecraft pig (isn’t this a technoblade easter egg?)  and that’s it! (Also those are just some stuff ive found)
Yo, Cg since when the sonic song got age restricted for children content
Dude, there’s Freddy
PLEASE COLLAB WITH J4KE
Good/not good
3/10
It’s so sad…
Love the song so, so much! But I don’t really understand what’s going on in the animation (which looks SO GOOD, by the way). Can you explain it to me?
I wanna live In a city like that so bad😭
Is it just me or I just saw jellybean.
Every told me i sound like CG5...
*0:42** look at the spray paintings and you'll see some face looking like garfield*     𝕀 𝕙𝕒𝕥𝕖 𝕄𝕠𝕟𝕕𝕒𝕪𝕤
Whataheeeeel the collab
i just 4get how to die
i love the part where you added the technoblade graffiti near the end which made me happy that technoblade hasn't been forgotten at all. The song is extremely good i cant stop listening to this lol.
Nobody Talking About the Jenna Face in the Walls 💀 1:24
Im sad that the light thing is caring for him
Cool
I love the Song, animation, and the Gravity Falls reference in the grafitti.
This song was sad but maybe I'll forget about it 😢😭
Charlie…. Please see kori  at ‘Kraken the box’ on YouTube. Meeting you is on his bucket list. This young boy is terminally ill…
This is peak right here
Hey huh I'm like literally the only person who is saying that like- I'm suffering from depression so I know how this CGI character feels lol EDIT: sorry @Yoah Noah I didn't see your name ( hopefully I wrote your name right)
The ending tho :(
It’s Walter!!👉 0:58
Do part 2
The greatest trio that ever lived
Hi Charlie green
Mans is OP
Cg5 I hope you make a song with sky high by electronomia😊
CG5 I hope you make a gacha life music video please I would be very Happy!!
THE REFERENCES IN THIS VIDEO IS GODLY-
Epok song for my crying eyes :,)
This is very relatable when your thinking about bad things but you try to forget it but it gets worse
Make a song about the music freaks cg5
Make a song of LEGO Ninjago
It's like this song is about ignoring a problem that you have, thinking that if you ignore it, everything will be better. But it never gets better, only worse.  I love this song and the animation. Major kudos to the people who worked on this.
Hey cg5 can me and u meet I want to let u here my singing  voice
cg5iloveyou
0:03 among us?
i see bill cipher when i see him
Best song of 2023
Can you do fishing videos Cg5
Jellybean in the background is pole dancing
The song goes in the top 5 CG5 songs
JellyBean and TommyInnit are shown in the intro
Best vid yet
As someone who has dealt with anxiety for a few years now I can relate to this song so much. There are many things that I worry about in my daily life that makes it hard for me to relax and be calm (some of which aren't even about me). I worry about myself, my family, my friends, and where I'll end up being after school (only a sophomore in high school at the time of commenting this). Great job on the song Charlie, you and everyone involved did such a great job on this, hope to see more original songs like this in the future!
mid
I have been watching/listening to his music for a while and it never gets old keep up the good work man your a legend
1:21 idk what it is about this part but I absolutely love the voice singing this part, gives me Sadies vibes
Hey, I absolutely love your videos and I have a good idea: can you make a song about Roblox Doors. Like, that would be really awesome to hear that. Thanks
Wow *claps million times*

the music:😃 the lyrics: 😐 the animation: 💀             (i mean that one is saddest then the other)
Hey CG5 If you want to make cool songs like I do, I would recommend Incredibox

I know I've said this already but your great your songs are great and the channel is great I hope you never stop doing the things you love. This song might have made a ton of us cry bro anyone could relate to this no matter what this will be one of the best songs you have brought into this world bro don't stop what you do Continue working CG5 and have a great day CG5
Can you please make a song about Techno😢 to honor his legacy of being loved.

0:03 What's jellybean doing?
Lyrics:  (Instrumental) Verse 1 (CG5): Moving on, moving on, it doesn’t really matter, my brain follows a pattern, forget about it. Breaking up, breaking down, you think it’ll get better,  but it never does. I feel like I’m dying, nobody tells me I’m lying, couldn’t hear when I was crying, it’s defeating when I’m trying, to forget about it, all the silence getting louder and louder and louder-er-er-er-er-er-er. Maybe I’ll forget about it. (Instrumental break) CG5: Duh duh duh duh duh duh (More instrumental) Verse 2 (OR30):  Im spending every day, wishing I was okay, surrendered to a world of grey. (Hey!) My car is broken down, I can’t get out of town, so I’ll walk along a road of shame. (Headache) All my thoughts are getting scattered, am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up and endless ladder to forget about it, all the science getting louder and louder and louder-er-er-er-er-er-er. (Maybe I’ll forget about it) CG5: Maybe I’ll forget about it. (Instrumental break) CG5: Duh duh duh duh duh duh (More instrumental) CG5: Duh duh duh duh duh duh (Even more instrumental until the song ends) (Credits)
I have a little request I'm perfectly fine if you can't do this or you don't want to but I would like to see you and nf Collab you two really pushed me forward so I would love to see both of my childhoods just mixing into one

I like how you put jellybean in the background 😂😂
WALTER IS THAT YOU?
Can he make a song about Super Nintendo World.
As an animator, I think the animation in this video was very unique, original, and like something I've never seen before. Keep it up!  Unfortunately, unlike the majority of the viewers, I did not cry at all while watching this video. I'm sorry.
It's got to be perfect perfect perfect it's got to be perfect it's got to be perfect perfect perfect perfect.
Lore be like
Can you make a song with rageelixir
In my mind, I see the little glowing light as friends. And eventually we need to move on, or maybe drop them, and get new friends. They’ll always be in our hearts but once we leave we get to be able to care for ourselves again. Crying now lol thanks for the amazing music guys keep it up ❤️❤️
bro notice all the easter eggs freddy sonic  amoung us chickens cause why not axolotols gravity falls garfeild minecraft and more i most likely forgot bro like SLAY
I’m gonna cry, I’m too emotional
"I don't get it, I'm not depressed." Is what I thought after watching this. Maybe there is something wrong with me, but I think I'll just 4GET about it.
I keep watching this song over and over again cg5 makes good songs
How big you are, CG5. 🔥🔥🔥
Cg5, loving tombstone, or3o perfect honestly

0:48 brown hair blue eyes 0:54 brown hair gray eyes 1:05 gray eyes gray hair
Cg5 never fails us with his music! Also I think he should make a “MY SINGING MONSTERS” song. I would die with childhood 😭😭
After reading the story behind 4 get. I can relate,I over think and need to get over someone for my own good.    Now that I understand the song it makes it much more emotional to listen to, and makes me feel better when i'm in an emotional state.   Thank you to everyone who made this song, especially you CG5. ❤
Not jelly bean on the light
i love this song , also can i get a heart by the legend himself?🥰
Wait i swear i saw @jellybean at the start of the video sliding down a pole
1:44 Ariana note?!?
the fact that this amazing song came out on my birthday is so… amazing
WOW!!!
this song almost made me cry (CG5 and the living tonbston are fire!)
This is 🔥
I have so many emotions about this video but the one emotion I really like is that the video has a heartwarming story about a boy who is depressed but then he accidentally creates a glowing small Sun and the end up becoming friends but then one day he started over-thinking his depression start to get worse until eventually he snapped at his friend and ran into the road not paying attention he almost died but then his friend save them but then he ended up dying the boy thought he lost his only friend but then he realized he wasn't gone forever he was in his heart ❤️
CG5, this song is amazing! I love the work of all of ur huyses hard work into putting this song out
The Beat Is Like Kahoot Thank You So Much I Love You Music <3
I love that jellybean is sliding down a pole 0:03   Love the song and vid ❤
Jellybean was in the song😂❤
Soo much memories
CG5 Makes Really Amazing Songs! I Loved This One ❤️

Petition for CG5 to make a Countryballs song 👇
CG5 makes great music my all time favourite is only in Ohio, lyin 2 me, and I see a dreamer.
Collab with phoqus pls
0.22 brings back all the memories 😊
please tell me im not the only one who actually almost cried when the orb died
This video feels like a story that hits me hard. I’ve been going through horrible times and been struggling with anxiety recently as well. Losing something or someone you love is a horrible thing that happens way too often. This song and all of your work has gotten me in a better place, and I thank you for that Charlie. Keep up the great work!
I think I saw jellybean in the video I don’t know but I kind a look like jellybean
This hits harder than the right hand of Thanos.
1 hour very???
WHY DO YA GOTTA MAKE ME BAWL LIKE THIS
This made me cry.... Its a good songg... I loveee it 😭💛💛✨
This is the most attached I've ever been to a glowing ball
Bros prime was a long time ago when was making those crazy FNAF songs. Legend.
Who ever made the art style and the singing is a COMPLETE LEGEND
dude sounds like cg5
Kinda hurted tho
You need to hide the masterpiece from Tik-Tok I love cg5 songs😊
Did somebody told you that you sound like cg5?
Did you notice gravity falls
The breaking bad-
What a cute little orb I hope nothing bad happens to it in an alley
Waltuh  -finger
olliolli world real
Imagine being taught by a teacher named ms stammers 🤫
This video got me crying. What an animation 👏🏼
Achievement made:favorite song🤩🤩
The song hits perfectly, can you do one about the autism spectrum
I see JELLYBEAN!!!!
God bless
CG5 you should make a channel called cg6 wait or cg4
Whoa, something new…ish? Idk, it’s really well made tho, along with the story behind it. I hope you know that you have more than 4.12M people supporting you. If that isn’t enough, there are countless other music artists (and possibly famous YouTubers) that support you for what you do. Take a break whenever you feel like it, as well. You shouldn’t feel like anything should be weighing you down. That’s all from me. ✌️
hey waltuh
The amount of references in this vid is amazing
SOMETHING FROM THE HIT GAME OMORI
BLOO AND TREVOR 00:05

This is so good, the animation, everything!
I have severe anxiety and relate to this on a deep level 🙃
0:48 1:08  If anyone sees this just know these two frames are references for a art project I’m doing
best part is definitely when cg5 went ta-da-da-da-da-da!
i 4for
This should be a kahoot song it just gives me them vibes
What
Make a furry song or I will remove you from the multiverse and existence
I like how he makes great songs sings so good and makes funny shorts
People like CG5 and other is creative. I like the part like "Maybe i'll forget about it" is awesome, and funny when CG5 and that light ball thingy is watching the funny meme.
Cg5 I like your song
ORB NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i feel bad for mac and cheese orb
This is sick my God
this is a "Masterpiece" and i just love it, the animations, the collaboration is just awesome and i waited for this collaboration for 6 YEARS!
Good music to listen to in a maths test when you really feel like you’re dying because there’s a fricking 10 minute timer to finish 30 questions that are so hard
Mann he sounds like charlie
the among us character at 00:04
Good song 😄
1:26 METATON!??!?!
What this video has taught me: Never try to hit your floating orb, or you will almost get hit by a car, your orb will disappear, and all your graffiti will turn gray until the moon shines on it.
CG5 I LOVE YOUR EXISTENCE YOUR SO GOOD AT MAKING MUSIC YOU'LL ONLY FIND ME ON CHILL CALM MODE IF AM LISTENING TO ONE OF YOUR SONGS YOU HAVE TO BE IN ONE IF AM LISTENING TO ONE AM ALWAYS LISTENING TO YOUR MUSIC 🎶  hehe :D
Did I just saw jellybean?
the saddest part is when He loses his only friend. So sad, but i love the video!
CG5 makes *ANOTHER BANGER SONG*  Keep up the good work Charlie  Edit: I think that's your name
you had me at bill cypher
The ending... It made me cry bro it's how hes fading away
I think you might not get this but try making one on Titanfall 2
Cg5 and living tombstone are cool.
im sorry but the animation, song and backstory behind this is just *SCREAMS*
Finally a parapa the rapper reference
there is only one word to describe this song: FIRE
It's nice to see someone who really wants to be better, not like the Netflix series
Waltuh
0:03 Are we not gonna jellybean sliding down that pole👁👄👁
My fav part is “Now my heart is beating faster am I madder than I’m hatter climbing up and endless ladder to escape from all thing” masterpiece
The amount of references
this is honestly the best song i’ve heard for years
You sound like CG5
Okay I just realized Badboyhalo and tomminit are at the very start of the video...Minecraft????
but i do still like the music
HEY BASTARD YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE A VIDEO AND EXPECT ME TO LIKE IT WHEN THERE AN AMONGUS HUH
I love this man's voice he should start singing
When the Kahoot Lobby music is a bop.
I gotta say I love the melody in this. It's truly been so long since I've last heard this. Also I know it's been a year but that parappa song was godlike. Loved the style and the way you executed the visuals and animation. Id like to see another one performed in a similar way perhaps a different lesson and more singers. Just to keep things different from the other one.
I love how it's the internet in the form of a city and how there is gravity falls reference
I used to thing the living tombstone was called the live trombone
WHY IS THIS SONG TO RELATABLE!!!???? I LOVE IT!!!
1:46 omori reference
Bro that ending wa so sad I was crying 😭 Edit: I got literal child when he said I feel like I’m dying
this song sucks
The whole premise is trying to forget about anxiety, relatable.
I love the music but I saw bill cipher and I flipped lol
Cool breaking bad reference
Hmmmm.... Noice.
Sooooooo sooooooo beautiful  The animation, the song, the instrumental,  the vocals EVERYTHING
Okay this is absolutely amazing, but can we just point out for a second show jellybean is hanging from the light pole😭
Can please turn them into plushies🥺                 🙏
0:03 seems kinda sus

Yo bro do you see jelly bean

Tbh, I don't get most of this besides the ghost dying (somehow), but I like the gravity references and how the song sounds
1:05 wow
I genuienly listened to this more than ten times in the same day, I think my Spotify is concerned about me but who care this is a banger Good job bro !!

Yeah so I'm gonna need to play this in Beat Saber, when is it dropping
i dont really get this one what is it about
I saw jellybean on the light post😂
This song is so nice and loved this song so good,thank you for making this song @CG5
This songs good! I can't wait for the new one!
It’s hard to find singers who don’t cuss make great music AND can drop beats lower than my school grades good job CG5:)
I love it SOOOO much and btw you should do another tier list (put this on s tier)
You are such an amazing singer and  songwriter!! Your songs are always my favorite and always inspire me. I relate to this song in perhaps a different way than I was supposed to, and I’m sure this goes for many others as well. I truly love all of your songs! Thank you so much for being here to light up my day!!
This really made me cry
Maybe I'll forget about it
i love how they did the same as cut the cord about changing the hair color to symbolise the emotions i also love how many details and references they put everywere
u must make a scrub daddy song
The end made me cry 😭 but nice music

this is a very unexpected collaboration
Why do I feel like this could be a Netflix series lol

Depression was never an option
Very sad
This is what the hint was for
I love all the little references the music video has ranging from 8-bitryan literally right at the beginning of the video to spampton doing epic pose, love it
what is the lore behind this?
make imscared song please
very cool man!!
My will to live: 2:08
Hey CG5 volt down on the lyric and also shadow Out to living tombstone and Or3eo😍
Hi
Holy ape crap I forgot you existed until you were in my fyp I missed seeing your music videos
Hi CG5, i dont know if you will see this comment but i have kind of a roach infestation ._. So i started singing then i heard something from my last brain cells  *"their everywhere i see them in my dreams and in my nightmares, its like my sleep paralysis demon is just not there"*  so if you could make a song with that sentence i would be so happy and i would stick to those roaches torturing my braincells!
Walter White lol.
Love the song and video so much! The art style makes me think of The Owl House lol
Am I the only one who cried watching this
SO MUCH FANDOMS IN ONE VID!! (The graffiti at the beginning)
Hello CG5 👋 can you make golden hour -JVKE version you you singing plss
Love this song, good job!
This is probably the first song in a while that actually made me cry.  Just the song lyrics and the beautiful singing combined with the amazing animation and the plot of the video makes this one of the best songs/pieces of media I've seen in a while. I love that the nature of the orb and what it symbolizes is kept ambiguous because it can relate to so many different people in so many different ways, as shown by the many different ways this is interpreted in the comment section. This truly touched my heart, thank you for making this masterpiece.
Man songs giving me the chills are the best type of songs
0:52
NO IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE!!
Bro this is good, more original songs, I prefer stuff like this over fnaf among us and Ohio songs, keep it up either way though, been here since the start
0:58 Walter has given up on waiting for you to make a bad music video
At first, I thought this was amazing, but then I saw jellybean and it’s lowered down to great. It’s a good song though
1st time watching: *Bawling my eyes out 2nd time watching: still bawling my eyes out
I miss the song that among us (someone got a gun)
You have been blessed by God to make this masterpiece possible
You did it I don’t know if I’m sad or happy
Journal 3
Bro put Walter white 👁️👄👁️ dude your song is cool and sad also
0:28 is that homelander?
I read what it was about. and I *need this little orb*
2:18 Journal 3
WOW, just WOW
i noticed when it turns brighter for a short second you can see the book from Gravity Falls.
Wow this is amazing good start of 2023 😁
Gravity Falls reference question mark?
Cg5 i saw an ad for your song on spotfiy
Why the dududududun
Imagine crying because of this!!! Me?  Wait no I promise im not sobbing wdym Who told you???
Sick and great song but is he using a voice changer or has very flexible vocal chords?
0:58 Waltuh
GRAVITY FALLS REFREBCE  AT 0:27   God. It feels like a few weeks ago you had released the song Take it. I am so glad to have found your channel and see how far you’ve come in music. This song you created hits me in the feels, as I relate to it on such a personal level.   I see that lots of people are sharing how they precive some of the symbolism in the song, so I’ll give mine a share too. All the thoughts of negativity start to settle in but there’s still something inside that hopes you’ll still be okay though you know your lying to yourself. But, something happens (like the car part) and that part of you (the glowing orb) that still had hope, fades away. Or also maybe a representation of your psyche. And/or creativity.   Ether way, this song was a JOURNEY. And thank you cg5 with bribing me and thousands of others through rough times with your music that’s always relatable in some shape or form. Hang in there man. I hope to hear you on the radio one day
put this before a teenage movie
Great song keep it up
Love CG5’s and tlts music
The ending made me cry
You kinda would like cg5

The end is the feeling of losing a friend over death Ture friendship cg5

Man, this hits home *hard* I feel like Flint a lot more than I like to, and the fact I like all the stuff he makes with street art makes it feel even more personal. I’ll be honest, I kinda lost interest in CG5’s music over the years, but this, this hits differently, painfully, and beautifully.
Epic sad story
You kinda sound like CG5

what a masterpiece.
Hi cg5 I really like the songs
I just saw Joey being in the background on the pole Jelly Bean
Is it wierd I felt no emotions through the song
Sing this:  Ophelia Johnson, with hair like flames, She's fierce and bold, unafraid of games. Her heart beats fast, her spirit bright, She's a force to be reckoned with, a shining light.  Zuritorin Garcia, always wacky and wild, They make us laugh with their humor, so mild. Their smile is infectious, their spirit free, In a world so serious, they bring joy and glee.  Felicity Chen, with a heart so kind, She spreads love and joy, to all those in mind. Her positive spirit, a ray of light, She brightens up our day, with all her might.  Phobes Patel, so scared and shy, They struggle to find the courage to try. But their heart is pure, and their mind is kind, Their empathy and compassion, a treasure to find.  Olivia Kim, with a soul so calm, She's the eye of the storm, the anchor in the palm. Her wisdom and guidance, a trusted source, Her presence alone, brings peace and force.  Grace Rodriguez, with a glamorous flair, She struts with confidence, she's beyond compare. Her beauty is more than skin deep, Her strength and resilience, forever to keep.  Bononi Jones, with a sad, heavy heart, She carries the weight, of a world so hard. Her tears fall like rain, but her love shines through, She reminds us that it's okay to feel blue.  Abhita Singh, so bold and brave, She stands up for what's right, she never caves. Her courage and strength, an inspiration, She fights for justice, with all determination.  Anatemori Hernandez, with a mind so inspired, She sees the world with eyes, so open and wired. Her creativity and imagination, a gift, She's a dreamer and a doer, her spirit, a lift.  Carys Davis, with a heart full of love, She cares for all, like a guardian dove. Her warmth and kindness, a healing balm, She reminds us that love is the ultimate calm.
Do you think we will we ever see an Owl House music video from you?
I can turn off YouTube shorts
Not to mention at the start you can see SOMETHING from Omori above Tommyinnit, and due to the fact Mari is SOMETHING, is she okay? Or is she new to being in a song.

Listening to this song brings me to tears but the good kind . Like I feel heard and understood like I’m one with the song
Like a stare in the night So bright  I burn and freeze a death no other can I see a grey world I never seem to see the past In my present  For my future I forget why this posin is a toxin Is heaving in hell’s brain when I’m in  Pain  Yet it’s faint I feel quit great Maby I should take a break  . That’s what I have for a song so far. It needs a lot of work but I think it’s pretty good if ya play the right tempo and beat to it. What do ya guys think

Cg5 I dare you to make an emesis blue song. No other channel really made one yet, so I'm asking if you will emesis blue is a masterpiece. So I just want to hear one...       Just one....
This sounds like a cloudy with a chance meatballs song, really good
This should be on beat saber, most definitely. Or at least a mod or something.
Make more songs with rockit music 🎶
OMG. So many of the fandoms I'm in. ❤💙💚💜 I saw a (silhouette) of LUIGI and KIRBY (Nintendo is the besssst), I saw GRAVITY FALLS stuff, I saw AMONG US stuff and I saw ROBOT METTATON WITH LEGS (I found that absolutely gorgeous and I'm not even really in the Undertales fandom). I LOVE IT.
The little orb is _very adorable._ 💖💖💖💖
Make a gtag song
ok i feel like or3o is sadness and cg5 is happiness
The animation is amazing I can't stress how good the style is also all the references like gravity falls and many more it is just such a good song and a great video
Imagine if he made a cookie run kingdom song but also ANOTHER MASTER PIECE BY CG5 I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!101!1!1!1!
Hey I have a music video idea it’s about garden of ban ban (if you know what that is) if not go watch or play it! It’s like a rip off of poppy playtime but kinda good but you do not have to if you don’t want to
i like that it was journal 3
This make me sad save him nooo
"Walter... You're the smartest man i know... but you're too dumb to realise he already made his desicion 10 minutes ago... Do what you gotta d- *gunshot*" 0:58
You didn’t think I would notice 8 bit Ryan in there would you😎
YOU REALLY HAD TO DO US DIRTY LIKE THAT AND KILL ORBY!  Edit 1: Bro i got a like? THANK YOU
Hmmmm the song title reminds me of something but I just can't get my finger on it...
It's been eleven months since this song came out and I can't stop listening to it without stopping to reflect on how a song can convey so many emotions and have such deep meaning. I think this is not a simple song but a true masterpiece. My compliments to you CG5 and to all the people who worked on this song.
Cg5 almost cried when he saw this but I did cry
I feel it
The amount of refrances bro, goodjob!
0:05 Hello everybody, my name is MAR-

Song and animation epic but i don't know what's going on in the animation What's the context HELP HELP ME UNDERSTAND
I didn't "get it"
You know. You sound like cg5
I'm personally responsible for half the views.
Every scene has a character/thing of gravity falls ay no way he gonna make a new song about that
I loved all of the references in the graffiti and around town, my favorite was probably the 3rd journal from gravity falls since I just finished rewatching it.
Love the song
Pixel Galaxy type vibes
I really loved 0:57 that part changed my life
this is a very good song CG5 i like your music is fire
0:56 it's everywhere...

Waiting for CG5 to get verified or recognized as an official artist.

Ha ha
I WAS HIS 4 millionth SUBSCRIBER OMG
Did they forget about it???
Him running away from the bubble reminds me how fast my dad went to go get some milk from the store.
W SONG
The character even sorta looks like me I cant (literally just the hair lol)-- when I first started dealing with panic attacks I was so confused as to why and I would do self destructive things to prevent them. Forgetting doesn't help it-- they only get worse. Panic attacks-- however sucky-- taught me that I had to deal with bad things in order to overcome them.
Who else cried watching this? It is AMAZING!!!!
Bet he can’t make a song about Saul Goodman.
Do you like gravity falls or does the living tombstone like it cuz I see a lot of references from it
Best song ever
Me encanta (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠)!!!!!!!!!

Congrats on hitting 4M  🎊
If at first you don't understand, you aren't alone, but read the doc in the description and when you get it it really hits so much harder. If you don't want that, basically Flint, the person in the video, finds a glowing orb that passes through his heart and gives him happiness.He spends more time with it and forgets about the graffiti he loved to do. At one point he's in a depressed state and becomes angry for no reason then puts himself in danger. Then, the orb tries to give him the spray but he lost his spark with graffiti so he gives up on it and as the orb loses its power, it fades away.
the mimic song when
OMG AMONG US IN BG 0:03

Imagine i stole his sonic mania song from over 4 years ago and it makes into a youtube mix                          this actually happened
Is this the final music of CG5?

Ur ok if u want to add some few thing
Can you make a song about oblitus casa☺️.
2:05 - this made me cry so badly
Song idea: star so bright
Lyrics: Moving on, moving on, it doesn't really matter. My brain follows a pattern, forget about it. Breaking up, breaking down, you think it'll get better, but it never does. I feel like I'm dying, nobody tells me I'm lying, couldn't hear when I was crying, it's defeating when I'm trying to forget about it. All the silence getting louder, and louder, and louder... Maybe I'll forget about it. **instrumental** (Ta-da-da-da-da-da!) I'm spending everyday wishing I was okay surrounded by this world of grey. (Hey!) My car is broken down, I can't get out of town, so I'll walk along a road of shame. (Headache.) All my thoughts are getting scattered, am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it. All the silence getting louder, and louder, and louder... Maybe I'll forget about it. **instrumental** (Ta-da-da-da-da-da!) (Ta-da-da-da-da-da!) (Woooooah!)
coming out of a behavioral hospital after having a bad mental breakdown, this song was scarily accurate to what i felt before going and getting help.
I don’t usually listen to music like this but I started BALLING when I listened 😭😭I don’t have anxiety or depression but for some reason I still found it relatable

This man really knows how to make songs you never get tired of listening to
I don’t get it
I really like this song very emotional It was like a little ball was full of happiness and joy and shared it with a person then the person went into despair And try to receive this love but when it comes down to it double always have your back it may one day save your life😢❤

I came for kickass beats and gorgeous art. Not only got both, but with a huge helping of feels at the same time. That one hit home hard. Loved every second ❤
Well my first time listening to song was that "he made so much hype to THIS song" and after the 3rd time was "now i understand why he was making so much hype"
I saw an among us impostor in the beginning.

Cg5 You make many songs about games, Make it About Team fortress 2 And Garry's mode
Idea The next song should be your voice a little deeper and it tells the story of today or all the bad things that has been happening and it would be called Life
Can you sing the Fortnite song "Meet me in the sticks"?
Don't mind me playing this on repeat 😁
0:57  Waltuh, im a film Waltuh.

“Don’t depend someone on your happiness, but enjoy the time you have with them. You don’t know how much little time you 2 have together” -me
Can u make puss song pls
Anybody see some gravity falls references lol 😂
First thing i see when first time watching is the Book of gravity falls
Sad😢
I had a dream last night that I was having a party and CG5 came and had a mad concert 😂
I would  like to see a song about silver the hedgehog 🤩
why did this make me cry over a fictional little sun thingy
Holy dang, Breaking Bad became a movie in this universe?
My first cg5 song I have listened to and it is soooooooooo good one of my favorite songs I already know the rest are going to be bangers
This is great!!!
I don't even know what this is all about.  That being said as a young producer that often needs a reminder that I'm getting old now:  I nearly shed a tear hearing the intro. Reminds me so darn much of my early EDM days.  The spacing in the mix, the sound selection/design, the *SUPERSAAAAWS* all in the future bass style (but with the melodic dub heart) 🥲 Bravo.
bro one of the best songs ever
I love this sound could you ever make another scp song I like the scp universe And speaking of dieing I always feel like I'm dieing so relatable :')
Pls make team fortress song
two of the best youtube artists combine together
We must fine a way
1:00
POV:Jelly Bean in the background
You and living tombstone sound the same on discord and my ordinary life

This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
1:54 Nice Techno reference man, may kings never falter. There for I wish the same for you, as someone who’s currently in a somewhat similar headspace, I feel this song so much. Much love to you, thanks for the many smiles!
0:03 find among us and jelly bean

0:43 you can see bill cipher from gravity falls on the wall on the right side of the screen
@CG5 !!!!! Can you make a song using the pacer test audio!  It’s fr a vibe!!!
Moving on, moving on,  It doesn't really matter,  My brain follows a pattern. Forget about it Breaking up, breaking down You think it'll get better,  But it never does.  I feel like I'm dying  Nobody tells me I'm lying. Couldn't hear when I was crying. It's defeating when I'm trying To forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder. And louder. Maybe I'll forget about it.  I'm spending every day, Wishing I was okay. Surrendered to a world of grey. Hey. My car is broken down, I can't get out of town. So I'll walk along a road of shame. HEADACHE  All my thoughts are getting scattered. Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder To forget about it. All the silence getting louder And louder  And louder Maybe I'll forget about it. Maybe I'll forget about it.   4GET°
Who is waiting for CG5 to make a Faith song?
Can we pls get a description to the animation
can you make a scp 5000 song
You are the best music maker in this universe and you're VERY MUCH BETTER THAN BTS and good vibes only
Why the character in this video looks like Peter Parker and Ben 10 merged
I wonder who animated the music video! but the music and the beats and everything got me bopping my head, I love it!!
HOW DO YOU KNOW translate to how do you know my favorate character is sonic
THE animation is so good! The lyrics are so good! The music is so good! The singing is so good! Three legends collabing to make a godly song is too GOOD! (I love the Walter white scene) Can’t believe it’s been a year already guys
I found amogus
0:08 CG5 got splashed by a water bucket
cool.
I saw “living tombstone” and immediately got drawn in because I haven’t listened to tombstone in years  ‘Jumping devils’ used to be one of my favorites
1:00 WALTUHHHH
I saw Mettaton
headcanon:OR3O has one of the tiny moon creatures and takes it on a walk everyday and feeds it m&ms
I can relate, such a great video and definitely one of my favorite songs 😉
i like this

I love this song so much, you guys have such gorgeous voices ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ God bless you both 🤗 Thank you for this amazing song🥰 And the animation might I add is EPIC!!! Like oh my goodness all of this is so cool, I hope one day I can get as good as you all🤩🥰
Ahhhh this was my Favourite with the graffiti, cause that’s one of my core personality traits, and I also really loved the song and the animation, I loved everything tbh, I couldn’t be more happy with how hard this song went
This should not be relatable it is tho and that’s sad
0:57 u know its gonna be good when theres a breaking bad reference
The amount of references is uncountable.
Cg5 have the perfect voice for almost every song
I like how to spray paint shows all the songs he’s made
Is it just me or does this sound like the lagoon noise.
i have a bomb
WHY DO U MAKE SO GOOD SONGS I BEEN HEARING THIS FOR  2W NOW 😭
no ones talking about how like all the background character are dream team member like theres tommyinnit mumbojumbo quackity and ranboo and lots others theres so much thought behind this!
Make a song about Stanley parable please 🙏 😊
Day 1: Hey CG5 can you sing these lyrics https://youtube.com/watch?v=-Aj_Gtb9FOw&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE
@CG5 nice video it’s rlly emotional 😭  Also I wanted to ask if u take song requests?
I know I'm late but can you make a song in honor of technoblade?
Why am I crying? T T T T  This song is awesome T T ❤️❤️❤️
nice song also can you make some anime songs?
what kind of Steven univer-
At 2:19 their is a gravity falls easter egg.
Yay a lot of my favorite song creators:>
I love your songs

bill cipher in the corner 0:13
0:06 oh hi mark
Bro make a remix of my ordinary life with the living tombstone
So good but I think making a tv show on the animation would be really hype
I love the breaking bad scene
Hey CG5 do you still *kno da wae?*
I can sort of relate to the meaning behind it. Every day, from the moment I wake up to crying and telling my self to 4GET about my problems in bed every night, I constantly try to keep the relationship between my toxic manipulative family and me because it’s the only people I have to turn to. Ever since COVID started, I start to realize how intoxicating my whole family is and I have completely lost everything I had in myself physically and emotionally. Right now, I just feel like I’m the one being a manipulative jerk to my whole family and every time I try to change that has cost me my sanity. But anyway cool song dude. 👍
Don’t think I didn’t recognize the references in this like Markiplier, Tommyinit, or Chi-Chi
The symbolism that is made complete by the music and visuals in a way that works in tandem is impressive. What I get from this is, the orb is the unrebellious spirit to live without the disatification of needing to please yourself or others. To unconcern yourself to the problems that are growing. Eventually you surrender to a gray outlook on what you think you need to hold onto. And forget what matters most.
Gravity falls
CG5 forgetting he’s human with these beats-
Can I get some song ideas anyone?
Bro I heard this song of a short of kahoot
No way he actually put Walter White in here🤣
Yo was that walter
Bro whats going on
Bro someone explained what the hell just happened
0:40 geometry dash reference 🤣
You really should make a anime like this.

WALTER WHITE
The first time I heard your voice my first thought bendy and the ink machine you brought back my childhood
How it feels to have anxiety:
Not mettaton though
My favorite artist come together 🥲
Incredible collab
anyone see jenna marbles? in the 0:05 timestamp area. I love that cute touch if that is her
Looks like a fnf mod
Hear me out. *Dead space?*
The scene with breaking bad made me laugh a lol bit
The best trio
Bro is that Walter white?
CG5, I know this is a weird request, but my friend @headbandvr wants me to make a song for him. If you make the song it would be glorious. He thinks I look like you. If you see this the name above is his yt channel if you need to do some research. It would be greatly appreciated
When it comes to music base videos, I know you work hard and put your heart for these people too see, people has been amazing about your music base videos it maybe long but the longer it takes we know the better. So give yourself a pat on the back, you have been a great success of being a music composer. Like if you see, you have been doing collaborations with people  like OR3O, and more, even a very popular minecraft youtuber like, Badboyhalo, Skeepy, Captin Puffy, and well, worth it.💎😁❤️
i always wanted this collaboration
SPLIT SECOND mtt 1:27  And frisk
Walter white
I love how the orb dies and that one person in the chat goes: "SLAAYYYY"
This guy was crying to a remix of the Kahoot song
1:26 metty and frisk
Oh my god I loved all those references!!!!!
Your good
Give me your phone number mr CG5
0:17 It looks like a Spray can is laughing so hard rn. Did y'all notice that?
This song had me so emotional with the animation and the lyrics really brought me closer to the song then ever, hey man great job do ever give up, please keep it up it’s music like yours that keeps me going
This is giving.animated James apology video song

I’m confuse what the heck is happening?
Anyone else see the Gravity Falls reference at 2:19 ?
Who has been here since he made among us songs
I don't know what that orbie thing is but I would gladly trade my life for his.
cg5 = rizz and swag
Insanely good song as always man.
CG5, TLT, and OR3O in one song. Time to vibe~
Can u make a weird core song next
so many references
I know I don't fit in here but I do not understand what this song is about
It’s so good 🥲
1:22 cursed pause moment
It’s hot👍
just finished watching breaking bad and lose to easter egg hahahha
Me realising there is No technoblade in the start of the  Video😢
one of my favorite OG's and one of my favorite artists I just found out about. ,":)
huh so no one knows that this LITERALLY TAKES A YEAR TO MAKE or maybe not...
Why sam haft looked like metroman?
I hate this. It’s so detached from reality and actual problems. The fact adults make songs that show “relation” to the self-inflicted trauma and other mental illnesses of the children of this generation is horrific and disturbing because it only feeds the existential dread
Walter
KIRBY!!!
Waltuh
Awesome
0:27 I saw that book seems dipper is that guy in future
Wlater 😂
finally a collab vid with cg5
we've been waiting since he ate the living tombstone's sandwich https://youtu.be/r8fhFvy6oNA
Lol
To be fair ever since he took a 3month break I forgot him but I’m back
You know shits bout to get real when your favorite artists collabs
Idk why but this song resonates with woth and I dint even fully get the meaning behind the vidoe
U forgot some people but it’s fine 0:01
Wait… do these have references… the Kahoot short from CG5 and possibly duolingo’s theme.
Been putting off watching this. Regret it. This a banger.
This Is ok

CG5 YOU THINK I WOULDNT NOTICE!!!!!!! AT 0:04 SECONDS IN IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAFFITI ON THE WALL IT SAYS “THE LIVING TOMBSTONE” AND AT 0:06 SECONDS IF YOU LOOK AT TGE BLUE BUILDING YOU CAN SEE OR3OS NAME
The most legendary collab in YouTube music history
Something about all this tickles me a weird but perfect way. Especially the luhdludleluh sound or whatever it is 🤧❤️
This is my new favorite song. felicidades, encontraste un comentario en español
Love the gravity falls references
He told you not to 4get about him
imagine a remix omg best music ever
Did anyone notice meteton from undertale
It feels like this story is describing the feelings of the creators... Many of the past works have lost creators and fans, and some people were full of love for a certain favorite work, and finally left with only confusion, exhaustion, boredom, and indifference to it, and finally chose to abandon their former love and leave. But looking back, they are always in place, as long as you look back, they are always waiting for the one you who was full of love.
The song is already fantastic but the video speaks VOLUMES on top of it
🔥
Since you know spanish could you make an acount in spanish for those fans of yours who only speak spanish (like me)
so many youtubers i saw jelly bean and a guy from dreams channel
Hey Charlie look at this :D https://youtube.com/shorts/KirfKhaD6iM?feature=share

cg5 pls do a song on the roman empire please lol
Oh my God Walter Hartwell White from a popular American tv show called Breaking Bad omg omg
Just can't seem to 4get about this song.
This song made me cry the second time I watched it, and it made me think about stuff.  Basically you find something you love to have, you spend a lot of time with it and get it whatever it needs, and then you eventually lose what gives you happiness.  Good job CG5, TLT, and OR3O
Cg5 Could you make meme songs?
I love this song and I see Kirby
Hey dude i think you should sing miss you from oliver tree, you know, the sigma song, i think it will be very cool and awesome!
Walter White moment
Epik song
This makes me so happy to listen to, but at the same time every time I watch it I ball my eyes out.
TripLe Collab

The best part is the Technoblade art in the alleyway. o7
Damn, that fr escalated faster than my father leaving to get milk.

Why I feel like this is for me?
Can you make a Roblox doors song please? You don’t have to if you dont want to.
why cg5 why😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
CG5 I have loved all of your songs so much, and this one is just amazing, but I was wondering something. I'm working on a ARG called the SCK, but i'm missing something, a theme song. I was wondering if you could make a theme song for the SCK, it would be them main theme of the SCK. In the "about" page on my channel is a link to the SCK website, I love you music so much and this would make me so happy. Have a good day, Mr Tim Atom's.
Was that 8bit Ryan?
Oooooo can you another henery stickmin song
You should name the orb steel so it wil be flint and steel :o)
Holy crap this song blew me away.
Amazing song always on repeat 😀😀

I read the story Honestly, I can relate to this
I love all the gravity falls easter eggs in this music video 😂
The song is good man keep up the good work
Awesome
i see you gravity falls book
cg5 fr put walter white in the song such a chad
The end made me cry 😭
I have a song idea! There's a storm brewing in the sky And the world is on the brink of ending All the signs are there, we're in the end times And the end of the universe is near  There's no turning back, we're on the path to destruction The final days are upon us, and there's nothing we can do  The end is coming, and there's nothing we can do So let's go out with a bang, let's party like there's no tomorrow  When the universe ends, we'll all be gone But the memories of us will still remain  So let's go out with a bang, let's party like there's no tomorrow  And when the universe ends, we'll all be gone But the memories of us will still remain
This is soo sad and cool idk why?
Relatable
JELLY BEAN GET DOWN DAT POLE

Uhm Hello... I'm scared  I've made a Nightmare  Here It Is: "I Just encountered you, but i started doing bad Things... Then (idk how) i transformed into a mimikyu and started avoiding people,  And you didn't care about It..." But you're still my favourite singer
The last part Actually had me crying
Omg this is awesome and just hits really close this is like the 3rd comment I've made on this videk

You know it’s a good day when CG5 uploads!
Damn he made me cry to
I know this is nothing to the real meaning of the song but the end sounds like the duo lingo song
Who else saw the gravity falls reference
I watched the video, and loved the music. I read the story, and felt connected. I watched again, and cried. Thank you :)
Hi cg5, you probably won’t see this but I absolutely loved your song. This is my 11th time listening to it, it hits me in amazing places and I love your work. The first place I saw you was ground 0 with random encounters. I really do hope you continue with amazing songs like this. I do hope you get to see this and maybe the community might allow you to see this. Thank you CG5  Edit: I posted this ages ago and I didn’t expect this to happen. I’m on my 52nd run of the song and I can’t get enough. Thank you all

I feel like I just watched a full-length movie
Walter is breaking the bad
the fact that i was watching a tiktok of him making people react to it and my ex just was in it casually lmao
One question, I Remember a video of you signing like a song that went like: do you want the voices to stop from making your mind go pop! And you said it will be realeased on Jan 27th on your profile, AND ITS PASSED IT OMGGGGGGGGG… but I do know you’ve created over 100 songs, and you put a lot of effort into this, but uhm you don’t have to really rush this request, because idc, but.. JUST PLS DO IT!!!
Gravity falls reference and also a pun in the title
This gives me heavy FRND vibes, I fuckin love it!
I think you should do a video where you make songs of other peoples ideas
Can you make a song about the legend of Zelda?
0:03 AMONG US
Why was he turning grey tho?
You should do a song on Roblox Doors. Seems like a very good game to make a song on.
Things I love about this song:    1: Very Relatble  Me and many others struggle with major anxiety and feel dissconected from one's they care about and struggle to open with it.  2: Amazing Animation   The Animation never lost quality and never disappointed me, the Animatitors did a great job.  3: The References.  Right from the start of the songs ie alot of References, such as parapa the rapper on the graffiti.  4: The song  is great.  CG5, The Living Tombstone and OR3O did an amazing job.   Keep making music CG5!!!
I almost cried at the end
0:57 WALTUH
AYYYYYYYYYY YOU GUYS MADE A COMEBACK!!!!!!!!! CG5 AND OR3O!!
This song is like 4 BIG guys
Did you guys see jellybean go down that red pole? (I think it’s an Easter egg)
It's a half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown - John Prine

I saw jelly bean sliding down a pole at the start lol 😅
0:05 8-bitryan
BRO I JUST LOVE HOW THEY PUT JELLYBEAN ON THE LIGHT she/he would definitely have done that
this is so cool :00 also. love the music :DD
This hit so hard...
It was so good I looked at it twice
Just the quote "don't be sad that things are gone, be happy they happend" was like the only thing I could think about when I watched this
I honestly thought this was about drugs the first time i heard it.
Amazing!
Well finaly my 3 music favorite teams come together to make  this amazing song
Amogus hiding in the backround...

WHY WAS THE ENDING SO SAD,good song though
I love this song so much, it made me really sad by the end of it, but I absolutely love it. Great job!!
Hey, CG5, I don't know if you take suggestions, but can you write a song about Hazbin Hotel and/or Helluva Boss? I would absolutely love that!!
The animation is so well put together, and the music is perfection, I'm really impressed with the combination that you guys have done, You guys are truly skilled.
Walter White: jesse, JESSE!, WE ARE INSIDE A VIDEO OF CG5 JESSE 0:58
TLT, CG5, and OR3O?  What kind of fever dream did i just fall into.
The way sounds itself is played with in this song is amazing. The little vocal riffs are great lol. Amazing job with this one
The song talks abot how a depressed person feels (kinda) its when someone wants to escape a world of grey yet haves a litte hope but it ends up dieing bc of depresion or something close to that if someone actually knows how to explain it better please say as idk if i am correct or not
Whats the lore i wanna know
animation 10/10  music10/10  cg5 10/10

Hello Cg5 I have been listening to your songs since you came out with the song “Show Yourself” it was a pretty good among us song XD This was amazing it made me cry at the end it is beutiful and heartbreaking tho but really cool! I would love for you to make a nother song kind of like this but that’s your choice XD. we’ll keep this up bro! ✌ Peace!
The animation and song were amazing, but I’m ashamed to admit I got really happy about the cameos at the start XD
Finally my dream of this colab as come.
Day 115 looking to get a heart or pin😌👌
Major feels all round
This song is really touchy. When i found out what the message is giving. It made me think that it is really right to accept it.      "Life is a cycle, we will meet again in a different time and face"   -Bread
In rlly love this :)
Man, at the beginning it was a happy life. The Ending is so Sad how his best friend which i don't know what that thing is, well, died. So Sad that i 40 percent cried. Not Almost though. When the moon shined to his art on the walls after his friend died. He tried to feel happy again. However, i Don't know what Show or game is this but i think that it is an original song as it was entitled there. THE SONG IS GREAT AND SAD AT THE SAME TIME!!! Thanks CG5 for making this.
1:00 waltuh

3 OF MY FAVORITE ARTISTS? IT'S A BLESSING!
The most replayed part is at the very end when the screen is black
I love the gravity falls references
im crying from the end of the vid 🥲
This part is sooo cool 5:50 😂😂😂
Anyone else see Bill Cipher?
Omg I love the song because I didn’t listen to the music video, I listened to it on Spotify and I loved it! Now that I have watched the music video, I understand the true meaning and I love hearing this trio! Such a cool song!
0:59 Wowww
“All the silence getting louder, and louder.”  Yep, relatable. Being in complete silence really bothers me and for some reason, it feels like there’s noise even though there isn’t.
Bro Has a person with anxiety I can find this relatable and good You know anxiety make me feel less than my classmates or bullys how do I like to call them  They just say  “You can’t feel anxiety because I have anxiety and you can’t have it” or “the music you listen is NOT music” And this music make me feel happy in my worst moments bro Good music Let’s go❤
i love the different game references and different artist references everywhere. Obviously the best thing is how personal this song is to him.           Small random side note: I have never seen this much undertale and deltarune references is in so long in one video
0:26 Oh cool, a Gravity Falls Reference!
Aradir ?
I have successfully learned how to play this on piano
I love the animation in this video and the style your all doing amazing Oreo, Cg5, and The Living Tombstone keep ip the amazing work this is amazing ive listend to this over at least 100 times and the story that the video goes with the music is amazing the character design is amazing this is my favorite song     , your all so talented snd this shows what artists can do together.

Damn... talk about one powerful video to hit you where it hurts
Hey, this song is actually awesome and unique, the animation is godly, and The story is deep. However, I’m not sure why at the start Flint’s hair is brown at the start, and grayish blue later on.

Nice song! But okay with this story telling I would really like it if this concept story for this music video  became a TV show with the same art style.
I’d be amazing if you could make a wilbursoot song plz
I freaking love the art style🤩🥰😍 (that crying scene tho😭😭😭😭😭😱
Holy muffins, why is it so good😯😧😭🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍
Best part is the breaking bad part
The cross over we all been waiting for
Do welcome to the internet
love this song so much your the reason why I started studying music making
CT0 are the best trio.
2 Secrets:   0:01 = Badboyhalo Is Leaning.  0:03 = Jellybean Was Going down Because She Was In A Light Pole.
New idea for lyric: Welcome to my ocean of live, and pls decide what you grow... Pls try to do this lyric!
I have watched this so many times and I love all of the references to games and shows in the graffiti! I really love this song
That animation is amazing...i cry
What does the video mean? Anyone?👇
The music is very like chill
Perfect combo to me atleast, of having anxiety, trying to hide it, and having your thoughts completely come to hit you.
My fav part is when AMOGUS
OMG IS THAT JELLYBEAN AT 0:03?!
2:00 CG5: ' badadadada-' Or3o: *screams in musical style*   Yes, late comment, I know. Shush.
I whach your first song and i like it 😁😀😁😀😁😀😀😀😁😀😁😀😁😀😁😀😁😀😁😀😁😀😁😀😁😀😁😀😁😀😁😀

#emokid

What a great idea lets get 3 of the best musical people out there and make an original song also the animation is flawless
This hits harder than when I first heard it. My gf juts broke up with me bc and I reacted the same way that flint did. Holding on to her even tho she needed to be let go. And that you may try to save it but it just isn’t meant to last. Thank you CG5, Or3o and TLT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH,my grandpa passed away last week and this song helped me and it told me to forget about it Thank you so much keep it up 👍
I like the breaking bad reference
OR3O came from megalovania lyrics to freaking collabing with epic popular song makers, she’s lucky as hell.
0:04 AMONGUS
When you watch at 2:14 at 2X speed ot looks like some sort of shitpost
Hi
WALTER WHITE!!!
Jelle ben
CG5 I saw the living tombstone easter agg this video
Just cant describe how good this vibe i got from this song, best for you cg5
cg5 and or3o is the best song duo i cant lie
This is the greatest song that i heard great job man!!    And i just didn't realize i just saw so many people that i know
what is this based off
0:57  the breaking bad reference got me cackling😭
hol up did i see jelly bean?
The animation makes this so much better
I love this so much, The animation, All the youtubers, streamers, easter eggs, and people overall, the storyline, cute blob AAA Everything about it is awesome
Or3o!!! The living tombstone!?!???!? And cg5!? Certainly the best music collab in history
It's crazy how I imagine all of your songs with animations like this, especially in the beginning with the logos and slow fades. Crazy.
Beat Sounds like the kahoot music… i like it!
Whats the original video title?
i just wanna say, is that arp fill in the drop layered with an Arpeggiated vocal?? Single Handed one of the best layering aspects i would’ve never thought of. Absolutely brilliant!
Beautiful this is just a masterpiece
Everything about this is amazing, the artists/content creater references, the fandom references, the music and singing it self, the art it self, the "meaning" or "feeling" you can see or get or relate from it. It's All. Amazing. More than amazing- I don't know, just a banger :D Edits: GrAmMaR
Man’s lives so close to getting IssaKaid
Such a nice video! All the emotions were properly displayed, the lyrics were great, the animation was the best! The song I can now relate to a whole lot, keep going!
BRO I LOVE THIS WHAT AN AMAZING SONG I also love ALL the references  OMG ITS SO GOOD 👌🤩
The mc looks very similar to me. Thick eyebrows, blue eyes, dirty blonde hair, messy and very puffy, semi deep eye bags. What an uncanny resemblance
@cg5...Make a song about furries?
oh my geee
Fnaf the musical I never forget it
0:58      is waltuh?!?!??!!!!!!!!

Quality over quantity is the right way to go your music is incredible keep it up ❤❤
I always check out new songs from CG5 ever since two years ago, I personally think this one should be featured in a mental health matters collection with other AMAZING artwork from CG5 or other artists, after losing someone to suicide, some songs need to be heard
Dang, this is really good
Look at CG5’s first video more than 5 years ago. Now look at him at the top with collaborating and amazing animations! Keep going CG5!!!! ❤️❤️
waltuh. wake up waltuh.

Yo Mr white who's at the door
I always love the voice and animation

Maybe I’ll forget about it…badabadabadada
I love the song and the animation!
CG5 Returns!!
I may not know much about CG5 but this was really cool. Loved all the references. The song was pretty good. Not intentional but I liked how the main character reminded me of Kryoz.
to be my 1 song on spotify
"Maybe I'll forget about it"  Literally why the longest I've been mad is 30 minutes
Jit sneank in tommyinnit
The fact that they can fit so many memes into a music video about anxiety just makes it more relatable

I like the breaking bad reference

Did anyone notice the technoblade tribute at 1:56? There is also names of the people who worked on the project at 0:06. At the top-right of the purple building, there is Brenda Maryan’s name in graffiti. In the top left, there is the name Ollie Smallwood, who also worked on the project. Below it is a supposed mouse which could be read as Micah. They also worked on the song. Don't even get me started with all the Gravity Falls graffiti.
Can you make a one shot song unless you already have it’s coming back alive
CG5 if you stop YouTube we all will be sad coz all the songs you do is really good😊

I've been listening to this song non stop since it came out, and am only now noticing tommyinnit and badboyhalo in the beginning lol.
I will listen to it 24/7 The song is beautiful
I love all this work, it's very impressive how they include all the references, also the story of the video is a bit sad, because after all the ball saves the protagonist, and then when it fades away, that made me very sad, really very good job
Cg5

Ngl why do some of the scenes in the beginning remind me of Helluva Boss S2 Seeing Stars
I feel like I’m playing rhythm doctor
this song is hard.. to listen to
Not going to lie, I actually had a dream before the song came out where you told me to not forget about it's release! It was kinda weird and made it seem like your were sneaking it into my head. I love this song a lot and I have it saved on my playlist too! I realize now, after listening to it a bunch, that you kinda played around with your words in the shorts. You told us not to forget about the song, but the song is called 4Get. I found it very clever! Can't wait for another song to come out so I can listen to it on repeat too. You were my top artist in 2022 after all. ☺️
Anyone else notice the Dream SMP in the beginning?
Cg5 I love your songs so much I found out about you with every door and now listen to your songs every day 😀
0:03 anyone else see jellybean on the pole lol
Ok I like this
That walter white scene falling got me.
You will not get away with this i almost cried in the middle of a Starbucks!  But for real i love this ❤ and it really does a good job of embodying mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts. This is so going on a playlist ❤❤❤
No way one of the Graffiti said L + Ratio 💀
Damn I love the animation!!!🥰
This song is incredible! I suffer from a lot if anxieties, but this song is the motivation I need to keep going. So thank you CG5 for your incredible music, you are an inspiration to me.
waltuh
0:26 look towards the right and there is metaton and frisk
ɪ sᴀᴡ ᴊᴇʟʟʏʙᴇᴀɴ
The trinity
Day one of asking for a dragon ball super song 🤞
I don't quite understand the metaphor, but this is a hella good song! I kind of wish that the cute boi didn't have to die. Great story and song!
This is absolutely wonderful and very deep! It's going to get better ^^
:) (HAS IS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD CG5 AND The Living Tombstone  And OR3O Im Like 4GET)
You know it's a good song when it can show so much emotion, love the song
who else thought OR3O's voice was the living tombstones voice because of this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk-aCL6eyGc
why does the background sound like kahoot??
Walter Wip
actual masterpiece,IMO, your magnum opus. The lyrics, the beat, the vocals, the animation, references, all perfect
I only understhood what W.W. died BRUUUUUUUH
talking pills
Never cease to absolutely amaze me.
I LOVE THE TECHNOBLADE TRIBUTE AT 1:54 thanks for it <3
First banger of 2023👍
This song was amazing and I loved the collab! Just want to say did anyone see the gravity fall’s reference at 2:18? Anyway great job to all of you guys!!! 🎉
My friend worked on this (: YES
Amazing video CG5!
BROOOO THIS IS SO GOOD THE ANIMATION THE LYRICS THE VOCALS A CHEFS KISS AND THE NOSTALGIA😍💢
DO A DOORS ONE
I was gonna say something corny, but I’m speechless
really great song! (+ the mv's beautiful)
Only after watching it for 3 times i saw Glamrock Freddy, Dream,and the others at the start of the vid when he was doing graphity😅
Yooo that’s so cool! Good song CG5! :D
Of course he put Walter white in
I feel this song 😭
So I’ve been a TLT fan for probably like 6 or 7 years? But this song just made me like CG5 more than before :]
I had tears
Is that Ryan at 0:03
Move commenters! There’s a theorist with a theory in hand!  The guy from the animation (apologies if he has a name) seems to be happy with what he does but seems lonely, then he finds the yellow ball, we’ll call it Ball, they make memories together and at the end Ball dies, but the guy isn’t sad, he rather looks at the moon with a smile, thinking about his friend. I feel like this is a representation of happiness and how we can find it and lose it, but not completely, there will always be something that will make us happy, and when he starts to become gloom and sad, he tries to forget about those emotions and replaces them with happiness which is not very healthy to force your emotions, but then he also starts to forget how to be happy, leading him to be angry at Ball suddenly. So I feel like that’s when he starts to lose Ball, not when it gets hit by a car.  (By the way, great animation quality and song dude! Keep it up my man!)  That’s just my theory, what’s yours?
I love how on the wall there’s a bunch of characters from his songs 0:24
Bill Cipher!
1:39
This is some Steven universe, smp, 4get about it, journal 3 in the background from gravity falls and jelly bean sliding down a pole CROSSOVER🗿🗿🗿
animation is very similar in style to the series "infernal boss" :)
Can we see an instrumental of this? And another amazing Collab♥!
CG5 + TLT + OR3O = AN AMAZING SONG
this kinda reminds me of ralph and tom
aww I love This so much! firstly, you guys voices are AMAZING! the music is such a catchy rhythm! and the animation is BEAUTIFUL! the meaning always makes me smile as well :) thanks you guys for making this!
Idk what this song supposed to tell us  Maybe cuz I'm dumb or I'm too young either way idk
Idea a owl house song
I accedintly played this max volume in class funnest experinc din my entire life hehehehehehheeh
THIS IS LITERALLY MY CHILDHOOD COMBINED WITH MY CHILDHOOD AND CHILDHOOD *the 3 LEGENDARY artist in this song*
0:04 we got jellybeen falling to death and AMONGUS
anyone noticed markipliers pink thing?
Did anyone else spot jellybean on the lamp post at the start 🤣
Truly one of the best song this channel ever saw. Really great art, lyrics, melody, instrumental, storytelling... Everything is merging together to make a masterpiece. Great job!
the last part is litteraly me after my uncle died, i miss him alot.
This song speaks to me about anxiety that I didn't think a song could, the words "Maybe I'll forget about it" shows that effort to just make the anxiety or the constant unreasonable sadness leave by simply forgetting about it and the running from the issue, wanting something like art to bring you out of it and spending time doing things to try and make it better or distract yourself from it is such a journey this song portrays in such a short amount of time. I simply love it and the vocals and instrumental is amazing
Best song That i have heard from CG5 I going to share your channel To others
I thought it was 4 g e t It's forget
I just heard this song just now and it really helped with my depression. I got out of a toxic relationship with this really jealous girl who was paranoid over nothing and this song helped me @CG5 thanks for making me forget about it!
I'm sorry for your anxiety
Waltuh is in theater!!!!
2:08
How is 1 man able to release absolute bangers non-stop
1:05
This song is sooo good! 🤩  That's the 5 time I watch this in a day...
BILL CIPHER KIRBY SONIC AMOGUSSSS (great animation btw)
Yo CG5 put many different fandoms in one song video!
It's just me or the is fire
Is it just me, or did anyone notice that the letter "I" is the only letter to be lowecased in the lyrics? Does this symbolise that it is Flints's thoughts, mistakes, or ANYTHING at all relating to Flint?!  Btw, the music is such a banger! Really good song, visual effects, and the animation and art style! I also loved all of the tiny references to other games and people!
1:00 was a pretty good reference.
Loved all of the pop culture references
For your next song I want you to make fnaf with helpy saying YOU QUESTION THE WORDS OF THE MIGHTY JIMMY https://youtu.be/9Aa-j3c_Bks
Everyone: this is so good!!! ❤😊 Me: why is nobody talking about jellybean at the start Edit:just say THIS IS SO ADORABLE BUT SAD😭
i love when original songs have these little music videos that have dozens of shout outs to the friends and community, it's always such a blast seeing familiar faces and references
Did I cry at this, y e s.
1:00 waltuh😊
Can u make video of that guy who sounds like u? Like a collab 😊
That was amazing the beat was perfect
fantastic
Which god was Kirby fighting? Galeem or Chaos Elfilis?
The three things my brain is saying:   1) Kirby fights God lul 2) I love the animation 3) this feels insensitive to the song's message
How did we go from funny Ohio song to depression
Ignorance is bliss
0:04 Hold on... was that Markiplier?
Look I'm know I'm late  But the art and the song  1000/1000 And I see maybe other characters in the art
I just noticed the leg of mettaton, Jellybeans tail, and the details of the spray paint
Petition for cg5 to make a medley (founders pack) like dagames
IS NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT THE SOMETHING REFERENCE AT 0:02 !?!?!
My three favorite creators in one song, I love this song so much. Also I don’t way but this song is so relatable
THE AMONGUS IN THE BACKGROUND AT 0:03 :OOOO

00:01 YO ITS MARI
0:41 GRAVITY FALLSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

Charlie woke up one day and chose VIOLENCE. I here for it.❤
Between phoenix of the sea and clover they both help me have peaceful sleep.
Day 1 of asking cg5 to do a scp-001 when day breaks song
I totally didn’t cry😢
The end almost made me cry it’s that good 😭👍
This is a *MASTAPEECE*
How did Charlie do this? The song: happy The animation at the end: somehow sad
nice💖
w h a t .
This gotta be the best song I've ever heard
I saw bill cypher and I think Gabriel from TMC You can’t change my mind
Drugs
It’s a vibe ngl
CG5 Is an amazing artist and he deserves a Grammy for his music
Did anyone else notice all of the gravity falls references? Maybe a hinting a follow up song about gravity falls!
@cg5 is this about a guy going through the loss of his friend?
It helps me calm down and feel about what have i done to my friends and family by being rude to them. Thank you for making this song and hope you make good songs in the future and have a Good day.
Alright Imma admit it. It's not mid.
does eveybody know all the youtubers in the video :)
THERES SO MANY EASTER EGGS OMG
Biggest crossover ever shown to mankind😮
I Love the song but it was real tempting to not say "does it l care?"
OR3O was definetly a highlight for me in this song. Good job to you all!
bigtunes
Idk who this guy is but I want him to be okay.
This is a masterpiece💖
What was story about the song was great but I don’t even know what the story meant
I love this bro <3
Anyone else notice jellybean on the pole at 0:03
I love how it references multiple things and the video is stunningggg. Also the song slaps so hard 🔥🔥🔥
If I don't see this nominated for song of the year             Hmm scrolling still?         Forget About it             Lol funni lyric joke        again if this isn't nominated        GET THE TECHNO BLADE SHAPED SHA-
Music is self is meh, music video/animation is 10/10
I was wondering if in honor of technoblade you could make song about him almost like I see a dreamer
What is osu
You guys should do a Hollow knight song
This type of songs bring me so much joy !<3
The song is amazing! I hope you keep releasing songs as good as this one! Keep it up CG5
00:01 THat's SOMETHING
0:56 - 1:03
This is currently may favorite song
I wonder if cg5 is gonna make a song for cult of the Lamb
This song, especially the music video, embodies exactly how it feels to undergo panic and anxiety. You really want to forget about it, but you can't because you need to grow from your experiences. Even the negative ones. This song gave me the feels, man.
THIS WAS AMAZING! What do you guys animate on, it’s incredible!
I see sussy at 3
I don’t know if anyone else saw but I think cg5 got water splashed on him
who noticed jellybean?
Didn't y'all see something like the Mandela catalog on their
The fact that he was watching breaking bad
I love this music video so much of all of the difrint youtubers included in the video
i got caught off guard i saw mari from omori at 0:01
League*

Walter
Walta

in "i got no time" when nightmare appears the first time theres only five of him, indicating "five nights" at freddies
Why is it only 2 minutes 😭😭
eh, fugget about it
Why did I start tearing up when that little bastard made put of light died?
You better make a remix of "Harder, Better, Faster, Whopper".  I won't breathe until you make it.
Plss initial d next
The best part is at 1:53 don't lie to me.
I saw jelly bean in the backround at 0:03
THE COLLAB WE NEVER KNEW WE NEEDED!!! 🎉🎉🎉❤❤
Does his hair change colour based on emotions, or does he get older?
This is literally legendary!
Dam this bops,going on my playlist
Amazing vid! The animation, the music, even the water white part. cool
“The perfect crossover doesn’t exist”
I love it
AWWWW
nice!! as a graffiti artist, i love everything about this vid. love you Charlie! ALSO PLEAAASASSSEEEE MAKE A NICKACADO SONG not that im a fan of him but i mean funnnyyyy
Hey CG5, please can you put this on amazon music? Thanks!
Do a tribute song for technoblade   👇
HOW IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW EVERY SINGLE GRAFITI THERE RESEMBLES EIGHTHER AN ARTIST, SINGER, SONG, AND FANDOM THIS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN IN?!  THIS IS SO GOOD TO THE POINT WORDS CANT EXPLAIN IT, FROM THE LYRICS, TO THE ANIMATIONS, THE DESIGN, THE EMOTION AND THE SCENERY, EVERYTHING HERE IS JUST TOP NOTCH AND DESERVES TO BE IN A MUSEUM FOR HOW GOOD THIS LOOKS, SOUNDS, AND FEELS. THIS IS SO WELL PUT TOGETHER I HAD TO PAUSE EVERY TWO MILISECONDS JUST TO ENJOY EACH FRAME, CAN WE GET AN APLAUSE FOR CG5, THE LIVING TOMBSTONE AND OR3O FOR MAKING THIS? AND FOR ALL THE ARTISTS WHO HELPED TO TURN THIS INTO A MASTERPIECE?? THEY SURE DID LEAVE ME SPEACHLESS!!
I liked it that bill cipher is in one of the opening scenes of the music video
Hey cg5 I didn’t listen to u for a couple of years and then after I watched u again I noticed u have the same Mario plushie like me 💀💀💀💀💀💀
I feel like this could be a drug addiction metaphor, like sure the ball of light helps at first, but its effect wears off and starts to cause withdrawals in him whenever its not passing through him and causes stress.  Not maybe not idk
did i see a gravity falls reference?
YO OR3O  THE ONE TO SUPPORT CG5 IN ONE OF HER ENCANTO SONG😮😮😮
I'VE ALWAYS WAITED FOR THIS COLLAB!!!! MY FAV SONG CREATORS XDDDDD
Waltuh
OMORI REFERENCES IN THE BEGINNING NO WAY
does OR30 mean "or thirty" or "oreo"
This video would be much sicker with my animated artworks
i love jellybean on the pole
me falta culto :,v
oh look a song that explains "lyrics dont fit the mood of the song"   i love it :D
It' so fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can we all just appreciate how perfect the animation is when he says "mabe I'll forget about it" at the beginning!
This is a masterpiece and one of the best songs I’ve ever listened too! I love it so much!
This song is such a vibe!
This song is the flippin’ best! It makes me think it’s about how people used to miss the great years of 2010-2019, and that moving on and growing up can be the hardest thing ever.   But then we begin realizing that maybe we should be happy to have those great times and amazing memories, we should be happy that experiences like that could make us miss it so much or make us this sad.  I love this song, thank you, makes it easier to move on
Aaacck, I put off listening to this for SOOOO long... THIS WAS AAMAZING
Man Everyone did an amazing job The music, the animation and more is just a 100000000/10 man  Keep doing what you do! ❤
"YOO MR.WHITE YOU GOT A FEATURE IN CG5'S LATEST HIT. 4GET"    "Jesse that's impossible no way i-"  [K but for real love the song man 😭 The more and more I listen to it I keep getting hooked]
im the guy who was to dumb to understand it and had to look in the discription
I JUST READ THE WHOLE STORY ABOUT THIS MUSIC VIDEO AMD IM TEARING UP AAAHHHH
So Easter eggs and references
This makes me want to cry  Also this music video has so many refs to video games and such which I think is cool
is it me or did i just see mark at the 5 second mark?
Love all the references. Like breaking bad.
i paused it at 1:54 and almost started crying when i saw the techno reference :((( This is genuinly a really good and emotional song and the animation is amazing. good job <33333
walter white!11!1!1!!1!1!1!1
I love all the little secrets!Expecially abd and tommy at the start and markipkier
Saw this on an ad That a banger tho
The lyrics describes omori's story perfectly
I'm confused. How does his hair turn from brown to grey and the colors leave, then reappear when the ball dies. I'm lost.
I was confused about the meaning of the song so I just read the lyrics and their kind of... sad.
sort of reminds me of Chalk Tablet Towers by Gorillaz in a good way
THIS IS SUCH A BANGER WHAT also the animation is AMAZING
The beats are wrong for the pictures he was crying the beat didn't fit it.
Yo cg5 do Never Be Alone Again pls I'm begging you
Wow this is unbelievably amazing ❤
so many references
The little guy disappearing was sad 🥺
NOOOOOOO THE ORB
Great song! I want to see an Italian version of this, don't ask why😐😐
amaaaaaazing😎😎😎
I been listening to this song every day  now its my new favorite song:)
Non-Lyric Lyrics:  Hey!  Dududedududu  Dududedududu Hayyy-ayy-ayyyy ay-hayayyyyyy Ey oh-oh Dududedududu Woahe-eoohe-eoooh he-hoeoo-ooo-e-oh Ooohhhhhhhhhhh Wehadeh
I love you so much CG5.

Waltuh
0:58 W A L T U H
don't pause at 1:21
I can't say I know what others are going through but I've had my own experience with anxiety and depression and I really hope everyone is doing okay (meaning Charlie, OR3O, TLT, and everyone in the comments, too). The past 5 months have been the worst for me and it feels like it's simultaneously been a week and an eternity that continues to stretch into infinity with no end in sight. I've been so close to reaching out yet never do because the thought is so scary. But as other comments I've seen have said, healing is definitely a journey and everyone is on their own journey. I don't know what the point of this comment is and I typically delete my comments anyway because they get so long and nobody's gonna read them and it feels pointless to even try to put my voice out there when the internet is like an ocean but I guess I'll force myself to leave it in case someone does find it and maybe needs to hear it? So I guess that's what this is, if you're reading this, I hope you takes the steps necessary to become a better you, as scary as that may be. Take that leap of faith and you'll find yourself in a path to a brighter future, yeah?  Also the song is amazing btw, I forgot to mention that ^^,
hell mari at 00:01 to 00:02 at top right corner below the bridge and above the two guys
Masterpiece
I this song about narc@tics
2:23 okay so here me out, *the orb is the moon*
Cg5, Are you And OR3O Friends? this video was awesome,  because all my favorite singer collab to do this amazing song.
You were already such a good artist but the collab with TLT is just insane
What game is this about?
Not the mettaton grafiti
The most emotional song i ever heard
I love all of the Gravity Falls references in the video
Bro i got this song as an ad for the cg5 chanal
I love 8-BitRyan at the beginning!
That’s one that I’m saving!
It's such a wonderful song! I know what I'll be listening everyday sonce now ❤️ thank you for this masterpiece. The ending hits very much. Thank you again! ❤️
Perfection at its finest
I was watching the video... and the first person I noticed was Markiplier.                                                                                      I am a *VERY* simple person.
I'm not crying you, are
why do i feel like ive seen this before
It’s a good song. A lot of references with the graffiti cool video 10 out of 10.
1:20-1:40 best part hand down
Welcome back I miss your songs and I love tehm
Week come back gc5
This kinda made me a bit sad because of what's happening at here by my house and in my live. And this song reminded me of the problems i have. But it's a good song
Why is something behind Tommy innit? 0:01
I appreciate the Gravity Falls references. Thanks, I know how hard you guys worked on this and it’s amazing!
All the references were amazing, especially with that background art, but I broke when I saw METTATON’S LEGS 0:25
So this is what I wasn’t supposed to forget? Glad I didn’t.
For a second, I thought this was the FNAF song
I was just watching some dumb video that I didn't need to watch when ad for this song popped up and I just sat and Boogie I love this song
The "dudududududu" was just **chefs kiss**
You should make a song about Roblox Doors! I bet it would be such a banger!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love the refferences
At 0:03 I know that's 8bitryan, but is that IGP next to him? ⁉If so that's a super cool reference to the smaller horror game community.  Also AMAZING SONG, theese are some of my favorite artists all in ONE!? That's super cool it has that upbeat lofi glitch hop type feel like snail's house and I really love it! (Also I was hunting for a techno memoriam but couldn't find it. Did I miss it?)
among us at 0:03
Idk if you're going to see this but, CG5 I am a pretty long term fan of your music and I'm pretty banged by this song! I love the storytelling and the animations and the music so good! This is going right into my Playlist! Please make more of these beautiful songs, We really appreciate it
Oh the references
Call me empathetic but I didn't understand anything about the story .-.
0:03 among us in the background.
2:26 you should sing “Maybe I’ll forget about it ”
This is a really great song I really love it but animations like these make me sad cause I hope the people who make them aren't sad..
Amazing!!! Also I have an idea. Maybe you could do Kill Jill? (A male version of Kill Bill)
The music is so uplifting but the video. I’m in tears holy moly. Great job!
I saw Tommy
Congrats! This song can easily be relatable and I’m glad you’re reaching out to try new things to make your songs even better. Nice one =))
I can relate so much to these lyrics
Went straight for the heart... Going in my writing playlist. Hands down, my favorite song from CG5 to date.
noice
wow is that walter white
Amazing song! Keep the good work man
Woah, I almost 4GOT about this song.
Watch Ohio it is so funny 🤣 😂
THIS remind me of the day when said to to my crush I had a crush on her PLUS ON VALENTINE'S DAY IS SAID THAT I HADE A CRUSH ON HER anyway nice song man I really fun fact I wanna use the song and dance in front of my crush yeah I have a lot of plans so if you mind if you can make the song downloadable so I can download the song

🎶maybe i'll forget about it🎶
The animation is better than the song and the song is good you know you did a good good
I was ready for february 10th, and i didnt forget about it B)
And almost the end you can see a spray paint that says l+ratio
0:22 I love this part seeing all the little easter eggs of things u made songs about
Blink 5 times if you're okay, CG5
It gives me steven universe vibes for some reason
The amount of old references made me remember my whole childhood
Well thats sad :D
You made me cry :(
Why you gotta hurt me like that
1:25 mtt
CG5, THE LIVING TOMBSTONE AND OR3O?!? Am I dreaming?
I still don't get what this song about.
Honestly, I've never heard a song this good  Good job CG5 and TLT✨
I need to know the lore 😭
Bro now I want a part two, I want to know the ending! You left me hanging, my heartttt!  Lovely song as always
That scene of Walter White was my favourite 😂
Am I the Only one who thinks that the artstyle kinda looks like the owl house artstyle?
This is the perfect collab.
Oh my god... I feel so stupid... WHY DID IT TAKE ME THIS LONG TO REALIZE THAT "4GET" IS SUPPOSED TO BE "Forget"????
Amogus 0:03
not gonna lie hoped for a cool beat drop down in the last sentance from oreo but still good!
My confusion hit a diffrent note block seeing dream smp member in the first slide OuO"
Who noticed the third journal from gravity falls painted on the wall?
AYO CG5 AND OR30 ARE MY FAV MUSIC MUSIC PRODUCERS.🔥dam that's sick they did a calab🔥
Honestly loosing my grandfather and previous depression before that, this just helps so much, goes to somewhere it hurts, to badass I say.  I can't believe this is trending.  Please never give up, I want to make sure I always hear your amazing voice.  I love you CG5, your awesome and I hope to be like you.  Can't wait for the next one. Do me a favor will you? Have a good day when you read this k? Also my grandfather says hi, I know it's wierd but he visits me in my dream sometimes, and after I watched this he somehow visited me again and he told me to tell you hello. So there I've done my task.  Proud of you mate.  See you later :)
OMG I LOVE IT 🤩🤩
Try making a song that starts normal but slowly devolves into just lung ruining screaming
1:23 AUTISM !!!!
i showed my grandma this and she almost cried lol i love it keep up the amazing work
Let me be the replay button at 1:21 (But srsly tho. the whole song is FIRE❤‍🔥and the story is good too!)
This is a super beautiful video. It hits hard on how anxiety and depression affects Flint and the emotion and expressions show it. The animation and music is so well made too, and I love it all!
Literally the crossover of the century.
This is amazing I love the amazing art you guys put into it this also reminds me to keep going no matter what life will bring you keep up the amazing work
Good song
WALTER
SO MANY REFRENCES OMG HELP I KEEP NOTICING MORE UGHHHHHHHHHH GREAT SONG BTW
I have this habit of listening to lyrics the first time i hear a song and hard hitting it was I'm in love with this song but i relate too is anxiety is horrible
*DON'T LET THE LIGHT FADE AWAY!!!* 😓😓😓😓😓😫😫😫😫😫😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔
SO GOOD, GOLDEN, HEART-RENDING, HARD-DRIVING AND HAUNTING! 😁😁😁😁😁😎😎😎😎😎😍😍😍😍😍😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😳😳😳😳😳😱😱😱😱😱😵😵😵😵😵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎹🎹🎹🎹🎹🎙🎙🎙🎙🎙🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🏄🏄🏄🏄🏄🌇🌇🌇🌇🌇🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro, Hollow Knight has been out for like 6 years, where's the song?
A CG5 song,with The Living Tombstone featuring OR30?Yeah just what I needed,the trio making a song together 👌
I like how there's a lot of Easter eggs in the video because I screenshot alot of the Easter eggs I could find lol  (Ps CG5 is it fine if I made this into a video)
0:53 I need to learn how to do thd Dadadadadada😅  EDIT: without the timestamp, I look like a psychopath🤣💀
You can't just make me cry out of nowhere like that... damn. Fantastic song, fantastic video
Bop!
God damn that’s awesome!!!!!
reminds me of basil
I feel like I've heard that "dada da da da da" before but Idk where
Yooo this is such a Bop!!!
Its hard to say how much i relate to this song. You are so talented! YOU GUYS DID SO GOOD ON THIS SONG!!! I can't tell you put time into your song with an animation so wild! This song has so much emotion behind a guy who gets visited by an orb of pure happiness.  This song is so relatable cause I've had many fake friends that once brought me happiness, dispersed and just didn't come back but i have a friend named Oak and i see them as the orb in this song bringing the man happiness and joy. But soon they leave you but the happiness and time you spent with them wont go. Thanks for making such a banger yet emotional song. Believe it or not, your my favorite artist! Keep up the great work! We love you CG5!! <33
that went from 0 to 100 in like a minute
This is amazing!!!! Keep up the good work :D
Waltuh

When this came out I put this in my playlist💖 good song btw👏 I've been watching for like 4 years now👍
i just notice there are easter eggs on cg5's other songs!
This video is AMAZING!!!!! One of the cool touches is at 1:08 where when the orb tries to make CG5 happy and his hair changes slightly brown, showing his depression and how he has changed ever since from the begining of the song.
I don't know why nobody is talking about Mr white   JeSsIe JeSsiE wE hAve deMentiA
it is strange that in the comments for these days there is still no person who would leave timecodes with all the references and easter eggs
You can see his hair turn gray from stress
Anyone else notice jellybean and among us at 0:03
Walter NO
What's the lore
I found jellybean!
YOO THIS IS SICK
When on the back of the box (in the rewind) it said The Living Tombstone OR3O and 4GET I thought that 4GET was a musician i had never heard of
Bro living tombstone and CG5 are like the greatest music crossovers ever.
This song is amazing and by 3 of my favourite artists!!!
Bro almost isekai'd
Anyone remember "Take back The Night"?
The work you put in the videos are so damn amazing keep it up your so damn good you best at songs the animation ahh ii just cant say no to wantimg to listen
The animation and the references to past songs and just everything is so amazing! The fact that you made it so relatable as well is crazy!!! I love this so much and i wanted to say how much I actually appreciate this and how much you appreciate your fans. Tysm for this song cg5!
i'm teared up now. this was amazing i love all the memorabilia in the art of gravity falls and techno and others that i didn't quite recognize. but that was beautiful.
Love all the references! Mettaton was a neat surprise lol
0:04 AMOGUS?
Make one with no vocals because you do that with a ton of your songs
So many references. I must find every last one or I’ll die
I love the fact that I can call out the people in the background.
waltuh
Thank you for making this and sharing your battles I never thought I could hear something that would hit so close to home. Hope your feeling ok 💚
Who else saw tommy innit
Look i was listening to you a very long time so thank you for being my childhood😁
I love the use of emotions in this and the animation just in general. My favorite scene is the car scene where the little orb guy gets hit and risks its life. LOVE THE SONG AS WELL really good job. I was kinda expecting TLM to sing but that's ok. Still a banger song tho. Also love how smooth it is as well :)
''Maybe I'll 4get about it''
Congrats for making something with OR3O!
Damn this actually made me tear up :')
It happend.... TL x CG5
This is the best thing ever.
Okay call me crazy bit I felt a strange sensation when he phazed through him
is that SOMETHING behind TommyInnit??? if so, very nice Omori reference! and also very nice song and animation overall!
great song looks like helluvaboss anamation style tho
0:26 yo gravityfallsbook
Love all the easter eggs hidden in the video, from markiplier and bill cipher graffiti to minecraft pig grafitti, amazing video!
im trying to 4get about this song
2:20  Idk why but seeing something look like a sunrise after a sad moment happened when it's night but that "sumrise" shows a moon instead is amazing  To me if you use an actual sunrise after it being dark that means you moved on from the moment but using the moon to brighten up the night it means you came to terms and accepted the dark world around you  But I ain't a language arts teacher so I'm probably just grasping at straws here looking for symbolism that probably isn't there
Love the song but it really sad 😢
JESSE OPEN UP, OPEN THE DOOR JESSE!
I can see a gravity falls fan
Gaw damn
A lil disappointing
*_0:57_**_ breaking sad_*
I had to laugh at Walter White
ok, look, hear me out, the main character tho
the start of the song is also foreshadowing to parts of the end like the first few beats
At 1:55, there's a tribute to techno
0:58 he’s watching breaking bad
what an amezing song! but in missing backstory of the main hcarecter.... but that dosent ruins the song! my congrats!
Can you make a chainsaw man song please
Cg5
I can describe this song in three words. This Is Incredible.
this video is so FREAKING GOOD
So many references! :D
oh my god what a beautiful song 🎤🎶🎶
This Kahoolt isn’t it ?
This was the first chance I could get and man it slaps. It hit the feels but it's nice! Keep up the good work and never be afraid to take as much time as you need!
1:13 just noticed, when the orb goes through his heart, his hair slightly glows brown like it used to be.
awesome and always!
Nice.
The beat is so unique and fun!! I already LOVE this song, now decided to listen to it through this video, awesome work as always! Waited long enough, but it was in fact a very deserving wait. As always, stay awesome Charlie! ^-^
This is one of my fav songs I have listened to recently. I now have it on loop. and the amount of references to different things like, Kirby, and Bill Cypher. there is even one for dream and Luigi I think. this is an amazing project. I hope that something amazing like this will continue to be posted. thank you for the amazing experience
I'm cry 2:08.
y el video esta increible
this song is my favoryte song i love this song 😁
This song hits hard! I'm 100% adding it to my playlist <3 am I not mistaken but all the people in the background were Youtubers?. I first noticed when I saw 8bit-ryan (I think that was 8bit-ryan at least)
Hmm... What does it mean
what in the name of asgore is mettaton doing there
Write a song about chatgpt but its lyrics are generated by chatgpt. It will be fun to hear🤪
WALTER WHITE
pls gravity falls
Anyone else notice the amount of gravity falls things were on the walls? Like bill and journal 3.
sad
The instrumental: 🥰♥️  The actual song and video: 💀
1:00
W song just because of walter white
I wana be like you
It was realy great
0:03  AMONGUS AMONGUS AMONGUS
Why it's hair turned gray? It was brown before.
Just realized that the grafitti at 0:22 is a reference to CG5'S Other songs. The chickens there being "Why did the chicken cross the road?", Dream being "I see a Dreamer", and Luigi with his Poltergust being "Phantom Dancing".
I freaking LOVE this song and I think I saw a few YouTubers in the beginning too! (Only the ones I know ofc) 0:01 Tommyinit, Karl and BadBoyHalo 0:03 Jelly Bean 0:05 Markerplier 0:07 Scar?  This was a beautiful song. It follows a guy named Flint and an orb of happiness. But as time passed, he became very depressed and kept to himself more. The orb was trying to help him but he just lashes out at it. In the end, the orb disappears but he got happy cuz of the last moments with it. It's very shocking to see how many people relate to Flint.
Gotta love the song but you make me feel so much of nostalgia now i dont like it >:(
OMG I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING CG5 hasn't made a song about gravity falls yet There was so many gravity falls references within the graffiti and stuff DOES THIS MEAN HES MAKING A GRAVITY FALLS SONG?!? :DD
is nobody gonna talk about walter white falling down
Yeah the music is awesome but, ITS HEISENBIRG
Cool, cool... IT'S AMAZING
WALTER
I don't know what I just watched,but I love it
nice song I'm addicted to the story but why is there a random among us character in the alleyway at the start
Woah. Just mindlessly scrolling social media and this hit like a brick.   This song and especially the video hits so hard! You just try to push it down and feel the moment but eventually you become grey and lose the light you thought you had.   I got hit by a car in the same way a few months ago because I was depressed and didn’t care when I ran out into the street. My family being concerned after the fact showed me it was not kind of me to disregard my life. I learned that it belongs to them just as much as it does to me. Hopefully one day I will be able to see the light and smile but for now I’m grateful for the resolve to keep “Living On”.   TL;DR   Thank you for making a song and video that so closely resembles my own personal story and that makes me feel seen and understood when I thought nobody else did.
Is it just me or I am the only one who cried because of the animation?
Sounds kinda like green hills
Did anyone notice gravity fall journal and bill ciper
wow
I like how this music video has alot of easter eggs
This Collab is soooooooooooooooo good
when the guy was sttrugling , his hair was brown , and after he decided to 4get about it , his hair turned gray. and when he rellized the ball thingy was very precious to him , his hair turned blue
The sphere was depression… hm
0:15-2:11 hm I think that’s a record
in the end of the SUPER long textrant he saying that there will be more songs with flint.  and what the next songs name? 5GET?????                sry for the bad joke
So. I haven’t seen anybody point out all the YouTubers featured in this. Which makes me kinda sad
Do I see bad and Tommy?
Already knew this was going to be good
i feel like i'm dying too:)
Lololowka?
why can i relate to this song
Bill!
P-p-papa? Is that you?
0:22 FNAF SB Sonic Amongs Minecraft  0:26 undertale MTT and frisk
I just now realized I have a similar singing voice to you
no idea what the story behind the song is, but fire nonetheless
Both of my child hoods are here
0:19 Why does the background music has a kahoot vibe
Holy hell, the animation on this thing is insane! The song is extremely good as well so it just makes for a perfect thing to listen to!
10/10  Great job bro fr
:)
This song hits so hard in every way. Thanks
I needed this song to exist and for my favorite youtubers to create it dang thanks!
The animator did such a fantastic job! And of course I don't need to say how good the music is.
That song are really good!! I love it 🤌🏻💫🎧🌌🌌🌌
Börger
Did someone noted the Duolingo bird shadow that's down the right chicken?
Lore?
0:04 NOT THE AMONG US
Dawg the auto tone is heavy carrying or30 part
yooooo i love al the refrences like the huminised clicker characters (an animation on yt) and amori aswell as the wall of your songs and the gravity falls and all the content creators undertale gention i thing garfield and taco cat breaking bad the yippeeeee meme minecraft grass block and i think thts most of them ( edit am i madder than a hatter is a refrence to either alice in wonderland or the hat kid from a hat in time i think)
This is so much oreo's kind of stories
This is perfect!!!! amazing, so much reference of cartoons, games, series and singers! I don't know if I could find them all, but I found the easiest ones to see, I loved the music and the animation. I loved that even the little moon after seeing what happened there, still went to help the friend, that's friendship. ❤️ I can't describe how much I loved this anymore!
Man… breaking bad changed this man
noooo sprugy dead :(
It is sad that I can relate to this
Nooo! I am actually on the verge of tears for some reason 🥲
hell yheah
I love all the references and the song really bops
En el minuto 0:41 se puede apreciar un isterecs de bills el antagonista de gravity falls
0:57 Walter white!!??!?!⒈
do a Baller Song!!
Okay okay I didn't get this song right away to be honest. I thought it was okay. But the more I listened the more I heard the details and now I LOVE IT SO MUCH!! Such fun
This is why you're my favorite song creator all the little details and all the lake Easter eggs and all that fun stuff and that you showed all the old songs you made them the first part
Bro Walter white tho
I WAS IN THE CHAT REPLAY BUT I WAS 2 SECONDS LATE :((((
What is the name of the Pro Range you use for your music?
Dude this be epic
The song is incredible and catchy and I'm obsessed with the animation, cant stop looking at it!
For CG5:  have you been thinking to do a doors song?
ya sick
I prefer your old videos
Everyone did Great! I love the animation it’s adorable hope we get to see more of this in the future
WALTUH
who let bro cook
If you look at the graffiti in the background there's so many characters and stuff, so much detail!
Amazing work like always
Thank you for this masterpiece of a video \ song
The references in the graffiti lol
It was very short and im still crying... Im going to get depression with this, dude
I can't stop listening to your songs
Walter
This is so nostalgic
References I noticed at the beginning of the song. Literally straight at the start Dream SMP and the lightbulb and Something from Omori. No clue why they are there maybe it relates to CG5's fear/anxiety mentioned in the backstory behind this song. As the opening progresses and announces the teams which helped create this, it shows a multitude of YouTubers including CG5 and OR3O and Spyro the dragon randomly. Where Flint is graffitiing on the wall are multiple references to Games and Media which CG5 has made songs of. In the background you get to see Kirby and one of the villains from the franchise (can't remember who) mettaton, the third journal and Bill Cipher from Gravity Falls. And Garfield randomly. And I think thats all the ones I recognize.    I just wanna say one last thing. Thank you for everything you have done for us CG5. I know the community has been tough on you aside from the anxiety and overthinking you have had to deal with. You are an amazing YouTuber and I just hope you have the best of luck in the future of your life and always remember to take care of yourself above everything. This is NaveKnights here and once again thank you for absolutely everything CG5. You are an absolute Gigachad of a dude. 😎
I wish I had that orb...
ah yes, the wombo combo of youtube music creators
i didnt get the song at first, then i had experienced what it presented and regretting not listening to it deeply earlier because it couldve saved the friendship i had
I SAW AMONG US!
0:01 OMFG IS THAT SOMETHING FROM OMORI IN THE BACKGROUND
that hit my heart a bit to hard
Is the orb supposed to be drugs?
0:54 dlldlddldlLalalalaldldldl
A bop and a relatable song... made by the childhood maker..... omg.....
It’s so sad D:
WALTUH
This is officially my best  song 🎵
Oh my God this was the best song I ever heard
cg5 makes such good quality music with equally amazing lyrics. one of my hobbies is annotating lyrics and my favorite artist to annotate is cg5 because the lyrics are so easy and challenging to figure out at the same time. so many hidden meanings its almost like lore lmao. this is one of new favorite songs mostly for that reason
Don't forget about hearing at the song on Spotify and in Apple Music, also leave a like on this amazing masterpiece
i 4gor💀💀💀💀
so many awesome references+awesome animation
now am sad D:
Don't know if that was intentional, but after a good cry you do feel a bit better.
This just reminded me of drug use. I don’t know why probably it’s because of how he was possibly tripping
Great video, and it is genuinely what im going through, idk if ill be better soon but it is my journey to see . Wish me luck
Can we also appreciate all the references to all the games and shows in the background and the amount of YouTubers in the background
Mark just casually sipping his drink
bro... i feel lore/story hidden in here. Other than that this is actually a really well put together song, and the animation quality is amazing, thank you
HOLY MOLY THIS IS EPIC
i love this song, because of all of the different references to the different games and shows and universes in it, and how relatable of a character flint is. this video is amazing because of how it ends on a not happy note, but not a negative one, and how it really visualizes the world of someone with chronic anxiety
there are so many different references in here, i love it
Omg Please make more original songs man this such a banger!!
The living tombstone helped in this. Five nights at Freddy’s is this where you want to be
10/10 rating 😁😁
I love the meaning of this song it’s so amazing! Keep on going
And damn it was hype
The first song of yours I heard was phantom dancing
I want a CG5 album like this
This song(the song itself, not tje lyrics) reminds me of the desperation to be understood felt by neurodivergent people like me. The feeling of reaching out but not getting a response. And the masking and dismissing of thus feeling because no-one tells us it isn't normal
Waiting for the C-418 collab
Here's The Lyrics If You Want Them Here In The Comment Section.    [CG5]  Moving On, Moving On, It Doesn't Really Matter, My Brain Follows A Pattern. Forget About It  Breaking Up, Breaking Down, You Think It'll Get Better, But It Never Does.  I Feel Like I'm Dying, Nobody Tells Me I'm Lying, Couldn't Hear When I Was Crying. It's Defeating When I'm Trying To Forget About It.  All The Silence Get Louder And Louder And Louder... Maybe I'll Forget About It.  🎵 Ta-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da 🎵  [OR3O]  I'm Spending Every Day, Wishing I Was Okay. Surrendered To A World Of Grey. Hey.  My Car Is Broken Down, I Can't Get Out Of Town. So I'll Walk Along The Road Of Shame.  [CG5] Headache!  [OR3O]  All My Thoughts Are Getting Scattered Am I Madder Than A Hatter Climbing Up An Endless Ladder To Forget About It.  All The Silence Getting Louder And Louder And Louder... (maybe I'll Forget about it)  [CG5] Maybe I'll Forget About It.  🎵  [CG5 & OR3O] Ta-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da Ta-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da (Woah).   You can thank me later if you want.
I LOVE this song❤, but can anyone answer why does his hair turns into grey?
CG5 you outdid yourself this time, I listend to this song everyday since it came out. This song makes me feel something inside bro. Everytime i listen to it, I feel happy :D .  This is awsome  :D
You grabbed my attention after seeing a Bill Cipher spray painted on the wall
breaking bad 💀
This song is so freaking good! And the animation is incredible! Makes me so happy 😊❤
This song gives the meaning of "if you're happy, you listen to the music, but if you're sad, you understand the meaning" a lot.  Edit: It sounds like the Kahoot theme but made more pumped up!
Good song but I don't know what it's about. Is it about forgetting about stuff?
0:02 to all my omori homies out there : there seems to be something
There is a lot of references
Truck-kun to the rescue!
My brain follows a pattern to listen to this song everyday.
Make a game theory song
damn, dark lyrics and upbeat music. Man's going after japan's signature songs/music. /j
I’m about to make a meme but before I do so lemme just say how great this song is, It’s amazing.  Pov: your having a nice day until you dream up an alive person’s funeral

All the references
CG5 I dare you to make a tetris song!
The song perfect. The animation perfect. The whole video Perfect! 👑 You did an amazing job on all of this and I could listen to this 3 or even more times without getting tired of it. Keep up the great work, and of course if you need a break please don’t force yourself to make stuff. Take care of yourself. 👍🏻
0:03 kind a SUS
Why is it like me lmao also I love this song
WOAH I WASNT EXPECTING THAT BREAKING BAD REFERENCE
I have been listening to your music for about 5 years I believe??? And I am so proud of how far you've come! I've loved all of your work and I swear you just keep improving! Even if it's small little funny haha songs, they're still amazing!
ULTIMATE CROSSOVER OMG
Waltuh
gosh imagine this song in geometry dash...
CG5's music has helped me so much whenever im feeling my lowest and i honestly cant thank him enough ever thank you so much for making new music
BRUH BREAKING BAD EKDKFNJE  But seriously, this is a master price
I’m not sure is it’s ok but I’m gonna make a lyric video on this fire if a song
Is it just me or has anyone else realized the fact that the boy that was spray painting in that one scene where it shows it theres easter eggs or hints to all his other songs like sonic or the chicken  [edit] if you dont know what I mean I will make a second edit to what some of the characters hint to other songs
OMG IM SO LATE😭 Just wanted to say I really enjoyed this vid it was worth the wait. I mostly loves the art like in the beginning there's scenes of bad, tommy, karl, and a bunch of other ppl I can't remember RN :(. I haven't even heard of  The Living Tombstone (please don't come at me 😭) But the song is still cool to listen to.
>!?!/
Yo, I just realized. The graffiti there was all a representation of the songs CG5 has made. Look closely at it all there, and you can see it all.
Song hits me hard. Thank you for the song, Charlie. Hope today and everyday after are great.
Wonderful song! Kudos to CG5 and everyone else who worked on it!!
How many people saw the reference to gravity falls
Not something I'd add to the playlist, but still a respectable song, not bad 👍
1:26 METTATON
Waltuh
Who else didn't understand this but still loved the song I sure did
Woow! So good! Playing on loop
What is the show?
So many gravity falls references
The horsemen of video game themed music. The Living Tombstone CG5 OR3O
Yes! I feel like I’ve been waiting forever for this song to come out even though I only heard about it a few days ago! It’s amazing!
Now THIS is the reason Iove Cg5.
i forgor
You better use this setting more cause it looks amazing
Poor walther
I love this song so much :)
cg5's best songs are the ones where the lyrics and the video work together to tell a story
confusion is what i feel the force is not with me
WATLER WHIT!!!11!
Bro did anyone notice jellybean?? It was at 0:03.
is how a tiny sun
Everyone  not gonna talk about Walter wight
It's was. Amazing  I watched it for the second  time now I looked at every detail it's perfect 😃👍
TOO MANY REFERENCES!!!!
Such a great song!! \(^○^)/
Too much hype for such a mediocre song lol
Technoblade ❤ 1:54
is it weird that i relate to both flint and the orb? my relationships have often felt draining near the 3-6 month mark, even if i still love the person- but i’m always the one to let go. i always feel like i can’t make them as happy as i used to, and i just don’t feel the same anymore, so i can see where both characters were coming from
Okay but all the references in this MV??? Lovin’ it.
0:57 Waltuh 4GET about it Waltuh
The animation at 0:48 just tickles my brain in the right way
new song that ain’t ohio
was that tommy at the very beginning scene or just a look alike actually going back through there are a lot of easter eggs well done
No little orb
<3 <3 <3 <3
No one talks about the youtubers in the background
0:57 the emotion in this scene 😢 it makes me tear up
I already know that this is going to be legendary
KamiCon was a BLAST!! I loved seeing you and this song is very good!
THIS IS AMAZINNNGGG! I'm loving the animation, the song is a bop, what else can we ask for?  Also, just a little suggestion: You've made a lotta SMP music which I'm also loving, but I just have one request; a philza song. Some lyrics I came up with: One life wonder Dark wings bring shadow and thunder
0:03 sus
Fun fact:if you watch gravity falls the book and bill cipher in the back round
I was not expecting a song abt depression w/ top tier quality
These colabs get better and better
Pero que gran canción , como para ir en un paseo de auto
Can you please make a song about adhd i have it bad and i have anxiety like this songs backstory keep up the good work
this song is amazing and i love the graffiti art in the background with the little bits of other fandoms
Apart from the music, which is flipping incredible, huge Kudos to the animators and artists! The video is amazing.
okay this song just inpired me to write another book. okay okay working on it, i'll add a doc link when i'm finished  link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Rynzzn8dHMimfNzxfCXp7BqxaH3JLbRYxQEkBWSU_I/edit this is part 1 link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13OQ0Xt7pZZwkZ8jrzFCECv-MIy49M_3NMoEK92bwreo/edit?usp=sharing this is part 2

This is amazing great job cg5 and the team for making this amazing song and animation
Did anyone notice the people in the video? Tommyinnit,ranboo,badboyhalo (i think) 8itryan CG5himself Markiplier
This definitely does relate to me you’re a great artist Charlie. Tbh i hate that feeling but one day we’ll all find that peace of mind
Was gonna click off, got depressed
I can relate to the story, i have been dealing with anxiety and usually, idk what to tell my therapist that could potentially HELP my anxiety.
CG5 thanks a lot for your creativity. You are one of those singers that I associate only in a positive way and always cheer me up with your songs. Regarding the video and its idea, I want to share my experience. I was in apathy for almost a year and a half, but only recently everything began to improve. I was lost, I felt the shame of the past every day, as well as the inability to return to the good old days. Lack of confidence in myself and the future, I constantly asked myself: "What am I living for? What is my goal as a person, and not as an animal?" All this is very familiar to me... Guys, all those who are also among you in the same condition as I have been for these half a year, I want to tell you, in no case do not despair. Life is changeable, it has ups and downs, and that's okay. I realized for myself: "The night is not endless, the sun will always rise above you." Based on this statement, I want to say, no matter how bad you feel, never give up. It will be difficult, but only through tears, suffering, etc., when your personal dawn comes, you will understand that all this was not in vain. Play sports and do what you like. As the saying goes: “Time heals”.  I wish you all only the best and more fun days) With love from RU❤
I’m in this video and I don’t like it
Honestly, this song slaps harder then my dad belt
Amogus 0:03
I love the song bro
I feel this so hard.  It reminds me of my journey with art from my elementary school years to adult hood mainly the start and near the end of this.  First off I have adhd and anxiety. Both of these affected my journey threw this.  Art was my go to way to forget about this world. I drawed my little pony despite people making fun of me of drawing ponies I had a small group that all though left me eventually I drawed small mlp comics that was pretty simple and not a big deal.  Once I got into high-school I took a break from ponies at that time and drawed my oc way more. Her name is rocky, I had for awhile starting out as EnderRocky and evolving into something new. With new ocs around her.  But then.. comes in the art teacher there.. all my love towards art came crashing and was destroyed by her. It gets worse when some say she helped them. Because she seemed to had favorites someone I assume she deems talented or acts correctly gets to have breaks, play games, and such even if their behind a project.  As for me I got jumped for playing yugioh when I was done drawing. She demanded I draw instead but i couldn't bring myself to draw without a idea it was already bad enough I had projects from her. She was lucky I try to figure out ways for myself to do that.   Her teaching is the worse I've ever seen in a teacher. We were stuck on shading for half of the semester and because of it I hate pencil shading now. If you saw my projects from then you can tell how badly it was effecting me. All though lost I still remember the first and final one. The first was a sphere and people can see I done it before and was good at it. But the final project it look like I wasn't good at shading some look nice other parts didn't. I was so tired of doing it.  Then all the other projects we only got 1 practice or she make us watch something then stright to the main project. It was horrible. Once I finally graduated I didn't draw for a year and a half that much only once or twice. Combine that with the death of my grandpa I couldn't ever draw.  Eventually I finally grab that art tablet I got from saving spare change months ago from my grandpa and dad paid what was left. I slowly tried to draw and figure out something I may enjoy doing digitally.   I went back, back to ponies. I did lineless with a fur effect and loved it. Eventually I found a brush I liked for lines and used that not only that but I realize this brush can make a effect with my coloring and I though it look real nice. Shading was the hardest part to figure out for me on my art I ended up going with a watercolor brush. Last night before this i went on a drawing spree, I drawed rocky again it came out much better then I ever did in the past. Then I drawed another oc. I end the night with a half finished "draw the squad" meme I was doing for the giggles.   I love the way I do things now, I don't care if it takes longer then normal for most people I love how the art turns out. This video makes me feel like I'm on that journey again for a moment, specially with the character being a artiest at first but lost it.
Just heard the instrumental. It’s such a bop
not only is the song amazing, the animation is aswell
Youtuber LORE?!?!?!?
What the hell, this was so touching and I don't even know any of these characters. You guys are awesome! I've been listening to CG5 for a while. But you all knocked this one outta the park.
The little details and the animation. Lyrics and story is perfect CG and the others did amazing
perfect for alarm clock to me and a little bit Easter too see how the pink mustache T-shirt I know about it
Is everyone depressed?
You are so good. 💕💞💝🌹😙💯🎉 100%

TOO. MANY. POP CULTURE REFERENCES.GONNA.EXPLODE.SYSTEM FAILURE.AHHAHAHHAHAHAHAH
Lees goooooo
I LOVE YOU AND YOUR SONGS
They really stuffed this video full of references LMAO
On god this might be my new number one favorite song
For example Freddy the chicks etc
The spray paint at the beginning is a a art of all the songs you made
cool how this music video shows a short story song is great and the story is amazingly well done
The video alone speaks enough words to hit where it hurts.. But both combined with the music it's just a perfect masterpiece. You did it again CG5 and TLT, proud of you guys!
Nice song bro really good
The story’s a tad confusing but honestly I can accept that because the animation is really charming and the song itself is a funky bop! Great work, all of you!
CG5 just collaborated with 2 of the best people he could’ve ever chosen
amazing song though I wish it was longer
Who’s cutting onions in here?
Markiplier and other people in the animation, awesome! Along with cartoon show and video game graffiti art. Most importantly, I love the song! Awesome how three great YouTube's are doing a collab! Especially The Living Tombstone👍
I love this animation so much! You, OR3O and TLT did an amazing job with the vocals, and the art and animation.
Animation: :D Song         :  :'(
is this royalty free? id like to use it as bg music for my channel
his song is such a bop. Thank you OR3O, TLT and CG5 for this masterpiece
So confused...  but it was one heck of a video!
0:06 is that markiplier on the bottom left corner???
nice
CG5 making references to other youtubers in the intro makes me happy!
It's so sad but it's a good song
I keep scrolling down because I wanna find someone that kinda explains what's going on in the video, everybody seems to get the video but I don't  Oh well, someone will explain it eventually
0:03 WAIT IS JELLYBEAN NOW ASSOCIATED WITH CG5????
Wow. This is truly beautiful. I can understand and relate to at least a part of this, enough to make it simultaneously hurt and heal. I constantly overthink, and it can become dangerous. The past is there for a reason, but maybe the reason is simpler than we think. We can never entirely forget, but we can use those past mistakes and hurts to colour our futures brighter than the rainbow. Amazing animation, INCREDIBLE music. I'm glad you were able to share this with us, and I look forward to your bright future!:)💙
What’s the name of the main character
2:19 Gravity Falls! It’s cool you added that in there! Keep up the great work! ☺️👍
Breaking bad
YES ITS HERE THIS IS GOT TO BE THE BEST SONG EVER IT GOT THE BEST ARTIST EVER

Sad
Good one cg5
Praying for you all to find peace and true joy.  God bless.
Bill cypher
00:9  Best details ever on this scene. OR3O throwing a bucket of water on CG5. The colors appeal in red and black with blonde hair, so that must be CG5. OR3O has cat headphones so that's her as well.
You now TLT had to do something with it if song is depressing and about some sort of depresion
This music videos piles all the emotions on me. Love this so much!
Good music
Did anybody notice Bill
1950s be like
I love it
0:03 JELLYBEAN IS ON A POLE
Supergroup. :)
This resonated with me and I started to cry at the end. Fantastic work! 😔😭❤✨
Bro added breaking bad
I had the awesome privilege to hear this song the day it debuted Friday at Kami Con 2023 when CG5, Or3o, and Living Tombstone were there as guests. This song is absolutely amazing, and getting to listen to this beauty of a collab was so wonderful. CG5, you put on one heck of a concert with your friends, and me and my friends there had an absolute blast!! Can't wait to hear the next original piece you create!
I want murder drones song
COLLAB, ANIMATION, EVERYTHING IS TOP NOTCH
This is such an amazing song and the video really fits the song and the animation is really good as well. I love everything about this so much. Truly amazing CG5. ❤

This is a certified William Wisp moment
This is FİYER🔥🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Your life seems painless when there joy in your life then it feels like too much pain when the joy dies
0:18 is my favorite part because it shows all the songs hes made and journal 3 from Gravity Falls
This the real story about the story: (btw you should read the full document about this, is in the description!)  The story follows the protagonist, Flint, who is passionate about creating art with graffiti, and is very good at what he does. He comes across a box in an alleyway with an adorable living orb creature. It is a very happy creature, and its special power is bringing its happiness to anyone that encounters it. The little orb physically passes through Flint’s heart, and he is brought an extreme amount of power, providing a new feeling of euphoria he’s never experienced before. He drops everything he is doing to spend all his time with the orb, so that he can receive more of its power.   Eventually, even after all these positive feelings, Flint finds himself in an extremely depressive state, to the point where no matter what the magnitude of the orb’s power, Flint cannot receive the same happiness that he was in the beginning. He is exhausted, and eventually gets very angry for no reason, putting himself in immediate danger.   On top of that, the orb’s power starts to weaken, because it cannot bring its keeper any more joy. But it tries its best to pick Flint up. It gives him his paint spray can, of which he can create graffiti with, but he cannot bring himself to do it at all. Flint has lost his love for his craft, because of all the time he spent receiving power from the orb. He is almost entirely decrepit, and he knows why. And so does the orb. So the orb disappears, and Flint is forced to let go. But in the end, his contentment, his passion, it all comes back to him, and he is once again free.
ITS AWESOME
OH MY GOSH I SAW SPYRO HOLY CRUD SOMEONE ELSE OTHER THAN MY SISTER AND I KNOW IT EXISTS. THANK YOUUUU
i LOVE looking for little easter eggs
So no one is talking about Walter white
YOOOOOOOO
Ayo this straight fire wth!!!! You never cease to amaze me! Kudos to everyone involved!!!🔥🔥🔥
best CG5 song for sure
I literally cannot stop listening to this song. Such amazing animation and songwriting, truly a masterpiece. Great job!
I think I saw him make this in a stream, I have been waiting for it and it’s awesome 🎉
0:03 among us
Now now, if I've learned anything about things relating to gravity falls, they usually aren't put there by mistake, what did Hirsch put you up to?
i damn near cried
Btw so cool
1:23 yippee
Walter White
Why u are so good at this?
wow I like this song and so many references/ester eggs
The amount of references in the wall art tho!
soo good
I felt so sad the little orb died at the end, I love the song and animation and how much effort it seemed to have took, and I’m glad Flint lets go at the end, even if it was hard
I genuinely relate to this HELL of a banger CG5, OR3O, and The Living Tombstone made, for I have some type of anxiety (like Flint). In life lies multiple barriers to break, thin or thick. Sometimes these barriers can feel like generations to break through off, "[surrounding people] in a world of gray/grey" (1:08 - OR3O). Motivation can die out, "silence can grow louder", meanwhile vibrant colors ranging from life can fade, as if people can't feel the need to push through, causing life to be dull and helpless. It's crazy how anxiety can do many harmful things that can hurt humanity NOT just physically, but also mentally. Anxiety can push you from others, bury away your emotions, lose motivation in what you love to do, focus on one thing more than the other, worry about what the future can hold, AND hundreds, thousands, or even BILLIONS of other twisted things. For instance, right now I am struggling to pursue my motivation to do things I adore doing (these interests make me who I REALLY am in my identity). I have lost motivation ever since 2021/2022, and it's been a year since I've genuinely made some content on my main channel because I push myself to do more school than animating. As I do more school, anxiety grew around the corner. I am frightened if I won't ever gain motivation to animate, and more things again on my channel; because I DREAM to be a YouTube Star, and an inspiration to many. I know I have pretty decent animation skills, but I just don't know what content to make, and I fear I may fail in school. For I am currently a thirteen year old, apprehensive about what the future holds. It's just like every step I make, more school work piles in, and I barely get any breaks in it. Weekends feel short, weekdays feel long, my barrier just has a scratch. I just don't know what to do. However, in my soul, lies a little bit of determination and light. Everytime I'm at my lowest times, I suddenly just feel a shine of hope. Oh, and everytime I feel hope, trust me-- it's such motivational feeling. Although my "thoughts are feeling scattered" , I just remember my inspirations, and loved ones who can help me break my barrier of anxiety. And to those who have anxiety, you can break it too. I believe everyone who has anxiety can too break the thickest barrier they have one day. Yes, there may be hardships; but just remember there are multiple individuals who can help you continue on, inspirations OR loved ones.   Life is not made to be wasted because of anxiety, Life is used to become want you dream to be, to cherish moments with those who you love, to spend. 💙  BUT, getting that out of the way, this is a catchy melody! 10/10, and bravo!  Good Job CG5, OR3O, and The Living Tombstone! I can't believe 4get is 17# trending !! (^_^) 🎵
0:05 Love how mark is just chillin
You seriously added Walter White 🤣 This song is really good!
I love this even the easter eggs like the journal 3 from gravity falls and etc

Anyone gonna talk about the SOMETHING behind tommy in the first 2 seconds of the video?
0:03 is that an.......AMOGUS in the background!?!  (Its in the very back of the picture. You may need to zoom in a bit-)
Man, CG5 was and still has been my most played artists on Spotify, CG5 always makes an absolute banger! He takes his time when making songs, and just cares about how it sounds for everyone to love it, keep it up!
You made me feel … I understood it and I hope you could know how much you all have helped me … I wish I could be like y’all
:)
Saw all the names attached to this one and had to check it out.
LYRICS:  Moving on, moving on, It doesn’t really matter, My brain follows a pattern. Forget about it. Breaking up, breaking down, You think it’ll get better, but it never does.  I feel like I’m dying. Nobody tells me I’m lying. Couldn’t hear when I was crying. It’s defeating when I’m trying To forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.  I’m spending every day, Wishing I was okay. Surrendered to a world of gray. Hey. My car is broken down, I can’t get out of town. So I’ll walk along a road of shame. Headache!  All my thoughts are getting scattered. Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.
once again a musical masterpiece
This video expreses how ive felt in the last timespand of a year, thank you Cg5 and the rest of your team for making this video <3
Nice music CG5!
*CG5:* Don't forget about it. Don't forget about it. Don't forget about it. Don't forget about it. Don't forget about it.  *The song's title:* Forget 😃🎵🎶

I love this song!
Me thinking this is a fnaf song: 💥💥
The techno graffiti is something i will never get over… ty CG5! :,)

3 Talented People Worked On This. 3 Talented People!
Is no one talking about how the graffiti mural at the beginning of the song is like a who's who of the best CG5 songs.  I See a Dreamer, Superstar, Run, Why did the Chicken Cross the Road, Phoenix of the Sea, All three among us songs, And many more I only vaguely recognize.
Love the fact that the painting at the beginning shows Charlie's songs like I see a Dreamer and RUN
You made me sob :( This is so beautiful and touching
I remember seeing an announcement on TLT’s YouTube, and I immediately knew it would be great. I think my prediction was right
the amount of gravity falls easter eggs
THE LITTLE GUY :( Edit After Listening 13 Times, IT'S A BOP!
Bro this song is so fire
Is it bad that I feel this song really talks to my autistic side ?? I absolutely love it !!
man reading the context for this song... i'm sorry you and the other person had to go through with that, but i'm glad you both feel better now!!!!!
NOOOOOO I 4GOT ABOUT THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is so good, top 3 cg5 song for me

Totally not crying :))
Walter white
The visuals and music are immaculate, great collaboration 👏
Ho. Ly. Lord.
I've listened to this at least a dozen times and it just clicked that it was about childhood trauma
So are the people in the beginning YouTubers or something because I swear I saw bad boy halo, jerma, and technoblade, but for the last 2 it could just be generic people because idk the one I think looks like technoblade also sometimes makes me think of other YouTubers
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1:54 Was on the right-hand side... was that a techno reference.
CG5 When you hit 5M change your channel name to CG5M for a bit
Yo is that 8-bitryan
Brilliant Music! Nice Animation  Great work guys

THANK YOU FOR ADDING GRAVITY FALLS REFRENSES

Surprisingly, I was able to remember streamers in the video. I think this video will be remembered as the best gift and masterpiece.
I didn’t notice that the 🐷🗡👑 in the wall…. 1:56
You know when I first listen to the song I didn’t really care for it and then after listening to it a second time it started getting stuck in my head and I liked it more and more great song CG5
very unique and fun song with a deep meaning behind it... 10/10
make a song about mrbeast please
Song is amazing and the animation is superb.
0:00  1:04 / 1:05 1:20 / 1:21
This would be even better if this was released on April since April is the 4th month of the year.
so much references
So this was where Void Soul went when he was purified by Kirby…  Maybe he’ll be isekai’d once again by truck-kun to another world.
Another amazing collab😭I love you so much
This is a great song and animation. Love it. Thankyou cg5, the living tombstone, and or30, and everyone who participated on this one. Love it

You deserve it   Updating because I haven't been sure how to say this I could see so much in this song even before reading the actual story, healing is a long process, and I'm both proud of you for working as hard as you do, and I want to thank you, because I know how much really goes into this stuff, and it meant a lot to me, I've been obsessed with this music video and song for the past 2 days since it came out.  Good job
Good job I saw it on one of your shorts but I didn't  think it was going to be in this oof
lol
Np!
this video somehow made less sense then if I took lsd then ate 42 slices of lasagna and dressed as garfiend then glued feathers to myself covered the suit in grease and ran from the FBI still pretty cool tho
Not me crying over a little yellow ball
No one saw bill cipher in the background of 0:43?
You know there’s like a lot of YouTubers in the background
#17 on trending literally made my day I'm so glad cg5 is getting this attention for his great music❤🙏🔥

Cool song 👍💖💖💖💖💖
GRAVITY FALLS REFERENCE YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Words can't describe how incredible this song is amazing job. 👍
Dude, I watched you make part of this song on stream about a year ago and I was wondering when it was going to come out! I thought it was scrapped but thankfully it wasn't! I haven't really been in a serious relationship, but I do understand the anxiety and depression part of it. (I think everyone does, to some extent) Thank you for releasing this song, and as always, awesome work, Charlie!
Anyone else hear kahoot song or no?
Funny omor secret
The music: Poppy and energetic  The video: *depression*
I keep going back and looking at all the memes in here that were hidden and I thought it was so cool. This song is so awesome and I love it so much! Congrats on #17 trending! ALSO the thing where it said “no one is alone” was that a techno blade reference? 💓
This one's going on the comfort playlist
OR30's vocals were great in this song and always bring a good feeling to our ears and of course, cg5's to.
This is amazing

I was waiting for this song without having a single idea of what it would be about, at the moment i listened to it and understood the lyrics and its context, it got into my heart.

Walter
Man a music video really cant take no reffrencess in the first 1 min look 00:13
I love it how he had Walter white during the memes that got me dying😂😂
Everyone is talking about how amazing the song is (Which I agree), but no one is talking about the Breaking Bad scene.
I love how good the vibe is CG5 makes great songs I'm a huge fan
how many views this got in a day
. _.
It's AWESOME!! I LOVE THIS ANIMATION, I LOVE THIS SONG AND I LOVE THIS LYRICS!!! YOU ALL ARE NICE!! GOOD WORK!! <3
lyrics is so releatable
This is amazing!
STUNNING!!
I love the meaning behind this wonderful song! Amazing work CG5, OR3O, and The Living Tombstone!
cg5 makes great content but i wuld wish he didn't addd kahoot song in the end and made it more original
Perfect music CG5
I love this and this song and this song is so relatable it’s like the song understands me.. asides from the dying flame well it’s kinda like happiness is dying which that relates also and it’s true bc I just try to ignore it not think of it but it builds up on the inside definitely my new favorite song
That animation though Edit: I am now trying to find every single reference I can in this video, here's a list in order: In the train tracks scene, several DSMP Youtubers can be recognized (I only recognized Tubbo, Tommy, Bad, and Sapnap lol) Next scene, imposter in the background, several other people I don't recognize, Spyro graffiti, Drista I think? Next scene, Markiplier in the bottom left corner Scene after the next scene, CG5 getting doused (presumably by OR3O), more people I don't recognize Scene after the next scene, Garfield with some lasagna, Bill Cipher, other graffiti in the corner Next scene, American flag w/ eagle graffiti Scene with the bridge in the background, biblically correct angel on the wall and Kirby HUGE graffiti, Walugi, Glamrock Freddy, Lancer, Sonic, Among Us, chickens, Minecraft axolotls, Parappa, maybe the Captain's Call ship?  2/3: We also find out our protagonist's name is Flint 2: Of course, WALTUH Next bit, Mettaton + Frisk, Gravity Falls Scene with happy ball guy, Hatsune Miku, Binding of Issac Running sequence, grass block on the wall L + Ratio on the wall when graffiti artist puts down ball guy Turns around, Technoblade's coat/sword with pig laying down That's all I could find, reply with more things I didn't get! 2: I TREASURE FLINT WITH MY ENTIRE HEART 3: Read the Google Doc that comes with this for the story 3.5: QUICK, MORE OF FLINT'S STORY! art reference timestamps for myself: 0:32, 0:51, 0:55, 1:10, 1:15, 1:24, 1:26, 1:35,
Late to commenting but honestly this is just beautifully well crafted, the song, the animation being fully done, the little nkds to your other songs, it's just near masterpiece. (Why near) well, there's more to come and I'm sticking around, your one of my favorite artist, and I'll be here till the end m8, oh if you see this CG5, do me a favor, make it a great day.
Well… that was…      Beautiful. Touched me on a very emotional level. Thank you for making this.    Also GRAVITY FALLS REFRENCES LETS GOOOOO

The 2022 rewind was a great hint towards this song!

i love the dream in the box
IT’S JELLYBEAN
0:04 amog us in the back

This is totally a banger song ^-^ I really like the meaning, thanks for still remembering that fandom, and congrats on such another amazing project
Why   Is    This     Song    So     GOOD?!?! Edit: Some parts of this song sound like a soundtrack or sound efects in a video game ngl
1:46 omori referenceeeeeeeeee
walter
rip yellow blob dude
JESSIE! Cg5 and TLT made another collab! 🗿
Is no one gonna talk about Walter white?
This song is probably close to the best song I have ever heard. Great job with the animation and all the hidden details. I spotted Hatsune Miku, Bill Cypher, Garfield, Sonic, etc. This is too many to name.
0:03 IS THAT 8BIT RYAN
I dont understan anything
I hope there's gonna be more songs like this
Wow that's something, I get how The animation is and I see some meaning in there like you know trying to forget about something and I know people get what it is but I know that it's a song and There is something in it that I kinda understood it and I do know that it is and I do like how the video is and Have a good day
Thank you CG5. The story about the meaning of this song relates so closely with mine. I too was in a relationship, but in this case I was the golden orb of happiness. We loved each other, but he became so severely depressed. No matter how hard I tried to help, he only got worse. He would lash out at me, then hurt himself afterwards due to guilt. I loved him and tried to make it work, much like you CG5. But in the end, as excruciating as it was, I left him. I no longer brought him the same joy, and although he clung to me like I was his only happiness, I knew it wouldn't work. That was a few months ago, and I'm no longer depressed. Last I heard, he was getting better, but we don't talk anymore. It just baffles me how relatable your story was, and how that orb reminds me so much of myself.   Sorry for the long rant, but I really want to say thank you, and I'm so proud of you CG5❤️❤️❤️
0:22 Notice how he drew every single person he made a song about is seen on this one frame.  (Even cuphead!)  He's on the bottom right!
so good this is a really nice thing to listen to!
This is just unreal. I LOVE THE SONG, THE ANIMATION, IT'S ALL AMAZING!!!
Can’t stop listening to this ever since it came out thanks for this song CG5
kinda fire
just heard this song now its stuck in my head ! great job CG5!!
I didn't understand the story at all but the music bops so it's okay lol
This was awesome!!!
LOOOOOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEE
Reminds me of metal family with the art style but the ending made me cry
I love that he added YouTubeers to it
Such a sick video! Congrats on such an ambitious project and congrats on a killer song! This trio is such a joy to listen to ♥
this song is depressing still love it :)
man I love this song. thank you Charlie for another great song!

is it just me or does the beat kinda have kahoot vibes
I was here in the live
This song can be interpreted in so many things and that's why it's good, so that many people can take it how they want, plus it's a banger and amazing lyrics same with the visuals
This is so amazing! Song, animation, everything. I am so glad to see your progress sinse i've been watching you from the very first video ✨
Deep dive:  The orb is meant to be Flint’s girlfriend/lover. They gave Flint happiness, but they can’t anymore. Flint feels unhappy and depressed, and gets into an argument with the orb. The hard part is the scene of the orb getting run over. I can’t say for sure, but this means Flint’s lover died or was severely injured by a car hit.
The ultimate collab
the animations is really great and i love those little reference to show and video game
This is the best song I have ever herd in my intire life. You make the best songs ever cg5
4Get can we get a 4Get chain
Forget it I’m definitely adding this to my playlist

bro really let me get the feels 😟😞😞😔😔💀
OMG IS THAT MARKIPLIER AT THE LEFT BOTTOM CORNER AT 0:06 ?? I IMMEDIATELY SPOTTED HIM
the hell was that?! it was so sad I wanna cry
Im never gonna see kahoot the same way again
Is it only me or does this song awfully sound like Push (aka the Duolingo song)?
YOOO LETS GOOO
NAH Not me crying cause of this song
Original Songs are awesome! I'm glad that CG5 made one.
You all have done such great work on this! I love the music and the whole animation. Keep up all the great work you guys do! Thank you.
This song... it doesn't just apply to CG5, The Living Tombstone, and Or3o. This song shows a life lesson that people have began to "4GET" and honestly, if people were to watch the video and listen to this music, it could change the way some people think! The animation is AMAZING, the lyrics itself are PHENOMENAL, and the Instrumental ROCKS. You have come so far in just the 2 years I've been listening to you!!! I remember when "I See A Dreamer" came out, I remember going through all of your old songs! This is really an amazing song, that break you took, I don't know what you did, but OH MY GOD YOU WERE SO RIGHT!!! You are coming back way better and way stronger than before. You have inspired me to begin writing my own songs! You, Dawko, DHeusta, DAGames, TheLivingTombstone, CK9C, MandoPony, TryHardNinja, and NateWantsToBattle just to name a few! Now this makes me excited to be involved in the world of music! Amazing job to EVERYONE INVOLVED, And keep rocking out as much as you do, and don't ever doubt yourselves! You guys are amazing!
You and Pack god need to do a collaboration, I don't know what, but it would be something to go down in history.
couldn't you make it at least a little less sad
The reason I love this song is because it is so relatable. I am actually really sad in life at the moment, but this song makes it feel as if I'm not alone. I can relate to the lyrics a lot and it really does help knowing that there is at least a song knowing what I'm going through. This isn't just a song, it's a connection, and I want it to stay that way.
so many refrences to shows and other songs lol
it's song is now my favorite now cuz the animation, the beats, the song etc. I won't 4get this song
The animation, the story, the characters wait was that zombie e girl in a car?!
maybe ill forget about my jokes    jk
This song is amazing but what I didn't see a lot of people talking about (in the 10 comments I read) are the easter eggs Journal 3 homelander Garfield thew living tombstones symbol in the beginning and Bill (might have to go frame by frame to get all the easter eggs I know) also the animation is amazing
i absolutely am going to listen to this on repeat and put this in my spotify inspiration playlist for sure. good work as always. (side note i also really love your golden hour cover <3 thanks for putting that out there.)   you've helped me get through some stressful hell and all the way back and i just wanted to say that even if you don't see this i just really want you to know that you helped me a ton as of last year. so thank you for everything, i'll never 4get about you <3
0:03 I found amongus in between the two buildings

I love this, the animation is so smooth and tells such a great story, and the music is just AMAZING 👌
Among us

I LOVE THE SONG. I LOVE THE ANIMATION. I LOVE THE STORY. EVERYTHING.
Fun fact. CG5 actually gave the date out for this on tiktok at the beginning of the year.
Who I saw in this: 1. BadBoyHalo 2. Sapnap 3. TommyInnit 4. Dawko (I think) 5. 8-BitRyan 6. JellyBean 7. Markiplier 8. CG5 (ofc) 9. OR3O (ofc) 10. Technoblade maybe? (with hair) 11. Walter White  I don't know some of them. Please reply who else do you see.
Wait... So I was listening to this on loop while playing some video games when suddenly the music stopped and a "Thank you for watching screen appeared" (It was at around 0:40 )is there any reason for that? Also, when I replayed to the beginning of the video it worked again
Dude the little Easter eggs in the background are so cool. I love these new songs Charlie puts out. They freaking rock
Children of the Machine is better
Круто
Damn y’know you’ve found a gold mine artist when the first song you hear from them makes you cry, I’m so excited to go through all of your older music!
Cara, qual o sentido de ter o The Living tombstone na música sendo que ele não canta? só o Cg5 e a Or3o cantaram mano, qual o sentido disso?
0:03 jelly bean
bro the first thing i noticed was the game references on the walls....
.-.
I spy with my little eye Tommyinnit and Badboyhalo at 0:01
I didn't expect to get attached to a floating orb of light but here we are   Also love the references to other shows like Breaking Bad and Gravity Falls
This guy needs a movie
Stop this almost made me cry 😭
Love all the references to gravity falls in the backround
I LOVE this song,  I can't believe it's been in the works for so long! How have yall managed to be so quiet abt this banger for a whole YEAR!!   Flint is an amazing character, I love how their graffiti reflects various fandoms all three artists have participated in/written songs for.   The energy from this song really just resonates with me right now, I've been thinking about that teaser SO MUCH for the past couple days and the song n animation delivers completely on everything I hoped for.   Much love to charlie, Or3o and TLT!    Many hugs for the thought and emotion behind the song 🫂  Sidenote, maybe I'll make some fanart for flint and their graffiti because damn they r so cool
3p in one song
The amount of references that this video has is insane
I spent too much time looking for every reference....
I love this! It's amazing, can't wait for more :]
FEBRUARY 11TH DON'T FORGET ABOUT IT
If i have nice content idea i can be YouTuber but i can't thing
I can relate to this song an uncomfortable amount. Also the animation is breathtaking, the lyrics are amazing, the vocals are beautiful, the story being told is incredible and this is definitely my new favourite song!  I also love all the references in the background. Perfection!
Was incredible hyped once heard that you and The Living Tombstone are collaborating on a track!!!!! The animation, production and love everyone put into this is truly astonishing;; Thank you for this BANGER of a song ♥

To be honest, I didn’t know what I was expecting from this, but I definitely was not expecting to be blown away by a movie quality masterpiece that is this! This is insane dedication and the story is amazing! Gg CG5, once again, you did not disappoint.
Bangers dude bangers
Furry lore
Man, everything about this is amazing! The animation is so well done and the song absolutely slaps! Congrats to you all who made this, you are awesome!
Bangers man bangers

you always seem to amaze me with your type of music! goodjob CG5 and OR3O and The Living Tombstone!
The song was good, the animation was good, and I rate it 100/10
me when cg5 uploads:  :O its an awesome music video:😮 ITS WITH THE LIVING TOMBSTONE (MY CHILDHOOD MUSIC ARTIST): 😲😳🔥
0:22 All of those painting are references arent they
So many references
The Gravity falls references fill my heart with Joy.
WOWWWW  COOL SONG... ALSO THE ANIMATION WAS FASCINATING ❤❤❤
Ok why am I crying
im in the vibe zone
Mhhh, i see some Easter eggs from gravity falls!
woahhhhh
Animation suitable for rock metal
THE END WAS SO SAD
Charlie truly came back from his 2 month break a changed person! His songs are getting better and better! Keep it up 🔥
The easter eggs in the animation is huge
DUDE I AM GONNA CRY
Am i supposed to be happy or sad now??
Breaking bad moment :)
I didn’t know what this song would be about back during the teaser, but I knew it would be amazing. This wasn’t amazing it’s MAGICAL! From the beautiful animation to the upbeat tune…  And we can’t forget about what it all kinda means.   Growing up and just kinda floating alone in life. The mental blockers dragging you into “a world of gray.” Turning to the little, comforting, childish light found in unexpected places. Seeing that light everywhere you went and in all the things you do. Eventually losing the mental war to grow up/give into the darkness. To just 4get about it and to push away that childish light, which proves to lead to possible danger. Trying to save what you wanted to forget, while the light begins to dim. That hopeless feeling of loss until discovering that what you loss isn’t fully gone, perhaps just hidden or rearranged to look a tiny bit different.  All in all, it’s something many of us can relate to. That light for me was the world of fiction. The characters, fandoms, and songs were the things to keep me going when no one else would.   Also I love all the references to previous songs, memes, and fandoms. Gravity Falls actually got me into Cg5, Or3o, and TLT as well as various other fandoms.   Great job to everyone that worked on this music vid!

waltuh im dying waltuh
this hits so hard
Cg5…Moving on moving on … it doesn’t really matter … My brain follows a pattern Forget about      Breaking up breaking down  you think it’ll get better but it never does  I feel like I’m dying nobody tells me I’m lying couldn’t hear when I was crying it’s defeating while I’m trying to forget about it
0:26 gravity falls reference
He said in his stories, "don't forget about it", but forget sounds like "4get"
Love the new music always fire! I am hoping that you would do a Music Video about OMORI. Would really love to see it <3
This is absolutely amazing! CG5 and The living Tombstone make the best songs together. I love everything about it, and the animation is just great! You're super talented Charlie, and OR3O too. Listening to this on repeat right now <3
The first couple of seconds was like a slap. To be fair, I was tired and did not such a snappy beat! /pos
THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST SONG I HAVE HEARD IN THE PAST YEAR IT SCRATCHES EVERY PART OF MY BRAIN AND ITS SO EASY TO VIBE TO YET ITS REALLY EMOTIONAL AND AAAAAAAA I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH I CANNOT EXPRESS ENOUGH HOW FIRE THIS SONG IS

awesome and kind sad
How the hell did I get emotionally attached to an orb of light within not even 3 minutes and go through the 5 stages of grief within the time the orb was dying?  Great song, 10/10, experience the grief every time.
I love this! I mean why wouldn't I? The animation was also very good! Why on earth would some random person hate CG5?
0:03  a m o n g  u s
Brilliant 🤩
The amount of references omg
You are amazing
Was not expecting this, was amazed nevertheless
Man the Easter eggs on the wall brings up SO MUCH memories Technoblade Gravity falls Undertale... And that's without talking about the cameos, such as tommyinnit's and Caleb hyles
When the Sun dude died I legit was like ‘NOOOOOOOOO

2:17 Found Disney Gravity Folls Book 3
Damn, i was excited about this song, i was not wrong that i would like it but i didn't expect that i would be able to relate to it somehow
I love the bacon and eggs at the end. Great song by the way, can't believe you just killed the floating ball of joy like that though, almost felt like you were trying to break my heart 😔
The beat is so good, you guys did a great job :)
I saw JELLYBEAN
Great song 😀
0:03 My first thought when I noticed the guy beside the white and blue was. Is that 8-bitryan?
THIS JUST HITS HARD! Great job CG5 and OR30 !!
The lyrics and the song are quite short ,but the emotions they deliver are so strong.  Even without much context you could understand what it is about And with the context I can just say that I can relate to that so much.  Awesome song Cg5, as always.
The ending is so sad
Markiplier in 0:04
It's a good song but I clicked on it after my friends told me it would make me upset because I am sensitive. They were right but I couldn't just miss one of your songs
This a masterpiece
Cool song, when I listened to it first time I thought this song is only an animation but I was wrong. 10/10 great work!🎉
Omg that was sad
Немного странно
Can you make a song about faith the unholy trinity game?
0:57 WHAT
Now this song doesn't sound like we have to sing angrily 😡 but sounds like we enjoy singing and 🎧 enjoy listening to it 😌 👍👍👍

Just finished the song. What a Bop! I'm gonna be repeating "Maybe I'll forget about it" on the daily now.
My god way to make me get so attached to characters in less than 3 minutes. Jeez
I don’t keep up with music news a lot so when this was recommended on Spotify and I saw it was three of my favorite artists I jumped right into listening and holy moly this is so frickin good!
2:19 gravity falls references 👀👀
Anyone else spot the book 3 gravity falls reference
Tbh I forgot
Good song
This was so amazing! Wonderful song, wonderful animation, wonderful lyrics, wonderful everything!  Also...is that william afton from bluey capsules tied on the train tracks?
That was depressing. GREAT MUSIC THOUGH!!! Loved it!
две легенды встретились
The #1 thing I’m seeing from this comment section is that CG5 sees and appreciates us 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲😭❤️

I love the music and the art — the amount of detail in this is just amazing!
in one day i listened to this 8 times no joke
The breaking bad meme reference 😭❤️ props to the animator!
I don't understand but I understood everything. The amount of references. The amount of memes.
The story for those who don't undestand: An unknown Spray Painter is spray painting but then a shiny joyful friend comes out of a Box. The Spray Painter's life becomes happier and they shared alot of happy moments together. A lot of days have passed and then the spray painter becomes depressed instead of happy. It was night then. When their jolly little yellow friend tries to make the spray painter happy but then the spray painter almost smacked his friend in the face. They immediately regret what they had done to their little yellow friend and decided to go run when a car almost hit them. The yellow jolly friend is the one who got hit instead of the spray painter because the yellow friend tried to save its friend the spray painter. When the spray painter picked their friend up they saw their spray paintings turning gray the little ball of joy picked up the spray painting can for the spray painter but when they tried it it has ran out of paint and then they had nothing else to help their little ball of joy and their paintings. The little ball of joy had one last smile and then all its atoms faded away. The spray painter goes into a stage of immediate regret and blamed their self. But after a few moments of grief the sun shined and the spray painter's paintings got their colors back and when the spray painter looks up in the sun, it reminds them of their little friend... The ball of joy...
WOW!!! This was so nice! the story, animations, and the song itself was amazing! It looks like you had so much fun doing this with others!!! All the references  such as the OMORI and Gravity Falls  ones just screamed, "Notice me!" and the EFFORT! LIKE HOW LONG DID THIS EVEN TAKE?!
WOW THAT IS SUCH AN AMAZING SONG! I loved everything about it!!! Such a master piece! Cant wait to see more of your songs!! 💙     Iwill never 4get about it!!! :)
I don't get it.
0:03 Jonathan young and caleb hyles yeah boiiiiiii
The paintings featured in the mural are actually his song's: Duolingo right next to the second chicken Why Does The Chicken Cross the Road obviously the chickens Lancer Theme Remix is obviously Lancer Superstar is Glamrock Freddy Phantom Dancing is Luigi right next to Freddy Run  N Gun/Brothers in Arms/Cuphead Show Song is obviously the Cuphead one Speed in My Soul/RUN is Sonic Show Yourself is Red Among Us  Lyin 2 Me is Purple Among Us  Good to be Alive is Yellow Amogus Phoenix of The Sea is Axolotl  Parappa Plays Funky Music (with cg5) is obviously Parappa  and Dream is obviously "I See A Dreamer""  And that's it! Really cool reference, and a really cool song, gj CG5!
GOD that animation is beautiful
1:54  Technoblade never dies.
THIS IS SO GOOD 🥺 the animation, song, EVERYTHIN
2:19 That Gravity Falls reference is so nostalgic.
I've remembered.... 8 hours late
the hell did i just watch?! And why am i crying about a yellow orb?!
In my hotel the game there is a special customer that comes in and for a second it plays your song once you reach level two
I need a sequel where the orb of light comes back! Please?
I need a sequel where the orb of light comes back! Please?
Man the technoBlade grafiti in 1:55 is so nostalgic, at this point im just scouting for any technoblade easter eggs in cg5's vids
words can’t describe how much I love this
Bro look at “the living tombstone” building and look at their bottom window You’ll see H̸i̸m̸
This is amezing
Maybe I won't forget about this
Love this
idk what this is about but was it necessarily to make me cry
Wat just i watched 😮😮😮
Oh my god oh my god oh my gOD!!!!!!!!! ITS FINALY FRIKIN OUTTTTTTTTTT. definitely worth the wait jeez!!! Love love LOVE the animation goodness lol
Wow everything about his was AMAZING the animation,the singing down to the meaning
Depressing!
yo I was there on the premiere,  Great music video btw. 😊
Wow, I love how your songs can range from stupid John, to this! None the less I think I might need to look at the channel a bit! ❤️
Why did the chicken cross the road
I don't get it. Is this some kind of metaphor?
Nice gravity falls spray paint references. Edit, way too many references
HYDRATE HYDRATE HYDRATE
SHEESH.
i seen a lot of mid youtubers
Wow
fav song rn!
It’s amazing how a whole story is being by the animation. The lyrics in the background bring a whole new perspective to what Flint is going through. Hats off the CG5 and the entire team that worked on this project for over a year. Thank you all for this masterpiece
The amount of references! It was nicely animated and I enjoyed this! (I knew just about every reference)
Well, it's been a while since one of your song didn't make me cry. First i couldn't find the point of a so much catchy music with such sad lyrics. But after reading the context and after second listening on eadphones i think i get it. And i think it's admirable for you to manage to show some deep feelings like this. I'm sure that some day you'll find the perfect one for you, in the meantime you just need to take a deep breath and keep going on. You can do it, you are an awesome man who creats awesome stories with your music and i'm sure you'll find someone as awesome as you are in the inside, far from what we can't see behind the screen/speaker/social medias/etc.  Edit: i forgot about this (lol) but thank you so much for describing what happens in the video. As a blind person who can only focus on the music and lyrics, knowing what's actually going on, what completes the piece of art, it was really heartwarming. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
Dude the storytelling in this is phenomenal, the art work is so gorgeous, the backgrounds made me smile with all the references to nerd culture, I can’t even fathom thinking of how long this took to make, if this is what your making at the start of the year, I’m scared of how high quality you’re videos will be at the end!!
the rotoscope of walter falling over is the only thing i needed to see before i died
This is so awsome
This song is amazing! Nice work guys 👍
1:26 mettaton?
yo am I the only one who saw Bill chiper
ok
Why am I getting the feeling some of that graffiti is foreshadowing some of the upcoming songs?
im curios what is it about or whats it called why the light dude
The amount references in this video is insane, also Gravity Falls
this is awsome! i love it and my favorite part is 0:43 to 0:48

Oh. My. GOSH!!!! And I thought I liked this on Apple Music! This is even better on YouTube! I absolutely love the animation! My favorite part is how the song is peppy and upbeat but also almost like a vent and a way to get the serious, stressful thoughts in your head out  Absolutely wonderful job, CG5! You and everyone else made an amazing piece!! ❤

THE EASTER EGGS IN THIS VIDEO- SO MANY-
Epic
I don't know what is happening, but it's beautiful!
i love this song and how all of my favorite creators mad it plus it has a good story line and it is really sad towards the end and i think this might be my new favorite song
The only bad thing is it’s too short🥲
All the hidden refrences in this is awesome!
Damn the reference count is high I smell a story filled with some lore in this song Seems cool
i’d love a little sun ball of happy drugs
Amogus 0:03
If your confused let me explain:  So its about a man which I'll call him Nate.  Nate was spraypainting until he saw a box.  Inside was a pet gold ball that was a spirit.  I'll call him Fadey.  Nate and Fadey started to have fun.  Until Nate nearly got ran over by a car.  When Nate looked at Fadey, part of him was missing.  So Nate started to: Get angry, dropped Fadey and ran away as fast as he can.  But Fadey was also fast too so he chased Nate.  But then, I think Fadey fell and LOTS of him got missing.  Nate looked at Fadey and started to cry.  And Fadey was like: "Don't worry. *sniff* I'll be back soon maybe. I must perish. Goodbye."  And Fadey died.  Nate started to cry more and was sad.  The end.  Hope you like the story version!  §💛❤ For You ❤💛§ §🎀Valentine's Day🎀§   ✨🌹🌹    🌹🌹✨   🌹🎁👫🌹👫🎁🌹   🌹💎🎉💏🎉💎🌹 ✨ 🌹💋 💍 💋🌹✨       ✨🌹💝🌹  ✨        ✨   🌹 ✨     🍃      🌹       🍃🍃🌹 : )
It was so great getting to see this at Kamicon! Great show
Damn
Your mom
Yeah I won't 4GET about this song. Also anyone else notice the technoblade tribute at 1:53 in this?
I love the living tombstone and i love this song and the animation is amazing I love it so much I love it so much also I love bill at the start and the journal too, I love gravity falls I hope one day I can animate like this animation
y’all i just saw this live… the way i’ve been following him since my age was in the single digits and now i’m 17 and watching him premiere a song at a concert. i don’t really know what to think but the vibes are positive.  HYDRATE
*man I can’t 4GET cuz this song is UNFORGETTABLE.*
It’s a good song if cg5 is in it
1:05 What happened to this guy? Is he- you know…
wasnt expecting to cry over a glowing orb tonight but here we are
BREAKING BAD REFRENCE
There is nothing to worry about cg5, we will always support you and love you and your amazing content❤
This was a lot SADDER then I expected it to be!!!
I got ready for February 10th..
well that was sad
Cg5 let's go I find this so inspiring also uplifting Keep up the amazing work u mean the world to us
the waler white tho
0:10  heh
Yay kinda early!
Why do i feel like you made me unlock an new emotion i have never felt for a tiny ball of light
Dude you have only gotten better and better over time, I'm literally bawling cuz of how relatable this is. I also love all the references in the video from games to friends. Absolutely beautiful!!!!
this is nice i feel so connective with this song great job
YESSIR I LOVE THOS TEAM TOGETHER
this song is so amazing I can't explain it
.......I gotta admit, I was not expecting anything like this but I'm not complaining
That was kinda sad and wholesome!!!
YO! I love this song so much!
Honestly, this song is exactly what I need right now
WOW this is really good, love the Technoblade reference too
this is just amazing dude. he can make a song about anything at this point. keep it up cg5, this is so good 😭😭😭😭😭😭  ive been listening to his songs for over a year now and he's just getting better and better 😭😭💚💚
Such a great song! I love it and the animations? Sooo nice  I don't know if the person who I chatted with will read it, but hopefully we meet again, Voidwatcher. And until then: may the light is beside you on your life journey c:
I love how CG5 made this song centered around anxious feelings and displayed it really well! The animation was also expressive and colorful, while including metaphors and little details that were fun to see!
Is that Kenny?!
I just love this- It's just SO good. but It's Cg5, what else could I expect? just, what a good song. and it's also so full of talented ppl, all of them are realy good! I just love Cg5 so much-
This s honestly so incredible, and i love the lil orb guy. They are my comfort orb now-- no you may not have them.
The yellow orb seems to represent the positive things in life. And when the scene where the guy cried and the yellow orb vanished, a yellow moon appeared in the sky, indicating that even in darkness (which is nightime) there is always light (the moon). The yellow orb didn't disappear it just turn into a moon
Man, something about the little story that plays throughout the animation really resonates me and I don’t really know why. Eh, that just means it’s another great song by the gang. Great song everybody! Definitely worth the hype. ✨✨✨
Wonderful collaboration dude :D
such a banger!
NOOOO! i missed the streammm!!
THIS IS SOOO GOOODD
Anyone else notice Bill Cypher and Journal 3??? 0:25 0:41
Why so many people working on this? I don't get it. I mean, it's good but this isn't even complicated or crazy so I don't get why you'd need that many people just to animate lol
Not me downloading the video (cuz preemy my bois) only at the 30s mark  Edit- I’ve watched the whole vid, and everyone on the team has done a phenomenal job btw, this is gonna be a perma-bop for the foreseeable future
My very feat in this video was walter white. Man didn't even need auto tune
This animation gave me goosebumps omg ❤️❤️
WALTER WHITE also this is an amazing song, i love it
The Walter white meme XD
I love that yall included markiplier in the video!
I JUST BUMPED INTO YOU AT KAMI-KON AND HAD TO DO S DOUBLE TAKE
what happened to your a child like you remix?
Everything about this is Chef’s kiss omg >>>>
maybe..uu fogedebauti'
Hey if anyone reads this: Jesus DOES  LOVE YOU ( yes you) right now even in anything your going through as of now or later, know that he payed a heavy price for you and I to enter the kingdom of heaven that being he died a brutal death, we deserve, to take away OUR sin so we be clean before a HOLY(set apart) and PURE God so I  plead with you if you don't know him as Lord and savior if your not assured or you think of yourself as a good person know that no one good no not one  we're all evil  broken and tainted with sin in HIS sight having no way to enter heaven on our own it's a lie, we're lying to ourselves others and the world by thinking we are good enough just based on our own opinion. God however IS in  control he makes the rules and ultimately he has the final say. what we do instead is to accept his invitation to be apart of his kingdom, so we won't end up in Hell fire. so as I said if don't know ask Him into your heart  right now repent (change your mind) of your ways (sinful practices or lifestyle) and be born again. God himself wants that for you and I do to so we won't perish but be with him in glory, God bless any who stops and reads this your very valuable amen.
I LOVE THIS
I was Legit blind and didn't see that this was 2 minutes
Cg5 I’m your hugest fan I love all your music and you make really good music please keep making more and never give up our comments will help you become stronger 🎉🎉😊😊
This man literally gave us a behind the scenes for a song released a year later. Seriously, was this composed by Lin Manuel Miranda and animated by Studio Ghibli? I wouldn’t even notice a difference! The haunting vocals are almost even claustrophobic at times, but weirdly calming as well. All the little references, an entire world was made for this song and I am here for it. Some of the best work since Monday Morning. Keep it up!
I think I see a few cameos in the back, and I enjoy the memes too! Amazing song!
0:23 is it just me or are the drawings on that wall references to his other songs
Finally the song came out 🤩 😍, I was finally able to listen to it, I'm going to download it to listen to it all the time since the melody and the lyrics inspire me to continue with my life 💛💛♥ Yes, I watched it late and I feel bad because I wanted to see the premiere.🥺🥺but I like the song 😍🥰
Thank you for this song ♥️it expresses my emotions perfectly. I have been in a loop for the past 2 years as everything I knew in my life changed and keeps on changing most of the time. I can't seem to handle or have a grip on things that just sends be back into the loop of anxiety and hopelessness on how I can control my life as a whole and how to control it in the future from where it formally was. But I always try to maintain it and gain it back not matter how many times it has changed or its not what you want at times but it helped me appreciate the small things that are  positive ways and people in your life that support you 100% 💖
man this song is really awesome :D but still so sad. maybe they're gonna make a story of this song.
Walterrrrrrr WHITEEEEE
That Breaking Bad scene got me xD
Столько камео и отсылок  что мне всех не узнать. Радаует в клипе не только отсылки но и визуал с музыкой. Отличная работа
Ok now im just sad
Animation is absolute gold and song is too good to describe in words well done Charlie 👏👏👏
Gravity falls fan  U watched it recently?   /:I
😭😭😭
So wonderful! Such great animation too!! Love all the shout outs and fellow singers in the environment
wait, ho on 0:01 in blue?
To busy watching the story to hear the song 🤣
Walter Hartwell White
my new FAV right now
I know the song is really sad but, can we just appreciate how much of a Bop this is?
the bloody animation feels and looks like a cartoon network cartoon series bruh
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY TWO FAVOURITE ARTISTS FINALLY COLLABED!!! Either way, the song and animation is really amazing as usual
The animations are PERFECT omg i like it picasso
Eso fue increible 🤩🤩🤩🤩
that walter white falling meme got me
0:13 Bill Cipher? Also I never expected a collab with the 2 best singers on youtube. Man, gotta love these channels!
This was an amazing song. With Charlie, OR3O, and The Living Tombstone, this was completely amazing. The amazing high quality animation and beautiful song lyrics, everything about this was truly pure art.
0:57 WALTER WHITE!!!
Everything here clearly has had so much passion put into it from the animation, vocals and tune!  Cg5 thank you for this amazing bop that I will be putting on replay now.
TLT, CG5, and OR3O is absolutely stacked
W  A  L  T  U  H
Is it just me or was I more focused on the plot of the animation?
What if I told you I can experience all of those emotions in the span of 3 minutes?
Memes: the song
I LOVE THE STORY SM
Song request, can you do no big deal from amphibia
This song is fire!
i NEED this instrumental
i've been waiting for this collab for years :)
How many easter egg? This Video: YES
The crossover nobody wanted but did not know we need
This was amazing and I love the animation on this
This released on my birthday so I'm happy lmao.
Love the song references at 0:22!
that was, AMAZING
“Avengers endgame is the most ambitious crossover.” This simply existing:
Amazing, never related to a song more- actual tear jerker. Amazingly made as well!!
The vocals and tune of the song is honestly beautiful. Ty for this masterpiece CG5, The Living Tombstone, and OR3O!! I loved the collab <333
This was a suprise to see such a beautiful song paired with CG5, The Living Tombstone AND OR3O! I mean you are all very talented and work perfectly in one song. I'm glad you made this song because it does speak to me and I feel this way sometimes. I like the references through the graffiti everywhere, it's AMAZING!!
1:34 couldn’t he just…. Stay on the sidewalk???
The animation Is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 😮
Bro so many small details! In the first few seconds I recognized so many things! Like something from Omori 0:01 and the Boombox and Mixtap guys (I forgot what they were called) 0:05  turned into humans, really good stuff
At some point I’ll make a list of all the references in this video
This is a really good song even if it's 2 minutes. The story behind it is sad but CG5 I hope you finally figure out more and more about yourself.
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD! THIS HAS SO MUCH STORY!!! I HOPE I CAN SEE MORE!!
Some little things I noticed:  0:01 dawko at the tree (I think it's him) and DAgames being held hostage for a prank video (surely)  0:03 8bitryan and...jellybean I think? Climbing on the post  0:04 dheusta in the background and...markiplier? Maybe? Probably? IDk but the mustache on the shirt makes me think it's him  0:09 0r30 and cg5,probaly other people but I don't recognize them  0:22 i don't know if they are ALL references to his songs,but the amongus,the ship and dream on the boat definitely are   Apart from that,didn't notice anything else thag isn't pop culture references. The braking bad meme was something I was not expecting in the slightest  And the song,well,would you believe me if I said it was really good? Yes,you would because all of this man's songs amazing and the collaboration of 0R30 and TLT make it EVEN BETTER. This one feels so personal and like he got something out of his chest,which good for him. Also the animation is great dude,like the only thing I really have to say is that it felt short,but that's not even bad! Short songs are cool,in fact I've heard so many long song that this kind of a breath of fresh air for me
I love this song! This animation is so wholesome and sweet. Everything is so nicely put together. Great job Charlie, Or3o, and The Living Tombstone! This is an amazing song and I won't 4GET about it.
KEEP IT UP
Epic :0 i was waiting for this!!!! This Is awesome 🧐🤙
0:17 that has to be an intentional reference to Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen
I love how the intro included a lot of famous youtubers or streamers
3 best artists making a great song
bro this actually art, despite the song being quite short, its a really good one. good job to you and The Living Tombstone
amazing
My life but it’s a song
0:03 LOOK GARY THERE I AM!! But for real, this is definitely a new fav for me that I'll be bumping when I need a boost, awesome work to everyone involved in making this masterpiece!
Incredible. I'm not huge on words but this song brought me to tears. Thank you.
I know you won't see this but I won't ever 4get you cg5, or stop listening to your songs no matter how many times my friends bully me for it
This song is amazing. I'd say the four horsemen of YouTube music came together to make this but we need one more. Again this song is a bop. Loving it.
Amazing job Charlie! Plus everyone else!
Sry I'm 6 hours late ToT
You did Minecraft,FNaF,Sonic,etc and alse Walter white 🤣 Good song, Good Song I love it Its perfect for the everyone whos not happy to his/her life        Like me...
O MY GOSH THIS IS AMAZING
1:37 maybe I’ll 4GET about it!
One thing is for sure, I won't forget about this song! 💪🔥
The end made me cry
Ayo cg5 AND TOMBSTONE? Oh boy
0:03 JELLYBEANNNNN!! SOOO ADORABLE!!!
jesse esta canción esta chida
I never thought of crying at somethind thats animated this was so beautiful ❤️😢
1:35 (maybe I’ll 4GET about it)
The song is great, the art, the animation, Everything! I can't even begin! Its just great, it has no right to be this good man! Great job to the team!!!
another banger! cg5 is really the best at making music.
0:02 If you look closely there's AMOGUS (also sorry if someone already made a comment like this)
You have outdoned yourself this time good sir, i tip my hat to you from one stranger to a man on his road to music legend
Someone name the ball.
the song is good, the animation is perfect, but the meaning is a little unclear. everything happens too fast, I don't understand anything, maybe I'm already old?)
Every song is different from CG5, it always make me feel some kind of way. But with this song, it’s like I felt…nothing. Like the song couldn’t make me feel an emotion. That’s why it’s now my favorite…until CG5 can make a another good song.
What is Something doing there in the beginning? 😯
I love this! Cheers mate 🥂🗿
All I can say was that was one heck of an emotional rollercoaster. GGs Charlie, TLT, and OR3O!
I like scp and fnaf songs so I'm surprised he made songs about them
No words sufficient enough to describe how amazing this was ❤️ I see you! I see what you're doing! It looked amazing and it sounded amazing and I'm feeling a lot rn ❤️❤️❤️
CG5 is the best
After watching this a couple times, It's made me bawl my eyes out, this really goes deep in an emotional level. It's crazy how even if we go through different rough situations, we can still connect and understand each other because at the end of the day we're not all that different from eachother, we all have feelings and emotions. This beautifully shows it, amazing work CG5 I really appreciate this, and I know others do as well.
BRO I GOT A 4 HOUR AD AT THE BEGINNING
0:58 JESSY! Why am i in music video!
do you make the animations or does someone in your crew do it for you and if they make content can you link them in the descirption
THES IS THE BEST SONG EVER in my opinion
You should make a song about Legos or how painful it is to step on one
This is really a masterpiece, y like the colaboración, and the history and tune go incredible 11/10 ❤ 😊
This is just- this is an absolute masterpiece. I wish I could write paragraphs expressing how incredible this song is and how much it’s made me feel, but I’ll try to keep this short and just say that this is gorgeously animated, as always the lyrics are brilliant and all the feelings are just portrayed so beautifully and vividly! Congratulations to all who worked on this for another beautiful piece of art <33
I don't really know what this is based on, but I really love it! The music is great and the art is captivating! I also appreciate the possible symbolism in this!
the first cg5 song that has . ever made me cry, thank you for this. this song is extremely comforting, worth all the wait<3
So what was the point of the living tombstone being there, what he do?
This turned out so well! Glad to see more of you personal side, man!
0:04  markiplier
Gravity falls!
That was just plain awesome!!!!!😁😁
This is the kind of song you can qualify as timeless, because the context never gets old. Just perfect! 💕
Literally the BEST collab ever! Song is amazing guys! :>
This is an amazing song dude!
My interpretation of the song and visuals:  A graffiti artist is living their normal life. Eat, sleep, art, repeat. One day, they start hearing a whispering voice invading their mind. Sometimes it's happy, sometimes it makes them 4get things, and sometimes it's sad. This voice slowly becomes more and more real with each passing day, making the person forget a lot of things and feel emotions they don't usually feel. The voice also makes the person feel 'grey' at times (surrounded by a world of grey). As the artist slowly becomes more and more disconnected from their normal life, the voice grows louder. They try to avoid it, hence all the running scenes and the almost-accident scene, when they reach a dead end - their old painting spot. The art soothes the voice as it grows fainter and fainter, finally going away. The artist realizes that art saved them, as they establish a new relationship with their art and roots and finally leads a normal life again. Tell me what you think! It could also be an awareness song about mental health but idk
The two people who made my childhood did a colab. I cant bolive it
Awsome ❤
MY DUDE. THIS IS LIT
The sheer amount of references in this video is insane, amazing work!
CHARLIE YOU RULE MAN 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
0:25 gravity falls is back
Love the song mate
This song is sick 👍
ive never thought the day would come
I couldn't watch this right away but I immediately clicked on it now. It's 8 AM lol. Some details I noticed: the main characters hair and body turns grey when the song goes "world of grey" This is the best CG5 and Or3o song I have ever heard, and was my intro to Living Tombstone. Kicked it off in 2023! P.S. kinda giving off Ranboo with PTSD kinda vibes
Man I love this like straight up love this. The animation tells a beautiful story and it fits the song perfectly. Well done man well done, your work as always made me happy and others. Keep up the good work man
that thing looks like a stomatitis in my mouth
I DIDNY FORGET
Better than what I thought, keep up the good work!
@CG5 can you put some of your songs on new grounds so people can make Geometry Dash levels with your songs? Also I’ve been listening to your music til late at night and it’s kind of a bad habit but keep up the good work.
YOOOOOOO FIREEE
Bro, thanks so much for providing all the time, i love you man, hope you have a good life
This is good, but I don't really understand the plot happening in the video lol
This is great man, no other way to put it
At the final spray bottle scene, part of me expected him to start using his own blood to paint out of desperation. Should probably cut down on the horror videos

This song and animation has so many different ways to interpret it, and I love that. I see it as using hyperfixations to cope with anxiety and depression, something I and so many others deal with. Thank you for making this.
First off I wanna say the art work is beautiful and I love how you made it like I don’t like you but when you save my life and we start joking and laughing type story. Second off I love the beat the music and the lyrics it’s just so fun and we’re really proud that you made it to make a song with THE living tombstones. And third of all rip to the little moon he was adorable and all he wanted was a friend but at the end of the day he ended it off with a smile really amazing job Charlie
I don't know what to feel seeing Walter White here.
Its soooo good! Worth the wait!
i love u guys so much :) u truly make my day
1 minute into the video and here I am, singing aloud "Maybe I'll forget about it". 2 minutes, and my heart is broken because of a lightbulb. 3 minutes, and I am replaying it. Amazing job, CG5 x TheLivingTombstone x OR30!!
I absolutely love this song! Despite the music being upbeat and catchy, the animation and lyrics tell a whole lot of meaning. I really love these types of songs/music videos because I get to see how an artist can transform a song into a very wholesome and adventurous story with its own theme and explicit message its trying to say to the audience
Ngl I don't really understand the deep meaning of this, but I can tell this has some deep symbolism to u 💛💛
Damn that was a nice story
E
Forget about everything in this video… WAS THAT WALTER WHITE
He storyline is good jeez
1:23 YIPPE
Man this is so good. I haven't heard some good music in a while but this changed that. Keep up the good work😁
ITS AMAZING
25 + OR -  REFERENCES IN 2 MINUTES
Good job! Wow!

something from omori at the start WOOOOOO
I love this music, but please, I have no clue what this about.
Like Celsius said aren’t Fridays the best 🎉
idk if this is a reference to something or not, but the emotions i got from listening and watching the animation were head-on. this is another masterpiece!
I would really like that it's just that the beat what hit harder
I literally cried when the weird round thing died
0:58 WALTUH???????!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I just love how this song can connect with other people, especially those who know what it's like to feel that way, to lose something or to be completely overwhelmed with their daily lives. and this song, maybe they can forget about it. Love you CG5
That was the best Song Ever so now I can never 4get about this Song and Tomorrow is my Birthday this is the Best Song Ever Thank you CG5 your the Best Singer I Can't wait to be Like you
0:01 Me: *does a double take at the corner in the beginning* OH SHI--!
Yet again, another banger from the CG5 team
NO WALTUH FELL! JESSE I'VE FALLEN AND I CANT GET UP!
This is so emotional 😭
I love how they watch water white dying
I loved it as it reminds me of my own past as a kid running away from home because my life was miserable.  It's an amazing song, hope you keep up the good work.
Okay this one is definetly it!
this hits hard this is one of the best songs i have herd in a while  and it is from some of my favorite youtubers.

THIS ANIMATION IS SOOOO COOL❤️❤️❤️I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT, you came back stronger than ever 1:54 I love the Techno Tribute, it's absolutely amazing and adorable 😍🥰 thank you for that
I feel like this comment is out of place but                    0:01 *is that an omori reference*
that's the kind of music video you have to rewatch three times, so many cool details AND DON'T TELL ME I CAN PAUSE I WOULDN'T DARE STOP THAT FIRE SONG
Probably one of your best songs tbh
This song helps me out when im sad and thinking about horrible things
what i just did witness
I learnt nothing from this
hey that's pretty good!
Great song but. . . WHY SO SAD!!!
Maybe I'll not forget about this :D
I love it 👑❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love how you can see easter eggs in more than half of the animation
I love or3o
I Love How Most Of The Art If A Reference To Famous Things While All The Other Art Is Just References To His Past Songs. Its Such A Cool Detail. And Almost All Of The People In The Video Are Real People Or Just Famous Video Game Characters. Its So Neat!
A bop that be dealing high amounts of smiles and emotional damage
It was short but good
My music teacher cried. Great job everyone!
L+RATio
Always giving everything in the songs, you are the best!😆
4GET Is a guardian..Then somewhere a mysterious gray thing spread’s around and then..4GET dies..Then CG5 Was the one tried to save him.. It’s very sad.. they are very good..friends..and Then 4GET gets ran over.. then dies.. The whole city is gray..4GET fades away.. he had a peaceful time…

This song is kinda great but there is one problem WHY IS IT SO SHORT MAKE IT LONGER thats the problem its too short
AMAZING WORK! I love it a lot! It's very creative and I love the artwork!
1:26 mettaton! Undertale reference.
I can't recognize the living tombstone in the song
This man is getting better and better every year
You always amaze me haha ♡
I didnt knew why, but the first time i heard this song I feel like it was so relatable for some reason. After reading the story and understanding the deeper meaning behind it i could very clearly see why. It is a great song and the story behind it and the song itself really gives me some hope on getting to feel better one day. Amazing job CG5
We’ll.. 4GET Is nice Then it was so sad…he faded away…he had a wonderful life.
The art, vocals, story, it's all amazing! I hope you're doing better.. anxiety can be crushing but I'm glad your powering through it!   Thank you for sharing this inspirational story with us through this amazing song, I've had it on repeat since the premiere :)
Just amazing honestly don't think I've ever seen such great animation in a music video either it goes so well with the song and almost made me wanna cry, another great job my man!
Gotta give CG5 credit, he really does come up with one of the greatest songs of all time and talented song artist and writer
We need a holow night song or maybe a yo kai watch song
Omg I loved it and the animated it’s so cool and it’s so awesome
this is truly amazing i like cg5's song's it give's some good vibe's thanks cg5 and living tomstone
i was at the chat i left to watch something else i chatted alot aswell!
This is what ChatGPT thinks of the lyrics , mostly did this because I can often have trouble understanding / seeing the deeper meaning of words and I thought some others might be like that, it can also give another perspective  Prompt: What might this song mean, what might the lyrics mean ?  Song Name : 4GET Artists : CG5 , The Living Tombstone, OR3O Lyrics: Moving on, moving on, It doesn’t really matter, My brain follows a pattern. Forget about it. Breaking up, breaking down, You think it’ll get better, but it never does.  I feel like I’m dying. Nobody tells me I’m lying. Couldn’t hear when I was crying. It’s defeating when I’m trying To forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.  I’m spending every day, Wishing I was okay. Surrendered to a world of gray. Hey. My car is broken down, I can’t get out of town. So I’ll walk along a road of shame. Headache!  All my thoughts are getting scattered. Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.    Response: The lyrics of the song "4GET" by CG5, The Living Tombstone, and OR3O appear to describe a situation of moving on from a difficult situation or relationship, but finding it challenging to do so. The speaker seems to be struggling with their emotions and thoughts, and feels like they are stuck in a cycle of pain and disappointment. They mention feeling like they are "dying," not being able to forget, and being overwhelmed by silence. The speaker also mentions feeling defeated and like they are trying to escape from their problems.  Overall, the song appears to be about the difficulty of letting go of negative feelings and memories after a breakup or similar experience. The speaker is trying to move forward, but they are struggling to do so and are feeling overwhelmed by their emotions and thoughts. The repeated phrase "forget about it" seems to be an attempt to push away the negative feelings, but they continue to resurface.   overall, I think I agree with ChatGPT, I still think it is amazing how much emotion and feeling can be put into a song
this sucks
DJsmell cameo! 1:34 hell yeah
Man, You Blew this out of the PARK! 10/10
damn that nice
Bro this came out on birthday, no joke- As usual, birthday or not, I'm not surprised this is a masterpiece as usual! Three awesome song writers= 3 times the better song. Keep it up, all of you!
Woah 💖
I love how the animation has lots of references to other fandoms!
Now my favorite CG5 song! I think this was the first time I actually got a bit emotional over a song. Just the animation, lyrics, and wonderful singing screams CG5 and everyone on your team. I’m happy so many people relate to this and how much of an influence you are to me and millions of others. One more thing, I thought it was interesting how the “Duhduhduhduhduhduh” coincides with The Ball of Hope’s (as I call it) movements throughout the song. This was such an accomplishment for not just you and your team, but us too. Keep on CG5-ing!!!
First time getting chills from an animation, the entire song was amazing, but that ending absolutely slapped, Charlie came back stronger then ever👍
Get ready for February 10
Ayo I saw markiplier
The animation in this is spectacular! And the lyrics, I'm so glad you feel comfortable with sharing stuff that is so personal to you! (Side note, the character design for Flint kind of looks like what Crying Child from FNAF would've looked like if he had grown up. Very off topic :P)
Just… Woah
CG5 I just had the best idea for your next song.. a Ducktales one! For me my friend would really love it and his birthday is October 15th so maybe if you could make it then I wouldn't have to do a lot of work
... I think this song just saved my life. I was legit planning to kms bc I just can't cope anymore but this song kinda snapped me out of it. Granted now I'm bawling my eyes out in the floor on and off but that's better than trying that again I think. 😅
What a beautiful day to cry, I just love this bro...
I can’t describe the song in words. It’s beautiful. The story is really touching.
One word is all I need to describe this video and song. Beautiful
This song is so good
Actual fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
spotted Jinx, TBH creature, Hatsune Miku, Garfield, Technoblade tribute, Gravity Falls journal + Bill Cipher, Jerma, The Mandela Catalogue, Deltarune, Undertale, Amogus, Biblically accurate angel + Kirby, a LOT of signatures & logos, Sonic the hedghehog, Luigi(?), Minecraft Axolotls, Glamrock Freddy, that yellow dog rapper that I forgor the name of, Dream,  L + ratio, OMG its Grace, and other fandoms that I'm not in
I love how they fit all the YouTubers, gravity falls characters and a subway suff vibe. Nice song guys
Waltuh waltuh waltuh waltuh waltuh
You are reaching Henry stickmin levels with the amount of references

I was so excited for this song and it exceeded my expectations! Well done CH5! 🥳💜
The living tombstone is one of my favorite artists along side CG5 is a amazing combination.
THE ORB GUY NOOOOOOOOO
This, I needed this
JESUS CHRIST CG5 DID IT AGAIN A NEW SONG TO MY FAV KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK CG5 LOVE YAAA LETS GET U HIM TO 4MMM!!
I love the meaning to this song and the references to a lot of stuff I know this was amazing animation vocals and lyrics that were relatable wish I found this out sooner
“The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.”   Listening to this song brought this to mind. Great job, y’all, you never cease to amaze me.  Edit: Must I say that every song has a purpose, whether it attempts to do that or not. CG5 has generally changed my life. Listening to these song has brought me through tough times. Thank you.
Waltuh
The beat is stuck in my head after listening to this. Awesome!
I *WILL* cry every time i listen to this song now because orb friend is dead  Great song though! I really like it!
I cannot stop watching this! I love the song so much and when I saw the animation for it, it was even better! Words cannot describe how beautiful this is! The character design, colors, and expressions. This is a masterpiece 👏🏻✨
Gooooood
In the beginning: THIS IS A VIBE at the end:**crys my soul out**
thats the best animation i have ever seen for a music video
I don’t know how, but when the little glow happy guy died I almost cried, it was sad but then the sun came out and kinda made it less sad
yo the animation in siiiiiiiiiiiiiick
CG5 AND TLT WIT OR3O
Cg5 I Watched Your Duolingo Song That You Made 3 Years Ago
BEST VIDEO IN THE WORLD
THE ULTIMATE COLLAB
i was not expecting to cry, amazing song as always ^^
AW MAN!! the long wait was worth it
awesome 🤩🤩
Oo
Love how this came out!! Whether its based off of pop culture, or something personal to yourself, it always comes out as a banger 😁 Also sorry for running u over with me and Kathy's truck my b
This is the most William Wisp thing ive ever seen
Awesome, and a real thing that happens, everyone needs a friend like that at some point
there is a lot of easter eggs like the last one where she/he look the wall there was a tecnoblade memorial(i think)
Man this is amazing! The lyrics, art, everything!!! Couldn’t be here for the premiere, but either way straight to my playlist!!!
As a 15 year old in high school, im not doing so well if you look at me emotionally. Things are already hard for me in sophmore year and being a kid who has moved schools 5 times, that too as a recent immigrant to the US, my social life hasent been the best. I’ve always been a fan of CG5’s songs but this one really hit me. I feel like there was no better way to express what i feel on a daily life than expressed here in the lyrics and tune. I really love the work with you and the team man, its nice to know other people exist who are aware of people like me.
1:44 Da da da da da da 🙃
Idk if it's just me cuz i keep seeing random youtubers in the vid
This hits home a little too well... Climbing my own endless ladder, battling with multiple mental illnesses. Trying to forget about it, by pretending everything's ok to people around me.
This is a banger! Congrats CG5!
It's interesting to see the guy's hair change from vivid brown to gray as it seems that they enter a deeper depressive state. As if the color drains from their hair as their desire to art falls away slowly. Then the little light, a little ball of hope that follows him around as a physical reminder of his past desire that looms around him and as he tries more and more things, it just becomes more apparent that it won't go away, no matter how hard he tries to do something else and "forget about it".   The day being high value colors and filled with life, as the time of his life where everything is lively and colorful. Then, as he finds art as his passion, his little ball of hope, he looks around and finds fault in his own work compared to everything around. Filling his mind with senseless noise to deter him, he tries to forget about the passion in the hopes he won't fall victim to comparing himself to everything. Trying new things doesn't seem to help him any as he fails in them, then he goes and finds his passion for art playing around with everything around him, at the theaters and in the park, reminding him of his passion. As night comes, there is no life around and the low value colors darken his life. The only light remaining is his little ball of hope and passion for art that keeps him going through the dark times, which he vehemently tries to fight and get away from for fear his passion would not being good enough. Then he gets shocked by a life-altering event in the darkness that leaves him to realize that there is no good or bad and he needs to turn his life around. However, due to his constant fighting his passion, he starts to lose himself as his passion finally starts to slip away in front of his own eyes. As he rushes through the dark, he finds himself back where he once found his passion for art, from where it all began. As he tries to rush into art to keep his little hope alive, he can't find it within himself to do so as there is no more fuel for that small passion and it disappears. As he is enveloped in the darkness, as he doesn't create something immediately, he remembers that he can't just give up and forget again. Slowly, realization shines on him, and it is bigger than ever as he finally comes to see his passion as something that isn't small and weak. His passion is bright and will light up the dark times as he stops forgetting and remembers that he doesn't have to be the biggest out there nor the best. Just that it makes him happy to do it.  At least, that's my take on the whole shebang. I love it to bits and will be listening to it for quite some time to come. Thank y'all for this masterpiece.
That really hurts me the way that the lil dude disappeared 😢
Very nostalgic song and animation, i love it
It's pretty ok my fav part was with the livingtomston
Lo más hermoso que he escuchado 🥺🎉🎊🎊🎊🥳mi favorito 😌🥳☺️
I really like the opening scene with the spray painting of all the stuff CG5 has done
This is a metaphor for his dad, CG4, who forgot to get the milk.
Please make more original songs like this! This is super duper amazing-words can't even describe it. You are one of the most talented people on the platform, please never stop doing what you love!
All I can really say is just wow, the colors, the lyrics, even the references. Everything was amazing, when I first saw the trailer I was excited enough as is but this is so much better than I ever thought it could have been! I also went back through the song trying to find all of the references and I love how a lot of your songs were included during the spray-paint scene (if you know what I mean) like "Why did the chicken cross the road", the among us songs, "Phoenix of the sea", "Run" and even the funny parappa mod! And at the end I did see what I think was a technoblade reference so all I have to say is O7. But besides all of that the song was just amazing and I appreciate you taking all of your time and effort into this song, now please go and take another break, you deserve it.
not me crying from a music video 😅🤚
Dude the l + ratio hidden on the wall got me
This song really hits home. I have pretty bad anxiety and I can relate to a lot of the concepts in the video. The animating is PHENOMENAL! The songwriting is AMAZING!! And the singing!!! POGCHAMPION :D I love it!! Congrats on another amazing song Charlie!
Okey now this was almost a masterpiece, the song is so catchy by just hearing it for the first time and the plot of the animation is so touchy, awesome job!
This is just amazing. I like all your songs, which means that i really like this one too. I dont even know what else to say, this is just a masterpiece!
I saw 8-bitryan and dawko
he makes great songs no matter the topic or the type of genre he can always pull out something great!
How come it's still quiet?
This isn't just a song, this is art. Loved this immediatly, everything about it spoke to me. All three of these artists continue to work magic, keep it up! Love you guys ❤
I am so happy I love this song already
this is not rly good unfortunately, which is the case for a lot of recent cg5 songs.  I know he can do better as well, theres so much potential here and it didnt hit, which again, is the case for a lot of this guys songs
i love every single reference and detail in this video
STOP THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS😭😭 THIS LITERALLY MADE MY DAY SO MUCH BETTER❤
This made me cry 😢
Express your feeling with yon spray paint art. 😎
this relates to me, always trying to dorget about my stresses that i eventually get overwhelmed with

Wow!! this is so fantastic!! the song, the vocals, the visuals, animation, meaning, storyboard, everything!! I can tell how much time and effort it took to make this fantastic project collaboration with many big famous talented people, great work as always!!
good job :D
Loved all the fun references in the spray paint!
Did Anyone Get the BreakingBad Reference? I Thought that Was Creative!
The first time I listened to this, I already knew it was going to be in my head for days. This song is truly something else. The visuals are so beautiful and well-done, especially the graffiti, and the story is really nice, with the little ball of light being the most adorable thing I've seen in a long time! And, of course, the music itself is amazing. The vocal performances by everyone are wonderful, and the composition is also really great, and makes the whole song feel really upeat and modern! This song is one I truly won't 4GET about, keep up the great work!
Ooooo!!!! I adore the character design, and this whole thing!!! It’s so good!!
Ok so which one is the gravity falls fan
thought it was gonna suck it was alright
Ok you don't have to hit me in the feels like that. I love it 😻
Cg5 strikes again to make an awesome song. The singing was perfect the background music was awesome. And the animation was amazing. And I love all the funny references in the background.
This hits so close to home but thank you
This is making my day AHHHHH
Nice. That’s all I have to say.
This song is amazing 😊😊😊
THIS WAS SO GOOD! I love all the animation cameos of other creators and the ending had me sobbing. Also the breaking bad reference. The second I heard this song it was added to my playlist! Love your music Charlie!

Greatly Nice 💙💖💞💖💜
AAAA THIS IS SO GOOD!! I LOVE IT!!! GREAT WORK EVERYONE!!!!!
PLEASE CG5 WE NEED AN INSTRUMENTAL VERSION RN
CG5 is always having bangers, this is amazing I can’t believe that the three legends CG5, TLT, and OR3O came together and made this, the visuals are stunning, the music is insanely good, and what’s not to love about it?
The story was sadder than the song
this song makes me big sad :( also amazing song!!
"My last blob friend turned into the moon."  "That's rough buddy. "
AAAAAAAA THIS WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT I LOVE THIS SONG great job all of you involved in this project its truly amazing what you people and do this is going in my playlist for sure!! keep it up and never stop guys your the best!
0:01 BRO SOMETHING IS THERE (FROM OMORI)
OMG I'M GOING TO THE KAMI-CON AND IM GONNA GO TO THE CONCERT THERE!!!!! CAN'T WAIT TO SEE EVERYONE THERE!
man that did not need to hit so hard as it did
I don't understand the story in the animation but it's NOICE
Yay
YOOO this is so good and the animation was soo cute oh my goodness you've done it again!
Ah, I love the visuals and just the general vibe of the song! It kinda reminds me of how toxic positivity can sometimes be destructive and wear you down a lot. Kinda fits the happy music but sad lyrics vibe a lot XD
It may have been a bit short, But if im being honest. This is something I could listen to every night. And the pain that he's going through can relate to some people, including me. Usually, I could cry a bit when it rains at night when I try to sleep since I have depression, but knowing this just released and this was my first time I listened to this I felt like there can be some hope and happiness somewhere. And this started to make me feel better now. Thank you for the amazing songs you make and the ones you'll make in the future! <3 -Visoka
Cg5 song is a masterpiece to hear
This music is very good and is happy Cg5 is very good talent
is that an undertale i see???
is that a gravity falls i see???
Alot of cameos here! I saw Caleb Hyles, Jonathan Young, Markiplier, CG5...that's all I got though.
I'm late..
OMG THIS IS AWSOME
Walter 😳
This was so so good!   I had to re-listen a couple times to really get it as I was so focused on the little references on the walls everywhere, I'm actually impressed in myself I got understood 90% of them. The Gravity Falls ones especially mean a lot to me, because that show changed my life too, and it's nice to see other people who had that experience.   I'm really proud of you for creating this, I wish I had time a couple hours ago to listen to it on it's premiere, but not watching it live doesn't take away from it at all. This is probably one of my favorite original songs you've made, it's really great.
there was no hesatation at any moment
:))
This was amazing. The ending was a bit sad, but then it got like a quick little turn around which is pretty cool! I also loved all the references all throughout the video, and it's just a big reminder of how far we have come. The future will certainly hold many big things for everyone, and I'm glad to watch along
Cool yeah keep it up i love that
bro im vibing  while shes crying on the floor
Man this is a great song and I love the beat. Also good job for animator it looks great. Keep up the good work.
BANGER ONCE AGAIN YES
I'm surprised technoblade is an Easter egg. (1:54)
Ahh ima cry i relate to this so much
incredible.  but oreo's voice in the beginning, WHY IS IT SO AUTOTUNED? IT MAKES ROBOTS' EARS BLEED... EW.
why  u gotta make me cry so early in the morningh????? <3
HOLY MUFFINS. CG5, I just- wow. You’ve done it again. Made me freakin cry over a song that I’m listening to for the first time.  The animation was flawless, the vocals pitch-perfect as usual. Amazing job. Keep at it, my friend.
This was truly a work of art! Great job to everyone involved! ❤️ And may I say I love that gravity falls reference lol
"All the silence getting louder" damn, that hits harder than the chancla
0:47 Maybe I forget about it 😏😉❤️

THIS IS EPIC WHAT
Bruh, it both it does have so many references yet everything feels connected somehow. It just shines.
This is great
Congratulations, you got the hood ending
I don’t get it
Omg! This was so good! Keep up the good work!!!
This morning when it came out on Apple Music I listened to it non-stop fire song! Worth the wait ❤❤❤🔥🔥
Awesome music video!!!!!!
CG5 x TLT x OR30 has to be one of the best collabs, the music , the vibe, the feelings are all so good, [Even though this song was about a struggle you had , and expressing it, it's really relatable when you have that spark of joy that you keep to yourself, and then you have to let it go] *read the context of the song you'll get what I'm talking about everyone else*
Twink Anthem lol
bro looks like glam
3 features in one song. Wow
This was amazing and made me tear up a bit. I don't know why, it's just...really good. You're so skilled! I hope you keep making this wonderful music.  Thanks for all the stuff you do
Can you make a song about a creepypasta from Trevor Henderson called cartoon spider pleeeeeeeeaaaaaaaassssss😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫
NAH OKAY THIS WAS A BANGER AND SO GOOD I LOVED THE PRE SAVE AND THE ART?! AND SO MANY REFERENCES!!! SO GOOD^^!! Charlie remember to always take your time and think about your mental health! keep being awesome!💙💙 And your story is important! i deeply can relate maybe not in your way but in a way and it’s very awesome to hear what you’re going through in a song remember Charlie always be awesome and never let anything deter you!
The song is stuck in my head now
I like how there are many reference from games and movies like bill cipher from gravity falls and Walter white from breaking bad in this song, there is a lot of pop beats and it sounds like very metallic yet not at the same time. Anyway, nice song
I can definitely relate to this song :]
SO GOOD
wait this was two hours ago?
nice
THIS IS AMAZING THE ANIMATION AND MUSIC IS ON POINT!!!! Also there is a LOT of Easter’s eggs :D
awsome music CG5 keep going pal!
Wow
Wow TLT and CG5 make a collaboration!!!
Just so many YouTubers and game in the videos!!
I wonder where DJsmell and Kathy are going on that car, but whether I do or not get an answer, I just wish them a happy road~  This song makes me feel feels tho, and I'm not sure I want them to stay in me. Great one
I love how there are little artworks in the graffiti paintings at the beginning
what the hell is this song even about? like it's a good song, i'm just genuinely confused.
This video has so many references I can’t keep track of them all
Man, i am really feeling this, it's like you wrote my mind into a song lol
My three favourite artists!❤
This was awesome CG5, I also noticed at the start that there was a spray painting of all your recent songs
Holy crap! This is amazing! Keep it up!
HELLOOOOO Srry that im late, i had school homework TwT this song is AMAZING! GOOD JOB EVERYONE!
Wow. This is like masterpiece. Clip looks awesome and song sounds really catchy.
Schnazzy
Worth the wait like always ✌️
This is not what i expected but i like it a lot, the animation and the song are really good!
SUBBBBBB TOOOOOOO CG3 or else you get stuck in the bendy song and die
This is beautiful!!! I love everything about it aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
explodes
I alr knew this was gonna be good when I saw Or3o
Where pin.
Ouch I'm crying
God what a great song, I absolutely love it the melody is so amazing and the lyrics are incredible!
Fun fact this background music is Kahoot music :D
This song was a bop
0:03 if yiu did not see the secret it’s jelly bean climbing a pole also amongus
Dang. I actually relate to this a lot. Maybe not the exact thing that CG5 explained in his Google Doc, but something similar.
it feels like living tombstone was the one responsible for the animations have you seen that persons animation AMAZING
Yet another banger Charles :D
10/10
here to remind that waltuh is fallen down in the cinema
DAMN THE ANIMATION WAS GOOD AND ALSO THE LYTICS NOICE WORK
im not crying, you are. this song has hit cords in my heart and soul. love it and getting it for my apple music to listen to it
Jesse! I'm in a CG5 video, Jesse!
Today is my dad birthday and you are my favorite singer LOVE YOU <3
OMG THE ART AND MUSIC IS TOP TEIR DUDE!
WALTUH!!!!!
OMG I had dajvu of this song specifically at time 1:09-1:27  nice song 👍
i feel him...
0:01 omg mari something is painted on the bridge piller to the right i love that so much
Nice
YES
💜💜💜
This song was gorgeous and I can relate to the lyrics 😌 also the animation was so lively and give off good vibe, though there was bits were it got sad and panicky.   Might've read this wrong....lol  The fact that his hair goes grey shows that he is losing his bright spark and passion, only for a friendly face (Ball) to show and help him....though the Ball does its best to give him hope but ends up getting hurt. The Ball could be positivity that he has even though his mental health tells him otherwise (Negative feelings/Thoughts), when the ball dies....he doesn't want to be alone and stuck in an endless loop of negativity when the moon comes from behind the cloud his art regains their colour (his passion) and remind of the ball that brighten up his world. This boy is a Survivor and he is starting to hope again.  Love this so much! I recognise some people in the video 🔥😊🤩
I give the song a 7/10. The lyrics were great and the main chorus sounded amazing. But it’s not one that I want to sing along to because there’s barely any lyrics. It seems like after a minute it’s just the same beat over and over. But I give it a 7 because god that Corus is amazing!
This has to many refrences
CG5 needs to hit the big time he's turning into a artist to who made music about games and then a musician slowly making his own songs and I love to see it
THIS IS PREMIUM GRADE A FIRE RIGHT HERE
0:43 DO I SEE A GRAVITY FALLS REF?!?
AAAAAHHHHHHHH I LOVEEEEEE IT!!!!!
A collab between 3 of my favorite youtuber bands/singers????? Hell yesss
Not only is the song amazing but the animation is too! You can really tell a lot of effort was put into this and it pays off so much! Great work as always!!
You should really make a song about My Singing Monsters
I missed the live stream 😃🔫
0:45     that one moment of adhd when your anxiety is getting to you
0:47 maybe I’ll 4GET about it
+ I am sad
Everyone did such a good job on this!! 😍
There are so many Easter eggs and this is AMAZING I love you content and you are amazing 🤩
Hello CG5, Before I get into how amazing this song was. I just want to say that I have been such a big fan for a long time. You have gotten me through my middle school years. I just want to say thank you. This song was really catchy and really good. Just one question? Have you heard of Chewiecatt because I think you two would make a banger song together.
Yaaaaaa new song!!!!!!!!!
Нечего не понял, но мне понравилось.
The amount of easter eggs in this video perfection
Maybe this song could be in remind of 2023
Bro i found amongus and jellybean
The song was great! The music video was too! So many references-
This was incredible to watch. 100000000/10 CG5, you are one of the most incredible songwriters I’ve ever heard. Keep on doing what your doing, and never give up. God bless
This is the best song i ever heard good job bro keep it up
That was awesome! I love everything about that! The song, visuals, and meaning were all great! Charlie, Or3o, TLT, and the animators did such I great job! ❤❤
the amount of references is crazy
I loved the various Technoblade references throughout the video.
I’m crying 😭
this song is really good but i need that instumental
This song goes hard! And super relatable too so thank you❤️
AYYYYYYYYYYYY
I knew it you were working with the living tombstone
Perfect song. Just wish it was longer.
woah this is good
This was a really neat song, the storytelling was just great! And I get it, anxiety can be stressful, Good job with everything you've done and I really hope you can have a great year!
I love the song and how there’s so many Easter eggs and people we know from the community it was like a scavenger hunt of pop culture, media, YouTubers etc so I give it a 10/10 I really like it and the work you guys did so keep it up
Love the song!
When I clicked on this, I was not expecting to get so attached to a floating orb of light, yet here I am, bawling. The way you guys manage to express so much emotion through the combination of lyrics, tone, melody, and visuals is amazing! Thank you for a song I'll replay so much that I'll memorize it within a week lol
This just popped into my recommendations and i was like  ALRIGHT  IT'S HaaAAAPENNING
0:01 you can see Tommyinnit , BBH and I think Karl Jacobs
I LOVE THIS ADDING TO MY PLAYLIST❤
this hits hard oh my god.
Omg his is back
i 4got
I was expecting this to be good   This is amazing ❤❤
0:11 quackity is in tree
WOW
The animation is so good! The song is kinda mid though.
Jesse, I'm in a CG5 music video, Jesse.
waltuh
The animation, the song, the lyrics, simply great, clearly a masterpiece but of course it's from CG5 himself!!!✨
At 1:45 it sounds just like Save Your Tears by The Weekend
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!! I’ve been so hyped ever since you gave us the first sneak peak months ago! The animation, lyrics, vocals, just everything is so good!! Great job to everyone who worked on this!!
thank you to whoever rotoscoped walter i love you
Another masterpiece 👌
walter
Isn't it awesome when you go to the comments and it isn't all shitpost memes about the references in the video, but how the song is absolutely divine and everyone liked it that just hypes you up? Yes CG5, i can read your mind. I know what you do on  Tuesdays.
The amount of references at every corner amuses me
one day i'll start becoming famous one day
DO YOU BREATH GOT DAMN
esperamos mucho tiempo que sacaras algo normal pero lo que hicieron fue magnifico 🤩
Finally the original music has arrived.
well you have to admit it, dreams do come true
It has a sad anding
Another banger from Charlie. I love your songs. I've been listening to them from the very, very start. Can't wait for more!
The OG nostalgic song creators cone outa nowhere and just punch me in the face with it. Great song 10/10
1:54 the technoblade reference, man i miss him
This is so good! The animation is fire and the song is a banger (per usual) and it is amazing to see how CG5 has grown over the years. Great stuff dude! 🔥🔥🔥
This song is so meaningful, it hits so hard. This song is awesome!
Oh wow I love this song cg5 and TLT👍😉
Wow can’t believe djsmell and I would try to crash into someone in a music video! 😌 This song means so much to you Charlie and I’m so happy it’s finally being shared to everyone so they can relate to it too! Wonderful job! 👏💚
I can tell so much work has been put into this, ITS UNBELIEVEABLE! CG5 you really out did yourself on this one. Your verse, OR3O's verse, and TLT's instrumental made this song even better!
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
That was a great song, Charlie! OR3O did really great too!!! The animation was so good!!! I’m never going to 4GET about this!!
I literally gotta pause every minute just to see all the Easter eggs 😭😭
BANGER!
omg, this is so good, i love it 💕
I’m so glad to grow up with you guys
Animation hmmm perfect❤
So good 👍 👍   I would give more thumbs up but I only have 2 hands, lol
Amazing
Good lyrics?!??! Impossible
This is very underrated
It is just amazing how he does the animations so goodly it is amazing 🤩 (I am still working on my anime)
Alguien más siente que lloro con esta hermosa canción y la excelente animación
Wow, really amazing as expected, from such a legendary team
On “4GET,” CG5 sings about his issues with anxiety he fought throughout his life, which he touches on in a Google Document revealing the background and story behind the song. The song’s title is a leet speak on the word “forget” – a theme CG5 heavily touches on, especially about forgetting negative thoughts. Contrasting the lyrics is a peppy beat that incorporates elements of the electronic genre, including vocoded vocals for both CG5 and OR3O.     LYRICS: [Intro: CG5] (Hey!)  [Verse 1: CG5] Moving on, moving on It doesn't really matter My brain follows a pattern Forget about it Breaking up, breaking down You think it'll get better But it never does  [Pre-Drop: CG5] I feel like I'm dying Nobody tells me I'm lying Couldn't hear when I was crying It's defeating when I'm trying to forget about it All the silence getting louder, and louder, and louder-r-r-r-r-r-r Maybe I'll forget about it  [Drop: CG5] Ta-da-da-da-da-da  [Verse 2: OR3O & CG5] I'm spending every day Wishing I was okay Surrendered to a world of gray (Hey-ey) My car is broken down I can't get out of town So I'll walk along a road of shame (Headache!)  You might also like Call Me What You Like Lovejoy ​​give a little (2023) LeGrand Whopper Whopper Burger King  [Pre-Drop: OR3O & CG5, Both] All my thoughts are getting scattered Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it All the silence getting louder, and louder, and louder-r-r-r-r-r (Maybe I'll forget about it) Maybe I'll forget about it  [Drop: CG5 & OR3O] Ta-da-da-da-da-da Ta-da-da-da-da-da (Woah!) (Oh) (Woah!)
I think I related with this song :)
OH MY GOD This is an absolute masterpiece you all should do more songs like this PLEASE ❤
I love all of the gravity falls references!
And now I have goosebumps
:0
Moon light, the best friend of an street artist
WE DIDN'T FORGET!!!! Time to listen to this fire track!!!
there were SO MANY REFERENCES
soo good music
Right now I have a very hard time dealing with school and thinking about the future. The way I deal with it is just ignore it and just keep on goin with life. But that is greatly affecting my grades and my parents have noticed and scolded me. And it’s not helping that I miss the times from before. So this song has hit me deeply, maybe things would be better from now on. :DD
0:04 among us in the alleyway
BANGER 100%
At 1:25 can we all appreciate that Mettaton from Undertale was added into this, in the background?
Thank you for your amazing work CG5. I love your Collab and I think you all did an amazing work. The animation, background music, and lyrics are each just so amazing in their own little ways. Again thank you ❤️ :)
God bless you
Man! I wish I knew how he keeps making these amazing videos
1,788
The art-style, the music, the transitions are just too good man! I love all the details in the background too like graffiti of your past songs and cartoons! Continue to make amazing bangers and you are amazing king ❤
what is this song about no offense
Another BANGER I appreciate that hidden gravity falls book this was fire🔥🔥
The art, both musical & animation wise is so good-
This made me cry. I love this song ❤❤❤ y’all are AMAZING. And I’m talking about each and everyone who worked on this. I appreciate you creativity 🫶🫶🫶❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Okay CG you some make a choo choo Charles song but I also kind of forgot and great team like great match
I like all the references to tv shows
to those of you that are confused about the story i think i know it  cg5 is just a guy that likes graffiti and all ways thinks about 4geting stuff then he meets the orb and starts to appreciate life and not just 4geting about stuff then one day the orb gets confussed and thinks or3o is cg5 because they look the same and trys to play but oreo gets mad and runs away the orb see's that the light is red and or3o nearly gets hit by a van but the orb pushes her out the way and gets hit and dies  edit: i was wrong
It’s nice how the animation was able to fit in a whole lot of references to other songs as with other creators too, it’s nice
This is so amazing the animation and instrumental and everything !! Charlie said on his insta live that this was a HUGE project that they worked over a year! It turned out sooo well! I think this song is personal to charlie. Even tho it's an emotional song, Charlie decided to put a vibe into it, which true fans love/like  Overall, it was great work to everyone who was into this 👏❤️.
This is such a well created and written storyline in the song and animation. 😄✨🎵I was kinda sad about the end, but I believe they could never “4get” them. ☀️💓I also feel that maybe the happy orb was revived from the spray-painting? 😁🎨
0:03 Caleb Hyles and TLT 😍
Any SG5 song sounds just fine, but with the living tombstone and OR3O I can safely say that you have created a masterpiece
I love this animation 🥺
The best song ive ever seen :')
Dang… That was deep…     This man just gettin’ better and better!!!
I love it! ❤ Keep up the great work 👍🏻😃
Best Collab ever
The song amazing, the animation awsome, love all the reference from youtubers(tommyinit, badboyhalo, you ecc), games(sonic, kirby, fnaf, undertale, cuphead, among us ecc) and series (gravity falls, |Br|eaking |Ba|d ecc) but the story for me was a little confusing. Also, you gave an important part to Br Ba so why not make a song, i would like to hear what you can come up whit.
W song
Me listening to that song... wait... is that me?!
CG5 you are a legend of makeing songs keep up the good work cg5
top mejores crossovers
what
Today is a good day for me. New music from two of the artists I love
I still can't figure out what this is suppose to be about, make fun of me if you like but pls tell me what it is about :)
Nice animation you got CG5 for this 4GET song of a masterpiece.
This song was amazing! Hit it again CG5.  It kind of reminds me of my old friendship, id like to see more of this stuff on your channel.
NO WAY 1 HOUR AGO!
OMG THAT IS MY NEW FAV SONG
I feel so bad for people that struggle with anxiety like I guess I struggle with it a tiny bit but it’s only because my best friend basically hates me and not like anything that bad compared to other things. Also the whole thing was my fault because we were both friends with someone who I had a crush on and after she rejected me I got weird and it made both of them hate me
AaaaAAAH I love this song! It sounds very peppy and bright (from the melody-) and I instantly reated to the song in some way (where I'm not sure if it's good or not)  Anyways it's probably one of my favorit songs now :3 I wish everyone who might read this an amazing day!!!
L bozo imagine couldn't be me
There is a reference to Gravity Fall
The song and animation was amazing!
sad, I literally cried(no joke)D:
Aah my heart :,) beautiful ^_^
This is an amazing video I assume it's supposed to be a metaphor for your own problems with like anxiety or something like that but I could be wrong amazing regardless of what it's about
CG5 out with another amazing song. He never fails to impress us
I LOVE it just today I couldn't get the song out of my head
You are the most UNDERRATED singer I have ever seen don't understand the animation but still cool
Honestly this is wonderful and unbelievably epic. The song in my opinion is about lonelyness and friendship the guy finds a friend in the happy orb. 1:31 ALL THE SILENCE IS GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER really speak to me and since it school holiday the silence is possibly gonna get louder and louder
This was beautiful. The animation was engaging and so sweet and the music was so good!!!
That's awesome bro
This was so amazing- as soon as it started I was on the edge of my seat and man, did it hit home. Accidentally burned my food, but so worth it ❤
Nice song. Nice animation. I don't get it but it's nice.
This song slaps I'm gonna see if it's on spotify
I love it! Huge tnx to the team.
everything about this is incredible! The visuals, the lyrics, just everything- woah This is perfect explanation of- sorry I don’t know how to put it into words- anxiety involving revolving around moving on from relationships n stuff I think? anxiety really sucks, hope you’re doing well ^^
Oh. My. God. THIS IS WONDERFUL!
On “You think it’ll get better but it never does,” I can’t stop thinking of Michael Jackson!😂
💔💔💔felt💔💔💔
waltuh
You know I think I should forget about it
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Gravity Falls 2:18  Lets go! 😎
While listening to the song It gave a strange familiar feeling and I couldn't figure out why. Until I read the full story behind the song and it instantly hit me because of my own experiences with my anxiety. And every time I listen to it the feelings are hitting deep
Aaaaaa I love the references to other fandoms! The art: fantastic! The music: amazing! The vocals: awesome!! I love this song so much 💜💜💜
The song itself was 🔥🔥🔥 for real. That Walter White meme though! 😂
Thank you for the backstory to this song. I read though it and wow, I can heavily relate to everything this song means. It’s a topic that not everyone is comfortable sharing but we all go through it and this video is perfect for showing that
+1 FOR THE BILL CYTHER ART ON THE WALLS:")) GREAT SONG!1!1
🔥
THE GRAVITY FALLS REFERENCES ARE PERFECTION
Love the Easter eggs :D
W O W
abit confusing of the story lol
You can't forget things entirely
this was sooooooo cool  Thank you so much, CG5, TLT, and Or3o, and all the artists and animators is amazing to see this
wonderfuly amazing
This is so good cg5!! Everyone did so well with the music and the vocals! It's so different and special in its own way and I love it ☺️

YEAH
I literally just noticed the among us at 00:03
Great song
🥲👏👏👏
This is a great song. I read the backstory and I can't say I relate but I've had similar experiences.
This is absolutely incredible! ❤
WALTER WHITE!

This was so amazing! Probably one of my new favourite songs from you!

Waltuh
this song was so dark
Oh no my happiness it's broken
I actually just cried what sorcery is this
Loved the animation
Damn the amongus in the alleyway on the 71st frame is such an artistic touch
I really impressed with CG5 he’s showing all of his talent and I think OR3O did a good job as well!
I love how immediately after the lil creature died everyone in live chat started crying (me included)
There are SO many references and it's AMAZING. The animation, the vocals. BRO ❤
Why is this song good but it is also sad
Loved this, incredible animation! The Minecraft and Gravity Falls referances were some of my favorite parts.
Это шедевр который дошел даже до русских ..

My three favorite singers I am very happy
It's already in my playlist, what a BANGER!
This is so amazing!!! I love it!!!

CG5, or3o, what more could ask for ? I'm so happyyyyyy!
It's like his life was splashed with the colors of animation, Awsome!
Wait, I WASN’T PREPARED! WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME TO BE PREPARED FOR FEBRUARY 10TH?!?!
Amazing job, I'm just glad to see a lot more creators that actually care and work hard, God bless
silence get louder scene was accurate af

The vocals, the animation, everything was perfect. Charlie, I loved this song so much, it actually expresses personality that people can relate to.
Remember lads,  "Out of sight, out of mind"
TOO MANY REFERENCES
WALTUH
I went from happy, sad, even more sad, and now depressed. So Much EMOTIONS in ME Right Now! Such a good song!
Love it!!!❤❤❤❤
Yooo…this animation is so smooth! And incudes a lot of references on films, shows and singers that make covers on YouTube. Just incredible and really emotional…

Ayo finally early
Oml the techno art on the wall at at 1:54 <33 In all srsness tho, this song is literally amazing, keep being great charlie!
This is already in my playlist, everything about this song is amazing from the art, composition and to the incredible vocals! Everyone who was involved did an amazing job!
OMG ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
NOW THAT was...... Almost a great animation but it was sad when I felt like everything hurt. But I still have a sadness to keep a reason live with happiness.
0:03 jellybean on a poll
Omori
LOVED IT!!! The animation is so sick!
what a banger
The animation is incredible! Keep up the great work! 💙🧡
Man this is the best yet. I feel so emotional about this. I love how inspirational or even emotional your music can make someone feel. I wish for the music to bring joy to others as it has brought joy to me.
FINALLY, god I've been waiting for this one and I'm only 58 minutes later! Well done man, keep up the amazing work. I think I can speak for everyone else when I say we hope you're doing great. :).
I CRIED SO HARD WITH THIS!!! THOSE 2 MINUTES FELT LIKE A WHOLE 2 HOUR MOVIE!!! 😭😭😭 CG5 I just want to let u know what you made me smile today! This is Amazing! 😫😭
Im so confused and intrigued
BEFORE AN HOUR LETS GO
Bro! This song is sooo much better then I thought it would be,and I originally thought it would be amazing! My 2 favorite music makers. (Also love the gravity falls reference)
i can see the Amoung us in the back
walther
HOW AM I EARLY, I FORGOT ABOUT THIS
THIS IS SOO GOOD!
ROUND OF APPLAUSE YES GOOD GREAT AMAZING
As someone with Anxiety and ADHD, I was really hit by this song on a personal level. relating to this so much, it's scary XD good job, love your music!
The song is wonderful. Maybe Or3o's verse feels a bit too auto-tuned but aside from that is great. Shocked by how good this looks too. The animations with the little ball boi look so bouncy and alive. Love how it turned out overall. Also Kirby and his little eldritch horror in the background.
Love this song,I mean the music,the art it's so good
W mans
these two are gold on there own but together there gods
why does this hit different it gives you so much feelings
The song sounds great thanks cg5 for this song on my birthday
CG5, The Living Tombstone, And OR3O by themselves are all amazing but having ALL THREE MAKES A MASTERPIECE
dont mind me just cosplaying as a water fall
0:03 NO MATTER WHERE I GO NO MATTER WHERE I HIDE YOUR ALWAYS THERE...        WHY WONT YOU LEAVE ME ALONE
Me trying to 4get all the things from the past and move on

Another banger 🤩, I can only thank yall for doing this, it' amazing how many artists appear in the animation. Really cool detail. :D
This song made me add it to spotify quicker than i ever did
1:53 Technoblade <3
I SEEN METTATON
I love the song and it made me cry at the end
One of the best songs in my opinion
YEEEAAHAHAHAHAHAH I OOVE IT
This is definitely a song that I will literally listen to everyday
This was incredible to watch and listen to! I dont know why I got so emotional listening to this. Love all your music!
bro did not combine 3 of my fav video game singers toghether I FEEL BLESSED
CG my guy you have a award winning movie and song right there
or3o, cg5 and tlt?  sheesh that’s a pack
These people are legends
0:25 I like how Metatton has Metatton legs.
My omlet,s 😓
Yall this was so so so good I am immediately in love with this song ahhhh well done!
*I'm logging this comment in at 32 minutes since the premiere rap up/video start.* By this point: I've listened to the song multiple times, - tried to spot cameos 8 different times (before I checked the Description) - watched the video several times - tried to process the story 6 times - cried four or five times - turned it up 3 times - read the lyrics twice over - and enjoyed the whole thing altogether. Wow, just wow. Thank. You.
El estilo de la animación me encanta es realmente sublime 40/10✨💞✨💐💝
4get? Dementia music?
That was really good man!! So catchy and smooth
bro the amount of references in this is great I saw chickens, Glamrock Freddy, Lancer, Metaton, Journal 3 and soo many more this had so many great called backs and sounded great it's self, I remember CG5 from awhile back there was no colabs then now he's colabing with The Living Tombstone the biggest people in FNaF music and really big in other topics, just crazy.
I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THIS, CHARLIE!!!♡♡♡ I ADORE YOUR MUSIC, I LOVE U SM BRO!
This is one of the only times a song actually gave me chills, litteral CHILLS down my spine, great job to the entire team!
I actually crying
LOVE IT
Banger lol
YESSSSSS This IS what I needed on a Friday. Shame it’s released when I’ve lost my voice but that’s life. As soon as I have my voice back, I’m learning this song until ik all the lyrics cause I’m OBSESSED with this alreadyyyyyyyyy
so cool song. Great job on this. I liked the animation!
It was a really  lovely  song CG5,like your other songs,and remember we love you,take care and stay safe and again we all love you!
I feel like it was supposed to be an emotional rollercoaster with the lyrics and music video, but the actual music seems to be to fun and to stable, so it's more like a ride in a suspiciously slow and stable cart, through a tunnel filled with pictures that tell a story, that you can't really understand without a context, so you're just sitting there too confused to feel anything. From this point you have two options. Either you get caught up in solving what's the deeper meaning in all this, so you end up spending too much time overthinking and come to some crazy conclusions, that might, but probably aren't true, OR you choose to ignore the hidden meaning, and just enjoy the ride while staying perfectly sane during it and after it ends.  ...  So yeah, I think the video was great overall👍, the creators deserve a huge round of applause👏, and my therapist will probably deserve a raise after our next session 😅
THIS IS A BANGER!!!! IVE BEEN LISTENING TO IT 4 TIMES ALREADY!!! i love it
THIS WAS SICK!!!!! You guys are all so extremely talented!🖤🤍🖤
The same day my milk expired😂
kinda reminds me of owl house
This is the year of CG5 I can already tell. This song just feels so different from what we've seen and heard before. Everyone did amazing on this and the animation is on point! Keep it up and remember to stay hydrated.
love the gravity falls reference!
0:03 IS THAT 8-BITRYAN
👍
Bro i got home first thing i do is click on this and the next moment you know i am obsessed with the song.
my emotional support sphere is the moon
I'm not the only one that saw the among us at the beginning
I was completely blown away by the animation, graffiti art, and song. It's phenomenal work, and nothing less. All of the cameos and references to your interests, passions, pop culture, and past music was just the cherry on top of it all! I can't even imagine how many hours were poured into the making this music video over the past year. You and the team absolutely killed it.  From my initial watch during the premiere, I wasn't entirely sure what the song was about, yet I could tell there was some deeper meaning. Upon reading about the full story in the description and watching the music video for the second time, it all made so much more sense. I'm happy to hear that you are recovering well and continuing to grow stronger through rough experiences, as well as regaining that spark for doing what you love. Never stop creating, CG5 💙
Remember, Cg5's dream always was to do a collab with The Living of Tombstone, congratulations!!! You did, u are a legend.
Nice song (adding to Spotify playlist)
This is  best song
:O
I mean death
Hi I love the bad guy song
Not to ruin the angst moment but I spotted metatton in the background in 1:27
Omg straight to the playlist ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️luv ur songs!!!!
This was Amazing. Song sounds so good and the animation is super cool. GOOD JOB TO EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON THIS. :)
GABRIEL 0: 0:14 - 1:56
0:03 AMONG US SUSS
Bro the Kahoot music in the background makes my day
man there are enough gravity falls references to kill a man
*Walter white lol* 0:57
I’m tired
Now this is what I call a masterpiece 👏
god that did not feel like three minutes lmao
Someone think cg5  the living thombstone and 0R30 made the best song in YouTube now? Because this is really a piece of art
I'm far more apathetic than many of my family, but even my anxiety is enough to take me down at times. Mine isn't the same as yours, but this song did hit pretty hard for me.
What does the yellow orb represent? Happiness? I'm trying to understand the story and this is what I got. This guy has fallen in some sort of depression and hoping that he'll just "forget about it", but overtime he gets more and more depressed and the yellow floaty thingy gets smaller since he's getting less happy and just forgetting about it isn't working. In the end he dug himself too deep. I hope this is right, correct me if I'm wrong.
That was amazing to the vocals and the animations its sooo goood
>0< This is the best!!! The story! The animation! The song itself!!! I found my new favorite anything. ^-^
I'm adding this on my like
LETS GOOOO
Bro the music is fire 🔥🔥🔥 The beat reminds me of Kahoot music, and the dolingo music you did. And the animation is so cool!!! And bonus, it made my day CG5 :)
2:09  noo orb
maybe i will just  4get about it
Hold on, can someone explain to me what just happened?
love all the easter eggs (like gravity falls)
This one of my other favorites song by cg5 so far besides ok Friday and how’d you hear me and I listening to that song before we went to a hotel for marching season and it was my first year in marching and it gave me the will to play my best
2:20 gravity falls song next???
Now i get why you would not stop bothering us! It looks so good and searching for all the references is so fun, loved the song too
at school rn, I'll watch it later 2/10/2023
this is epic awsome singing and lyrcis and the animation is great well done on this one congrats
WHOAH! Great collab man! This song slaps! Great job like always, you never fail to entertain!! :] ❤
s tier collab
Wow. You know it’s gonna be a good quality song when there’s a very high quality animation with it, an actual band, another YouTuber collaborating, and a good story! Keep up the good work Charlie!
4GET
If you hear two names: CG5 & TLT, you know this will be fire.
Man you're making songs that are literally the beat
That part at 0:06 is so satisfying aaaaah  Amazing work everyone, this song is sooo great!!!!!!
Yo!?
This is way too good to only be 2 minutes long
wow. just wow. i am blown away by all the talent and work put into this. the song hits hard and the animation is outstanding. the story was well-crafted and overall definitely worth the wait- this is now my fav song! ive been a fan of cg5's music for about 5 years now and its amazing to see how far you and your music has come, great job to cg5 and everyone who worked on this! keep up the good work :) (i also liked the easter eggs in the background lol)
Just what I was waiting for. Well done Charlie!
I didnt forget
Fun Fact: If The Video Seems Shorter That Means You Enjoyed It (same thing that happened to me)
This is the most best song I’ve head on CG5
Man, Bo en called. He wants his song back.
THIS IS A CERTIFIED ORIGINAL CLASSIC
No way breaking bad reference?🗿
#4GET
Best sound ive evry heard
Ahhh this is SUCH an amazing song! Hits me in the feels, good job you three! I absolutely love the references to other YouTubers and characters! I squealed every time I noticed something, but I gotta say, I really felt that ending..🥲💙 Very Beautiful.
0:56 the breaking bad reference just makes it 100000 times better
im no crying for a little light thing, you are
3 artist in one, perfect!
wow this animation is beautiful!! and so sad!! aaaa i love all the references to creators and media tho!! i love this song and video so much :D
so many things in the background to look at especially mettatons legs
It's so beautiful
We can all agree that CG5 makes amazing music
Right on my birthday aswell!
Love the song and graphics! You worked so hard and it really shows, we love you CG5, OR30 and TLT ❤
All the Eeaster eggs and little references were amazing
that was it? I NEED MORE THAT WAS AMAZING
Look i did not 4get
Now one the song is freaking amazing, but also THE ANIMATION IS SO BEAUTIFUL LIKE THE ART STYLE THE STORYLINE kudos to all of you. It’s amazing
ITS HEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2:19 that journal brought back a lot of memories
The hell
Maybe I'll for-get a-bout it 🙂
Hey how you- (Up And Down Music Sound) I Hate My Entire Lif-
W
Hi cg5
.....this vid is just perfect... the animation, the harmony, the beat, the song, everything 💖 Hi Cg, I'm back from this phase again, and I'm glad I was able to listen to this masterpiece <333 Well done everybody
The end almost made me cry I cabt
This was so good and every aspect of the song is amazing! The vocals, animation, and actual song. Im never gonna 4get about this song :)
Cool song
Not only was this an absolute bop, but I think the video made me cry. The raw emotion in it got to me, oh my god
breaking bad
well this is an intresting birthday gift
Watching and listening to 4GET really confused me at first. I couldn’t find what specifically stuck with me about it. Was it the melody? Was it the visuals done by Kappapon? Was it the cameos of CG5’s friends, past collaborators, and influences? I couldn’t pinpoint what it was that made this video resonate with me. So when I was lost, I turned to the description and comments, saw that apparently there was a story, and I chose to read it. I learned that I relate a lot more to Charlie than I realized. I knew that we both were on the Autism Spectrum from an interview he was a part of (and then released on YouTube) but I always thought that was the baseline. I constantly am thinking, overthinking, and then OVER overthinking to the point of breaking down, I can’t control my emotions, and I can’t do the things I love because of something I don’t know whether or not I can control.  I had finally found *why* I love this video and song, and I’m glad I know why.
MISTA WHITE!!!!!
yessir!!
this is FIRE
I LOVED THE ANIMATION, AND THE STORY WAS TOP NOTCH I was waiting for this for 10 days but it felt forever, the wait was worth it, truly, charlie, you have made my day, and I just want to say, thank you!
I relate to this a bit too well ;-;
Damn is that good🤘
Cool animation! ✨
Three legends in one song. The entire holy trinity has joined one another.
The amount of nostalgia that was put into one video is in insane to me, everyone did an amazing job on this <3
Nice
This song is a banger
Am I the only one who saw DHeusta in the background at 0:05
This turned out so good! <3
33 minutes late😔
Because of the sneak-peak I thought it's gonna be about "haha university bad, people learning stupid"  But now I'M FEELING LIKE DYING the character is so relatable and made me feel a lot about how I treat people because of my mental problems ;-; I will try to get better, thank you Charlie ♥

ftg
As a person with anxiety It really hit home for me and I want to thank you for this amazing audio also loved the song and animation keep up the splendid work
If you pause at 0:23 you can see all of the picture that he has painted are easter eggs to the songs that CG5 has made in the past.
Finally... My three favorite artits collabing together, I can finally die in peace,.
oh wow
Tbh looks like neko from oneshot.
Just finished watching it! I ABSOLUTETLY LOVED IT! thanks cg5! (and tlt, and or3o) 🤗 🤗
these songs are so similar to each other
That's the song about a person you know, you loved, and when you had something bad, had to much problems you really starting to hate him tho he's trying to help you, and in the end when you try to reborn you're friendship with this person, it's too late. And the only that's left for you is to forget about it and move on.
im early
Markiplier has been spotted
У меня проблемы очень большие проблемы… я в этом персонаже вижу Ranboo без очков и маски. Что с мои восприятием? 😭   Мне ОЧЕНЬ понравилось это так ммм просто шик 💘😭💘💘💘
this sent me on a emotional rollercoaster i love thank you cg5 or30 and livingtombstone
:O
Gosh I Adore this animtions and the song hits a bit for me..great job to everyone on this🙌✨🙌✨🌺🌸💖
another banger
I'm not 4get this song!
I love the animation! In the beginning you can see some of the minecraft players and other singers that cg5 collab with.
i liked the song cg5 its cool
W song
I absolutely love this, CG 😭 You, OR3O, and The Living Tombstone did so well on this song that y’all hand-crafted the bat, manufactured the ball from scratch, and hit that thing right past the stratosphere 😤👌 On a more serious note, the melodies are fantastically unique, and the song’s theme can also be seen as EXTREMELY relatable; I (along with all these wonderful fans in the comments, I’m sure) appreciate and cherish this collaboration immensely for these reasons and many others :D You continue to assume the spot of my top artist on Spotify and my favorite musician of all time; I usually don’t comment very often, but I wanted to make sure I paid my respects :)  Also,   *I* 👏 *LOVE* 👏 *THE* 👏 *REFERENCES* 👏  Keep striving for the stars, Mister Green >:P
This song is truly amazing. Especially when you have two great song artists combing into one (or more combing into 1). Love the video too. *:)*
Breaking bad
I didn’t listen to the music but the animation looks AMAZING!
Cg5 + the living tombstone = amazing crossover song ever
Awesome
Too short. So much awesome harmony. So beautiful what many people can do when they come together. This is something I won’t 4GET about!!❤❤
Within hour
1:16 anyone else see Mettaton?
amazing
You should do My ordinary life I'd die to see that dude these are amazing
I saw so many creators like 8-Bitryan, Markiplier and so much more. Really great video as always
I love this song already!!!
that was so good, as expected of a dream team like this =)
w-why did It feel so strictly towards me? hehe, maybe just me? lol
The song is amazing so does the animation. (The animation almost made me cry pls help)
This is amazing! So many character and creator references and it looks so vibrant and charming!
I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE SONG ORIGIN/FANDOM OR WHATEVER BUT THIS IS FUCKIN POGGERS
man, I LOVE THIS ART STYLE. AND THE ANIMATION IS IMMACULATE
There’s so many references to shows and games and all the other creatures that my mind can’t process it and it’s about to explode
I wish you added eddsworld but you did add gravity Falls
hmmm... Maybe don't forget about it? HMMMMM? MAYBE DON'T SHOW PPL SCHIZOPHRENIA HMMMMMM???
I dont even understand what I Just watched but uh it sounded fun :P (feels like an acid trip)
when i tell you, THE EXCITMENT I GOT WHEN I SEEN DSMP MEMBERS
yoooo finally it's out!! a vibe as always, I'm not sure what else I would've expected lol-
Sorry that I'm late! But this is immediately going on my playlist
Jeez this animation made me more emotional than I imagined, also the song hits close to home as well, after going through a lot, at some point I just started pushing everything down and out and tried to forget all the bad times, even though with that I also forget all the good moments too, life is full of lots highs and even more lows but with each day that passes, no matter how bad it is, there’s always a chance for a new and better tomorrow.   Also love all the references to other creators in the beginning it’s like a lil Easter egg hunt.
Bill Cipher!
Am I the only one who noticed bill cipher
Оооо
After noticing the Techno tribute in the graffiti I started looking at all the other paintings scattered around. They're all beautiful and every single one made my smile wider!
That...was...AWESOME!!!!!!
0:24  love this bit shows  many songs from the past
1:54 TECHNOBLADE
"Oh, boy! I found some good music, time to Listen to it!" My mom with the blender: *Are you sure about that?*
another day another slay
This is so well done! Great work everyone!
I am LIVING for this art style and the song is better than I ever could have imagined. Great work as always!
This is amazing good symbolism
nice
"am dying" relatable but this is literally my tech against sadness just forget about it. it works...until it doesn't but i have an extremely bad memories soo it works again in a few hours-day
A perfect collab to exist on making a perfect song, well done CG5, you're the best
This is absolutely amazing. I can't even put into words right now. It's just amazing. Just legendary. You did awesome Charlie, keep it up and doing what makes you happy. Your music helps so many, including me in so many ways and thank you! I wish you the best of luck at your performance today!! 💚🎉
Sorry, the Living Tombstone, CG5 and OR3O!? Of course I’m exited 😭
The Living Tombstone, CG5, and OR3O?! Is this a dream?
Am I the only one crying?
I LOVE ALL THE EASTER EGGS
I loved the song..but the Music Video was not what I was expecting..regardless it was cool..the ending scene screwed me up a little..that just made me sad 😢
0:22 I see a Show Yourself Lyin 2 Me Good To Be Alive I see a dreamer Why did the chicken cross the road the final straw and phantom dancing reference Speed in my soul dear Calypsos
The songs great n all but I can’t get over that lil orb guy
JESSE
DAWG. THIS IS FRICKING AWESOME I LOVE THE SONG AND THE ART!!!!
You could replace the orb with drugs and still have the story make sense
Bro I have been watching your vids for 3-4 years now And this is one of the best. Keep up the good work!
I need a movie to this
You make god music
0:13 u csn see Bill Cipher
why is there an among us character hidden at 0:03?
How am I this early?!?
Lol the Walter white thing lol
Love the “world of grey” reference to a previous song, both are absolute favorites!
tiny lil' guy oofs                ME: NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
0:09 I just realized CHARLIE AND OR3O ARE THE ONES ON STAGE also I couldn’t tell if Charlie was screaming laughing or literally wailing cries 😂 I think laughing but idk
No wonder why you were so exited to show us this project. It was a Legendary masterpiece. Were all so proud of you charlie and everyone elso who was a part of it. keep up the amazing work.
Cg5 makes great songs
Yo this song is fireeee
yessss awesome
This is sick!!
CG5! if you look in almost every music video of  yours youll see  my comment talking about how good your stile and musics videos are awesome! BUT this time i have to admit, i was expecting more 😕 maybe i was expecting a little more. but if your reading this, CG5 I LOVE YOU! You actually make my life better! Thank You CG5!
That was SO GOOD!!!
Tlt is losing it's touch
Haven’t even seen it yet and I already know my eardrums will be blessed.
This is a bop, very chill as well! I am surprised how well he made this Music Video!
the lore goes hard
I'm behind on news, but this was a banger and I'm so curious about everything.
Amazing!! Cg5 never disappoints!
Words can't describe how beautiful this was!😧🥺  The beautiful animation, the great characters, the lore and story in the music video, and the really catchy beat! Great job, guys!  Now this is a bop I'll never 4GET!
Love getting to see a different side of you put to music. Sometimes us music listeners overlook what a song actually is trying to say, getting caught up in the instrumental or how it sounds. This was a perfect way to get something off your chest and overcome it.
Can't wait to see what cg5 dose next
This was amazing! i really like the animation style. ITs also really col you were able to get a collab like this! i can tell this will be stuck in my head
Ya know someone's good when it's 19 minutes ago and already 1.2k comments
THE collab
0:58 waltuh dying
Man, Cg5 really is something else.  He goes out of his way to collaborate with other awesome creators and somehow managed to always increase in quality.
Want a fun drinking game? Take a shot for every reference in this song.           Still alive?
Waltuh whi 💀💀💀
I like the vibe of this song.😌

The old is dead and the new has been born. Seeing New horizons from a dark place

This song was catchy and awesome you all did great on this
I LOVE this song, like every other song of yours!  By the way, Kahoot theme approves
I actually cried when the music video finished. I can't even find the words right now to tell you all the ways this song singlehandedly got me through today. Watching the video was an amazing way to start the weekend. Thank you Charlie for this amazing song! I can't wait for more of your unbeatable talent soon. :)
Always nice when cg makes on big high quality song, while sometimes the quick ones like minion are good, if the song is good and cg isn’t mass producing and burning out, it’s sick
Absolutely amazing! Gonna be listening on repeat for a bit lol
That was a good vid, i cant believe i was in the chat
What?
Lol
This song literally is me. I love how I can related to most of your songs Charlie ❤️ thanks for helping me! Next time I should just listen to thins song and 4get about it 😊
Am i the only one who saw Markiplier
Amazing! Best one YET wow
This is fantastic!  (Everytime I see a Gravity Falls reference i wanna hug a personified version of this video)
Sorry I missed it Charlie I was at school 😔 I love this though!
AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I need lore  Surely this has something secret
How come the living tombstone didn’t sing?? Or he just the artist
17 minutes ago I DIDNT FORGET
There’s a lot of references in this, like something, bill, mettaton, and others
yooo
This was pretty good. I am going to sleep so this was a pretty good goodnight song I guess. Thanks.

amaZINNGGGG
I know CG5 really well and I think he could do it a little bit better, but still this song is the banger that all we needed!
This is amazing
I didn't even really get it but it was really good and fun
Everything about this music video is awesome, the animation, the music, the lyrics. This song is definitely one of my top 3 favorite.
0:02 SOMETHING

Hermoso!
i havent heard anything regarding TLT in a while, i guess hes been putting his everything into this collab
𝕎𝕖𝕝𝕝 𝕘𝕦𝕖𝕤𝕤 𝕀'𝕞 𝕜𝕚𝕟𝕕𝕒 𝕖𝕒𝕣𝕝𝕪??
Dang. The music video looks good as hell.
I love how upbeat this is!
i have no comment  i jus love your songs

sounds similar to the kahoot theme song
Another banger as always
Honestly,i think that the ester eggs are the best part of the song.i noticed alot of details like Dream,the Minecraft logo,Mettaton and Frisk,Cuphead,Luigi's Mansion,Kirby,Bill Cipher,Gravity Falls book,Among Us,BBH,a pig,some axolotls,Tommy,Or3o,CG5 and others of course.I LOVED searching these little details.i ABSOLUTELY LOVE the instrumentals and the song itself is so original and different... you guys made such an exceptionally great job,don't give up!!❤️

Oh my god it’s beautiful
This fnaf music video looks sick
CG5 X TLT!!! MY CHILDHOOD MUSIC ARTISTS?!?
0:03 hey that's 8-bit Ryan in there, thanks for adding him to the video!
i 4got, sorry
This is one of the greatest songs I've heard in my life, it has everything, excellent vocals, and excellent production, I almost cried while hearing this because I couldn't think of anything but of how great this song is and the fact that I could relate in some degree with the lyrics (that are beautiful and sad)  Truly one of CG5's best masterpieces, I love it <333333
Dude this was awesome I loved listening to it on Spotify and I won't 4GET this video ever!!! Awesome job to everyone who worked on this!!!
QUE LINDA CANCION TA BIEN EL VIDEO WOooOOoO CADA VES ME IMPRECIONA MAS JAJA  as una cancion DE ROBLOx  YO SE QUE TE QUEDARA MUY BIEN COMO TODAS LAS QUE AS ECHO saludos desde EL SALVADOR jaja
Noice 😙👌
Every time I look at the moon, I'll think of the little light boy
Words can not describe how much I love this. The song is so good, and the animation is amazing! This was a collab I did not expect, but really needed
Ngl it's sad
This is absolutely amazing and worth the wait, probably one of my favorite songs you've made! Congrats on another job well done, and I can't wait to see what you come up with in the future! I've already ordered my tshirt, can't wait for it to get here!!! Also, am I the only one who cried a bit 👀
It's soo good. It's just sad that it's so short. Very well done, very well done indeed.
Hydropunk
I was scrolling through TLT's Spotify earlier today, and I was like "Wait, I didn't know CG5 collabed with TLT again?" then this drops.
noice
happy music sad background
THIS IS EPIC!!!! The animation, the song is 🔥 keep it up!
This song is moood
amazing
This is AMAZING!!!! Wonderful work guys!
It’s amazing I love it.
Why do the originals always slap 😭👌 (Gotta love walter white too)
Omg, the 3 people that made my childhood (and part of my teenage years) collabed! This was an amazing song, and I love the amount of references in the video!
The collab we needed doesnt exi-
that was deep
Another hit song by a poggers creater.
Such a banger
This is literally amazing I love the visuals art style lyrics everything.
THIS IS A BANGER!!!! Won’t 4GET this  for a while! ❤❤❤
It’s so good I’m glad I was there for the premiere
Bro, this is actually making me cry.
This is such a bagger dude I have to say you guys did the best job at making this song I will never 4get this! ❤
OMG THE CHARACTERS FROM CLICKER AT 0:05
Omg!! SO AMAZING GREAT JOB!!
COOOL
Absolutely amazing song!!! Was so worth the wait!!
1:00 WALTUH WE NEED TO COOK
This is sick!!!
This is awesome! But I gotta ask, what’s up with all of the Gravity Falls references?
Starting the year of with just Masterpiece after MASTERPIECE!!!
Amazing you guys did a fantastic job gg
Immediately my favorite song
👌🏻
IT WAS JUST SUCH A BANGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Three people I use to listen in one song, damn
This must have taken a year or so 👍
yo CG5, i think you should make a fnf song!
THAT WAS SO SLAYYY but to be honest, this song really resonated with me. I personally think this song is about denying your declining mental health until its too late, and I can really relate to that. The animation was so smooth, the character design was adorable and the backgrounds were amazing! Such a successful collab, great job to everyone who worked on it! (Edit: I just read the pdf about the actual meaning, which was really sad. Just know that this was my own interpretation of the song.)
I love this song, it so emotional. I’ll always 4get about my misery. Thanks for the song. I love the collab. The animation, I can’t explain how great it was
mis 3 artistas favoritos haciendo un collab?,dios que magnifico
My ears were deaf for my whole life. Then, I played this song. I can hear now, thank you CG5,TFT and Or3o.
Yaaaaay
omg
I just read the meaning behind the song and it’s incredible. Plus- A YEAR ON ANIMATION ALONE- that is absolutely insane and it absolutely paid off. CG5, thank you so much for sharing your talent, this song is such a banger and the lyrics hit hard
This is so good
That was awesome
5 mil in 2 weeks
Awesome song. I don't understand what it's really about but it's a great beat and the lyrics are amazing :)
Great song, love all the references in the graffiti!
So many youtubers, Markiplier, Tommyinit, BadboyHalo, Wilber, Sapnap (it looks like), DAGames, 8-Bit Ryan, Jellybean, DHeusta, and so much more references to memes, tv shows, movies, what a great song as well!
Wown the song is amazing!! GG to everyone! And the animation is very cool, with a lot of easter eggs!! <333
all of the gravity falls references in this video and even some of the teaser pictures for this song really make me think he has smth gravity falls themed planed
Every reference (meme) on this song:  0:13 Bill Cipher (i think) and Garfield 0:17 Parappa the Rapper 0:19 Kirby 0:22 Glamrock Freddy, Sonic, red from Amogus, Luigi's Mansion, that character from Deltarune but i don't remember the name, the axolotl from Minecraft and Cuphead  0:25 Undertale and the Book from Gravity Falls 0:58 Breaking Bad 1:23 Yippy 1:34 Sussy Face  Tell me on the comments that of i missed something
YESSIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR   EXCITED      LETS GO       I SUCK AT COMMENTING I DONT CARE THAT I SUCK AT COMMENTING          ERY EXCITED
10/10
I already heard the song in a leaked video, but yet this is peak. thank you for being there for the community & bringing smiles to all our faces charlie green!

Watching this in the premiere was an honor and the entire song and animation was amazing. Thank you so much Charlie. I can already tell 2023 is going to be 1000x better than 2022. Thank you and have an awesome rest of your day/night!
Wooooow i love it ✨✨✨✨✨ Bravo and good job 👌👌👌👌👌
Moral of the Story: Keep on moving forward. don't stop following your dreams. You can do this!
His was crazy
My interpretation of the song is when you find something happy but then as time goes on, you feel more and more depressed to the point where you either kill yourself or you go into this intense breakdown. But there's a light at the end of its tunnel! Please take care of yourselves!
Loved the video CG5 it was so fire🔥🔥🔥
This isn’t just a banger song! This is a masterpiece on so many different levels! From all the different references, to the stunning visuals and the beautiful story and message! I love this so much! Thank you for this amazing work of art!
Omg, this song, this animation, this is absolutely stunning!! 🤩🤩
This song was a BANGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg

hmm... I think ima gonna remember it :)
This was so good! great work CG5!
THIS SONG IS LIKE PERFECT FOR MY AUTISTIC BRAIN
This song had me crying but great job !! Loved the song :D
OK, where to actually begin? That bass. That beat. Those lyrics. They are CAPTIVATING!! The colour scheme is GLOWING. I don't think we could ever forget this, so I wouldn't worry. It was SO worth the wait. The Living Tombstone, OR3O and Charlie again? This is what im living for. One of my mates shattered my phone screen today so I'm gonna presume all the little details are poppin' too. LIKE PARAPPA AND FREDDY!!! Another hot track!! I'm addicted, confirmed. 🔥🔥🔥
YOOO THIS IS SOOOO GOOOD
I just... stayed pogchamp when the video was finished.
It’s so good, I love it! 💛✨
CG5's original and unique music *never* fails to make me snap my fingers and make me move my feet with glee!😎

DAAAAAANNNGGGGGGG That was amazing! Props to all the folks involved!
The work, time and effort put into this was incredible! Relationships can be tough and things don't always go to plan, but this song is a perfect explanation of that. I'm glad you're thriving. I can't even process that you and TLT have been working on this for over a year (aswell as the animators). I remember watching your vlog where you met up with TLT to work on music together and that you had been working on this. This was absolutely outstanding and I will definitely be putting this on repeat for a LONG time lol. Thank you once again Charlie and I wish you amazing luck at KamiCon tonight!! (Can't wait to watch the stream:])
I love this so damn much best song ever
At the intro on a graffiti… is Bill Cipher?

The animation is so smoooooth
Meth
My pet washing machine fell off a cliff  after seeing a pig have sex with a cow. I developed severe depression and was planning to do thirteen backflips off of the statue of liberty. But when my pet dryer told me about this it completely turned my life around. I have been eating eleven frogs a day instead of two, and my melted cat smoothie is now making me two dollars a second instead of a hundred dollars a second. I showed this to my tree and it grew human legs and flew away. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. When it was getting really cold outside I got my dog and threw it into the pool. It lived because of this and definitely not because the fbi agents that took my dog away. After years of eating wallpaper alone, this made me eat wallpaper with my bedside table. I can't believe my non-existent friends won't watch this with me. When the demon living in my shower told me I was acting sus, I showed it this and it ate my shower curtain. This is officially the best thing that ever happened to me and I recommend this for everyone and everything.

That was so good
THAT WAS SO COOL
THAT WAS SO COOL
This is sick!!!!!
Noo
Absolute banger bro
That ending was insane.
What is it about
Lets goo! Got to this at the last second before it started on premiere, this was amazing! Awesome artists, best collab! Felt so short but its almost 3 minutes!
🔥 as always
THIS. IS. AMAZING. It's so fun! It's so upbeat! Immediately added to my playlist! Like usual! Now, your regularly scheduled content:  Hey CG! Random question, if you were in a world where Super Heroes existed (Not, like, Doctors and whatnot, although they are Heroes 100%. People like Spider-Man), would you make songs about them knowing they existed? And if you did, would you do the same for the Villains?  Where did this question come from? It came from me listening to your Long Horse song while talking about Heroes with my friends, ha!  PS: I'm sending this to everything until CG5 replies!
The best animation on this channel.
In which theater is Breaking Bad playing in?
OMG
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes
the melody teleports me to a certain place very nice song
You know it's a good day when CG5 posts a new vid

OR3O... The Living Tombstone... CG5... Truly a masterpiece.
LETS GOO I HAVE IT ON MY PLAYLIST
Can’t wait, I can already tell that this is gonna be great!
Lyrics! I know they're in the description but some people like having them in the comments so here ya go:  Moving on, moving on, It doesn’t really matter, My brain follows a pattern. Forget about it. Breaking up, breaking down, You think it’ll get better, but it never does.  I feel like I’m dying. Nobody tells me I’m lying. Couldn’t hear when I was crying. It’s defeating when I’m trying To forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.  I’m spending every day, Wishing I was okay. Surrendered to a world of gray. Hey. My car is broken down, I can’t get out of town. So I’ll walk along a road of shame. Headache!  All my thoughts are getting scattered. Am I madder than a hatter? Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it. All the silence getting louder, And louder and louder. Maybe I’ll forget about it.
Give me but at 2:30
reply just do it
A yes
Ooh I can’t wait!
The hype on this song is unbelievable
Yo man I can't wait for this 😁✨

🤯
Hello from whatever today is lol
It's something we didn't want but something we needed
Make a oddball song
February 11 for me.
Relationships can be hard to express and go though and this was a very good way to display how you can get out of them. I am grateful that this song is a reminder  to me that things in this world are temporary and will fade away when God comes. In the end I and many others get to be with God eternally.
I guess the "don't forget about it" warnings for CG5 was worth it...but the graphics look promising
Hi cg5 I have a question does gc4 live in ohio?☠💀☠
