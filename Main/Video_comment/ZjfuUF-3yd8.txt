🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 SUNDERLAND AFC⚽⚽
you would look best with lighter brown. ashy. Kinda like lana rhoades before she was pregnant. You look like her a bit similar skin tone / eyes  and undertone.
That one time u accidentally made a transition
yes! your kitten looks like you♥ so cuuute
IT LOOKS SOOOO GOOD
The hair looks so lovely ❤
Olivia could pull off any colour hair 💜 she is stunning

Not gonna lie I miss the occasional big fart in your videos💨😂
Wow u look like Lana Rhoades in the thumbnail

You look much better brunette babe, same colour as my cousin Phil - blue eyed and dark haired. You'd suit anything.
Yassss Olivia
Looove it! Kind of look like Dani Mansutti now
Olivia PLEASE can i have the furniture you showed? The glass table/the mirror???? I have just bought a flat and have been looking for the perfect glass table ❤
Abrupt ending 😢
Her calling turkey chicken 😭😂
So this is what artificial intelligence looks like.

chestnut brown is the best
Omg yes can I please have the glass table!!😱😱
When u use a pic of her blonde hair for the hairdresser inspo to go blonde, but now she’s your natural dark hair anyway 😅
Your hair looks lovely
I could take the mirror off your hands pls X

I live in the US but I’d love that glass table!

olivia!!!! please use OLAPLEX your hair will go back to the way it was with each use , it completely fixes the damage in ur hair caused by bleach
Beans and no fart?😂 i am disappointed 😢
Not a fan of hair extensions, I feel like they look like dead hair 💔
NO BEANS ON TOAST?
Could I have the mirror please ?!🫣🫶🏽
I wanna go brunette now
You’re glowing even with no makeup with this hair colour :)
I saw u at Rosalía !!! I recognised the miu miu jumper a mile away
power move

Babe dnt worry bout ur drinking , go out enjoy urself u live once and only young once - make as many memories as possible.   U aint got a drinking problem etc so f it why hold urself back frm fun
I didn’t think you could get any prettier, but I was wrong😍
Olivia what happened to beans and avo on toast.
Olivia u look beautiful SHUT UP❤️
Omg!! YOU LOOK SO HAWT WITH DARK HAIR!!! We stand dark hair Olivia!!
I’ll take the desk and the mirror please, Olivia 😂
girl i’ll take the mirror if you’re offering lol x
Don’t use Clinique it’s not cruelty free
you need to try COOK food for frozen/microwave meals they the goals of the game
Why is your ex cleaning up shirtless 😂 as you do
OLIVIA, U LOOK ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS WITH THE BROWN HAIR !!! HOLY SHIT
The taxi driver listening to you talking about your ear wax👀
love it <3 but def was not expecting the video to end so abrupt ;'(
poppy moore moment and it slays, I love it sm
Clinique isnt vegan they test on animals😭i bought the same lipstick without realising
Ngl I think it’s sooo much nicer than the blonde ❤
that ad integration was unhinged
You look gorgeous both ways🤩🤩😍♥️
Is there an end to this video?
i‘m so confused… why wouldn’t you just make a vegan roast?
Olivia I got COVID 19 yesterday
You live in London - most supermarkets have an amazing vegan Christmas range 👌🏼 please don’t complain 🙃 I used to live in London and now that I’ve left I realise how spoilt for choice I was
Don’t recommend extensions… it makes your hair weak and SO expensive to upkeep
love the new hair! Clinique isn't cruelty free btw but there are several brands with similar products (Charlotte Tilbury, Glossier) that are x
the brown loooks so gooood!!!! olivia’s in her mysterious era
You didn’t put baked beans on ur breakfast, miss olivia are u okay? Xx
omg can i have the mirror lol will pay
klol
that ring is so cute but i just looked up the price annnd🥲🥲
I think this is the best decision you've made! The brown really just suits your face and makes your features pop :))
Where is the chairs around your dinner table from? They are so gorgeous!
hi Olivia!! love the hair btw 🎀 but if u like the Clinique black honey lippy then you'll def love the glossier generation g lipstick in shade like - I have and I absolutely love it so I thought id let u know to give it a go bc it lasts all day but looks so natural xx

As a vegan I could NEVER buy and bake a chicken 😭Why did you do thaaaatt
