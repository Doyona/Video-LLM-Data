Great job .. great videos
Great upgrades 👍
Hi Will, do you still use this method to heat water? I am looking at a hot water set up but seems like they still use a lot of power and take a long time to heat up? Thanks
11:28 🤣🤣🤣
Gave you a thumbs up for the music and the puppies. The installation was a great added bonus 😂
Hi, what pump are you using for  the hot water to the tap
11:32 You need a bateworld profile for the B-roll footage Terrific van build!
Your sence of humor makes these videos even greater. Keep it up, your awesome.
Think I would need a Neil too, we have no heating In our vw as yet, I do have a Geoff, my little bruv who helps me with most problems lol.
Love your videos keep up good. Job,R the little dog's yours,or Neil's?? Want see more puppies.😃😃😃😃😃👌👌👍👍
Love this van, proper class. No better feeling than new mods
great info and all the links are so helpful
Brilliant Will 👏
Hi wil any chance you could do a video on drones.... maybe recommend the cheapest one that is in fact any good... thanks bro.... keep up the good work
It's cool to get these projects working. One suggestion I would have that I have seen from other van builds is a small projector such as the Kodak Ultra Mini Portable Projector 75 which is rechargeable. Enjoying your build.
Are you  camping in  your  van right now
All you need now is a great wife that love what you do and join you on the road :D
On the overhead cupboard doors you can go to a decent timber yard and they will put the edging on the boards.
I have a sort of Day Van setup so went with a gas powered Camplux as its portable.
60° Boiling hot water… Ummmmm 🧐
Wow, that heater works better than i was expecting!! Van looks amazing! ... two of my mates went to adventure overland show, I wish I'd gone now and after I saw pics of overlanders were, didn't sound that cool when mate described it, lol... do a summer solstice at Stonehenge one day, they do charge for parking in their allocated lit up field but handy to have cooking/sleeping place with you.. tv btw is pronounced "Chello" like the musical instrument... See even Neil hasn't finished modifying his yet, lol..
What's the GMV of the van? Have you weighed it since all the additions?
Why can't they just boil kettle old fashioned way  Wills.. don't take the Lord's name in vain..you may really need him some day 🙄
Will I got scammed I thought u were going to send a sticker to me I gave my number to you but you said there are scammers..fukin ass holes
Have you got a rough idea of how much you've spent on the van fit out so far?
Next time ya in Liverpool give us a bell mate we'll go for a pint! I love what you've done with the van pal
What do you use to run your TV through.  Eg WiFi link etc for free view
Hey Will, Absolutely brilliant especially installing a new TV which will now be a Game changer, I would highly recommend you getting a Firestick, I think every Camper Van build needs a guy like Neil who is a great guy, who has helped you Achieve so much, it is just absolutely awesome Yes you will easily be able to live in your camper van through out the summer, as you got everything you need now!  I am looking forward to seeing your next video! 😊👏👍
Need a 19inch TV at least!
Brilliant  when  I went on my 1st Car camping trip  I used a portable power station  did d job nicely  next Car Camp 4 days in  South Wales!! Visiting Family!!
when are you coming to America
Hey will would love to have a chat can't find anywhere where I can chat with you privately  if there is let me know thanks
I have a 24inch smart tv in my truck use phone to get Internet ...Happy days...going to do same in my van.
60 degree boiling hot water.????
Looks great , does Neil do van builds for a living and has he got a channel I could  ask if he would fancy doing a Luton van build soon ?
Fantastic Will. Well done to you and Neil
Where the fuck did u find a 12 volt 12 inch smart tv!! Cant find them anywhere!
Add surround sound
"60 degree boiling hot water" 🤔  Van is looking amazing man, what you now have is the dream
Hey Will when are you and Wallace going on  your travels again those videos were funny
I love your honesty,
💙🇳🇵🇳🇵
I think actuators are nice, but a real waste of battery power. If the panels are light enough to raise by hand, I would skip the motors. Unless you have more than enough battery capacity that you won't ever have to worry about running low. My two cents. Sorry, pence. Lol
Nice one! It's all looking so functional! Can't wait to see you getting about and making use of it it all on a trip. 👍🏻 Do you think you might end up living #VanLife full time?
Great to have a TV. But, I think I would’ve got one of the largest iPad Pro’s and get a mount so I can put it on the wall. Computer and a decent screen in one. 🤙🏻 Excellent progress with the van build, Will!
Think it will will have to call this channel Will & Neil Do Up a Van channel lol
A Neil is what my van needs!
Where does the blown air go once it’s been through the heater matrix? Just wondered if that’s then vented anywhere or just heats up your garage?
2:40 Neil's reassuring explanation of how to assemble something is brilliant! XD
Awesome work guys
Recommend considering reviewing your Vehicle Insurance cover, as it'll be a bummer if a write off accident just pays out the value of a used builder's van ... !
10:12   Great use of oversize screws to impale the fingers of any burglars rifling through the cupboard ! What a super security feature ... 😂
Great job will 👍🏻👌😁😎🇬🇧
60 degree, boiling -  - nope
Great work! You both make some good content given me loads of ideas can’t wait to save enough to do my own van !
Awesome mate! What make TV is it? how big is it please
Good to hear the van is 100% finished now !!!  Cornwall sounds good look forward to seeing how you get on. Sennen Cove is good also Penberth but keep that quiet. They filmed scenes from Poldark there. Also the Minack theatre and Treverven Campsite is good been many times but not for a few years now. Happy travels.
have a bit of life...hope, catch a breather! appreciate Neil, Emma and Will!  edit- (also not forgetting to be healthy, strong, kind!)
Greetings, sir.  Absolutely fantastic update.  Thank you for sharing the latest installment.  Will your EDP be making the trip with you for the summer?  Remote work is all the rage, sir.  Wishing you well from Dracut Massachusetts.
Great video pal looking awsome 👍
🙂👍
Been here a fan since about the last year of the galaxy stayed to watch the van build to see the process is amazing its turned out brilliant 1 thing u should do is a rough estimate how much the whole thing cost for ppl like myself looking to try start this u gave me inspiration to try this well done will and u should be proud u came through wat looked like tough times u look happier I hope u are goodluck on the rest and can't wait to see wats nxt keep up the good work bud ❤
Was there a reason Neil was dressed as a bobble heater?  6:00 what a good sport! 😂🤣😂
that TV reminded me of that one ep from the office (US) when Michael Scott shows Jim & Pam his mounted plasma TV 😂💀
Hi Will, are you in redhill when filming videos. I just recognise the area as I’m at the college nearby
What have you done the rear floor with is it normal foam tiles ?
Bro u look like that guy from fast n furious Luke Evans lol
The water heater is awesome
Your van is looking sweet mate well done to you and Neil
Looks fantastic well done for getting it all completed
Hope you not leaving them screws inside your cupboard dude haha. Ps what make modal is tv do uou have a link 🤔
After all that time and effort and no one can afford to fill up their vehicles with fuel.
Now it's a perfect house on wheel.Waitimg for camping videos 😆😆
Fairplay will . Mint job . You have came a long way since the car park car camping  mate
Will, you could also get a PlayStation or Xbox to plug into the TV
The water heater should work first time unlike the first Chinese diesel heater
Niels been bloody fantastic helping you out in this Will,what a legend so glad she’s almost done,what a journey mate,MARY looks fkin fantastic
have the same bobil . absolutely a game changer will . I leave mine set at 45⁰ for showers out of back of van check out my instagram for more details
Hi very big well done on your van good job for keeping at it I know at times you were disharted but you keep going so be very proud of your self
Ffs Will how many heaters have you now had for one van I count 3 lol
Van looks great a comfy little home  but renovations are never done   it's fun though!
Now you need to get a sound bar for the tv  to get full entertainment 😁
Says he's not an instructions type of man, reads instructions anyway.  Don't say you're dumb while actually doing the smart thing :p
Great video, Should have purchased a Roku streaming stick. Lots of free films & free live tv
Good job Will....looks great x
“60 degree, boiling hot water”? Are you up a mountain?
Another great video buddy. In my Ducato self build( now sold ) I used a truma ultra store for the hot water and a 5kw Chinese diesel heater and both worked perfectly for the 2 years I owned it. Hot water= happy days 😉❤️
Is the GF coming back, I forget her name for some reason!
LOL last time I checked I had four fingers and two thumbs like the van bro it’s Gotta be time to see you on the road
if it was me l probably would have got a TV about twice the size
You’ll love Cornwall, I live here , plenty to see when’s it’s nice weather
love frm Nepal
Looking great Will, been watching you since your stealth camping in your car times and watching the van transform has been great, I know your feeling on DIY I'm not great either but your efforts shows it can be done..!! Eventually......lol.  Looking forward to following you around Cornwall.  Legend.
It`s looking good Will. I bet you end up getting a bigger Tv !!! 😀
My favourite videos you did in the pat was when you went camping and stealth camping in Dodgy scarey places, can you go back to doing some more of those now your vans pity much completed
IT'S NOT ROCKET SURGERY IS IT
Neil is a legend
Great upgrades but would have gone with a Google Chromecast instead of a NowTV stick. Can link to your laptop via it and use it as a second screen for editing, etc, and can still stream content from your phone or the laptop.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣OMG when you talked about watching TV in bed my 15 yr old son's face was classic
Great van , and quite an achievment , but what was the rough final price of the whole thing in the end including the van , Im keen to try something but not sure I can afford it
You're in the final strech of getting your tiny house !!!
Great build, quick question how to keep your self cold down during summer heat. ☀️
Enjoy your videos, keep up the great work.
Buddy. Swear to God you better post a video about the party of the van life guys. We all saw you on Adz Ventures video. So funny. We all saw you man. Where is Wallis? Come in mate!!!
Congrats Will
Nice job 👏 👍 beautiful van
I've been watching since you was in the galaxy miss the galaxy lol I'm a big fan will keep up the great work and can't wait to see your adventures by the way the van is a beast 😎
The contrast with the green and wood colors are really nice!
All you need now is a decent sound bar and an Android Tv Box and load up K. O. D. I.....and you'll have all the TV you can shake a stick at....FREE!!!!
Great to see the van progress from an empty white metal box to a fully featured camper. Will be nice to see you cook in a proper kitchen rather than a portable hob on top of your bed!
Mary Mary quite contrary, How does your van build go, With boiling hot water and a new TV,  All that's left is a nice pink bow!  🤣😂  You've come a long way Will and it's all been worth it Mate! Mary is looking tops! Can't wait for the Cornwall videos... love it down there!
Where can I get my personal Neil? 😂😭
Neal would be casted for Shaun of the dead 2.
You could get a firestick as you got Internet in the van  it be better I think than now tv
you learned so much from Neil lad..pass it on i know you are and will
Cool video Will. Great to spend time with you at the overlander show. Keep the great video coming.
Well done Neil and Will, Neil your a good friend to Will,  Will Mary is excited to be ready, she wants to go away now, hope to see you on the road soon. 🚐🤟🏼✌️💕
Too bad you didn't investigate into a Marine Water Heater it uses engine coolant to heat the water quickly and will maintain the heat for well over a day +160"C - no moving parts - a few hoses a bam free hot water - I went with the Quick B15 ... I'm curious to see how well hot air will heat water I've never seen on of these....
Everyone needs a friend like Neil is right  top man👍 best of luck on the Cornwall adventure will,  just wondering if Wallace is tagging along, as your trip to Austria with wallace was a great watch.
Are you going to make a hot shower 🚿
Need a stealth camp in it now it’s full of luxuries. Come onnnnnn
Will it’s looking very good 👍 them cello TV’s are excellent and are much cheaper than others 👍 if you put the sound through a sound bar they are even better mate
3:10 HEAT EXCHANGER!!!!!!!!!
Real question. Where and how in the hell did you meet that m8
10:12 watch out for those screws!!! Replace them with some nuts and bolts 😂
Amazing progress, Cornwall would be awesome for the summer!
Good job Will & Neil, hot water and a TV. What more could you need on a chilly night. Whats up next bike rack for local excursions. Lol M
It looks like 2 water cooling computer radiators stacked so you can blow hot air over them to heat the water. It's clever.
Can't wait for you to bring back more stealth camps in your fully decked van!
100%  finished… 50% of the time ?
Will, you've achieved so much! It's been awesome to follow your journey through the ups and downs. Deffo go to Cornwall....I recommend a nice little cove called porthtowan on the North Coast, close to Newquay and Redruth (a town for suplies)...Best place in the world imo. 👍
Hey Will  Always Enjoy Your Videos  Love The  Upgrade’s
Be cool see you down my neck of the woods Cornwall.  Been fun seeing your van conversion journey. Kerp up the good vids Will
Really enjoyed this video and the van looks fantastic now and neil is a legend and looking forward to next video
Oh will if u go Cornwall over summer let us know I’m in Cornwall in aug n would love to meet u.   I’ve been watchin ur vids from day 1 and when u were in the galaxy and when u started Mary  x.
Will your van is looking great matey but you do know it’ll never be finished. Get out and enjoy, you’ve been working so bloody hard on it. Amazing van well done (with a little help from Neil and Emma). Nice meeting you and Neil on his drive.
Looking amazing. Kudos to Neil. Where’s your girlfriend?
VERY NICE ..VERY GOOD  ..top job again lads ...
Come everybody let's get him to 200k fantastic work my friend
Good for you will  As neil said go and have fun now and enjoy it and find what your looking for , All the best 👊
Should get wood to go over the sink for more worktop space looks epic tho
The experience has been cathartic, enjoy the van now Will!
“With 60 degree boiling hot water” 😂😂😂😂😂 that’s something Neil would say outta inbetweeners 😂
which cupboard is the lube in ??? hahaa .
Did you say you’re heading to Cornwall.  Going to hide my daughters :)
Loved watching this project I don't mean to be nosey Will but around how much has the whole thing cost?
I wish you travel around the world with your van 👍👍👍
Well done Will. I have been following your build and it looks fantastic. Well done
Fucking love Neil 😀
Why not just use a tablet instead of a fixed location TV? So much more flexibility. A decent 10" tab s3 would be similar cost to that TV at around £100.
Congrats for the updates, I would’ve gone with a computer monitor 24-27 inch + chromecast tv and for the water system just a calorifier which is basically free hot water. GG love your videos
cornwall!!! hope to see you around
Loving the van, you've done a great job on it.
Great watching
Well done will, you and Neil did great. Love the  van. Keith from torrevieja, Spain.
What's happened to wallace ? Are you and her gettin back on the road trips soon ?
It’s a heat exchanger !
Fantastic work to you and Neil your van looks absolutely amazing fantastic work my friend
loving ever min Will, keep it up my friend!
Have you had to register the van as a camper van ?
Can’t wait to see road trip again .. Well done Mate
Bloody hell will almost 200k subs. Many congratulations to you
Well done wish ne
60c boiling water, I remember from science boiling water was 100c 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 great job though! I do like the look of those bobil heaters, really fancy one!
Well done mate, you and Neil have done a great job on the van
So happy for you.💜💜💜💜💜
Out of curiosity, what is Neils day job? He seems to know about everything haha
My wicked mind was waiting for some smoke to come out and the fire alarm to go off but that did not happen so I am going to have to wait till it does, just kidding Will ;). Another cool build and vid, can't wait to see you on the road.
Well done will really chuffed for you. You look really happy 😁
9:30 calm down Michael Scott
60° boiling 70° water is always cool.👍
Love watching this header...just wondering buddy did you not do a video on sealing the exterior panel clips
Nice 1 mate see if you can fit a sound bar in their will transform the sound and make it sound as if it's coming from all the walls of the van.
Look for “TheHidden Hut” not too far from Truro, great little place PLUS lovely beaches and superb pubs and chippies!
Its all most there nearly just about looking good
SO - I paused the video and made some popcorn, great times. Lurve the water heater!
Will, I don't care what you say about yourself, but you're a blooming genius! I've been searching (badly it seems) for a 12V heating system for my van, and Bobil do one!!! And it doesn't break the bank! I can have hot water without boiling the kettle!!!
The van is looking great now Will brother, Neil is an absolute legend of a guy helping you out. Take care big man. All the best sheriff.
Great job
Been watching this van build from start and it's great to see it finally done(ish)  Well done fella, happy days ahead!
Will - there's only 1 lube, Abolene!
It's a Michael Scott TV!  https://youtu.be/vJm8wc0eXYg
Great job mate. if youre coming to cornwall, have a day or 2 in plymouth first (its just before you enter cornwall). its beautiful here and you have to drive through anyway. i have some amazing parking places right on the sea as well, just let me know!! we can even have a beer or 5
4.02 gets instructions out 😂
Boiling water at 60 degrees?  Hmmmmm
Where does the hot air go to once its come out the other end of the water heater? Into the space where the heater is installed otherwise you are going get the back area of the van very hot. You should divert it back into the van then you can have the heater and hot water going at the same time.
Its a heat exchanger simple idea and hopefully wont give you any probs mate!  brought a Cello myself well happy with it!.
Will great JOBS done am at the moment doing a micro camper van and was after foam for the seating where is the cheapest out there or do you or Neil have any left over thanks great video's keep it up mate marty from liverpool
Nice! I Just got my own Bobil vans kit, now I get to watch you install yours before I install mine
60 degree boiling hot water? okilydokily :) #magicwater
You are doing brilliantly will happy travels 👍🏻👍🏻
Looks great Will! Thank god for Neil! Lol
Awesome job Will ^_^ Looking forward to the updates.
Love watching your adventures mate,  be safe pal
Love the van. Nice to have someone help you give it that personal touch. I am not. Very handy so obviously brought mine but still enjoy its finish.
😶
Honestly even if you did know what you were doing building essentially your own custom RV by yourself is a project. Good thing you have a good mate to help. Neil is entertaining to watch. You guys should camp together with both your vans. Van looks awesome, keep it up.
11:33 🤣🤣🤣🤣 btw Will are you gonna get some sort of shower set up for the van?
See if you can get a ANTI - Glare screen protector for that telly
Hi, great video😉, I wish I was just as good at making my own videos🙂, since I build a motorhome by myself 🙂. A hug 🤗
Have you ever tried the krypton factor neil lol. No video or instructions. Neil the genius
The vans looking more and more amazing. 😍 makes me want to get a van and do a conversion now 🤣
It must be the early bobble heater I’ve seen. The version I saw can divert the hot air in summer outside after warming the water.
Can’t wait for more
Hey will what's that's music at the beginning its banging
Where is Wallis??? Haven't mentioned her lately.
Where's Wallace ? 🤔
if its 60 degree's it's not boiling you nugget
Can't beat a 12v television . Looking good Will 👍. Big clap for Neil he's bloody good🤗.
basically the hot air heats the water. job done XD.. must say I have followed you for a while and just live what you have done... well done dude XD.
I take it Wallace no longer with you?
Looks epic will
Very nice  job❤👍
Basically it's a radiator that the diesel heater, heats up, with a directional switch so you can either have heat, or hot water.  I think I get it ha ha👍👍😎🤣
Cornwall is a great idea Will, been a few times now n this summer we are staying in a converted barn 3 mile from Lands End to tour around the very edge of the county, reckon it would be a great van tour for yourself n Mary
The van looks fantastic Will ... and Neil is a bit of a legend !
Noooooo.......so now I.need a telly and a water heater....everytime that Neil shows up ,he makes me want to spend more money on the van lol...just kidding Neil. Seriously though, you have taken a tin can on four wheels and literally made it into a home and along the way,created an amazing channel and inspiration.
How many miles has the van done mate obviously something like this is for the long term but have Alwyas wondered what happens to these van builds when you have to switch or get a new van
I always say that if all else fails read the instructions.
nothing like a bit of Gary Glitter to make things rock!
Can't believe how far the old white van has come ! It's sooo beautiful and perfectly designed for you. Youve learnt  and acheived so much Will, and got some damn good friends too !!
Oi you got a locense for that television device sir?
can't wait for stealth camping season 2 in new upgraded van. 👍
The van is looking fantastic mate and the TV on them cold rainy football days will be a godsend
Told the Mrs " I'f Will can do it so can we! Now on the hunt for a nice big MB XLWB
I think everyone who undertakes a van build needs a mate like Neil.. Absolute scouse legend
I love Neil ❤️
I had been watching ur videos for a very long time and missed many and now suddenly remembered of u cuz ur video pop over my feed. U haven't changed much and still ur funny and cheerful. Still entertain us...
Will you look like the guy from arrow that played green Arrow
Loving it Will! Now, time for some stealth camping 🙃
we did it buddy , we actualy did It , all i can say is go explore have fun make memories and enjoy your self , our time here isn't long and we all think we have time but we don't so go go go and find something amazing , see you soon and don't forget we love ya Neil Emma poppy & dolly.
Where exactly are they?  Will’s Whereabouts?
60°c boiling hot water
van is looking good!
Lovely van mate. However… WHERE’S WALLICE!!!!!
Nice one bro your getting there.... enough respect x
Not all heroes wear bright yellow hoodies but Neil does !!
Will you’re doing great work  The van looks awesome 👏
I think the word you are looking for is a heat exchanger hot air runs through the fins and coil and transfers the heat to the water simple realy
But what’s happening with the EDP?
Add some sounds system
You should buy Neil something nice as thanks for all he’s done
Well done mate, to both of you. What a team you two make!
Hot water, and a tv, will you are getting posher by the week. 😁
Looking good will!  You’ve come a long go way from the days camping in the little ford! Cheers from Victoria BC Canada 🇨🇦
100% is fine Will, like a house mate you will add things and personalise more overtime.  Encouter issues to fix etc etc 👍🏼
He's gotten a telly, aint he.
Bro love from India 🇮🇳
Please we want stealth camping 🙏😇💗
FIRST! And I have nothing interesting to say!
