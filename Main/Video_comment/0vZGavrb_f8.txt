I hope u beat thor really good this fight train really hard nice first class flight ✈ your own TV  drinks protein shake nice recliner chair to sleep watch movies 🎬 really cool 😎
Don't fight him again Eddie ..coz u fight like a girl
Eddie The Crab Hall
Talked all that shit and got beat..... hahahahaha.
I bet, If the victor was Eddie, He wont stop calling out Thor about the bets by now,  Eddie will be posting video immediately on his channel asking Thor to man up, give him the money & put on the tattoo already, you know typical Eddie. Pffft! Man Up now Eddie! Where is your EGO now huh? Give them their money and put on the "Tattoo" already.
Tattoo time
This is the Eddie that we like. Not the abuse hurling beast! Be this guy Eddie!
Humble pie time !
Made yourself look a complete sausage in the end tho didn’t you!! Bit embarrassing even watching it tbh 🤣🤣 I think you’ve made yourself look a complete plum Eddie in the end
😂😂 Desolation of Eddies Ego
Titan weight boxing is insane lmao either man could've won, it just takes one punch to end the fight, both guys fault really well! Eddie should be proud of himself, he didn't win but he showed that he's a fucking warrior.
Delete those desolation videos lol
Thor desolated you brother 🤣🤣🤣
Waiting for Eddie to have the "Tattoo" now😆
Desolation????? Pahahahhaha. Get dropped more you clown
Why haven't you uploaded anything yet after fight?
You lost
Eddie...learn to fight mate...thor kicked your ass...wtf were you doing....not living up to you hype....one word.......humility
Well well well. Come on eddie time to swollow your pill and put up a video from your loss. Sorry lad but very poor you need to work on that stance.  Eddie v thor 2 looks like. You got smasssssshed.
Clown 🤡
I noticed in the fight last night both Eddies eyes had a tired look that didn't come from the damage like he was ill or something like flu or a bug, then this pops up from a just over a week back and Eddie looks under the weather here too, not sure if it's the lighting here but did anyone else notice? I was actually shocked how good Eddie looked on the scale but that trimming takes alot of energy out a big man's body for a long time, nothing wrong with his cardio or his heart I just feel a edge wasn't there for Eddy that lively bite he always has to his character wasn't shining in his eyes. Weird to explain but without being doctors we can all look at somebody and think they don't look theirself, I just had that feeling with Eddie at the weigh in I tried listening if he had a croky throat because I me, my dad and about 10 people I know without even going out had a bug or whatever a couple weeks back and it was literally man flu on mdma, took the stomach and lungs out my body felt empty and basically on another planet so just a thought. Like I said not sure if anyone noticed anything off with Eddie the fight week or maybe just the gradual shredding of his body shape still working savage mode in training camp left some of the best of him out the fight night. I'll be honest having watched Bjorn he's seemed that stiff that a bit of decent tactical and technical work would flatten him, but he surprised me improved alot tbf his trainer did a great job for the win.  Big respect to all men involved anyway God bless
To all the mother's out there!  The Beast has been BEATEN!    Happy Mother's Day!
Hahah all I can say is I'm not surprised guys, the only thing Eddie trained the past 2 years was his ego. He owes thor and his mother a huge apology. He got out boxed, out classed, and out manned once again. Thank you Eddie for being so predictable and making me a very rich man tonight
When is the rematch?
Eddie Hall lost the fight against Thor.From what i was watching,studying boxing and watching it for 40 years,Thor did show the basics and together with his height and reach advantage looked to be the winner from the outset.Eddie Hall i dont think will have the enthusiasm to continue in boxing.Should he continue,it showed in this fight,he has more to learn than Thor.but he showed something he can build on,Eddies power is great and he did land and put thor down twice,he showed a nice meaty jab and head movement but timing and too much loading up on right hands were his errors.But good fight.
Desolation of Thor?!! Hmm…the future isn’t quite what this video is about!
Well tried Eddie but you had sh*t technique. If there is a rematch next time respect the fundementals
This series didn't age well.
can't wait to see eddie's jaw relocated to the back of his head lol.
Go on the beast. Try not to carry too much emotion into the fight. Be clinical, remember your training. Focus on your shots. Emotions can get in the way bro. Pick that big wall puncher apart! All the best to ya. Your a credit to yourself and your family how you carry yourself. Excited for this. The beast by 3rd round stoppage.
An orange?? Mate, Eddie.. that's not an orange, it's a grape.. it has to be😳
i could really see eddie in the new lord of the rings series. Dwarven Berserker. kinda perfect fit 🤣
Bro 🤣In your thumbnail it says **Decimation** of Thor (which does not make sense, it means to kill every 10th man?)  And in you title you say **Desolation** of Thor (which also does not make sense, you are going to abandon him?)  I thought English was your first languange? 🤣
You're literally in the position Mike Tyson was in his whole career, use speed, power and aggression to take out your opponent. Remember, reach does nothing if you're faster and within reach, don't let him use that range, use their height to your advantage and make him punch downwards whilest you weave, most boxers aren't trained to punch down as their opponents are stood Infront of them, not below them. Control the fight and you can choose where you want to be, he wants you to stay back so he can jab and keep you away whilest damaging you and you can't reach him. Push but be smart, don't push into one of his hooks, but sometimes taking a jab can be worth it to move in range and throw a knockout in return.
This will age badly.
O-RANG-EEE
I see a overhand right from Eddie knocking out that sore loser.
The Beast is unstoppable. The mountain is inpenetrable...
Big fan of Eddie but for crying about THOR this long I hope he gets beat. Sick of hearing about the guy and if Eddie wins we will never hear the end of it. THOR wins Eddie will shut up
Tubby, you can't even throw a proper punch after years of training.  Thor is going to beat the brakes off you, boy.
🥊💯❤
Good luck!
Eddie...you are going to get your ass kicked..
Let’s go Eddie!!
I think Thor was a sore loser and a total asshole to Eddie for not being a gracious loser and congratulating Eddie & then declaring he had been cheated even though clearly if anyone was cheated It was Brian Shaw and I don't think he thinks he was cheated. That said the last year plus feels like Eddie is traveling into the darkside and Thor has been improving himself as a person. i truly hope after the fight all hate is squashed & only humility remains between Eddie & Thor.
Let’s go big lad! 💪🏻
Eddie you do know that Thor actually boxed pro boxers already while you have been running your mouth he’s putting in work. If you really want that fight make it at BKFC they’ll make it happen tonight
eddi is such a douch
fix that thumbnail
👍 wishes...
At least we know Eddie isn’t lying about the chest infection you can hear it in his voice
He stressing lol
Should be good hope Eddie wins tho thor is disrespectful and the playground bully needs grounding
Your a good man Eddie but I’m really not sure how you would be a able to beat Thor, hope you put up a good fight though
EDDIE !!!! heres my prediction !!!!! unless you take him out in first 4 rounds !!!! your not going to go any further ,,, I think your going to try and do it with in 2 rounds
Desolation? Whatever admin person let that slide is as much a mupp as Eddy. This whole fight is the most amateur affair I've ever seen, and the little relevance they were relying on when they were at the fore of strongman has evaporated like the nights moisture on a 'desolate' desert plain. I know everything is staged these days but staged plus ham acting is beyond reproach. Big laughs at Eddy allegedy harming a female in Dubai and being in the shit after the latest ham session. Bring on 20 March so they can go fade into obscurity where they belong. Respect for the strongman accomplishments but Eddy is such an arrogant prick.
Almost 2 Million Subs/Fans behind you Eddie ... knock out Thor ( absolutely no doubt in my mind you will do it ! )
A big head is a huge disadvantage in a fight mate.... you need to do some ear stretches and get that head size down
Thor gassed real quickly in his last fight. Though that was against the arm wrestler, not at boxer.  Get in on the inside and dirty box that huge oaf.. Knock him out and make a statement! This sport belongs to the Beast Eddie Hall.
Should of gone economy …. Feel the rage….Rocky style …. Too many distractions ……. Bit Connor McGregor…….. Still think your a legend but Thor looks in good shape …. Gonna be epic
I'm excited to see this...but to be honest, I've had a hard time with the title. I know it's stupid thing to be hung up on...but DESOLATION is the wrong word. The meaning doesn't apply...or just doesn't fit.  Either way just a personal nit pick. I love both these guys. But at the end of day Thor snubbed Eddie...bitch move. I think thor fucked up on that.   I'm torn..both incredible athletes. Thor has the height and reach...Eddie has the power and in my opinion better technique.   At the end...Thor has better endurance...but eddie has the power.  Eddie in the 3rd...tko!  P.s. honestly the best to both and I hope they both get a pay day that set them for life!
Stay hydrated
What do I know? Do not train with super cold AC! Do not trust anyone. Emirate are indeed the best. The beast will prevail!
Worst case scenario, if you notice Thor get the upper hand you could try spitting on him.
Slayer Dwarf (Eddie) vs Black Orc (Thor) ^^
💓🙏💪❤️
Eddie ! You have to win! Give it your all!
Eddie knock his block off.Big up the BEAST
Larrat was fighting him just for fun, you will smash him 100%
How many people does Eddie need 🤔 has he taken more with him than Thor? S-o-T
British machine.. worlds best engineering all packed into one big mean bastard … get him delt with Eddie … knock his mouth straight for him
He sound sick 😷
Eddie looks scared ….all the best for the fight ..but I think it’s already been won
keep hydrated
Sounds like 'roid rage. These big bois are gonna gas in 20 seconds and its going to be silly.
Thor vs Eddie hall in wwe 😏
Half a decade later... they are actually going to box! This seems like its not even real. Look forward to Eddie and thor settling their differences in the ring. Its about time!
Looks like Eddie finally got his own yes men entourage. Really looking forward to the fight!
You got this Eddie!!!
Yorkshire lad bro we all know you will do the job, get your wisppa ffs fuel of gods
Desolation or decimation?
Looking good eddie looking forward to this fight 🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Hope you put up a good fight Eddie!  Watch out for that jab, slip right and go inside.
Wheres josh?
cmon yall stop this shit. strongman doesnt need manufactured rivalries
Good luck eddy you have this
damn going from watching the eddie vs thor; the truth series to this, you can definitely see how much healthier eddie looks.
I think it will be a shit fight both to big
Where’s Noah? Where’s Noah?
Eddie you look like shit boxing if I’m perfectly honest but you can still win because he is also a beginner boxer so even though he looks better doesn’t mean he will have the composure to apply his skills and make you pay in the fight. Styles make fights at the end of the day.
Eddie says the staff came out and offered to hold his ball bag.
Can’t wait to see Thor beating this bully
Is it an exhibition or real fight? Eddie will smoke thor
Hell ya eddie!! WSM
I want you to win and have the opportunity to tell Thor in the after fight press conference all you have said for him to accept he was wrong footed. You'll take some hits bud.. reach is reach.. but you have an amazing training ethic and self belief as always. The stats don't matter because the bigger fight in you will win out when you connect with his midsection. You'll work him down and start to land on his dome.. at that point the mountain will start to turn to rubble. You'll knock him out cold. Eddie Hall all the way. Kick his ass for yourself, for England and all your fans around the world. You'll do us proud no matter what and we're always behind you.
Don't worry your head is still smaller than Oberst's fat head.
Why has Thor a hammer? What do you need to put Jesus on a cross? Mjolnir :)  Eddy hall vs iranian hulk...
I really hope your fight with Thor doesn't cancel again. Cannot wait to see it.
Eat him alive Mr Hall
man i really think Eddie should have dropped more weight
Thor is going to supply you with a cream pie
How did you get the liquids through security??
He acts and talks like and highschool bully.  confidence none what so ever.
Good luck Eddie all the best with the fight
eddie. you must hydrate for this XD use all of your power.
"set a FIRE in your heart Spartan, BARE your fangs"
Fight is going to happen?
Hold you ball bag?😂
Everyone keeps talking about Thor’s reach advantage, yet the stats poster says they have the same reach 🤔.
womdering if ross will be in your corner? i know hes having issues at tbe moment. would love to see hall and edgley meet up again.
Knock the big Marras rotten shark eating head off Eddy... No prisoners....
"how big is my head" 😂
Looking fit !
You got this Eddie. I used to be a fan of Thor before I found out he was a woman beater. KICK HIS ASS!!!!
Trained all his life for wsm and he couldn't enjoy the win as much because of thor. Next week he ends it all. Come on Eddie, knock that c**t out❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🥊
Why is Eddie the only dude wearing a mask walking around...
Eddie will get under thors reach couple body shots followed with right uppercut goodnight thor go Eddie
Eddie roasts Thor in round 1
I can see you are ready, Eddie! Let's make this fight epic, no double dipping and let the best man win! Stay hydrated y'all.
If you win you should change your nickname to jörmungandr cause you killed thor.
It looks so healthy compared to WSM weight, was just watching the part one
Eddie you're going down brother!
Princess has a cold
why is he still fat?
Unfortunately you’ll tear your bicep again before the fight begins and then the fight will be postponed another 2 years
Knock that fucking abuser the fuck out.
I hope this fight will be epic. I have to say with all the weight Thor dropped i have to give him the advantage in cardia but who knows.
good luck man.  it will be a fair fight. whoever wins doesnt matter . i think it will squash the beef. hopefully. i hope FOr and entertaining fight.
What would you do if Eddie and his mates were coming at you?
Im amazed u're still talking shit Eddie
Mauritius.... , didn't expect that choice of destination from a meat head lol
hopefully he shifts this cold
LETS GO
Bro you gotta smash him full support for you.💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Hell yeah you deserve it after all these years of hard work. The dedication is amazing good luck Mr. Beast!!!
You look absolutely amazing bro...total transformation...it's gonna pay off when you destroy Thor in a few days!Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA is routing for you!
You mean the desolation of your gas tank 2 min in?
Love ya Eddie, but I saw the mountain at the Arnolds and you have a big job in front f you
You got this Eddie, can't wait to see the mountain crumble
The press conference is going to be freaking hilarious.  Thor is going to get desolated at the press conference as well as in the fight lol.
Where josh the tripod
Hope Eddie gets the k.o IMO it's gonna come down to cardio guaranteed both men will be blowing out their arse after the first round. Will Eddie's power hold up. I hope it's a dawg fight and not a hugfest. Nevertheless good luck to both guys we've waited a long time for this. Dubai must be paying them a nice bag.
Can't wait to see how it finally ends. What a saga!
He 100% has a wispa gold
Remember it's the smartest guy who wins. Not the strongest, toughest, or height.
This time we see for real who is stronger in a very classic way. May the better man win
I want to bet some money on Eddie where in the UK can i do this?
Watching Eddie walk to and from the fight will be like watching the scene from “Real Steel” where Zeus walks by. Can’t wait to watch the fight!!!
This is taking place on my birthday lol
Title: “Desolation”. Thumbnail: “Decimation” I swear this Hannah chick makes these dumb mistakes in every video. Please drop her and get a more professional videographer. This is amateur hour.
Why is thor doing arnolds? He conditioned himself and dropped loads of weight for this fight? Which is 2 weeks away. Proper random
the face of a man with low confidence
The arrogance of this man just be humble. But on a possible note my the bast man win.
How does cost it in first class
Hey Eddie have you seen the hazelnut whisper gold? , ah mate they are so good maybe after you win the fight you could get a box 📦
Why fight?, You guys are not fighters. Rather stick to what you're good at mates. Sorry , I like you guys , but when you try to fight you just look awkward. In my opinion this is not a good idea 💡.
Yo Eddie  When you gonna become an actor bud
You’re a sick mofo for wanting to get into a fight with Thor. Mad probs and respect TEAM GB
Desolation or Decimation?
What happened to the his sparring partner the mountain?
Knock this bum out mase
Thors game plan is going to be keep his distance and jab jab jab. Don't let that happen Beast, steam roll him and smash the body and the rest will shut down. Best of luck Eddie hope you make him pay for never apologising and afterwards he man's up and says sorry.
Don't back out cos you're already making excuses about the air, the country having a cold you should be saying I'm gonna smash him
They will both gas in 2 mins. This is a joke.
Lookin pretty small there Beast
Knock thors head off!! 🤜🏻
All the best luck . love you man . you got him . kick his ass
I'm half Mauritian, I hear the word Mauritius like 3 times a year. Buzzin' when he mentioned going holiday there lol
People are saying Thor to win better boxing ,to be honest Eddie will wipe the floor with him.Ex doorman there's a hidden monster inside.
Thor is going to snap you like a little twig!! Tbh I think my little brother would put you back in your box..
Eddie - right behind you, fella, you got this!!!
Don’t head hunt body the high break thor down
What are you intermittently wearing that mask for Eddie?  Thor never put a mask on once or got vaxxed.  My money is on Thor.
when your ignorance peaks off the limits now that your destruction is near!!!
It hurt to hear that you wont be snacking on that lovely cuisine on the first class flight 😂 goodluck boss! Kick some skinny boy ass
I wonder if you know the meaning of desolation? Lol
Come on Eddie.Give Thor a good bashing.Good luck.
Eddie your jokes are terrible, you don't want Thor to get ill but your ill!
I just realized if Eddie is traveling it means he jabbed up,  so risky for a big guy like him. Wish him all the luck in the world for his health and the fight!
Knock his block off brother!
Love you Eddie but this is a year too late
This is going to be a right laugh
Fight Fight Fight Fight Fight!
My money on eddie I think he get in and smash thor.
Respect to both fighters for stepping in the ring , i see both struggling to breath air by the forth round
I'm not sure desolation is the correct word but hey when Thor kicks your ass you'll not care too much
I keep thinking the desolation of smaug😂
I’m flying Emirates in April back to the UK after being away for over 20yrs.  Though I can’t afford first class and economy will have to do for my budget I cannot agree with you more Eddie in saying Emirates is an awesome airline.
Eddie is going to absolutely smash thor can not wait.. if he doesn't apologise for calling him a cheat after it then smash him again
You got 1 shot and that is the liver, liver, liver shot combo.
Thumbnail says "decimation", title says "desolation"......... someone is thick.
You gotta have serious dough to fly to Dubai and live comfortably there.
He's bat-shit crazy!  Would love to hangout with this dude!  He'd probably end up getting pepper sprayed or a thumbs up his backside.
No doubt your gonna win.
Cannot wait until this fight 🍻🍻🍻🍻
Go Eddie,  hope you enjoy your weeks in Dubai.  BEAST MODE !!!!
Be sure to keep some extra farts inside until the match, You can take him off guard and lay some extra hits while his eyes are watery.
Eddie's gonna flatten thor £50 if he doesn't
Team Hall.
Eddies gonna get bingo’ed 🤣🤣🤣
Just hope Eddie wins. Thor was a knob about that year Eddie won WSM. I'll be a bit more polite about this if I ever meet THOR .....
Interestingly pedestrian selection of whiskies for a first class flight bar!
Thor will complain if he loses 😉😉
Thor fights like a transgender women
Best of luck Eddie, a true inspiration. I’ll be watching live 💪💪
Good luck Eddie 👍
They'll be throwing arms willy nilly, breathless in ten seconds through nerves, then hugging eachother, best of buddies the end!
Good luck Eddie, hope you smash Thor
From what I've seen brother your form looks very good. Thor has improved greatly and can't wait to see how good you have become. Good luck brother.
You're gonna give Thor a boxing lesson 👍
stay safe man, i know how much this must mean to you but be safe dude
Where’s Josh
Eddie I hope you knock the fuck out of Thor straight up he's gonna be chopped down by the BEAST!! 💪🥊🥊
When is the fight seems like it's always moving
Make sure you are very well hydrated 👏 sir Eddie
Eddie: I'm on my diet... whisper gold, yes please.
Convenient you're coming down down from a cold already... sorry "recovering." Everytime something like this happens theres someone getting sick orvhealing up, just not quite 100%... win or lose this gets referenced again
When is the fight on plz
u can do it eddie!!!
The title of the video gave me goosebumps
Surprised its possible for someone who pumps that many vitamins and minerals in every day to still get sick
THE BEAST go on mate.. Big love Eddie the UK with you..
Eddie books a first class flight and dont even eat the food there wtf😂
Can he win?
where is josh?
get some sinutab mate
looking healthy pal
I just hope its entertaining lol
I’ve got a feeling Eddie will spark him in the first minute or two. Worth a bet.
Id be really interested to see a video doing a break down of your overhead costs.
Looking awesome, Eddie. Go destroy the Mountain !
I'm putting a grand on you to win mate, and if you could keep him alive for 3 rounds before burying him on the 4th I'd appreciate that, have fun big man you're winning no doubt 🤟🏻
You look like you’re struggling to breath standing at the airport, yeah you have a cold but sheesh….this is going to be a horrible fight 🙈
Eddie you not got your chick in first class ha ha
Curious as to why you're wearing a mask walking through the airport?! 🤦‍♂️
Getting smashed luv
Good luck Eddie! Rooting for you buddy.
How could you not like this man? everything crossed for you Eddie! Good luck!
We had to wait so fucking long no one actually cares anymore lol
Desolate or decimate, which is it? Are you going to make Thor feel wretched and unhappy, or are you going to reduce him by 10 percent? Both, perhaps?
Just eat the airplane food m8...it won't make any difference lol
Holy shit balls. My money is on eddie
Forestry services are not going to be happy with this fight... The amount of wood needed for Thors coffin will have massive impact on climate change.
Hope you've been working on your head blocking and head movement it's so important
Beat Thor and you can have a wispa gold!
the fights for free? i would have paid
One question ??   For What ??
I'm tuning in... Can't wait Eddie
Thor gone to America, why would you waste valuable days travelling and jet lag, this far out.?? Maybe Eddie is in his head? Respect to both guys, and love their channels. I think it going to be a super close fight and gonna come down to mental toughness..I think Eddie is the man because that killer instinct and he will put his body and health on the line to win. thats why hes the beast...
desolation of Thor? 🤔
Man I can’t wait for this fight and to hopefully see Eddie beat the absolute shii out of “Thor”. But I’ll say Eddie looks like he’s in really good shape and is taking this very seriously and is ready to get in there and beat this cows a$$, and I can’t wait to see it happen.   GOOD LUCK EDDIE, I hope you absolutely maul this man and beat his @$$ and show him who the real Worlds Strongest man and throw those hands to his face and honestly kool you knock him unconscious for all the bs he talked about you when you beat him fair and square.   And you can tell Eddie is the better man, when he lost at the, I think the Britains strongest man or whatever competition it was, he congratulated “Thor” and put him over basically, but when Eddie beats him fair and square he has to call cheating and make a skeptical of the whole thing and refused to let Eddie enjoy his moment in the spotlight. And even if there was any “cheating” though we all know it wasn’t, Eddie had nothing to do with it at all, so “Thor” needs to get over himself honestly.
Lets get Eddie to 2 million before the flight!Good luck Eddie we know your gonna win😀😀
You're the king
Wish u trained with  John Fury, would of been a great trainer..... THORS GOIN DOWN IN THE😉 THORFOURTH💯
GO 'BEAST'...!! 💪🏻🦁❤🦁🤍🦁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Please please please fuck him up Eddie! Fed up of all the idiot Thor fanboys talking smack. 👊🏼
The people saying he looks nervous wouldn’t you be? About to step in the ring in front of the world no matter how confident you are. I just hope both these men settle this shake hands and go back to making epic strong man content.
Damn mans looking lean and fit. The difference between WSM Eddie and boxing Eddie is vast
Dude u tryin to box? Lol! Good luck man but thor is gonna smash u. I've been telling u this for 2 years...learn how u box lmao
I think Eddie have the advantage over thor in skill and speed  .he has reach but i can see Eddie ducking thors jab. And. Connecting With a full range hook to the ribs over and over .. Eddie will win this match sorry Thor.
People who understand boxing.. Eddie is much stronger and faster than Thor.. plus Eddie is mentally stronger too.. within 3 rounds Eddie will knock Thor out
Eddie will absolutely destroy Thor
Goodluck to both and thanks for bringing this incredible fight.
Hearing this fight going on has inspired me to work even harder at practice and at weight training
how big is your head?  NOT as big as Oberst's!!!
The lack of cardio will be the major factor in this fight
See ya soon? BIG LoVe The Beast! Cmon dad you didn’t tuck us in right!
Watching Thor's videos he has trouble breathing, he is going to be gassed after 2 rounds.
he seems alot more focussed than usual...
Thors new video he was saying don’t get injured and he thinks your gonna pull out
Go get em Eddie 💪
Bulldoze through him Eddie can't wait mate, looking forward the press conferences you'll be winding him up something rotten!!!
Go smash Thor the bore,I love you Eddie x
I completely believe in you. I've followed you for a long time and stayed up to date ( as my shedule permits 🤣) from the start of your training for this fight. Not only will you win but you'll completely obliterate Thor.  Following you and got your back all the way !!!
Gl pal do you need vaccine to fly out to Dubai?
Eddie please relax and don't get an injury before the fight
lol Thor's gonna delete you, typical Stokies thinking their the shit
How can we watch the fight? I keep waiting for Eddie to tell us. Somebody help me figure this out
i've been waiting for this
Not paying for ppv but rooting for you bro. Get inside his reach and punish his body. Good luck bro
Where can I watch the fight?
Makes an orange look like a little apricot in his hands :)
You look embarrassing with the mask on lol
So is it desolation or decimation? Lol
This is gonna be like the worst fight ever
I wonder if Eddie thinks he could take mike Tyson.  Prime for prime.  Obviously he could defeat mike now.
Eddie's getting NERVOUS!! But bro, I just saw Thor at the Arnold. YOU GOT THIS EDDIE!
Goodluck Eddie you worked hard for it no one is or could be more prepared than you are right now.
Looking great Eddie, someone better have a box of wispa golds ready for Eddie after the win, i can see him eating the whole lot after being starved of them for so long :)
Good luck! To the once doubting. I dont think Eddie will let the fear of losing get in the way. Honestly, This is the Beast, no matter what! Yesterday, today, tomorrow💪🔥 Lets go! ❤️
The best men in the world, come from Staffordshire.
Good luck Eddie!
I got my money on you eddie ( I know you won't disappoint me)
Safe travels eddy 👍👍
Hey Eddi Wheat Gras is genius against a cold
hi. Where can you stream the fight?
So.. where I can watch the match?
He looks very nervous
Wish you all the best for the Fight
..and dont take the covid vacxcine
Not being an American airline helps🤣
Go on eddy
Wish you both well guys in fight nice video would like too see Eddie come out on top Thow  👍
EDDIE SIR LOVE FROM INDIA❤.. I AM YOUR BIG FAN ...
Eddie you will smash this fight 😤 💪
Eddie everyone say you drop yorhand too low in sparring. If thor face punch u make sure u protect face friend!
Get Tyson fury to train you if it’s possible probably cost a fortune but he might help a Brit out who knows.
Eddie bought a one way flight for this to save money for his funeral 😬😬😬😬
Eddie will win.   That is all
Nice crocs like village farmer 😀
Eddie should we expect your inner Tyson fury in these press conferences. Would be hilarious to watch
Good luck Eddie!!! After the match pass by Cyprus to chill you are closer to us now !!! We want to visit us here!!! Best of luck mate!! Go get him!!!
Eddies coming to my country 🇲🇺Mauritius,holy shit, really hope  to meet you eddie🙏🔥
Guarantee you Eddie is gonna get a 1st round knockout
Good job getting 2 Physiotherapists. I survived a Stroke in 2018, still in a Wheelchair with my constant calls to Physio being met with excuses not to see me. i.e. The big hurdle for me is getting a suitable wheelchair, SMRC (Specialist Mobility Rehabilitation Centre), responsible for wheelchairs are not doing their job. It's been a long wait. Way to go NHS.
I always liked you better Ed. Stay frosty out there!
you look nervous
Just please don't get injured Eddie, the anticipation is immense, can't wait for this!.
Making excuses already........🙄
Where’s Josh? Who’s this Big Red guy? I don’t remember seeing him in previous videos
the only advantage thor has over eddie is his height.........and when eddie puts him on his arse he wont even have that advantage anymore.
Why Dubai? It is just a shopping centre in the desert with sharia law. It is one of those horrible little countries where there is no respect for anyone they decide they don't like.
Good luck I wish you the best against thor the losser. looking in great shape Eddie Hall💪💪
Get em champ!
Get it done mate!
Want Eddie to win but i do not see this being an exiting fight both guys are 2 big and slow neither are skilled fighters. But come EDDIE BRING HOME GLORY FOR UK✊️👊
This fight gonna go one way that’s Eddie going in there showing him his skills for a round then knocking him out round 2
You look more like Bill Kazmier every day!!
I’m English and I look forward to seeing thor knock you out.
You got this Eddie kick some ass
Come on Eddie my king👑
Eddie's got heart and that's what I love about him!
Legitimate question eddie. If you tore your bicep doing what your calling "fake boxing" (you showed the video, it's the same hands down sideways boxing as been for years) to psyche thor into thinking this is how you box. Then WHY after being injured, do you continue to do it? You know it injured you and put you back in training, could of had this thing done last year. Why continue to do the potentially dangerous for your body "not your real boxing" and not actually spend your actually needed time and energy into your "actual training"?
I really like Eddie, but Thor is just so much bigger. Idk I have my doubts..
We are finally here, been following the whole build up and so glad I will be able to watch the fight. Good luck Eddie smash him.
You’re fucked Eddie..
Eddie !! Nnnooonnooo 🙈🙈🙈WTF HAVE YOU GOT ON TOUR FEET ?
No "big love. the beast" sign off?? 😲
Nice airline advert 👌   Clearly comped so he would say nice things  Sounds noticeably sick
Just kidding 😂😂
Thors gonnna kill him
I really hope Eddie thinks he can beat Thor and he doesn’t think otherwise until the fight starts. Otherwise, we’re going to see a new series of excuses from Eddie not to fight. Eddie, you’ll win mate!!!!! Don’t focus on excuses. Just show up.
Eddie he can't move...I like U both but U know...beast...Move! 💪do da job Bro!
Come on Eddie 💪💪💪💪
Well your fight is actually on my birthday gonna tune in of course. Got to say to you and Thor both I’m a huge fan of y’all both congrats on both of y’all transitions. I hope the fight goes well for both of y’all and safely of course. Gotta give a lil more rooting for Eddie tho think he deserves the win. Make the mountain into gravel!!!  lol Good luck 👍
Team Eddie all the way 💪
fuck me eddie how much of a team do you need? Only two men in the ring little guy. You not gonna have any excuses
definitely team Eddie
Eddie you can eat a Wispa gold right after you win the fight!
I heard it is 1 am fight in Dubai. Is that right? How are you going to cope with fighting so late?
I am a strongman fan, don't know much about boxing, but I am an Eddie fan! So I'll be watching this!
This "fight" is gonna be worse than dada 5000 and kimbo slice lmao
Love you Eddie ..
Really hoping Eddie you will be fit and ready 101% for the big day!
Make him bleed big man 💪
“The decimation in desolation”
Hope you have a good fight, win and do some more of the "strongman does random sports/events" again. Really loved that content
There is no doubt that this Eddie Vs Thor Fight has made them both a great big ton of money. Good for them, such hard work and dedication really paid off.
Hopefully you get acclimatised better than Thor. He was fucking about at the Arnold’s this weekend just gone
Eddie Hall is the only man whos bodyguards bodyguard is him.
You are going to do great Eddie!!! Best of Luck to you 😊💪🙌
Good luck Eddie not that you need it for the fight, enjoy.
Eddie looks like a man about to walk the green mile...
How’s he get the food and drink on the plane
Should have called it the beast breaking the mountain.
1am in the morning
Eddie tip when Thor blocks don’t try to break his guard hit his arms it will get you a good deal of points and in the later rounds after a couple dozen hits his arms will go numb and he can’t block.
He looks worried 😦
Good luck Eddie, I'm routing for you.
Mate, been following you since strong man days !   You’re such an inspiration and it’s amazing how far you have come!  Good on ya mate , nice to see all that hard work paying off!
Think Eddie's gonna get banged out but it'll be interesting to see. Big guys throwing big punches, Anything can happen. Eddie seems to be a lot more intense person in general and I can see that helping a lot in the fight
Come on big eddie all the way 💪 🙌
who is showing the fight how will we watch it .
he is not
Hey, what's this join button?
Come on Ed bring it home for the Midlands 👊🏽
I hope at the end of this you can guys can squash it whatever the result because once you share the ring, that bad energy should be gone... Holding on to it isn't going to help either of you guys. I hope both come out healthy too, the fight game is no joke.
going to watch :)
Give him a proper lesson in sportsmanship!  Good luck Eddie
Having Watch'd eddies boxing training, his movement for a big man is amazing. I think this will help eddie with thor's reach and height advantage, eddie can move and come in under those arms and boom!!. Nice upper cut and a left or right to finish I only see a KO for Eddie early on. Team Beast.
You don't need to me to wish you Good Luck Eddie, luck doesn't come in to it when you're the best boxer.  All is well over here in Seabridge. Saw n spoke to Alex and your Doggie the other day.  Chill out, train hard and knock that lump of Lard out, Duck.
Pat's looking fucking huge!! 🤘💪💪♥️
It's time to kick ass
Eddie, Two things sir.  1) considering your both ex world strongest men, and not 'just' worlds strongest men, but truly, You are a Beast Eddie, and Thor, I mean, he's not exactly small either.  Just please don't try and take each others heads off, I shudder to think at the torque and sheer power you can exert on each other, its not normal punching power, its scary power.  I say this, because I want you both healthy after the fight.  2) Thor seams to be really taking his training seriously, even Joe Rogan gave Thor props for training 'right' in his view, and I believe Thor will be trying to box technically, rather than using sheer force going for an early K/O.  I think he will be behind his jab a lot, and I say this because if you try and take his head off with a looping overhand, if your over punching, over reaching, your gonna be easier to counter, and you may deplete your cardio once adrenaline dumps, and then its a brutal survival game against your foe.  Remember Connor McGregor against Floyd Mayweather Jr, you don't wanna be like that guy.  Now I'm sure you'll know this, as you take your training seriously also, just thought id be a keyboard hero and say this to you, and finally, I wish both of you luck.
Rocking the Crocs! Nice!
This is a different Eddie...Deadlift breaking Eddie...I can pick up that, 'something bads coming' vibe...Fuckin Love It...Smash then Rogan
You lost how many strongman competitions until you finally won? I hope you apply this if you don't win. This is your first fight against someone who's going to feel the same pain you're going to feel if he lose. Wishing for the best.
Get it!!
Should be a good fight, don’t worry Eddie, you’ll win! 👍
You'll soon sweat that cold out in Dubai!
Eddie you're not happy that Thor's at the Arnold's because you and your mates tried to ostracize him from everything, even now they don't recognise Thor's records (and I'm not even taking about the deadlift) in the competitions organised by your circle. You guys are pathetic, you can debate the deadlift if it's official or not, but no longer recognising his other records at the comps run by your circle, that's pathetic. They're just intimidated by you (your circle ) and let you tell them to do that stuff. Having a whinge that Thor can still be at strongman competitions. You're the one who delayed the fight already once lol. I am so keen for Thor to win  I watched your strongman documentary the other day. Thor had so many nice things to say about you in all those snippets he's in your movie
Where can I bet on this match ??
From what I've seen Eddie's speed and movement is superior to Thor's so stick and move and my money's on you big man👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
I really enjoyed watching both of you guys in WSM but I think Eddie is more of warrior. Good luck Eddie can’t wait to see the fight
We all know this fight has a predetermined outcome. Still interested to see how it turns out.
Staying humble and getting a £20,000 flight 😂
Team Beast
Wheres the big boxer lad?? U sacked him eddie?
Lets go Eddie you got this❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Good luck Eddie! Go to that place again dude and nobody will stop you😎👊❤️
only started watching you and strongman 2 weeks ago. been a great binge. best of luck man
Go and meet gaurav chaudhary (technical guruji)
Take him out to the deep waters where there is no where to run and settle it like men. 🤷‍♂️
Goodluck Beast, Hope you smash him
Hope you win mate!
Eddie, you are clearly the epitome of what can be achieved by sheer "will"...its a simple concept, difficult to implement as a process and ridiculously boring to be at it day in and day out - And yet, this is what separates the "Greats" from the ordinary people. Thor should be just another day in office for you! Rooting for you, Eddie!!!
Hey man, you gotta try that super deep pool they got in Dubai!
Watching a tiny bit of thor he seems to have no wind beast all the way
I seen Thor @ the Arnolds in Ohio. He seemed to appear fidgety and apprehensive. Not really at the event in his mind. I think THE BEAST is haunting his thoughts! None of the cocky Thor mountain nonsense he typically is spewing out. He looked defeated already mentally.
Eddie my big man.
How comes the fight is on a Tuesday?
JUST DONT GET INJURIED
Shiz getting real
hoping Thor wins but if i had to place a bet it would be on Eddie
first it was the biceps and now it's a cold. one wonders what the next excuse is just before the fight? Good luck Thor! 😅😅
I’m this confident you’ll win that I’m putting a grand on it, come through Eddie 👊🏼
Eddie I should be saying you’re gonna lose because we all know what happens when people are against you… I can’t wait until you knock Thor out, Eddie is the only genuine boxer who’s not gonna take a cash deal to lose, can’t fucking wait big guy!
Already lining the excuses up lol
Time to take care of business eddie, do it. And in the immortal words of the great boxing referee Mills Lane " LET'S GET IT ON" 👊.
Ballbag lol
EDDIE YOU GOT THIS
Eddie 1st class (of course). Rest of the gang in the cheap seats 😆 go get him Eddie 👊🏻
Your Sylvester Stallone he is drago remember that you can win
Bro I'm gassed for the fight!
Just remember to hydrate
eddie is a bloody legend
Take his head off got alot ov cash on you Eddie
Been team Eddie from day one you got this big man :) smash him
Thor is gonna light you up 😂
Great going eddie! Can't wait!
Wispa Gold is top tier chocolate bar!!
Love that title
I really don’t think Eddie will win! Not enough focus on pure boxing! To much unnecessary weight training! I mean is he afraid to be bullied in that ring or what?
And a whisper gold, 😂 Love the funny side to eddie
On your side, go Eddie
Eddie will there be a rematch after you win? 😄 Big love!
where can i see the fight in germany  will it be streamed?  Team Beast
Be kind don t punch Larry at Binous
Can't the 'Desolation of Thor' not mean Thor is the one doing the destroying, such like the reference in the Hobbit with Smog?
Jesus Christ himself said SATAN IS GOD 😔, DEATH TO JESUS
Come on Eddie smash him bro 💥 👊🏽🥊 into next week give him a reality check 😂 🙌🏽☝🏽
No matter who wins, Thor will stay isolated and portrayed as a crying child in the strongman Industry.
Finally!! Love Eddie
The key to winning is to stay hydrated!
Just do this Eddie. 🥃
does anyone know what the music is in the video
Are you seriously wearing crocs 😂 One word T R A M P 👍🏼
Do you pay for every ones business class tickets in your team, legend.
I like you both and hope it’s a good fight and no one gets badly hurt.Good luck to both of you
There ya go Eddie... Take the fam on Holiday and enjoy life.. that's what it's all about mate.  Cheers 🍺
I would take a punch from The Beast to be able to attend this fight. A fully padded punch lol.
Come on Hall!!!! 🥊 🇬🇧
Eddie’s taking this serious everything he’s planned from beginning to end love it.can’t wait to see him wreck Thor!!!
Hope your pilots not had the   C L O T   S H O T   😬 plane be  crashing half way 🥵
Do you have to be jibby jabbed with the experimental gene therapy mrna juice to fly to dubai????
hey eddie where can i Watch the game? i live in japan by the way ur content is awesome!!
Trip to the moon, passenger Thor, pilot Eddie.. Going to be a phenomenal fight. Give it your very best Eddie Hall!!👊🏽💪
I just have one question, who is looking after your dog?
I can see fear in eyes of...
dude. you are english, you cant just turn a noun into a verb,,,, how bout decimation???
Eddie will win if he rocks Thor early. If Thor has time to find his range it's going to be a cardio battle. I think Eddie has the upper hand but Thor is strong.
Eddie forever ❤️
Eddie please send Thor to 'Valhalla'
I'm pretty sure Eddie doesn't know what desolation means.
After that you should come back to strongmen and bench 265kg again.
My Money’s on Eddy. I saw Thor fight. I was not impressed
Can't wait to see you make Thor quit.
Don’t hope for Thor to back out. That’s your move son.
Come to AZ and spar with me pleeeease I am no boxer but I hella lift weights, box and boy I am fast, let's get it
You will back out again.
I'm so fucking excited for you to battle this out bro! Get that shit done and taken care of. Smash Thor to pieces in the ring. Hopefully then he can be a man, take the loss and move on. Big love bro!
Loving the Beast edition crocs
The video should be called “The Decimation Of Thor” I may not watch the fight live because of the time difference but I’m routing for ya bro! Give it to Thor for all of us mate 💪😎
The exam will be easy, just don't waste time on the easy questions.
Lets hope you win with a title like that xD
What a dick title of a video, is your pre frontal cortex fully developed?
Knock shit out of him mate
Eddie in an airport, purchasing tickets for a whole first class section of a plane 😏
Your looking kind of dehydrated buddy hopefully gatorade sponsors the fight for you
Just stay hydrated and knock him out one two then keep hooking him bro
Thor's gonna win. far better boxer
Good luck Eddie! You always have a great attitude no matter what. Big inspiration. Go Team Beast!
Been following you for a while, good luck sir
Lookin awesome Eddie
Hopefully WW3 postpones until this fight happens!
When all is done I hope you guys can finally squash the beef and move on! Lessgo
I hope after thor gets knocked out he can finally give Eddie the respect he deserves.
Whisper Golds to the winner of the fight!!
Just be hydrated
Thor is a hard worker no doubt, Eddie is a maniac...its hard to beat a maniac...cause as the word describes they are crazy...I am betting on Eddie...
You are going to smash him back to the past.. the only thing he will remember is him crying about the 2017 strong man... lol
You Are Going To Win No Doubt!!
Go get em Eddie
Brother come at Taj Dubai at the Palm  Can wait to mee u 🤘
Looks like Eddie hasn't slept in weeks
I just want to see a good fight. I have no dog in the fight. I doubt this will resolve anything...it never does. If anything someone is going to go home upset. Good luck to the both of you.
Interesting that both Eddie and Thor having taken such different approaches to the fight. Eddie aiming for power to be able to KO him with a few hits. But he's going to have to get past thors reach and get close to him for that to happen
You look great Eddie can't wait for the fight 👍👊👊💪💪💪
I do not give a FUCK who wins this Fight All i care about is there better be a REMATCH CLAUSE in the Contract after all the FUCKING BULLSHIT TALK between the Two of them. This has been going on for FOUR/OR FIVE YEARS
Awesome dude, hey I know you'll do great man. Thor doesn't stand a fuckin chance.
💕💕💕
If it weren't for exams, and the fact that the fight is happening very, very late at my time, I would probably be watching it.  But even then, I wish you luck.
All the best Eddie. Unleash the beast. Keep your cool, ignore the pain and your strong will and determination will win
He’s going to use his height, reach & speed to exhaust you. Move in close, keep your arms up high, and don’t throw wild haymakers. Conserve your energy for the first round.
Eddie vs 4 should be exciting!
Thor will ko this low IQ muppet
So excited about this fight. Been following your training since day one. I'm team Hall buddy!
KRATOS COMING TO MEET THOR.... ❤️❤️❤️
I hope someone reminds this guy to make sure his life insurance premiums are up to date. I feel bad for his family.
This is Sparta!!!!
I hate to say it man but I wish you would've laid off the weights . Also you needed more professional sparring partners. I wish you luck you'll need it
Get in close that's how you neutralize the reach . Go get him Eddie 👍
Beast will knock out Thor with a uppercut
I can't wait to watch the fight. I can't wait to see you win
Eddie you have absolutely no chance. Thor is receiving real boxi training. Idk wtf your doing. Lol
Saxon vs Viking lol
Legend
I am fuckin next level excited man! Ive got a good chunk of my lat few paycheques on you smashing his face in buddy!  Good luck and honestly, have fun ripping this guy apart!
With all this hype, If you don't win, your Legend will die, But hope you Knock Out the Half-Skinny-Thor
Did you just borrow a title from The Hobbit?  lol  BTW Eddie, I think right now is a good opportunity for both of you to commit the winnings at least in part to the Ukraine crisis, but that's just me. Oleksii is going over to fight for his country so...far as I'm concerned he's the manliest WSM you could ask for and deserves all the support he can get.
Thor by knockout sorry mate
I’m betting this won’t be a good fight at all. Two big dudes who will miss wildly and get exhausted fast. However in a boxing match I feel like Thor will win on points. Plus if PPv buys are good this will happen again.
Bring home the W Eddie..show Thor 2017 was no fluke..
Where can I watch the fight and where can I bet on the fight.
Thor will destroy this dude
I feel like Eddie's gonna kill himself if he loses
Speed kills. Thor will be overwhelmed
Even after the weight loss, Thor still has 5 stone on him and is still 5 in taller (not sure what the reach advantage is, but due to the height difference, it's substantial)  I think Eddie's toast, lads
goodluck eddie although he has greater height advantage but ur grit is something else
Will you be posting the fight so everyone in beast nation can see you put the beat down on Thor
damn 1st 1st 1st class?
ahhhhhh man less than two weeks, been waiting for this for ages. Go Eddie, im all with you.
World War 3 has begun and Eddie is still thinking about Thor. God bless him.
I think after first round both will be tired and it will be a joke but I might get surprised and you both go wild I don’t want to see a knock out first round I want to see a couple giants beating each other’s ass 😂
I am with you eddie. Go for it BEAST.
Can someone tell me where i can watch the fight live
you would look good rocking a venom 😷
not good going into fight unwell ...colds deplete energy ..
What time and date will the fight be in NZ?? :) Been waiting and excited for this fight!!
I wanna see this fight hopefully it goes all 6 or knockout pls
Never looked better dude! Been a sub since 70k, wish you the best of luck!
Stay hydrated big man!
Decimation or desolation?
It's so hard not to put money on Eddie when he says he's going to do something.  Thor has every advantage but Eddie will knock him out. He was the hardest in Stoke at 17 and trust me that's no mean feat
lol anyone else notice how desolation is completely the wrong word to use
The best thing about first class if the plane crashes ye all die . 😂
The expense is killing me
I didn't know there would be a Press Conference, i would love to see you there shittalking about, would be so fun xD
Can't wait to see thor hit the canvas
Im no expert on boxing but Eddie looks to be a lot quicker than Thor with better technique from what Ive seen of them both. Im shouting for Eddie. He is a fun loving Giant and always up for a laugh. Thor is more serious and straight laced. May the best Freak of Nature win (I mean that in the most complementary way). Best of luck to both Athletes 👍
Can't wait for the big fight, it's a crying shame we couldn't see you abuse the inflight food menu like last time,  however best of luck.
We've seen eddies power on the bag and it's beyond impressive.. however thor hasn't posted any videos that showcase his power. Even those two boxing matches didn't look too serious. I think we're all in for a surprise when we see thor on the 17th..  I have a feeling he's gonna throw down hard.  Will be a good match and I'm willing to bet they both walk away with more respect for eachother.
go easy on him!
I can’t wait bro, build up has been insane n it’s a no bs fight, whoever wins is the better man
Whatever you say, Eddie has been my motivation to get my butt in the gym.
Where can you buy tickets to watch the fight online?
Hope you actually trained for boxing instead of that bs you were doin that ripped your bicep. I really wasnt impressed when that happend and it made me side with thor even thow I was initially on your side.
Yeah you get your own cabin this time ... but does it come with a shitter where you don't have to open the door to wipe your ass? 😁
Thors getting spanked. Don't @ me now, save it for after the fight when I can reply "told you so"!
Eddie with the right training will demoralise Thor. Thor has lost more weight. Eddie is stronger and hungrier. Just my opinion I hope they get over it all, celebrate at the buffet after and then bash Oberst
Good luck brother knock him out.
Is Josh not coming to the fight?
Where can we watch the press conference? Will it be in the same streaming platform as the fight?
you got this eddie
Let’s go!! Give him Hell Beast!
I'm guessing eddie is 155kg and thor like 135kg that place a big big part. Thor better boxer but eddie has the killer instinct I recn and thor doesn't have that
Eddie can get airplane seat now lol
How can we watch the fight? Will it be on YouTube.?
Best of luck, Beast.
looks like  this is going to be fun,,nice plane
im in the usa and im team eddie all the way. BEAST
The Title though! LOL
Its been a long time coming goodluck Mr hall.
For all the women he has assaulted, Kick His Ass Champ!
Good luck Eddie!  I'm routing for you.  I hope you win!  :D
Fiiiiiiiiiiinallly
Both of you be safe.
OMG the press conferences will be a fucking show, can't wait for that...
Winner donates everything to Ukraine!
Nice crocs
Looking forward to the fight Eddie!!)
Mate, I'm rooting for you.
Great video. My best wishes in the fight!
Imagine being surrounded by all those who helped you train and devote your life to this for the last 2 years...seeing them in the stands behind you as you fight...I'm sorry but I just don't see Eddie letting himself lose in front of that...
Eddie looking very nervous, should of done a few exhibitions.
Anyone else having trouble trying to sign up to the SEGU tv site?  Just come up in red can’t sign up.  Thanks
Sucks they can't go all in cause of the rules and thor being a scardy cat.
Let’s gooooo Eddie!!!
Good luck Eddie!!!!
Thumbnail: Decimation Video title: Desolation  Buddy you need to focus, Thor is Gona punch that ego right out of you.
Wait....the fight is happening really soon? I thought it was in a handful of months?
Thor will come down with covid this week
i dont think anyone outside of your followers really give a shit about this fight, its meaningless, it was a good idea last year, now its just a drawn out waste of time, that proves nothing, just for you 2 to get paid
You can really tell this fight is weighing heavy on Eddie's mind he's much more serious than usual. He's clearly starting to harness all of his energy and focus to absolutely smash thor. This is gonna be epic💪
👍🏻
Good luck Eddie 👊💥 Get on the inside, stick to him like glue & play his ribs like a xylophone! 😜 It's gona be a great battle, Rrrespect!! ✌
Eddie will have to go into hidding if he loses this match!
Looking good eddie! Looking sharp!
I can’t wait for the face off between these two guys or their reaction when they see each other after a while
to recover from that flu chew one tooth of garlic raw. or smash it and drink it on water
so are all the team in first class?
best of luck :D
Dubai and Eddie Hall needs Brian Shaw and shenanigans
WHAT CHANNEL IS IT ON
The Beast is gunna do what he does best. DESTROY. Currently they have it 8/11 in favor of Thor. But I know Eddie is gunna get that round one TKO. Bets are placed and time to sit back and watch and collect my winnings.
Well done Eddie, you've been smashing it on the daily! Can't wait to see you beat Thor and maybe in the future - a 510kg deadlift 😀 Be well, let's go team Beast!
Come on Eddie
Ok ok this is how its going to go down  Eddie going to win …….
i really hope at the end of this, you two have peace, and can grow and move on
Good luck Eddie!😁
Team Eddie!!!!!  Let’s goooooooooo
Hhhhhorrange 😂😂
RELAX EDWARD,  D. ELDER LOUISVILLE KY

Eddie, I hope we are going to get to watch all your training footage after the fight! Look forward to seeing all the progress you've made. Best of luck vs thor. Mind you he needs it more than you! Made my wager on armbet...team beast all the way 💪
I just want to see two giant amateur boxers have a good ol’ scrap!!
As much as I like Eddie it seems like Thor trained for this more as an actual boxer would. How much that affects the outcome will be interesting.
Kick Thor’s a$$!!!!
Thor vill crush
Best of wishes I hope you dont have covid if so need to rest
Eddie Eddie Eddie come on big man we’re rooting for ya 👌👌👍👍
Man I hope you smash him to pieces. I wish you had some warm up fights though :(

There's very low Covid in Ohio, I wouldn't worry about that.
Iv heard rumours that the stress Conference is going to be crashed by Branch Warren When asked about Eddie and Thor, Branch just shouted "Dafuq they gon dooo" and went on to say tune in for the press conference for s surprise
I’m like 65% 35% for this fight….. 65=Eddie    Ik all y’all think Thor is so fast and athletic but Eddie is just Eddie like you can’t deny that ever
Wow this is Exciting. The world really wants to see this fight. .
Eddie looks so prepared! He’s not even dehydrated!
Got a feeling Eddie will gas out pretty fast
Here’s rooting for Thor!!!!  THOR THOR THOR!!!!!
Has Eddie announced what time the fight will be on?
Good luck Eddie!
I hope this will end like the KSI Logan Paul feud. After the fight shake hands and be friends again
Seems nervous
Soo excited
Eddie I am 100 percent in your coner mate I believe you can do it and just believe in your self buddy on fight night let the eye of the tiger out. I am from South Africa I am a big fan God bless love peace and afro grease and catch you on the flip side 🙏
Good Luck Mate!
Highly recommend a fishing trip with Mauritius. Just come back, happy to DM you lots of tips and the captains number. I’ve done a video on my channel of catching & cooking fresh Tuna.
Right behind you mate. Never met you but Thor is a c***!
cant wait for this,
You got this bro
Eddie you got this bro. Mr game of thrones is about to get knocked the fuck out
One prediction for the fight... messy!
First off... I LOVE the name of this video series xD Second off... Damn! You really spared no expense on that flight :) Good on ya!
Go one mate kick the big mans butt please.
2 weeks to come up with an excuse not to get ripped apart :D
Smash him Eddie. I wish I could see it in peros. But tv will be great too
protect your head Thor is targeting your head
Remember to come into the fight HYDRATED!
lookin good EH, good luck
"The desolation of thor" hahah, good title. Meaningful.
Get a lot of cardio in🏃‍♂️🕺🧗‍♂️⛷🤺⛹️‍♂️🏊‍♂️🚵‍♂️🤽‍♂️🤹‍♂️🤾‍♂️just do it. Or🚶‍♂️
Eddie we need you to win this fight. I HATE people that don't take accountability for their actions. You were owed a public apology from Thor during WSM, which didn't happen. Make an example out of the prick.
Someone please tell me the fight is titled clash of the titans
Make sure you stay hydrated!
Just remember not to kill him. Hurt, yes. Kill, no.
Come on Eddie! Big love for the beast
It's amazing, this fight is going to be streamed live! Can't wait! I do not care who wins either way, you are both great guys, I just hope no one gets badly hurt!
swear there has been no promotion didn’t even know it was in 2 weeks, what uk channel is showing it?
Cant wait to see you get a good battering Eddie.   You've turned into a arrogant bully since your success.
Am I the only one who thinks Eddie is looking very tired this video?
Next week is on the phone... Thor just got knocked into it they say...
Title of video is desolation of Thor and the title in the thumbnail is decimation of Thor
Take the mask off! It does nothing but show youre an obedient buffoon
it is so good to see eddie go from where he started to this, obviously doing well financially, achieved fantastic goals already so far and looking in great shape keep it up big man!
Good luck Eddie what ever the outcome can't deny the blood sweat and tears that has gone into it  been looking forward to it
I’m confused is it the desolation or the decimation of Thor?
Who is screening this and how much? Can't seem to get much info online?!
Sounds ill don’t pull out again
Damage will be done 💪💪
Fight Mr beast, beast vs beast 😂
Big Thor is going to obliterate you. Your underestimating him
Ballie the ed heast
His face look sick
When I used to compete I always got sick at the end of training cycles. I'm glad you have two weeks to get it out of your system.
Eastie the hed all
Eddie the hallbeast
Hallie the bed east
Hey brother good luck for the fight but I don’t think u need luck because I know u are going to nock him out anyways best of luck 😁
I so excited never wanted time to speed up this badly.
Was going to say there he sounds sick bad timing to get the cold
Good luck Eddie 💪💪💪
This fight should of been in Vegas with real refs.
Crush him Beast.
Shouldn’t it be DECIMATION? desolation is a feeling of emptiness 😂😂
Does anyone know where i can watch the fight and tell me whether its free or not?
damn eddie looks hella fit
What time is the fight?
Those glasses had me in stitches haha    on all seriousness I don't think thor has any idea what he is up against. Respect 💪👍
This is going to be the best series on YouTube PERIOD!! Can't wait to see Eddie smash thor 🥊🥊🥊 definitely creating a shortcut button to my home screen so just take me straight to Eddie channel 🔥🔥🔥
Let's go CHAMP🏆💪🏽
💪💪👍👍🤛🤛
Eddie gonna take a big poopoo on Thor
I honestly think Thor will take it!! I hope I’m wrong, who’s covering the fight ? Where can I watch it ?
Thor just seems out of condition and sloppy with his punches
The desolation of Smaug
Good luck brother
I remember your 500k deadlift how you had to go somewhere else mentally..I think you should do this with Thor but Thor just a small target you can smash itEddie👍👍👍
Hope you'll have a safe fight and "WIN".   :) Wasn't able to bring your dog with you?
Edd aslong as your  Hydrated!!!! Thats all that matters looking forward to you having a QUICK WIN over thor !!!!
Jake paul should fight the winner 😉
I’ve never wagered on a sporting event but I’m betting on Eddie by KO
Eddie, I hope you get over this little cold fast and by the day of the fight, you will be at 100% best shape of your life. Let’s get it 💪🏻
Everyone is so excited about the fight but I'm pretty sure it will be a short fight. I bet  the fight is over after the first round because Eddie will knock Thor out. Wish you all the best you are a inspiration Eddie good luck
Big gentle man
Let’s go BEAST !
Let's be honest. You aren't actually taking FULL advantage of this airline. You aren't eating their food!!!!!
The odds on this fight are shite beyond belief. No chance of making any real cash.
Yes Eddie I like a whisper gold too mate. Best of luck with getting rid of the cold and with the fight
Let’s Go Big E stomp him
Eddie's getting chinned big time....
Eddie I have faith u will nail it I have watched you for years an no matter what u always say what u will do am sure u will nail him 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Mr hall your going to smash him
Ohh ,look how I'm living..... With people suffering in Ukraine at the moment this guy is as self centered and vain as they come. Just an overgrown sense of his own importance. Look at me I'm in first class, ooohhh look at my Hotel it's all gold and glitter. What an asshole..
Let’s fuuuuucking gooooooo your getting Thor you big dosser
Just a heads up that desolation and decimation are in fact different words.
All the best Eddie, you pure Legend ❤
May the beast man win.
How heavy did he say he was
U should of done better boxing preparation Eddie Hall  Thor means business bro
Two of the world's strongest men beating the crap out of each other aka..."HEAVY WEIGHT RUMMBLE!". I can't weight!
Eddie you big dork, do you write your own youtube titles...is that an auto correct? " The desolation of Thor " but should be the  " decimation " of Thor? /facepalm
Covid
Nice one eddie 1st class
Desolation or decimation?
Can’t wait for the fight, come on Ed we want a straight knock out here! Team Beast!
Why the weight obsession Eddie? feels like you dont want to lose any and your training looks like its more wight training then boxing(i said looks like) You are not training to be the WSM anymore so why not drop to a more thealty weight?just wondering.
Go get him Eddie 😎❤️ I’ll send you some chocolate when you win.
Can't wait for the fight. Eddie 3rd round.
You should have Brian there antagonizing the shit out of you.
Ok. I've watched a lot of Eddie's videos now and at the risk of sounding dumb or too American, I have to ask; What is he talking about when he says physio? Is that like a physical therapist? Someone please answer lol. And fight well! this fight is going to be awesome!
Stay close and tight with thor. He will try and keep a distant...easy thing to do is get in, throw hooks to the body ... throw some to the head...stay tight and don't let him get the reach jab advantage. 👍
Shit's about to get real
I watched an old video of old Eddie and this man even in his face has gone from a huge strong man to a legitimate boxer respect
thor be watching trying to get in all the sleep he missed the last 2 years :'D
Eddie do you know if this fight will be on any sports books? I hope so because this should make me some easy money, Thor doesn’t stand a chance
Due to this fight beeing postponed so much, I'm kinda sad to admit but...I have 0 hype for this match. It now just feels like two influencers fighting (probalby a fake fight) and they will make a ton of money on it.   IDK just feels...meaningless, but yeah that's just me.
I live in Dubai, can we watch it live here?
Looking super fit
No doubt that Eddie will conquer thor. Best of luck, an hope all goes great
*DUDE EDDIE IS SO RELAXED AND FOCUSED.. CRACK THAT MOUNTAIN BUDDY 👊🏼🏔*
Stay hydrated
This fight is going to be like hulk vs Loki😂 Eddie is going to slap Thor around the ring
Eddie you will knock him out in 1 round  your power is massive
Please please let this fight happen. Eddie for the win..  Both guys are power houses. Will be an interesting fight
I really doubt Eddie has shown a good representation of his boxing on film. This is no different than strongmen not always showing the weights they are lifting. He doesn’t want Thor to have “game footage” and create plan to attack Eddie’s weaknesses. I would imagine Eddie is much better than what he has shown publicly
Best of luck, don't forget to hydrate!
Big up the Beast !! 💪👊
I'm so sad it is in Dubai! I wanted to see it in person. I'm rooting for you!!!
Can’t you take the Dog to Dubai?
I'm torn between the two in boxing skill. Thor has more technique, but Eddie more explosiveness. I so dearly want Eddie to win this
Best of luck to the BEAST!
*WHERE’S TRIPOD??!!*
Eddie you sound full of flu duck??
I can't belive its almost here. After the long wait its right around the corner all of a sudden 💪🏽.
Can't wait for you to win 💪
What's the excuse when Thor knocks you out
Get yourself under the lights as much as poss
I believe in you eddie. I know if i fought someone 6 inches taller than me it wouldn’t Fn matter.
Love this journey 😂💪
Desolation or decimation ?? Your thumbnail doesn't match Eddie 😎
Regardless of the outcome come back safe to ur family and fans  Eddie much respect from Manchester
Good luck Eddie
Watching this channel after 3months.....a
💪😎👍
Thor needs an attitude adjustment. He needs taken down a notch after the WSM BS he pulled in 2017.
I have better facilities in my room than Eddie's emirates flight, I can order anything from my phone. Have a fridge with lots of drinks. And thats how I cope with being poor😂
This big giant doesn't disappoint us in entertaining every bit of second ... swagger ! 👍🔥😀
.....and there it is....the excuse for when he loses to Thor......"trying to get this cold out of my chest" 🙄
You spoiled primadonna.... I travel 24 hours on planes on economy class... But I'm only 188 cm and 104 kg.... :)
He looks really sick, look at the dark circles around his eyes.
Easy fight for Thor
Make sure to be well hydrated when the fight begins mr. Hall!
Is it a ppv fight ?
I honestly don't think Thor knows what is in store for him.....
My hero mister Hall, i follow you for 6 years now, no doubt in my mind that you Will the one Who Will let the world see Who is the best..Thor is nothing against you my hero!!! Go Eddie
Plzzz vlog in Mauritius
Eddie is coming to Mauritius 🇲🇺 yessss
This is gonna b lit! Love u Beast
I can’t wait to see the press conference 😂 Team Eddie💪
Easy W
get better so you can beat thor down and show him what its all about
Good match Eddie i am rooting for u :)
Be awkward if Eddie and thor book the same hotel 🤣
Knock seven shades out of him Eddie!!!!!!!!!
You have, what we call "Muffensausen" here in Germany! Good Luck - You will need it!
Smash Thor… take no prisoners 👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
I have yet to see you spar like you know how to fight. I want you to win but you will get knocked the fuck out!!
Where do I Bet on this fight?
Take an extra week off for no excuses. Cuz someone will say something. I'll watch and shut the Fkkkkk up.
I havent seen thor fight or practice all that much (im here for entertainment and his content doesnt do it for me) but eddie has great form and im really looking forward to it. Kick his ass eddie
Eddie, ur a beast dude.  Thor fights like he's feet not connected to he's lower body.  You fight as one unit.  And it seems boxing is more natural to u.  Hope you win buddy!
Truly inspired by the body transformation Keep on working sir
I have no doubt in my mind that you 'floor the thor' - Your work ethic and discipline alone is unrivalled, to go with your mental game, talent, power and will to win. Absolute BEAST.
The fight day Vlog should be called “Ragnarok cometh”
All I can say is I hope there are some big seats 💺 😁🤪
Maybe instead of focusing on being chilled, you should focus on being hydrated.
Desolate? He's gonna be really lonely?
If the right is available to watch on Freeview so for free will it be ok e on your YouTube channel?
Doesnt sound like the back end of a cold
Hey Eddie, good luck for the fight, I know you will win it 😁 Does anybody knows where I can watch the fight?
Seen  thors training sessions there bad,you should  beat him in 5 rounds handy ,love videos Eddie, good luck  on the fight
It isn’t gonna be a boxing match it gonna be a slug fest
Great work sofar Eddie, just stay hydrated please
Love you Hannah, you are super beautiful and super cool!!!!you do a great job!!
Love you Eddie but you're going catch an L in the fight...
I hope you'll settle your fight outside the ring after this fight. Hoping for your win man, good luck
why doesn't your coach tell you to keep your guard up
A fcukin bar on a plane!! How the other half live hey!! And you better do a bit of boxing this week!!! We want you to win!!! COME ON THE BEAST!!👊💥
Eddie is literally an inspiration! He’s living proof that if you put in hard graft you shall succeed
Praying for you Eddie.  I know you'll win.
Can you do a quick collaboration  with Mike Thurston
Dayuuum you've lost a shit ton of weight my dude but your head still just as big as ever lol I can't wait to see thor get his shit rocked
You hardly post anything anymore Eddie.  Wish you posted more
Who’s Thor?
The hype for this is dead
Fold Thor in half and toss him into the crowd.
video title is on point
I cant believe its free to watch nice touch all my mates are saying both be blowing out your arses in 1 min ive said yea ok lads 2 years of training could easy do 6 rounds but wrkn u smash him in 1st round with a body shot
When's the fight
Good luck fella💪
Please win. So all thors yes men can move on 😂.. thors slimmed right down, so much so that I believe his tactic is for you to gas out.. so instead knock his skinny head off 😂😂
head down, overhand right.  repeat til one lands.  gg ez
Real Eddie is just as great as comic Eddie
Let's go champ!!!
Eddie, to fight Thor you need a good defense, he's faster so let it consume all stamina before attack
I have that same little thermos with the spoon under the mini bowl. I love that little thing
Where can we watch the fight, sorry I’ve been under a rock for a while 😂
I honestly hope Eddie doesn't gas out so quick, I understand wanting to come in heavy but not heavy/fat.
I’ve never been so excited about a fight! Between this match and the arm wrestling match between Devon and Levan, this is going to be an epic next couple months!
No more lazy hoohks  and  GOOD  LUCK
We believe in you Eddie, F..k the haters 💪👊
Rooting for you!
cheers eddie, enjoy
I want you to win but I'm having a hard time believing you can overcome Thor's massive weight, height, and reach advantage. If I never knew of you I'd bet on thor just due to those advantages he's got.   However, you have surprised the world time and time again so I'm hoping you can surprise us once more!
Decimation or desolation? Title vs thumbnail
I reckon Eddie will try to scrap,  Thor's looking the better technician. Who knows, could go anyway. I hope Eddie is ready for this, he might have to take a loss.
Whoever loses the fight should be humble and no one should complain, no excuses. Eddie Hall 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Ok honestly where can I bet on this match ?! Cant find it anywhere.
Good luck Eddie. Let the best man win. I hope you and thor can shake hands after your fight, bc I don't think thor is a bad guy deep down. I know he upset you and put a dampen on your dream, but life's too short to hold grudges. Good luck mate.
Eddie's breathing sounds rough. I think Thor's cardio is gonna be a problem for Eddie. I hope he can knock Thor out quickly before it can turn into a war of attrition.
😬😬😬😬 can’t wait to see the fight good luck Eddie
This journey for you gents is coming to a close, the only thing that Sucks about this whole situation is you 2 destroyed a good friendship!! I don’t know if you guys will be able to leave your differences in the ring and be Mates again!! Good luck either way I like the both of you lads!!!🤟😜
Desolation of Smaug was referring to the destruction caused by Smaug not actually destroying Smaug. We wanna see the desolation of Eddie, not Thor.
anybody know what time the fight will be?
I like how he was wandering how big he's head 😆 Good luck with the fight champ
Look fantastic bud. Good JU JU for you sir!!!
Why in Dubai??
So exited for this, good luck Eddie, my money is on you ✌️🎉
Is your bicep healed
I'll say it again,I like both you and thor,I hope you both fight well,then whoever wins,put this all to bed and both move on.
Meanwhile back in the gym thor is training like a real beast 💪 fukin hell Eddie I really hope your just having us all on and you have really been learning to box otherwise you are going to get shown up its not talking its fighting pal 👍
good luck Eddie. I've been watching your journey, be proud and I know you will do well.
Dam first class is like 20k as well lol
Yes My Man. Can't wait. Your dedication,  spirit and fighting mentality these days is second to none. Get well soon . (RIP Thor)
Hold your ball bag?!!🥺
Eddie  ,Thor is not at Arnolds ,he is in your big head beating the shit out of you.
Wishing you the best for the fight Eddie, also Mauritius is fab, me and the wife went to the Maratim Hotel the place is unbelievable
Thor thinks he is a Pro Boxer, don't Box him..smother his punches and swing Stoke on Trent street style on his ass!
Eddie looks always fresh and energetic while Thor looks like a slow bag of shit.
Im very interested in this event. And its not about skillwise.  Its all about mental aspect of it.Two different personalities, i would say they are totaly different in term of character.  Have fun guys!
How come when I YouTube Eddie hall, when I get to Eddie h, Eddie Howe comes up!? How much can he dead lift!!😂😂👍 Keep it up big ane!! Much love 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
CHEERING FOR EDDIE!!!
Is it desolation or decimation? The thumbnail and title are not in agreement 😅
Fight well Eddie hope both of you guys leave the ring safely.Thor is fully dedicated and training like a savage so don’t hang your head if you do lose.I will continue to support both of your channels no matter the outcome.Please show each other respect in there you are both phenomenal athletes.
Please take the piss out of everything on the plane on your way back after you've massacered Thor
It’s not a prediction it’s a spoiler ladies and gentlemen here is your winner the beast Eddie hall
About fucking time. All this sweet talk, pillow talk to each other. Hahaha don’t get hurt please both you
can't wait to watch you destroy thor.
Were in the Endgame now 💪💪💪
How can we watch the fight ??
Will be great to show the world, that two strong man world champions won't gas out.....I fully believe Thor will win on points....But it will be interesting
All the best big guy! Am routing for you. Salute from Canada!🇨🇦💪☺️👍
Hope you beat the hydration out of him
This title is gonna be funny to look back on if Eddie looses
Could still get called off again, I'm not sure until they touch gloves in the ring!
The Desolation of Thor and the Return of the Beast.
What channel will we be able to watch the press conference and weigh in on?
Wheres Josh????
Im gunna stick £100 on you Eddie. 🥊🥊cant see anything but a Win for The Beast.
After the fight they're probably gonna be inseparable friends 😆
I remember watching the first Eddie documentary when he mentioned about doing boxing after the WSM and he wife not been happy about it and yet here we are.
All that food, how long is that flight?
Who initiated the fight ?? Been that long I’ve forgot
eddie..get ur berrings right..u win that.
"Always back up your BS", hopefully you'll do it this time as well  Let the best man win, good luck to both of you 💪
This should have been called 'Ragnarok' or 'Jormungandr', which both caused the death of Thor in Norse mythology
THE BEAST is about to slay
Let Thor tire out keep up your guard.
You are going to get absolutely battered and served up some serious humble pie. Hopefully might humble you.
Come on Eddie !!
Eddie looks dehydrated
Luxury first class wearing customized crocs,
Team Eddie won last time. Team Eddie will win this time.
Hi Ed l love your videos and l hope you smash thor
Good Luck on the fight Eddie. Hopefully Thor apologizes, after the fight.
I am excited to see what Eddie can do when properly hydrated.
Knock him out
Actually the last 18 months I’ve actually grown to like Thor more ! Weird
How do you say going to have to attack Thor and get close to stores just gonna jab the shit out of them and big and he’s going to fall
Eddie looks nervous and scared
Come on Eddie your gonna Beat the Thor 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Hope you keep your guard up in the fight Eddie!
I'm so pumped for this!
Anyone know the time of the fight?
I wish Thor a speedy recovery ahead of time ♥️
Calling it now  Eddie's first video after getting KO'd by Thor will be titled "One Lucky Punch"
Don't doubt you for a second Eddie.  Hafthor has never had a real fight in his life.  Whereas you can tell you've had quite a few scraps in your time.  Punch his face in and get this settled. 👊👊👊👍👍👍
Stop pushing the COVID theater Eddie
It is starting to get exciting now .
First class flight? Not like you to blow your own Trumpet Eddie…
Can't wait to see the fruits of your long dedicated training! Good luck to ya beast!!!
Eddie you look amazing well done
Thor is probably on his own plane, so there's room for all the yes-men.
Where was the footage of the hotel?
Where was the big love the beast
Kick that ass...🤣
Jesus, the press conference, I forgot about that! God help the guy(s) who have to get inbetween you two to stop each other from fighting out the ring XD
Good too see ya Eddie! Lookin strong man!
M betting on u beast....just smash it n don't disappoint.....love n wishes from India 🇮🇳
rocky 6
With you all the way give him hell,Big up the beast
The build up to this fight has been crazy, I can imagine how happy I'll be when Eddie wins 💪
I can’t wait!!!! I wish it was this weekend. Press conference will be hilarious😂😂 I’m gonna bring in the popcorn😂😭
Don't take offense but you do appear quite anxious atm. I hope this dissapears in time for the fight. Cannot wait to watch it. Eddie to win.
I know you did videos with Wim Hof but you don't practice the breathing technique? You shouldn't be getting sick.
Thor was definitely at the Arnold's I was there and ran into him on the street I bet you wish you were me it was dark and I literally ran into him because I was playing with my phone and bumped right into him
Eddie I'm need the tshirt u have on can't find it online
Much love team beast❤❤💯💯
E
Eddie i'm sure you knows your stuff buti think you are too big to fight past round 3/4, i think you have to finish it early to win
RENT FREE
Good luck Eddie!
Eddie wears very funny glasses😎😅❤
I hope nobody gets seriously hurt during this fight
Eddie hall wins no question.. But win or lose this fight will be legendary and both fighters deserve respect. Good luck Eddie!
When did you go and see your brother in oz ? Not 3 years ago. Good luck in the fight , and do him over.
Eddie, when you get done destroying this big fool, come to the states and let's do dumb shit on motorcycles. Then you can get yelled at by our wives. Because, yeah, I'm that guy that never catches any of the blame. I'm just good like that.
Thumbnail says decimation not desolation. To decimate someone also seems to make more sense than to desolate someone. The desolation of Thor makes it sound like he is the destroyer. Just saying
Good luck my fellow oatcake eating stokie 🤣👍🏻
Jesus hasn’t this fight happened yet
Eddie I love u brother but I have a feeling ur gonna get folded
Hopefully u dont get injured again.
I cannot wait for the press conferences lol
Why do I have a feeling after you fly there, Thor will come up with some reason why he can't fight 🤔
so nice to see this fight finally happening after almost 2 years. best of luck to you eddie and good wishes to whatever you choose in your next venture in life.
pls make a vlog in dubai, have a great time there too Eddie!
Eddie for the W  you got this fight!
I hope you don't leave yourself too open for Thors counters Eddie! Hit hard and play it say, only go for the knockout when he's open
The only thing I fear is if you cut thor will they stop the fight or actually let it be a boxing match?
Can't wait to see the fight. Good luck to both you and Thor
Just come from Thor's video and saw a comment that Eddie is fat  Not exactly the word I would use.  Also I noticed Eddie has a relatively bigger neck than Thor does, at least it looks like it, so maybe if Eddie gets a nice good shot he can get Thor out of it.
just wanna know, if thor gets in the same hotel , will we  see a sparring in the hallway?! much respect for both (from austria)...
Thor koi’s Eddie 3rd round
However..... Never underestimate Thor... He may surprise you.... Just be prepared for WAR!!👊🏿👊🏿🙏🏾🙏🏾
Very surprised the fights free. ohwell not complaining!
You got this CHAMP!! Almost Showtime!!!👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿
Big Fan from Mauritius🇲🇺❤️❤️❤️
EDDIE BUMAYE !
Will there be an undercard?
This whole ordeal has been so weird to pick a camp for. On one hand, Eddie is fully justified in being pissed off with how Thor handled 2017. On the other hand, he's been acting like a petty baby for the 2 year training period and all he has to show for it is good cardio. Unlike Thor who at least looks like he can box a little bit. Eddie still has the power at least.
As long as Eddie is hydrated it’s gonna be one smooth fight
Cant wait Eddie  all us stokies  are behind you all the best
Young Wilf says "Go Full Beast" in the fight.
Eddie you best slaughter him  i know you will, your fighting on my birthday im turning 20 all the best matey!!!
Never forget that Hafthor Called out Eddie for cheating the win of world strongest man 2017. May the best one win the fight
This so called fight will be gash. Two big lumps blowing after two rounds 👎
Cannot wait for this finally! And it's free which is amazing, this will be absolute war
Love the vids.  Drop the masks.  Stay healthy
Thor is going down in the 2nd round. He’s got too much breadbasket exposed for taking on a low, powerful puncher like Eddie.
Good luck all the best
When the press conference at?
team eddie all the way🥊
Go eddie you got this
Win or Lose this about to be the best fight
It's nice to see Eddie chilled out and calm.
I really dont know what’s gonna happen in the fight but I just hope all the work comes good for both of you and it’s a proper show! Wish you luck Eddie!!
1am in the morning is my fave time
“Recovering from a cold” get the excuses out now lmfao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thor will win.
Have a nice trip and make it to Dubai safely I hope you have trained well and all the best to you Eddie you will already beat Thor 💪🏻❤🥊🙏🏻🥇
Good luck Edd
Go get him eddie
I feel bad for Thors liver, prime height for punching.
Please, please don’t underestimate Thor. He looks night and day from when he first started. Let the best man win, good luck to both sportsmen!
Eddie use your influence to get mars delights brought back out mate , thats what the people want and deep down I think you want it too
Unleash the beast!
I think the difference is that Eddie hit twice as hard. He does put to much weight on his front foot coming in and that could stop his forward movement letting Thor get of some punches. Go Eddie!
Not that you need it big man but,chill then destroy that mountain in to rubble. all the best Eddie.🥊💪🏼👊🏼
Saw him on the live stream, looking sickly. He doesn't look good at all! 😂😂 Needs a cheeseburger or something........
God has finally returned
Come on Eddie 🏆 may Thor be humbled
💪Beast smash 🤜💥 You got this brother 👍🏻
Eddie, thank you for wearing a mask mate! Genuinely thank you for proving that it's not a impact on your human rights and that it in-fact the bare minimum we can do to keep eachother safe 🤜
Desolation?
so exciting!!!
Hopefully not another excuse for not fighting Thor.. I have a cold 🥶
XD
0:45 the excuses start already...
Crocs? CROCS? LOL go get em champ. Looking forward to the fight and beyond. It's been a long two years following this journey and it's been exciting.
👍
Are you finally done fucking talking?!? Actually gonna right now??   Great!
So Thor is Smaug and Eddie is one of the dwarfs :) lol
How do they make money if the fight is free, anyone know.
Been following both yours and Thor's training and this this is the first time I've ever placed a bet, first round knockout by Eddie, quite a substantial amount too!  Level that disrespectful prick Eddie!
Good luck fella…
Take Care eddie and go full power!!!
fight predication, both of them trying to land windmills for the first two rounds, completely fucked and drained from not controlling the adrenaline of the situation they are both fucked and hug each other for the remaining rounds and then everyone wonders why they pay any money to watch two people box badly
Good luck Eddie lad
Go fuck Thor up mate
Best of luck Eddie. :)
Careful man he's gonna jab like a real pro boxer and run a marathon around the ring, don't face tank everything 😆
Good luck Eddie
I come here to get inspired. Eddie deserves all the success!
must of been a heck of a plane to be able to lift them balls of steel lol
I’ve got a 100% faith in Eddie winning  this fight . Enjoy your training camp champ 👍
he is going to smash thor
What you there 21stone 🤔 continued to watch 24 stone 5 ..you don't look it 🙃
Good luck Eddie.
Eddie started this mess in the real truth.  I saw both sides do I know... That's why I hope Eddie loses.
Thor has been in fights. Experience usually wins.
Go get him brother!!
I'm curious to see how you'll overcome Thor's height and reach advantages. This is going to be *GREAT.* Fight well, Eddie!!
Can't believe this journey is coming to its end my friend! Thank you for letting us be a part of it. Will be rooting for you and can't wait for the next adventure.   Much love for the Beast!
Well is it decimation or desolation? 😄😄
Knock his block off!
I just wanna see thor cry like he did at the WSM, probably gonna call you a cheater again after he wakes up from the KO.
One day I will meet you and that's it
Desolate Thor 💪🏻
pin my comment!! i cant get hydrated until you pin my comment eddie!!!
You got this !! I believe in you big man! 💪🏻❤️ Ps  Make sure your costume isn’t too heavy 😉😜😂
Eddie for the win, I heard a comment where someone said thor lost so much weight he looks like a cancer patient 🤣🤣stay strong beast 🤘
Eddie definitely getting the W💯💯
Easy win brother!
You gon get him and you gon get him good.
Good luck dude. Routing for you!
