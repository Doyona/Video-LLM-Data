In what kind of turbine is a fish most likely to survive?  In a Kaplan wheel or Francis wheel turbine? In my province, many old Hydro-Québec turbines have been replaced in a quest for efficiency. The whole following video is very interesting but At 9:09 for my question .Merci! there https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF6GINyjFcs
"I know that the human being and fish can coexist peacefully,"
Lamprey are nightmare fuel Kind of remind me of the langoliers

Lol fish huggers
17:19 Fish Abduction Stories: Dude, you're never going to believe what just happened to me!
Momma sayd they are up on the farm now.. 😢
Fantastic.
Is it possible to create run-of-the-river dams across most major rivers? What are the drawbacks and why don't we see them more often? Could you chain them together and make 5 in a row?
Imagine that fish that got caught and had installed sensor inside. Then goes back to other and tell stories about being abducted and experimented on by some alien creatures.
17:35 they turned fish into generators💔💔💔 This is accually so funny to me cuz what do you mean they turned those silly little guys with the amount of braincells equal to how many theres days in a week into electrical power generating machines while still keeping them alive and silly💔💔💔
Maybe the fish survive, but they are changed inside.
Bedankt
"and this pipe leads the fish pulp to the factory"
I'm deeply impressed by the stuff engineers think about and those fish- watching Windows are awesome 👍
Its hard to believe we waste so much time and money on this when Nuclear power is so much more efficiant and has far less environmental impact.
lampreys,,,who cares about them
NOOOOOOO
fih
17:37 -- Is this how sushi is made? 🤔
I'm not even going to watch this.  I live in the first electrified city in Canada and the hydro dam is super close to where I live.  Along with a whole museum that explains everything from this video and much more.  I mean, where else can you walk inside the pipes of a 1901 central?  I love my city so much and I love living surrounded by water
How do peoplle survive continuios bombing and how it affects if we dont stand up and speak on it . Can you do a video on that .
thus video first made me need to know what a fish pump is and then told me in detail. thanks grady ❤️
I gotta say never thought one of my favorite channels would make a video around my home town. Gotta say I learn alot from your videos and apply some of your knowledge in my work. Keep it up boss
Ok not the hydroelectric propoganda…. Damns and Hydroelectric are NOT clean energy, theres a reason Indigenous groups rally against these structures!!
If something makes power and spins, it’s GE. They love spinny things :)
I helped repair Oroville.
I needed a new channel to binge. I told YouTube to give me a new show to binge. You showed up in my feed. You are now being binged.
Very cool I live close to McDonald's
Nebula ain’t cutting it for now
There are basically two ways Washington state (outside of Seattle) is mentioned in media: Mount St. Helens, and hydropower.
I love how you used the mcnary  dam

The best Dam tourer guide I ever met 😂❤
What if  a person  eats a fish  with a sensor from it ?  the battery ?
Tur-BINE
Turbin or turbine?
Great video just really confused where the turbans come in👳🏾‍♂️
Dam, he really outdid himself with this back-of-the-garage model this time
This video was dam interesting.
0:29 that one day when i dont bring my rod
side inlet of water from the river with  blockage of fish
I'm just here for the dam fish.
the best dam tour guide .. i love the puns lol
I would be nervous as heck being that close to a metal pipe thing spinning that fast.
All we have to do is remove the dams and build nuclear plants. But we need to do this 40 years ago when most people were against both.
I love the brilliance that can emerge when we put our minds to it. When you mentioned the piezoelectric battery system I literally said out loud "Oh that's so cool!!" An absolutely elegant solution to battery life limited by size.
All polished, clean, shiny old turbines and the overall condition of the infrastructure in tandem with a compassion for the surrounding wildlife is EXACTLY WHY IM PROUD TO BE AMERICAN. With all our differences in philosophies, that’s something I think we can all agree on…
Wish they’d send a camera through the turbine so we can see it spinning in the water
3:20 that railing should be yellow NOT grey..... call OSHA.!!!!!!!
Thanks that was really interesting
whats the site to see the fish window
What a cool job
This just gives me such hope for humanity. When we can solve issues without disturbing the wildlife we enjoy and depend on—it’s just beautiful.
I’m curious what the earths water systems would look like without dams moving water how many lakes would be naturally filled and filtered throughout the original river systems
this homie already dont have a strong current and large flow rate.......you just build to close river and producing low capacity
Who doesn't love a good fish pump
"An informed opinion is better than an oblivious one." You realize that this is the Internet you are saying that on.
But isn't the point of a dam like everything else in life, to destroy and get revenge mother nature? Why would it betray its purpose like that?
thank you for a great video！
cool
you can literally see the passion and joy the workers in the video have in their work and it makes my heart swell 💚
@4:22 okay I know I am late to the game here but pink salmon are not native to the columbia river... the other species of salmon yes they run that river but there are no pink salmon.
What an amazing video. I’m 26 and have been in and out of college for different reasons. I’ve wanted to be an engineer since I was younger without knowing it. Leaving this here as proof that I WILL be an engineer one day.
Dont worry Trump Kraznov has fired all scientists working on environmental science. Luckily China is running full page ads head hunting American scientists and FBI agents that are VERY MUCH in demand. Wonder why. This regime doesn't care about security or American lives never mind the environment for our future generations. As king as Trump can get more bribes he happy.
That's why Chinese build Fust, they don't care about all of this just build.
2 minute into 😅Good thing I watch at 2x
Literally, who the hell cares?
I’m a diver I work on a ton of traveling water screens. Lots of power plants don’t have the head room to pull them out so we rebuild the bottom end underwater. The underwater traveling screens are awesome
Fish Bible! FISH JESUS!!!!
Best “dam” tour guide, beautiful pun
Let’s go on the DAM tour
2:23 I literally spit out my coffee I was not expecting that bit 😆
2:19 nice
You'd think that fish would learn about dams in their schools.
Thank you. I love your videos.
Never knew the true significance of giant turbans before watching this video! Chiquest turbines I ever saw! Loved the video, thanks!
👍👍
"Best dam tour guide I've ever met" love it
please don't advertise. you are one of the very few who makes vids to educate, not to sell stuff.
How many other people watch Practical Engineering just to hear the best dam jokes on YouTube?
I just came across this video, and as always with this channel, it's very informative and exciting! I'm genuinely grateful that professional channels with high-quality content like Practical Engineering exist on YouTube.  Now, this is just a minor detail that one could easily dismiss, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with the statement "the powerhouse... is nearly a quarter mile long, more than 350 meters." But since a quarter mile is 402.34 meters, this statement introduces an inaccuracy of approximately 52 meters (or 171 feet), which is about 15%—quite a bit. I understand that long distances are difficult to express in feet and that it’s common practice in the US to round to a fraction of a mile, but in meters, it’s easier and clearer to simply state the exact length. After all, most of the world (except for some people in the US) intuitively understands precise distances in the metric system and can easily round them for abstraction themselves if needed.  Anyway, just a thought—thanks again for the great work! 👍
How could we design them to shred the fish? Asking for a friend
Where can i see live feed of fish going through that window??
It’s amazing to see how much work goes into keeping the wildlife safe. Love it
respect to the researchers and engineers working to make hydropower more sustainable
At alaska or somewhere there the king salmon or some great fish specie was speculated declined because of killer whale were eating them. They maintain their temperature in cold water by eating much of those fish. Maube fishing those orcas out of the river area could revitalize the chinook/king salmons?
So interesting ☺
This is so sweet, and beautiful. Increased my faith in humanity, and the belief that human coexistence with the rest of the life on our planet is not just possible - but likely.
Imagine catching and cleaning a fish only to find out it's a cyborg
3:00 1.21 GIGAWATTS!
"To what we already know about the limit fish can withstand", See I don't imagine the obvious, instead I imagine...  "Experiment number #047, and begin"  *Fish explodes*  *Scientist clears throat*  "Lowering PSI by 5"  "Experiment number #048..."  etc.
The goal is preserve the ecosystem as good as possible, so they considered a single animal…cool
The timing is impeccable, and the narrator’s voice and diction are spot-on!
Here I am eating salmon. The internet musta smelled it cookin.
Yep. That " simple question" can be way more than that. Been doing trees 34 yrs. Still get people who ask: " How much does it cost to remove, or trim a tree?" Must be the same people who ask:" How much does a car cost ?"

Beavers build dams, and change the environment, sometimes to the demise of other species, it's all ok, because they are" beavers" , " natural animals". Man does his thing( with concrete, steel, etc) and suddunly, it's " bad for the ecosystem". Leave it to us , to ruin the planet.
boring. tell about dem fishes
17:35 - that is the coolest thing I've heard of !!!!  Fish powered tags!!
tl;dw they put a sign at the bottom of the riverbed pointing to a secret tunnel
“I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.” -George W. Bush
Wish PG&E/California cared enough about salmon and steelhead to create fish ladders up the Feather River. All the hydro dams are cool but i would love to see steelhead and salmon back up here in their native waters.
As a Western Washington resident, I was just about to suggest you check out the flood control systems between Pierce and King Counties. There's a _lot_ of infrastructure in place to prevent the devastating seasonal floods that used to happen when large, short rivers drain snowy mountains in a Marine West Coast climate. Many of the rivers have been diverted into others, or left to become lakes, and there's also a network of dams and flood control channels... and the Lake Washington Ship Canal is actually peripherally affected by all of these changes!
Unfortunately even with these advancements, California Chinook are going extinct..
It makes no sense to me that the army corps of engineers build infrastructure (so publicly funded infrastructure projects) and yet private companies get to run them and profit off of them, so your taxes build the facility and then you have to pay a monopolised bill to the energy supplier your taxes helped not only set up the company but built the infrastructure as well, American neoliberalism is so dumb
"How fish survive hydro turbines?"  SHORT ANSWER: They don't.
I often wondered about this!
Its always been about relative expense.  In the old days we didnt have a good energy infrastructure, and this made everything much more expensive om terms of human labor. Alot more sweat and blood back then. The extra infrastructure to accomodate fish would have had a more direct human cost in those terms.  Compare that to today where in addition to requiring much less labor, our economy is more developed. i.e. its harder to be notice or be bothered by the fact that your random daily goods may cost a penny more for this regulation and a penny for that regulation.  The regulation around this stuff needs to be very mindfully written, very responsive to improvements in the industry, and with a constant eye on efficiency (when you're involved in governance it's easy to get carried away in your ideals, see: "FIA").. But really though, places where this isn't done end up never seeing new infrastructure built, which leads to things like water shortages/rationing or rolling blackouts.
Best dam tour guide lol brilliant 😅
This is what it must feel like to be grey aliens dealing with our stupidity
Summer 2024 we tried going on a tour of Gavins Point Dam and they were closed due to covid.  😂  covid= the great excuse.
Oh god I can not get over the way they pronounced turbine. Like turban, Bine bro ITS FKN BINE LIKE BYNE BYE. YE BYNE BINE NIEN BINE. Guh Americans I apologise but you are unintentionally the most irritating English speaking country, for spelling and pronunciation
It is a TURBINE not a TURBIN.
1:03 con. trav. er. see. all. Nailed it.
Love these Practical Engineering episodes.. Thank you for taking the time to do these videos..
This will all be solved with WaFi. Wireless water is the future. To explain simply, convert water to vapor, transfer over fast speeds and condense back into water. The largest competitor is the Jetstream.
I wish the number of fish that make it back to red fish Lake in Idaho to spawn were increasing.  There are still very few fish that make it back to the headwaters of the salmon river. I can see these people have put a lot of work into modifying the dams, but I’m not sure how effective they’ve been.
It is quite refreshing to see that such concerns are addressed!  Thanks for sharing!
Steelhead salmon?  Sounds like your talking about splatoon to me
Turban
Mcnary Dam woot woot!
Right now I know
Thanks!
does this work for human body's?
Better title [why fish no turn soup in water rotator]
It is so weird as someone who lives in the Great Lakes region to see efforts aiding sea lamprey in traversing the river. The Lakes are one of those places where they're massively invasive, and decades of work has gone into removing them. And still the best we can do is managing their population numbers
I'm studying to be a fisheries engineer so this is perfectt for me
My Grandfather worked at the Duke Power dam in Gaffney SC. His used to bring home some of the biggest carp . we could eat for weeks on fish. Probably why he and Grandma were so healthily.
Factorio needs hydro electric dams
Fish
Most impressive! It is like the Moonshot spread all over the landscape. The control structures at Old River, Louisiana, were on the scale of the launch pads at Cape Canaveral. Americas water systems do not get the recognition they deserve.
great video, really informative! however, i can't help but wonder if the focus on fish survival is overshadowing the impact of hydro turbines on local ecosystems. while it's important to protect fish, shouldn't we also consider how these turbines affect other wildlife and plant life in the area? it seems like a bigger picture that deserves more attention. what do you all think?
Civilizations thrived for hundreds of years with no dams though 🤔
I wonder how many people got that ? " The best dam tour guide i ever met "
Tim is very handsome...
Several years ago I interviewed for a job at the John Day Dam down river from the McNary. The hiring manager gave me a complete tour of the dam and I was greatly impressed. He said that projects are “all about the fish”, which makes sense because those dams were originally designed to make power. There was a better candidate, so I’m not sorry about not getting the job, but I was impressed by the people who operate and the people who maintain the dam. Amazing infrastructure and great attention is paid  to the wildlife that inhabit the river.
"Fish generally don't read signs", but APPARENTLY they've got a whole Fish Bible, so one imagines the problem isn't fish literacy, but that fish are just plain lazy and unobservant. Tsk tsk!
Engineer Hiram M. Chittenden was ahead of his time when he included a fish ladder in what is now called the Ballard Locks in Seattle, WA.  They were started in 1910.
Since when US is conscencious.
I love the fish window 😂😂😂❤❤❤
They don't survive. Video done.
18:09 What was the question?
Wow you look really happy and this looks like it was a really good day learning about something very interesting.
Why don't they just cover the outlet .? It will reduce the predation concentration.
My serious question is this: do we care about the fish because they were successful over millions of years of evolution and have a right to be here under what should be reasonable or at least natural conditions and because they’re awesome creatures we owe our beginnings to? Or do we care about the fish because the power generation industry isn’t allowed to damage the commercial fishing and sport fishing industries or do damage to property values/land capital? lol
Love you man. Thanks for adding to the greatness of the Internet
Yes he's the best dam tour guide ever indeed
so he did not want to tell the survivability rate...
Glad liberals are so passionate about fish. Now deal with human life, the abortion issue...
9:25 just because it’s native doesn’t mean we should keep it around.
I have lived along the Roanoke river in Roanoke rapids NC All My life I'm 60 years old and remember my dad would take me and my brothers to fish in the tail race  i grew up going there to fish and remember seeing dinomite holes along the race , they would blast out the tail race  about a mile long while the natural river flowed  it's way ,then they opend the dam and blocked off the river  and viola it started and make electricity 😮❤
You guys have build Great Infrastructure as well as keeping in mind for the Environmental (flora&fauna) Destruction in the process and for the future. Mine out here in INDIA is a total opposite we have built Hydro power plant clearly to generate electricity and abuse the resources.They give a  dam-care about the Environment issue as well as to  those Human settlement who are living upstream and downstream of these massive Block of Concrete and Steel. Our Reality is sad and depression  Cause we are Blessed with all Four Seasons 🙏
Dams destroy river ecosystems. Don’t ever forget it.
The double entendre with the "he's the best dam your guide ever" always makes me laugh
Maintaining those dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers is a huge waste of money and resources.  Instead of spending resources on how to keep the dams we should be spending resources on finding alternatives to the dams so they can eventually be removed, and constant waste of money and other resources can come to an end.
Super corny AF guy . Spread some more cheese on this cracker 😅
The engineers, were they the best dam engineers for the job?
I rember implanting fish with accoustic transponders a solid 10 years before the study shown in the video. We also sebt fish through a sinulated turbine. Takes me back to the only job id go back to
Lol at the best dam tour guide
I would 100% watch if they live streamed that fish window lol
👳🏻‍♂️
Oh I see why Practical Engineering never changes those intro songs.. they cost like $29 a piece to license lol
hello
Thank God you explained what that robot fish tail in a box was for
This need to be in multi episodes.. peice meal please..Thanks❤
why not build tesla valve?
2:23 and the best dam tour guide i have ever met
Bro I am not watching 20 minutes just to find out how fish survive hydro turbines💀
Do we really need a 22 min video? I just want to know about the fish
I want to ride the fish highway
Only none or low reservoir dams are ok, the ones that create big lakes to power them are always horrible for the environment AND humanity (destroy the old habitat upsttream by raising water level, destroy the one below forever, at least close by by creating an unstable habitat, alter river directions faster, mess up with quifier and water distribution and area moisturre maps, create landslides, etc)
i live a mile from the Mcnary Dam! that's so cool!
You know what that means?       Fish.
"How Fish Survive Hydro Turbines?" - that's the rough part, they don't.
We must protect such things from that highfalutin Vladimir Putin and his dastardly band of chaos creating bots over yonder in Russia!
Fish
My Salute to science to save nature. 🙏🙏🙏
I have to give the engineers high marks that they took the time and expense to cooperate with nature.
He looked ecstatic to be in a dam lol. Engineer in his natural habitat.
It's ter-byne not turbin
If I have a choice between fish or power, screw the fish.
Who pays for all these systems that don't make profit?
They don't.
you guys are funny wearing the hard hats over top of the model, thanks !
All this talk about turbans is sihk as hell
Please someone tell them to put an Ip camera watching that window. Man itd be sooo coool to have a live stream of the fishies
It's the most fascinating video that I've watched lately. Thank you!
The thing about hydro power is the ability to ramp it up or down based on load. Solar and wind are good alternatives but we don’t have the technology yet for adequate storage on such large scales. Imagine the size of the battery banks needed.   Hydro power generation can be quickly lowered when the demand is lower and ramped up when the demand grows. It’s one of the best and cleanest methods of power generation we currently have. Nuclear is a whole other conversation.
_i got a lot of footage of people talking, so i can show it to you whether you like it or not_
Something that came to mind.. the battery powered tags especially. How do these effect the fish that eat said fish with the tag....
Who’s paying for this? Hopefully not tax payers. Should be funded by those that directly benefit; fishing industry, recreational fishers, environmentalists, etc.
Before they considered the fish they built the dams on some of the rivers and literally killed all the salmon, I don’t know how long it takes for  new native population to manifest but I’ve heard some still have yet to repopulate…..We’re lucky we were able to fix the problem as well as we have…it really is shining star in the history of conservation successes:….which is something…..
Why the heck would they be catering to a parasite (lamprey). that would be like trying to save mosquitos.
So, in other words, the McNary Dam can power half a million homes but, not a flux capacitor...
tony stark arc reactor can produce 3 gigajoules
but can't survive from human's taste.
Well I thought if a fish goes to a turbine they just got obliterated.
I live in Oregon and it's important to me
Why do you say Turbine like that?
Fish don't survive turbines. They just decommissioned one in my area because chopped up fish were washing up on beaches everywhere
Its very hard to understand this language ...kindly  Make your language such that everyone can understand well any place of the world
Well dam! 🦫
3:20 Man, all I could think about there was that if you were to fall up the last step of the stairs in the wrong way you could get your head ripped clean off.
As a Student currently studying Civil Engineering. I got to know about that making big dams comes with its own negatives. We should consider all the aspects and its effect on nature.
Great video, seeing all the machinery and equipment at the dam was fantastic.
Daaaaaam
This is how you do a dam correctly. Wish most were ran and designed like that.
Why do these videos have a barely audible sound effect in the background? Its so annoying otherwise ruining a video i want to watch
The engineers that work on the damm May have thought of this already..  I AM NOT AN ENGINEER!😅   ..But what do you think?  Is it possible to make  "the submersible screens" arranged like an "conveyor belt" and automaticaly cleaned after every water-passage? 🙃 It looks like the screens are made of thin rods tightly arranged, wires would be easier   to maintain, but "the conveyor belt"-structure may become a problem instead, who knows? 🤔
And to think I almost didnt watch this. Well done like always Grady! I have a friend who conducts fish studies that can turned into useful models for these type of applications. It's fascinating and this was a wonderful piece
“Best dam tour guide”
“Best dam tour guide I’ve ever met” 😂
To anyone reading this, please pray for my recovery and send positive vibes my way.
By gum that thumbnail looked like a pelvis! I was very confused for a moment after reading the title and seeing the fish approaching.
That quite interesting. They have come a long way with their tech to protect the migrating patterns. One part I’m curious about is, are the current systems able to encourage and sustain an increasing migration population? Like to get populations back to pre-dam numbers.
Turbans are head wear...turbInes are used in power generation...
This video gives message that Science doesn't choose to murder, Humans choose to murder.
I will make not one dam joke. Ok. One. But that's it! I'm done!
Oh you should totally do a video on the Hydraulics Lab at the U. S. Beuearu of Reclamation. They have tons of dams built in small scale to study erosion!
"the best dam tour guide"😂😂
Not a matter of solving.   Getting to 80 percent takes 20 percent effort. Getting to the point of diminishing returns, and balancing impact vs effort is the way to go.
2:22. The best dam tour guide I ever met. I see what you did there! :))
I remember back in the 90s at the Glen Canyon Dam you could take an elevator down and see one of the turbine shafts behind a glass wall, after 9/11 though they closed that off to the public.
Can you talk about instrumentation  in your next video
It could be a 10 seconds video "Simply, they don't!"
It's really wiggin' me out that you say "turbine" like "turban".
Had no idea you could anesthetize  a fish , like wow speechless indeed.
this video is  click baited and YouTube doesn't allow us to highlight such videos so that people don't waste their data on a click bait.
The dams in the pacific nw are awesome! Its too bad they are dolng  there best to tear them out! Need the dams !
I keep looking at the thumbnail and thinking its some kind of medical diagrams of something really messed up with someones pelvis
15:55 fish tumbling through the turbine is the funniest thing
Turban
Imagine what it's like for the fish. Thye're just moving downstream, chilling, when suddenly they get slurped up and guided comfortably through the Fish Maze before being plonked comfortably downstream.
Great video about the engineering side of this.  It would have been interesting to hear some of the results though. Is all of this investment actually working? Are salmon runs increasing? Sadly, I don't think the answer is 'yes'. The Columbia river system used to have salmon runs in the millions (estimated to be around 16 million in the mid 19th century). The average is now 660,000.
What a waste of resources which increases the cost of the energy so that a few salmon eaters can continue to eat them.
No one:  Fish bible:
"Much of this wasn't even thought of when the dam was built." That's what I love about engineering; we don't abandon things because there are problems, we solve the problems
Short answer: They don't. Long answer: They do not.
Aeration, we treat fish bowls better than Rivers below dams
Dams have spillways and use screens in front of turbines to divert fish.  Also, fish ladders allow fish to swim upstream past the dam.
So did you cut to the chase and get a round number of what percent of fish make it too and from their spawning ground annually? Or did you let me get away with saying, "it's complicated."   Is it about what? 3%? I just googled it
This was in my mind for long time, thank you for the information 😅
The CORRECT WAY TO PRONOUNCE TURBINE IS tur·bine NOT TUR•BIN
non tutti i dialoghi sono coi sottotitoli in italiano
Short answer, they don’t.
It so amazing how open people were during this cooperation. I never imagined how much science is behind this. Thank you for sharing this new way of thinking: coexists with nature needs more scientists. <3
Silt is the base of the food chain for river life and our coastal wetlands.  That's why dams have to be eliminated.
i always wondered about how fish survive the dams, now it makes alot of sense
Very interesting............. Impressive group there at the dam taking time to educate folks like that.
Sooooo, how do the sturgeon get through?
Is this a God Dam? -Beavis
I thought this was going to be a 2 second video: "they don't"
sure damns have drawbacks but i'd rather have hydro power than coal power
click bait 🐂 💩
I built a dam in the creek that runs behind my place.  Hoping one day to rig up a turbine to make electricity from it, but for now it's just fun having a huge pond with all the fish and critters and just a nice water hole to play in.
now we know where to fish salmon :D
Tear all dams down, we don't need them. /S
Funny ill be driving  past this dam on my way to the coast "the more you know"
Would you consider doing a video explaining how the airflow of an electric table fan deteriorates over time but magically picks up after washing the fan blades and fan guards?
It is unreal how the masses don’t give the environmental impact of dams a single thought while they obsess over carbon dioxide, a natural part of the earth which is essential for life.
"What's your job" "I sit in a concrete room and count fish for 8 hours a day"

How fish survive turbine? They don't!
TL;DR They don't.
"The best darn tour guide ive ever met"
Appreciate your work.
Next year fish counting will be done by AI.
AI joke: 'What did the fish say when it hit a wall?' 'Dam'
Its 4am, what the f*ck am I doing Here 🤣
Best dam tour guide lol
Grady, I always love your videos. Always something to learn.
I dont know, do we really need salmon?
Turban? I've never heard a turbine be called a turban.
Fish tube!
I'd love to learn more about the design of the newer turbines and how they're designed to improve fish survivability.
You say "turbine" is such a weird way. Like you are saying "turban"
Great DAM video!
Call me impressed. I did not know, how much even american dam operators care for wildlife. I hope this spreads to more areas of industry. Researchers are the ones who improve our world. Engineers build those solutions. Huuray for science!
thank you for sharing these very interesting facts
"Fish generally don't read signs..." The implication that there are some fish that do in fact, at times, read signs. 😮 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣💀
Do dams in china have this too?
I assumed they simply don't. But apparently that was far off.
"Fish generally don't read signs."  Wait. Are you saying there are some that do?
All those dams on the Columbia river, i guess they just accepted it would destroy boat use of the river when they decided to build them all?
So, if the Americans can work out how to get salmon past dams, why can't the "world's happiest" Finns do it, instead of demolishing useful dams- just to help the environment for salmon? Happy but dumb?
1.21 gigawatts?!!!! Great scott!
I want a video about alternative methods of moving the fish, like salmon cannons  They’re just a little airborne, they’re still good!
Fish generally don't read signs......but you always have that one fish who thinks he's better than everybody else and has to show off his literary skills.
Turbine and Turban are different things America
Where can I find a gentle jump? Will they jump for my love?
most dams have fish stairs.
This is extremely interesting, and I'm glad to see relatively effective implementations of fish bypass structures. But I would love to see more about species that aren't salmonoids, especially sturgeon as they have a much more difficult time passing through these structures on account of their morphology and larger size. If there aren't accommodations for these larger/more diverse types of fish I would love to see if there's any research being done to create effective solutions for these species.
back in  2009 I saw the ''fish ladder'' in Pitlochry, Scotland, with a set of 34 cascading pools, enabling the inbound salmon to dodge the power dam - guess this is similar to what is shown here
Wow! I had no idea! I’m so proud of humanity for the effort they put into developing all these things to make fish safe and happy.
Dam fish, always requiring so much infrastructure
This is crazy to see, i work litteraly a few miles from there at the Amazon Data Centers in the area

8:26 - They need to point a webcam at that window, and put it up on their public outreach website; people love that kinda stuff.
I've got a question,  is this a God Dam?
Oh man its so cool at 0:23 to see a dam that i know and is right in my backyard. Feels like im seeing a celebrity 😂
Doesn't "protecting" the fish from the Birds, harm the birds?
Fascinating. I just love this series.
I drive by McNary dam all the time on my way to work! Its crazy to think you might have been touring that dam while I was just a couple miles away.
Love your videos. They are always interesting!
Videos like this really need a TLDR. Soooooooooooo boring
Is there an extended version of this tour available on a subscriber channel?
*turban*
subbed to Nebula, the content will be lots of fun for my mom to watch while she is home.
Check out the Holyoke Gas and Electric fish lift if you're ever in Massachusetts! Real easy to set up a tour
video way too short, feels like a teaser, really. =)
I ALWAYS WONDERED THIS

You should visit Seattle some time. There’s a very very cool bridge at Deception Pass about 1.5 hrs north of Seattle.
My ancestors lived on Volga river, Russia. Somewhat around 1900 my grand*3 father caught Beluga - biggest kind of fresh water fish, that weights around 1 tonn. He got around 100 kilos of caviar out of it. He sold  just one this fish and bought a small ship afterwards.  In 50-70s Volga river got a lot of dams, so these basically fresh water whales couldn't swim upstream anymore, so story of my ancestors can not be repeated anymore.
Buddy turned a 5 minute response into a 22 minute lecture, I’m good thanks
I used to live in Umatilla Oregon which is just east of the dam and mcnary. I remember as a kid going to the little view room and watching all the fish swim by. So awesome to see this dam in a video!!
Who do i talk to about fishing the fish ladder🤨🎣
I had the privilege of being shown around a huge dam complex in the Western US.  I found the fish ladder and fish counting room really interesting.  So was the operating room, I’d never seen so many electrical buses on panels before.  It amazes me how hard salmon work, and how perfectly they navigate, to get back to the exact stream-bed to spawn where they were born.  After a lifetime of living in the much saltier oceans, too.  One time there was a huge fish run up the creek I live on, it was absolutely packed with what I later learned to be Coho salmon.  I never saw it before or since, despite living 35 years here.  It turned out that they had been diverted to this stream for this one run as part of a habitat restoration project, amazing.
All this just so I can charge my phone…

Best "dam" tour guide lol 😂
10:56 you could almost say... sofishticated
My fish 🐠🐋🐟
Environmental stewardship is awesome  Taking what we need and preserving nature as we do it
It’s a fish amusement park
"Best dame tour guide." Classic😂
Thanks Grady, my daughter and I love watching and learning from your videos, really fascinating stuff. Warm regards from the UK
Mesmerizing window.
"You might think getting hit by a spinning turban is the worst thing that could happen to a fish" lmao 😂
IVE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS DAM QUESTION!
I grew up in Hermiston, I've been on a couple field trips to this very dam lol I remember watching the fish in the observation window, one time there were lampreys stuck to the glass which was pretty cool At 3:35 you can see the park my mom would always take me to _(above_ the dam on the Oregon side)
Grady, you never told us you have a twin brother. (8:55)
That was interesting, thanks.
It would involve a lot of work with specific cameras, but having vr tours of such facilities available online would be neat. Maybe already out there, I'd have to check.
Screens are Equipped with brushes that scrub all the dead fish that do get sucked up lol.
"Best dam tour guide I've ever met", yea I noticed. MO POWAH BEBEH (donut reference)
It's nice that your pronounce species properly.
That's not how to pronounce behemoth
This was an incredibly informative video. I think maybe the opponents to dam infrastructure might have their minds changed after seeing this. I had no idea the lengths we are going to in helping fish survive passing through dams. Amazing.
We sure do take our salmon seriously here in Oregon ❤
Sooooo turbines are just larger  Bass A Matic  ....lmao 😂😊😅
Shorter answer: Ladders, Screens, and Science.
Why don't they study beavers instead of fish?
I live in central Washington and on the Columbia and love the various dams ... rock island dam during the retrofit for new efficient turbines and generators I was part of a team filming the engineers ... I got to go deep into a removed turbine and go below river bed.. was amazing
Disney should make a movie about the journey of one of these fish
I can remember spending loads of time as a kid watching the fish ladder that runs alongside a dam in the next city over, along the St. Joe river. Much to the annoyance of my parents who would have much rather kept walking instead of watching garbage, foam and the occasional fish lol. Not sure why but I've always been drawn to these types of structures
Honestly, I just bought the fish just systematically got turned into a paste.
They don't feel pain either 🙄
You can dam every river and produce a gazillion TW energy, but it does not matter if the ecosystems you are dependant on are compromised. You can live without energy, we've done it most of human history. You can not survive without the ecosystem, as you are a part of it. Unfortunately most engineers are on the spectrum and suffer from political infantilism, leading them to become stooges primed to create brilliant projects for the wrong interests. No dam can operate without decimating both up and down stream ecosystem dynamics, regardless of how it's presented. Anyone who says otherwise does not understand ecosystem dynamics whatsoever.
Where's the Salmon Cannon?
Let's save the fish... to then eat them. Consider veganism everyone!
I think what they're doing here to preserve the wildlife is 100% necessary. However, I hate the fact that hydroelectric (and other non-fossil fuel energy sources) are seemingly much more scrutinized versus fossil fuel itself. I fully understand that a dam's "fish survival" can't be brought back to a single number, and neither would anyone be able to bring back the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels to a single number. I can't articulate this concisely, but the point is that if fossil fuels would be scrutinized to the extent that hydroelectric is, I suspect that fossil fuels would be a lot more expensive and much less interesting to use.
So we go out of our way to hep fish go up and down the river but also go out of our way to deny other species (the birds) their food in the form of fish.  Sounds like most any other “environmental” program. Like the poisoning of ravens in the high deser in order to artificially prop up a naturally declining (due to a disease) desert tortoise population. Which then poisoned many other spiciest that preyed on the dead or dying ravens.  All a joke
As far as I’m concerned the fish are of no consequence when compared to human needs so put in a fish ladder and that’s should be it.  Especially when you consider that there are no biologically wild salmon any more.
I’m going to school for mechanical engineering and hope that someday I’ll be able to work on hydro electric dams
Really cool video!
0:13 glad you 'corrected' the opening point; the environment and non-human life was not only not considered, but intentionally disregarded when it came to decision making
This is a great video, and well presented summary of the complicated issues. But honestly, we could solve so many problems by just abolishing hydroelectric dams, oil drilling, etc, by just building nuclear power plants. It's literally one of the most environmentally friendly ways to generate power, despite the perceptions. The easy solutions are right in front of us already.
So today big dams are good?  I thought they were crumbling ancient structures with old tech?
I am a student in civil engineering in Québec, where our electricitie comes from hydropower. It's very interesting to learn about those important things. Thank you for those greats videos!
Huidong Li
This is all a lot of great information!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That is awesome you visited close to my hometown to make is video
Great video. Love it. Hate the way you say turbine...
Very positive vibes from all of this. Would like to subscribe soon
if a goldfish can beat the stockmarket, i suppose a salmon could manage a dam
Does anyone know where the fish data he mentioned is posted online? Im struggling to find it
This is an extremely informative video and addresses an important topic as fish passage on the snake river and other dams has gotten more and more attention, McNary Dam and the Columbia River system of locks and dams which stretches from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston, Idaho should really have a video of its own talking about the benefits of the dams and the drawbacks to the ecosystem, focusing on McNary dam tells one part of the story but the entire system really deserves to be looked at for context
PNW Mentioned 😮‍💨
Yes... Maintenance :) That screen looks so well maintained. @13:30
Great video!
This was an amazing watch, the amount of effort and thought into learning to live cohesively with the environment on display here is stunning. Thank you PNNL, you are saving the world. Thank you Grady and team, more please.
"best dam tour guide"
lol ‘the best dam tour guide’😅
I live near here love going to the trails around the dam
My one thought arising is a concern that the tags/beacons might radiate in such a way that might make the fish concerned stand out in the crowd and thus isolate them socially \m/
Western nations will spend millions if not billions to retrofit damns to save fish while countries like India create the most oceanic waste and China intentionally destroys fisheries around neigboring countries to hurt them economically. We westerners are NOT the problem and our culture is NOT comparable to theirs.
this guy reminds me of a creepy Mormon land lord....talks jsut like him too....idk....cant do it any more best luck with out me lol...jsut watching this guy i feel less straight....
I used to live right above this dam, those shotgun blasts during daylight hours get old fast 😅 but we always understood it was for scaring the birds away from the fish and as a fisherman I figured it was worth the headache.
neat!
15:30 my monkey brain has an urge to stick my hand into that turbine
thank you for answering the weird questions i have at 2 am when i should be sleeping.
Today I learned that fish don't read signs. Another great video thanks.
Oh lord, big dam got to practical engineering 😂
I never knew tradition Indian head wear had so many features. Turbans are amazing!
I need this BGM 2:00 could some one help please
Saving lamprey because they are native? Nuts!
Claustrophobic fish need not apply.
Would it not be possible to just make a channel to the side of the dam (or through it) with a fence/net on a diagonal herding fish towards it? And just clean then up every now and then.
I believe that videos like this increase the quality and intelligence of humanity. Thank you for your services.
"Hey babe, the fish ladder census data dropped!"
I have been working at pnnl for the past 5 years and now verry little about this work. It never ceses to amaze me the breth of research topics we do. Trust me when i say this isnt even the tip of the iceberg.
2:55   1.21 Gigawatts !! 😂 Great Scott.
"An informed opinion is better than an oblivious one" BASED AF
Awesome! I live 20 min away from that dam!
It's a good thing that salmon taste good, because none of this effort would have happened if it was just eels in the river.
this is the best Dam video i've seen in a while :)
kinda disturbing we're kidnapping fish and sticking devices in them and sending them on their way. Like imagine if one day you end up in a weird part of town and get stuck, taken to a random shack, put under, and wake up back in your car where you're supposed to be but now you have a sore stiff spot in your left thigh and a small scar. sure the fish don't have the sentience to know what happend to them, but its still weird
Just kidding.  they don’t. Ah ah
This video could've been a short.
These guys: trying their hardest to make sure as many fish as possible can pass this section of water Chicago: builds a massive underwater electric fence to stop all fish from traveling upstream
Fin-fastructure
I thought this said: How to survive Hydro Turbines XD
I always thought they diverted them with electrical currents in the water to make them re route
why do we even need fish eating birds? as far as i can tell they dont get rid of pests but are just in direct competition with us for food. so honestly, whats the point?
How was ur visit in Washington state
Best channel on YouTube this is so sick and so well crafted
Hydro dams are amazing technology when done right with the benefits of people and environment in mind.  Sadly places like the Three Georges Dam have negativity impacted the whole world and lots of the surrounding nations especially ones downstream. (reminds me of the idea to mine the moon and how some think its a good idea and don't think of the effect it has world wide) We can only be educated but education doesn't mean the little people can ever do anything
Another great video
This video is awesome. I wrote a paper related to this issue in college and I thought I knew quite a bit about it. This video showed me so much more detail about the engineering behind these dams. Thank you for covering this subject!
14:15 An important lesson to those who preach 'follow the science' without understanding what science is: it's a methodology, where things keep changing, not a static scripture like a Bible.
Sigh, and politicians want to tear these marvels of engineering down.  They act like it's infinite greed and reckless abandon of the duty of conservation. Dam operators know they are having an impact - and they're people - like anyone else they don't want to be cruel or evil.
This was basically an ad for pnnl. Doesn't really talk about fish passing through turbines as all the Columbia river dams have fish collection facilities (eas operates those at mcnary and other dams currently) in the Willamette they don't have those and some fish actually pass through the turbines so it depends on what style and pool elevations for how well they can pass.  So this is a cool video about the dams, but the underlying issue isn't something these guys are the foremost experts of. They are responding to the work of people like my brother in law.
Now I wanna take a ride on the fish slide.
That hair
Isn't it practical that fish are naturally built to survive hydro turbines?
I know this already - cause I looked at this vid before😊
Imagine having an AI machine at that window to see the fish pass that determines if the fish is invasive and sends it to be killed and turned into food or feed. Am I starting to feel comfortable with AI killbots??
I really appreciate your content Grady! Now if I could get my son to get your book off the shelf and look at it! Lol! I think I've enjoyed the book more than he has! 🙂
I would love for all power plants to just shut down for a week and see how many groups are complaining about fish or pollution.
Interesting = nightmare fuel
Nice job showing how complex a system there is to manage.  One thing that never comes is how the sensors we put in all these fish can be used by the giant foreign trawlers to track and catch them in the open ocean..   Millions make it to the ocean but only thousands come back... Where is the problem with survival?  think about it..
You can tell real ecologists by those lampreys, a totally nasty and ugly parasitic fish kind of thing. But they belong there also (not in lake Erie or similar where they are non native and the environmental scientists try and kill them out. These are true environmental scientist and they know that in this river the filthy little buggers have to be there too.
I once wrote a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers in grade school about how juvenile salmon got down. I was doing a science project about some people wanting to have the Snake River dams removed. I was so excited to get a letter back from an engineer answering my question.
Amazing work that all these people are doing, expanding the scientific knowledge apart from integrating the dam into the ecosystem. 👍 Great video!!!!!
There are about 34 dams on the Columbia River system each killing 15 to 20% of the runs. Damns kill both adults and Juveniles by blocking passage and harboring predator’s. Chinook Salmon also called King Salmon yearly runs historically totaled 12 to 15 million fish. Fish guided by smell and a genetically endowed blueprint historically migrated thousands of miles in both fresh and salt water. Genetically programed to swim rapid filled rivers they now must navigate up chains of Damned lakes causing fish to lose their way.  More than anything Damns have slashed Columbia River runs from 15 million to 800,000 yearly and to say fish ladders will fix the problem is a simplistic fix for a much bigger problem.
I'm no engineer, but was always interested in this stuff. So glad I found your channel some time ago. I'm learning a lot, and sometimes things I didn't even think about. As I watch your stuff on Nebula, I always try to find your videos on YT afterwards and given them a thumbs up to heighten their visibility. More people need to know these things, even if only to really appreciate the work done by so many people in this field. Things most people take for granted and don't even think about.
I may be biased, due to growing up near it, bonneville dam is the coolest one. 😂
Say Turban one more time
YEAH Washington!
Always love this kind of project that maintain good environmental aspect. Unlike here, in 3rd world country, where any national project is just a way for corruption for the mafia (the govt) without considering environmental or native social impact.
can someone please do an art installation on those turbines. Painting them like Cephalopods
We really need to be more conscientious about the environment and fast. I don't think we are going to be able to fix the problems as well as we can prevent them right now.
This is a fascinating video. I know very little, but can say that my brother is a contractor for the Amry Corps of Engineers and studies fish counts in Oregon and he would paint a VERY different picture about the effectiveness of these ladders, IE, they are not effective at all. I think dams are a marvel of engineering and I don't savor the idea of removing them, but I have been moved on the effectiveness of these since picking my brother's brain.
:)
That cant be the correct way to pronounce turbine right?
This is how you fix issues.  You do not destroy our way of life, but you put innovative ideas to coexist with nature.  This video gives me hope.
What did the salmon say to the other salmon when he hit the wall? DAM!🤣
This isn't the normal host? I am sure there was a reason why I subscribed and it wasn't this dude sending me to sleep ...
Even though this was already over 20 minutes long, it felt like merely a preview video. So much "they showed me this, they told me that" without going into much detail, it's crazy just how involved this whole topic is. Others here have said it already and I agree that an extended-cut would be extremely interesting for sure!
Excellent content and presentation! Fantastic job!
I love that you cover Hydro content, been working in Hydro ever since I left school 10 years ago and its my absolute passion, thanks for spreading awareness on efforts we make to make sure they're as environmentally friendly as possible whilst still providing electricity.
“The best dam tour guide I ever met” 😂
2:50 "This behemoth can generate a giga watt of power combined."   Some perspective: A giga Watt is 1000 megawatts which is the power generated by just one typical fossil fuel turbine generator. A typical US state needs 40 to 50 times 1000 megawatts.  So this dam is generating about 2% of a state's power needs.
Will you do a extended cut of your interview ? Because it seems like you learn lot of thinks but weren't able to put the technical stuff in this video
As someone who works in the hydropower industry, I love this series. Keep making awesome videos Grady!
At 8:37, in the words of Saul from Ocean's 11, "That is the sexiest thing I have ever seen".
You know what I get from this video? I think this shows us that we can be environmentally minded and also meet our needs
Im sure people back in the day were aware of the impacts of dams probably the same percentage now most people are asleep in their cnscoiusness more than ever .
Why do you mispronounce turbine in a video about turbines?
"It's kind of like a Bible..."  Ooof
I never knew I needed engineering videos about fish ladder witch I also didn’t know existed, but brooooooo drop that new fish ladder video soon please 🙆‍♂️
When I was younger, I thought turbines were giant spinning blades like a blender.... blame movies... and I wondered how fish got past dams and the churn wasn't just red clouds...  I never really considered why there wasn't greater impact from Dams with how many there really are in the US.  I think its time I relearn about the lock system of the great lakes
I don't see the need. Is every river leading to the ocean dammed? If not they'll eventually find different rivers to use.
What is a turban?
I've been watching this channel for years and i just realized i wasn't even subscribed😳 that mistake has been corrected, excellent video as always!!!
You can be sure they don't do this in China...or even care at that.
Will you ever cover STATCOM in your series ❤
And not one person wearing an actual turban..
Thanks for an excellent educational video. Carry On.
In addition to all of these engineering measures to keep fish alive at dams, many utilities that own dams also own fish hatcheries and grow millions of fish every year.
8:36 So kind of like what the fourth dimensional beings did when they created 'Earth' so we'd bypass their super highway without getting run over by their multi-dimensional 18 wheelers! :O
I know that human beings and fish can coexist peacefully.
Wow piezoelectric trackers... impressive. So many cool facts in this video. Thanks for the awesome video.
The third most important aspect after safety, power generation, and the ecology pf the river are the most important responsibilities that we deliver to our customer owners, the tribes, and environment to deliver power to the western US through dams along the Columbia River.  Hope you got to Chelan County and up to\Leavenworth. Next time you are out this way, stop in and say hi.
Wow. Great to see you cover the damns here in oregon. I'll be passing by there on the way to snake river at the end of thr month.
I come in to get answer for 1 question. Why I have to wait 20min while you are telling me your artificially lengthened story?
Dam!! This dam is amazing!
13:49 That almost sounds speciesist Helping fish, hindering birds
Thanks for your sharing
When people are afraid of aliens, when actually we are the aliens to the animals.
Please make your narration voice louder It’s hard to hear on a phone
This is neat and thoughtful. Saves creatures who are at our mercy..
YouTube suggested this video and at first i was like sure im interested in finding out how fish survive but this video went all over the place and i ended up saying f it i don't care enough to listen to a bunch of bs i could care less about. A quick 2-3 mins would've been enough
i joined nebula a couple of months ago and have enjoyed my subscription. i bought a year's sub thinking all your videos would be posted there before posted on YouTube.  However i just checked nebula and this video is not yet posted.  comments?
Having grown up on the Columbia River, I remember school field trips to tour Wells, Chief Joseph, and Grand Coulee Dams. And also the push to get fish ladders built on the dams. Salmon conservation was and still is a big part of the scientific culture of Washington
Pryce from Better Call Saul sure has taught me a lot about water and engineering over the years. Mr Wormald, you got any of those Squat Cobbler videos around still?
I've come back two days later just to comment this. 9:08-9:24 this is the part of the video that most impressed me. Instead of just saying it's "better" and that they do "good" things for "the environment", he says EXACTLY what they do, in ordinary, civil, simple, understandable language. No esotericism involved, no elitism.
I think this is the best video you have made so far. Excellent work!!!!!!!!!!
TT
Was literally wondering about this last week. Now I have the answer.
They don't. How do seals or any sea mammal survive pod propeller :they don't. He's talking politics so completely meaningless.
when a beaver builds a dam no one says a thing. but when a human builds a dam suddenly everyone freaks out.
I want to see a video of fish going through an old vs new turbine.
I would not worry about saving lamprey. They are parasites and are unnecessary. Just because they are natural is not a reason to accomodate them.. So are polio viruses and leprosy bacteria natural.
Tech 3 fish counter
This guy invented pegging
Got the bottom of the dam issue, came out alive at the other side 👍
I love Grady's dam videos 👍
Dam good video 👍
Contraversial issiu
11:02
So cool!!!
Crazy how many awesome people there out there working on huge projects like this
Congrats on this video doing so well, hope your channel becomes even more popular
Back in the in the 1990's I was working for a company doing asbestos abatement at McNary Dam.  Asbestos was used extensively as thermal insulation on cooling lines inside the turbines. The was asbestos insulation in most of the electrical components. There was also sound absorbing coatings made with asbestos on various surfaces to reduce noise.  Since McNary spans the border between Oregon and Washington,  there is a line inside the dam marking the border.  Employees have to keep track of the time spent in each state for taxes and other labor expenses.
nearly 1 gwh translates into half a milion households in the US? um .. sorry .. that's barely .. or not even valid in germany and DEFINITIVELY not valid for the US  2000kwh per household? in the US? .. the average is AT BEST 8k (northeast) and go beyond 13k (midwest) kwh per year
so cool!
I love this channel.  These guys are asking the real questions all the time
Fish passage is surprisingly complicated. Just recently during the Klamath river dam removal project almost all the fryling released from a hatchery died in a water diversion tunnel due to pressure like they briefly mentioned in the video. Fish also are pretty picky on ladder design. If it's not designed perfect they pretty much won't use it. One of the dams being removed had a ladder that essentially never got used. There's so many different types. One river I worked on actually had a ladder put in so the fish could get around a natural barrier because of warming waters.
“The best dam tour guide” 🤣
Beautiful, this one should have split in multiple video for more details
Thank you for these videos! I just started working in hydropower 2 years ago and your channel has been instrumental in not only educating me, but my company's interns as well.
Signed up for Nebula! Thanks for the discount code!!  Question about trains… posting here because I figure you will see it here since this is newer.  When they build a train and they have an engine pulling and an engine pushing, how does that work? There is a certain amount of slack in each cars coupling that can move back and forth ( in and out ). The train pulling will pull the slack out but at some point the engine pushing would push that slack back it seems. Leaving some cars at least that it wouldn’t seem to be able to be pulled or pushed.  Very curious…
This is peak YouTube
I appreciate your dedication to trying to be objective on this, Grady. The improvements are great and it's good that such talented people are working on them. It's still a fact that regardless of improvements, dams are factories placed in a river that have immeasurable negative impacts on natural ecosystems. Fish passage is necessary for their operations but your video helps highlight that fish passage is selective. Species that are deemed less valuable and less charismatic suffer most with dams. They are often forgotten. So if our most "important" species still struggle with the issue of dams, think about how poorly they must affect the species people didn't even think about!   Anyway, thank you for the cool information. We just need to make sure we think about the actual scale of impact of things like dams. You can think of it like recycling; having some recycled plastic bottles does not fix that Coca Cola won't stop producing billions of bottles every year that will not be recycled. Similarly, some improvements do not change that dams fundamentally and permanently alter entire ecosystems and their functionality.
3:20 This gives me flashbacks of all those lathe accident vidoes (If you don't know, don't google it - some things can not be unseen).
Thank you for one more very interesting video
They do?
Im so impressed by this. The amount of effort they put in, the scale of the engineering and the openness to talk about it. Great!
i think i found my new fishing spot🎣😋
When you really think about it, hydroelectric plants are basically just a complicated way to collect energy from the sun.
This is absolutely fascinating!
❤ from 🇨🇦
Anyone have short summary? Im too lazy to watch the whole video
Those guys really went out of there way to give you a great tour and provide you will all that information.
TUR BINEZ not TUR BINS. lol
I wish there were some more animations to elaborate it more thoroughly... Anyway loved it ❤
I hope we see salmon and other fish return to the kettle river soon as well
The dam put in a dang fish ladder now let them generate in peace.
6 min intro
It was fantastic to watch you look so flabbergasted about how involved and important this type of infrastructure is. It as much as anything gave me a new perspective on a process and mindset I already found important.   Thank you for sharing this.
Ha ha ha!  "...best dam tour guide...".  😂😂😂
1.21 Gigawatts? Great Scott!
why can't the juveniles just go down the ladder?
Oh man thats awesome! Both my mom and cousin work at PNNL. Its amazing how much PNNL does.
nah it's definitely fish magic 🐟🔮
I'm from Northern Ontario (land of the Dam) and I'VE LITERALLY ALWAYS WONDERED THIS BOUT FISH.
I learnt a lot more than how fish survive Hydro Turbines. Thanks a lot for this amazing video.
Tear them out, we can use potato batteries to make power. 😂
Why did you get your thumbnail from my prostate doctor photograph
The problem is 30 dollar for lationamerica is really a lor of money
Thanks for the dam education
Thanks for this informative video and for coming out to see the Walla Walla District with the US Army Corps of Engineers!  @wallawallausace
I would have loved a very brief video with the words They don't.
Turbans
Excellent episode - subscribed! Only if all dams would have such a technology and features to protect all the marine life especially fishes.
Um: Anguilla rostrata L. don’t.
Didn't they have any bigger hard hats? Looks like the pair of you at 5:14 are wearing peanuts.
Salmon are one of a keystone species like wolves
We just take the ones that don't survive and put them in our tacos. 🤷
great!
What a cool video! I’ve been up there to see the fish jumping up the ladder, it’s a truly cool experience! Even still, i Learned so much from this video!! Thank you
Oh hey, you filmed this less than 10 mins from me. Lol
bro just tell us how a fish survives a hydro turbine. its doesn't take a 20 minute video to make a 20 second statement.
Fish ladders need to be put on Grand Coulee Dam and any other dams in Columbia River that don’t have one. The engineering is remarkable of these dams but a lot simply don’t have the infrastructure cutting off a lot of the watershed from salmon.
This guy does not miss
I wish I had taken the time to visit the McNary dam when I lived in WA.
Those turbines don't LIVE there.... THEY DO NOT LIVE, THEY EXIST....  Living requires 6 functions (of life) which inanimate turbines CANNOT PERFORM!   Turbines DO NOT LIVE, are not alive!!! Must we send you back to kindergarden???   Get serious.
🤯🤓
All the those factors that guy mentioned come together and do produce a single number for overall survival of fish.  Did he provide that to you?  If not, that is telling.
This was really interesting. Thanks for the video!
Looks like I’ve just added another spot to visit when I head up to Pendleton, OR next week - the McNary dam!
In New Zealand electric fences are used to guide fish into a fish hatchery.  screens could be slightly electrified to guide juvenile fish.
fish ladders are hard on fish and let all species of fish through..including species not wanted.  the whoosh innovations solution is much better.
" we have to destroy the dams to save fish!" to this statement ill be sending them this video. "shut up! watch this!" and if they dont watch this.. make em watch in public lol people are less likely to throw a tantrum in public.
A few dams here on the snake river are being talked about being shutdown. We’ve tried everything to help with fish pop but its NOT working. The only way to get our fish pop back is to get rid of them.
I heard they're removing the dams on the Klamath River to restore salmon habitat; too bad the salmon are dying at sea. What's Fukushima?
That was a Dam good video!
you missed some hair on yor bottom lip when you shaved.
Do we really need a 20min video just to know why fish survive turbines?
"prepared each year" "VERSION: 14-JUL-2022"  you missed a year
Bro that fish go abducted and probed. Nobody is gonna believe him later😂
"Best dam tour guide". - hahahaha, fantastic!
That is really cool. I often wondered how that works :)
This has been one of your best videos.
2:20 😂 I see what you did there
Can someone timestamp the explanation of _"How Fish Survive Hydro Turbines"_ ?
Fish theme park
A Turban is a type of headwear based on cloth winding. Featuring many variations, it is worn as customary headwear by people of various cultures. A Turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. There is a very big difference between a Turban and turbine .
Look at the absolute JOY of that civil engineer at 1:45. He's a 4 year old at Disney World.
Why did I click, why am I here? Why do I care to know how fish survive hydro turbines? This serves no purpose to know, it's does not benefit me, yet here I am.
All this talk about turbans....I don't think I saw a single Muslim in this video!
The amount of work humans put in to coexist with nature is just incredible. Of course, in the past we did things we shouldn't have, but because we didn't understand things. The fact that we put the time to better our approach, and make thing right when we know the issues, is truly inspiring. We can't change everything in one day, it takes time, especially if we want to keep our way of life while we do it. Sometimes people make it seem that all we do as a species is wrong in some way our another. This proves otherwise, and like this there are meany other examples. Great work!
theres weirs along the Murray river that use the fish ladder to try get rid of the invasive carp
5:20 may I assume those bicycles are for inside the facility use ? The size seems to require it.
NGL I was expecting a 2 second video : "they don't"
When the dolphins leave and say "so long, and thanks for the fish," this what they're talking about.
Just put a net and catch them. Unlimited food farm
Apart from the one in China which is changing the earths axis which will be a disaster.
Oh who cares?!! YT stop recommending foofoo eco freak content!!!!! I DONT CARE!!!!!!!
I love how at the start the fish reaches each of the rubber bands in sync with the music
We eat fish.
Testing the limits of how much crushing a fish can withstand...
What a really fantastic dive into this complex topic.  It's great to see engineers so passionate about cohabiting the earth with animals!
Mooo
best dam tour guide... funny ^^
this shows that engineering and nature can exist in harmony. So genius
... Feesh.
17:26 they did surgery on a fish
The power house is the mitochondria of the grid
@practicalengineering not sure when you came by. But you should see on top of Mcnary dam in the summer.  It's covered in large spiders. The portable toilets even though cleaned weekly, the very next day after being cleaned are covered in about 100 spiders.
A decade ago, when I was living in Portland, OR, I was allowed to enter one of the dams on the Columbia River. I had to fill out many forms, and wait a few weeks for a background check. When the day came, I presented a letter that was sent to me at the gate, and I was in! To my surprise, no escort was needed. A fun day touring the inner workings of the powerhouse, and chatting with the engineers there.
wife. “He probably talking to other girls”.  Me. “Oh Grady has another video, cool!”
Thank you for explaining many of the sofishticated systems!
When Fish with sensor hunted by bird Scientist: Look, our salmon is flying 💀💀💀
Can you do a video about how humanity will survive Zionism?
Really exciting stuff.
what a simply amazing video
they should make a fish cam for that window xD i would watch every now n then
Yeah I had to stop halfway through as I was too distracted by the 'spinning turbans'. I mean - surely they'd come untied?
Chicken and Salmon should have put less points in deliciousness...
I really was hoping to properly understand how fish ladders in big dams work, but I can't say I'm much wiser from the expl at 8:00 .  I wish diagrams or models had been incorporated in the vid
2:22 dam good pun
Who would have thought "turbins" could generate so much power. Makes you wonder why other dams use turbines.
Fish surgery
Oooh chocolate hard hats!
this a great episode, Grady. Thanks for letting us learn about fish passages.
Imagine when Grady becomes a grandpa the stories he'll tell his grandchildren. He'll certainly be some kind of wizard hero to them.
Its turbine not turban 😂
I didn't like your profanity. Im a Christian. My family watches this. Please don't do it again.
Hehe, fish pipe
Some dam good puns in this video!
Righteous righteous, give me some fin, noggin, duude
Good video, but misleading title.  I want to know about about fish survive dam crossings, not watch a documentary about dams
Dam good video
i joined Nebula but i can't get it to show the various channels and what videos each have.  i did get to Practical Engineering but the choice was limited to 4 videos.  the menus and search appear to not work (nothing happens when i click).
So glad you covered the reason they're being mindful of lampreys. They are literal aquatic nightmare fuel and they're invasive in my area. We used to kill them when I was a kid, but good to know they're prioritizing their native status there!
New ways to operate turbans, eh?
Yes please, more hydroelectric content, all from big dams, to pump hydro and small micro hydro from mountain streams 😃
Sorry, man. Love your content, but immediate dislike for showing lamprey teeth. I was trying to have dinner!
at 2:50 you say "it's equipped with 14 power-generating turbines, and these behemoths can generate nearly a gigawatt of power, combined." Do you mean a gigawatt of power every minute, hour, day, or any unit of time beyond that? I can generate a gigawatt of power with a small, hand-cranked generator given enough time, too.
The dam creates "forced progress," that's progress that's faster than people themselves need.  They flood some area and harm nature there.  They block river flows and harm lots of river life.  They provide lots of water so people then move and do agriculture in deserts and other hot/dry places.  They provide more power so more people move there for "cheap power."
I'd really like to see what the survivability overall is and how that has changed over the decades despite it perhaps being an oversimplification as well as a per species breakdown over time. Also, to hear from local environmental advocacy groups with regards to what kind of impact all these efforts are having.
Very nice to see the real engineering that is focused on improving this issue.  So many people just emotionally call for removal of dams with absolutely zero plan for what happens later (Mainly more coal plants and more pesticides; as the same fools have already shutdown all improvements in nuclear in the USA; and they don't understand why farmers prefer the trouble of irrigating in an arid climate verses farming a more humid area.).  Or even more daft they believe people should and will revert to some primative fantasy lifestyle living in unpowered mudhuts and eating hemp bark.
I live in the Tri-Cities about an hour or so from McNary Dam and I think its so cool that you traveled to Eastern Washington to shoot this video. If you have the time in the future you should Visit the Hanford Site. It is one of the first Nuclear reactors built in this country and the Bomb used on Nagaski was built there.
Fish return systems on nuclear power inlets would be a good topic
Yes the best turbin for fish must be the Kaplan, and maybe the Frances, but Pelton no no.😊
I just wanted to know the answer to the question and I wasn’t ready to sign up for a 22 minute video so I’m not watching any of it.
This guy has the coolest job on the planet
THIS IS THE CONTENT I WANT TO SEE!!!!! SO GOOD!
Fishborg Blaster yo
this is incredible
Man those turbans are huge, imagine the size of the turk sitting underneath!
How do fish cross a dam it's called a fish ladder helped to build one on the St Joseph River behind the French paper mill in Niles Michigan. It's called a fish friendly fish ladder because of it's design. It has a camera system in the observation room on the ladder that can be accessed by the public on the internet. You can watch the fish go through the ladder in real time.
Im sure predators learned to just sit at the end of that pipe waiting fr small fish.
I was literally wondering about this exact thing a few weeks ago. Nice!
this video is straight fire, learned something new! 🔥😎
Best dam tour guide. 😂
It looks like Mr. Snowgoggles loves sushi as much as I do because he's doing a lot of keep them safe. Thank you! Save those fish and enjoy the slopes.
This man seems genuinely happy to talk about engineering.
I understand focusing on the engineering aspects of the subject given this is Practical Engineering, and I'm grateful you recognized how controversial this all is, but I think there was a missed opportunity to talk a third-party fish biologist/indigenous cultural practitioner/etc. about the consequences of these structures, even with all the mitigation strategies you talked about. Only chatting with the people who work for the orgs that run these dams missed a lot of context and perspective.  "Can fish bypass dams?" is only the first question that should be asked. A lot of the apparent successes actually mask extreme problems that aren't so directly related to dams For example, fish hatcheries used to boost wild populations that have been decimated by dams. Hatchery fish can drastically harm wild populations if they're able to reproduce. Dam removal is likely integral to the genetic restoration of these fish populations.
Americans can't say turbine... 👳
I think this is your best video yet. I learned a ton, and have a new appreciation for the care some dam operators are taking to balance care of our precious natural resources with our needs for stored fresh water and energy. Thanks!
The fish have no voice .all the nice music cant silence the lies.
I'm impressed from an engineering POV, and I'm happy that they can do this for the wildlife (both for its own sake, and because that wildlife is also useful to us as well).   But I do worry about the thing you said early on, about how most of our big dams were built before we paid much mind to things like fish survival. Specifically, I worry that this isn't a coincidence. How much can you complicate a dam with fish survival tools before it's just not worth building at all? And what does harming our single best source of electricity (since hydro is the only one that's cheap, easily adjustable in output, and also carbon-free) do to other environmental concerns?   I'm not saying that any of this is bad, but I do worry about how we'd even know if we'd started overdoing it.
How do you get boats past the dams?
"Best *dammed* tour-guide" -I love dad jokes!
BRO I LIVE NEXT TO THE DAM!
Love your channel and the information and education you and the channel provide. :)
Great Video
I'll give you the short version. A lot of young ones don't survive. And the stream water quality tanks.
Very impressed the Evo friendly approch.
I never knew I wanted a fish window in my office, new career path identified.
Whats a turbun?? It's turbine
Anyone gonna mention the pronunciation of turbines? I keep thinking its what the sikhs wrap around their head with 😭😭😭
Famous quote from a fish running into a concrete wall...  "DAM!"  Why did the fish fall off the ladder?  Lost his balance.
You should find something to do with @SmarterEveryDay
no such thing as a good dam
may i have more details on the fish piezo implant ?  im an engineering student and would like to learn about it
Thank you again for providing informative content!
As Fish biologist who works closely with hydropower dams, I've enjoyed learning some of the principals of engineering and hydraulics from your videos. Its great to see some videos come full circle back to what us biologists can teach the engineers so we can all work together to come up with better solutions.
I was amused when the dam guy said "You can't reduce it to a single number". Because of course you can. It has a cost, in dollars. If the cost was $1, well, it's definitely worth it. If it's a trillion, it isn't. Maybe there's like a region of uncertainty where it's not clear if it's worth it, but that's definitely a region we can bound.
Grady looked really happy during this video! Made me smile :)  Love seeing people who love what they're doing!
We have eal ladders at the dame here in Cornwall Ontario
Amazing video, thanks
Aww, you're having so much fun when you give that intro line over the industrial sounds! It really makes me happy seeing people make videos about things they're passionate about and have fun doing it.
No takeaway? No look at cuncluding data in the end? A comparison to other dams and what the costs are for what rate of survivability? Its a really interesting topic so that incunclusive end is a bit of a bummer to me
I heard people saying civil engineering is not a popular major in western countries, so I am surprised of the views you got from each videos.
Thank you!
imagine fishing at those fish route
Super great video!
Super cool video
Hey Grady!
Is it some kind of a trend to misspronounce "issue" the way the guy in the video does? e.g. 1:01 I've started hearing random YouTubers here and there pronounce it that way in the last month or two, this is the 3rd or the 4th youtuber.
This is awesome, thanks for bringing all this information to the wider audience.
The topic didn't get me very excited but the video was brilliant thank you
how about the greenhouse gas emissions produced by decomposing organic matter in the dam lakes? CO2 in the best case scenario with sufficient oxygen, but also methane in the deeper anoxic strata?
"Fish, generally, don't read signs."  Well, who knew fish and humans have so much in common!
"Best Dam tour guide I've ever met" I saw what you did there 😅
So many turbans 👳 😂😂😂
Great video, but too much swearing.
Aint noone searched "How fish survive turbines"
The fish border
This is the one, this video finally got me to subscribe to Nebula. I was so close to doing it with Practical Construction but this tipped the scales (pun intended). You're killing it Grady.  edit: There's no comments on Nebula videos! Half the fun is hearing all the random stories from engineers you inspire to share their tales. Sad.
Thought these things were called Turbines, not turbins.
I love your content, but as a Canadian, your pronunciation of turbine greatly upsets me. And we like to make fun of Americans for their mispronunciation of it. Especially as a turbine jockey. Its always meant to be a hard I like turbINE, and its always just poking fun at you guys for it. Keep up the good work, I always enjoy your content!
I've always wondered: What happens to such sensors on pray animals when they're caught and eaten by predatory animals? I mean... those can't be healthy to digest, even if they're so small. They still have batteries, plastics etc. I guess the electricity they run on is pretty harmless low voltage/current but the rest seems pretty harmful to me...
This channel is Discovery of YouTubes'  Made contribution more than TV for public ed
I have always wondered about that. Thank you
Uh why not, instead of diverting small streams of water for the fish to swim in and then damming the whole river, just divert small streams of fish-excluded water into man-made sections for a single turbine and then just put a bunch of those along the river for each turbine? Answer: Government engineering. Just how they make roads for electric cars out of asphalt lol.
Pretty cool you were able to come to my backyard and show how these dams work and the effort going into helping the fish. Spent most of my life here and have passed McNary dam countless times.
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
I also was asking these questions myself - really deep science in there - in the fish bank :)
New camera? Looking real sharp with great focal depth!
There should not be dams on the Columbia or Snake Rivers! They need to be removed! Build them in tributaries that historically didn't have Salmon because of natural barriers like waterfalls if we need them, but why exploit the river when it already gives us so much life?
Never heard of anyone trying to help lampreys before.
That is a very low head dam.  I don't think much of this stuff works on a high head dam.
*The best dam tour guide ove ever met* 😂
You can't forget that fish are also adapting and evolving in response to our actions.
Thanks Grady.  Your content is amazing
Fish don’t survive the turbine, but I don’t hate the dams.
Can’t say it isn’t so all the dams on the Columbia river kill fish
Though Im not an engineer, it's interesting to hear the considerations engineers have to take to preserve the ecosystem. As a biologist, this gives me an even greater appreciation for infrastructure.
Wow! Great video. I designed some instrumentation for Corps Of Enginners test programs in 2000 at the Bonneville and Libby Dams. I was amazed at the size and scope of what they were doing. It is astounding how far they've progressed in the twenty years since then.
Hello Grady, thanks for this great educational video. I love that it shows what is being done to right the mistakes of the past in a format that doesn’t demonize any person or agency, yet conveys what was wrong and how it’s being made right.   Since you show the turbines used for power generation I have a question, have you considered making a video about these spinning giants and how they would be replaced if a catastrophe partí destroyed the dam? Those are very large components and I don’t see large access doors in any dam that would allow to bring a new turbine, or new generator into the bowels of the dam.
Is the Earth just a salmon ladder for humans built by aliens?
Fish cannon!!  Oh wait, wrong video? 😉
Nearly 1 Gigawatts? per how long? So that's not enough to power a certain DeLorean, and a lightning bolt is more than that. It finally puts that into perspective for me!
Hi Grady, welcome to Washington state. I’m assuming you were at PNNL in Richland? I’ve been through several of the Columbia river dams and they were fascinating.
I hope you stopped by Bonneville on your way out to McNary!
dams are hell on fish and the fish ladders designed for moving fish up rivers are laughably inadequate - we value power more than the environment but the awareness that the environment matters is why we are seeing a surge in dam removals - especially old dams - the economic tide is shifting along with the awareness that a healthy environment is critical to everyone's well being - don't listen to the engineers - they are standing on the shoulders of the people who thought the current paradigm was a good idea.
Love your videos!!! 😃
Finally a balanced approach to the hydropower vs fish debate!
this video is amazing thanks for putting them together. did anyone else see the guy that looks like doctor who?
The picture at 7:40, by Eric Gustavus Michelson, was extremely enlightening and helpful in understanding how the powerhouse and fish ladder operate. I did a quick search online, but I couldn’t find this one shown or any others even though online it says that he created two for this dam for the Army Corps of Engineers.
The picture at 7:40, by Eric Gustavus Michelson, was extremely enlightening and helpful in understanding how the powerhouse and fish ladder operate. It’d be cool if there were more pictures like this based off the engineering diagrams. I really appreciate how much of the actual documentation you include in your videos overall.
As a civil engineer I was day dreaming how fish pass the turbines? And God hears my voice , thanks a lot professor.
I was just at this dam a few months ago as a road trip pit stop. You answered basically all of the questions I was wondering at the time. Great video! I'm excited for more on fish ladders.
Grady: "I'm here to interview your Dam manager, dam it. Show me the dam fish, and the dam turbans so I can take pictures for the internet!" 😂  I love this channel, just commenting for engagement. You do such a good job that teasing is open season. When you're this good it's obvious a razing is a joke.
As an Oregonian it's great to have one of your videos showing off how our dams work.
I have visited as tourist and been taken around as an engineer a 3.2GW hydropower station. When stood next to the turbine you don't so much hear the noise but feel. It vibrates through your entire body. Being shown around as an engineer I saw more technical areas where tourists never got to see. Unfortunately they closed the visitor centre during the pandemic and have demolished it.
Not me trying to find this info last week for u to post a video today
Wish they would show these videos to kids in schools... get'em excited about engineering.
Love this! We just need to give mother nature a fighting chance
My dad works at PNNL in the cyber security department. So that's cool that you're teaming up w/ a lab that's local to me.
This was a great video but I'm surprised you didn't mention the push in WA to remove a lot of the dams.
Hey, I know that dam at the beginning! That's the John Day dam at Bigg's Junction. My family used to drive by it all the time when my Dad's parents still lived in Snohomish (a place North of Seattle).
Wow. I was working on an ag tank job just west of umatilla a two years ago. I had no idea such neat infrastructure was so close to my job site despite being a stones throw away from the water
I really applaud the people here working to find that balance and cooperation between us and nature.  Some extremists on both sides like the claim that either we have to give up what we enjoy in life to save the planet, or just not care about the planet in the first place because its a Generation + N problem, but places like this show it is possible to achieve a balance that does both.
Tbh I don't care about the fish.
‭‭John 3:16 KJV‬‬﻿ [16] For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Cool episode about fish and turbans.
To run the..  turbans?  I was not aware headwear came into the picture.  Do those come before or after the turbines?
The fish aren't going to get hit by the turbine, the turbine moves at the same speed as the water flowing though it, and the fish is in that water. In fact the turbinev is miving slower, it's the water hitting the turbine and slowing down that effectively transmits energy to the turbine blade. They define it terms of speed and pressure but it's essentially the same thing. When you take fast moving fluid and slow it down, that energy is transformed into pressure. When fast moving water or gas hits a turbine (or stator if it's an axial turbine) blade, it slows down immediately, but all the force is still there, all the momentum.
I'm so excited for the fish ladder video!
That face when Grady sees the dam
Ngl i feel like i would love being a tour guide, learning everything i can about a certain place and telling people all the interesting trivia I discovered.
Okay, i will bite. How?  And it's funny how we have infinite green power available in water and everyone ignores it. Like it wouldn't be easier to resolve the issues with dams than building millions of wind turbines and huge plains full of toxic solar cells.
Why do I low key don’t believe those people actually care about ecological impacts (and even despise the extra effort needed to minimize it) and only do it that way because it’s demanded by legislation? I’m sorry if my comment was offensive for those who really care but I couldn’t help
Great video!
“And to demonstrate this I built a scale dam in my garage and out goldfish through it “😂😂😂
Man you cant make a bad video. I’ve watched so many over the past 2 years and absolutely love your channel
I love your videos but can you make them 20 minutes shorter
22:00 "let me know what you think" you dont wanna know what i think
How many poles are on those generators?
Turbins.... you know, like the Indians & Arabs wear.... smh
3:20 These bars are dangerous. Would somebody get stuck in them, they would be made into a lump of meat pretty quickly. Please pass it to the dam chief in charge. One solution would be to anchor the bars with lighter screws, so they would fall aport in case f emergency *would have to be done very right to not damage the shaft), or just widen the gap. But nobody should be able to put his leg between the shaft and the bars.
Lamprey... Grr!... You want em?  Come up to the Great Lakes and get em.  We don't want em!  Ruining our fishing grounds.
Can't imagine this channel without its associated music, it makes such an epic intro into videos :D
Where can I find more about that fish-friendly turbines? I don't understand how they can lessen the pressure-shock without lowering efficiency?
"and McNary is equipped with a lot of deterrents to try and keep birds away."  Oh? 🤔
🎉Thanks
What about the grand coulee dam?
can i survive that if i go for a swim?
Every time he says turbine, all I can hear is turban
11:34 it was at This Moment I realized where the Splatoon devs got the idea for the ink-cleaning brushes in single player mode
go look at niagra falls... there's been a dam there for like 100 years and there's still fish. they're all fine.
I was really hoping for fish trebuchets.  Guess this will do.
Tim is a great guy. Got to work with him "back in the day".
"#6 on Trending."    So well-deserved!
you'd get 10 million views if you named the video  "E L E C T R I C  F I S H  C A T H E D R A L" but i guess youre doing ok Stay weir'd
Nice job gentlemen.   You all  deserve more recognition than you get. Stay strong and lots of people appreciate you and your work.
While they might not be employees of the dam or power company I think you probably should have included an interview with an ecologist familiar with the region about how effective these fish-protection efforts are and how the populations/fish catch have changed over time. If they agreed that populations are recovering nicely then that removes some of the PR-feeling that the other interviews give. And if they disagree about how effective the fish protection efforts there are, then it shows you did your due diligence to not just repeat PR but actually fact check it. We don't need more insufficiently skeptical content like Real Engineering's Spinlaunch and Helion videos.
8:17 so what's your job? "I'm look out a window and count fish swimming by "
Lamprey creep me the hell out
I never thought this much was involved in a dam.
The fish ladders are also fun at the locks around the PNW too!
Wow, I always thought that they didn't survive.  Nice to see
Thank you for the awesome tour !
Turban?
If I asked how do fish get through dams and you told me ladders, without this explanation, I wouldn’t have believed you.
You didn't even touch on the economic benefit that dams provide and how they reduce carbon emissions for transportation of food and fuel. Rail transit is basically maxed in the area and for every barge that goes through the navigation locks to the Pacific Ocean from as far as Lewiston, ID, hundreds of semi-trucks are not needed on a daily basis to transport bulk items.
I didn't know a head dress could produce power.... Wow
On of the best on youtube, discovering the subjects that we usually take for granted.
just make nuclear plants and stop complicating fish life =)
Really interesting and educational, I had no idea. Thanks.
I'm not going to worry about the Lamprey.
Thankyou good sir ❤🎉
Thankyou good sir ❤🎉
Beautifully done and explained in lay terms for us non-engineers! Thanks so much!
85 MW x 14 generators is nearly 1.2 GWatts... nearly enough to fire a flux capacitor...
2:20 “Best dam tour guide ive ever met” 😂
@2:20 best DAM tour guide you've ever met ohhh where can I get some DAM fishing bait?
Maybe someone should do a study on the impacts on our local salmonid populations by the massive overfishing of other countries' commercial fishing fleets. Russia and China have had devastating impacts on our salmon runs as far back as the 70's. It won't matter how many billions of dollars we spend or how many dams are taken out if we don't stop the over fishing..
Tuuladan aad buunbuuninayso naga daa adeer.
My takeaway is that 👽 are probing us to figure out how to help us past galactic spillways.
Fish bible 😂
"This 500 page document, prepared each year in collaboration with a litany of partners..."  I'm sure.  Like piranhas around a drowning  buffalo.
Wow. Stuff like this makes me hopeful for humanity 😊
So many gorgeous fishos.
You can't over emphasize how important salmon are to the ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest. They're the keystone species of the region and are vitally important conveyors of nutrients from the ocean thousands of miles inland throughout the region.
As a Hermiston local working in electric infrastructure, this is SUPER cool to watch! Thanks for coming out here!
I like the evolution of "teacher-y concepts of engineering" in the direction of "Tom Scott for unseen infrastructure" that your channel has taken. I hope that's a label that you don't take to offense to, it's intended as a compliment :)
Why are you saying turbans instead of turbines?
@PracticalEngineering train railway love what ????
This is just mesmerising.
..👍
damm
And yet ower fish in washing are on a steady 40 year decline ...so they need to stop patty those backs and pockets to lie for them
Would be interesting to have a follow-up on the impacts with respect to flooding the reservoir area, changing the flow, etc. The stuff that's a "one time cost" but has huge impacts
Bonaville dam
A rubber fish
Sorry fish are afraid of vibrations and very sensitive..
Brilliant, thank you for making this. This is one of the best engineering sites on Youtube.
I remember my family use to pay whole month salary just to tour a dam site. Internet really is a blessing.
Great video as always!  Keep on teaching!  I wonder what happens when a person catches a fish with a sensor embedded.  Is there a risk of accidently eating it?
💔🥺the boys did it again Blacks 💔💔 https://youtu.be/ccEbR0DAV3g?si=Xc4V3LgfXnB4odH4
It's amazing how much effort is invested in keeping both parties' interests (humans and fish) in balance. This was an interesting watch.
We just lost over 500,000 baby salmon to a dam on the Klamath River. They are not worth the destruction they cause.
This is a great educational channel.
I wonder how many fish got hit by the boat prop on his way up to do this story? What was your carbon  footprint on this trip?
Thanks for coming to PNNL! It is great that you came here.
I think this is the most informative video on this channel so far. I love it!
So Grady, what did you think about the NorthWest?  If I could go back to living in Idaho, I would, but family and retirement base me in North Texas.  Lived in Idaho for 6 years, and there is not much better than the clean air and honest weather of the NorthWest. Of course, getting a chance to fish the Kokanee Salmon and Steelhead (and Rainbow) Trout and Truly Renewable Power is icing on the cake!
Grady, you are the guy I would be if I was smarter and more ambitious!
1.21 gigawatts 😮😮😮😮
Two things that made me hate this video: The consistent mispronunciation of turbine and juvenile.  1.) A turban (from Persian دوربند‌, durband; via Middle French turbant) is a type of headwear based on cloth winding.   2.) Decimus Junius Juvenalis, known in English as Juvenal, was a Roman poet active in the late first and early second century AD. He is the author of the collection of satirical poems known as the Satires.
Can you imagine the fish passage system(s) they could have built in the 40's-50s if they could have harnessed the information they are getting now from the questions they have been asking the last few decades.
"fish generally don't read signs" 😂
Shoutout to ecologically-friendly civil engineering. All my homies respect the USACE
Your videos rock! Thanks for helping all us non-engineers understand how things work. I work for a utility and I've found your content invaluable.
Simple, they don't
A 22:22 video 22 hours ago? 22 gates?
Great presentation!  Now you should tackle the much more destructive development and operation of the lower four dams on the Snake River.  These seem to have only one value:  holding down shipping costs for ag products in Idaho.  Not much irrigation, little to no fish passage, easily replaceable power production.  Good opportunity for your style of research.
Whenever you say turban, I think of a certain type of head-wear. 👳
As the FERC inspector of fish passage facilities at non federal dams here in the northeast US (retired), it was gratifying to watch the Corps efforts in trying to balance energy generation and natural resources at their power facilities. We do not have the size and scale of those facilities here so the fish passage designs are much smaller but no less important and much more varied. If you're a hydro guy you know its the only real renewable power resource. It's too bad the Klamath River projects could not be retrofitted similarly and instead just removed.
Makes one wonder: Are other countries, particularly in Africa or Asia, undertaking these steps to preserve their ecosystem?
As someone who works in maintenance, I can't help but wonder how many of the new measures and policies are confusing, contradictory, counterproductive, or not cost effective.  I'm sure the net result has been positive, both ecological and economically, but I'm also sure there's plenty of fascinating ups and downs surrounding each attempt at change.
What happens if somebody bakes fish with the tiny sensor inside? Is it safe to consume?
Waiting for you to do a series on oil/gas wells. Exploration, drilling, logging, reservoir simulation, productions, completions, etc.  there are so many aspects with a plethora of engineering knowledge packed into one field. Petroleum engineering has so many aspects and I love everything about it!
dam cool video (sorry I had to)
still not enough to go back to the future though.
Dude you as an engineer should know it's pronounce  (Tur Bine) "Turbine, not (turban).  A turban is something that somebody wears on their head...  🤦🏼 there are so many people I've seen and I mean by the thousands whether it be YouTube or people I've met that incorrectly say turbine. if you don't believe me look it up in a dictionary.
Very well done, I had no idea how well thought-out these efforts are.
That little anesthetized fish… 😮
The thrill seeker salmon spend all day repeatedly climbing the fish ladder and going down through the turbine. Their version of skydiving.
Grady, and everybody at the dam and river system who helped inform this video: OUT OF THE PARK video and education.  Thank you all so much!
Turbine = Turban??
https://youtube.com/shorts/0mTp6GeVsSE?si=0lCAawZ1InXE2_E4
why was it important they where hand nailed  and was that done with a hammer or was the nail gun just hand placed
All that work to help the fish. That's very interesting.  And now I still have to find out  how canned salmon is made. Great vid.
Another dam video😂
90% of fish survive? I feel like those aren't good stats lol
This is actually a question I hadn't considered, so the explanation is quite fascinating.   The engineering is quite impressive, actually. Especially things like how they try to mitigate problems like predators.
super insightfull thanks :)
This was amazingly interesting. Thank you!
Good video, i wish you had a longer one with just the staff talking. Not saying you didn't make a great narrative but sometimes the interviews make such great content. Maybe another video with less edits and more conversations?  Just a request.
they made a fish powered generator?
13:30 TIL there is a thing called a, "juvenile bypass pipe" ♥️
I absolutely loved watching the documentary! Please please more!!! Can't wait for the video on the fish ladders. Also an extended cut of the tour of the facility like another person already mentioned would be awesome!
Absolutely fascinating!! As you say, infrastructure designed for non-humans. Great video, thanks Grady!
Thank you for covering this, I’ve wondered about this for ages!
I deathly love you videos and watch them religiously, but can you please tweeze those right bottom mouth hairs that get passed by the razor. Love the videos but those two to three hairs are distracting as heck.
Man, Brady finds the best stuff to cover.
When is the next practical construction video?!!
Hahaha that ending, yes the blue and pink paint job took research and a whole team of award winning home decorators hundreds of thousands of dollars to come up with the idea so the painter has to take the loss to allow for the set price tag and yes we needed millions to design a realistic fish tail with realistic movement when self winding watches have been a thing for like a hundred years and all the engineers sitting here winking at each other while they watch this video in there Mercedes on the 16inch screen while getting a service from their hot concubine while driving down the los angeles strip.  People just dont know how hard the upper class work so their lives dont fall apart around them while patting themselves on the back. Good work, saved some fish and didnt pay a cent out of your own pocket. Millions of people chipped in.
Could you explain if and why they decided against fish Survivable turbines - because at least here in Germany there are Turbine types that just allow fish to swim through unharmed :)
Consider that this is the 4th major dam across the Columbia river, so consider the fatality rate at dam like this and multiply that by how far up/down the Columbia the fish migrates.
Fun to see you covering something in my backyard
at 3:14  bro that seems highly dangerous.. anything caught in that rotating thing and its done.  Why are there no protective glass or anything there, so someone's hair or what ever cant possibly get in there ?  I hope someone doesn't bring their kids to work.. a little kid putting their hand there and the kid will be instantly dead.
Amazing video ❤
Thank you so much for bringing up such an important topic! It would be so great to have such structures installed in every hydro power stations
That animation in the background at 15:53 absolutely sent me
Thank you for this video Destin. I’m getting smarter every day! 😊
Although Turbine Can be Pronounced two ways...I don't call it a head wrap!
This entire story was fascinating. Nice to see that some peopel care about other living beeings that much :)
Yay!  Thanks Grady!  (somewhat later...)  So what happens when the birds figure out there's a high density fry dispensing tube not that far away?  ...and what about fish cannons?  no mention?...  might be a smaller river tool...
I thought they came out filleted and battered.😃😃
I love the nexus of Biology and engineering
Awesome example of humans working with nature rather than against.
The fish window is just the best.
The Snake river dams need to come down.  They are not needed for flood control, wind power contracts are cheaper than snake river power, and they are not needed for commodity transport.
Grady, your content is inspirational. Excellent!
Grady tell us how racism is killing the fish bruv.
oooo, that pressure difference problem could be reduced with a multi stage turbine. though that could be too difficult for a hydro plant like this. who knows.
9:21 No need. Lampreys travel alongside Salmon. They grab them with their suction cup mouth..
🇺🇸  .amen
As a Dutch biologist I found it a very interesting episode. Tnx!  In the Netherlands we also have dams and sluices but to keep our feet dry. Over the last years these also have been equiped with fish stairs. In the city of Utrecht, you can even ring a doorbell to open the sluice for the fish to get in and out of the city canals. Check "visdeurbel" on google 😊
I just drove by the McNary dam yesterday, as well as Bonneville and The Dalles dams. Hydroelectric power is a big deal for us in the PNW since the majority of our power comes from it.
"Turban"
never heard someone say turbans so often in my life.
this is so woke
So... what efficiency is traded for the fish? The devil is in the details, how many fish per megawatt lost?
You can visit the dam and tour it. The also have a dual museum there as well. One about the electrical history of the dam and another about the native Americans who lived there.
"And cultural importance." Cultural importance to WHO, PE? And I wonder what criticisms those people have about these dams illegally installed on their land?
7:10 It's comforting to know that even an expert on a complex system gets confused by it at times.
2:19 I see you with your best dang tour guide KEKW
14:25 is that aljon filipino?
this guy's every video gets on trending list. that's how good he is.
Fascinating,  thank you
👍
I'm calling bs, I live in Washington, you spent two days here and it was sunny the whole time?!  No way.
Hmm... if the goal is to reduce the total pressure drop on a fish as it passes through a turbine, the turbine must extract less energy from the water. If the goal is to reduce the rate of pressure drop the fish experiences... multiple turbine stages, like in a jet engine compressor, only backwards?
im grateful such a channel exists. so much hard work and dedication, thank you so much
2 dams taken out of the klamath river california this last month
I am appreciative of the research done to try to balance everything.
Good common sense by the powers that be. Haha clearly you don't live here. You're talking about the same people that stopped underbrush burning, then wondered why we had out of control wildfires.
7:21 sorry I didn't know this was smarter every day
I live right next to this!!!! So cool! Def would be amazing to tag along and learn with you on this tour :)
wooowwwww
I always thought civil engineering was cool, just can’t imagine having to do it for the rest of my life
Huh I totally learned something, I had no clue it would be pressure change that makes the turbine bad for fish. I truly was expecting it to be fish blender.
They have made a very impressive effort. Someone hire them for future improvements. !:- )
Additional costs: historical settlements being submerged upstream.
HUGE missed opportunity at 10:56 to say "SoFISHticated" instead of "Sophisticated" Lol
I'm happy to see changes to dams that reduce our negative impact to our surroundings. This is mother earth and we only got this 1! Hope we can spread this kind of self-awarenss to every other type of human intervention!
A recent study at Oregon State university showed that 9 billion dollars have been spent to install things like fish ladders and it doesn't work. Native salmon are in steep decline and hatchery fish aren't increasing in numbers. At one time 16 million salmon used to plied this river and now 1.5 do. It all looks impressive but a little perspective kinds of takes the shine out of it.
What did the fish say when it hit the wall? "Dam"
They aren't "turbans" The "i" sound is long "Tur-byne" Still watched the whole video, it was fascinating
P❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Best dam tour guide! Haha
Ah man. Right down the street! If I’d have known I would have bought you lunch somewhere!
Please make video in multiple languages 🙏🏻
that's great but how do fishes cross dam upstream when they migrate and spawn?
Very cool! This answers a bunch of stuff Id been wondering about 👍
Oh man I grew up in Richland and see used to fish by McNary dam as a kid.
Thats a lot of views for first day!
As an animal lover and an enigineer this video was just amazing, you should really make more videos like this, I love that finally humans are using their intelligence to care for animals and not only us
I went there for a 5th grade field trip years ago. Really cool to see it in one of your videos!
Why do americans think the e at the end of turbine is silent
Fu ads
And we wonder why electricity has become so expensive...
I just read an article about the decommissioning of several dams where the fish suffered (and died) from the pressure changes of being passed from the bottom of the dam lake to the downside.
For the James Bay project designed in the 1970s, they made the decision to not care for the fish.  A number of rivers were fully damed to be diverted to the north, so fish can't swim to the dam sicne downriver lacks sufficient flow. (the Rupert River diversion in 2012 is differemt and may have a fish ladded, not sure).  The diversion of many rivers into La Grande River resulted in a flow rate from Radisson to james Bay that was felt wouyld be too high for fish to swim upriver.  (enough that they moved a townsite of Fort George on an island in river to Chissasibi due to fear of erosion.  The end result is that upriver from the first dams are only fresh water species with separate population in each basin.   At the time it was felt that voters in the south wouldn't care about preserving fish in the north.  Unsure how much salmon exists in James/Hudson Bay which would have the drive to go up those rivers.  There are still smaller rivers that function normally.
I’m very impressed at the progress over the last few decades in dam management. The ecological impact used to be a much smaller part of the administration of these structures. It’s great to see these changes
amazing video like always, though I am curious if that trash can at 5:45 is actually used for hard hats lol. Just curious xD
Turbins...
Excellent video, and I'm looking forward to more on the subject.  I live in eastern Washington State, and our power infrastructure is amazing.  This side of the state runs primarily on hydropower, both small and large scale, plus about 10% from the Columbia Generating Station, a mature BWR nuclear plant.  No major fossil fuel use aside from the occasional small load-leveling plant and backup generators for emergencies.  On top of being very clean, power here is cheaper than pretty much anywhere else in the country (I pay just 5 - 6 cents per kilowatt-hour at home).  On top of cheap, reliable, renewable, & non-polluting power, the dams are very important for flood control, irrigation, and keeping lakes full for recreation during our dry summers.  Plus the tamed rivers allow for very efficient and environmentally-friendly bulk transportation for various industries including the massive amount of agriculture that goes on in this half of the state.  The dams are very important to Washington, but unfortunately certain political and environmental groups are pushing hard to have them torn down - fish migration being a primary reason.  Of course, those groups have no real plans to replace all the power generation capacity and other benefits that will be lost with the dams, aside from vague & miniscule "funding" to figure it out after the fact.  What we really need are solutions that take care of everyone, fish and human alike.  If you just go off a lot of the hippie articles on the subject, you'd think the dam operators couldn't care less about the wildlife.  So thanks for showing how people are actually taking it seriously and working hard to find those solutions.
Showed this to my girlfriend who studies environmental science. She mentioned a book called The Organic Machine by Richard White, on the history of the Columbia River, and has details on the dam and fish as well. Seems like many of the details covered in this video are also touched on in the book!
Lampreys are invasive in many places because they are eldritch monsters, the spawn of eldritch abominations. But here, they are native, so we must take care of them. Lampreys and salmon are threatened by pelicans, which are eldritch monsters, the spawn of eldritch abominations. But they, too, are native. The goal, then, is to have pelicans eating the right amount of lampreys and salmon, not too many but not too few. The pressure change is harmful to salmon but lampreys are not harmed by it because they are eldritch monsters, the spawn of eldritch abominations. What Vishvas Chalishazar said at 16:33 is really good: "It doesn't have to be that--what's good for the grid is necessarily bad for the fish." This is absolutely true and is a really important sentiment in many areas elsewhere as well. For example, it doesn't have to be that what's good for the ecosystem is necessarily bad for the eldritch monsters, the spawn of eldritch abominations.
“Couple hundred thousand” making it seem like that’s a lot of fish. Maybe at this point of time sure but historically no. Just no. Records indicated millions up stream point and this isn’t even at that point
Love ya man but wishing it was more environment oriented.
Thanks, Grady! Love your channel! I think in a different life I would have been a “good” civil engineer ‘cause I’m entertained and fascinated by your videos. Great work!
3:20 man i don't think i'd be able to hold myself from touching those spinning shafts lmao
miles miles,, u lived now in Texas 😂
How does a gigawatt power half a million homes? My house is using multiple kilowatt hours throughout the day, more than 1kWh per hour. So wouldn't that be 1000 homes, not 1/2 a million? What am I missing?
6:31 You should do a video about how fish swim against the current. Aren't there eddies in the flow that the fish use to move upstream against the current? They don't just use brute force, right?
So many fishy things going on in there
Thank you for coming to visit my hometown! We have a lot of science/engineering things here. I expect your next video will be showcasing some of the efforts out at Hanford.
Don’t see China doing this
Did they let you bring home/ catch some fish at least? I was so expecting a HelloFresh ad, cause it couldn't get any fresher
you can play ctf/cp in this fascility
Fantastic fantastic video! You gave equal space to the ecological and utility needs around this structure and showed that the people in charge are reasonable and smart about addressing both. That's the kind of ingenuity that makes me hopeful for the future!
There’s way more going into this than I would think. Pretty cool.
Great video! I've had the privilege of working for both Walla Walla USACE and PNNL and they both do great work.
16:03 STURGEON :DDDD
9:24  I’m so excited!  I was reading up on Fish Ladders (and then Eel Ladders) and all that, *as well as their effectiveness* , to try and see if there is a such thing as “green hydropower”.  This will clear things up more!  Granted I need to read actual papers and whatnot, and of course the construction “cost” notwithstanding it seems like they can somewhat work.  The main bits i am unsure on especially are the non-Salmon (or other “big name” wildlife), so eel ladders being mentioned has me excited.  Another Bit: Controlled Sediment Release was mentioned a while back on the news, i need to read up on it, but basically allowed a *little* flooding to keep the sediment flowing / make the river *slightly* more natural.  Granted you may have mentioned this in the video, if so ill edit this out lol, enough rambling back to watching!
Turban turban turban turban turban turban wheee!👳
Always knew about "fish ladders"  Learned (and even understood a bit) even as a toddler, but never gave a thought to the "other end" of it.  Really, REALLY informative video. My only regret to seeing this is not being able to go on the tours WITH you.  Great work, none the less!!!!
Great job Grady.  Wish I knew you were in my neighborhood, I would have said hi!  This is such a complex and important issue for peoplein the northwest, I'm glad you've given it such a thorough review.  I worked at Rocky Reach dam during a summer internship over 30 years ago and we were collecting flow velocity profile data for the inlet of the turbines to improve fish screen design.  The designs at the time had a serious problem with fishing being impinged on the screens and we were working hard to improve survivability.  The current designs may be complicated to maintain but they are critcal to the success of the overall system.  Thanks for the coverage.
Need an extended version 45 min is fine
The people will be fish
TLDR, your tax dollars go towards a fish Waterpark, and thats a good thing
They keep that please cleannnn
I don't want to see the shaft of that generator I want to see the lathe that turned it.😢
Thank you for to spending the time to explain this to us!    It’s really nice to see a hydroelectric dam balancing the needs of nature with the needs of humans.  We can’t live without nature, but it can live without us.  Everyone working on this dam seems to understand that most important fact 🙏
I really want to see the video from the test fish they made to go through the turbine.
The impact of fish on upstream ecosystem (and the economic impact as well) is FAR worth the investment.
About 95% of the fish survive going through a dam.  That sounds pretty good.    But there are a series of dams on the river.  So if there are 8 dams each with a 95% survival rate then the overall survival rate is .95^8=66%.  Add to that the bird predation and very few fish survive the entire trip.  Add to that commercial and recreational fishing and it’s even worse.   Everybody is doing their best to maximize the runs but it’s a tough problem.
Thanks!
I toured this dam in late 1980's. Pleased to learn PNNL continues to learn and improve its mission, operations, maintenance while teaching the world.
The quality of your content is just fantastic. Interviews, tours, detailed explanations. Fascinating stuff.
No one damns the almighty Columbia better than British Columbians
Is that a God dam?
I'd be interested in the economics of this. Are they self sufficient? How much does all this cost to run vs the generated electricty revenue. What the cost is of the electricity to the end users etc.
Amazing!!
your account is billed annually, that means automatic, not yearly. I would scribe if you would correct this scam!!!!
Congratulations for being #6 on trending!!😊
your videos have always been great but this one is especially amazing. Love how much you highlight the combination of biology and engineering
Both of these dams are within 20miles of me...
Awesome video! Super thanks to everyone who made it happen!
what happens to the predictors who consume these tags? I'm thinking plastic ingestion. I lived on the Mica During Construction. A lot fish and wild life were in evolved.
Absolutely fascinating.
Please do an in depth video on fire apparatus pumps, as well as their discharges and practical hydraulic calculations required by their pump operators!
For the toddlers complaining about the pronunciation of "turbine," please note that there is more than one correct way: tɜːʳbaɪn and tɜːʳbɪn are both fine. Instead of posting silly comments, you could have looked up the word in a dictionary.
I've seen a lot of dam videos, but may be one of the best dam videos I've seen in a while. Lots good dam information while showing plenty of happy dam people. Great dam video.
My country had an evangelical PM for a while and he literally believed the world was made for us so we couldn't ever do enough damage for it to be a problem.  What a scary day we live in where there's access to nearly all of human knowledge at our fingertips and people who are so blatantly ignorant can hold positions of power.  He refused to accept any proposals on improving the environmental impact or pollution from heavy industries.  Personally I think it was just a belief of convenience like they often are, just so him and his friends can make a quick buck off the detriment of our society and planet.
It’s really cool to see an episode here because McNary is in my backyard. I was born and raised Umatilla county.
I like videos that talk about the continuing development of structures that were originally built decades ago
What did the fish say when he bonked his head?  Dam
you are the dude
I dont understand why fish (salmon in particular) are suddenly considered so valuable. I get it, they certainly have value, but the value we put on them today seems insane.  Also, building a dam may hurt one population but help another. It seems odd that if you build one project that hurts species A but helps species B then we build another project that helps species A and hurts species B. Environmentalists will fight both projects, they sometimes seem to just want nothing to change ever instead of being willing to accept that the net is the same.
Thanks for coming to PNNL!  It is great that you came here.
Neat
🐟
Welcome to the Columbia Basin\Tri-Cities! Amazing to see my childhood home featured. There is so much cool technology going on there, PNNL is just the start! The dams are a very hot topic right now for sure.
Thank you for the educational video.
Powerful turbens
The constant discussion of fish in a serious scientific context is amusing, but I think the animation in the background at 15:50 is my favorite. Also fish filters and fish pumps
Fish don't survive dams.  830,000 salmon just died going through Iron Gate Dam on the Klamath River.  They are removing four dams on this river to help these fish recover, but its not going very well so far.  It will be years before measurable improvement happens.
I hope to meet you someday!
Another great video Grady, this one in particular was super interesting to me because I work with fish along dammed rivers every day!   I actually work in fisheries, specifically with anadromous fishes (fish that go upriver to spawn) like sturgeon, striped bass, eels, and shad. I can definitely speak to the degree of impacts that dams have on these species- most of the populations of fish we have in my stretch of the US have historic breeding grounds that are dozens or even hundreds of miles inland, but now they are restricted to base of the first dams they meet, which are typically not far upstream and are more often than not just simple, dated lock & dam designs which function purely as flood control and lack many of the incredible ecologically minded features you showed in the video. Often times these dams don’t have suitable water conditions or bottom substrate for effective recruitment right at the base, which only exacerbates the issues. Another issue that dams create for anadromous fishes is that during even relatively minor flood events, scheduled flow pulses can often result in scouring and sediment deposit, which can sequester or displace entire year-classes of fish eggs if they occur during or just after spawning events.  Sorry if this reads like mad ramblings- I’m just excited that your channel finally covered a part of infrastructure that relates to what I love and do every day at my job!
tur-bins. LMAO. You talk a little funny
Love your content ❤ Please keep doing it!!
Great video, thank you. And I'm really looking forward to the fish ladder video!!
You did not need a 22 minute video to say the answer tf
Amazing video. One question I have is with all the costs it must take to do this for the fish, how is it still profitable?
If you just skip around to random places, Grady sounds like your typical door to door solar salesman, where everything is a buzzword, catchphrase and a positive feeling vague statement.   It’s just a bunch a junk.  This channel used to be good😢
Pro Tip: keep your hands out of your pockets
Thanks for the video, thru the 80's and 90's we would go to one of the dams on the Columbia to watch the the fish ladders. It all ways made a great place for a picnic. All so help build the the juvenile fish barge fuel station.
This is the 22 minute answer to my how fish survive turbine question Ive been waiting for my whole life.
I look forward to the lampray video. They are unglamorous and deserve more attention. You do videos and unglamorous infrastructure so it's a good combo. Does anywhere have infrastructure to help earth worms or something. :⁠-⁠)
DoE ftw! <3
I don't know the rules and all for fishing there but let's say I'm fishing down stream by the time I get that fish home cut it open and find out oh no it had a battery and a tracker in it it's too late what do I do call up and be like hey I caught one of your fish
2:20  The project manager looks like a alien with pitch black eyes
i couldn't even hear what you were saying when you said "Hi! This is Grady, and this is Practical Engineering." this episode. and i couldn't be happier 😂jk but, glad to see an episode where you directly tackle an environmental/sustainability topic! (considering you are a Texan, too heh. just kidding ;)) <3 no matter how much you wanna focus on technology, economy or deep politics, there is just no way anyone can survive without a healthy ecosystem which those can often destroy to a pretty crazy extent, and people want to LIVE not just survive - we need fish for all the fishermen of our beautiful planet, and if they have no spawning grounds (in the case of salmon), that certainly leads to issues, no matter what your personal political beliefs are :).
Would love to  see you do a video on the Klamath river dam removal, or a similar effort. It would be cool to understand why it makes engineering and economic sense to remove so many dams and other factors at play.
Welcome to my neck of the woods... Sort of, I'm north of Seattle. I've done a hike a couple of times now that goes across the dam between Ross Lake and Lake Diablo. It's a beautiful drive. I do wonder how they manage fish at that dam because it is about a 500ft drop from Ross to Diablo
Wooow 🤯 🎉🤯 All of those people working in this field they're all amazing by doing this amazing job which half of it we don't understand 😢 I thought my work as a meteorologist is hard to explain learning about about your job is really amazing thank you so much and really big big thanks for the makers of this video it's very amazing ❤ thank you all
But the real question is, is there a dam water fountain?
I wrote multiple papers in my undergrad sustainable engineering program railing against dams. I still don't think they're cost/benefit is in their favor. Having said that, its reassuring that steps like these are being taken at least at some dams.
Thanks to all the hardworking folks who shared their knowledge for the making of this video. Your work matters, even if folks aren't aware of what goes on. ❤❤❤
What's the cost of all that claptrap compared to the value of the electricity generated and the salaries of all the extra people needed?
10:30 -> For anyone not wanting to watch the full video
Fascinating and so well done! Lots of brilliant, dedicated and practical professionals at PNNL and at the dams, making a difference (generally out of the public eye). Thanks for the meticulous attention to detail and thorough "reporting!"
Grady they need to give you a discovery show (I know its not super lucrative but i think you’d have more support to do more things like this and the lift station series)  Which have been awesome videos
Fish do not survive going thru turbines. 1,000,000 salmon hatchlings just died in California last week in a release on the Klamath River
Certainly an interesting thing to see in my recommendations
Dam good video
Not gonna lie, these videos where you go to locations and talk about the science and engineering behind everything are my favorite.
If there was a dam gift shop at the end of the dam tour I hope you picked up some dam souvenirs for the kids.
I am so happy dams care for thouse traveling wildlife. I had no idea thay do it. And hated dams for this. Thank for all this efford to make it natural again.
We need more dams.
Hydro dams chop up a percentage of small fish, and prevent or chop up most medium/large fish or prevent them from migrating past the turbines.
This is so much better than hearing whining people scream "Tear down the dam!"  I hope fish passage becomes more and more efficient, not only so people stop complaining but for the fisheries to thrive.
Infishtructure
I leave the 1000th comment, 999 number not satisfying  😂
nice
"... the incredible technology"  Silicone fish mechanically flopping.  (not belittling the research, just hilarious visual)
Imagine working at the dam. I bet they have fresh Sushi every day for lunch.
RIP old Herman the Sturgeon
I once wrote a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers in grade school about how juvenile salmon got down. I was doing a science project about some people wanting to have the Snake River dams removed. I was so excited to get a letter back from an engineer answering my question.
I'd love to see some of the raw interview footage, there's probably some fascinating stuff in them that just isn't conducive to a produced video
I know you’re a SATX local do you think k you could ever get a video at canyon lake TX? I always wondered about the little hydro plant at the bottom. Beautiful lake too!
Me and my family would pass the McNary all the time when passing through the Columbia Gorge for trips. So exciting to finally see the inside! Great video, Grady!
I always loved water infrastructure and found the fish transportsystems interesting!
Now I'm curious as to how you pronounce "turban"..  😄
I believe human beings and fish can co-exist peacefully
This was an awesome video and very well done. I learned a lot from my dad on the engineering behind fish safe pumps and even got the opportunity many times as a kid to go with him to test and inspect the pumps (he is a Biological Systems Engineer that specializes in fish passage). This video was cool to see the additional engineering to protect fish while enabling human use of the waterways.
Since moving to southwest Oregon (Ashland) three years past, I've been entranced with watersheds, dams, salmon, dying fir trees, and such. So this vid was particularly enlightening for me. Thanks! (And now I'm wondering about the dams being removed (have been removed?) on the Klamath. What were the considerations regarding salmon?

Your tax dollars in action. Remember PNNL is a US Department of Energy National Lab and the Army Corp of Engineers is well the army Corp. When people wonder what their tax dollars pay for it's things like this, long term and "unprofitable" research that advances humanity. It would have been great if @practicalengneeringchannel mentioned that all of the folks doing good work is the government at work.

Rest of the World: "Turbine" 'Murica: "Turban" 👳🏾‍♂  kek 😂
This is one of my favorite videos you've made! I really enjoyed the look at science and engineering in the field as well as seeing you talk to the various researchers at the facility!
Great vid—also I love your shirt in the intro!
Ordered your book set for my grandsons.
This caliber of excellent video is why I love this channel.
Awesome, awesome, awesomeness.  You answered a zillion questions I had about fish migration and dams.  I'm a degreed mechanical engineer, and did not feel talked down to, nor would a welder, plumber, electrician, housewife, grade school kid or carpenter for that matter.    Absolutely excellent approach and tone.  Perfect level of detail.  I don't know how you do it.  I've generated all manner of adult technical training, and I could not possibly have done such a well rounded job as well as you have, sir.    You rock.  I'm just sayin'...  ...
I just want to know what it would feel like if a human - ideally, me - was to attempt passage around/past/through the turbines?  How far would my body fragments be scattered, how large would they be, how long would the process take if there is full compliance, and would there be any adverse, long-term environmental impacts inflicted, if I were to pursue this course of removing myself from the planet? TIA for any clarifying details you can provide.
This guy lives in Maine..he knows nothing about hydro dams here in the west, and the pump gen plants which pump at night and gen in the day...Im laughing again...and I worked for DOE for decades BUR and BLM...I have a little knowledge and facts instead of this mouthpiece..do not believe this youtube garbage people dont be sheeple
I live 10 minutes away from this dam neat to see inside
Thanks PNNL
I found this extremely interesting, thank you for the video! Recently we lost over 800,000 Salmon fry passing through the Iron Gate dam on the Klamath River due to gas bubble disease. Apparently it has to do with pressure changes as they are passing through.
Super great production. I really like how  you showed the various disciplines coming together.  Super hard work for sure.
I have a relatively unrelated question. How do fish and other aquatic mammals survive seismic testing?
It would be interesting to see what you find about the Conowingo Dam and the controversy and dilemmas it presents to the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland, and the ecology of an aging dam in a large estuary.
Thank you for sharing and explaining this information. ❤
grady's hard hat is made of chocolate and is delicious
I CANT wait for the fish ladder video!!
I like that somebody looked at that rotating deathtrap at 1:47 and said: "Eh, a simple railing should be fine!" X-D
I live on the Colombia near Bonneville Dam but have never been to McNary. Great to see so many people working hard to retrofit our power infrastructure to be less impactful to the natural processes of the river. Great video!
We can be a cruel species sometimes, especially in our early age. But it is admirable to hear about the thought and money put into making sure fish can still swim through, even thinking they didn’t leave the river.   Makes you hope, if we ever get invaded by some super smart alien race, they may have morals like we do.   Not saying we treat every animal the same, but the average human does care about animals and random species that have nothing to do with us.

Awesome! We live in Camas downriver from McNary. Very cool info, thanks for sharing
"You sir, are a fish"-A guy that hates rats or something
Am i the only one that felt existential dread seeing the stairs the lead directly into the giant spinning steel cylinder
I've driven by this one and most of the other Columbia River dams so many times. Getting to Bonneville Dam meant you had finally left the worst of P-town's traffic or you were about to drive into it.
Turbin or turbine ☠️  They're a bit different 😂
"Best dam tour guide" NICE
I did an internship there! that's awesome!
No matter how you spin it...dams are one of the most destructive human interventions that we destroy ecosystems with.
Grady, you should comment on how Texas water infrastructure is going to severely be lacking this summer and how we need more lakes. Canyon lake (which provides water for most all of northern San Antonio), will be hugely tested this summer if we don't get some flooding....
So close :)
You need to go visit Intake Screens Inc, who build the fish screens on the dams.
And now you know why your next electricity bill will be one million dollars…..
Half a million homes, sure, but can it power a flux capacitor??
Reminds me of going on a school field trip way back in the day 😆
Thanks for coming to PNNL and sharing our hydropower and fish passage science with the world!
Man. You are a blessing my man. Content of this quality is hard to come by. Thank you.
Dam good video
I remember first reading about that salmon ladder decades ago, but I was today years old when I finally understood how it worked. As interesting as the dam is in itself, thanks for including the fish ladder, and I look forward to your forthcoming video about it. 👍
Thanks for coming and working with my husband and his team, it was great meeting you guys! This turned out great. 🎉
I'd love to see a collab with smarter every day
That's some dam fishy research going on there.....
Darn, need another way to make fish sticks!
The cutest thing I've seen all year is that nerdy little fish engineer with his little charts so happy to dive into his weird fish science... Nerds are the best people in the world and nothing is better than seeing a nerd get happy about their thing whether hydro-engineering fish science or Sailor Moon. You go fish engineer guy
How does one pronounce combine? How does one pronounce turbine?
Canadian slow speed turbines save fish and make power. Search it .
I live in east central Alabama. We have around 20 public lakes in Alabama ,only one of which is a natural lake. We have yet to see a river we didn't want to dam for electricity. There is a very large dam in the city o grew up in that we used to illegally go down to and play on the large outcropping of rocks. It was rather dangerous because we never knew when the electric company would turn on the water and flood the area we were playing in. The senior class of the highschool used to spray paint in giant letters and numbers CLASS OF ... In various art styles before the electric company put up lots of fencing and the police started prosecuting anyone caught on the rocks.
wonder how much energy collected by the dam is immediately spent on this fish program
When they put all these power dams in originally there was a lot of justification for the environmental impact they had even before they were installed and it was found that they had harmful impacts but the capitalism model was allowed to superscead the impacts on the land and the people in the name of making money. They don't invest before they know the risk when it comes to an investor pouring money into something. It's always about the money and control and not about what is morally acceptable by every man women and child!
Show us ALL the footage! ALL OF IT!
I don't like fish.  Fish stink.
"Where do we get the dam bait?"
2:20 that was smooth 😂
There was something fishy about the info in this episode.
THE BEST DAM GUIDE EVER .... OHHH THE PUNNSS ...
I grew up there and my brother in-law and I would swim by the powerhouse discharge before the fish hatchery was built. We would hold onto the rip rap boulders and dive down with a mask and snorkel to retrieve fishing tackle and sell it back to the sturgeon fishermen. Some people yelled at us and told us that we would drown, but we didn't listen, and we were fine. We would ride our bikes down to the dam in the summer and take tours like the VIP tour that you got before they started the extra security measures that they implemented after 9/11.  After 9/11 they installed a BUNCH of fencing around the dam, and when I took my daughter on a tour later, I asked the security guard what good are the fences, and shouldn't they be taller, because weren't the twin towers attacked by airplanes? He wasn't amused! 🤣🤣🤣
"Best dam tour guide..."  Well played Grady!
What an amazing place, and what wonderful folks there - dedicated isn't a strong enough word for the level of effort going into running that dam! Really loved this look into just exactly HOW humans are working to co-exist with the river.
I always assumed that the fish would naturally come to avoid being that close to the Dam due to sudden and severe pressure gradient changes.
Dams don't exist. It's all a conspiracy.
Great information. I am happy the necessary infrastructure is being developed to help the fish
This is a lie, they don’t actually survive
So they already have cyberfish in development. Interesting, so how long until we can expect sharks with FRICKIN' LAZER BEAMS ON THEIR HEADS?! 😆
Dam great video about those dam fish!  Now, where can I get some dam bait.
This is by far the best dam video I've ever seen. Thanks Grady!
Wait does that say #5 on Trending!???
It is super fascinating learning about how engineering and infrastructure are made to account for biological factors.
WOW! Thank you for another excellent video!
There are many ways to allow the fish to move upstream.  Those in power just want to prove to the common sense people that they can force their will on others. Many dams created miles and miles of wildlife habitat!  Many dozens of species of animals, insects, and flora benefit from Dams.  Of course, during droughts, Dams provide water to humans, animals, and food producers.  But none of this makes any difference to the arrogant. Some rivers will become almost dry during the time of low rainfall and that will not be good for humans or animals! Remember it was the environmentalists who were the cause of wildfires that destroyed billions of trees! They kept fire prevention measures from being enforced in California forests.  Those fires caused lumber prices to explode upwards which caused home prices to go up! Not counting the millions and millions of animals who died in those fires! It is the senseless but powerful environmental groups who destroy our resources and timber,  not the normal citizens.
Hey, I know Tim😂 he's a solid guy
One of your best!
Wow, amazing the expense this takes just for fish. I get it, but still quite astounding.
No downstream sushi?
Way more complicated than i ever thought. Very cool!
Let's build nuclear power plants and tear down the dams.  It's not that complicated, it only requires education about how safe nuclear is.
"A fish cathedral" First time in my life I've ever heard these two words in conjunction, nevertheless, amusingly fitting.
Ewwww, Mynoks... 9:04
I always wondered what that pipe going to the middle of the river was. Great video as always, happy to see something from my area!
Great video, and wonderful information given especially in a place where damns are in danger.
Finally, the trout population won't be severely affected
Oregon local here. I'm curious how many people corrected you on your pronunciation of the word turbine, because you don't wear turbines on your head lol
“Best dam tour guide”—that’s never gonna get old 😂
That little to much information
Fun fact, most US dams were ready to immediately be turned into canned fish paste factories in case it was salmon season
Something tells me that if i brought back all 50k of the gristmills in the us from before  1860 that the fossil fuels no longer used in transporting our ground grains long distance would absolutely offset the losses on aquatic life from world wide fossil fuel consumption damage, it's bull**** that the flour in my pantry has traveled over 400 miles between the mill/packaging plant to my grocery store by semi truck then another 15 miles to my pantry (not including distance between farm and the giant modern plant) especially since i can literally cart one of my horses in 15 minutes to the location where my local mill once stood generations ago why is it ,that select groups within the Amish are the only people using little to no fossil fuels in their society even if (insert a house hold) is using kerosene lamps to light after dark (which many are going to wind/solar now for their lighting needs) i know from experience with kero lamps that the fuel consumption per day is a quarter of what my uncle who lives in the city uses just in his prius each day now add on his lights, his air conditioning, tv, modern appliances, literally the you will own nothing bull**** and 15 minute cities arnt going to do **** what we need is our mills back, and mass adoption of living on small family farms with modern equipment that are using the no fossil fuel mindset
So awesome, thanks for the video!
Turbine and turban are not homophones.
>you will never get to ride in the fish cathedral and the fish pipe nature is cruel
I'd love to see a practical engineering episode about the engineering of "practical engineering". like how do you produce and logisticate? Editting? File management.
Cool video ❤
They don't :(
thanks for sharing!
So your saying the fish like swimming though Turbines for fun :)
Super interesting to see the ways that fish and river animals are considered for dams, and how the infrastructure is changing to better suit them! The existence of a fish window also makes me very happy! Thank you for the video, great and informative as always!
Cool. They are about saving the fish. Now let's talk more about the dam. I'm curious about the turbines. I didn't know fish could pass through them without getting shredded. What do they look like? How big are the rotors and blades? How fast do they spin? Let's talk about the engineering there.
This content should not be free! Thank you for always going the extra mile :)
Thanks Grady for the video learned a lot.
I'd have pointed out that those fish screens are travelling screens.  Interesting in their own right.  I find it odd- and I must really be missing something- that the fish ladders are powered by pumps using water from below the dam, rather than simply using gravity and the water above the dam!
George W. Bush once said, “I believe the human being and fish can coexist peacefully”. Inspiring to see the hard work that goes into making that vision come true over twenty years later!
i know comments help, i really enjoyed this so thanks keep it up
@4:33 and just plain good sense by the powers that be. Now that’s a dwindling, scarce, old fashioned resource.
22 minutes to explain how fish can survive? I wont buy it
Grady, the word is pronounced "Tur-BINE."  The way you were pronouncing it, like "Tur-bin", is the pronunciation of "Turban;"  a type of headwear made of wrapped cloth.
You ever think those fishes are telling their friends "I got abducted and probed by an alien! They've put something in me!"
I'm really glad you made this video!  I always wondered how dams effected fish or how fish got by them.  Thanks!
Many fish ladders in Washington are a "dog and pony" with no real benefit. Also, there are dams that have outlived their usefulness. We really need to keep these runs healthy. My dinner table will be empty without those tasty treats.
Mansies! If I had seen this video in college I would probably be working at PNNL instead of NASA. Superb job of conveying the complexity of the issues and the work that’s being done. Looking forward to the folllow-on!
Hi Grady! At the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia river near Portland, OR they had fish counters who would count the fish going up the fish ladder there.   Do they have fish counters at the McNary Dam as well? Oh, you cover that in the video.  Nevermind...
I love this channel so much! Thank you for yet another fantastic video!
Turbans are hats, these are turbines.
This is Ecology I can appreciate.
I love that the first step is basically fish psychology
Its so weird hearing an anglophone saying turbin rather than turbain.
Hey I have a poster of this place!
you know what that means... FISH
I was wondering how many dam jokes you would get in... Nice restraint on using only the one.  Great info video.   Thanks for your research
That sounds good and all but really you should look at what enters the rivers at the sea and what makes it all the way up the river to their spawning grounds. A well designed dam might let more than 90% of fish thru but if there is 12 dams between the sea and the spawning grounds we have a problem.
It’s a crying shame this isn’t required viewing in school.
How much more efficient would a modern turbine be if it replaced the ones inside the dammit McNary
the powers that be and common sense dont exist. nice try though
My favorite thing about educational YouTube is watching hands on experts explain exactly what they do to an enthusiastic audience.
It will be interesting to show how fishes can escape human's stomach.
I am grateful that Grady (and team) has the talent and motivation to present this side of life I was completely unaware.  It was very interesting
15:11 why was he accepted into a good engineering school, and I was denied by every university I applied to?
good to see you interfacing with the national laboratory system Grady.
pretty bass heavy voice mix. might throw a high pass or bring it up a little higher. otherwise fantastic
Compare that to windmills that have no benefits and kill a lot of birds and the habitat around it
Glad you came to Oregon to check out the Dams! Hope you stopped and tried the food in Portland.
7:55 the fish can be steered into/towards the entrance of the fish- ladder by a BUBBLE SCREEN (liniar release of air bubbles to create a 'wall' underwater)
This was ridiculously nerdy and I loved it.    Best dam video on the Tube right now
The fish: dam!
A really interesting video and good to know that we're doing our best to cater to needs of natural wildlife while building dams.   Only thought was that if something occurred that killed 2% of the human population we'd probably call it genocide, but having 98% of fish survive a dam is a success. (Also, is it 98% survival for each dam it passes, or 98% survival to the ocean? 🤔)
I am so thrilled to have found this video. Several years ago I worked on a project relating to the Ardnacrusha power station on the River Shannon in Ireland. Turns out that the fish pass was only built 60 years after the hydroelectric station began its work - with the result that most of the salmon and eels that used to travel far upstream to reproduce had fallen victim to the impossibility of getting over the hurdle.  With the remedial work a hatchery was installed that eventually helped restock rivers in Ireland and abroad, e.g. the Rhine.  That hatchery attracted me like a magnet and I followed the complete cycle - and fell in love with the hatchlings. Knowing that the whole business can be managed so much better now and the negative impact on the fishes reduced considerably gives me great joy.
The Beauharnois Dam in Quebec had a sort of ladder built on both sides to let migrating eels wriggle up and down.
I LOVE how they make special "fish ladders" for the salmon to migrate upstream. That's so important for the species, and for me to bake my delicious salmon 😋
What about rivers that have ice? How do the dams work there?
shortest video ever - they don't
Dam! That's cool!
22:22 length, nicely edited.
A long time curiosity of mine answered very nicely, how fish get through hydro structures (in addition to fish ladders). Very glad to know the science, engineering and overall commitment to assure these fish survive. Amazing the changes in turbine design are so successful at keeping fish alive.
Sir, thank you for your work. So interesting!
2:22 I see what you did there.
My mom worked for BoR. So many dam jokes
The best solution makes me the most money, or gets me the most votes.
So many Dam jokes... lol
I want to know just how those newer turbines were designed to protect the fish. What features were used to reduce the pressure gradient on the fish, etc.
Three of the Klamath River hydro dams are being removed because they did not have fish ladders.
Thank you😊

"best DAM tour guide"
I like that they have found cool ways to balance electricity generation and taking care of the wildlife as well
those superfluous things drive up the cost of power
As a Hermiston local working in electric infrastructure, this is SUPER cool to watch! Thanks for coming out here!
I always thought they just got cut to ribbons 😂 but the engineering that goes into just managing these fish is just insane
Thanks for highlighting the relevance of environmental requirements for building sutainable power sources like that great dam!
Just for clarity, Run of the v extensive reservoirs, but they still create bodies of largely slack water behind them, as the flyover shot at 10:30 shows. McNary's is called Lake Wallula. As noted, the flow over the dams is regulated according to criteria including power generating needs, flood control needs and fish passage requirements, which do not always coincide with the natural discharge of the river at that particular time. I live near the upstream limit of Lake Wallula, which has islands, permanent ponds and wetlands that existed only when the river was in flood stage prior to the construction of McNary Dam. The nine other dams on the Columbia below Grand Coulee have similar stretches of slow or slack water behind them. The only free flowing section is the Hanford Reach, which ends just upstream of Lake Wallula.
It makes me happy to see scientists and engineers working together to better the environment.
absolutely fascinating. i'd never even considered how a human built dam impacts the fish.
theres nothing cooler than animal protection like this
I've been watching your videos for a few years now. Before, I never payed much attention to all the feats of engineering which surrounds us in evereyday life. You made me interested in them, and sparked a new joy in me when I pass by engineered structures everyday. Thank you from France, for your excellent work!
Why do you act like a girl?
You get to see lots of neat things, but then you're the one out looking for the opportunities.  Very well done on this one.
Hey Grady! This was a cool piece and it's rad of USACE to let you post video from inside the facility. Would you be interested in doing a similar / follow-up episode with environmental NGOs, commercial fishermen, and tribes? While I think this is as balanced a piece as possible with DoE and Army Corps interviews, there's a whole separate set of stakeholders and perspectives that could use some sunshine from your platform. Thanks for keeping it practical!
A ‘run of the river dam” your living an Australian hydrological wet dream.
Loved the video. If you could have, you should have put some switchgear footage in here.
interesting video to release just upon the news that hundreds of thousands of Chinook salmon released in California died because of the water pressure in a hydropower dam.
Yet the amount architecture work that went here cant figure out that by placing 2 identical dams downstream from gates you literally create another power source generated from gates pressure! Were lazy n used the natural river instead of digging a hole n doing that way in a looped cycle!
I gave you the like as I always do. I'll watch the video about the fishes later...
turban
And that’s why we don’t have cheap energy.
The dump for fish below Bonneville dam is a favorite spot for birds and seals to feed at. Have they fixed it yet ?
Lochs and cream cheese, onion, d’maters, and capers. Mazeltov!
According to Wikipedia the Grand Coulee Dam further upstream on the Columbia River in Washington  lacks a fish ladder, permanently blocking fish migration and removing over 1,100 mi of natural spawning habitat. They weren't as concerned about the negative impacts 90 years ago. That aside, the Grand Coulee Dam is a pretty amazing engineering feat.
I didn't think we'd have surgery for fish.
For your next video, you should check out the Ballard Locks in Seattle. They're incredible and have a ton of considerations made for the migration of salmon.
Well done Grady! Love all your stuff too
? I love fish
Everybody has to write the vote but some people shouldn't be allowed to.  I never thought I would actually say that and mean it.   These people literally do not want to look at facts. You literally tell them the facts and show them the evidence they turn around and put their head in the sand.  They want to be lied to
You were in my backyard! lol
Did they show you the detrimental effect of removing the adipose fin?  That fin is there to break up turbulence before flow of water reaches the tail fin.
"Fish generally don't read signs"  Sorry, I'm gonna need to see a peer reviewed paper to back up that claim 😂
Don't believe everything your dam tour guide tells you. One dam tour guide confessed that when he was asked why the water changed color after it went through the dam he said , "It is  because the electrons are taken out of the water by the generators".
I WORKED ON THE ICE HARBOR TURBINE BLADES CUTTING THE AERATING PASSAGES ITS SO COOL TO SEE MY WORK IN ACTION
where is the fish window livestream
You gotta see the Grand Coulee. The irrigation project is also extremely interesting.
why does he pronounce turbines like turbans?
I spent 2 years at the USGS performing the field work and managing the Total Dissolved Gas instruments on McNary and all 4 of the Lower Snake Dams. These sensors inform how much spill is allowed during snowmelt timing to ensure TDG is not excessive, which will kill the smolts.
Okay...with my middle-age vision I misread this, thinking it said "How to survive Hydro Turbines." Was about to scroll by but then I realized, I could use that knowledge next time I fall into a hydropower dam! Imagine my disappointment to discover it's about how FISH survive. So I take it to mean that if I did fall into that turbine, I'm basically ducked.
so the powerhouse is the powerhouse of the dam 👀
You should come to Wales and visit Dinorwig. A stunning piece of engineering sympathetically placed in the most amazing landscape in the UK.
Looks like Tom Scott is back
Forget Nebula. There are VERY few channels. So i had a look over Nebula, and even asked on Reddit sub how many channels there are... I was down voted to heck and nobody gave an accurate answer. Just a guess by one person of _"i dunno, maybe 200"_  but when you look there a FAR fewer than that. not saying the content is not very good, it is. But there's precious little in terms of variety across the very few channels. my 2 cents ... I wouldn't pay for it.
1:45 I'm surprised they let you get that close to the shaft. The one dam I worked in had a big circle room around it that we weren't allowed into
Using their natural instincts to help them swim upstream. Yay. I'm sure they appreciate that there are also no bears in that waterfall
I chuckled at the giant General Electric logo slapped onto those turbines
Best DAM tourguide...good one! 🫣
Im a hydro machinist out of PA and I did a ton of the priest rapids wicket gates seeing my work appear on your map was super cool

I hope Nebula has a spot to check when was the subscription purchased and and shows the exact time-date-year of when the streaming service subscription was purchased and the time-date-year the service will end for the customer as a lot of things happen in a year and it is hard to almost impossible to remember when you have purchased the subscription and how long you have left to renew your service back when it ends. It's a very important piece of info for the customer/streaming service subscribers but more important for the Nebula streaming service provider. It will also be nice if there are [15 days left before the Nebula streaming service ends Notifications] are provided to customers/subscribers as well.  Makes life easy when a customer calls and asks if my streaming service is not working and turns out their service period has ended and needs to be renewed is the only problem.
I once wrote a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers in grade school about how juvenile salmon got down. I was doing a science project about some people wanting to have the Snake River dams removed. I was so excited to get a letter back from an engineer answering my question.
just puts it more into perspective hydro electric dams are great and all but nuclear power is still much better with how much power they produce compared to solar, wind and hydro electric and how little their environmental impacts are
OK, so how do they protect the fish and turbines from each other while those screens are out during maintenance season?
Hook an AI up to a camera and let a computer count and classify the fish.  That would be cool.
wow!
faith in humanity partially restored
I'm glad we are looking out for mother nature to this extent instead of disregarding her completely like we used to do.
Great video
These topics would make for a cool collab with AVNJ. He did research with those fish windows for years. Even though he's not an engineer, i think there could be fun chemistry.
Good job and thank you.... ...  ..   .
What did the fish say when it swam into a wall?  Dam  What did the fish behind him say?  Dumb bass.
Political take, but this is an excellent use of our taxes, and I love to see all the progress they've made, and are still making!
I live near one of the Columbia River damns and whenever I watch the fish going up the fish ladder, I notice the flow is way faster near the top of the ladder. So fast, that the juvenile fish don't seem to overcome it. Is this intentional? Is it meant to filter out the smaller fish and only let the adults through to breed?
Too many people have this false dichotomy of "humans vs. the environment" or "human-made environments vs. the natural environment".  WRONG. There is only one environment and humans are a huge part of it.  But so are insects.
If you ever have a chance to do a video on the Helms project in Fresno Ca. I think you would enjoy it. It’s a pumped storage system and super interesting. It’s recently been overhauled.
She missed one crucial reason, its a moral perspective. We don't have the right to wipe out species just because its convenient to us! It is morally right for us to do whatever it takes to allow these animals to exist!
Grady, last time I toured the Bonneville hydroelectric dam (very close to this one in the video) there were ten enormous turbines in the main room, and not a single one of them was generating electricity at the time despite the roaring Columbia River outside. The tour guide said that's often/typically the case, explained as "economics," though I can't understand how free clean energy could be any more economical. I wasn't about to lock horns with the guy during a tour, but it would be great if you could do a deep-dive on why turbines are typically/often just left off. Thanks!
Curious: how do you prevent people from eating fish with those tracking devices?
Worked in the jetta-taylor hydro electric lock and dam rebuilding and and adding footings under the turbines. As I will never forget the expirence and the knowledge gained that time working under the running turbines with one of the four leaking beyond any comfortably and definatly had to get over that mentally very quick was extremely hot very loud always humid and you were never dry from start of the day past end of the day! Never will I forget the Army corp of engineers had us all after months of working in literal hell  when we finished put our lock out tag lock and tag put them  locked to the dam fence after the work was all done as a kinda ritual thing... so I guess a part of me will forever be locked into the dam forever.
To quote Spock.  “Fascinating” …
America is so damned Awesome. What an amazing country we share ❤
Spoiler: they don't.
Turbans are headwraps. >.>
I started my YouTube-watching career with this channel and somehow you keep putting out wildly interesting videos. Thanks for the hard work and the interesting content!
I am not a fan of a lot of dams across the states. But dams like the ones in the columbia and companies like pnnl make me hopeful for the future of dams across the states
Practical Engineering is making some of the greatest content on the whole of youtube. Thank you
Why not submerge the juvenile bypass pipe with multiple outlets near the center of the river to “spread out” their dispersement?
Answer is they don’t.  Dams decimate migratory fish populations
"Fish don't read signs." -- whaaaatttt?
I"ll be damned. Thats impressive structure.
2:22 HA!
I live near the 4 dams on the Snake that need to come down. There are hardly any salmon making into Idaho and it’s providing little energy for the region and merely expanding irrigation farming into areas that are scrubland. Yeet them out. Restore the lower Snake.  And see how they treat kayakers and ppl crossing the dam. Yikes. CoE has had too much leeway in the name of outdate “reclamation”  At least you got to see scenic Irrigon and Umatilla.   9:55 remember: the Columbia used to be a fast moving river. Now it is generous to call it just a series of lakes. So juveniles don’t have the impetus of the normal river flow that the species evolved with to get downstream.  11:15 I’ve seen one in person and, sadly, they aren’t on all dams.

Well, yeah 19:30 - If you wanna continue eating them, you gotta make sure they keep breeding.
Great video. How well do these structures work however? Salmon populations are still plummeting
Fish have the right to be a great food ingredient, that's it.
That dam thing is way more harder than you think.
3:03 ah yes, where the turbans live. Turbans are my favorite part of hydroelectric dams :P
the colonizers of WA did their absolute best to completely destroy the entire columbia chain from Kellogg to the west coast lol. its insane how much damage they managed to do. some parts of the chain are still so completely polluted with heavy metals like mercury that you will get sick with mercury poisoning from eating only a few fish. but hey, we got a lot of cheap lumber and power! some parts of the chain have been completely changed irreversibly too and will never see salmon again.   it was a massive understatement that the topic gets people fired up lol. some people have devoted their entire lives to trying to restore or even just save what we have. currently, surf boats are doing massive amounts of erosion damage to lakes and rivers all over the state because legislators have been so slow to increase the no wake zone to 300 feet like Idaho did.
Amazing, thanks. I'm a tech guy, so this is so interesting.
What did fish say when it ran into a concrete wall? DAM!!!
Grady should be the head of the department of education in the states period.
Finding Nemo 5
You know what would be cool? If they made an animation of a fish's perspective going through the dam (with no humanistic embellishments like Finding Nemo) both going upstream and downstream, like a salmon's life from birth and then returning to the spawn pools, seeing the travel through all the pipes and gates and valves and being diverted from the turbines, feeling the vibrations through the water of the sheer power in the turbine, and then on the way back being attracted to the ladder and jumping up, and up, and up, and out into the river again to go back to spawn. That'd be epic. Just nature, no emotional anthropomorphized journey, just the powerful oft-silent functioning of the mechanisms of creation and the work we've put in to disturb it as little as possible while extracting all the use we can from the system.
I wish they would teach kids this.   New age environmentalists teach like consciouse engineers haven't been working on awesome solutions for a couple of generations and although there is always more growth to be had our country has responded quite well compared to many societies.
Reality.
I love hearing about human beings using science and engineering to make life for fish easier. It’s a welcome change from everything else going on in the world these days.  Hats off to the staff at PNNL.
Once worked on a dam West Virginia that had Eel screen to see how many died going thru turbine.  After two years they only found couple(less than 10) dead Eel.  So the scientist got mad and sent 1400 Eels thru the dam.  Only 6 died and the power company had me remove the screen the next day.  After that they stopped working with university.  There real motive became clear
The issue with going through the turbine is the transition between pressurized and open channel flow.
Oh cool this is in Portland! I just moved here
One of your best videos yet
love to see human and nature hand in hand! Amazing video!
I’ve finally seen Grady happier than next to an enormous yellow truck: Grady next to an enormous turbine!
Oh dam! A new dam video! Dam!
Infishstructure.
But why spent so much money just for some fish. I'd take it if they have too much money left lol
lovely technology! thank you :)
163k views in 5 hours!!!!   Way to go Grady!  you produce some wonderful informative videos!
4:40-4:41, lower left screen, fast moving object
The work horse is grand coulee
Anyone else getting Final Fantasy VII vibes from the music?
Grady, which is better for you, watching on YouTube or watching on Nebula?  I mostly use Nebula for the stuff not on YouTube, but would watch more there if better for the creators.
Grady: I will send this video to my 5 year old grandson who loves engineering topics.  I was naïve and gullible.  As a young child I knew that electricity came from Niagara Falls.  I thought this was the only place it came from.  Also at that time I used to eat Nabisco shredded wheat for breakfast.  The box had a water color drawing on the side of Niagara Falls.  I thought shredded wheat was a byproduct of electricity that was strained out of the water with the electricity.
It is good to see the investment in trying to stop screwing up a keystone species that supports countless other animals.
I stand Infront of the blades and tell the fish to turn back
Eh indigenous groups aren’t helped at all by dams
very nice, good video.
Very interedsting ish. thanks
I'm always amazed at how few fish get impacted by old and new dams.
I love the video length being all one number. I'm a simple person.
My fiancé is a wildlife ecologist. What she does everyday to research Louisiana’s aquatic wildlife is incredible. Unfortunately, funding for such research and investment into protecting our natural environment is consistently under threat from a particular political ideology. Now more than ever, it’s great to see someone highlight how some communities are working towards a more sustainable future.
What did the fish say after running into a cement wall?  "Dam!"
how is he comparing an actually USEFUL handbook to the Bible of all books? 😂😂 "Yeah, this useful book right here, it's pretty much wrong all the time and filled to the brim with bronze age superstitious rituals and stuff..."
They don’t!
Were there any FISH -> stickers on the piping to go along with the water and gas?
protect the salmon its so good
13:53 Don't tell me that is a lot of birds lined up for the fish? :o
When did people start saying "turbin"? There's definitely an e at the end, how could this happen.
why the fish cross the danm
Fantastic video. I'm a hydrogeologist working in WA on fish and hydropower infrastructure, and its super difficult to condense knowledge into usable tid bits that educate the public. These videos are a fantastic resource for us
Living in Oregon it's greatly impacted how much our salmon runs flourish & how our waterways naturally function. This is making progress. Our biggest mistake was moving away from nuclear energy options
8:20 I really hope that in 2024, the expert is computer vision
In South Carolina they flooded a valley to create multiple lakes with hydro electric dams and a nuclear plant for power really cool stuff the plant still is in operation. It’s the Oconee nuclear plant.
Dam, thats a goodmvideo...
You know, it’s weird.   I’ve had this as a shower thought a few times, but I’ve never actually looked into it.
Screw the enviro nazis.  The alternative is coal / oil / gas. Coal is bad for both the humans and the critters.
Did they engineer that plastic fish to attract more adults to the adult collection channel?  I'll see myself out through the turbines
Different branches of science in one video 🤩
Piezo electrics in fish to power the sensors is *absolutely* wild. Incredible video.
And then a Chinese trawler wipes the whole fish population out in deep water.
I would expect you to pronounce tur bine correctly. extremely difficult to watch
Question: Why don't we just stack these like crazy? Do one plant after another after another after another? After all it's all about gravity pulling the water through the plant in order to spin the turbine. So why don't we put them right after each other? Why don't we make them multi level?
love seeing dams like that that also take the ecology into consideration, its just so so sad that almost all dams are only build for the human needs and not the ecology needs too when both should be done
Not gonna lie, when I saw the title, I though that you're going to make a small scale turbine at your house and put some goldfish through it 👀
Nice dam video!
very interesting and informative video, and really clearly explained! the pronunciation of turbine threw me off a bit though haha
There are no solutions only tradeoffs.
you could make mini documentary series on the topics you cover. if ever you wanted to, i'd watch all of them. great content.   side note. looking Slim Grady. the real slim Grady.
Grady - Excellent video.  I used to give tours at the Bonneville Lock & Dam  Several years ago they installed new minimum gap turbine runners in powerhouse #1 after which they tested the survivability of the juvenile salmon passing through.  They didn't have the small sensors back then so they put small balloons on the juveniles with a chemical inside that would inflate the balloon after the fish went through the turbine.  The juveniles came to the surface down river and they were picked up for analysis.  This also showed a 98% survivability rate.
Very interesting. Miracles of modern civil engineering.
It is amazing what can be done with other peoples money.
Really interesting and it's awesome what PNNL is doing.
All terrestrial tetrapods, including apes such as we, share a common ancestor with lungfish and fish with swim bladders. We aren't just related to fish; we *are* fish. It's common clades all the way down. How incredible is it that we aren't a separate creation apart from nature, but a part of nature?
Just sharpen the turbine blades and inject pickle relish and mayonnaise into the turbines.  Produce electricity and Salmon patties at the same time.
I can't believe you came all the way up to our corner of Oregon and didn't even stop by my place for a cup of coffee!  Lmao jk!  Cool video!
Well...they dont survive in general, a few strong fish might survive as strong migrating salmon but the spawn dies in the turbine and other less strong species simply cant. Not to speak of invertebrates
Why don't the fish just evolve legs and walk around the dam?
Lived in the PNW most of my life, love it up here. How did you like it?
6:50 pumps run by electricity? That's unfortunate. Why do they lift water up from tailrace using pumps? could've just used the dam water from upstream?
What defines an invasive species?  Think about it.  Say in the year 1800, we started keeping records of what was where.  If Lamprey were there in 1800, then in 2000 we say Lamprey are native.  But, what if Lamprey weren't there in 1750?  What if the people who started the records brought Lamprey into the area?
It's great to see this. I was under the impression that the USA only used minimal efforts or outdated methods to assist fish migration.
When I was very little and lived near Holyoke, MA I was always in awe of the "Fish Lift". Really interesting!
Actually, there is discussion about "damage" of HPP. Migratory fish species may indeed disappear from the HPP region. However, a comparatively richer lake ecosystem appears very quickly in their place. Moreover, river ecosystem mostly can survive this change. There is no damage done for nature. But there are a lot of small changes
Very interesting. Thanks.
Ter BINE not ter BIN  turban is a type of headwear based on cloth winding
i swear i saw somewhere on the youtube something like a cannon, where they load fish and shoot it across the dam, what happened with it?
To really balance nature,  get some bears as permanent employees at the dam,  to monitor the fish ladders....
Not far from just trying to control the school with those tags... very interesting. Trademarking FishControl 😛
You forgot "occasionally"
Great video!
17:16 Fish and Chips?
6:35 “fish generally don’t read signs” Idk Dory did pretty good with escapè
mm fish
daaaaaaaaaaam...
please don't compress your voice so much <3
"we need superchargers on every corner" is like saying we should add engines to  speed up horses, it's thinking using the old mindset. Every parking spot should have slow charging, fast charging should be rare.
There were no middle eastern headdresses making power - its a turbINE.
2:22 - Nice "Vegas Vacation" reference there...
Excellent video and tour!  Great to see they are continuing to improve the dams to be safe(r) for salmon. Getting adult salmon swimming upstream to use the ladders has been successful for decades, making the journey safe for downstream  juveniles has been a big challenge, so its great to see all the efforts going into helping to improve conditions.
You have a fish window?? Is there a livestream of the fish window? Can we uuuh, donate to setup a livestream of the fish window?
I am amazed at your ability to consistently top your last best effort. This is awesome and one of the best pieces of informative tv ive seen.
Often engineering and man made structures are seen as diametrically opposite to nature and environment. It's really uplifting to see so much engineering and science going into low impact infrastructure
Dam yo fish be crazy.
Good timing? California just built a new fish hatchery (Fall Creek), that had all of it's newly hatched fish killed by the nearby dam. They probably should have watched this video first.
Any link to that fish window web cam...?
Videogame recommendation: Infra. Explore underground water canals and powerplants. Experience first hand what happens when critical infrastructure falls into disrepair. It's like playing Half-Life, but without enemies.
If you could get this thing traveling at 88 mph it might be able to go back in time. 😂 1.1 jigawatt 😮
Nice
dam
Wow
You get Tuna.😂
I’ve always wondered exactly how the fish got through the dam and how many casualties there were. Thanks for the great video! ❤
Amazing video thanks for making it.
What happens at the next dam up stream?
There is a low flow hydro power system that is available, it only produces enough for a single house but is stack-able. This system does not harm fish that go through from upstream. It has an optional ladder module to allow upstream migration for the fish. This system is not suitable for the large systems in the vid but for off grid or minimal grid reliance homes.
Come visit Natel Energy, in Alameda, CA! We specialize in designing FishSafe® turbines and we actually run tests as well. Drop by!
as someone who grew up in eastern WA going on the tours to all these places i thought everyone knew these things i didn't realize hydro power wasn't as common in the US.
The ramp needs one of those sorting machines they use for produce, to remove the invasive species. Some kind of camera operated net or just a spear
It's because of their Positive Mental Attitude
17:17 I'm an anaesthesiologist and I love the fact that these people anaesthetize and intubate fish just like I do with people.
"Best dam tour guide I've ever met". Lol, I caught that.
when i go to nebula to watch the windover extremities series, it's only podcasts.. no video episodes??   is it a region locked content maybe?
This is a really cool and interesting episode, thanks Grady!
Nice to know people are looking out for the fish - it's quite a science! Thanks to the dam crew for doing such important work and for sharing their mission.
So cool! Looking forward to that other video you mentioned too!
Dang, Grady was in the PNW and I missed out! Ah well. Hope you enjoyed your time here! Salmon is the lifeblood of the pacific northwest, and has been since time immemorial. Whether you're native or not, we have a duty to protect them here in the PNW. Thanks for shining a light on this--and of course the issue is highly complex
I’m a supervisor at a dams and I’ve modified one of the ladders so I can easily remove the fish for consumption.
The way they say turbine makes no  sense. It’s an I not a U
I love it
JOHN STOSSEL, P.E.
Interesting content
I was at the McNair dam many years ago. I enjoyed the fish swimming past the window
Great Scott! 1 GW is like 80% of what the time machine needs!
Great show.  I wish more people understood how complicated our civilization is.  I once had the pleasure of attending a new product release for a PLC.  Among the few hundred participants were people who ran water and sewage systems, electric grid engineers and technicians from the entire Eastern US.  It was fantastic.
So you made an awesome water slide for juvenile fish... Nice
Disliked for encouraging fish murder.
Critical operations of the dam... As it pans to holes in the screen @11:44
These are all good efforts, but . . . I've seen films of the salmon runs in the 30' and 40's. The sheer volume of fish was amazing, almost incredible. We'll never see again.
That expert is basically being paid to watch and count fish over a window, all day long.
It's always funny to see how USA pushes propaganda to justify their nature devastating developments, while at the same time funding NGOs and other social bodies in developing countries to halt their development.
What a great experience for you. Thanks for sharing with us.  So many aspects of our created environment and the impacts on the natural environment to consider.  I appreciate your efforts to educate us.
DAM!
🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟
this was super informative and just fun to watch
Alison is right, protect what is.
What did the fish say when he ran into a wall? Dam!
Don't ever forget ear protection! Especially at 1:49 in video!!! https://youtu.be/HCE_lFUMXNg?t=109
An amazing video and tour
Dialect pronounciations don't really work when it's pronounced exactly like an existing word that describes something else.  Turbans exist and is a very different thing.
Really glad you started covering this, I’ve always wondered why we couldn’t design a fish ladder that was 90% plus effective.
it can always be better, but I'm super glad there's serious work being done! what a hopeful video
Interesting how this came out the day an article was published talking about how a bunch of salmon fry were killed due to drastic water pressure changes in a west coast dam. 😂
Dam, that was a good video!
Why didnt you go to the "limits fish can with stand" department?  lol
8:16 I would love the job of sitting there counting fish
Grady, I truly enjoy your content and narration. Videos like this one always take me back to the 50's when I was in grade school and would take a class field trip.  I kind of get that warm fuzzy feeling of learning how something is made or works. Then I snap into the reality of the day and wonder what is the cost benefit or is it something we do at any costs.  With a current national debt of over 34 trillion dollars and my responsibility at almost a million dollars I have to question if all ahead full at any cost to the tax payer is the correct mentality,  strategy and long term goal.  I'm sure there are thousands of project just like the PNNL and do not see how we can sustain continuing to do everything the same way. At 80, I will probably survive it, but it really concerns me to pass my million dollar debt down to my grandkids with no relief in sight.                         JimE
Soooo they fully made a fish waterpark
It's crazy how in the US the environnemental impact and satinable developement is so few explained compare to Europe. I feel like most americain citizen miss understand or just don't care about it. It's nice to see videos like yours with a real educative purpose based on facts and scientific studies.
So cute to watch those little beings in their natural habitats along with their similars. I'm talking about Grady and the other engineers.
3:54 how do the walls/floor maintain itself against wear and tear from that massive amount of rushing water constantly smacking into it?
If you'd like to take a dive into fish hatcheries in Washington, let me know. I'm an engineer at WDFW and could show you around!
Great video. I was waiting for simulation (or drawing) of fish inside turbide. Increse loudness in [7:30].
Meanwhile, in China:  "We just mash up the fish when they pass through the main rotor."
When I was 6 years old my uncle and I were fishing at a power plant in Valatie New York and he told me that they made power and fish sticks at this plant. I asked him what happened to the fish that went through the turbine and he said that they turned them into fish sticks. For years after that, I repeated this information to my friends until I was about 16 years old. I always thought it was strange that fish that I caught in that creek tasted so much different than fish sticks from the store, but I figured it was the breading.
Fish generally dont read signs. Best sentence of the video
If anyone understands fish, can you comment below, I have a fish question
In germany you see: they dont!
PHEESH!
Grady, this is just fabulous.  I think it's awesome to show engineering in the light of working to lift up all populations, pun intended.  And thanks for "forcing" me onto Nebula a year or so ago, there's some really amazing stuff over there.  Keep it up, it's a LOT of work that you and your crew are doing.  So grateful.
Turbans! Uh huh, huh huh
Damm i didint know that
Maybe it's a regional accent, but you seem to keep saying turbin, rather than turbine.
Coming from the great lakes region,  when I first saw the lampreys I wondered what they were going to do to stop them.
Aaah yuk yuk.
The problem is species that migrate down stream as adults. The Carp family, trout, cat fish, burbot, Perch, Pike, Eals, Sturgeons etc. They get killed at the screens. So you save some Salmon that's about it! Turbines will never become any good for wild life.
Dam
learning time 😮🍿
Scientist update their work due to learning new science and science improving? You don't say.
You always do such a great job with these videos. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
imagine if you had a 98% chance to make it home after work, don't think people would accept that :P
Thank you Grady, I was always curious. Now I know.
A dead river is no good to anyone, better to have fish, birds and wild life. Fantastic.
"...best dam tour guide..." I see what you did there lol
Fascinating insight! I would never have thought about the rapid pressure change and it's impact on the swim bladder but it makes a lot of sense 💡
Who wants to argue with me about the pronunciation of “Turbine”?
Thanks Grady for another awesome video! I enjoy your videos so much.
best channel on yt thanks!!!
"Today on Practical Fishineering..."
Hydroelectric dams restrict rivers and aquatic life, wind power affects birds and bats, solar takes up space, nuclear has spent radioactive fuel.  The only reliable and clean energy can be drawn from burning coal, oil and gas.      🤡
I watch another channel where the pronunciation of "turbine" has been controversial and the host often has to justify his pronunciation.  95% of this video pronounced it with a short i, like "turbin" and not with a long i, like "turbyne".  I've noticed that engineers tend to pronounce it like "turbin".
So, hydro power and wildlife can co exist. Hydro is a proven technology, lets continue with it. The biggest opponents of dams are the people that claim to be environmentalists. I have been to dams over 100 years old, still making good power, 24 seven. How many windmills make it over 20 years without major reconstruction? Reservoirs are natures best battery.
Dam.
Are there any issues with a predator eating a fish with a tracker inside them with a battery and stuff?
I like that somebody looked at that rotating deathtrap at 1:47 and said: "Eh, a simple railing should be fine!" X-D
I always look forward to hydro videos from Practical Engineering. The diversity of subjects is great, but hydrotechnical stuff just feels like Grady’s home turf.
Could the large man made bodies of water alter the weather and climate ect
Now I'm wondering how to manage the sediemt a river carries to the dam.
So sad that your country has trump.
Looks like you had an absolute blast visiting these places, Grady. It's cool to see people being passionate about their job!
excellent video, and downright fascinating!  404 not found for the music link, could you fix that? thats way too catchy!
Thanks for visiting my backyard. 😊 Excellent video 😎
Awesome documentary! This is something the "regulation is bad" free market types need to see. It takes money to come up with and implement solutions like those shown here. The ecological impact of our devices would be so much worse without pressure from the public and subsequent regulation from government. We -need- regulation. Regulation often drives innovation too.  Much respect to the engineers who came up with the ecological solutions at McNary Dam.
How any of us get an answer about Dams: Google it How Grady gets an answer about Dams: Visit a Dam
Hells ya Columbia represent!
Finally, a YouTube video covering something that I actually care about.
As a kid I wanted to become a dam builder, unfortunately the wish wasn't strong enough to study engineering. Great video!
seriously one of my favorite channels, Grady for minister of (public) technical/engineering education/edutainment!
I am desperately jealous of the person that gets to count and identify fish through a window all day
Those young sturgeon are so handsome.
I can't believe you got this level of access. Awesome video!
"This Turbine shuts Down" I seem to recall oh yea Truman Lake chopped up paddlefish non stop for weeks. Bagnell Dam. That fish kill resulted in the loss of over 43,000 fish valued at $3.2 million.
The fish survive hydro turbines as light chunk tuna.
I just started the video and i hope you went to the Ballard Locks in seattle to see the salmon ladders.
This is why we need more nuclear energy, hydro electric dams have caused the extinction of several species even with "eco friendly features". Such as the chinese paddlefish. Nuclear power has caused the extinction of zero species.
I never knew turbans were so useful :0 !  Heheee, I kid >v<
it's really bizarre watching this video, knowikng that russia blew up Kakhovka Dam causing global ecological disaster
Fish can suffer, they are individuals. The cost is suffering to individuals, not just harm to abstractions like ecosystems.
I love the focus on the big picture. Helps keep everything in perspective. Fantastic content!
You make some of the best videos, Grady! I absolutely love to learn and explore things I might not understand. You are amazing with how careful and detailed you are when you navigate these topics! You're a huge inspiration and someone I look up to 👍
I was about to suggest you make a video about fish ladders, but you seem to be way ahead of me, so how about expanding that into a whole series of infrastructure for animals, like highway crossings, amphibian fences and all that? I'd love it!
Very cool video!  As someone who has had a very, very small involvement in the design work of the re-runnering job at McNary, it was really cool to see inside the powerhouse and understand a bit more about the job as a whole.
Never realised that Wendover paywalled Extemities, just assumed he cancelled the show after a couple episodes once he moved it over from a podcast format to videos, what a shame
Once again, you knocked this out of the park! Such an interesting look at how infrastructure interacts with everything day to day. Thanks for great, informative, and entertaining content.
Dam birds spawn camping
This will be highly beneficial to the trout population
When I was a kid, I got to stand in a fish ladder being built at Rocky Reach Dam.  My grandpa worked there, and we used to visit all the time.  Things were much more relaxed in the 80’s.
I'm so happy that the fish are safe
What a waste of time and money. The fish will come back after we're gone. Or not. I don't care.
That's some beautiful fish at 8:40.
Great visualization, of what is required to keep an ecosystem intact! A good lesson of what happens when you dont do all this is on the Danube river,  theres a great dam (the iron gates) located in a kanyon, thats unpassable by the large migratory fish (sturgeons, like the huso huso) and because of this, those species went extinct upstream, so the previous 500kg fish catches in germany, hungary, or szlovakia are a thing of the past 😢
INTERESTING AF. loved this video!
That's the funniest delivery on a pun I've ever heard in my life!
and this video is why as an EE, CivEs are my heroes.
"Fish generally don't read signs" 😂
I've taken that tour. Also fished the potholes just below the dam and swam in the river above. My aunt and uncle lived within walking distance.
How fish survive? It's a lottery. Have seen a lot of Breams cut in half after going throught turbine
I get so sick of people saying Washington State. Washington is the name of a state just like any other state! You didn't say Oregon State! No one ever says the word "State" after any other state name!  The capital of our nation is not Washington!!! It is "Washington District of Columbia" Or just plain "DC"!  It is completely idi.tic to have two important places in the same country with the same name! Especially when people incorrectly identify the name of our nation's capital!!!!
Found this very interesting. My grandfather was one of the engineers that built most of these dams and I got a first hand experience going with him to the different dams to see how they worked. I was always fascinated by the fish ladders and how they worked. I saw this all back in the early 70s and watching this its crystal clear this technology has come a very long way from back then and it was awesome to see. Thanks a ton for sharing this!
10:52 It does sound like you're saying they're drawn to the "turbans", not the turbines
Great video. I've always loved dams but protecting the river ecosystem is super important for not only the life in the river but everything and everyone that depends on those fish, birds and other animals
Too bad it doesn't generate 1.21 gigawatts! You could power a time machine. LOL
Always so interesting
lol - "good sense by the powers that be"  I see what you did there
thank you! this is something i often asked myself but always forgot to search.
Wait, why do you have to shut down the whole turbine when the screens break?  Will the turbines be damaged or is all that waste of resources being done just to slightly increase a non-threatened fish numbers by a few percent during the period.   It's sounds nice to save ever fish you can, but reducing the lifetime output of any power structure greatly increases the total wasted crude oil in the world as well as draining resources from projects to save far for lives elsewhere.
Like the best videos, this one sent me off on a little exploration of my own, thank you. I began to wonder about the newest dam on the planet; the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. For the life of me, even in dusty eco-research PDFs as well as satellite imagery, I can't find evidence of anything to do with a fish pass. I hope that they've had to fit one but I have my doubts.
Lampreys are invasive ti my home state of New York and we salmon fish Lake Ontario one day I caught a beautiful female king salmon with a lamprey mark so bad you could see her insides poor thing we ended up keeping her because she was so malnutrished and weak she wouldn’t swim off
Must not be working that well if native citizens cannot subsistence fish harvest because of numbers dropping every year. Good PR skit tho.
That was a dam good video.
When you talked to the dam worker, you sounded like a real person...not a news caster. You should use your regular manner of speaking when making your videos.
Dam needs improvements to generate 1.21 gigawatts of power.
What did the fish say when it swam into a concrete wall?  Dam!
This is just the best channel on youtube, I swear.
Awesome
Oh thanks, i was just asking myself that question a few days ago! Glad to learn it isn't overlooked.
An investment in PR and no mistake
There may not be one right answer, but there's definitely more than zero and unfortunately it's taken the field way too long to figure this out.
Back in the 1970’s, the Corps began doing more about conserving aquatic life.  It’s great to see that they have  expanded their efforts.
Grady🧐 wanna know what I think?  I think this video made my life better by a noticeable amount and this is constant effect. it's very very pleasing to know that there are energy groups on the planet that put such care into wildlife and succeed, and this phenomenon is evolving. This definitely made me feel more optimistic overall, again- by a noticable amount. 😮
Once I was "reccomemended" torward your Channel Grady, I will never leave. Best Engineering Channel on Utube! There is yet more engineering here in my state that would make some awesome videos and knowledge for you...
You win this round fish, soon we'll develop a turbine so powerful, no fish will escape it's grasp MWAHAHAHAH!!!!
Anyone else think it's wholesome that humans put so much effort into making sure fish are OK?
The real salmon ladder.
Very interesting, but I couldn't stop thinking about how much I'm grossed out by the taste of salmon!
Did anyone analyze the video to see  how fast that shaft was turning, or are we just going to take their word that it was running at 60hz?
That fish bypass is great! I wish we had it on Vistula river in Poland on Włocławek dam. There is some fish bypass there but it doesn’t work well. All salmon went extinct in Vistula river.

That's the neat thing they don't.
EXCELLENT REPORT-so much not discussed in any detail-I hope something is coming out of your besides a 20 minute YouTube
I missed something somewhere.  How is the sound made by water falling elsewhere from the dam differ from the sound of the water in the fish ladders?  It is all falling water.
Ohhh, this kind of care would be so nice in the Denube! I wish to see Visa, a fish that can grow massively large, would repopulate Europe's largest river! Sadly I don't especkt any of the countries in midle Europe will have the position and care to do similar fish ladders around their damms.
“Best dam tour guide I’ve ever met”. Well done
So, now that you visited Washington State, what did you think of our weather and geography? I have been here for the past 48 out of 49 years, and I wouldn't reside anywhere else!
Trick question. They do not.. 🪦
They are not fish...they are sheep
It is dam refreshing to have someone talk about the impacts of hydropower on the environment, and what's being done to mitigate it.
It's weird to think of lampreys as being native, since they're so well known as invasive species.  But every invasive species has to have been native somewhere.
You was amazed when i learned, how Solomon was essential as part of the fertilizer for huge landmasses up river🤯
Awesome video. I've seen bits and pieces of fish infrastructure and always wondered how it all came together. I hope some of the technology from larger scale dams can be applied to smaller irrigation structures. In the rivers of Montana I've observed massive mortality around certain irrigation systems, but fishing is a huge draw to the state and there's a clear incentive to improve the impacts critical human infrastructure has on the biology of the river.
They need a livestream of the fish climbing up the wiers/going through the fish viewing room
Turbines are like an amusement park ride for fish!  Wheeeeeee!   Spinny ride!!!   :D
… that scan their size before continuing the process of processing and packaging eventually being the fish and chips that end up on your plate, and due to this innovative hydroelectric farming initiative it's all in an automated way as well.
how do i become the guy counting the fish
Fantastic video and lots of great explanations!
We need more videos like this on youtube, this is actually interesting.
This stuff is fascinating. I never knew there were so many people actually working on these issues and it gives me a bit of hope for the future
Finally answering the tough questions
17:52  labview :D
Hey Grady thank you for covering this topic! I will be working with the Army Corps. of Engineers in Walla Walla this summer as an intern!
2:22 "The best *dam* tour guide I've ever met" - Dad joke
Activist is a swear word in my book.
This is the example of sustainable engineering
https://youtu.be/laTIbNVDQN8?si=0Pf65wxgsWHsAoC_
3:13 TY *Tim*
Love how most of the workers are excited about their work!
Super cool video. I love your channel so much, it’s made me want to pursue a career in engineering.
Modern engineers and engineering projects like this give me hope. There's so much negativity in the world and people are more divided than ever, so huge collaborative projects like this are a breath of fresh air.
A good read is John McPhee 's Encounters With An Archdriud where   David Brower meets Flyod Dominy
lovely paint work in that powerhouse
In Wales, UK, we have a pumped storage hydro power station called Dinorwig. For those who don't know, pumped storage stations work by having an upper and lower reservoir, separated vertically, by sometimes thousands of feet. In times of peak demand for electricity, water falls from the upper reservoir, through turbines, therefore creating power. When demand is light and electricity is cheap, the turbines are run in reverse thereby re-filling the upper reservoir. The company operating the station provides guided tours to anybody interested in seeing the place. I remember attending such a tour. The guide was explaining how much effort was made, in order to catch all the fish from the reservoirs, so they could be re-located to suitable new homes. One rather annoying tourist, kept insisting that all of the fish could not have been caught, therefore what would have been the fate of those remaining? After several times of asking, the tour guide, clearly annoyed, replied - SOUP!
"the best dam tour guide I've ever met."  I didn't think Grady used swear words... oh right... got me 🤣
I’ll take the benefits of a dam every single day over the benefits of a fish.
I can't help but think that whoever chose brown hardhats for visitors, had a sense of humour: you just know they get referred to as "💩heads". 😂
Hydroelectric is brilliant, dispatchable green power. We need MORE DAMS.
These water civil engineering videos are my favorite.
Bro, this is amazing! You're doing more and more amazing videos!
Truman Dam/Lake. Missouri.  Pump back system to keep the lake levels up. Wasn't migratory fish, just huge schools feeding in the tail waters that didn't survive the pump back in the 80s. I don't know if they ever figured it out,  but the residents at Lake of the Ozarks were not impressed with tons of dead fish flowing into the lake.
Poor birds, we won't let them get a good fish meal, probably cause them to become extinct.
You should check out the first dam built on the Mississippi River between Keokuk IA and Hamilton IL.
It's a mechanical fish battery...
Your videos get better and better - thank you.   I'm seriously thinking of a Nebula subscription, but the only thing that deters me is that I already spend far too much time on the internet!!
Great video! Thank you so much for visiting McNary and for highlighting the good work we're doing for the fish. More info about our dams can be found on our YouTube channel.
That was really cool, and the crew at that dam seem like they have a really positive workplace!
I Participated in a design think tank at the Wanapum Dam just up the Columbia. They needed to retrofit their fish attraction water system.
Kudos to you and the dam engineers. Lets talk about the elephant in the room...indian tribes and sea lions can kill salmon without repercussions.
I saw a video on the ecological impact of salmon a few years back. The salmon introduce a lot of nutrients to the ecosystem - not only to fishing predators and birds - salmon carcasus feed scavengers and insects too. All those nutrients find their way as animal waste and rotting fish, into the nutrient cycle of plants as nitrogen fertilizer. They have become a vital path of nutrients into the ecosystem of the surrounding area.  That said, I love the fish ladder and attractive water as concepts xD Its just so simple but so brilliant!!
This is the kind of engineering I love to see. We need to do all we can to live with nature without abusing it.
Having grown up in the PNW, I was surprised when i recently toured Hoover Dam and the guide insisted that the dam's primary purpose was flood control, and power generation was not a priority.
I’m very impressed at the progress over the last few decades in dam management. The ecological impact used to be a much smaller part of the administration of these structures. It’s great to see these changes
What did the fish say when it ran headfirst into a concrete wall?  "Dam!"
you get a like for metric
Looks like they’ve done everything for the fish to survive, both up stream and down stream. But it’s never enough for most eco extremist. Now they need to fence in the river downstream to keep the birds from getting the juvenile fish. And after that’s done, they’ll think of something else!
Thanks for coming to the PNW.  How about a series on Boeing commercial airplanes?  Then and now.
How did I not know that we have lampreys here? They are my nightmare and now I'm scared of the water. Joking not joking.
Can someone make an edited version of this video where they take the word "dam" and splice it before EVERYTHING? I think it would really be a big hit.
i think and oblivious opinion is WAY better than an informed one and i base that on zero evidence.
Engineering cost planning should include decommissioning. Anything else is a tax on the rest of us.
I got to work for the Bonneville Power Administration.  I was very proud of how the BPA spends nearly a billion dollars a year to improve salmon habitat and many other programs. Edit: Changed "BP" to "BPA"
Awesome!!!!!
Missed an opportunity to say what even though fish travel in schools, they can’t read the signs that say “Fish ladder this way”. :). Love the content!
Thanks Grady.  I work for BPA that sells the power out of that dam.  I love your videos and have your book.  You came close to my world with this video!!!!!!  Very cool.
Another great topic and video!  Much thanks.
Just started video but based on title this is gonna be a banger. Love the content Grady.
Glad to see you in my home state. Hope you enjoyed your stay. You brought to light so much more than what most folks think about a simple fish ladder.
I have seen or read that the miles of slack-water behind the dams are as much a hindrance to down-stream fish migration as the dam itself. I am not sure if that's true, or the extent that's true.
Very glad that engineers absorb ecological priciples but sad that there are no jobs for biologists
Très intéressant !
“Best dam tour guide…” 😂
We need a full documentation, dosent matter how long it would be
The truth is they don't survive most of the times
This is seriously one of my favorite channels. Incredibly entertaining and informative
Best dam video ever!
I was expecting a 5 seconds video of this guy saying: they dont.
8:43 looks like this fish has the disease "ich"
Thank you for sharing this! It's really cool to see the different infrastructure and how it helps connect everything.
I'd like to know what % of dams have these security measures. Is it by county law? How about countries other than America?
Excellent work! I always love when I see a video and then think "this is too good for youtube"
I love your channel. Though I’m wondering why you didn’t mention the Tribes in this video? I heard you refer to many other stakeholders but it seems like you left out one of the biggest players.
always good videos...
That's incredible Grady. Thank you.
What a one-sided misrepresentation of the situation with anadromous fishes in the Columbia river.
5:43 - this is such a cool idea for an ongoing series! The practical engineering of how humans built things to make life better for ourselves AND the animals that we live beside. My first thought is those over-passes built over roads to let deer and moose pass over highways on naturalistic terrain, and the story of how they researched where to place them, and did that so well that animals were trying to use the overpass before it was finished!  We need more hope and answers and good news in the world, and this is a great forum for sharing stories like that, of how human engineers are working towards, and succeeding at, prioritizing both their own needs, and the planet's.
I live in the same area as PNNL, its nice to see some local infrastructure being shown off!
CEO of the energy company: "We care for the fish and nature!" Engineers and scientists: "Yeah, let's help fish!" Same CEO: eats stake made of a baby, then goes to a manhunt and Epstein island.
they should live stream the fish ladder window 😂
You don’t happen to have a second channel or anything, do you? Because I don’t think I would mind watching an hour and half of more behind the scenes and/or longer clips of some of those conversations. I’d love to hear what they had to say..
Love this channel
I love those neat clean power houses! ❤
"turban " lol good video anyway 😂
Interesting that you chose to name all of the salmon species and then sea lampreys. There are much more interesting fish you could have chose but the fish you did chose both move from salt to fresh water to breed!
I love how all my questions get answered on this channel thoroughly at sometime...  Waiting for a new video is a thrill to be honest...
Did you ever find any dam bait? Lol
You mentioned fish are susceptible to sudden pressure drops as with water exiting a turbine- the dam here has a Kaplan turbine which are low pressure turbines. Don't you think its francis turbines that are pressure killers rather than Kaplan ones
I grew up fishing on the Columbia, especially by Bonneville Dam. Such great memories, such a beautiful place
"An informed opinion is better than an oblivious one." I agree but sending California water to the ocean for the delta smelt is proof that the, "informed" people in our government are, "oblivious" to the needs of the people they serve.
"Best Dam Tour Guide" hahaha
8:15 that's some Stanley Parable level job there. you clock in, count fish, clock out. in all seriousness, the job is probably the best job you could have. like forget keeping brain cells, just count fish and go home with all the money.
my country would laugh on the amount of investment, effort, and time just to protect mere fish. what environment? what ecosystem? all they see is a resource to exploit and abandon when everything dries up
Just say "They don't." and show a video of you eating fish salad.
Completely unrelated, I noticed the 3D printed enclosure in the pelican case the robot fish was housed in. It's probably not very significant, but as a 3D printing hobbyist I love how 3D printing is just showing up everywhere.
❤
Grady swoopin' through with another absolute bangeur of an episode
I wonder if the engineering elements at McNary dam that mitigate fish issues are: 1) more typical, 2) typical, or 3) less typical at other Columbia River dams?
OK it wasn't sponsored, but did they at least give you some electricity to take home with you?  2:30 I was like, I've been here! Why does this feel so familiar? Then it hit me. GTA:SA!
It's insane how much effort they have put into making sure to take care of the fish, kind of amazing to see in a world where all we see and hear is people complaining we don't do enough for our planet and wildlife.
Bypass🤙💦💫
You rock, Grady!
You mean they aren’t just a fish grinder?
Thank you Grady for coming to my home state!  🙂
Well Ill be damned.
Birds prey upon fish.  Something preys upon the birds.  Humans prey upon everything.  That is called nature.  I regard it as just another opportunity for mismanagement that humans now control the fish population, which cascades down to humans trying to control the bird population that preys on the fish.  Then we will have to try to control the predators preying on the birds.  It's just like humans deciding wolves in Yellowstone were a menace and so we removed them, which allowed coyotes to flourish, which created another problem.  Now, we deliberately import wolves who now prey upon the coyotes which will create yet another upset.  It never ends and human beings are simply not competent to control nature.  Every time we believe we have "solved" a problem, two more problems crop up.  It's all an exercise in futility.  Someday someone will decide the birds should not be allowed to prey on the fish at all and enormous efforts will be expended to keep away all the birds, and then someone will point out the problem created by eliminating all the birds.  Then someone will say the birds deserve to survive, too.  Then we'll try to apportion fish to birds and will exert enormous efforts to make sure each pelican gets only two fish per day.  Geez.  A perfect example of the inevitable human misunderstanding of just how nature really works was that fellow's comment about the lampreys.  He said some people regard them as pests and want them removed while some people think they need to be protected and encouraged.  Those points of view will likely reverse when we discover the problems we created by encouraging lampreys.  I am reminded of my wife's declaration that she unconditionally loves whales, especially Orcas.  She thinks they are beautiful, powerful creatures of the magnificent ocean.  Oh yeah, she also unconditionally loves seals.  They are just so cute!  Her insoluble consternation was apparent when viewing Orcas eating seals.  The most sensible thing Grady said was that these problems are never really solved.  I would argue that human intervention usually makes things worse.
I enjoy your videos.  Thank you.  I have a suggestion.  You could do a/some video(s) about landfill, or trash dumps.  They've changed greatly from when we simply dumped trash and garbage in a hole in the ground to what we construct now.
Surprised no salmon cannon.
Quality video as always ❤
Renewable energy source = one more hydroelectric dam system downstream from this one. Everything that goes through this system can be reused again I think that’s called renewable energy and gravity helps.
As Walter Lewin always says: "Faraday's law runs our entire ecomomy"!
It's pretty crazy to think this whole hydroelectric plant doesn't generate enough electricity to run Doc Brown's DeLorean.
Fascinating! I'd never would've thought that dams are that complicated
We had fish ladders in our run of the river hydro generators in Scotland.  They were built at the out set at the insistence of the land owners for whom fishing was an important sport income.  The fish ladder at Pitlochry is well known as a tourist attraction - it has windows in the side inside the visitor centre as well as a fish counter 😊
I can see Jeremy Wade very happy to see the amount of effort and engineering that goes into preserving the quality of life for the native fish by this dam. Pretty cool!
this may be a crude thought but if humanity would vanish in the future, I am curious what the next intelligent species will think of dams like this
I had to stop and go verify. In you opening shot with the dam and the bridge. i used to live near that dam. before 9-11 i went to the fish ladder and locks there. Great video and as always very educational.
How many new people are here because of Danny Harman's shout-out on Distant Signal?
Our family had the opportunity to visit the dam at The Dalles & had a similar experience. Quite an experience!
Really enjoy this channel. Learning done accessibly yet in depth, & not in a sensationalist way. Thanks :)
Practical Engineering. Maximize the performance and minimize the waste. Society needs a sustainable  balanced alternative to cut, kill, dig and drill. I appreciate your efforts to educate and inform the interested.
Pronouncing turbines (tur-bynes) as "turbans" never ceases to conjour fun mental images...
it's funny how anyone could even think PNNL could sponsor anyone, usually labs of all kinds are critically starved of money 12 months of a year
With us so set on destroying and killing, it really makes me feel good seeing these massive and costly efforts to reduce the damage we do. This planet belongs to the creatures and they share it with us. We need to be grateful.
Interesting. The turbines at 3:00 look identical to the General Electric turbines installed at the DniproGES dam in Zaporozhzhia, Ukraine 👍
Grady makes me give a Dam about engineering:) As a railfan I also liked your train videos! Keep it up!
Now what happens if say... a man In a fish costume tries going through it🤨
I remember as a kid growing up near KY Dam the Cub Scouts took a trip to the dam and got to tour the trubine house...Yeah...we saw them and they are impressive in their size..and we saw the cutaway model and got some discussion...  This was probably 60 years ago... We saw it....but thanks to this video.. I now SEE it for the first time..  Fascinating.
Okay. I’ll concede; this is more interesting than the video idea I sent you about landfills.   This was enrapturing.
Great as always...   Thanks...
We are abducting the fish and implanting trackers into them. Is that what aliens do to the humans that live in the mid west?  Is there a giant being planting trackers in people to understand their science so they can live with us?  😂😅😊 Lol total sarcasm by the way. Just made me laugh about implanting trackers in the fish.
There are no such things as solutions, only tradeoffs.
Did you get to meet with Doc. Sri Gourisetti?   PNNL are doing a lot on integrating renewables and upgrading the energy grid information systems to be able to do so.   Would you be willing to do an episode with PNNL on upgrading to a smart grid? Hawaii’s energy authority is also a good example of a grid undergoing this upgrade.
This video is Liam Anderson's nightmare
love the vid, but could do with less swearing
I imagine the fish screens mounted in a continuous loop that comes to the surface for cleaning and maintenance.
I'm sure you tried the salmon while you were on the Columbia, but did you try the lampreys?  They're good too.
it's a beautiful structure, more big stuff like these should be pretty
Generating power inside a fish is a beautiful idea
Not a fan of hydro and dams in general. Its one of the most damaging and dangerous "clean" energy sources. Dam failures are far too common. The US experienced 173 dam failures between 2005 and  2013. That's more than 20 per year.
As an engineer, I would expect you to use words correctly. A Turban is a Sikh headwear. A TurbINE is what spins. How would you pronounce Porcupine? Porcupan? What about Columbine? Columban? Surely not. That is the only criticism that has come to mind about you.
So, most of these dams have been around since the 1920's and 30;s,. Given the logic that dams are the equivalent to ecological nuclear bombs, than we should have died off a hundred years ago. But,  here we are, the dam is still here, the rivers are still here, the environment is still here. The only kind of fish that I can not not find on the seafood isle is salmon. Most of the agriculture that we sell on the world market is dependent on these dams to provide the means to deliver them in large enough quantities to keep cost down. Most of these dams could not be replaced after they are removed so make (dam) sure this is something you want, cause there will be no reset button after you realize that you made a mistake.
They destroy ecosystems by reducing watertlevels thus removing wetlands 😅 they are not the solution.
I always wondered who are people who dislike video like this.
china is building dams like there's no tomorrow.  They're causing HUGE ecological & environmental disasters in the name of blind speed economy. Just build 'em like cadies with NO REGARD for the surrounding areas. Ironically, they're killing the fishes that Winnie likes to eat. :(
Great vid! Maybe you could schedule a visit to Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil to see the waterfalls that only Niagra can match and the largest dam of the Americas at least
Thank you for this video!  I now understand a lot better why in many cases it makes more sense to remove dams than to retrofit them to current standards.  You live in an area where some dams are being removed to help the salmon like the Elwah and Klamath dams.  I'd love to learn more about the engineering it is taking to remove these dams and how successful it has been
So why don't the folks in CA just realize this and do this instead of removing dams on the Klamath?... It is not so simple. The dams on the Klamath tend to have higher heads and be of less electro generative significance than those on the Colombia. The salmon spawning assistive corrective measures outlined here are more capital intensive than can be justified by the meager value of electricity generated on the Klamath.  The flood control value of Klamath the dams is marginal. On the Klamath, it comes down to the irrigational value of the dams and recreational value of the reservoirs VS the value of the natural habitat and the inherent long term value of preserving both the fresh water recreational value of the salmon AND long-term saltwater value of the commercial salmon. hth
So many rural Americans who consider themselves patriotic and conservative would think this is a giant waste of money. Sad. Thankfully, there are plenty of people that know better
"Best dam tour guide..." 😂 Well played Grady!
❤ Wonderful video! I can’t imagine the time and energy that went into making it! Grady, would you consider making a video about Kakhovka dam on DNIPRO (not Dnieper) river in Ukraine 🇺🇦 that was blown up by the Russian occupational forces in June 2023 which caused an immense environmental and humanitarian catastrophe in the region.
Don't rivers shift positions over decades? How does damming effect that, and what benefits are we eschewing by not letting the rivers flow naturally? It seems wild to say that there is little difference between a dammed river and an undammed one in terms of flow. It's not just up/down, but left/right as well...
Very cool seeing all the mechanical, biological, political, and scientific gears turning in this video. Thanks for putting in the effort to create such a wonderful story that helped me learn just how complicated these things are and gain the hope that things will continue to get better when we have such wonderful people working on issues like this.
Fish blender go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"Dammed if you do Dammed if you don't" -the fish
I always loved water infrastructure and found the fish transportsystems interesting!
I want to go fish the output of the juvenile pipe. I bet large fish congregate at the output picking off the juvenile fish that are dumped out, so It would probably be good fishing and catching those fish will deter them from that spot giving the juvenile fish a greater chance of survival.
Any killer fish from Santiago?
I had no idea this amount of engineering and consideration went into dams. Fantastic job talking to all those people!
I love your videos where you visit real engineers out in the field and get to show of industrial equipment like this.
Thanks for sharing your videos. Always interesting and entertaining. One of the funniest things I heard when working for a power company with big hydroelectric powerhouses was about fish. No fish ladders at the pump storage plants yet there are plenty of fish in the upper reservoir. No they aren’t stocked they are pumped thru the turbines. The one plant that had a fish ladder, no It wasn’t to protect the fish, it was put in because the eels kept plugging up the unit trying to swim upstream thru the plant. The generator would start motoring, they dropped the gates on the unit to figure out what was plugging it up and found the turbine and gates plugged up with live eel’s and no room for water. Talk about an unexpected nightmare the first few times it happened. They said the funniest part was out of 32 units the eels always picked the same unit every time.
13:56, an extra deterrent would be to add spikes to that pipe😂
Turbines are Sushi makers...😅
Great video, as a marine biologist i love it
fish mixer, free meat by jeSus  :D
If beavers had evolved into the dominant life form on this planet they would have built better dams than us.
We seriously need an extended cut, "second channel" video about your tour through the dam. I can not emphasize this enough.
8:16 I'd love a fish window in my office lol! Way better than an aquarium. Lucky guy.
engineers are cool
Dam! That was interesting.
i thought they put cat food factories in dams
Whoooo fish ladder video incoming!!
@PracticalEngineering train railway love what ????
Grady! Have you heard about the Port St. Lucie nuclear power plant here in Florida? It uses the ocean to cool some of the plant and it not only sucks up fish but humans too! Satellite pictures show the intake pipes just off shore & the stories of the 2 people who have been sucked in are pretty wild.
I want to touch it! 3:25
Hope you enjoyed your visit to my wonderful state of Washington!
Last time I saw a fish in a turbine the goldfish didnt last too long.
I enjoyed this dam video.
I was hoping to see you use the term "externalities." *_Darn, great video, though._*
this is your best video so far. Maybe I am bias as I love dams but you got so much access and the engineering, technical drawing etc is fantastic
Lets not kid ourselves this is a exception a great exception but most if not all infrastructure destroys species snd ecosystems and most people who fund build and design them are either ignorant or willfully ignore the impacts.
15:41 I'd be interested in watching a video from you and/or Brian (Real Engineering) about those new turbines!
This is so cool that technology going green is amazing and interesting way to design new technology. Thanks for these videos.
fish bible....
Definitely shared! So informative and educational!
Will it Blend????
the thing that now makes me concerned is... in third world countries I don't think they consider wildlife safety. I hope not many fish became extinct because of this
what an awesome, well-researched video!!! you and your team should be very proud!
I was expecting this video from you... Thankyou
"Best dam tour guide" NICE
Something is very fishy about this!!😅
Amazing stuff. Those dams are environmental superheroes, keeping millions of tons of CO2 from being emitted annually. Glad to see they're working to make them even more environmentally friendly.
Loved this on Nebula ❤ It’s so cool you got a chance to take a deep dive into their professional lives and report back for us. Thank you Grady for these excellent videos. 👏
i thought they were nice considerate steps towards fish, but  then they still eat them......
And yet we are starving for power more than ever
Thanks for coming to PNNL!  It is great that you came here.
The plunge pools below , well, all damns is full of scavenger fish species precisely because a lot of dead fish come out of the dam outflow. Fishermen know this.
Shoutout to ecologically-friendly civil engineering. All my homies respect the USACE
I expected a ten second video with Grady saying "They don't! See you later."
TL:DR They don't lol
Love the format in this video! Not just teaching us, but learning with the viewer <3
Gyatt dam it...
Whina should learn from this... oh wait, they don't gaf
Love watching this channel, I hope someday I get as good at presenting and production as Grady does!
Grady is awesome. He's so passionate and wholesome. No one else could make me care about dams.
In bits?
3:20 man i don't think i'd be able to hold myself from touching those spinning shafts lmao
Let me know when your in the PNW again so we can catch a coffee! 🤗
Hard to overstate the benefits, but apparently harder to state the drawbacks.
A balanced, healthy ecosystem impacts us directly with clean water, air, soil and businesses such as fisheries. So it’s not human benefit vs environment benefit.. they are the same thing.
I’ve been on time more often than my actual classes
I am here after 2minutes of vedio uploaded😊 Also watching it  .
Woo!
FISH
Fish sushi
Faster than the fishies going through the turbines
Am I early?
