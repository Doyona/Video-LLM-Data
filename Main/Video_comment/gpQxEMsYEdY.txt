I have come to realize something, in the demo for this game in carousel, it looks like your inside the fnaf 2 place or, like inside a pizzeria, but in the full release of the game, your outside presumably a fall festival
Steelwools probably won’t do another thing like this next year, but they may do it again if they make another fnaf game after itp
DaRegularSauce is such a legend
Hey dawko, how did it feel about fazwrench and Vanni security mask, with the palm of your hands. 36:07 36:14 36:35 36:37 36:42 36:48 37:00 37:05 37:08 37:10 37:14 37:19 37:24 37:29
1:18.       DAREGULARSAUCE?!?!?!?!
Right after the interview you just see Maple push her nose through the door trying to get to her beloved master. XD
i wish thay kept the jumpscare whan you win still
27:40 Troll
The game is laggy as hell
At that moment 12:30 Golden Freddy's head appeared.
Watching this right before HW 2 comes out!
the flashlight is a throwback to Cory trying to use it in the daycare
AMAZING
YOU WONT GET AWAY WITH THIS
I'm trying to understand which part of the world are you from
Help wanted 2 is here!
TIMESTAMPS : 3:13 Breaker Room  10:09 Bonk-A-Bon! 14:51 Carousel  Thank me later ;)
Cool how we got a FNaF SB DLC 4 months ago, the movie 1.5 months ago, and this week already FNaF Help Wanted 2 will come out!
I wonder if scott just told steelwool all the lore and they just have to put it in their games
Is it on quest?
12:31 WHAT HAPPEND TO FREDDY FAZBEAR!!???
15:29 that is indeed JJ
9:53, imagine of Markiplier's reaction by clicking continue and then jumpscare.
Will this be a PSVR exclusive? Every trailer/gameplay video is always using a PSVR.
It'd be great if Helpy made the spine crack sound from Pizzeria Simulator when you whacked him.
How many Fnaf games are included in help wanted 2?
That looks……. AMAZING
great
what
Steelwool make every where the booth like the netherlands i want to go to the booth next year pls im a fnaf fan
Блиииииин, я бы хотел поиграть в вр... Но у меня его нет
Who here fast forwards until they meet an interesting part on the video? 👇
My dog has died
I love how fnaf youtibers becomes spastic chickens once they put on the VR headset
I got a headache with this dude screaming like bro shut up
9:53 Funtime Freddy & Bon Bon
i love how you can see the team so excited and happy to share their game with these people that are so dedicated to their series.
Im looking forward to watching play throughs and would love to play it. Unfortunately I will have to wait for a port, cause I cant play VR with seizures.  But thank you for sharing all the fnaf news you get. I check your page like the news xD
Will be putting on my wish list on steam
and what's fnaf-fy about it? It can be just like any other horror games, but with fnaf models of enemies. Its not fnaf, its a weak copy. They ruined it all.
bad
that freddy was da raglure saus
Da Regular Sauce continues to astound and amaze. It sucks he and Vanessa have been kicked out of a lot of malls for being too awesome and pulling a lot of excited fans, but that's what happens when you make and operate such an accurate, beautiful costumatronic.
17:27 (pixelated) *I can do anything!*
Y can I hear jsab in the background?
Fake Scott makes this 1000 time better lol
This is gonna be so cool to play and watch dawko do it!
I am so glad that i am a part of this community. Definitely the best community out there.
alright, all I'm hoping for with the sequel is that steel wool dosent add something like that gosh darn plush baby level
What’s Fnaf move
honestly this could of been a huge dlc! but a 2nd game is cool
12:33 look in the backround
you sound like a person doing an impression of a british person
27:52 Moon laughs at Dawko being scared
Aw man i want to do that,how?
I think they should change the phrasing on the carrousel minigame to "1 minute until reboot" and maybe add a green progress bar to make it clearer that its a positive thing and you just have to survive The animations in this game are looking AWESOME, somehow better than help wanted 1, specially the jumpscare animations
Bonbon harassment
im all for the new things i just hope theres at least still fnaf 1 in there because i am not able to play the first help wanted game
This goes to show why steel wool is primarily a vr gaming company
No way
lol how did I miss this; I just found out about this haha!
The intro of the booth at pax made me so desperately want a Universal parks Halloween Horror Nights that is Five Nights at Freddy’s themed 🥹 SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY type tease tbh
Į just wish that it ain't a PSVR2 exclusive cause all videos are using PSVR2
MatPat is going to flip when he sees Moondrop in Help Wanted 2. Not to mention, the lore that will be added🤣🤣🤣
The animatronics look just like in game (except not robots) (was eclipse a robot ?)
if you wanted to buy a game would you recomend Help Wanted or security breach?
I love this community I can’t wait for the new game to come out!!!!!
OMG YESSSSS🤍🖤💀💛💜💚
Seeing the animatronics from fnaf 6 would be insane. From the ones from the alley to the ones you can buy, would just be insane. The rockstars  especially would be amazing
I wish I would get the help wanted 2 lil
I can see that steelwool are more experienced with vr games more than free roaming non vr games and the help wanted ones are the best ;)
Man this video really shows off just how ass the PlayStation is.
after scott cawthon retired I thought fnaf was dead, im glad steel wool is still keeping fnaf good and well
Cool yay
cant wait to be too broke to buy it
Do we know if Help Wanted 2 will be VR only upon release or are we also getting a flat mode too?
times like these are when i love being apart of this community. the future is bright and the community is coming together (unless the toxic people persist) with hope for a greater future of fnaf. it makes me so unexplainably happy
i just hope the story of these games gets better right now its so, not fnaf? its hard to explain in a comment but i hope some people catch what i mean.
damn there is defo a lot of potential, hopefully when i get my vr exactly a year from now i can play this lmao
Wait its out
31:30 my favorite part
12:28 freddy head at the left lol
You look like Mr. Beast 😅
Im surprised spiff hasn't made anything on this yet.
Christmas dlc and another Halloween dlc and a thanksgiving dlc
Comment if you saw the Freddy head pass by in the end of bonk a bon
12:30 casually see someone holding a decapitated freddy... 💀
My friend said your kinda fine
Will this game come out for PS4 vr too?
A memory of a song you were in "darkest desire"
It'd be cool if in the full game they have something like the Trick or Treat House one from the first game again were animatronics wander around and you have to guess which animatronic appears to disguise yourself as them
MIMIC HAS A YOUTUBE ACCOUNT COMFIRMED???!???  Context: a mimic Scott appeared in the chat
all this fnaf stuff, it's just like 2014 and 2015
Bro i was live and though scott was realy there
Dawko, what are you even screaming about dude, nothing is happening, you have a flashlight. Either its genuine or you have an a**kissing problem lol.
Really hard watching him call the mini fun time Freddy’s, “Helpi” 🤣
At 12:30 some dude walked with a Freddy head in the background
my favorite youtuber
🐻🐰🐔🦊 best reveal everrrr
british kid
Steel wool casually typing ✈🏢🏢 in chat
But  carasel was the hardest but that's a big carasel
Ok hear me out I'm gonna have an irl eclips
Am I the only one who is glad funtime freddy is back with his very own mode
What did he say after losing to moon that had the steel wool guy nodding?
i didn't expect moondrop to be in help wanted 2
Will help wanted 2 be on quest 2
I'm pumped for this game!
damn those frame drops are lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Plus I don't understand fully or even understand English that good can anyone know when we would watch them play the game fully and normally, I know its gonna be with money and stuff first but later we will see it.
16:05 He just wanted to say hi😔😔😔😔.
It looks so awesome but im SO CONFUSED😭😭😭.
Yes
👁️👄👁️👏👏👏👍
GUYZ ITS NOT DASKO ITS THE MIMIC!
Irl jump scares at the end 10/10
😱😱😱😱😑😑
Poor mat dawko is screaming his head off from terror amd matpat is solving the thing😂
I just subbed ❤❤❤
6:10
MOON!? I LOVE MOON ❤
Glamrock freddy meet huggy
I've never seen such serious dedication from a game series like this ever
is it just me or is the funtime freddy bit exactly the same as it is in the glitched attraction?
This one has the potential of being the best game of the entire series
Спик раша
Anyone remember night terrors from the first? I WOULD BE TERRIFIED if there was a moon night terror
12:30 i havent seen anyone point out the Freddy head being carried in the background here?????
BRUH Wanna hear smith sad? I stayed at the hotel near where Pax was held but I went to Seattle for my friends birthday so I couldn’t go 😭😭😭
12:32 you can see a Freddy head from the move                LEAKS!!!!
Dawko you are my favourite Fnaf YouTuber because I love watching your videos like you are so focused in the help wanted 2 game and i wish I got to meet you at Pax west but I live in Australia so it’s a bit hard but anyways keep up the good work
🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬜🟪⬛⬜ 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛🟪 🟪🟪⬛⬛🟪🟪 i always come back
10:48 “Remember, you’ve got 2 hands” words to live by

Ain’t gon lie I hope there’s a racing mini game where you race against roxy and you have to be first place to win
Hey dawko can you please play mangles revenge on rec room
Bro you in fusion should do another video together
hi dawko
Steelwool should hire you as part of their marketing team
12:30 a guy in left background had freedy’s head from the movie in his hands😅
Already it’s been like 3 days since ruin released
oh man. the footage was SO overstimulating but it's so cool looking. can't wait to see the full game!
3:17 this is most likely the last that game before the movie
Is there a vid of the demo with no commentary. I want to hear the game not shouting lol
And this is why Dawko's amazing. Thank you so much Dawko, I'm super excited for the game. <3
hope this booth comes to pax east as well!
For the Wack a Bon, someone needs to mod the game so every time you hit them Scout from TF2 says “BONK”
Did he forget that we never the movie comes out? That’s the last thing 😢😢😢😢
I wish I could've gone but I have no plan on going overseas but I hope they can find a way to do it down in Australia.
did anyone see freddys head in the backround
Monty brother
Cousin Bonnie
Dad Freddy
Mom, Roxy
My sister dress up as Cassie
Bro, I want to pax west it was sick I want is the dress up as Gregory Cuz Fnaf lore duh
oooo i luv this guy
ok this is amazing and i'm so hyped no hw2 but i wonder how that will work in flat mode if there is even going to be a flat mode i wish cuz i don't have a vr headset
Im sorry to say this but it sucks
Sometimes I hate that money is a thing😅 Im a 28 year old adult who lives in Washington State and I wish so much I could have gone. This game looks so badass
Look at the Freddy head in the back in 12:32
HI
So, we've seen three major FNAF game releases from this company now. They've all been critically buggy unfinished messes. I am not going to allow a heavily curated for media demo reel snippet running on high-end computer equipment to color my expectations of this new game. I have zero expectations that this will be some flawless gem on release worthy of hype, praise, and attention.  That said... yes, this looked pretty good. This looks like exactly the type of gameplay Steel Wool should be working on. They've got experience from the last title under their belts and they seem to be really clever about creating these contained and highly memorable experiences that look quite fun to play and engage with. They should probably be doing more things like this. Short contained environment minigames like this are ideal for the sort of high quality assets and details they seem to like putting into everything. It's a small enough environment that they can get away with a lot without compromising game integrity through lag and other loading hiccups, the likes of which plagued Security Breach.  We'll see what they've really learned when the game is finished and we have a full context of what the game has to offer... and how packaging it all together changes the experience compared to this tiny vertical slice of content. I sincerely hope they are bringing in more testers to help them manage all of this. I can see the love and passion they have for these games, but they have over-reached in scope more than a couple times now. I wish them the best and hope they'll succeed, but they have a lot to make up for.
THEY AREN'T SCOTT and are you going to watch the new fnaf movie
Thanks for reminding me the mimic is Dawko. By the way your the mimic!!!
I'm more than hyped for it's release!
Prize corner
Dude when you died in the bonk the things someone was carrying a Freddy head like a free freddy fnaf 1 head
this was so cool i really wanted to go to pax west but my family dont have the money sadly but hopefully next year i can :D (probally not)
this is so awesome!
give us the specific locations
damn wish i was a fnaf youtuber but some day i will be
Fnaf is so real now
I just saw Freddy's head at the back after dawko was jump scared by plus baby
“What should I say?” “Mimic things” 😂😂😂
I am very excited for the new release of help wanted to. I can remember when it started out as final one. And now look at where we're at. The franchise has grown a lot in the past years.🐻💛
I can only imagine how good this looks with the PSVR2's excellent OLED screen for pitch blacks!
12:31 FREDDY HEAD
Need it on quest
Carousel looks CRAZY!!!! So awesome omg!!
This means fnaf can be real
It's time for a darkest desire 3 when the full game comes out
Excuse me?!
but will it release on Steam too?
12:31 Fnaf movie Freddy head in background?!?
beautilf DEMO SteelWoolStudios
27:40 this will always get me in the future lmao
fnaf help wanted 2: the best fnaf game so far that we never even asked for.
One Day, I will be Dawko's equal. Day: 335
"I'VE GOT TWO BONKS I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE!"
What we really need is a vr port of fnaf 6
I'm excited but I don't have a vr set so I hope they're making a non-vr version like the first help wanted ended up getting.
Meanwhile, the workers at stealwool leark in the background  Laughing Menacingly.  Mainly during the Moon Carnical one, you can just heat them Laughing 😂
Hello Dawko
Dang he murdered kelpy so much lol
IM SO HAPPY MOON IS IN HELP WANTED 2
I love games, I love developers, I love comminuty, I LOVE FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S!!!❤
Pls no moon😭😭😭
Why do people have to smack their hands around as they talk it's freaking annoying
12:30 what are they doing to Frederick Von Fazbear? 😭
I know people were disappointed with security breach's release but after ruin, the booth and help wanted 2 they clearly love the series and it's clear the problems with SB were due to a lack of time
Dawko: Helpy I'm sorry!! *continued to bash helpy over the head*
12:30 BRO the freddy head in the backround
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹 SUCH EPICALLY COOL GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE,DAWKO~!!@;"3 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹 😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
Yeśszssssssssssssssss
From security breach I hope we see big security room in VR :) ok. that may need nice VR legs because you need to move constantly. I hope this will come to SteamVR same time as PSVR2 release
Did anyone else notice the guy in the background just casually walk by in the background holding freddy’s head 😂
We are all looking forward to it help wanted 2 ^^ Team Steel wool Amazing, and so are you) and of course Scott
😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😭😱😈💯💯💯💯😡😡😡😡😤
the funtime freddy jumpscare is wayyyyyyyyyh better than hw 1
This game looks like it’s actually taking advantage of being in vr.
Wow
so it IS psvr2 exclusive?
I dont know what I can say, but it was absolutely awesome 😊😮
what a time to be a fnaf fan!! always love to see you hyped for new games!!
HELP WANTED 2 HELP WANTED 2 HELP WANTED 2-
Dawko I hope I return well I mean about mimic like I want more of me
What was everyone's favouite level? Mine was Carousel
Let me see!!!!!!!!!!!!
12:31 Freddy’s head casually passing (bottom left)
One Day, I will be Dawko's equal. Day: 334
Imagine seeing tiger rock in help wanted 2💀
Okay, I'm not sure why I remembered it, but I saw that the number 395248 which can be seen on the Faz-Wrench at 36:21 is the same number which they used in Fnaf 3 in the 3rd night's minigame. It's very interesting to me and I wanted to let everyone know about it and make sure it's out there. Hopefully, there's a reason for it and it helps. If not, I hope you have a great day regardless!
12:31 Is no one gonna bother talking about that dude in the background with Freddy's head XD
FNAF has been my child hood. ever since I was 1 years old
bro I just don't get why every SB trayler hits hard.
DUDE. I SCREAMED WHEN MY PARENTS WERE SLEEPING😵😵‍💫
I had to turn the volume off mate, your screaming feel unnecessary at times and a bit cringe,
That glamrock freddy costume is amazing!!! I just gotta say that having a real life vanny mask would be awesome to have, I would hope they add the detailing on the inside of the mask, I just think that would be cool to have in your house as a cool fnaf collectible. I also hope that the mimic or glitchtrap are in this game in some capacity.
I'm impatient for help wanted 2
12:31 nobody gonna talk about the dude with the Freddy head in the background?
I love Steel Wool for giving us the opportunity to bonk the crap out of Plush Babies and Bonbon.
Unbelievable the things at the FNaF booth are real. Everything looks like straight out of the game! I love this community!
This confirms that at least sun and moon were in sister location at some point
That whack a mole minigame is so funny
This is truly amazing I wish I went with Dawko.
Get some rode travel mics there be good for the next one
During bonk a bon I saw someone in the background holding a Freddy head when you died
I love the ... i just love all of them.❤❤❤
I had the same issue with circuit board lol. Glad I’m not the only one who struggled with that part specifically 😂
Har har har har har
All jumpscares:  9:53 Funtime Freddy  12:27 Plush Baby  14:32 Moon  21:52 Moon again but in a different animation  22:01 Plush Baby again but in a different animation  29:26 Moon again but a different camera angle  29:37 This is actually a really cool Funtime Freddy jumpscare  32:26 Moon again but with a different sound
5:44 Wheatley...
6:54
Amazing vid 👍
.MedMen Stock Moving up Fast! Health Services Directing the DEA to reschedule Marijuana! Buy MedMen Stock Today! Mmnff........
HW2 might be the only game I've gotten hyped for
Hi, I'm Brazilian, I came from the Core channel and what an incredible gameplay, I'm looking forward to seeing you play it in full.
I actually hope we get to see more of the nightmares from fnaf 4, we didn’t really get to see the actual nightmares that much in help wanted in my opinion
I think Dawko pummeling Helpy was fully intentional for the trauma Buff helpy put him through
Dude this looks awesome and terrifying at the same time!
Help Wanted 2! Im. So. Hyped🎉
Amazing 😍
I’m so happy moon is in it, moon and sun are my favorite out of all the games, when I played security breach I danced with sun (crouching and uncrouching) and I’m currently working on and animation on my reaction with moon (I watched people play before) if it’s good enough I’ll post it, I have so many ideas with just moon and sun, I hope y’all have a good day and loved the video, sorry this is long
01:24 WAS THAT THE BITE OF 23?!
What a shame that I was in a completely different continent and can't go to the event😢
I love how a lot of this lines up with mad pats ruin theory!
17:30 anyone getting jevil vibes
Vim pelo Core ❤❤ 🇧🇷
I hope this game has all of fnaf 4 5 and 6 and is not just going to be a collection of minigames, I am concerned that it wont considering some of the stuff from fnaf 4 and 5 where in Help wanter 1. If it has ultimate custom night and sister location as well though that would be fantastic.
William Afton and glitchtrap
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH I WANTED TO HUG GLAMROCK FREDDY... IF I COULD I WOULD GO TO THE STATES JUST TO DO IT. I SWEAR!!!
Does anybody know if it will be available for VR 1?
Like glitchtrap will back
Funtime freddy just got creepier
CAN YOU TELL STEEL WOOL STUDIO IS HELP WANTED 2 WILL COME OUT ANDROID
Moon’s carousel game could be confusing for us because of the timer that where Dawko died-
The game looks sick!
I'm loving everything about this game so far! Especially the fact that you can now get jumpscared even if you win! Also, did Dawko seriously just find an Easter Egg in the DEMO of the game already?! What are the odds? Lol
Anyone notice at 12:30 a Freddy head gets carried out in the background
I would love to see Dawko playing and screaming at this while Matpat tries to solve the lore. Moon looks sick.
didn't they sayd to not take fotos or videos of the demo of the game?
Que humilde Dawko, mostrándonos la demo jugable de Help Wanted 2.
22:17 door jumpscare
that carousel moon jumpscare is scary !!!
This might be the best thing SteelWool has made!
Dawko should play the Killer In Purple remake for Vr that’s coming out September 19th
yo is that Just Shapes & Beats i hear in the background of 25:30? ik thats such a random thing to notice but i hear the song Chronos in the background lol
One Day, I will be Dawko's equal. Day: 333
Help wanted 2   I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT WHEN THE FU- WHEN DID THIS BEGIN PRODUCTION
Does anyone know if Help Wanted 2 will come to Oculus
22:17 i like how mabel knows how to open a door
This better be on oculus/ meta quest or I’m going to cry
Hope the menu is more interactive, and it's not just how it's shown here
God the moon game mode looks like madness holy crap
i wish i could've been there, it would've made my dreams come true, meet freddy fazbear :(
I hope ballora is in HW2 cuz sucks she was absent in the first game
okay this seems like a lot of fun, so i might be mean to my partner who has a VR set and buy the VR games to play, need to pick up beat saber again anyway, love flailing my arms and suddenly crouching, my knees love it XD
I'm so glad they're not using the exact same FNAF 1 static sound effect they've used for their last 3 releases
WOW THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD
It has definitely been a wild ride seeing FNaF go from small inde game to having a booth at PAX.  Absolutely incredible!
There is ai for making audio better
I love your videos keep it up and I can’t wait to see you in the five nights at Freddy’s movie
Alright time for a new song after matpats theory video
I STARTED GIGGLING AND KICKING MY FEET OMG
Damn Dawko you seem such a cool, down to earth guy man. It'd be cool to see you baz, ryan, and will play rockband lol... But it almost seems impossible considering Harmonix not wanting to dish out the plastic instruments. smh
I’m so happy for Dawko that he enjoyed playing the Demo of Help Wanted 2 as well as giving a closer look to DaRegularSauce's FNAF props 😁❤️
When I saw this I was shocked, this is amazing.🥰I wish I could’ve played this.❤ I can’t wait for Help Wanted 2, too bad I don’t have a vr headset because I really want to play it, 😢but it’s ok.:) Thx to the team for making this game I love how moon is in it, I didn’t expect him to be in there, he’s a really creepy character I’m pretty glad they put him in there.😊 I love the stuff @DaRegularSuace made it’s amazing, holy cow.🤩
When this game comes out I'm definitely gonna play It
This is trending yo
Hey dawko, would you like your own spring Bonnie or Fredbear suit?
I'm sorry but that looks so boring
OMG THE DOOR AGAIN LOL
The carousel is AMAZING I’m so excited to see all the new creative minigames
Bro imagine if they made a bonk a bon in real life
How do you switch help wanted into VR if it starts you without vr
22:19 the door opening had me like 🧐 but seriously I’m hoping the finished game/vids of the game will have less of a motion sickness effect, it ducks that I can’t play FNAF games anymore and have to be really careful watching newer ones where I don’t know where the flashing is because of my photosensitive seizures and motion sickness
The carousel seems pretty interesting, it seems to be based on the Fnaf 2 merry-go-round judging by the toys and original animatronics.
Did y'all see them hold the Freddy head at 12:33
Love Mable opening the door at 22:17 so cute! The booth and game both look incredible. You can really see the love and passion everyone involved put into it. Cannot wait to see what else they have cooked up for us! Those props and the Freddie costume were amazing too!! So glad you got the chance to check it all out Dawko!
It definitely looks exciting!
Please remember to stay Covid safe and mask up during cons, Covid is still a very real virus and people who are immune comp still can’t leave our houses because of people spreading it to us or our families
What kind of VR is that?
Can you play fnaf 3 plus?
Kinda annoyed that it ain’t going on oculus but it still looks good
Can you please play dormitabis remastered?
Help Wanted 2 looks amazing so far, can't wait for the full release!!  Also congrats on getting on the trending page 🎉🎉
YO MOONDROP!!
Wonder if that glitchy arcade is due to it being a demo or being on purpose
The code on the back of the wrench prop lol
I think a vr level centered around Mazercise would be a cool idea for steel wool to make for help wanted 2
you know i think i like the mimic more                           joking
See u on the flipside Scott
Famuos words "nope no-one is here"
Man I would go to Paris but I live in iran *sigh* I have no money but I'm happy glam daddy is here
12:30 I saw that Freddy Head in the background!
Trending!!!!
Around 12:28 if you look to the left in the background you can see Freddy head
This was so cool! I can’t wait to see the game
Will this game be only on ps5 VR? Because i really want to play it byut i have a ps4 vr
did you see tf2?
So Help Wanted 2 will have fnaf 1?
3:13 is when he starts playing, if you want to skip his dialogue
I think a really unique feature (unique) would be a panel to repair the megaphone after sometime if it’s use, if it’s easy enough of course
I love your videos.
the steelwool team really seems very friendly and fun .. I love how happy they looked when dawko played hw2
genuinely so impressed
Omg this game is so amazing already the best part of the game for me is that moondrop one its really good thank you dawko for making this video so entertaining 😊
It's almost as if Dawko doesn't like Helpy for some reason...
Im exicited to see ballora gallery's
For 8$
FINNALY gameplay revealed let’s gooo help wanted 2 gonna be amazing I’m so exicted
I want Dawko to put the fredbears wakie takie on sale
Watch the new Barrington tapes
Dawko will u ever play Fnaf Ar again?
At 24:46 I noticed they were playing Barracude by Noisestorm.  Edit: Was there a Just  Shapes & Beats booth?
I like that their actually talking and responding fo feedback.
What does moon look like he’s having a seizure whenever the light is pointed at him 💀
1:02 he just comin in to check if you alright     also 22 hours ago???
On my b day i Will get a hex plush
moons jumpscare is sick omg
Fnaf pizza simulator mini game in the vents who’d be sick
Love it❤
William appleton😈😈😈
Helpie needs a lawyer. lmao
that's not fair...i wanna hug Feddy too...
12:32 har har har har
Cant wait to see EddieVr  play this
6th on trending is wild
did anyone else see the dawko in the backrooms 2 at 22:15😐
I wish i was there...😢
15:06 why did he start sounding like phone guy here?
Idea: Arcade Mode In arcade mode the game will throw you into a random night/minigame and you need to survive it and then be thrown into the next random night/minigame (1 point for every night/minigame completed). It's just a little thing you can do for fun or to challenge your friends with in trying to beat the highscore (maybe lore is given once every minigame and night have been completed).
THE GAMEPLAY IS AMAZIIIIIIING, i liked more the bonk a bon level  BUT  Noticed that bonk a bon were teased in the trailer for HW2 in that poster?  Following that logic, there will be an circus baby minigame too, related to the ice cream arcade somehow (font the poster "stay cool")
Hey congrats on 2 million subs man. Wow, didn't feel that long ago when you had 1 million.
so cool to see!
Am I the only one who saw a poster or game with the fnaf ar snow animatronics on it
Dawko my man thank you for showing this to us cuz i couldnt go to the pax west and i wanted to seethe game play of it love you man :D
imagion how much those steel wool ps accounts are worth not only do they have demos of unreleased fnaf games but they could have control over everything is sb and ruin
Ilove you❤Dowko❤
i would NOT have the courage to get in a freddy suit
I love how you can hear people getting jumpscared in the background and screaming
This is great. I love all the Fnaf events. It's great ‏‪0:58‬‏
52 days until movie
I'm really glad SteelWool is returning for another VR game. Help Wanted was absolutely fantastic, to me one of the best FNAF games no doubt. I'm sure HW2 will blow us away, specially after everything they learned from the failures of Security Breach. This is gonna be awesome.
honestly, the panic of trying to remake the circuit board after the timer started was really funny, hopefully if this game has a blacklight difficulty mode like the first game, they use that and you actually HAVE to do that with the stress of flashing alarms, a timer, AND moon
Right around here 22:18, I saw the door open on it own, until I saw Mabel in the lower left corner
Choc. C?c?c,g4❤
dawko should keep the crappy microphone, it's like the funny mic.
I'm so sad that I missed pax
Dam FNAF will prolly end in 5 more years
Wow This game is gonna be so good,and everything looks great and moon looks really creepy and sick (I really get jumped every time that Dawko get jumpscared by moon)  I can't  wait more to see you playing it in future.❤❤
Why do the animatronics go sideways when they jumpscare
Nah, this dude is too annoying to listen to.  Could I get a transcript please?  Or maybe a different dub?
Matpat was right he said moon was a old animatronic and hes in the fnaf 2 restaurant
This is so awesome that they gave the preview to you I’m so happy they gave it to the best person they could of and the best person that deserves it ! Thank you steel wool for giving it to him, this is awesome ! And as someone from Australia who couldn’t make it to the convention pls bring one to Australia!!!
That’s not the very first booth there was a previous one for the prequel
haha really amazing, love it and the reactions of the team
I’m going to personal spot glitch trap in the cow shadow
it is so amazing to see the interactions between the team at steel wool and the other people deeply in love with this franchise like dawko and da regular sauce! it just shows that it became a passion project out of love and care everyone puts into it and it can be seen in the booth, in the props in the game and every little thing put into it and how we see others act in the booth and as a long time fan it makes my heart melt!! thank you so much everyone!!
I wanted to see exclusive footage but it's just too loud with the cam footage, guess I'll have to keep waiting cause this is a suboptimal experience as a viewer with all due respect.
Why do you spoil the game in the thumbnail? 😞
During Bon Bonk Your Not Supposed to Hit Helpy
I love how the moon circuit board thing is almost like the playtime with percy pal boss i mean there both chaotic
hi
Casual golden freddy head at 12:31
why are you in the fnaf movie markiplier wouldve been better
Xbox 360 mic
The vibes from the new vr game are just immaculate, sooo scary and different
Imagine if there’s Ultimate Custom Night in this game
very exited for help wanted 2
I just started watching the video and I have to say, DaRegularSauce(?) as GlamRock Freddy doing the happy foot stomps after hugging Dawko was adorable- Now to watch the rest of the video
i can't wait for it to come out !!
Moon gotta chill
Dawko is such a goofy man. I absolutely love it, we all do, hopefully Help wanted 2 will be a banger like Security Breach and Ruin
Fnaf movie characters
Do we know if Help Wanted 2 will also get a Non-VR edition yet? 🥲
They def need to make bonk a bon win amount higher imo
Amazing thank yau
I love your music it's spreading👍💜
38:31 I'm... I'm... THE MIMIC!!!
MOOOOOON!!!!!!
Wow this game is making progress in being devolped quik
Dawko delievering another banger I love your videos man
Did they record new voice lines for Moon and Funtime Freddy?
ñ
14:31 wait thats a level from moon??
9:52 thats evil
I really hope we will get a level with monty because knowing moondrop has a level it makes me really excites and hooeful for a level with the chadgator
I can't wait to see Mark playing this and having his own conversations with the characters and giving them the fists of doom.
Me during the first few levels- this is cool Me during the carrousel level- 😰
at 12:31 down the door you can see someone moving the freddy head from the movie
Brother wake up, the FNAF king uploaded
me when i 1st see this:OMG HE RECORDED THE WHOLE LOT AND HE COULD OF BEEN IN TROUBLEEEE also me: oh steel wool actually let him ITS SICKKKKKK
I love to see Dawko playing and screaming at this while Matpat tries solving the lore. Also Moondrop looks sick.
TBH the camera audio was better.
No Helpys we’re hurt in the making of this video..well maybe a little lol..😅
Thanks for the ganeolay
Play the custom night for playtime with percy!
Y know what could be the best of the help wanted 2 VR is the animatronic salvaging id really want to see how it is itd be so funn
FNAF 11
Love how everyone at the booth came together to repeatedly jumpscare Dawko 😂
OMG 🎉🎉🎉
Good Job 👍
I had the same employee helping me out with my Breaker Room session at PAX. He kept laughing because I was being a shaking coward the whole time! 😂
I want fnaf 6
In the breaker room indians mind: "Hatto waha se jaldhi hatto"
2.2 k th
Looks amazing so far
This game looks so good Can not wait to try this game
Hey dylan
duuuuuuuudeeee
Yo fnaf help wanted 2 looks GOOD
12:32 Somone is carrying a Freddy head
I ALMOST LITERALLY THREW UP FROM EXCITEMENT IM SO EXCITED FOR HELP WANTED 2!!!!!!!!!!!!
The jumpscare for moon looks a lot like the jumpscare for the mimic. Matpat might be on to something 🤔
w
As I watch you struggle on the levels make me so scared of how intense this will be for me.
Hi dako 👋
Wanna join the legion?
I love how Dawko keeps throwing his hands out to the side and then clasps them together over and over.
perfect at everything I ALWAYS COME BACK
seems a bit laggy
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa HHHHHAT😶
damn matpat was right on the money with helpwanted2 😭
I wish i can meet you in Washington  but its too late
this is where i just learned about the game... cool, another fnaf game, time to save up money for it even tho i will probably never play it more than a few times.
gameplay starts from 2:53
Note To Self: do not watch at max volume with headphones
I really don't like how they only use the security breach jumpscare sound.
A buff helpy reference would be funny to see.
you probably get asked this a lot, but I wonder, is this going to be available in Flat mode too? I can see them being able to utilize Left and Right Clicks for the "2 hands" thing.
22:17 MABLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE APPEARANCEEEEEEE
YOO DID ANYONE SEE THE FREDDY MASK IN THE BACKGROUND? 12:31
Being honest, I dont think the movie is going to be that good, the same ppl that are making that movie made the Megan movie and it sucked.
ngl that looks kinda bad 😭
this came on after i just saw the video of dantdms dog dying
Yes I will be able to play help wanted 2 I have psvr2
Dawnko:FREDDY HEY OMG IT'S YOU  Freddy:your mother
"Was your favorite ride the carousel?"  Is that game possibly establishing that Baby's Pizza World existed at the same time as the FNAF 2 restaurant?!
11:37 R.I.P 3 Helpies..
Did Steel Wool allowed you to film your playthrough in high quality?
I love that funtime freddy jumpscare!
Man, i was late
This game looks amazing.
W H A T
3:51 my heart would drop
Man, Fnaf has come such a long way. I’m super hyped to play this game! I can’t wait till I make a Megaman level of the Fnaf 1 pizzaria location (Killer Man/ William Afton) :)
This game looks AMAZING 💜💟💜💟💜
I think one of the big take aways here is that this game is taking a lot of inspiration from circus aesthetics (maybe relating to circus baby's pizza world?) And is also making a big emphasis on sun and moon (and eclipse) so I'm very excited to see how that plays out (also dude I hope we get full fnaf 4 and SL in VR that would be sick
Im happy you had fun
Dawkos voice is so different in the gameplay clips😂
Android user still waiting for security breach android be like:💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
The carousel level is so epic. it feels like a moon bossfight
Hello yes I’m steel wool FNAF help wanted 2 and 3 and 4 and security breach dlc 2 AND the next fnaf game all comes out in a bundle on September 10th 2023
27:42 jumpscare =D
Carousel looks incredible!! I can't wait for this game to come out :3 I hope there's a little glitchtrap appearance... 😸
"Theres no perfect/really good developers-"
im so excited for you to play the full release :))))
Ñ
Ñ
Damn I wish I could go to this. And Help Wanted 2 looks amazing.
the mic made you sound so diffrent
dawko please convince steel wool studios to put the salvage minigames in fnaf help wanted 2
it must be an incredible feeling seeing someone have a blast playing a game you spent so much time on
I cant wait for this game to come out so the Fnaf Lore youtubers can pick it apart for the Lore.
I am so Excited for Fnaf Wanted 2 Glad Moon will be in it he is my favourite character 💙
You obviously know when Dawko uploads it’s an awesome day!
OMG EXCITING!!
ya know I think sun and moon were my favorite characters from security breach. Now Ruin brought eclipse and help wanted 2 gave moon a unique jumpscare. They really out did themselves.
The bonk a bon level looks like so much fun!
So, did Scott work on HW2? If not, why'd he have to give permission?
Finally! fnaf is scary again!
1:18 If I saw Glam. Freddy I would knock on the belly and say 'Open up!'
Pls scarier jump scare
it must be so cool for steel wool to see people play their games in front of them!
Gimmick
14:53 the audio got louder
I imagine the the Moon Level will be called The Lunatic Carousel
I hope it comes on psvr 1
I would love to have sun come out when you survive the carousel and like the lights come on and sun says thank you.
We can all say now that this has changed the history of FNAF. Truly, this has been a good video to watch. Thank you Steel Wool Studio, and Dawko for this video. You all have a great weekend! 😄💯👍
Poor helpy .... or helpi.       idk any more lol
Dawko have you played Aftonbuilt?
Dawko is one of the 3 kings of fnaf Lore king:matpaf Game king:dawko General fnaf king:markiplier
°•
Bro, the whole game and gameplay sucks 💀
My favorite part is when he says "it's helpin wanting time" and starts help wanting over all the room
THE CAROUSEL MUSIC SOUNDS SO GOOD
Bro I can not imagine working under these conditions. I started cracking up at the carousel part thinking of a real worker frantically trying to do the job 😂
I'm not the only one having trouble seeing the point of being jump scared regardless of if you win right? That'll just wear out the scares faster.
This looks so awesoooome
When I was playing ruin, the sun in the moon, scared the crap out of me
I wonder if they're using Unreal Engine 5 for HW2 or if it's still using UE4.
i didnt realize daregularsauce made the animatronics in the booth AND the props!!!! they are truly a talented human and so happy they are with steel wool officially now!
HYYYYYPPPPEEEEEE IM N SO FOOKING EXCITED FOR THIS GAME also I would pay anything for those props
This was Amazing at PaxWest!
YOOO DAWKO THANKS FOR THE HELP WANTED 2 GAMEPLAY
Lol
Can't wait to play this game and my family think I have paranoid schizophrenia
I’m so glad dawko and a lot of others got to experience this and will experience the whole game in a few months, I have a ps5 but unfortunately I don’t think I’ll be able to get a PSvr 2 because of the price😢, so I’m stuck to watching people play it but i shouldn’t complain, i wasnt even able to finish the first help wanted game because I was too scared to do night terrors😂
Your hair looks so good 😳
For anyone wondering, the number 395248 on the back of the faz-wrench is a reference to FNAF 3. You had to enter that code into the wall panels in the office to get the minigame with Fredbear and Springbonnie. I wonder what this is trying to tell us...
this looks AMAZING!!!!!
Our first proper look into Help Wanted 2! It sure feels great to see more gameplay of it, and the fact that Dawko met some amazing ppl along the way.
I can’t wait for Fnaf Help Wanted 2 🎉
E
_________ /.               . \ \_________/ \_.             _/    \______/  I clicked on this video soon as I saw it
Every time he hits a helpy on bonk a bon it’s revenge on a buff helpy meme
I am SO excited for help wanted 2!! I hope I can go to a Pax next year and meet fellow fnaf enthusiasts 😊
Help Wanted 2 looks so good I am so excited for both Help Wanted 2 and the movie. When you played the Carousel for the second time when you started to panic when you could not find moon right at the moment you said you was going to cry you can see Moon 29:23 If you pause or slow down the video see Moon better.
Dawko and FusionZGamer are gonna be the kings of FNAF
They should probably make the first challenge in the video a little bit more clear because I'm sure that not everyone will figure out what those levers are for
did they invite mat pat?
I finally just subscribed
i hope there's more than a mini games in the final version
38:27 "Cassie! Cassie I'm stuck under the Pizza Plex! I'm stuck because I vented! I vented Cassie! I did it to be sus. Freddy told me I had to. He told me that I had to vent in order to be sus."  "He said that it would be hard, hard to be sus... but that he believed in me.... It wasn't hard at all........ Cassie It wasn't hard at all to vent and now I'm stuck under the Pizza Plex and Freddy won't stop laughing and now I'm SUS CASSIE HELP!"
I love how they used the helpy minigame spine crack sound effect from fnaf6 for every time you bonked him in vr
Help wanted should've been called Five nights at Five nights at Freddy's
Dawko’s excitement at the start of carousel is so wholesome 🥰
HELPY IM SORRY 😂
To one simple game to a movie 🥹
Dawko has a really good Gregory impression. I can’t tell the difference.
Good job
I'm super excited for this!!! I can't wait
byssiym
Were you at the frst day i was at nutendo con do but stil !!!!
12:30 that guy carrying Sauce's head lol
i don spik inglish
I want a stream of Markiplier, Dawko and Matpat playing this while screaming. Dawko screaming, Matpat figuring out THE LORE, and Markiplier just flipping off moon.
Listening to Dawko keep ruthlessly hitting Helpy while apologizing
Help wanted 1 was definitely the best fnaf game yet. Shame it's so much better in VR. But it's a really fun experience for long time fans who loved the Original style games.
Anyone notice how this moon has his teeth attached to the mask?
Nice
Man, I'm not even sure how to describe how hyped I am! To everyone who worked on the booth, Steel Wool, Scott, and DaRegularSauce. All of you are amazing. And of course, thank you Dawko for the video. Really looking forward to Help Wanted 2's release.  Also, the levels look amazing! As someone who's favorite character is Funtime Freddy, I'm so happy to see the Breaker Room come back. And it looks better than ever! Of course, all of them look so much fun and terrifying.
hi there
I’m very envious, I wish I could have gone! The FNAF booth and Da Regular Sauce, the animatronic eclipse, V.A.N.N.I. mask, Fazwrench, and walkie talkies, my God…
I wonder how they’re gonna make this non VR…
This is so amazing! I only wish I could've been there for myself. Seeing you play all these levels makes me so happy.
12:30 hi Freddy
I’m saving up for a VR headset to get both help wanted games. Wish me luck
Hello dawko
I wish to Collab my great game ideas with steel wool or make my own game  Why, because I have fresh and great ideas for a game,and my will be the real deal,and my game shares my vision of how I see FNAF as an icon
THE PRIVILEGE TO HUG GLAMROCK FREDDY IS INSANE
OMG, THI’S GAME LOOK’S SO GOOD.
Some dude in the background was holding a freddy mask
Holy cow HW 2 is looking sick! Once I'm able to play it, I'm never going to sleep again, but it would be worth it! (I had no idea there was a FNaF booth in Pax! I wish I was there when it happened, it would've been my dream come true to just be there!)
This game looks absolutely amazing ❤😱😱😱😱💯🔥
I think in help wanted 2 they’re going to put FNaF 5-7
i shouldve gone it was literally right next to me
Good
The new fnaf help wanted 2 that dawko showed us is probably in the beta or alpha stages.
Fnaf help wanted 2 looks great so far, glad to see a second game for help wanted coming soon 👍
Dawko plzz do a darkest desire 3
Guys if you didn’t know it’s Scott’s last project😢 thanks Scott
Dawkos gonna replace scott one day
Idea for steelwool if they see this: Instead of Moon shaking then covering his eyes and running when u shine the light on him, have Sun's sun-ray... things... begin popping up and then Moon pulls away at the last second before Sun takes control. I just feel like that would be a lot cooler, and make more sense.
i noticed that moon used sun's transformation scream when the light was pointed at him, i reckon this is a placeholder but if it's not it holds some interesting lore implications
moon jumpscare be lookin' solid
Omg omg OMG!!!!
It is ps2vr not quest 2
Amazing! Help Wanted 2 is looking incredible! And yes, Steel Wool set up another Fnaf booth for next years convention please!
Can we just thank the mimic for going to Seattle for us ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hopefully there is a vr flatmode for people who don't have a vr set like help wanted
Aw it looks so good! It's probably not coming to quest 2 dang it. I didn't want to have to get a quest 3
This looks amazing!!! I honestly didn’t expect having a bit of security breach mixed in but at the same time I’m not surprised either lol. I’m so excited for the official release of the game!
I love Dawko when he’s excited so much! He goes all jumpy and squeaky and it’s so funny and sweet😂❤
If there is gonna be some straight up Lore, im gonna assume Fazbear Inc made another VR Game and this time overlooked the problems so they can gain the budget to repair the Pizzaplex, maybe we might see the Mimic in this game too?
I wish i could of gone but no way i could it looked  like so much fun😁😊
Seeing the interactions was awesome, and the gameplay's looking great
Bro is da kind of fnaf 😂
My guys gonna become king of fnaf
I wonder if the game's set at Circus Baby's Pizza World.
im so excited for this to come out!!!! I only got fnaf vr help wanted (with the DLC) like 2 years after Markiplier got it!!! It was the FIRST game on my headset!! IM definitely going to save up money for this game when I can !!!!
Help wanted 2 looks so so very amazing!:))🩵 I watch your video like over and over again Lewis!☺️ I can’t wait to see you play all of it !:))🫂I think carousel 🎠 is my favorite and the Bonk-Bon one too! I love plush babies so yeah🥰! I’m😊so glad you had so much fun and you didn’t wanna leave!🩵I wish I was there playing the demo and seeing you Dawko and Glamrock Freddy and maybe next year if steel wool does it again.🩵 it’s alright if you were nervous playing and i would have been more nervous at it!:D 27:43I love the Ray jumpscare and it so funny!🤣 I love the video and I love you so much Lewis!💗 Wow!🤩Those security breach props that Sauce did is so incredible!!🩵 Thankyou Steel Wool and Scott!:D
I saw the premiere and it was awesome👍
I DONT LIVE THAT FAR FROM SEATTLE I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE!!!
12:32 Freddy’s head in back round
These gameplays are SO fun man😆 im super excited
If I had known about this, I would have convinced my mom to let me and her to go to Seattle to see the fnaf booth. But unfortunately I heard about it while the even was going on
I can't believe they put dawko as a exponent of the FNAF expo
That is sooo amazing, I'm so jealous I can't come 😭
Yo you should do a video of forza 4
I may be late at this but the 395248 easter egg behind the fazz wrench was really cool
Steel Wool, bring the FNAF Booth to Florida!!!!!!!
Help wanted is the best game and a great start for steel wool and then sb came out which is an absolute shitter
Dawko:Looking at moon BONNIE GO AWAY!  Bonnie:what I do :(
Dawko you should watch the new battington FNAF video its so good and lore juicy!!!!!
Holy crap, imagine a irl Bonk a Bon in like a Dave & Buster's or sum. That would be nuts
On fix the carelsile Dawko became phone guy
27:40 bro my dad does that to me and my brother when we’re playing vr all the time.
MATPAT WAS RIGHT!!!
I hope we get to repair new animatronics
Hehe all hail Moony :D
Not only did theRegularSause made the Freddy cosplays, he even did the props?! Gee wizz, I'm glad he's part of the steelwool team
Cool
So excited for this game
Why did I see regular sauce s freddy  head and someone was holding his freddy head
12:31 real footage of purple guy dismantling the animatronics!?!?!!
Do you think that help wanted two will come out on switch aswell?
It looks like they used Moons audio from Security Breach. Such a shame would love to hear something new from Kellen
The breaker room: 3:04 Bonk a Bon: 10:10 Carousel Repair: 14:40 I think there will be a gamemode called Fazbears pizza 🍕: You have to make a pizza while chica is watching you And if you make the pizza wrong chica jumpscares you and it gets harder and harder Animatonic repair: You have to repair a animatonic like in Hw 1 But the four main ones Are 1.Circus baby 2. Funtime freddy 3. Funtime foxy 4. Sun/moon The last game mode is Murdering moment You play has William Afton and you have to do a puzzle to make Freddy audio to lure the children inside a room and you have to get as many kids as possible before the time runs out if you dont get enough you get killed by freddy And one called the scooping room you have to do a 🧩 puzzel in order to not get scooped while enerd is watching you but the last one is impossible and you get scooped and thats ending 1 Ending 2 is where you get all the collectibles so you can escape And theres collectables all around the gamemodes and other places so in total     1. Breaker room 2. Bonk a Bon 3. Carousel 🎠 repair 4. Freddy faz bear pizza 🍕 5. Animatonic repair 6. The scooping room 7. Murdering moments  Yeah I know it's a lot my brain 🧠 likes to think of wild theories it's what I think might happen Sorry 😅
1:40 better yet do one. In ohiooooo.
Naughty boy, naughty boy you werent suppose to recorde the game play..... nighty night....
9:53 Funtime freddy having the broken chica jumpscare noise is annoying
Hey Dawko where is that place? I want to go there :D
I love that the Bonk a' Bon lights can be broken, I love that kind of interactivity in games.
27:42 epic momemt
Interesting
I’m so exited for help wanted 2 but I’m also remembering back in 2020 I begged my dad to let me get help wanted and he got it and I was too scared to play it- but hey I improved and I’m exited to play this! I hope we get some more juicy looooooore
AAAA
i can’t believe you hugged da regular sauce
IN FUSIONZS VID HE SAID THAT STEEL WOOL SAID NOT TO RECORD HELP WANTED 2
bro's house is haunted 22:15 (his door)
I want to hug JTop and the team very tightly for making such an awesome and scary looking game, and then I wanna ask what happened with SB/Vanny
🐻🎤🐰🟪🐤🧁🦊🦾
Will Fnaf help wanted 2 be on Oculus quest 2 or is it just for psvr2?
Bro needs to stop dropping the mega phone and just throw it at ft freddy
MOON!?!?
why is he saying move 💀⛽️
Interesting eye color on the plush babys and I think ist the first time that we see mangles original toy foxy form on the carousel
It was cool seeing you in real life at the booth. I couldn’t make it till the last day of PAX so I wasn’t sure if I would get to spot any FNAF YouTubers out in the wild or not, so that was a really fun surprise.
Im happy to see moon in this game hope you also get a cameo from sun as well
I love this
Nope! No thanks! I am NOT playing Help Wanted 2 after THAT thumbnail, I was scared shitless in SB from Moon and I will 100% shart in my underwear again and much more violently this time from VR Moon. No thank you 😇
This game looks awesome, I wish I can play fnaf help wanted 2 demo. It will be amazing for this experience
the carousel mustve been a big map, it has a big impact on ur fps while recording lol
Bonking the baby dolls! They knew what they where doing Pff!!!
help wanted? is it the game you’re going to play or is it just a demo? Just wondering Scott coffin to he gave you the full game?🤨🧐
I literally can’t wait for HW 2 and the movie to come out! This is a great year for FNAF!
I swear to god that Dawko will become the president of the FNAF community by now!!!
❤❤❤
SO COOL!!!
Can youtubers stop putting gameplay in the thumbnail? its so annoying
i wanna give freddy a hug
You NEED to play Make It To Midnight in Rec Room!
LOOOOOOOORRREEEEE
Petition to confirm that Dawko is the true king of fnaf.
🌟
SB PEAK FREE ROAMING
Helpy from fnaf 6 is in help wanted 2? Does that mean helpy is a Funtime animatronic?
Thank you for sharing dawko! It looks amazing!
I don't like that you get rewarded with a jumpscare and punished with a jumpscare, win or lose.
It’s Amazing To See That Some Actually Good Games Are  Coming To PSVR2
I’m hoping we get more Dreadbear too, I miss that big stinky bear.
This is why you're my favorite YouTuber
That Glamrock Freddy costume is by daregularsauce
Ok.
Dawko is just amazing at this point and I remember watching him when HW1 came out and now this! Edit: 12:32 FREDDY FAZBEAR!!!!
I like sister location,i first got into FNAF because of sister location
the audio was fine to me anyone else think it was fine?
There are so many conventions ive never been to and i wish i could go there as well, but thats just my europeen problems i guess
12:30 there is an employee with freddy's head in the back
Dawko has done it again
Dawko really got ready to throw hands😂 and hw2 looks AMAZING! Cant wait to play it once it releases
Dawko: *Gives Freddy a nice hug* Matpat probably: *Sexually assaults him to find lore* Markiplier probably: FREDDY YOU B*TCH! *Punches him*
I feel so happy for you man!
Thanks dawko
When is it coming to oculus quest 2
I KNEW SUN AND MOON WERE RELATED TO BB AND JJ I KNEW IT
I really want to play this once I comes out but I don’t own a PS5 or PSVR2😭😭
I love fnaf and everything it does!💙💜😈🔪🐻
...
Did he say you are playing as a technician?  A level 5 technician perhaps?
OOH YES HEHE
Help wanted gameplay
Im excited to watch other people play it, LOL
"You're so aggressive Moon!" Yes, that IS kind of his thing after all. Loved seeing how they reacted to Dawko panicking while dealing with Moon though.
Dawko hugging Freddy is just 😙🤌
It was amazing to meet you, Dawko, and take a picture with you! Sorry for chattering your ear off about theories! I hope to see you at more cons!
If fnaf 6 doesn't have a place in the game I'm gonna recreate the tragedies of fazbear's in real life.
14:52 it went from being recorded on a pc to recorded my mobizen on a nokia phone
Dawko said it was the 1st time well were I live it was its 20th time
YEZZZ HELP WANTED 2
I knew help wanted 2 wad going to be a massive upgrade but my God did Steel Wool outdo themselves  Looking forward to Help Wanted 2 🙃
al youtuber GG Games le va a gustar esto
YOOOO
Time too note the furry fandom (not a hate comment)
36:23  It’s the FNAF 3 code! :D
I will say I loved everything I just hope they work on the jumpscares a little bit because in the first help wanted game they were amazing 👏 so I hope in help wanted 2 the jumpscares will look just as good
I'm so happy that Steel Wool have gone back to VR for their next game, not only because the first HW is my favorite FNAF game but because it's clearly what they are best at, this looks absolutely amazing!
That glamrock freddy looks so cool, just like the game. Super accurate
is it psvr 2 exclusive?
Having had watched this, my respect for Steel Wool has skyrocketed. They're clearly really into what they're doing, and I feel like the FNaF games are safe in their hands. Hats off, Steel Wool👏👍.
By the way, I saw one of the workers carrying a animatronic head around but I couldn't tell if it was gold Fred or reg Fred around 12:35 in the vid. So idk if I'm the only one that saw that.
I would love to see dawko reaction to fnaf animatronics in real life 🤩
U should of broke all the light there probs a Easter egg or smh
Wait... don't tell me he is gonna become another vanny
Moon!!!!
❤❤
😍
This will be soooo cool
It looks amazing!
I LOVE these creative circus themed mini games!!! This is so cool
Is this going to be on quest 2
Why was security breach as mid as it was when both help wanted and apparently help wanted 2 are so good?
A FNaF 3 themed PAX booth set in the Fazbear's Fright office with Pepper's Ghost light illusions of the Phantoms on the big window would be sick
thank you markiplier for showing us the fnaf help wanted 2 exclusive gameplay
The biggest question is: will the KING of fnaf get early access too?
Theory for Matpat and Fuhnaf. Why is Moon here? They belong in the Pizzaplex, not Sister Location
What a great experience! Ty for sharing it with us! ❤
I realy want to know if glitchtrap is going to be in fnaf vr 2
Between the audio and Dawko's spastic gameplay, I'm at a loss as to what the objective of the first level was.
22:17 How the frick did that door open?!
I am hyped for help, wanted to. I'm very excited for you, and I'm excited for you to let's play on It.
feels like 2019 all over again🥲
I hope there's gonna be a Roxanne level as well!
That looks awsome
Thank you so much for sharing the gameplay footage. I’m so freaking excited for this game, and I’m happy you had a blast at Pax West.
that rockstar freddy looks like a render lol so trippy
I'm so hyped for the future fnaf games ahead
I’m so excited for the carousel level, it looks so fun
It looks so good fun and scary
It would seem that Dawko is FNaF's favourite son, wouldn't you guys agree?
Cool af ❤❤😂😂😂😂😂
I hope the Plush Babies are even harder in this one
Is it going to be coming out non vr like hw 1
My one dream..
E
Is it weird that I had a creepy dream about the pax west place but it was abandoned and the fnaf booth was especially creepy. Then I wake up and this is the first notification I see?
Hm. This makes the whole theory that moon and sun are way older than we think. Why is moon around what is obviously an older carousel? Hmmmmm
After the gameplay, you can see Mabel walking into the room
wow that was to amazing the quality is amazing its just so good💕
*UGREAAAHHH I WISH I HAD THE ABILITY TO DO STUFF LIKE THISS* 😫😭
I wasn't expecting Glamrock Freddy is in PAX and you can speak to him in 1:17.
I don’t think this game has any chance of running on the oculus quest two might have to upgrade to the Meta Quest 3 😢
So MOON is in this one... We first see him from security breach and isn't this one to reflect sister location?....hmmm.... Theories will be getting more interesting soon...☺
i don't have a vr sadly :(
Vanny kind of remind me of dark Vader from star wars if you can see from the back
Everyone there watching him play: tf is bro dude smokin
God bless all.
i wasn't there is it good thing?
Lets goooooooooooiii
😱😱😱
This makes me so happy to see! I'm stuck in the hospital right now and I'm in a lot of pain so I'm glad I get to see Dawko play this. I cant wait till the game releases so I can play it! I'm terrified of horror vr but this looks like so much fun! Lots of love to you Dawko and thank you steel wool for allowing everyone to see the demo!❤
helpy he will get his revenge. When he is Buff again…
steel wool casually falling down the stairs in the most goofy way possible, ruining the reputation of the fnaf franchise and then casually dropping an amazing DLC and a sequel to one of the best games in the series. its like security breach never even happened
you: - hitting every Helpi - Helpi I am so sorry.. D:   Helpi - keeps getting hit - Dawko why..? I've always been so nice to you.. D'x
Looks great! 😃🙌🏾 Just to think, alot of people were thinking FNAF was dying out after Security Breach 😆 Nah fam, *It's Only Getting Started!* 😎🤙🏾
1,569th comment
BTW I saw that door opening in the background…
incredibly proud to see how far regular sauce has gone. Its just insane
cant wait till it releases
We seriously need a whole FNaF con one of these days!
12:30 someone walks with Freddy’s head
the jumpscares look a little worse but man does this look awesome
It looks awesome!
Oh no wen i saw this i split my water everywhere
Oh, THAT’S what the moon guy was for :0, glad to see it get more utilization 🙌
The hype is definitely real
This already looks so good, I can’t wait to play. And I already feel like there is gonna be that one level that we all hate but can’t not love it
I was planning to go to play the demo, but it got canceled. My trip got canceled.
Of course dawko got a score of 83 on bonk a bon.
they reused the voices from the funtime freddy level :(
Interesting detail - Moon’s jumpscare (hitting you with his hand) is identical to The Mimic’s. Maybe I am right and this game is someone trapped in a program made by The Mimic, maybe even Cassie in the AR mask
Anyone else think Jtop looks like Dan Povenmire???
I thought Dawko would get the max points for hitting Helpy in Bonk-a-Bon ever since the... You know.
I have a feeling that Steel Wool is going to take over fnaf for Scott
Me casually watching Dwako gO bACk AgHHHhHhH Go BaCk!   Dwako keep up the Good work
" continue to go back to the hub !" " AHHHHH !!" 😂😂😂
Yes yes yes yes yes
Moon suckz balls
I love Dawko so much especially when he gets the opportunity’s like there
Es increíble lo bien que se ve el juego de moon
I love it how the people who work at this booth have fun scaring people
speed(watched on alt)
@DaRegularSauce is the GOAT
ik u were worried about the audio but it's pretty good imo all things considered lol very excited to see u play when it comes out ! 🎉✨
I’m glad the new minigames aren’t all “do this one thing correctly or instant death” like the first one. Hopefully there’ll be some randomization when it comes to solutions for the new minigames.
Hello just came from fusion
sorry dawkoo
Whats Ironic is I'm watching this latest video in YouTube VR
I love how Moon twitches when you shine your light on him just like the FNAC 3 monsters
Love how the Steelwool peeps have fun watching Dawko freak out playing the game :D
You can hear just shapes and beats in the background.
the music for the carousel is such a banger tbh
From the quality of the gameplay do you think it will be on psvr1?
12:31 If you look closely, Is that Movie Freddy's head?!
H Y P E
Ja! Help Wanted Two, going to be quite an experience for sure. Danke for sharing your playthrough, Keep It Up Bro 😎 👊
12:29 Ayo, what's with the Freddy head? (The doorway to the left)
Helpy did nothing wrong 😢
Seeing how great this game looks really shows just how much of blunder Security Breach was, and that Steel Wool can genuinely make a competent game when not given a massive open world. The FNAF franchise excels at the classic sit & survive format it started with, and getting more of that again finally is very welcome. I hope we continue to stay away from free roam for the time being.
Is there gonna be more mini games or just these
Incase people didn’t notice, there’s another MABEL ghost door moment. 😂😂😂
There was a feddy head in the back at 12 40
Can you hear that?   It sounds like Matpad screaming
lol that one person holding freddys head in the backround 12:30
I'm so glad they had daregularsauce walk around in his suits! He does such an incredible job making them and he does an incredible job of taking them that extra step further with his acting/movement. I absolutely love his work so much! Steel wool really knocked it out of the park with their booth this year! You can really see how much they care about the franchise. I think Scott definitely made the right choice with them. Sure sometimes there's bugs and glitches, but to be fair, what they've created in game is amazing, and they absolutely seem to be learning from past mistakes and people's valid criticisms and trying to do better each time they release something, which is admirable. You can see they put time effort and dedication into what they do
THE WACK-A-MOLE MINIGAME IS SO CLEVER!! I LOVE IT SO MUCHHH
I loved when freddy said you were in his way
Does anyone know if it'll be on meta quest at launch?
12:32 Freddy head in background
Looks very fun
He really is THE fnaf youtuber
Dawko rlly is the new king of fnaf tbh..
It was so amazing to meet you! Cant wait to hangout again 😊
Hopefully next year I'll be able to make it to PAX :(
Thank you Steel wool for letting Dawko post this and let us see some parts of the future project!!! I can't wait for Help Wanted 2!!!!🙌📢
Wouldn't it get kind of annoying to be jumpscared no matter what after every mini game?
Fnaf memes by like: Oh? So you are a fnaf fan?... Wen did the bite of 1987 happened?
This is so cool to see, the game is looking insane! Can't wait for the full playthrough! <3
Wait dawko you live in the UK right? That means you get the Fnaf movie two days earlier!
I dreamt of you last night, lol: we were at PAX and I was talking italian but you were replying in english...so I realized after a bit that you understood 🤣 it was so cool, I REALLY hope we could meet someday! ❤️
I love how you could see Dawko shaking like crazy XD
meanwhile: me being sad because i didnt get to go
It looks awsome, i played Help wanted 1 to 100% and i will do the Same to Help wanted 2. So exicted for the Release. And thank you for Hyping the community.
Dawko continuously murdering Helpy in Bonk-A-Bon 😭
I love seeing Dawko so happy and enjoying things, it's such good serotonin
Dawko foxy hi me fusion easter egg
9:51 that was mean😂 poor dawko
Hello dawko  You will meet your friends again are you happy? Hope you are   You will be welcome in hell yet again
LOOKS GOOD BRO LOL
It's sad that they don't have the gifts anymore
Seeing the breaker room level makes me think that there’s gonna be an entire Sister Location section where you play through the different levels of Sister Location. That would honestly go great with FNaF 4 Nights and Pizzeria Simulator nights.
Poor Moon was just trying to have a fun carousel ride 💔
Yo this is crazy 😮😮😮
I can't believe we finally got more footage of this game since the reveal trailer!
Ok I have a tiny theory. Carousel shows moon in a older esc pizzeria. Like I might be wrong but I swear there isn’t a carousel in security breach. So showing moon in an older looking location (more directly it looks like fnaf two in a sense) can help add to the theory of sun and moon being one of the original animatronics
Freddy's head at 12:31 XD
12:30
sick bruv
Love your reaction 😁
12:32 yo there was a guy in the background holding a freddy head
Yeah 🎉
The sequel to the best Fnaf game
Claim your 2 hour ticket here
FNAF should make a cover for the vr that's a Freddy mask like in the games.
I already love this more than security breach
Matpats probably taking notes rn
HELP WANTED 2 already CAME OUT
I absolutely LOVE THIS. I played the first Help Wanted game, bit to see how much more advanced these jumps cares and levels are absolutely TERRIFY me. I'm going to love this game!
I know him from pax west
Nice but why are they using the default unreal font for everything
Bonk-a-bon looks so genuinely cathartic
The game looks fantastic and i cant wait to watch all the fnaf tubers play. I think it would be neat if steelwool randomized the continue jumpscare though. Doing it for every continue i think youd probably get used to it. If its randomized though youll never know when to expect it. Help keep it fresh.
🐻 🐰 🐥 🦊. They look fire 🔥 🔥🔥
10:55 little mario sound
I wonder what the gliched arcade cabinet will be about🤔
Can someone please tell me whether it’ll be on the meta quest 2? I don’t see why it wouldn’t. It would be a huge shame and a waste of a game if it didnt. The PlayStation vr community is not very large comparatively. It should be on both.
I was having a seizure and bouncing off the walls at the moon level since moon is one of my favourite characters! It looks soooo cool im actually clawing my walls and galloping through the feilds im so exited!!!
Now I'm hyped for Help Wanted 2, the Carousel Repair level looks so good!  Especially the sound design.  The idea of Moon spinning around you, getting closer and closer is so scaryy
Yooooo
This was so fun to watch! The carousel level's gotta be my favorite with how chaotic it's gameplay and music is
I'm hyped for help wanted 2 and the movie.
Now this is epic
Did anyone else hear the scream at 15:37 ? Or is it just me? It sounded a lot like the Security Breach jumpscare noise, which makes sense considering the context.
I wanna see a parts and service with sun and moon and if you mess up sun will turn into moon. And for more parts a service ideas maybe security breach parts and service kinda like with Freddy in security breach but with more glamrocks
Moon is so terrifying in VR 😭👍
15:30 is the fnaf 2 carousel
IS IT OUT?!
Anyone else see Freddy’s head get carried away at 12:30
Someone toke freddys head while you were playing
I'm hoping the game comes out on oculus quest 2 also because I really want to play this, but not have to pay over $500 to just be able to on the PSVR2
What's your favourite fnaf character????
:V
why baby is there? like isnt that random... or is it a CLUE
at 12:31 in the vid some one walks by with fnaf movie head
BanBan Vr: Pancreas Wanted
Help Wanted 2 looks amazing, oml!
11:38 “Aw Helpy I’m sorry. Helpy I’m sorry!” Poor Helpy. 😢
dawko use the program the leavlator it helps up the lows and high sounds it fixed my audio so much glad to share this to you
freddt fab bear
I'm Vannyborn Vanny, I always have fun
❤❤❤
wait, since you went to PAX, have you played AntonBlast? It's a really cool game i hope you played it!
It is so dark LOL
Dude, Im so happy they included the daycare attendant ✨✨👍👍🎉🎉
Как же это ужасно выглядит... Мы всё потеряли...
Man I can’t wait for HW2 to release!
It looks super fun! :D
I know the game is sooooo amazing but anyone notice his door open a little for what looks like little Mable so cuteeeeee❤
This game looks 100x scarier than steel wools previous games, Its incredible to see steel wool  growing from a small development team to this grand Company carrying on Scott's legacy, Cant wait to play this.
I thought recording of the gameplay was strictly prohibited?
Dawko is basically the king of fnaf
Here before 50k
The carousel level looks so intense and fun.
Always fun to see early footage of games
OMG FNAF 10 GAMEPLAY!
Seeing Funtime Freddy in VR is something I am both excited for, but also kind of dreading 😅
28:46 start of some things ramping up I love the intense circus music xD
12:30 You can see William Afton stuffing a kid into an animatronic suit!!!
what an amazing livestream!
Wtf this game actually looks good
Fnaf help wanted 2 is so amazing!!
Helpy abuse
moon went from walking into walls to actually being scary
Wow!! That was I great video!! so excited for help wanted two!
I can’t wait to watch everyone play this!
Dawko is fnaf
0:50 I'm surprised they had the Help Wanted mask and not Vanny's mask. Then again, it was the mask used in Ruin so, yeah, looks cool!
FIIIIIIIINAAAAAAAALLYYYYYYYYY!1!1!1!1!1!
I wonder what the lore behind fnaf help wanted 2 is going to be 🤔
HOLY SHI- CRAP
I’m excited for help wanted 2. Also are you going to react to the little nightmares 3 trailer?
if the Android 17 and 18 comes then that means that 18 is the 1st female raider in breakers since we never had a female raider before and it will be good, just like Android 21 i was thinking about of it's not both Goku Black/Zamasu, and Android 17 and 18? :)
What keeps you motivated to make more videos?
GOAT
I wish I was there.
That’s amazing I can’t wait for its release!
Bro The Carousel looks so cool  I can’t wait to see the game I hope it comes out soon :)
I AM OVERWHELMINGLY EXCITED TO PLAY THIS GAME OMG  ALSO PLEASE STEELWOOL DO ANOTHER PAX EVENT FOR FNAF NEXT YEAR... ILL BE 18 NEXT YEAR SO I CAN ACTUALLY GO OMG PLEASE STEELWOOL I BEG I AM SO EXCITED FOR BONK A BON IM ACTUALLY CRYINGGGG I CANT WAITTT!!!!!!  THE CAROSEL OMG IM JUMPING UP AND DOWN IM SO HYPED FOR THIS GAME  YOU HAVE NO CLUEEE THE GRAPHICS ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE, AND THE GAMES ARE SO FUN AND UNIQUE !!!!!
Funny thing steelwool did see this vid
It’s fetty fatbear
Dawko you most likely fnaf guys from all fnaf youtube world for my i wana wish for you very long long life and your family thanks moms and your dad th they good people ❤❤❤
12:30  0_0
I am SO excited for Help Wanted 2! Thank you Dawko for this video and Steel Wool for the amazing game!
glad you had fun at pax! i hope the game's great! 💙💜
12:32 you can see a freddy head being carried
I’m so hoping to get more levels themed around Security Breach and it’s characters and maybe even RUIN but probably won’t happen and we’re probably going to just get the main game
FNAF is solved guys! Dawko is the mimic! 😂
“Bonk-a-Bon” sounds & looks fun… if I had a VR set I’d definitely play it.
That was just so AMAZING i loved that and Dawko is the Mimic confirmed
i loved the video in general but maybe buy a good like that one microphone if you do a vlog like this again
This is why dawko is amazing
They made the animaiton smoother and the game way scarier then HW1!
That carousel level is incredible looking! Hoping for more unique levels like this.
Dawko I’m happy you post so much, and I’m even more happy considering that I’ve had a very rough few days  Keep it up king 👑
FNAF sl noom Dawko lover glam rock Freddy oh Martin lover burn trap glam rock Freddy gregoey vs burn trap
Anyone got a timestamp when moon shows?
Dawko: That was freaking awesome I: The right words bro  I so exited i cant wait whole game and latsplay by Windy31 and Dawko i only can talk that really really cool bitch ❤❤️ Scott i love you
We’re %100 playing as Cassie’s dad I mean technician stuff? But if that’s true that means he has been to sister location to whatever clown place moons at and in the arcade with the bonk a bon.
Moondrop looks so cool
The way he excitedly hugged glam Freddy, I’m so envious
alguien q venga de la cuenta de tik tok?
Looks amazing so far I can't wait!!
12:31 gonna ignore the person carrying a Freddy head 😂
How is it possible that the fnaf community can eat this well in a short amount of time like this seems so unbelievable, especially in this day and age.   Can you believe that within all of this releasing the movie is literally a month and a half away too????!
I was really hoping for a full version of moon’s boss fight from sb in vr, but this is still really cool
ALL HAIL THE GOD OF FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDYS!
omg i forgot to ask the workers what headset is used for the demo but which headset is that???
I can't believe that was the first fnaf booth  These guys seemed so lovely lol
19:05 can’t wait to see this one in full
I happy because I got a glamrock freddy for Halloween and it's gameplay is crazy
GG games preparing a 2 hours analysis of this video: 🗿
i hope that Tiger Rock will be in the game…i really wanna see his model
Cool as flip
Dawko is one of the good examples to what the FNAF community should be about.  Enjoying the franchise, and being positive.    TheftKing and even Puggo's Pizzeria are the prime example of what FNAF isn’t about, and why we shouldn’t influence people like him.  Steel Wool made their mistakes, but seeing the FNAF booth at Pax, there’s no doubt Steel Wool are an amazing game company, and Scott made the right choice to have them involved with FNAF.  🙏😀👍
THE CAROUSEL MUSIC MIGHT BE THE SAME MUSIC WE HEAR IN THE MIMICS CHASE THEME
The team at Steel Wool Studios seem so nice!
Mark might be the king of fnaf but Dawko and John and MatPat and RyeToast are the Supreme Court
wiggling my fingers around
It has definitely been a wild ride seeing FNaF go from small inde game to having a booth at PAX.  Absolutely incredible!
I love how proud the team looks after watching dawko enjoying their game
Amazing man
Looks good
I still can't get over the fact that all in the same year we get Ruin, BASICALLY an entirely new fnaf game, a sequel to a certified VR classic, and of course...the moment we've all been waiting for...the movie
Do you know if it’s going to release on the oculus?
Dawko being so giddy for FNAF is the best thing! The gameplay looks so GOOD! I absolutely LOVE the first Help Wanted and really enjoy the VR. Cannot wait for the official release of the game!  Looking forward to play the game myself!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH WHAT
I would KILL to see parts of the pizza plex in vr
22:17 the door ghost makes another appearance.
Yo just saw SteelWool post your video! Absolutely stoked for this!
IT LOOKS SO GOOD HOLY HELL
Dawko is the best at making horror videos 😂😂
I cant wait for this game
Hey Dawko, did you here that there’s going to be a FNAF horror attraction at Universal at Horror Nights?
11:02 ptsd
this game was frickin cool
im so excited to play this it looks so fun!
Hope it's gets on qeust 2
The carousel is absolutely Stunning! The fact that everything is so smoothly animated along with the chaos at the end is incredible!
Dawko battington uploaded a new vhs
26:22 loreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!11!!!1 alright time to theorize 25 seconds after gameplay release.
Fnaf ranks(this is a joke)  Dawko: The President Mark: The King MatPat: the crazy professor Fusion: the gamer  I'll let you guys add more below
The whack a bon gamemode looks so fun
didnt they explicitly say "NO FILMING PERIOD"
wow only like a hour ago
12:32 is that a Freddy fazbear?
im here
Finally, someone who actually shows gameplay instead of clickbaiting their audience. Thanks dawko
Dawko is the godfather of fnaf
i loved this video
WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87??? sorry just reminiscing on how for this game has come.
Game looks fantastic. I hope they build upon what og help wanted was. I personally just want help Wanted 1 but with more unique levels, which is exactly what’s being shown off here. Additionally, I’d love to have smth like the tapes, where the lore was partially being revealed, which may be the case given there was a glitched arcade cabinet in the gameplay towards the end.
I can’t wait to play the game and poo my pants 500 times
The Moon flashing mechanic reminds me a lot of FNaC 3, especially how he sometimes moves around without going away, requiring you to move your light as well
Seems like steel wool experience  is really in VR games
If Markiplier is the King of FNaF, then Dawko is our Crown Prince
Dawko:  president  Markiplier: king of fnaf Matpat: historian
imagine carousel hard mode..
The Moon level looks like soooo much fun holy crap
Moon's jumpscare, slamming his fist down on your face, looks really similar to Mimic's 🤔
😍😍😍 AHHHHH I LOVE THIS SO MUCH I WANT TO GO 😍😍😍
😮am shocked I want to play
1:24 He hugged Glamrock Freddy :)❤
Day 3 of asking dawko for a custom hex plush
Cant wait for the game to come out
Thanks dawko :)
OMFGGGGGGG
Damn, man! How incredible!... Dawko being invited by STEELWOOL herself!!to test this game! How wonderful the game itself is also incredible!
Oh my God it's it's it's so beautiful❤
The circus looks so sick. I’m so excited for it
I love FNAF, especially, Glamrock Freddy! Dawko you're amazing as well.
I would not be surprised if Scott gives dawko full creative ownership of fnaf when Scott finally decides to give the reigns to someone else
Dawko holding the Freddy Talkie like a phone is adorable to me.
12:31 random freddy head but ok
Hi
YOOO THE EARS ON THE BONK A BON STATION .. I LOVE THIS
I'm really glad SteelWool made such a good impression! I really warmed up to fnaf SB and tbh I still prefer a realistic art style but the game was still very enjoyable(I loved how large it was)
yippee
I can't wait for the final game!
It looks like they retextured the models to look brand new
YESSSSsSSssSs
Moon!! I hope we’ll get to see Sun and Eclipse too 😁
Early
they need to do some security breach service levels where you have to repair glamrock animatronics and have to avoid those animatronics attacking you while you repair them and as an extra threat the endos, vanny, Wind-Up Music Men and the day-care attendant (moon). Honestly they would work perfectly and imagine a hard mode version of it themed around ruin (with M.X.E.S. and the mimic as extra extra threats PLUS the vanny mask playing an important part in completing the level creating absolute chaos).
then its comfirmed too that the player is a technician that fixes every thing and hops around between fnaf locations
The sister Location jingle makes me so happy
good job Dawko and you know what i mean right and question  what you think help wanted 2  one you just play and i hope u see this and i am a fan of yours Dawko if you want to read this or reply its up to you dude
Feels like 2019 again...
IM HYPED
WHAT
IT LOOKS SO GOOD DECEMBER IS 3 MONTHS AWAY
this... this is beautiful...
One thing I hope for in help wanted 2 is a mini game with the glamrock endos. Imagine having to constantly look behind you whilst being chased by animatronic endo skeletons in vr
You are the best YouTube channel in YouTube for me
It was so cool, loved the uh, uh, I wasn’t there, uh, fnaf
Very excited to play this on my PS5/PSVR2 later this year. Only played Help Wanted 1 in flat mode since i never got PSVR1, so i can’t wait
Wow that looked so good!  I can't wait until it comes out!
POV: flat mode players playing bonk a Bon 💀
Dawko 💜 FNAF Yes
what? moon in fnaf 2 location? sheesh eclipse is then confirmed to be a lot older
huuuhhh?
This Game Looks So Fun. I Cant Wait For When The Full Game Releases
Moon in the game? 👀
Legitimately and unironically great stuff!  Love seeing Steel Wool return to their roots with Help Wanted 2!  Seriously, everything looks and "feels" sharper this time around, like they've harnessed the darker, more metallic aspect of Sister Location, but combined it with the creepy carnival circus aesthetic that's going on, which lines up perfectly with Matpat and Fuhnaff's theories of following the Silver Eyes Book Trilogy for inspiration for this next story.  Seems like we'll be doing some more Sister Location Bunker exploration as well as some unique levels from Circus Baby's Pizza World! They can do so much with this! :D  The Carousel was also my favorite. The way Moon is both like a gremlin and a wraith, crawling on the different animal seats and screeching in "pain" when the light got shone on him was fantastic, and that only got better with the chaos and panic that increased as the ride got activated and would spin faster and faster until it got to completion, AND THEN you had to survive one final time with the music blaring and moon laughing! THAT WAS SO GOOD!
It was an absolute dream come true to meet you (Dawko) at PAX! Steel Wool did an outstanding job with their booth and bringing FNAF to life. I can't wait to see full gameplay of HW2 when it officially releases later this year!
Hi my name is Dawko, I'm here to sing a song to you. Cause this is the FNaF Show, where we do mainly interviews. So come on in! Come inside! No need to be terrified!
I really hope that this game wont be buggy at launch.
Who be playing jsab in the background of whack a bonnie?
This was surreal to watch live! I love the different minigames, and the graphics look so much better!
I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
That was fun
THAT WAS SO AWESOME
THE MIMIIIIIIIIC new villan
Help Wanted 2 was amazing also I saw you at pax dawko
E
DAWKO SAID MY NAME 😱😱😱😱😱
Союз нерушимый республик свободныхСплотила навеки Великая Русь.Да здравствует созданный волей народов,Единый, могучий Советский Союз!Славься, Отечество наше свободное,Дружбы народов единый оплот!Знамя
It's so cool to be able to see a sneak peek!! can't wait for Kellen to give me nightmares again ahah 😭
FNAF HELP WANTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Helpy returns
I’m so excited for this game, I hope it gets released on the quest 2/3 so I can get that head set
I love it so much and thank you for showing the game play of FNAF VR 2 I'm excited for the game to come out!
The graphics on this look amazing!
I was always thinking that we should get fnaf secruoty breach props like Fanny’s mask
Someone make a tier list of FNAF Youtubers
There were all amazing levels to showcase first, and I can't wait to try them out! This looks terrifying!
Can't wait to be able to play this myself! >u<  This makes me excited to see what's in store for some of the other levels!  And definitely going to have to see what was up with that glitchy arcade cabinet >u>  Was it... loooooore?!
27:40 Steel Wool Trolled Dawko 😂😂
Dawkins hits helpy in wack a bonbon buff helpy you’re so dead punk
Cant wait to experience moondrop in VR probably wont sleep for weeks on end but I will have fun nonetheless
Dawko when are you going to continue the fazbear frights series ?
my god that gameplay was insane… i cannot wait for hw2 to release! it looks like so much fun!
Was that all or is there more in the game
37791st
WOW.
Are we gonna talk about the giant Freddy face at 12:30
I swear Scott Crawfon is handing fnaf to dawko secretly 😂
Awesome video!!
37:37 : But do they work? (at 38:29 you can see a switch on the side)
Shirt with 2 stripes, brown hair, ladies and gentlemen, Gregory is… THE MIMIC!
I managed to catch the end of this when it premiered. I’m now currently watching it from the beginning.
To be honest i think Dawko will be next friend of scoot cawthon because he even met Steel Wools guys!
I'm so excited!!! So far it looks so amazing, I know we won't be let down!
That look amazing
LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAGLAG
Cant belive that dawko was the mimic all along
Dawko's "im Gregory" at the end is more lore for MatPat to solve, what a plot twist
Omg I'm so frickin' hyped for Help Wanted 2! It looks so amazing! I love the way they made the Breaker Room Level and Bonk-a-Bon and Carrusel seem so chaotic and stressfull I just can't wait to get stressed out by it XD
Y'know how Steel Wool made security breach help wanted 1-2, and how everyone's waiting for a Fredbear Family Diner game I think Steel Wool should be the to make it because they showed us they make good game so I think Steel Wool should be the one to do the honors to me a Fredbear Family Diner game.
Every theory about the mimic was wrong...  DAWKO IS THE MIMIC.  *Matpat has entered the chat*
*At **27:40** Dawko gets epically Pranked!*
Dawko, president of the fnaf community… 🐻🐰🐥🦊😊 and a inspiration to more people across the 🌎. 😊❤
I'm so excited for five nights at Freddy's help wanted 2 the animatronics look so good
I’m a simple woman. I see a DCA twin, I click.
FNaF HW 2 *easily* could be my new favorite fnaf game, wish I got the chance to go to the booth… hyped for the possibility of one next year tho ❤❤❤❤
i love u dawko im subscribed
Ily dawko
FINALLY SOME GAMEPLAY LETS GOOOO When is the game coming out
make way for the king 👑
Que humilde Dawko, mostrándonos la demo jugable de Help Wanted 2.
HW2 will probably be the best FNAF game to come out, compare to how HW was in the beginning and now Steel Wool has a bigger budget and bigger team, this will definitely be a great game 👍
I love that you can just hear and see in every bit of the video that he is full of pure excitement like a little kid.
Oh man, the gameplay looks SICK. I can't wait for it to come out!
32:30 THE FREDDY HEAD JUMPSCARE LMFAOOOOO
EARLY HELP WANTED TWO GAMEPLAYYYYYY WOOOOOOOOO VR GAMES ARE GOING TO BE PEAK THIS YEAR
So much hipe for HW2  Amazing video
Im so hyped for hw2! It looks great!
oh my god
FNAF Security Breach but instead of Vanny and Vanessa it's Lanny and Lewis LMAO (Also Dimic)
Everything looks great!! I'm super excited and the levels definitely seem more complex and unique.
36:22 the addition of the code from FNaF 3 just makes that prop much better!
The stream was amazing, it was great! Hope everyone had fun there too!
Dawko's stream was the best
THIS WAS AMAZING! The carousel level was exactly what I expected, Steel Wool did an amazing job!
thank you so much for sharing your experience with help wanted 2 and at PAX!! im really sad i couldn't go, but seeing you, steelwool employees and other fnaf youtubers have a great time makes up for it!! ♡

This was so cool to watch getting to see how far fnaf has come is amazing and im excited to see what’s next

Hey dawko I saw battington made a new fnaf vhs video please check that video out on the next video please😊😮🎉❤
I didn't know DaRegularSauce made all the props, i should have known by how amazing they looked
This is so terrifying, Steel Wool really looks like they put they heart and soul into this sequel! Especially Moon’s level, it’s so chaotic! I love it! Bravo for Lewis and Steel Wool! 🙌 (Also want to see how this affects the lore tbh.)
Yeah I'm so exited the video is nice!
This is the year of FNAF!!!
I'm excited for fnaf vr 2!
I want to see help wanted two! I am waiting for this game! , it looks really good so far, I hope they plan on making more games in HW2 It would be so cool!
I'm so excited for help wanted 2 !
Yeah true but y'all know Markiplier is and always has been the king of fnaf. Daeko is just as amazing and inspiring
2023, the year of fnaf, thank you steel wool, and of course thank you Scott.

I cant wait for dawko to play this fully. The game looks so cool im excited!!🐻
Hi Dawko. I hope you had fun there (which you definitely did, as i can see). I was wondering if you could play my roblox game.  Its pretty stupid to be honest but i want you to give it a try.
Hello dawko
Very nice
Cool
Does anyone know if the game is going to release on quest platforms like quest 2 pro and 3?
I love the part when Dawko got the irl jumpscare😭
THAT LOOKS AMAZING I LOVE TO SEE DAWKO PLAY THEM GLAD YOU HAD FUN !! 😁🫶
This was so cool, can't wait
Please do you know the release date I wanna know so bad🙏🙏🙏
Was lucky to catch the premiere of this video!  Amazing video Lewis. The game looks so chaotic, mad love to Steel Wool and all who helped at PAX ❤
Help Wanted 2 is peak I'm afraid
I bet the ost is going to be fire!
This was fun to watch!
HELP WANTED 2 LOOKS AMAZING AND FUN
What’s up I took a break
STEEL WOOL AND SCOTT COMENTING AT THE SAME TIME WAS EPIC LOL XD THIS WAS SO FUN !!
I can't wait for you to play it Dawko!
The game looks great, the gameplay seems satisfying, they always hit it out of the park
Moon's level is definitely my fav. So happy to see more of our favorite Daycare Attendants ! :DD

Steelwool outdid themselves with this, excited for the release!
Help Wanted 2 looks like such a good game! I hope it’s as good as the first!
This game looks so good, was debating making a video on it or not but it looks AMAZING! Thank you Dawko! 💙

Первый комментарий на русском
I have nothing else to say but holy moly! Help Wanted 2 has already blew my expectations away. All of the levels so far are absolutely incredible: the carousel level with The Daycare Attendant (Moon) has got to be one of my highlights for this game!  Anyways, I'm so happy that you are having fun at PAX West, and even for everybody that has got the chance to see the FNAF Booth over there! The whole team behind Steel Wool Studios, and daregularsauce, has done an incredible job on making the props and the FNAF Booth; as well with the OG Freddy Fazbear and Glamrock Freddy cosplay that daregularsauce has made!  Hope we'll see something like that in the near future with future events like this, and my god I'm so excited for Help Wanted 2!  As always, hope you are having a wonderful day Dawko!
WOW
Lol, that irl jumpscare tho😂
Dawko is some Fnaf god at this point
This looks so cool!~
Dawko is awesomely the best FNaF YouTuber of this community. I wonder we'll get to see more of Gltichtrap/Mimic1 again in HW2.
I really hope Toy Chica and Roxxane are there in VR, in some extras menu, not that I wanna take a deep look tho
The carousel is so incredible! All the details and the characters on the carousel and moondrop watching you from the shadows! It’s all so incredible! I have a feeling lots of people will love the carousel! Probably my favourite character on the carousel is fixed mangle/toy foxy because we don’t see toy foxy/ fixed mangle much!
Thank you for blessing us with this amazing gameplay!!!  🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛️🔲🟪⬛️🔲 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️ 🟪🟪⬛️⬛️⬛️🟪
So sick!
beans are tastey
I would like to point out that these all seem carnival themed. Seems like some if the theories may be onto something
Ayo?! How did he get the Game Too Early?
Cant wait to see mark play this
Ok. I saw the leaks in twitter (The descriptions of the levels, I mean) and seeing this in a gameplay is FREAKING COOL. We're lucky we've got that and I REALLY feel that they are taking care of the what the community wants, real well. Lets see how this turns out in the future, I trust in steelwool (Sorry if I have bad english, its not my native lenguage)
Yah me too
Hooray! I met you at PAX West Dawko and you signed my plushie! Do you remember me!? I was the one with the Chuck E. Cheese shirt. :) and also, Greatt video, Dawko! :)
Dawko is the goat
the one and only time I was able to sniff dawko in person without anyone seeing
Happy birthday
bro thinks he knows what is going on
They need to add FNAF 6
this is going to be terrifying
Is this live
Can I get 1k likes please        👇
One day Dawko will be king of fnaf 👑
Steel wool really did put a lot of love into this game so far, I'm really impressed! Even how they put the other characters that weren't in the first one
I didn't know you could comment during a live
in stead of hitting the  bon bon's we should of hit balloon boys so we could get our anger out.
@Dawko
I remember dying in that braker room so much when i played sister location
OMG
To rembe ri was here during this premiere
I’m excited to play this game. But I don’t know if it’s coming in the Help wanted 1 or not  But I’m confused but I’m excited for this
I think security breach was built over other FNAF locations FNAF 6 scraptrap William Freddy Fazbear Pizza place ect and all I think glitchtrap burntrap is William and possessed the blob to and mimic could be there own separate individual character and William burntrap glitchtrap have differences between the mimic Fazbear entertainment did that I think glitchtrap suit is possessed by William soul ghost.
Looks pretty good
Why is moon at fnaf 2
I hope dawko does a reaction to the FNAF MOVIE!!
Is it no longer live?!?!
wowowowowowowowow
yo this help wanted 2 is fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
How are you, Dawko? BTW I have fnaf help wanted.
I hope maybe there's an option to make the carrosell circuit board less obvious, so the minigame has more replayability.
This makes me so hyped
AAAAHHH THE VR IS SO COOL !!!! Love you Dawko !
NEXT GAMEPLAY!
fun
I'm waiting so much for the SB levels
It's so cool to see some actual gameplay before the games proper release, I'm so excited for help wanted 2. Congrats dawko
I would love if they put Pizzeria Simulator salvage minigames with some new mechanics
FNAF will be real in 5 minutes
This is an awesome video so far
The game looks great
Wow, Steel Wool answered our calls. A game where you can smack that annoying little crap Bon Bon in the face with a mallet like he deserves.
Premier gang
It Was INSANE !!!!!!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩
DID ENYONE SEE DAWKOS DOOR OPEN BECUASE MABLE
I hope that we will be able to play it normally without VR just like Help Wanted 1
THESE NEW MECHANICS!!!
Nice
24:15 MABLE

Hello

“ in life theres roblox”- kanya west
Just the thumbnail alone confirmed a speculation that I had on what kind of new content that Help Wanted 2 would have to make it unique from it's predecessor.  "Majora's Mask" (AKA "Moondrop") was among the scariest aspects of Security Breach, along with the "Weeping Angel" Endos
Wow the sequel of help wanted. But you still need to react battington’s new FNAF VHS Tape That released early today okay
Hi

Is it gonna be a live?!!!!
So proud of you WOW 😭💖 I'm so excited but I'm gonna watch it when I get back home, I'm at the cinema watching Oppenheimer thinking about a William Afton AU 💆🏻✨
I knew they would let just one person record it. Otherwise it’d be unfair to the people that couldn’t travel to Seattle.
Let's go Been Waiting For This For Ages
С днем русской водки!
Got my popcorn ready to witness this
LETS GO
Omg help wanted is back
Here we go boys
69 MINUTES :0

Dawko, you are a about to be a Fnaf legend!
OMG WHAT THE HECK!?
I'm so excited
YAY!!
this video boutta be elite + peak.
I can’t wait to see the daycare attendant in VR, the carousel level sounds so cool. I was hoping for a parts & services levels with them, but a whole new minigame is even better. Same for BonBon and the breaker room level.  Edit: that was awesome!!! Carousel definitely seems scary in VR, I can’t wait for it to come out fully!
Meu Deus!Finalmente tá vindo!
Oh boy! So excited!
I’m going to be gone today when this premiers because today is founders day for the town I live in e, and it goes till I think 1:00💀💀💀 it seriously had to happen while I’m gone!
YOOO if I had to guess this is gonna be ONLY the moon minigame
This moon model is so unreal I love it
Im so scared to see what people will do to moon in vr.....
OMG HELP WANTED 2
YOO
ayo what! Im ready!!
SHAKING AT THE TOP OF MY SEAT
Oh my god
Oh my god oh my god
I really hope there is a Minigame that resembles the Salvage minigame from FNaF 6,  It would be hilarious to sit next to a 8 foot animatronic and just sit there and wait to see  if It moves.. 💀
I can’t wait
Yes let’s go
It's peak
So, ya think he'll end up playing breaker room and bonk-a-bon, too? Also, i know this isn't clickbait. It's DAWKO.
It’s cool that we’re seeing the first hw2 official gameplay ever
GUYS WE WIIINNNN AGAIN WE WIIINNNNN (THIS IS THE YEAR OF FNAF)
When I found out Moon's going to be in Help Wanted 2 and knowing that's going to be Sister Location, I yelled "LOOOORRRREEEE!" Can't wait to see this new game!
I cannot wait
Omg
SO EXCITED HOLY HELL
Welp, I’m putting my bucket list on hold, this is gonna be amazing
HOLY HELL YES
Here before it happened 👇

This is going to be good I’m so excited
So if Daycare Attendant's gonna be in HW2, then will the glamrocks also be there?  I wanna see Monty in VR PLEASE-
OH MY GOD -
