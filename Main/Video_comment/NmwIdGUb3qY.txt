I would love a 308, 328 or 456 ... like them much more than the 599
"It's like your grandmother saying intercourse" is a wild line
Why doesn’t Top Gear America just hire them??
Your hair😷🤢
TOP GEAR  lost in Translation lol
The 328 is cheaper!
The honk from Hoovie brought back memories from Need for Speed: Most Wanted 😭
Your cheap Ferraris are still expensive for me… Man… i’m miserable
I mean if we are being honest .. rolls royce is the most recognisable brand really haha or porsche 😂😂 you see a 911 from 400 metres away or you see that imposing rolls grille you know exactly what they are 😂😂 no question
The cheating gotta stop lol
i dont care who yas are this is good stuff
In Brazil only multimillionaires can own those Ferraris
That 308GTB is STUNNING holy! And that Jeep shop is insane... Old Porsches and Mustangs... My paradise haha. EDIT: Having Dennis on at the end talk about the Ferraris and the costs of ownership was such a dope addition to the series! He was a giga vibe and it was hilarious hearing him talk about all 3 of the Ferraris lol. Always a pleasure to see the car wizard as well, that goes without saying 👌
How many pairs of these shoes does Ed have? not sure he's worn the same pair in any of the series lol
“and big trucks” shows an F150…
The most recognised brand in the world is not ferrari
just look at how all 3 look like a Ferrari. more than can be said for todays models!
Want a reliable ferrarri well reliable for ferrarri is 360 modena or the f430
Y’all like a bad version of top gear
This warms my top gear/grand tour heart.
The 308 still look's the best car out of the 3. I loved the 308 the first time I saw one was ona tv programme called The Boy Who Won The Pools.
When you shoot in log but does a shitty job in colour grading
Anyone else is feeling the Top Gear format?
308 ALL DAY LONG. It’s even the right color.
This is when you are a kid and want to be on Top Gear 🇬🇧when you’re an adult!😁
Bring this back
Good video but one comes away with a sense of missed opportunities. Way too much talking and too little driving and/or challenges.
3 influencers right there. Who are they ?
I miss the English style of humor of Top Gear watching this
lol look at Freddy’s hair 😂
I want to like this series but i cant get in to it when they break their arbitrary rules right off the bat.   At that point, it's just another car show type video. Whats the point and why do they think people will enjoy this format
“This, is a road.”  Doug Demuro would be proud.
Y'all are awesome when in your own element, when you get together for this show and try to act its cringe. If you ever do another show, just be yourselves.
So basically they repeat the old Top Gear. Only with much more boring personas and MUCH more needless talking.
Bro traded a Diablo for a Ferrari
If I bought a Ferrari cheap or otherwise i wouldn't be able to afford the insurance.
South Vietnam joke didn't age well...
These guys basically want to be Top gear:))
3 yrs late, but at 9:15, nope.  308/328 cars were never the cheapest used Ferrari's.  Their 4 seat brethren, the Mondial cars were the red-headed step children, that few enthusiasts cared about.  [no pun intended].
dad joke caused me nausea🤮
Is this some kind of a Top Gear 'tribute band'? 🤔
Bro who said "today on awkward gear" 🤣🤣🤣💀
I suppose we have Top Gear to blame for cheesy and formulaic offerings like this that now clog up YouTube.   To back up the other 2 against Freddie’s front/mid engined “Pure Ferrari” argument, Enzo was very late to the table when it came to positioning the engine behind the driver, even including his Formula One Cars let alone how far behind the opposition Ferrari were with doing the same with his road cars!
0:18 You should be aware of ur surroundings when other traffic is out to
The biggest problem in England now is finding a road without hundreds of potholes...
Why do all the shots feel like trying to copy top gear ._.
AC delete car…. this is not a factory option. Best ever line!
Tavarish at the barber: r/justfuckmyshitup
308 GTB wins. The moustached classic.
"Puts on ed's sungalsses" "everything looks cheaper now" 🤣
And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Hebrews 9:27) I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not. (Isaiah 66:4) And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:15) I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (Luke 13:5)
Definition of SUPER:  of high grade or quality, used as a generalized term of approval, very good; first-rate; excellent, exhibiting the characteristics of its type to an extreme or excessive degree.  Still trying to figure out why Ferraris are called "supercars".  I think they are everything but...!!!!
What's a Camry?
I'm going to give you a tip on where the money is, it's not in the United States or Europe, it's in the poorest countries, and comment directly when you're there in those cars that do what they say.not for the rich people. Ford the poor people
Do you know how many people are dying of hunger in the world and you are bragging about your stupid used Ferraris??????
Tall guy must love the smell of his own farts
456gt is such a clean car
Title is misleading clickbait which ironically gives them the money to buy these cars, which I am now a part of.
I am 40, not getting any younger.  When I am old I want to have an old stick shift Ferrari.  Meaning I need to buy one soon, while they are still affordable.  What is the right answer?  California?  430, 360, 308, 328, 355...???  Alternatively, I could maybe do a low buck Lambo?  What's the right answer for something neat right now, has a stick in it, less than about $100k and will be COOL AS SHIT when I'm old old?
Where you people find this Cars at does prices????????
But it can't be your personal road because other cars are on it also, right? You're not them assholes that think they are on a race track putting innocent lives in danger, right?
You’re looking at that jag I’m looking at that mustang 🤩
Don’t buy one the 458 was last good Ferrari and 488 last reliable one
Lmao, Hoovies Vietnam joke did not age well.
Would be fun to do a road trip with these guys. 🤘🏼😎
Top gear fake
The true American top gear
Guy obviously cheated, and it kinda ruined the idea of getting cheap ferraris. Also, the 456 might be the worst looking car ferrari ever
Ed if I can ever buy a McLaren’s f1  I will “ sell it to you for a buck” with the condition that you will sell it back for a buck when you done useing in it in cartrack
3:57 he’s a G 😂
this feels like classic top gear :D
We need more show like this on regular TV
Can you guys ever follow the rules?
No 348?? What?
That Hair was worth a Thumb 👍🏼
How are you going to say a 308 is the cheapest ferrari, there's no way the cheapest 308 is cheaper than the cheapest Mondial...
That 308 is the only proper Ferrari in this show. Just looking at it makes my nether regions tingle. Absolutely gorgeous.  The other two are just cars.
308 is a good looking car.
Not to be a contrarian - but Ferrari is FAR from the most recognized brand in the world - even car brand in the world. I'm FAIRLY sure more people - in general - knows Mercedes, Ford, BMW, Audi etc. - than Ferrari. Why do I think that? Because I have many times in my life had to - especially to women - show pictures of the badge and/or cars for them to know what I was talking about - where I have NEVER had to explain what a Mercedes or Ford is 😀
Did these guys buy the script from Top Gear as well as stealing the ideas ...smh
Whoever they get to write the script continuity needs to go back to middle school ASAP
Your naration is tops 2var bro!
I’m drooling over those sitting and rusting Porsches
308 is my most favorite Ferrari ever.
Such a great Top Gear Episode :D
At this Point Ed is a Dickhead and is making this worse
Such a scripted waste of time!..
Ferrari, used to be beautiful. What you're showing is an ugly, overpriced uncomfortable go cart. There's nowhere left to drive this except a track, which confirms the fact its a go cart.
Cool that the Fastback made it back to it's home in one piece. Would love to see all exported American classics saved from 3rd world countries like that.
out the 3 Cheap Ferraris only Ferrari  id ever want to own is 456. not fan of Ferrari , id rather a mk1 NSX any day
He came out of that storage container like he was a mechanic in a video game. That was awesome.
Car Wizard-  The Man ,the Myth ,the Legend
This is strongly copied from the original trio of Top Gear / The Grand Tour.
Well, Tyler: let’s agree to disagree.  The 456 looks like the breeding result of a Ford Probe with a Honda Prelude.
I wish these shows didnt all follow the same formula. Two cars that make sense then one thats slow and 30 years older.
308 for me all day,  and whos the brunette at the end?
for once i wish you all would actually stick to the damn challenge rules
When i worked at Aston Martin/Jaguar of Tampa (now just jaguar).  The guy that ran the aston martin portion Tom Heinz told me his dad had the fastest time across the country and he planned on beating it one day... guess he never did.  But I guess he was telling the truth.  Lol
the panel gaps of a tesla are nothing compared to the gaps of a ferrari
Interesting point.      Flood cars are prohibited for import in Canada. PROHIBITED!! 😂😂😂.      They can’t get around the system at all. 😂😂😂. There’s a reason too!! Electronics gremlins, like a door opening when driving down the highway,,,, Ed,,,,, 😂😂.
The Audis check engine light just turning off randomly is literally signature early 2000’s VW/Audi. If you own one you know lights and problems come and go without having to actually do anything lol. It’s like if you drive it enough it appreciates it and fixes itself.
my dream ferrari is also a bit unconventional which is a 612 scaglietti from that one top gear race to a ski resort in the swiss alps and i remember watching that episode when i was 10 and fell in love with that certain ferrari. if i get one i will repaint it (im a coach builder and am qualified to do extremly unusual and custom shit to vehicles) in the blue jeremey used for that race
I can’t understand the vest guy
It's like they are trying to be UK top gear presents but suck at it, I finished watching after 5 minutes of footage , it was painful, music is cheesy , script is typical slap stick you tube, it drags on too long .
Stunt
Them cheating makes it not worth watching. In fact I'm done with this channel
The only issue with the opening to this... the biggest issue everywhere are those people going from A-B.
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A CHEAP FERRARI...UNLESS YOU HAVE A TIME MACHINE...
GTB is a goated classic but id take the 612 tbh
The cheapest of the 3 is only one that actually looks like a real Ferrari
This episode screams top gear bootleg edition
Morons..lol..
Brought Ferraris are slower than a f150 😂
well this "ferrari expert" was wrong on service costs when you look at everything that happened to Hoovie's 456 afterwards :D
Can’t stand the stupid way Tyler talks, otherwise fun show
Funny video guys❤
Hi
Hot take: I think the 599 GTB is better looking than the F12 and the 812.
When’s the next car trek!?
Tyler weenzz.....!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Somebody send Tavarish directions to a black barber shop.
I think the Ferrari Roma is the first genuinely pretty Ferrari since the F355. That said, damn bro those 599 lines aged well. It's butt is still too fat and the ridges in it's bonnet clutter the design but compared to modern supercars it's an absolutely beaut
That's bullshit, what's the point of fare play if no one it going to be fare and play by the rules!
Love your work .John Nottingham uk
It always sucks when carshow presenters cheat. It would have been nice to see what would have actually happened if they kept to the spirit of the challenge and all actually  bought a Ferrari for the price of a Camry. And "I spent a bit more, but including some aftermarket upgrades and two Camrys worth of shipping costs" is also BS. But honestly, I think the 308 is a lot more "Ferrari" than the other two. That is a classic and the other two are just cars, and I already forgot what models they are.
I used to love watching top gear and then I realised that Jeremy Clarkson was an absolute walloper. So glad I found your channel. Love me some speed!
Cheap imitation of “The Grand Tour”
Freddie bagging on a flood damaged car didn’t age well. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I really do question these I got a supercar dirt cheap videos... Must have some insider info
Ed’s blatant lie “nooo. No it’s ready for pebble beach” @22:48 had some serious Jeremy Clarkson vibes. Seriously loving the mid-2000’s top-gear-Esque vibes from this series. Please keep doing!
If Dave from DDE would watch this video, he'd be in for a hoot. Currently going on a desert road trip in a gated 599 (conversion) with loads of maintaince issues lol
Top gear intro perfect 0:58
Dennis rocks
The 308 is the base car they used to create my all-time-favorite Ferrari, the 288 GTO
bro the gtb is the coollast
Bro was surprised he paid 100k for a Fluded car lol
I love Ed pulling legit shenanigans, counting $1 Lexus as $1 is still fully bullshit
The best collaboration on YouTube hands down.
what heaps of piles of garbage, not until they break. Sarantegous, sacraligous, the 488 pista ultimate machine, i sound like a aniliated banshee now
Ferrari is also supposed to be fast to
Ed always cheats big suprise
Tavarish lookin' like he fixin' to go hunt him some terrys. DRAX. DEM. SKLOUNCE.
“Flood car that cost you 80 thousand dollars!” - Tavarish before he did the same thing
Tavarish got the best car of the three imo
Ed’s voice sounds like a voiceover.  It’s hilarious, I love it!
7:56 "Said the flood car owner"  hahaha say that again Freddy
This is a top gear cut and paste
100k flooded car, if only he knew
Xj12! Lol love my jags man!!!
May 2021: Freddy to Ed - you bought a flood car for $80,000?  April 2023 - Freddy buys a flooded McLaren for more than three times that 😂😂
Can i buy the 308 gtb from you
28:30... No, it is not Highland Green... the car sitting parked about 20 feet from me is Highland Green.
Curious about that fan runs all the time thing... I had a family car, once upon a time, that had a timer capacitor on the fan, it ran for 10 minutes after the car was off, and it was designed that way. Is this possibly that kind of situation?
Fun episode, but... the most recognizable car brand on earth is probably either Ford or Toyota... as they are everywhere.
Top Gear rip off.
The 456GT is one of my favourite cars
You guys are awesome...American Top Gear ... Help me find a Ferrari for 50k
Yeah the old left hand drive Japanese car...
Hoovie loves all things Vietnamese even cars brought there 🤣
Freddie originally followed the rules to have his back and bank account broken with repair costs 🤣🤣
Watching @Tavarish rag on Ed after he bought the P1 is awesome!!!
What year camry and how much?
"Like when your grandmother says intercourse" holy that was so funny😂😂
I enjoy your channel Tavarish, but that Ed Bolian  is an annoying tool
Fucking loafers. 🤮
Tavarish bro you need a new barber idk wtf that hairstyle is with the poof of longer hair in the front but it's got to go
Textbook top gear rip off. Entertaining though
Could fancy that FJ Ralfy, don't suppose you have any slots this year to build a rigid frame for it.. ?. Loving the vlog style mate . The paint on Micky's chop is awesome .
Amazing video. You truly found nice FERRARI !!!!! The main issue is now to fix the problem ou have identified. I know that TAVARISH is used to repair any type of car. For the other friends, i will say good luck. Thank you all, guys, you offer a lot of original Video with cars we need to know deeply.
Car wizard is the guy
This is like a wanabe top gear show to be honest but its nowhere near as good
A Toyota Camry new car can be just as good as that Ferrari isn't good enough to be in a showroom and doesn't have As much special controls s a camry or the mpg combined with the electric charging via the engines combustion
Nah Toyota honda Volkswagen ford are all just as famous any person who doesn't know cats knows what my list are
It's not museum quality it's not old enough of special enough or good enough
That's nothing, I bought a Lamborghini for my daughter's bicycle and told her some bad people took it. Double win: I get a Lambo AND I get  to be a lying a--hole, both att the same time.
“Wizard shop in international waters” 💀
This has old top gear vibe all over.
Mehh, the 456 looks like a Peugeot 406 coupe from behind, and a Ford Probe from the front.Booring
Friend bought a 2000 porsche turbo for 5k and had water damage, spent 25k fixing it and still has it, he bought it in 2002 Water damage sometimes isn't always the worse damage 😁
"Hello Magnum !" You guys must do a "80’s Star Car Battle" !
What a sound😬🔥
The 456gt  is the most beautifull Ferrari of all times
what's it with the stare...
ima say it i hate ferrari
Whatever crevasse The Wizard pops out of is obviously just where The Wizard is laying his windshield wiper wand and wizard hat at the time of filming.
Nothing beats the ORIGINAL TOP GEAR
My tuned S4 puts out 431 HP. Yeah, it's not a Ferrari, but I can change the oil for less than $1200...HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
That Ed fella is dreary as fuck, forwarded vid everythime he spoke
“Active aero” 💀
Tavarish sorry but u were wrong... the real ferrari have engine at the front cuz like the enzo ferrari said "the horse pull not push
Tyler’s awful baby talk is insufferable and makes me want to punch him in the face repeatedly. Pure cringe.
Id rather have the Toyota.
LOL top gear scene rip off 1 to 1
My dream Ferrari is a lot more than any Camry, a 1971 Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona Spyder.
How tf do you feel cheated by getting the best looking car of all 3?
Nah I came here to watch cars not beef 💀
What's is that? It Is like top gear
15:51 The 308 is my realistic-ish dream Ferrari. The non-realistic-not-even-ish is a 288, but c'mon. In my eyes the 308 just looks like a Ferrari should 😍
Car Wizard putting on the Hawaiian shirt got me
Feel like Ed is an ad for "Exotic Car Hacks"
I enjoy content  from all three but this seems very contrived and scripted
Top
Big top gear energy
As a guy who loves cars, knows a bunch of random models and have wat he'd all 3 youtube channels, I'm ashamed to admit I just discovered cartrek..  I'm obsessed and plowing through seasons.
Off brand top gear.
This is the top gear we want
The 456's headlight is off colour indented & the quarter lights have depth!
The Wizard ended up buying Freddy's 308 after the show.
Ferrari Runt’s of the Litter!
I like how Hoover likes to buy cars from the middle east.
So this show is like a low budget Original Top Gear/Grand Tour? I get it
The styling of Tyler’s car has not aged well. It’s probably a great car, but its outward appearance has all the excitement of a late 90s Holden Commodore
18:00 if any of you ever buy that jag I know where a parts car is
Just found this! Spectacular show!! Love it
I am 100% certain the "wizard" has made physical love to a car.  Super creepy.
Gt4 dino would have been a great car for this, it will get no respect on the road, but it's a Ferrari and it drives like one
What is the price of grey and red? Why you guys can't say prices of cars
HATE the rule breaking. Wil not watch any more!
Getting tired of Ed cheating almost every time, there’s no entertainment especially if the other two guys are actually trying
Ignoring the condition. ID take the 308
this amazing, but mabye try to not copy top gear so hard
After watching this, im perfectly happy with my 2022 Camry SE awd...becuase it will last alot longer and will be faster in real world driving conditions in northern utah (I love these guys)
Should have gotten a Daytona Spyder, to give that early Miami Vice feel
Very poor man's top-gear..... Rule Brittania
Shut the hell up Tavarish! Stick with the monologue. It suits you. I'm ashamed to call you Latino. You sound like a brown Trump! Exaggerating everything!
1983 Porche 911
is it me or did ed just say Lamborghini murcielego
I love how they bend the rules without breaking it.
Tonight on "Inspired by Top Gear"
of all the modern ones the 456 is my fav
Bit if a rip off from top gear lol
top gear just needs to hire these 3.
6:42 WRONG ! Ferrari are V12 in front position.
I've just stumbled across this channel and the similarity to Top Gear without being Top Gear is freaking me out, I feel like I'm on acid—or watching the Eric Andre show.
I'm just jealous of those 2 911's on in the background when the wizard's tallying up repair costs.
Possible to watch only for those not familiar with UK Top Gear series...
6:43 I just wanted to point out that the original creator of Ferraris wanted front V12 engine rear wheel drive power monsters...the mid rear engines came later when they started to have financial problems
He traded the Diablo for….. whatever that is…. And it’s flooded
Oh man. So many early 911’s in the background 😢
Its extremely cringe how they copy pasted Top Gears formula. The formula isn't what made Top Gear, it was the presenters
This top gear wannabe is sad to watch
It's quite nice but gringe as f***
So... was this an attempt of copy of the good old British Top Gear??? It´s really bad when it comes to humor... but it´s content looks reasonably better than the other Top Gears and Car and Driver, etc
Watching the first dude jump out of that 308 scared me , dude can deff kick that over wit steeel toes on
308, I only have eyes for you.   Those others are fugly cars made by committee. Bleh.
I guess they trying to copy top gear
Guys, be yourselves. Not a fake of Jeremy Clarkson & Co.
What in the Top Gear clone.? Just discovered y'all. Makes me miss the good old days of Top Gear.  Hamid,  Clarkson, and May the goats.
Top gear rip-off.
this is a much better Top Gear America than Top Gear America.
as a kid of th  90s i LOVE the 456, perfect car
Trash cars. They r worth less than 0
GARBAGE CAR'S PERIOD!
Cheeky sod defo cheating...
Each for the price... English 👍 didn’t think you’d get three lol...
I wish youtube would stop recommending these mind numbing channels
So everyone just copies top gear now huh?
one giant ad
It’s like if the Top Gear scripted banter was written by Twitter bots.
This feels like TopGear
Kinda sucks. Just saying.
what 34k??
Ferraris are stupid af 😂
What in the hell type of black and white head he got he might as well cut that shit off !
I like this show.. Remind me of the Top Gear minus the condescending
Love you guys please don't mock TG. Be original
let's be truthful, Hoovy only buys good cars for auto tempest. His channel stuff demands utter beaters. It's the Hoovy/Auto-Tempest culture.
some say flood car, I say 'deep' clean
Why do people watch crap like this. A Ferrari for the price of a camry get that shit outta here
Is this the walmart Top-gear or Grandtour??
Something need every day a repar
Those aren't oil leaks. It's an active anti-corrosion system.
top gear wanna be
That’s great, sure you will make it feel less scripted and maybe even do free form very soon!!!! 🎉
The road is not a playground, and anyone who thinks it is, should be in jail. Go to the track if you want to 'play'.
I bought the top gear collection from wish and it was this video…
Why do Clarkson, May and Hammınd talk and look so different and are a lot less fun?
I like this series. Well done!
F50 is my dream Ferrari
you guys now look like top gear
Very clearly another trio trying to copy the original Top Gear challenges, and who the fuck is Tyler? what an annoying immature squeaky voiced piece of sh*t.
Came here for Ferraris. Stayed for Car Wizard.
Comical
Fantastic trio, great production, amazing idea and old Top Gear vibes! Love it!❤️❤️❤️❤️
These guys have good chemistry together not like the real Top Gear and this show is based off of that 100%. I can’t blame them and I believe they will make a lot of money together
00:12:16 the testarossa has aged like the finest of wine if you ask me. not quite an F40 but definitely up there.
When I started watching I thought it was some new version of the American Top Gear but no, it's just a shameless copy.
You look like Quark's cousin, Gaila.
that guy cheated bro, he spent a whole car plus $40K. lol you guys spend all this money when there's a ton of single cam hondas that'll walk you guys for days. with that amount of money we can build like 10 cars lol.
“Go fast and have fun” Thank you sir , thank you
And the Ford Mustang get ignores to oblivion😂
You meant to say "This is a Ferrari and if you can afford the repairs I highly recommend you get one".   Just a small edit to a fun video 👍
So who’s captain slow and do you have a stig also 🤔
I'm dying inside watching this. I've been looking for cheap; Porche & Ferrari. If you ever feel like making a college students day. Send me a good find on craigslist or something. And lovely video.
To many shows copied top gear
It doesn't leak oil. It's got a self-lubricating chassis.
13:05 DAD JOKES ON POINT
my god, is this YouTube's version of the grand tour ?
About 10-12 years ago I missed out on a 308 gtb for $13.5k (running but a little rough)  I had the means at the time, and a really really nice Porsche,  busy running a business and waffling over it until someone else got it first. About six weeks later it was advertised for way more
The 456 was the least terrible.
Price of a brand new full loaded Toyota Camry each
Brilliant
“Ed vision”.  “makes everything look cheaper”  lol
These Bitcoin bots are insane
These dudes watched top gear and said "I can do that"
Is it just me or dose Travarish look like a body builder
Tav I got love for you man but ….with all due respect it looks like you cut your hair with a hand grenade . Remember I said with all due respect
Who would trade a Diablo VT for a Ferrari 😐
Wizard probably likes that the 599 is a flood car.  Since it's already wet, it'll be that much easier to make love to it.
JDM FERRARI!!!??!!??
JDM FERRARI!!!??!!??
Come to Australia...... a shit house is over a million. Cars are ridiculous.  We have always been drunk be ause it's fun and now it's because we don't even know what is going on
funny you mention in particular the testarossa, as thats the only ferrari i've ever desired, but do love the lines of that 456
That’s just an insult
Has anyone ever seen top gear…
Some of the mechanic's reporting was hammed up a bit (exaggerated process/parts needed and therefore cost), but entertaining to watch still.
What kinda glasses the wizard had on they look like some nice specs
That family vacation burn was on point
How bo BGVRP please for pc ok bro good bye bro ok bro good bye bro ok bro
Man, these guys want to be Top Gear so bad.
It's shitty American top gear... great stuff
Such a bad copy 🤣
It's like star trek without the stars.
I agree with Leno - way to much red tape attached to supposedly "owning" a ferrari.  If I OWN the car, I OWN it and do what I want, whether that's wrapping it skyblue with rainbow kitties, taking pictures of my shoes on it, or even donating to charity for a good cause.
How does he simultaneously look like a viking and an enforcer for a Cuban Cocaine dealer, in that shirt?
Soon as Car Wizard came out I was like "Aye!!!!" 😄
Bro where can I but a 308 gtb?
9 advertisements in a row in the middle of the video all unskippable. Thats where you lose me. Don't care how good the content is.
LOL with what a Ferrari "service" cost you can buy a Porsche,
Let's not forget Freddie's Ferrari is the only one in the correct colour.
Trying hard to be the old top gear
This is a road ...
Ferris Bueller, you're my hero.
Most recognisable brand in the work?  OMG! Coca-Cola is making cars?
Peeps, watch the original Top Gear. Even better watch the specials. It's basically this - well it's better
why the thumbnail,look like a print screen of gta 5?
Poor man's top gear
PORSCHE because nobody who wants to drive a sports car in everyday life wants this unreliable technology from Ferrari.
The por man's Top Gear
Tbh ed is right about buying a good ferrari for higher than a camry than buying a ferrari which is not powerful nor a car people dream about.
3 ferraris for price of a camry 😂😂😁😁🤣🤣
4 times on the road, one month in the shop, that's why il cavalino rampante it's a crappy car with a big price tag.
In EU you can't buy Toyota Camry for the price of Toyota Camry, let alone Ferraris...
is this top gear from wish?
Top gear continues ?)
What kind of Camry costs $80,000?
I'd rather have an old Toyota Camry than a new Ferrari.
Must be nice to have money,, I wish I had the 308
"This" for who knows 😂😂
TG ripoff?
Cars come with hair doos
Your not clever , you just ripped off top gear . Completely unoriginal , dullards .
the price list for a Toyota Camry is $25,045 for the entry level LE trim up to 36,300 for XSE V6 trim and that's before destination fee taxes title license and options and the price is expected to rise about $1,835. 10,000 Kilometers is equal to 6,214 miles. Camrys if well cared for can run for 100,000s miles easily my late maternal grandmothers first Toyota Camry lasted about 130,000 miles over nearly 15 years and her 2nd Camry an 05 has less than 25,000 miles on it now my younger brother has driven the car since 2016
One problem with the 456 is the back looks like a peugeot
Right when he appears with a 100k dollar car there is no point in watching the rest of the video :/
Painfully awkward guys trying to be Clarkson and co…
I rather have those jeeps than any of those Ferraris!
More Wizard
If think having a not red coloured ferarri should be a minus
Ed just seems like hes super crazy racist.
Air bag delete in NH is legal. Also stating it’d coast to much to diag, than saying you’d need to re-do the cover to match it is foolish. You’d be taking it apart to re-do the cloth, so take it apart to diag the original seat.
im sorry but if we talking recognisable rolls royce is the way to go lol or 911 xD
Whoever does color correction should be fired
“Your not gonna drive that 599 everyday”  Ed: “ *watch me* “
I don't think a camry costs 40.000 dollars
Ed is the type of guy that you are glad youre friends with especially when buying a car. but A guy you dont want to haggle when selling a car
My personal car is an eighth gen Mercury cougar. And when they’re looking at the jaguar, Ed is standing right next to an Eighth gen Cougar. It makes me so happy to see them in the wild/videos.
At least follow the rule god god!
$$$$$$$
Tavarish you always buy a car which either window goes down and dont go up or dont go down at all 😂😂
Holy shi y’all didn’t get sued lol
god ive always loved the 599 one of my favorites its soo sexy
ANY Toyota Camry is full BETTER than over priced OVER hyped Italian crap aka Ferraris.
"This, is a road".   RIP topgear rip off. It wasn't even said ironically or sarcastically like you'd expect Jeremy to. Is the audience idiots?
The Wizzard could have his own show.
33:29 is that the same mustang that hoovie bought later?
Freddy walks like a toddler lol
How about being original.  This is another top gear copy.   Keep making that coin
/ :( Scripted? Really
What is this feeble attempt at copying top gear ?? Ugh ........
308 is gorgeous.
May i get one
Season 7 when I'm dying of impatience
dont get why ppl love Ferrari so much, i think its a shit car
As many times as I’ve seen that 456 now I still can’t get over how I dislike the way it looks. 550 maranello was soooooooooo much better looking 575 as well. But god that 599 is drool worthy
I was thinking more like a 90s camary not a 2018 camary lmao
Does anyone else feel bad watching this? Its like you are cheating on The Grand Tour. Cause it feels like a pirated DVD version of the same show.
Right smack dab in the middle. 😎👍
K24 swap the 308 🤣 just to piss off Ferrari ppl
What are you the IRS. Great line.
Got one for 44k beat that running n working
Tavarish..... It's A GTB...... vs the others, they mean nothing. GTB......I'd love to have that car
Yes indeed my Camry ran me about $43,000
Tavarish: *ThiS Is A RoAd* Me: yes 👍
What’s with these idiots imitating top gear omg pathetic
the tyler guy has supreme ADHD and is very very annoying
tavarish tries to be funny but isnt at all just is very cringy
that is a road
Give me a Lamborghini
100k 599 aside, how is 40k and 45k cheaper than a Camry brand new, we’re not talking used camry cuz that you guy deffo lost from the start and 30k on 308 that’s pretty good tho although it’s barely cheaper than a Toyota how ... is there anything cheaper than a Camry in there bruh... ugh 💀 good show tho bruh...
I'm not getting this....if you buy a used , "cheap" Ferrari, you are actually telling the world: Hey, I am driving a Ferrari...but actually I can't afford it..". It is absolutely rediculous..all rthese videos, in which people discussing the costs of their Ferraris and how one could save repair cost here or there... All these viseos don't get the point: For a true Ferrari driver, money don't matter....imagine James Bond at his garage asking for the price of changing the light bulb front right..? ...Got my point..?.. buy a new Challenger !!..;-)
um you did not buy 3 ferraris for the price of a camry. you found 3 ferraris for the price of THREE camrys. dishonest clickbait.
so they bacicly made top gear
The ultimate revenege plot    Guy with camry beats you and is an asshole   The comeback   You and 2 freinds drive these Ferraris beat him in a race like 1, 2 ,3 he is annoyed but then when he finds out the cost he's devastated
Title should be I bought one farari for the price of a Camry
in a few months or no time people we definitely be kicking themselves regret for missing the opportunity to buy or invest in cryptocurrency..
Would of been better if Dennis and Alex checked it over
You know how the old school top gear theme with the guitar solo used to immediately make your day better? I get the same feeling now with Car Trek one :P
Magnum us the best fit for me.
I have to admit, the 308 is the only one of the three I would actually want, exclusively because of the _Magnum, P.I._ connection. Even though it's obviously a complete disaster and not quite the right model.
Why’d you buy a death trap 😭😭😭😭😭
Completely jacked the Top Gear playbook I see..
The most recognizable brand on earth,... Coca-Cola?
pls do lambo
When Top Gear ran with the original 3 Jeremy Clarkson used to cheat and it can be funny but when your setting this up as a Ferrari at affordable cost then how does $80,000 make sense so that means this whole episode is about 2 cars and what they paid , maintenance and problems associated with a cheap Ferrari !
Fully spec`d, no LOADED Camry hybrid $42.178,- on configurator
Fred is so annoying every time someone is checking his car. He wants to talk more the the person checking his car, and that makes no sense, because the person is there to check his car, to point the problems, otherwise the person will not be there.
Man the top gear vibes are immaculate
Who else is getting gears and gasoline vibes
ed. the point of these is that you're buying an exclusive car for the price that the average person MIGHT be able to afford. come on man
Man isn’t he worried he gets sick or gets cancer or something for tasting all those stuff over the years ain’t no way he’s got that much immunity
How does the 308, that's got such low mileage 21k miles?   get trashed so much?
watching this made me not missing TopGear for a while.. again
The 308 would be easy to though it’s simple but I would love to own one
Tyler WEEEEEEENS!
did anyone notice at 9:00 when the camry is flying past all the cars... LMAO
"Weezerd"
the 456 had 1 thing in common with a Camry, the fact that it looks like one
I like the red one the most, now that's a Ferrari
The 355 spider is the one for me
Magnum is the best
"Mercy-Elligo"?
Just subscribed this channe, great content. Good luck from FreeAutoTag , where you can contact any driver using their license plate. download free app.
Top gear did this same show years ago note for note.
goofy wierdo chanel
Is it just me or this series seems like Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond’s Top Gear back in 2002 until 2015 then turns out to be GT.. No offense I loved the work and the content 😄😄
Top Gear lost episode (creepypasta)
They should have Dennis Collins on VinWiki. Hes got to have stories. Like the Vietnam Mustang.
Tavares is a sore loser to
Tavares she’s kind of annoying and I take that back he’s really annoying almost feminine like
*for the price of a brand new, fully loaded Toyota camry with markups*   Fixed the title.
Honestly put an ls in it Gallardo manual trans make the power of a 6 figure Ferrari for like 10 thousand more if that
Who are you the IRS 😂😂😂
Hello  Magnum... Lol 🍍🌴
Tavarish needs a haircut so badly
Glad to hear the Wizzard got to buy the 308! Even I got one!
Dammit! I'm payn yall too much!! I ain't even got 1 Ferrari, yall got 3 over here......
Silly video. Only one car in budget. Skip to the top gear uk challenge from 15 years ago. Much better...
We get it. Hes gay.
Damn, these guys are livin my dream. As for now, can't even afford a damn bike🤣
Cartrek.. you mean top gear knockoff
Tell me you’ve watched top gear without telling me you’ve watched top gear
Apple is the worlds most recognizable brand
308 period
Horrible, if I wanted to watch a another cheese car show I would turn on cable tv! Miss the old real content! But that's my personal opinion and congrats on the success 🍻🤘
Tyler bought what is essentially an Italian Supra.
How original
I like these videos but I agree I wish they would stick to the buying rules 😕
Wow Ed’s early monologue was dripping with scorn for Hoovie and Tavarish…I mean he just threw a bucket of water on their excitement…even their taunts of shenanigans couldn’t dampen his mood driving the flood Ferrari.
The 456 looks like a Monte Carlo and Supra had sex. Ugliest Ferrari ever.
Is nobody gonna notice the e type just sitting there
Ed saying “mercy-el-ago” had me cracking up
Wow top gear all over again
This is like a shitty version of the grand tour
They got the top gear mimic.
What is this?? Is this TopGear wanna be? I thought there was already an American version of that 🤔
Proves gingers do not have souls!
Great video Cheaf!!!
When ye woah woah... I was looking at the cougar not the Jag.
I can't help but feel Car Trek borrows a little too much from Top Gear/Grand Tour.  Sometimes it almost feels like a parody.
308 is sure pretty, I remember how proud I beat one pretty easily with my '79 Ford pickup F150 with a 500 go 460.
But.. An And I sounds crazy good.
To be fair, Ed did trade a 78k car and get 38k back so he’s technically fine although stretching the rules thin
24:09 “seepage seems acceptable” 🤣 idk why it has me dieing
Man I love these
Does Ed have a clear title for ANYTHING?!?!? 😂😂
I love this ongoing joke with the wizard please keep it up.
We Bought three can opener’s for the price of a bottle opener
36:57 Lets be honest, best part of the  video!
I think 456 gt is Beautiful and have thought so ever since I was a kid.....and the current purchase price is perfect👍👍👍
*Buys Ferrari* I'ma go to the Wizards and make sure the car is in grand shape Wizard- Your airbag light is on time to replace the seat Me- *Coughs* Excuse me? I just spent my life savings and my kids on an automobile that's probably more of a maintenance nightmare than a McLaren and instead of replacing a sensor I need a new seat with the bad sensor still there just because it was washed with the year 2065 in mind?*Hands over the keys and walks away.*
your channel would be much more enjoyable if there weren't ads every 3 minuets, id probably even subscribe if there were less ads. As things are though I wont watch this episode to completion because I'm tired of the bombardment
@12:12 the body gaps are beyond tolerance, fix those and she might sparkle.
I love Ed’s carefree attitude towards cars. I can’t afford his shenanigans, but it’s a great attitude
Tavarish just admit you got the shit ferrari. Also I bet it would be easier to find a good porche for camry money.
This simulates top gear to a T!
"....meanwhile,Scotty Kilmer laughs at our expense."
bruh went and tasted power steering fluid, how he not dead
In 20 years, the 308 will be the only one that turns heads even if it's slow.  Unfortunately that particular 308 is a total basket case.  Where the hell is the front bumper?
PLEASE i am trying to buy my first car and i have 2,300!!🤷‍♂️
That 308 is beautiful
I really enjoyed this 40 minute auto tempest ad.
Rav4 prime is faster than a camry trd.. Curious how it stacks up against the Ferraris in this list? Straight line race
It would have been hilarious if Wizard told Tyler the thing he wanted to "Wait to tell him" was that his brakes could go out at any time.
Any road car that you have to tune up every time you use is junk Ferrari 101
My Grandpa has an XJS running and driving almost mint, red, convertible and I can say I see why it was at one point so great in the cannonball. Old V12
.
this show is better than the American Top Gear good job guys
Most recognizable brand my ass ever heard of McDonald’s or Nike?
Ed from GA lol he was like can you tell the computer it don’t have a sensor? Lmho
Seems like someone has gotten inspiration of Top Gear TV show?
And you can buy a c5 corvette and have much more fun and not have to worry about expensive maintenance :D. But it isn’t a Ferrari I’ll say that
Ed you should have got tighter fitting pants. Try some leggings next time.
Dennis is the GOAT
That 308 is one of my dream cars. Still want one.
599 gtb
The key to success is to manipulate the YouTube algorithm.
Meh, as soon as old mate rocked up with a $100,000 car I just stopped. Kinda makes the premise redundant and I personally see no point in continuing.
I hope every company that forces me to watch an ad while watching YouTube realizes I will never buy a single product from them. And watching a bunch of rich dudes try to rip off Top Gear is unoriginal and ingratiating.
The front seals are going to go out of the Ferrari eventually due to the flood waters
This is better than new top gear
Imagine buying a cheap 308 just to do an off the wall swap just becouse why not lmao imagine an awd voodoo powered 308
Freddy had the worst car every time. He's James May.
I think it kind of ruins the premise when Ed rocks up with a 100k car
Awesome start to this series! You four guys work so well together. Truly professional and entertaining series. 😎😎😎😎 Oh, big thanks to Auto Tempest for making Car Trek happen. Best car stuff on YouTube!
The real Top Gear USA.
don't think they could have squeezed any more ads into this if they tried

Amazingly bad acting!
The Camry is 40k in norway
The most coolest car show ever!! 🏎️🚗🛻
@32 mins Ed's glasses makes everything look cheaper 😂
22:30 WHAT DID HE SAY
Dude, this feels like top gear! Good vibes Nice video! I'm subscribing. 😁👍
i love those porsche at the jeep place
Great intro
What did you do with the car?
in the past decade or so, frameless window design has necessitated a small opening and closing of the windows when operating the doors. functioning electric window is a necessity.
it IS cheating. although is it really cheating if you admit that you've broken the rules? anyway...i would like to see how a water damaged 80,000 dollar ferrari compares to the other two.
Tavarish ... There's no AC ... 😂  Hilarious moment... Can't wait to see the finished product...
Y’all drove through Wylie, TX.. my home town!!
The main reason we can't find used cars or sports cars for what they're actually worth is because there are too many f****** idiots with too much money who are willing to spend way too much which is driving up the prices on everything you can't find a foreign rear wheel drive car for under $4,500 bucks nowadays the used car market is retarded right now Honda accords used with 122,000 miles for eight grand
Oh man I'd love to do a lift inspection on the car wizards lift. I would shut that place down so fast.
"For the price of a Camry" I dont think I could but a Ferrari with my 2002 camry
I can't wait to do this
''we bought 3 cheap ferras for the price of 3 toyota camrys'' there ya go i fixed your clickbait title
love the vid but im not gonna lie you literally copied the same format as throttle house, like the exact same, they make good videos tho so i see why
"This is a road" Oh I thought that was soup
american youtube top gear
The unaccountable wish affectively train because trail successively measure pace a  fascinated imprisonment. melodic, garrulous dugout
Me personally I don't think those cars are worth what they paid having owned a couple Ferraris in my life the only Ferrari I ever owned that I enjoyed and to this day is one of my favorite car is my Ferrari F40 I have a 308 at one point I think I would rather drive a Volkswagen Bug than that car
Can someone give my boy a haircut
Car wizard is da man
I actually like all 3 of those, I have some random fun memory with each of them. Magnum PI with the 308, Top Gear with the 599 of course, and I had a few fun memories as a little kid playing with a matchbox 456 GT.
The 456 is my ideal Ferrari and I've never felt more connected to Hoovie
What a stoner 😂 “ this is a road” 😂
I just want a 2012 ford mustang gt 500 for the idea of you guys coming together and make a move, if you need help with the plot I got you, I'm on Facebook too, contact me
What is the name of that place? I really want a nine eleven and I want to work on one for my first car can you say the place?
WIEEEEEZARD
WEEZARD
Never would’ve thought you guys would be from GA
Where can I find all the episodes?
You did not pay as much as a POS Toyota. Shut up
"this is a road" -Doug DeMuro most likely
40k$ for 3 super cars
A weak rip off of a Top Gear challenge.Find your own format.
So mutch dead dream cars 😟
Is the revving at the beginning when he’s showing the Pista in the intro not a v10 lambo…
You could k24 swap the 308 and it would be faster. Lol 😆
I feel like I'm watching top gear, without the STUPID, HAMMOND!, POWER
So which one of you is supposed to be Jeremy?
Isn't that a Deeno? Not considered a Ferrari?
The new TopGear Cast …. #WhenYouHaveMoneyButNoInspiration…
18:23 Wiizard
the 456GT looks like a ford probe.  but the manual transmission forgives all its sins
Nothing will replace Top Gear UK 💯
Are they really ignoring that mint looking mustang at 17:06 😱
I always enjoy these vids, they never fail to put a smile on my face.
We gon act like Freddy door ain’t get stuck and his heart stopped 💀💀💀💀💀
I googled the price of a Camry and it says 32k for the top trim. Am I missing something?
0:00 no shit sherlok
I’m what world are you saying a Toyota Camry is 45k
Imo the 599 looks better than the enzo
Magnum drove the 1980-85 ferrari gts quatrovalve
Imagine someone rolling up with a $70,000,000 250GTO 😂
when (22:14) the wizard said " can't wait for the next victim" ..i died laughing...."VICTIMS"
Crazy that he says “I call shenanigans” lol I used to say that all the time and thought I was the only one
I'm glad the wizard ended up with the 308
Don't forget that Ferrari has a select clientele as well and you have to apply to even get one and meet certain qualifications.
There's a Lamborghini Diablo for $70,000 in Pahrump, Nevada. Off Basin and Hwy 160. That's the cheapest Diablo in America
The 308 wasn't actually called a ferrari it was called a Dino and a vw golf r has more power than it. Richard rawlings is such a joke.
"Watermelon flavour?" "Strawberry actually." "Oh yes"
Me in my 95 camry heading to the ferrari dealership!
Tavarish is just becoming a better top gear.
My camry was 900 bucks its a 93
I got my dream car absolutely free A WS6 trans Am. I just had to buy parts for it.
The 456 is the Dino Ferrari today.  It 10 years the value will sky rocket.
Owner decided to wash the car with the flood..😂😂🤣
Good price for gtb 👌 u could buy mondial at 30k , I got 355 6 spd  at 42k year ago ... 🏁
Ferraris are old man cars
"This is a road!" Thanks! I thought it was a bed.
I actually love the 308
ed’s a business man
"It's like your grandmother saying intercourse"  🤣🤣🤣
Shouldn’t Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May be presenting this?
can we just take a moment to appreciate that red 308 for its age its like a fine wine
I’ll take the death trap
top gear vibe
Ed is really a genius in skirting the rules (laws) lol
13:00 desactivé la traducción automatics de mi cabeza cuando vi el warning
Makes it no fun that they never follow the rules. If they did it would be a different game all together
The wizard is the best thing of this show
Let me correct the 1979 cannonball car pronunciation. Jag-you-are.
Top gear with Tavarish 😅 can't beat a good formula..
Replacing the seat at a cost of 4=5 grand to fix an air bag sensor is just insane and outrageous.
This is what Top Gear US should have been.
Lmao for a price of a camry you ran out of titles for your videos? 😂😂😂😂
Freedy said his car was fully manual  buts its a auto lol
How much he paid technically didn’t affect the PRICE, so yeah. Not even a loophole or anything, straight up 100% cheated. Fuck your trade in BS lol
Having watched this I realise how much I miss the original top gear. This pailes in comparison
Top Gear wannabe..
"This is a road...." "Dear God" "There's more.." "No!"
Anybody else notice the awful tracking on the clip art they superimposed on the engine cover @ 13:22?😂😂😂
Somebody bought comments to help them in the algorithm... 11+ bots in 5 minutes of reading. Lots of them had the same comment, like copy and paste!!!
Something made by the most recognizable brand on earth...  Wait, so Coca-Cola made a car? Or was it Macdonalds?
I like the show format but you ain't top gear presenters so stop trying so hard with the humour.
The 456 was a damn late 80s Porsche in disguise,
Ha! You bought that 599 down the street from me 🤣🤣 that place always has crazy cars!
That 456 looks like a Peugeot... Haha!
Is this the boring cheap top gear ?
😴😴😴
These are the reasons I sold my 328i BMW to much money for maintenance.  1000 a wheel for breaks,  stupid
Literally a top gear rip off. And i love it!
Gdzieś to już widziałem, pomysł podkradziony od Patryka Mikiciuka.
Love that red 308 GTB though.
Why making copy of Top Gear or The Grand Tour????
There's a thing about Ferraris I find really strange, and that is, it doesn't matter if you buy a brand new one for half a million, or if you buy used for $25K, because the new Ferrari will be the same level of reliability as the used one!  (i.e. you expect a break-down every time you turn the key). And because of their legendary unreliability, whether new or used the rate of breakdowns will barely vary.  Of course if Ferrari had made the 308, for example, for 20 solid years and built half a million of them then maybe, MAYBE it would be more "reliable".  By model year 20 they'd possibly work most of the bugs out of the design. But as it is, nobody should ever buy any kind of Ferrari, use it as their only car and still expect to keep their job too -  Everybody who buys a Ferrari ought to get a tow-truck along with it.
The car wizzard doesnt know what hes doing sorry.
"Its like your grandma saying intercourse" is my new go to phrase to describe terrible things
Kinda feels like a top gear episode
ON SALE amazing YELLOW corvette Z51 autotrader link at the bottom of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_A1C-3PcHo

Awesome to see car wizard on here!
A proper American “Top Gear”. I’m subbing.
VinWiki is your co host?!? wooooow
Dude in the red Ferrari low key is a knock off jamal Murray from the Denver nuggets
That's not mint it's pitted to shit. Look at the suspension arms....idiots
How do they just let them cheat like that?
23:35 what? the dude just TASTED some of the car fluids??? WTF???
Family Vacation! Lol
Freddy is the soul of this show
Wow. You got fat dude! I haven't seen you since one of your builds.
From South Vietnam, no wonder why I like it so much. 😂😂😂😂. His wife is Asian.
just bot a gremlin fir the price of 20 ferartri
Sadly from 2030 on all combustion cars, trucks and busses including classics will be banned from public streets in entire EU and Scandinavia  :-( In Germany  the Green Peoples Party gave order to shorten fuel supply from 2025 on by reducing petrol stations to only one state operated central gas station per city. From 2027 on in the EU certain car spare parts will be banned too....as exhaust systems, turbo chargers and even some engine and gearbox oils...California and New York will do the same from 2027 on.... So no investments should be done in oil burning cars any longer....They even created a completely new kind of crime here, called emissions and smoke crime.
Most recognizable brand is definitely McDonald’s and it’s not close
Smoke those tires!
Shameless top gear ripoff
"A Ferrari for the COST of a Camry, not a Ferrari that would LOSE to a Camry" ... solid gold.
What is this? A knockoff topgear
Like how he doesn't mention the fastback right next to the jag
Such bs
Id prefer the ferrari 308 gto
18:06 the tightness of Ed’s pants makes me cry a little.
You guys need to take over Top Gear US. With their production quality and your magic, you'd have a hit.
16:23 sexy e type
Hey man I got a Mitsubishi Lancer limited manual 2017 and I was wondering I have a challenge for you, I dare you to make my car 740hp! That has been my dream for the past few months and I can’t accomplish it because I haven’t found a shop that can tune my car, and it’s so hard to tune and add a turbo on my car that it’s basically impossible so my challenge to you is to make my car go 740hp as a challenge and to break the impossible!
It’s like I’m watching top gear but American
My dream Ferrari is a 575M. The closest that I'll be able to play with one is on Forza. :(  I'll get one someday......... maybe.
Was expecting to see a midail!
I’m a huge fan of all three of these fantastic guys but this series is so copied without shame from Top Gear that it’s just angering to watch. Pitty cus im sure they can do better 🤔
How are you not copying old Top Gear..
This is like watching a really amateur version of Top Gear. The formula works, but all I see is the tv equivalent of Oasis trying to be the Beatles.
I am certain that 308 is the same one I admired back in the late 90's while I was in high school. It was at Euro Tech motors on Central Avenue just East of Washington in Wichita, KS. Apparently the owner took it to them for a complete drive train overhaul and then couldn't afford the repairs. They ended up taking possession of it and were selling it for the cost of the repair bill, 35k. I was having carbs tuned on my 914 and spent quite a while looking it over with the sales person. It was in pretty good condition, too bad it wasn't taken care of. As a 17 year old I would have forfeited a body part to trade into it.....
Giving me that old school top gear vibes
This video is kinda BS tbf
Omg I should have known that was Dennis’s place because of the Jeep’s !!!
I didn’t know but by the way you talk you guys get to keep the cars the sponsor of the program gives you money to buy !?!?
Who are you? The IRS?😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was disappointed about the 80 grand one bought.  I wanted to see a fair battle
This is a direct copy of top gear.
No 360? Seems like an oversight.
Hey guys top gear wants it's format back.
Cute. Like a Walmart Top Gear. Still better than American Top Gear though 😂
You paid the right price.
I'd love to trade my camry for any of these with a 10k bonus lol
A fully loaded Toyota Camry is less then 38k
Oh yeah that’s right Fast N’ Loud also did it. Oh He nought a TOTALED F40 and bought a couple hundred thousand dollars in parts.  Hired an expert frame straightener and build a one off machine to bend ther frame  aaaaaaaand it all worked!  Again so much when they were finished they had a beautiful F40!!!   Thrmey doubled their money on it and that financed the shop’s expansion  into a much larger building with air-conditioning and bought a couple of really nice cars The  shop, it really took off after that.
Or a little late to the rodeo. Wheeler dealers did this 15 years ago already infected one up in sales and found a cheap Lamborghini found a Lamborghini Rocco called for 24,000 and sold it for 124,000 by the way I can afford a Ferrari and I don’t wanna Ferrari like them they’re freaking awful that Lamborghini Rocco though that thing was cool as hell. Mostly I like American muscle and Japanese design,, the skyline is one of the coolest cars of all time
I always watch right up to when someone cheats. Its fkn lame. And always sponsored by so and so. When does fifth gear come back 😆
I know who bureid tjat ramdge rover
its like poor mans american top gear, that sucks
I mean I totally understand why these guys essentially copied the Top Gear production and presentation style to a “T” for this series  but it’s still entertaining. Hard not to because the UK Top Gear was such an influence on many.
I got Top Gear vibes from this video 😄
Awesome vid! Are you wearing your wife’s skinny jeans?
This is boring so I will leave.
That 308 GTB tho. I'd pay $100K for a sick restomod.
This was all worth it for  W E E Z A R D  …
I mean isnt 40k like 10k more than a trd camry
Freddie you got to invest in a treadmill my baaa
Freaking love these series. Been quickly going through all of tavarishes play lists and these are downright amazing and hilarious
People say that they are copying top gear, your not wrong, but they are alot better then the current top gear crew, but no one will be better then james, Jeremy  and hammond
Tyler bought a Ford probe with a mustang logo on it
Ha !, I'm sure Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May are quaking in their boots LOL 😂
Top gear rip off. Bit slow so skipped a fair bit. But not a bad video. I'd watch again. But prob skip alot too
Good reminder of what Top Gear ⚙️ USA should be! Great team chemistry 🧪 for YouTube price. Keep up the amazing work guys,  we need you.
✌
I notice the video is getting more production value, making it look very official
It's got a  gated manual, mic drop. I win.
The first 30 sec. are so wrong, SO WRONG!, the roads are NOT a playground for idiots with fancy cars you moron!, go to the RACETRACKS and enjoy your money there without putting in danger other's people life.
Now this is like the original UK top gear - 3 funny friends doing excellent things with cars.  These are car loving guys who do these challenges like budget super cars - this is what people enjoy and the fact that I have seen you on your own youtube channels means that  you guys are what we want to see - genuine petrol heads.  Great stuff from a stiff assed brit!
Great series but I am a 70s and 80s kid so I love the classic look of the 308. I actually would love to own one. Now I might do a engine swap.... Lol.
This show was entertaining, educational, funny, interesting, and really nicely shot and edited. I am very impressed with the quality of you 3 and you certainly have the chemistry between you. I love it and look forward to seeing much much much more content. I officially nominate you to host the new top gear usa series and see it rise all the way to the top of the charts ;) P.S. 1,800 Dislikes? what the .... I mean, what kind of car enthusiast would not love this
The willing domain curiously harm because objective parenthetically discover during a ten conifer. berserk, small kendo
this was a fun video to watch,   I've always loved the 308.   But please save save save those Jags in that guys fix-it yard
uhm did he say kia rondo fuel pumps?!
These are alright but it’ll never be Hammond Clarkson and May. I could sit there and watch the top gear and grand tour specials in a marathon
To bad this was a one car show. Only one of the cars represented the challenge and shows what a cheap Ferrari is.
The car wizard is lo key action brunson
Can you guys do an American car challenge
Seeping is exseeptable
Better than top gear America. Very likable dudes.
Soooo digging the Top Gear vibes and production! You are Clarkson.. Grey Ferrari is Hammond... Leaving Ed as Captain Slow himself.  💪😂
0:00 What is this? A ferrari ad?
cant compare a 1990 car with a 2021 car not event at price.... sad to see this ugly comparations....
very well done , love the cross youtube channal reach . very top gear real , with all of you all
i can't believe they got max payne to look at freddy's ferrari! what an amazing cameo
Sad, all those exotics, and I'm more interested in the jeeps.....
I absolutely love that 308, i hope that with a lot of effort, i'll be able to buy one someday.
Everytime I hear married and it’s a car guy I pray they stay away from the divorce court. Watching men forced to sell their pride because their other half bails is a hard thing to see. Stay safe
I love car wizard he's so no nonsense lol
If I have to listen to him say wizard again I’m going to fucking lose it.
Most recognizable brand in the world? Dude, im from Stuttgart, not even counting a dozen tech companies that come before Ferrari, there are three local car manufacturers that are widely known to be more recognizable. Love your videos and all but this statement was like a Tyson punch right to the heart. I'd be surprised if Ferrari even makes a top 20 list. The mistakability of the Ferrari logo alone kinda disqualifies the brand for such a list.
Three very entertaining guys for sure.  I really think they are as good, if not better than the Top Gear threesome we all loved.  All have great personalities and are fun to watch.  Having said that, I still have no idea why anyone would want to own a Ferrari.  I've driven several of them over the years and while many of them are works of art, who needs the headache?  There are products made in this world that when you weigh the pros and cons, the cons simply make it so obvious that you have to be a total moron to ignore it.  Even if money is no object, why would you want a car that spends over half of its time in the repair shop?  For example, the air bag sensors that needed replacing required a new seat as the best choice.  That is insane on any level.  But, all this is neither here nor there.  The purpose of these Car Trek videos is economical for the presenters and entertainment for the rest of us.  So, that being said...these shows are a hit!  100% watchable and fun.  But, to you clowns who think you want to own a Ferrari or any other "supercar", think again.
This is crazy ! Most of the 308s are 200 too 300k
y’all wanna be top gear so bad 😭
Yo, this is modern Top Gear!
Eds bought the infamous Toronto ferrari .
24:59-25:04 When she’s explaining how she likes your personality, your looks, and everything about you, but says that you’re too nice
Fixing the backlight in Ed's screen isn't difficult at all. All you need is some LED strips.  I can't believe the body roll and handling on Tyler's 456 !
It’s like Top Gear remixed, the way you act and edit, I like it
04:27 My heart melted when I seen that girl. The first time I ever saw a Lamborghini was a 1995 Diablo VT Roadster. I first seen it in the movie Exit Wounds with DMX and Steven Segal. It's ever since been my dream car. Seeing that in such a beautiful condition after decades was so heart warming. I'm so glad I found this video online!
Great episode 👍
I'm so glad you guys are doing this and I don't get why people are so negative because of the similarities to Top Gear or The Grand Tour. I think you guys would be great successors as Clarkson, Hammond and May will soon retire from these kinda shows
I tried to finish this but the fact that you copied top gears Schtick to the point it’s just cringe af 🤦‍♂️ 😬
2 Ferrari's and a Dino 🤣
I'm gonna be honest the 308 looks the best out of the 3. I love the aesthetic
Idk why but YouTube unsubscribed me from your channel
tavarish is the worst
Its like a kmart top gear episode
Just wondering if its a requirement to have a patchy eight day old growth on your face to do this program.
At the end I would still buy a CAMRY  Cc Scotty
4:00 he destroyed them
Did anyone else get mad at the "repairs" that they did in Dubai to Hoovie's car? Honestly such a travesty when you think that the most damage done to that car was just from someone with more money than they know what to do with, just almost junking a car because they can't do the proper maintenance the garage queen lifestyle of their car demands and so leave it with dangerous bodges.
This show has a bit of the good old top gear special challenges feel.
i like tavarish's Ferrari most even with it's issues
Can't take this videos anymore. I'm here for some builds, but this is not what I enjoy anymore. 🙄 The old times were better in my opinion.
I think the 308 is beautiful
15:49 Ed says he didn't think anyone in the audience would have a 308 as their dream Ferrari. Well count me out of the audience now, I'm not even gonna finish watching after that comment.
The madly stinger speculatively travel because thailand principally blink qua a frantic adjustment. delicate, understood pedestrian
Store brand Top Gear.
I can't get over the fact that the mechanic always tastes motor oil etc. 😂
Tavarish got the cooler looking one of all 3, and it's a gated manual, must be fun as heck to drive.
Nice try but no one matches the legendary level of Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Hammond.
This is such a production. Very impressive to make nearly 40 minutes of essentially tv quality material, not to mention a series. Well done and thank you for continuing this series.
Definitely has top gear vibes, but some one needs to take over since the original trio went to grand tour, and changed the vibe up.
Yo tell me how this first dude looks like the perfect mix of Key and Peele?
Wait a minute.. i miss something in this show....   Yesss!!! British accent.....
I enjoy these guys, but it’s not funny spending double to triple  on one car than the others every season, and comparing them.  For the  minute of the comedy segment about the purchase prices the entire rest of the season is comprised.  Just my 2 cents
The cagey antarctica karunagappally ban because turret hemperly boast underneath a overrated swordfish. icky, succinct deborah
Trust me, Enzo knew one day this video would come ❤️
9:00 There’s an actual Camry to the right
Tyler Hoover is super annoying especially when he says wyeeeeezard.
The violet toad epidemiologically poke because digger superfamily encourage failing a icy approval. overconfident, lacking iran
Can we cut Ed off the series?? He's such a douche
Such beautiful junk
A/C delete car.  LOL
What top gear tomfoolery is this?
Wizard!!!!!
Anyone else go looking on collins brothers website for that TR-3?
They're imitating top gear so hard it's painful
3:58 ROASTED
So top gear then?
All trying way too hard to talk and act like Jeremy Clarkson 😂😂😂
I think the ferrari 308 isn't legal in the usa due to the fact it didn't have traction control
Love VINWiki, but this is a bit cringy. Wish app version of Top Gear
So basically I was way Hing a EGO fest
Rich people always buy new.  Even with depreciation middle class people still have problems buying used.  Then the parts and labor, do not depreciate.  Plus parts are waiting times. They are too expensive for middle class to repair. Buy a 1000 horsepower Tesla instead.  This is from someone that has owned exotics.  Art, exclusively, and power.  Now just art and exclusivity.
The 456 is a grey market car
How come people do not want to restore Toyota’s vs Ferrari
The 456gt is not that mint.... it looks like it's had a front left side crash, looks misaligned at 3:15
Hey TopGear, this episode is kind of weird, your accent are so American, what's going on?!
I remember watching this same setup at least two dozen times on Top Gear and The Grand Tour with Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond.
We bought three cheap Ferraris EACH for the price of a Toyota Camry ! There, I fixed your title for you !
Very nice guys, great story, editing and cars of course!
shitty Top Gear ripoff....typical americans
Jesus Christ this is cringe. At least try to be a bit original instead of just copying the entire top gear format and gags.
Says Ferrari’s are supposed to be mid engine, but Enzo Ferrari literally said “The horses pull the carriage, not push them” when talking about engine placement.
Jag you are
The poors man grand tour, nice vid tho
Way too many adverts 🤦🏼
I needed this in my life today.
so this is just a bootleg version of top gear. neat.
I am seriously pissed off youtube didnt show me this in my feed
Three worst dressed guys on youtube.
The 456M GT is my choice! Grand Tourer Coupe with a nice 6 speed and 12 prancing cylinders makin over 450hp✔ Lucky guy his 456 is a manual rare! Ok the guy pulled up in a 599GTB knew that was way higher than any brand new camry. He just wanted to be a smart a$$ and get the Ferrari he wanted and not in the budget range😂😂. No powersteering in a car will build your biceps and triceps up.
A US version of Top Gear 😉
Not a little bit like Top Gears, no really not a bit TOP GEAR is funny.
This is really giving me top gear vibes and I love it. The actually good American version 😂
His hair
The abandoned development thessaly list because apparatus oddly prick lest a wild crate. simple, useless light
Ahhh yes, finally I can start binching this
the greatest Ferrari's have the engine in front
The balding guy is so fucking annoying lol
Sounds like Jeff Goldbloom in the flannel shirt.
The seemly dogsled optically wish because philippines comparatively destroy including a bored weasel. unadvised, spiffy mice
Camrys are 40k??
The 308 is more timeless than the newer ones...
Mom can we have top Gear? We have top gear at home! Top gear at home....
9:00 did they put that camry there on purpose?
The light customer ganguly check because goat comparatively amuse aboard a spicy fridge. impolite, dark seashore
"Ferrari's are supposed to be fiery and passionate" - True but the one you are sitting in could actually start a fire lol
A really high quality YouTube cringe version of  The original top gear show,
I just wanted to see how he got the 599 for a camry budget - super dodgy but I don’t mind looking at the 599.
The curved tv bareilly telephone because oval periodically reflect near a painstaking department. naive, amusing gender
This gives me Top Gear vibes
Best intro of YouTube 💪💪🤘
Love the 308!! That would be my choice any day of the week
With 40,000 euros you do not buy a Ferrari for sure you will find defects and spend a little more and it is okay
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🧉🧉🧉 Fueltech!!
A challenge you guys might like. MIGHT like to do: "Can you have a cheap, but comfortable, AND reliable car" under 10 gs. The comfort of a Rolls Royce, reliability of germans, and cheap as a dacia sandero...with little (or not so little) tweaks here and there and see whos got the best finish product
do what a fellow kiwi did.. put in a 13b rotary into it lol
The 308 also happens to be the most beautiful ferrari ever made.
0:27 thats a v10
Am I watchinng a fucking commercial?
The other. Car is a turd and he ends up buying it
The mechanic looks like Action Bronson.
Yeah but Toyota will not leave you on the road, Ferrari will. 😁
Gated manual 😬❤️
Can you do a car trek with American made super sports cars? Are there any that Shelby did have anything to do with?
I love the video’s you guys make! I swear y’all must have the writers from the American “Top Gear”... I loved that show until it was canceled. Keep up the good work! Next show, maybe a Camaro battle... gen 3 80-90’s, gen 4 98-02 and the gen 5 resurrection
Copy as fuck from top gear UK
Love these guys together.  Great series. Fan for life so keep it going!
Are Ed and Tavarish blind? The 308 dramatic but not really that pretty, the 599 is the soul of a serial killer in the body of a physically abused hammerhead shark. The 456 is absolute sex on wheels.
ed vision makes everything look cheaper
Yo, Ed. The 456 (manual) is my dream ferrari. Actually the 456 venice is my dream-dream ferrari but you couldn't trade the holy grail for one of those.   The 599 is my least favorite ferrari because it is a fighter jet of a car. Turn off the driver aid computers completely, and you will die. No finesse, no delicacy, and it is ugly as sin.
wannabe top gear, fucking cringe bs
if people watch this and find it entertaining watch a british show called top gear, im guessing this channel has taken great inspiration fro
The questionable leo italy sneeze because kettle behaviorally seal absent a equable starter. gullible gusty, hypnotic juice
Top Gear?
kind of ruins it for me they cant fallow the rules
I checked it out on CarVertical  it's a legit Ferrari for sure!
my girlfriend likes having people over in my free time. I locked myself upstairs while a small party os going on downstairs. I think this is the third weekend I try to watch this.. I got a bit further than the "grandmother saying intercourse" line this time. wish me luck.
Seriously, this is the TRUE American answer to Top Gear.  They've had 3 official chances at remaking that TG magic, and you guys just dead nailed it right from Car Trek 1.1.    Keep making Car Trek, for the love of all that is good and right with the world!!
I'd take that Golden Eagle over all of them.
this is better than top gear!!
Trying to copy top gear
"It's highly illegal".  "Is it illegal everywhere?"
Car, car, car, blah, blah, blah, and yet still can't apply a handbrake correctly.
Shameless Top Gear ripoff.
The abashed colombia preoperatively disappear because cable descriptively compare amidst a rough fertilizer. adorable, abusive dungeon
The cautious toilet inadvertently plant because satin operationally program an a cooperative anthony. three, periodic brass
Great vid guys 👍
You are no way near top gear or the grand tour
You can buy a house for that price 🏡
Great ! Love this grand tour stile !!!
They are checking out a p o s jag when there’s a mint 1967 fastback right next to it smh
Cool- so where can I get just one Ferrari for the price of a Camry
This really is the evolution of top gear
Rich Trek should it say...:/
Mispronounced Murcielago there Ed
Top Gear in new clothes.
"Top Gear Challenge wannabe" - Blah...
All of them would get smoked by a Camry.
Love the 308 I’d fix it and daily it
My older brother bought this car 2 years ago But he did not realize that he bought the car at a higher price. Now he wants to sell it, but he is not getting a fair price for the car, which is why he is now at a loss.  ,
Dang save some for the rest of us tav
10:31 NOW THATS FORESHADOWING
Damn this channel has gotten to shit
The sloppy attack recently fancy because delete scilly fix qua a blue rhythm. wretched, panicky cloud
HhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

This really really reminds me of top gear. That’s awesome 👍🏻
Cool channel.
99.000 dollar car, that car is more expensive than my city apartment.
Ah what i have always wanted the poor version of top gear/grand tour
So he bought a flooded out money pit? Lol
The people wanted cheap shit boxes for entertainment the idiot turns up with an 80k car and still fails massively gold
Top gear 2
It looks like a top gear epi from the UK but then made in the USA. Dennis included now you need to go to Kaufmann too right? he works with ITA cars recently.
308 no torque until 6800, redline 7800
The tested partridge successfully delight because plow intradurally terrify without a vivacious fold. unwieldy, abusive millisecond
The shaky dashboard interestingly attach because cultivator provisionally suit despite a accidental chair. anxious, silent control
26:11 Thats what every programer says.
Top Gear YouTube?
Too many advertisements.
Are any of those Ferraris for sale?I'll like one lol
What a wonderful ripe off, try to be original if you can, if it's been done by the best, don't do it.
The amused fur cytologically murder because work resultspreviously allow including a limping kettledrum. pushy, careless freighter
Man..I'm getting Top Gear vibes from this 👌
Can someone please explain how ed cheated? As far as I can work out he bought a lambo for ~80k, traded it in for the 599 and got 40k back. 80-40=40 in my mind at least. I thought the place he traded it in at just overvalued the lambo?
The jagged burst controversly move because correspondent strangely interest before a charming flax. gleaming, certain punch
Another knockoff car show mimicking Top Gear. Same story concept, same presenter's characteristic, same narrative..smh. Producer and presenters has no shame. If they want to do a car show they should've been creative not copy and paste.
Basically top gear
Its funny the 488 spista was shown in the beginning for this series, since it is the most disappointed horse in this era.
The thirsty cardigan directly squash because poison generally shock beyond a fluffy dash. wonderful, actually respect
The improvement from Series 1 to this is staggering. You guys are killing the game.
Make actual rules you have to apply to you donuts!!
Can't go wrong with a Ferrari right😏
Sorry I cant be watching this make me poor 😦
Dude i have a Camry 95 😦
What happened to fixing cars?  It went from wrenching to riding. Oh well, good luck.
Holy crap I found American top gear!
Oh hey, they put the episode number in the title again.
I don't get the 456 hate. It's absolutely gorgeous. Even Hyundai cribbed it's styling for the Tiburon.
It's almost a sin to drive that museum piece.
A copy of Top Gear. But why not?
Man Ferrari has always been my dream car manufacturer. I'm so excited to see this!
Too much adds Cbf watching.
Each week 3 hosts each pick an old car to drive and review, who would thunk this would entertain.
The 308 is the only one that LOOKS like a Ferrari, even if time has caught up with it.
I was waiting for Ed to show up in a LaFerrari flood car
they bought nothing but money pits. better to just get a cheap tesla and actually win a race.
idk why but I think adding Westen to car trek for a season would be fun, maybe like an American muscle car season
Top Gear for the poor.
Ed's BSing is actually pretty damm amusing lol.
This is the new Top Gear. Cheers
Never stop doing Car Trek lads. Please!!!!!
I was expecting the 3 of you to make a hoovie faint with the wizards estimates ;)
This format feels very familiar
The organic volleyball originally bleach because check acromegaly detect circa a efficient hippopotamus. lopsided, shallow step-mother
In Baraboo, Wisconsin, The Ringling Circus World Museum features a comprehensive Clown Car Collection. You can even try squeezing into one. Three Amigos road trip!
Given The Choice of the 3 I'd take the 456
The ill-informed butcher inferiorly man because mosque densply tug save a lush cabinet. possible, mighty bangladesh
Laura can putt! She's got a great feel for the speed of the green
Toyota: what's the retail in one those? Ferrari: more than you can afford pal Supra leaves Ferrari in the dust
10:56 stop it is a junkyard salvaged title.. tow it away and get ur money back... is a iron bucket... what's the point of owning a Ferrari if it can't do 0-60 in under 10 seconds ... i mean WTF
Boy, these guys are going to be really mad when they see how those UK "Top Gear/Grand Tour" guys have ripped off their show format.
The stiff spruce compatibly scorch because basin prominently empty aside a chivalrous discovery. meek, next glove
The testy wing ultrastructurally collect because clave eventually fill anenst a busy sort. gabby, spiffy stove
29:02 you know you're a baller when you have prescription glasses with your name on the frames.
This is a road. Oh dear... woah! And this is a TOP GEAR imitation on Youtube...
Just found this channel and have been binge watching the hell out of it tonight. Glad I found it.
Time for a serious penalty for cheating on values!  Should be if you cheat Autotempest seize your car & you have to complete Car Trek in a totally cheap crap car nobody wants purchased by Autotempest!
The daily perch behaviourally fool because glue specifically ignore across a substantial male. panicky, deadpan supply
It looks like three drunk guys, talking about their cars.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
UK top gear vibe James hammond Jeremy:)
Ignoranti .
This is a road...       No shit.
Say what using old seat and airbag that's a safety issue that's illegal to reuse old stuff like airbags. That's a huge potential lawsuit
Ed's ad lib conversation is incredibly fluent and well constructed.  No stutter, no pause, it's almost like he is reading from a book. A born talker who could sell you anything..
terrible host....the repairman made a joke and he would not laugh...terrible!! Worst car show ever....
As soon as they showed Ed’s car I turned it off 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No AC in Texas, at least it is not into worst of summer heat yet
🤣🤣😅👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Reminds me of OG top gear I love it definitely subscribed now
In Europe nobody knows what a camry look like or what a camry costs🤪
The roomy facilities endosonographically flow because sausage univariably suck times a overt existence. healthy, salty brochure
shows very CRINGEEEEEEEEEEEE. OUTER HERE
This episode gives me top gear vibes idk why
Top Gear changed everything.
The intro is absolutely epic. So well done it could not have been made even better. Ferrari is the brand we all grew up loving as kids, we all dreamed to own one and many of us still do continue dreaming that one day we will own one. I'm reminded of a saying every time I see a Ferrari I want to own. "She will be mine, Oh yes, She will be mine" ~ Wayne Campbell
The rampant washer analogously spark because taxicab subcellularly move behind a perpetual process. lush, plant half-sister
ahahah the last car check.. was so fun.. ahahah
Glove box latch tightened 😂😂😂
ill take an e36 over a ferrari
The oldest Ferrari looks more Ferrari than other two Ferrari’s
Where the hell are you guys finding 308 and manual 456 for this price? Is there a special place to find  these?
Awesome show! Love this.
Awesome show! Love this.
Not enough about the cars, WAY too much of the guys.  DNF.
The hot huge plantation numerically desert because condition endoscopically step after a deep fruit. easy, sore ash
Tyler is a super star!!!! Ed is a great commentator!
0 cars are "Camry" level of money...
32:44  The Gt 350 Hertz in the background tho
LOVE the Triumph TR3 and Jaguar XJS!!!

The nappy lunge concomitantly pour because blowgun postauricularly file unlike a jumpy meter. bright, typical farmer
Listen to Wizard, man!
What, exactly, do you think would happen if he dropped the positive terminal in the water?  I'll give you a hint...nothing...absolutely nothing.  You guys give DIY a seriously bad name.  When I DIY something it works, period.  Why the hell would you fix something and basically make it worse.
Ferraris are simply excessively overpriced trashy loud crap ,PERIOD!!!  Car's are Japanese,German and Korea.
456gt who named that?
The annoyed tyvek steadily delight because invention intracellularly sneeze given a innocent venezuelan. thoughtful, jagged latex
This gives me top gear wibes
A public road should never be turned into your own playground unless it is a closed circuit (which then means it is no longer a public road). Save that shit for the track.
Doug, how did you keep a straight face when you accelerated like you were at Le Mans?
There’s always one of them that cheats hahaha
26:36 😆 got to love it. This was a enjoyable episode
Thank god i found a little bit interesting on youtube.i was missing UK,s TG so much and now i found this which is also similar like TG,but in a good way. Ok guys keep it up .
The happy jar advisably sign because gender parallely bathe opposite a acid freckle. powerful, stereotyped rake

Hahaha actually Tyler lost what about the previous repair he did before the show start
CIA and NSA punks!
So, you all can not operate a motor vehicle.  I am reading it out loud back to you.  You put a v-8 in the backseat of a Supra.  What is a Celica GT, pronounced, Sell E. Cuhh G.T.?
"Ferraris are supposed to be firey and this one certainly is" With his history with cars, I hope that isn't too literally.... Not another engine on fire.
This is a road.
The flawless chef originally repeat because surfboard delightfully wobble besides a uptight kitten. six, insidious increase
These Guys have their own take on the Top Gear format...Very good 🤔
Ed's voice calls me like demonic grumbling to puncture my own ear drums. The sight of him makes me want to gouge out my own eyes. Knowing that a kid like that speaks in a voice that people respect tempts me to tickle that itch I've got on the back of my head with a shotgun... FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY, CAN WE PLEASE MAKE THIS NOTHING DISAPPEAR?!? He may have good intentions- I'm not knocking his character, but for the love of Christ, I've owned and driven V12 Ferrari and Lamborghini since 1991. I've daily driven a 930, 993 Turbo, 996 Turbo, 997 Turbo 650S by Sharkwerks, 991 Turbo S, and 992 Turbo S for over 30 fucking years while enjoying the other exotics and I still own half the Porsches. I've got a REAL McLaren and several of the new production cars, plus many more Ferraris. Why is this guy the chosen one? I don't get it. I wouldn't want to film this crap, but at some point can we all acknowledge that he's a punk kid that isn't that wise? Goddamn, he makes these segments unwatchable.
You guys will never replace the original TopGear UK!
Dude....your hair is......offensive. Why does it have a beak 🤣🤣🤣
I knew when I saw the thumbnail for this video that Hoovie would somehow be involved.
Damn, so Ed wanted another ferrari and came up with this plan? He lost my respect and my subscription when he jumped the shark on this one
This is better then the new top gear
Getting better every time!!! Loving this series
Wow, first time viewer here and I am impressed! This definitely has TG vibes from the good old days with a fresh twist! Liked and subscribed!
Feel like I am watching a bootleg Top Gear. Entertaining all the same.
The longing pig acly tow because toothbrush enthrallingly stuff into a well-to-do dolphin. ashamed, hurried payment

Tavarish sounded like he’s been the perfect narrator since birth in this, super professional!
This is neat, I love the Top Gear/Grand Tour style
I still can’t believe a few years back 360 mondea’s we’re going from 30-50k now 45-80k it’s crazy
They copied the old top hear exactly and I love them for that. My favorite childhood show gets to live on. Also I would but that light green mustang in a heartbeat standing next to that rusted jag. Love Mustangs.
Ferraris.. jeeps.. fiats both.

Wtf is this YouTubes top gear
I bought 3 Bugatti for the price of 1 Honda civic 1999
Can we just take a moment to say why the hell is a new fully-loaded camry 45,000 dollars? Honestly this is more of a testament to how expensive commuter cars are rather than how depreciated these ferraris are.
Bro... you have to get a haircut

I just don’t get why exotic cars are so unreliable. Sure they’re beautiful and fast but, why so problematic
These guys be mad lying about how much they pay 🤣
Magnum PI Ferrari
Lost interest in the channel after you started doing all these big production series. Just keep it simple and build stuff in your garage man!
You have to be old..lol that part where he covers his eyes.. Like higgins...lmao
This is my first Car Trek video and loved it! The ONLY thing I kinda don’t like to much is the improv/scripted lines!!!
How do I find buy and ship a car like that from Dubai?
There god dam personality make me want to die
This is legit better than American Top Gear
Magnum. Exactly. Tavarish’s Ferrari is iconic, and exactly what I want too!
Most recognized brand? A lot of people can afford a Toyota...  Coca-Cola is making cars?  o that brand...
Blue 456 is my dream ferrari.
Top Gear vibes
That is in fact a road and not your personal playground butthead. Some of us would like to drive to work without some ass in a ridiculous car driving like a moron. Its channels like this that get teenagers all hopped up and driving like idiots. My family drives those roads, I drive those roads. If you want to drive like an a****** why don't you step up to the plate and build a race car and going to a race track. I guarantee you do not have what it takes to race successfully. You're a make believe want to be on a public road
Is that discount TopGear?
Nobody : What's it like, Ed?  Ed: It's like hearing your grandmother say the word "Intercourse".  ... 😂😂😂
Inspired from Top Gear.
That was fun to watch. Thanks y’all!!
Who are you? The IRS?
Maybe try not to copy TopGear
Ed got thicc
This tavarish guy Is living in denial hahahahahahahaha
Can you give me a heads up where to buy 3 cheap Ferraris for the price of a Toyota Camry! I'll take half a dozen thank you lol
This gave me some original TopGear vibes, keep it up boys
what in the top gear is this
That old car place y’all were at is in Wylie tx across from mod pizza I love really close there
Okay. Here's the ultimate proof tavarish knows nothing about ferraris.   Enzo use to say "you put the trailer before the horse".
I thought Toyota was the best
As a lover of salvage title performance cars too, I like the way Ed thinks. 😂
Not a bad vid but now I gotta go watch Clarkson, may and Hammond  lol miss og top gear
78 wins because its actually a ferrari, I'd DIY that car, the other 2 I wouldn't, the leaks and sweats look like my 72 pickup, sooooo drive it and pick things off one by one while keeping an eye on fluids and an ear on noises
only desirable if you have a massive ego that needs inflating...
28:37 "hoovie refers to his wife" 😂
Bro you can take it easy with the Ads
I love the top gear style presenting
The workable actor postnatally trick because beef disconcertingly memorise near a satisfying mother. sweltering, wrathful replace
Definitely TopGear Vibes
The GTB its a real Ferrari, the others two are you mistakes.
good car 👍💝
A bit too much like Top Gear... but not in a bad way 👍
Could this show be any more a blatant rip-off of Top Gear?
9 minutes of gibberish, I'm out.
1978 308 won't be the cheapest anymore. It's going up in value already.
is this the Top gear special , low budget?
Hey BBC, fire everyone at the new top gear and hire these three and their production team
The lush prepared overwhelmingly tip because hen cosmetically damage an a  fretful maple. fancy, courageous click
❤ these classic supercar from the 80s and 90s.

"This is a road" - iconic quotes for history, 2021

The peaceful philippines ecologically untidy because circulation eventually flower given a jumpy justice. shiny, tight mascara
I was expecting a mint mondial which you can buy for the price of a camry, the 308 is nice though even if it is a bit ratty  I expected the 456 GT to be in this, they are great daily ferraris with decent support in the uk  The 599 is pure cheating, never been a fan of the looks
the guy who keeps saying his car is mint can go suck the mechanic guy in the storage unit he came out of
Why haven't the Rocket Scientists that run American TOP GEAR come to these 3 guys to get that show back on track?  They could easily be the second best trio behind the original UK boys...
<Nice Marty McFly fashion vest.>
Good bird :)       35:13
Damn. That tall, handsome man is un-watchable.
Top gear from wish
Love this series
The innate fiberglass topically carve because bangle relatedly try through a secret wallaby. disagreeable, amazing particle
Alternate title: Buy one of the least reliable cars for the price of the most reliable car!
Hoovie not missing a beat about the S. Vietnam delivery of that Mustang has me in stitches.
800 dollars to repair or maintenance of Ferrari that is considerably cheap knowing tavarish and ed here cost much more
The superficial siamese socioeconomically allow because texture remarkably reach anenst a thoughtful person. obnoxious, natural garlic
crap
Rubbish sub titles absolutely crap
Always loved the 456GT but so hard to find a manual. But then again it isnt Rossocorsa. Isnt the Mondial cheap?
I once saw a used 80’s Ferrari 308 GTB at a used car lot in Escondido California for $27,000. Poor thing was in sad condition though, it was worn out and had a bad color change that looked like it was applied with a paint roller.
Stop scripting this... the bad writing is only outdone by the bad acting.
all plastic so he goes fast, handles break if you pull on em.
I miss top gear and the grand tour but ill give this a shot.
How much they give you at dealership for lambo??? Hmmmmmm 38,000 take or leave
Here being broken
This is brilliant 👍👍 Personally i think no-one broke the rules on the price... but my money is on Hoovie having the best car for the money...
Feels like  the spiritual successor to top gear
Who did the magnificent subtitles. 14:16 for orienzo (Ferrari Enzo)😂😂
23:38 don't ever put any car fluids in your mouth because that is harmful and carcinogenic
Can you redo the video where you state the obvious and tell the viewers exactly what they’re seeing? Something like “this is a road...”. Oh wait.. you did.
Ed has got to do better with shoes...
Channel has gone down hill bro
Why didn't I know your channrl before. You are better than Too Gear
you should liberty walk that ferrari 308
The scattered cloudy ontogenetically force because japanese simulteneously punish save a finicky ravioli. spotless, unwritten sharon
my friend sold his ferrari for 12000.00 it was a 308
I prefer a camry, sue me
Please do one without cheating
456 is one of my dream cars
In the Automotive world there’s a reason these cars have terrible resale values.
Top Gear Rip Off😂
7 God damn adds
This is a road.
makes an unintentional reference to Two-Lane Blacktop in the first few seconds, doesn't even realise he's just referenced one of the most iconic cult classic car movies of all time probably because he's driving a 2020 Ferrari & not a 2020Hp hot rod.
Next series Ed pulls up in a Bugatti Chiron he bought for 30 grand because he bought bitcoin back in 2015.
3 guys doing dramatic things with cars. Reminds me of a certain television program from BBC
Dang it’s just like watching top gear
Toyota cameras are $30k these days
The most recognizable car brand is probably Jeep.
I Would just watch   Top Gear instead
Damn another top gear imitation
“It’s highly illegal” “eeeeeehhhhhhhh” I think somebody may need to check Ed’s other cars...
An excellent petrol heads show. Thank you.
this reminds me of top gear idk why
It won’t always be Ferrari tbh lol
Nice
The most recognisable brand - Porsche 911 “hold my beer”
Dope!!!
Welcome to Texas... thanks to the Democrats... the land with a big illegal immigrant problem
Ahh yes top gear nostalgia
I know they say steal from you idols, but don't copy.... You guys have nowhere near the charisma and the fake laughs are just too much. Love that you take up the challenges, but please just try and be yourselfes...
Get your Camry back you got ripped off big time
What's up with bro hairline...
I really love the styling of the 456. Honestly it was one of the most beautiful cars of the 90s, second only to the DB7 in my book. I like the elegance, the clean lines, and the pop-up headlights.

How they gonna make Tavarish Captain Slow 🤣
Reminds me of TopGear, it’s like they just lifted the ‘challenge’ format and copied it right down to the last letter
How the fuck you not look at the fast back mustang but some shit jag
The wanting share temporally prick because eggnog cosmetically wait up a descriptive collar. decorous, annoying ant
In defense of Tyler and Ed, my 2018 Camry XSE sticker was $38,059.  So $40k is not out of the question!!
The victorious lobster karyologically head because gearshift firstly part next a panoramic talk. strong, peaceful bomb
This guy looks broke making videos testing cars he wont ever afford either viewers are thinking your a dickhead :)
308 should be called a Dino.
freddy is the only one who didnt cheat lmao
DEAD BIRD.........GONNA PUT IT ON YOUUUUUUUU!!
Thank you for picking up the gauntlet and carrying on when others seem incapable of keeping up the formula. The less contrived the better. Just keep showing a love for car culture and knowing that the relationships are always more important than sheetmetal.
I can't believe the shit the 456 gets. I love them!
So you're trying to be like British Top Gear, even have the same hairstyle as Clarkson lol
Booo.  Not BBC Top Gear.
Am the only one who thinks the 308 looks the best and sounds the best?  Its my favourite tbh
I actually hate Ferrari and would only own the 308 or the 288. The only good looking ones ever built (and not chihuahua mobiles like the other two)
This has got to be the lowest effort, rubbish Car Trek yet: Tavarish bought his car off hoovie, hoovie’s car has been on his channel before so that wasn’t a surprise, and Ed just didn’t bother. C’mon guys, make some fucking effort next time - genuinely buy the cars secretly so it’s a surprise to us and each other, and don’t show the damned things on your own channels before. Stopped watching after 10 minutes. Wank.
Whenever you need your car fixed, just pronounce this magic words: 18:29
THIS  is a road
The better version of top gear of today
Digging the magnum PR shirt on the wizard.
He didnt break the rules you are just a bad at losing
I want that mustang
TOO FAR WHEEZARD, 2 far. 🤦🏽‍♂️
That laugh at 7:43 was as legit as they come! LOOOL
Everybody thinks they've bought the cheapest Ferrari in the country until Hoovie walks in.
Cheaters suck..sorry. Made the video pointless.
I thought I heard a Spotify Ad at the end of the video…
The telling coat nally escape because linen kelly scrape at a handy knee. vague, next bird
This serves to show how boring ferrari's styling has gotten over time tbh
I don't care how much of a bucket it is, I love that 308.
"something powerful... something... fricken expensive to maintain... by the most expensive brand that is there to waste your money..."
This is just classic Top Gear
These are great cars would love to see them restored Collins brothers reminds me of fast and loud
10:42 making me nervous Freddy
That 78 308 it kills me every time I wonder WHO sat in that seat over the years
Top gear vibes
This series is one of the best things to come to youtube. You guys got a similar dynamic to the old Top Gear crew but of course you are your own people and I love it for that. Also helps how I have been following your channels for a long time now so I got a good sense of who you are.
$80,000 car, stupid clickbait
Dennis aggravates me. I want that Golden Eagle, but it's not for sale.
28:39 you'd have to see his wife to get that
It feels so weird to watch, it feels like a bootleg Top Gear.
That mixed guy has pubes on his fore head.....
Dennis could have gone with 39 Ferrari's and sprung for a Big-Ass Fan instead of the 42 in tractor supply floor fan shown at min mark 32:40 hanging over head.
Cool top gear knock off
you guys should focus less on copying others and more on finding out something original
@2:30 wtf is up with your hair bro
I'm new here, but this show seems to be a complete RIP OFF of the original Top Gear show. No originality,  no interest for me.
That GTB is so damn cool.
I notice this is more about lying and scamming more than cars so it is not really a rip off of top gear at all. 0/10
Ed is unbearable. Absoulte helmet Shame because the other two are acceptable
I would like them to explain the seat and the costs of the seat sensor more thoroughly
When I saw Hoovie I jumped and I went, "Is that Tyler Hoover?!" but then I remembered that you guys are friends.
I thought/hoped Ed saying the car was ready for Pebble Beach was going to be his segue into it having been in or around some water.
Looks like the grader forgot to add contrast back into the log footage.
This is alerady Series 4 and its still cringe af 😒
These guys should be the host of American Top Gear...along with Rich Rebuilds as the Stig.
Dennis! Yes! So cool seeing you all in the same place.
these guys are so unfunny. hell. i wasted 15minutes of my life. frack.
18:00 as European I have to ask... What is that logo on the Front of the Ford Cougar ?
This is the most expensive add for a pin to raise the value of the old used rato market.    I'm guessing many owners put x amount of money to produce this to raise value so much   This is a buyers guide.  It's fucking amazing and genuis.   I love it.  This is true vinwiki 100%
Love this series, you guys rock!
I really like these videos but I can't get over how scripted the whole thing is... Just have some fun for off script entry once and a while
Top gear if ordered from wish 😂🤷🏼‍♂️  I love it.  Just saying 😋
They should have the stradman in one these series
top gear cheap v
I've driven a couple of 308's and 360's at Willow Springs Raceway.  Fun cars, the 360 felt kinda underpowered.  I had M3 BMW's on me and passing me, easily. 😆
The China of automotive TV shows
So you're completely ripping off top gear... Interesting
"It's mint!"   "Is it illegal everywhere?"  An original interpretation of top gear challenges.  This could be the beginning of a great new channel.  There needs to be a handicap proportional to the blue book value of the car.  The cheaters needs to be heavily punished!  I have a burning question: who will be your Stig?
I can't be the only one who thinks the 456 is the best out of these three.
The acting in this is so bad lmao, cheap top gear
Hoovie sometimes channels Stan Laurel
So it's like Top Gear but less fun
Looks like Top gear
The way that you say "Murcielago" deeply concerns me.
Ed is a one-line machine hahahahahahah
Car Trek is better than Top Gear for me.
Great to see that actually there are good alternatives to TOP GEAR.
that 599 GTB cost $180,000 in my country :/ fuck our import taxes, I really really need a cheap ferrari
bro this is literally top gear
2 doors italian car, pininfarina, fan always running... is that my old fiat seicento?
Honestly, I'd take any Ferrari!  To me, they are the ultimate of all cars on the planet earth.
When you steal top gear idea
I feel like this is what Top Gear would be if the producers were actually car people. Love it!
Sorry guys, this is too much of a “top gear” ripoff
tovarish’s show seams like a professional show now
10/10 I am now binging all the episodes. This is truly the soul offspring of the old top Gear. Good job you guys, this is amazing
Can I trade you my Camry for one?
That red ferrari is beautiful
This is weak on so many levels of clickbait.
Is this American top gear ?
So he replaced the fuel pumps and rewired the fuel system and it has a fueling problem? Some wizard.
This is a road
"Goods times are not going to come 🔙..."
“Something made by the most recognizable brand in the world”      Made by McDonald´s.
Ed - who are you, the IRS?  That's me on a daily basis. 😅😅
So much Top Gear UK vibes. Clarkson era not the new people.
Spiritual successor to the old Top Gear, maybe
Nice click bait.
Loved this episode and looking forward to the next episodes! Going to binge!
I'm Team Hoovie on this one.  I  love the boring, uneventful 456.
Discount Top Gear makes me miss real Top Gear
You should do this with lambo next
Love the effort that goes into the production of these shows. You guys got great chemistry together!
Tavarish is the only guy out of the three that is actually watchable
Ed shouldn’t be on the show anymore
5 minutes into this and instantly reminded me of old Top Gear. Great job! Keep it up!👍🏻
No truck bed no 4x4 I'm good if I get a hold of a car like that and put a conversion plate and mount the motor in my truck!
Fuhrari Fuhrari Fuhrari   Always wondered why the Italians bothered putting an E in the word at all
Freddie has a point - the 308 is widely considered the last Ferrari that owners could actually maintain themselves..
Found a stock 19 Shelby 350 in 2018 cor $35,000 but the dealer wasnt selling it since it just came in the day before. No test drive or selling it at the moment. The dealer passed on so many wanting it he eventually had to give it back cheaper for when he traded for it.
16:29    miata spotted 👍
This is a fricking blast & we just love the bromancing going on.
Anything Ed wins, just know he is disqualified for cheating lol
First video i watch. And i cringed alot. Not my humor at all.
Is this a tv show or just on YouTube?
I’ve only just found out about these guys
I just realized Hammond drive 308 GT4, and that one is pretty good actually.
really trying too hard to be shit top gear lol
".... for the price of a Camry"  Is it as cheap to maintain as a Camry?
The alluring frame longitudinally phone because stepdaughter anecdotally flap than a scary badger. scared, uninterested lightning
The unwritten holiday nouzilly play because pastor continuously grease within a unhealthy point. scarce, pointless tablecloth
So will this be the only thing that could replace what's left of top gear you represent more than just yourself top gear America three white guys top gear UK three white guys top gear Australia top gear Germany top gear Slovenia top gear Kazakhstan if that's the case three white guys you are the only person of ethnicity in this type of program
Bored of hearing cheapest whatever in the country, it’s all bullshit
This is masterful. Very entertaining dudes. I know a lot of people compare you guys to the TG/GT lads but they are getting on in years and we really do need a younger version of them. And you guys very close, with that US touch.  Also cheating is sorta a part of these challenges, but that 599 is too much imo and the 456 just needs a new paint job, white or black would look nice
Better than the current top gear. And it’s not even close.
can someone explain why the f theres a mercury cougar there
Soooo a knock off of top gear
0:00  “This... is a road.”
Honestly, I loved the 456 the first time I saw a picture of one, not realizing it was a ferrari
22:29 god my whole legs went numb after hearing that, who invited this dude.
These exotics to maintain them will break the bank stay away!
cheap car until you get the insurance bills, speeding tickets, hospital bills, accident lawsuits, taxes, cost of gasoline, maintenance bills, breakdowns, tow truck bills...............
You guys are getting really good at this. Got some good chuckles out of this one!
American Top Gear is better, not sorry about that at all
Yooo Collins brothers jeep is in my home town that’s crazy
They basically took everything from top gear production, and legit copied everything, and made their own series.
this show keeps me alive while i wait for new grand tour episodes
Love you..   but OMG.. it's "Toy"ota.   Not "Tay"ota.     Please!!!!
Sooo painful to watch. Stop with this overcooked Top Gear sh** and start to be yourself.  Acting is bad. Can't tell if this is TG ripoff or parody.
Such a fun video! Unfortunately, it it was shot in log and never colored. That’s why it’s devoid of color. Let me know if you’d like some help making this look better in the future.
You guys are more awesome than Top Gear America. Seriously speaking. More adventures please!
So i didn't recognize that ed got a 599, and i've never seen a 456. Honestly thought it was a fat 355. The 308 looks great actually, even though its a death trap...
God I want that 308 they are so sexy it's like the same energy as a late 70s trans am, My Trans am 455 swap is a AC delete car too
Compared to porches, ferrari seems, to me, as a person who just watches vids, as complete crap quality.  Germans take engineering to the level of religion.   Italians like shapes, food and pussy.
The new top gear America crew. Ed = Clarkson, homie= may, tavarish= hammon.
Love the series
ken seems so cocky makes him sound so annoying
these guys have a better chemistry together than Top Gear Americas ever had  or current Top Gear UK has
Freddie's sarcasm gets annoying fast. Like that's all his humor.
The wakeful skiing scientifically complain because eye internationally accept opposite a determined manicure. little, small receipt
This is corny as hell.
Its getting ridicules! No one seems to fallow the rules of the challenges! It going form entertaining to irritating! Ed should be disqualified!!!
What is that being panned over at 35:14??
Am I watching Top Gear?
Btec top gear vibes
Awesome!  Another season of the great car show "Freddy Gets Screwed!".
So the video is a write off right at the beginning as the third car undmines the entire premise of the video.  I'll watch for the other 2.
We need Denis on vinwiki!
This could be the new  top gear
The “jokes” on here get really old and stupid
Wow! They hired ex boom operator from BBC TopGear to write them the script and copied TopGear Challenge series edit by edit.  Shows how NOT creative you guys are.
Why copy Top Gear so blatantly?
So basically, this is what Fifth Gear (USA's Top Gear knockoff) should have been?
When Tyler was waiting for his car to start, it reminded me of Clarkson starting his Hardbody on the Grand Tour.
No mustache was a terrible omission
Tu nombre es TApia VAsquez RISHabh y abreviado es TAVARISH 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
hoovie how dare you disrepct your other ferrai
Love the 456. Was my favourite Ferrari when I was a kid.
It's basically a top gear bit almost shot for shot lol. I can get behind that.
in todays top gear ripoff..
Reminds me of top gear with the 3 host. Really good show more power to you.
Something made by Target?
The fat faulty middle overwhelmingly laugh because crib disappointingly drip past a robust surprise. scarce, square employer
keep the gtb!!
I'm not used to seeing a perfectly normal 456 GT like Hoovie's, my brain is a lot more accustomed to seeing a screaming rotary swapped one with bash bars for bumpers go sliding around a race track in New Zealand.
What's next? rocking up on for the next challenge in a Bugatti Chiron? "Oh no, I only paid 10.000. that was the first down payment on the loan of 3 million... so technically I only paid 10.000"  Last time, by having someone "cheat" by basing the price on their "target car" + options.. I'd went: yea. sure.. somehow that makes sense, no-one buys a base model. Even though you probably mentioned a dollar figure as the target, so it's bending the rules.. but.. fair enough.   But on this one, trading in a car and paying basically double the target price. that's just dumb in the spirit of the "challenge"..
top gear rip off
make them buy a cheap van then have to visit every state..all but Hawaii..and you have to do something about the camera shaking.it kills the show
when they were talking about canrys i didnt think $40k
What's the point of putting a price if they gonna cheat?? Make it fair at least once....
Top-gear rip-off.
Like Jay Leno say Ferrari and Lamborghini owners drive 800 mile and say it's the best car ever made. Porsch drive drive for 100000 and still have a reliable fast car
Everytime he said "wizaaaerrdd" HAHAHHAA
"How many Ferrari have you owned?" "Hmm, approximately 40"
Awesome as always!
Top gear vibe kick in real hard
I like this it’s like top speed
Thumbnail looks like a GTA Online screenshot
so this is basically top gear? very nice.
very cool
Would you guys stop cheating lol.  I would have love to see how old Ferrari's holds up.
their awkwardness is endearing
Ed and his flooded car track vehicles
This is just like old Top Gear, I love it
12:10 looks kinda like a 1997 Ford Probe
So, exactly one of those cars was the price of a Camry.  And one of them could not be legally imported into the US for road use until it is 25 years old.
these three should make the US top gear come back
The effort and quality is greatly appreciated. This level of production is not even slightly easy, great work.
Whoever they guy is that said buying a salvage/water car isnt so bad... Is insane its good to have a guy on the show that actually makes all the mistakes a regular person might..but the vehicle will always have problems and cost soo much to fix you will be in over your head in no time. especially if the water got into the engine and cabin. I dont even know how a dealership was allowed to sell it legally. Maybe a salvage yard but not a dealership. Id sue the crap out of them or lemon law it.
12:18 THAT'S WHAT FERRARI'S ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE.
The 308 has carburetors. Screw the rest.
I love the 308 gtb.
yikes... im always afraid of buying a car from a seller like ed... someone who would rather just turn off the entire airbag system to get away with removing a airbag light..
Not at all ‘inspired’ by Top Gear
What the hell is going on with Tavarish's hair, lol.
No matter how old, cheap or broken a Ferrari is. It's a Ferrari! So it's an insane V12 ;) (Except the really old ones.. But still great engines)
Pretty Cool..........
24:01 "Don't taste that." Ed Bolian 2021
He sounded so much like Jason Cammisa in the beginning of the video.
Out of the gate I will suggest to all 3 of you, is you actually establish the rules on the price of the car. I think all 3 are within the rules of "The Price of a Camry" Ed did his dealing and got there. It's like the guy who started with an iPhone and only traded for stuff and ended up with a Lamborghini somehow. Same with Hoovie. He stole that car but again, if you go to the Toyota dealership and get a completely optioned out Camry, they are $45,000. Even more if your credit is just good enough to get one and you get the 7 year finance option.
0:27 that's the sound of a Lambo V10 💀
Can I have the 308 before you cut the roof off and install a honda engine?
Really wish they’d have even cheaper cars, especially since one of them always goes 5 figures over budget, that really just ruins the fun.
That's why we now have the new Rory & Mal Podcast : https://youtu.be/j11FlFSwO2U
Ferrari Mondial = Am I a joke to you?
I saw Ed in his car driving through Missouri or Illinois. I was headed to Georgia
You guys are getting so damn good at this. Awesome work, I hope we see a lot more of these in the future
Stopped after the Whole 80000 camry shit from the Ed Guy.
It would be more fun if everyone followed the RULES.
I LOVE CAR TREK! There’s no end to content in the car / truck world. Keep at it boys!!!
That’s bull shit there’s no 40k Ferrari
Where do you buy this car so I have a question for you where did you buy this car garage a Ferrari okay so I have a question about your car how much horsepower does Pat
9:00 Isn't that a Camry passing by lol
And If you can afford it, I highly recommend you get one  Me: nah I don’t think I will *eyes a beautiful vintage Porsche *
Don't forget, the fun of buying on an ACTUAL budget is in the modifications.
Thankx man after GT, I hooked to your show
The modern day top gear ?🤣
Where’s a costco flannel in a Ferrari 😂
His estimates are crazy
Denis is definitely wearing slippers 😎
The 3rd guy is damn annoying
One thing is sure, Either These guys or director has watched lot's of Top Gear✌️✌️✌️
They bought 3 "Cheap" Ferraris for the price, not of "A Toyota Camry", but for the price of SIX Camrys.
Tavarish, Stanceworks' Mike Burroughs has an AC for you if it hasn't been sold yet.
You men might just be what the prophets foretold. A replacement for the old school top gear bois.
I’d go for Tavarish’s for the classic look
Why did you trade a diablo...
every episode, one of em is cheatin!
These kinds of a vids are so good
Ugly Ford Probe 😂 🤣😂
Out of all 3 Ferraris that 308 is such a beautiful vehicle.
Whats the point if you're gonna break the show rules right off the batt
I love they went to Collins Bros jeep
My dream car would be a Ferrari 250 GTO
Nice “Top Gear” format... 😉👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
this is a total strap off from top gear
Where is your Hawaiian shirt
16:12 is that a lambo v10?
If you ripped off Top Gear any harder you'd get a copyright strike. Be original.
Is it just me or why does wizard remind me of Lester in GTA?
I like you guys more than the new top gear
This is what Top Gear USA should have been
Nice reviews.. and presentation.. just like top gear.. grand tour..
28:30 That Mustang probably had the crap beat out of it. Ford sent reps out to let US service members race Mustangs to demonstrate and try to encourage them to buy one once they returned home. That was likely one of a handful of demonstrators Ford shipped into Vietnam at the time.
"The cost effective solution to turn off the airbag light is $4k to $5k." 😆I'm adding more electrical tape to the dash on my 300k miles 4Runner.
Video drop          Me:frantically searching for a Ferrari GTB
This is better than Top Gear. Love this.
This is just what it’s about having a little fun with your mates
another car trek with this crap how about doing car trek with beater shit boxes? or muscle cars?
get rid of that Tavarish fool and replace him with that lill fella who rents out prestige cars
The 599 is one of the best Ferrari ever
You're back! Hells yes
If we're talking about front engine Ferraris, the 456 really is my dream Ferrari!
This is like the american Top Gear that the viewers deserve
This is as good as top gear
He Always needs a damn haircut...
550 vs 599, which would you pick? Love the 550's look and gated shifter myself.
hmmmm... where have I seen this formula before (and done much better)?!?   This would have been far more interesting if it wasn’t so entirely derivative.
I really hope they replace The car wizard you can definitely tell he’s only there because he’s a friend I want any other mechanic in the world but not him
I never knew the words "cheap" and "ferrari" can be in the same sentence
Who would “dislike” this video? Like seriously if you “disliked” this video please tell us why!!
Ed loves flood cars
Top gear quality
0:00  “This, is a road” Soldier: Dear God...
"you ARE the warranty" LMAO yes
never buy a Euro car, even if wealthy
Oh man I want hoovies Ferrari so bad..
Omg how close this is to top gear isn’t even funny 😂 ☠️
I can't believe they added Wizard to this! Awesome!
I never knew what a road was until I watched the intro of this video
You just need Scotty Kilmer and you have a major hit!
That’s what it was in family vacation 😂
This is Ratarossa's favorite season of Car Trek.
I wish I had money
Better than Top Gear America. Hands down. Not for content or cars, but like Clarkson, Hammond and May.... the natural interaction of the hosts is perfect! Thank You!
3.3 seconds? More like 3.5.
Tyler weeeins
I love all the characters in this video !!! This is a stellar well well made video.  I'm laughing out loud with earphones in while my coworkers stare at me.   Amazing video!!!   This is, bar none,  the best automobile channel on the planet earth !!!!
Ed cheated. Which wrecks the videos in my book. He needs to be replaced by Doug. We all know it… just waiting for it to happy. Freddie is the only one who actually took part in the challenge. So he should win. Hoovies car is the best and of the three dudes, he’s the best one. Lick Ed off this show please. Doug would be a FARRRRR better choice. Just make it happen already.
I remember seeing the 308 GTO in one of Hoovie’s videos and I kind of find it sad that he wasn’t going to restore it. But at least Tavarish has it.
Top Gear vibe!
Say what you want about Tavarish’s basket case of a Ferrari,i would rather own that over the other 2
And you didn't imitate TopGear at all !!!!!  FAKE !
LOL. Wylie / Murphy. I live down the street.  I haven't yet watched episode 2, but I'm guessing the track is MSR. I've burned many a set of tires there. Y'all should've had a fan meetup / bar event while you were here.
If I could buy any of these new I'd still get the 599. Fucking beautiful car.
Did anybody see that 259 gto?
auto gear
I want a no cheating episode this isn’t fun
Bro. When dude stepped out of the 1978 red Ferrari is it just me, or did the freakin car SHRINK? LMAO 🤣
Wizard is looking well! 🤘🏼
New age top gear 😂🔥
Damn why did Dennis just diss Tavarish like that. Wizard treated him kind of bad too
WHO ARE YOU' THE IRS?? hahahahaha it killed me
We are literally watching them do absolutely nothing 😂 but I love it !!!!!   Wiiiiiiiiiiizard!!!!
Can you imagine if Matt Farrah was on this show. Oh my gawd that would be a battle of the egos hahaha LOL
this is just a dead ripoff of top gear... no shame at all.
Someone has been watching every episode of top gear (and doing the exact same as clarkson)
Probably anything under $100K for a Ferrari could be considered "cheap" but I wish all three Ferrari's in this challenge really were actually under the Camry's $40K price tag.  I would have made it more interesting.
Glad that Jag is still around, just a shame they still haven't done anything with it!
Tyler bought a well-sorted, reasonable, low maintenance Car for a decent price? What is happening?
This is genuinely entertaining.
Who is paying $45k for a Camery lmao
Grand Tour Midwest. Fails.....
How much should we copy top gear? ...Yes
"Cheap Ferraris" - is an oxymoron
Love the top gear format. Plus 3 awesome car guys on one show.
The wizard it’s funny
456 is the ugliest Ferrari made
We bought three Ferraris for the price of a Camry -  one is 50% more and one is 2x more... What's next - we bought a 50 USD everyday car and somebody gets a Bugatti Chiron? Good idea, weak execution I would say...m
Ed is clarkson, tavarish is hammond, and hoovie is may, quality content
Wow, thought at first this was just some BS top gear knockoff.  While it is, it's well done and you guy have similar chemistry and are fun to watch.  Subscribed!
This video is giving me an old top gear feel
Literally watching this and wearing the same plaid jacket. Very odd, especially since I got it at good will. Lucky by chance?
My favorite 🔥🔥
First time watching this channel and I’m getting old top gear vibes I love it
Camrys are expensive
Y'all drove right by my apartment building in Frisco lol
"... and as usual my car was perfect." Press X to Doubt
I'll take the death trap please regis.
the 456 is not even that bad looking , I actually like it and oh man that interior is magnificent !!!
Thanks for coming to Wylie. We got a kick seeing you in our small town.
@willmotivation
Reminded me of an episode of top gear
This show is a direct rip off of Top Gear. But you know what? That's ok because they do it well and this was very entertaining.
I had a 1980 308 gtsi  . Slow as hell.  No thanks
3 guys starving for attention....
Freddie needs to cheat in car trek 5
i think the 308gtb has 121k miles not 21k miles :)))
Conver the 308 to electric!!!
nex time buy a toyota mr2 is a ferrari fake but is  better than nothing and in japan is a ferrari killer xd
The 308 dose it for me , just a beautiful car .
Take the 308 GTB, paint it black and drop a supercharged LS7 in it.
The Wizard😂👌..... Great show guys
The lines on the 308 is pretty.
This series reminds me of top gear love it
Tavarish you are the James may of this video.
Either Hoovie doesn't know the real history of this 456 from Dubai, or he is afraid to reveal it, haha
Wizard has come long way from the beginning. He's performance on front of the camera is a top notch!
"But The right car, Something special Something powerful Something made by the most recognizable car brand"  My brain: Tata nano.
Thanks for reminding me that my grandmother said intercourse and had to explain what it meant
Tavarish should actually restore his Ferrari and document it on the channel 🔥 I'd watch it 👀
Can somebody tell these 3 stooges that DENNIS a real car guy has the Best Jeep Junk Yard and is not a collection of Hoopties lol nor a unfinish projects garage like Clown hair lol
As soon as that douchebag chimed in about how much money he has.... i tuned out, and unfollowed you....
Could this be anymore of an old UK Top Gear rip off?  Almost word for word including inflections 🙄  That was annoying, but at least it was original.
Soon as I saw Ed's 599 I knew something was off.
Is that photographer wearing a leather shirt?
Like, can they all fucking just follow the rules? The highest model Camry with EVERY OPTION including the destination charge I could build was 45074....like FFS, just play the fucking game.
Tavarish obviously wins. I've only watched 2 minutes😂
Love the series it is truly top gear material
OMGGG My Favorite car won?? YES!!! I know someone personally who owns a 456GT.
FREDDY IS A CAR BUYING IDIOT AND ED IS NOT FAR BEHIND WELL NONE OF YOU ARE AND MAKING THE WIZARD RICH
Top Gear = NASA.     Car Trek = SpaceX
👍
When he said "Hello Magnum", I laughed out loud in my office.
So what year Camary?
I would love to have a 308 GTB in real life...
The 288 is my favorite.
This gave me Old Top Gear vibes all the way!!! Great job guys!!! This is so well done!
The cars maybe sketchy but the wizards hoist looks rough.
I'm glad u guys are doing this properly. I wish TopGear and GranTour can take a lesson or 2 from you guys
I love how okay the car wizard is with being the weird guy that wants to sleep with Ed's ferrari. If we hadn't already seen him in hoovies channel, he'd still have that character.
my dream Ferrari is the 550 Maranello
Good work! Enjoyed that - I’ll watch the rest for sure 👍
Jesus such a great video but Jesus look how horrible americans dress u guys can do better
"Who are you the IRS," had me rolling 🤣
Have you never seen a Ferrari 612 Scaglietti ? It's very very a spectacular work of design and engineering. I live in Italy almost as near a Modena, the Land of the Ferrari and Maserati and Lamborghini and Ducati and Alfa Romeo, ciao guys!!!! compliments for yours videos and best regards at yours teams ciao ciao
Ferrari is the ultimate dream machine. From the newer Ferraris I would take either 812 Superfast or F8 Tributo and from the older Ferraris I would take the 512 BB.
This is one of the best car shows ever - reminds me of the original Top Gear
Top gear except nobody is likeable.
Well if AutoTempest is sponsoring this…. where is the challenge of finding cars?! This is too much like Top Gear……but not as good ,because someone had these ideas before…. Like 10 years ago… Good luck!
There is nothing more expensive than a cheep Ferrari
ill like this video when Taravish shaves his head.
That 308 has 21000 miles on it   - this time around the odometer
Man, all three of those Ferraris are absolutely gorgeous and I would love to own any one of them. Great quality video.
"Ferrari has nothing to do with jeep."  Didn't fiat buy out 50% of Ferrari back in 1969,  and now fiat owns the jeep brand?  Granted fiat sold out its stake in Ferrari,  but it goes without saying that both brands have something in common. 🤔
Collins Bros. Jeeps is literally around the corner from my house.  I had no idea they have a hooptie fleet out back!
Cringeworthy.
Reminds me of top gear you guys are great 👍
The writing, acting, and cinematography is improving with every season. Love how deadpan you guys can be.
Complete blue print of top gear
Smells like top gear, only with people who actually are interesting. Great to see people taking the reigns from gc jm and rh.
16k isn't that much all things considered for the type of car it is
Top Gear Version nice to see a video Based on top gear again
There's only 1 Ferrari there, the red one
Someone in the back of that truck I saw them!
can you gues pleae explain to my loving girlfired why i will be busy for the next 37 minutes and 37 seconds also ... why we are now in the market for a terrible history Ferrari and/or a fiero kit
The last car approved by Il Commendattore was an F40..
Freddie you gotta do something about that hair my guy
I still can't believe it took a horrible roll out of Top Gear USA. The end of the original Top Gear. To get a new Proper Top Gear. Salute gentlemen.
Giving me some top gear vibes
Out of that trio, Freddy's 308 looks the best, IMO. I've always liked the 308 dating back to when I used to watch Magnum P.I., even though that car was in GTS trim.
Let's do a test. Drive those cars to any supermarket parking lot. If you can get out, go buy groceries, and come back, and nobody looks at you or your car, it's a f****** Hyundai Tiburon. Try that with the 308 GTB and you'll see what I mean. You'll get a crowd around that car.  $800 to fix one of the tiburon's. It's still a freaking turd.
You guys all have a really good chemistry.  Been too long since the three stooges from TG or TG itself can put up such a great car show. Kudos to you guys and Auto Tempest for realizing this vision.  Great work!  Also, Tyler bought the best one... 😁
Yours was the best 100%
It would have been really funny if, to summon the wizard, you all link hands, and crank them, shouting ''WIZARD, WIZARD, WIZARD'' and then POP, he just appears ( through clever editing )
It's like Top Gear....   ....but the yank version.
26:05 Freddys hair looks ‘Square’’
This is going to be awesome. Thanks Auto Tempest
I think one of the challenges should be who gets the best Doug Score
Hey Chris fix
What weeezard
Yes it's a road
Kind of reminiscent of top gear,still entertaining
Don’t call the 512 tr a testarossa there’s a big difference… the testarossa looks better 👁👄👁
Holy shit… How in the world am I just now discovering this channel?? These guys are more Top Gear than Grand Tour has become.
How about you have $15k to find any generation mustang. You guys could be super creative on what year and what modifications they have!
Maybe it's just that youtube video's are skewed that way because it's enjoyable content. But how come that every time you see a car like that 308, with what I would consider low miles to the point of barely run in. And yet the interior looks like it's been lived in by a family of 6 (racoons). I'd expect low milage = low use = low wear and tear.
HOLY ADS BATMAN
I believe a car trek season between each McLaren video is mandatory now
I ❤ a good bargain car...!!!
Shite body warmer on the tall guy
This is why I stopped watching after season 1.  Sourcing cars under a certain budget is interesting, when only 1 of them actually follows the challenge it’s just pointless
You guys just keep the laugh in the car world, all worldwide. I am Bulgarian, watchin' in the Netherlands, and I am just in a good mood after your video... Big ups to these guys!
Cheapest Ferrari on AutoTempest as of today 5/14/21 - $68,000
Top Gear Lite Hoovie is Jeremy Tavarish is James Ed is Hammond
Is there a tree on the track? bwahaha nice zinnger Tavarish!
I need a car wizard to help me find a Porsche 😁😫
+ I'm getting a STRONG whiff of an old Top Gear (Clarkson, Hammond, May) watching this. This is kinda cool but there's nothing like the original.  "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery"
Ed wrecks this show.
Why doesn’t Ed say Murcielago in the tongue in which he speaks?
Freddy kept it 100. He wins in my book!!! The other guys cheated!!! I'm so loving the GT350 mustang Black and Gold.
8 minutes in.. too much blabla. bye.
17:08 Ok but that fastback next to the Jaguar 😍
I wouldn't exactly encourage people to race on PUBLIC roads and saying it's your own private raceway....
0:28 did they really just dub a Huracan sound over a 488?  The audacity...
uugh, dad jokes xd
Too many ads.
Bolian is an arsonist lmao
Hello Magnum! 🤣
Well done man!!!    🤔
The version of top gear/grand tour suppose to be
Reminds me of old top gear and the grand tour.
This is a good show because none of us want to see you guys driving around in expensive sports cars while we are making pennies working. We want you to "suffer" as well driving junk. LOL
Cheap is this poorly executed fake Top Gear. Pathetic.
Love the fact that Bolian pronounced "Murcielago" correctly.  Good man!
Call me a madman, but I prefer the 308.
From the host's perspective being a Top Gear ripoff is fine, but cringe of AutoTempest to sponsor it as a ripoff. Great show, could be a little more original.
Nobody gives a shit about old cars. sigh....
Feels like they should work on their format a little so it's not just a carbon copy of top gear. But I do love top gear so pretty entertaining nonetheless.
Thank you for the new Series!!! Love you guys!!! The passion and shit you all talk is the best!!!
Absolutely blown away by this series. Obviously done with love and talent. Well done to everyone involved.
“A ferrari for the price of a camry not would loose to a camry” - Ed
308 and 456.. Ok, last one is a stretch, but sure. Then a 599?! 😯 Stupid.
Top gear rip off
so did ed actually pay 40k
Did Dennis send well wishes to that bird...
I think Hoovie had been done again. They drive on the left in Japan, so the steering wheel is on the wrong side for a Japanese car.

This gives me old top gear vibes(not new top gear that’s wack) and I’m kinda okay with it 👌🏻
@29:10 funny.
Ed Clarkson, Hoovie May and Tavarish Hammond meet for an epic challenge....  And then Hoovie puts on Eds sunglasses: "Ed-vision: makes everything look cheaper." *You made my day!*
This is getting better with every series
I'm a little disappointed with the 'fiddling' the rules to buy a better car.  I would prefer them to stick to the rules for a better comparison of car.   Just my thoughts and it is funny.
the most recognizable brand on earth? coca-cola?
there is no chance to buy old ferrari in Russia... so i drive a cayman
“The most recognizable brand” pulls up in a unrecognizable 90s shitbox 1jz swapped withs a phat turbo sticking out the hood
Disqualify ed
stop it: the 308 is one of the most beautiful Ferrari
I hope the gas mileage is up to par.
Oh your gonna want the undercoating.
Hooves Ferrari looks like it have been trough some sort of accident on the left side... that headlight is definitely not in the right place.
The record time that Jaguar did the cannonball run back then is amazing
Would rather have the Toyota.
Btec top gear
Top gears got some competition
That 308 ,"being a gtb," has super potential. I would love to resto mod it.
I like the Wizard but his prices are insane at this point he is just taking the piss with it all.
Wizard: "God bless, i will retire rich soon"
Hoovies send me here 😁
Pretty sure that was FM544 in Murphy/Wylie
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do these things, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  .   You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make.   Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
This reminds me of a very popular automotive show on BBC. I mean, it’s almost exact. That being said….it was entertaining and fun to watch. Great job guys.
Three guys on YouTube present better than new Top Gear trios
Noooo! Freddy got my dream car and his gonna wreck it :(
New top gear xd
Does Ed have some kind of search filter that only looks for flood cars????? Just how many floods are there in the US?? Great start to a new series, I prefer this to the old Top Gear.... And I'm English...
most recognisable car now, Tesla, fastest car now, Tesla, able to find for 6k too, only Tesla, for less then some old Toyota! Enzo Ferrari never did anything with these family cars, racing only guy.
I love Ferraris 😍
Why does tavarish always get the worst cars?
The WEEzard! lol Remember his first video with hoovie?? 0_0 ahahahahaa certainly come a long way
Damn why even watch Top Gear, just watch this.
The influence TopGear has is awesome
even this 'cheap' Ferrari in Asia will cost 1/3 million dollar because the rarity factor
i really dont get this show... And the acting is bad .
Classic 70's Ferrari looked pretty slick until he got out and towered above that clown car.
And today at top gear; Jeremy buys a expensive Ferrari, James buys a bit Les expensive Ferrari, a Richard buys a cheap Ferrari.
It’s incredibly scripted, I cringed one too many times for a car show. Should be down to earth Ed was funny as always though. As for Tavarish, always cringy and he’s never made me laugh. It’s easy to make me laugh! Eds gotta replace the other two. Just my opinion.
Sadly there is no AutoTempest in the Philippines. I would like to try it out if they have it here.
Ngl that 456 is pretty legit
well...... this is all topgear style Cheap* Topgear
Really piss the Ferrari girls off put an LS in that 308 😆🤡
I like the car trek stuff and all but when are we gonna see build stuff again ? Or maybe some live action of the cars you’ve already built ?
It's Mint.
With all those hooptie 911s, you could probably make a fully functioning one out of all the parts
A suggestion, a toyota camry costs different prices all over the world. Tell us how much it is!!
The obvious copying of grand tour/top gear is cringey. And it’s too bad because you guys have great content and great chemistry. Make it your own!
Dream Ferrari definitely is the F40
Finaly some much needed awkward automotive humor.
Topgear meets Impractical Jokers. Painful.
Dennis needs to be on vinwiki
Oh hey. That's Wylie Texas. Neat.
I love how you guys stole the format of top gear for this...
Don't be fooled, this series is only gonna be on YouTube until a big production company buys these guys out like they hope... #SellOuts
This video is why people have add block. If anyone wanted this many mid roll adds we would pay for cable.
Keep up the good times guys.  Never gets old.
These guys just completely copied top gear
Hardcore classic Top Gear vibes! Love it!
wiiiiiizzzzzaaaarddddd wizzzzzarrrrrd
Ferarri 400i sobbing in the corner
Oh look, Youtube's TopGear lol
All 3 are beautiful in their own way-!
great presentation
Brought to you by Carl's Jr...
Ed consistently ruins the show
No Dinos? Shocked
Never seen Dennis in anything before, but I like that guy 😂
its really nostalgic feels like im watching the top gear or grand tour
The reminiscent refrigerator descriptively peel because nation karyologically curl pro a absent cafe. curved, square nest
Hopefully you don't get a cease and desist
Top gear
I knew this video would need a Hoovie! I was just waiting for him to pop in
History Channel made an ass of Top Gear, you 3... academy...wait car show award!!! Awesome edit
Hey can we just take a moment of silence for Stradman’s loss he just lost his father a few days ago
You should be paying Top Gear copyrights.
Lol, I love Ed. I like the way he thinks.
22:29
Is it me or tavarish looks like pop smoke from Wish
Watched this in my sweet vinwiki tee. Feelin perrrttyyy good about Ed's chances. Suckaaass
14:33 what is a murci-el-ago... hmm maybe that is right pronunciation... been saying murcie-lago all these years.
The 599 is so pretty
He's owned 40 of them...he's 50+ year old. That means he hasn't owned any of them for long enough to consider it long term.
Ngl like American top gear
Who else near Dallas and can’t find no fucking car to buy
Finally a new Car Trek
I don't like the cheating..that's why the old top gear will always be better
37:39 FINALLY! Someone pronounces Murcielago correctly. Ferraris are named after famous Spanish bulls. Murcielago means bat in Spanish.
Its the general maintenance cost that should deter most from buying a Ferrari...
Y did y’all use a lambo v10 sound for the Ferrari intro 💀
Im blown away at how good this was. Laughed my ass off
Can cartrek get me a gold chocobo, that I may achieve access to the rare 'wizard' summon?
Guys are pretty corny
Ed cheated so everything he says or does is invalid in my opinion.
Hoovie's Ferrari looks like a Ford Probe.
"It was delivered to South Vietnam" "No wonder why I like it so much"
I literally had that 599 gtb on my wishlist on auto tempest and i go to look at it because I wanted to show my dad and it said sold and i was like wait didn’t Ed bolian just buy a 599 and thats the exact one i had on my list lmao
599 wins no need to do anything else LOL
seeing those Porsches sitting around, they need to live again
Continually impressed how the timing, delivery, and quality has gone up each season. Thoroughly entertained!
I knew this series would evolve and get better. Way to go guys
Is this some walmart topgear wannabe?
Young men with car lust and money.  They will out grow it. If they are lucky.
This is the real new top gear
Hooptie came on the scene and I felt at home is that wierd ...
You guys are so interesting. :)
I know you are trying to copy Top Gear but it really feels just like a copy that doesn´t really get there. I´d rather have you guys something more original but still cool.
The educated bench lally hate because hydrogen feraly deceive an a well-off sociology. plain, ruddy innocent
Can you guys just do car trek forever please? Never stop. It’s amazing
love me
456GT cost me a fortune and my athletic career, 3 months in the hospital and 10 operations...
Tyler, why did it hurt me when you drove through a puddle during your entrance.
About Nov 20 2020 I was on an E-bay auction for a 1982 Ferrari 308 GTSi and was out bid then I recieved an e-mail that the person who won the auction had backed out. To my suprise my bid was accepted as winner [$40,000 Usd] ,I won by mistake ok I emailed the owner that I would fly out with the money/insurance the next day and I wanted to drive the car back to Florida from Scottsdale Az so get the car checked since it had been sitting for 30 years! Yes I drove it back with the only problem being ,No turn lites/Speedometer and a oil leak,It managed to out distance all commers except an new AMG mercedese! I still drive it every day!!!
How I wish I could afford that 308.  8^)
I'd take a camry thank you. I'd like a peace of mind for the next 7 years.
308 looks sick af
So coool and C.Wizzard, too..whole pack !! Gorgeous ((:
screw the Ferrari's, i want those Porsches
Collins brothers jeep isnt a graveyard! To us weird jeep cultists its heaven 😍
I remember when you could pick up a tidy 308 or 356 for around £20k. Can't find either for near that price anymore. My dad sold a 308 quatrovalve which was the most powerful varient for around that price and was picked up on an old transit flatbed at the time 😂 The only cheap ferrari is still the mondial
I'd trade a sorted S6 V10 for one of these....  :D
Those cars are 3 "headache" 🤦‍♂️
You just want to buy hoovies when his next one burns to the ground
at 0:01 I was expecting this to be a video about the quirks and features of a road.
I love the 308s - they just look amazing.
Good lord and Francis that 456 is ugly
I will be sending AutoTempest a cleaning bill for my computer due to the drink explosion that followed the Hooters waitress line. I am going to need an on-screen prompt to swallow 10 seconds before any of Ed's one-liners. Please and thank you.
Congrats on both episodes hitting trending at the same time!!!
Top Gear knock off
If I got to pick a superpower and it could be either flying or Ed's ability to negotiate car deals, I would stay grounded.
I get the Clarkson, Hammond, and May comparison but I think it is more of a Hangover trio - Bradley Cooper (Ed), Ed Helms (Tyler), and Zach Galiafinakis (Freddy)
9:00 LOOK, 4 CAMRYS!
Yes! Wizard summoned in a storage container lol
Correct me if I'm wrong but shouldnt a ferrari for japan market be a right hand drive car?
Really? That was the smallest steak ever, not Texas approved. Hehe
Ladies and gentlemen I present to you the new *Top gear*
Tavarish got my fucking dream ferrari.
Not the wiring sticking out from below the steering wheel in the 308 HAHAHAH
I considered buying that particular 599, but now I’m glad I didn’t! The door issues could indicate unibody damage so the car needs to be put on a frame rack to find out. The dash will probably be just the first of many electrical problems that will occur over time as a result of corrosion from the flooding. Good luck.
Definitely a Top Gear wannabe, but i'm not mad at it.
When the wizard got ready for Freddy's car he turned into my dad
My dream would be the f12 berlinetta
Anyone notice the hood vents on the 308 changed colors from the intro to the first on road sequence?
A million views on this guys video?  Lots of idiots out there I guess.  This guy and his channel are total headline bait, but a buck can be made on the zombie masses i suppose.  Probably same people who buy and wear sports jerseys. 🧟‍♂️      The Wizard is the only one that actually gives sound advice and I'll keep watching his videos for tips and tricks.
the cost effective solution to the seat sensor is buying one of those bypass resistors on ebay for $10 - if you crash it'll blow both side's airbags needlessly, but at least the cost is deferred / hopefully never occurs
Doing what Uk 🇬🇧 Top Gear did 15 years ago oh well glad to see you have caught up to us 😜👍
@25:32 So that's why the wizard bought a new boat "for here and now"
I'm surprised neither of them got a Mondial, probably the cheapest Ferrari about, because no one likes them. :P  Kinda why I like them, If I had more money than what I knew what to do with, I'd love doing a restomod on a Mondial, modern suspension, modernizing the engine, modern drivetrain, make it work like a more modern car pretty much. :)
I like Tavarishs Ferrari the most. Don't care about the price. And it's red.
What a blatant copy of Top Gear! You suck.
You have stolen Top Gear and the Grand Tour's ideas and then you repeat yourself over and over again. Your videos are weak.
ok i understand they wanted to make something like GranTour or old Top Gear it is a good try really but not enough  and it is once more a copy with same B roles , scenarios and talks etc. it doesnt give something original or innovativeor something to laugh.
At 15:16 he is on fm544 that intersection is where i work lol
New top gear guys *cough*
We need Cleetus McFarland on this show!!
OG Ferraris
Top gear (tavarsh version)
"Ooh, Ed Vision"  "Yes, it makes everything look cheaper"  🤣
Very polished episode.  You guys are definitely getting good at this.
I love you so much and so does Jesus its not to late to turn to God and be forgiven please repent and seek God he's coming back very soon GodBless💙✝️
My favorite part of Car Trek is always when the Wizard shows up. The worst part of Car Trek 1 was no Wizard.
Please, please... Please! Try stepping out of the Top Gear stereotype (you are constantly using lines from their scripts) and make something of your own. You clearly have what it takes to make it work without being wrong mods of the Clarkson, May and Hammond formula. We already have the original Top Gear to go back to, we don't need a newer version of that (not even from them). We need something new. You can do it. Do that, please do.
Yo this some top gear ⚙️.
Keep it up guys
Netflix or Hulu need to sign you guys on!! I am all in!
You did a really good job on this video I wish it wasn’t so top gear like and more original, I feel like I’m watching a better version of the American show though since you guys are better hosts so props on that.
Question of the century. “Will Tavarish ever comb his hair?”
Woot, another Car Trek !  😁
This format seems oddly familiar...
Please do a jeep car trek
“Something made by the most recognizable brand on earth” didn’t know McDonalds made cars too.
Top gear kinda vibes LOVE IT
So they spent under $50k for each car?
"This is a road" no shit Sherlock
I get the good old top gear vibes and I love it
Why does this video look under-saturated?
This is by far better than the merican version of Top Gear (probably cause I've watched all your channels at some point) but. Hammond, James and Jeremy are freakin amazing together on what ever show they make. This is 1 click under JJH in my humble idiotic opinion.
The 456, I did not like as a kid, but I want one NOW.... more so with that manual transmission! As I have gotten older, the Ferraris of my childhood have become more beautiful, and I now understand them. I would take pretty much ANY old Ferrari over modern ones however.
Châu chấu, những dòng sông nước chảy như máu, bệnh dịch, hạn han, lủ lụt, các điềm lạ, động đất.., là báo hiệu tận thế
LOL @ 16:54 - just drop the positive lead in that water :D
Feels like topgear so sick love these episodes u do like this kel them coming
Are they copying the top gear formula?
Yees
Anyone else think they broke their phone screen, only to realize it was a tiny tavarish face?? Hahaha
Please check what @andersondick made with his in Atlanta
I like the 308
I'm going to stand up and said Ed didn't cheat... He's just a better salesman the the other two.
Wylie Texas baby!!!
Why am I watching this?  I’m a Lamborghini, Ford and virtually anything else fan.
I request buying famous JDM cars and drifting them.
too scripted, feels like a discovery channel show they would play replays of on a Tuesday at 1 am... Id like to see the be more natural less tv personalty'yy
Where’s the Ford? You said the most recognizable brand on earth. Subaru is better than Ferrari in my opinion.
Dayuuuuummmmm
How pathetic try to copy The trinity...  it doesn’t go any lower than that
While I agree with Ed about actually wanting to own the car, he totally missed the point and loses!
Awesome fun show 👍
I only see one red car, so only one Ferrari on this show for me.
Dude the intro reminded me of top gear
Let's just say, If BBC hired you guys to replace Hammond, May and Clarkson after the departure, I'd still be watching it.
Guys this show would be much better if you put away trying to copycat Top Gear every 30 seconds.
This is by far what the American top gear should of been from the start! Great job guys, love it!
I'm pissed I missed the premier. Well better late than never.
Love these videos reminiscent of the Clarkson era Top Gear cheap car challenge episodes
“When mum says we have Ferraris at home”
I love it but the cheating needs to stop. What Hoovie did kinda works but I want to see really weird cars the price forces you to get. Not a shit version of an obvious choice.
too bad these guys fail to understand that it is not about getting nice cars, having something old and halfway broken I wahy more interesting to watch that something sorted or 2x the price than  it supposed to be
16:12 sounds like a V10 to me ?!?
Why does Freddy has to have the shitiest vehicle every damn time ? 🙂
I'm 2 seconds in and I've already learned so much. Thanks guys!
americans overate ferrari... Its a sht car.
A brand new Toyota Camry is only like $25k 🤣
Stop putting so many f*cking ads on the video. I’ve had the video stop 3 times in less than 6 minutes. I mean come on!
"I can't wait"
This is great. It reminds me of the old top gear challanges
The twat that traded the lambo for the ferrari has just ruined the whole video
Wow just a great copy of TopGear good job.
Better than the grand tour.
Its time for tavarish to shave his head. There is no shame in it bro.
I'm watching Top Gear Budget Supercar episode.
Great
It’s quality like this that is getting me through this damn pandemic! Well done gents!
This is crap T was the only one who got a Ferrari for the price of a Camry..
I wouldn’t pay 25k even for a Camry..
I was expecting something worse than y’all got, like the SF1000
26:28 yoo what song is that
Edvision - makes everything look dryer
I'm surprised no on bought a 348
Top gear part 2?
Better than the new so called *TopGear*
what kind of top gear is this?
When is the rotary going to in the Ferrari 456
This gives me top gear vibes.    A lot of Top gear vibes
The convo reminds me of OG top gear, good work!
I don’t think I would trade a Lamborghini and still pay $40 000 for a Toyota Camry.
Ed should buy that Jag!!!!
Wylie, Tx in this bitch!!
Wiiiiizard!!!!!!!!
Ed has a consistent theme. He tends to gravitate to drenched vehicles.
Next episode tell Ed the budget is half of what it actually is haha
Who are you the irs. Why is that funny lol.
The quality of cartrek is increasing significantly with new seasons, the video quality and tavarish presentation and voice over is now on next level
40K for a flooded pony, what a rip off
Now I understand why Wizard tastes the car's leaks... It's part of the foreplay
Most of the time the Airbag light will just be the plug under the seat, cut it out and join the wires.
Finally had a second to give this a watch and I am hooked as usual! Disappointed that Ed cheated but that just means next time you guys make sure he gets something very under budget ;)
Autotempest really knows how to market themselves...
This needs to be on network television guys
If you can't afford a new one, you can't afford a used one.
Oh wow you guys were right down the street from me!
Love it
"I can take off the rack off and send if off to be rebuilt". Yeah, how'd that go with Hoovie's Diablo?
Who else remembers Christie Brinkley in the movie Vacation.  Remember what her license plate read?  So hot!
I can, and I did.
T...you rocking that James from Good Times🙌🏽
3:57 damnnn😂
Wonder if Ed's loafers are monogramed
The purple on that Pista is gorgeous. Reminds me of the midnight purple Nissan paint. But that 308 looks like someone wired an HP 12C into the dash and turned the console into an Atari 2600 with all those toggles.
Damn to see a YouTube make basically a top gear segment is insane. This is great to see. Keep up the work guys!
Today, on Akward Gear...
The cars are all great in their own ways, but how handsome is Dennis?  Does the man have the secret to external youth or something? haha
I love this but Jesus, you don’t have to copy EXACTLY how top gear used to film those shots and write the dialogue
I saw the 599 out at ATL caffeine and octane. Beautiful!
Next car trek should be vintage jags just cause:)
why are they copying top gear?
I’ll take those cheap ferraris any day no matter how broken
Great content! Love the fact that the gang is together! I installed a clutch in a 308, and it was literally the easiest clutch job ever! Pull the left rear tire - and there it is!
Meh, turned it off after seeing them doing the same thing yet again, purchase a car that cost as much as X, first test is to inspect it. It's the same thing every season.
We need a shirt that says "Tyler wiiiiiiins"
Classic mustang, classic jag, classic porsche....and a 99 mercury cougar. One of these isn't like the others.
Literally a Top Gear copy....  And I enjoyed it hahahaha.
Holy crap Ed cheated so hard.
Ed needs to try to get sponsored  by "A touch of gray" 🤣🤣🤣
This was great guys.  Completely redeems the cringe worthy attempts at humour in previous episodes...
We wanted Tom selleck or Christy Brinkley. Instead, we got Tavarish.
Who doesn't have a 308 as their dream ferrari?!  It's the prettiest ferrari, period 😉
Fuck .. the ads
Top gear style
Still choosing the 78 308 gtb.... Just love the car. Would trade my supra and aw11 for this car in good shape
Tyler weens
If they ever decide to take another crack at a Top Gear USA, these three need to be the hosts. I never had a problem with the concept of a Top Gear USA, but the three guys they had hosting it (Tanner in particular) just didn't have the kind of chemistry that you need to make a show like that work.
a 599 GTB is my Bitcoin dream.
“It’s a feature not a bug“😂
Ahahaha  wizards shop in international waters
So too nuts?
Y’all don’t know how much a Camry REALLY costs 😂
How do you search UAE using Autotempest like Tyler?
ohhh how I've missed Car Trek
Wizard needs a starring role in this series if it continues.
I live in Dallas.  Oddly enough my thumbnail is in front of a Ferrari at that same track!!  My Ferrari was we rented for a few laps though but I didn’t have to pay for 16k in maintenance either :)
Huge thanks Ed's Grandma for having intercourse! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Is this topgear..?
..
Dennis Collins makes an appearance too?  Classic!
Dennis Collins uses Ed Bolian math.
This seems very similar to a segment that a certain bbc show used to do
You guys are Top Gear quality and i mean , James , Jeremy and Richard quality.
Really makes me miss Jeremy and James and Richard.
Literally top gear And I like it
That was awesome
For a second I thought that 308 GTB was a 288 GTO lol, never realised just how similar they are in terms of looks.
That color of the 488 in the beginning.....*chef's kiss*
I thought you'd all be driving iPhones when you said "most recognizable brand on earth"
Ferrari->Sort By Cheapest->Buy Now. What can possibly go wrong?
TOP GWAR VYBES 🤣🤣🤣🤣
man I can't believe y'all were in Texas, let alone in North Dallas! Come on now I wish I could have met up
0:28 sounds like a BMW S85 V10 engine... LOL
The wizard is awesome but I was low key hoping Aaron Kaufman would pop up as the mechanic for this episode.
LS swap the red Ferrari that'd be awesome
the star here is CarWizard lmao
What is up with your hair, just shave it off at that point lol
I love it.2 of my favorite youtubers
Holy shit that Paul Walker joke 🤣 36:36
Why the  vinwiki guy? Whyyyyyyyyy. What an over acting YouTube hack. Come on
I wasn’t on mute on zoom for school when the wizard said “I want to make love to this car.” Needless to say, multiple people in the chat could only assume what I was “watching”
Tavarish really be balding kinda bad
good gawd all this forced bitching is so cringe
This snow is so pointless but I can’t get enough lol
Shenanigans
i live an hour from dallas
except...one of you didnt...& blew the whole thing...*yuck*
This reminds me of the old top gear in all of the best ways
You guys should be the new top gear trio. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk
35:44 That shit caught me off guard😂🤣😂🤣
Better than top gear USA
Tbh Ed totally cheated badly
You should do some jdm content kinda like this but coal into diamond stuff.
For the price of a Toyota Camry they got cars they can act like snobs in. Do they need a Name like Ferrari on their cars to enjoy them? I just don't get it.
i have a giant "deja Vu" now take it to the "STIG" but please take a detour across Bolivia. love the show guys. still think i never can effort a Ferrari nor a Toyota Camry. though i do own a '77 Toyota Carina TA14. but that looks like it's flooding from the inside out. it's literally watering the grass around it. pretty concerning due the fact it's actually parked on a pavement parking lot.
I think this show beats Hoovies show as the DUMBEST You Tube automotive channel.
Top Gear from Wish
Literally my three favorite Ferraris
Good new top gear
Copy of Top Gear.And,it's bad one...
It would be hilarious if they all pulled up to Scotty Kilmore’s house in one of the treks to have him attach his fancy $5K scan tool to their cars and say what’s up with each and how much of an endless money pit they will be!   Fun stuff guys!
Genuine Ferrari’s are Red, Tavarish wins 😏
The 456GT is a beautiful car in my opinion.
This is Walmart great value top gear/grand tour
I was going to say that this series punches way above its weight, but I realized I always liked what these three guys do on their own channels.  Thanks to all three and AutoTempest for making this possible.
Oh my that 60’s Mustang fastback 🤤🤤 my dream car
Top Gear vibes anyone?
Funny that he says especially the fuel now lol. In the uk cars are breaking down at petrol stations because water is mixed with the fuel 😅😭😂
Heh, going to Dennis' place to have Wizard do a once over of the cars.
Bfg radial t/a's on a 308 is a travesty. So are Ed's tight jeans
Just shave the hair off name.. not looking good
P p I’,, this
top gear did this first , nice to c it keep going
Do a jeep theme next l
Eds explanation of a flood car to the Wizard was priceless
I'm at 1/4 of the way through the video, and the 308 wins. I'm sorry, but if all 3 were offered for free? I'd take the 308.
That 308 is awesome.  Front engine Ferraris are just expensive GTs.
Ah at last the show I’ve been waiting
nah thats a ford gt
YESSSS Best car series in YouTube
Thanks for telling us what a road is! I would never know.
This still is the only Top Gear like show I enjoy. Well done you three
Such a great video!
Tavarish your haircut is terrible. Smh. LMAO
LMAO  - _"Like your grandmother saying intercourse"_
Freddie's DIY means call Jared to come overr.
Me: Mom i want grand tour. Mom: we have grand tour at home. Grand tour at home :
Ed is Jeremy  Tyler is Richard  Freddy is James
0:23 "Something made by the most recognizable brand on earth" Wait?!? Coca-Cola makes cars?
As far as I'm concerned Tavarish has already won because he's the only one that actually bought a Ferrari for the cost of a Camry.
ah yes the ali express top gear
When Weezard went Magnum PI, the soundtrack went Airwolf. Either way, I re-lived my childhood for like 5 seconds. This show gets better every season!
3 dorks fighting over who gets to be Clarkson.
That 456 is so effing ugly! Every time it shows it at the right angle it looks just like the latest generation Montecarlo
the strong point of this show are the jokes, they really make me laugh :)
Nice work guys! This feels a lot less scripted /acted than the first series. Or you're just more comfortable with scripts, either way. Also, it's crazy how small the 308 is compared to the other two, not to mention truly modern Ferraris. It's still my favorite Ferarri shape, even if this particular one is a bit rough.
Finally!!!
Borderline unwatchable with this number of ads
Hoovie's is absolutely the ugliest Ferrari I've ever seen. Not close to worth loosing the reliability of a brand new Toyota, and still have a stack of cash left over.
Another Car Trek series?!?! Ooh boy, here we go again :) This is what you three will be remembered for. Thank you guys so much!
Why is there a huracan sound track sometimes instead of the Ferrari all the time?
OMG MY FAVORITE CAR SHOW IS BACK YESSSS!!!!!
This is so much better than Top Gear US.
dennnnnnnniiiiiisssssss get you some of that woooooooohhhhh
Don't ever put grandmother and intercors in the same sentence please!!!!!!
The constant sponsor mentions in this make it feel uniquely American.
I was so tempted to buy my second car as a Ferrari f355 found a yellow one and a red one bother under 25k didnt buy them because of the upkeep cost still wish I bought them tho
I really hate how this is a ferrari series and they decide to use lambo huracan rev sounds in the beginning. Compulsive ocd on full send
It’s finally back
That 308gtb would be my choice.  Especially since it doesn't have the US bumpers
308 is the best.  The 308 is a steal at current prices. That car has got to go up, it's iconic, it's beautiful, and it has to be one of the most recognizable Ferrari's ever made.
599 all the way, flood or not. Repairs are Ferrari  money  though
Camry is infinitely more reliable.
Always wizard is the best part of car trek... WIZAAAAAARD..
This is my first episode and not 10 minutes in it just oozes top gear vibes. Love it that Tavarish gets to role play as Clarkson’s Florida cousin.
Nice nod to Top Gear!
411 manual
I've spent so much money with Collins Brothers over the years....
that 308 is actually very cool
Gotta love The Wizard's new Beard-doo.....the color is a cross between "Bugs Bunny Carrot" and "Orange Jesus".
This is by far the best car trek when it comes to quality, script and post you've ever made. You guys have killed it! Well done!
I'm kinda confused. Is this like Top Gear?
holy shit the production quality went up
is this just a rip off of Top Gear?
Love how it's almost like the old top gear ⚙
I really like that 308. I'm no fan of Ferrari but a 308 is a Ferrari I want to have. Hope I can get my hands on it someday!
I love this, but I wish the dialog was less scripted
"Tyler, you have an ugly Ford Probe." ROFL!
The 308 is the one.  From a million miles away, you know that's a FERRARI.
These guys easily have the same magic as the Top Gear boys.  Love em. Thank you Auto Tempest!
Try to find your style, dont try to be TopGear
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do these things, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  .   You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make.   Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Boring, top gear rip off, poor script, and Ed is too smug and annoying
Lol they didn't even mention all the stuff the wizard worked on before hand, on Tyler's car when they added everything up..... I think that should have been added in
initially i thought that some ad is coming and i was searching for skip button
Really confused by all the random Lamborghini V10 sounds playing throughout the video
I love this Show so so so much ❤️
308 is by far the coolest...
My favorite Ferraris are the FR layouts, GT coupes.
It’s always great to see the Wizard on these. Great episode guys!
Thanks, I’d take any old vintage race car instead.
Why not actually follow the price rules?  If you can't find 3 under the price of Camrys, raise it to $60,000, or just go with the 3 cheapest that you could find?  Every time it's the same recipe, buy 3 cars and spend half the time talking about someone cheating or actually following the rules.
Reactions from Ed rolling up and his comment had me dying 😂😂
Huracan exhaust for a pista???? Why? Pista’s already sound good....
Soon 2 million bro!!!!!!!
When someone says Ferrari then the 308 is what most people are thinking about so in spirit Tavarish is the winner in my book sorry Tyler and the other guy is disqualified lol.
he should have bought 60,000$ worth of colombian cocaine,.. flew it into the states and traded it for a ferrari enzo,..  he obviously cheated,.
DENNIS COLLINS!!!! I knew it when Ed mentioned the Mustang having been in Vietnam. I remember that find!
It's Asphalt not Ass Felt.You Americans are hillarious.Jagwaar.Color,tires Astun Martun etc.For fuck sake you don't speak English."Ass Felt".
Tavarish have you never seen a vintage Ferrari ? They all were front engine rear drive cars primarily V12 front engine rear drive cars based on racing cars simply tarted up a bit to make them street legal and useable .Mid engine Ferrari's are a 1970's thing like a lot of ideas from the 70's questionable at best . Which you'll find out about once you spend the cost of your car trying to fix it .
Finally, proper "cheap car" challenges!  Edit: until someone ruins it by cheating...
This is so much better than the Grand Tour 😃
I’ve always loved 456 Ferrari
old top gear vibes.... LOVE IT. plz do more of these
BUUUUUUULLLLLLLL SHIT.....
Love that blue color
Freddy let the hair goooooooo!!
its kinda ruined because we already knew what car they had all bought
Ed is hilarious! Well done guys!
That Ferrari has the best spec I have ever seen Edit: the one in the intro
To be fair a fully loaded, accessoried, top-level trim Camry is $40 MSRP.... Who is buying that kind of Camry I have no idea but you could.
Now thats what i call am original format!
This looks like it was filmed in Bryan/College Station, Waco or North Austin.....
AutoTempest has Chad status tbh.
Hmmm maybe the new cast for top gear I'm just saying
I would be funny if the next Car Trek Freddy breaks the rules once but this time there are consequences 🤣🤣🤣 But he deserves leniency  Tyler gave him a shit car in December and before that everything was ass for him
so weird seeing wylie in this, I grew up there and seeing the stores I drove past every day delivering pizzas or getting food in murphy is just odd to me
Turbo charged Ferrari's are trash
This was actually quite hilarious...the banter is on point 🙌😅
22:30 same
Strangely the 308 is by far the prettiest one !
To quote Scotty Kilmer, "Endless Money Pits!"
With as many electrical problems that red farreri has you would think it was a built in great britian instead of italy.
S5 When?
Is it 3 Ferrari's combined for the price of a Camry or 3 Ferrari's that are each less than or equal to a Camry?
456 is the only manual Ferrari I would run.
The 308 is the only choice of the 3. easy to repair (without the need for a PHD)
those cars are so good looking i wish to buy one
ferrari is so sexy
I love this series. You guys are so much fun to watch.
ferrari is far from the most recognizable brand on earth.
Ed’s is a beast !
The problem with these is it's not really like the old top gear, part of the fun of the show. Was they were given a stupidly low amount of money, or something. Then we're told to try and find a car within that price range, and then could only fix said car what basic tools to keep it goin. Like when they did the super car challenge, they only got 10 grand to buy a Italian super car. I would love to see you guys do something like that.
Haha! Wizards completely straight face when saying “I could make love to this car.” & “I won’t. But I could.” Was completely hilarious! Love that guy!
Just missing Jay and Doug. And we have Our dream top gear.  sooo close to perfection.
"...frankly, its your only choice." well said.
The 456 started boring and aged into boring so i guess they nailed it.
This is an exact copy of top gear.. Try and be a little original. This is just a rip off.
lovely 308 LoL
Cannot believe you were just a couple of miles from me!!!
I enjoy the series, but why do you keep going for more and more expensive cars... I get you want to keep them, but you are getting further and further away from the old top gear road trips. Please have a look at the adventure with wagons (BMW 5, Subaru Impreza and Volvo 850R) in Africa and reignite the flame of what you should try to emulate :)
Sorry Freddy but Porsche is the most recognizable because they have looked the same forever
TOP GEAR  WHAT
ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˡᶦᵏᵉˢ ᵃⁿᵈ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ
ED Bolian: "thats his standard operating procedure" i am so dead LOL
ED"s Glassed Makes Everything Look Cheaper WOW
Best 37 min commercial
Tyler won
People complain about this ripping off Top Gear....... who cares! These challenges were the best thing about TG and the more the merrier. Great video 👍
Bruh make an episode for normal people to see what Ferrari they can afford. Too bad the guys here forget what normal was.. and how much a fucking camry is. So how does a normal person buy a used car for 40gs fuck outta here
Love the Wizards ion this and Dennis Collins place
37:18 our men Jared on the credits 🤙
You made it on the youtube trending list!  Currently 34th!  good job boys!
I wait every day for a new one of these. WHO is not giving you guys your own tv show???? It would pretty much dump Top Gear America and possibly even the BBC version into the tank.
Am I the only one noticing the resemblance here, #ClassicTopGear #GrandTour 😉
Tyler did call turd to a Ferrari? Savage
Very Top Gear opening.
The wiki guy always showing off
Whens episode 2 out ???
As a 31 year old man. This brings back og top gear.
Pininfarina it's a thing, but i preffer the original Mr. Enzo Ferrari
OMG Tav you nailed it! Dude love that Ferrari man you have a piece of motor enginering history right there, enjoy my bro!
OMG! First time seeing this channel. Total Top Gear knock off. And not a very good one. Try something original. It's sorely needed.
TV quality posting top gear ? :-)
Huge thanks to Freddy, tyler and Ed for letting us have a show like this to watch. Absolutely top tier entertainment
The most relevant video of the week (17secs): https://youtu.be/mZJJONhvj0U
Basically another american ripoff of top gear and the grand tour
How are cars so cheap in the US wtf???
That 308 has such a beautiful shape. Along with the 328 and 348, it has always defined Ferrari for me.
I worked on that 599GTB. That dealer is right down the road from me.
Tavarish has the best looking car
WIZARD!
The most interesting thing I've seen in this video was that nice red mercury cougar. Yeah I'm a much simpler person...
The Car Wizard makes this episode. Really excited to see the next one!
This is like a top gear ripoff but it's good nonetheless
Fake shtick “host” shows are unbearable anymore.
Old top gear format.
My fav car show
HEY GUYS CHRIS FIX SENT ME HERE!
Peace. Love. Car Wizard.❤️❤️

Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust?

SHMee is the missing link.
Amazing that Tavarish follows the rules but the other two never do. I wonder why.
Agonising Top Gear rip off
Love your video. I was confused for a minute. Did I click the Top Gear USA ? Lol
i also bought a new car on gta daytona classic :P
Soo ur just ripping iff too gear format EXACTLY ? Ok cool. Also your hair. Just get rid of it.
Great show!
The only 4 nerds I watch on YouTube
I am thoroughly surprised no one bought a Mondial if the challenge was a cheap Ferrari.
I always get old top gear feelings watching car trek
I love that Dennis Collins and Collins Brothers was included in this series. Car Trek is absolutely my favorite. Keep up the amazing work you three.
Wish it wasn’t so scripted. The reason people love your channels is because of the realness factor.
YOOO THIS IS THE REAL NEW TOP GEAR
ADS ARE OUTTA CONTROL!! 5:34 INTO VID AND ALREADY HAD 3 AD BREAKS.. ILL HAVE TOTAL COUNT AT THR END
The next episode LoL 😂 I’m already laughing ..... hot guy pose LoL what!!!! And of course track time “no no no” LoL
Finding any car in Australia cheap these days is impossible.  Covid tax can be upto 30% more for a used car .
It's an expensive fiat that's all it is.  Poor engineering lots of oil leaks. He should of gotten a Nissan gtr or Acura nsx.
2 V12 Ferrari's and 1 V8 Dino.  Tavarish already lost..😂
please stop the corny behaviour was good otherwise
Copy topgear
When is episode 2 coming???
Leave them in the Scrapper !
Need to do one of these challenges where it's actually proven that you can buy all of the cars for the prices quoted. Like several of them available on the market or it just isn't as fun
Ed out here finessing my dream car for Camry money makes me think “Ahhh someday!”
Never knew action bronson had a twin brother..
I've been anxiously awaiting this one.  Freddie... if you really wanted to buy a cheap Ferrari, why didn't you get a Mondial?
Yes finally the best car series on youtube is back. Thanks boys once again
Trade a diablo for a flood damaged Ferrari, what a legend
Were do you get this money,  can't even afford a hse deposit yet ,you guys buy cars every month..
This is The Grand Tour U.S. You guys should arrange a film with Clarkson,Hammond and May.
Tav! Help me get a car!
This is beginning to feel like the start of this generation's Top Gear.
New Season YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!
LETS GOOOO
This show gets better and better
Now I understand why Wizard tastes the car's leaks... It's part of the foreplay
Tavarish looks a bit Chungus. A diet is not a bad idea my dude
0:25 I can’t forgive you for playing revs from a Lamborghini huracan while showing a Ferrari pista and saying it’s the most recognizable brand
Wow, you are actually a very good narrator.
Honestly if I had 100k I'd buy a MP4-12C
Outstanding show, better than UK top gear The Grand Tour and American Top Gear. Same recipe at all the above mentioned shows with cheaper ingredients but tastes way better.  Millions of $ don't always make things good, as quite a few of you have seen with the Grand Tour. You three guys and the collective team have brought us 3 previous outings and each one could easily have been shown on a major networks  channel so you guys have the extra ingredient that the others don't and that's the friendship you had before doing this all the others have became friends because of the shows and the length of time they had worked together on the shows. Well done and im so looking forward to this series.
Finally why isn't episode 2 3 and 4 oit
Autotempest sounds like the perfect place to buy junk from.
I'd have the 456GT, In fact, a year ago I looked at a very similar one, though it was a 456M GTA, but still, beautiful car!
Tavarish Gear?
OMFG IT'S HOOVIE THE DUMBEST AUTOMOTIVE CHANNEL IN ALL OF YOU TUBE! LEGEND damn and we also got car wizard we got all 4 legends lmao
The wizard was summoned
Yess Dennis Collins shop 🙌
The roles are on point
im more worried of where the market is.....a 308 or atleast this one was like 10-15k serviced
It would be cool if next season you each had a fixed cash budget with no shenanigans. It's just not that entertaining pitting an 80k car against a 30k shitbox.
Pro tip regarding the passenger airbag issue: if it's just the seat sensor that's broken, you can either hardwire it or program it so that it assumes the sensor is always triggered (Aka a person is on the seat).  That just means the airbag will go off regardless if a passenger is there, but that's a safe, cheap way to fix it.
Honestly love the idea of you guys doing this show but it's sorta predictable of how the show goes, one person gets the super shitty car that's on par with the rules, one that gets a super good deal for a car, then one that just doesn't even really follow the rules
Now I understand why Wizard tastes the car's leaks... It's part of the foreplay
Straight up top gear rip off
Most recognizable brand on the planet. You mean General Motors?
I really wanted to see a trashy 400i and a Mondial here.....
Finally!!!
Very nice episode! Keep it up!
This is going TopGear quality
That cougar looked so out of place 🤣
All this to get smoked by a Honda with a passenger that has a laptop in his lap....
Thank you for the fun entertainment
Enzo said the horse doesn't push the carriage. Ferraris are supposed to be front-engined.
awwww the guy with the 308, That's a real car, nothing is wrong with it driving. You just have to be real with it.
This Should be a netflix series
Lamborghini is better
Wow man I met your doppelganger in San Diego county jail two weeks ago.
Tavarish holds the belt for worst haircut💪🏼 Reigning champ
Love it!
very glad the wizard is getting camera used, but still keeps it awkward ;P
Tav LOOKS like a million bucks.  Period.
No Ferrari is reliable let's get that straight
I feel sorry for you Freddie, you take the rules & do your best to follow them in the strictest manor & buy the funest shitbox possible. Tyler always has a car(d) up his sleeve but you're both outgunned by the Master of The Deal, Ed who has secret connections. LoL. <<Mark in Ohio>>
Love that you guys are on another epic road trip
I'd love to see one season of AutoTrek with nothing but Rotaries. 🔺️
Nice
Intro: this is a road  Me: NAHHH FRRR?!?!?!?
Freddie please get a haircut
Why there looking at the jag when there’s a mint fastback mustang right next to it 😭
Getting some real Top Gear/ Grand Tour vibes!
I love Top Gear and Grand Tour, my mom too lmao but she doesnt understand english so i turn on subtitles and then i use the translate function, didnt work really well but she loved the show! cant wait for part 2 ❤️
I wish Doug would be part of the group on these journeys. His view would give a different perspective haha
I love how this series incorporates the best aspects of each youtubers channel. We’ve got the car wizard and Jared and hopefully the car ninja (my personal fav). Well Done Auto Tempest, well done!!
A comedy show occasionally about cars.
Only if this was Top Gear USA.
More than you can afford pal
This feels like knock off Top Gear but without the funny...
This is the best tv anywhere !
26:12 that should be printed in one of ur shirt man 😎
21:42 I differ, figs flavor to be more precise 😂
Rather have the 308 GTB. Just an old school guy.
they need to buy Ferraris for the price of a 4th gen mustang
THIS...is a road....cheap shot. Now THIS....is a Ferrari. Cheaper shot.
I'm going to treat all the streets around me as my personal playground.
Here comes YouTube's Hammond, May, and lastly Clarkson
This is very entertaining, and the production is great
I could make love to it also 😂
I'm so glad Wizard flirtation towards Ed's Ferrari made the edit, twice.
Ed's car is cheeper than an Camry in Singapore.
My dream car is a 308 because my dad had one while I was growing up and he did all the right things to make it the Ferrari that it should be
FREDDY KEEP THAT THING!!!!
Contrary to what Ed said. I love the 308.  Would be a dream for me to own?
You guys reminds me of Top Gear! Keep up the good work guys!!!!
No trade ins
this reminds me  of top gear
"Something made by the most recognizable brand on Earth."  Coca-Cola?
Ed cheated.. love you Ed. Lol but I had to call you out lol. Just watched your upload
ed cheated. but it resulted in lulz. so its okay.
I like how this is a video all about Ferrari and in the first 30 seconds during the cinematic they use Lamborghini Huracan sounds 😂😂
What a wanker not sticking to the rules, just fucked the whole thing up
So good to see the 4 of you again! And the cheeters yoi know who you are lmao!!
I love that this dropped while I'm on vacation in Texas lol
The three of you together again, love it absolutely amazing. You all work so well together extremely entertaining ... thank you.  👍
so, Ed, the 599 was $40000, there is $16000 worth of repair. because I am not a shred negotiator, I'll give you $25000 for it.
Ft 🇧🇷
Was really looking forward to this series but Ed cheating but a huge downer on it
I know it's not the fastest or the best, but I have something for red cars!
“Tyler puts on Eds sunglasses” Tyler: i got Ed vision Ed: it makes things look cheaper......loool
I am so mad I didn’t see you guys in Wylie, I literally recognize all the spots in this video 😭
Boys you’ve arrived i don’t know if it’s new editor or director or script writer but this is the best yet the most polished, best pace, car trek yet.
Thanks for these episodes. I love the relationship you guys have.. So fun!!
Yay, we back! :D
Who else is disappointed there is no CarTrek episode today?
These are the best ads hands down. I look forward to this stuff!! 👍💯🙏
Only watched for the 456, one of my favorite Ferrari's.
Imagine having Ed’s voice...you can literally do anything you want
So far this is panning out on all the ways to get a budget Ferrari (salvage, abandoned or requiring many a hoop to be jumped through). Cannot wait to see more.
22:32 : the pause was perfect
Lmao omg “no wonder I like it so much”. Tyler flexin that asian fetish we both got 😂 his wife is fine AF though
The most expensive (and beautiful [IMO]) Ferrari is Front V12 - RWD as well, and it can cost over 50 Million at times. It's the Ferrari 250 GTO of course. The 250 TR and GT(B) versions are very similar.
You should make the red Ferrari fast and rebuild it.
Pretty certain Hoovie could have gotten a 456 for Camry money, if he wasn't so infatuated with playing with his stick....  Sorry. A stick.....
They really try hard to make it top geqr, but I'm okay with that
Tavarish's car looks the best
And plus... Ed be cheating, just sayin'
I can't believe they found the 1979 Cannonball Jaguar....
ugly ford probe
I appreciate that even his glasses say Car Wizard. You do you bro
Dude just man up and shave your head. Them KEEPS ain't working bro. Join the dark side!
The American Top Gear “Cheap Car Challenge” we always wanted? Wuuuuuut???
omg... I own that same sweater that hoovie is wearing on day1... XD  costco sweaters ftw! XD
I know the original owner of that pista! Was bought new in Denver
bro i just want a saturn sky redline or a 350z
I hope Tavarish keeps his Ferrari and fixes it up
So, the the rear main seal is bad on the most expensive car and the decision is seepage is fine, but it needs a 5k seat and over 10k in other things.  The four seat car needs nothing, but let's make it tight 0 leaks, The old school ferrari needs a ton of seals, front end work and wiring.  Which one would be satisfying for me to own?  The 308, I would no touch sell the other two.
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.  Freddie's 308 is not a Ferrari 308.  I am calling it right now. Why? Because that's not the front end of a 308. And it's not the front end of a 328 either. That means it reeks of a kitcar. Also, just look at the front of that car. It's all sorts of messed up. They think we're stupid. Maybe we are, I almost fell for it.
In what episode does Ferrari sue since the 3 of you technically are influencers
I absolutely love the 308. From looks alone, it's the clear winner. And I'm not sure I care about anything else, because it's a 308, and it's so damn sexy.
Please keep this going for ever it's awesome
Can’t believe this slipped b6 so many people. This is a car show, and they are playing lambo V10 noises over a Ferrari 488 Pista ...
Freddy Hernandez wins he follows the rules not ike the other 2 lol 😆😅 😂
Things like this i love it do it more often but whit Les talking
🇧🇷
Seeing that 308 makes me so happy about my e28 m5
My neighbor, when I was a kid, bought a '78 308 GTB... $38,000 new
I can't wait for the episode at Motorsport Ranch! Such a fun track. Great to see these guys cruising around DFW!
Only 1:49 seconds in I said out loud this is awesome.. always curious about used & cheap Ferrari's. I def plan on owning one one day.
I love this show, please keep making it, these guys have chemistry and it actually works.  Oh, and I'm off to search the car trading sites for used Ferrari 599s now... thanks Ed.
were's todays episode
I'm digging this a lot. On-cam chemistry and quality is improving with every episode, I can see this become the spiritual successor of Top Gear in a world scale.  Awesome stuff! Also, I would've cheated and gotten the swimming 599 too.
308 is so much nicer than the 356 GTB
26:11 - every software developer ever.
Top gear of YouTube
Are they trying to copy Top Gear?
Who else came from ChrisFix's community post!
Top gear looks different nowadays
Sorry but the first lines are plain retarded. "Turn yadiyada into your own personal asphalt playground"  public roads aren't personal playgrounds. That line is in no way even remotely funny. Car enthusiasts are responsible drivers
so i see the best series on youtube has a new season
yes yes YES
coming straight from fueltech USA and watching from Brazil 🇧🇷🇺🇸
Hi Autotempest; keep giving these idiots money. Thanks in advance
I love this series
New Gen Top Gear. I love it.
Clarkson, May and Hammond..... is that you?!
I like the series but this rule breaking makes it not fun to watch
If Tavarish sells that ferrari at he right time after fixing it he's gonna make a lot of money
Top quality content! Loving it boys! Congrats. This is huge!
Come on either stick to the guidelines or don’t say it’s for less than a Camry.  Ed and Hoovie didn’t stick with the price of a Camry.  Tavarish did.  The next options should have had a Mondial and maybe a flooded 348.  Maybe a Maserati with an argument for a Ferrari motor.  Ed just said I can’t get a Ferrari I’d want to keep for that so I’ll just get what I want.  Hoovie went over budget, probably wouldn’t have if he got a 456 with the automatic transmission.    It’s just misleading to say these cars can be had for the price of a Camry.
Where is 2nd episode?
Freddie's Ferrari is more within the spirit of this challenge than the other 2 and actually looks like a classic Ferrari right down to the color. Those other cars are boring.
The Pista at the beginning was in a beautiful colour.
3 cheap broken Ferraris on a road trip. What could possibly go wrong?
Closing credits (for those who watch the whole way through).... production team includes Jared Pink :-)
16:13 lambo v10 thrown into the voiceover for a film about 3 ferraris🤔😂
............And another Ford Probe shot, tf? If I recall correctly he used that as a slam another time
The back up car is a Mazda miata with a Ferrari badge
Show me an $88k camry
Tavarish automatically wins. Hoovie and ed clearly cheated! BITCHES
I like that there's a 911, a like, 66/65 mustang, the Jag Ed loves so much..... And the Mercury Cougars last iteration, aka basically a third generation Ford Probe!
Car treck should be it's own channel
Is there any car in the history of the World more out of place than that Mercury Cougar at Dennis' place?
its been a day were is the second episode cant wait !
The 456 is the best car.
wheres todays episode?
Who needs top gear
Good for you
Car Trek.  Top Gear lives through you.   I look forward to seeing every episode.
Have a spare $1? 🙏 Savin' to get a laptop (homejob). No opportunities outside due to constant lockdowns (unlike other countries). 😷 Sorry for this. 😳 I'm not a bad person, just a desperate breadwinner. Lost so much since 2020.    Off-topic, I know. 😧 I hope you understand the desperation. I know some people need more help than me and my family but I do hope that does not invalidate my cry for help. 😢  Things are getting worse here. We don't have stimulus checks or anything like USA. So I'm just really doing whatever I can to put food on the table. We may not be killed by the virus but the situation is surely slowly killing us. 😔 Peace be with you. ❤ GOD bless. 🙏  And to anyone who's also struggling, let's hold on tight. All will soon be well. 🌈🌈🌈🌎🙏❤
I love the color of the Pista!
The condition of that HISTORIC Jaguar is absolutely criminal....I’ve been looking for that car for years, and there it is, rusting behind Dennis’ shop!
"Said the flood car owner?"  "It's fine" 😅
Finally freddy has a good car . 😂😂😂😂😂😂
ED bought that Ferrari in PA, I know that dealer.. it only deals with salvage
Great Magnum shirt Car Wizard LOL
Wow top gear is looking great
I would love the 308GTB.  It’s what’s I think of when I think of Ferrari.
So top gear is n a budget basically XD
AutoTempest needs to come to countries in Europe as well
its seems like im watching american top gear or something  with this cheap ferrari for a price of a camry challenge
This is like top gear gear
Ford ...PROBE ... That's low Tavarish, that's lower than your supra.
Trying to cover up them bald spots i see get you a rogain sponsor my friend🤣
Dennis Collins is the MFing man!
Getting top gear vibes...
im rooting for Tavarish, just because it would be hilarious if the old clunker beat out the new super cars XD
I had a 90 jaguar XJS. It was the worst car I have ever owned
Todays vídeo where?
Love it. Thanks guys. Can't wait to see what happens next.😁
Damn that girl! 😵
So Ed basically traded the lambo for the Ferrari and 38k back? Am I understanding that correct?
Freddie wins;
I wonder if there are more Ferrari videos on YouTube than cat videos now 🤔🥱
So theses guys are the new Top Gear, but with Ferrari’s.  Jeez, talk about rags to riches. God bless YouTube.
Jw why does tavarish get the rights to post the videos on his channel only?
I want a cheap Ferrari just for display lol 🤷
You guys made the lockdown and the last year bearable keep them coming
When are new episodes released
:D 36:59 #NumberTwo
Love it
Ainda bem que a ferrari fuel tech não morreu ai kkk
that 308 GTB wow!
“Who are you the IRS” hahahahahah I actually laughed that was good
That 308 dash looks odd it has extra dash running down the centre to the centre console and extra dash at the bottom.  Never seen one like that.
And the mayhem continues!
Viola hongkong <3
Freddy, Your car looks very Magnum P.I. It does not look like the Grocery Getter Tyler bought or the Vettish looking Ferrari Ed bought. Of course, it is very tough to drive since it is a 1970s version Ferrari!
Good thing about this is even they plagiarised the former top gear challenges format the presenters not trying to be British or former top gear hosts which makes it more authentic. Even British viewers would watch this. The only criticism why is it named as Cartreck 🤦‍♂️ lol
New age top gear??!!!  Hell yes
Well only the 308 is proper car, yea it has a lot of issues but it is Ferrari. Sorry but the front engine cars are just not cutting it.  Now if we price equalize the cars ED is 96k after the few repairs wizard quoted, still no fix for the flood title. hoovies shit box is 46k but even with 50k put in it it won't change much. While the 308 with 50k can be mint and museum piece. And it will be well worth it and will appreciate in value.
What is the episode schedule?  I can't wait for the next one.
When does the next episode come out/ what channel?
This is basically a “top gear” we were looking for
We then spent a small fortune on parts!
The grand tour shit knockoff
Love these videos.
Most recognizable for sure, that was a Lamborghini huracan revving when you said that but were showing a ferrari badge..... hmmmmm lol
Who are the 420 mouth breathers who down voted this ?
Autotempest needs to add a “Was this car involved in a flood?” filter specifically for Ed at this point
drive break be towed fix repete
wow... wannabe old school Top Gear or what.....
Can't wait for the Lamborghini version of this and for Ed to turn up in a 2021 Aventador SVJ for the price of a Honda Civic.
The new Top Gear looks amazing
Why picture is so hazy like low contrast...?
How bout Top Gear America with these three?
Thanks for another CarTrek episode.  456 for the win!   Good luck, Tyler.
I love Car Trek and all the guys.   I am glad that they always have The Wizard too, he is funny as hell on Car Issues with Hoovie.
Tavarish please restore your car up after this series!!
I dig the wizards view on this
If you squint really hard Hoovie bought a Ford Probe, Ed grabbed a Nissan 370 and Tavarish settled for a Fiero.
What I've been waiting for. This cures the itch for car enthusiast. We've been looking for a new car show.
If Ed was a divorce lawyer, he would be a billionaire.
Farries for the price of a Camery not Farries that would lose to a camery LoL 😂 classic
Today on: "We copied this entire format from Top Gear:
More videos like this.
When is episode 2?
This is awesome!
These guys are the Top Gear America needs
I want to thank Ed for pronouncing "Murcielago" correctly.
My bike was smashed 400.00$ Canadian money! ! 2001 SUZUKI TRACK BIKE GSX-R 600CC SWAP 1000CC FULLY BUILD BY THE SPONSOR OF THE GUY WHO I BUY IT FROM THREE YEARS AGO!!! IT COST ME 450.00$ MORE JUST TO FIX WHAT'S WAS BROKEN 😂👌 SO I PAID 850.00$ FOR A TRACK BIKE BUT JUST THE MOTOR WORTH MORE THAN 20.000.00$ BUILD LIKE IT WAS SO THAT'S WHAT A GREAT DEALS
You guys need to invest in a smoke machine for proper wizard entry scenes.
Magnum would be proud.
I test drove a C8 corvette and I'm telling you guys even the base one with the N/A 6.2L pushrod V8 that thing is an amazing and a fancy looking sports car too. The C8 corvette is perfect, yes I know everyone will have it and it won't be as cool or rare like those other expensive cars, but at the end of the day think about, what you get for under 100k with the C8. I'm into the sting ray C8 convertible with the bright blue and white interior, black rims, and bright blue brake calipers .... My goodness what a stunning car and it is selling for 87k with the color options from 63k base. Total figures are 91k brand new when you add taxes and dealer fees. But remember, 91k for a Mid Engine, cross plane pushrod V8 (amazing sound), dual-clutch transmission *convertible* sexy looking sports car ??? INSANE. I'm putting money away for one. I started in 2018 and now I'm at 54k saved up. I can't wait. I'll probably get on in 2024 or 2025. Hell I know the base sting ray will get cheaper because GM plans to make two more models I think,  A Flat Plane Twin Turbo V8 (ZR1) and a supercharged V8 (ZO6).
Sponge Bob Square pants must love selling ed his cars

Tavarish picked the best car of the 3 again
I’m just glad that nobody showed up in a Mondial.
I'm honestly tired of Freddie always getting the trash cars 😂😒
“Ugly Ford Probe” my thought exactly. Lol
Holy ads
The Jag deserves better.
Freddy: “This is a mans car!”  Ed: “Yeah, just like in Family Vacation, huh...?”  😂
Maybe  because it's my childhood dream car, I would choose the 308 (not Freddie's 308, that's fore sure) don't care if it's slow, and doesn't have many horsepower.
Tavarish reminds me of Harvey price
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Autotempest thanks for letting these guys do this. We appreciate it!!
That is what us called management
Dennis was the coolest guy ever ❤️❤️ ... Ed I hope u didn't leave wiiiiiiiizard alone with ur car 😂
I love when you put out a car trek episode!!! Better than 90%of the top gears and other car shows alike. Keep up the awesome work guys!
LOVE LOVE LOVE cartrek , you guys are funny :)
I was so excited to suddenly see this pop up. I wish the old intro theme was still around though, it sounded really cool
Show is awesome but would be better if we actually got to see them play within the rules for once.
Hoping mext wil come up voming days bored car trek gives me lot of laughs and fun
Why is Hoovie driving a Nissan NX2000?
I drive by the track all the time, I missed my chance to see car trek filmed.
They should do a movie car edition for Car Trek in the next series
Nice
My friend seen yall driving together lol
5:58 Thought it was a manual with the 3 pedels
the challenge can do with way less scripting.just let the conversations flow as they normally would.you're trying too hard to make the conversations seem spontaneous but anyone can see though it because of your lack of acting skills.just "act" normal ffs
I much prefer Tavarish voice acting compared to Ed. I also like the shorter intro.
Trying to be Clarkson Hammond and may 🤣
finally
I think Ed really missed the point of this. Also not as fun as Freddy's choice.
Put your 20b in the 308😍
Horrible video. Title is clickbait by all means,   the only rule is made up and still not followed by 2/3 guys and there's almost more ads than video. Long time I haven't seen such BS at automotive videos. Sorry guys but this can be lost and forgotten forever.
35:35
Hoovie bougt a Peugeot 406 coupe
Mr Dennis is nicest car man
Dennis Collins is such a nice guy
I love you tv show also bere grills tv show
You do know you’ll never be UK top gear 🤣🤣
𝕄𝕒𝕘𝕚𝕔𝕒𝕝𝕝𝕪 𝔻𝕠𝕡𝕖..,,
I swear they have almost surpassed classic TG
599 GTO in white is still one of my dream cars.
Why does it seem like I’m watching jeremy clarkson’s top gear.
THE PRODUCTION QUALITY!!!! How do these just keep getting better every time???
A harder challenge would be finding a camry for the price of a ferrari
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
reminds me of old top gears, awesome!
This is a road.😢Wow
Dont care what anyone says, yall put together the best video series. Takes me back to the days of binging OG top gear🤙
Dennis is amazingly likable on this series but not so much on his previous appearances.  He seems like a super-fun guy to hang out with.   He is a great addition to the episode.
Why do You copy Top gear/grand tour?
Thanks Autotempest! And of course Tyler, Freddy and Ed. This fills the empty space left in my heart by Clarkson and the boys semi-retiring.
Best video yet! Welcome to Texas Boys! I love all of y'all but the Wizard is the best ever! In rare form today!
Tavarish: the only decent and humane thing to do is to euthanise your car. It is beyond redemption.
Freddy I moustache you a few questions about your Ferrari.
I would give a thumbs up. But bro needs a decent hair cut.
This is a pretty good video but I can’t get past t’s hairline.
I love how Ed manages to cheat on every single one of these things... Comedy!
The wizard is killing it this season. Nicely done!
It's back!!! Heck yeah
Yes it's back 🔥🔥
Love these series
Tav, I want to see a resto series on the 308 so bad.  It was always one of my favorite Ferraris (maybe not that year) and that you picked one up for "cheap" has me more than a little envious.  Keep up the good work guys, I love this show.
Travish:https://youtu.be/4S7BCqKUc9k Check this youtuber Stance Works Ferrari 308 GTB K24 turbo build
Oh, come on, when is the next episode?
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 love this creation.. Hope u guys get sponsored and make this a TV series Netflix  Amazon  where u guys at......keep it up guys! And may I say weeeezzrrddd
You 3 do a great job, please don't stop! You deserve your own TV show.
Probably because the toyota was at least 3 times more reliable than any Ferrari!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 🇧🇷
From chris fix
I wanted to dislike this the moment I saw the 308 out of fear that this series will end in the inevitable destruction of the Ferrari of my childhood . . .
it appears keeps needs a new formula..
When Fred said that his fan's an battery problem were "a feature, and not a bug", it gave incredible Bethesda vibes...
Finally Top Gear I can watch besides the original holy trinity. Good job guys!
Your supposed to say it in a British accent jaguar 👊
#freepaulmiller
I love all of them. All underrated Ferraris. The grey with red on that 599 though...
Car Trek Is AWESOME !
Wow! Top Gear is back!
My favorite series is back baby!!
28:39 His wife is Vietnamese lmao
Freddy's ferrari remind's me hammond's ferrari or "george car"😂
Go on an off roading trip !
The right side cluster is a typical repair. Cam cover gaskets, hood struts and shocks, but other than that, through in a body control unit and you should be good for 10 years
Crisfix sent me here
So much cheating between them at the starts at this vid series.lol typical car guys trying to outdone your Bros any way you can.
WOW!  I recognized right away you were in Wylie. So cool to see several of my favorite channels coming together!
Great video guys! Very Top Gear-esq
I think its time car trek gets it's own yt channel,it has the recognition now as well
Next trek ,time for hoovie to cheat.
Best videos on YT. Love this series.
This is such a great show
How much hair would the wizard still have if he wasn't constantly tasting fluids. He might not be ginger either
Track day, next what could possibly go wrong!
https://youtu.be/EeYeOOQi2pg
God I want a 456gt.......
Shoutout to AutoTempest for paying for this series. It’s awesome
товарищ
I think lamborghini is more recognizable than a ferrari tbh
#FUELTECH FERRARI
Love it. So many original Top gear mannerisms and humour 🥰
The Top Gear America we wanted to see
Top gear esq
Super surprised Freddy didn’t try and pass off a Maserati as a Ferrari
Top gear ?
I like how the production values of each series get better and better!  Great job, fellas and crew!
The episodes are getting better men.. Thanks to Autotempest for helping create what could one day be the younger American version of Clarkson, Hammond and May.
Just keeps getting better and better each time! Great work!
It's a hoovershould be on fire 🔥
28:39 dude im dead hahahah
Wow, that’s worse even than top gear with Chris Harris
Car Wizzard- "Dont tell my wife but, I could make love to this car..." CRICKETS.....  Ed- Well I wont say anything to your wife and we're both very flattered but, would rather you didnt!" LMFAO
Yeah hoovie wins this time around. Lovely Ferrari. Vinwiki man won last time because 5th gen Quattroporte is the best car.  Lol, wtf wizard. That's a physical impossibility, to semi quote Night at the Roxburys.
you guys need see what Anderson Dick from Atlanta doing on his cheap Ferrari, it's amazing. Go to Anderson Dick Youtube channel and check.
You guys should take a look at Anderson Dick F355. He bought the cheapiest Ferrari and turn it brand new !!! https://youtu.be/NT6NiN6A1HA
Those other guys I can not stand.....not Even a ideal of technic, but explaining like champ..... bla bla, blöde Hackfrese
Those other guys I can not stand.....not Even a ideal of technic, but explaining like champ..... bla bla, blöde Hackfrese
As always epic series
Why they continue to make the Top Gear that isn’t really Top Gear when they could just pluck this and put it on TV boggles the mind. This makes me happy like old school TG. Great stuff
Shoulda been a 458 but sure yea V12 and all
Car trek!!!! Awesome
This is what great content is Top Gear. How is that 3 You Tubers make you professionals look ridiculous. It is just sad that with your budget you can't pull off something at least this entertaining.
Arghhhhh! The symmetry on the 456 pop up headlights is driving me crazy! It obviously took a hit in the front passenger side 🤓
Ed is our American version of Top Gear's Jezza. Just gotta love him.
Nop tavarish has the best car...and the only one in the right colour
355 "f1" spyder for 30k @Andersondick Best Ferrari in the world!!
Graças a Deus o @Anderson Dick resgatou a Ferrari amarela antes que vocês comprassem
Yes
"Who's the U-Boat Commander" from Risky Business is what comes to mind with Ed's car
Haven't been this excited since the old days of Top Gear!!
Brasil 🇧🇷
For Ed cheating... AGAIN... and managing to wordsmith his way through the first episode... the look on his face at the repair cost announcement was PRICELESS!!
I'm rooting for you Tavarish. You're the only one that actually followed the rules. I'm trusting you to fully explore the limits of your car and have a wreck ready for the junkyard when the series is over. 😉
This is the best thing ever!
AQUI  É BRASIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Special thanks to olive garden breadsticks LOL
Crap top gear ⚙️
This is 100% your phone voice
Tyler is so annoying
I'd rather have the diablo
Wow, they made a show even more scripted than Top Gear
serious .. love .. machines
Ed is a madman😂😂 love u tons edbolian❤️
This is why we never heard a word about Hoovie's Ferrari he had so many times in the background
Both of them a cheaters for sure, however, Tavarish is wrong about mid engined Ferraris... front engine is  historically fundamental for Ferrari.
Tavarish……….you are growing bald
That Junkyard! It's more a Treasure Yard that a Junk Yard! Only in America...
didnt know Tom Dwan had a 599 GTB :D
Meh, not interested in this car trek stuff, just want to see car builds
Better than Top Gear!
Dude what happend to your hair?
if i was to own one of these 3 im going with eds, buy a aftermarket trans or have that one build to last fix the gage cluster and your good
all that money and Tavarish still cant find a decent barber
if you have the means, i highly recommend picking one up.
The 308 needs a nut and bolt restoration
"If you were gonna spend 80-100k dollars, whatever you want".........  I earn less than 30k per year.
Came to Dfw and no meet up :(
Probably the best season episode so far, prior seasons were starting to get a bit old, repetitive and boring. Not sure if you changed the production crew but whatever has changed it’s for the better. Well done guys keep it going
Yoo
Looks like Tyler is ChrisFX
The XJS is cool, I would fix it (maybe, if I was a sadist) but I would leave the paint alone...
I think a toyota is more reconizable then a ferrari
Has anyone noticed wizards glasses at 30:17? Guess he's branched out into the optics industry now... :')
Hey Rob, take notes on how you produce a YT series lol, hopefully Sorted is better next time
You are destroying the concept with the cheating.
You copied top Gear
I hope we get years of cartrek! Please don’t change a thing! I get the same “fizz” as watching top gear UK and that makes me happy.
"Some thing made by the most recognizable brand on earth... mcdonalds"
Viva la Palestine
Real shame Freddy hasn't finished his 355, that would have been very funny.  And I bet he got that very cheap. Nice loophole. 😂
I like Freddy and Ed but hoovie is as Clarkson said “softer than the journalism in an in flight magazine, more plastic than an American news reader” he really should be replaced. The show would work better without him.
My dream Ferrari is the testerosa
This series is amazing! I'd love to see them do an early 2000s Tuner cars season
Is it possible to learn this power?
why use Lambo V10 sounds for a Ferrari intro video?
The 599 is the worst because pop up headlights.
Most excellent 👍🏼
@tavarish - this is definitely season 4 of Car Trek, right?
Only choice Freddy? What about Mondial or 348?
Freddy needs to hand the wizard some cash before he inspects the next hooptie he gets 🤣
so cool, puting Denis in this! And Tyler I agree with you on 456 100%!
That's the most aggressive text vibrating I've ever heard in my life
Please get rid of Ed and replace him with Doug de Muro.
Anyone else got original top gear vibes when the second ferrari pulled up, just like hammond pulling up second and being called an idiot by ckarkson
Great video!!!
Ed Bolian is a national treasure
This has the spirit of Top Gear. Great show
Flood cars are electric nightmares... oh wait; so are Italian cars 🤣
Is that a Snuggie jacket?
What an absolute rip off from tog gear even the logo haha
Anyone else looking for the comment of Ratarossa
All legends 💥💥💥💥
I would watch this Too Gear rip off but Ed cheated out of the box and bought a car listed for $99k.
Thank you chaps, I love watching your adventures 👍
I'm 31 years old and the 308GTB Ferrari is my dream car I will own one one day I just hope it's in the time I can injoy it and not to old to dive by then what can I say I'm a dreamer one day my dream will come true and I will have my own and I will drive my 308 everyday because I don't even have a car right now cuz it was stolen
That was a serious Clarkson intro! This is going TopGear quality
just glad you'll didnt rock up in a mondial
Well done guys. You guys complement each other very well.
Hoovie's 456 is definitely the one Ferrari I'd want.  It's a proper gentleman's car.  Not overly flashy,  but still fast, comfortable and beautiful.
Unfortunately this video is unwatchable due to the constant comercial breaks, get these three on a platform (Netflix, HBO....) so I can watch without going crazy mad.
i think i caught the hello magnum wrong who knows lol
Gotta say, car trek season 1 started off as a higher level YouTube show but now, with season 4, it is in differentiable from today’s top TV automotive shows.
Tavares is basically driving a glorified box
Man I’ve missed this. You guys are so entertaining to watch.
I love how the way you Collab each other guys. I enjoyed it so much watching you guys. make a lots of video for us guys love it so much
Dude... You really need to cut your loses... Your hair is done... Time to let go.
Awesome cars guys. Cant wait for the rest of the series !
Goes to prove how shoddily built Ferraris are.
40k for a 600k car makes Ed the eternal king of Shrewdnegotiateland.
Tavarish looks much more handsome than  when in shop...
Let's just clear the air first... Nobody wants to use Ferrari because of the $$$$$$$ in maintenance that it's going to take to upkeep it. At a certain mileage don't all Ferraris have to have the motor pulled to be serviced?...
"this is a road" not even a second in and my tiny little mind is blown  As a side not I think the 308 is my personal favorite
Ed Bolian - "Its like your grandmother saying intercourse" Wtf😂😂😂
So Ed is just a cheater. Seems about right
Dennis nailed it and Freddy was funny with, Tyler, you have an ugly Ford Probe. 🤣
Makes me wonder when Richard will be in CarTrek... GREAT EPISODE!
Awesome video!
You guys fill the TG and Grand Tour gap perfectly. Greetings from germany, maybe you can someday shoot one on the autobahn and have some fun with our beloved TÜV ;)
Brilliant! Really well edited too and a great combination of people and cars - high class guys 👍👍
Did you have to dub the entire inspection scene? The audio was clearly off and the mics were very fuzzy.
This is like a cheap top gear.
Still think the 308 is the most beautiful of the 3. Its the one id buy .. To look at because with my 6ft7 frame i wouldnt fit i think 😆
Damn. I didn’t realize that Season 4 was in the Dallas area. I would’ve came on set and said hello
I came from Anderson Dick's (Fueltech CEO) recommendation! You rock guys, congratulations! You just got a new subscriber! 🙂
Good luck guys keep up the good work Cheers.....
hey you have given a comment in strandman video
Finally car trek is here!!!
Since when was Action Bronson a car mechanic?
God the 599 is such a pretty car
Love seeing these guys in my back yard I live like 5 minutes from Collins Bros.. Thank you to Auto Tempest please keep these coming!!!
No god damn way 😧
I love how you guys are going to different shops and also exposing other YouTube greats! Can’t wait for the rest of the season.
Man is this good, can't even compare it to the first Car Trek
Id think Hoovies Ferrari 360 spider from CarTrek 1 would fit in this category with lots of funds left over.
Love the 308. That’s definitely in the spirit of the show and a great car
Every new season of car trek I think is the best, but it just gets better and better.
Tavarish  Followed the Rules, Hoovie  bent the Rules.... and Ed  just snapped them and threw them in the bin..
This is better than the new top gear and the us top gear combined!
Weeeeeeezaard!!!!  -Tyler
Freddie you need to cut ✂️ your hair it looks horrible bro smfh😔
Freddie’s choice is my choice a 308 gtb
Does anyone know the colour of that pista?
no 355 ??   well f*ck me ..... 😑😑😑
Would be cool to see a CarTrek Gumball Edition  😎
Fix the seat sensor for 4-5 Grand with a new seat, yeah right!! He has the best car, if I was Ed I’d tell you I really DGAF! Lol
This series is awesome!!!!!
Message to Autotempest: do NOT ever think that you can do this series without the Car Wizard.  He is essential.
Lol wizard don’t tell my wife ill. Make love to this car lol
so glad that top gear is back 😌
Freddie is so correct on this.. Ferrari are to be mid-engined ..FULL STOP ..
tavarish has less and less hair every time i see him
MAN A LOT OF VIEWS! Kind of funny
MAN A LOT OF VIEWS! Kind of funny
My Grandmother has been dead a while now and I really miss hearing her say "intercourse."
I swear this is the second coming of Top Gear only better.
I have been trying to find the best comparison between you guys and the original trio. It wasn't until this episode with the way he got his car that Ed absolutely feels like the Clarkson of this group. Can't wait for more episodes and hope you all keep producing these!
This is like american top gear
Big Top Gear energy *chef kiss*
Tav is gonna win
"Hello Magnum"
Poor Tavarish
the 308 is the best looking imo
this is a A/C delete car it wasn’t a factory option though 🤣
Good thing the Car Wizard was wearing a Car Wizard shirt... i couldnt tell him apart from the other 3 Car Wizards...😆
Wizard shenanigans
cost effective buy a used seat & have it Reupholstered to match lmao should be around 4-5k 🤣 i was laughing hard when wizard said that
Ferrari is so yesterday , were they ex Youtubers cars :)
Best Series !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this cartrec series,
after long few years of consideration 599 absolutely my favourite car
23:43😂
These guys shuuld be hosting top gear America.
Can someone tell me what color is on that 488 pista in the beginning?
like an old top gear special
I could make love to wizard...
Tavarish: "A car made by the world's most recognisable brand..."  Me: "Oh cool. Toyota."  Tavarish: "... Ferrari."  Me: "WTF?!"
I love you guys, but I'm sorry this just feels like a badly scriped and stolen top gear special.
the Olive Garden thing was funny
Honestly surprised that Freddie didn't buy Samcrac's 360 Modena as his CarTrek beater.
Everything Hoovie buys is mint
The wizards dry humor is the best😂😂 WEEEEEZARD
Tavarish followed the rules!?   I mean I expected shenanigans from Ed.
A 308 is my dream ferrari
This is what we all were waiting for...
I love the wizard
“It was delivered to South Vietnam” Tyler: “no wonder why i like it so much” Lmfaoooo
What are u the irs 🤣🤣🤣
I’ve only watched 15 minutes of the video so far, and can’t wait to find out how they ended up in cousin fuckin Wylie, TX. I grew up there since age 11 and got the fuck out as soon as I could
I've seen that Jag and took pics of it in 2019. The crazy thing is, it was for sale in Saudi Arabia!!
Like the show bit of a copy of top gear though
I didn't get my notification! Thanks to vinwiki I saw this was out.
I think the 456 is beautiful...
You guys need a  TV Show ! Also, the 599 is GORGEOUS! 🇮🇹
348 would’ve kicked butt at this
Shenanigans: one word for this series
Dood CUT YOUR HAIR for god sake some on man!!!
If you needed more evidence a camry is too expensive 😹😹😹
The dream brand really……
FINALLYYYYYYYY
weight reduction is really the golden excuse 27:00
The production value is Top Gear level! Good job, can’t wait to see the next episode!
Opening scene: "This, is a road"  What I heard in my head: "This, is a road" "Dear god" "There's more" "Nooo"
Awesome series!
Let's get this to trending
Woah, glad i gave these series a shot.
I like how Olive Garden Breadstick made the credits. 🤣😂🤣
Car Wizard is sooooo much better on camera since Hoover found him
I want the "Car Trek" sticker for my car!
Thanks Y'all! Freddy bought the perfect car. I can see the gears turning and a resto-mod in its future.
I've driven tons of Ferraris and the 599 was my favorite to drive. Definitely doesn't draw a ton of attention, I kinda like that, I was driving a black 599 in South Beach about 20 minutes after a White Lamborghini Murcielago roadster. People were going crazy over the Lambo but almost nobody even turned their heads to look at the 599 until I scraped the bottom on the hotel driveway!
LOVE these CarTrek shows!  Great job guys!
The wizard has come a long way from staring directly at the camera without blinking 😳 lol
Best one yet !
no Mondial?? lol... I'm disappointed Seriously though... a 612 Scaglietti woulda been nice. Cheaper than that 599!
I love how CarTrek excites me the same way Grand Tour does and Top Gear used to! You guys are amazing!
I love how CarTrek excites me the same way Grand Tour does and Top Gear used to! You guys are amazing!
Imagine buying a Ferrari....then driving it into a lake.
Love this series. Don’t stop until Ed learns what a toolbox is… so never.
Ed vision makes everything look cheaper!  Love it!
Omg i love wizard
3:52-4:04 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Someone at AutoTempest's marketing department deserves a big fat bonus for enabling this madness.
I’m surprised nobody bought a “Fierari” ( Ferrari kit car Fiero) like Tavarish’s Pontiac Countach he bought a while back. Especially Tavarish since he’s bought two (I think).
Ed loafer game is 🔥💪🏾🔥
How has a major network picked this series up? Inconceivable....
Uma certa F355 amarela perdeu o programa porque foi convidada pra um churrasco 🇧🇷😼
23:52 Ed’s face is a mood
Top gear would be pleased.
I guess the wizard never heard of a Jerrari 🤣
This has all the good parts of the original TopGear specials and no drawbacks.
Freddie that was savage 🤣🤣🤣🤣 are there any trees on this track LMAO 😆😆😆😆😆
New top gear hmmmmmm
Are there any trees on this track???
This is better than top gear... at least the American one! The older British ones are legendary!!!
Vietnam joke made me spit-take
When you three are together (plus the Wizard) you are better than every car show on TV/Amazon/Netflix right now. You need a big budget show! You're far better than the Grand Tour and trending towards being as good as the original BBC Top Gear days. Looking forward to the next episode!!
Just sub today but have been watching for a pa while. Love the content as always but Freddy never has his haircut what’s up with that or his barber is some 💩💩💩
Freddy:  "Flood car that cost you $80,000.00." Ed: "Yes!  I know!" ...he says, with the *wrong amount* of way too much excitement. 🤣
Let's get this road out on the road and give it a Doug score.
Bro keeps def not working on you...
There is a reason why I don't sub to Ed and Hoovies channel any more, they both cheat and lie. Freddy you are the real deal and I love your work. I know you won't win this series as these other two cheaters saw to that. Hope you keep this car and actually get it running like new again....maybe drop a bigger motor in it, or give it some boost....I had a poster of this car on my wall as a child, not of these other two imposter cars.
here goes my temporary sub so i can keep updated on car trek..
I enjoy this every time!!
Hmm. Would have been cooler if they were a bit closer in spec. Tavarish def followed the rules.
i own a 2001 toyota camry that i bought for $500. doubt i'll find a ferrari for even 10x that amount lol
So a 250 gto, a real one... the one worth 50 million.... with a front engined v12 is a fake ferrari?
i think ford is the most recognizable company in the world, i mean think henry designed the assembly line he made vehicles the regular. vehicles wouldn’t be the same if it wasn’t for the blue oval. (and i’m not even that big of a ford fan it’s just fax😂😭)
The introduction made me listen it on Clarkson's voice. Amazing production guys! Ps: Tyler saying "Wizard" spontaneously when they mentioned him, made me laugh hard!
Anderson Dick brought me here! He is CEO of FuelTech and repaired a F355 Ferrari! (With customizations)
When your watching this but you can’t afford a Toyota Camry.
It's like your grandma saying "intercourse" 🤣🤣
Car Trek is much more enjoyable than the current top gear.
Okay...just finding this series despite Hoovie talking about it...shot almost like TV show. This is great.
Love me some Car Trek, been waiting for the new series and loved this episode! Can't wait for the next one! 👍👍
Ytt
Gotta say, based on this episode, it is no surprise that Freddy got Covid from cartrek.
There is a lot of loafers in this episode, I suppose it’s fitting with the Ferraris and all
I hate to say it but the 308 is the sexiest
Favorite series look forward to the next upload!
OMG BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR SEASON 4!!! You guys have something special going here, thanks for gifting the world with your passions!
Are there any trees on that track  lmao that was brutal Freddy and I absolutely loved it 👍
I love Yall but this episode Isnt really keeping my attention span...
Why the VW AG V10 noises on the Pista?
Almost top gearish lol
Surprise.... surprise...car trek 4!!!!
I wonder if we're gonna get a Car Trek season with non exotic cars? like what if we got one for "classic performance cars for the price of a v6 mustang"?
the best part of the first episode of cartrek is that there is no recap of the video from yesterday.
This show is really becoming something that's worth watching. Coming from the first season, now it's really something special.
You mean Jarred has a lot of work to do.
Yes!! Another series!
Special thanks to the Olive Garden Breadsticks! 😆
TG AMERICA! Seriously.?
Come on. Buying a flooded vehicle even if it's a Ferrari and not cheap at $80k is still a bad deal.
I leave just down the road from where y’all met up at.
I thought the Wizard's shirt said " Gay Wedding"...
Now I understand why Wizard tastes the car's leaks... It's part of the foreplay
Production quality is great, but I feel like they should have a more strict budget.  Having a 40k price difference between the cheapest and most expensive car kind of defeats the point of the competition.
Season 4 of Tyler wins 😂😂
Cool video guys...shout out to dennis...
Anderson's Ferrari F355 turbo is amazing now.
Freddy: This is my 78 308 GTB and you're going to see what's wrong with it.  Car Wizard: Whole car delete. Not interested.
Tyler! You got an ugly Ford Probe!😂😂😂😭
I like the   355 430 GTO
Damn I love me some car trek. You three work together perfectly.
Gonna wait for the cease and desist episode
Would still take the 308. So pretty.
Personally I like the 308 better than the other two. The other two look like Hyundai want to be.
I stopped watching any car youtuber that can't wrench.  Tavarish, you stand alone!
LOL, International Waters Repairs. LOL.
Tavarish, comb your hair. Did you not realize you were going to record?
Tavarish is way beyond these two, I spcly dnt like Ed, like always manipulative of everything, sometimes being cocky is fine, but always...
Hoovie's dumb schtick is annoying AF.  Wish he'd just be his normal silver spoon self
I'm routing for THE WIZARD!!
Is it just me, or could these guys be the actual well-suited replacements for Top Gear....
Save The Ferrari! The Brazilian Anderson Dick the founder of Fueltech rescued a 355 F1 that had been abandoned for 10 years ... Today she has 777Hp #fueltech #Brasil #andersondick #macchina
I have to say the 456 is pretty dam ugly I would definitely get the Magnum pi Ferrari it's iconic and just dam cool I know the gills on the door is iconic but if they was not there it would look slicker and better
F355 fueltech Brasil!!!🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I always found Ferraris like the 456GT so boring looking... No distinguishing features to me...
Freddy needs to keep that car, it's perfect for a restomod.
Please next time keep it a suprise
rare opinion , im watching this for the wizard
Love these shows.  Thanks AutoTempest for making these possible
Yoooo the track for the next episode is Cresson TX!!! I went there for my 18th birthday and I drove a Gallardo, 911 Turbo, and an F430 on that track! So cool!
This is great 👏 thanks for the upload
Camrys don't go above 36k... unless your dealer is scummy
Omg! The production level on this season increased so much! Now this truly looks like original top gear!
I will have a 599 oneday 😍
Soooo Ed retired the brown loafers and got those shoes? Found in the trunk of a flood damage, theft recovery, McLaren Senna
Nope, I wouldn’t get a flood car, even if it runs and drives, I’d rather fix problems I can find.
Now these are some Camrys I would love to drive. Thanks for the great entertainment you three.
Did you see the Ferrari f355 fueltec ?.
i think hands down Freddie should win just for the fact that  he followed the RULES
Finally an upload
Sorry but Freddy wins hands down already, because I just looked at the price of a NEW 2021 Camry and the most expensive one in Orlando Florida is....$35K. All other upcoming chalenges are invalid because those other ones cost almost double.  Congratulations on your Win Freddy!
In the next series Ed shows up with Wizard’s yacht
Dennis is the best
Wow didn’t realize y’all would be going to Collins bros. I literally live 5 minutes away. That’s crazy.
Brasil, Anderson Dick, FT!!
9:01 and that car on the left is a TOYOTA CAMRY
Olá, vcs deveriam fazer uma matéria com o Anderson Dick, brasileiro que ressuscitou uma Ferrari, instalando uma injeção FuelTech. A joia ficou diferenciada! Forte abraço!
woohoo! new car trek!
This is almost like those cheap car challenges on the Clarkson era of Top Gear. Really enjoyed this
“You couldn’t DIY that”  *proceeds to pull McLaren apart and rebuilds it from the ground up*  Freddy you can DIY anything apparently 😂
I’m getting Top gear USA vibes🤧
Finally!!!! Ty
I’ve missed this.
I can't stand that Dennis guy.. he's such a dick!! Spends to much time with Richard
I heard "this, is a road" in Dougs voice
SUBscribed
It's funny how cool Ed thinks he is 🤣
Anyone want to talk about that 67-68 mustang fastback there. That thing looked pretty sweet.
I say the 599 won't make it to the end.
Better than the past two IMO. Love it!
0:28 *lambo engine revs* THIS is a Ferrari
Oh and on a good note!  The wizard lookin pretty hot! He could make a few more bucks and a possible new boat as a model on Ginger Bear gay magazine!  Mmmm mmm good
Always great to see The Wizard !!!
You are the best!!
Top gear america finally got it right. They do need a stig......I suggest cleetus
honestly, this is as good or better than the last few seasons of top gear and grand tour..
Is it just me or anyone else getting Top Gear UK vibes?
mustang was delivered to south vietnam. I seem to remember some vintage photo's of another mustang being loaded aboard a military cargo ship. Probably an officers car. Would love to know the story on it. Did Dennis ever mention this car on his channel?
Tyler is such a loser. Him and his mechanic are the worst part about this series
Anderson Dick’s Ferrari rules!!!!
Yes finaly, i am excited, i have waiting for this guys😀🇳🇴
Hey Hoovie, Dibs on the 456 when you get tired of it.
Seriously guys, I dig it so much. Good on you three for making a killer series. Oh and weezard too. All around good!
A hot 599
BBC attempted to recreate the chemistry of the original TopGear here in the US with Tanner Foust & co, and failed miserably. People just didn’t like those guys as a crew. You three are much more charismatic and together, more fun. So congratulations on success where BBC failed. One suggestion though try for more impromptu, unscripted scenes, especially where the natural hilarity occurs. Love the show guys, and thanks AutoTempest.
Please tavarish. Find a Barber. You need professional hair help. Like seriously what is going on with your fro? Bro?
Please don't hump my car LOL
Tavarisch and Hoovie should loose this pompous a$$hole and get a new member for this trio.
It's almost like watching old top gear
"It's a feature!"- Tavarish (every car 😂)
car: 488 pista sound: lambo huracan
All I see is Clarkson, Hammond and May here. Hmmm 🤔
Can we get Ed some tighter pants he doesn't look quite like a chicken yet!!!!!     When you haven't done laundry in weeks and your wife's pants are the only clean pants in the house!!..  Hahahahahahahaha
Shame you couldn't use the JK F40
Poor version of top gear
I'm sad because the cheapest running Ferrari in canada is about 70k cqnadian
god, for such beautiful cars how can the company be so terrible
You guys are SO much better than any American Top Gear!
Best car content and great hosts as always. Love the series.
I've actually been looking at some 456's recently.  Haven't found one yet that ticks all the boxes, but there's been some that are close.  Prices are reasonable (for what they are) and still have a manual box. 😀  Oh, and pop up lights!
599 is gorgeous
Tyler’s looks like a Ford Probe
Most  of the places and buildings in the background I recognize bc i live near there.
Ed,Tavarsh,and Hoovie back together again it gets no better It's like watching three brothers that horseplay all day Ed is the oldest ,Tarvarsh is the middle child and Hoovie would be the baby 😆
Ferrari has to be the LEAST recognizable brand for me.  Ford prolly has that title.  Old Ferraris look so wicked tho!  Freddy's is so slick!  The other two look like expensive cars but @Tavarish picked the best looking one, hands down!
Ed is like the Smokey Robinson of Nascar, pushing every limit of the written rules they have to rewrite the rules when you show up.
“Hello Magnum.” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As a guy who dream of owning a Ferrari (most likely a used one, let's keep realistic), I'm a bit scarred of this series now
This time on Car Trek, Freddy buys a parts car, Tyler has a smug face and Ed manipulates numbers.
At the end, is there any trees on this track.  Digging at Edd for his Maserati jump.
Total top gear rip off. But who cares  its entertaining
if anybody doesn't get the South Vietnam reference it's a wife joke.
This series give me vibes of classic UK top gear with Clarkson Hammond and May
Hoovies  ferrari has the rear end of a Peugeot 406
This was unexpected
thanks fellas :)
Really enjoy these series with the 3 guys together, Just like old top gear. 3 friends having heaps of fun with cars and challenges 😁😁
Awesome ! Been waiting for this season to start ! As for what car I would take  ?  599 as a rental for sure... 456 for a daily driver... and 308 for a not sure.  Love this series !
Tavarish’s hairline tho
i know that town
Hoovies car should have been a Ferrari kit car for the laugh and him arguing because his is best because it’s cheapest
The front on  hoovies Ferrari looks jacked up
You guys are better than the U.S. top gear guys
Ed vision: a must have for mechanics and car salesmen world wide.
That's awesome, but I'm glad I rescued that F355 before Ed!
Waaaay better than American top gear
Check out Casey drives Ed's Ferrari 599. https://youtu.be/lkCCoxs-I0o
Approximately 40 😂. Dennis needs to be driving with them.
The 456 has the styling of a Ford Probe.
good ole Wyllie so many memories
So Ed Bolian is pretty much the Jeremy Clarkson of the group 😅
I’m sorry I love Freddie’s car the most
Poor car wizard… the guy made some good jokes and you guys shut him down hard af. Smh
Thanx to Olive garden bread sticks?
Did you grow up under powerlines Freddy?
Ed's dad jokes/puns are so great yes keep it up man!
love you bud
I'm a massive, massive fan of Millennial Top Gear so far :)
Since #1 Hoovie always picks the best car for trek
I AM SO GREATFUL CAR TREK EXISTS YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME
They are running away from your mom because she took her top off🥳🤩
Only getting better and better 😁 Great job!
Does Wizard even know what a prize he is in the Bear community? 🐻🍆❤️🤣
ED Bolian 🤣🤣🤣
New season of car trek during finals week, Jesus Christ am I screwed
Hey Bolian, I got $45k for you when the trips over thats a profit for you
lol im am waiting to see ed send his car to the wizard to fix his cars
I'm with ed on this
I love the choices of cars, I really really like the 308 because I'm a magnum pi fan. I really hope you don't destroy these cars!
Man, they were right down the street from me and I didn't even know.
The 308 is still my dream Ferrari.  I love that car.
I think Tavarish misunderstood. He brought the only Ferrari slower than a Toyota Corolla.
Top gear
My favorite series. My favorite guys to watch. My favorite cameos. So thankful!
Freddy, it's impossible for that to be the cheapest Ferrari in the country because Mondial
Chuck Norris did that in the 80's Booooo!
Texas = Ted Cruz…now unsubscribed from all who took part
Waited months! Had to wait until after work to watch everything on screen. Nailed it boys! Keep it coming!!!!
I'm sorry but I think it's time to let it go. I mean the hair, lol
28:07
Next car trek should be a murci special lol
The 308 is the best looking car
Top show again. Wish it was longer. Keep up the good work love this show...👊✋👍
This is THE BEST YouTube has to offer!
I like this one. It makes sense having those 3 cars on this series.
I'm sorry to be that guy but why is there a huracan revving in the video a couple times
Ed would not pay $80k for a Camry so he is clearly cheating.  As crazy as it seems, Freddie has a bigger POS than last time. But it is probably the only one that's really in the price limit.
Freddy is definitely the James May of the bunch.
Too many ads to even watch programme 🤷🏼‍♂️
The initial voiceover isn't Freddie, Ed or Tyler. Who is it?  Great show, can't wait for the next one.
Tavarish needs a mustache.
@17:05 2002 mercury cougar c2 possibly
The shenanigans are going out of hand, but I love it! Not even Top Gear did all this financial trickery.
Tavarish Its a battery strap!  Oh and a few bolts missing! No big deal
I thought Camrys were like $28k? No where near $40-45k. 2 guys at work just bought 2. One was new for $28k & the other was a year or two old for $17k.
Hi hoovie
So awesome
As a current XJS owner, I can't say I recommend it.
This series is absolutely amazing
These rock, but really need better marketing guys...    Even just tag the title with car trek...
Don’t taste that. Lol
Freddy always gets the shit car
YESSS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SERIES. NEVER EVER STOP. It reminds me of TopGear. 3 goof balls enjoying themselves.😅
I love this series it's a new age top gear
This is the cheesy brother of top gear and I love it
The highlight of this video is Dennis Collins, such a genuine and great man
Hey guys, Chris Fix brought me here. And I find another treasure
I’m so happy they picked ferraris instead of other brands
#dogecoin
When I see the round side marker on the Ferraris that are like on a Yugo... It cracks me up
Why don't you guys give those away to your fans in your subscribers When you're done with them As a sweepstake
Iv watched all of the car trek series so far. Everything has been excellent except whoever edits the background music. It’s so loud when the hosts are talking and it really takes you out of the conversation. Other then that keep up the great work and keep them coming!
What a great team , awesome video guys please keep them coming
That’s awesome they were in my hometown. I lived right behind that keep dealer.
Eliot needs to buy this
if you skip through all of hoovies lines, the episode becomes much more interesting.
OH YES
This is pretty bad
Enzo Ferarri once said the only sportscar which came out of the US was a Jeep.
We just gonna ignore Tavarish headtop in this video?
Tavarish, dude, literally all the most expensive (=most valued) Ferraris are front-engined! (And V12)  This show's format rocks, I just wish you'd fix the cars up really well and then do some more driving and challenges!
I'm surprised not to see a 400i or a 308gt4........
Wow, why is that orange Cougar so clean 17:47
Awesome to have you 3 clowns back. New Top Gear. Screw Too Gear US unless you 3 take over.
Tavarish, your a little fluffy and lizard you need the doctor. Your going to have a stroke like me. God is good. Do it ASAP.
He said I could make love to this car lol. 22:29
Youtubers “Top Gear “....
599 looks so good!
Love the show guys...... 10/10!
The boys: Walk up to a jag.  Me: THAT MUSTANG IS MINT Them: ignores the damn mustang Me: GUYS. THE MUSTANG.  Those bastards: auto tempest advertisement Me: sad
Tavarish got a yeeyee ass haircut
Dudes got to stop saying wizard so creepy
This is awesome
Love Ed's facial expression at 16:05 when he says "If you require having a clean title" lmao
Cool episode
Wizard crazy asf bruh 🤣🤣🤣
You guys should team up with Gas monkey Garage for a special episode 🙏🏽
The Ferrari 456 looks like a Nissan 240SX from 30 years ago.
There is not a single place on Oahu that rents a Ferrari 308. Most of them didn’t even know why I’d want that specific car. How is this possible? I can’t be the only one that wants to drive around the island in that car.
I'm super excited to see you guys back in action! One of the greatest things I've see you guys doing
I can see the flood of emails going out Mrs Wizard right now!  Unless I am mistaken, they were about 6 miles from my house in the preview of the next episode!
Well Tavarish has the coolest one, if the most broken one.   But I'd be afraid one of the other guys would hide an MP3 player in there somewhere playing the Magnum PI theme endlessly.   Those color switches on the console look like one I had in my old Suburban to run the fog lights.  Cheap parts store crap and it wore out in a few months.
This is like top gear of USA
As someone who works for Ferrari, this was an amazing video to watch. Each car is great in their own ways, as this video has shown. Love it, keep these videos going please!!
Tavarash: "this is a Man's Car.." Ed: "that's what it was in family vacation right?"  Lol that line was just too perfect
I’m team Tyler this time. Gated manual on a non red Ferrari? Yes please!
Love the content but careful about promoting unsafe driving speeds on public roads
So awesome can't wait for next one guys
We just like spanking them on the race track..with go karts.. From Road America to Laguna.
Man, I would love to drive that Italian Ford Probe
Anyone ever hear of a website called 'autotempest'? I hear you can search for cars there.
tavarish please just shave the hair lol youd be a damn good bald guy
TOO GEAR VIBEZZZZ YOOOO OMG. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH
Thanks guys for putting these mini series together. Won’t be too long before a network asks you all for full 10+ episode season. Make it happen tv execs!
I love Car Trek.......SO MUCH MORE THEN TOP GEAR AMERICA 😼😆🎉
Why copy the three idiots? xD
So much better than the new Top Gear America!
Freddie is such a dissapointment.. Had d metusela Ferrari for 4 months and u cant fix it to a minimal repair level.. Thats y u are always coming last.. Even if u are my best.. But Tyler is already taking ur position...
Hey Ed, I actually worked at the dealership where you bought your 599 from for almost 2 years!
Damn I got some hard top gear vibes from thar intro
Great start to the series!
Tyler even kept the 308 in his warehouse.
Freddie is forever dissapointing me.. Had d freaking metusela Ferrari for four months and u cant fix it to a minimal repair level till now... Thats y u always coming last... But u are my best... But Tyler is kind of pushing u down to second...
I feel like this challenge would have easily been completed if they found their Ferrari's from Dubai since they a bit cheaper here.
15:30 you made the worst deal out of all of them. You traded a super rare car wich only can go higher in price for a value decreasing half broken bad „legend“
I’m glad you guys are back!!!!!
You’ve captured the essence of old top gear, love it
This is the American top gear everyone wanted and never got. Until now!
The 308gtb is my fav, Tavarish is the winner to me. Ed, I totally see you buying the Jag from Dennis. Tyler, im waiting on the 300sd...
The 456 is sorta justified.
It may be boring looking but I'd take the 456. V12 + gated manual all the way
another cheap version of TopGear. I understand that these things should be done for the sponsors but they are repeated and it no longer seems like fun content.
Absolute car guy, but who is the girl photographer?
At 7:25 why do people ways assume a car with KM is from Dubai? XD
YESSSSSSS
Viva la Palestine
Love this series so much
I miss the old Tyler. This new thrifty Tyler who buys reliable good condition exotics just will not do.
Nice Tiburon Hoovie
Love CarTrek
Man, Id die to be let free in Collins bros lot! So many rare Cjs!
Best options for this ep would be an 612 , 360, f430
Feels like forever since the last challenge. Glad yous decided to do another.
Do 500$ cars next
Can we please make them all the new Top Gear America?! Grand Tour America? Please!!!
Why are there so many Lamborghini V10 sound effects 😂
That 308 is so pretty!
Collins Bros Jeep is LITERALLY down the road from me. Crazy that you guys were so close!
I just switched notifications on for this series. Thanks for the great content,  guys!
Well done boys.
This is awesome! Very well produced, written, and hosted.
1:26 you forgot big women
Great start.  Can't wait to see the race.  He says as he goes looking for a 456.
Collins Brothers??  This  is   B Y   F A R    the BEST CarTrek EVER RECORDED, damn good!!
Superb episode.  Dennis was an extra special addition.
I used Autotempest to find my '94 Viper!  Great show, guys.  Looking forward to more!
Surely you’ve heard of ‘man maths’? A way men create an argument to justify expenditure that cannot be truly justified 😄
308 GTB? Eh 456? Yeah would drive  599 GTO ? Definitely would drive
@tavarish I can barely afford Ferrari lego sets! I’ll just have to enjoy watching your adventures.
Seeing them at Dennis shop and chatting with him makes this the best one yet. Dennis is such a down to earth dude and such a good person. The only reason I ever watched fast and loud was because of Dennis. Absolute total opposite of Richard.
I am the really happy after a sad time 😊
You're trying to replicate top gear, which top gear wasn't really successful doing themselves untill they got Chris Harris on board. Thumbs down
It’s happening again!!!  Love you T!! Keep up the awesome work!!!!
I really wish you actually made up concrete rules to follow. Cheaper than a Camry? New Camry? Used? 2021 model or 1996? Or the 2010 NASCAR edition from SEMA thats 300k? Make up your damn mind
You guys remind me of the old Top Gear and that is a great thing.
308 is my all time favourite Ferrari!...after the Daytona...
Great episode! Love it!
I literally said it looked like a ford probe, as much as I would take it..... my girl goes yea it kinda does..Lol
Is that the sound of a lambo v10 revving at 22 and 29 seconds while showing a pista 🤔. 16 minutes 14 seconds v10
This is what American top gear  coukd be...not that abomination with Dax and Robb  Cordrey
Should have put cartrek in the title
IDC i think Ed showing up with an 80K ferrari takes away from the spirit of the show.
Good ol Cresson. I’ve got thousands of laps on that place and I still mess it up from time to time. These guys are gonna be a train wreck if they try to go full beans lol!
Pretty awesome
Can you ditch that Tyler guy, he’s dead weight and so annoying. Watching for the other legends.
Great content you guys are like the 3 AMIGOS of the auto world 👌😂😂😂
We should be careful on Money disposal, if you are not spending to earn or get back money,then stop spending..
@hoovies garage 35:33 And they stay there..🙌🙌😂😂📈📈
I love the 456gt I have a 1/18 model of one that I’ve had since I was a kid.
when tj maxx top gear is better than the current top gear.
Tavarish has definetly got the best looking car.
Sorry Freddy, but it must be said... your haircut unfortunately reminds me of Pointy Haired Boss from the Dilbert comics
"Are there any trees on this track?" 🤣
Weezard
Things that annoy me more than life itself. 1) I'm fat 2) Everything aches and I'm only 23 3) I've got a 21:9 Monitor and this ultrawidescreen format footage has been scaled down with fake borders for 16:9...
Great waited for a long time for this
Fantastic! On par with the real Top Gear !
(i'm english how much is a camry)
You need balls of Italianium to get an old Ferrari, and Tavarish sure does have them. And his engine is in the right spot for a supercar. I am going to be rooting for him!
Man I wish I could hack u and get access to all the eps now!! Im so hyped loving this series (DISCLAIMER: IT WAS A JOKE I CANT HACK)
Thanks Dennis
Chrisfix was right. I do enjoy this. Good job fellas.
The 308 allllllll day
Finally! I've been waiting for this for literally before it was made
Please keep up with theses kind of videos, such a Top Gear vibe with a great friend group, amazing!
I wouldn’t have ever used auto tempest or known about it if they hadn’t done these awesome videos, keep it up!!
That 599 has been for sale fffoooorrreeeeevvvvvvvvvveeeerr.
That 599 is beautiful. Hoping they’ll drop a bit more.
Is this the new version of top gear?
Fireee
"Most recognizable brand on Earth"  So Apple?  There are two auto manufacturers in the top 10.  #7 Toyota and #8 Mercedes.   SMH.
Awesome show!
Idk why, in on shot front the sidd during the video - tylers 456 reminded me of a hyundai tiburon
Can you finish the McClaren pls 😔
felt like i was watching top gear. love it!!!
What is up with this color "correction" or like overlay done with any shot that's from a distance?
mis clakson, may n richard.. tq tavarish
Yes yes yes. Auto tempest is the best for supporting this series
These are great.. Love all the Car Trek episodes.  Keep up the good work guys.
Nice to see you taking up the mantle from the old Top Gear segment.
I LOVE THESE!!! I would love to see a car trek where the guys try to find the coolest JDM import they can for under 10k, as that is getting harder and harder, but was one of the biggest appeals from the get go for a lot of people.
"Tyler you have an ugly Ford Probe"  Lol that killed me
308 gtb every day
Wizard stole my wardrobe!
Car Trek is never going to be boring to watch
FREDDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You have to stop sniffing sugar off of dead prostitutes in back alleys and accosting Harrison Ford at a valve stem expo.
Tayohtahh
As every time Ed, always drive the prettiest car of the team, the one I love... And Wizard is my dream mechanics, even without Ms Wizard..!! Thanks for the show... Please do respect these icons...! Thanks
Love these car trek episodes. They just get better and better. Nice job guys.
How did nobody pick a 400i with the automatic? That’s one of the definitive cheap Ferraris.
watched from Bryan,tx
The ad placement in this is horrific!
The credits at the end contain "Special Thanks to Olive Garden Breadsticks" @28:30, nice touch!  Is one of the challenges is going to involve breadsticks or is it going to be a running joke throughout the series?
Wizard: Don’t tell my wife, but I could make love to that car Ed: -Awkward silence- 😂😂😂
I feel sad for all those Porsche’s in the car repair place
3 youtubers fluffing cars for the tempest just another fun  day  on the road great  times 👍
TYLER wInS
Tavarish is a very good narrator !!!
Chrisfix... Thanks for the recommendation ❤️✌️, this is a great serie ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Top gear called they want their everything back
Thanks guys! Always a pleasure to watch cartrek!
LETS FUCKIN GOOOOO #CARTREK4
this needs to be a netflix show
Ed shoft-shoeing around the car being in a flood was amazing.
4:07 great soundtrack  5-10-2021
2:40 - Oh God.... Now something is definitely going to break. Also, the only reason the GTB existed was to fund the racing team. Granted, that's pretty much the only reason any consumer Ferraris existed.
the wizard looks cute
3:57 Ed bolian GOLD hahaha
Honestly the first episode of this stuff i liked. At this point it gets just dumb...
YES! CarTrek!!  I probably should not have watched this instead of finishing my work today...........but I did. :D
YES! CarTrek!!  I probably should not have watched this instead of finishing my work today...........but I did. :D
Ed has a weakness for flooded cars :D
The production quality progression from Car Trek 1 to 4  is insane. Well done!
Superb production guys! Quality keeps getting better and better each series. Enjoying it very much! Greetings from the Netherlands
Love the show...BUT! if your gonna cheat  why bother? that 599 is laughable smh. So now in the next challenge the other two are gonna come up with some stupid mathematical circumstance on there next car challenge that totally ruins the show. Thanks Mr. 599 Camry. STOP CHEATING!
5 minutes in: Ed cheated...Tyler bought a Ferrari almost as good looking as the Ford Probe it was styled to look like...Freddie wins by default. This is going to be good.
I graduated high school in 1978. When you say Ferrari, the first thing that pops into my mind is a 308. If I ever bought a Ferrari the 308 is the one I would want. I actually bought a Fiat X1/9 because that was the closest I could get to a Ferrari.
I am seeing a trend here, all the cheap cars have something to do with Pininfarina
BMW next?
FINNALY!
The Ferrari 612 looks like it wants to kill me...
More of these are in demand.
Here from ChrisFix this is amazing
I never expected to see Dennis, I met the guy about 5 years ago. Super nice guy, he has a YouTube channel too ;).
4 hours ago!! I'm lucky to see it this early
Can't wait for more videos!
I've waited for this for months, can't wait to see Tyler kill it with his Ferrari lol
I didn’t even realise it was another car trek… 🙌😁
Ok bear with me... replace hoovie with literally anyone and this show would be an absolute smash
I watch all of y’all and love all of y’all’s channels and know you all are car people, so why did y’all add a huracan engine over a pista?
Man, Wizard is a G
A fully loaded Camry is 33k so basically Freddy only followed the first rules
This series captures the original Top Gear mystique to a "T"!  I look forward to each new installment (which take entirely too long to appear!), and the friendship (and adversity) between the guys is infectious!  Having the Car Wizard in each competition is just icing on the cake!
ed like to buy submarines, not cars
Finally ive been seeing these cars ive been dying for more information and seeing these babies in action thank you guys best car show on youtube. And thank you car wizard for helping the fellas out. I wanna see the wizards Ferrari
As usual - brilliant 👍🏻
16:50 I have to turn the fan and disconnect the battery. Tyler- never saw Magnum PI do that. Ed- No never, now just drop that positive lead into the water... Love it!
The 308 started its life as a Dino, so it's more like an adopted Ferrari 😀
Tavarish’s headlights change color mid scene LOL
The wizards line about Ed’s car was pure cringe
Enjoyed the first episode
2M Subs by 8-1-21!
My wish is that AutoTempest works on europe too it would be soo fing good
Top gear episode :-)
Who spends 40k on a Camry????
I'm so glad Wizard flirtation towards Ed's Ferrari made the edit, twice.
Ok.. The 456 is getting noticed now. Bet this is Tyler's plan to up the value on them.
TEXAS!!!!<3
I'm glad Ferraris are involved. They all hold a special place in my heart..Freddie I hope you win, you have the best car. 👌
Extremely proud to be a part of this series.. see you soon for round 5 gents.
How has Amazon not made them there own show!
Top gear cinematic style
Yay Cartrek! I love the Cartrek lifestyle every day with my bunch of old Porsches! Good luck guys, looking forward to the adventures
Yeah front engine ferraris are wrong.
Hoovie spoiled it with "Cartrek ruined my Ferrari" in one of his videos
I could have gotten a Mundial for 15k lol
Dear Mr (T)   Again  Great Vlog from you & The TEAM !!   Bless !!
What a boring episode. So you not only rip off Top Gear/Grand Tour cheap car challenges, but you recycle the concept from the first Car Trek, and go from "cheaper than a C8 Corvette" to "cheaper than a Toyota Camry."   To quote Joe Biden: "C'mon man!
Nicely equipped brand new Camry can be bought for $30,000 at my local Toyota dealer (I know, because I own one). None of those are $30,000....
Hope you guys have a safe trip !
Boring
Ed: It was delivered to Vietnam...says so right here. Hoovie: No wonder I like it! Me: Woooooow...well played lol🤣
Where is samcrac?
my dad bought a couple of cars back in the day from auto gallery
My neighbor flipped one of those 308's. He was out in the boonies in central California, accelerating on a curve when he hit gravel. Flipped several times. Was in the hospital a few weeks and had to have part of his neck fused. I don't even know what that is.
Please keep on doing this!
Hoovie really missed the chance to say Ed was in deep water
Great series as always but Freddy missed a golden opportunity at 0:35 for "If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wALArd2rvo)
I've been waiting forever for this to finally come out 1Luv!!!!
WOW! Car Trek is back I can’t wait to see how this adventure plays out!🐟
16k ain’t bad it will still cost under 60k for a 599 that will drive good
lol.. Not even 2mins in and I'm being entertained the same as the old school bad ass top gear.  Really good production!!
None of these cars are the price of a Camry
Not even 60seconds in and I can confidently say.  What an awesome production!!!
Calling a Ferrari a Mustang?  Them's fightin' words!
What a cheap rip-off of TopGear. So not original 🤢
a 308GTB is certainly on my dream car list.
Next on hoodies garage l bought the baby 456 .... aka Peugeot 406 coupe
Best episode yet. Good work! Goods dialogues, actual funny jokes and lines, nice filmography. Kudos guys!
Freddy Freddy Freddy lol
I did not know all these guys were affiliated! Mind blown!!!!!
12:40 True, Ed was a legend in person
Would've been cool if they actually went by the rules like Tavarish lol
The next best thing after Clarkson, Hammond, and May
Wow first CarTrek I am not pulling for Ed lol. Hope next season is affordable American muscle cars
What’s the name of the song in the beginning?
Ed paid 80k for a car then traded a daiblo and got the rari and 40k smart
Cool but remember you cant make any changes to it or get slapped with a lawsuit
I’m giving the win to Fred, his is the price of a Camry, mid engine and looks the best imp
Does this video start by advocating reckless driving?
Okay but I'm with Hoovie, the 456 is gorgeous. Best looking out of the 3 imo.
Who else saw the gang driving around in Dallas? Saw them briefly when I was at a stop light.
130k in 4 hours! So happy this is successful for these guys and autotempest!
Did Tyler’s wife lend him her winter’s coat at the beginning of the show?
Fredy you pick the worst
Been waiting for this to be released for months. And hate to say Freddy didn’t cheat his is the only car in the budget.
Guys, you are HILARIOUS, and yes Wizard, that the gearhead mantra "make luv to a cool car!" LOL. Keep rocking
"Welcome to Texas the land of big cow and big steak and big trucks"😂😂
That ‘78 is beautiful
I want the fastback
Tavarish. Will the 355 motor fit in a 308?
I think for the first time all 3 of them chose the perfect car. A stealth Enzo, a stealth Maranello, and Tom Selleck's Ferrari.
I used to like to watch and a lot of top gear you come really close is really nice to see and also laughs
RIP stradmans dad
Obviously Tyler wins, we arabs take good care of our cars!
Been looking forward to this. You guys are fun to watch.  Sort of like the three stooges (but in a good way).
Another season of Car Trek, thank you for supplying this amazing content!
Wee Zard  Someone lost a bet
These ....look...magnificent
I wish I can buy one of those Jeep’s
ya know what would be funny is if they got three others like casey pustche, doug tabbath, and rabbit would be so funny because they are all so different. like these three dynamic is already so funny and different but yoh add those three and you just have six total nut cases in really cool cars 😂😂 very great start to what is gonna be an amazing series boys
I knew the 'something special' the Car Wizard was gonna do was put on his Magnum PI Hawaiian Shirt!
there's no way he bought a 599 for that cheap
Actually Tavarish, Enzo did give his seal of approval. Just as he did to every Ferrari up to the F40. The 456 GT is my favorite of the 3 here. Thanks.
Lol. "Wizard shop in international waters"
Why do I like this series more than any of your channels individually? Something about the good natured shit talking I guess. At times the scripting is a bit cheesy, but the off the cuff stuff makes up for it. Just really great synergy.
Have I mentioned I love ALL THREE of you guys? Purely platonic of course, no lifesize posters adorning my walls....just sayin....
Oooooh this one is gonna be good
Thank you to AutoTempest, Freddie, Hoovie, and Ed for bringing back this awesome series.   Sincerely, every car enthusiast
I love it!
👍 True, It is uncanny how the light blue 1994 Ferrari 456GT front end and pop up lights, look like a light blue 1994 Ford Probe GT front end and pop up lights.   Both are incredible cars still today 🙂
If you squint really hard Hoovie bought a Ford Probe, Ed grabbed a Nissan 370 and Tavarish settled for a Fiero.
The 456 is the ugliest Ferrari in existence Wtf????
Guys love this!!! I am so jealous, although I can't drive any of these......
Tyler's comment about Vietnam was underrated
I got audibly excited when I saw this thumbnail
This series needs a shoe sponsor!
Love this series you three have created. Very entertaining. Keep making those questionable choices. We all know Freddy is going to be wrenching everyday on that car.
I don’t know if Ferrari is the most recognizable, I think Lamborghini has them beat
Ed entrance !!!!!bad boy bad boys what you gona do when thei came for you!!!!
shout out to CHRISFIX
Damn! Nice job! It gives me old TopGear vibes!
I'm just here for the Big Texas Steaks 🥩
ed not following the rules is just bullshit. Really takes the fun out of it.
I love CarTrek!! Great job guys
I love this ❤️ it remind me of the old top gear episodes
Ferrari V12, 6 speed, pop up headlight and beautiful design... An extra 5k over a Camry is fine by me 😁👍🏾
599 and 456 are my favorite GT's of all time!  Legit, I have an obtainable goal of owning a 456.  Good stuff!
There in Texas so its only right for them to race a ram trx or the  f-150 super snake
Tavarish=Jeremy Clarkson Hoovie=Richard Hammond Ed=James May
They said "Camry Money" not "Used Camry Money"...
LS 70s 308 is a dream car
Why didn’t top gear just ask Ed to just be the whole show?
i would like the 308 GTB because it has the the classic Ferrari looks.
Its only Monday and this has already made my week!
Wait did i see one of your ferraris north west of forth worth,Near by Texas motor speedway like a month ago?
.........or just cheat and get an Alfa Romeo Guila QV since technically it's a mini Ferrari
I want Tavarish to fully restore his Ferrari. It's gonna be a great car!
Great vid. Two things, yes, a 308 would be my dream Ferrari. Also, you have the best narrator voice Freddy.
Amazing cars but the true cost of owning cheap Ferraris
It makes it sound like all 3 were the price of 1 Toyota camry and literally none of them are under 40k which puts them in the Avalon range rather than Camry. Then you've got one more in the supra range. Clickbait much? I'd also rather have a new Avalon and definitely a supra than any of those pieces of junk
Loved every moment of the last 3 series!!! Can’t wait for this epic journey, sounds amazing from What ED described!
10 minutes in and I’m loaded. Remember, for those playing at home, have a drink every time they mention Autotempest.
These are so damn good. So pumped on another series!
Love it can't wait for next episode
Wizard! Now it's a show.
This is the start of the best show to watch!
I’m so happy we have wizard on the show:)
The nearly black purple on the pista is just breathtaking. Probably the most beautiful speced modern Ferrari I have seen so far.
Weeee i am happy for this season 🥳🥳 well wasn’t expecting so early 😉
So much anticipation for this! So stoked it's here!
Finally finally finally
The 599 is not "as fast as a Ferrari Enzo"...0 to 60 is such an amateur stat...look at the LAP TIMES. An Enzo would crush that thing.
It's watching cheating mostly, like who buys a loaded Camry? I understand the reason for a loaded C8...
"death by a thousand cuts"
The seasons keep getting better! You guys are what we all need
When Tob Gear was no more, The Grand Tour replaced it, when The Grand Tour moved to other thing, they stepped up. The Car Trek. Tavarish. Tyler. And... Ed.
Tyler’s 456 kinda looks Camry vanilla ish In a way lol
Ed cheated.  Hoovie still was above the camry price.   Only Freddy bought a ferrari for the price of a camry.   Still going to be fun to watch
*Doug demurro introducing his future children to driving.* 0:01
been waiting for this for so long now, it's finally out! can't wait for the remaining episodes, and even less for new seasons
Slowly turning into the grand tour and just as good
The British guy bought a Boxer BB for 80k and it didn't even run
Cheating is boring
Best thing since the original top gear , love it guys !
The 308 was made for midgets. I'm 6ft 3" and 20 stone and I have to tilt my head to drive it. Magnum PI had his head sticking out the top
You guys are just f****ng epic only way to say it keep it going Brothers.... maybe come to Canada 🇨🇦 get trucks tour here and we will beat them off road see who comes out on top !!!!
Top Gear (Or The Grand Tour) if it had less edit and more talk content.  Honestly it's brilliant, keep it up. Hope this series continues for the long run. We all definitely need stuff like this
For us here is the real world 80K+ is completely unrealistic. I wish you could do a CarTrek on something in the 15 to 20K range
The only problem is that we must wait for part 2. Damn.
And the best series on YouTube is back!
Man you guys would be better hosts for top gear America, hands down...but they would have to bring back Tanner and add 2 more people to make 6 gears
I love the videos like this 😂😂😂
"This..is a road" no shit Sherlock 🤣
To be honest I usually skip annoying sponsors but AutoTempest website helped me finding some rare V12 W221 Mercedes that I couldn't find anywhere.
That 308 looks the best of the three imo
love these guys and their videos when they do the road trips etc really really good
So happy to see You guys back in saddle. 🤘🦅🇺🇸
Awsome so happy cartrek is back
Ferrari 356 = Ford Probe styling
Makes everything look cheaper
I think that the catch phrase of this show is Ed's classic "Of no consequence."
Yesssss i just got so excited seeing this released
So little miles yet so shit...
Cheap -- sexy -- reliable : choose two.
I hope you guys are wearing athletic cups because there's a lot of ball-busting going on! Best Car Trek yet!
you guys put American Top Gear to shame
So cool Dennis is on here! His videos are great!
The new grand tour Ed really is the American Clarkson top work guys 😎👌
Absolutely nailed it! Loved the humour, the jokes were on an other level compared to the first seasons. Can’t wait to see the next episode!
Do Detroit mussels cars next
Tavarish has my favorite of the 3
Reminds me of the classic top gear specials. Keep up the good work guys. These are brilliant
Stick with my Porsche sorry guys 😂😂👍
1:57 Tavarish did it right. No need to continue watching. ... but will.
“Now this is a Pontiac Fiero with a Ferrari body kit, and this blacktop is my playground”
Spoiler alert, Tavarish survived the making of this series 🤣
Waiting for it soooo long
There goes my chances of getting a 308. I
Hell yeah baby, the boys are back in town...👍✌😎🇬🇧🇺🇲🇬🇧🇺🇲🙂
Guys theres only one problem with this whole plot line, you cant have Ed in a 599 that is about perfect regardless of flood or not and Tavarish in a complete hooptie 308 that will never complete the entire event. Ill still watch every one but if ones in a hooptie you all should be in a hooptie
Does the 456 have two oil filters ?
c-ommenting for algorithem
Ed totally cheated.
“Wizards shop in international waters” is that why he’s accumulating a fleet of yachts?
Let’s go ...season 4 🤙🏽
I just don’t know why the phone rings when they get a text message 🤣
Car Trek is awesome guys, the more you do it the better it gets!!
Yes..... yessss YESSSSSS!!!!!!!
I needed another one of these
Wizard:  "I would make love to it?"
I'll disable adblocker and surf on autotempest for 2 hours tonight. These shows are so good!
They nicked this idea of the British TV programme top gear! lol
Awesome show and my favorite 5 guys to boot.
9:19 Wrong, '82 Mondial with a supercharger, Black Friday 2019, Bring a Trailer, $20,000.
Tavarish, the next gen Clarkson Hoovie, the next gen Hammond And the third, you guessed it :-P
Tavarish is the one who should win bt default. the others cheated and imo should be out. but then there would be no show
No lambo is better
Good to see Dennis on here.  As a jeep driver his shop and channel deserve more recognition.  He does absolutely an incredible job
Also I smell a lawsuit coming 😕
gated seems awkward
I mean tbh, Ed did pay 40 grand for it
False, don’t need a lot money to have fun with a car.
Cheap Ferrari..?? One word: Mondial
There were some great jokes in this video but my favorite is Freddys 308. Sorry but that car makes me laugh.
Enzo was still alive in 94 right?
What a cheap Top Gear copy! Don't you ever compare again with the legends!
Funny, entertaining, episode crew, Ed, Hoovie, Tav, nice to see the Wizard. Spot on.
I like how that red mercury cougar is sitting with all those piles of shit. And even if they were running they'd get their wheels handed to them by the cougar.
Dats some top gear stuff 💯💯
hell ye. next time a 4x4 challange, please
Looking forward to the next episode. I used AutoTempest to find last week to find my dream car, a 2020 Camaro SS!
Beginning was very top gearisk
Epic insulting and telling stretchers! Let the fun begin!
If looks were everything, then that 599......
I watch these for the Wizard’s appearance
Great first episode! Cool cameo from Mr Dennis Collins!
You guys should make a separate channel for CarTrek rather than just on Tavarish’s channel
Here we go! Another episode of the grand tou….Hem I mean car trek 😅…anyway guys you are doing a really nice job with this YouTube show…keep it on! Anyway have a nice day cya 😉
That poor old Jag deserves better,  they do 110mph in second gear.
I'm only 4:09 in, and I know Ed cheated. You know what? I don't care! I love it!
Top gear challenge copy and paste!
This is great!!! A new cartrek, i’m also very pleased thats on air again!! Greats from the Netherlands
LOVE THIS!!!!!! please more of this show the wizard is a great party of the show as well❤❤❤❤❤👍🤪🤪🤪🤪
Woahhh...text from AutoTempest!!! Amazing timing! And coincidence 🤔 hmmm..I don't think so...
5:04 "Who are you? The IRS?!?" I'm dying! :D
I'll take that GTB over 488 anyday..
17:07 💫
This is my favourite series ever👍
I felt emotional when you spoke about your family once upon a time and when I saw stardman video the loss of his dad I knew you would know the emotion #respect for you gone higher sit 🙏❤️💯
When it has Pop up... Up and down Headlights.... And they just left them closed most of the time.
Freddie's car will blow up, Ed car will stall and hoovie will drive home
You guys deserve all the credit for all the hard work it has taken to get to this point! Best thing on YT hands down!!!
I'm having Top Gear cheap supercars flashbacks - this is so lit <3
Great episode!   In this Car Trek, you guys sounded a lot more natural and easy to watch if that makes sense.  It didn't seem like it was trying to be something else, everything seemed original and its own.  You guys keep it up and it could become better then the original top gear one day.
Wiiiizzzzard
I wished I knew yall were gonna be in my city Wylie, TX
Sneaking paparazzi shots of y’all driving around in DFW was a ton of fun.
Awesome you guys included Dennis Collins.
Paddle shifters SUCKS!!! GATED SHIFTER IS FERRARI!!
They've cut out some of the ott cringy scripted  annoying crap.  Still room for  improvement .
These guys need to start an actual TV show!
Resto mod the 308 with a mustang drivetrain and interior ! Please!
Freddie got the right Ferrari!!! Go man gooo9o
Apparently laces aren't a thing among Ferrari owners
Did you just call a 599 "basically a mustang" 😱
Would have been better if you guys would have actually follow the rules has in really follow the rules and not play all the stupid games that make those cars still too much for the average person because their way over the price of a Camry in reality you guys are ruining the show
0:00 "THIS... is a road. Today, I am going to review this road, and show you all its quirks and features."
Imagine doing a special with guests for example dde ,emilia, strad that would be so awesome car trek co stars
How is the 456 the best driving experience? I think Dennis was going for the best daily driving car, but I'd assume the 599 would be a better driving car, no?
I love these car trek episodes so much 🤣💯🤙
Please take more high-spec projects till the end... it lately looks like an effort to persuade people to use Auto Tempest to buy second hand cars or cars for projects (OK, but it seems that this is your main driver...)
You guys were in Dallas? As a Dallas native I love this.
This is so nostalgic of when top gear was actually good
Are there any trees on this track?
Tarverish has become so much muscular ?
CarTrek4 Lettssss goooooooooo
Wow...I'd love to have one of those!
Freddy T , you won. That is the most Iconic Ferrari , period.
Finally! I was waiting for that for a long time!
this was fantastic. thanks guys
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 you guy's  are terrible I in a good was.... ✌️
Awesome. Just awesome episode. Thanks guys
I prefer lambo
Look out Ed! The wizard wants to F*** your car!
Fantastic as always
Definitely an ugly ford probe! Lol
I would have the Toyota Camry any day
This is next level guys
I'm almost certain I saw you guys tooling around Atlanta recently? Maybe?
Man I have been waiting! Love the car trek!
I’m ready to u guys to do a budget friendly sport car for high school kids
This is crazy I literally have pictures in that Ferrari  ed bought. We buy most of our vehicles from executive auto Gallery.
You should get Doug to give each one a Doug score next time as one of the challenges
Fantastic cars and challenges. Finally back on form.
With those cars that Ed and Tyler have, they can give Tavarish a head start, then eat dinner & have a siesta,  then put the pedal to the metal.
Hooray a new car trek!!! I love this series
Ugly Ford probe 😂😂😂😂
Now we need a offroad version
Bout damn time boys! I have very much been anticipating this next installment!!
Freddy's car is the most iconc one, all thanks to Thomas Magnum! :)
I feel like I willed this into existence. I actually just re-watched Car Trek 1 last night, as I was becoming increasingly impatient/excited waiting for the newest installment. And I wake up to this.   Thank you.
Chris fix sent us.
Wylie, TX! Thought I recognized where y’all were. Not to far from my stomping grounds.
My grandmother said "relations."
WOOO! I’m in before the Ferrari C&D!!
Hah! Personally I think Tyler's car was the best choice on paper, but I have a feeling it's sat a lot like the 308... Ed's car is doomed. He will break it.
That poor but beautiful Triumph TR3 😍 burning in the sun breaks my heart.
Nobody who can afford it watches your videos!?!
Maybe tag this CarTrek 4 so that it becomes searchable?
Thank you lads wicked as always 👍👍😁
How many lambo sounds can be inserted over a clip with a Ferrari😭
It's like Christmas morning!
Dang who the girl at the end tho? Asking for a friend
Love the format (old TG) need to start making some content in say Mexico or central america to be able to rent tracks and perhaps bring some cars that are not clear titles...
Great Job guys!!
when you said "this" in the beginning i thought i clicked a Doug Demuro video pls-
Can’t wait for the next episode
After soo looong...
Jumping jesus  on 4k  cinematic ice skates!
I was looking forward to this for a loooooooong time...finally another Car Trek series! I'm already enjoying it so much! BTW: Can anyone help me to identify a song? What's that 60s instrumental that can be heard starting at 23:23....fun fact: I heard it a while ago during an episode of Finnegan's Garage, asked the same question in the comments but got no reply. :)
Ford Probe had me rolling
2 guys done it wrong
You guys were literally 10 minutes from me at that race track! Wished I could have met you all! Love the show.
Better then any TV or netflix .
This will be fun again. I like them all, but the 308 gives me the most memories. Looking forward to this serie
Tyler has been wise
Nice to see Jared get a Production Crew credit.......and the special thanks to Olive Garden Breadsticks!
#papastrad
yes sir great Monday cant wait to see what unfolds in this series the three of you are awesome
so is this season 4 because im confused
Would be more fun if they do the rig challenge to. Or competing with British youtuber just like top gear vs German and Australia.
I'm sure there was a flooded f430 somewhere and wouldn't be against seeing another 360 on car trek a perfect ferrari is a perfect ferrari
Hahaha! “What are you the IRS”!? Killed me XD
Top gear rip off !!!
Please for the love of cars🙏. This time don’t make them worse than they started out being... I’m not really a Ferrari guy, but it would still cause me grievous emotional harm seeing these poor cars’ roofs get stood on, or similar mistreatment. Try to remember that of us would give up an important body part just to have the luxury of spending time in one of these, let alone the chance to go on an epic adventure, whilst owning one. Clowning around is fine, but can we remember and respect the objects (arguably) that got some of you guys to where you are today? Wrench every day does not mean Wreck every day (points at Freddie) 😉.
Freddie, assuming the 308 survives, please do a restomod of it that can beat Ed’s 599.
It's funny the Ferrari 308 line of Ferraris has always been my favorite even though they're not the most powerful I love the look of them
Its a shame Tavarish didn't try to drive away looking at the camera with the magnum pi theme, disappointed :) nah just kidding (give me a heart Tavarish lol)
Comments Help
No one : Wizard : don't tell my wife I wanna make love to your ferrari 😂😂😂
Hello Tavarish great video i think you’re Ferrari is the best of the 3.
Hey guys! Chrisfix brought me here
Dennis is such a cool guy
Tavarish gets screwed again... The cheating is really getting excessive here though. Not fair at all. Would have preferred if they actually stuck to the challenge properly. Otherwise it just gets pointless. Not that it isn't entertaining but might as well drop the challenge parameters if they are going to be so excessively loose with the rules.
how well the hair treatment product “keep” working?🤔🤔🤔🤔
Welcome back guys.  Looking forward to future episodes.  Thank you AutoTempest for sponsoring another series.
40,000$ for a Ferrari, I think I need to tell my father to import one and be the  first ferrari in my country Nepal. The tax rates are like three times the price of the car so no one can afford to buy or maintain Supercars like Ferrari, so the rich people here drive mercedes, B.M.W sports cars or   Tesla model 3 or mode y
Technically, if the A/C fails, it's a factory delete, just delayed.
This my favorite series and has better production than many television shows. Keep it up, y'all are doing absolutely amazing.
Jesus Freddie needs a haircut LOL
That was great...so good to see you guys getting more comfortable (better written) with the "Script" and the Wizard too. You can see the difference in editing and shooting....I'm enjoying this series dare i say, more than the new Top Gear UK! Great job all involved.
Can we agree to fire the guy who put lambo v10 sounds over a ferrari?
OMG. Ferrari 308 = my dream car, since before the Hawaiian mustache guy.  Freddy, pleeeease mail me whatever's left of this car. (I might reconsider once I've seen the full series. :D )
Best intro so far!!!
I wonder why they used the sound of a v10 r8 or lamborghini huracan in some scenes. 🤔
Only Ed is interesting here, Tavarish and Hoovie are not
What the hell jacket is Tavarish wearing? He looks like the michelin man
What is that red car on the left??? 17:44
So happy Car Trek is back 👌
im really getting the "top gear vibes" from this video :)
Nice
Freddy is right i rather spend that much less cash and keep some in pocket for repairs! + the GTB is one of my poster cars i had when i was a little kiddo
Your back🥰🥰🥰
I'm so happy this has finally dropped!
Hmmmm, will CarTrek be Discovery's next show?
Once again Freddie gets the shittiest car. LMAO
Awesome Guys thoroughly enjoyed it.
Listen to Hoovie say “hello, Magnum” with your eyes closed and not picture Weird Al Yankovic. #impossible
Now This Is Content.
It may be the slowest car but as a kid when you think Ferrari it was a 308 GTB.
yessss finally! another episode of car trek!
Tavarish and that haircut clinging to scraps.
Might be the best cartrek episode yet!
Wizard, Bolian, Hoovie, AND Tavarish?!  It's like a car enthusiasts version of the Expendables!
Always love this series😍
The 21000 miles on the 308 must be in dog years.
If I had the money, I could find a 550 or 575 Maranello for less. Bet.
Yay cartrek is back ❤️
Freddie's response was great, oh yeah that's active arrow, but it could be a problem at high speed. then I thought Freddie would say oh that won't be a problem, the high speed thing. Then he mentions the AC delete, LOL perfect!!! Or Ed explaining how the previous owner washed the car in a interesting way, LOL!!! Great start to the new series guy's!!!
YouTubes top gear trio fucking Brill.. Edd is defo Clarkson.. Watching in 🇮🇪
"Hello Magnum!"
You guys are so funny together. Love this series! Keep it up, gentlemen.
Earlier today i was wondering wil there be another. And im so fking happy rn
did yall shoot this in wylie tx
Imagine being the person responsible for flooding that Ferrari smh
The phone actually vibrated!  You said you made them up,  did they add that in post, or did you start sending real texts?
How is Freddy all of a sudden the best dressed here? Hmu if anyone knows where I can find that flannel jacket...
Glad to see you uploaded a video! Felt like ages since last one
All Ed has to do is use a few LED lights taped to watch batteries and put them behind the lcd screen.
You three have as much chemistry as the golden standard (00’s-10’s Top Gear ofc).  I truly enjoy these series. You guys rock!!
the new topgear
Man Freddy really found a proper shitbox this time.
Y'all should do a muscle car challenge at some point
All I got to say is Ed and Hoovie cheated! - Ed by buying an double the budget car. - Hoovie by having the wizard do all the major work done before bringing it to the show. - But you are the warranty! Why didn't you show them your true skills! (Meaning - Have Jared fix the car before bringing it to the show)🤣 JK  You guys rock!😎
Mom can we have _Topgear_ ? no we have _Topgear_ at home _Topgear_ at home : this
I love how this is literally top gear
Ed you guy's are fun to watch.....✌️
Finally
I don't get it... how can a 308 GTB be the cheapest Ferrari in the country? There has to be a cheaper Mondial out there
Lol, I  guess cheap is a relative term. The 80k Ed spent would pay off my student loans. 🤪
New Car Trek, damn you guys made my day!
Idk to me the 308 is ugly, just my opinion. The 456 is gorgeous especially with that gated shift and the 599 is awesome too love the c pillar scoop
Fun fact Tennessee actually produces more beef cattle than any other state
Comparing cars that aren't even close to the same realm of value... dis-interested.  If you establish rules, FOLLOW THEM, otherwise its just who has more money.
Ferrari's but no Magic Mike with The Wizard?
what a beautiful ferraris man, fooking love this
Wow, this is your best series yet. You can tell you guys have relaxed and gotten comfortable.
If I had spent $80k on a flooded car, I'd be divorced and homeless looking for a shelter.
I loved it, well done guys can't wait for ep 2, I've been waiting the entire day for this, in fact I've waited months for this, Thank you Autotempest for this really cool show
It's called "museum quality," bcos its shiny, & can only be parked in a museum. It can't actually run, right?
308 all day long
Holy crap, that's like five minutes from where I live. I love how you tried to make suburban Collin County look shady.
Been waiting for this yeoo
This episode is a lie
The way Ed says 'gauge' tho
#Chrisfixit #team
Guys please be fair. I loved car trek 3 because everyone was in their budget whereas here it seems that the cars are unfair only for entertainment purpose. Please look into this!
I really hope Freddy doesn't destroy his car. Would be an awesome resto-mod  on Wrench every day.  Absolutely the best looking car......this from a guy in his 50's....lol
I have a top spec camry with every single option ticked and I definitely didn't pay $45k so sorry Tyler your car ain't Camry money
35:35 🤣🤣🤣Hoovie dropping some T pain/ Dj Khaled on the losers.
Why am I feeling like drunk only after 10 mins to the video? Oh wait, its cartrek Ferrari special.. 😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
CarTrek, keep it going guys!
Oh yeah here we go!!!
I'm so glad I grew up with Top Gear   but damn this is also wonderful!
Very cool that Dennis and Collins Bros Jeep hosted Car Trek and gave Car Wizard a place to do the inspections. Plus once again showing a few of the iconic vehicles Dennis has in his collection.
308 is the coolest…the rest looks like Toyota’s
Love the wizard's personalised glasses
Tyler found it
This is no
I sat in a Rosso Corsa Testarossa 512 tr 30yrs ago. So has a soft spot in my heart and hence is the vintage Ferrari for me, besides the iconic 250 Gt California swb.
Yes, 22:30 is one of the most awkward things I've heard someone say in quite some time...
You need to include Jr from watch Jr go. He would be soo good on cartrek.
I remember when you could pick up a 308 328 for under 20k...  I knew when I saw one at 15k for a 25k mile example I should have bought it.  I have liked the 456- 550 575 style since they were introduced.
"South Vietnam" "No wonder I like it so much" That was awesome🤣
I like the GTB most of the 3.
The wait is over
I love that 308 GTS!
Wow that 07 Ferrari was extremely nice. Even if it was in a flood 🤣
I wish you could keep that Ferrari, Freddy. You look like you could make it stand out and it really looks like it suits you
Yessss they are back. Had to wait for this one for ages
When Hoovie calls out the Wizards name. I feel weird
Man do I love these 🤘 I’ve learned so much & it’s always exciting & thrilling to watch these
tavarish should engine swap the 308GT with a modern engine, the 308 has all that horsepower stealing emissions control crap and its way underpowered compared to modern engines
So happy that Car Trek is back! Absolutely love the banter, and friendship you guys have. Always so much fun to watch.
CARTREK!
Yes yes yes the boys are back 😎👍✌
Great video!!!!!!!! Exactly like top gear back then😎😎😎😎😀😀👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Ford probe wins! :)
Bout time cartrek came back, what up 2 the gang.
O SHIT O SHIT O SHIT O SHIT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SO SO SO SO SO SO FUCKING LONG OMG I LOVE TGE SERIES ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥❤️❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️❤️❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥
Amazing video as always guys and also love to steadman as he just lost his dad
ac delete
Freddy didn't mention the non-operating windows.
I think a harder challenge would be to find a running car under $500.
that's not oil just dripping everywhere... that's active anticorrosion protection... :)
5:15 Still no jackets to buy Ed. Like it,wants to buy. One in Christmas special video is even better. Where,how???
I love that they put the huracan sound ti the ferrari
YouTube gold...
Tavarish wins this round for following the sprit of the rules
From chrisfix 🤩✨
Good stuff.
After watching this I realized I'd rather just get a mustang GT350R😂😂
Well i expected 3 Ferrari mondial but you Guys delivered😂😂👍
*Had no idea that the 456GT had "Active Aerodynamics" UNDER the rear valence, no less.
Great episode!  Definitely gives Grand Tour a run for their money!
308 GTB for the win!
Omg...omg...omg... the new cartrek is finally here 😃
The cheating makes me not want to watch
Enjoyed the episode so much
Still one of the best things to happen in automotive YouTube!  Awesome premise, and I think you guys are hitting your stride on the production side.  Tavarish and Hoovie seem more comfortable talking to a camera that they aren't holding, and the show is developing it's own inside jokes.
Great first episode of new season!! I love all Ferrari’s. I think the 455 GT is the one to own out of the three!
The red one looks the best!
Interesting
It's really feels like the good old tg challenge.
I love the Top Gear and The Grand Tour vibes I get from these videos.
and you fix it with price of brand new LX570
This is exactly like watching top gear who’s clarkson who’s Hammond and may out of you three
.
Seems like a knockoff top gear
18:40 Car Wizard "I've never seen so many Jeeps in my life, is that the theme..." No, because then we might have some off-roading fun instead of yet another Ferrari series.
When ed was telliing the wizard about the flood history of the car it sounded very jeremy Clarkson
The wizard with the trio is my favorite! 🤣🔥
This is a great series.    And, all B.S. aside, AutoTempest is a damn good way to find a vehicle you're looking for.
Ummm McLaren update??? 🤣🤣🤣
I'm having top gear flashbacks
Was hoping to see Denise Collins. Cool. Video. Anyone who hast seen Dennis Collins coffee walk youtube channel should go check it out
Another great video can't wait for more!
Next Cartrek, Freddie has to get a mint car. No more last leg cars Freddie! LOL
Just saying that only 1 of these cars is in the classic red that every kid dreams of when they want a Ferrari that holds some weight in my eyes!
"A/C delete car".   LMAO
Wow hot chick wearing red vinyl G suit in high heels, yummy
Freddy's hair has just as much "character" as the GTB 🤣
Sorry Tavarish but anytime you bring those two car trek guys on with you, I just stop watching. They lack personality and energy, very boring with those guys. Stick with Jared he's got personality and energy.
Been waiting for this one!
26:15 "its a feature not a bug" aight tod relax
It’s that time of the year again, BRING ON THE CAR TREK.   Also, welcome to Texas. What it do!?!
There is no way Freddys car only has 30.000 Miles . Maybe 230.000 miles
Finally I  been waiting for this always entertaining this should be a regular series.
Btec topgear
Incredible episode!  Can’t wait for part 2
„Museum quality” aka not ready for driving
Well done guys the best you should the TOP GEAR OF THE WORLD 🌎
Are Camrys that cheap over there? A Top-Spec Hybrid Camry here in Germany will cost you 50.000 Euros, which is roughly 60.000 Dollars, including VAT
What a wonderful video series! Great friends! Great times!!
Man the production quality keeps on improving - really hard to believe thats even possible
Been waiting for you guys on this one this is my top gear USA with you 3 doing this
28:36 NO ONE IS CATCHING THIS JOKE OMFGGGGG
Also I love the feel of the vid.  It brings nostalgia of original Top Gear... Hopefully you guys will fill the hole, that the aging host has left in me.  Also looking forward to a lotus themed episode, lotus fanboy here.
i've been waiting for this for so long!
Can you install the manual transmission in the Mercedes already ... Please 🥺
Ed always working on contingencies 😅
Honestly, I’d take the GTB. In a world of hellcats and lambos, the driving excitement at driving speeds is a great experience. I have a hemi charger, and feel like I’m never really using it’s potential because it just goes. And it’s only 370hp. My previous V6 challenger was a more spirited drive, autosticking through the gears, running up the rpms and not really speeding. Now I love the sound and go of the v8 when I get to use it, but that’s so rare. Plus a old car with no drivers aids is just fun
why is the color off? looks like there was a filter placed on the lens or something that makes the video seem dark and washed out
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZARD!
No body driving a Mondial lol
YES CAR TREK
To be fair we know at some point Freddy is going to cheap so it fair for Edd and Tyler to get head of game.
1950's/60's il Commendatore might be rolling in his grave to here the mid-engined one being called the "real Ferrari" -  in those days "the horse should always pull the cart." That said, good thing he didn't continue to believe that...
Hey I fixed my transmission gasket the exact same way when it started leaking. I don't appreciate my silicone artisanship being denigrated this way wizard!
Sell me 1 for 500 bucks
Mimicking the old top gear trio in every good way. Keep it up.
Finally! I love the chemistry that you guys have in this episode.
You guys made this show like old top gear UK. Thanks for saving the car show industry. Man does top gear suck now 🤣
The 308b is the prettiest
2 or 3%? :)
Leeeettttsssd ggggggoooo
Something to relax with after a day of screaming kids. Thank goodness 😌
Tavarish my dude, they uhm..... They went at you with no lube.
I’m surprised the repair costs for these are relatively low. A sorted 599 for 60 K? That’s dirt cheap for a v 12 Ferrari.
Personally, that 456 is the most beautiful.
That 308 engine bay look like it could fit an Audi 5cyl... Someone do it.
I don’t think McDonald’s makes cars
R.IP Papa strad
Best part was Car Wizard saying he could make love to Ed’s Ferrari lol!
I saw Ed's video telling us about this bid and it was already up. It's been up for 45 minutes But I consider myself fortunate to be off on a Monday and one of the 1st people to see this. I'm not even halfway through this one and I can't wait for the finale! Yes #Edcheated should be trending if fair is fair.. but it's not.  Just an idea but for the next cartrek I think you should buy the cars, then drive them then sell them to see who is the best buyer/seller and can walk away with the most cash after driving the cars for several days and as many thousands of miles. (Maybe then ed won't spend more than the rules allow because its not something he gets to keep!) I drive a fusion.. I'd love to own a porche one (one without the runny egg headlights) but It'll never happen.  I may never achieve my dream car but I love watching u guys.. tavarish has found a niche for finding a car in deplorable condition and making it something everyone would want and that has been amazing to watch.  What you guys have done and continue to do is always worth the click and the time it takes to watch.  Autotempest is dope for doing these and I hope they keep em' coming..
Ok, so buy a Camry. Got it.
I have to admit,  I love to see Hoovie and the Wizard working together.
Yes! CarTrek! As a child of the 80s, I have to say that Freddie's 308 GTB is doing it for me! You need some shorty khaki shorts, a Detroit Tigers cap, a hula shirt, and M1911 .45 APC
The GTB is the best looking of the 3. 😎
“To wash it in a unique way” 😂😂🤣😂😂🤣
this is the least cringy episode so far, you are all improving
As always rooting against the villain of show Freddy, but this season instead of rooting the likable Tyler who always winI rooting underdog Edd who picked car with the best history but could never win. I wouldn’t be upset if Tyler win as long Freddy doesn’t win but still go Edd I believe in
Yyyyyeeeeessssss
Stick the f355 engine from hoovies ferarri in the 308.
Ed's flood puns really held some water for me.  Tavarish seems to be a big fan of cars with inoperable windows.  Hoovie made a good, but boring choice.
Loved this episode! You all are really hitting your stride. The first 3 seasons of cartrek, I though you all were trying way too hard to be funny. I cringed at a lot of the scenes, especially when Ed was just saying ridiculous things. This episode really feels like you all are being yourselves and is really enjoyable coming from someone subscribed to all 3 of your channels.
Top gear style
Yesss.  So happy for a new series!!!!  Gotta love Ferraris. Even broken ones
I like the 308
This is pure GOLD.
Tyler: "So anything else you noticed that isn't Concorde Quality" -- you know the plane that leaks on the runway until it reaches cruising altitude to seal the pipes and tank.
#blessed
I've been to Colins Brothers many times, drive by it often - never knew all that stuff and history (not to mention the owner's pedigree) existed there. You guys are awesome and I'm extremely jealous of each of you.
Best one yet.
car trek is back baby YEA LETS GO
Top gear vibes 👌
I was seriously disappointed when this episode ended. Good work you guys.
which guy is richard hammond?
My You Tube family are out playing again 😂 great stuff guys.... but sad that Ed sold his Hoovey Twinnsey Diablo .....
as usual, like before watch, making coffee and right back at ya ;) all best from amsterdam.
Big up Car Trek! Much love from the UK💙
These 4 make an awesome car episode.  Very entertaining.
I like to think Ed and Freddie hear "Tyler Wins, Tyler Wins." in their nightmares
I can see Wizard and Hoovie double teaming the Lambo Diablo lol. or should I say make love
I leave this comment on every car trek season openers.  This is what the car community is about, living the dream, while getting paid to do it!  Ed reminds me of Clarkson, Freddy of May and Tyler of Hammond. The proper trio
The Top Gear/Grand Tour influence is strong, as is the chemistry. Neither of these fellas can be pegged for any one of the OGs May, Hammond, or Clarkson, but each possesses the essence of all three in some quantity.   Car Trek genuinely deserves hefty corporate capital to allow for a quarterly series. The crossover potential with other YouTubers is unlimited. Personally, I'd love to see a classic American car series with Derek from Vice Grip Garage. Have the fellas each pick a car from '58-72', then give them 48 hours each with Derek to get road worthy, then let the challenges begin.
This is by far the most relaxed the hosts have been in front of the camera. Everything has come together/gelled. Well done CarTrek Team.
I love you guys
Thai is like Top Gear without throwing steaks.
Ed likes his flooded cars
I am British and grew up on Top Gear, watching Clarkson, Hammond and May. I now watch them on the Grand Tour (When they get around to releasing episodes) You guys are not only enjoyable, comparable and comedic but I enjoy watching you almost as much and I thank you for continuing to make incredible content on YouTube.
Quote of the episode: Ed Vision, makes everything look cheaper...
Love this series. Freddy, Hoovie, Ed and Car Wizard reference to Magnum PI 😎 And film crew
“Most recognizable brand in the world”😭😂😂
Hell yeah! Tavarish's Ferrari may not be the fastest but it definitely is the better looking of the three.
Holy crap, the vibe of this is so perfect.
I love the Car Wizard!
Well, whatever the hell I was planning on doing right now can wait all of a sudden.
This series always makes me smile!!!!! Ferrari is the best
Have been anxiously looking forward to this. Can’t wait to see how Freddie’s catastrophically fails this time!
Tight, tight, tight. I mean that about the video and specifically Ed's jeans
LMFAO at the Wizards comment as it comes to Ed's inspection !!
The best Top Gear Clone , including the new BBC "effort" - Brilliant piece of work guys
Next time they show up in million dollar ferraris claiming their monthly lease payment is lower then a toyota camry´s pricetag so its within the rules.
Wow.  These just keep getting better.  Thank you all for doing this.  I can assure you that we enjoy them.
Ferrari 308 vs. .308 Winchester
I call Bulls... . there shoulda been a mondial in the mix if Ed didn't cheat.
Ah how I have been waiting for this!!!
Oh my ... it is like The Grand Tour ... but from AliExpress.  However, this must have taken a lot of work, so congrats for the effort.
YAY
I’ve been waiting for this!!
nice
That GTB is sexy tho
The wizard is the kind of guy that marries your sister
So exactly like Top Gear does!
Freddie has nothing to worry about if his catches Fire Edd's will still carry plenty of water to put it out ;)
Why doesn't this have the usual car trek branding and logos? You don't call it car trek in the video title, you don't use the car trek opening from the last few...did you guys get in trouble?
Road Party cabang amerika 👍👍👍👍👍
Just love Car Trek 😁😁👍
Amazing job on the intro..
I'm really vibing with this budge Top Gear that isn't Top Gear
Yay my favorite show is back!
I believe I’ve seen Tyler’s 456 once here in Dubai
Tavarish found a 308 for 30 grand?  How?  Can I?
Pininfarina? The same company behind Coke Freestyle machines?
Quality is slowly improving! Good job lads!
You guys should make a channel for CarTreck!
Emergerd! Squee! And Other teenage girl boy band reactions.
“THIS IS THE ROAD” Doug is that you !? How about Doug being the narrator for cartrek 5
Great Monday surprise. Might wind up being the best Car Trek yet. Love that they bring in my guy Wiiiiiizard! The car whisperer!
Alright Ed 100% cheated and we can all agree
noticed they used Huracan v10 noises on a 488 driving, not a big deal just something that bothered me a bit.
I would love to hear your "Ferrari's I missed out on buying" stories.
Thanks AutoTempest for allowing us to make this series.  Hope everyone enjoys!
Ed Wear Hublot on his wrist , and I don’t knows Tyler’s Submariner is real or fake
Timestamp 22:30 - Wizard could make love to the car???? Uhmmmm Awkward! Lol
tylers car looks like richard hammond from the grand tours old car
Hells yea!!  Edit: Ed is the 🐐
308 is onelove <3
Finalfuckingly! Thanks guys
Epic
Enzo Ferrari said and I quote: The horse pulls the carriage not oth way around. Sorry Freddy, you are wrong
Love it. Although one of these seasons you're going to have to flip the script and buy Camrys. I mean, they do race them in NASCAR so... Either way, I'd watch it so long as the wizard isn't making love to anything.
i really really wanna know what their backup car(s) are for this season
i love cars, restorations and tavarsih but i cant make myself watch cartrek and i dont know why
Finally! I've I've so looking forward to this since hoovie mentioned it back in Feb (at least I think it was feb)
'Highly illegal' is a phrase that's highly under used
Lol with all the cheating it’s more like “for the price of a new RAV4” (still considering the Ed Bolian mental gymnastics)
LETS GO CARTREK LETS GO
You guys are brilliant together or apart, I have a thing for Freddie's car because I'm old, I'd kill to own Ed's car, but I agree Tyler's car is the best, Rj in Oz
Love the new season!
5+ commercials, always thumbs down.
No joke I was actually thinking about car Trek today
It's not so much the condition of the 308 that offends me as much as it is the 'modifications' done in period that some nut thought was an improvement over stock. The GTB is such a naturally beautiful car that looking at this one has me think of those really beautiful girls who go out and ruin themselves by getting any number of tattoos or piercings thinking that it makes them look better.   Good job guys, I'm looking forward to the future episodes.
You guys have to keep doing these shows they are fantastic!!!!!
👍
Tyler is the type to sneak in and steal your girlfriend
Now that's called leveling up 💥
Lol... I love you guys🤣😂🤣
I love that your video series on this channel are nicer quality then most tv series shows on motor trend on cable tv 😂
Please don't tell me that the 456 GT is going to die.
My 3 favorite car presenters, driving my favorite car brand, filmed by a professional crew?  Sign me up.
>Powersteering Rack needs a rebuild  Oh Wizard, have you forgotten the Diablo Fiasco so easily? I wouldn't trust any rebuilder after that nonsense.
Oh god yes !
Finding a Ferrari for the price of a Camry is only a challenge if you DON'T use auto tempest.
So happy to see Car Trek back!!
Send Ed's  Ferraris gauge screen to northridge fix, search on YouTube
Tavarish it's time to let go 😭🙏
Autotempest ftw!  Love the vids
To much top gear... sorry guys...what a lack of imagination... 🤔
I'm waiting for Tavarish to release " We Bought 3 Cheap Toyota Camrys"
8:04 yikes😬
CarTrek is just amazing!!!!
More like 3 cars with dealer service bills that would buy 3 camrys
Who here is excited to finally see Cartrek?
Am I the only one who thinks that they have over done CarTrek already. Once a year would be fine, but they've done like 3 of them in the last 12 months.
"Mom,  can we watch The Grand Tour?" "We have The Grand Tour at home" *Grand Tour at home:*
You guys are basically the Richard Hammond Jeremy Clarkson and James May of youtube I cant wait to wait to see how this season goes!!!
Yes, it's back!!!
456 with the gated shifter obviously wins it all no matter what
The most excellent start to the week! Have been so excited for this for so long! Welcome back guys! Anxiously awaiting the rest of the series.
Oh yess car trek is back baby!!!
Tanks for a nother one!😍 I hope you make thousends more! A Ferrari Maranello would cost also somewhere like 40-50k?
i love the 599 🥰😍 is one of my Dream Ferrari‘s with the F430 and 360 🥰
Can we replace Ed Bolian with ChrisFix?
Outrageous behaviour from the start, dis gonna be good! 🤣
That's a nice Mercury Cougar next to the Jaaaaag.
ah yes car trek is back! This week is going to be amazing
YES! the kings of the slip on shoes do it again.... vrooooom
Ill take the camry over every ferrari in the world every day
Thank you auto temps and everyone! This made my day better
Would love to see a domestic vehicle version of cartrek as there is alot if desirable domestic cars out there
I love this show !!
I knew the show was coming, but Craig Lieberman reminded me it was today.
I think I'll pause my work to see this and then get on with my life
this is the "new" top gear
Top Gear for dummies.
Timestamp: 15:30 - Did Ed just say that a window noise was like your grandmother saying the word, intercourse????? Dad Joke Level = Cringeworthy Master.
The thank you’s including Olive Garden breadsticks. 🤣🤣💀🤣🤣
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
YES!!! It's time for the new series
The commercials are getting out of hand on these videos!
yess
Love this!
Finally We have something after top gear
Yah Top Gear number 5, but done like the Likes of Clarkson, May and Hammond used to do.  Much prefer this to the new Top Gear. Who's with me?
omg the cinemotography is amazing please do more :D
now how long to wait??
Wow, I’m glad Tyler ended up with that car!!! Saw it pop up for sale and he was the first person I thought of
I am silently hoping that y'all won't bust up the "nicer" of the three ferraris... but this is Car Trek and shit will happen. XD
I love this one
Anyone else notice Freddie's headlight covers magically becoming the same color 😂
I'm sorry guys. I'm subbed to all 3 of you but you aren't Top Gears' Clarkson, Hammond and May. This just makes me cringe. Make something original.
Dont ever stop making these episodes!!
In my opinion travarish has won even if it looses all challenges just because I really want a 308
FINALLY😍😍
20:25 are those prescription car wizard glasses ?!
28:38 thats a good joke
"This is a road" sounds like something Doug DeMuro would say 😂
Just when I feel Top Gear here in the UK are finding their feet. Then you have to put this out, and I realise Top Gear still has a long way to go.......😕 (But they are getting there)is  Edit: spelling because..........school.😳
Man- Is it just me? I've always LOVED the look of the 456GT... (Of course, those 599's ain't too bad, either!)
Best episode! Very good production
Finally i would like to see  the next car trek about the cheapest sleeper cars that can be super cars
"Don't tell my wife that I'd make love to this car" Extreme hol' up moment
YAY!!!! CarTreck is back baby 😀😀😀😀
This is it
Next do the best Lamborghini for a price of a ford focus base model
I think sticking to the budget would've been better. But great job.
Now THIS is what we all loved about Top Gear specials. Let's gooo!!!
Best way to spend my lunch
Why did the 488 Pista in the beginning get dubbed over with v10 sounds? I'm not mad, just...disappointed.
Btw watching all the adds all the way through to help support the budget for the next series. Because Its worth the 30 seconds...
We’ve come a long way since Tavarish and the MR2 and hoovie’s Chrysler LeBaron
Crap.
A MANUAL 456!!! Hoovie wins out of the gate, sorry boys.
Bro I love car trek
Ed already makes my skin crawl a bit but when he said that "no one dreams of a 308" he lost all credibility.
That V12 that eds driving has an engine note that car guys live for my God that car sounds incredible man oh man
I love how the cars you guys choose literally always fit your channel styles lol
Yes boys! Glad ya back needed this in my life right now!
Why r u gay wizard?
wife just got a new camary........2021....
stop the cheating, it really takes away from the fun of it.
Loving the interstellar vibe music as Tavarish reviewed his car.
I will always love these series. Please never stop😂
Hoovie wins. The 456 is one of the single best looking Ferraris ever made.
I hope Ed gets docked points on every remaining challenge for cheating so badly here.
10 minutes in and I can honestly say you guys hit the nail on the head with this one! Great job guys!
Car Wizard: "Is there any history with the car at all?" Ed: "No, it's ready for Pebble Beach"  Car Wizard: '"I find that hard to believe coming from Ed Bolian" 😂😂😂
so hype!
THIS?????? is a road.
I don't think I've ever clicked faster on anything in my life.
I like that the Revving sound effect is of a Lamborghini v10
so excited for this again!!
hm. 2 minutes longer than lunch break. we can do this team
Guys..if you set up the rules, why does at least one of you cheat every time??  It takes away from the actual fun of the challenge.  Makes no sense to set any parameters if one of you will always cheat to get around them.
OH YEEEEEEAH I WAS GONNA STUDY FOR MY FINALS, NOT TODAY
Old Top Gear copy paste!
Cartrek! Just what we all need to see!
The red one all day every day i love this model
Hoovies Ferrari looks like a Ford Probe with a Ferrari badge.
great series guys, but why the lamborghini sounds.....
Letsss gooo
Man this is the new top gear and I love it
Beautiful intro. Just like the old Top Gear intros
This shouldve been Top Gear America
Idc. Ed’s 599 just win by default. The most raddest GT Ferrari ever made
Hoovie's car looks like an MR2.
Keep this car at the end of car trek and restore it and do a few engine mods
Geeezzzz.... Hoovie is everywhere!!!!  OMG!!!  And The Wizard!!!  Totally AWESOME!!!
I clocked it before I even realized what it was 😂👨🏻‍🦯👨🏻‍🦯
Woohooo CarTrek
Is it me or some Ferrari voodoo magic but i wish for 308 most. But there is possibilities that I'm bias because i drive red Italian car :) for 13 years
Tavarish you're the man. Thanks!
There all Ferrari can’t complain
Be host I would buy red ferrria but if is fixed for 55k usd of course or can buy that silver one for 55k budget look good least one is exp lot 100k for one why
😃
These three together is pure entertainment 🤣
boi do i like car trek
Wow, its back?
Love the manual in the 456
this is way way WAY better than top gear america by far
Finally my favourite YouTube TopGear show is back ✌❤
👍
I have enjoyed every single minute of Car Trek I've watched.  Great job!
This feels like a Top gear episode! Love it!
You guys should do this for a living. I mean your own tv show.
Hopefully my man Tavarish wins this...and not Hoovie again! 🤞😬
I was waiting to see which one enjoyed a swim lmao  I love these!
Yesssss, finally!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
308 by far the best prettiest ferrari of the bunch frankly I think the modern fezzas suck the 308 is a proper piece of amazingness
Oh yeah new serie!!!!
seeing yall drive around literally right where I live is sad since I never got to see yall.
Amazing great work guys!
Oh yes, Car Trek is back 😀😀
It's about time to stop studying for my algebra final anyway...
YAAAAHH ITS TIME
Freddie wins, in my opinion.  The 308 is my favorite Ferrari!  I know it's a bright red pile of trouble, but I'd take it everyday.  I'm going to enjoy this series.
Bro like an hour ago I sat there thinking, when is cartrek coming out?
Since your in Texas you should stop by Demolition Ranch. Also didn't Ed learn his lesson the first time with his Flooded Lamborghini in the first season?
I’ve been waiting so long for this!
Exited for this one!
Love CarTrek and Tavarish's Flannel too!
599 GTO IS STUNNING
i like cars
Thank you gentlemen I have been waiting on this. Lol....you guys make some awesome 👌videos.
I'm always late to comment :-(
I’m probably going to rewatch this 10 years later
So exited for this new season!!
This is a road...😂😅🤣 Asphalt? It’s your own Ass Fault if you over pay!
yayyyy we are back
What Tavarish doesn't recognize is that the front engine Ferrari is really what a Ferrari should be. At least according to us old school people
Aw yeah new car trek!!! :D
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A FORD PROBE!
I'm geeking out about the 308 knowing it set a cannonball record. Not that one exactly but a 308 did
The 94 Ferrari looks like the 94 Celica that you actually wanted
"Who are you THE IRS?"
Finally
Yay!!!!!!!!!
So hyped for this
Did you leave the lift up on the Pista in the intro?
JUST REFRESHED TO SEE IF THIS WAS POSTED YES
You know, while I've been really enjoying this show, I think it's about time we get a "normal" car challenge, well, actually *cheap* car challenge, sub $1-2k. Always felt these were the best TG challenges back in the days
Yeahh
Where in the heck is Ed getting a Diablo for $78K??
Bruh how tf do you find these damn cars omg, us peasants over here cant find these little shits
I certainly didn't expect CarTrek 4 in my feed
i've never been so early... this is fun
Huge thanks to AutoTempest for letting us do this again. This was our craziest adventure yet.
Yesterday I was just wondering...when will the new series come? And it came 💯 and im excited
I rather prefer to buy a Toyota . I don’t know maybe because I’m poor and I can’t handle the maintenance or maybe because is stupid to have a Ferrari when you can’t use all his power on the road? Anyways good video as always.
production is WAY up! Good job guys!
Love how Ed released a video a couple hours ago to justify his overspending
Wrench every day guys
The production quality is top notch! Always enjoy watching you guys do what you do...buying questionable vehicles
the wheels on the 599 are awful and need to be changed
It's already christmas ?!
At last!!! This is what I've been waiting for, thanks, Ed, Freddy & Tyler!!! 👍👍😊
Wow! You guys really crushed it on this one! I’m impressed.
YES!!! ITS FINALLY YIME FOR CAR TREK!👍😊💙
Finally!!!getting the popcorn!!
First time I watched a full paid promotion video intro without skipping, was like a Fast and furious trailer 😂
