Why he had to do James like that lol. Threw him all the way to Leeds
Notice how everyone in man united are wearing the bruno pen taker shirt, and the sancho man united devil badge. But Cristiano's pen taker sponsor is him and the united badge is him.
Why are you always showing Ronaldo as mean and never once actually said and showed in his character something nice😢!!!!! He is coming home to the red devils and all of a sudden He is again the bad and mean guy!!! Disgracefull of what you did with Ronaldo ripping off the shirt of Cavani who actually freely gave up the shirt!!!! Really not nice at all!!! Shame on you!!!!

Ronaldo throwing the balon dor at bruno to take the freekick is legendary LMAO
Suuiiii

Poor donny
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Everytime people underestimate rono and his class ....... Juventus didn't use him as the center point as real did...... don't expect him to do it alone in this age.....but make him the center of plan... there will be result.
Cristiano Ronaldo is not arrogant as he is painted here, and everyone believes it, It is parody but it completely distorts who Ronaldo is and what he means for Manchester United...Messi is painted as the good guy when he is the opposite and accepted to go to PSG for money and not like Cristiano who accepted Manchester for love of the club risking his own glory.
라이언깊숙 수갑 시발 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It was City that said no to Ronaldo not Rinaldo that said no to City. He wanted to go to City, City was not interested so he suddenly went to Man Utd.

Funniest shit I've seen since monke memes 😂😂😂
Mark Goldbridge 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So funny cartoon😅😅😂😂😂
When Ronaldo pulled the shirt off Cavani as he lay helpless . Poor guy didn't even spend much time in the spotlight 😂😂
City have very bad board, we all want Ronaldo at utd, but Ronaldo at city, he gonna score 40 + goals
Siiiiiuuuuuuuu CR7 to Man United
Welcome back to 2008
What is Phil Jones doing in the back 😂😂😂
phil jones face😂
Ronaldo will help United a lot, but we still won’t win much.
why do it have to be so offensive ffs it's a team and Ronaldo himself knows Bruno are great at penalties 442oons are doing alot of players wrong with that mentallity
The best thing was mark goldbridge blow up dolls 😂😂😂😂
Ciiiiiiiiiiiir
Hope wish to see Christano Ronaldo in Indian super league football starting November welcome Legend champion 🇮🇳✌️❤️🙏🏽🎭
Yeah I found a guy in the Pic (0:52 sec)
Not even 1 minute later:*man united legends appears*
What the f*** is Mark doing?😭😭😭😭

This vid was so nice... I HAD TO watch it twice
Displayed his arrogance so well dude well done!  🤣🤣🤣🤣
There defiantly should have been an appearance from Fred messing around on the field
If you want a handwritten letter ✉📬 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvlSjJz61rg
Now do a champions league draw
👍
hahahahaha so funny video .. best funny clip is what do you mean he is not coming
Suuuuuuuuuuuiiiiiiiii❤️
City didn’t buy messi because of financial fair play. They had already spent £100 million on Jack Grealish.  They didn’t get Kane because he can’t leave spurs (levy won’t let him)  And city didn’t get Ronaldo because they didn’t want him. Ronaldo isn’t really a team player and he wouldn’t fit into the team
Suuuuuuu
Lol
Just see Pep 😂
Next messis first day at psg then varanes first day at man unt
U should have put sir Alex instead of ole
Who tought this transfer wouldn't be possible after I heard this transfer i was surprised i tought he was going to man city who tought the same.

LOVE IT , VIVA RONALDO ! ❤❤❤👌😍
Bruno has lost his penalty privileges
I was waiting for this 😹😹
Love the fact that every pen they use has bruno on it
CR7 as a rubber doll, haha! If only he could see this video and stop stripping.
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Goldbridge 😂😂😂
Thanks for the video
Argantaldo is here
Am I the only one to see the Bruno face in the pen
GOLDBRIDGE Lmaoooooo
Yes finally
I Can Repeat It All The Day 😂😂😂😂😂.
Is it really fair for Ronaldo to steal the number 7 shirt?
Anyone else notice the pen is Bruno's head lolol
Good video bro!
Do something for Ed Woodward 🤷‍♂️
so funny 🤣😆😂
Honestly you are a genius
Fun Fact: Last time Ronaldo was at Man u, Ole still played
Epic content Dean lol !!!!
CAVANI 😂😂😂
1:13 😭😭🤣
Where’s Varane??
VDB 😭😭🤣🤣
Who else saw Phil Jones at 0:52?
That Mark Goldbridge scene lmaooo
Great vid as usual!!!
Did anyone saw where cavani gets his new number 🤢
Finaly
0:51 JONES AT BACK HAHAHAHAHA love it !!
Him throwing the Ballon D'Or at Bruno. 😭😭
finally waited for it for sooo long
Great video again penaldo strikes again!
Ronnys first day at Man U! And brunos last day at taking penalty
Ronaldo when he hears the give it to Edi Cavani song:Oh so you have chosen death. LOL
This took a while, so this better be epic
Good vid
Can't they let Cavani keep the #7, he broke the curse after all
Great vid
England cant get euro trophy but did get cr7 as trophy 😛
I like the photo in which Lord Phil Jones comes up
Pep guardiola: WhAt dO yOu mEaN hE’S nOt cOmInG ?! 😂
SIIIIIIIIIIIIIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU you later Man City           Pep to VAR when Ronaldo wins treble : HOW COULD YOU DO THIS F*CKIN VAR, WHY YOU DISALLOWED THE MOVE ? How were we offside ? I mean like we did somehow pay £100m for Grealish, but still !
442oons idea from a comment lovely <3
Completely overlooked and forgot about Jason Sancho
Arteta's first day at the job searching center
FINALLY!
Gg
Didn't City reject CR7?
I wish 442oons would've Done Messi first Day at Psg
hate it
0:28 That's literally missed.
everyone ended up in great teams and mendy ended up in jail
ههههههههههه😂🤣
"What do you mean his not comin?"
Do messi's first day at psg
SUUUUUIIII
I liked the detail when solsjkaer shot the bullet at van de beeks foot. United fans will get it😅
early
Gotta give us Dan James first day at Leeds
Goldbridge with those dolls scared the hell out of me lol
YES
Dean, can we pls have those Bruno whiteboard markers as merch????
😆😆
The mark goldbridge clips had me dead 😂😂
The question is where is Varane and Pogba?
So since Dan James signed for Leeds, that means Cavani will wear 21? And 7 will be Ronaldo? Any suggestion?
1:40 giggs in handcuff🤣😂
0:56 jajjaja james
I love 442oons  the best football channel in the world and thank for making my favourite player
Absolutely love it but can u do a Messi one for PSG
now i can present the champions leageu
with agent bruno and ronaldo in the team, its only a matter of time before man utd turns into wolves
Brilliant
This is amazing😅😅😅😅😅
Let's go I tell 442oons to do it
lets go..GGMU
Now we will see more penalty drama
Welcome Ronaldo to Manchester united After leveing in 2009
Looks like bruno will not be taking penalties for man ud this season.2nd edison cavini is at the exit doir as man utd dont need  him,3rd, dan james deserves to go to leeds as sancho anc ronaldox and mason greenwood are up front, and pep  guardiola would not want to pay twice, twics as much fee for him, no mesdi for city checlx no harry kane for them check anz no ronaldo for man city check, another season with a no9 for the blur moon half of manchestee
Cant wait for him to play against young boys        Wait..
Goldbridge 😂😂
I will take Roy Keane and Scholsey at 50 and 46 as our Midfield duo today itself
Goldbridge 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Dean is too good 0:52
He missed and still said siuuu
Dean is more productive than Arteta. Then again, that's not difficult
Hey Its Not Ronaldos 1st Day at Man utd its ronaldos 2s Day at Man utd
Bruno not taking penalties with Portugal and Man U. is one of the most ironic things.
That noise ronaldo makes lmfao 🤣🤣🤣
Viva Ronaldo 😍
Noice
Ronnie scoring that freekick is so unrealistic ...it would have prolly hit the wall as usual irl🤣
Messi to psg first day
😆😆😆
Lol was about to say it wasn't his first day

Keep up the good work 442oons. Can't wait for more videos. This channel deserves an award for best animated football cartoons.
Salúdame 442oons, Thank you
I was wondering where the 442oons video on Ronaldo was, Lo and Behold, this appears in my subbox
The way he just threw Dan James 😭😭😭😹😹
Can't wait for 11th September ❤️ Imagine the atmosphere at OT 🔥🔥❤️
Hopefully, one more video will be done unless Real Madrid hurry up with Mbappes' signing until the transfer door is closed
Pep: How many times have we been robbed in this transfer window? THRICE! THRICE! THRICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Amazing video 😂😂 VIVA Ronaldooo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love ole's voice it's so funny😂
Ronaldo is the only legend whose free kicks got worse day by day but still it's so good!
FPL is also booming right now his price is 12.5 and I think he'll be the most captained
The Mark goldbridge collab 🤣
From getting bullied by Neymar and Mbappe at PSG to now get bullied by Ronaldo  It's not easy to be Cavani 😂.
1:14 to 1:19 😂🤣
Everyone say " SUU" for Ronaldo

Pep when Ron scores against City in the UCL final: He used us for a move! Twice! TWICEEEEEE!!!  For all of you dorks saying: "United in the final, what a joke." It wasn't meant to be a prediction, I never thought United would even make it to the quarter finals, it was simply a mocking of Pep saying "Twice, TWIIICE!"
Never thought i would see ronaldo wearing a united jersey in 442oons
I was the first view
The Mark goldbridge part is always funny
Salah is better
I love that Ronaldo came back
