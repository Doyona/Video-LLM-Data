is he crying? 😭
Big deal ,he beat someone with a hip replacement
That's not a grass court anymore
Outplayed.
Worst quality camera!!!!
The 20-stroke rallies are like clay. Grass is so slow nowadays. Boring
Matteo's 2nd title on Grass he won Queen's in 2021.
5:43 That slice by murray was literally perfect
Berrettini is such a pleasure to watch. He combines brutal power, in serve and forehand, with precision and insane sensitivity in volleys, dropshots and slices, together with an overall great play intelligence. I hope he fully recovers from his surgery so he can show us his full potential in this year's Wimby
go andy
I wish the winner had been Murray! But anyway all Murray is done after his surgery.. just is f4ck1n' Amazing!!!
Easy win for Murray.....oh wait
His drop shots on grass are wild!
why is the video quality so strange in this tournament
Congrats to Berrettini. Gotta give Murray some credit for still playing at this level despite the injuries and setbacks he's had over the years. It's easy to forget Berrettini is 25 years old.
BERRETTINI NUMBER ONE!!! ORGOGLIO ITALIANO!!!
There’s no way berrettini had surgery he was just practicing his backhand the whole time swear down
Whats with the shite video quality and doodoo audio?!
at 2.20 murray runs beyond the net before 2nd ball bounce, is that legal?
La velocidad es increíble
Berry!!!!!!! Brilliant......future GS champ !! Murray lost.....again...sad....but appropriate.
Murray was the real winner getting to the final.
Go!!! Berrettini love u🥰🥰😍😍🤩🤩
I used to hate murray, now i found that he is one of my favorite player, this guy has literally been n#1 and now he is fighting to climb back the ladder, congrats to berretini though,  forza italia !!

Let’s frickin go Matteo!!
https://youtu.be/LFqVKTb7luc
https://youtu.be/LFqVKTb7luc
See his last two serves at 6:53 & 7:05. He hardly jumps and stays on the line afterwards. He must have been in some pain to be hindered like that. Queens looks doubtful. Poor chap-
That was a high-level game by Andy. Certain that he could win more titles. Good game!
Murray back in the top 50!
Our thoughts on Matteo's win and the rest of the winners in the first week of grass season for those interested in a deeper discussion🍃  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLnNJjTmlkM
Hey Tennis TV, just wondering when you'd post the Top 20 Best Shots and Rallies for last month?
Big Andy fan, so I hope he can do well these next tournaments too. But also I hope Matteo can do great again this season, before his injury I was hoping he can get those results again, cheered for him at the AO, hopefully will be a nice Wimbledon for him again!
Geez... this camera quality has deterred me from watching these highlights in full haha
ANDY MURRAY ALIENTO CABRA
No sound
Matteo’s bh is smth that will cost him GS. Simple
Da hat jemand das Grass schon geraucht☹️
Pitiful
Does Murray usually use  barricades for grass season? Thought he had custom Under Armours
Well Berettini used his first serve & drop shot well, forearm shot were like rocket. But nice fight from Murray.

M
Mark my words Andy Murray will win the 2022 Wimbledon championship!!
I love to play tennis. After the game, my whole body hurts and aches, although I train in the gym! This mobile sport is good for the body
I couldn't even complete the video due to berettinis boring game, he is the next raonic in the list of slam bunkers
Why Bon Jovi?
was this livestreamed on an iphone?
let's go ! moment
How odd that Murray didn"t retire after getting thrashed in the first set ,,,, seems to be a pattern here ,,what with Murray claiming "injury" as usual and that woman player retiring every five seconds due to "injury",,,,,, thank goodness its got nothing to do with "sponsership" money ????
great match
Awful court conditions
A brawny beast with such beauty, Berrettini's aggression, resolve and big hitting assured victory, Murray too has really impressed me this week, long may he continue.
Very awesome plays Matteo. Congrats
Too good on Forehand side!
The Hammer is fierce on grass!
Would it be possible to give Andy Murray another MBE. This guy has had a hip replacement, and is STILL, playing at this level. For me he has already won the tournament. He wins every tournament that he enters into. True grit best of British. He should be elevated to royalty. Amazing guy
Berretti, sei un grande!!!!! Bravo!!!!
BOSS wins BOSS tournament
Andy's on-court body language really reminds me of Ostapenko (not a good look). But he's certainly more gracious in defeat, even though that's an incredibly low bar
is my screen bad or the video quality bad, it looks pixelated even on 1080p
Andy will no doubt be upset he couldn’t grab this title, but I personally believe he should feel amazing about the level of play and consistent fight he was able to put up all week, particularly coming from behind in the Tsitsipas match. It’s all coming together again Sir Andy!!!
Berettini's big guns proved too much, especially with the constant threat of drop shots behind
Murray is getting faster and stronger. Hopefully he will get his 2016 form back.
Andy will next take his pottie patrol back to the UK.
Congratulations
I would love to see Alcaraz vs Berrettini at Wimbledon...
After long break well done berrettini  BRAVO🇮🇹🇮🇹 congrtulations for the title 🏆🎾👏
Andy is gonna have to step it up if he wants to keep competing at the top level. Guys like Berrettini will take it to Andy every time and he’s gotta be able to raise his level if he wants to win. Well done to Matteo! 🙂
Love the nostalgic Nokia 3310 filter that has been put on this camera - outstanding!
🎾 🏆   Poor Murray … 👏🏼👏🏼😐
Just one step too far , but Andy is BACK to his very best!!......
remember me Del Potro
Both making comebacks. Good to see them battling for the title.
Imagine berretini with Novak's BH.
Thank god dry martini won Murray is annoying as fuck
I gotta start paying attention more to the height of the bounces of some of these winners. That inside-in forehand winner in the early part of the highlight? I was like, "Wait. For real?" Lol
It's also incredible to see Andy perform at this level, ..hope he wins more title in the future. Berettini delivered coming from an injury, Hope to see many more of this young man in the future  on grass, He played Wimbledon finals 2years back or so, going toe to toe with the works number 1
It's good to see both of them are looking good and hope they will put up a show in most pathetic and boring Wimbledon we will witness this year.
I'm really impressed with Andy Murray he is truly a world class tennis legend and warrior to come back from injury time and time again. He is like the Winston Churchill of tennis refusing to back down to Italians, Germans and Japanese. Long live Great Britton Long Live Europe Glory to Ukraine glory to Greek democracy and the dark enlightenment of the modern technological culture will shed light on the hypocrisy of the so-called ruling class. We need more noble elites like Murray we need more Matteo Berrentini we need Stan the Man Wawrinka's we need ROGER FEDERER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Long live the secret and not so secret king.
Murray's crunch was so disgusting.
Murray put up a heck of a fight, but Berrettini clutched out that third set like a pro.
Berrettini is the best grass court player of the Next Gen and it’s not even close. His already oppressive serve becomes downright broken on grass, and his backhand slice is more effective at setting up the forehand winner. There’s a Wimbledon title in his future.
A well earned win for Matteo and an excellent showing from Murray. Good to see him back. Great match!
3:43 COMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!
Why does Murray sound like he is in surgery without anesthesia.
Dat classic Bon Jovi track at the end, tho
As it turns out Berrentini was the BOSS!
Un chiste los partidos en "pasto", al final terminan siendo pura tierra. Por eso son los torneos más feos de ver y si no es por Wimbledon, que también es el GS menos valorado, no existirían.
Berrettini doing well on grass is very strange.
Great effort from Mr. Murray. So many people wanted to see him win it, but big congrats to Matteo. Quality win for him.
Very good tournament for Murray beating many odds. In this game initially Berretini used drops very successfully and later changed with ground strokes. Fine resistance in second set inspite so many aces from Berretini. I am happy for both coming to farm getting ready for Wimbledon 👍🏼😊 Thanks for sharing highlights.
Berrettini  know how to make old people run, just like Alcaraz making Nadal and Djokovic run to win the game
is it grass court ? i am not seeing much grass on this surface
Thank God.  Murray is back to his ultra annoying whinging now that he thinks he should be winning agian.
it's painful to see Murray lose especially after he beat Kyrgios so easily
The fact that he won it right after returning from an injury just goes to show how consistent Berrettini is, I think he's one of the most consistently good players on the ATP tour and especially in the top 10.
I hope murray will come back to top 10 before his retirement cuz he is the only player who could mess up big-3 stronghold
Sort of expected this ending because Tennis TV is awfully quite about it, and when Andy Murray plays but Tennis TV has no specific update on him, it means he lost
It’s great to see Murray back w much better confidence and rhythm in the game. He might get to quarterfinals at Wimbledon
Perfect results to BOSS, their sponsored player won their sponsored tournament
Thank god Murray lost.. he sucks
would murray ever be Top 4 again? I miss federer.
What a great viewing experience
Matteo VeryTiny calves won😎
Berrettini is back, good player🏆
old car beaten .... running out of gas like nole
holy fuck, was this recorded on a potato? genuinely looks like the early ‘90s wtf
Berrettini is a beast indeed but not on the backhand… second set Murray played him on the bh and that extended the match a bit
Murray, as Nadal, is great at containing this gen's power, speed is his weakness.
Murray es un hueso muy duro..
It’s so amazing to see Murray gaining a bit of that prowess he used to have after such a massive injury and a metal hip. Berrettini did amazing as well of course coming back after an injury himself.
Stesso sponsor Boss e che commozione grande Matteo daje
Grande Matteo ,ora Wimbledon dai devi salire in classifica daje
The forehand of Berrettini was the difference. Too huge
Always thought Murray needs to up his aggression a tad but still, love his fight.  In for a classic Wimbledon this year!
Berretini gained some weight these 3 months. Reminds me of Tsonga at some point.
Berretini should have won in straight sets, but Murray is a battler and the young players struggle with older guys who make them earn every point. Murray won’t go too far at Wimbledon. Berritini might, but Djokovic will win it.
Happy Matteo won this one, can't wait to see him at Wimbledon
Murray struggled with his service games (as always) throughout the tournament. Despite that, still impressive play from him.
2:20 is a point for Berrettini. Murray hit the passing shot but passed the net and came onto Berrettinis court side before the ball had bounced a second time and therefor before the point was officially ended. That is not allowed by the rules. Haha.
The Boss won the Boss Open - GG! :)
Normally Murray of old shines on bigger occasions provided he is fully fit. But young guns are way too demanding nowadays and already closing the gap. Novak,Murray and Berretini are in the mix for title race on grass.
Welcome back Berrettini! Big forehand Big Serve and has variety. Fun to watch!
i can’t stand those fucking grunts murray does whenever he’s running/before he hits the ball
Credit to both these 2 players despite who the winner is.  Berretini coming back from injury and Murray making it to a final.  Both great improvements. And game was excellent and of high quality
They almost turned clay into grass. How many dropshots you see nowadays.
Murray for top 10 on 2022
Have to watch this in mute because people be looking at me differently watching videos 2 men grunting and moaning
Congratulations to the winner what a cold hand shake Andy is pissed unsportmanship not cool 😑
Matteo is eyeing Wimbledon title  The Eye of the tiger  Forza Matteo
Great highlights, But why not buy a camera from this century?
Good to see Murray competing against a top 10 player again. Berettini looks strong and could be a handful for Rafa and Novak at Wimbledon
The rest did him good .......great match congrats to both....
Called it! Hammer Time!
Andy Murray's doing so well to be competeitive, kudos to him.
Forza Italia!!!🇮🇹
Cool to see them play on the court used for the battle of the surfaces from a few years ago. You know, half clay and half grass
Tennis Channel was showing PICKLEBALL instead of this!!!!
bro Murray screaming like that after winning the first game of the second set 💀💀 and all that grunting is getting kinda embarrassing at this point
Have to put it on mute. Murray is constipated.
AMAZING MATTEO 👏!!!!!
Daje Mattè 🇮🇹❤
Of course, how could BOSS man not win at the BOSS open
When Berrettini hits a forehand it stays hit 😯
Haven’t told anyone cuz I didn’t wanna give away Murray’s plan to win Wimbledon, but he is almost done perfecting a serve that can reach 346 mph.... saw it just yesterday he just needs to get his shoulder to cooperate a little and umm.... needless to say, he’s back.
Almost Andy! No worries, get better!
Impressed at berettini's success on all 3 surfaces
matteo is fucking amazing. Andy was great too, but Berrettini was ridiculous today, maybe he can win Wimbledon?
I've always heard analysis saying Berretini relies on his serve. Be interesting to see what happens when he next plays Novak/Nadal/Carlos.
Berrettini's 2022 training program :  drop shots    that's it
He had some stomach issue and was visibly in trouble in 3 set .
DAJEEEE MATTE!!!🇮🇹💙
Berrettini= Monster serve and forehand
High quality match !! Worthy of a final, very enjoyable to watch. Those drop shots and volleys from Berrettini were almost all the time at the right exact moment to execute
Gatekeeper kind of player. Inconsistent and unable to learn a half decent backhand. It's probably the worst backhand in the first 500
I don't get the surprise, if any. Everyone always forgets that Berrettini has been in the ATP Finals for several consecutive years. Wimbledon Finalist etc etc. For some reason, people worldwide don't realize or remember his level.
Well done to both players! Congratulations to Berrettini but many congrats to Andy too as he is showing once again some great great stuff. I hope the physical issue isn't hip related, and if I were him I'd pass playing at Queen's to preserve himself for Wimbledon, which is to the best of 5 sets. He has proven to everyone during this week that he might well be a dark horse... As for Berrettini, he was hitting very well indeed, and winning a tournament straightaway coming back from injury is impressive enough, and will no doubt be a serious force to reckon with at Wimbledon... Exciting weeks ahead😎
Berrettini is hammer and slice, heart and brain!
Noticed that players are doing more dropshots lately. Just like the lob, it’s been an under appreciated shot.  Alcaraz made them cool, maybe?
I think he could win Wimbledon this year.
I miss 8 minute highlights. The Grand Slams should take some notes
this murray is moaning , and moving like a 70 year old grandpa.....
Grass tennis is boring these days...
Really, I think the tennis world should set up rules for screaming during the games. Murray and also Nadal are true screamers, which can only annoy the opponent´s concentration.
Did Berrettini say "I'm sorry" to Murray as he was about to shake hands? What a gentleman :)
I have to unsubscribe because every thumbnail is a spoiler
Berrettini looks like the twin brother of Britney Spears' husband.
Murray was not happy when his opponent win
Good game! They didn't show the 2 treatment breaks of Murray in the 3rd set.
Murray got a good dose of inspirational juice this week
Nice one Matteo, coming back and immediately winning! He was by far the best grass court player in the draw, but not having played a match in 3 months I expected him to lose early. This is what the top guys are meant to do, clean up in lower level tournaments where they are expected to win (take notes Daniil, Zverev, Stefanos etc.).  Murray did well to make the final too. Even if it is a bit sad to see him as a fraction of his former self, his former self might not be necessary to win big matches and make deep runs anymore given the weak crop of younger players, particularly on grass where they all suck doubly as hard.
Was hoping Murray could win, but Berretini was just too much.  Still quality tennis from Murray.
I have long believed Murray was overrated, especially years ago when he was compared to the Big Three. He is, at most, in the ranks with Lleyton Hewitt.
These highlights don't do the match justice - just makes it look like Berrintini was blasting winners. Match was MUCH clloser that you'd think.
Good run from Murray, age 35. He is a week older than Djokovic, and playing with a bionic hip. Berrettini is back and Wimbledon is only 2 weeks off Hopefully the meet again there in a 5 set buster
I like Andy but I HATE his boisterous screams and grunts, they last even until Matteo or any of Andy's opponents are about to return the ball. So, I am so glad Matteo won. Coco Gauff is right when she complained about Martina Trevisan and her long lasting screams reaching even when she, Coco, was returning the balls. The WTA and ATP and all tournaments need to do something about it before the tournaments become a 'Whatever It Is That You Wish To Do You Can Circus.'
Am loving that Murray lost. I can't stand his ugly mug and those pathetic sex noises on the court
Buen partido, grande Murray 💪 a pesar de la derrota, siempre será un grande del tenis!
After this,  I'd won't to see Berrettini fh vs Kyrgios fh.
Murray went far!
This is not a grass court anymore.
Always a good day when Murray loses. Can't stand him.
Sore loser Mister Murray
2€'s of tickets sale for Ukrnaccis,yes no?
Berrettini has hired Boris Becker as coach for Wimbledon.
Murray got overpowered big time
Echoes of Delpo in that Berrettini forehand - hits like an absolute truck. His grass game is incredible and he has a great shout for Wimby this year.
Berrettini is the only player that can pull off not having a major part of the game (an actual backhand) and still have a lot of success
Don't really care about the shouting and grunting of today...
Worst video editing job ever. You get to see players faces maybe twice the entire 8:30 mins.
Murray what à come back . Absolutely amazing. Congrats Berrettini.
🇮🇹🏆🎾👏🏼Matteo 🏁🏴‍☠️
The battle between the old man 👴 and the Italian hunk (murray posture and walk is reminiscent of that of an old man yet he made it to the final).
Not clear on the highlights but Murray suffered in final set with hip injury. Hope not too serious and will be fit for wimbledon. He had a great run in this tournament. Hats off the Berretini...played really well throughout. Also a word on the court...hard, fast and true (as you can get on grass)..well done
Andy never wins anything. I got a tip for him to get better.  Stop playing for 2 weeks then QUIT
I respect Murray for his abilities as a tennis player and his fighting spirit, but oh boy he is such an obnoxious brat on court.
I'm just impressed Andy is playing with a metal hip
what a brilliant slice from murray to win the 2nd set ,improved level  on grass , but his stamina is a huge problem
What is with Murray’s grunting before the ball even gets to him
Who's doing the color grade editing on these videos? Surely someone could have done better. This could easily pass for a match from the 1980s.
Berretini is a heck of player I'll say that. Lets go!!
I used to hate Murray , but I wanted him to win a title so much. What a legend
Andy Murray <3
Berrettini might have a big forehand, but I'll be dammed if it isn't ugly 🤢.
Matteo played well but he needs to work on his movement. He is quite slow and stiff
Happy for you Matteo 👏🏽👍🏽🥳
Berretini's backhand is terrible for a 10 top quality player
Admirable effort from Andy Murray. Every the grinder. One habit I absolutely cannot stand is his penchant for grunting while running down a ball. Hasn't even made contact but that sound... I now hear juniors following suite.
Andy is looking pretty good!! Congratulations Berrettini!!
Bravo Matteo! Complimenti!👏
Welcome Back Matteo!   Great start getting back on the court!   And Andy, always gives his all!  Hope whatever bothered him during the match doesn't linger for the grass season.
The crowd wanted the win for Sir Andy, but Matteo was the fitter player. It was unbelievable to see them in real life, playing such a great tennis. Many thanks for this game. 😍
Grazie Berrettini, and I'm happy is playing against Andy in final!
He’s a big Roman that lad
Murray always the same...so arrogant, can't stand him! WELL DONE MATTEO!! WHAT A COME BACK!!!! SO DESERVED!!!
That forehand was on fire.
No pain no gain. Come on Matteo
What these guys Roger, Novak, Rafael, Andy doing at this age is awe-spiring and that's something to learn from 'em. ❤
I just wanna see Alcaraaaaz!!! 😊😊. Counted w/ my 10 fingers or less the rest is boring tennis and limited forehands. Included Murray's grinding and Berretini's  elbow that looks like grew in his trunk instead of his shoulder.
Andy will be pleased with his level of play. It''s still going up.  No losers here really.
World cup in Italy 1990 had a better camera.
Why does Andy Murray sound like a demented Donkey everytime he hits the ball. Sounds knackard even 10yrs ago. Maybe wee Nicola could give him a Donkey tonic to pep up his naying naooooooooourh urh sounds. The White Peacock speaks.
The ATP so needs a new grass court specialist. Hopefully Shapovalov can follow suit.
👍 👏👏 Well done Murray, like Rafa your not interested in proving your the GREATEST, just playing the game you love to play, and again like Rafa through past injuries and I'm certain in some pain, if not during the match then I'm sure after.. So hats off to you and your fighting spirit.
Matteo Berrettini is a paisan who understands an Italian rooster. However I have nothing but admiration for Andy Murray. He is competing with a reconstructed hip - he is a true Warrior Scot.
Daje Matteo con Roma nel cuore
Grande Matteo🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDSiAtXOMZix4wnb_HovYfg analysis of this match up on my channel, would appreciate you checking it out! :) Like and subscribe!
3:28 forehand 😯
I would love to see Berrettini or Murray win Wimbledon
Murray, nadal and all the pushers should be banned. They are boring.
Berrettini should do well at Wimbledon again
Мюррей Красавец!
👏👏👏 For Andy Murray. Great Tournament
Berrettini has to be one of the best players on grass of the past few years. Great to see him come back so quickly from the injury hiatus. Good week from Andy as well, hoping they can both carry momentum into Wimbledon
damn it really should’ve been Murray or Kyrgios… congrats to Berrettini though
man berretini sucks. Wish murray could've won after working so hard to come back from his injuries
Great week for Andy, arguably his best of the recovery. Keep building goat
Stuttgart has got to get some better cameras lol. Congrats Mateo.
I am very glad to see Murray lost. He has a big mouth and too loud with grinding and pushing play style.👏👏👏
So happy for Matteo after going through with his wrist injury and now won in Stuttgart. I can see him go deep again this year in Wimbledon.   Credit to Murray for taking a set against the best grass court player from the younger generation at the moment. Don't forget he's playing with a metal hip
I wish Andy wasn’t so loud… I get grunting for force or as a breathing routine… but running to a drop shot?
Two big champions clap clap clap clap...
we love you Andy, you are tireless
In roland garros every year nadal will be the champion upto his retirement age of around 45 yesrs
Berrettini has definitely not been slacking off when recovering. He seems to be very confident in his strokes again, and actually improved his volley game a lot. While he may not be a favorite on grass he definitely has potential for hard season
Frim next yearc, there will be a new champion every year in Austrslian open
Veri happi beretteni won. Murray veri annoying making too much unnecessary noises everytime he is hitting the ball time to put the racket down murray and congrats on your retirement
From this year there will be a new champion every year in usopen
My only complain is that i can barely see the BOSS sign in the back... I think it is way too small !
From this year , there will be a  new champion every year in wimbledon
Crazy how much more worn the close side of the court is!
Murray just didn't play dropshots, it's a good weapon against Berrettini.
Sad for sir andy, he has a good tournament 😢
I bet on Barrettini this Championship .
I’m sure Andy is still busy with P. T. and getting back into match condition. He was surely fired up, perhaps too much. Glad for Berrettini to hold his own nerve and resolve. Have to add Berrettini to the list of players I think can reach the final of Wimbledon. Who do you think can reach the final?
Oh no! another injury for Andy, hope it's only a passing thing and he wakes up tomorrow fine and ready to play Queens. His game is coming on really good. Fair play to the big B too, just out of rehab and back winning again. Warriors both.
too easy murray trash
Murray knows things on grass. Final and 3 sets with half of his old forehand is astonishing
Espero que Novak este mucho mejor que nunca con la devolución y el servicio,  porque tanto Berrettini como Hurkacz o Felix A.A , son muy buenos aquí y aún serán mejores que antes.
did Murray scream that much 10 years ago?
Wtf with the moans of Murray while playing. It’s getting so insufferable
Im very happy to looking Mateo winning again since Miami. He deserve it. And well done to Murray, he is a heroe arriving at the final in Stuttgart.
Im very happy to looking Mateo winning again since Miami. He deserve it. And well done to Murray, he is a heroe arriving at the final in Stuttgart.
Not easy!
Murray did not use to be my top favorite, but hat down for his resurgence.
Murray Is so unpleasant
amazes me how some "average" player like Berettini (ok top 10 but still) manage to come back to win title straight after a long break, whereas it takes Thiem so long or even Djokovic to find their old form back
Not a bad effort from Murray to be fair.  Berretini is a beast on grass.
Keep the heat up. Andy! 💪🏼💪🏼
Bravo Matteo!!!!!!!!!!!! Fenomenale!
What is this horrible video quality
A la fin plutôt que de monter berrettini le cameraman montre la public. On s’en fou on préfère voir la réaction de berrettini…. Trop con
And somebody was saying “berrettini is done”... good answer Matteo , keep up the great job !
He is finally back. C'mon Matteo let's win Wimbledon🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Congratulations to Matteo played some great tennis and let's hope you got more in the tank for Wimbledon. Andy what a legend, brilliant tennis and can't wait to see you play Wimbledon 🙂🎾❤️🇮🇹
Has Murray always grunted like a WTA player a full 2 seconds after he hits the ball?
I wonder why people didn’t speak out when Australia was playing politics when they stopped the defending champion from play
Berretini is the second best grass court player on tour right now, and Murray gave him a run for his money. Great comeback for Matteo, and great effort from Murray.
Good showing for Andy. He beat quality opponents. Depending on his draw he might be able to make some noise at Wimbledon.
BH still looks ass. IDK how he wins lol. My gf loves him tho.
Berrettini just nailed Murray with his shot from the forehand. Berrettini's forehand is a cannon!
so happy he beat Murray
Murray is too old, time to hang up the racquet.  No more wins for him, just like Novax.
The Italian Hammer is back!!! 💪👏🔥
Murray hit a lot of balls to Berretini's backhand. It had mixed results but Berretini's forehand is stronger, and his serve is also very strong. So were his drop shots. Murray gave it a good effort.
I'm surprised the old man went 3 sets. The WC king will never win a tournament.  Time for him to enter qualifying matches.
8:05 - the winner is showing some emotion and reaction that we want to see, the camera suddenly cuts to some random shots of the crowd applauding. WHY?
14 Masters 1000 2 Olympic Gold Medals 3 Grand Slam titles ( And 9 finals😮) 1 Atp Finals   And he still comes for more, good luck Murray, Youre amazing, im sure this season you gonna win at least one title, you deserve it.
Didn't show the trophy☹️ Nice final, 2 beasts. Though it looks more like a dirt court than a grass court.
Murray is a mama's boy. Being defeated is a good chance for him to become a big boy...
Matteo is nicknamed "The Hammer"; and after seeing his serves, and especially his forehand, it shows. Wow. Andy did really well to stay with him as long as he did. Like trying to hang on to a raging animal.
Maybe next year the Stuttgart people can upgrade from their 1990s CCTV camera they use
Such a good defence for Berre that slice backhand, not only on grass. Greetings from Rome Italy
excellent pratice 4 Andy, even though lost!
This is how a highlight should be, especially for a final.  The important points are shown.. Break points, set points, match points, nice one.  Roland Garros and other Grand Slam channels need to learn
Berrettini will win Wimbledon in the future along FAA both play really good on grass, he made already the final, once Djokovic is out he will have an open path
Maybe it's a camera angle thing, but the serve Berrettini hit at 2:29 looked absolutely massive.  Edit: Oh, and Murray with the loud "Come on" after an unforced error from Berrettini. That's classy.
It’s a miracle murray is playing finals with a metal hip….
Bad court on screen
half grass, half clay
It’s like I have sand in my eyes when I watch this event  Edit: however the actual match was really good from both players. Really entertaining matchup . good to see Berretini at his best again
Berrettini is very very good. Murray played very well and made it a tight fight. Be good to see them play each other again: Both will improve by playing each other.
Berrettini's weak slice on clay become strong on grass.
Sir Andrew  Barron Murray Heart of A Lion.. Matteo I hope Will become 2022 Wimbledon Champion.. Bravo - Bravo..
Murray, back to zero
Come on, Andy. You still got it. Keep the fight going, you will succeed!!!
Congrats matteo. And to andy too. So impressed by him lately
What a beast Berrettini is, almost 3 months out and wins straight away a title, he also got a good draw at Queen's ( facing Murray again possibly) he can really go far this year in Wimbledon lot of players out and he is an all court player and one the few who can actually play on grass
Matteo went through so much, first thing he said to Sir Andy at the net was "I'm sorry." Just a good guy and a great champion. Such a shame Wimbledon decided to play politics and degrade itself as a tournament, Matteo has an excellent chance to win.
Yes berrettini, smashed it, Murray needs to stop screaming 😱 😂
Andy showed up big time. Impressive.
Murray looking very good going into Wimbledon!
Great to see Muzza back at this level👏🏼however I have to say his grunting right now has got to be up the with the worst on tour😂
Ol' murray is back? 💪
Omg we didn't get to see it but it looked like Matteo started to cry at the end after the match
Bruh berretini’s backhand side isn’t even that bad. That slice is amazing. And here and there he’ll suprised u with a good topspin backhand too anyway
With that serve and that forehand, Berrettini is definitely a force to reckon with. This 2 will probably meet in Queens Round2 again.
Where's Ryo Shusuke when the world wants to see him! HAHAHA!!!!
Hope hip is ok and he can still play Queen's and Wimbledon. Well done to Berrettini, he is one of the top contenders at Wimbledon.
Great fair play from Berrettini, in letting Murray have a second medical break (not allowed by policy)
Great player's both played Amazing
Dobry mecz
hip boi couldnt handle it
Super fighter Matteo
The ground looks 50% grass and 50% sand.
Vincere dove ce la.casa del tuo.sponsor non e' da tutti. Grandissimo anche perche.murray era tosto oggi. Il dritto spacca...
Was Murray’s mommy in stands crying, with her large alienesque head?
Murray can make a deep run at Wimby but he can't keep playing the same game style he did 10 years ago, he's going to run out of gas
Imagine if Matteo had a proper backhand. Jeez would be deadly
Great to see them both! The Hammer hasn't played in 3 months and The Good Sir playing with a steel hip. Hope they go deep in the Big W.
Berrettini is among the new Big 4. Medvedev, Zverev and Tsitsipas.
After Djokovic,Beretini second best on grass.
I think berettini will do quite well on grass this year especially wimbledon...let's see💪🏻
Berrrettini's win was written on his outfit...boss
Tennis on grass is stupid, one to two shots, aces... No tactics no thinking. For me the grass season doesn't exist.
Adore Matteo 🦋🌞❤️🏆🔥🔥
Wanted Andy🥳 to win, he did great, ready for Wimbledon,lets go Andy 💚
Great highlights!  Power tennis and Andy looks pretty healthy though spending so much energy grunting!
Although Murray is improving a lot, but I don't like his excessive grunting
Schade Murray
Welcome back
imagine if the shot at 4:53 was legal. It looks like it landed on Murray's side of the court after bouncing off the signage/railing
C'è solo un MATTEO nazionale. E gioca a tennis. Super.
Grunt fest. Nah I’ll pass
I love that Murray made it to the final and challenged him to 3 sets. A winner in my eyes.
It's noticeable how much more backhand slice Berrettini is using in his grass games
Looking good Murray, he has found some more rhythm. Great effort considering he is playing with a hip replacement. We can expect a decent run at Wimbledon.
So what is Berittini without that 1-2 punch .. like big first server and a following hitting forehand.. ?
Didn't know they still use potatoes to record matches
I want to Andy win. I was surprise about Berretini level  after his injury. A very competitive match
not a beretini fan here . espageti legs .
I think it goes under the radar how often Berretini has had to comeback from injuries. And comeback successfully at that!
*SPOILER*       Comes back from injury and immediately wins a tournament. And people have low expectations for Matteo!
I hope Murray retires after Wimbledon. He needs to stop tarnishing his legacy
Berrettini did something special. He immediately won a tournament after not playing for 3 months due to an injury with wrist surgery 😯  this is impressive, something only real champions can do. Congratulations!
Murray put up such a great fight! Always love to see him playing so well❤️
Ia that a Vintage Camera ???
Great performance Matteo! 🇮🇹🔨🎾🏆
was hoping Andy would take this one. Matteo is so good on this surface.
Berretini on grass is top 5 in the world easy
Lets not forget Berrettini is a consistent top 10 player, that if it wasnt for the injuries, probably would be on the top 5. This year he defeated Carlos Alcaraz and has been in GS and Master 1000 finals. This is a very good result for Andy Murray.
Don't know how much longer Murray can keep going with his hip. If he wants to continue his career, he needs to leave these small tourneys alone, and hope he can continue getting WC into the Slams and the bigger Master tourneys. Now he's in danger of missing Wimby, which is his best surface, and probably could of made a nice little run with the rankings all out of wack and a number of high caliber guys missing.
Glad to see Berrettini back Great tournament nevertheless for Murray Enjoy with friends and family 👍🙏☺️
After Murray’s win over Tsitsipas and k gyros, I was expecting him to take the title even though he was facing Berrettini. I’m still really impressed how far Murray got he’s still got it!
هاردلك اندي موراي مبروك ماتيو بيريتيني
