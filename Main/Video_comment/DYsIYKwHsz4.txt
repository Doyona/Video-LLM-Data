we need to raise boys to be men of god, men of good, men of compassion
He wasn’t homeless
He accomplished nothing good.I remember when this case happened. He ruined his life and other's lives. At the end of the day the victim is dead and he has "life."At 25,26 his life is flushed down the drain for his sociopathic behavior..
I dated will. He has a heavy Cuban accent. And he been to my house. He use to always take us to his residents house that he already sold. He brought his gun inside my house one time and I asked him to leave it in the car & he told me let’s go to his house in Miami instead. I am from broward. He was really sweet but never took no for a awnser he definitely knew how to get his way. But never did I see him being a murderer he never once was mean to me.
Why would they mention there living situation lol
How’s he a serial killer if he only killed one person? Isn’t it supposed to be 3-4 murders before you’re considered a serial killer or do they think his behavior was escalating because he picked a homeless person twice and it went from gun to knife?
You could say he went, "above and beyond" the usually psychopathic salesperson. . . He must have been obsessed with making sales figures indifferent to the life that inhabited the area.
Handsome man crazy as Hell. American psycho. He sees himself the hero by getting rid of those he sees as worthless. The worst part of about all of this he did what law enforcement officers think about.
Capital Punishment for Capital Murder Send this Demon back too his Maker Satan No one needs Trash like this in there Community God Bless the Police they are the Real Superheroes Getting these Zeroes off the Streets
He's giving a terrible name to the art of serial killing. My condolences to the victims and their loved ones.
Why would y'all know his name on video, but not in the name of the video?  Someone didn't want people to know he is latino huh? And you call yourself professionals?  smh
All his good looks didn't blind the cops..bury his arse
Man.....if we only knew what goes on in the mind of some people.
Major looks good🥰🤣
From realtor to serial killer…karma got him!
You never know who is sneaking across the border.
A real state agent killing the homeless, kind of ironic.
*Wait a minute, which Suarez we're talking about?*
I went with willy to high-school, i am shocked by this news, willy was friends with everybody in high school, he was the guy how youd looked up too, he was very charismatic and a really nice guy, very healthy staying in shape and consentreted on his studys. So I'm shocked to hear this, he was the last person i expected to do something like this ,i think he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
Damn....would never suspect someone of such madness, evil comes in a shape and forms.
What is this modeling portfolio they're playing. Wtf?!
Not sure why everyone finds it necessary to even mention looks in this situation.
He'll have a new asshole in jail
Wow he’s a sick human. Poor homeless humans 🥲🥲🥲
Leviticus 24:17 Anyone who takes the life of a human being is to be put to death . Willy Suarez Maceo 🇨🇺🇺🇸 An Professional Real Estate Agent killing Homeless Men for no reason. That's Cold Blooded Murders in Miami. I'm so devastated & 💔 @ The same time I hope Willy Suarez Maceo is sorry for what he did I hope & pray He asked God to forgive him I hope Willy will have a better relationship with God while He's in jail one day I pray this doesn't happened no more. Enough is enough drop the guns, put the guns down. We don't want no one Else life to be taken. Willy should be ashamed of himself killing the homeless is chaos They don't deserve this
That means they should keep homeless people out of streets to protect them
Some people are bothered by the fact that so many images are shown of the suspect. I'm not, simply because I understand why they are doing it. They want to drive home to people that you cannot put your trust in anyone based on their looks, social status, occupation, or anything else. Though his alleged victims all seem to be homeless men, I would imagine that there were many women interested in getting to know him as well as some gay men. None of whom were homeless and perhaps they would have never become his victims. But still, who wants someone like this in their life, in any capacity, who is capable of such atrocities? I approve of overexposing him, because too many people out there still live their lives judging books by their covers. Think of all the victims and onlookers Ted Bundy fooled with his good looks, charm, and intelligence. It needs to sink into everyone that someone who is attractive, a sharp-dresser, and a successful entrepreneur does not necessarily equate to being an all-around nice guy or gal, for that matter.
This is some dexter type shit wtf...
This is some dexter  type of  shit
a least someone's doing something about this homeless problem.
This is unbelievable! How can someone even fathom this in their heart? Does anyone else agree??
That pic at  :56 screams gay narcissist all day. Woman. If a man takes selfies of himself stay away. Dude is not good looking. Has weirdo written alll over his face.
He so fine 😍....why??? He needs to be locked up he's a killer!!! It's sad....a life is a Life.....God gives life we have no right (he) to take it away.... Just 25.... Wow.. he may get 50 years or life... People have demons that they never got delivered from......right now his family will be shocked...
The man looks like James st Patrick
He is Cuban and identifies as white
Omg he’s gorgeous!!! 🤤😍
Suspect...in more ways than one. LOL 😂😂😂🤩
Life time behind bars.
They gone bust your cheeks wide open in prison Mr.Sweet Meat
By his appearance he was easily and quick to appear harmless,and trustworthy!
Notice that he only killed homeless people.He killed them because just like prostitutes,he didn't think anyone would give a dam about either one being killed.And lastly by him being a real estate agent,and being paid very well,and just 25 years old...he is so arrogant,and cold and calculating to where he never ever thought that all of the arrows would point towards him.He never ever thought that he would get caught.Ever heard the old saying that goes"there so smart to where their stupid"?My grandfather use to always say"if slick don't get you today,it'll definitely get you tomorrow.The biggest trick that the devil tried to play on the people in the  world is trying to convince the people in the world that he didn't exist.
This is one of those High Value men 😖
Pretty boy will fit right in prison, inmates will butter up his buns and i guarantee u he will be lookin ugly in the face..
The dead eyes always give it away for me. Bundy had those same dead eyes.
The scary part is that he looks soooo normal
Serial killer ???  Maaan!  Serial killer have not made a comeback for a long time       , donyou guys remember checking golden age of Serial killers 70s 80s ,
That’s crazy that’s my high school that means when I was in school he was just starting wow rest in peace to those poor people I hope he never gets out
*America's Next Top Prison Bae*
I'm still waiting on the evidence 🙄 😒 😏 😴 😕 🙃....what is this guy story....I got to know from is own words...the news people use to be able to get interviews 🤔 🙄 😑 sad reporters
To boost his business. He wanted to increase the value of property by removing the homeless. - A Psychopathic trait.
joel needs to go easy on the botox
😎He is Handsome...
Dexter, we needed you
Hold on- so is he a serial killer or a spree killer /shooter?
I thought a serial killer was considered someone that killed and took a break in between.
Very little mention if who the victims are and were. Not one photo or name. He must have hired a damn good and expensive attorney to get this kind of coverage. Already the potential jury pool is tainted. A gorgeous and successful, alleged killer, and two nameless, faceless, and homeless victims. I hope it's his attorneys are behind the coverage otherwise, I don't know why news media and cops are so thirsty for this dude. That press conference came off like, " Y'all, we know he is distractingly hot and incredibly successful but we gotta stay focused. I know this is hard for many to accept but...beautiful people commit crimes too!!"
Death penalty?
I know him, is from the Dominic Republic bad apples.
Psychopath
Lmao “not a great way to finish up the year.” You couldn’t have said it better news guy
Smh, the killer is nice looking,  could charm anyone,  but he is sick in the head, ppl please be careful out there, and try not to go anywhere alone
Haven't seen any coverage of this on CNN...weird.
Killing two people makes someone a serial killer? Or is that just a better story headline?
He was tortured with his past. Because he was doing great in life.
Don't put willy away in prison, he is a mostly peaceful blatino murderer, what a shame to put him in prison.
I predict pain for willy in prison, butt pain.
They really showing his photos like he something special. He SHOT AND KILLED TWO HOMELESS PEOPLE smh
I would toss his 🥗
https://youtu.be/yOs5td01bGo
Lock the monster up and throw away the key . He will be a good runway model inside trust me …
now like any other attractive guy going to jail, we are going to wait when a wave of thirsty women demand his release because homeless are not people
I was so distracted by the question of "Why so many of his I'm a narcissist pics?" that I had to replay it to catch that they are charging him with murder on top of his trespassing arrest.  Hopefully, they caught him quickly, and there aren't more dead out there that no one knows about. My heart goes out to his victims and their families who were going through more than enough hardship already.
Reporter: "Police say these murders happened within two hours of one another. The first of the two murders, the victim survived"  Me: What???  Jokes aside, glad they caught this psycho. RIP to the deceased victims and hopefully the survivor recovers 🙏🏾
So, you just go around kill homeless people out of your car?!! WTF is wrong with this freakin' world?!!! 😡😠🤬
The irony, being a real estate agent and killing those without homes.
I am proud of you guys! We have a lot of them to find
Homeless don't even pay taxes freak them
Smh
I think its a set up
Once again did they get any hard evidence video? A statement  a gun maybe? Like qhat is actually  connecting this guy
Yes I know not to judge a book by it’s cover but wtf I definitely wouldn’t have suspected him
The dude is beautiful so of course they had to do a photo montage lol
What are the odds he runs into some of those people's family either way he going to be some bad man girlfriend look at him.
Hes not a serial killer! Stoy lying.
Never judge a book by it's cover the police should know and the whole damn justice system
hope all the girls drooling over this man meet the same fate as his victims
I bet he a Sagittarius
Watch some crazy azz woman gone be tryna marry him from prison 😄!
All these criminals have a certain look in their eyes really empty seemingly
This is sounding more like a spree killer.
He looks like he would be an R&B singer from 2006 😂
lol the Bay Harbor Butcher!
Unfortunately due to movies it has caused us to believe that all murderers look like Freddy or Jason but in reality it’s the exact opposite. Real serial killers are usually quite handsome or beautiful hence the reason they have access to even the most cautious person. We associate safety with good looks like Ted Bundy who was great friends with a amazing detective that later  became a true crime writer Ann Rule so it shows how much our perception of humanity is based off of looks. Prayers to everyone involved. May he be punished to the maximum penalty that our laws allow then get prison justice for the families. Sorry not sorry!!
Never judge people base on appearances alone.
I bet he is well like by a lot of people.
A psychopath trying to gentrify a neighbourhood for work? Yikes. I cannot think of a motive. Those poor people.
Ok I might've understood if he was taking out mfs on the sex offender registry but not homeless people who aren't bothering anyone. Dude's a whole nutball.
What evidence pointed to him though? How did they know it was him?
The devil 😈 had also a good look
I took a literature class in college, but it should have been called social issues. The professor was bent on pointing out how vain and privileged we were. Every topic was on third world poverty, the modern day class system in America, or the value of a dollar verses human life.   Anyways, one of the topics was on the homeless in NY. He played a video of a guy who was bringing awareness to homeless people’s murders. It was scary and sad. We don’t hear about it often because ppl like to assume they weren’t worth living. They don’t have a job so they don’t pay taxes that contribute to the economy, blah blah blah. They have no family, so no one will look for them. These  ppl would be dead and I’m guessing the government would cremate them and you never see or hear from them again. It’s like they never existed.
He is going to be someone's cupcake once he goes to the big house..
*He's ONLY as sick as his secrets...*
This all sounds like some bull...
His prison inmates will be all over him 🤣!!
1st of all he is innocent until proven guilty. But its something about his eyes tho..
He was cleaning up our city. He's a hero. We will help you brother!!!!!!
Most criminals get one photo, but this one was allowed his portfolio
Remember Ted Bundy, who by the way was in law school
They gone love his photogenic a** in the pen  , imagine him walking in and the men start beating the window 🤣🙈
The police are like ‘Okay he’s hot…but he’s a criminal !’
This is literally the movie American psycho
25 where lol wait why are they sharing puctures as if he's a model
💪🏻😈Free Willy 🐋 GANG 🐳
Lol at the pictures
‘Serial killer’ is a bit of stretch. Just murder for him
The homeless and prostitutes are often targeted for violent crime. Obviously, it would be better if this never happened. But the next best thing, at least bring these criminals to justice. Thanks to the police for investigating this thoroughly.
I know it’s showing how he doesn’t look like a he could be a serial killer but I feel like I felt like I was looking at a modeling application😩
Is there proof that he did this???
The Rich vs The Homeless  That's The Only Motive I Can Think of....  100% EVIL
Hmmm.  Fishy, what is the motive?
The first time  someone with a Lamborghini, killing a homeless person 🤔🤔
Typical Democrat
Dude...this dudes eyes have nothing in them. Like no soul.
He is mentally struggling with the fact that he is well....yall already.I truly believe he went to  get those men on purpose,its not random.
he could HAVE been a model ~ he could HAVE been an influencer ~ HE LOOKS LIKE A DECENT YOUNG MAN ~ HOW THE F*CK DOES THIS HAPPEN ANY OF US ? this child could be my grandson ~
From Rolling stone mag praising a terrorist to male models being glorified for looks. Lesson looks wont get you out of trouble like money does but it doesnt hurt apparently!
Leave it to Florida. Go figure.
This looks suspicious! I don't know about this. What's the motive here?
The fact his looks are highlighted SO much... This is American news right here.
I read the comments about the news showing way too many photos of this guy... Those comments are accurate. Too accurate.
Captain crunch
😈 demon s among us.  Stay prayed up Florida
Was this guy on METH
Maybe this guy was on the street too?Maybe he knows the victims 🤔
He has dark eyes may God have mercy on his soul
Chile, this man literally had looks that killed. So why does he kill homeless people? A demon 😈 in a beautiful disguise.
Watch out for the groupies
Where is the evidence ???
Roll the modeling photos. Smh.
So he Loves killing HOMELESS people.... Reminds of the Guy in New York who killed homeless in the night with a Hammer while they are sleep........ Weird things.....I wonder what they did to him these homeless people?
He is so cute 😍
This guy is nutts but why was he attacking the homeless people??
I dont remember what this story is about...I do remember his face though
I guess they trying to get the point across he look like a normal business guy, that's approachable and your date!
real estate and bitcoin are sleezy
0:56, dude is dressed like a cuban militant from the 80's
This sounds like bullshit I do not trust Miami Dade sounds like PD need a suspect to close the case before end year.
This guy has a pure black heart and has no empathy for human life. He enjoys hurting others, and thank goodness, he has  been caught. The most frightening killer is the one that blends in like a chameleon and adapts him or herself to suit their environment, presenting an avatar of themselves the public.  When really they're nothing more than just a demon walking amongst us. Thank goodness his off the streets 🙌
This man takes a picture of himself every ten seconds wtf.
Tf was wrong with him
You can ALWAYS tell a person is off by their eyes & he looks creepy (to me).
It’s always those you least suspect. Looks are truly deceiving. My heart goes out to those victims.
Everyone has to see that movie American Psycho with actor Christian Bale this guy was probably inspired by that movie. There are people with loose screws everywhere it doesn’t matter what you look like! Never judge a book by its cover!🙏😊
He Will look great in Orange! Maldito enfermo!!!
Where’s the proof!!!!!
Homeless people are people too. this is beyond sick. my heart is with all the victims
Is this a glamour shoot or reporting of scumbag killer?
Ted Bundy was considered good looking, just saying.
BRING back public HANGINGS!
Thanks, I needed to see his entire portfolio. Y'all got him, why not just post his mugshot?
This story is not making any sense
I'm not sure why he would give a damn about homeless people when he was living his best life and then some. I need the whole story it sounds like a setup to me.
I think we have a good idea on what he looks like lol
PSYCHO-PASS
So he kills 1& injures another … he’s a serial killer for that ?
I certainly wouldn’t trust this man, he looks TOOOO smooth. Too manicured, there’s nothing real about him! It’s all fake. I’ll bet his personality was the same.  Someone like that - they can be hiding something, and you would never know they are so good at hiding the things they think you would disapprove of.
Reminds me of American psycho the second one ...
Gosh! He looks more like a homosexual catalogue model than a serial killer 👀
I just want to know what his motive was
He’s not even attractive
They’re showing pictures of this guy posing next to expensive cars and holding a glass of wine.WTF Just post his mug shot.
TNB from the 💩stains on the underwear of Humanity.
weird as hell putting his whole azz modeling portfolio in there
Man this is one thirsty coverage. We get it, the monster is good looking enough to take home to our parents for easter but why all the photos?
Wow!! They really went through his Facebook and Instagram.
This POS better not get out on bail. He believes he's better than other's and didn't want the homeless trashing up the area's he was selling home's in and decided he was going to get rid of them. I am dumbfounded as to why the LE & media are giving this POS murderer any more air time and commenting on his appearance as most serial killers have been well known in history to be better than average looking and have charisma and why they got away with it.
Handsome, well dressed, sportscar, successful career this guy projected everything that means you're doing well, but  in reality he is a demon in disguise. Life can be so frightening
There is a movie called American Physco. In the movie If I'm not mistaken the guy Is a stock broker and he is a serial killer. There is even a scene where he kills a homeless guy with a knife.
Dude sick!!!!  Was he killing them for the agency OMG 😳
They gave him too much publicity. That was a photo shoot. As I was looking through the pictures I forgot what he did. Condolences to the families.
How did he start off saying these murders and the very next thing he said was the victim survived
You mean not Black it’s harder to explain
Yes indeed, women will be lined up around the block, trying to be in the court room for his trial. It those bad boys that get the girls.
they went through this killer's whole instagram 🤦‍♂️
After Ted Bundy, nothing’s a shock factor to me.
Ladies be careful out there...dont let the looks deceive you
What a pos
How many women out there regretting they banged this guy?
Wtf is up with all the selfies
Good for him 👍
The saddest part is that we even have to mention "we can't go after someone based off looks".…goes to show you how vain this world really is.
I’m assuming he is bipolar
Willy Maceo eyes look empty.
American psycho.
...and of course the 15 year old girls will be like...oh he's so cute , he can't be guilty of killing someone.
idk why people are like "never judge a book by it's cover", dudes like this a lot of the time are narcissistic sociopaths. Not really surprising imo
Yeah he definitely looks suspect if you know what I mean... 🌈🤔🧐
I have a feeling that this was retaliation for something.
Americas arm put florida
He's a demon
He's like a black Patrick Bateman.
He’s hot. I don’t disregard the victims though.
That was a ridiculous amount of pictures😑🥺🤔
Where’s the evidence?
It's the slide show for me😐 no yeah this world is truly coming to an end.
I call bull shit!! He’s a black man let’s just face the fact it is the way he looks this is bullshit bro holiday type of cases to get in 2016 to these two people like him sense to me I’m sorry I know he black Hilty that’s what you all think fuck all y’all motherfuckers like that’s what I think!! Period!! It is racist ass country when you’re black you’re guilty automatically we all know it we all know it come on now
He has some of the most soulless eyes I have ever seen.
Wow man !! Tbh i feel like he was only experimenting with the homeless people , eventually it would of went on to something greater if he wasn’t stopped ‼️ homeless people are still people man ..
So did we need all these pictures of your this man!🤨
I TRUST NO ONE‼️  You never know
They did a photo shoot on him. This is sad, now he will pose for all the other criminals in prison.
God is coming back and I said it!
Dang why all these pics 😒
U would think he’s black?? Black and brown are the same race  y u think so many Latino races look black??
They got this dude entire photo album over at the network 😂😂
Tf is this a photo shoot?😂
He looks disgusting.
Where’s the bay harbor butcher when you need him
How many of yall gonna leave the same comment?
2:23 that’s a lie !!!!
This makes it seem as there promoting a model career or something … wth is going on with the news today.
His eyes just look empty. Reminds me of patrick bateman idk why. Just the African version
CBS... was 13 photos enough for someone who's in custody.  I think we get after 3 dude looked normal. Goes show looks don't matter can't judge on looks.
Aye yo all these pictures tho?
Just when you think the profile photos are done...... NO NO NO WAIT! But there's more! ☝️🤦‍♀️
That is so sad.  The world is coming to an end.  Repentance is needed, you never know when your time will come.  This serial killers are crazy out here in these streets...  SMH  😞Sometimes I sit think and cry about all the evil violence that takes place in the u.s.  Sometimes it just too much, it's too much hurt and pain in the world.  I wish the suffering will just end.
Damn, smh.
He’s not that good looking to keep posting all social media pics lol
This is ridiculous - no actual details connecting this man to the murder, but his entire portfolio is being flashed for our "pleasure."  I so often hate the "news" - they should be honest and call themselves "the gossip."
This is disgusting racism.   That black man did nothing wrong.   Where is BLM
ISIAH 66 VERSE 15, IN THE KING JAMES BIBLE,  GOES THAT THE LORD WILL RETURN WITH FIRE AND HIS SWORD FOR THE WICKED.  BELIEVE THAT.
He is fine as hell the video editor definitely liked the way that man looked
DAMN!"😭💔😢🧸"
SOMEONE" NEEDS" TOO DO HIM" LIKE THAT" LET HIM SEE HOW IT FEELS"😢💔😭!!!"
I’m sure a lot of real estate agents do the same thing. They’re clearly making an example out of him. The justice system really chooses who to mess with. 😩 we all know black people weren’t the first in real estate or doing killings. Way to go now when people see a black reality agent this is what they remember 🤟😏 nice!
Looks narcissistic..
That's crazy, twenty five? Well he has a perfect profile of a serial killer...it's probably not the first lot...
His business is to get people into homes The people who decide to live in public are against his agenda and cause issues with sales in neighborhoods. It makes perfect sense. People act confused without actually thinking through the scenario.
Those eyes are demonic I can discern evil.
Come on now you know what  the government says people of color aren't smart enough to be serial killers
This individual most be really crazy. He is going to look very good in prison.
He ain’t FBA
Ok we get it gesh, the guy wasn't ugly but he's still a lunatic.
The news over exaggerating he clearly killed homeless by his property
This is so sad 😭
On the next Love after Lockup  🤣
Dammn he fine but he evil smh 🤦‍♂️
_its eyes still look dead and cold. Idc how it’s dressed._
Seems like he post his pictures seems like they want him to audition for America's Next Top Model 🤔 🙄
I think the point of what most of you are missing is. I think the editor made a point to say stop assuming all killers look like they been thru hell and back. Looks are extremely deceiving.
It's not about how u look its what's in the heart
He's a good looking guy, but then again when you like at his eyes.
Innocent until proven guilty
Doesn't look like the type what's the evidence
I never let ppl like this slip through the cracks.
Damn dude is an asshole if he is the murderer
Chris Bale, that you playing AP3, with one of your Oscar-winning role-changing appearances?
He does look like he hates cereal 🥣
Why is everyone commenting on his looks?? We know you can get away with crimes & unacceptable behavior based on physical characteristics/aesthetics. It's America. 🤷🏾 Could it be The only people feeling the need to mention this are the ones who take advantage & benefit from it. 🙄
Someone told. He posted pics as an alibi. And still gets caught?...
i can’t focus on what he’s saying with all the fucking glamour shots being rolled out throughout the video. can’t we just get a mugshot?
Why people saying cant judge book by cover?it is part of who we are.we were made to be judge.smh.its common sense and defense mechanism🕵👻
He's a spree killer, not a serial killer.
🎥 American Psycho  The black version.
Damn someone help me it’s a Movie old movie like this somewhat he killed homeless escorts n his friend
Damn bet women was all over dude
You can tell by all those pictures he was a pretty bad narcissist
Movie.. Psycho... Ppl think they crazy just cuz they act tought or have tattoos... Don't piss off someone that looks calm and shows signs of no immotions.. Act gasta on til tok...
That’s fked
miami cops are such liars 😅
I guess they’re not homeless anymore! U can tell he spends a lot of time in front of the mirror! Kind of reminds me of the movie American psycho with Christian Bale!
Homeless lifes matter
This guy has everything. Why would he take the one thing from these homeless people that they have, their life. That all they have. I'm sick in my stomach.
He looks like an utter creep.
Lord..like a Netflix show smh..
He looks a lot older than 25. Thought he was in his 40s.
It only took me .001 seconds before I knew that he's innocent.  There's no motive, he's life is seemingly spotless. I hope he gets a good lawyer. This wouldn't be the first time a innocent man was locked up.
Evil has many faces!!!!
The eyes look evil - he probably hated himself looks like he as living a lie on all fronts
Wow Dexter
The comments about his looks has more to do with classism than him being “good looking.”
🤦🏿‍♂️ why was he targeting homeless though. So random
That’s too bad
If only Dexter Morgan still lived in Miami he’d be on his table
Omg
G👀D L😱😱KING SERIAL KILLER & Y😵UNG!!!!!!! LORD HELP US IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS.🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 SERIAL KILLERS ARE GETTING Y😱UNGER & ARE EVEN ATTRACTIVE. DAMN!!!!!!
...this happened because Dexter moved away from Miami
Finally, the police can be proud of getting that, uhh, hmm, hummana, hummana, hummana.
Qué pedo! Eye for an eye p'al cbrn!
REMINDS ME OF THE MOVIE "AMERICAN PSYCHO" .
Bye
Damn what a psycho. You never know with this crazy people lock him up and through away the key.
He should get the same treatment those kids who shoot up the school get
not really a serial killer, its like calling a gang member or someone in the mob/mafia who has committed multiple murders a serial killer
To the ladies who chasing handsome guys Becareful  most narcissists are serial killers and rapists
2 hours in btwn?? It was going too well for him. He got greedy.
Keep digging detectives!
He is kinda sexy though. Unfortunately he’s not into woman 😤
When the skin on the outside hides the monster inside.
He looks sadistic. Those eyes are not nice at all. They scream hatred of human kind. Norman Bates 2021....
Meet the new Ted Bundy.
Yikes
https://youtu.be/NqfcqzsHOW8
Nope. In some of his photos he looks off, nuts.
Another sad thought… Imagine how many love letters he will receive in jail! 🤔☹️
Goodess graces he finally got caught?
I don’t care How he’s Dressed or Poses- He Honestly Looks DISTURBED😐
Serial killer who loves photos of himself. Enough already.  Horrible human being -- glad they caught this scumbag.
Every individual who posted anything in regard to this guy and his appearance in disbelief should consider themselves fortunate to be alive that they didn't cross his path. They all would have been the PERFECT victim.  A stranger is an unknown person no matter if it has fans or pearly whites. You should know this grown folks. What are you teaching your child(ren).  Somebody talk to me.
Id say there will be more, these guys just dont do it once or twice they do it many times to get their style down pat. The man looks like a sleeze bag, completely fake. Makes you wonder who he really wants to kill in killing homeless men, men who cant protect themselves.
Where is one murder a serial killer tf
IT WAS THE KILLING OF TWO PEOPLE NOW WILL GET YOU THE SERIAL KILLER  LABEL. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF ANY CRIME MAY YOU RIP IF YOU HAVE DIED AS A RESULT. BUT THE CRIMINAL THE MURDERER BETTER KNOW THAT THEY WILL EVENTUALLY MATCH THE CRIME WITH A  NEW LAW. AND WHEN YOU GO TO PRISON IT WILL BE DESIGNED THAT YOU NEVER COME OUT EVER AGAIN. THIS IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT BECAUSE SERIAL KILLERS MEANT MULTIPLE VICTIMS IN THE PAST NOW TWO KILLINGS GET YOU THAT LABEL .Y'ALL BETTER WAKE UP AND FLY RIGHT IN LIFE. BECAUSE IF YOU SLIP UP AND YOUR LIKE HIM 25YRS. OLD YOUR LIFE IS GONE .GOD BLESS ALL FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST LOVE ONES TRAGICALLY TO MURDEROUS MONSTERS EVEN DRESSED IN A  SUIT AMEN⚘⚘⚘😬
All i’m hearing is suspected this, suspected that, and not ONE ounce of clear evidence of HIM being the guy, like where they get him from🤔n why the heck is ppl soooo quick to believe absolutely everything they hear from the internet. Shoot detectives lie too, police, ect, for various reasons, this is nothing new. But again, why they suspected him, idk, they have no type of motive or anything like, ts so random🤦🏽‍♀️ This is allllll alleged and he has YET to be convicted… but y’all folks ina comments way ahead of the game n know this man inside & out head to toe, like y’all saw it with your own eyes already judging him n calling him a psycho, it’s giving straight up simple minded sheep, pls think for yourself, REALLY listen to what’s being said, and still ask questions. When y’all got evidence, please let me know so i can make intelligent judgements, but y’all folks just so quick to believe anybody and anything out of these ppls mouth & it’s sad. Now what if he innocent n they just want to hurry up n pin someone to close the case, if this ever was to come out, y’all go be looking real stupid, n still not learn a thing.
He ain’t all that…but he surely thinks he is!🙄
This n--ga is going to make people look at their real estate agent sideways.
And this is why I don't trust anyone.
This is exactly why we have to be led by the Holy Spirit in all areas of life. God will tell you to leave ppl alone by the darkness they carry.
He hit the douche bag trifecta.
He looks so normal this is so scary
Is he really the killer? 😱
I would love to see how they connected him to this case. Terribly sorry for the victims and I want them to receive justice! By how the police and newsreporters speak, it seems like the case is closed and they are certain it is him.
Not even have money don’t believe fak boo
Unbelievable
So how did they connect him? Still no info
With technology now days they're catch you right away.
Where’s Dexter when you need him
Wow, crazy outrageous story!
BlackTom Cruise from collateral
prey on the weak.   coward.
So is he a Mexican or Dominican Ted bundy? Because good looking seems successful multiple types of life once he left his home it even seems eerie I wouldn’t be surprised if they ran his dna to other cases unsolved ..... damn he is truly a triple threat
He's a Spree killer serial killers kill after time spree is one after the other in a short time
Obviously not a typical very smart cunning & evil serial killer - thankfully he’s actually just an arrogant bully thug too dumb to get away with continuing. Again THANKFULLY as there are way TOO MANY actual smart & incredibly cunning evil serial killers much harder to identify much less arrest. This punk is a punk

Homeless now lifeless because of this evil man, death penalty needs to be the outcome if he's found guilty, the victims had no time in court, so should he be able to use the courts for his benefit, NO.
Don't you have to kill more than two to be named a serial killer
I agree, way too many photos of this guy.
Who signed off on the slideshow?
Killing people for being homeless? This guy is a real piece of work
This is very scary..a handsome model looking man a serial killer??!!..anyone could fall victim to his looks alone and be easy prey..
Women want him men revere him and homeless fear him what a guy
Unless he's a model that is WAAAY too many photos for a grown man to have of himself. Theres no one else in them! Red flag on homeboy
Pretty boy in love with himself. Clint Eastwood's movie 1968
Just because someone doesn't have a criminal history doesn't mean they aren't criminals... it just means they never got caught. 😂
The slide show cracks me up.  Why didn’t the show the victims?
Welcome to the United States!
This guy probably had "American psycho" the movie on Repeat.
This guy definitely thinks he’s white😂
Am I missing something , assault and 1 murder don’t make you serial killer.  Takes 3 I believe
He look Gay4paY😁😁😁
It’s in the eyes chiko, he looks zoned out
Man we throw that serial killer term around so loosely.
This guy got good looks for committing serial killer against the homeless.
This is so sad that anyone would kill anyone, just because there homeless I hope he gets what he deserve he should never get out of prison, he should spend the rest of his life locked up because he has issues with people who are less fortunate.
Had to be "OF COLOR" 😆
What’s more shocking to me, is that the guy is Black !!! O.o
Enjoy Prison Willy boy
You can’t have a fair trial in the us because the news makes you look guilty from the beginning
You can't judge a book by its cover and you certainly can NOT judge a person by its ethnicity or skin color.   Be wise
I can see the cult fame hes gonna get now....
WHAT WAS THE REASON?!
Looks don't mean nothing if you have a black heart. Clearly this dude is sick and evil. Prayers to the victims cuz they didn't deserve that.
Loser. Hurting the innocent. He thinks no one cares about the homeless well that's what he gets now
They have a camera roll of this guy 😂 wtf this shit is so funny lmbo
Alot of homeless are mentally ill, some with no surviving family to help them. They don't deserve any more troubles than they already have. Then here comes Mr. got all the cupcakes & a gun. If your not going to help these people, plz leave them alone.
Why? Killing the homeless?  It just doesn’t add up it doesn’t make sense. I can’t wait to here his interrogation interview. I hope they make it public.
Is this a murder investigation or a modeling interview 🙄🤡news
His looks will get him a long way in prison 🥰😍😛👅👄
Woah 😨
Seems like a common criminal act to commit crime against homeless not just in Florida…maybe it’s an ego thing like stepping on someone who is less fortunate to boost their confidence aka narcissist.
I bet he watched American Psycho
He doesn't look smooth or intelligent.
I don't believe this. Why would he kill homeless people. They are lying.
He doesn't look like a real person.  Deepfake / A.I. Generated. Start @1:15
Real psychopath
Damn so he was a man with enough money to do anything, he wanted to do, and he’s so evil he chose to hunt and kill the defenseless homeless people. How sickening 🤮🤮🤮 I hope he gets the death penalty
If you're a serial killer pro tip: don't do anything that will land you in jail or will catch the eyes of the police
He looks like a nice looking men , so scary to know he’s a sicko
Damn are u all advertising his modeling career? 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Does anyone know why he did this?
Looks is very deceiving
Okay, we get it, he’s a hot SERIAL KILLER. Can y’all focus on the victims now? What’s with the slide show?
He's going to be VERY popular in The Big House. Coward, killing people who couldn't defend themselves.
Why so many pictures?!
Demons don’t discriminate who they possess , that’s why is important to stay on guard with prayer , so that your house is never empty , if we lower your guard , they they come to try to occupy the empty house
Imagine women who dated this sick bastard
I think the point of showing all the pics is because the officers themselves were shocked
So he waited for 25 years of age and decided he wants to become a serial killer. You don’t need a degree,  it’s volunteer, exciting, adventurous and extremely rewarding. Wow!😵‍💫👿👹😈🔪🔫👀
Hes going to see how luxurious prison is.....they are going to love this pretty boy. Bubba thinks hes got a pretty mouth...lol
Reminds me of Christian Bale in the movie American Psycho...  Tragic for his victims, if convicted he deserves life in prison.
I'm so sorry for the families 😔🙏...But I stop on this story because of how cute the pic was..they could have picked a worse one...dang😂💯..Even the Spanish cop fine😉🤣
SMH. Evil 😈
whats with privledge people killing extremely poor people? Victims were homeless, cant imagine what his thought process was.
He looks deranged & like a narcissist & could be rainbow
Lol they will have field day with him in PRISON !!!! GOOD LUCK PRETTY BOY!!!
What the hell he got against homeless people.
TRESPASSING...A FASCINATING STORY???🤔 WTF??🤔 LOOKS ARE DEFINITELY DECEIVING...HE IS HANDSOME BUT NOT WELL AT ALL. SINISTER, DIABOLICAL.😈 NOW WE ASK WHY HOMELESS PEOPLE?🤔 AS I TELL MY FANS, THINK LIKE A KILLER-DON'T ASK "WHY" BUT ASK "WHY NOT"? WHAT WILL BE INTERESTING IS THE EXTRA STUFF THAT'S GONNA COME OUT...MERCY ME.😩 PLEASE FOLLOW EVERYDAY SHENANIGANS FOR BREAKING NEWS AND TRUE CRIME.. THANKS!
Black Fragility strikes again
That so sad prayers go out to the victims, they may been homeless but I'm sure they had families and friends that loved them. And I'm glad they got a serial killer of the streets.
I use to work in Wynwood, that area is full with homeless people. But damn why bother these people. I use to feel extremely bad when it rain they still out there, when it’s cold or hot they still there. I hated working in that area.
Psychopath
You really can't judge a book my its cover!! 👀 "Willy" is FIINNNEEEE!! And seemed to have his stuff together. Smh.....sad state of affairs.
Some real Michael Meyers walking around here..
Who murders homeless? God, he’s absolutely evil in human form! Heartless coward! Only makes me wonder how many other victims he took from their precious life. May he suffer greatly every second of his remaining life!
Never heard of a murder victim who survived
So scary imagine this guy laying next to you  in bed at night not knowing he’s a serial whole killer!!!😟
Narcissist
I think they showed so many pictures so we can see how much his faces changed just in case anyone recognizes him
Can't wait to see how many ppl start advocating for him simply bcuz of his looks 🙄
He looks very handsome..
Everyone talking about him and his looks no one speaking on the homeless victims… maybe the only way their family will find out
This is a super rare thing- so yes, every pic of a suspected serial killer is shown. Every available pic of Ted Bundy was splashed everywhere at the time.
I Don’t believe None of this BS. Calling this person a serial killer with No evidence!!! Specially in Miami Dade. Police will do & say Anything there for a black conviction. Foh
Wow. Handsome. Trust nobody ladies, you never know. Looks like sugar & turns out to be shit. Scary
Chiiiiiile he fine as wine!!! 👀🥴😂😂
An elite level of a BLM member.
Looks like a dating app profile
This is sensationalism, he's good looking, The media does this for the beautiful ❤️ Even suspected murderers! Remember Ted Bundy, the same slick journalism used to describe him, this is nothing new.
The dude probably just found out he had HIV or something... Trying to find a motive, folks.
Out there sacrificing random ppl smh
I went to school with a guy that was very nice looking and we were all stunned that he raped many women, it's not about looks, it's about them wanting to be In control, he could have had any girlfriend he wanted but he chose to rape women of all ages. What a waste
We talkin about the serial killer dude's eyes being cold. What about the damn reporter then 😂
He probably killed before. How come you kill let alone 2 people and go home normally?!
There are something like 2000 active serial killers in the U.S. (f.b.i. estimate) God only knows how many other killers there actually are . Glad they got him
Deport this physcho path back to Cuba ASAP!!
I'm still waiting to hear a shred of evidence that says he did this. I hope they have something that will stick, but they should at least reveal something about the evidence that led to his arrest.
News showing this coward photos like advertisement🤦🏽‍♂️
On several of these photos, there’s absolutely nothing in his eyes. I’m talking no life whatsoever.
Well he caught so he AINT hot shit
He’s got evil written all over his face, can see it clear as day
Murders 2 hrs apart are not how serial killers work...now they will pin other unsolved cases on him to close them
A real estate agent murdering people who don’t have homes. You can’t make this stuff up.
Guys monsters these days look just like this...so nice and sweet...and then bam..so trust your gut lady's and gentlemen...what kind of person kills homeless people..as if they're not down enough..just wow guy
Godamn gotta be scared of young the regular looking folks now LOL
He did this shit for fun with his friends. I'm willing to bet it all on that.
He is a very handsome  man.  The title alone gives me chills
How many does one need to kill to become a serial killer?
Is he The Sears Catalog Serial Killer?  I mean good grief…three clear pics is enough and not one of them show him with bloody hands!  Meanwhile someone gets shoved onto the train tracks and the footage is grainy af.
I’m not saying he’s innocent but we’re not even giving a chance for information on the case to be released. Innocent until proven guilty. Not guilty until proven innocent. What if there’s a possibility he’s not the murderer and the real murderer is still out here? Have we not been through this time and time again? He could very well be guilty but it has to be proven, individuals wishing the worst for this man…..  see the evidence & the verdict before naming him the killer
LAW ABIDING LIVES REALLY MATTER  !!
In the US everybody is innocent UNTIL proved otherwise. Let see what happens.
The new Ted Bundy 2021!
2 murders does not make one a serial killer. He went on a killing spree.
Where are the pictures of Mr. Maceo getting his Brazilian wax treatment? What is the police hiding?
Ya mean he destroyed some Sugar Smacks and Lucky Charms?  I love that stuff.... Serial killers are terrible.
He look a lil zesty 💅 tah me but idk 🤷🏼‍♀️😭
He didnt think he would get caught
Smh
Psychopath. Wasn’t there a movie made w same circumstances; good looking young man moonlighting as a serial killer?
2021 proved to be a year of, revealing people for who they really are!
2:24 it’s the joker
I need more facts on this  case because something just not adding up.  Like the motive , connection, and his background.  But I like what the police officer said, do not judge a book by its cover
Serial killers.  Is he an illegal?   How many are coming in that we don’t know about.    We need strict laws.  Stop this catch and release no bail BS
He is so fine wtf
They should also see if he was on dating sites. If so check for missing women in Florida.
His whole photo album is on the news
To bad dexter doesn't live in Miami anymore lol
100% Patrick Bateman vibes
The love for one another is waxing cold. The people that you think are good are turning bad. Better start praying.
Just by his many photos I can tell he's a fruity narcissist.
GEEZ!!! ugh. Be careful out there people.
Someome at CBS Miami in love with Willy 🤣🤣🤣
I'm interested in hearing how he ended up a suspect in these crimes. What was the break in the case? I guess we'll know soon enough.
Two murders is classified as serial killer?
Serial killer??? Seriously??? Murderer definitely, but calling him a serial killer is like saying Joe Biden’s doing a great job😂😆🤣👌 Hie crimes doesn’t meet the criteria to be serial killer. Just like Joe B doesn’t… never mind, lol!!
That’s crazy cuz if I bumped into him walking down the street he the last person I’d think would be a serial killer lol
😔 I know a lot of home less people,  the victims did not deserve this
He was killing crackheads, that's awesome. Thank u sir, for trying to make the world a better place.
Cops are morons like most humans. They always judge a book by it's cover. Seems like this guy was very ambitious, and took it very personal that others didn't look like they had the same ambition. Congrats for throwing your life away for something you have zero control over.
Maybe Kim Kardashian can help this guy get out and become a Instagram model...
Wow he so handsome
Why the hell do they plaster the face of this guy all over the place? This is what people like this guy want... They want to be famous for this shit. Of course news doesn't care why you watch .. Just that you watch.
The saddest part is that we even have to mention "we can't go after someone based off looks".…goes to show you how vain this world really is.
Damn, he one fine ass serial killer
Not to smart.
He's so pretty, the other inmates are going to handing him a bar of soap to drop 10 -20 times daily.
Why can't there be a serial killer who kills  violent criminals?
It's never the one you see it's the one you don't
He’ll probably get less time than that trucker from Colorado smh
Criminals in suits run this nation.  IJS 🤷🏽‍♀️
You Do The Crime You Pay For The Crime In Our Country In Our Communities Our Cities Our Streets
A High Maintenance Serial Killer
The look on his face tell a lot.Evil.
Something about his eyes are weird. What’s up with the Tender portfolio?
🤬🖕 hope he stays in jail 4ever.
Guy looks well dressed and ready to mingle any ladies interested. Yeah people do not judge books by covers period. The wolves are always in sheep clothing.
The Kingdom of Satan is real. And they are organized.
This is horrible…killing ppl who are homeless as if life hasn’t already beaten them down. On another note- If he is a serial killer then he took the crown from Ted Bundy cause this guy is really good looking.
Everytime I watch a movie or show with the setting in Florida there’s killing. Low key programming right from your living room
CRAZY....
I usually see about 2 photos of suspected murderer. Bih, they had me laughing hysterically with this 13 photo slideshow 😂 I thought they were gonna drop a nude pic lol. Bruh like... y'all can arrest me and here is my instagram login 😂
This man’s eyes look soulless, evil, lacking any emotions hollow in every picture. He is truly evil
The rage mentality in full effect.
The new Jeffrey!!!! 😑
Actual modern day Patrick Bateman
Wow what a sick guy,  he's a Cuban. 25 yrs old   and a serial killer, I feel sorry for his mom
Maceo is gay… hopefully not the reason for his kills… if this dude is guilty
I can't wait to hear what The View has to say about this.
This guy is a real gta character
Life no parole. 👋 Dont drop the soap. 😆
Willie looks creepy, his persona screams facade, his eyes are void of any affect.
He deserved a slow and severe punishment.
It was a story like this in atl homicide detective.
His eyes look dark
Where’s Dexter Morgan in real life?
When you take many selfies or pics of yourself.
IS THIS GUY FROM CUBA OR PUERTO RICO, JAMAICAN  ???
❤ loves homeless men = pyschopath
Well, he's guilty for being in love with himself. I have only 4-6 photos on Facebook. This guy has over 100 photos of himself at least 1 weeks worth of photos which is SCARY 😨 😳 😬
Arrested and SUSPECTED. Not charged or  convicted. Isnt that the American way?
He's going to plead not guilty, and convince his family it's not true. However, I don't believe he would have been arrested if they wouldn't have any evidence. Concrete evidence. Just goes to show you, never go by someone's looks. The devil could be right in your own backyard, and family. My sympathies for the family.
Thank you Miami PD for catching this guy
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 When he got caught he offered the male officers fornication individually or both at same time. After accepting, they arrested him anyway.
😞😖😣😞😣😖😞😣😖😞😣 Typical mistake: GOT GREEDY. That's how people F up and get caught. 2 hours apart? That's begging to get arrested. A gun? Unless he had a silencer that's begging to get arrested. Should have waited 3 or even better 6 months or one year apart. I'm sure he will enjoy his time in prison though.
🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈 When I saw the pictures I had assumed he was terminating his Grindr dates to stay in the closet.
🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟  He obviously was bothered by them decreasing the property values. He still would be free if he gave them $20 to get on a bus with one way ticket 🎟 out of town.
Well he is dark-skinned that's a red 🚩 flag right there. 😋😋😋
The guy is a psychopath. Just cold and heartless smh.
Anchor- “there’s a good chance the homeless victim wouldn’t make it “ what good is there?🤬🤬🤬
That guy really looks scary.      Just imagine all the heinous crimes that miscreant has gotten away with since he was old enough to walk like a human.
I dunno I hope more info comes forward. The details all seems like accusations right now. Hopefully some more solid evidence comes forth that gives a clearer backstory to these crimes. If he really did it then he’s were he belongs.
Well I hope they can prove he the killer. Lock him up and throw away the key
THE BOYS ARE GONNA HAVE A FEILD DAY WITH HIM IN THE PEN WITH HIS FINE SERIAL KILLING ASS
I could be wrong ,,, but if only  one person was actually killed ,,, I'm not too sure that qualified as a serial killer ... horrible and terrible to attack homeless people or anyone else . But still not quite a serial killer . How ever ,,, getting this deranged man off the streets definitely prevents him from becoming a serial killer
I see the comments about the 'photoshoot' of the suspected serial killer. While I would agree it's unusual to see, I understand why they added it. It's intent was to show all sides of this suspect, reinforcing that a killer can be anyone in disguise.
Wow! 25 yrs old and a serial killer. Folks be careful out here. Lord bless the victims families and let justice be served
Just because this monster is gay doesn't mean he's a fine citizen they're full of secrets careful out there people trust no body 🎅
He looks like a model . Now he will be a model play thing prisoner for sure ,wow !!
Crypto investor turned serial killer... what a story.
what an evil mind person, he looks like he is cool  with that!!  rot in jail/hell/ your are hacked stay in jail!!  no phones and no computers!!  read books in jail try the Holy Bible!!!
Prime example of never to judge a book by its cover. You can be gorgeous on the outside but a demon on the inside. So glad he was caught though.
3:32 that kevin samuels pose 💀
A beautiful looking man like him is a serial killer????? He looks like a model. This is scary. You can't trust anyone
It's the ones with no tattoos and a job that try to fit into the circus you need to watch out for.
wtf was up with all this Facebook narcissism? Please, spare us!
He has dark black EVIL eyes. A demon who looked like a fashion model.
He had issues with homelessness and homeless people. What a weirdo.
why they showing 100 pics of this guy lol
Soe DNC member will release him back into the public. It is what the DNC does now.
So many people like this in America…
So many serial killers in America…
So many serial killers in America right now. Soooooooooo many.
Sentence the crap out of him and then if he makes it through jail, put him in a canoe back to his homeland.
darkness covers the earth.  gross darkness is over the people.
what is the difference in result of a murder and a fatal stabbing?   I must be loosing my mind .......
Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?
Florida is looking more like Mexico everyday
Wait ain’t he suppose to be white 😂
He is a spree killer not a serial killer.

He was a fake as f ck poser.
This is ego running rampant and he was power hungry. That has no boundaries in looks, class nor social status and hope he rots in jail and never sees freedom again. To attack the most vulnerable is the most cowardly way to get your kicks.
What good looking man Damn Why is the good ones that are such shi#s?.
That Lamborghini sounds @0:40 seconds tho!! Lol
Technically serial killers classify as someone who kills three or more people in three or more separate occasions.
I just watched a YT video w/ a black comedian making fun of the "fact" that all serial killers are white...not anymore
So for the first murder, the victim survived? Then it's not a murder, is it?
“A good chance he will not make it” damn, the way he worded it was a little…💀
Weird!
What a POS cold hearted evil wolf in sheep's clothing.  Seems this ghoul had it all, good job, nice clothes, nice car, a fine housing situation, a bright future.  He then attacks the weakest among us, homeless persons who basically have nothing, not even a voice.  What a lowlife scumbag predator, have fun getting punked in THE BIG HOUSE tough guy, you deserve the stiffest sentence allowed in our justice system.  Prayers and condolences to the families of the victims and also for the recovery of the victim in the hospital.
Tomb nail is like .. hello detroit urban survival training 😠
The heart is deceitful.
So they already down on their luck and now you go hunting them?????? WTF??? WHY?
Was he obsessed with killing Black American Women?
Now why they showed all them damn photos of him ?  More shocked how some of you could determine how a killer suppose to look … Keep being naive 🙃
COMPLETE COWARD KILLING HOMELESS PEOPLE ... HOPE THEY GIVE HIM THE ELECTRIC CHAIR DON'T WASTE TAXPAYERS MONEY KEEPING HIM ALIVE !
This why I don't leave the how at all since I'm in south Florida now
This man is twisted why would you kill a homeless person what's the point
Are you afraid of death?   Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
WTF is up with the stupid photo array? Like he's an actor and you're trying to be his agent.
I tell people all the time, most police officers are nothing but Psychopaths. The ones that doesn't speak out about police killings or brutality are scared to say anything.
Narcissistic sociopath.
A serial killer? In Miami ?....someone call Dexter.
Am I the only one reminded of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho?
These photos were all taken from his facebook page.. I'm sure this guy is a narcissist
Dexter would have got him sooner or later
https://youtu.be/eERoHGtBcFE
Ah nothing new
Two victims and he is a serial killer it has to be more to this story.
🦻🏾👁👁👂🏾
This was a 🤬 hobby for him!
*CAPTAIN CRUNCH HATE CRIME!!!!!!!!!!* 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Harming homeless people omg Jack the Ripper type. He probably hates poverty and that’s why he’s attacking people who remind him of what he doesn’t want to be
He doesn't look nice to me he looks like a weirdo you can put a $1,000 suit on clown and it still will look like clown. Money and looks don't you trust!! I don't trust anyone when Im people in the city
patrick bateman is alive and well in 2021
Sicko!
Never relax
Whats with all these bots in the comments?
He hung up on his own looks isn't he ?
He killed homeless men....to go to prison ....just a waste of life. Delusional Mental Illness.  25 years old....they're waiting on him....pretty boy toy now. Welcome to your new residence.
Just randomly killing homeless people?

Marcus from Watch dogs 2?
"There is a good chance, that he will not make it" WTF HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT
He’s a handsome serial killer. I feel bad for the victims families. Just goes to show you criminals comes in any shape size and background.
Cute but bat-***t crazy!  Shame.
RIP to the victims So sad Disgusting what he did
Daddy issues....
How does he look smart and trust worthy to you guys ? lol it’s so funny to me what people think looks safe
This goes to show you how easily LED most people are. The police have not revealed any concrete evidence and just because they report something, you all are condemning a person. That's how I know in this country you are not innocent until proven guilty, unless you are some dumb cop.
Repent Israelites all praise to the most high YAHAWAH AND HIS SON YAHAWASHI🙏🏽🛸🛸🛸🛸🤴🏽🦁⌛️🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽
Hey, let's open our borders!
Oh no, its against the narrative....so goes the myth and hustle...can you sp/mell B.S.?
He's out now on a $ 20.00 dollar bail.
A migrant?
You don't judge people by their looks and colors chief???
another dem voter
3:23 "One resulting in a murder and the other in a fatal stabbing": Wouldn't they both be murder, then? o.O
Giving off all sorts of narcissistic psychopath vibes.
Souls collector..Devil's work
They caught Dext......nevermind!
LORTY LORTY LORTY!!!!! HE WAS BLESSED WITH THEM LOOKS AND CRAZY DEN A BETSY BUG!!!! DANG!!! #DETROIT #LOVE

That man is pure evil.
"F U C K E N" FREAK!!!😡
Wow! 25 yrs old and a serial killer. Folks be careful out here. Lord bless the victims families and let justice be served
Sad 😔   a beautiful man is going to jail.
What a very BAD, BAD, Man!  Why in the world would would he want to throw his entire life away?!  Like this…. I mean the man had some goals and was living up life and he threw it all away just like that!  So stupid!!!! Feel sorry for his employer Century 21,  bad press for that real estate company.  Imagine your an agent passing out your business cards to people one look at your card and they thinking 💭 oh didn’t you have a serial killer employed by your company?  Anyways….this guy needs some frickn’ help psychologically or need some meds……normal people don’t do this kind of Sh*t!   Hope the judge gives him life!  Person like this can’t be put back on the streets!!!!
Looking at him, you may want to bring him home to meet your family....a serial killer. You can't put anything past anyone.
They don't take kindly to officers in jail. And hes pretty. He will be somebody butt target soon enough.
He looks kind of sweet
I may have missed something how did they tie him to the crime??
He gay as that thang most likely he was coming on too those homeless men and they didn’t want him
Hurting the Homeless....How weak
So. Is a murder, and a fatal stabbing two different things? Because that's what the reporter said... Like only the murder with a gun is murder.. man, they gotta cram the narrative down our throats no matter what it is.  NO!! a murder is a murder, no matter the weapon involved, even if it is just hands being used, if someone is killed on purpose by someone else, guess what? It's murder. Guns, knives, cars, fists, rope, glass, water. It doesn't matter. They are wording it so that the gun murder sounds worse than the knife murder. Fu(k the msm
Fancies himself as quite the big shot  ....... LIFE! in prison!
Look at his eyes. The eyes never lie.
There's no life in his eyes or smile. Psychopaths running wild
Crazy ppl everywhere😳
Progressives AKA The Insane: "This is somehow White people's fault. Our crayon people can do no wrong. reeeeeeee"
Being a serial killer these days is nearly impossible, hard to go on a kill streak with cameras everywhere
This is what happens when you have a media and movie industry glorify serial killing, and serial killers. netflix alone made like multiple shows/movies where they make the serial killer seem like a cool and misunderstood person.
Meanwhile Miami let's anyone in there long as they are latino, looks latino, sound latino or seems latino.
fine as he is out here killing folk wtf wrong with ppl
Don’t trust anyone named “Willy”.
Omg crypto SHOUTOUT
Umm...it's never a "good possibility" that someone will die.  That is a "bad" possibility.  Best to just leave it at "it is possible that he won't survive his injuries."
why do they need to show all of this killers well-groomed pictures?
I bet the truth us , He really wanted to achieve the ultimate , Money , looks , Power , Materialistic things , And the one thing he was missing was killing and taking a life but how ? Hmmm He thought to himself I'll kill helpless homeless people they are easy targets that nobody cares about... But what he failed to know is Democrats love their homeless people they need them in place like political chess pieces. It's like George Carlin said... The rich do none of the work and have all of the money and pays little to no taxes , The middle class does all the work and pays all of the taxes , The poor and the homeless are there just to scare the crap out of the middle class... But back to this guy Willy , Yes he thought he was going to achieve the ultimate goal and have it all. Tell me ? these homeless people were they all white ?
Why so many great pictures of this person?? If u turned off the volume it would like they were advertising someone who is single and looking for love. I know they showed the police conference but I don't know this video seemed of a weird 2 me. However I'm glad they arrested this guy.
Why target people on the bottom not bothering anyone?
This doesn't meet the definition of serial killer. It barely meets the definition of spree killer. Flordia trying to keep its citizens terrified, like usual.
Killers have got reasonable reasons. Reasons which are literally impossible to comprehend. Basically non-sense than self-desires triggered with the will to kill.
The youth are losing their mind.The Internet will show you a thrill to kill 2022 is coming ☣️☢️
And one with a badge!
Not surprised.  Places like Miami and Los Angeles attract deviants and degenerates.  Alot of sociopath like the glamorous back drop these places provide.  They helped ruin these cities for working class families.
So sad. 1 John 5:19 We know we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. Stay safe everyone 💜
He will get an executive position for big pharma.
Mannnnnn stooooppppp that man ain’t do shit an they know it
The world going crazy
Short lived serial killer career
,Cop kills baby mother in cops blood sad so many woman and men involved with cops  can't leave
A young, handsome, wealthy (looking) black guy is the last person you'd expect to be running around killing homeless people.  I like to think I'm smart enough to not judge people based on how they look but man.  Dude is pretty much the exact opposite of the stereotypical American serial killer in nearly all aspects.
Went to highschool with this kid, we had 2 classes together. This is just fucking crazy lol
This is why we need spiritual discernment with everyone we interact with. Evil doesn't have a "look".  Ephesians 6:10 to 6:18
Wow!!! Smh
Serial killer ANNNNDDDD stock art model LMFAOOOO
Sounds more like a spree killer.
Yup never judge a book by its cover. He’s handsome I’m not gonna lie. He could’ve been so much more (male model) but a serial killer? Wow! Wtf
What a scumbag preying on people who already got it bad. Give him the chair
He might be a killer but he's not a serial killer...  That's a white person thing.... Real estate and homeless.. two things tht don't go together.. #motives
He is 25 years going around murdering homeless people.  There is nothing better he could’ve use his time to do. Now the prisoners gonna deal with him accordingly.
Good guy getting rid of homeless trash
FEED ME A STRAY CAT
Whada dooosh! He should be charged with taking doooshbag pix. Doooooosh!
Wow! 25 yrs old and a serial killer. Folks be careful out here. Lord bless the victims families and let justice be served
I knew this dude was crazy! We were in 1st grade together. He carried a metal Duke's of Hazzard Lunch Box that was filled with pointy popsicle sticks.
He looks gay
Just another result of this sick society.  3million laws, 300 million tv brainwashed tax slaves.  Love your mental governance. Back to work, tax slave.
Even the most good looking people can be manipulated by demons. They say even Lucifer was a beautiful angel before he was cast down in hell
He’s got killer eyes. Reached that other side.
He looks like the type of dude, who watches the Fresh & Fit Podcast, religiously.
First handsome serial killer?! WTF?! Pause.
“White supremacists are America’s greatest threat!”-Joe Bumbles Biden
This news report reminds me of that homeless man scene from American Psycho.
Why did they use all the nice pictures of him…? Am I the only one asking that
Complete psychopath. Guessing he watched American psycho too many times.
If they have to release him, he might be welcome in San Francisco.
Serial killers can manifest themselves as many different personalities and social statuses. You can never be too careful when your gut feeling warns you about an odd person. We have the natural ability of social cues, and our intuition should never be ignored.
Bonded out today. Yay!
The first murder victim survived? Really??
Dexter
Now he will get famous on TikTok and every 14 yr old girl in the Country will say "He's too cute to be a serial killer! Free him!!" And he will end up nationally famous and wealthy from the exposure. Media doesn't help either,  making murderers seem like celebrities. 🙄
APPEARANCE CAN BE DECEIVING, SERIOUS KILLER,
Sad because he is so handsome. I'm a male and I would've dated him
You gotta love how murderers and other heartless sociopaths think donning eyeglasses at trial will make them  look like what-they-ain't ... HUMAN! 😂😂😂
He clearly got something against homeless ppl
This is when I wish Dexter was a real person. Willy obviously didn’t think anyone cared about Homeless people and he was wrong. I’m glad the Police were able to capture him, because he is Evil .
They're gonna 💘 him in that jail!😀
What is wrong with people. What the hell do you get out of murdering ppl...especially just shooting from your car & driving off. Like it's 2021, you will get caught at some point. I'll never understand how ppl can be this sadistic & just dumb!
Evil comes in all shape sizes and appearances.. period
Damn I used to work with this dude we used to talk sometimes at lunch I'll be damned 🤯
Gangsta serial killa
Kill YouTubers!!!! Youlll be a hero!!! America will love u
Why does he look like he’s about to give me bad self defense advice
So poverty isn't the motivating factor.
So they decided to show millions of pictures of this dude 😒 felt like they promoting him smh and it’s even trending can’t believe how news now days has downgraded
Dude look like me 😄😄😄😄
As if the Homeless dont have it hard enough!!! YOURE A COWARD!!!
With his hansom Looks , Wouldn't he not have any time and out with the Lady's? Is he Straight?
My God. What is wrong with humanity?
That’s so horrible. To hurt or kill the homeless is so wrong. It’s sad that instead of wanting to help, some see an opportunity to harm.
He's one handsome ass sexy murderer!
Wow. I'm glad they caught him.
Innocent until proven guilty
sounds more like a spree killer...i will follow this one...
Some folks should not exist at all.  This dude being one of them.
Should’ve made himself useful and went after sex offenders.
He seems like  a dl homosexual. He was abused as a child and now  seeks revenge...rip to this who died
Evil has no eyes.. never judge a book by its cover
“Jesus answered him, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.’” John 3:3 ESV
There are tons of series killers here in the sunshine state of Florida. Maybe it's the sunshine and high humidity 🤔.
Weird how this man favors my husband 😳
Why are we looking at his modeling photos and not his mugshots?
So the only proof you showed me was FB pictures of him... thanks
It's funny how those same police who be kicking those homeless from sleeping safe at the park , and now pretending like they care . If the government didn't the homeless out the park that wouldn't never happened . The same restaurant employees and and security guards who didn't care about the homeless , and now coming out pretnding to care. SMH
There’s probably a lot more victims
You  think some people be out here making an honest living,all the while they taking lives .No amount of money would make me do ANYTHING evil or vindictive to no human being.I am so  grateful and blessed that I value other  peoples lives as well as my own.Now the least likely is suspect.Be safe!
He's going to be someone's honey bun
How does someone have enough energy and time to look that good, work full time, and kill people?
Are homeless people that annoying to get on this man's last nerve
I lived in Salt Lake City when Ted Bundy and then Arthur Gary Bishop (aka Roger W Downs) were on the loose there. Guys like can appear very charming and likable but they are so cold blooded that their veins have ice in them. I'm so very glad that this evil monster is now behind bars.
That's the problem stop trying to put a certain character to these murders just find the sicko and they did....being shocked is him being blocked
he looks kind of like Trey songs or is it just me?
Rip to the homeless who lost there lives😳😔🙏🏾🥺
Can I get his car since he can’t have it no more lol
Willy has several women who adore him. Black female: "Girl, I don't care how many people he killed, he fine."
Ted Bundy 2000
Maybe he had too much watched violent films and other prohibited substances
you never know... only God can judge us.
I'm never surprised about anything that I see on the news today.
Man leave these people alone . Who tf kills homeless helpless people smh
So sad they make GTA for normal people
I think they were obsessed with showing his pictures.
Show his mug shot.. you giving him the attention he wants with his facefck pics.  Poor journalism.
dude wanted to be Patrick Bateman... RIP all victims
dude took the movie american Psycho and Patrick Bateman too serious...
This is very intriguing...cant wait to learn more about him and why he felt he had to get rid of homeless....
Sounds like B.S..
Suspected is the key word. Yet here we go having another trial by media.
This "man" is the epitome of a damn psychopath. The many goofy head shots shows a narcissistic psychopath. Disgusting.
Absolutely disgusting !! I just don’t understand why people can’t just be good. So sorry to those who have lost their lives rip.
Everyone in these comments condemning this dude probably subscribe to his social media.
Is it really considered a serial killer if it’s two deaths within two hours?   I thought serial killers killed several people over a longer length of time
We are breeding spoiled rotten creeps. I'm surprised he doesn't have a cult... yet. Put him in jail and see how many followers and let him out in 20 yrs. See if he fits ur stereo type now.
I hope the booty bandit pays him a visit
They Sure Wanted Us To Know What He Looked Like Huh😏
Serial killer?  Nothing I heard makes him a serial killer.
"the devil wears prada"...
That's nice.  There's still serial killers
Demons don’t care who’s soul they possess to do their evil work. Never judge a book by its cover.
He is FINE ASS HELL
The New Dexter?
Handsome, young, tall, muscular, etc I can already see girls coming to his defense.
Actually if you know what to look for he looks exactly like a serial killer, it's people's own denial that makes them look past him
Fake smile, pretty but DEAD EYES.
Low life
Damn, you never know who is really evil. I'm just glad they got him.  On another note: That reporter looks exactly like Keir Simmons! Maybe he's his long lost American brother. lol
This dude is the real American phyco!
Satan wears Many Costumes
What a Pschyo
Wow! 25 yrs old and a serial killer. Folks be careful out here. Lord bless the victims families and let justice be served 
What they are saying is that they are not surprised (but they really are) that even a good looking, well kept man (high school educated, real estate broker and Instagram poser) with no record, that doesn't fit their typical description can do the most evil things in this world.
I hoped that you get what you deserved in Prison.
This is not a "serial killer"
He thought 💭 he is Batman saving the city ..,Kyle Rittenhouse part 2 ✊🏾✊🏽✊🏿😂🤣🤣
Cuban.. In dade? Criminal? no surprise.. But serial killer? that's new..
To everyone in the comments(especially the ladies), please stop making this dude trend because might be “handsome”. Honestly the important piece to pull out of this is the daft that he portrays himself as a normal person. There’s more to than meets the eye.
Send in Dexter Morgan from Miami metro
See how accurate fakebook pictures and perceived lifestyles are?
The homeless guy must have had a MAGA hat and some bleach.
Demonic possession , be weary of strange temptations that are not you.
Trump/Cruz 2024
Oh my God, they keep showing his modeling portfolio. Ridiculous
Ain’t most cops serial killers 🤔
Biden’s “dreamers” coming soon to a city near you.
Anyone here as a result of the tv show dexter
Wow. Attractive male just like Ted Bundy. Pschyopaths have no gentler nor race. Just evil in common.
WTF FOR THE MONTAGE???
The overdone fashion stock photos could suggest he has something to hide...he was trying hard...
Wow...people are something else..smfh
Apliquen la ley capital y los delicuentes se acaban, la ley capital fue establecida por mandato Divino no po el hombre.
Wow! 25 yrs old and a serial killer. Folks be careful out here. Lord bless the victims families and let justice be served 
He likes real estate, fast cars and crypto?! So what?
On a random brighter note….. Merry “PURRRistmas” everyone ❤️🎄 https://youtu.be/_FJ8sXCw1cE
Real-estate people are weird, I used to do work with a lot of different companies and it wouldn't shock me if there were a few among those.  A lot of them seem like sociopaths or whatever Jimmy Fallon has, where they aren't listening but pretend to and don't seem like they are there?.?.?.-_-
Evil comes in all shapes, sizes and colors 💯
Sick. Just. Damn. Sick.
He gonna be real popular in county jail.
He seems like he was into himself. He never takes pics with anybody.
We could look the other way until he got the homeless problem cleaned up...
People have gone crazy what’s happening in America.
Wow! 25 yrs old and a serial killer. Folks be careful out here. Lord bless the victims families and let justice be served 
Wonder how many marriage proposals he will be get in jail.
This dude look like a model,  and out here killing homeless people. Smh
Can somebody answer the question is this a homegrown one or is this another Biden import
Who did this guy piss off 😒
So you post his face but call him a suspect 🤔  THIS HAS THE SMELL OF 🐟!
Damn is it April.. IKYFL.
A COWARD !!!! No Man.
This is wild he looks mad normal
Have a nice Xmas Mr Maceo.
Paused @ the 2:45 mark: that's exactly how you expect someone from Miami to look.   Signed, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Always nice to get a serial killer off the street.
Criminals looks different every time
A serial killer and a shining example of DACA! And here's DACA for you ladies and gentlemen of the liberal left.  Or shall I say gentlepersons HeShe, Xhe, can't- decide- what- gender-I-feel- today persons of the progressive liberal left.
Open borders! Open borders! Is there anyone left who still wants open borders? Look at what's slithering across the border.
Barely fits the definition of a serial killer but most likely he was just getting started. They always prey on the most vulnerable and tend to get away with it for much longer periods of time..... because no one cares about the voiceless and those left behind in our "civilized society." Stay safe out there my brothers and sisters!
Ladies, this is a prime example of "All that glitters is not gold," you might end up with a yellow clump of dirt.
A 1000 women are writing him letters right NOW! LOL!
I'm surprised no women is in the comments talking about how handsome and nice looking he is..you know how thirsty yall be
Just because they charged him doesn't mean it's true. News can say anything and get the people's stamp of approval
Wow, look so innocent
He really had/has fool alot of people just on his appearances along who would of ever thought his was killing people gotta be careful  because people ain't who they seems to be this is a prime example
Shark gay media
Makes sense though. That he would go after homeless people. Killers think because they’re homeless that no one will look for them. Homeless doesn’t mean family less.
When did Bruce Campbell become a news anchor?
Killing the homeless to become homeless 4EVER.
He does not look  like the stereotypical  serial killer. He looks like the type you would be proud to bring home to the family.  Geez...must have been a Crack baby.
So scary. I'm glad he's off the streets.
Humm atz just fucked up
dayum ...  he looks like a respectable fine young man 😳 id trust him ....  thats scary
We have a reeeeeeeally low bar for "serial killer" now, huh? Spree killers are NOT serial killers. Sensationalist headline bullshit yet again.
"It's not the fall that kills you, it's the landing" - Professor Moriarty (Sherlock Holmes)
The monsters are everywhere.
glad he's caught
That man thinks he's Patrick Bateman 👀💀
this wicked human being. why hurt those homeless people who don't alright have things.
lock him up forever n throw away the keys
People are watching to many movies and tv shows and playing video games. And think that everything they see on tv can be done in real life. This super idiot just threw away his whole life in less than a year.
He’s innocent according to the racist left. Along with that criminal truck driver in Colorado who incinerated four souls
Merry Christmas in Jail you deserved it.
Big Bubba and the boys are going to love him.
Suspected? Why would a responsible news network make an accusation before a trial? These networks are violating peoples civil liberties.
This is very disturbing…how long has he been doing this? Pure evil.
What??? This man is fine and he's going around killing??
Boy with them, undecover TED BUNDY looks,  B.E. T. he's done a lot of EVIL..facts
Be careful who you call friend.. facts
Wow! 25 yrs old and a serial killer. Folks be careful out here. Lord bless the victims families and let justice be served
Not gonna lie, anyone named Suarez, Lopez, Dominguez, Rodriguez, Hernandez, anything ez or es have, absolutely HAVE to be some sort of fucked up inbred beans. Think about how they can maintain history of namesakes? Who the fuck is breeding with who? Are there really like 6 names in their entire history books? How do they tell the difference? Which Lopez ran the country? General Hernandez from which century? I have a theory they only exist to live life like rats or laborers. I hate to say that but it genuinely does seem that way.
Who gets locked up for TRESSPASSING?!!!! What is the story behind that?!😱😱 Besides the murders, someone super wicked evil just got removed from society. Thank you officers!
Why would a man that good looking need to be a serial killer?
From when you say FREE KAY FLOCK...... That's a problem! Time and time again i see our young brothers making the same mistakes over small minded stuff. Only to lose a life by way of death or jail!  Starting a pot who??..... PLEASE! IF YOU DON'T HEAR, YOU MUST FEEL!!
Watch out for anyone that has that many selfies posted
Biden killed more
Hillary Clinton killed way more
Good work MPD.
Something ain't right
So this demon going around killing homeless people wtf did he think he was better than them what ever their circumstances were they are human beings so sorry for them they were already having it hard
Damn he fooled me🤔
Sick
That's crazy I'm sure he's done more look out of town crimes who knows.   He would've been killing more people escalation if they didn't catch him
How many decades of serial killer cases do we need to pass before the general public realizes the most dangerous amongst us are often the least suspecting? And that’s by the victimizers design. If you’re surprised, then you’re a mark lol wolves in sheeps clothing are lessons of nursery rhymes.
GAY BOY BENT OVER
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 Prayers for victims. 🙏 💜🙏
What? He doesn’t look like a killer! He was a really good boy, never no trouble👎oh, please
Dexter
Homeless don't have it tough enough already they've to worry about being murdered, attacked while they try to get some sleep in the cold.
The look in his eyes are unsettling. That alone is red flag
He looks older than 25.
so many comments about " love in prison " plz some one explain and what is with soap thing
Why he hated homeless people wtf
Yep he did it....
Wow Ladies pay attention
This man is not a killer, he is a good man who is a great realtor agent who just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time
Gutless
Im going to say this one time, BUNDY
(1) a killer has to have a MO. So he’s a strangler or stabber or shooter. They can evolve so it is possible. (2) if someone kills multiple people in the same day, it doesn’t make him a serial killer, makes him a spree killer / rampage killer. However you look at it, thankfully he’s behind bars. And In Florida he’ll prob get the needle. Adios muchacho
Don't really believe anything the police or mainstream media says anymore between covid, deep-state aka gangstalking, and everything else. They'll throw Crack on someone these days, take a picture, and say it was yours.
I think that by showing all of the pictures of this Monster,  it's an indication that people aren't who they portray themselves to be.  Looks are often times very deceiving.
Ummm yummy I mean disgusting
There's probably a grip of serial killers out right now
*checks race*  He’s just misguided and deserves freedom
Looks like a grindr killer
In the last days they will go from bad to worse!  All this wickedness is explained in the Bible it has already been written.  Rest In Peace to those who lost their lives.
Miami becoming the new Houston??
I tell you one thing. These real estate agents are sketchy as fuck. They taking people out left and right. Hello I am a real estate agent that tells me right there to get the fuck away from them. Lol
young  fit and attractive you wouldve never guessed it
So sad, The enemy is always present
wow and we suppose to trust😳
Everyone could be serial killer, you just have to realize your target.
Homeless Killer,Sharp with a smile,but God does not look on the outside,but in the inside for God knows the Heart of Man.
Next stop Mars please I'm done here.
I don't believe it so many people is sitting in jail for a crime they didn't commit need more than allegations from crooked ass police force they just want to get the crime supposedly solved
Too bad Dexter isn’t in Florida anymore
The bay harbor butcher
No doubt! After all, thats who democrats want in America,  serial killer's,  drug cartels,  and pedophiles.......people like themselves
He will be out of jail under the release the felons no bail act !!! Not to mention another black felon.
Luckily he didn’t get arrested in a blue state, he would be out of jail within the hour
I Samuel 16:7 (NIV) But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”Jeremiah 17:9 (NKJV), "The heart is deceitful above all things, And desperately wicked; Who can know it?
He is fine! He's going to be doing time!🙏😂😝😢
Great police work!!
And they will pamper and spoil him in prison, when they should execute him. He probably had life insurance on those homeless people
Very attractive and you certainly can't judge a book by its cover. I wonder what's his backstory or prior traumas? Nevertheless, it's no excuse for him to cause terror to other humans. In the meantime, sir...don't drop the soap. He's definitely gonna be someone's "plaything"....he did better taking his ownself out....RIP to the victims 🙏
Grows up in a primarily good area went to better schools then most of us who grew up in North Miami ,,comes from South Miami to kill those who are already  slowly dieing in the streets..sickness over comes you As a Human being.
Watch, some 4million psycho girls will petition for his release
ladies, look in to his eyes and tell me he isn't a clear and present danger ?  I avoid dudes like this simply based on his eyes
So he traded his life for the life of a criminal thug. Horrible logic and he is lucky to be in the USA where a punk like this gets clothes, fed and gets a shower because in the middle east or China he would suffer a severe punishable fate.
What ever happened to "Innocent until proven guilty"?
I wonder is he Antonio Maceo’s great grandson or something?
I bet everyone who purchased a home from him, are either thanking the Lord above, or probably with God.
good job law enforcement.
i guarantee, there is a satanic worshipping element here
Why kill homeless people for no reason? That’s crazy man.
Was he vaccinated?!
Patrick Bateman is real! 😱
It’s so sad to see people make this a race thing when it completely isn’t, the police are just doing their job and people like to completely ignore the good things that cops do whether they are white or not, god bless everyone and have a good day
Remember Ted Bundy, also a handsome ladies man. Being good looking, educated  and cultured just makes it easier to get close to people and gain their trust.
This dude isn't a serial killer.  He's just a murderer. Ted Bundy is a serial killer.
I'll take name their race for a hundred.
I need evidence/proof😒 I've watched PIGS pin all kinds of crimes on people.....it's what they do! So pardon me if I don't believe a word these lying, crooked, hypocritical, race soldiers have to say😑💯
A better world is coming! 😀😀 Jehovah God's Kingdom ruled by Christ Jesus will eliminate all crime, violence, and wickedness and restore the planet back to a paradise! Psalm 37:10,11,29 Ecc 1:4
Selling homes but killing the homeless 😩
Black Dexter
Why tf is he killing homeless people? 🤨🤔 just weird.
Oh he a handsome serial killer …… a mess
At first I was surprised, but Im not surprised, because anyone can put on a vibrant display, but internally, are very wicked.
🤔 The Real estate agent kills people that are unable to buy real estate !
Dummy just destroyed his life.
White rage looks strange.
THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PHOTO OF HIM AND THAT IS A MUGSHOT  NOT GLAMOUR SHOTS. VERY WEIRD.
A pretty boy in prison, not good.
Wow this man looks so smart, trustworthy and successful and the whole time he’s sick af. SMH praying for the victims
3 attempts of murder 1 death not exactly Hannibal.
It's because he's gay and hates it, so he goes after other gay men.
LITERALLY PATRICK BATEMAN IN AMERICAN PSYCHO
Oh my God where this world is going
I see. Youtube wants mindless well wishes, and religious rhetoric in the comments, but not truth in what drives the American psyche. In the end the motive is the same. Money.
Another white supremacist...the number 1 threat to America (just ask any 'elected' democrat).
Nothing but evil!!
I feel sorry for the victims and their families but also this boy’s family. Imagine what his Mom’s must be feeling right now. This is bad all round on so many levels.
We're all the victims black ⚫?
Now he can update all his media channels from prison. Don't you have the right to do so?
Wow good looking would have tricked me!
Looks can fool you.
The mayor of Miami looks like a serial killer
this guy looks like a hollywood villain...
Where is Dexter when we need him?
Oh just another hard-working immigrant who came over here because he was being oppressed at home b******* this is what we get we get the worst
Not a good day for real estate agents in Miami   One is arrested as a serial killer. And another is killed outside a home she was showing
Guilty until found innocent.  That's Amerikkka
How can a person be a serial killers in a couple of hours? smh
Why not show this damn monster in his orange prison jumpsuit why his model shots🤦😵💔😥
This is hard to believe, remember he is still innocent until proven guilty.
Tiktok=Chinese propaganda.  Wanna bet? I can dm you proof. Don’t fall for the blue or ride side propaganda , don’t fall for the American division. War is coming
I have ben homeless in the past and yes we all have to be really careful.
Social media creates introverted, sociopath, narcissistic killers.
Think there is one targeting Chicago expressways
He's 25 but look every bit a "sugary" 37 in the face
Ole Mr. Pretty Boy will go over quite well in The Florida State Penitentiary.
I wonder if this will be ignored by the National News outlets, like the immigrant who was murdering elderly women.
psychopaths are usually very successful and dont care about stepping on other people thats why theres so many on wall street/politicians etc.. what a waste of life.
Remember he's suspect for what ever reason . People act like they presented proof. The masses of people are easy to mind manipulate.
probably a psychopath based on how well put together his life was and i'm sure murdering the homeless in his mind was going to help him as a realtor
SERGEANT ROBERT JUSTIN ALFORD GREEN AT NELLIS AIR FORCE BASE WHERE ARE MY DAUGHTERS JAHMELA AND KAREE AND MY 7 GRANDCHILDREN..AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THEM..
A dam! Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde
Mr.Bateman
He must of lost a deal because the homeless people were living over there or close to there🥺🤔
Face of an angel. But he was the devil in disguise. Definitely scary. He wanted to come across as someone they could trust. I hope he gets what’s coming to him
the ted bundy of the present time
Smh where’s dexter when we need him
LORD THE ENEMY IS MAKING THEM FINER AND FINER HELP ME LORD TO REFRAIN FROM DESIRE LORD! GIVE ME DISCERNMENT AND AN EYE FOR YOUR CREATION LORD. GOD I KNOW YOU WERE WITH THE VICTIMS JUST BEFORE. BLESS THEIR SOULD PERSECUTE THAT DEMON.
He looks normal even nice
Monster
Okay so 2 murders and an attempted murder 2 of which were on the same night does not make him a serial killer!!! Please do not give this (alleged) POS ANY publicity and attention for his heinous actions!!!
He's an very evil vile wicked scrumbag. RIP To The Deceased Victims, I'm praying for a speedy recovery for the victims SMH 💔 My Condolences goes out to the families.
He’s not a serial killer purse’ just a muderer
Serial killers like pedophiles don't look a particular way but they both deserve the same. Death penalty
Dude thinks he's Patrick Bateman💀
The pretty ones be the most evil
He doesn’t look like a Serial killer but it’s 2021 so they look regular
gotta look at the eyes,eyes dont lie..... may be into the Organ rackets
So every picture of him is as a successful man living a peaceful life... It would be nice if victims of police violence got this type of treatment, but you do/waste it for a serial killer
This is so weird. Why was he killing homeless people??  Their has to be more to this story..
What a loser killing homeless people!!! Their homeless they have enough problems!!! Put him in a cell with Bubba!!!
Ha, notice all of the chicks on here losing their minds are the ones who stay single and couldn't get a man without paying for one. Ten years from now they'll still be single, alone, picking up dog shit and racking up the body count.
This is why I don’t trust anyone!! You never know who anyone is nowadays! So many crazy folks out here!
A cop that's a serial killer......really
He'll make it on the cover of GQ magazine for officer of the year with all of those pictures of himself.
Florida is BACK at it AGAIN!!
Sounds like of Victim of Mind Control
Mk ultra
I'm sure he's done this before These people are chameleons
He looks a lot older than 25, closer to 38, and he thinks he's so fine.  Lol  He'll be real fine in prison being someone's gf.
In the 70s my dad & I had an encounter w Elmer Wayne Henley & his partner David. In the early 80s my husband & I passed Henry Lee Lucas & Otis Toole on a crosswalk/sidewalk. Both times I was repulsed sensing extreme evil. This young man looks so nice & I'm sure he's charming. I bet he's able to cover his true nature. Scary & very sad. 😱
Narcissistic Psychopath comes to mind.
Bring back the noose and the firing squad. The economy is in the toilet because of democrats and we the tax payers are tired of paying for these pos to live in prison. Just take their lives and be done with them.
I blame these motherfucking tv shows mane
Why are you showing all these fashionable photos of the pyscho. Are you trying to get a bunch of "Ding Bat" women to bail him out? Or Hollywood to look him up?
Wonder if it’s really him
Omg...how horrible......
Give him a one way ticket to venice beach please
So his out here killing homeless people
Rest In Peace to all the victims
He will be very popular in prison.
25 years old wow so young it’s hideous how his mindset is set up it wasn’t that serious to murder just because.As a realtor I wonder if he’s killed any of his clients
Homeless though
He's killing homeless people? How low can you go? As if being homeless isn't bad enough already...what an asshole
Is he even an American?
Serial killer? Maybe I’m Confused, what classifies as a Serial killer? I didn’t think the # was 2?
Is he advertising for a modeling agency? 🙄🙃Just asking for a friend!!
He's not in the Hispano community
Wtf is this is photo shoot... Do bettet reporters
Scary how nice looking he is…he looks like he is a model of some sort….wtf 😳
One may smile, and smile, and be a villain and some that smile have in their hearts, I fear, millions of mischiefs.
He has the arrogant narcissist overly-full-of-himself look down pat.
God needs to purge this world of evil. I'm done.
CREEPY!
Was this his modeling picture portfolio! 🤦🏾‍♀️ WTH
So now we have Serial Killer influencers?
🔴LEGEND HAS IT THAT MR. SUAREZ WAS BRUTALLY GANG RAPED BY GRIMEY STINKY BUMS UNDER THE MIAMI BEACH BOARD WALK .....AND NOW HE SEEKS RETRIBUTION !! CHARLIE BRONSON STYLE !?!?!?😏😒😠😡🤬😵‍💫😵🥸
💥💥💥💥💥💥1 3.  Photo Slideshow..... Illuminati blaming (Framing ) this Gentleman ...I don't not believe the story at all .🔴🔴🔴
Just shows that killers are getting more efficient at hiding. Be careful out there.
Beautiful NIGHTMARE
Death Penalty i can press the Button!!!
There are many, many serial killers among us. So many have not been caught, especially since their victims are usually people who will go unnoticed.
Where's Dexter Morgan when you need him. He would've taken care of this real quick
That's one sexy serial killer. Also is it really so bad that he killed a bunch of homeless people? America clearly doesn't care about them so why shld we?
Thossupec5 seems to be living his best life while taking the lives of others. Help us Jesus
Dude could have been a model! How scary his looks probably made it easy for him to lure his victims in.
Now if stoled food  from a corner store to feed my kids they’ll use a pic of me from the Target kiosk 🥴.
Wow, ppl are crazy. This guy looks normal and successful. It is Florida though so you know how the ppl there are. Florida man strikes again
I wonder if he had the jab people wake up why don’t ya the world is going mad jab or no jab
Rumors are he was doing street justice
Look At the Devil... Showing up Looking Like A 3 course meal with Dessert. For Shame 🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤢🤢🤢🤢
That's the same reason Ted Bundy got away with killing so many people. He look like a nice guy
Looks like a Cuban traitor
💀😂 I was expecting some soft jazz music to start playing over this dang slideshow presentation.
If he can get a Republican jury he'll get off on self-defense.
Narcissists psychopath type. Wannabe wealth millionaire businessman.Most likely bi-sexual, short tempered lunatic.
Good ole fashion police work. Good job Detective lunch is on you LOL
Killing a homeless person?!?! That’s hella cold….unless they attack you or sumn.
It's really sad! That criminal is very nice looking.
John 3:16 (KJV)  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
i bet American phyco is his favorite movie.
Looks like someone is going to enjoy him in the jail house pretty soon!!!
Will the last American to evacuate Miami please bring the flag.
For salvation, we just need to follow the way they did it in Acts? They were baptized in water for the removal of sins and filled with the Holy Ghost. Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.  If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled and rising again from the dead. That's what Acts 2:38 is.   We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man, be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD.   We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:6-9, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed.   One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans. Our salvation has to match up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away.  Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.   The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us.  The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38.   The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church.   It's better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction.   Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.   Don't get Titus 3:5 mixed up with James 2:14-26, about WORKS. One is a WORK of your OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR GOOD DEEDS and the other is a WORK OF FAITH OR OBEDIENCE TO GOD. One is letting you know that there are no Works we could have done to make Christ want to die on the cross for us. Romans 5:8, But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.  The other is about believing and being obedient to God because you believe.  Faith without WORKS OR OBEYING GOD IS DEAD. James 2:14-26.  Noah believed and then OBEYED OR WENT TO WORK BUILDING THE ARK.  Now that Christ already paid the full price for our salvation we have to attain it by obeying his way to receive it, Acts 2:38! There is no sinner's prayer. Nowhere in the bible in this church age does it state to accept the Lord Jesus as your saviour and you are saved. Mark 16:16, he that believes and is baptized shall be saved. FAITH WITHOUT OBEDIENCE TO GOD WILL BE IN VAIN. God bless you...
This man watched American Psycho one too many times.
police are legalized criminals.  they know
jussie part dew
So a horny producer put these shots together. All of them, because one or  two would not suffice.
What a POS!! They need him to get the needle. J&J is acceptable too
if he was killing women he would have gotten quite a few...the good the bad and the ugly!!! he would have gotten women just out of curiosity cause even if women werent interested, they might have gone on at least one date with him.
Tax statements?
Wow a serial killer i would 😳 not have ever thought that the devil is busy
Creepy because you see a handsome well mannered, respectful, genuine looking guy.
My deepest condolences 🙏 ☹️
Does this guy work in the stock photo industry?
Let this Killer go !!!. Don't spar his life other wise the taxpayers are going to have to pay the price !!!.
Charge the parents also...
So, a realtor is going around killing homeless people? So. Flo. never ceases to amaze...
A Florida man......
Black men would call him a HIGH VALUE MAN! Keven Samuels would call him a HIGH VALUE MAN.
A lot of simp in the comments
Many thanks to one of you females out there someone broke this man💔and turn Willy Maceo into Miami Serial Killer
Wow
I always tell people “ all criminals don’t have tattoos nor look like criminals” especially killers, their nice and persuasive. I forgot who said this “ looks can kill”
Reminds me of Andrew Cunanon.
Wonder what evidence they have. Judging by the report it sounds like he’s already been made guilty without a trial.
Is he gay? Perhaps he was attacked by a homeless man or men, and now targets them all? Or maybe I just watch too many movies😏 ; strange to Target men who are already at their lowest point in life .... Sick sick World we live in.🇬🇧UK
Thank God that De Santis is the Gov..they don't have a revolving door with criminals
What makes it a serial-killing because that is a series of killings that AR perform the exact same way or at the same time
So horrible! A go fund me page should be made for the homeless victim that is in the hospital right now. If he survives he should never be homeless again. God bless him and all the other victims and their families.
When will people learn the body & brain are two separate things not to mention the thousands of connections we have up there. Just because ones wired to success,cleanliness etc doesnt mean another wire can't be connected to deception,lies,and killing.ijs 🤷
✊🏿Black Lives Matter✊🏽 all black people are innocent.
Second serial killer this week that defies the usual description.
Miami is America's sewer.
Evil hope he gets the death penalty if convicted.
He has black soulless eyes, freaky!
People Just Because They Look Good ,CHURCH  People  Murder People 🤔😮
I've been homeless and this is why you have to really be careful where you decide to sleep. And where you decide to hangout.  This is not something new. You can't trust anyone.
Bay harbor butcher 😂
Is the network promoting him or something? He's been presented like a model then a serial killer.
Why ya showing all these photos of him
DAVID Eugene K'JOHN BACHUS QUINTANA
The eyes tell you everything.
Where’s Dexter Morgan when you need him to take out the trash
Wow 😯 I don’t understand why he was murdering people in the 1st place but to be murdering homeless people is beyond me 😔some people are really, really sick
KILLER??? he too Zesty!
I hope they have the right guy. I don’t believe, or trust anything that the police 👮‍♀️ say
It’s Florida, are u really surprised? I’m not
It this is proven true for the record: Talk about day & night!
What I want to know is who has he killed because they BELIEVE he is a serial killer but who has he killed, how many, come on I want facts. 🤔
Clearly a psychopath.
"He Loves Fast Cars And Crypto Currency" ..... Now he's going to Love Fast  flushing,  Noisy Industrial Strength Cell toilets And weekly  Rotating Crypto Dessert Offerings with his Quad- Sectioned Meal tray.
Hiding in plain sight.  Very scary!!
Death sentence!
A real life Dexter?
Nothing they said makes him a serial killer but it sounds like he was on his way to being one
With his pretty boy looks, he'll be quite the catch in prison.
Real estate agents are narcissists
What the heck was he  exterminating. the homeless , who made him, think he's better than ANYONE WHERE THEY WAITING for you in  prison pretty boy
Its darkness in those eyes i got goosebumps 😕
Awesome catch
He’s eyes look weird and empty
DAMN! LOOKS CAN BE SOOO DECEIVING! O~WELL, I HOPE HE'S NOT VEGAN BECAUSE IF HE ENDS UP IN PRISON...🤫😏🍆
This is weird, no mugshot🤔 who did he piss off. This is mad sus.
Isn’t a fatal stabbing murder as well??🤷🏻‍♀️
Dang the serial killers are getting  more  normal looking than ever , dont have that crazy look anymore . Surprise most of his victims aren't women the way he look he can lure them easily. So sad .
Wow look at him 🚩😭
Lol they gonna rally for this guy’s freedom like they did the whiteboy earlier this year?
Whew Chile he would’ve made a KILLING on dating apps 😩😩 but if he did that he needs life.
More like the gayest  serial  killer   Him or Jeffrey dulhmer
Ted Bundy was classified as handsome, so don't judge a book by it's cover.
He looks a bit lgbtq
Always the cute ones that the crazy ones 😭😫😭
Holy shit, this guy does not look at all like a serial killer… be aware of your surroundings.
Let me introduce Mr. Suarez to my little friend,  Mr. Sparky-the electric chair.
Innocent until proven guilty
says "suspected", there's a 10% chance he's innocent
All it takes to commit crime,harm,acts of inimicus  is a 💔 broken, filled with vanity, as well as hubris .Not a look.The person who attacks the homeless  , assumes that these individuals have no value to to society.Nobody who would care.He has been ru  -in by his ego,the rhetoric of this society.🧠🤥😶🤕💦
Says lot about a country, culture and society which produce most serial killers.
Look at the eyes
Looking at his profile...he looks like the kind of guy who hates those he considers failures or low lifes!!!
It’s always in the eyes. I don’t care how cute they may be, those eyes speak volumes of “dead inside”. His demeanor screams “zesty”
Well that's clear as mud.  He killed one person and is a serial killer?  Any info on the victims?
His exes are not surprised.
wow otro de  cuba? OMG!
Damn he had it in for homeless people
does not superise me
I hook up with this guy for money lord Jesus
Such a handsome man such a shame.
criminal history Means nothing. look at Ted Bundy.
Actually he was in real estate, liked fast cars and was into crypto. Sounds like he has psychopathic tendencies to me
Crazy, he is clean cut and nicely dressed.  How could he be a serial killer?
Successful and killing homeless people. Dudes screams psycho.
That's not a serial killer
🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️ Shocking u mean  Unbelievable 😶😶😶😶😳😳😳😳
Never JUDGE the BOOK by its COLOR. The HEART of a PERSON DETERMINE who they are. He MADE a DEAL with  his FATHER the DEVIL, to SACRIFICING HUMAN BEING to ACHIEVE the THINGS of the WORLD 🌎. He MADE his BED in HELL FIRE. MY heart goes out to family and friends who lost 💔 ones
Apparently serial has been downgraded to two
https://youtu.be/jRqwpmyciQI Can’t really blame the guy just the other day I was thinking while watching mine hunter why can’t there be a hobo serial killer seriously they are infesting our cities chicago looks like a third world country and trust me I come from one and they don’t look anywhere near as the garbage you call homeless here in the states  Fuck I hate homeless too lol and with the rise of them filthy fuckers hobos  I’m surprised not more people have tried to kill These pieces of Shit homeless infesting our cities and you can’t blame This Man for trying to clean our streets up homeless drug addicts are becoming a true problem to this country and I know A LOT OF you will Agree!

Not surprised at all.
They showed 13 pictures of this man completely insane .
Wow! 25 yrs old and a serial killer. Folks be careful out here. Lord bless the victims families and let justice be served 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
What does this fool have against the homeless? Geez!
Social media is just creating more and more narcissistic psychopaths. 😲😲😲
The only thing missing was music, and you would've had a slideshow.
Well I guess they can’t say it’s white people who do this anymore!!’
I would bet that he sacrificed the victims for more wealth.
I guess to him homeless people don't count, God bless us all
This guy is going to be someone's gal pal in prison. Looks like a chick already.
2 homeless people were murdered a few years ago sleeping below the metro rail. Shot in the head when they were sleeping. That’s immediately what I thought about when I read the article.
Why is this a montage of all his Instagram photos??  edit: FB photos
Wow he looks normal!  I guess ?
Bet he started this when he was much younger.
One of the most successful serial killers of last century was a highly accolladed University Professor. Did everyone forget that too?
RIP to the victims! 🙏🏾❤ Smh this guy should be looked at thoroughly because I bet he's been doing this for years and he's going after men he could be luring men on gay sites as well! Also, they are showing the multiple pictures because he maybe on multiple sites some are with eyeglasses. I think showing multiple pictures is appropriate in this case.
WOW!!
He should have got caught in California he would get out no problem
For sure he is a buttpirate narcissist. looks like Smollete!
So it was target practice for this Latino/Black/White creep?
Job‬ ‭24:13-20‬ ‭NLT *Wicked people rebel against the light. They refuse to acknowledge its ways or stay in its paths. The murderer rises in the early dawn to kill the poor and needy; at night he is a thief. The adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, ‘No one will see me then.’ He hides his face so no one will know him. Thieves break into houses at night and sleep in the daytime. They are not acquainted with the light. The black night is their morning. They ally themselves with the terrors of the darkness. “But they disappear like foam down a river. Everything they own is cursed, and they are afraid to enter their own vineyards. The grave consumes sinners just as drought and heat consume snow. Their own mothers will forget them. Maggots will find them sweet to eat. No one will remember them. Wicked people are broken like a tree in the storm.*  ‭‭‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭17:5‬ ‭NLT‬‬ *Those who mock the poor insult their Maker; those who rejoice at the misfortune of others will be punished.*
What A Waste
If the judge will just not give out a decent low bond. He needs to be held without bond or at least 1 million cash assurity. Not just some 10 percent.
A rich guy serial killing homeless people. Why does that make so much sense to me.
Soon as I saw his face, I wanted to write him. And Ask him why did he kill Those poor homeless people smfh predator tf and he look like my crazy ex husband who is in jail for murder. He is looking for me but I'm on the run. Please ladies don't trust these kind of men. They are the worst, I tell ya
Allegedly. He's an alleged serial killer. You never know, maybe he was just returning some videotapes.
DIABOLICAL DEMON👿, That is the WORST mistake you have ever made in your life........You touched the wrong one's!!!!! VENGENANCE IS OUR FATHER'S!!! Trust and believe his WRATH upon you is on it's way GUARANTEED!!!!!!!
Why are we seeing his face like this how about show the face of the heros or the victims
"fired from the car without even getting out".....how rude of him.
*A real estate agent* think about it
Sad. The fine ones are always the locos. What a waste.
That’s not a serial killer. That’s a domestic terrorist.
Just goes to show, you CANT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER...
Satan masquerades as an angel of light.
Definitely can't determine what people can or will not do to even jeopardize even there own wealth .I know people that straight despise people that isn't as fortunate,  I stopped even thinking to acknowledging that peace of crap person  . I figured they would grow in life to fix that dam sickness because it's a personal sickness that's all about greed for power , money , and attention . And this serial killer suspects looks like he also may have a problem with his identity as a man . He's like a "Chip and Dale aserial Killer" . Going after people that can't much take him and work that hate up out of him an see what he's working with .
FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! 😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪
Wtf
Three people in a couple months, God knows how many other’s!
Deport his ass.
Wow all that handsomeness and intelligence gone right down the toilet. Sad. Rip for the victims.
Where is Dexter?
The devil comes in all shapes, colors, and sizes!!!!!
Well we don’t know if he did it he deserves a fair trial
why do u keep showing his frickin face?
This reminds me of the grinder killer
Holy SPIRIT, THANK YOU!
me know he a batty boy
Have some of you been sleeping under a rock? Serial killers aren't all grim reaper looking...majority of them are very unassming. Ted Bundy, Gacy, etc..
Bet he supports BLM?
Why did he do these murders?
What is the evidence 🤔
Dexter??
Throw him in Gen pop
Damn he foine 😬
Well he's fanna make a cute girlfriend for his jail mates..
Why they showing his model pictures
He is quite the model........
I thought of Dexter when I saw the heading.
They going to love him in prison.  Welcome him well boys
25 and a serial murderer. Please get every bit of 1 million years
He’s a spree killer not a serial killer
No serial killer would like crypto currency, fast cars and real estate. 😐
i thought they didn't gradeate till they were 30?
WTF 😳
He thinks these unhoused men have no value, as if he is better than. So glad they caught him.
AMERICAN PSYCHO -The Movie! Same - killed homeless men & obsessed with beauty! NARSSASIST!
To the reporter it is the best way to end the year to capture a potential or the real deal serial killer
evil has many faces!
They’re going to love him in prison 🥰
Next thing you know this guy will have a modeling contract and a billionaire baby mama. They're gonna nickname this guy Hot Serial Killer and he'll get hundreds if not thousands of marriage proposals while he sits in jail.
I hope y’all keep that enthusiasm with WT people!
He’s pretty!  He will have a lot of boyfriends in jail!
Can we get a mugshot vs. his personal picture portfolio for this alleged murder
Pretty boy better don’t drop the soap
Death penalty!🧙‍♂️
Serial killer ?? A bit of a stretch more like thrill killer
He's a psychopath. Vain, arrogant, and angry. Yuck!
Lol I read the title totally wrong. I thought it said, they arrested a cop for being a serial killer
There was a serial killer in Vegas a few years ago. He was killing homeless men too. He would shoot them when they where sleeping. Maybe Vegas has the wrong guy.
Peal back his skin and you the devil👺 son , his nice smile hid a Monster👿. 🙏Prayers for those killed and there family now let  the law and Justice handle this fool
Wicked.
Man was he killing people for the devil? Like human sacrifice? For his life style? Why would he kill homeless people? I wonder if he fell for all those conspiracy theories about that stuff? Wierd.
seems to be the ones with the shy eyes.
Just another stellar member of his community and people getting persecuted by White Supremacists I'm sure.
I wonder how long it will be before the charges are somehow associated with racism?
Looks like Kyne west.
Never would have thought this guy was a serial killer.
Listen at this point I don't give a damn WTF they look like. Get all these criminals off the streets. Especially if he's a serial killer.
We should be looking at the victims pictures not the photos shoot of the killer🤦🏽‍♀️.
Dead eyes. 😱
Hes a coward..killing the homeless some of the most vulnerable people.
Black lives Matter Murderer!!! Lives do matter. But Not for all.
Dude looks homosexual. I feel like the producer that created that PowerPoint presentation of all his pics might be too 😂
Wow, he looks like the clean cut all American guy. The marrying kind. I just realized I'm seriously a bad judge of character.
This man looks like a model and appears to have everything going for him too...I'm just so shocked!😲
Pandemic rolls around and suddenly we're back in 1982
Some people go corrupt when money comes into there life this is one of them... U don't own everything just cus u got money
I'd like to make a comment, but I have to return some video tapes.
He looks like a bowl of fruit loops.
👹....EVIL
He probably was battling demons that we don't know about, we are in a spiritual War . tomorrow not gauranteed to none of us 🤦🤔
He said murder and stabbing fatality.  So 2 deaths then. Come on report like you researched.
Who cares?
He look like the same dude that was killing women on a date site
Ooooh he cute!! He can't be no killer! ☺
Promoting his Instagram or what? Any other time it's just a mug shot
Sounds like “American Psycho.” Christian Bale killed homeless people.
Sounds like he don't  have a criminal history  again Sh t Show!!!  It is clearly something else going on!!!  We are calling it out!!!  I DON'T BELIEVE THEIR NARRATIVE!!!
Gotta keep the strap everybody suspect 💯
Well I guess the police will lose their job for not taking him through the driiv-thru on the way to jail
Damn he really hates Homeless people
He was just mattering
The editor clearly likes how he looks
lifeless eyes. pitch black.
Cue the weirdo fan club
Crazy thing is there’s a lot more mfs like him out there. Ticking time bombs.
Actual Serial killers are cringing right now . This guy looks like a fuckboy . 🤦🏻‍♀️
All these photos like they want us to add him on our Facebook something
on the next episode of Florida Man...
mix that with this pandemic..they killing all over..all we have to do is return to GOD, and REPENT !!!
Someone in the newsroom has a crush on this monster...wth is up with all those pictures?? We just need one.
I'm a guy and see no reason to judge a guy appearance. I love ladies, anyone can be a killer. Maybe I'm one😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
its a hate crime HES a RICH guy thats HATES POOR people , simple what other cxonnection
Wow. This man does not appear to be dangerous at all to me....This is odd. I guess looks are deceiving.
I hope they have the right person. The motive makes no sense.
Fit and Fresh
Just judging by photos, Total Narcissist.
So it was just a rich dude that hated poors?
This man gorgeous 😍 😩😩😩
It feels like he sent is his own slideshow and asked if they could use one of these as his mugshot. And then they just used them all. Just smiling into the sunset with a glass of white wine. WTF?
That yougman was a business man why would he kill HOMELESS PEOPLE??? 🐶🐕🦮🐕‍🦺&🐴🐎!!!!
Clearly this guy doesn’t like homeless people..
good lord that's crazy
Patrick Bate...mang
Geez, I wouldn't be afraid of that man if I walked past him in a dark alley. One would think that someone who's living large, such as this guy, wouldn't risk it all to kill homeless people. I hope, if this all turns out to be true, he spends the rest of his life in prison. They may be homeless, but they're still human.
They are showing this man portfolio & sh**
Another 🐕🐶🦮🐕‍🦺&🐴🐎 POOP SHOW!!  This sounds like bull shit and it sounds like JEALOUSY!!He just said what it was we don't  after a person how they look.  Another 🐶🐕🦮 & 🐴🐎 POOP SHOW!!!
So he's mad that' he's Gay??!!
Monsters aren't always scary looking..
What is he trying to do clean the homeless out the streets 😤
a little too much bile in the system.  it is great for physical fitness and success, but can be  dangerous if you have too much of it.
woow!
So he would go take his frustrations out on the most vulnerable. So many broken people in this world. It seemed 🤔 like he had his head screwed on right, but he has a sickness. I'm glad they caught him. He may have never stopped otherwise. It was turning into a ritual.
Killer Smile 🤔🤔🤔
Sargent: "Police are trained to focus on  behavior..not what the person looks like☺"  Officers: 😳😬🤥
This is all a mistake. I know him he is a great RE agent. He returns calls
Death penalty
Am I missing something because he's NOT nice looking!!! 🤔 This dudes face is lopsided and he looks slow!!! I see why some you end up in fucked up relationships, y'all think anything is cute!!! 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Let’s go Brandon 💪
He looks like a total poseur.
Is this a News report or a PowerPoint presentation for the William Morris Agency?? 😂😂😂
picked on a weak population, what a predator.
He’s like the black Ted Bundy
But, of course you can judge a book by it's cover! I know, because I've read a lot of books.
Miami Dade county is off the chain
Suspect fake
Might want to look into see if he's the person that randomly stabbed a homeless man in the neck while sleeping on the train I think it's in the same area
Damn they got his entire FB photo collection 😂
Serial killer? Ted Bundy, John Gacey, BTK, the Zodiac Killer and Son of Sam were serial killers! This guy is some nutcase who hated homeless people. Try again, this serial killer narrative is stupidity at its best.
Americas taliban are all over.. They are going to love him in prison..
He better bring out the killer in the pen. Theirs gonna be booty warriors waiting.
Willy Suarez on them yass pills
Damn he fine. I'd be deaaaddd
Why    he    target    homeless  people    he    a    very    sicko  man  all    that     money    crypto    real estate   agent    people   are   losing  there     mind    it    only    going   to  get    worse    sorry   to  say  that
IN MY VIEW I believe there are some wealthy people that believe they are invincible because money has bought them EVERYTHING.
There's just no crime out there that his kind doesn't do.
"that subtle off white coloring, my god! it even has a watermark"
He'll be someone's babe in prison..
When looks are "LITERALLY" deceiving 😒
so is it hate crimes or since he isnt a straight white christian male is it just a misunderstanding
Our country has deep issues that are ignored!!! And we judge other countries
The black Patrick Bateman
He'll fit just fine where he's going
I’m sorry, but what a waste of Good looks.. So sad what he doing… Demons
That’s impossible just ask Al or Jessie, there aren’t any black serial killers and never has been. Fake News. 😂😂😂
Pat Bateman reincarnated.
American Psycho 3?
They have two serial killers in Houston three in Atlanta and upwards of 5 in Chicago
Only California's know this from kroq FLORIDA????????
How many photos of this guy do you need?! Wtf is this.
Point of the pictures, at least what I got out of it, surmises the notion of wolves in sheep's clothing.. Dude seems very successful, what reason would anyone believe he would throw away that life and randomly murder? Well this man did just that.

"Ye shall know them by their fruits." Matthew 7:16
Looks are deceiving.  !

Yo they arrested that man out of pure hatred for the color of his skin.
The darkness strikes again 💩

Send him back to the other side of the fence.

Handsome man... Look a lil gay to me .  I hope he's not the serial killer .  Because if he is, what a waste of life .  R.I.P. to the victims & i hope the man in the hospital survives .
He's nice looking.
Wow Florida your worse every day!
Stabbing is up close and personal. He is enraged . I wonder why?
Let me guess racists…he’s black too.
He wanna be wealthy so bad and hated poor people thats your motive.
Was this the guys modeling commercial? This news channel are sick pieces of shit.
Oh my 😮
Criminals in uniforms, like police.
So, I think by Florida law, serial killer status is when you’ve murdered 6 or more people. Can media or LE please confirm?
Really police don’t go by look
Play boy is going to have a very WHITE Christmas all over his chin in the prison system😂
This is literally a copy of Patrick Bateman from American psycho.he killed homeless men and had obsession with beauty. Also white collar work. Perfect fit.
WTH is this? News or glamour shots?
Men are angry out here

State Prison awaits this looser .
He looks like he plays for the other team..He'll like jail.
Now let me hear the "jogger" comments on this one. 🙄😒 He's not black.
