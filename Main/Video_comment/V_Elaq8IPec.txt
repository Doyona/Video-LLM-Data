Well done George, always good to listen to and very diplomatic.
Boots bad back delayed weight anything else anybody wants to add hang over late night flu watched films all night fucksake come on man😂 😂😂
Wrong boots on delayed blah blah blah if he had won do you think smith would of said anything about that no re group come back again for the 3rd fight
Conor Benn should retire
This was the right pundit that Sky employed. The guy that’s been there and done it all. Seems like a top bloke also.
Conor Benn looks entitled and nasty in interviews.
The should be a a weight class for all the drug cheats would be brill tbh watching them against each other benn on meth vs eubank on crack would pay.more to watch it aswell
Give a rest man
Groves' plugs are lookin tite AF!
Spot on, regarding the boots!
Grove kept it clean ✊🏿 respect
Benn should not be allowed to attend boxing events full stop until he owns his sh…it. However, where’s the deterrent if Miller is allowed to fight.
"🙄.... we'll see" Brilliant 😂 love Grovesy
If you headbutt a fighter, then follow it up with a punch and it’ll be legal.
Conor Benn is an angry man, why’s he trying to take the limelight from another fighters win
Or it’s all set up and now they have another trilogy to promote…  If you paid me a few million I’d let someone knock me out
What a performance, smith was mocking  Eubank throughout the build up,plus all the pressure on his shoulders, to come back, in a manner like that shows true heart determination ,while staying completely humble. IMO smiths excuses after the fight were not called for,it almost seemed like he was trying to take something away from the Eubank win,but Eubank still stayed humble. With his new team and from that performance, I can see Eubank having a real chance of winning  a belt. Well done mate!!!
Smith listing injuries and excuses like he’s sitting in Birkenhead dole office.
Looks like Jake Lamotta
I’ve always ever said the Groves jab was absolute world class!
My man Groves is reverse ageing. He looks 10 years younger than when we won the Brittish over 10 years ago!
George always speaks the truth without being biased. His giggle when he heard Benn said he would knock out Eubank in 4 rounds was funny. Cant beat groves, froch and peter fury if you want honesty from someone who really knows boxing
Great bloke is GG
big smith fan, but he looked old and slow against eubank, who isn't the fastest puncher, but credit to eubank, career best performance
Why did Smith have to drop 3 stone for the fight? I thought the rematch was on his terms...
Love listening to George
In fairness to Jr, he won every round before he got caught in the first fight so maybe he did just get clipped
Eubank should fight Charlo next. This fight i believe he wins. Thats after cabelo fight him
ben drug cheat should pipe down      eubank -benn yes at 160 - 168    easy night for eubank
Should Chris box Billy joe Saunders?
Its simple really.... Chris done what he shoulda/woulda done in the first, if Bomack had been in the corner. In fact anyone else in his corner rather than Fuckin Roy Jones. Fare play Chris 👍
Pretty clear Smith was on 10% All the rainbow crowd can have their day, but nothing for Eubank to gloat about, that’s for sure.
fix that shite intro graphic
come on all set up for a trilogy from day 1, business and money took over, fixed
You was wrong mate! Biased rubbish! Lost respect for you Groves! Add your mate Froch! & Nelson! Speak the truth in future boys! No fundamentals!!!
Nice guy george.
Towel?
The tie ups were a BIG DIFFERENCE. He clearly worked on that heavily. Lets see what eubank has got. Unfortunately, i think he is just in for the money fights and not a world title. He will laugh and walk away into the sunset after his next 2-3 fights
Top bloke is groves
This combo with Eubank n bomack different 🔥🔥
Great lad George. Honest intelligent no nonsense.
It was the weight loss and messing about with Conor Benn plus a lucky punch/elbow, everyone was shocked, came in tonight and destroyed smith like we all expected in fight 1. Well done Chris you were on fire 🔥
I always thought the hi tops looked cooler than the lows, particularly on the taller fighters
I like George. Good knowledge, articulate and balanced opinion.
Euwank can call out anyone, as long as the opponent has no arms! Then he would struggle to a points win. 😂😂
Conner Ben should be next.
George Groves. Respect to him in abundance, legend. 😊
Brilliant breakdown with inside knowledge 👌
George is so worth listening too. Calm and measured.
Anyone with eyes could see Liam not fit for the fight. Fight postponed numerous times and he Took massive rematch cash. No idea what to make of  Eubank until he fights someone good his own weight.
Everyone said jnr had no chance and it would be the same result groves said that froch said that and he proved them all wrong
Always great to hear George’s opinion.
Benn can talk all he wants but he needs to get himself a licence to fight first ! They announced that he was innocent but we haven't seen one little bit of evidence have we ? I'm sure if I had been wrongly accused of cheating id be shouting it from the rooftops and showing And shoving my paperwork down all the doubters throats ? He hasn't and he's gone all quiet about it hoping it will be forgot about and swept under the carpet ! For me Conor Benn is still a cheat ! Show me otherwise ! 👍🥊🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
The only guy who is always fair, direct, honest etc when it comes to analysis Eubenk, I guess because he knows the man
Bent arms, least it wasn't bent legs 🤔
Ennis causing problems 😆 🤣 😂
Kinda funny that Smith was calling Eubank Jr an excuse maker and now he has them coming out of his ear's.
BEEFY GOT ALL STEWED UP😂
George is one of the better boxing pundits out there today.   Comes with some fresh views.
Groves is a class act. Affable and knowledgeable in equal measure.🥊.x
Eubanks is superior
Groves … classy after his history with Chris!
The main man in boxing, imo no lies in  him nothing but respect x
Damage control for Liam’s arrogance 🤣
Anytime an interviewer trys to get George involved in someone elses beef, he sidesteps it. Man just wants a quiet life.
How about Liam really was and is a dirty fighter? Is it that hard to believe?
Great explanation
The lucky punch / elbow in the first fight has much more credence and traction now, after watching that phenomenal performance, he practically won every single round and 3 knockdowns until he stopped Liam in the 10th!
All of a sudden Smith has an injury  😂😂 give credit to eubank he fought a perfect fight
Just lining up excuses to then justify a trilogy so both boxers can create an 'angle' to sell the same fight to a clueless public. Wake up to the boxing business, folks.
How the hell did grove grow his hair?
Got to respect groves only says his truth .
Eubank did a number on Smith tonight. Not interested in sore ankles or bad backs. If you decide you are fit enough to get in that ring I don't want to hear excuses afterwards. Well done Eubank.
im not sure if that hair transplant suits george
Remember when groves bossed eubank. Groves easily the best Eubank faced.
Dave Allen was completely gassed
Liam should’ve really moved the head more. Trying to sit behind the high guard has been bad for him before
I have NO desire to see Benn fight anybody ever
George with hair just throws me everytime lol...the mans hard as nails but dumb as a bag of frogs.....
Chris was dominant in the 3 rounds first first and smith got lucky . This fight he did the same but played smart . Well done chris
I can’t believe how many of these so called UK 🇬🇧 boxing experts got it wrong??? They should all retire from journalism now because they are absolutely hopeless 😂😂
Chris did his homework for this fight. Chose his shots well and tied up Smith whenever he felt danger. That's a good blueprint on how to beat Smith right there.
Liam got a lucky elbow in the first fight. Hes a dirty fighter always hitting behind the head too
Liam elbow excuses smith got his minge destroyed 😂😂😂😂
Eubank broke down Liam round by round. Great performance 👏
coner benn couldnt knock out a wank in 4 rds
The tying up was the most impressive thing for me even though you hate to see it
George is world class and so honest its brill.
Groves looking better than ever no homo
Eubank Jnr owned Smith. This injury is a lame excuses I picked Eubank Jnr to stop him late.
Lol…Eubank was bossing the first fight ..then the elbow. Great display for Eubanks ..congrats 🎉
nothing wrong with his movement  or ankle in the public workout. Smith got proper spanked. Great job Eubank jr!
Perfect from George “ I will knock Eubank in 4 rounds “ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 George have the perfect reply “ we’ll see “ Conor has to say these things but let’s compare who has fought at what level who has won what and who have fought better level opponents Benn gets stopped
