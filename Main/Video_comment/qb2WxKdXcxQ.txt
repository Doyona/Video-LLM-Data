That final piece is beautiful. Great job to the artist Naïla Opiangah.

I hate dat this didn't make the album
This song was there with me when I got scammed out of money and an apartment in Berlin. I remember sitting in the hostel bathroom crying with nowhere to go. I was afraid that my dream of living in Berlin was about to be cut short. And I listened to this song and prayed. Everyday as I darted around Berlin trying to find a place to live I listened to this song. "Do your thing child" there are going to be struggles and the world is going to try and keep you down. But trust in the process, God, vibes whatever you believe and you do your thing.  Within ten days and through the help of my friends and family who honestly emobodied God in this world I was able to find a place and settle in to Berlin for a semester.  So thankyou Chance for giving me a song to keep going through that time and many more
I have this song and a few others added & arranged from Star Line on my channel. To me, it makes a strong album float all that more special.
Should have been on the album 🤦🏾‍♂️
University Of South Alabama! Mobile, Alabama! Waiting On My Job Coach! Jobless 2025

CHANCE✍️🐐
Chance stick to this, we need more of this
Chance is one of the most potent poets in the game, dawg. Like, top tier pen game. Top 5-10 ever.
Beautifulness ❤❤❤❤
Just an humble french funk & blues & jazz & reggae offline outsider discovering himself in the love story of Chance. Keep the faith up, dude, you rock the world of brokenhearts the right uplifting way.
Listening cause life is 😭
I mostly listen to punk rock. Never really dug much rap. But This song is so beautiful. Every time I listen it gives me the feels.
No  matter how  it is  do your  things of love from  God
Thank you for this

Chance is so beautiful
2025 still here
Being talked down
I don't like rap but I can actually understand what he's saying and great lyrics.
Of course the artist that's what caught my eye
The great love of power
beautiful visual and audio art. blessed
Reminder to us
I need to know cuz I don't know why that's a terrible feeling
I am hurting about my nephew very much
Is about to drive me insane
Stop hurting them babies
It's not nobody fault
Who rules the power
Got to remember
I wish nothing upon nobody
It's broken my heart about my nephew Darrell Brookings
Repeating you do your thing child
I am so thankful you oh don't know
You boys protected me
And I'm thankful
It's great to know your background
It don't matter pull up with the silline miss
I’ve never felt so seen thru a rap song in my life.
Jesus Christ surely is king🎉❤
Child of GOD
2024???❤
It’s interesting that what Jesus puts forth is in the sermon on the mount coincides with elements of this message.   “… Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done…” includes this message to the extent that “doing your thing…” aligns with doing His thing. Which is accurately summarized as LOVE GOD & LOVE OTHERS. This is truly freedom and it is living our best life. It is not inhibited it is directed by a transcendent purpose that produces the best possible outcomes.

someone should use this and have all gold medalist highlights 🥺🥺
3:06 the instrumental grew feet and started dancing too
On a flight going to do the biggest thing I ever did in my life. I wake up everyday and seek God! Keep doing ya thing !
turn to Jesus Christ he loves all of us more than anything and he literally died for us. He took in the punishment for our sins thru  on the cross. It wasn’t cuz we deserved it, but cuz he loved us. 1 John 4:10 “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins” it was thru his love that he died for us and we can be forgiven

Hoping a Kanye and Chance collab for Donda 3...
IGH
The Art & the Words are both beautiful Love Chance, He is the best man of his time.....
Praise God Chance and thank you so much for this track.  I'm 25 now and I've been a fan of yours for a long time. I, as well as many of your fans, listened to your music and learned your lyrics during crucial developmental stages (ages 15-25). I will speak for myself, but I'm sure many of your fans feel this way when I say that I am so grateful for your Christian influence.  I hope that you will continue following God and spreading the truth in these uncertain times. And I hope that you give an honest and sincere ear to celebrities and influencers like Ye and Nicholas J. Fuentes.
Love this 🙏🏽 chance is genuine soul
THIS JUST PUT A LIGHT IN MY DAY! And I already woke up feeling Great..  At least I thought I did.. But sometimes We can't See what We're Going Thru While we're In It until it hits Rock Bottom... And I'm nowhere near Rock Bottom right now... But there's obviously Still a DARK SPIRIT that Exists.. Because THIS SONG really just SHINED A PECULIAR LIGHT!  THAT'S REAL MUSIC!
I had to sit down after “leave your plans in man’s hands and it gets manhandled.” Wow.

The world should've capsized/ when God got baptized. Sheeeeeeesh

Beautiful piece of art
You don’t know how many men in Chicago told me to go to your high school Open Mics and ask out a Chicago Highschool girl and marry her. They told me to.
I will never marry an US women or support your bigotry. I will never return to the United States and will go against your whole country!!
For someone uneducated that’s reps Troy. Knowing I saw him in college In Chicago and never worked with a lot of kids at CCC. Troy never worked with educated people he worked with chance at CCC. Chance reps being a child of God never marrying a women In a church for how much GoD he preaches all the time. Never followed or supported this man or his beliefs at all never supported his religious bigotry and racism of the United States
Please keep the kids smart 🖤 we’ve been dumb enough for too long
Thank you.
I appreciate this man. Sharing his blessing like this.
I ever make it big, this who I'm rocking with. Real Recognize Real 💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥
We need more
The next Chance album is going to be fire all his 2022 singles are on point
I love how all these loop in together. Chance is so talented, a man of god, and a great lyricist.
❤❤
Ya we need to work together.
This is everything I want. And more.
This is beautiful music
Do your thing child
Man...Chance is a diamond 💎.
God his good
Amén god bless

Hey chance, if it's about I'm a free man then I'm gonna free manifestation if it's about freedom then I'm gonna rule in free domination if I got free will then I will as a please have at all 3 of these.   I will do my thing.   Thanks to you an a shout an a Thanks to juice  Cuz guess who's back 😂   I'm here.... We're here I do it for my neighbor if I got his back I hope they have mine.

Oh the humor 😂
You hear what you want in these lyrics, but Leave your plans in man's hands, and it gets manhandled
“roasted for they clothes or they emotions or they roaches, bullied by they friends or they mamas or they coaches” real life
You know my sister got killed in april and this song was played at her funeral.such a beautiful song...i just hate to cryeverytime hear it.i pray to heal one day
Beautiful 🙌🏾🔥
Very special ❤️🫡
That ahh scared me in beginning im ngl lol i didnt think he was gonna do it on this 🤣🤣
i love this flow ! i wish i could listen to this with my dad
I swear he gonna make me religious.
I wanted to say thank you Chance, The Coloring Book was my first time hearing you and it really moved me and made so positive and caring. After that I was continued to Deal With my Highs and Lows and I just lost faith. Recently I’ve been trying to find my way spiritually and “ Child of GOD” & “Highs and Lows” brought me the same feeling from when I was (17 now 23). You enlighten me and the rest of us Children Of God 🫶🏾☀️🙏🏾 Love You Chance!!

Have you been away from the industry
uberman (IQ=186+)
that's the chance we knew & loved ... much love from Accra 🇬🇭 Ghana
Exceptional !!! ✊🏾
I need help!! I’m trying to find a song that Chance does solo about him and his brother growing up. I saw him solo on screen, I think the background was white or light grey.
Beautiful
That "first day the first time" line is so inspiring! Chance rappin rappin!
i love listening this song
This is Poetry. LOVE
Your gods are dead, not my Mama preachers cut down. I see her husbands create in her who lives. Where is your god you have claimed Mama's wombs and earth with? Spiritual warfare cause Mama's was given the highest place. Not men.
Sounding like Chance coming back to redeem himself after The Big Day, I’m expecting him to come back with an amazing album and absolute bangers 🔥🔥🔥🙏 ❤️
This album is helping me so much right now. Thank you for making beautiful music. We appreciate you my guy🌈 🙌
❤️🙏
Thank you, Lord, for sending this talented man to speak humble paths to you.
Thank you Jesus CHRIST for your mercy and your grace! 🤍
You have my love and respect 🫡. I stay off you bc of your truth knowledge and flow. These rappers coming today…. Can’t elevate to this.  Your word play is the killer
Im 4 months too late but we are here
Masterpiece
Big Ups
This artist painter 🎨 has a thing. 👌👍🏾
do you guys know some songs like this please
I’ve been missing Chance🥹🤎
When you leave your plans with man it gets manhandled 🌄
Prayin for chance. 🐐 fr. Kinda weird that a whole fan base can turn on u when ur down
can someone get this song outta my head😭
This is a vibe, chance has no bad songs
Well written rap but the message is off. A child of God does what God says not what he/she/they wants or feels.
Yup
wow  that hook part really hits deep. we all remember that lil voice as a child telling us to believe in ourself no matter what. cant forget it gotta connect back to it.
This guy though!! POWERFUL... what a motivational and Inspirational song...the message i get here is that Have faith and believe in God and do what you gotta do freely and boldly.
This new Chance might be the biggest comeback since the Cavs.
No way I get it the room changes the more he grows
🎶🎶🎶My favorite jam
Drums sound too famous
I need a chance and gambino collab album. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏾🖤
As a true Chance fan. Everybody who said Chance fell off cuz of Big Day clearly didn't really listen to it. His bars nor his flow ever changed. Y'all jus be so quick to listen to wat the public say instead of actually listening to the album. Chance if u out there the Big Day was 🔥 🔥 nobody wanted to hear it cuz the media is pushing being hot n being single, not elevating and growing w a life time partner. 💪🏿💪🏿 I always knew u never went nowhere bro 💯💯
I love this!  Only his story that only he can tell!! Keep doing your thing Chance
We need a tobi nwigwe x chance feature
“Grow up to be saviors, surgeons, rabbis. The world should’ve capsized when god got baptized” gets me every time.
Beautiful song 🎵
He really said “Leave your plans in mans hands and it gets manhandled” that shi was HARD
NICE HAND WRITING
All I got to say is ✊🏾 much ❤ brother
Weak
At every corner stores, bodega delicatessen Stands a big head kid learning delicate lessons

This what the world has been needing. Definitely God’s Child. Salute to the seeds you are planting. Dope
this song is pretty boring.  why is no one calling it how it is
Go back to acid rap or coloring book chance
This is beautiful!
Bro it was saying “we gon be aight”
Fantastic song
This is really good really like it keep going so another goodie
That beat cool
AWESOME NAMASTE KING CHANCE  Actually brought me to tears touch my soul🙏🙏🙏
When you here that ad lib the chance we all love is back
this is gonna be the most lyrical album of the decade so far
2013-14 chano vibes 🔥🔥
Saw that you repping the flag.  All the love from the motherland
10 years ago this would've been a hit for sure. We ain't on this vibe no more though... just the truth.
Thank you for this, for real
Hope this is lead up to an album, i need more of this
DO YA THANG CHILLLYYYDDD
who here after helloyassine?
This is whack
Family Matters cordae type vibes
Got chills when he started rapping😌
Gives me Common vibes 🔥
This has the vibes of me walking to school and listening to 10 day. Chance is in his bag.
very nice thinly veiled attempt by chance to trap light in that painting by repeating some old lines from the notebooks, good news, it worked, i bet that painting will look nice in the home of anybody with good taste, very nice, come to era we don't trust jesus, 8===3~
Cool song!
Beautifully done ✔️
Better
My dude you are spitting litteral fire
WE ARE THE WORLD WE ARE GOD'S CHILDREN GOD FIRST ALWAYS Y'ALL TENNESSEE SAYING
So xari chance..this internet got me late for this
i'm going to start doing my thing. thank you chance for this gem.
how is this man looking YOUNGER ??
give way Chance a ring for his use of them basketball references
🇬🇭 flag on the jeans. This reminds of the old Chance.
Love it
I love it, so poetically awesome! Content 💯.
god speaking
WE LOVE YOU CHANCE I BEEN A FAN SINCE THE FIRST DROP!! DROP AGAIN BRO, DO YOUR THANG!!!
Powerful
I will 🙏🏼💯🔥🔥
No matter what happens to chance he always seems to be there to give us the chance we deserve BRAVO ON THIS ONE BROTHER WE LOVE YOU!!
the "igh" at the beginning 😭💓 missed this guy
Good work, Chano. It feels like 2010 again. Now we just need some Lil B
Wow I admire how chill this song is
Needed, thx Chance Always ✊🏾
Inspirational beautiful message
the duality between music & art!
Keep up the good work, mate! You're really talented in what you're doing
this somebody who’s spoken through
Not impressed lyrics are corny, and not constructed very well
The more they hate the stronger we get.   During europes dark ages Alkebulan was in a golden age.  We’ve learned ALOT over the last several hundred years & it’s exciting watching us coming out of dormancy.✌🏾💚✊🏾
Message yes lyrics 👎
The world should've capsized when God got baptized. Repent of your sins and your forefathers sins and get baptized. Let the holy spirit in family. That was the day my life got better
So much has been going on I wasn’t even aware chance was still dropping music
Ight then!
There are no more beautiful words left. He used ‘em all. 👏🏾👏🏾
*This Song touches my soul, we humans Don't deserve a Second chance but Jesus Died for all of us (John 3:16) and I still don't understand why he did what he did for us, we humans can be the most worst.... But there still is beauty in this Dark World. Thank you Chance for bring Jesus back & rebuilding that bridge I destroyed, that Relationship that will always be self improving as I grow as a human, Mentally & Spiritually.*
This is music for the soul 🔥🔥
Loving this type of sounds he's dropping atm
💣💣💥💥🔂
That second verse brought tears to my eyes… being able to relate to something so well just hits different
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽😇
Really amazing song, and that painting! ❤
Mural is GORGEOUS
Hey. Thank You.  The Korean. 1982.  Truck Norris.  AA
🔥❤️🔥❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
the video quality is crazy
I knew this would snap when I heard "igh" . I'm so glad that God is using Chance with a spin on his original sound. The sound I fell in love with almost a decade ago.
Going through an abomination of a situation.  Lord bless a doubtful
i love my wife
Hey chance ur music has really inspired me growing up I was really poor I didn't have good parents my mother was bipolar and dad was never there so that has impacted on my life but I put that in the music I write and I think I got potential and I promise I'll get the same rhyme set and knowledge as you I promise
The overall quality of this video is amazing to say the least. omfg!!!
CHANCE YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT NISHA & JODIE REACTING TO THIS THEY REALLY FELT THIS --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43s8OvIxRvo
Oh but I AM who I AM they knew before I grew trying to cut down this tree that is me nothing can stop him he is my Father and those who don't believe are nothing but a bother... So I'ma keep on reaching and keep on teaching there is no fear for he who made me made my path clear 🙏🤲🌻
🙏🤲🗝️ from my own heart ☝️💗
Great song and video and canvas.
This song is truly a masterpiece. An album composed of songs like this would be amazing.
The flow and delivery is special.
He never disappoints
Been waiting on this chance to comeback

I play this everyday , the kids in my environment bully me for being different and this gives me tons of strength to keep going . You are amazing chance . Never stop making records

Do your things ไอชาย
I say this from the bottom of my heart while it might seem that what this man is saying is true it is not. One can not mix in falsehood with truth and call it truth. Furthermore, a true man of God does not walk in boastful manner nor does he speak in that way either. It is not good to cover arrogance with a sliver of humility. Man needs the spirit of truth to lead him to the correct spirit without it we can distinguish between error and truth. Unfortunately, Chance is doing more glorifying of himself rather than glorifying God or Jesus.  Every man has his journey and stumbles trust me I get it but being in open rebellion does not get anyone closer to Christ. A man of God should exhibit the fruits of the spirit if anyone reads this comment please also take the time to read this verse. Ephesians 5: 1-7 1Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 2And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.  3But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 4Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 5For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.   6Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 7Be not ye therefore partakers with them.  May the Lord bless you Chance. Please do not take this as an attack rather as a fellow brother in Christ who simply wants to see you get closer your creator. Much love and God bless! May all who read this also be one step closer to Christ!
Thank you chance God bless you
Man's like a fine wine
Sound like an NBA Playoffs commercial
You a legend in my eyes for this song 💯🔥‼️

Thank god for this man
I swear this is getting black balled
Chance, thank you 🙏❤
A WHOLE BUNCH OF BLACK

Hey Chance, I'm glad to see that you are back. I'm glad to see that even though the big day was hated you still continued to move forward. God bless you brother.

This be bringin tears to my eyes one day fam one day I'll change the World we stand on today!🤍🤌🏼☀️✨💎🌌🏔️🌎🧘🏽💎🗣️🔥
The true return of one of the greatest creatives of our modern day in age. Such a clever and beautiful video, paired with some amazing lyrics packed with emotion. Love you Chance, I'm glad to see you put out something so great again. One Love.
wonderful chance :)
"How many times have you played this?"  Me: Yes.
The world should have capsized when God got baptized..... How did you even think that 🤔 Mate you have a delicate mind
This makes me want to make good music
I hope the Whole album isn’t represented by this necessarily. I thought it was nice, but you guys have to remember artists take The best songs from their album and releases them as singles. Not a fantastic place to start us
This is one of favorite songs of all time ❤️❤️🇬🇭
Great,  but the lord is not about swearing
More like this Chaaance!!!
Chance doesn't need a comeback, he is one. The power of his artistic expressions are more than his last hit.  Love this powerful message 💜👏❤
The lyrics 🥺🥺🥺
Chance is preaching in this one! Straight fire!
Not a lot of songs make me cry
Love the song, love the painting more. Anyone know the artist?
❤
❣️
This song is effing AMAZING!
💫💕💎😎
Yeeeesssss come back with more please more like this edifying the children
🌺 p̲r̲o̲m̲o̲s̲m̲
love it❤❤❤❤
This young man is a bright one. Keep going young bruh
🌼🤍🌼🤍Hiiii cutttiiieee pieesss!!!!!!!🌼🤍🌼🤍
Beautiful music
Chance has a way of being absolutely true to the expression of his faith without feeling exclusionary to people who don't share his faith. What a beautiful thing.
i hope he proves everybody wrong with this comeback album
A rich man the size of the needle that the camel fits… wow. Yes you are chance
It’s crazy how much an artist can make an impact on your life just from a song. Chance you are the best man. Got me through some tough times. Keep being you!
Beautiful, creative, inspirational !
Hop over to see Chance’s interview on the Stephen Colbert Show 4/11/2022. He also performs this song. Headed to iTunes now 🙃🥰

1:55 🇬🇭 Ghana♥️
This is nice chance
WE SEE YOU CHANCE
Thank´s from a Child of God to a Child of God.
Nice song Thanks for reppin the motherland 🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
Seems somwhere between Common and Kanye, Chano doin big things this year 🔥🔥
Amen.
Please keep bringing the them chance keep them coming
Great song, seeing chance mature as an artist is fantastic. what he needs is a album produced by kanye because i feel like they chemistry is together and that will put chance back at the top
I hear yuu 🖤
Ooh I’m love my wife I love my wife aahh
Brings me back to acid rap…. love this!
this song is perfect
I've been listening to Chance since high school. His music has always hit me in ways no other artist has, weather I'm lost ,happy or sad  even when I'm needing hype. His words reach points that nobody in my lifetime have. I remember the first song I had heard was juice, and back then I just thought he is a great artist but through the years every song and album. I can just lose myself in the lyrics. At times I find myself just bobbing and dancing around uncontrollably. He is a different breed man and I hope he is as happy with what he's done to help people as we are that he's here. -Thank you.
we need you to make more music chance the world needs it keep it up
Chance is back
So beautiful 💥great lyrics
Inspiration my Dawg …. Keep pushin an i will too.
There’s the chance I love. The real.
This song was my validation to keep going.. following God’s purpose on my life
please do some acid and get us trippy
This is powerful
"That thing hit"
I had to come back to experience the greatness of God thru Chance ❤️
🤲🏿❤️
elevator music
🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
something unique Sana
My Ghanaian Brother . Nice music I see the Flag on your jeans mahn
That visual with the generic notebook, water bottle, and Cheeto bags got me. 😭   Normal guy writing from his heart with his God given gift. So freaking good. 🔥
dope
I'll do my thing brow
Thank you for the lyric vidéo i will sing it AT a karaoke i was looking for this kind of song maybe i will sing it to my wedding too telling my nephew to carry on and "do your thing child"
We all agree this is just as cringe as The Big Day right?
With all the hooplah out there, it's heartwarming to know there are a few rappers out there that speak highly of the Lord's name and not afraid to show it.  Blessings to all 💯🙏
I hope the painting went well
#chancetherapper 🐐🐐🐐
🤖🌞💟💟💟💟💟💟💟🌞🤖
And We Back!!!
i have missed you!
Wonderful
Thank You For this Timeless edifying piece of art... Definitely invoked true emotions and healing  All glory be to God I pray that God also uses me through my gifts.. I know He loves it best when they come unwrapped on display for all to see and is always best when we know who it comes from which is Him. May I never lose sight of purpose may I never lose sight of the true plans despite of all the pain and the pressures may I never forget who we Are. We are the children of God.  #DoYoThangchild
He giving me Common vibes with this one
Chance is back

chances music makes my heart smile thank you chance
certified chancellor classic.
Omg did I just see my country Ghana flag on his trouser's ...
Chance never really fell off he just became independent which big Record labels don’t like.
Nobody does it like chance. His passion and love for what he does is unmatched.
I LOVE YOU 🎧🎶🐉🌎😎
Was let go of my job…walked out the building and sat in my car. I decided to go on Spotify and play “new music” to get my mind busy. This song came up and Sat in the car for two hours with it on repeat. Definitely needed this, I believe it was a sign for sure
so very dope
Reminds me of Chace ol' mixtapes and the joint with Noname. 🙏🏾
🙏
Chance I really love you 🇹🇬🇹🇬🇹🇬🇹🇬
mid, better than the big day tho (which aint a high bar to beat)
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️💯🙏

I lost my whole family to a school of sharks in Miami last month.  My girlfriend was eaten as well. This song is getting me through it all❤️ I love you Chance

This world will make you second guess your first mind…truer words have never been spoken. Listen to the voice and do your thing child. Thank you Chance👊🏾
This . I love this new flow ...real awakening 💯
I felt this to the core! Every word.  My mama a would be soo proud of me the way I've handled the hate and especially how I respond to adversity but she wouldn't be surprised by it. Niether is God! One love chance. ❤

THIS IS SO SO SOSOSOSOSOSOSOSO DOPPEEEEEEEEE
@feb Dmac.
I really liked the big day album and felt moved by alot of the music but sometimes I felt like I was the only person that thought this way. This song helped me understand and accept that even if that is the case (which is probably not), then so be it, 'just do your thing' and perhaps the unique perspective can create something wonderful.
“And that’s why yo fkin album flopped”
The world should have capsized when God got baptized...lyricist!
Mellow Bars on a soulful instrumental, love it!
🎵just do your thing child🎵 cool 😎 song 🎶
I love it ❤️! You “did your thing” with this one Chance
This is tough! Need more great music like this 👍🏾💪🏾
Amen!!!!
Closest thing to old chance... smooth asl

💜
🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
We gonna act like this didnt just drop off the grid or.....
Had to raise my hands to this one. God use him. 🙌🙌
Chance isn't one of my favorite rappers. But he's easily one of my favorite poets to stumble onto a beat.
Much love!!!!!
wow
<3
It's my birthday today ... I wish everyone reading this a very prosperous 2022. May everything you are striving for come to fruition. Do Your Thing Child ♥️♥️♥️. Let's get what's ours.
You are works of art creating new art. #gratitude #love
Beautiful 🤩 video
Stop cursing Bruh..... Not needed and sends mixed signals.... Do you honor the Lord or not?.... Let your speech reflect it.
I tried to break shackles now their ankles in shambles😾😾🔥🔥🔥🔥
tyler the creator would smack on this‼️
Did you know that you can go to heaven for free? This one decision can change your eternity forever. Jesus died for both mine and your sins. All you have to do is confess that you’re a sinner and accept Jesus as your savior.
Imma Child of god
I hate his voice but love the video
The pen game>>>
🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭❤️❤️❤️
There’s no ways anyone thinks this is good
the picture don't have eyes and noses and lips!
Whew!!!!! this skin, child!!!!!! We see you!
Chance literally helps so many people with his music. This isn’t a song it’s a work of art.
IGH🤣
Been so long since actual good music came from chance. The recent ones giving me a bit of a progression from acid rap. Although he might not have anything that big
This vibe is the Chance we need more of. Very cool.
So inspirational and beautiful, i love this song
NEW ALBUM
He going Andre 3k on us
And we back
W
this flow feels similar to Jay Electronica, and i fw it
Looks like Chance just got his grove back
😪😪😪 not about the god stuff…. At least Kanye can make it entertaining.
It's giving Kota the Friend vibes. Love it!
Jesus is Christ,beliiieveee that!
The deeper meaning behind this song is something I truly could relate to. Thank you Chance !
Love this <3
I love being able to hear every word spoken. Every word should count. And he making em.
She killed that, and the Production was on point.
Saw the Ghana flag on his pants and I’m here to say we proud of u chance
I remember one time he said he doesnt mind if his albums flop. Because he know he can rap.   Something along those lines.
ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"Walking to Jesus With the Needle that the Camel Fits" What a Bar 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Do your thing Child 🚀🙌
So dope 🔥🔥👏
Straight poetry and gospel
Thank you Chance, this is dope ♥️ love it.
welcome back Chano ! Favorite artist ever !
"Gimme your ear like VanGough
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good wordplay and poetry on this 🔅

I look forward to Chance. I look forward to listen to what God has put on his heart to speak. I LOVE listening to chance talk about God. I love listening to our youth talk about God. This was dope af. The boat gone rock the ship won’t sink. And that’s facts. Thank you God for that.
I love it
Absolute heat.
Heard this track on hip-hop Nation, lyricism at its finest
This hard. We need more of this Chance, this the type of music that made his fan base so huge. 10 day type vibes fr
Thank you Chance For This Song Mannnnn This Is A Song Where You Can Feel Every Word In It And It Deep, It Give Me The Old School Vibes Where You Can Look Back When You Was A Child To Where You At Now In Life, And This Is Motivate Me Keep Going And Like Chance Said "Do Your Thing Child"  GOD Definitely Put It In Your Heart To Make This Song  Again Thank You

Kota The Friend type video
Came here for Moses sumney NGL
People please read the true historical truths of the Hebrew people. For from their bloodline did our Savior come and open that kingdom to us so that we too may love Israel.
I love this new video style you’ve been doing recently, it feels like we’re just kicking back chillin in your crib
Great
🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
The message in here is one the whole world needs to be reminded of. “Remember when it was YOUR first day YOUR first time?”  Humble yourselves.
so good
This is such a Gem 💎
✍🏾✍🏾😳🥺🥺  Profound 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think the song's good, but thinking about it from a message perspective, I guess it'll be a matter of time whether the meaning of this song means to "drown out the haters/criticism" and do what you think is good  speaking more plainly, I just feel like this song is saying chance dismisses why his last big album wasn't received that well, that he doesn't care about any criticism or anyone else's perspective/opinion.  it's not bad to be that way, but it feels, kinda arrogant a little bit.  but yeah, we'll see when the album comes out, just hope this is more a pick-me-up-after-getting-beat song
YES !!!!!!!
Essa música é linda 🔥🔥⬇⬇❤▶ https://youtu.be/WKQ0aYPmv3c
🗣🗣
This is golden 💥 the lyrics (Lay your plans in man's hands and it gets manhandled. Darn! that hit home!), the instrumental, the video; nothing short of a masterpiece! And @1:56 is the cherry on top! - he was repping Ghana, my motherland! Can't wait for the album!
fye!
bro i love chance so much. one of the greatest EVAH!
I’m so glad chance is back
Thanks Chance. ❤️
This crystal clear
Take some acid
Heard “Fandango” and “needle” in that first verse i was waiting for a Fantano bar 😂
🔥🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/u87kOh_oxjU
keep on grinding my brother
It’s always interesting to me how rappers who actually have something to say are the least supported. Chance is dope, doesn’t need a lot of hype, and loves God and his family. THAT needs no comeback, it never left.
❤‍🔥❕
convinced Chance showers and sleeps with a hat on
🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭♥️♥️♥️♥️
“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” —2 Corinthians 5:17
LOVE THE SONG AND VIDEO 😍😍😍😍
I loved the Emanuel Hansel line
Wow. Al Hamdu Allah
this hits to the soul
wowowoowoww
Nice work Chance👏 i like rhymes lines and words lyrics. Good message.
Shout Out to Naïla Opiangah for a beautiful art piece🎨❤️
The fact he likes his fans comments shows how much love he has for them😄
Chance raps are awesome, the melodies are top tier & that lady is a dime🤍. Do Your Thing Child!
This song got me thinking  I'm a shamed that I have so much pain there is people to blame however all that would do is cause more pain and then it would start to rain😢 I'm sooo thankful I'm a Child of God🌞💫
I love this song it's beautiful I am a child of God and he's whom I fear
Child of the tooth fairy
I love ChanceB3  his inspirational but like “everybody” say if he was single he’d be dropping albums we BEEN waiting for 🤷🏽‍♂️ 🙏🏽♾
welcome back chance , we missed you bro . it’s only up from here 777
I pray father God bring heaven to earth through the children of God. In Jesus name amen.
Do your thing!
Snappppeddddd!! This was amazing bro, good vibes
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 tht was amazing 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
The Big Day was awful and all. But why is this really great? He should really comeback right now
Imma do my thing Chance,  You do Your thing, Chance
You gotta love chance his lyrics is always artistic and abstractive but also very poetic as well. ❤
go find god
Also Ghana made it to 2022 World Cup in Qatar
I saw the Ghana flag on your jeans Chance, thanks for the shout out. I am Ghanaian. I needed that. It's nice to know you kept us close to you.
📹
Heart and tongue then this. He's back guys. He back.
Yes please move back to the Acid rap type music
Walking to Jesus with ma sandals wet
Walking to Jesus with ma sandals wet
The hardest part is I have more than one thing .. and finding the time as a mother who works over night sometimes brings me to sleepless days but it’s okay … cause I am indeed a child of god
its okay to like The Big Day. I know at least 3 people that liked it at first then switched up because of the loud opinions floating around. never mind, if something is fun and good then it is
Like the Lord, this song found me at just the right time. Thank you, Chance.
thank you, chance. i am so excited for this new direction in your sound, and this was a fantastic single to kick things off~
The message is clear in this song all the other raps songs have the same concept
Do your thing!! A classic chance
Lovely ! Great work !
🔥🔥🔥💪🏼
That final piece is beautiful. Great job to the artist Naïla Opiangah.
Proud to be ghanain
Fire
God bless Earth 🙏  from Armenia 🇦🇲 i like the song 🔥🔥🔥👍
I just get this vibe Chance feels at peace on this one. Absolutely love his energy forever and glad to hear how happy he sounds on this, in a very calm and collective tone. Love you man!
This is so dope , and the production is mind blowing , amazing work
“Bullied by their friends or they mamas or they coaches” THATS A BAR
I know no one will notice this but thank you. I don’t even know if I like the song that much. But I feel like things are looking up now.
Can we get Kanye on the remix
Just wanted to say thank you for being you and doing what you do!  regardless of what people may ever say you inspire and affect countless people and one day I hope to be in the position you are with my music too, thanks Chance🙏
This is beautiful 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man... I needed this like I can't even explain.
✨✨✨
I hope one day I can make something as amazing as this; knowing the context of how his last record was panned hard, and then you come out with this? A truly triumphant, personal  song that is as much a letter to the listener as it is to Chance himself. Thank you Chance
Hopefully he gets back Into his smooth, semi gospel, story telling bag like we were once used to
Flawless victory
Amazing 🙏🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽
Thats a nice painting.       Song was pretty good too.
I’ve been wondering where has Chance been the entire time
🔥
I nearly fell asleep
Beautiful video and song. Like self motivation grandma style.
all the time God is good and God is good all the time💯
Artwork is 🔥🔥
Listening to his style of lyricism(*) reminds me a lot of MF DOOM🙏🙏
I'm more impress that she had finished this in one day amazing
Sounds like chance from "Coloring Book"
why he sound like boogie in this, either way, dont hate it. just curious if its the same engineer.
Needed this jolt of lyricism to get me back to the studio…
igh
gospel rap is thrash
He's baaack. 👀
LOVE THIS FAM!!!!!!
Hallelujah
im happy you're back :)
No matter what some people may say about you Chance, just know *YOU ARE SPECIAL & GOD LOVES YOU!* Chance, you're a one of a kind artist, and the real ones appreciates what you're doing ✊🏾💙✌🏾🎨⛅
The start of this video is how my next 5 years are going to go..... Creatively....
💙✌🏾🎨⛅
da boy is back
The blessings Just Don't Stop. Hope you see this Chance. We'd love to collaborate with you with our God given power to create magic that pushes a generation forward.
good to know the big day was just a phase
So so good!

This is nice bro
Bringing the poetry back to rap
❤️
❤️
🔥🔥✍🏼
This song made Me quit smoking
Yessir 👏🏽
This brings me to tears every time I watch it. Moving, good for the soul. Naila, your art is beautiful, it's breathtaking. Thank you for sharing it with the world.
___--1:02--___ Matthew 19:24 King James Version 24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  It makes sense, if god decided that a camel would fit through the eye of a needle to enter heaven then it would.
i don't know why, but this song touched my heart. Chance, you're back.
😍
evidence that bullying works
Music to watch grass grow to. 😴 Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Mr wack
The big day was an amazing album
wow
Yeah he’s back with a vengeance. Killing them softly with this one…

Demmmmm🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This spoke to me... From the bottom of my heart, thank you, always.
How did this man make that trash ahh album?!? crazy next project needa be fye
Love his rhyme schemes
Feels like 2012 again. Bittersweet
Love from Ghana to you brav

THE BOOK IS BETTER
I have CHILLS. Chance did that, Naïla did that and the additional vocals from Moses were chef’s kiss 🔥
I still listen to 22 Offs daily
God bless all of you and your loved ones🙏🏻🙌🏻✝️
🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
TODAY (3/29) is the last day you can see this masterpiece in public for free.

A beautiful birthday gift, Chance. Always a blessing. Thank you.
Welcome Back Chance
This is incredible
Sheeeeeeeeesh
Chance really fell in love with Ghana 🇬🇭 when he visited. I guess he needed an inspiration and he found it in Africa. Praying for your comeback🙏🏾
POETRY
THIS IS THE ONE! HE'S BACK! 🐐
God bless you Chance
Is chance back😫😫
this hits
Dude we know you’re a satanist just like Kanye, jayz, Beyoncé (who’s on the Epstein flight logs), and the rest of them.
Naw.
This is exactly what I wanna do with my music. Rep God, love people, and make good songs. Great work!
Wow!!!!! Wow!!! Wow!!!
The heart and the tongue vibes🔥
As vezes a gente pensa que chegou o nosso fim, pensa que Deus n ver nossas lágrimas na madrugada.. Deus trabalha em silêncio! Pode ficar tranquilo(a) que essa ansiedade que está na sua mente ele vai tirar! Só basta termos fé!! ❤
If you guys want religous(christian) bars look up Oswin Benjamin.  On another note i dont really care to hear chance rap about religion but i thought this song was pretty good and the basketball parts were cool
Trash
Keep following God, proud of you chance 🌟❤️
thank you Chance!
🙏🏽
I respect this guy's lane of spirituality. Cause u Chance a lot of people won't Forget THAT God Loves em.
Shoutout to chance for repping my country Ghana🇬🇭🇬🇭💪
BARS🔥🔥🔥
Inspirational
Ya know as time goes on, it's going to be harder to discern what's of God and what isn't.  Let's just let chance be what he is and not categorize him as a Saint or Sinner yet
ily chance you changed my life
Thanks for putting the flag 🇬🇭 on the map... much respect man ✨👏🏾
No matter what.. in this world of distractions trying to steer us away from the true living God.. Jesus still did what he did.. and still remains till this day. Jesus is the only way. No matter what .
Chance’s growth is dope, not many artist grow as gracefully as chance 💯💯💯
This is beautiful 💖
I missed ya bro

Modern day poetry love this so much Chance thanks for making real music should I say real hip hop. 👑
world need this man
Yoooo Chance, this was beautiful brother! You're my fav artist. God bless you & your family to the fullest!
Moments don't pass they accumulate building on a masterpiece, the brilliance of a diamond in the cut. Sight created from carbons implosion Including Flaws in all perfection. The cosmic glue creating the strands  Of perception. Giving waves of energy rippling in every direction. Expansion of Gods receptors May the hidden gems be unearthed  to show the magnificent beauty God  desires existence to expirence. Im space walking in destiny, interstellar paradigms fixed on the vantage. Every direction advanced is north  exuding the vibes from the nexus A toast to being alive  I'm solarplexing. •Brian Marcus Burns•
The beat, bars and line delivery.. this really filled my soul. Glad you're back chance.
poo poo
When you take time off they say you fall off, came back and now you stand tall above all.
This is amazing, please make a comebavk chance!
Magic
🇳🇦🙏🏿🤍
Ok chance this is fire brother
Chance please go full israelite with the lyrics. Wake our people up these subliminals ain't clear enough for em
Love it 🔥🔥
The Big Day was amazing, and this has some of that plus an older 2013 feel to it, while combining some of his evolved wordplay(his wordplay was always good).When this album comes keep the hate, cause it’s gon be number 1💯
Can a have the colouring book II please chance🔥🙏
The mural tho..yasssss
If you like cool sounds swing by my page
beautiful bro
🔥🔥
And we back!
Oh man, I'm warming back up to Chance. I definitley didn't like the last album, but I'm never one to write anyone off just cus they made one thing I didn't like. This was just so nice and simple, but also gorgeous and calming. Keep doing making you love Chance, that's what matters!!
Utterly beautiful... ❤️✊🏾
Good poem
This world will make you second guess your first mind. 🥺🥺💔
This is lyracism on whole new level, ive never heard anything like this, like bro!?
did u know that he loves his wife?
This song was intended to inspire others and still u pray for or another while owning disbelief in your own success surely more success will come from you if u are the center of your work and all u see is poverty imagine what you would see if u were successful
Chance the contractor🤣
Straight bars
In a world of crazy, it brings me peace knowing people have the same thoughts and look at the world as I do... keep preaching the truth Chance, btw this music sounds beautiful to my ears
Took and Chance on Chance and was not disappointed. Well done my brother! This is what I needed. Even tho I was bullied and told I wouldn't mean much by my parent, classmates and coaches, God still allowed me to Do MY Thing! It's OK NOT TO BE OK!!
🔥🔥🔥

My boy is BACK! TGBTG
This was so lovely…..  I’m going through somethings and this was such a breath of fresh air. This is a reminder of so many things.  Thank you chance, greatly appreciated 🤎
i have high hopes for Chance's comeback with this new project
Amen!
I heard the criticism before I heard the song and now I realize a lot people just didn’t get the message.
DUDE this is so bad
Chance exploring this new flow and it’s the one 🤌

Not enough bars about lean and dogshit
Alright Chance i hear you!!
#DYTC!

This song came right when I needed it made me look at my entire life and reevaluate my relationship with god thank you man.
Chance still remains my role model, the world will discredit but he is still top
This Song was amazing and the female in the video was thick too 🤣🤦🏾‍♂️
Chance is back 🕊
Great song, great visuals and great painting 🖼❤️‍🔥
Amen to the name of Jesus thank you chance your music is forever part of my praise
finally. acid Rap
We wanted this type of music like 6 years ago. I always said, lyrically he's up there with the Lupe's. But he wanted the gimmicks.
Yayayayayaayayyayayayayay. Thank you lord
Beautiful... ❤❤❤
it feels like magic to hear this 🤤✨❤️
Doing my thang thanks for reminding me Chano you did yah thing with this one
Acid makes everybody good at painting.
I hope Chance truly does make a comeback. I haven’t always been a fan of his music, but I’ve always respected his insights and he seems like a very down to Earth dude despite the hate he gets. I actually enjoyed this one a lot!
Oh yea...this hit. Thank you🙏🏿
✊🏾😊
This track sounds like 10 Day in the best way. The earnest flow and wordplay really brings out what makes Chance unique and what made so many people fall in love with him to begin with. I still remember being at a party in Edgewater, putting that tape on and seeing the whole room start vibing to it. Looking forward to Chance 5.
Shout-outs to all of my impatient Oil Artists... I don't feel your pain 🤣
🤗☀️🐐☀️😇☀️😇🤗🤗😇😇🤗😇🤗😇🤗😇🤗😇🤗😇🤗😇😇🤗😇😇🤗😇🤗😇🤗😇🤗😇😇🤗😇🤗😇🤗😇😇🤗😇
Hi I’m Noname
Sure love to all child of God
Thank you!
Real
Meh. Nothing special.
Man I’m so glad Chance never quit rapping. It feels like he found his wings again.
This is Dope...somewhat puts me in the mindset of a modern version of common with this particular track...mostly bc of the cadence and clever lyricism! Keep Elevating and being unapologetically you...the authenticity and uniqueness is appreciated and needed!
Gon head and link with Ye again Chance!!! We need that holy energy
Childish Gambino singing on this would make heaven appear out of the skies.

anyone ever seen the south park where they become a christian music group?
ok chance spittin 😟
A lotta people wanna hear music like this the lane is wide open
Every song off the next album needs this level of writing. This the chance we love.
N YALL SAID THIS MAN WAS CORNY???
This is true art. Stirring. Moving. Layers of depth. Thank you for not settling Chance.
Sending Love from 🇬🇭❤❤❤❤
I got sumn too, Mr. Cory!!
Keep dropping bro, don't stop
This was refreshing.....
“They thought I had a manual like Hansel” omg that was nasty
Pretty good Chance! I liked the fatigues line I just thought that was intracate. I also spied the "doll eyes" they are very image driven so like. Doll eyes glass looks glossy even if you don't cry. You can't help that glazed over look in your eyes, the price of imitation, it leaves a lasting look that's vacant. Expression the same no matter the direction, stained lips and a smile that's complacent. I like word play also
Thank you Chance , lifted my spirit with this one while I'm dealing with this demon
“Never was there a path better cemented…”   Stellar track, 🤙, absolutely the truth! Thanks for all you do, brother!

Yo y’all gotta appreciate and realize..Chance Bennett Really raps. Like he really does. But he’s one of the few artists that remains to make you feel something past the audio and lyrics. It really hits the soul. He really be painting pictures. Hats off to you.
Wow! This really captures my attention! This is great!
This Got Be A Legendary Comeback For Chance !
I said it would be the best year in black music in a decade. The best is yet to come on 2022
This is the dopamine rush chance music usually give me

Beautiful.
Straight fire
No matter what others say, continue to be you Chance. Thank you for always giving us something to smile about :).
3 words:    Just So Different !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #saluteyoungking
Listening to this, I felt a similar vibe compared to what I felt when I heard Chance for the first time. I'm not saying that I feel like I'm listening to the same thing, I mean that I missed being amazed while listening to rap music and feeling that particular cadence that only comes with poetry, like rhymes: one wave at a time.
Pressed play just because it was there and didn't expect much from Chance, buuuuuut THIS 🔥🌊 LYRIIICS with soul track ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ Love. Bless.
Love thisss 🤩
Reminds me a Mac Miller flow style
BRO SPEAKING TRUTH ,NO NUDITY JUST POSITIVITY ✨

Exquisite word play and art 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
I usually enjoy Chance’s music, but this spoke to me on another level, I don’t know why but it gets to me. Underrated lyricism, keep doing your thing chance.
I need those pants , I’m a black star ⭐️!!!
I really think the break was needed. If we get a full album like this it’s a 10/10 for me
This gives me acid rap energy but without all the acid.  Love it m lol.
OMG!… “on G!”🥰 🎶🎶🎶🧘🏽‍♀️🖼  The motto is  the more those hate  the more doors prop  open 🙏🏽  Just do your thing Chance   🖤👁👁👁📓
Chance, thank you, it's crazy how much hate you get. You are a poet. Hip Hop purists are proud of you. praise the Lord. I know why they hate. We are loved by the most High. We just got to see it.
This is word. #HIPHOPMUSIC 🔥🔊🔥🔊🔥🔊🔥
Woooo, this and “The Heart and the Tongue”… pure artistry.
Woww. Great love from Ghana to you Bro. Keep soaring ❤️🇬🇭
I look at this as a sign because I was only last night thinking about “should I keep doing what I’m doing?” Questioning what I was really put on this earth to do. Thank you Chance for being you and putting out music for us.
Always Creative ¡ Chance
Chance and Ye the only ones that can make me feel this way
Just do your thing child 🙏🏻
👁☀👁☀👁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’ve been listening to Chance since the beginning, and it’s amazing how far he’s come and how he continues to push new boundaries with his art. Excited as always to see where he goes next!
Sonically beautiful glazed with inspiration. #doyourthangchild

An album of songs like this would be amazing!

Chance has been my favorite artists for years. Posters and everything. He has gotten me through so dark and negative times in my life.
this is also chi town music common? kanye,  Consequence , many more🔥🔥🔥
That Emmanuel Hansel bar go over heads

Same room as The Heart and the Tongue
Uma mão vai no volante e a outra no carinho
DO YA THANG CHILD!! THIS IS PURE!! You are amazing please keep doing you my man!!
I never comment on YouTube but this is real music.Unprompted, I was thinking how "Same drugs" is one of my favourites and now hearing this the next day.Beautiful music for the soul brother.All the way from Southern Africa 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
thank u
would be the greatest intro to an album
Hey chance I want to say thank you so much for showing me that there are still some holy people in this world I could still look up to and also get to hear about positive.
"Lord God Please make an Example"!
🧡🧡🧡💛💛💛💚💚💚
I needed this
Chi town legend
So many insta captions. Chance is so lyrically good at making you cry and change your whole mentality. One of our generational bests.
This is one of the best songs that I've heard in a long time
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
👁 🙌🏾🧘🏾‍♂️
New HEAT ; I Been Tuned In !!  https://youtu.be/PCqszmCPw2A https://youtu.be/jDPVyp6p-bY
Jesus my Love
The age in his voice is so Smokey. Very matured and rich. If you listen to acid rap to now he sounds just so grown ip
Beautiful
A RICH MAN, THE SIZE OF THE NIDDLE THAT THE CAMMEL FITS😱
Wow this is very beautiful
My goodness Mr. Bennett, this is an absolutely wonderful song. I heard it this morning on Pandora and didn't have time to listen. I got home and now i just want to play this song on repeat, now. You have been so influential to me and I love when you do songs like this: clever word play, unique flow, and positive messages. Just keep being positive and spreading good energy. Listening since 2015. Much love brother and may the blessings keep falling in your lap!
10 seconds in and it’s already a classic. He did the “IGH”  All jokes aside it’s nice to see a chance drop. This is pretty dope too. Probably among his best.
This is beautiful
Geeeeeeeeeez Chance, you’re moving like that this year?!!?!!! 🔥🔥
This is beautiful....
Hip Hop
!!!
Love it
Beautiful 🥺🤧
yes so excited for the new album even if its passable.
This is more than just a  music lyrics hit diffrent totally on fire
True artist
I’m  hereeeee❤️🖤❤️🖤
Igh!
This the one
This reminds me of the song he did with NoName: Israel🔥
Bless up Chance, your wordplay and music is 🔥but your love for God is what I find really special, God bless🙏🏾
I remember hearing him for the first time on his track Juice.. Maan he has grown
Fire!!! Just keep going! Dont listen to the haters!!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Does anyone know the name of the Colorway for the Jordan's the artist is wearing?
This album gonna be top teir
That's soul-nourishing PEACEPEACE BLESSINGS
WHO IS THE ARTIST?! BEAUTIFUL WORK !❤️❤️❤️

Chance in his bag like the fries are at the bottom! Can't wait to see if an album is dropping from him!
Let’s gooo Chanoooo!!!
He's back 💪🏿💪🏿
♥️
Smh 🤦‍♂️ aye joe budden what you talking about ..this goes smh should of played the whole thing before judging
i missed you man
🔥
Love you bro i simply love you and appreciate your marvelous work🖤🖤🖤
All words are actual and revealing. Continue following and strengthening your spirituality, Chance, and on your next album, I want to hear your singing voice as well.
This is so amazing
"Remember when it was your first day the first time."
This sounds different , I love it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
DOPE
He is the type of guy who we dont need to talk them to know they are kind or good. Im grateful you are coming back
🇬🇦
This is penmanship… but a bit of Homeboy Sandman DNA splicing going on.
Powerful 🙏🏼
Do your thing again chance.
This is literally everything.
Dude never fell off he just got real, and the industry and population don’t like real
AND WE BACK!
This is beautiful!
Perfect timing! I'm sick of hearing Nicki Minaj and other rappers building up satan kingdom.👈🏿🙌🏿🎤🙏🏾
This is ELITE
Intentional
Beautiful
I really love every word on this song 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Chance the 🐐 🖤💯
Oooo 🔥
This song is absolutely fire
beautiful song. love u chance <3
Rootin for ya dawg 🔥📈
This man really just going in
Powerful
His music never went bad, the message changed, the meaning behind each bar carried a little more weight. He’s still bringing that substance and back in a familiar sound from before, not what he experimented with. Taking risks isn’t corny. Whatever Chance puts out you can take something away from. You just gotta listen.
This man sounds like he’s seconds away falling asleep. No energy whatsoever
God bless you chance  This album is going to be epic
🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
beautiful
❤
This is really unique I haven’t heard another artist delivering lyrics like this In a very long time I thought the video was creative and unique
Thanks Chance….. I’ve been struggling in a major way. The Holy Ghost has His way of speaking at just the right time. Thanks for being a willing vessel!
I REALLY LOVED THIS  VIDEO....I LOVE THE POSITIVE  FORCIBLE  WORDS...I  LOVED SHOWING THE  ARTIST 🎨  DOING HER THING CHILD. BLESSINGS  AND PEACE ✌ ..1 CHRONICLES  4 : 9 -10
Always grateful
this is beautiful
You’re going to save some folks with this one Chance 💯🙏
Simply delivered
Sure thing Chance, I'll do that 🙏🏽 Thank you
很厉害
Give me your ear like Van Gogh🤯
Listen to Hymn For Weekend Lo-Fi mix at our channel :https://youtu.be/NsenBpgxleQ
Chance is high key sounding like Common
"a rich man: the size of the needle that the camel fit". Chance sized up the world in one lyric
I love how Chance used the same room from "The Heart & The Tongue¨ video to continue his story here👌🔥🔥
KAZAKHSTAN 🇰🇿
Chance is one of if not the most inspirational artist out there today. There are very few of his songs that I can listen to everyday. This song brought tears to my eyes. Thanks Chance for keepin my playlists hype since high school. Keep doin your thing
this song boring asf we need old chance
It's a bop
never ceases to amaze me
I’m always touched, motivated and learning by your rap skills brother God bless king! ❤️
I can hear Earl Sweatshirt on this
Much needed
😍🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gah dayum!
If you like Chance check out my new music video! https://youtu.be/ztwKD3RTaBc
Praise the lord. All glory to Jesus Christ. God put flesh on to die for our sins to reconcile us with the Father. Adopting us with the power of His blood.
Welcome back chance!
I’m so happy chance made “The Big Day” while I didn’t listen to much to it. It’s clear he had so much fun making it and wanted to make it. I’m happy he made it. But it’s nice to hear him put this out. This feels like 2013 checking SoundCloud to see if he uploaded something new. This still Holds the ideas he’s clearly passionate about, but makes me flash back to the first time I hear “sparring” or anything like it. I’m happy chance use living his life to the fullest.
All Glory to The Most High!!!!
I really like this one!
Thanks bro if you see this
I can’t stop listening to this song. I was not a fan of The Big Day but this song seems a lot more like Coloring Book, which was my favorite project of his. So glad he is back to being great.
Bj the Chicago kid at the end is crazy
I hope there’s an album coming 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Thanks Chance, this was beautiful
This is just beautiful
This is special stuff.
Prince of the Chi. King Ye
Amazing
Coming from someone who loves God and Basketball this song is perfect. The lines were perfectly fitting great job Chance God Bless

This is really bars y’all gotta open your eyes a lil 🔥
Yep. Another song I will listen to on repeat. Thank you Chance for hitting me in the feels.
🙏🏾🧡
🔥
This definitely has me ashamed of myself. I let the devil convince me I couldn't cuz I haven't, when God already showed me I was almost there. Fear and uncertainty have plagued my heart. Your music, always brings a tear to my eyes and smile in my stomach. Thank you.
Speaks directly to the soul.
oooooh myyyyy goddddd mr chance 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
This reminded me why I listened to Chance everyday in highschool
Point Made.

Welcome home chance
CHANCE NEVER MISSES ! 🤯🥰
💎💎💎💎
Songs with lessons are the best   "Do your thing child "
This comes right on time. Keep making good music 🎶
I wanna see this as a collection: heart and tongue, child of god, etc. they video style is amazing and I love learning the words
You can tell when he writes where it comes from. He's tapped in to the source and its beautiful to listen to.
Sounds so much like old COMMON.  So rad 🔥
can we talk about the young lady artist that painting was awe inspiring. especially since women's month. that picture of women holding each other up to reach their goal each one holding the other up to hold the next one up.
Golden work of Art ‼️
CHILDREN! 🖤LOVE FROM A FELLOW YOUTUBE ARTIST!❤️
I miss acid rap flow but I’ll take this

This spoke to me like no other song has. I really needed this
Impacted the mind frfr

SONG OF THE YEAR, CHANCE!
God bless you Chano.
dope
The boat don’t sink❤️
Everything Chance has released before and after The Big Day has been gold and nothing less. He's one of the most talented rappers of this generation and nobody can take that away from him.
Do your thing Chano🙌🏼📓
Chance has completely come back. His lyric and music make my mind straight back as I am getting fragile. Thank you Chance! pls keep doing your music.

Everything that you speak on for the Black community and especially Chicago is awe inspiring. We see all the love that you have to give and you have our support always even if it only helps on a minuscule scale. Keep doing what you’re doing, IGH.

I keep defending chance saying that he never fell off and that his music is still powerful with its messages I'm hoping that with every new song that he puts out more people will begin to understand that
Yessir Child of God do your ting 😇🙌🏿
Wordplay is crazy on this
this gives of "first world problems" vibes. that recording still NEEDS to be released
It’s crazy how 5+year ago, I have been a huge chano fan not knowing he’s gonna love my country this much. Fkn full circle type thing. I love it ❤️🇬🇭
"This world will make you second guess your first mind"

I'll never care how long I have to wait for music from Chance as long as it's consistently this quality of music and poetry. I love you so much Chance and so do so many. You handle the pressure of it all very well and your keep growing.  Most importantly, always remember to "Do YOUR Thing Child" :) Wonderful video too!
To God be the Glory
thank youZ
And definitely the side profile is doing it for me so hard 😫
This video smooth asl just like you Chance!!!!
Oh WOW,💯🔥🔥🔥
You let the greedy unfair drugs overpower your human mind when making decisions in its pressure like you're children to spirits getting pushed around and you do what you learn on repeat experience and think of what's best and blink on to a dream in a stream of the wind blows river windows and then soul pours spirit till its empty and then we reload and pour some more till we're poor decision makers maintaining slavery in pain temptation and temporary insanity to feel no pain like God in its name we take in vain then strain its contagion and connect chain effects to community neighbors.
We need a album chance. A good album, not that bs u released last time💯
chance pen game has always been insanely good
Mannn Chance didn’t have to go that hard. Why he always gotta slap like that??😩🔥🔥

Powerful message. Was waiting for a sign, and you showed up.
Yanno it’s crazy to me that I used to wake up at 5am just watch your juice music video when I was 13 y/o. It’s nice to see how you’ve grown over the years. And seeing how you’ve carried yourself since I’m happy to say I’ve looked up to you since back then. Keep doing your thing and please never change.
this hits on so many levels
I feel like this was the perfect way to return for Chance I just hope it gets promoted right
DO YOUR THING, CHANCE!  We must all keep going. Keep healing. Keep growing. 💖🧿💖
