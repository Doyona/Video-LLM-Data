Congratulations!!! Patiently waiting for the name reveal!!
OK you two cuties!!! Baby "B" is now over a week old! You are killing me!! Want to meet this sweetie and see how you two are doing!! Truly concerned though I know you two are in good hands.

Man I remember being so lonely having my baby. I was 18 and laboured for 20 hours I screamed the whole time in pain bc my dumb ass didn’t wants meds or epidural. My daughter was born around 2 am and I now have an almost one year old. My baby tore me sooo bad I couldn’t sit stand walk lay down for anything for almost a month. It’s just me and her but I’m okay with that. Congratulations ❤️❤️
Omg!! I’m so happy for you both. Good did such a great job girl! And to have the support from Eli is amazing. Congrats to the both of you. Your baby girl is beautiful. I couldn’t stop crying lol
The baby has the same birthday as me
Awww adorable my niece was born on January 7th in 2021 😍🥰
I’ve been here and also for the crazy middles I’m so happy for y’all and congrats
Epidurals are great. I had 2 deliveries with and the last without as the anaethasist had trouble siting the epidural. I would not have wanted another baby if my last was the first. My first 2 children came very fast , less than 2 hours of arriving at the hospital and I was very relaxed after the epidural . I was in labour for 7 hours with my 3rd and not at all relaxed when the epidural failed to be sited. A good anaesthetist makes all the difference
she is sooo cute
Congratulations
Congrats
Congratulations you beautiful people, you will make amazing loving parents God bless ♡♡♡♡
Please can you tell me your baby s name

Wow thank you YT for recommending me this video. A video about a teen throwing her life away by getting knocked up fresh out of high school. Lol and people are congratulating this.
Who cares? Young couple who want attention have a baby and bore everyone to death.

How wonderful, she really is beautiful. Congratulations, you will be such amazing parents xx
CONGRATULATIONS EVERYONE!!!  This brought back so many memories for me.  I got pregnant with my son 3½ months after my 18th birthday.  I was absolutely terrified but damned determined.  He was born 3 weeks after my 19th birthday, at 41 weeks and 6 days.  That was 20 years ago.  I'm not even 40 and my baby boy is a man.  I knew this day would come but had no idea how fast. Lacey and Eli, love her, cherish every moment, even the hardest most sleep deprived moments.  And when you think that it's all too much and you just might break, remember these words.... The Days (and Nights) Are Long But The Years Are (oh so,so, so) Short.  So hold her tight and sniff her up because she'll only be that little for just a little while.   Sending so much love from Virginia. Congratulations again, She's Perfect!!! 💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
Ok Lacey I have one more guess for your baby girl before you announce the name! Is it braylee? Or brailee?
Congratulations, soooo you guys never said what her name is!!! What is it lol
Imagine growing up with a camera in your face. People on the internet watching and judging your life and your parenting. Using kids as props is just creepy.
Awww she is cute my bday is in the 7th of January too!!!
So proud of you guys 🪄❤️❤️❤️!!!!
Congratulations on the new baby! She is such a beauty!
congrats!! she's beautiful
WOW! I'm so happy for you both! Congratulations with this precious, beautiful little girl! She was born the day after my father's birthday, and four days before mine! I wish you all the best in the future! Lots of love and hugs from Norway 🇳🇴

Congratulations lacy and eli she is so cute welcoming a new baby girl into the world
Congratulations
So blessed.. congrats
You guys making me cry again..so happy to see your lil bundle of joy..
I had my suspicions you had had baby girl when you hadn't posted for almost 1 week. When I saw your mum hadn't posted for 4 days it was confirmed in my mind. The Wallace family was in baby heaven. Enjoy all your baby cuddles, nothing more precious than those first few weeks getting to know your baby and establishing a feeding and sleep routine that works for baby (that was actually the hardest lesson for me as a first time mum, I was trying to get baby to match my routines when it is meant to be the other way around in the very early days).
Eli and Lacey again your baby girl is so precious, you both done a very good job congratulations again mommy and daddy♥️♥️♥️♥️.I told your parents I can't wait to know her name,
congratulations Lacey and Eli! She is beautiful and def looks like Eli to me. What is Eli's last name? and also, when will we find out the baby's name??
"CONGRATULATIONS" What a cutie & I think she looks like Eli right now. So happy for you ALL!!!!!!
Congratulations Lacey and Eli! You'll be great parents!♥️♥️♥️🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉
I know it's been a few days....but....use a jug of water whn you pee! Pour it as you're going....it'll help! 🥰
omg this made me cry when your were holding her and smile.. congrats you guys are going to be amazing parents
I knew it! Congratulations guys! She's absolutely beautiful....I'm sooooo happy for you both! I can wait to watch her and both of you grow 🥰😍
Congratulations to a wonderful little baby girl 🎈💝
Congratulations to Both of you, Mummy Lacey and Daddy Eli. She looks soo contented. I Bet Nanny Shelley and Grampa Gerrard are super Happy Having their First Granddaughter.  She's definitely going to be spoilt by her Aunts and Uncles. Xx
Congrats guys!! Your baby is lucky that she got such loving parents! ❤❤ Precious family! I love the way you both look at each other, beaming with pride 🥺

I know you already got the perfect name picked out for your perfect baby & I cant wait for the name reviel, but may I make suggestions for future babys?

Aww she was born on my birthday! Congratulations on a beautiful baby girl!
I hate they would not let me record 😭😭😭
Don't feel like you need to pump. with my last baby I wanted to see if I could strictly feed her off my breast and she's 7 months now never had a bottle. I never leak this time I think because my boobs know when she's hungry and they arnt getting tricked by the breast pump. she's way past her brother's on milestones she's so talkative crawling and it's more of a monkey crawl she is so strong pulls herself up onto things already!! it's crazy how different she is. I really like these cause it's hard for me to eat consistently sometimes. chlorella and spirlina tablets good natured brand on amazon.
Praying for ur healthy and fast recovery with u and your growing family, such a beautiful newborn ,looks just like Eli omgggg
Some cute names are Ella, Emma, Kate, and Charlotte
Congratulations guys!! Ahh so amazing! Baby girl is sooo cute 😍

Congratulations, Lacey and Eli! I sent you a message saying that baby girl needs to keep the tradition of January 7th as a day for major milestones, and she delivered with a lifetime of celebrations to come. I’m just so proud of you, and I cannot wait to watch you fall more in love with your little girl every day. It’s been a pleasure watching you and Eli care for one another with such maturity, and I’m so happy you’ve created a perfect bundle of love. I hope you’re recovering well and soaking in all the babyness. 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗  P.S. Sorry, you had to buy a mirror for the car. I got you the one off your wishlist, but it’s taking a very long time to be delivered. Hopefully, dad or the grandparents can use it when it arrives.

Congratulations on the safe arrival of your gorgeous little girl, I can’t wait till you let us know her name. You both look naturals with her already, enjoy every little moment because it all goes so fast. Xx
Huge congratulations to Mommy and Daddy - beautiful little baba - enjoy every minute xxx
whats her name
You have a Capricorn girl 🤙🏼 We are the best. Stubborn as all hell but loyal and kind.  Just had my bday on 12/31. God Bless you guys. This is gonna be a fucking fun rollercoaster for you. Don’t have kids myself yet but I have a bunch of nephews who are amazing.  Play her some good music.  Look up lullaby versions of your favorite songs.  I was hoping you’d name her Betsy because that’s my name and I’m kinda amazing 🤷🏻‍♀️ Anyway, take care of yourself. You’re gonna feel a lot of emotions. You’re going to think you’re doing everything wrong. That’s normal. If you thought you were doing everything right - then people should be concerned.   Be good to yourself so you can properly give off good vibes to your little one. You know they say in the event of a plane crash (yikes that’s dark.. sorry) you are supposed to take the oxygen mask first so you can properly attend to your loved ones. So yeah, take the mask first. It will always benefit your family because they need you around ❤️
she so beauty ful!!! you two are going to be the best parent that anyone can have
Congratulations to you Both she is precious & so so beautiful ♥

Wow!!! I’m so happy you had an easy birth and she is so beautiful and perfect!! Ahhhh enjoy your new parenthood- welcome to the club! One thing of advice I can say- even though you guys are going to obviously be AMAZING and loving parents- is what worked for me is that I didn’t try to whisper or be too quiet when my son was first born. You don’t want to have to tip toe around a sleeping baby or child for 10 years lol. I know you guys will do great and again congrats! 💕💕💕💕💕

I just watched an old video and she wanted to name her first daughter to be called everly  Omg they liked my comment ahhhhh it
Congratulations on the birth of your sweet baby girl, I know your family is all excited for you thanks for sharing with all of us!!
Congrats you guys!! I'm so glad everything went ok. Lacey you were right apparently..you guessed the closest time but your mom and Eli made you think twice. You knew it tho! I'm glad you didnt have to push for long! It's less sore afterwards if you didn't have to push too long. I'm so happy for you guys! I was a mess watching it. Birth is seriously just the most beautiful thing ever. And watching you watch Eli when you handed her to him for the first time was adorable and I so remember that feeling. It makes you love him even more and this whole process most likely will bring you both closer. I know it did for me. So so beyond happy for you guys and cant wait to learn her name and to see your next adventures! Btw..from what you showed..you acted like that was all a piece of cake! You didnt look tired or run down and were so smiley and just your normal self. Seems like you kicked butt girl! Great job! And again, congrats to you all, she's beautiful 💜💚
Omg she looks just like Eli. Maaan why you gotta make us wait for the name tho?! Congrats 💖
You looked stunning throughout the whole process you superwoman
I can't wait to know her name! It's like we are part of the family.
Prayers for a fast recovery I am so excited for you and Eli can't wait to learn her name sending love and hugs from alabama
Congratulations!
I AM IN LOVE! she is so adorable and from the looks of everything , you done AMAZING! i can’t wait to see the parents that you and eli become and i’m sure you both will do great!!

Congratulations to you all!!! She was born on my little sisters birthday, that is so awesome!!!
Congratulations she is absolutely beautiful
Welcome to the world beautiful girl 🎉💕  Congratulations on the arrival of your precious daughter.
Congratulations, I'm so glad everything went so extremely smoothly. You did so well, kept your cool and did what you were supposed to do. The medical workers did well and the stars aligned. Just wonderful 😊 this random internet person you don't know is proud of ya! For what that's worth lol.  I must say it's bittersweet watching it go so well! Happy that it did and at the same time so frustrated for my cousin. She got pregnant around the same time as you and the pregnancy went perfectly, she brought him full term with no issues. But when she went to have the baby over christmas week everything went horribly wrong. So it's a big contrasting moment for me watching this. The mysteries of the universe are endless. Some believe we're at the mercy of something. But it feels more like being at the mercy of nothing - because of how random and unpredictable it all is.  Anyway, congratulations again! The universe is in your favor right now and your child is safe and loved 💕
Congratulations guys she’s beautiful
She seems like she is going to be a very good baby but I have to say she looks a lot like Eli and I am so happy for both of you I can't wait to see her grow🥰🥰
