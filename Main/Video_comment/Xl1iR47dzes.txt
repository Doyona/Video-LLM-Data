Lol! I love it!! "....t's a completely different story. But cheese, for whatever reason, doesn't bug me . Aaaand there IS science behind it. And I have done the research, but I DON'T THINK ANYONE CARES." 😁😂 spot on, sister!!  I have a nephew who came out of Chef school in Italy, just before he was killed by a drunk driver. He had exceptional taste buds. He grew up in the Alps area of Northern Italy, in a small town where they still have public FOUNTAINS OF NATURAL MINERAL WATER COMING DIRECTLY FROM THE MOUNTAINS. Each borough is connected to different valleys. Federico, the nephew, without knowing where the water was from, was always able to recognise the valley where the fountain - which it came from - was connected to! He would simply drink and then say, "This water comes from the 'Bournel' fountain." And he would always get it right.  May he "channel" through you some of his strange creation. He is a rapper, as well, if they come in verses, maybe they're from him. I mean it! 😘  - Totally subscribed, my darling. Beautiful, gracious, genuine work And generous for opening up and leading the way. Your generation is the true trailblazing.
I don't get the hype.
This video is a part of the history of YouTube. I mean, a masterpiece
cool
I was expecting you to blend it 😅 because that is what I would’ve done
❤❤❤
the only channel on the internet i find interesting, peaceful, welcoming, and calming. Ive been cooking for 16 ish years and im still before collage. you made a video 12 minutes long about soup...best cooking video ive ever seen.
She was nara smith before nara smith was even a thing
I Do like watching this &🫛🧅 Love to Try it But, I don’t like the Swearing..

This feels like a parody of someone going to enormous lengths to document & explicate the most mundane aspects of their life. If it's intentional, it's brilliantly subtle deadpan humor.
🍽😏✨❤️👍
The brown soup base kills me :'D (from what her expectations were)
Only emma can make sum white people shit look good Istg
i care about the cheese science research
These videos make me feel so safe❤
IF today's kids were cut off from electricity they would all be in straight jackets.
plzzz not the unseasoned potatoes😭😣
This is literally what i want as an english learners, do your things, talk about, we gonna go watch it 😂
shes so real for changing the lid of the blender 4 times before she got it right
If somebody is here to improve their English like me, I should say, her English level is just B1-B2.
I’m obsessed with minute 6. You are sooo funny. Cheers!
came back. Im making this soup. Love you emma, take me to Paris now
next batch blend in half the peas they will make it way greener and be super yummy
noooo emma pls tell me you've talked ab the milk vs cheese research cause i have the same thing 😭 8:44
That ended up alien.
dear emma, today I tried to make this soup and it was great! not only did it taste amazing but I also really enjoyed the process of making it. thank you so much for inspiring me in my everyday life. i appreciate it incredibly much. love you.

Emma I love you 😭😭 I hope you know that.  You just sent a big hug when I needed it 💕
Bro better than bullion is the secret sauce
I’m all for being healthy however this soup needs some protein to it
That looks so yummy I’m here after watching the new collab vid 😂
the grey stuff is mold. looks like you're still alive though.
Hey                                                    Hi
😂😂😂😂😂
i looooooooooove soooooooouuuuuuuuppppppppp
Love you Emma
the video is slow that make me feel so relax and comfortable
this is one of my firat times  actually bindge watchingyour videos i even fell asleep to one dude you are amazing i love uuuuu emma
Napoleon Dynamite vibes.
5:52 The shorts are beautiful. I see it as beautiful, and it fits with a tight T-shirt with or without sleeves. Only a wide thread is so beautiful. The color is black.
I did my version of this recipie and it was super green! Its such a good soup ❤😊
This is your best work Emma. THE BEST WORK
Emma and her armpits. I love her
Good for her for not doing any stylized editing or adding annoying music to this.
looks like vomit
i’m so fucking proud too. the amount of research and work you put into this soup is impressive. and i love how determined you were 💕
these videos are so comforting ♡
Major farts next day right? be honest
The video is slow paced, it's uncertain if the results will even be good in the beginning, the food does not look unnecessarily aesthetically pleasing, the kitchen is messy after and she is wearing something you would actually wear whilst cooking... I have stopped using Instagram and consuming lifestyle content altogether but this makes me happy :)
pov: your here in 2023 after the met gala
i love u emma
imy
"And i would pay 17 dollars for it" that sentence alone was worth watching the entire doc abt the soup lmao
Parmesan cheese had an extremely low amount of lactose in it. There’s actually a few cheeses you can eat that are naturally low in lactose and that’s probably why your stomach doesn’t hurt after eating some cheeses.
i love you emma
Which camera do emma use?
.
my mom loves cooking (she has her own youtube channel @notas de sabor) she always cuts carrots and onions and that stuff and put it in a ziplock in the freezer... just for a tip 😅
i know its 1 year ago, but watched it and as a greek person i have to say that this exactly ''soup'' we call it ''araka'' here in greece. u can also add some tomato sauce or just tomatoes to make it more ''red'' as we usually do it here . <3
Anyone else laughing that she cut the “ends” of the potatoes off?
Run to my heart ❤
I thought you had an apartment in nyc that you air bnb’d out❤
I randomly found you whenever you went testing fast food breakfast, love your videos! Keep at it!
i thought it was pronounced boo-lee-on
People are so creative
How have you not made soup before / not know how to cook? Why do you have all that fancy kitchen stuff if you dont cook how did you make food before you were rich and famous??
Emma Chamberlain how are you today? Hey Emma do you have time to help Rakuten with their Influrencer program if so hop over their now and sign up for the Influencer program.
This video is so beautifully made
Love the originality! Seeing that this is a year ago, I'm pretty sure Emma has learned better knife skills and what the stuff is called that encases a shallot, onion etc (skin). Just discovered EmC on Hot Ones and...respect. I love you now and forever and wish you all the success.
1st time watching the video. ~3:05pm, Sunday. 5 Feb, 2023.
Honey, it’s pesto and peas with gnocchi - add toasted pine nuts and parmesan. It’s pesto peas parm pinenuts and toss it with fresh gnocchi!  Make your own pesto!! Add basil ribbons and toasted pinenuts and parm to garnish.
The amount of times that i watched her videos is so embarrassing
Watched this while eating my own homemade soup. I can definitely relate to that fear of messing something up and it not being good, I'd convinced myself while cooking this one that I'd made a big mistake in going with a recipe that was so "out there" sounding (it's a Curried Pumpkin Soup) and that it was gonna be disgusting. It was actually amazing, especially when decided to add some rice to give a little more of a texture aside from the diced onions that were in it. Speaking of onions, I also agree on that point. I don't like raw onion, like I always get them taken off burgers and salads, but they add so much flavor to recipes.
In Germany we have a soup called “Erbsensuppe“ which is quite similar to what you cooked except that the peas and potatoes are halfway mashed.😋
> Can't cut a onion properly  > Also thinks she can develop a dish from scratch   Cooking as everything in life is about phases, you cannot walk if you are unable to crawl... This December I was with my sister, she was in charge of cutting potatoes really thinly for a millefeuille with bechamel, she couldn't cut them really thinly and asked me if she could do the bechamel instead, I replied "if you can't cook some potato thinly, how would you think you are ready to make a bechamel?". This anecdote applies here, learn the basics, meaning months and months even years of proper technique and knowledge of why and then maybe you can come up with something that it is balanced and flavourful not simply because you chose 3 ingredients and had to mix them together no matter what or because it was envision, which much of the time is just about obstinacy. It is the first time I see a video and I know why it was so hard for you to see the benefit of cooking since you must have taken double the time it took you for preparation just picking up the trash you left everywhere in the kitchen.... advice, pick up the trash you are leaving on the counter, it is a mess and dirty for the rest of the preparation. Collect, clean and tidy up things as you cook and finish using them.  Also second advice, boil the green peas, put them in cold water, blend them with a bit of their cooking water, basil, olive oil and some heavy cream for cooking, there you have a vibrant green, kind of soup.
❤
i know you’re talking about cooking things slow and being patient but that hit me on a whole other level.
Wait for it
1:48
you're probably never going to see this, but an easy & quick way to prep garlic is to peel them and then just put a pan or knife on top and press down.
i just have to say......cheese is not a phase. it is a way of life.
i don't know if this is true or not, but maybe one should not put anything extremely hot in a blendor which is made of plastic, as plastic tends to get melt at very high boiling temperatures. I'm really not sure if this is true or not, but just wanted to share it with you. btw, really enjoy your effortless and normal vlogs, which are very therapeutic :)
The pause after that armpit anecdote really made me laugh.
Peas and love
emma is my therapy.
this is the happy eneding everybody looking for
this was posted right before I had my terrible sleep paralysis, it's turning 1 year old 😭😭😭😭 time really flies what the fuck
What you did so beautifully was layers of flavor! Your a natural! You could have even blended all of it into a smooth delicious pea basil soup yum! Very inspiring 👋
Emma, Why are you so Beautiful
What am I missing here?.......
That looked awful
this is so fire
The way that Emma tried to made a recipe>>>>>>> I Just hope she ALWAYS happy.
Okay I get why people watch you now.
that Miele HR 1956-3 range costs more than my car
I DO THE SAME THING WITH MY NINJA BLENDER
I think you could have blended maybe half or a cup of the peas into the brother mixture and then poured it back into the pan and then put the rest of the peas in with the potatoes
i’m going to make this soup
cheers emma. to get the garlic/onion smell out of ur hands, immediately wash with soap or dish soap under cold water!
amazing how basic long winded cooking videos get millions of views.   so weird...this YT celeb thing.  yawn.  congrats tho.  good on you.
I LIKE YUMMY IN MY TUMMY
u cudve blended half ur peas to make it greaner
Nobody knows what they fuck they're doing when their cooking. That's what recipes are for. Only everyday chefs who do the same thing day in day out can do it by memory
I also don't get my blender lid on correctly on the 2nd or 3rd try
weirdest soup i've seen
I love emma. she makes me feel like she is just one of us. U know u see these celebrities being all organized and shit. she is real. that's how life is. that's how my kitchen looks when i cook.
I’m so proud of you, Emma
she really tried all the options on the blender😂
Seni seviyorum ♥️
she used so many peas...
That looks absolutely fucking good…
touchscreen toaster?
Can u please tell the ingredients in Boine sauce you are adding here. Looking yummy. Want to make sure if this is vegetarian 😋😊🙏🙏🙏
Yummy yummy Soup 🍜 👍👍😋
I LOVE ONION AND GARLIC ESPECIALLY GARLIC AND I PUT IT EVERYWHERE! And you know what? My husband also fell in love with onions and garlic, although he hated him before marriage..Even our cat eats garlic
How did I get here?
I love your soup journey
🇺🇸
Can you share more daily vlogs ❤
I have literally never in my life related to a video this much I swear to god!!! it was like literally watching myself cook
It officially fall and I want to make this soup!
why does her narration sound like Christopher walkin reading where the wild things are?
Greatest thing that’s happened to me yet in life has been this video
Months later lol... but oh well haha i have a tip for the garlic and onions hands! Rub your hands and fingers on stainless steel (my sink is stainless steel so it helps), if you can scrub it with wire/copper scrubby things (yes horrible for the environment, transition is a process) , wash with dish soap and cold water. Repeat until the smell is gone.🌟
i want more soup movies
Be careful mixing hot fluids into a ninja it will Crack the plastic
emma this is one of my favorite videos you’ve ever made hahaha i would pay $3 to watch it (which come on for just 12 minutes that’s a pretty good score)
I see why so many people like you. 😅
I could some how smell the garlic through the screen and I honestly don't know how to feel
I doooo want to hear the research about the cheese and milk thing because i kind of have the same problem with my stomach. Hope u could share it next time !!
you should make daily motivation day videos; like u do but specific to daily motivation

That’s so funny I was busy doin something else and I just hear her say “YOU LOVE ONION AND GARLIC YES YOU YOU LOVE ONION AND GARLIC.” AND I FUCKING LOVE ONION AND GARLIC SO IT WAS PERFECT AHAHAHA
No you did not just put the whole soup in the blender
OK.   I had no idea who you are.  Then randomly on Facebook I see you with Jimmy Fallon with a clip if you reacting to some other person I do not. know who he is ( this is probably because Im old and just now starting to "get"? You Tube, even though Im an IT person who should have "got" it a long time ago?   Anyway.  so i see your reaction to that dude that says "love ya".   thought it was cute and googled ya.    OK she is a youtube personality.  Not an easy thing to do even. though to some may appear easy. ( i do know that much).  so all these youtube videos come up with you doing your thing.  So I pick this soup one.      Took me like 3 min in and I completely understand why that dude said I love ya!!!!!     Its this thing you obviously have.  a perspective and curious well spoken zest for life that is obviously addictive to your followers.   well done young lady.    Ill be watching more of you.   I never subscribe to anything, but listening to you make soup of all things made me click that button.   The question is however would I have clicked that button if you were not super cute. " saying that in maybe almost like a proud Dad way because it sounds creepy coming from an old guy?    anyway. carry on
небольшой лайфхак: если варить все(картошку, горошек и так далее) в одной кастрюле, то бульон получится супер вкусным и сам суп будет на 30% вкуснее (im sorry i dont know how write this in english)
No one: Emma: BOYON
HOLY SHEET thats a FUNKY ASS TOASTER
aloo matar curry indian version
comfort video
Feed me soup.
Making soup is the most spiritual thing ever! And now I can't wait to make soup this week.
my heart is so happy seeing emma editing again and loving it.
Another yummy thing you can do is blend some of the peas up with the broth and it makes it a bit thicker and tasy :)
Soup = life, it’s all a metaphor and I’m into it
it obviously tasted good because you cooked it with optimism and u took a risk
*Gordon Ramsay has entered chat*
comfort video 🦦💓
I get what you're saying and have come to the same understanding and appreciation the past few years.
Get something call stainless steel soap… they take the smell out
This video is so artistic, wow
Really loving Emma’s editing style lately
This reminds me of her mom lol
“I understand how the grandmas are into this shit , I get it” 🤣
love you but the way you pronounce boullion kinda bothers me:D is that how you pronounce it in the USA?
I'm actually so happy to see we have a matching blender 🥺 I always felt bad seeing vitamix in videos like this lol makes me jealous
this just inspired me to cook this pasta i’ve been craving for so long oh my god
Making soupe means cooking things in the same water like why the stress with cooking them seperet
I’m so glad to hear you found something. I’ve been looking for something like that for a long time. But you know what they say, god blesses angels and not fuck ups.
would love to know more about your smart toaster
It was the long pause mid-way through this 12 minute pure chattery that had me 😂😂 idky im still watching but looking forward to the end
Is it just me or is Emma’s vids downgrading and is she running outta ideas
This felt like a podcast Somehow it also felt like summer
Someone cares 😎👍 *that you did the research    this here soup turned out beautifully 😍   like clockwork
soup queen
hahahahah you are so funny
Emma u make me rethink life and start romanticizing it
I thought the title was soap so for the over half the video I was waiting for the soap making part
Never knew shallots looked like that😂
You’re so freakin dope
Whoaa how did you manage to make a cooking video entertaining to me!! I want moreee this is so fun and calming :)
rub your hands on metal (the sink your sth similar) to get rid of the garlic and onion smell on your hands :)
we miss u
because I have seen the rash on your side and you mention it often that you are learning about things and that there are more people who genuinely care imho that we can perceive most of the time i just would like to say that i would like to see your eyes happy and also because there was that pimple too... and here you say you _"have_ _to"_ put parmesan cheese on _"everything"_ these are signs of addictive foods We all are dealing with the same exact things.. Andrea Cox explains it very clearly as well as FullyRaw I get my life my heart my soul my sanity my health back and better than restored staying on mango and melon islands as i heard they call it in Miami Blessed Divine Love Light Guidance and Clarity

I could watch this all day… and I do!
Why are the peas so… wet?! 😭
@benoftheweek
I love u so much emma thr soup looks so good I’m definitely going to try it
6:43 anyone else think there was something wrong with there sound at this part
You should try your hand at gazpacho & Moscow mules … the summer sauce 4sure
Somebody: Emma, time to find a husband! Emma: Hold my latte!
emma should make a cookbook with all of her meals that she has loved, created, and been inspired by. i would buy it in a heartbeat and i feel like it would really take her mind off of things in a way
oooh id love to see pine nuts in this soup
You should get one of them chopping machines like you smack it and it chops it up!
Emma, your videos are so calming and enjoyable and I just love you so much ❤️
you’re so funny
emma i love you
it just no longer feels like a facetime w you :(
But the whole dilemma with you drinking milk and not being good for you but the cheese is ok for you I was dying to hear what you were going to say emmma! Lol
This soupe actually exists in a country called algeria. It’s my country so that’s how I know lol, anyways it’s made of everything you added plus meat and artichoke, I love it
honestly this changed my life ngl
I love u ur one of my fav ppl on this app fr
this is the best youtube video i've seen. literally thank you.
the fact that you are famous just shows this world is going completely to shit
I love you Emma
Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven "I am the way, the truth, and the life no one comes to the father but by me."  John 14:6   Ask God to reveal this to you he will!   "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." Rom 3:23 ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A SINNER. This is where that godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against the righteous God and there is a change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out.  "But God commended His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us." Romans 5:8 BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD. Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died for your sins, was buried, and that God raised Jesus from the dead. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was.  "For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved." Romans 10:13 CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.  Read the Bible, Walk with the Lord and give your life to Him!  Check out my testimony video!
We need an Emma cook book 😍
Im literally eating peas and onion saute rn with yogurt ofc
Emma... you're just..... so cute... SO CUTE.
Worst cooking show ever
Emma’s videos are always like a fever dream, I love everything about them and her.
I’m sorry that looks so bad
They sell little bars of sterling silver for you to wash your hands with and itll get rid of the smell of garlic, onions, shallots, etc
this is my dream- to cook alone and do whatever the fuck i feel like without being ashamed of anyone
we need a cooking series pls
She sound so shocked that peas are green. Other that black eyed peas what other colors are they
Pea Chamberlain! 🤣
absolutely love this video
Hi Emma I just wanted to say that I have the same thing with the milk and cheese 😂 so now I’m on lactose free diet
PEE MY VID
Hi Emma! -  Just noticed you didn't upload for a long time until the NYC video. I am a new suscriber but I really wish you are ok and safe 💖. You are absoloutely funny, unique and relatable. Thank you, and I can't wait for your next video as long as you are healthy and happy!
As a professional Chef, please allow me to teach you proper knife skills 🤣
$17
I am really proud of the person you are becoming. I saw all you videos and i see you evolving. I love all your last videos...especially this one its like art, amazing storytelling.
Y'all should try: peas with rice and potato and minced beef with tomato soup and maybe cooked carrots if you want with salt and pepper and other spices you like
cool video !!
True a woman only needs a: 1: A Good Kitchen 2: A Nice Cleaner and finally 3: A brain
You gotta try minty mushy peas with smoked baked beans
It feels like I know you it’s really weird but cool Keep posting content will love it
I am happy you have discovered the joy in cooking. With fresh ingredients, experiment and care, the food we make ourselves can be absolutely amazing. Indeed, there are diversions that don't work out perfectly, but those are the lessons.
I mean but you could totally wash your hands more when you cook 🤷

i’ve never heard the word shallot more
I thought u were iamsanna sister-     Omggg i,m very sorry
YouTube star Emma Chamberlain is catching flak for wearing some jaw-dropping gems believed to have been stolen from Indian Royalty at the 2022 Met Gala.
$17 for pea soup?
Has anyone else tried the recipe? Looks delicious!
Lol..
good soup
It‘s impossible to love someone so much
duuude that looks so good.. the music on the food shots has me feeling inspired lmao
i made rice yesterday but it was on high & it got too mushy. I know better but i be hungry 😂
I love the ambient music in your videos
Erbsesupp wird bei uus in Deutschland awwer e ganz Eck dicker gemoocht!  Translated from german regional dialect "Hessisch" to english:  Traditionally, in Germany green pea soup is made much much thicker.
This kinda feels like a modern family commentary video
wow amazing i'm totally gonna make this soup
“Itching my armpit”??? Does she mean Scratching???
instead of soup i read soap , so i was really confused
The importance of taking it slow. This is the lesson that I had to learn myself as well ;D
I think see is deleted my all comments
i genuinely thought the title was soap but then as i started watching the video i was like this has nothing to do with soap and i looked again and it was soup
“You know, like I don’t know”
the reason you are popular is what is wrong with this world
I'm sorry but it really bothered me that you didn't blend the peas and potatoes with the rest of the stock.
this is the most entertaining sht ive ever watched. Emma's voice is just so calming and i never thought i would be THIS interested in soups.
guys she’s back stop rewatching this video
I think this wight plate stolen 0:03 in your neighborhood

I miss Emma🥺
Emma's not very private I am! I'm in her closet, I'm under her bed, and I'm even hanging from the chandelier above it, if she finds out that would ruin my privacy and everybody would know LOL, at least I'm not in her bathtub or her shower,,she doesn't keep mirrors there? anyhow, when she's looking right at me, she can't even see me!👻
I guess she is too famous for Youtube now. She forgot her roots and let the other projects and endorsements distract her. Of course she with come back with a sorry excuse.
we miss youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
these last 6 months have been bad without emma posting
watching Emma make a soup is entrainment on a whole different level,the score and narration is absolutely superb.
We miss the weekly vlogs Emma, please come back soon. We love you so much❤️
I think the reason why watching Emma is so calming is because she doesn’t try to be hype. She just is, and it makes me feel like it’s okay to just be. And that’s enough
Lol this feels like Emma’s podcast but with cooking footage on top. ✨
only Emma could make an actual soup movie & have our full attention for 12 minutes and 11 seconds.
watching Emma make a soup is entrainment on a whole different level,the score and narration is absolutely superb.
I bet you make babies smile.
An end of an era, thanks Emma for the years of joy you've given us
We miss the weekly vlogs Emma, please come back soon. We love you so much❤️
what happened? Why she doesn't download any videos?
We miss the weekly vlogs Emma, please come back soon. We love you so much❤️

Okay but I literally love Emma she’s really fun and I love how she documents so much and she’s just so funny in general, I hope ur doing well Emma and stay safe!! 💞
Lol this feels like Emma’s podcast but with cooking footage on top. ✨
This week I had a dream that Emma uploaded a video lmao! I’m not a mega fan, but I’ve been around for this entire journey, watching every video.   It made me realize that just her presence, in and of itself, is something that benefits viewers. Even though social media is a strange phenomenon and the analytics / algorithms aren’t sustainable for the creators, it just feels like she was doing something that made people more happy in everyday life.  It’s been weird to go to college and get various jobs I hated while having FOMO of Emma’s lifestyle. I’m glad she illuminated some of the hardships, such as never getting breaks to truly relax.  I hope she considers coming back, if this is something she could do again 💙
Just remember kids that you made Emma famous. Then years later at the peek of her popularity she takes a mental health break because "YouTube" is stressful, yet still has time for big companies like Vogue, Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein etc. She's a multi millionaire now because of each and everyone of you and she can't make a 5 min video a week just to help her fans with their mental health. Hows that multi million dollar remodel of your multi million dollar mansion in the hills of Cali Emma?

This film style that Emma has begun to utilize is so peaceful. Her journey from more up beat and choppy videos to more documentary style has been so mature and impressive. This new style of hers is why we have been able to maintain interest in her videos as we grow up, as we have grown Emma’s slower, more zoomed and fluid filming style has grown too. We have all begun to feel a sense of nostalgia and comfort with her videos and I’m loving it.

Where is emma ??💔
emma we miss you :(((
Please post soon I miss your vlogs 😢
i miss her so much. ik her mental health is more important than her videos but she was one of my only friends thats not fake tbh.
It’s the shot of the peas that got me dead 😂
Next time blending some of the peas with the broth and then save some for the soup 🤍😊
I know she's taking time to work on her mental health but I miss her so much😭I hope she's okay and will hopefully get back on YouTube ❤
Can you plzzz post something?
I’ve been watching your youtube videos and listening to your podcast since the beginning, you are such an inspiration and a beautiful soul. You helped me through some of my worst times and I am so grateful for you. We miss you on youtube very much, but take as much time as you need!
i never understand the hate on garlic and onion because i add them in EVERYTHING and immediately whatever I'm cooking tastes way better
Is this the girl who wore that Patiala choker stolen from India ⁉️
<3
yo i cant see ur blendeds top but make sure when blending H O T liquid there's an opening and go low and slow :D Haha until it's Blended then u can speed up heat expands
What ever youtubers do... Take it as a entertainment... For people think she is acting don't you guys watch movies... Are those not acting... Its her success don't be jelly about it...
JUST WAITING AND  REPEATING YOUR OLD VIDEOS. I HOPE YOU ARE  FEELING BETTER AND HAPPIER. LOVE YOU EMMA💜💜💜
I think  Emma went into hiding.  It is really hard to keep up a channel when you have other things going on.  Maybe she could just post once a month.  I would be happy with that.

MHMM
Yesterday I started listening to your podcast because I wanted to improve my listening skills since I’m not a native English speaker, and though I don’t really agree with everything you say, I really enjoy listening to your podcasts.  Love your style.
To all those people who are arguing that she was the one who stolen that necklace 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️stfu . they are thinking that Emma personally came to India and stolen the necklace and suddenly decided to wear it at the met gala . Like she doesn't own the necklace okay!! the jewelry brand Cartier have that . please go and watch vogue video of Emma , she chose the necklace and she didn't know anything about its history.  Why are you all asking her to give that back ? It's not her fault
imy☹️
Hey just wanted to say that you inspired me to start a YouTube channel and be more confident ! Hope you are doing well and to anyone reading this you can do it even tho it’s hard it’s gonna get better ❤️
I miss her videos soooooo much
I miss you :(
you are the body girl?
Your vid was a trip, love you

Miss you Emma

absolutely disgusting.   the food seems alright, though.
Ever since Emma left I’ve literally watched every video she has on her channel, skipping her annoying phase ofc but it’s gotten out of hand, I’ve run out of videos. Emma please come back but take all the time u need ❤️
Emma I miss you!
i miss you
U r a thief,return our diamond
I honestly don’t know why everyone hates her I’ve heard she might’ve been a bully at school and made a transphobic joke but idk I feel like people over react
I miss this so much
i miss u :(
missing you
There's no lactose in the regular white cheese
y'all got it all wrong about the jewelry. she got this jewelry from cartier and her team of stylists chose it for her to wear it so she couldn't have possibly known it was stolen. also, who in the world does research behind any jewelry they buy.
man idk about anyone else but i would not pay $17 for any soup, no matter how good it was. If the guy was like this is the best soup that's ever been made you have to buy it i'd be like nah i'm good i'll give it a pass. especially for a pea and potato soup, yeah no thanks. glad you enjoyed ur soup tho
This one wore stolen jewellery from Indian Royalty...the audacity
I love that her last YouTube video was of her making soup haha very Emma
Return the diamond
emma, we miss you! I'm tryna rewatch these videos

Y'all need to chill out a little. She DIDN'T steal the necklace, the Britishers did. And another company purchased it and gave Emma to put it on. She did nothing wrong if you ask me. Stop hating on her and call the company out!

Happy 21st Birthday Emma. I wish you the best birthday that you can have in this new year of 2022 and pray that whatever your plans are for today all your dreams come true on your birthday today.
I made tortillas after watching this that were my most successful yet.  Not to troll but      part of the beauty of soup is you can make it all in one pot. It's easier.   Carrot  Ginger Cayenne Is one I like Onions and garlic. Peace
Your high right?
LOL you're right I always thought I hate garlic but when I started to cook and learn that the garlic make the food delicious!
Wth I didn’t even know that me and Emma had the same birthday may 22!!❤️
i miss you

We need more video from u
Britishers loot every precious thing from India and flaunt it in rubbish shows like metgala great
Missing you Emma! I know you're doing what's best for you. I hope your journey is going well.
Maybe a basil infused creamy potato soup? I would say add a lot of potatoes and a bit of cream to thicken it up and season to taste?! Perhaps for next time… lol
Must be nice to wear a stolen diamond with pride.
emma please come back. You are my therapist, my friend. Someone i can relate to
emma I miss you and your videos. since you stopped posting I became obsessed with your podcast because I miss listening to you talk 💔
Miss u Emma, hope ur doing good xxx

Here from Jack Edwards and — it’s soup, yet I’m enthralled. Thanks
Never blend basil…
After Kohinoor this is another and this number is really huge!!  You guys are international level thieves!!🤑 come India we'll give you more for free but stop your occupation as a bloody thief!! Actually I'm not targeting you but your sponsors you're just a way!!
India 🇮🇳 (This word will definitely remember to you that you guys are thief!!👍)
What a Shame Thiefs having 11 million subscriber
Hopefully she hasn’t been posting because she found the love of her life🥹
yeh but give us (Indian) the diamond choker first
$17 seems both high and low
hello thief
Thief 👎👎👎👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮

You should make a explanation video on the patiala necklace controversy. I'm also an Indian 🇮🇳 & I'm not here to blame you about anything...may be you didn't know about the history of the necklace. But I think you should make a video & tell your side of the story.
Thief
U thief!!! Return the necklace to us🇮🇳 #metgala2022

loveu,
Girl, after cooking or touching garlic, just let the water run through your fingers! DO NOT RUB your fingers. Just let the water run.. the smell goes away, 100% guaranteed. 😘
thank you for raising me, thank you for always making me feel better, thank you for being you. now it’s our time to be supporting you through everything you do. thank you for all these years❤️
Everyone in the comments wondering where she is? She went to wear the stolen necklace Of patiala’s king and being disrespectful. Apparently Being white YouTuber gives her authority to wear our king’s necklace.
She thought being YouTuber means she can wear kings necklace? She’s canceled
hey emma, we all support you and love you for taking your time off of youtube. whenever you are ready, we will be here supporting you for your decisions and love you.
I miss you sm
Its been 5 months :(
This is an incredibly beautiful candid video. I imagine her putting out videos like this must be nerve-wracking but I totally loved it. The honesty, straightforwardness of it kept me watching all the way through.
When your second facorite ytber is pulling a Cory Kenshin (pain).
hi Emma hope you’re doing good and if not hope this makes you a tiny bit better I MISS U SO FUCKING MUCH. ok that was kinda harsh but so proud of you.💗💗
Thinking of you, Emma, and hoping you are well and happy. ❤
omg it’s been 5 monthsssss

wearing stolen jewels is so fu*king disrespectful
Miss youuu
guys. she not going to come back is she :(
miss you emma
ai get it know
im proud of you bestie
Just me missing my comfort person
Kudos for her finally learning to cook. I've been cooking my whole life because I come from a poor family that could never afford to eat out. I still don't understand how this person is a millionaire for making videos like this but to each their own.
Hear me out, I am been watching her vlogs when she was this picky-junk eater, used to make random shit, and sometimes waste it during that process, unappreciative of the art of cooking and didn’t really know about flavour profile, aromas, and about all those shit BUT butt when she was narrating in this video I wouldn’t lie that I was so proud and it was so relatable because I was the before Emma aswell and I literally went through the same curve and the little things she now says about the garlic and shallots smell and about hating ourselves if we waste food, I MEAN I’D NEVER THOUGHT I WILL RELATE TO A SOUP MAKING VIDEO on this level. Period
Just want to make sure that u know how much i luv what u do on ur utub channel ... and this simple things u thought u uploaded made me alive again ... 💜
that soups looks/sounds delicious!
Anyone else kinda miss the forehead kiss at the end ?
miss you emmur, love you! <3
I stopped by and watched a few videos because I've been seeing alot of her and wanted to see why she's so popular. I don't get it. I find her boring and too repetitive 🤷🏻‍♀️ Not for me and that's okay, glad she has an audience that enjoys the content.
miss u emma :(
Why is she stop posting??
Why did you have to wear that necklace
Let me tell you a thing.  If she did this just for the money, she hasn't come this far.
i CANT U HAVE GREASE TRAPS LMAO
يا حرمه نزلي فيديو جديد تعبت انتضرش  💔
Don’t worry your shallots were fine
Hey thief, give the locket back...
Miss U girl how u doing :/<3
Stay gone, bish. We know your ur on heroin. 💉💉🥴

Why the heck is indian media trying to cancel emma chamberlain. Shes not  irrelevant yall cant kill her career with your smear campaign and propaganda. Piss off
This is why u dnt move and switch up😗always end up in the same place as before
I just have to mention how much I love your podcast <3333 have been listening these past few days !
i want to make soup now.
hi emma i miss you hope you’re doing well 🫶
Come bacccckkkkkk
I just love you (:
Emma make Latkas , your hands will smell special ‼️‼️‼️
Is she vegetarian ❓
we love you and miss you emma, I hope you are doing well, we are all here for you :)))
Cooking things on a low heat makes the flavour intense ! Like pasta sauce or soup, the lower and slower the better the flavour will be and it locks it in !
After I got saved, I started and continue to get  a stronger relationship with God everything got and is getting better. My thinking, my relationships with people, my life and I have someone who I can rely on which is God. Romans 10:9-11 (KJV)  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
I miss her your honor 🥹
Emma gemini’ sis why you dont keep posting videos :( i see you very bussy, btw i miss u
Give the necklace back its Indias u fool mc🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
Haramzado heera waapis kro.. Tum saale fakirchand ki aulaad ho sab chori ka maal phente ho..
That choker u wore on met gala belongs to Indian maharaj.. British people stole it from India and such YouTubers are wearing that stolen historic artifact.. Why?  Thiefs.. Girl u just lowered the value of that necklace.. 👎🏻 Shame of u y'all...  She deleted my previous comment.. How insecure are you?

You are bloody goddamm theif,
i just discovered this channel yesterday and today, for the first time in my life i cooked a proper meal by myself. i almost felt like crying while eating it. it tasted good and i am so proud of myself. thank you. ❤
Give back the necklace
EMMA. idk what to talk to u on bc i listened to ur podcast and i deleted all my other social media. but clearly if u happen to read this that’s what ur podcast episode was abt. u are not crazy!! i agree w you 100% and that’s why i only am on youtube, pinterest, and tiktok. i got bored and sick of it, i missed people posting with intention, etc. idk if you’ll read this or else i could go on and on but just wanted to say i agree and it’ll be cool to see what happens in this shift i’m glad u addressed it
come back 😭😭
😭😭😭
I dunno if this is selfish to say but I wish she could've said good bye to us properly on yt 🥺
i wont lie as an english person im going to concede that english or 'garden' peas aren't as good as petit pois
Give back the necklace to India
BESTIE i miss u, when are you going to upload again? i’m crying
just a reminder   i love you emma
DUDE, you're entire life is a cooking phase. WHERE ARE YOU?? ARE YOU ALIVE?
emma i miss u so much
These are some expensive pots, utensils and stove for a novice cook.
i miss you ;(
Please this Choker belong to Maharaja of Patiala which was stolen/looted by Britishers.so kindly  return this stolen piece to India where it belong ....This is part of our history
Why people like her
cant wait til you’re back
That choker belongs to india....
Pov- you’re a simp and you saw her at met gala and searched her
She has really nice hands. Sorry if that sounds creepy, but it’s true 😂
Come back please emmasss🥺🥺🥺
Caught ya
it’s already been 4 months i miss you emma ☹️
You might not believe this but you’re a big inspiration to me cooking-wise. I was really eating too much protein from meat. I have been vegetarian, even macrobiotic in the past but I don’t like to follow rigid plans. You’ve gotten me back into steaming and roasting veggies andmaking hummus. I added a bit of tumeric and grated lemon peel to my hummus and that made it super yummy. The tumeric makes it a much brighter yellow than the regular beige garbanzo color. Thanks a lot Chef Emma!  P.S. I love your quick, off-the-cuff style! I can’t watch slow, careful, Earth sign, Earth mama cooks (but love you earth mamas!) who carefully weigh and measure everything to a knat’s boogie. Drives me nuts, l can’t watch. But you are so funny, and don’t mess around. Love to watch your cooking vids 👩🏻‍🍳
you should do a closet tour
Miss u :(
Your cooking vlogs are so interesting 💗
This was therapeutic
the most relaxing thing ever
Missing emma vlogs :(
You can cook everything all together at the same time
The way she says bouillon 😂😂
Now I really want soup 🍲
we love you emma
I MISS YOUR POSTS!! Hope you’re doing okay❤️
miss u emba
Where are you?????
I love you Em ❤️!
im sorry i know ur burnt out and u dont wanna hear this BUT i fucking miss u alright?? yes i do, i miss emma chamberlain. on youtube,,,,, and thats on periodical
hey emma my love just wanna let u know i've listened to all ur podcasts and watched all ur videos and im completely supportive if in the end u decide to never come back to youtube but i just want u to know, no one else expects u to do anything different and revolutionary in ur videos even tho thats what ur expecting from yourself. for 3 years and especially with ur more recent videos i find comfort and safety from ur simple and mundane conversations and daily activities. its also been a great help with my anxiety. so i just hope you know ur videos have been such a great comfort to so many ppl and if this just turn out to not be fulfilling you ofc we all understand and support u. just remember ppl dont love u for what ur doing and how unique ur videos are. but for who you are and honestly idc what video i get of u just as long as there's something to see bc i enjoy ur company and presence on yt xx
Oh you should follow Cobb the Drummer.
Masterful
Good soup
this video was such an artwork
My anxiety looking those onions 😩
the constant close up of the peas 😭
You could use the tip of the knife as a fulcrum point, it may increase the speed of your chopping
I had this thought process the other day, it went something like, compared to how I shop there are people that when they see aisles of groceries they see limitless possibilities. Their minds are literally going a mile a minute, and making all these connections, meanwhile I just look for good hot sauce and candy more than anything, unfortunately.
I love that 4 tries on the blender lid. That affirmation was astonishing to my soul. Thnx
i stopped watching ur videos a few years ago (like 2). Yesterday I got curios and decided to see how u we’re doing and what type of content u were making. The video i saw yesterday was the one u uploaded prior to this one, and i was really surprised. ur editing style and video concepts changed so much and i really loved it. It’s common for people to say “i miss the old ______” and i never liked that statement too much bc people are constantly growing and changing. Your growth and change is admirable. Not to say that the old u wasn’t good, but the new you is refreshing.
i missed you
i am proud of u ❤
I'm sorry, but what is that disgusting, rusty tray she's putting her spoons and water jug on? It looks like a bio hazard.
emma i miss u
I cried this morning because I miss Emma’s video so much . Thank god for her podcast
I’ve watched you since the very beginning and honestly I miss your videos lol.
Where are you it has been four months!
It’s actually crazy being one of the people that have been here since her first few videos. I remember watching her school routine when she was 16 and I’ve been subbed ever since. I remember when she had 200k subs. When only me and my friend knew about her and we kept it on the DL so the whole school wouldn’t be talking about her. But eventually she blew up and we were like WOAH
Keep evolving bae, also, literally no one knows how to dice an onion it’s ok
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUKiGKXWDok
Am i the only one who has never watched Emma chamberlain
Emma!! I bought your matcha and have a recipe I want you to try :)))  One teaspoon of matcha  One teaspoon of maple syrup  A splash of half and half  If you want it sweeter 1 teaspoon of sugar   Please blow this up I really want her to try it!!
Miss you emma
It's not about "pretending being boring" it's about being selective with the stuff she shows
I’m literally crying every night because I miss emma sm
Hey its been a while, how r u doing, just checking in, I feel like you need to vent lol
I miss u em;(
love u emma forever and always 💗
Miss U so so much Emma. Take ur time, whenever U feel ready ❣️
You could be a really great cook! I think you should go to Paris for six months and take a basic cooking course in English.
It’s time for more posts
love u and hope u are doing great 💗💋
Love your videos ❤️❤️🤌🤌❤️ caption tho❤️

Stainless steel removes the garlic onion scent from your fingertips. Run it against the sides of butter knife
miss u
You guys have to realize that those public people like youtuber don't care about you as an individual. :-( Emma has never cared about anything else than having a big income. Now she makes more money through big brands and media companies, she don't need this channel or her fans anymore.
I’m glad she is living her life how she wants to and not letting other people rule her. QUEEN!!!!!
I miss Emma :(
good soup
We love you Emma let’s us know your ok ❤️❤️

come back emma i miss you :(
Hi there stranger. You don't know me but I wanted to spread the good truth of Jesus Christ and I encourage that you stay and learn more❤✝️.  See God created the first of humankind and gave our first descendants dominion over the earth and things in it but we soon rebelled against God and so sin was born into the knowledge and actions of humankind. Thankfully enough we have the opportunity to rid ourselves of sin and reconcile with God the holy father through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ the son of God. He died on the cross for our sins and took the punishment we were supposed to receive, defeating sin in the process and freeing whosoever seeks salvation in him.. giving unto them a new and beautiful life with him as a born again child of God. I would love to see each and every single person on this earth receive salvation and avoid eternal damnation so I spread the good news in hopes that I can get as many people to repent and receive Christ before his second coming. The kingdom of God is near. I pray that who ever reads this considers a life in Christ and repents from the wickedness of this world before it's too late. We don't have much time. I urge you please get right with the one true living God.Jesus loves you and so do I <3 Be blessed my loves<\3 JOHN 3:15 -21 MARK 1:15❤
Emmmmmaaaa where are youuuuu
Is she dead….. she hasn’t posted in 4 months.
Ya'll watch this shit. damn.
That shit like this is so popular is a sign of the times... As she said herself, she doesn't know what the fuck she's doing... The reign of mediocrity just flabbergasts me... I DO know how to cook BTW...
I just loved this style of cooking vid!!
I used to cook my eggs on high too, LMAO.

CAN U PLEASE TALK ABOUT EATING DISORDERS ON UR ANYTHING GOES PODCAST??????❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
A happy ending
hi emma .. its been like 4 month alrdy. i hope yr okay. if anything’s wrong pls know your so strong ! ilysmm🤍
Oh! Emma, where are you??
Emma I missed you
I know you're on a break from YouTube right now and I really hope that you're having a good time and doing well. I come back to your channel everytime I'm sad and even though I've watched these videos multiple times they still somehow make me feel happy and put a smile on my face. Love & miss you 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
currently watching this video while crying. i want to make this soup i will try for sure. i miss your videos emma and i really hope you come back soon <3333
This is the utter horror she goes through daily in the kitchen while you are out merely slaying dragons. If you don't understand her confusion, her anxiety, the instant crying between "share sessions", the screeching coming from the laundry room, you are not alone.  PS (Throw in the dragon meat while she isn't looking). That's right, you "care".
miss u emma
please come back ;-;
emma will always be my comfort person, the way her vids and podcasts make me feel safe. we miss u emma!! hope you’re doing good <3
From this I learned low and slow is the way to go
I miss your videos Emma but I really hope you’re feeling well and are having fun doing whatever you’re doing right now ❤️
Emma is so relatable in her videos and I love it. I often spend many days in my apartment alone and so watching these videos makes me feel that I’m not alone. She has celebrity / semi-public life style so her showing us the everyday, normal things that we all do on a daily basis I think is amazing. Many YouTubers now a days want to make grand, extravagant videos for views, and that turns me off. I want to see the realness and trueness of others and Emma is one of the only YouTubers that actually does that.
time to binge watch old videos😼
i miss u :(
I love this video !!!! 💚😎😎😎
That's some good looking soup.
Emma when are you posting a new video? Im missing you
Did she leave this channel to start a cooking channel? She could be out here cooking on YouTube on a faceless channel and we wouldn't even know it. Marinade on that tho.
i miss you so much
onion and garlic cooking is the absolute best smell !?!
Best of luck to you in all of your journeys 💕 I hope you're taking the time and steps you need for your health 💕 I'd love to see you come back to YouTube at some point, but whenever you're ready 💕 love from, another burnt out 20 year old
damn…this just reminds me of what it’s like to be a 20 year old. Don’t miss it!
We miss u
Emma please post again we love you and your content so much
Sophia Roe's green soup has peas and basil and potato and is v good
Pointless existence.
New videos pls🤍
Emma who?
girl wake up
Even though Emma is gone, I always find myself watching her old videos and still feeling excited and engaged from watching a human being finding her way through life as a young adult. Emma’s videos will always be in my heart, as the funniest most relatable thing I have ever watch in my life. Her uplifting personality always will shine through the dark to enlighten me and make me feel more grateful for who I am and what I have in my life. Thank you Emma for the times that you gave us, to either make us feel more connected to you or to make us feel more appreciative for the life that we live. You are truly a gift, and I want you to never stop being you. We all believe that you can get through this confusing time in your life, because that’s who you are Emma. Your not a quitter, and you always seem to find ways to get back up on your feet. We will always be there for you, even if your not there for us. Keep doing you Emma, and I really hope to see you on the other side, and to see how much more you have evaluated from your break. Even if this takes as long as for me to become an adult, I will always be here to watch your next video. 💕❤️💕❤️💕💜💕💜💕❤️💕❤️
i miss u so much, i rewatched all your videos 😪😪💕💕

Emma i miss u :(
te extraño flaquita volve
You know, I think Emma found the purpose of a  life. I was thinking randomly and this thought just struck my mind...i know it's lame but what if Emma found a source of life beyond YouTube. I want to know what she's doing these days. I bet she has a new hobby, her content is getting more nostalgic (if I'm using the correct word here) everytime.
miss u emma❤️❤️
Am I really the only one that crying, because I miss Emma so BAD.  She litterally the reason I still breath now :(. I fucking miss u Emma.  I know u still upload the podcast and I'm so grateful for that. But still I miss u soooo bad, I love u forever
8 scene changes in 1 minute
i miss u emma :((
you soup is kinda very similar to an indian curry dish called " aaloo matar " where aaloo means potato and matar is peas .
babe please don't add hot stuff into your blender , it might break and also the blender probably is made of plastic
White people cooking be like:
Love u come back
Glad you're gone
Y’all need to chill tf out and let her be
I really like you Emma, you are so cool!!!!!
I miss her smmmm
I miss you SO much!!! I hope you're enjoying life and are incredibly happy! Much love ❤️
It's not cute to publicly exploit your fans Emma don't you think so?
Why did she make in such large quantity if she is the only one who is going to eat? Stop wasting food people! First world countries folks harm the environment the most. This is classic example.
imy emma
we miss you emma
I really miss you
Still waiting for my comfort person 💖
Your voice is sweet, did ur parents do that?
I rewatch all her old video cuz she didn’t post anymore:((
Emma, I just wanted to come on here and say how much of an inspiration you have been for me.  I adore your podcast.  You give such valuable advice that I apply to my daily life.  I always come back to these videos for comfort.  You are my comfort human.  Thank you for being that for me.  I know that doing YouTube is anything but easy and it can burn anyone out very easily.  Take your time.  If you, ultimately decide to be done posting on YouTube, that’s okay.  You have our continuous support in all of your endeavors, and we will look back on these videos as fond memories.  If you do however decide to come back, we will be waiting here with open arms, no matter how long that may be.  Love you. <3
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!
Miss u
I miss u Emma
Imy</3
Wait when did her voice not get raspy I was like who tf is this 😭
Guys i think shes moving house
emma i personally do not like peas but this soup and the way you explained every little detail of the cooking process made me think that this soup might be just so good despite all of the peas.
I miss emma
hope ur ok miss you
shit look good
Very nice knife. Now try one a little smaller.
You're Awakening to your calling, as to why you chose to incarnate on this planet. Keep on keeping on.⭐
Garbage vegan food.
miss u
girl we want a coachella vlog
I love how you rate your cooking that’s awesome we miss you Emma 💕
i get it that shes burnt out, really, i try to understand as much as i can and i couldnt even imagine standing in her footsteps. but even though i love her sm and have been watching her videos for over 4 years i cant help but have mixed feelings. most jobs are very exhausting and soooo many people all over the world get burnt out from work or get depressed but we dont have the privilege to quit.. we dont have the privilege to quit our job and have money enough to do these gigantic things like all the stuff she does, for example go to coachella, wear the most expensive designer outfits, travel the world, live in huge apartments from over millions. it sometimes kinda feels to me like she took the money and left us. im sorry but im just a bit upset because we as a fandom are the reason that emma is so succesful in life and we really need her to get through the day and speaking for myself emmas videos had such a big impact on my life and it brought me so much comfort and im just sad that thats gone. were the reason shes living the life every teenager dreams about because you really cant tell me doing photoshoots for louis vuitton, getting crazy amounts of money from working with big brands and meeting hundreds of big celebrities at these really cool events is a punnishment.. nobody has to agree with me but this is just how i feel. i really hope shes doing okay though because i care about her a lot so dont take this the wrong way.
is she ever gonna be back??
stop trying ti recreate your old viral video of u cooking whatever it was idc. EVERYBODY WANT TO KNOW WYY U SUCH A SLOOT ON INSTGRAM BUT ACT LIKE U A COMPLETDLY DIFFERENT B ON YOU TUBE???!!!
balik ka na pls:<
When she started out, her videos were great. Her videos are crap now. She obviously hates doing them. So, she should quit.
I miss u come back pls🥺
Emma we miss you girl 🥰 take ur time
I miss u and love u❤️
i miss you
the amount of peas in your soup made me want to throw up, i’m sure with was good if you like peas but i like a 100:1 pea ratio (the 1 being the pea)
i miss u emma
Today is the first day I’ve heard of emma chamberlain, wOw super beautiful human being one of the most genuinely amazing cooking videos I’ve eva watched, thanks emma U r a true savage….mucho corazon ❤️💛💚
i really miss emma.
i love you
I miss you.
im sorry did you just put a hot pot straight on the bench with no tea towel or mat underneath???
Damn...too rich to post weekly now....unsubscribe! ...sad.....🍔🍟
OH NO MOLDY SPROUTS WHO MUST I ATTACK LMFAOOO !!
I missed her videos :(
We're gonna wait patiently i just know shes gonna come back. just a few more weeks. i can understand she deserves this break if im being real honest.
I WAS HOPING TO SEE A GRWM FOR COACHELLA VIDEO 😩😩.
Why do people always waste their time trying to write comments knowing she isn't going to read them and answer. She is taking time off for her.
Thinking of you Emma, hope all is well 🤍
love you emma and miss u. forever waiting patiently 4 u just gonna binge ur old vids 😭😭
I understand you need a break. Hope everything is alright and enjoying life. Wish to hear from you soon
i miss u a lot
emma WHAT is going on
Emma is amazing in that she can just do the day to day stuff and people will watch to see what she is doing.  From doing vlogs I can say it is definitely fun but can be work at the same time.  Maybe she is just taking a break. She definitely inspired my husband and I to do travel vlogs.
ilysm emma<3 pls always take care, we just want you happy and healthy💘
was that st peters basilica in the back of the rooftop clip?
Add a crab to your soup.
i miss you emma

MASTERPIECE! lol i love the storytelling behind it
My friend saw you at coachella vip section and wanted to take a picture of your Outfit lmao apparently you just ignore people und you’re not as nice as you present yourself. Very disapointing. Even Bella Thorne was very nice and complimented them
emma i miss u so much
Your turn
we miss u ): hope ur doing well <3
She literally forgot that she has a YouTube channel lol
Anyone else wish that Emma was there mom like when she says she wants to have kids to cook for I said Emma pick me I’ll be your child
I was listening to your podcast, I think you should still make videos just have someone record you going on with your day. (:
loved this type of content, so pure and intimate, kind of like a podcast i would listen to when anxiety kicks in, cooking makes it go away for me and have a positive reinforcement, seems like you enjoy it too so keep it up!❤️
come back please ❤
Saudade ❤
we miss you bestie
miss you, hope you’re smiling! 🤍
Emma we miss you, hope everything is ok. We love u 🤍
😁🤞
emma.
Wilt Chamberlain
Miss you
Emmita when we are going to see you again? Bad girl  &)

we miss u, emma. all the love.
i miss her so much.
coachella vlogs?
as much as i miss emma, i am glad shes taking a break from yt so she could rest
I miss you Emma.
I miss you
It is life. Everybody has to keep on with their lives no matter what possible absence of smth or somebody has to occur.
Emma, your YouTube channel is the most epic coming-of-age movie I've ever watched.
miss u emma
where are you emma
Hey Emma. Just wanted to say that it feels weird to go to sleep without watching your videos before bed. It was my favorite kind of ritual I made for myself. I hope you are allright and I just want to say I really really miss your videos :(
Yeah haven’t heard from your page in a while. I’ve been waiting for an upload
miss you emma. hope things are getting better>3
Imagine she really doesn’t boil peas and potatoes and actually has a hired full time chef. 💭But to make content she actually has a 2nd YouTube house where she “lives her YouTube life” for 20 min a video. Idk Its interesting
brah
I miss you
Miss you love you support you . stay healthy and happy queen ♥️💋
four months :(
are you okay?
Emma I really miss you </3 (like I think we all need a forehead kiss) . Like even if it’s just you making coffee
I miss u
i love you emma
we miss u emma hope ur doing okay
Emma you are perfect in every aspect! 💖💖
اشهد ان لا اله الا الله واشهد ان محمد رسول الله
emma where are you we need you!
Love you your thee best❤️😍🥰
Are you going to coachella??
i miss her, I hope she’s okay and loving her best life. I see her chasing the bag tho
I miss you
I'm regrowing my hair.
Miss your sass. Back in the saddle. Metaphor, get the band back together, and the Mermaid concept makes everything come together. Not arressted, don't get arressted. Please. Back to emma.
HELP IM REWATCHING THIS FOR THE 4TH TIME
WHERE IS EMMA😭😭😭😭
We miss you Emma! I hope you’re doing well and enjoying your YouTube break❤️
I miss you and your videos emma i hope you're okay😕❤
Come back soon, stop smoke weed, it is hurting u
please come back Emma
i miss her sooo much
Reminds me of split pea soup.
I miss you Emma
I feel like I havent lived after this last video anymore
Emma I miss u, upload new video plz🥺🥺🥺🥺
Emma WHERE THE FUCK have you beeeeeeen?!?!?!?  Miss ur videos. Hope life is good
I don’t know why ppl are saying this isn’t creative. She’s eating, being calm, and taking care of herself while making something. Whether she is coming across as her vivacious self or not in the recent vids doesn’t mean this isn’t self-care at its finest. Sometimes when you’re in “go mode” for a long time you need time to focus on yourself and reorient for a little bit. :)
where did u go
she rly produced a whole steaming bowl of diarrhea and then dipped absolute legend o7
i miss you so much emma ily never forget that 💕
am I the only one who prefers her podcast?
You were my therapist I need you 😭😭😭😭😭
Emma bitch we miss you 😩😫😭😭😭😭😭
✨I hope you're all good! ✨
The editing of her new vids reminds me of napoleon dynamite
Hey it is cool that you tons of breaks be cuz it make your videos more chariachable and funner  and I hope this is not creepy more happy.
we miss youuu hope u r okay <3333
hi emma, i hope your doing well <3

We miss you Emma, I love the podcast dont get me wrong, but I miss yo face friend.

Emma, you deserve the world, I hope u ok ✨❣️
Hey Emma. Haven’t heard from you in a bit. I love you, and I hope everything is okay❤️
Feel exactly the same way about cooking and going out to eat too. Me having a kid made me realize I need to make more than cereal lol
Umm did Putin capture u? Humanity is bored save us Emma.
we miss u em <3
Hey em, havent heard from u in a while r u good
i miss u so much emma
Emma, you are an amazing person! I'm so glad you shared so much with the world. I know you talked about the pressure of YT and some existential things you are going through and we all respect that so so much. Everyone just needs you to be okay girl! <3
‘I don’t know if the rancid smell came from me itching my armpit or from the shallot, um’ *pauses for a whole minute* ‘anyway’
Why is Emma talking about how to boil potatoes so entertaining to me? At this point I think she could make a 20 minute video of herself watching paint dry and I would still watch it
miss u baby <3
Totally unrelated but I listened to your podcast on spotify and I just wanted to say that the kindle have the option to let you overlay a word and look it up for a definition. Sorry if this doesn't make any sense. Have a great day
It may sound weird but I made a playlist of your vlogs and podcasts then play it so I can sleep. I miss you Emma😿
Post more emmm miss h
i miss u
I miss you :(
This is such a great video
We need YOU, and miss YOU.
💔💔💔💔💔💔
i love you emma 💓
Pea soup with basil. Good job 👏🏻
It’s Emma’s $17 Soup
I think it might be interesting to add some peas into the blend mix for color and texture, maybe spinach or something too
Hey girl I miss you 🥺❤️ I hope you’re okay and keep blossoming. I know shits hard, I’m on the edge myself. Or maybe you’re having such a great time in life right now that you’re so in the moment. I hope that’s it. I hope to see you soon ✨
I miss you Emma, but take as long as you need for yourself. Come back when you are really ready 😙☺️💙
How cool would it be if she went to university to study film

Emma, where have you been?? WE MISS YOU ✨🤍💌
Come back pls :(
I remember the times when every Monday after school I would rush back home just to watch Emma’s new video while eating lunch, I guess that’s the only reason why I don’t hate Monday
why you wearing a coat and shorts
So that was a real bye huh 11:53 😣
We miss your videos Emma. But keep doing you. You always have our support. ❤️
To the person reading this, you’re absolutely amazing and wonderful! God is SO great! God is SO real!! God bless you!!! God bless everyone!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Where r u emma
Emma is the only person who make feel happy 24/7.
Honestly that soup looks delicious.
i love you so much <3
Podcast ft. Video
i miss you bub
And they said nobody could pea soup
coming back for the 100th time
I miss her so bad
Yummy yummy food on my hand s .I love onion and garlic girrrlllllllll!!!!😛🥰
I laugh so hard when Emma is trying to put on the lid onto the blender for four times, ly emma ！
Miss you already
It’s a little bit weird for me how americans don’t have that same contact with food as latin americans, I never learned how cook I just always knew bc it’s insanely natural to me, and seems like that in us people don’t have the same contact with food, everything just seems highly industrialized and they just don’t know the wonderful of a typical food that taste like home and reminds you of you mom and your grandmother, etc. I’m not here judging anyone, it’s just a culture  shock you know?  Also that soup seems delicious, and you did perfectly well, that vídeos kinda made me want to be your best friend and teach how to cook everything possible bc cooking for yourself it’s the best feeling ever.  ps: everyone make mistakes in the kitchen once in a while and have to eat something that taste really bad hahahahah even my grandma
you ok haven’t posted in 3 months
I miss you
why are you yelling at me about onions and garlic lol
tip: if you want to avoid the sticky smelly aftermath of chopping garlic, use a disposable glove.
hope you're doing okay Emma, take all the time you need <3
Keep healing my love we'll wait😘
Back please
I hope all is well Emma, ​​we all love you and want you back!
where are you Emma I miss you :—(

i care abt the milk and cheese fact bc ive been like that my whole life not knowing why!!
I’m not even kidding, but I ran into Emma a few days ago! I had no idea it was Emma because it was a second of viewing, but I recognized her by her height🤣. I wish I had the bravery to say hi! But since I could not do it in NY in person, let me do it over YouTube. Glad to know u r doing good Emma! 😜😎🤩❤️
God loves you, hope all is well!
MAKE A MOVIEEE
Tysm emma for helping me with my life you've really help me understand that life Is not perfect.but take all the time you need to rest and care for you're self and we all hope you are doing ok and you are safe and sound but ty for an era.
I disliked by accident and idk why I panicked😅
Okay I thought it was a little weird how the screen was black the whole video… Only now to realize that I don’t think that was normal.
How come she dont upload vids again
emma comeback :--(
WHERE R U😞
Can someone introduce me Emma kinda vibe youtuber? But for real tho.
Every now and then, I have days like today. My head is too heavy to lift from my pillow, and my eyes well-up before they've even opened. The sun obnoxiously takes space in my mind, and my alarm screams at me to get my shameful self up and go to class. I turned it off today, and I slept through my 8:00am lesson.   I know I'm just one in a billion and my story isn't exactly relevant. But, I finally decided to wipe my face and leave the house. Only because I knew I would feel so guilty if I stayed in bed all day with pitiful tears streaming down my cheeks, watching sad Tik-Toks. I drove myself to Starbucks and ordered my favorite drink, hoping it would help. I parked in an open parking-lot to watch the clouds, stirring my Macchiato... My passenger seat felt extra empty today. My best friend has recently drifted away without warning, and without anything to cause it. I've been feeling so lonely, and it feels like nothing matters without her. Class has been so hard to show up to, and music has suddenly grown this dull sound. I've been burnt-out before, but never because of this. If anything, I'm just so tired from the anxiety that my stupid anxious attachment style is enduring.   I know it's not your exact situation, and I don't relate completely, but I understand needing a break. It feels like you need to sleep for 10 years, and withdraw yourself from life periodically. And even then, it won't feel like enough and you'll wake up to the same exhausting feeling. And on top of all of that, having to mask your raw emotions for the people who look up to you, despite the permanent hot rock in your stomach, is the thing that will hurt more than any traumatic experience.   I listened to your podcast as the Sun carefully hid behind the horizon, and again, you've helped me through one of the hardest times of my life. You deserve someone who does the same for you. Your mental health and wellness matters so much more than a video, or a voice recording.   We love your videos and podcasts, of course, but we love YOU more.   Please, PLEASE... Choose peace, always. Only do what makes you happiest, and please don't ever feel like you need to explain. Here's some advice I wish I could take myself... You are in control, Emma. Not us, not YouTube, not your friends, not your family, YOU are in control.   We love you, and we understand inevitably. <3
i miss you emma!
Miss ya Emma, hope you’re doing good I’ve watched this video 4 times please post a new video when you have time 💕💕

She is having a much needed vacation. I totally get that and when you come back with drops of Jupiter in your hair I expect a coffee because you make the best soy latte I've never had.
Missing you

extraño a emma
Hi Emma hope you are doing well miss you and your content
imy
i dont love onion & garlic but i'll take it if you say so emma
Emma it's been long since you posted i hope you're okay and come back soon
Emmmmmmaaaaaa I neeeddd you
imy emma :(
why do i feel like american kids don’t know anything when it comes to, basic knowledge, culture and cooking? I think it’s cute that she realised its fun for her but i can only shake my head when i see her philosophising about the most normal thinks that she found out and thinks it’s so special.
Emma, stop whining and just do your job: make you mediocre vlogs for us.  They are not art but we love them anyway.  You are not Tarentino, Scorcese, or Kubrick so stop beating yourself up over crafting perfect films.  All Youtubers are imposters but we don't care.  You all remind us that being mediocre is ok.
Emma where did you goooo 💗💗💗💗
Without Emma’s videos I actually feel so sad like she would get me moving she is literally my friend and I miss her 😭
hey emma im writing from my tree house its 3 months and you havent answered through the line can are you ok?
https://youtu.be/cgtxdMSCjZk Bwekfast!
The soup looks so good!! I noticed that you left your silicone ladle in the hot liquid - you may want to take it out and rest it somewhere else next time because plastic products shouldn’t be exposed to too much heat for toxin reasons. Just a quick tip that, I fully recognize, nobody asked for. Just in case it’s helpful!
Miss u emma
Omg please bring back the forehead kisses Emma. They were literally what got me up in the morning.
if you take the clove of garlic and smash it down with the base of your palm while the garlic's rounded part facing the table it will be really easy to peel
Missing your vlogs Emma, come back when your ready <3
rewatching emmas videos just to feel something </3
miss u emma!
WE GIVE YOU TEARS?

I’m waiting for Emma’s cook book
she updated her yt pfp lol but doesn't plan on posting.. also I listened to her podcast ep and I completely think she shld take a break :) , its just weird to think that shes been to like 7 different places since she posted this  also she discontinued forehead kisses with her new style of editing :/

You make me feel so less alone, thank you Emma
I just discovered emma from her podcast few days ago and she's literally changed my life, her adviced really help me a lot and her voice makes me calm. She's also the reason why I became productive and motivated. I hope she's doing okay rn and safe, I love her so much I hope she'll read this. ILY emma <33
If Emma ended up making this into a cooking channel, that would be perfect timing because I'm about to move out and need to make food for myself every day

Came here after listening to the podcast ep. the truth abt YouTube. 🌸
miss your videos :(
Bouillon is pronounced "boo-yaw" The "n" is silent. It is a french word :))) <3
QUICK TIP FROM A CULINARY STUDENT!!! When chopping most things I use a hair pick! Just a regular like 2 dollar pick. It is honestly a game-changer. It makes chopping super quick and you don't have to worry about cutting your fingers. Also lets not forget that you get super even knife cuts. I love using It when I am going to pickle things, I remember from a previous video you pickle carrots often. Also in culinary school we learn that being a great chef is all about how to control HEAT! I also used to struggle because I figured if the heat was on high then it would cook faster, but I have learned to be patient and that good things take time. I hope this message finds you and if it does I hope you try it out and make something DELICIOUS!! stay sweet :) <3
bae come back ☹️
emma come back we miss you
You´re amazing <3 miss u
Baaaaaaaaack

EMMA WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAKE ANOTHER VIDEO NOWW
I miss u emma
you dont understand how sad I am now that emmas gone...
Apparently, Emma thinks everyone here is a crybaby now. (RE: her new profile pic)
miss u :(
she changed her profile pic, does this mean she's close to coming back??
i miss you
bowl o' peas
Emma we miss you so much please come back soon I love you so much❤️
You guys she’s not quitting youtube but rather she’s taking a long break, she just said it not her podcast❤️ plus on her latest one she said she’s actually moving in to her permanent house, must be the reason why shes taking longer.
I dont know if im the only one bugged by all the comments telling her to go back to her old content but i think its better to let her show how she is changing as a person and not have her being stuck doing the same thing for years. people need to grow and its healthy to let her work grow as she does even though we all will miss the old content, it will always be there
The new profile pic is dope😂
emma pls do like a 1 minute clip of u clarifying that ur not leaving 💀 tea channels have made it seem like ur leaving when in fact you have talked about just taking a long break over ur podcast
Emma you haven't posted in a while but you changed your profile pic when are the videos coming??
I miss you
HER NEW PROFILE PIC🥰🥰🥰🥰

Its sad that Emma is not making weekly videos but i also understand she needed to take a break for her mental heath and it is good she is doing whats most right for her. We will always love you Emma and will be here waiting if u ever post again. (: (p.s you can get the full story on why she is taking a break on her podcast (anything goes with Emma Chamberlain)
Just for those worried about her... she's fine. She's done with youtube, she said it on her podcast.

We miss you !!!
@emmachamberlain TO remove garlic & onion smell from your hands after chopping them use salt or lemon juice & rub all over your hands especially the fingers that touched them most. Rinse & NO SMELL! I usually put just a drop of water...& JUST a drop, with the salt.
Dear Emma I missed your video so much since you stoped posting your videos I stopped drinking iced coffee in the morning I stopped having a Matcha latte you were a source of inspiration you had such an inspiring videos that I was happy to see like it was so satisfying I hope I really hope that you will come back to you tube I just saw the that you were in Paris so maybe you gonna just make a Vlog of you hope that you are doing great stay safe 🤍🥲

VOLTAAAAA EMMAAAAAAAA
FOR ANYONE WONDERING WHERE EMMA IS⬇️⁉️  Emma talked about it in her podcast (Anything Goes) that she feels burnt out by the amount of pressure she has to make weekly videos. She’s been doing YouTube consistently since she was 16 …which is quite a long time if you ask me. The pressure has taken a toll on her mental health (depression & anxiety) and till she feels there’s a way to deal with YouTube in a more healthier way (without putting so much pressure on herself and feeling like she needs to record all the time) she is taking time off. Whether it takes days, weeks, months, years. This is understandable. It happens to a lot of YouTubers where the pressure takes a huge toll on their mental health. She talked about always feeling like she needed to be happy so her viewers would be happy. That if she was sad or depressed she would cause her viewers to as well feel the same. Or how she would as well have to look good or look a certain way for her videos. But when it comes to her podcast she feels more comfortable being honest about her mental health, more vulnerable, she doesn’t have to look good to be on camera, how she could do it from the comfort of her own bed. She basically didn’t want to feel like she was lying about her happiness & mental health by acting like everything was okay on camera. Nor did she want to record her low times and makes us feel sad.   I think it’s best we support her decision, DO NOT pressure her to come back soon, she needs this. Allow her to heal, take her time, and focus on her. She is still doing her podcasts (Anything Goes) and working on her Coffee Business. The best we could do is show her love and support her.   Thank you for taking a break Emma, you need it. Do not rush the healing process, and do not worry about us. True supporters will understand. Mental health always comes first. 🤍
i miss you
Guys you should listen to her podcast 😭😭
BenOfTheWeek predicted that Emma would get into soups…….

Good evening, unfortunately I don't know your name.  Today I dared to write to several bloggers, and also let me turn to you, I will be brief. As you probably know, in connection with the outbreak of war in our country, in Ukraine, I live in Kherson, we were left without work. I'm not going to ask anyone for financial help, including you, please, my request, if you want to help, then please, you can call on your audience to support the development of my channel, and thanks to advertising, we will have the necessary funds to existence, of course, if we survive here ..  I certainly don't claim to be very high quality content, but I sincerely tried to do my best in my circumstances. Although, to be honest, I am addressing you with great shyness, since you have a large audience)) My appeal to you, you can ignore, delete, respond! I will be deeply grateful to you! Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read my request! I sincerely wish you success and a peaceful sky above your head!!
we miss you Em
emma i miss u come back pls
you DESERVE this break, we jus wish you the best emma, take care of yourself and your mind, we hope ur doing fine, love you so much
hope ur doing fine emma, we love you and support you <3
Guys if you miss Emma and want to stay up to date with her and continue support go to her podcast called “Anything Goes”! It’s free to listen to!! As much as I miss her videos I’ve really enjoyed the podcast and she sounds so much happier!!!! She uploads every Thursday!!!

"Why Grandmas are into this shit." 😂😂😂
voiceover emma: "...and I was really excited." video emma: 😐😐
Oh no it’s so hard being an adult with a job I think I’m depressed …
Another week she didn't make a video. How long will it take before she does. I'm becoming a little impatient lol. But really taking the time you need for a mental break is good. So take all the time you need. I can't wait for you to come back though.
Hi
i love emma she’s so humble and beautiful
2:20 i dunno why but that single green pea made me laugh.
I miss you. How’s your life goin?
We miss you so much and just hope that you’re okay and safe ❤️✨ love you xxx
An end of an era, thanks Emma for the years of joy you've given us
Emma's done YouTube for a while now. Her fans can do without her posting videos for a while. Hope she's looking after herself and taking a good break.
You look like Timothee chalamet
I know you have retired from YouTube now but I really miss you and you saved my life so many times. We love you Emma 💗
Miss you, i hope I see you again soon and feel better if there’s anything going on
I feel like this channel is like a tv series, to the point that u can't wait to watch the next one... basically it's addicting asf uk????
Aw Emma I love you I’ve been watching you since you had 20k subscribers ,you have been my favourite content creator since 8th grade and with time I continued to love you more and more , I hope you are doing alright but whatever you have next in store I will always tune in ❤️🫂

DO NOT feel guilty for taking a break Emma don’t you dare. You are a fucking human, you deserve this don’t you dare listening to frustrated, envious people. Do not compare yourself especially when others are making you do that. And this goes for anyone reading this including my own self. Let’s remember this seriously.🙏🏻
we miss u emma
emma are you alive 😭
Hi Emma I hope your doing great! Your videos make me so inspired to become a successful women like you, you also incouraged me to get off my phone to do something like cook, or workout, or go on a walk. Take as much time as you need to get through whatever it is you might be going through at the moment and just know we will always be here for you no matter what! I love watching your videos they make me feel less lonely at times. Once again I hope your doing great and I am so looking forward to seeing you again! 😊
hope you're feeling okay emma <3

emma, it's been less than a week of me getting to know you through your yt videos and finally feeling like someone in this world gets me and my thoughts. i've watched almost all of ur vids that've been posted within the last yr which has led me to learn so much about u. i've also learned that you'll be taking a break from yt and i can't help but think how my time being on ur channel has been so short. however, it doesn't take much to understand what you've been through and why ur taking time off. i hope u take as much time as u need to heal and in the meantime i'll catch u on ur podcast <3
I tried the same https://youtu.be/I_HF_GIwGW8

Just wanna get something off my chest that I will always love emma chamberlain and totally understand if she needs a break from youtube or any platform she has, emma chamberlain will always be a part of my teenage years, I've watched her develop into a grown person, and also rest well emma!!
i just listened to your last podcast upload, and I hope you know we will stay here and we love you!!
You need to start posting more on here
hey its been months i hope ur ok baby.
I came to the comments to see if anyone else liked the soup but all I could find was people expressing how much they miss you and/or support your need for distance from this platform, etc. But I just really wanna say that soup sounds so fucking good 🤤 I know you don't eat meat but throw a roast in that bih youd have yourself a bussin stew lmao
She got my respect even more than ever, when she said she hates wasting food, that’s actually a good thing. Love it

Love you Emma. Thank you for all the content that you put out over the years. <3
come back queen :(
when is she going to upload more on YouTube
Dear, Emma from Podcast Feb24/22, being very deep inside the topic of "YouTube" it maybe stopping you from seeing that CONTENT never mattered...vlogs, cooking, hauls, pranks...No one ever truly cares of those - they come and go. It's all about the person and the feeling it leaves in you.  You are special and different and you have true filming and editing talent. With an editing class, you can be faster and cut down editing time but you are on a really good creative path brought by boredom and burnouts and whatnot. I choose this video because it's genius - the moment that the soup was ready and the music and the green, and that cut with the two pots that you are adjusting the camera - so franking moody! I felt like watching a movie...you are asking yourself what is the future of youtube and here it is...you are making it. And this one was much like podcast movie. yeah, I wish you good, trust your gut;) heh
😋
You succeed YouTube because you are amazing and funny and cool so I hope you will be come back sometimes. YouTube without you feels empty
You are successful because you are loved everything about you is either funny or cool I hope you will be posting sometimes 💗💗💗💗❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️paola and Nono

Emma i hope you ok we miss you hope to see you soon😔🥺
Girl watching your recent stuff made me really feel like I was growing up with you when you first started YouTube. We’re around the same age and I’m just a random person in your comments section but you’ve always been so relatable for a lot of us. I find your videos endearing and good vibes all around. :D You’ve always been so open with everything, it’s nice to see real vulnerability vs other YouTubers who are a train wreck for views on purpose. We are you core supporters here! Been here since the beginning. Lots of love ❤️
never heard of you before. suddenly heard your name 3 times this week.
This is the , " We miss you Emma" button ❤
i love u emmaa
not gonna lie this soup gives me Bulgarian food vibes cuz my grandma makes potato and pea soup hahaha. you should look up bulgarian food try to make something cuz i think youll like it
In India we call this matar aloo sabji
BITCH I MISS YOU SO MUCH COME BACKKKK
Hi Emma, I've recently listened to your podcast about youtube and I just wanted to say I don't think your subscribers have any problem with you not uploading once a week or following some sort of schedule. According to your comment section I think most people are just happy whenever you upload no matter the timing!!  I've been watching your most recent videos repeatedly lately, they're really the perfect vlogs and so soothing. I hope you will find the balance to upload in the future without this insane pressure. I do miss your uploads and will patiently wait for the next one❤❤
Perhaps making at home chicken and basil broth at home would get you that color
Emma🥲 I am a big fan of yours..❤️ I love your video and everything! Also, I miss your video a lot🥲 Please come back emma..❤️I will be waiting for you! I always get healed by you! Thanks a lot😊✨
i miss your videos emma, hope you’re doing well 🤍
Emma lost it
Why this video is too emotional ??! I was about to cry 🙂
another sunday without emma..
miss you emma. hope your doing well
Should i consider this a dead account now?
I love her personality. It's soo unique that there isn't a word in the dictionary ti describe it
Why is she not uploading anymore..? I miss her.
emma come back ily and miss you, hope you’re doing okay ❤️
Someone who has struggled with Ed, this is concerning and worry some, how stressful it is that she wants everything to be perfect and can’t have it a certain way. I hope you are doing better and continue to try to do better
EMMA CHAMBERLAIN PLEASE MAKE A VLOG WITH YOU GOING ON A COFFEE FAST!!! WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT! NO COFFEE FOR 24 HRS!!!
The fact that emma’s  videos are so raw and yet put together like she’s also her real self and not at all embarrassing aahhh just the main character energy we all need in our lives 🥵
Brasil te ama   Emma.

I miss you
you haven’t posted anything in 2 months im getting incredibly bored without your videos  Edit: 3 months 😭😭
I listen to your podcast on Spotify and I wish there was a comment section for each episode! I’m always catching myself wanting to respond back or add a lil tidbit when I listen to your podcast. I love your podcast and I feel like we’re friends now (lol) because it just feels like a good conversation between friends. Anyway, I wanted to finally express this to you somehow, somewhere. I love the new podcast cover photo thing (absolutely no idea what it’s called) and it’s exactly how I pictured it looks when you record. Thanks for lifting my spirits each week. xx

I hope you're getting the break you needed and if that's what you need go for it ! We look forward to hearing about you and your new hobby. Who knows maybe you are preparing for a fun new cooking show, good luck, much love!<3
Rub your hands on the silver appliances in your kitchen and it takes the onion gross smell off immediately. Sounds untrue but it’s 100% true lol

I watched it over and over I miss you so much

Hey miss u
Hey Emma, I just finished listening to your most recent podcast episode and wanted to come here and tell you something. I’ve been watching your videos since day one. And since then, I’ve always felt like a parent watching my daughters channel. And just like parents have to realize with kids is that nothing will last forever. What I mean by that is this channel has always felt like a chapter of you. And no matter how long this chapter lasts, everyone who watches your videos will be here and remember you always when it’s over. What I am trying to say is that you need to take as much time as you need for yourself, even if that means never returning to YouTube. We all love and adore you and are so incredibly proud of the successful woman you have become and will continue to be. So Emma, please focus on things that are fulfilling right now, because what’s important is that you are proud of what you are doing. And if you are proud of your creations, then we will obviously love them because they are a reflection of you.
We miss you ❤️
The way I miss u so much.. I hope you’re well.. I check for your videos everyday. Don’t let the world stress you though of course.🤍🙏🏼
We miss you Emma. Hope you're doing ok ❤

Emma i miss u :(
Hi Emma, I had an assignment for english to write a descriptive essay about someone we look up to or who has had an influence, we  have to publish it somewhere and since i wrote it about you; i hope you enjoy it. Here it is:   Have you ever had someone you wanted to be like? To embody and leave joy with everyone you interact with? My person is Emma. Emma has a lot of friends. She leaves an impact everywhere she goes. Emma is 20 years old. She was born on May 22nd, 2001. Emma is a Gemini!    Emma has a youtube channel with 11 million subscribers! You can call her famous! She started the youtube channel at 16! Emma spent an entire summer starting her channel, a video every day. By the end of the summer, she had grown her channel with a ton of videos and new subscribers! This is when I found her! This is when Emma really showed her love for photography and fashion. She would make videos with her friends going to take photos in front of the sunrise and bring outfits to showcase on her Instagram and online. They didn’t only take sunrise photos, but they were clothing-focused.   Emma was a really good student while going to a private catholic all-girls school. Emma opens up about graduating early out of high school when youtube was doing amazing and starting to get profitable. Recently she has stated that the reason she did that, was because she was a good student. Emma had all her high school credits in 10th grade. The classes she was in were for college credits and preparedness.   After that emma really started to get big. She started making different content like cooking videos and vlogs with her mom and even other friends with channels.  They made videos together going places and making jokes. Emma has since distanced herself from them because they didn't treat her the best.   	Emma and her family go on a trip together every year. They go and visit Maine and her grandparents. This is where Emma had fun. Her grandmother set up an entire fake fan asking for a picture to make Emma happy. She was so surprised someone knew her from her channel. Emma was so ecstatic about this. She started taking it extra seriously because she had fans now!   Shortly after this Emma started looking for apartments in LA to live in. She found a cute loft apartment and moved in! Her mom is seen going through the apartment with her and helping her move in. After a few weeks, she went back home. Emma once again got two more friend groups after this that didn't exactly treat her well. Emma has opened up about their bullying and ill-words.  	Emma has her own coffee business, which is very successful. She sells cold brews and regular coffee beans. This is because early on you can see her affliction for coffee. Emma regularly makes coffee in her videos. Coffee is basically Emma's life force.   	Emma has a beautiful home. She knows how to decorate a house to feel like home. The way she makes money for this is through brand deals and her company. People who have employed her include, Louis Vuitton, Audible, and many others.	   Emma is really an outstanding woman. I hope to be like her one day, intelligent, funny, hard-working, and successful. Emma really has it all at her fingertips and has so much influence. I hope she sees how many of us look up to her.
Привет)Всем привет) Мне просто нравится, когда приходит уведомление «У вас появился новый подписчик», меня это делает очень счастливым!!! Всем счастья и добра!!!) спасибо) круто что живем в одном городе!) спасибо за вашу активность!

Would you try hand feeding a baby parrot like a parakeet or love bird. I might try to do that if I could get one that young from a breeder.

Do you ever take cooking classes? Maybe you could try a cooking basics class so you could learn about knife skills and such 😊 the best way to learn is lots of practice.  You always appear comfortable in the kitchen on camera lol 😊
Does anyone else just miss her
i miss you
❤❤
Emma’s next video is “I wrote a cook book” 🙌🏻
Emma, what are you doing? Where is the new video?
Just want to say thank you for being here and creating this outlet for us. I can’t bare to watch other channels on my bad depression days because they’re just so fake and happy and optimistic and it makes me sick to my stomach. Thank you for having this safe place for us to have you, relax with you, and just have a reminder we’re in it together. Love you em!
Love you em
that was a whole ass emotional experience there i really want to make that soup now.... i found this channel or uh you at the start of this year, even though id heard about it i started listening to the podcast n stuff :) im ngl this made me laugh more than expected sjskdjkd 17$ i think ive started to appreciate peas much more because of this tyty
Yes Emma don't know about others but I love Onion and garlic, and all the herbs and spices and I do use them everyday (may be I'm Indian) they are good and make everything delicious  :)
hope you’re doing ok, and also hope you come back soon :(
I can’t cope with my stress anymore we need u emma ur my solution
emmmaaaa why haven't you posted
Come. Back. 😫
who knew cooking w emma would get this sophisticated
It never ceases to amaze me that trash content on yt gets this many views, amazing
Emma we miss you I hope you are well and doing okay. Sending love! Hope to see you soon (on video)
cooking with emma has come a long way! we're proud of you too !
the way this woman manages to avoid spreading awareness for ANY sort of global or social issue. but can make a video about the pros and cons of eating out at a restaurant and green pea soup.
Girl are u okay? Will you ever come back to us 😭
miss you sm emma. Take as much time as you need. We want you always happy and healthy, like the emma we always knew. you're amazing no matter what you do, don't forget this. ❤❤
i hope she’s ok
I know you won't read this but I just wanted to leave this comment. Due to Covid I developed social anxiety and I get highly emotional. Your videos are one of the reasons why I am fighting to overcome my fears and to literally give a sh*t about what other people think and to do stuff on my own, like take myself out for coffee. This week I started to take walks on my own to enjoy the weather. Today I overcame my anxiety and went to a local café alone to work on some uni projects. I hope that one day my next step will be to travel alone to another city or country. I am slowly learning to treat myself like a friend that is fun to hang out with. <3 Thank you!
Emma should travel trying different coffee shops and rating them
You alright girl? We miss you 😅
this is my comfort channel
missing u
I miss her so much.
It’s been two months now, i hope ur doing okay. i love you
You cure my bordem

We are waiting for you to come back, miss you so much😖 hope everything is okay, take a break emma❤
miss u emma, especially your old content but you have grown lots.
Emma it has been a moment since you uploaded, I'm not gonna be selfish and tell you how hard is it not living a day with you at the end of my week, I'm just gonna tell you that I have anxiety too and I have been dealing with it sense the first day that I can remember, I know how hard it can be and how bad it gets, but I will ask you not to be hard on yourself you are a good person and It's okay to be sad or not feeling motivated to even get up from your bed but it is never okay to loose hope. take break from every ting as much as you want but you have to come back to your goal whatever that goal is. I wish this comment will help you and I wish your doing good
are we just gonna ignore the fact that she didn't upload a video in 2 GODDAMN MONTHS??????????????
Hope everything is okay love and miss you Emma ❤️

Jesus is coming so, so soon, don’t ignore the signs! Jesus says🤍: “Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.‘’ so believe in Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, (He’s God human form), trust ONLY in His sacrifice to be saved from hell, and ask God for forgiveness of your sins. If you do all of this and truly mean it you will become ‘born-again’ meaning you will love what is right and hate what is evil and you will repent of your sins which only God can help you do (repent means to be sorry for your sins and stop doing them) Even after this sometimes we can fall into sin and we just need to ask God for forgiveness and be truly sorry  God bless you <3 “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me.”
Are you okay Emma? You haven’t posted in a while😕❤️

I’m so proud of you and so proud of how far you have came. Feel like that sounds weird but anyway 😅♥️🥰
I miss u dude! I'm worried cause of the dissociation you once talked about. I hope your mental health is on its way to better days. Thinking of you!
i'd eat the shit outta that soup
I miss the weekly vlogs Emma, love u so much<3 pls come back soon
Dude you’re the only one on the Internet who can just narrate what you’re doing and have us pissing ourselves laughing the whole time.
Emma. Quit. It's time. Do something that makes you happy everyday. You have an audience the size of the world. You can come back and they'll always welcome you at any time. The key to success is progress. Don't think twice about doing the next thing. Make it something you love, and pour your damn heart into it. Your personality and your honesty is what people relate to. You give women a voice to let them know who they are inside is ok. That personality will sell forever, regardless of looks or age. Beautiful is built, always.
Girl we miss you
Hi Emma, We haven't heard from you in awhile but take all the time off that you need. You deserve it. I just want you to know that you have helped me and lots of other people so so much and watching your videos is my favourite time of the week. Love you Emma. <3
Did i just watch her make a soup for 12 min….. and liked it
Tips for anyone who never made a soup: smash the vegetables (not so much, just a bit) after you put them into the soup (if you cook them separate. You can cook them with the soup itself, it's the same, you save water and time). The soup gets creamy and the flavor from those vegetables is more present and you don't get so much floating food around. You also do not need to put the soup into a blender. If you're adding any leaf you don't have to cut it in order to give the soup their flavor, unless you really want to eat those so you cut it. Add the leaves, cut or not, when it's almost done like 2 minutes left and cook them with the soup for those left tiny minutes. It gets the same flavor and you don't have to lose cooking time nor time washing a blender.
Bro we miss youuuuuu
we miss you😭😭
me eating my eggs that i cooked on high heat while watching this video👁👄👁
Where is Emma's voice crack?
is emma pulling a bestdressed😭😭😭 help
where r u
Where are you shawty?
Miss u em 🥺
Can we all just take a minute to appreciate the calming quality of this video. Thank you, Emma. As a highschool student racked with studying and stress and all that fun stuff, this made my night <3
Waiting for a new video. 😥 ❤️
hi emma come back <3
I hope your ok it’s been awhile since you posted :(
Emma, I have been watching you for a long time, but couldn’t comment because it was my partners iPad. I am a big fan of your work. YOU are amazing! Finally, I got my own Gmail account (I’m growing up) and am now able to make comments and… have my own YouTube channel!  Yup. I’m 65 years young and just started a site three days ago. I just now saw you on an interview and commented,. I didn’t know if you would get it since it wasn’t your channel.   I had noticed you weren’t posting… and I suspected you might be taking a break or could possibly be burnt out. I was hoping you weren’t terribly ill or injured. Yet, burn out can feel like an injury or illness of sorts. It kind of is… you worked so hard for so long, putting out and entertaining literally to millions of people for a very long time! That is unheard of in other entertainment venues.   I hope you will take as much time off as you need and, want. It may end up being years and that’s okay, especially in the scheme of things and in your life.  Hang in there! Let yourself be - and in time… the tide will turn.
I check every day after school to see if she posts :( i miss u Emma. If ur taking a mental health break pls take as much time as u need. We love you
If you wanted a more vibrant green you could try blending half of the peas and leaving the other half whole !! Love you x
U ok girl it’s been a month..
Hope your doing ok you got this ❤️
miss you
Just bc she is doing other things doesn't immediately mean she is experiencing mental illness! She could one day decide to take a different route outside of vlogging and that is TOTALLY okay! We are all multidimensional beings with potential to do hundreds of thousands of things. Even if it means just sitting back and existing for a while. :) THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR ANYONE WHO FEELS INSPIRED TO - TO START VLOGGING if it's something they have ever been interested in!! xoxooxxoxo hope anyone who reads this has a beautiful freaking day :)
emmaa, hang in there. its totally okay and definitely fine, take the time you needed. we always support no matter what your decision is, so sorry cant give you a real hug. thank you for being one of my favorite vlogger, and see ya in a while! still missing u here, my week feels boring without your videos emma😵😫💓❣️🖤
miss u. love u. hope u doing well.

*For the people who are very eager for her to post again, please understand that she's taking a break from uploading during this time. She needs it and her not uploading will make us more excited for her future posts. :) At least she's still currently putting up podcast episodes. We love you Emma, take your time.* <3
love you so much oh my god

Sorry you have the fancy toaster?!!!???, can we have a vid just on the toaster :)
i hope you’re on
I think I saw you on Omegle
miss her
we haven’t heard from u, i hope all is ok
Hey Emma... is everything okay? its been over a month... hope to hear from you soon, we're worried. I hope you're doing well though we love you! ❤
love the minecraft music
In order to receive the green color you wanted you could have blended the peas in with it. That would have made it greener and thicker. You could have blended all the ingredients
If cheese doesn’t bother you but milk does it could be the quality of milk. It also could be a candida issue. Try raw organic dairy and see how you do
this was lovely to watch. Thank you for the specific instructions and commentary.
i miss u em
miss u girly
emma i miss u
Ima eating soup ..chicken soup 👍😌✨
Emma is 21?
OMG I really miss your videos, I hope everything is ok and we'll wait for your next video, ILY ❤❤❤

Too many peas.
Rewatching this and seeing that "bye" at the end makes me sad.  Hope it isn't.
Missing you, Emma.  Hope you're good.  Bet you have plenty new stuff you cook now.  Hope you can share it with us.  ❤️
slowly adopting the mom attitude & lifestyle with emma
next time, skin the potatoes and chop them bigger. the smaller they are the easier for them to get mushier.
emma plz make more soup i have watched this video 4 times now
Come on bitch videos?
next time u should go to trader joe’s and pick random ingredients and make something from it, that would be so interesting
hi emma i really like your videos and i haven’t heard from you in a long time. If you’re taking a break then that’s fine take as long as you need. Just letting you know that we’re missing you and i would love to hear from you soon <3
miss you emma<3
Emma!!! Instead of a lot of peas you could try it with lentils!! So good
the way she stood there and like judged the blender ❤️😂😂😂

Havent seen you in awhile. Your videos went from wacky edits and goofball activity to moody b-roll shots and documentary type vibes. Very cool.
Cooking is fun if you have nice kitchen
Emma where are you??? 😭 miss your vlogs!!
Hello emma i just wanna say miss you  :) ❤️
miss you 🖤🖤🖤
Dude my mom has died since this was last posted. Please I beg of you, upload.

Miss you, Pal.
miss u emma
miss you emma, your videos and podcast have been bringing me through a very tough time in my life right now. really hoping that you’re enjoying your time off, you deserve it. sending you lots of love and light!🫀
PUT LEMON JUICE IN YOUR HANDS AND THE SMEEL IS GONE.  @EMMA  @EVERYONE
I hope you are ok ;(
Y’all she’s on the podcast- weekly updates and talks, it’s great. Ofc her YouTube is fun too, but if you’d listen to the podcast, just know she’s doing fine! 👍
guys she said she wants to take a step back from youtube in the call her daddy podcast😭 i hope she uploads at least a little every once in a while please spare crumbs anything
Emma my dear ,WE NEED A NEW FUCKING VIDEOOO PLSSSSSS 💋😩
Serious question for anyone who follows Emma and listens to her podcast: On her January 20th episode, The Truth About Being Self-Employed, do you think she was making a dig at Elle Darby? Can't remember where; I'd say around the 20-35 minute mark.
I know no one cares but 1. I spent eq to 0.7$ on a really delicious soup earlier today and I was thinking it's too expensive! 3. hope your next phase is using less stuff to cook and\or cleaning the mess after and\or while cooking! 4. fancy content creation right there! two cameras wow Emma you have come full circle <3 <3
Miss you on YouTube Emma. Hope all is well ❤️❤️
i fcking miss you.
Just doing my monthly checkin hope everything is all good.
Hope your okay.
Emma we miss u
haven’t heard of you for a month now i hope you’re okay darl, hugs from italy💞
Now I’m listen to Emma’s podcast because she’s on here frequently and her voice and subject matter she talks about is so refreshing. She talked about the podcasts before but I didn’t look into it until now because I never really listened to podcasts before but now absolutely no regrets and I love her podcasts. I think I just love you no matter what Emma your the best person
i miss u emma
i miss u emma
y’all really shouldn’t pressure her to “ come back “ that can just set her back even more, let her take her time . although we all miss her, there is probably an important reason why she is taking time off. even if there is no reason exact reason for her to be taking time off ITS HER CHANNEL . ❤️
If I made this soup I would totally use an immersion blender or just blend half of the peas and some of the potato into the soup maybe that would make the broth more green 😇
Hope you’re okay my love. Just know we’re here!
It's so quiet in here. We hope you're doing okay Emma.
Emma please come back 😭 they are trying to make skinny jeans and tumbler girls a thing again 🤢🤮
we love u emma!!
I’m ready for the MOVIE ! I would definitely pay 17$ to see your movie🌞
I love chives tooo
miss u <3
This looked so good! For a more vibrant green color i would use a vegetable bouillon with a cashew or coconut cream/milk base instead of water. This i think would work perfectly to hold that basil color! Loving this style of video from you 💚💚💚
9:48 haha she put it on the strainer just to dump it lol
emma please come back it's been a month already 😭
I think she is done with Youtube, at least for a while.  I predict she will be on a tv show before you know it.  She seems willing to lose 11.2 million followers to get into the right head space, I admire that.  An ad on one of her videos must bring her a fortune, so it's not about money. It's about finding yourself. Good luck Emma, you have a personality that is so winning that it hurts!
Hope you’re doing well sis❤️
imy emma (:
Can someone (genuinely) explain to me why she is so loved. I’ve only just found her account now
search Turkish soups and thank me later. also if you are alive pls give us a hint. I hope you r ok.
Miss u bestiee
I’m watching this in gym class👍
i hope everything is okay!! I love and miss you
EMMA, I miss you!
Hi Emma hopefully everything is okay

Do you ever enjoy sausage in your recipes? 7:25 oof
Emma is one of those people who genuinely makes you laugh. We haven’t heard from you in a while but we love you Emma take all the time you need em. Love you gal ❤️
Emma hasn’t posted in a month I am very depressed 😭 i remember in 2017 when she posted all the time miss her and miss this new Emma both need to come back but I hope she’s taking a good long needed break

Hey but this is actually something, in my country we make this, we don't put all the stuff you put but its quite the same. The peas and the potato, the onion and sometimes the garlic. Other condiments too.We call it someting like "Pea stew" or "Pea food" it kinda has the same texture as yours too.
Is Emma ok? I keep checking if she posted but she hasn’t posted in almost 2 months now. We need a 2022 update
I don’t know why but I think this is my favorite video of yours lol
i miss you where are you how are you ❤️ I love you

The fact she uses a Ninja blender is relatable
https://youtu.be/AIdSNrfvWx8

This video is a metaphor!
Hope you’re good Emma
Take all the time you need Emma! Personal Mental Health is always the priority! We all love you 🤎
onion and garlic doesn’t like me tho 🥲🥲
Emma I hope you're doing okay. Take as long as you need to get better and repair your mental state. I love you.

Her content has become very monotonous and boring to me - it feels like she’s not really in it anymore
Emma please post something
if anyone is still wondering what Emma has been up to, she uploaded a new podcast a few days ago !    (“anything goes with Emma Chamberlain” on apple podcasts)
I miss you  bestie <<<3
Okay it’s been a month Emma please come back to us I need your content to keep me sane 😭
Guys, did Emma stop making youtube Videos?

hope she's okay
emma i love you with all my heart but I can find that specific type of soup in my country and it will cost you no more than $10 everrr!!
I love the part when you get to use a large knife, preferably a santokú, to cut up all sorts of vegetables. I'm glad you're enjoying home chef life.
Congrats on 11 million Emma! We miss you a lot bestie, hope that everything is well. Take care of yourself, your happiness and mental health is way more important. Just know we are always here for you since your vcso girl era 😭🤍

i hope you are okay emma, it’s been 6 weeks, WE MISS YOU ❤️
We miss you❤
i love you big sis, your podcasts help me out a lot
We miss u so much Emma please come back 😘
you know what i realized from this video? It really showed how our thoughts Really can devour us, especially if those thought are negative. When Emma was talking about how nervous she was about the potatoes and peas not being cooked well enough, but in the video she was just calm..? Like she was verbally speaking about what was going on in her mind, and that really got into her but if she hadn’t spoken about it, we would just think shes cooking calmly…. Idk where im going with this but ugh life’s crazy.
Emma please we're not asking for anything special we just neeeeddd youuuu btw hope your ok :)
miiiisss youu emmaaa :(
She didn’t upload anything in a month, I hope she is doing okey<3
love u emma
where did emma go? 🤧
month and a half, no video
You look so disappointed looking at the soup lmaoo😭
The pause after the "armpit anecdote" sent me 🤣🤣🤣
Wife matterial

I know your above most of us but you could of least said goodbye to all of us who made you rich by viewing your videos, how rude to just leave us hanging....Funny how money makes one a bitch...
This looks similar to a soup we have in the Philippines “mongo”
Emma, hunny, are you okay?
Love your videos! Did u quit the tube?

What the freek is homes(emmas favourite food)???
Who is God in Islam ? Muslims believe that God has no partners or associates who share in His divinity or authority and that God is transcendent, unlike His creations, and thus has no physical form. Nor is God believed to exist in (or be represented by) any material object. A number of divine attributes or “names,” which serve to describe God, are found in the Qur’an. Some commonly known attributes include the Most Merciful, the Most Forgiving, the Most High, the Unique, and the Everlasting, among others.
Islam honors all the prophets who were sent to mankind. Muslims respect all prophets in general, but Jesus in particular, because he was one of the prophets who foretold the coming of Muhammad. Muslims, too, await the second coming of Jesus. They consider him one of the greatest of Allah's prophets to mankind. A Muslim does not refer to him simply as "Jesus," but normally adds the phrase "peace be upon him" as a sign of respect.No other religion in the world respects and dignifies Jesus as Islam does. The Qur'an confirms his virgin birth (a chapter of the Qur'an is entitled "Mary"), and Mary is considered to have been one of the purest women in all creation.
Sooo... is it normal for Emma not to upload for over a month?
So dramatic for what 😂
Hey, I miss you! Just come back okay?
I don’t love onion or garlic so…..          -YOU’RE STILL A FREAK-
So she used you all to become rich and famous and then she dumped you. Straight hard core republican move.
New video??

i miss her
Lysm and love you and your videos but take as much time as you need i rather want you to feel better than watch your videos
R u OK looks good just seems like u stopped posting and as the pod cast too
EMMA , today I made the soup for a third time, paying attention to your heat cooking instruction, low , to low- medium. Had to supplement the fingerling potatoes with two other types, ( two by choice ) , both are of the smaller gourmet quality, spherical, 3/4 to 1 inch diameter, one style having red skin, the other had gold /yellow, both potatoe skins of a thin variety. I scrubbed them clean, cooked them with skins on for flavor enhancement , no slicing due to their size, ( bite sized pretty much), used 1 pound. On the English Peas that came in 6 ounce bags, fresh, I used two bags , 12 ounces, washed and picked out the cringed ones , a few unrecognizable pieces. Garlic, picked out 8 of the large peeled ones, medium chopped them. The shallots were 3 to a bag, chose two bags with medium to large sized shallots, removed the thin paper skin, and first layer of tough skin, all had a purple- ish color. Sliced length ways into halves, thin sliced half rounds, flat half down. Chopped 1/2 cup of fresh basil  without the heavy stems, medium / fine chop & pressed down a bit. Potatoes in a deeper sauce pan took 3 and 1/2 cups water to cover them. Used a pan cover, a low boil , 15 minute check skins were tender w/ centers done. At the ten minute point shallots & garlic went into the skillet of 3 tablespoons of olive oil, lid on pan , medium heat, softened in 5 minutes, but still partially firm. Added vegan boullion, 4 cubes, to potatoes , then 12 ounces of raw peas, and the onion w/ garlic and basil. Cooked 4 minutes on medium low w/ lid, once it was brought to a boil medium high. Or until peas are “” just tender “”. You had mentioned over cooking things in the past,  I enjoyed this batch the most using tips you mention in making the soup. Definitely adopted , the soup is a meal tradition. Thank you Emma.
I miss you, I hope you’re doing okay ❤️
Dear Emma I hoe you are doing good. We miss you kid!. You ate our sunshine. But if you must go away fro your own mental health so be it.
Is that actually what potatoes look like in America? Always wanted to move there, I don’t think I do now. Good spuds are a must hahaha
i pay attention to your peas and potatoes story more than my online zoom lecture
can u cook for me
my mom was cooking while i watched it and it smelled good so i could smell it while watching and it was a fun sensation it was like i was smelling your cooking
Jesus loves u!!
I hope everything is ok, we miss you emma:)
You good, Emma?
I miss u
Emma where are u !!!
according to your instagram, I assume you're taking a break, working on yourself and your business, staying away from things that make you anything other than happy. I love that you're working on yourself and I'm just happy you're happy, come back when you're ready queen.
ok joke is over now....
hope you’re doing okay, we’re still here, rewatching old videos. i love you (-:
Am i the only one concerned about Emma? Im not breathing until Emma comes back.
I wish all cooking videos were like this
Emma! Please come back! I hope you are doing well! We miss you so much.
i am eagerly waiting for the 2nd move in vlog
Wishing Emma posted more. I could truly watch her just sit in bed and talk, and be content
don't like pees but girl ur soup looks delicious
EMMA COME BACK PLA
OMG That was so funny!!!
guys in her moving vlog she said that there would be another move around winter so she’s probably taking a break rn because of that.
I loved this video as fuck, i'd love to see you cooking more it's was so incredible. luv it
i hope emma is doing ok. her mental health means the world to me. jus want her 2 be happy.
Hey we miss you!! Come back soon 🥺
i do love onion and garlic!!!!
ñ
this was a beautiful story
I won’t lie I don’t see Emma doing YouTube for very much longer, you can just tell that she loves so many other things and it’s becoming more of a chore. We need to be ready to support her if this happens guys 🙏
Your videos are so calming and I love you
you are the most inspiring creator tbh
Omg u should make more of these cooking videos it’s so entertaining to watch
love u emma <3
Emma, why don’t you take a cooking class as a hobby? It could teach you new things and make you more fond of it more then you already are.
love you come back soon!
which camera she use?
Emma are you okay you deleted ur TikTok account :(
we all hope that you're doing great those days, stay safe !
Love you emma ❤
It sounds like a pod cast 👌🏼
Girly you need to post more
Hey Emma, hope you're doing okay 💜
Hope everythings okie
Not me about to make a pea, potato and basil soup😅
I’m so happy to see your cooking v log. I hadn’t expected that I can watch this kind of contents on your channel. If I have chance to make this soup, I’ll try it! I’m grateful of giving me some tip making some soup<3
Ive been waitinggg for the vlog hope everything's okay
I love you so much Emma <3
Now I want soup.
I’m sorry but I have to post this! EMMA what in the world of cucumbers is going ON! I haven’t seen a video in a month!😂😲🥺 I hope you are doing well! Miss seeing your content! 🤟🏾
Just wanted to drop in and check on you since it's been a while since you've uploaded. You are adored and missed by many....& are not alone whatever you're going through. Many things you've shared as far as your mental health is concerned, I too experienced similar things at your age [& still struggle today so I can relate!] Hang in there & take care of yourself!  Love,  An older viewer [I turn 36 on Jan 28th!! ]]

We need vlogs
Emm come on now this Chanel is so dry
hey emma, i saw a tik tok about you and it made me sad and i wanted to check up on you and saw you haven’t posted in a month. i know you read your comment so there’s a chance you could stumble across mine but i hope you’re doing OK and you can get through anything you’re going through. i don’t know why am tearing up why writing this but i’m proud of you you’re doing great things❤️
i hate voice overs, but emma's i really dont mind
Emma I miss you

More 50 calorie recipes
Not me watching this while eating store bought pizza
I miss Emma
We miss u Emma<3 hope everything is ok
I miss her too I hope her time off is treating her well and she’s doing ok! I know it’s been a weird time for me as well so I totally respect her break, I mean I would either way but still, and I wonder if she’s moving into her house soon? She moved into the rental and said it would be about 6 months for renovations and it’s been 7 months from that vid but you know covid likes to mess with construction plans so who knows. Very happy she’s made so many vids over the years tho bc I rewatch them all the time
WE MISS YOU BESTIEEEEEEE!
WE MISS YOU
I miss you Emma and I really hope that you are living your best days ever!!
Мне просто нравится, когда приходит уведомление «У вас появился новый подписчик», меня это делает очень счастливым!!! Всем счастья и добра!!!

Hi
Literally so proud of you. I genuinely don’t know much about you but I just started cooking again too and have discovered the low heat and more patience thing too! I’m proud of myself too cause I actually have a lil bit of motivation to do daily tasks. Anyway, I really loved this video and have loved every video I’ve seen this far! Sending love 💜💜💜

Was the soup that good ?
I MISS EMMA
Honestly the fact you're only 2 years younger than me makes me depressed
the sister of youtube
hope you notice thiss❤️ you were clearly been a part of my everyday life 🤣 even if you did or didn't notice this i wanted to say that watching your vids literally makes my day❤️ even tho my mom always got annoyed by your loud burps everytime she heard me watching you but it's okay for me lol. i always found you fascinating even though your life seems boring and i kinda get used to you, that makes it not  boring anymore. you haven't posting anymore lately but i do hope your finee ( not watching you for a while makes me discovered mr beast and naomi jon lol ) i wanted you to know that i really like the way you used to be yourself and i hope that this makes you feel better❤️😘 gosh this is way too long🙃  —your anonymous fan from the Philippines 🇵🇭
The green peas made me laugh. Peas are also 😬

Emma I miss u
Where is Emma? Is she okay??
I miss you so much we need a vlog I keep coming back to see the same video ❤️
i really hope you’re fine
miss you emma
I miss Emma's videos 💔
Should've kept the pea and potato water for the soup, Bouillon is basically veggie water so you threw out real bouillon and put in industrial "fake" one instead . Also, try cooking some of the potato and peas in the bouillon and mix them with it to get the flavers and colour in it too  Looks delic' anyway
Miss u Emma
Emma enough is enough. We really waiting. I have come to this video 6 times.

what’s happening? why is Emma not posting any new videos anymore? it’s been a month now!!
Miss you bestie
hope your doing great emma love you !
It’d be nice to give your 11 million subscribers a little update about this break you’re doing. Breaks are healthy and 100% fine it’s just out of no where and none of us know what’s going on 🤨🙁
I hope your doing well, miss and love you
I hope everything’s okay Emma❤️ we love you and miss you!

emma i miss u 🥲
i miss you emma
No its not hype its for you to feed yourself to live. Cooking your own food is 1000x better than someone charging you hundreds when you can make on your own.
i miss you emma <3
emma u were supposed to peel the potatoes first
im crying this is exactly like matt colbo
i hope that you are fine , we miss you
miss you :(
Emma has such mom hands if u know what i mean

Cmon ..
Is she becoming the next Liza koshy dissapearing?
17$ for a soup 😂. Emma contributing to inflation
You as yourself are a woman who is beautiful indeed, even within cooking I can perceive that your passion for life is rooted in the nature of understanding yourself as a being always. I see that sharing much of yourself leaves you lost with what to portray next but please know that from me I see that you are a woman deserving of immense love.
Gem
the onions did have mould, but u can just wash it off and then u have a perfectly edible shallot/ onion
I like your yellow tumbler @Emma
I miss you Emma
you haven’t posted for awhile emma. i hope everything is going okay.
Emma do you have a Tinder?
Yay you learned how to make eggs without burning them!!!
Emma is too good for everybody now. She's moved on.  Her whole persona was fake. Totally pathetic and totally Hollywood.

My absolute favorite thing to eat together is peas and potatoes!!
Imy
EMMA

Come back please 😭
I feel like once you know how to cook it kinda ruins eating out cause you always know you can do better .. enjoy Emma looks great
I’ve been watching Emma since I was 18, I am 23 now. It’s pretty annoying that our views gave her a platform and she just goes hiatus on YouTube for 1 month straight without any explanation. That is not how the real world works. We you need some time off your job you let people know you won’t be back until you can. It’s ridiculous.  I work in a world wide hospital and I promise you if I just left without saying anything for a month then decided to pop back up - I wouldn’t have a job.  I used to say I love Emma, but I do not know her so change of narrative I enjoy mindlessly watching 10 minute videos uploaded by her and have for almost 5 straight YEARS.  Also to the fans that say you do LOVE her, you do not know this person. You have never met her. Love is such a strong and bold word and needs to stop being thrown around as careless as it is in todays world.  Imagine if your BEST FRIEND just disappeared for 1 month you’d be confused.  Emma please treat this platform with the same respect as any other normal human has to treat their job. Thanks.
It’s not pronounced “boy-yon”, it’s pronounced “boo-yaw”
Missing her a little to much lately
If you want to show somebody how mentally ill rich people look & sound like
Is it just me or has Emma disappeared?!
miss you
Emma I made your recipe to the tee, and oh my god you are a mastermind. This soup is delectable!
Hi Emma! You prbably won’t read this but I miss you and your vlogs. Everytime, I open youtube your the first one I watch video to! I miss hearing and watching your videos and honestly your videos makes feel cozy and warm . I hope you are taking care of yourself and doing good! We’ll be waiting. 🥺❤️
hope you've been holding up well Emma <3 we love you
i miss u em
I need more. I've been stuck in my house the last 4 days. I need another soup video, anything emma please help me. PLEASE
i hope everything's ok girl, we miss u xx
Emma pls post new video soon my life is sucks
it’s been over a month since this video. i miss emma’s videos, why is she not posting anything? :(
where are you emma? we missed you..

This looks like a soup that someone would server on master chef!
omg litterally we are dying from you lack of activity. post!!! we miss you
hey emma! we miss you! i was feeling anxious cause of exams and realised I hadn't watched your videos in a while so here I am :)
It’s been a month! I hope you’re good sis ❤️
👂🏻
we miss u emma
This soup is a traditional Slovak soup :)
i know it probably taste good but that looks fucking gross haha. one big bowl of mushy peas

I miss you Emma 🥺 but we love you so much and we hope you’re time off is being enjoyed! Take as much time as you need ❤️ I will continue to watch your old videos because you make my day and you’re my bestie.. Forever Forehead kiss! ✨
girl why did u strain it just to pour it back lol
i miss you emma
this is cooking with Emma at its highest level
I love emma
I want that soup. !!
Easy tip: when getting peels off garlic, crush the garlic with your knife. The peel comes right off in less little pieces
go off emma wtf
WE MISS YOU EMMA
That’s a bit heavy handed on the bouillon. It’s concentrated, don’t want it too salty, so a little goes a long way.
get a piano. become the next Beethoven. and learn how to play Clair De Lune. ur welcome.
WTF r u?
emma i actually love you
emma i love you
Haven't heard from you in awhile Emma, hope everything is ok.
Cooking is something that just gets better with practice, but damn look at that! Never made soup before, but you created a master piece. Tell me you haven't thought about opening your own restaurant before. Also I absolutely love! your honesty and realism when you speak about your learning curves, can definitely tell its a confident booster for everyone 💕
watching this genuinely felt like a spiritual journey from start to finish
EMMA DOES YOUR TOASTER HAVE A DIGITAL SCREEN ⁉️ that’s actually kinda cool though :) <3
I hope you’re not still calling yourself a YouTuber
emma i miss u

emma i miss u sm:(
It's been a month, when r u coming back? We miss you
That actually looks fire and I hate peas
Where are you Emma?
I don't know why I am crying,.. I watched 80% of Emma`s content here on her channel. When she was 17 and 18 and went to Joshua Tree alone, and to Paris with her dad... i don't know.. seems like I`ve been watching soul`s evolution and the last 2 videos touch me well with very deep feelings <3 thank you, Emma!
We miss u emma;(دلمون برات تنگ شده✨🧡
Wtf where are u😑😑😑😢😢😢😢
miss u
New video please
hey Emma please come back, it’s been a month imy❤️
EC's YT numbers are falling; hence our being subject to the more recent 'cat-and-mouse' game from EC's not posting in the past month.  Once EC uploads a new video, this newly posted video's numbers will skyrocket EC's numbers. (Even though you're not logged in when you click on EC's channel for any updates, this 'click' still counts toward her YT numbers, only to discover there's nothing new, zero, zip, nada. You've been played.) I'm done.
Hi EMMA love from India

$17 .. $17! Perfect end to a video.
The soup is a metaphor for life
Life's crazzzzy, but that's normal also, I often forget, I wonder how strange it must be for you? I would most likely self destruct, just my nature , you will be fine though , enjoy the hell out of it.
اشتقت لها و احس بحزن

Mmmmmmmm            -    Chamberlain ( skecsis ) the dark crystal
Emma narrates like she's in The Office
Emma sorry but make a cooking show
emma post i need you
listened to this as a podcast because emmas voice is a gift from heaven
She’s probably realizing she’s rich enough to the point where she doesn’t need to make a video a week anymore, or be consistent with content.
omg emma chamberlain I love you so much you make me feel so much better when my drunk gay uncle beats me I wanna be just like you when I grow up and spit on the poor
girl u ain’t posted in a week where r u 😭
Emma you’ve have stopped giving us a forehead kiss  😔
Love how far you have come with your cooking skills you are a rockstar
Hey you, I miss you.
The soup would’ve been green if you blended the peas but you were actually on to something. It’s always the non-cooks who come up with fire ideas ✨
i miss u
hey emma! Jesus loves you so so much! i hope you’re doing well! 💙
Can anyone tell me where did she disappear? Why did she stop uploading?
EMMA WE MISS YOU :’(

The perfectly placed '19' peas plated in a perfect pile @ the beginning . . . Been there.
did I just sit here for twelve minutes watching emma make soup? yes. Would I do it again? yes.
hi can u post plz miss u
Hi Emma. I just wanted to let you know that I just discovered your podcast and I'm blown away by how much wisdom you have. You are very mature. 2022 is the year that you think highly of yourself. You are simply lying to yourself if you ever think that what you are doing doesn't matter to anyone because it does. Anyways, enjoy this year Emma!
Do we think she’s moving rn??? Her moving vid was posted 6 months ago and she said her new house was gonna be ready in about 6 months……
Hey girl you okay?? You haven’t posted In a year. Sorry for the New Years joke but fr you good??
Your voice is sounding more like a grown woman, it’s been great watching you grow up I’m glad you still weird as shit, you should eat more fatty food tho, get a thic mom bod <3
I want a new videooo
never been so interested in how to make a soup tbh
This video of Emma Chamberlain creating in the kitchen is heartwarming. She is an old soul.
6:40 brahh 😂the pause made me laugh but then it was so long of a pause that I wasn’t sure if my airpod cut off
when are you gonna post again am mis you sending love from Belgium
i love your podcast
I love your videos so much
Please post a video I miss you❤️
miss u
Hey emma . How are you doing ? for me, i am very much struggling So as usual i am here again to watch your vlogs and you haven’t been here a lot so i wonder u alright?  . Ofc i wont know for sure but hope you feel alright and just as your vlogs accompany me , there’s smth accompany you too . Have a good day emma
Honestly I'm 26 and I feel like I grew up with you lol 😆 who else ? Love your videos
tip on how to make ur soup base look greener the next time: blend some of ur peas with the soup base! leave some so u can throw it in with potatoes. from what it looks like there’s a lot of peas in this soup and i think u rather want to accentuate the thick, liquid texture and not the ingredients. add a little parsley with ur chives as a garnish for some extra depth in flavor and of course to highlight the green 😘
Definitely trying this!
The amount of love I have for this video is just unexpressable
very good video
Where is Emma :( we miss you and I hope you are okay!
Always start by sauteeing onions and garlic!
no new stuff 😣 r u ok? r u leaving youtube? 🙊
Cookers tip if you smash the garlic it makes it easier to cut and cook! Love your videos 😌
Miss you :(
omg emma... i just watch one of your old videos and straight passed into this one and your voice sounds like a complete other person!!
You could put spinach in it next time for more greenness and health without changing the flavor much (: but it will make it more watery so start thicker. Also we care why the cheese doesn’t hurt ur tummy
I need it
waiting for the next vid :(
Emma we miss you please come back!
where have u Been :( pls make a new video
i keep checking and she still hasn’t uploaded
Imiss youu❤❤❤❤

i love u emma
i miss you:(
Cooking and baking is great but you don't enjoy it or want to do it when you work a '9-5' all day, have kids, have to clean up, etc...
The World Belongs To The Devil And The Devil Got Blonde Hair And Blue Eyes,
Favorite quote: "if I'm being honest, the thought of waking up in the morning and cooking excites me and that is priceless.... anyways back to the green peas" - Emma C. 2021
Whos binging her videos cause we miss her🥺🥺🥺
I MISS YOU :(((
suggestions: -adding some butter in with the oil will involve a bit of fattiness that will benefit the flavor in the end. -season your garlic and onion before browning them, not after. -consider adding some red pepper flakes, parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. it’s not just a great line in a song, they really will brighten up the flavors of your broth. I would personally add them in with the shallots and garlic, but you could add em in when you add in the water. -use less peas and blend most of them in (when you blend in the basil). that’ll thicken up the texture of the soup, and hopefully help in creating a greener color. it’ll also make it into a more genuine pea soup. if you’re doing this, add a bit more oil to the mixture before blending. -think about investing in an Immersion Blender, if you think you’ll be making soups more.  love the video, emma. reminds me of an episode of HOW TO WITH JOHN WILSON. if you haven’t seen it definitely check it out (it’s comedic documentary that captures day to day life, filmed and narrated by a dry humored and sincerely kind man. two short seasons, surprisingly touching, and wonderfully edited.)
pls make more cooking videos <3 i’m definitely gonna make this and i wanna know more of the recipes u make :)))
love u bestie
Imagine being so lazy  it takes you more than 3 weeks or a month to upload more than a 10 minute video.. 😮‍💨
emma you went missing again it's been 3 weeks 🛐 PLEASE COME BACK IM HAVING PROBLEMS TO BREATHE WITHOUT YOU
The song at 10:15 made my anxiety go 📈📈📈
man neville chamberlain aint got nothing on emma chamberlain, partially cause he's dead
Quite literally missing Emma right now, I need my weekly dose of Emma chamberlain
isn't garlic a pain to chop
this was a great vlog Emma im loving u soup girl! when she even holds the knife correctly
Emma pls post I need u
SOOOOO...what's up with you.  Why have you only posted one video in the last 6-7 weeks?
Emma is so beautiful u cant change my mind
Emma we miss you, please upload some content! mwah
This was an Emma soup podcast and Im not even mad about it
This is like u set up a rich personaly person and a poor like money person but when a cool person watches the video it hits , well rough stuff , so ppl that comment here are mostly low class not cool , i mean most of them , who are just on the same wave. this should be banned from EU for inappropiate content.
I’m so proud of you i love you si much !!
EMMA WHERE ARE YOU💔💔💔💔💔💔
Emma videos bring me serenety and brings back the real me that's most of the time out of my life, unfortunately. Emma my heart is warm now, thanks <3
It’s crazy, that the way to people hearts is simply and genuinely being you , I see all of this content creators doing all of this crazy thing to be liked by others, with emma I feel like we all love her for who she is and like genuinely want to hang with her even if there is nothing to do or to say it’s like she is enough, she doesn’t has to put so much effort into it. I think I reached that point where I love her like a family member that kind of unconditional love , like I just want her to be happy and healthy Idc if she is doing YouTube or not I will always wish her all the good things forever and I’ll be so proud and happy for her success and It’s all because she is just being herself . and that’s why it’s crazy she basically hacked the game
I honestly come back to your account every day to see if u have posted. I miss u so much Emma but I hope u are doing okay <3
we miss u
imagine making millions and producing nothing on youtube
I’m definitely making this soup 🍜💯
HAHAHAHAHAHHAH THE SILENCE AFTER IS IT MY ARMPIT OR THE ONION
I hope Emma is not just going to leave us like the Dolan twins did
EMMA ITS BEEN 3 WEEKS! I MISS YOU
are uploads gonna be once a month now? we really miss you
Emma this is too much please come back :(
only emma can make a soup that we like to watch
emma how do you have pool and not go swimming all day everyday
❤️
Wait I'm kinda curious 👀 I've seen sooo many food channels and now Emma too, not peeling the potato, just chopping it as it is but all my life I've thought we're supposed to peel the potato?! Was I wrong this whole time?!
emma im gonna cry if u dont post idk how much longer i can take of this

what the fuck did she make
L video L creator +ratio+L+no energy
*mmm good soup*
bestie we miss you, please post more videos!!
You’re so inspiring and stunning no matter what you’re my awesome friend I don’t have a lot of those and I’m stressed out what can I do?Help my dog be overprotective?
Hello, we miss you..
how does emma have me getting emotional over soup. like literally tears to my eyes when it was done wow the meaning of everything is soup that’s why we’re all here.
sometimes i just think that Emma is my only friend :)
Greetings from Poland 😀
as much as her chaotic videos gave her popularity, I love coming to her videos to relax and calm down.
emma please explain why my stomach hurts from milk but not cheese
Is she like done with Youtube…did I miss the memo where she wasn’t posting anymore or what?? Cause it’s been forever
Love you Emma.!
Emma, come backkkkk
non ha pelato le patate... e già questo mmh...
That's TOO MUCH peas.

I wonder why I she famous!
I enjoy cooking but don't enjoy the washing

Entirely entertaining video. Why you strain the broth tho and then still put the chunks back?? Looks delicious
rewatching this for about 10 times  MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS PLS !!!!
Emma I’m so proud of you queen!!
My grandma husband is he grandpa
It’s funny because I thought Emma had already talked about her newfound love for cooking in several of her videos and podcasts. I love how she keeps rediscovering a love for cooking. Would totally watch a cooking show with/by her.
emma come back :(
Where did our Emma go
no front but it kinda annoys me that she doesn't put the lids on all the time. so much heat getting lost
I think emma has been busy and not apploding so much bc 6 months ago she said she would move to a house after 6 months which is now so yea
Rewatching Emma’s YouTube because I miss her so much
When the video is 12 minutes and 12 seconds long
I will absolutely watch as many full videos of you cooking as you want to post.
Are you making a recipe book with everything you're cooking? Genuinely interested in a book of recipes by you. Your food always looks delicious.
Still waiting for a new YouTube viedeo I can’t handle my life without your viedeos
great vid
bro some lentils would've been fire with that soup
I hope you're doing well 😌
Just search arakas it’s a Greek dish
مية لايك ليه
I’m actually so proud of her for finding things that excite her and can actually make her get out of bed in the morning. I’ve waited so long for this moment to come, you deserve this bae ! <3
i hope she doesn't keep on making edits like this with her voice in the background all the time
What other kind of pea is there? (Okay chickpea but still) I had no idea a pea was English...
Emma!! Hun, I need kisses, not a lame "BYE".

Miss chamberlain  we want a new video

START A COOKING CHANNEL OR ELSE 😭😂💀
Anyone else think this is blatantly inspired by ‘how to with John Wilson’ on hbo? just wondering
Emma wya? I miss you.  Hurry back😩
i watched yesterday and i made it tonight. i had to substitute some things with less fresh ingredients but it's honestly to die for. more cooking videos please!!
I would actually pay money to eat Emma's soup
Bruh I look every day for a new video. My strange addiction is emma Chamberlain
good soup.
the soup looks delicious and kinda weird, but i rlly want some!
Hello queen. Hope these past few weeks have been kind to you, you deserve to be happy. We all love you ❤️
You should open a coffee shop in Ny
Emma! Could you give us an update on your film camera? How you’re liking it? How the pictures look? Xoxo
She's a vibe tbh
It’s too long emba, come back we miss you :(
Loving the cooking fade bc I'm going through it too
Hey Just Checking In On You Making Sure You Are Good. 😘
When are you moving and are you going to film it ??!! Also I love your videos <3
Yo! I have a crush on your stove.
I don't know how else I could publicize my love of cooking and not necessarily gourmet meals but knowing how to do well and being able to enjoy it is the best
miss uuuuu
We miss you 😢
cooking is therapy
Emma I have an idea for you MAKE A SHORT FILM like seriously and u know make it yours! ❤️❤️
The soup looks delicious. In India, we call it nimona soup. It's usually made during winters. You should try it. It's really good.
Emma is almost moving in her permanent house. She said she'd be there in approximately 6 months, it's been 6 months since she moved into her apartment :)
Gurllll we missed you YouTube user...
I love you, i really do. BUT BABES, watching you slice veges and stuff is PAINFULL. pls be carefull of your fingers!
miss u emma:((</3
She is on her own planet 😂
Welp, guess I’m making potato pee soup tomorrow
im gonna need another podcast episode. i need to fall asleep. i promise ill listen to them awake too sometime.
Missing emma rn
I very much suggest to cook the peas and potatoes in the soup broth itself rather than separately in water, that way they can soak up the broth flavor and the final taste will be soo much more enhanced :)
emma wya i miss u upload
Videos seem to be coming fewer and farther in between. Is Emma on to something else now?
this video made me feel ultimate peace
add ziggys bro
I hope you are doing well Emma, i miss you but i'm also happy that you can enjoy your break time without work. Lots of love to you ... 😘
I miss u😔
Why did i watch the whole thing
Emma where are you
Pea soup is my nightmare
i absolutely love this video
"English peas" 😂 what are the other varieties in the USA? We just call them garden peas, or the smaller variety is called *petit pois "
Bestie where are u???!! Missing u like crazy
I made this soup, but I added cashews when i blended it to make the broth creamier :) good stuff
Dear person reading this I hope your day has been going well, if not, I hope it gets better. You are an amazing person who will inspire others to do great things so keep up the hard work. I know you may feel unimportant or insecure at the moment but know that you are a beautiful human being inside, outside and you are important.  💛💛💛
She’s not posted in nearly a month 😔
Emma, why is this so brilliant, lol, something as simple as making a soup (for some) made into this intense scenario, narrated to be this sort of reality show drama vibe. You had me on my seat, even though I knew it would turn out.hahah BRAVO! WELL DONE girl!
😂😂😂
only Emma would hold my attention for a video that is all about making soup. I don't even like pees but why do I want this?
I got Covid on the 1st and Emma’s videos have helped me feel less alone during this lonely time!
Where are u Emma we need u please post something anything will do please we need u 🙂🤞🙏🏻
Where's the new vlog Emmaaaaaaaaa?
hey shawty, idk why but I feel like you need to hear this. everything is going to be okay

I NEED A NEW VIDEOOOO LIKE NOW
6:40 the silence is painfully loud
hi Mom! im omw
Mi paz🍃
I miss youuuu
EMMA , I made the soup on two separate occasions, I enjoyed the soup , it’s a wonderful recipe, on the second batch I added 3 times the amount of English Peas, they had vegan cubes for the stock, both times I doubled the amount per cup recommended, on the shallots and garlic I used 4 shallots and more garlic, chopped up, cooked them in olive oil. This is a family recipe that I will enjoy every few months  since it’s adopted . Thank you for teaching and showing all the steps 🙂
Hi my name is bella I am your new fan. Thank you
i missed you

wash your hands with a little bit of salt or a little bit of vinegar with dish soap to get rid of the onion/garlic etc smell
Anyone knows the reason why she doesn't upload her new video nowadays? Just miss her..
emmas video style right now reminds me of a podcast
oh yes, spontaneously cooking and enjoying the time by themselves or with others... it's just the best 🧡 should probably try the recipe some time!
this makes me want to actually start cooking.
emma your videos are so amazing and its so fun watching them
that must be a GOOD soup for $17
Lol I spit when I saw how many peas were in the soup… I love you Emma

a tip for mincing garlic, you don’t have to peel the- skin or whatever off of the clove of garlic. you use your knife blade you lay it flat and smash the garlic clove. the skin of the garlic clove then comes off
postttt
Cant wait for moving vid

i am so proud of you Emma. this soup looks fucking delicious, I'm gonna make it sooner or later! I love that you have a hobby that sticks<3

emma where are you girl, i keep waiting for a new video lol! Merry Christmas & Happy New Year!💕
gorgeous gorgeous girls like soup
Emma you've mentioned before that cooking videos calm you down and I never understood until now. that was an amazing experience
I miss you
Happy New Year Emma! from a random subscriber who is probably too old/way too old to be watching your videos
I love you so much and need more of this! Ok that’s all thanks happy 2022!
Dear Emma Chambies, please do a New Years video. Maybe you could go about popular coffee shops getting decaf lattes and rate them based on flavor. It’s really not about what you’re doing we love you most when your rambling and random. You’re funny and I miss you! Byeee
Ben was right.
we miss you where are you
Dear emma regarding the cheese question Parmigiano is lactose free due to the creation process Thats why you don’t feels sick after consuming it:)
Emma is coming out with a cook book, mark my words
❤️❤️❤️❤️
why are you never here when i need you
This is the first youtube video from you that i'm watching and it is literally exactly like your podcast😭 i'm absolurely flabbergasted
Is that a rolls Royce toaster 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣
ho iniziato l'anno guardando emma chamberlain,meglio di così non si può
kinda boring
"She doesn't realise how pretty she is"  MAN! SHE LITTERALY EARN MILIONS OF DOLLAR WITH HER BEAUTY!
Next time cook your veggies in the broth so they’ll soak up all that flavor! Good job!
That looks awesome, ide add mushrooms too 💕 great job
usally you cut the potatos in half like from um to down and you cook them in the soup, at the same time as the other things
i commented this on 2021
as a portuguese, this is just....
“Sometimes I itch my armpit and cut a shallot in the same hour” hahaha
12:19 I identify as the rogue pea off the plate to the left thank you
Idk why i have a really bad feeling something happened to emma
0:12 that pea near the top on the right literally looks like it’s screaming. Poor little dude.
this looks fire! boil your basil in baking soda water for a second before blending and let the broth cool down first to get your soup a bit greener! it prob got brown too bc basil oxidizes with heat and also bruises but that prevents it
if you do this soup again I think you should try to blend a part of the peas so the soup is greener, creamier and thicker :)
Just open up a restaurant already 💚
i love u.
This just made me wanna start cooking soooo bad
i'm so glad THIS is the last emma video im watching for the year.
okay but she’s a DIRECTOR. like give her a film or music video to direct. asap. love her cinematography! <3
0:49 😭
please tell me you guys saw the YouTube video that Ben of the week made abt Emma chamberlain making soup😭
omg you dont know how much i love your videosss<33

Were is my forehead kiss😭
Emma where are you?
Wow this was an experience
Where is my forehead kiss 😢
Emma loves the word chalet. soup looks amazing.
this is so dramatic

Wheres the emma intro and the forhead kiss :(
You gotta bring back the forehead kiss. I miss my forehead kiss
You’re doing great Em!
this has inspired me to take up more cooking, need to up my game. ta luv, glad to see you've got confidence to explore your own recipes
'shall-ET' is actually pronounced 'shall-OT'
I caught that angel number 🧚🏻‍♀️
Good Soup 🥣
Is she okay? It’s been two weeks :( i miss her
It’s just pronounced BULL-YON :)
Hi Emma,  Please post a new video. Thank you. Me.
6:34 looks like a scientist who's doing a weird experiment, love u
Why is this such a good documentary about soup

Please give us the recipe!!!
I want to cook by this vd idk why but... Yep

Emma WE MISS YOU!
Guys can someone give me YouTubers with this calming vibes like Emma? This is the only way I fall asleep and I’ve watched Emmas videos way too many times, and she doesn’t upload new ones😓❤️
the part when you said "and that was it the soup was done" felt like you just discovered the entire meaning of life.
the vibesssss
missing her
i miss you
Me after watching this: 👩‍🍳
Broo im loving this emma’s new content 😩💗💗
she is my comfort person, and i hope she knows that
you cannot tell me that Emma does not remind you of Michael Scott from The Office :)
nope i hate garlic and onions
Sorry but I can’t understand how people can eat garlic
Your editing and the way you can be yourself is amazing.
I really must know where her jacket is from
you should make a cookbook
Where are you Emma? Stay safe.
Pea soup?! 🤢
i love you
Please upload 😔
also wash your hands with salt after you cut shallots or garlic and it will take away the smell and the stickyness
this was a journey and i’m so glad i could join you on it
Omg I just love her !!
I love her so much🥺
"bye" is the new forehead kiss, I've learned to accept that!
The talent Emma has to make everything and anything interesting…I mean 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Who's here after watching Matt Colbo make fun of her?
boy yong 😭😭😭😭😭 ( it’s pronounced boo yung < young > , but i defffff can see the confusion
I love when white people discover cooking
Good soup
I'm not a podcast person, I'd like more videos please. 🙂
This is pure joy and soooo encouraging
Please search how to pronounce “bouillon” cause my ears are hurting 🥲 loved the video though, looked delicious!
This was aesthetically beautiful Emma 🤌🏾
please post i need this.❤️
I just wanna say your vlogs help me with my anxiety and overthinking. They're like self-healing vlogs and it makes me forget the shitty days that i go thru the week. Makes life a little less hard for me. So, thank you Emma for being that person. Keep up the vlogs <3 grateful that you exist <3
A tip i learned from Rachael Ray when dicing is to have a garbage bowl next to you! I use a plastic plate or a bowl if u want to be more eco-friendly, and basically just throw all ur scraps in it (onion peels, garlic peels, potato ends) so that u don't make a mess on ur table
I've always loved cooking since I was a kid! It's a mental getaway for me, my stress relief, my passion, and I love your cooking videos now! It's nice seeing a youtuber i've always loved share a love for cooking as do I :)
Emma: “Yes im talking to you, you LOVE onion and garlic!” Me with an onion allergy: 🥲🥲
Also good on yah
Is that a ninja??
Merry Christmas
i actually teared up from how proud i was at the end of the video. you can tell that she's truly and unapologetically becoming herself and i'm SO here for it
IM.PRIUD OF UR FKING SOUP
you can add little bit of starch or flour to make it thick and the amount of peas should be less than that, but honestly good job! i love it😭❤️
I needed this rn thanks emma
I don't think she will see this
I made this account just to subscribe to this qeuuns channel . I just wanted to say you are so amazing and l hope oneday you will be able to say u are better than ever and just know you are so so special and precious .
thank you for pointing out the unknown gray substance in the jackets of shallots. I am frequently concerned and confused.
this reminds me of joanna ceddia but a more chill version of her cooking
I could watch Emma cut potatoes all day long
love the title lol
Good soup
Hey girl, you are young, pretty, intelligent and the way you talk a lot with your red hair reminds me of Anne of Green Gables. But if you could cut down a tiny- bit on your F words, you will look even prettier. I can assure you! This is a little advise from a middle aged man who is right now wondering how the hell did he ended up snooping around a teenager's channel. 😁
"Why Grand Ma are so in to this Sh*t".. 😂🤣😂👍👍
It’s because cheese is low FODMAP because the enzymes eat up the lactose sugar
the low heat and egg comment was so relatable
iloviyuo
Hi! The way to get the shallot & garlic smell off is by rubbing your hands/fingers on the steel sink. My mom taught me that & it really works !! ☺️. There’s literally these steel  soap bars on Amazon that u can buy, specifically for that lol.
mmmmm, might try this now😛
This gives Nordstrom Cafe vibes, and I love it.
i love the feeling w Emma’s podcast where I know the next phrase she’s going to use and I can genuinely relate to it
Next video: chamberlain soups
what about the forehead kiss
WOW $17 FOR THAT SOUP!
THE PEA SOUP ACTUALLY LOOKS GOOD!
in need of more emma vids 💔
The grey substance around the shallot may have been dirt???? Especially if your buying things from the farmers market there are often left over dirt on the vegetables so you have to rinse it or wipe it with a wet towel.
I know out of 5k comments she'll probably never see this, I am much older than Emma and I started watching her videos some years back! something about her made me stay and at the moment I was watching and wondering sometimes why I was actively just watching videos of a 19 year old girl on YouTube. Being quirky and random. Though Emma is currently 20, I find that recently you can see how she's progressively blossomed into this thoughtful young woman. Someone left a comment saying how "she's an incredibly private person pretending to be an open book" and that's exactly how it should be. There's something special in her and I am wishing her nothing but good for her heart and mind.
This is my favorite cooking with Emma, and I hope she knows how proud we are of her
Emma idk why but i think you should get a family like a husband and kids (its not meant in a bad way), I just think you would be a good mom
I miss the forehead kiss tbh
Now she needs to make this for Joshua weissman👀
where are u 😭😭😭😭???
the girl is anorexic
This is probably one of my favourite videos you’ve ever made
I love you so much Emma ❤️

MORE COOKING VIDS PLEASE
i miss u
hi Emma, I know ur probably never gonna see this comment as I am sure u get plenty of other ppl commenting on ur videos and what not. right now, it’s 1 am in canada and i have been having severe depression and anxiety these past few weeks. uve become a comfort and safe space for me. i love watching your videos and podcasts and although i don’t know u personally and i probably will never meet u irl, it almost feels like i know and relate to u so much in every aspect without knowing u??? idk if that makes any sense. i don’t tend to idolize or like anyone without knowing them personally but for some reason i feel different w u. im sure a lot of ur followers/fans can relate (I hate the word fans but idk what other word to use😅). it’s also crazy that we are the same age and live such similar yet different lives (in terms of like fame and stuff, i don’t know what it’s like being in the public eye or having my own business and stuff) and that we’re the same age. i know social media is distorted and not a depiction of reality but I truly feel like u are authentic when u talk ab ur mental health and the act of just existing. i hope i can grow up and become as independent as u one day where i live alone and just enjoy life as is. i also wanted to say I love u and that in the case that I ever do meet u (after covid lol or whenever that ends), i will make sure to tell u this all over again
EMMA YOU SHOULD BECOME A CHEF
DO MORE OF THAT
ok ok I don't even like peas but your soup makes me wanna eat them like everyday
No one is gonna talk about the fact that emma has potential to become a great chef? I mean she enjoys and is loving the proccess of learning and developing something with the food
Where is this jacket from
make a cooking channel
i loved that video, i laughed and learned something, thank you
Loved this video!
Good video
Here in Romania that would pass more for a peas stew instead of soup lmao but as long as it tastes good
good to hear Emma yummy
emma: you love onion and garlic me who despises onion and garlic: um yeah i sure do

You don’t get it
This is the amount of times emma said “and” 😂🙃
basil, potato and pea soup does sound v original emma
emma my favourite restaurant is mcdonalds I don't think they're putting much onion and garlic on my chicken nuggets
ok emma, hear me out bestie......a cook book😯👏🤷‍♀️ im just sayingggg I believe in you queen
Love you Emma
I'm so disappointed. A podcast recipe. Her Instagram, her photo shoots, her coffee Company, all normal. Her YouTube channel, tho, abandoned.
this videos sounds like a joke and i like it
eres bien basada oomf Emma chambera
I’m actually only here because Matt Colbo did a “basically an Emma Chamberlain video” video and I need to certify the authenticity
you should bake croissants by claire saffitz
You know you eat about 90 thousand meals in your life! So you may as well enjoy it <3
Now make a bean soup with ham
Wow! Can I just say Emma, this entire video. It’s such a work of art! I love everything from the aesthetic, to the angles, to the editing techniques! Well done Emma! Well done.
Blend it with the peas next time and it’ll be more green!
Okay more of this please
I felt sleepy umm but not gonna lie I still want to watch it until the end It's emma super power😏
Looks yummy I want some
8:35 I’ve done the research and I don’t think anyone cares. Me: um.. I care tho..
emma where the hell have you been loca
LEMON JUICE IN THE NEXT ONE - another chef named Emma ✨❤️ beautiful!!
That's Kool right .. you should be a wife ,
good job Emma !! you made soup
Emma is so effortlessly funny and clever!
We call it 'Aloo Matar ki sabzi in India basically the same thing with a lot more spices in it.
okkkkkk this b roll is chef affff
i wonder if next time you boil the parmesan rind in the broth what that would turn out like?
i wanna try the soup so bad
Good soup
This was really fun It's just like the podcast but you can see everything
Putting chicken in that would be so good.
She should have blended the potatoes and the peas too!!!
My mom NEVER follows a recipe and she makes the best food in the world. Recipes are very limiting
this is the Best channel
emma i love this, your so inspiring and you make me enjoy life
She sounds a little different
I like peas
I need old emma who can cheered me up😔
Yum
you need to puree that shit
Do you guys notice watching Emma doing her shit seems like she's the only human left on earth?
I love this so much! The step by step voice over journal entry style?! LOVE IT!
Girl what you DON’T know is I will actually beat? Your ass!’ Where the hell is the next video baby? Cmon now. The first lil breaky break was cute but now I need you. Take your time… but hurry up❤️
The way Emma pronounces shallots, "shah-let" instead of "sha-lots" haha
this might have been your best video yet pls do a cooking channel
This was soothing even though green peas are my absolute least favorite food. And this is the perfect time of year for a good soup 🥣
Throw the Parmesan rinds in there next time while cooking the soup.
Hi
lol i agree with you. ONIONS AND GARLIC ARE THE SHIT. like I put tons of it in anything like anything that you can imagine and it just hits my taste buds.
maybe this is just me but i think it would be really cool if you could do a cooking class series or something. orrr just doing it off camera if thats what you'd like. i think you should pursue learning how to cook if you really like it emma!
Cooking With Remi X Emma collab??
All I want to see is EMMA X CLAIRE 🥺
I'M SO POUD OF YOU EMMA 💗💗
I love you emma that's why I'm making this comment. I see you in videos of you battling your attacks with your anxiety and I have to tell you that what you're doing is completely wrong. I had attacks and obsessions for 2 years. Like you, I was afraid of them, I didn't want to live, I fought, I tried my best to drive them away, but you know, I couldn't get any results. While I was surfing the internet again in distress, I came across a psychologist on youtube and that man was a light in my life. I want to tell you about his technique. Loving thoughts, respecting them and accepting your every thought. loving the attacks you are experiencing. I was so relieved to know that they were just a feeling like happiness. It turns out I wasn't sick. I just misunderstood my feelings. After this incident, I started to give suggestions to myself. And it's like this: I love my thoughts, I don't run away from them, I don't fight, I accept them. Come when my thoughts want, I love you. As you fight your thoughts, they fight you too. but if you love them, accept them, don't see them as enemies, they go away after a while. You know, I didn't even want them to go as long as Emily suggested to me like this, I loved them and accepted. Of course, it is a little difficult to accept, but in this process, continue with your daily routines, for example, don't say I'm in trouble right now, I can't get out of bed, and sadness is a feeling like happiness and I continue my work. Emma I love you so much I'm a foreigner I hope there was no mistake in my writing I will pray to God to see this message I believe you will shine in your life💓
Loving this new cooking realness. Keep it going!
Suggestions!  Have shorter nails so you can hold your veggies when chopping, go slowly, maybe use a smaller knife. Don’t blend hot liquids, use an emulsifier at room temp. The soup looks delicious
This is so wholesome and sweet, I’m so happy she wakes up excited to cook and eat. 🥰
to get the onion and garlic smell off your fingers just rub your hands on your faucet. the stainless steal soaks up the smell and leaves your hands with less smell.
big pea girl huh
Emma, I made the soup & it was delicious 🤤. I’d pay $17 or more for it. Thank you so much for a new recipe! I’m always looking to switch up my meals (I’m vegan …)! 😍🤭🍲
mandza making queen
I don't like soup but this made me wanna eat soup
Lmao, dude I scratched my ass after cutting onions and let’s just say I didn’t want to sleep with my man for a week ahahah
love you emma
I think Emma is ready to move on from Youtube, you can kind of tell that she does not have her heart in it like she used to.  The older videos just have more conviction and heart in them.
real ones will remember Emmas old cooking videos back home that got her to 11.2 mill hahahahahaha
here me out... a cooking with Emma series..
I don’t think my Emma chamberlain phase will ever end
i hope ur doing better <3
Ok but did anyone else go through a spirichual journy through Emma Chamberlain making soup
i love you Emma you are cutie!!! i love your vibes
Emma I need a video called “my most worn jeans collection” cause all your jeans are beautiful
u made this on my birthday I feel special thank you emma i love your videos
The fact she missed the opportunity to say “I’ve learnt that cooking things low and slow is the way to go” 😪
This oddly makes me miss Joanna Cena ma mannn.
we need you on Cooing with Remi!
A lot of hard cheeses don’t have lactose! :)
*I am obsessed with your storytelling. For some reason I am in love with your videos. Your talking about soup and I am connecting to you. When you talk about food when it helps you get up in the morning, that's me! Not with food but with coffee. I am constantly learning to improve on my coffee making. Im not perfect but I enjoy it! I think we are all wanting more and just even the simplest tasks we want to learn more about. Thank you Emma again for a great video xx*
.womanizer.
If you love basil and pesto you should check out santa margherita ligure Italy. Pasta alla genovese is pasta in a basil sauce with potatoes and green beans. You might love. Great white wine as well
You just almost made Indian curry called’aloo gobbi’
You are a young version of Elizabeth Olsen. She is an older version of u. Let's. Talk. About. It.
She really enjoy cooking so much
I get a feeling you would love minestrone, an Italian soup
iloveyou girl
10:10 i started to cry, literally “and the soup is done”
Btw if you wash your hand with dish soap immediately after you chopped the onion, your hands will not smell
i genuinely care about the milk/cheese tolerance though, emma
As a pea hater, this is terrifying But I love u!
God Emma!!! this video was such a masterpiece. Really enjoyed watching, the commentary and the visuals were in point!! Happy holidays to you and your fam :-)
this made me so happy i cried
never seen someone cut potatoes like that
I’m so happy for youuuu and you did it all by yourself !!!!!!!
I literally wish I could be her friend 😂 Shes so peaceful and has such a chill vibe.
Kinda miss her old videos, I’m happy for her if she is happy, but I feel like she’s distant. She doesn’t give us forehead kisses anymore :/
PLEASE explain the cheese milk thing bc I have this too
Emma whats good woman? Let me take you out or cook to you why we catch up drinking coffee ☕ 😏
we need a cooking w remi + emma chamberlain video
this sounded a lot like Diresta videos it was great
i don't even like peas and i want to make this
lovee this
Maybe your next chapter is a recipe book :) thats a great hobby and skill If you would have blended the peas I bet you would have gotten that green color :)
Emma you should definitely go to culinary school I believe you would be an amazing chef. You definitely got raw talent
Not gonna lie but this video relaxed me, I love u emma<3
the try guys but make it emma chaimberlain without a recipe
I really wanted to know about the cheese explanation ☹️
Two cute little fingerling potatoes completed the plate for real 🤌
we really went from cooking with emma which was so fun and chaotic to this boring thing :/ a glow down for sure
if emma cooked for me i could die happy
I care emma, I care.
as an avid soup maker u couldve blended half the pease you boioled just to inhance the pea flavour but they way you made it was also absolutely perfect
Hey Emma great pro tip…. Run your hands on stainless steel after your finished washing garlic and onion off. The acidity of the onion gets rubbed off with the alkaline of the stainless steel. Enjoy!
good soup
Cooking is very much therapy for me, glad you have discovered it.
you should look up -grašak- its a serbian dish very similar to what you made
this is very reminiscent of how to with john wilson even down to the music, i love it tho
Im here for Emma's cooking journey... The growth that can come from this hobby is unimaginable.
loving this podcast video concept tbh
this is my new fav short film
can you make a cooking youtube. or cook book! or bring back cooking with emma!!!!!
I love the pea shots
hi bae
which parmesan do you use? i can never find any vegetarian ones
yea i love onion
Next time, you should cook the peas and potato together in the broth (add potato 15 minutes before the end, and peas like 5 minutes), it will give them a lot more flavour. Looks so good though! Xx
My brother just saw me watching this video and he was like "What are you watching? What is this?" and I spontaneously replied "I'm watching a friend" 😳😳😳 Emma... you're my friend 😢❤️❤️
she makes cooking soup from scratch sound like what writing a thesis feels like
The music near the end during the soup boiling montage made my stomach turn 🥺😵‍💫
thats a lot of fucking peas emma
Yes I love onion and garlic. You caught me ! Busted !
Remember when Emma’s voice was raspy
Nice one
the armpit comment was too funny
That soup looks legit!  And good af
Having some soup with your peas Emma?
Good soup👌
You can get something called stainless steel soap at a kitchen store, it’s just a piece of stainless steel shaped like soap and you rub it on your hands to get rid of strong smells when cooking like garlic or onions!
is she still using an editor? If not omg she's grown so much!
Emma: You love onion and garlic Me: No, I actually genuinely HATE those particular allium veggies! 😐
Emma got me cracking up about the garlic and the shallot smell sticking to the hands 😂😂 so relatable 😂
Me eating a full plate of Dino nuggies watching this like 👁👄👁
Emma has fantastic potential to host a cooking channel. She has a way of making everything seem more understandable and down to earth.
my mom would make a meeeaaann delicious green split pea soup w potatoes and carrots, and it would come out a vibrant green so she makes a lot of sense even though the execution wasn’t what she hoped ❤️
you should look up `Peas soup recipe´, the first link its usually the one my mother follows through ;)  only if you are interested of course.
I’ve made soup three times this week and it brings me joy
this is giving very much john wilson how to
"I think I understand why people enjoy cooking" Me, who has never eaten a single food stuffs in my entire existence: wut do U mean
i miss u
good soup
I would watch this series, “Would I get this at a restaurant and how much would I pay?”
,  pay you 17.50 (bargain) for some of that soup
emma.. your videos are what keep me going. keep me thinking that i don’t have to be “that” girl. and i can be me and leave a mess and not feel like it’s not “aesthetically pleasing”
Babe the stuff on the shallots is dirt! Cuz they come out the ground, you just gotta wash em
Ahhh how much I missed you
Every time I feel bad or just want to feel inner peace I watch Emmas videos cause this do be like meditating and feeling loved at the same time
hey emma you should get master class and watch the cooking videos they’re super helpful taught me a lot about the basics
Garlic girl
I love you so much Emma but it’s pronounced boo-yawn with a silent n
this soup is basically what we call 'SNERT" in the Netherlands but we mix everything and not just let the peas and stuff unmixed lol
I LOVE YOUR COOKING VIDEOS
COOKING WITH EMMAAAAAA
17 dollars are very specific 😭
I love just listening to these videos and getting work done! Their is something so calming about listening to your voice
9:50 did you just- use the strainer on the soup but then added the precipitate anyways? wtf?????
Only here because of Matt colbo
You have inspired me to consider the idea of not being a picky eater
Your soup game got nothing on me
i’ve had a pretty shitty day, thank you for making me smile <3
God I love how Emma expresses herself!!
good soup
Wonderful job Emma ( ˘ ³˘)♥︎
I love seeing you proud of yourself!! Go you little chef queen you 🤌🏼🤓🧡
i had the same blender and then all of a sudden it started smoking and it smelled so burnt and i literally thought it was gonna blow up
this is so ASMR i fuckin love it
same girl, if i drink a glass of milk i don't feel good, but if i eat cheese my stomach won't hurt
I need to mack soup soon
Hey what's the colour of Emma's nail polish at 0:31?? I really love it
I remember every time I tried to compliment a girl she would call herself a potato, like damn if I wanted to insult u I would
Anyone else holding their breath while she was blending the absolute crap out of the boiling hot broth?! Be careful blending hot items as the steam creates pressure and it can explode.
LMAO WHY DID THE WINE TAKE LIKE 20 YEARS TO ACTUALLY GET TO HER MOUTH
Love you Emma, your content is great and I look forward to watch it each time 🥰
This is now my favorite cooking channel
im proud of you emma <3
i love everything about this video.
Good soup
she’s so therapeutic
Emma's so relatable. It's insane, same age, same cooking craze right now 🤍 ily Emma. Thank you for keepin it real since the beginning
I might kms after watching this
This made me extremely happy. This voice over was interesting, the footage was satisfying, the editing (as usual) was brilliant. Bravo, Emma!
this is literally one of the most comforting videos i've ever seen
Lmao grašak sa sirom 🤣🤣
pro tip for onion and garlic smell, to remove it just buy one of those stainless steel “soaps” <3
I love Emma, but I hate the voiceover omg
im so proud of her bc who remembers those birthday cake cupcakes 😣🥺
I feel like i just watched a documentary called. The Soup.
You should learn this Evanescence song like KS. 🥁  https://youtu.be/j1WFyN_tE2E
good soup
I think if you would have blended a few peas with the broth it would have given it the more green color you were looking for.
there’s an arrow on the lid of the blender and an arrow by the handle, if you just line them up every time you don’t have to keep turning the lid until it clicks!!
Emma wrong knife when chopping !!!
This was really great. I love your content. I needed a break from studying and I find that your videos are perfect for that.
This was the most interesting video ive watched all year i swear
Haha how is this actually so good and funny
i was today years old when i found out you were famous famous lol
The lone pea at 2:20 😭😭
K is it just me or like does anyone else love the smell of onions and garlic? 👀
So many Van and Casey Neistat vibes going on
Garlic is the best. A recipe says add 3 cloves and I'm like ok, I'll do 8. 😅
emma, your cooler than being cool this video was a masterpiece comically and experimentally
this is the cutest thing i’ve ever watched
not me watching this alone at 2am and then Emma adding creepy sound effects at the end... hotel Cecil vibes shit
every soup is 3/10 for me
Ok I am 5 days late but now I think Emma has now taken her first step of becoming a good cook because the day u understand that cooking is literally an art and it needs patience.A good cook knows how cooking your food on slow flame enhances it's taste. I am truly proud of you Emma <3 You have really grown up ☺️
I like Voiceover Emma
you forgot forehead kiss >:(
Pro tip: if you have a stainless steel sink you can rub your hands on it to get rid of garlic/onion smell. They also sell stainless steel “bars of soap”
Good soup
I remember when Emma could barely make pancakes, look at her now. I’m so proud.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I miss my forehead kiss
if you ever make this recipe again try blending some of your peas in with the soup broth!! it'll give the broth the greener color ur looking for and give it a little extra pea flavor
I literally hate cooking but after watching this video i made the best avocado toast everrr so thx for the inspo ur a queen
is no one talking about a screen on the toaster or is it just me!!??
@emmachamberlain 8:38 I CARE!! CHEESE AND EGGS DOESNT BUG ME BUT ALL OTHER DAIRY PRODUCTS DO ID LOVE TO KNOW
i already was planning on making soup yesterday cuz it snowed in boston but now i have a recipie sorta inspired by you. thanks emma
reeking hands of garlic and onion and peppers smells so good and is so good until ur dog OR cat who is an attention wh0re isnt leaving u alone bc she wants to be near u all the time and doesnt understand that its toxic lmao
I'm glad you're back sweetie
wanna make that soup aahk
proud of ur soup emma hope it was tasty
she's gonna open a restaurant in the future mark my words
Make collie and broccoli soup an go with it
reminds me of sheperds pie in soup form without the ground beef
your vlogs now are like the behind scenes of a vlog that you would upload in 2019 haha i love it
wholesome
omg I need to cook this asap. you are the best!! love from Ukraine
Sa va
Is Emma still living in her rental??
If you want the soup to turn green add Matcha powder 😅🤷
Emma you are a confident person. you fear the result may not be good but still you dont back up from it, you give it your 100%. i love that about you, you inspire me. now if you ask me about some cooking advice, the one thing i learned is less is always more.   stuff that i would do if i cooked this exact soup -  put the potatoes, peas, maybe carrots with the onions, garlic on the pan and fry them on low heat till the onions are fried. ( no boiling,  the potatoes would get a nice color too in the oil)  then put water and other ingredients (salt, pepper, pre made veg broth paste) , stir, cut the basil and also put that in. let that shit boil for 10 mins on medium heat, and you have a soup. the aroma of everything will be on the broth, and you can have a bite of everything, fell everything, garnish that with cheese, do you. be happy. eat healthy. i wanna be the big sis of Emma and cook together. this video just made me so happyyyyyyyy
i live in the netherlands and we call it ewrtensoep or snert.. its not the same as how you made it but it is a real thing here ((:
wish i could get a taste
No one‘s talking about how she‘s saying bouillon? Boy-on 🙂
i love seeing this version of emma! so authentic and inspiring and relatable simply by being herself
this video makes me feel safe
You should blend half the peas into the broth and make it greener!
everytime she uploads a video i sit for therapy
good soup
I hope she’s ok
emma, i really enjoyed this video
the stormy season made me wanna have soup ooilasdkajd
watching this in a hotel cause hotels are boring am i right………………………?
cooking with emma had a glo up
only emma can make pea soup cinematic
when can we buy ur cook book???
this made me happy for no reason😭
I love u Emma okay bye
EMMA YOUR SOUP IS AMAZING MY FAMILY LOVED IT WE ATE IT WITH RICE
Longest title Emma's done in a while 😂
as someone with an ED i feel so happy watching emma enjoy food this much thank you emma i love you<3
good soup
this is comforting, thank you for making
How nice it is when this girl say" I hate wasting food." Emma just becomes the Food Therapist!!   .. Me too i hate to screw up fresh lovely raw food.
Next time blend everything. I bet that would be yummy to.
Chamberlain Soup Co. coming to your local grocery store
Emma these peas are gonna give you bad stomachache
i missed u girl
good soup
I have that exact same blender and have to do the exact same thing with the lid every time. That soup looks delicious and I will definitely be making it, I love you and your videos Emma.
I learned from my mom if you rub your hands on something stainless steel under water it gets rid of the garlic or onion smell. Not sure why it works but it does.
I am just happy that she is one of those rich kiddies that actually uses the giant kitchen she has..so many dim influencers flex with their luxury apartments but never cook in these fancy kitchens, while so many people who love cooking sit in micro apartments.
Thank you beautiful soul <3
at 1:42 I really turned my volume up to 100% ..
this is the best video I‘ve seen from you ☝🏻😆
Why tf was I told to watch this channel??? This is basic cave man brain stuff. Thought she was funny and it’s just not…
Hey emma u probably won’t see this but I seriously love u so much and u don’t even realise but uve helped me sm. Uve helped me get into journaling and cooking and those have really helped me with my mental state and it is getting better because of u. I love u and I hope u have a great day!!💗
love the title and the whole video so so good!💕
so proud of you and who you are becoming
i love her voice
i love you sweet girl
I just watched this whole thing wtf  I think I am gonna make the soup ❤️
Missed you Emma!!!!!
I know this sounds crazy, but rub your hands on the inside of your sink if they smell like strong cooking smells. It makes it go away.
Lol you saying “research” keeps reminding me of Jiraiya from Naruto😂😅
Just press the garlic with a knife. It peels out almost all of it
I feel like if Emma went to a prestigious culinary school she would thrive. It would be super stimulating for her and would allow her to be present fully. Just a thought!!
Okay i'm Egyptian and in my culture it's an ordinary meal and it called "vegetables soup " it includes other vegetables too
My mom liked ur videos
good fucking soup
This is art. 🧐
ur my favorite person ever
I love anion and garlic
This is the best video. Please post more cooking videos!! Love the chill vibes.
I want to try to make this soup!! It looks so good. One think I’d suggest to make it look greener is to blend half of the soup after you’ve added the potatoes and green peas. That way, you add creaminess, the soup is greener, and you still have some full peas and potatoes on your plate to enjoy :)
How are people saying she is boring her videos are so good she doesn’t deserve the hate she’s getting I love her videos
Good 😉 👍🌷
Perhaps adding cream to the base and blending in the peas? That sounds delish too 😍
i am proud of you emma!
Pls upload more. i lvoe ur vlogs. ur so funny i miss u
i love this so much. the serotonin.
Soup awesome. Lose the “F”. Really. Brilliant women don’t need it.
Missed you <3
Why is the commentary so funny lmao
EMMA you should travel to Edinburgh. It’s my favourite city in the world and I think you’d love it <3
I appreciate and love you emma
Me watching this while eating something random I just cooked: salmon with lemon and cream, with pesto pasta on the side and some broccoli and cauliflower. Haha, love you Emma! ♥️
Try an Instapot.
this video is kind of incredible and reminds me of the documentarian John Wilson who has a show with HBO. a really cool form of story telling!
i missed u
Jesus is our savior
Emma!!! us Greeks make something extremely similar to this, except we don't tend to eat it as a soup. idk it's just a simple dish i guess. so cool how you thought of it all by yourself tho, without even knowing that it's a legit thing!
That was awesome. This style was really good. Please do again
emma is the sweetest
Hard aged cheeses have less lactose 😌 Parmesan my love my life
Try searching aloo matar it’s a really old Indian recipe and it’s literally potato and peas . Hope it helps ❤️✨
You need to get yourself an immersion blender. It's a lot easier than transferring the soup in your blender.
Emma Chamberlain Cook Book coming soon??? Chamberlain Coffee Recipe Book would be nice toooo
U auxeline chamberlin sis
The same plastic you throw on the ground can go too the sea and be eaten by the same fish that’s been served on your plate,stop poisoning yourself and your loved ones ~use a thrash can❤️❤️
what a movie
i cannot stress enough how much i dislike cooking. yet, watching you cook is a great experience and it's made me dislike cooking a lot less. so, thank you emma.
This content is giving ANYTHING GOES extended visual version and I'm here for it
$17
Emma I totally caught you doing the same nails as my girlfriend wth 🗿
The grey thing around the shallots is just dirt.. you should wash them after peeling the skin.. it should come right off
i want soup
Just spent 12 minutes watching emma make what is essentially aaloo matar sabzi
Congratulations on making your first recipe ❤️
Bone broth heals the whole body, I would love to see you incorporate that in your soup/food.
This was the best soup journey ever
I aspire to be as bougie as Emma's toaster
I never thought I’d want to try pea soup so bad
How do you mess up scrambled eggs tho lol
This reminds me of Joanna Ceddia videos
esto es lo mejor de mi día siempre
You make me feel so calm. I got the flu yesterday and I feel terrible, couldn’t eat anything. But then I saw this video , turned it on and I calmed down, laughed and enjoyed my food a little bit more. Thank you for making me feel just a little bit better!
This is filmed Like a really bad after school special…😂
hey emma i thought this was my moment to share a recipe that is so similar to what you were thinking to make I'm from Portugal, and here we eat potato and peas basically like you made it, but we add things that make it so tasty, and that's just one of the best comfort food, like mint(idrk if this is the right name), egg (with the melted orange part omfg) bacon or chorizo ok byebye
17 dollars for a soup? that's 7 dollars where I live hahahaha
it's ShalOt, like the O in Tom... someone had to say it :/ love you xo
emma's next project is going to be in the filmmaking industry. i can feel it
Hmmm *good soup*
I love cooking. I love u 😌
Looks gross sorry girl
i never could have imagined how exciting a video about soup could be.
I got all the ingredients and trying out this recipe tonight for my family! Thanks for this!
Emma ur going b iconic
i'm from austria and a good soup is about 5 - 11€ max     is soup really that expensive in the us/la?

Emma I love onion garlic shallot so much you are so right
Emma I love onion garlic shallot so much you are so right
this was amazing
dude i love you
All the video was so accurate that at one point I  stopped and I asked myself: "is she making a metaphor of her life by telling us a story on how did she make this soup?"... and then I got it: "oh no, it's just another video of Emma Chamberlain". PURE ART
LOVED this. Also she had me cracking up when she strained the soup and then dumped what she strained back in the pot😂😂💀💖
The soup would lot better if she used blender
Every time she said bouillon incorrectly I visibly cringed 🤣 - Louisianan
Why the grandmas are into this shit ya know I love that lmao
This makes me miss living alone so much it hurts I can't stand living with people I miss cooking in peace
low heat is textbook especially for eggs. :] good soup. I wanna make some tomato and basil soup now and hmm chicken soup.
I hate to cook, I hate peas, but I loved this video.
Lol the Indians would know it’s an actual dish basically a curry you eat with chapati if you guys know what it is
you inspire me to do something with my life
i really love these simple videos, its a nice breath of fresh air to just watch emma make soup and take a break from my thoughts :)
love how she just talks about soup the whole time and have my full attention throughout the video LMAO
Do more do more!!!!
well done em, looks delicious
can she please post a video of her making scrambled eggs 😩
I honestly think I spend too much time editing. 😵‍💫😂
emma why did you not wash your hands before cutting the shallot
J seeing this video after seeing her post about her soup on insta j makes it that much more like I’m watching Emma in her own little world
The part about your arm pit had me dead 😂😂😂
I think Emma might be struggling with an eating disorder. She's been making a lot of food centric videos and seems to focus on specific foods (cuts out certain food groups). I wish people didn't glorify people's diets and bodies. You never know someone's story
LOVE
Can Emma direct a movie PLZ
Can Emma make a movie plz
Petition for Emma to release a cookbook.
OMG! i totally just caught you making soup.
never thought I'd ever teared up because of an Emma video of cooking _soup._ My feet automatically dragged me to the kitchen right away
Cooking School in France!  Take an intensive class…..
more of this
This was so wholesome
go emma, be happy cooking
Quuueeeeeennnn
Should have added cream of mushroom or chicken. Would have looked and probably tasted better
Gorgeous gorgeous girls love soup
Hey Emma. You can blend half of the Pea/Potatoes add to broth with the rest of whole peas and potatoes. You’ll get your Green colour then 🌿🌱☘️
But rice and chicken
I tell the whole wide world that I  cant cook
I love this
I know they can cook than me
😂😂😂
Boy-on 😅😅😅😅 oh no no no
loveeeeee
emma! this was such a joy to watch, i love the way you talk about food. just a tip for your next try at this recipe, blend half of your peas with the liquid to make it greener and toss in the other half with the potatoes (cut them into chunks for more visual appeal) so you get the color + texture combo you were talking about! keep if up angel!! can't see what you'll cook up next :) (ps. i tried the spicy mint tahini sauce you made a few videos back and it. was. amazing.)
not her freaking $350 toaster EMMA you're such an icon
Para sacarte el olor a ajo, Tenes que ponerte limon en las manos y dedos!!
favorite human being
You could go back to school and become a chef 👩🏼‍🎓
Emma narrating herself is definitely me in my head when doing a new task expecting to fail
Handcuffs please?!
Awe I’m happy Emma found out that cheese doesn’t hurt her stomach
The thumbnail 🤣
I'm so proud of Emma, she's becoming such a wonderful and beautiful soul ❤
I'm extremely happy for her even though her content has evolved into something that isn't targeted to people like me anymore. Love you Emma and thank you for everything I've learned from watching you, it's been a quite a trip, I wish you the best ❤‍🔥
I fucking love peas.
30yrs cooking and yes, it’s a true gift. Self-reliance through a sometimes zen like process. Knife skills provide added confidence toward experimentation of HOW you incorporate ingredients...and save fingers. 🥰 https://youtu.be/G-Fg7l7G1zw
I love this video!!
🥳🥳
i can't believe she's never made soup before this
Hehe..this is intense!
why am i eating these peas rn and it’s the first thing i see when opening the video 💀
In the netherlands we have something like this! It is called “ewrtensoep” 😘
this is iconic
Emma, I LOVE THIS VIDEO! I love the voiceover so much. Good job lil chef!
i loved this so much ⭐️
Wow. This is the most well done YouTube video I’ve seen in a long time.
IM THE SAME WAY i can eat all the cheese but if i drink milk my stomach kills me
Hey Emma! Since you don’t like wasting food, you can make your own veggie broth with all the ends of veggies you don’t use. Save all your food “waste” (even rinds of cheese) and put it all in a pot at the end of a week, cover in water and let simmer for a couple hours then season to taste. You can then use this as a base to a lot of your meals. I save mine in mason jars and use it to make sauces and cook rice/grains. Love that you are on a food journey :)
Parmesan is not vegetarian lol
How did Emma just make peas so interesting? 🧐
is this her new home?
♥️
imagine u make a cooking channel i love hanging out with u emma ure really my comfort person <3
Gorgeous girls eat soup
Damn I'm gonna make this soup now
💚💚
💚💚
shal (lot) not shal (let)
I actually do love onion and garlic and especially smelling my hands afterwards 😂 it’s like part of the experience
i do care- i want to know the science behind why the dairy in cheese won't hurt your stomach and the dairy in milk will, Emma
Bro maybe do something else with your platform there’s so many things you can help with in this world
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH
Blending some of the peas would have made a pretty green broth! Beautiful soup! Looks delicious!
Why does she look like Timothee Chalamet lol
I don’t ever comment on vids but ms girl I love these kinds of videos and I so proud of u for doing what you love to do!! You’re doing so great
The attention to detail wow
i love this video format. this was really captivating to watch & your commentary was fun & witty. i loved this, emma. thank you. im looking forward to making this soup :)
Sooo can we get that recipe lol
"i understand why the grandmas are into all this shit"   -Emma chamberlain 2021 december 14th
thank you.
you should probably try ottoman style cooking
All the BEST Mexican dish has a BOUILLON lol you get used to it
you need to make a quinoa grain bowl! It’s super easy and only takes about 20 minutes!
Love 💝💝Emma queen of inspiring 💐💐💐👌👌
Peas are easy so are beans
Good soup xo
Zucchini noodles how do you feel?
Every time I bake or boil anything it’s never full done :( but the pasta I made yesterday worked out!!
DAMN $17?!
These recipes save my mental
Wait let’s elaborate on that cheese thing?! I’m going through the same phase. But I have to stick to alondmilk creamers and etc because it’s a rough subject
The damn pause after the armpit juice moment was such a mood lol
you have to try leak & potato soup with pee’s. it is so good & creamy!
Love ❤😘❤😘❤😘❤😘 for you
You should check greek recipe - Αρακάς με πατάτες - green peas with potatoes
🥰🥰🥰🥰
I cannot get over how you say bouillon. You have to pronounce the L’s babe..
Good soup
Living comfortably is such a flex rn 😭😩
Please do a car review like in Top Gear
Take a cooking class??
EMMA please go to culinary school in NY. Please haha
don't forget to wash all produce! this includes onions and avocados :) when you cut into the vegetable, all bacteria from the outside is pushed inside.
GIVE QUEEN EMMA A COOKING SHOW
bring old emma videos back
Forsure let seeing your vid and put off watching it and everytime I saw it I thought it said you caught me making soap watched it and realized you were making soup lmao
I love how specific these $17were
alex ernst and emma chamberlain radiate the same energy
Patrick Bateman style of video
i think this is my favorite video on the internet
very very very berry very berry very very berry very concerned
Emmas channel is slowly turning to a cooking channel. And im livinggggggggg
hey everyone, does anyone know what type of camera emma uses. If you do just reply to this comment and let me know.                 tnx<3
emma it’s so different lately i don’t even recognize her ig it’s time to let go :(
Love this style of video!🔥🔥
Please make more videos like this omg yesss queen 🥸💕
LMAO the transition in 10:59
Hey, my tip for cooking good soup with any veggies you want:  1. Cut garlic and onions 2. Cut veggies you want,  (for example potatoes and carrots, since they have a similar hardness you can cut them into same sized pieces and have them cook together till they are done. If you choose other vegetables that don’t have the thickness or hardness like a your other vegetables, you have to adjust it: either you cut them for example celery in the same size as the potatoes and put them in the pot a little after or you cut them a little bit bigger so that they can cook together with the rest. In the end it’s all about your feeling, but you can always google how long the vegetable has to cook and so adjust it to your other vegetables. Anyways back to the recipe. 3. put oil in the cold pot, (never olive oil, it’s not suited for cooking on high temperature only for salads. Use coconut oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil. You can even put a tiny bit of butter to the veggie oil for flavour but only butter may have the risk to get burnt easily.) 4. put garlic and onions in the cold oil and let them heat up together not too high not too low (in Germany I use a 6., if that may help anybody) 5. do not let them get brown or burnt! When they are shiny you can put your veggies in the pot and stir so that every veggie is covered in a bit oil. (The oil makes the veggies get hot on all surfaces and save the flavours) 6. After a few minutes you can put the water with any broth you want: you can use veggie broth from the supermarket, self made broth, chicken broth, there are many but for starters, zause veggie broth from the store and put it in the water. Don’t forget to read on the package how much you need for your amount of water! 7. Now bring the water slowly to bubble, don’t heat up to max right after you put the water bc it isn’t boiling. It takes a bit and don’t forget to cover with your lid! 8. Now be careful and don’t let you water boil too hard, once it boils with the lid you can go down with the temperature slowly step by step. Once it’s hot with the lid you will only need a small heat and it will cook perfectly. Set your timer for the food and always check on it!  8. Then you can season while it cooks with any spices you want. In the beginning simple is always the best and after you can try different recipes! 9. Always taste and adjust to your desire!  But the most important thing is to cook with all your live and heart. If you put love into the food, it WILL taste good, I promise!
You should boil your potatos with the soup, or the 20 minutes + the soup boiling time will make them very very soft to the point where the potato falls apart
A $17 pea and potato soup better fucking slap
i was waiting for her to say “good soup” 😭
This feels like a college essay but I’m here for it rnh
EMMA YOUR TURNING INTO A MOM
@EMMA A SILVER SPOON .. WASH UR HANDS WITH IT AFTER GARLIC/ ONION... REMOVES THE SMELL

No forehead kiss?
It’s really funny watching Emma become an adult and doing basic tasks that come so natural to me like cooking
see u in another 3 weeks Emma
this was surprisingly entertaining. I quite enjoyed this lol
emma ratatouille version
A nice title would be  17 dollars
this is my favourite video of yours
go little rockstar moment
I love this but please for the love of god use your knuckles as a guis for your chopping!!! it protects your fingers and makes chopping quicker and easier ❤️❤️
Emma you are so wholesome I love you
pea soups are usually with mint! but i bet basil would be super nice too:)
Good work emmaaa❤️❤️
"you LOVE garlic!" as I am eating a piece of garlic
Idk why i stopped waching her for a minute, but i missed her😓❤️
čorba🤌
Emma, those sounds you add at the end of your videos are making my cat freak out.
"I don't say this a lot but I'm fucking proud of myself" 🥺 same Emma ❤️‍🩹
Am I the only one that misses how her old videos were made?
The soup turned out to be very beautiful and delicious !!😋🍲👍
Glad you're breaking the chain/loop of instant gradification :) Way to go!
we love seeing Emma maturing ❤
Emma I love you, I love your work, I love your narrative.  For the love of God, what the f*ck us that soup. (10 years a chef)
4:54 low and slow is the way to go
You can remove the grey stuff by Washing the shallot
Emma dont forget about bagels. I just remembered they are a thing and forgot how goood they are tho lol. Also remembered that you used to love them too:)
okay so my psychic a** wakes up, notices the date and notices another 17 and thinking, what's the significance of 17 rn?? about 20mins later i get on youtube, you're the first video i click and it's good soup you would sell for $17. why did i just make a connection to you and good soup? hahaha good work creating the good soup of your dreams dawg looks tasty
Try it again and make it green (somehow) or make a different soup that you have in mind. I enjoyed this x
In Turkey we have this food. But instead of using vegetable boullion we use tomato paste. Alo we add chopped carrots.
you were making soup for you! I was trying to figure it out the whole time, but I wasn't sure who it was for. It seems enjoyable for sure
Emma it has been 6 months since you moved to the “rental” that you currently stay in, soooo what about the house?? Are you moving soon???
I’m watching this as I’m making chicken noodle soup
I disliked by mistake and I want to cry because it said sharing your feedback with the creator
So proud. love u Emma
Emma putting the whole recipe in the description is just 👌🏻😭👌🏻✨
تضحك 😭😭
I’ve never felt so relaxed before. This specific video gave me an inner peace that I cannot simply explain.
Good soup 🤚🏼
cooking w Emma a series that should be permanent
i feel like emma imagined this one soup recipe i tried that has basil, broccoli, spinach, and potato which i’m sure would’ve been gas with peas in it too
It’s the satisfaction of making it & actually enjoying & liking it 😋
Rub your hands on your stainless steel sink after peeling Garlic and onion and the smell goes away xx
Emma, I think you would enjoy going to local farmers markets for some of your fresh fruits and veg. Your soup looks yummy <3
Emma that happens to me too!!! Milk is the worst for me!!! Cheese is totally fine!
I want to try some of that soup!?
I don't even like peas but I want to try the soup so bad
bruhh ew
I'm convinced that I'll even watch emma reading her grocery list for 2 hours straight
I’ve always loved cooking lol , glad you love it tooo!!!! Much love emma
pea pea caca
Aw love this for you queen
I really miss you 🥺
emma really has those mom cooking hands
cooking while emma cooks is bestie vibes
nice. You could mix some of the peas with the soup base to make it more green and creamy
dude youre fucking hilarious and my favorite youtuber ! please keep being your beautiful self!
I hate this video omggg when i cant listen to the sound of the stuff she’s doing and triggers me so much ughh
what happen the English get you for your fish and chips - that is where those smells come from- if puss smell like fish - you can play snow white Disney - kiss it -- no get a blood test before having sex or get smelly arm pits and belly rot [ lymph nodes glands in overload ] red blood cells carry oxygen white cells carry cure -and the sulfur in onions are building blocks to make mussel and other things - cooking is brain surgery and cod liver oil will draw out the poison in your temple body master chef can cure itself like doctor  - blood test animal before eating it - a kitchen is a lab - got to get into some dry aging  good penicillin on meat - freeze drying last 20 years like a good bourbon that don't give you a headache because removed the head - so when robot come out it becomes a lost art just hope kosher meal and kings are not in charge of the food because they will feed you the shit and shit end so eat shit and diamond on their finger so can smell the farts that linger - it's like turning you into a lampshade so burn in hell
You should try a Swedish potato and leek soup! It sounds gross I know but it’s amazing
good job Emma
emma is going through some weird ass experimental phase cinematography wise... I like it.
kick it up a notch by adding demi glace. Im not sure if you can buy that. Maybe
good soup 👌🏽
😂x299
i think u just cured my depression
and she put the recipe in the description box 😩 we don't deserve you emma
i missed youuuuu
The increasing disarray of the kitchen made me anxious…clean as you go lol
Gorgeous gorgeous girls love soup
Stop because youre so funny hello?
*Good soup*
emma if you hate wasting food you should start composting
i’m happy for you but your spoon of choice is horrendous
for some reason the ending, when you said that you'd pay $17 dollars for this at a restaurant, that made me really happy.
FINALLY A VIDEO
could post videos like this and i'll still sit through it all
Odpuść sobie kobieto,ja jak gotuję ,czasami wiem co robię
Emma …. I FREAKING HATE PEAS ….. but some how …. Someway I was so entertained and invested the whole time. I think you’re onto something
this video is ART emma. ACTUAL ART. so happy that ur editing again, what a gift you have.
Good job Emma you made jelban bel marga. Famous algerian dish. We eat this 5 times a week
this soup literally looks delicious might have to just go buy the ingredients and make it myself👀
Delicious soup, I made as close as possible, except for salt, Basil and garlic with two shallots, 2nd day/ night, added a 1/2 cup of rice, had plenty to finish off, I’m thinking to make split pea soup, just 2 or 4 times the amount of peas, and add , “”maybe “” 4 - 5 “” THICK applewood smoked bacon, cut it cold in 1- inch lengths, slow/ low heat skillet with lid, rendering until crisp, cook shallots , garlic, in some of bacon rendering, same recipe but more peas then adding little bacon, for altered flavor , make scratch biscuits, Soup Ready when biscuits go in oven, “” extra browned biscuits “”, hmm someday, I hope. Love The Soup, thx. ❤️
This is giving very “How To With John Wilson” vibes! Maybe it’s the narration over the documentary-style shots lol
Well up front I am 62 and an Emma fan, sorry you want to like say I don't know you now. But I admire your journey and how you did Not do the main stream YT stuff but went on your own journey and that is why you are a true influenzer off the main stream with a very large following. Even my own sons say how sick and fake others are for views, but admire you cause you are true to you not the main stream, not fake. Be true to you and don't listen to fakers.
Please… I loved the cooking videos when you were bad at cooking but this is even better because I will totally try your recipes!
I LOVe YOU DAMNIT!!! QUEEEEN 😩
I'm inspired. I'm making my own soup now. Thanks!!!
emma i love u
Lmao I can definitely see this soup being $17 here in NYC😭
Emma i love your personality and everything about ya. I think we would be BFFLs if we lived within the same proximity
Love u Emma but u say "buoyon" weird
I love Emma but this video made me realize how much I am wasting my time watching YouTube videos
maybe blend the peas with the soup to make it greener? but ill definitely try this recipe! looks amazing!
I love her videos they make me feel really good and peaceful, no matter what she does
ur supposed to wash the potato peel the potato then cut it, let the water boil and then put the potato in
"it put the pep back in my step" I'm so gonna use that 😄
for anyone that wants a gre[en] soup you can add blanched/boiled spinach or, in this case, take half a cup of peas and blend along with a soup base of whatever your liking. Yes, there will be a spinach-y taste, but it isn’t as strong as you think it’ll be whereas the pea method would give you more of a strong pea flavor. Pesto base can be added. I personally like using spinach. 💕
“and i had done the research, but I don’t think anyone cares” girl i find interesting even the shape of your poop
Blend in like 1/2cup of peas with the stock next time to get a more green colour ?❤️ Love you Emma
Emma’s going to come out with a cook book you heard it here first
19 year old me is just starting to feel this way about cooking. I just learned a new soup too that is literally to die for. Definitely keep making cooking videos omg i love it so much
I started watching emaa today and I am totally loving it. Such a good vibe. Emma, thank you for your videos.
all I have to say, is I love you emma <3
“and i would pay….. $17 for it” had me DEAD LMAOOO
Gorgeous gorgeous girls love soup
This gave me how to with John Wilson vibes and I loved it
"After chopping these terribly"    I was horrified for your fingertips. I gasped as you showed that last chop.
PLS the “very”s i laughed so hard
emma is trying to show us that she’s more into ✨podcast✨ now
Salt your onions while sweating them 😉😊
Wow I want that soup
I rarely comment but I honestly think this was my favourite video of Emma’s. So peaceful and wholesome and I am super inspired to make soup now!
Everyone let’s make this soup & call it Emma’s pea & potato soap !!!!! 🙌🏼❤️
Okay but why does it look good af
you must love washing dishes
Booooringggg
I loved every second of this video.
u should call it pp soup for potatoes and peas
Gorgeous gorgeous girls love soup
Blue
Why does this sound like you podcast I love your podcast
1:15 the peas are shouting
Why are you using such a gigantic knife for little potato’s and shallots? Try a smaller sharp knife, it will make life easier
Emma your doing great and I love all your videos. Learning to cook is good thing and also is too much work, but Emma wash all food before cooking because we never know how much dirty is hiding in , specially vegetable.
Thank fuck you're back. I was starting to worry...
Emma I love you plz learn how to use a knife (safely and properly)😂🤍
send emma to master chef 😇
LMAO THE LONG BREAK BETWEEN “um…” and “anyways” sent me💀💀
how to with john wilson vibes
What kind of soup was this supposed to be?
Stop cause the peas at the beginning really had me fooled for a second. The stoner within me needs to chill THIS IS A WHOLESOME HOME
Or just make more cooking vids
Hello Emma, the dish you envisioned actually exists in my country 😂😂😂 and I love it, my mom adds carrots and artichoke instead... anyway it's called tajine jelbana, look it up ! Good luck with your soup journey 🌞
Can you please make a cooking account I wanna get into making resipiss
OMG I love the specificity of the price you would pay for it...BAM....$17.
vegan parmesan is the best, you just need to put a bit more. but it's worth is. soup is the best.
Note to self “don’t ever eat from Emma’s armpit food”
nice
i hate onions
you should make a cookbook
I love to cook but can’t say I’ve ever had an issue with the onion or garlic smell lingering for very long on my hands, Emma are you not washing your hands at any point?
Omg I love you, your soup looked great:)
Emma not knowing which way her ninja lid goes on is so raw and unedited lmao me
That looks so mother fucking delicious! I must make it.
Trigger warning: peas!
You truly are a genius.
I don't think you're being honest because when cooking begins to excite you that much you don't want anybody preparing your food for you no matter what restaurant you're at because you start wondering where they're cutting Corners that you wouldn't any fast food dishwasher knows that the same Sysco truck delivering Food Service supplies to your local crappy restaurant is the same Sysco truck delivering the same food service supplies to your five-star hundred-dollar a plate hole in the wall
Petition for Emma to make a cookbook
If you cook peas in hot water with a big scoop of baking soda it makes them glow Neon green nearly in the dark

ми то урбано у Србостану зовемо грашком уууу а кад баба направи да имаш за ручак три дана уууу
i can explain why parmigian cheese doesn’t hurt your stomach while milk yes. that’s because the ones who have stomach and intolerance issues can’t eat the fresh cheese products like ricotta, milk, mozzarella and so on because they contain lots of lactose. while aged cheeses, like parmigian, fontina, have less percent or none lactose so they are better for the intestine and stomach issues. next time try the italian parmigiano reggiano aged 24/36 months, it’s the best.
This is giving me podcast vibes
Emma! U are brilliant, beautiful, a poet. You are so in tune with the rhythm of the real world<•3
u make me happy and calm
I cook a lot, and honestly I don’t know what it feels like to have fingers that don’t smell garlic
2:21 that pea on the side looked lonely
This is great content Emma, I am enjoying the music you put alongside the soup pouring ❤️
Okay but what bullion did you use
Get my soup bowl ready & add some Rosemary Toast to boot it looks Parienne.  Emma,well,done. I'm a chive lover too!!!  Man,great now I'm wanting that exact soup!!!
I thought it wasn’t you talking.. Idk😂 you sound different🤷‍♀️
I condemn wasting food
i haven’t watched an emma chamberlain video in years and i figured i’d pop in and see what’s up over here and naturally, with this being her most recent video, i watched it. so wholesome, so inspiring, so proud. love it.
I like all of Emma's content. It's a warm and safe space for me to escape into and away from my daily problems and obstacles, and it's at most the choice of background music and her voice that calms  me, but this one isn't it :(
it's giving "good soup" vibes
You need a smaller knife
I’ve missed your videos Emma. I’m happy you’re back.
safe to say this was the best video i’ve ever watched in my life😭❤️
Emma, do not put anything super hot into the blender. This messes up the plastic used in it. But good job on the rest.
I've always wanted to get into content creation but was always so afraid of the higher-class aspect of it, whatever personal bias that may be of mine. But I've tried to keep my content real and authentic and honest and Emma inspires me every day to keep doing that and to know it'll reach the right people. Everyone commenting that only she could keep our attention for 12 minutes about soup is what makes me love her and content creation so much. You'll always reach the right people when you're doing it for the right reasons and with genuine intent.  This is sappy kind of, but thank you Emma for always reminding me that real people can have a platform and can do things with pure intention - even your genuine excitement about soup does that for me lol. Thank you thank you thank you and love you always! 💛
☺️☺️☺️😘😘😘😘😘😘☺️☺️☺️☺️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😘😘😘
I love you Emma
when i was young in elementary school, my friend natalie came over to my house. It was getting later and my mom was like, she can stay for dinner :) I made broccoli soup :). And being young kids we wanted like chicken fingers or something lol so we were like "uhhhhhh, we are actually going to natalies house for dinner". When we got to her house, her mom was like oh great, I've made potato soup for dinner :). Lmao we were like DAMN :(:(:(. Now I'm 27 and would love broccoli soup or potato soup OR basil pea potato soup :)
Absolutely love you 🤍🤍 you are such a comfort in my life em🤍🤍🤍
I want you’re sweatpants
Don't beat yourself up. It takes practice to get this right. Pro tip: keep lemon juice handy to rub on your hands when you're dealing with onions and garlic. Or you could just wash your hands in between. 😊 Also, what soup you're thinking is probably split pea soup. Thickened with a starch, usually potato.
Hey Emma great soup. my mom taught me to rub my hands on a stainless steel sink to get rid of the garlic/onion smell. it’s a good smell but you know it can get old quick
Why is she good at everything
emma if you want to peel garlic easier place a single garlic clove under your knife while holding your knife flat against the cutting board. then using the heel of your hand press down on the clove under your knife with force. The clove should look a little cracked but the peel should come off easier and you hands will get less sitcky<3
so soothing Emma
💛💛
Emma i missed you so much
soup: the movie
soup looks good but i hate the way she says bouillon😭
Emma gives me The Office filming vibes
This is actually kind of a “مرقة بجلبانة و بطاطا"
Beautiful soup. If you want the base of the soup to be greener, try blending 1/4 or half of the peas with the broth.  Changes the color but retains the texture of the whole peas :)
As a cooking person, this hit different
I like how you added a little bit of soup to the peas.
Am I the only one wondering why she thought the skin on the shallot was bad?
You know you're down bad for cooking when you start to like the smell of garlic on your hands. Lol Emma, been there
Take a shot every time she says shallot
Missed youu
I kinda wanna make this cause I personally think it would taste good
bro someone please make this soup and tell me how it tastes 😭
Emma is my comfort you tuber
we neeed more cooking videos this was genuinely so entertaining
can BA try to make this pls
love her but bouillon is pronounced bool-yaan and how she was pronouncing it was driving me insane
If you ever want a thicker consistency look up how to use cornstarch to thicken sauces and soups
Emma wtf with this title? Sounds like a porno movie name girl
I love making soups. The kinds you can make are endless. Keep trying. You can even put tofu in soups instead of meat
Try washing your hands with hand soap and some baking soda. It will help gat that onion smell off your hands 😊
I do love onion and garlic
A bit worried about her hair loss.. :(
Emma you need to boil potato and peas with the broth more longer time. So maybe dont completely boil  the potatos and peas. And mix them with broth and boil it for some time. It will make it more flavourful
You don't have to eat the bad food, just make a compost hole/bin in your garden
a cooking show I'd love to watch 😍
This is a very post modern approach of scripting and editing videos. Emma you are revolutionizing youtube.
The level of serotonin that Emma’s videos give me is crazy
Well, what I gather from most media sites is, at least she isn't doing something disgustingly private that needs to be shared to the World on social media🤷🏻‍♂️
If Emma’s channel turns into a cooking channel I’m here for ittttt!
im about to take an exam and this just totally grounded me and calmed me down
In one of your videos you asked the viewers to suggest a hobby for you. SOAP MAKING!!! Start with Melt and Pour soap. You can add color, swirls, designs...make it your own! Its SUPER fun :)!!!!! ps, take us with you as you become a new soap maker. thx!
Hey Emma, u can easily cut onions if you slice them in half making sure some root is leaft on either half because it holds the onion together when cutting! And for garlic, if you smash it with the flat side of your knife you can peel it way quicker and it gets more fragrant!!
now im hungry
dare I say favorite video …
Love the podcast vibe
Everyone hates cooking until they manage to make something they actually enjoy eating. Nothing worse than cleaning the kitchen after making yourself eat the disgusting concoction that took you two hours and every dish you own to make.
emma you can turn the cheese grater around.  you dont have to wrap your arm around the entire cheese grater.
Made this soup - absolutely delicious. I added carrots with the potatoes and peas and celery to the broth. :)
okay but sorry, this was a boring video.
Love the nails. Short, sweet, classy. Look at every exceedingly wealthy woman, who is NOT in entertainment. Short nails get business done.
Позорище !!! Парашу какую-то приготовила , иди в Макдональдс ......
emma pls do a series about you cooking recipes and saying how much money would you pay for it on a restaurant!
this is art.
-der b jūjj
emma i would love to know why cheese doesn't upset your stomach like milk does because i've had the exact same issue for years and have always wondered whats going on
Killed it 💕🙌🏽🌝
Number One Priority:put your physical and mental health self care needs first  Like if you agree
Emma I don’t like this format please I wanna see you do things. It gives my brain serotonin
DO NOT EAT BURNT FOOD IT'S NOT WORTH IT
<3
I MISSED YOU
Emma if you don’t come out with a cookbook with all of your favorite recipes that you’ve found/ came up with… I will scream lol
Gorgeous gorgeous girls love soup
It's getting borring sorry
I love it
So many of these things are basic European things. the importance of onion and garlic....
Good soup
good job emma<33333333 nothing more satisfying
So proud of you emma! And thank you for sharing your cooking all the time. I'm actually really new at cooking too and honestly I'm realizing it doesn't take much to learn it. I've been really proud of myself. There's so many things I never thought I could make and it turns out I can. Just with a little patience. Thank you for inspiring me and please keep cooking.
Great job. You're on your way. If I had to bet, I'd say in six months you'll have your confidence and start to expand. I applaud your effort
I love how Emma's channel is slowly becoming a cooking channel
i can't express my love for this video, it feels so comfortable
I know you’re vegetarian but you should check out Goop’s Peruvian Chicken soup. It’s very delicious and has whole peas, riced cauliflower, & cilantro. I’m sure they have a chicken alternative!
when emma said “whole potato” i thought she was rlly jus about to throw a couple uncut potatoes in😂
i loved everyone second of this
your video style is so peaceful 🥺 ps. please be careful not to put hot things in a blender bc the steam can explode the blender and you’ll burn your face!! eek
This was a good video. I liked this video.
Hey
GO LITTLE ROCK STAR look at you making your own recipes. Someday this soup could be “great grandma Emma’s basil pea soup recipe” everyone wants
I love to cook, I make homemade yogurt, jelly and a lot of other stuff.
id recommend putting the potatoes and peas in the soup before and letting them cook there! the peas as you said would only take a minute so id put them in in the end but the potatoes could cook with the broth! it gives the potatoes a more rich flavor i fink
Emma please look up “Dutch erwtensoep” or “Dutch snert”. It’s like this soup, but mushed together. It’s kinda our national dish lol I think you’ll like it
In Greece we call this soup arakas ,good soup emma😻
I had misseddd you bestieeee🥺
I love how Emma rates these dishes. Like I do that in my head probably but her saying it out loud is everything lol
Adding this to my cooking Playlist, aka, recipes I wanna try making
you’re on 11.1m rn lit. also is ur new cooking passion influenced by mr weismanns tasty chef skills
momma chamberlain 😍
Can't wait for you to drop that cookbook
permeseqn doesnt have lactose, that's why it doesnt screw you over
Dont forget the oil.
I had to make sure anything goes wasn’t on but this was lovely 🥺
emma, I might be the only one who's sad that your tiktok era is gone but I'm actually really happy too! tiktok is a platform with toxicity and embrace which can be very confusing. i also like how at times you take a time for yourself and push away social media. thank you so much for another Beautiful episode.
The recipe in the description box makes me very excited👀
how can watching someone cook soup be entertaining and comforting at the same time
Okay Emma what’s the name of your new restaurant ✨✨🥰🥰🥰
now i want to learn how to cook
Thank you for posting this video.  You have a new subscriber.  Keep up the great work.
Emma! I’m obsessed with the video! Thank you❤️also about wasting food, you should start composting :) or see if there is compost pick up service near you💖
when she struggled to put on the blender lid 😭😭😭
i heard your content got more peaceful… and see your sub count is 11.1….. i think I’m here to stay lol
You must try Ottolenghi's courgette, pea and basil soup!!
Not me having anxiety when she put the broth in the blender and PRESSED A BUTTON before putting on the lid 😅
I wish i had enough money to try any recipe i can find 😗
The Grandmas ?? Duh
I would watch Emmas videos right to the end even if they lasted 4 hours. In fact I wish they did last 4 hours each.
Who else thought their earphones gave on after the armpit conversation 😳🤣
damn I love your vibe and your vlogs. but every time you say bye at the end of the video I know im stressing over nothing (I hope) but I get this sad feeling that you are thinking of leaving YouTube. If you do, know that you have changed millions of lives for the better from the little things like making someone laugh to the big things like inspiring someone to start a youtube channel. you've done both with me, and im sure you've done the same for others. heres hopefully to many more vlogs for both of us and all other creators.
this was so peaceful..you content is not the one trending but the most unique one
bro dont do voiceover.... your nasal twang hurt direct in to ear
This video puts me to shame for disliking green peas. ;(
okayyy chef emma !!!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Put some dish soap on your fingers and rub them on your stainless steel kitchen sink to remove garlic and onion smell, it works!
Open a restaurant and name it “chamber”
I actually carrots that are WASHED!!!  …and lettuce and potatoes.
Emma doing voice over on this video feels like the podcast
I see her baking for the whole neighborhood honestly ❤️
This was extremely calming, thank you
i’m so proud of you.
I love you sm, you help me get thru stuff and ur funny
I think Emma is manifesting having a restaurant and selling the soup for $17
I love this video emma. I definitely will be making this soup. I’m so proud of you for making what you had only thought about before. This video really shows all of us that with a little effort, we too can create our own recipes
she needs to start a restaurant asap
With garlic bread 😩👏🏽🔥
We love hanging out with you
can we make that a serie?
”I don’t think anyone cares” Honestly as longs as you’re talking I care <3
I love the smell of onion and garlic cooking
why does emma remind me of love from you ?
this was so good
I’m here in the comments to tell you Emma - SAVE YOUR CHEESE RINDS (freezer) and add them to your soup while cooking. Incredible
Wow i thought Twitter is cancer,now yt have most diseases
Literally my fave vid of yours ever. As someone that loves to cook and is in the food industry (pastry), I’m so glad you’ve grown to love cooking ❤️
any aussies know what the fug a shallot is
Dutch people make a peasoup in the winter (erwtensoup) that you should really try! It's be a bit like yours, but with more whole vegetables in it. It is a classic winter food here, I think you'd like it
Gotta try this recipe now
You should go to a cooking class a few times a week… and take me with lol🥲🥲
Im prefer a cup of worst coffe on town  .. well nice  try eny way👍👍
What’s the name of the bulyon th
the state of peace that i'm in when i watch your videos is so indescribable they bring me so much comfort and i suddenly have no worries it's like a little escape from reality. i love you
TRIND
Lol I don't really watch your videos but when I do they're pretty cool 👍
So are we all just gonna sit here and ignore the fact that she is clearly struggling with severe anorexia
Go best friend! Learning how to cook and eat which is amazing esp w your Ed recovery and history!
Cooking is a meditation.
please tell me your secret of being able to eat onions and garlic while having IBS; I miss them dearly
Is this food?
kinda miss you
I see her baking for the whole neighborhood honestly ❤️
Make a split pea soup.  This will give you the green broth look.  Make part of the peas be your broth and make some to add later for the whole pea texture and flavor.  When I make ham and peas, I just add it all together.    You might want to try a potato chowder with peas.  It will give you a different texture and flavor.
❤️
"that is so fucking great"
You make living alone seem truly inspiring.
EMMA this was amazing!! lovee the format & the vibes!!! it was like listening to one of your podcasts
im glad to see you back emma, i know you wont see this but i hope youre doing okay :) i love your cooking videos, theyre so pleasing. you clearly have an eye for the creativity of it
Ok im in love with your videoss 🤌🏻🔥
Try that again but blend all the ingredients and add a little cream alternative then you should have the green looking pea soup 🍲
the silence after 💀
literally left us for 3 weeks and i never ran faster to this video
For the cheese thing, Parmasian doesn't have lactose. try and eat other types of cheese to see if you are lactose intolerant
waiiiit did you even season it?
Chives are savory sprinkles.
MY BABY I MISSED YOU
I sat here patiently hoping she was okay and everytime she uploads, I feel like my long distance bestie is just out here striving. So proud and happy to hear her voice again especially in such a productive setting. 🖤
YOU SHOULDVE ADDED PESTO SAUCE
In india we ate this like a sabzi😭😭😭
good soup
this is the best thing ive ever watched
where were you we missed you omg
The aftermath of the cooking was the best part lmfao
I miss you 😢
Missed you!!
Google chefs are chefs too
Please for the love of god Emma peel the clear sticker off of your timer. Ily
Babe if you wanna be sure that things are cooked correctly just try to stick a fork in it if its soft it's ready (also works with cake if the fork comes out clean its properly baked)
emma, when are we getting a cookbook ???
i have this feeling that this whole soup journey is a metaphor for her mental progression over time
Emma is a garlic girl
$17 for a soup.
GOOD SOUP
I feel like a grilled cheese sandwich w/ chilli pepper flakes would go really well together with this mild flavourful soup 😩❤️ Good recipe Emma🔥🙌🏻
suggestion: you could also make pea soup! blend the peas, vegetable broth, basil, and parmesan :)
this felt like a podcast episode, i loved it!
please make a recipe book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice stove / backsplash homie
Emma is an artist
I missed watching these therapeutic videos🤍
Emma you need to try indian food!!
At the end I thought she was going to say “hmm-mm-mmmm the flavors are melting on my tongue” 😭
Does your toaster have a screen….
Joshua Weissman is your friend??
emma i missed you i love you
Loved this journey for you
I’m waiting for people to try and make this soup on Tik tok
I use the headspace app to sleep but I might start using Emma’s video 😅😅 (in a good way) it was perfect!
Emma, please talking about climate change
next time if you want the broth to be green, blend in some spinach and/or kale. It will turn it green the same way it does like a smoothie with basically no flavor!
Sounds like I’m listening to her podcast☺️
EMMA START A COOKING CHANNEL FFS
i missed you
I like this Emma
Dude I could watch her do anything and be entertained
Stop why did I love this video so much.

1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  1 Corinthians 15:1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  Luke 3:13 Except you REPENT you will ALL likewise perish - Jesus Christ  The reason you experience good things now is because you still currently reside in God's presence on God's earth. To be separated from His presence would mean to be separated from the essence of anything good. Also burning. Have you ever burned yourself with a lighter? Imagine that feeling all over your entire body, forever. It's a feeling none of us have ever experienced and it will be one of sheer constant terror and torment for all eternity. Please believe in, and follow Jesus Christ along with repentance. Through the power of the Holy Spirit and true sincere belief in Jesus and what he's done for you, you will turn from your sin and God can make you clean. Jesus is the only way back to God. Do it today. You aren't promised another second.  Fear God and keep His commandments.
Gorgeous gorgeous girls love soup 🫂
Emma we're so proud of you🥺💖
I liked how you were grateful for your food. I kind of take mine for granted sometimes. Japanese people also seem to give gratitude to their food.
It looks like French onion soup a lil.
So Emma, how did the soup turn out? Do you get a Michelin star?
I think she's kinda exhausted to speak in front of a camera (for now) but I appreciate that she's still doing her Youtube channel and sharing things.
It's not that ur soup looks bad, it's that I'm broke but I'd pay $7 for that soup n that's out of my budget ty
No one is born a chef overnight. Cooking takes work. My sister actually is naturally good at it.
Its amazing to see over time a part of your personal growth like your old videos the way you cooked or baked things but sometimes wouldnt turn out the way you expected. Personally I used to cook or try to cook and had zero patience, as a difference to now and it becomes sort of therapy to find that patience and you can taste it in the end what you made. n.n Loved the vid
also whilst you’re cooking - after you’ve chopped potatoes (say you’re prepping to do a lot) put them in a bowl of water so they don’t go brown; the water also helps rinse off excess starch etc. and if you’ve got a little herb garden or something plants apparently love ((cooled)) starchy water (even the water you’ve boiled veg or pasta in) also shallots are in the same family of onion so there’s a v common black/brown mould that forms on them which is why they probably looked a little funky - supposedly it’s harmless???? ((this is off memory pls just google lol))
11.1M subscribers and i was here before the 100k 😭
genial :)
this made me feel so calm and at peace i love u
Are you afraid to die?   Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.

Can we please see Joshua Weissman recreate this dish the way he would "properly" do it?? I wanna see what he would do or any chef really lol
i love love love this video and so excited to see more cooking from you, you are doing so great. Small tips from one clueless 20 year old to another, keeping the tip of your knife on the cutting board while you cut onion, garlic, shallots, all that sort of stuff really helps with control. Also, crushing your garlic before you peel not only makes it easier but also releases this chemical called allison that is where most of the health benefits come from as well. You probably already know this but just in case you don't. Keep being you babes, you are doing amazing:)
Who’s still watching this in 2021?
6:27 If there is one take away from this entire video its this.
emma it was so satisfying watching u chop those potatoes <3
her vids used to be about 20 mins, now its 10. :(
the drama of the music cutting off to "i garnished my soup with some parmesan cheese", hit different
This film style that Emma has begun to utilize is so peaceful. Her journey from more up beat and choppy videos to more documentary style has been so mature and impressive. This new style of hers is why we have been able to maintain interest in her videos as we grow up, as we have grown Emma’s slower, more zoomed and fluid filming style has grown too. We have all begun to feel a sense of nostalgia and comfort with her videos and I’m loving it.
Aweeeeeee it’s so fun to watch you enjoy and be proud of your cooking. I know exactly how you felt and the end of the video when you take a bite of your food and it’s so good you just can’t believe you made that lol
I see her baking for the whole neighborhood honestly ️
Emma trying to put on her blender lid = me trying to insert my USB stick
i haven’t watched Emma in a minute.
Hear me out apples or grapes with cheese… one bite, try it.
I think you found your purpose girl🤩
the way emma is my therapy, she makes me realizes things. She is my safe place, also i love this kinda of videos <3
Thumbnail rlly said |
girl how tf lmao you’re going to cook eggs in high heat? I honestly loved this video. Felt so relaxing 😁
this with noodles looks like it would smack
its bc most hard cheeses are actually very low in lactose content!!!
ive listened to so many anything goes lately that its like oh yay it comes with a video
If you are in cooking, pls learn how to hold a wine glass
I mean, yes !
this makes me happy
too many dishes for a soup 😔 you can see how much i hate cleaning them lol.
That soup looks soooooo good!
Wait wat colour are peas outside of England
I kept wanting to listen to ur talks 😂 I'm amazed idont understand
love you emma good soup
I love the fact that there was actually no talking in the video it was just a solid voice over.
love love love the style of this video!! your soup looks sooo good. thank you for posting <3
love this for you babes, but I'm allergic to peas 🧍🏽#triggered
9:30 i don't think she's taking about the soup here!!!
It looked yummy!!
Repent and turn to Jesus Christ before it’s too late
Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. Both inner and outer holiness is required. Please take time to learn what holiness means and how it pertains to men, and women also. From how we conduct ourselves to how we dress, to our intimate lives with our wives/husbands (what isn’t holy in bed, please learn this also, for a lot of things such as oral or several different positions in bed is an abomination before God). For also many aren’t aware that things such as makeup, women wearing pants, men wearing shorts etc will lead to hell. If you don’t believe me at the very least pray fervently about it and God will confirm. For we will all be without excuse on the day of judgement, “I didn’t know” will not work my brothers and sisters. Walk in holiness and righteousness. Seek the face of the Lord in prayer and fasting, and He will reveal himself to you. Constantly ask Him to baptize you with his Holy Sprit until He does🕊 and when he does you will see a great manifestation (acts 2) Amen ✝️
the amount of authenticity u bring into your videos is truly amazing. & i love the way u let the viewer have such an intimate insight in the way u live. i feel like, that’s kinda the reason i don’t get bored watching your videos. the opposite is the case: i enjoyed every single bit of this video 💛 don’t stop with with what you’re doing, u bring a lot of peace & comfort to people <3
IT COULD BE WORSE IT COULD BE A SANDWICH !!!!!!!!!
Soo proud of you ❣️
Love this & you.. def gonna try to make it myself
make this for your dad please
Emma your hair…….i dont know whats going on but please please see someone and take care of your body
havent been watching for a while since life had taken me over w work and moving from LA to Henderson NV and such. but I just binged watched her vids since august and i fell in love watching all over again. i love the new editing and such; its a bit different but its more transparent and calming. i feel like emma seems in such a rut living in LA and i dont blame her. id feel the same way; thats why i finally made the jump and moved somewhere where its a bit slow pace (Henderson is nothing like Las Vegas). She made me love grocery shopping and the rut of LA got me lazy but now I love it again :D finally got to try trader joes spicy hummus and OMG! I hope she'll find her peace and maybe move somewhere like New York like she always loves. <3
>I get cooking
In the future you should come out with a cookbook :)
onion and garlic are essential to any kind of dinner tbh
GO GIRL
why did i get existential when the soup was done
Someone said she’s an incredibly private person pretending to be an open book and I can’t stop thinking about that
petition for emma to have her own cooking show
why do they call them green peas I thought peas were green by default
MINIMALIST BAKER PEA POTATO AND DILL SOUP
thank you emma
I would take out some of the cooked peas, blend them and add the pureed peas to the soup to make it greener. Want to try making this now 😋
i love u emma<3
Good food is love.  I think how you treat food reflects the love you need and want to give.  I hoard too much of it in my freezer. Unrequited love?  Maybe someday it will jump out and give me a hug. 😂. Seriously, Emma, good job with the soup.  Looked really appetizing.
i love onion and garlic!
This style video was amazingggg, I was genuinely upset when the video ended lol, great job Emma❤️
I love the smell of onion and garlic on my hands and I’m very sensitive with smells.
mmhmmhmhmm, the flavors are melting on her tongue
Lmaooo that armpit shallot comment has me dying. You youngins are so funny love Grandma
I want to give Emma a hug. I feel like she’s my best friend
love the video so much- but am finding the voice over for the whole thing for like a podcast and miss the more blog style filming x
Lol seriously why is this video so relaxing
Emma is so boring can’t believe people watch her
good soup
Just wanted to pause your video to say I LOVE your newfound passion! Your knife practices make me nervous, love.  Might I suggest watching a few videos on safely cutting your veggies? I'm sure you need those precious fingers ❤
Mmmm mmm mmm the flavors are melting on my tOnGuE
I thought she was doing it in a bikini...topless...1.1M views for a chick making soup???  WTF!!!!  What did I miss????
NOBODY CARES
i love ur energy here and vids 😼❤️
this is kinda like a video version of her podcast        love it
i dated a girl who looks just like this girl before. hmmm weird
This video is comforting.
the only bitch i’ll sit through 2 min ads for
Hearing you say bouillon like boy-on was killing me. It’s pronounced “Bool-yawn”. Soup looks good tho, I may have to try making this myself.
I would actually like to know why cheese doesnt hurt your stomach 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️
There's a channel that posts fragments of Emma's podcasts with bunch of footage from her videos. It's exactly like this. Love it.
Tysm for sharing the recipe in the description 💗
Product placement MIELE
guys i think she was very concerned about the peas not beinj cooked.
Way too much spammers in this comment section
When she said $17, I also saw she was 17 on trending and it freaked me out for a sec
I literally cant describe how much peace these videos give me lately
Emma is the new Jenna Marbles
are you going for the How To With John Wilson style?
you made a delicious 17 dollar soup and you are currently 17 on trending <3
this is my new favorite video on all of youtube. what the heck!
Wack some corned beef in there and there ya have it,, corned beef hash w/ potatoes,, peas, and whatever else u want
Isn't she underage to drink
I thought it said you caught me dropping the soap
As a chef! Wow Emma good job on the soup! For someone who didn’t follow a recipe it looked amazing, i bet it tasted so good!🔥🙌🏻…and yes if you wanted your soup greener next time blanch (boil in water w/ some salt) the basil and blend w/ the stock (no need of the bouillon)😉
stay hungry!!
Emma makes her podcast into her YouTube videos now
looks amazing love it emma.
I’m really looking forward to Emma’s voiceover of cooking mama
I’m allergic to onion & garlic 🥲
I really like this video emma
I’m super proud of you, I would definitely eat this but peas taste horrible to me… but it looks so GOODDDD
Lol I just learned how to make eggs properly as well and I am 41 years old lol
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH
glad you decided to eat cheese again. not everythings unhealthy for you like they are purported to be.
damn i wanted to hear that science fact abt cheese vs milk
you WHAT after cutting onions?????
now breaking me being a silent subscriber for over a year to say that this video made me so happy !!
Love soup season! 😋 🍲
Emma, you bring me joy. I hope you start feeling better! And I will DEFINITELY be trying this soup. Thank you for taking us along on your journey.
Damn cant dislike her videos anymore....
Whys this trending?!
Sounds like you are lactose intolerant, that's why you have problems with milk, but not with cheese. The cheese making process basically destroys any lactose.
I see A LOT of growth in this video honestly
This is a whole vid concept 👌🏼
I love those<3
Your shallot looks OK from here. A bit of black mold is really common on older onions, but mostly harmless if you discard the outer peel as you did.
Please make french onion soup
Emma’s cookbook coming 2022 lol 🤪🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
She said burnt and undercooked meals and I felt that cause me too
wait i want to know the science behind cheese bar milk lmao
I know she’ll have her own restaurant. i just know it.
How many of us love Cute and Funny Cat compilations?😻
I.love.this.
This soup sounds delicious!
SHES BACK YAYYYY
I wouldnt feed this soup to my dog
This is the dislike count
please try this with a chicken gnocchi soup, substitute the chicken and gnocchi for potato’s and peas
emma i think its time for you to move to europe. and if its not going to be europe, at least do new york. you're just too cultured at this point to stay in the US
it looks so yummy
Welcome back 😭❤🤝
Yes
I was SO CONFUSED when she started talking about the "boyon". Took me about a minute to figure out she meant bouillon
this was very entertaining thank you
i really miss u
Wondering why this video blew up, I’m a fan but why this one 😂
Wow. Really love the cinematic approach to this video <3
free therapy.
I was like hmmmmmm what's on the trending tab and I saw this and was like hmmmmmm why not so I spent 12 mins of my time watching this and I loved it
i loved this
hey you! this is just to tell you that you are beautiful, wonderful and lovable! you deserve every bit of happiness that comes your way and more. your kindness speaks volumes of your pure heart. take good care of yourself for people like you are precious ✨ Emma is my inspiration I hope she posts often without giving up

This is drivel. 💯
Low heat is a game changer!
Thank you this was lovely for the soul 🤍
Why I can literally smell the soup wtf
Where you thinking of split pea soup?
gorgeous gorgeous girls love soup
I would like this in my mouth right now
If you want it greener next time you should totally put some of the peas in the broth next time when you blend it hehe
God loves u
i never thought a video about soup could be so inspiring and dramatic.
Emma have you gotten your vitamins checked lately? You should. I see signs of iron/vit D deficiency the same way i saw it in myself.
How the hell are people actually entertained by this mediocre video.
Please show me more recipes that you enjoy with the prices that you would pay and I will open up a restaurant called Emma’s Eatery
Love it! Can’t wait for the next video! 💕
K well now I need this soup
This video gives school presentation vibes
One of my favourite EC videos 📹
The 17$ took me out
trying all 4 directions for the blender lid before getting it right was a mood
I‘m proud of you 🙌🏽
your creativity is insane
Hey, I wanted to ask you what videocamera you are using in 10:04🥰
I've got the same issue, my stomach hurts when i drink milk, but doesnt when i eat parmesan. And its because of amount of lactose in these products. SO enjoy your cheese Emma ;DD
this video shouldn't have been as hilarious as it was. Her editing and dry humor is unmatched!
the silence kills me
Good soup
Emma, honestly I do care about the research of the cheese situation ())))
ive grown up with emma, you’re a year older than me. and i’ve moved out and i got my own apartment and aspirations in the fashion industry. anyways emma’s has taught me so many things just through her life in videos and now SHES FULLY TEACHING ME HOW TO COOK. IM GONNA GO COOK AN EGG WELL NOW.
if this soup had a protein, possibly chicken and was served with like a nice bread. i would pay 25$ for this soup.
Trying to give some feedback in a different language, this is hard! No complaints just a point of wiev from my perspective. I enjoy you trying new concepts in your video making but this one with audio added lost your personality, that I love so much!  Keep exploring, keep on finding your way! Happy to see you post videos ❣️
i saw emma chamberlain making pea and potato soup. so i made pea and potato soup.
i want to make this soo bad but i don’t not have the counter space, it would possibly take days. i live in a tiny apartment in toronto if yk yk
Guess what. I caught you making soup
Guys get this at a bunch of likes so Toutie can see this
hi bestie, some advice about cooking from a teenager that goes to “alberghiero” and we learn how to cook, be a waiters/waitress or receptionists. the potatoes must be washed before being cut to remove the dirt, then peel them with a potato peeler. and then cut them. I also advice you to watch some videos of how to use the knife correctly. buy you are doing GREAT! keep goino and be really proud of you. cooking is a form of ART.
i f*** love you Emma
i want to try the soup
i love how her channel is slowing turning to a cooking channel<3
you should start sharing recipes
We love soup season ❤️
6:43 not me thinking I was going deaf
I love how everyone is commenting their soup cooking advice :)
So proud of you
the spiritual song at the end of the video
Iam so prod of you!
Have anybody ever noticed how much like timothee chalamet she looks?
this was a masterpiece. from start to end.
I just LOVE how she LOVES life through all her difficult phasess. 💖
watch emma create her own vegan restaurant in NY in like 5 years
Someone in the comments said they can see you baking cookies for all of us and I’m thinking  Omg, Emma you should totally do a baking video! Would be fun to watch!!❤️❤️🥰
Emma is slowly turning into a cooking channel
good soup
I love how its a bowl of soup but its so intense
this is so therapeutic, emma.
I was kinda annoyed. Lol. But I watched the whole thing anyway only because it's Emma❤🤣
How did you manage to make a video about soup entertaining?
Can I just say you inspired me to start cooking and learning from my mom. I love to put on your videos or podcast and just cook. It calms me down and I get to have a good meal after so thanks Emma ❤️ you
If you hate the onion and garlic smell on your hands, rub something stainless steel between them like your washing your hands. Takes it right out!
u feed my soul in a way i cant describe emma
motivational video ?
Being from Louisiana hearing her say “boy-yawn” 😅
i missed u :(
thank you Emma!!
Why is this person famous?
Omg I've been looking for a soup like this for so Emma! I kept looking up split pea soup but it just wasn't exactly what I wanted, but I saw ur Instagram photo of the soup and I was like THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR! Thank you emma!
I MISS U SM EMMAAA
I hate peas with every fiber in my body. but I definitely watched this whole video and am now re thinking my likes and dis likes
The best
I felt like the tittle should’ve been just “The Soup”
Video is so coool u feel how relaxing and inspiring cooking is, I feel the same
good soup
“Good soup”
That’s a lot of peas lol
This is like a free therapy session
she’s gonna cut the tips of her fingers off if she doesn’t learn basic knife skills soon.
Imagine 2 years from now emma has her own cooking show on Netflix just like Selena!!! I’d watch
i’ve miss u 😢
Omg I'm so happy to watch a video of you !
What I'm seeing is that Emma is ready to adopt me as her grandchild :)
emma this made me cry ??? it made me so happy to see you succeeding‼️‼️‼️‼️ being 20 is hard (i say this as i am also 20) 110% will be trying out your soup
Queen
Why is this relaxing lol
Watching you with a knife gives me anxiety
"Boy-on" instead of bouillon I'm DYING 🤣
parmesan isn’t veggie bestie, i only found this out the other day and it was emotional 🤪
We just watched Emma make soup and was entertained by it
I would use the water any veggies are boiled in as the nutrients come out as you boil them, especially green veggies
That basil broth reminded me of a Peruvian dish we have, it has a lot more things in the soup but its a basil and spinach based broth; its called Peruvian minestrone if you’re interested:)  *i sub the meat for soy chunks or any other meat substitute
I’ve been a silent watcher all year… but just wanted finally to say that you actually inspired me to get out of my comfort zone with cooking… and it’s truly life changing. I didn’t think that I would be able to make half decent looking summer rolls until I saw you doing it first~ Thank you
I thought it said "soap", so the whole time I was waiting for her to start making soap 🙃
Chamberlain Soup is the new Campbell
i haven’t watched a vid from you in almost two years and i’m absolutely astounded at how mature and confident you sounded through this whole video. i’m so proud of you
You fell off
EMMA my tumblr cup arrived and i absolutely love it. I've used it every day since!! AND I LOVE YOU
Emma, continue to share your knowledge! Even if you think we don’t care, you can inspire someone from your own research and knowledge
actually it is a very typical food in bulgarian cuisine  it is called 'grah yahniya' or "грах яхния" (in cyrilic)
Emma needs to make a restaurant rn
Emma ur only hope is to create a cookbook it will prob help u better
i love the way u live your life

Didn't even realize it's been 3 weeks...
Hard not to love to cook when you're kitchen is freaking gorgeous.
Yummm I'm proud of you 👏 I myself love cooking too and it definitely a hobbie I enjoy
wow.. i actually like this content
WE MISSED YOU EMMA! thank you for making a video about soup!
It’s important to remember that if you eat food when you don’t want to it is also wasted you never need to force yourself to eat something so it is not wasted!
i missed you so much oh my god
Parmesan cheese doesn't make you sick because it's naturally lactose free
i love it
OK listen everybody, Emma made me love HUMMUS, Emma made me love peanut butter, Emma made me love coffee and this soup will be a success cuz imma try this and if its a success, which we all know it is, I will buy EMMA CHAMBERLAIN coffee to my friends :))

'You love onion and garlic' except everyone with IBS
love u so much
10:15 idk why the song is scary lol.
I LOVE EMMA❤
And also every gemini i met was very big on not wasting things
I MISSED YOU
it's called allu matar ki rassedar sabzi in india
cheese probably doesn't hurt your tummy  because it doesn't have much lactose in it!

I always find that geminis love to cook or bake or take care of plants cause it always keeps them busy
I bet if you pureed all of it including the potatoes and peas it would be immaculate
I Love Your Cooking ❤️
Missed you emma, yesterday i was begging u would upload a new video
Wow, this video is a piece of art. ✨
Bru when did this bitch get a degree in psychology cuz I was so engaged in the video the whole time lmao luv her
When I was learning how to cook I had to eat a lot of burnt/ over salted/ horribly under seasoned  foods it happens!
did I just watch a 12-minute video of Emma making soup? yes, I did. Would I do it again? absolutely.
All the desi’s know it’s aalu mattar
this is simply a piece of art. i love how emma had dark academia glow up
that veggie bouillon is delicious, i use it in all of my soups!
I don't normally comment under YouTube videos but I thought this one deserves an exception: this video was so wholesome and as someone who just recently moved abroad to live alone for the very first time I too now have this newfound love for food and cooking. It's been a rocky road and making mistakes is easy and demoralising but improving is so satisfying and the excitement mentioned in the video is very much so felt by me too. I found this video so lovely, relaxing, calming and warm. Idk how to describe it. It truly calmed me down and put a genuine smile on my face. This was a very beautiful little snippet of what adulting has felt like for me and I loved it. I really did.
Emma I don’t know if I like the voiceover
SHES BACKKK!!!!
the fact that she had to try all 4 possible ways to put on the blender cover before getting it right is the most relatable thing ever
this is my favourite video of yours
Which blender was that?
The sexiest woman on You-Tube ,,, and she can cook ,,,
It's is a indian dish and it is very 😋😋😋 tasty
yasssssssssssssssssssssssssnat lasttttttttt
No emma if you don’t want to make anymore youtube videos don’t. Its as simple as that but please don’t show us some boring video like this It just looks so forced
strong how to by john wilson vibe in this
“Little tiny circle… green circles” shouldn’t have me in tears the way it does right now lmao 😂
just realized ur going to become the next martha stewart
felt like i was listening to ur podcast i love ;)
You should definitely buy a pepper grinder, it's so much nicer than pre-ground. Also, pepper in the oil with the onion releases so much flavour!! Never straight into the liquid.
the best green peas are fresh ones straight from the garden, i grow them every summer
baru umm udah abis aja :-\
if you want your knives to last for longer, try using the blunt side of the knife when scraping into a pot! you’re doing fabulous!
Hard cheese like Parmesan doesn’t bother you because the bacteria has predigested the disaccharide lactose, where as fresh milk still has the disaccharide. More than likely from consuming a vegetarian diet high in anti nutrients and low in animal fats you have a degree of “leaky gut” and the disaccharides are crossing your intestinal barrier undigested. In a hard cheese the bacteria has already predigested the lactose making it easier on your stomach. ♥️♥️
Fun fact: my nickname from my grandparents is “pea soup” because of how much I loved pea soup as a kid 😂
I'm sorry but when are we going to stop hyping people up for doing the most basic things. It's a soup. You don't need a recipe. You put everything in a pot and boil it. You can literally put anything in there. People in the comments hyping it up like it's a gourmet recipe. Congrats you are learning something new but damn.
Make sure the Parmesan is vegetarian!
I made the soup today!!! 🥳🍲 I adapted it slightly, by moving it over to a crockpot—but it was a 10/10. The Parmesan is the MVP for sure! Hurray for cheese.
Emma+Chef on HBO. We need it, pls.
this is exciting to me, you’re evolving and this is a MASTERpiece. film & cooking with a mind like yours is top tier, i hope you keep doing these because this is my favorite video you’ve ever put out emma🥺💓
Emma you better make a cooking book someday!!
the soup kinda reminds me of a filipino dish called a “mung beans soup”.
seeing u say ur proud of urself & that cooking actually makes u happy now, is just so beautiful omg. i've watched u for awhile but seeing u rlly growing & getting happier is so so nice
ummm.....a lil overboard with the peas dont u think?
I’ve been saying ily to Emma since about 2017. I can’t even keep a friend for that long. So, ily Emma.
omg I was eating my green peas when I opened the video. you can't make this shit up 🤯
Hi emma! This is great! Seeing how much you have been into cooking, I would recommend you to try Indian Food and cuisine!!!! your mind will be blown by sheer authenticity, taste, variety and richness of it! Try all cuisines, both North Indian (Mughlai/Punjabi), South Indian as well Rajasthani and Maharashtrian Food!!!!!! <3 <3
I missed you emma!
Missed your vibe in my life bestie, keep them coming <3
Ummmm does her toaster have a screen??????????????
really felt happy when she said " i'm proud of myself "
*👌🏼good soup*
from how you described your soup it fairly reminds me of our traditional dish on Christmas day for lunch. In addition, we mix the peas and potatoes too and as a topping, we add air-fried toast chopped into tiny pieces. If it really is what I believe it is then I have to admit it is for real fucking delicious!!
so many peas
I CARE ABOUT THE CHEESE SCIENCE. i have ibs & im the same way. pls enlighten me
this feels like a vid podcast lmao- that's just a vid
its a dutch soup
erwtensoep
i LOVE HER SM
the music towards the end was HAUNTING.
That soup looks Amazing, except for the Peas 😝😂
TOOOOOOOOO MANY PEAS 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢. peas CAN be good but eating a whole bowl of it absolutely not
I love this Emma
I think I could never eat Emma food because she licks every utensil possible
so glad ur back :)
Politely requesting that you name this recipe Seventeen Dollar Soup
If you cut the butts off the shallots it’ll be easier to peel and you don’t have to cut it like a monster
yo what is your rising and moon sign cause same!!!!!!!
where have u been
DAMN THAT LOOKS LIKE A TASTY SOUP OF THE DAY!
We love you little sis
Emma!!! There’s a Greek meal called “Pizelia” aka Peas-Arakas Latheros. It’s just like how you are trying to imagine!! This looks amazing btw. Just for help next time xxx it has meat but defs taste perfectly fine without it. Keep up the good work Chef Chamberlain 🤍
COOKING ADVICE! 🥬🥦🍵!!!!!   Before adding the peas and potatoes, put in a separate bowl (like when she was serving it) some peas and potatoes apart and with a hand blender, get into that broth with peas and potatoes and you will have the PERFECT green and thick soup.   May I add a tip, after boiling the potatoes, you can roast some of them in a pan with oil and pepper to make them crisp. So you can add them as a “garnish” to the finish place
Tbh i dont mind watching this, it has such a wholesome vibe to it, im willing to see how this goes on
im proud
All that reading and none of them said peel the potatoes! Potato skin on a soup....eeeeee nope that ain't it.
Good soup
That "bouillon" pronunciation lol
So this new kind of vlog is more of a podcast type huh. No more interactions or talkin tho?👀💔
Now, let's see Emma attempt her own original Ramen without the packets!  THEN, EAT THE ENTIRE SERVING ON HER FIRST TIME!
i mf love onion and garlic, sometimes i have an urge to just bite directly into garlic and onions like an apple....
ily queen ojala pudiera sentarme a comer contigo
you are amazing!! keep going ❤️❤️❤️
if you rub your hands on stainless steel, it helps gets rid of the onion/garlic smell on your hands. They even make little stainless steel bars for it shaped like bars of soap!!
Good soup
I love all the “normal”  comforting content. I have so much love for you Emma Chamberlain you’re truly a gem.
All I gotta say is... Moms... teach your sons to cook. Holy shit.
this is art
never have i ever been so interested in the making of soup
yess be proud of yourself!
we missed you
I think I’m gonna try this, I’ll let ya know!
Shit was boring but I love her so I watch & she's all I'm here for...💚
this was a really beautiful video <3 well done Emma :) x
dang... i clickbaited my self.... thought it said * soAP*
Hear me out Emma. Peel the potatoes. Keeping the skin on is fine for frying, roasting and baking but not necessarily soups because it gives it an earthy flavour. Make more broth liquid this time and put the potatoes in the broth so it can absorb the flavour and the starch can thicken the broth. Take out potatoes 3/4 of the way done and put broth in blender. Add a couple of potatoes (and peas if you want) in the blender with the broth and then blend. This will give the broth more body. Add broth back into pot, add your almost done potatoes that you took out earlier, and add your peas and cook until peas and potatoes are done.
I’ve been in a weird soup kick the last month. Drizzling balsamic glaze & cream on top— game changer🤌🏻
*doesn’t hear from Emma for 3 weeks* “Good soup”
What is boyon?
Imagine Emma becoming a cooking creator
miss u so much
11.1M subbies that's super cute
everyone just found some sort of comfort while watching this soup recipe video that it’s #12 on trending
I have really come to love these quiet, thoughtful moments that you're giving us, Emma. Reminders that it is okay to take time for simple acts of self care, stillness, and small happinesses.
$17
Babe I just wanna tell you that I love you . Wish nothin but happiness fr you . Xo
6:39 that was one big LOUD silence
Bora Bora vlog 🤩
It's like listening to emma's cooking podcasts 😘😘😘😘😘
The armpit scratching part got me so bad I cried 😭😂
Such a weird watch but you might be onto something. Quite entertaining tbh.   Wait a couple of years and your stomaches gonna hurt even from cheese
hi emma my bdays coming up, if u liked my comment i’d cry 😭😭 also ily lova
ure video is literally therapy <3
who would blend a soup? whaaa-  (glad I’m Asian)
I love the thumbnail so much
Μόλις εφτιαξε αρακά η μου φαινεται
i meannnnnnnnn are u back causeeee i missed you sooooooo yea. 🤞🏽☺️  Ps I’m shocked to see u have black slides now and not your OG white ones lol. I have the black ones too and they are literally peeling on the sole.
You could make a dutch green pea soup
If you do want to get rid of the garlic and onion smell on your fingers, rub them along the metal part of the kitchen faucet. Repeat until it's gone. Happy cooking!
Wanda had a Vision too...
Open a cafe, SELL YOUR COFFEE AND SOUP
Girl You need a immersion blender
guess i’m into cookin now
remind me of bubur kacang io
the editing...sooooooo gooood. best video. I was being guided brilliantly through an extremely tedious activity. so satifying
Dont you have mandatory cooking class in school? Just curious why so many Americans does not know have to cook or bake. Im just basing it on what I have seen in youtube of course haha
Bro I love Emma bro shes my happy place.
ilysm
Well now i wanna make soup
Put potatoes in boiling water then wait till it’s soft when you prick it with fork!
Girl please make a French onion soup next. It’s made with a beef broth but you could use a veg broth instead, it has bread in it and then a layer of cheese on top that’s baked . So good!
You’re so entertaining without trying. We love an authentic queen
Good soup!
My filipino a** is thinking this might be “monggos” or Bean Soup (idk if this is the correct english translation) but basically what emma did was envisioning a beans soup which is “monggo” in our language and the process on how she did it was almost the same totally except we dont mixx potatoes with monggo. (Monggos is btw my faveeee viand in the world)
I missed hearing her talk for the entire video <3 it makes me forget about my life for a bit and I love that
Looks bomb! Hear me out next time add carrots.
Emma is back !!🤩
WAIT Emma when you’re blending soup like that make sure to let out steam because pressure builds and it could go boom
I really like how this is a podcast and a video at the same time. 10/10 concept
i miss u
Fuck yes. Love seeing young people cook! If u chop the top off of ur garlic clove and then smash it with the side of the knife it makes it so much easier to dice! Xo keep up the great work. We’re all so proud :’)
this feels like a documentary of some sort
Why did the "learning that cooking things low and slow/being patient" part make me this emotional- I'm a mess.
emma needs a dutch oven
EMMA LIVING HER LIFE, WE LOVE THAT
the thumbnail looks like this picture of Robert Pattinson
i absolutely love the style of videos you do but sometimes i do be missing forehead kissses😞
It’s so weird cooking shows normally stress me tf out. But you ACTUALLY make me watch to try to cook…let’s all learn the Emma way!!🍲👩‍🍳⏲
emma using a strainer to strain her soup and then proceeding to dump the strained bits into the soup is very relatable
Don't like this kind of videos
I still haven’t figured out how to cook a portion of one
In Hauser we believe.
so luca actually introduced a lot of people to trennette al pesto which is a pasta dish with pesto, potato, and green beans. so kind of similar to your idea
When u don’t want your hands smelling garlic wash them with no soup just water !!!
miss u
Hmmmmm……
FINALLY SOMEONE ELSE WHO APPRECIATES ONION AND GARLIC SMELL
I WOULD EAT THIS PAUSE IT LOOKS SO GOOD EMMA???
honestly, i am proud of you EMMA !!!!!
Let's empower women to cook, oh wait? Aren't we supposed to do the contrary....uh oh, never mind!
okay so this girl can talk to me about anything and apparently I will listen
👌good soup
Emma did great with this recipe
emma at this point, just start a cooking show
When peeling garlic …. Push down on the garlic with the palm of your hand OR with the wide part of a knife. The garlic shell will crack and it makes peeling so much easier!
Don't worry, you can always just put the potatoes and or peas in and just simmer for like 5 to 10 extra minutes if they're under cooked (you can also prick them to check). Though, peas cook pretty quickly lol Btw, there's a pea and basil soup recipe which is super vibrant green.  If you're wanting to know how they make it green, you could probably check a few recipes out and find out what the step is to incorporate into your own recipe.
I might try this recipe
BITCHHHHH, like gurlll I forgot what you said after a minute ahahaha the way you randomly start your videos gives me life ana makes me the person I am today :) Hehe lmaoo bruh how fucking random
really good video
i love emma so much and i really enjoy watching her doing her daily activities but this is getting really repetitive and just watching her cook has become really boring. it's not like 'cooking with emma'. it's just 'cooking'. she's a multi-millionaire. i'd expect her to be doing some crazy luxurious stuff but she's showing us how she cooks soup. and i'm okay with that but not this being every second video. emma was way more fun before she became rich. now she's dull.
Next time plz put a dish towel over the blender and hold it when you blend hot liquids! The hot items can release more steam and expand when getting blended and your blender could shoot the lid off 🥺
We need an emma cookbook
proud of you too emma
love this new version of cooking with emma<333
Miss u mama
the fact that I’ve just watched a twelve minutes and eleven seconds video long about emma narrating her soup prove that emma is one of the purest soul on earth
I hope you’re washing your produce. That could be causing stomach aches if you don’t wash them good.
I glad you make this video it is was real and raw cooking video I ever watch lol
add more Basil for color!
I love this cooking journey you’re on. Cooking is very therapeutic, but it’s also very inspiring too. And it’s definitely something to be proud of, you made that shit, girl! I was so scared when I heard basil in a soup… but I’m fr going to try this in the colder months (I’m Aussie :))   welcome back to the hole of existence where nothing and everything is happening all the time all at once and no one’s cares lmao!  It’s great to see ur face again 🥺 xx
I’m so proud 💕👏🏻
watching Emma’s vids on the bus ride to school is so calming
I love u so much Emma❤️❤️❤️
I NEED MORE OF THESE VIDEOS
god I’ve missed u
Same for the onion/garlic smell it made me stop cooking them, but now I wear gloves when I cut and touch them, its been great!
Very art housr
miss you emma been thinking of you for 2 weeks now and i hope you are doing better
good soup.
I really like Emma. She’s really one of the only influencers I can watch. She’s so human and mature.
ok hear me out Emma’s videos kind of have coming of age films vibes, anyone?
That’s it girl, make yourself some yummy soup! Cook your potatoes in the soup with other vegetables. It’s not rocket science, believe me!  I love a good soup! And yes I love onion and garlic and it’s good for your immune system!
wish if u filmed at the bora bora
watching emma cook without getting bored>>>
amazing!!'
Love your uploads! Be safe out there everyone ❤️💛🙏🏾🙏🏾
Im so hungryyyy 😭😭😭
Its "Aloo Matar" we cook in India
Very x10
First time in ages and it's this rubbish.
GIRL I care about a science behind milk and cheese, because I have the same issue and Idk why
Green pea soup is actually a common dutch soup! U can put in any vegetable u like, most used are carrots, potatoes, cellery etc. When the pea’s have cooked u mash them as much as u like, like a Creamy soup. Also meat like turkey bacon, chicken or veggie chicken is also Really good with it!
i'm french and it's so enjoyable to understand all emma say ! and she calms me a lot, i love watch her videos
this is emma's podcast in video form
Emma you are a cook! This is what cooks do. They experiment. Congratulations! And please please look into Lactaid. It will allow you to eat most dairy without having stomach issues.
Basil is an Italian spice…  Peas and potatoes is like English:Irish?   Cheese and salt would go better. Maybe some rosemary.
Im sorry but the amount of peas in that soup should be illegal
It’s like listening to her podcast but, I don’t have to paint the picture in my head. Amazing
missed u
this is becoming a cooking channel and im totally here for it
so i kinda thought of something...  future emma could become a featured star on a cooking show and then after more experience create a cookbook of all her spontaneous food creations! idk maybe it's just me...
"boy yon".......
Recently I also have been becoming interested in cooking!  I hope you tell us  your other recipes...:) Sorry for my bad English
song? 10:14
Been waiting for your vlog
I MISS UU!
Literally a door 🚪
Very unique soup and also a very unique and desirable gluteus maximus thank you
I really don't wanna be "that person" but bouillon is pronounced "buion" and it drives me a lil crazy😂
That's monggo tho HAHAHHA
i absolutely HATE soup, but for u, i just might try this one
I don't know why but this video literally made my eyes tear up. I'm going tru a depressive episode and living by yourself can make cooking seem like a whole ordeal. For me it feels impossible. But seeing Emma cooking and sharing her inspirational and joy, made me feel so happy and comforted. Inspired as well! I think I'm going to cook something for myself today, as an act of self love :) hope everyone has a good day today, and thank u Emma for making my day so much better 🥰
iv missed u
I missed you and needed it, thank you
Emma #20 on trending with a pea soup recipe is such a vibe lol
eat meat
I made soup today too
Ik it sounds weird but this actully gave ne motivation to make myself food
I also rate my meals on how much I would pay for it at a restaurant, gonna start posting some of them on my channel. This inspired me
i’ve missed your videos sm, these last few weeks have been tough. love you
Love youuuu!!😙
This is David Lynch good. Should've watch this high
I’m so fucking proud of you
Your videos makes me feel so comfortable and understood that makes me wanna cry, even tho im a coldass bitch with no heart, u are one of the only persons that can make me feel like this, im happy u are back i missed u 🤍
What is the flat part on the top of the oven for? British question….
Try gordon ramsay of 10 minutes videos.
I made canned lentil soup today
Soo good!! Wish I could try it ! Hahah
10:45 Where did the music come from? Is she also creating the music ? pleaaaase
In India, there's a curry with potatoes and peas.
You should watch the recipe for “erwtensoep” maybe it’s what you wanted.
i remember when Emma said : I CANT COOK and now… we r so proud
good soup
I took a chance and hit the explore button on YouTube and left my comfort zone of shit I regularly watch and I've got to say I'm pleasantly surprised.
I'd eat Emma's soup!
Thanks for the soup tutorial mom🥺love u!! <3
When's the Binging with Babish collab?!
Your soup looks great, I love making soup, it is my ultimate comfort food and I would have it every day if I could.
i just love this
i really hope she comes out with a cookbook one day i'd literally be so proud of her
You can make your own veggie stock i 10/10 recommend
<3 <3 <3 <3
This gave me a ratatouille cinematic docu. Video that was both calming and beautifully narrated and was aesthetic asf and I love Emma for keeping my adhd brain entertained about soup for 12 minutes
Peasoup with basil is very common in germany, although the peas are blended usually :)
i missed you 💕
lol she says she hates wasting food but she eats half of a strawberry and put it in the trash
this made me feel like we were listening to the podcast but with a visual
emma i care in the science of cheese not hurting ur stomach 🥺
Hey Emma I’ve also been putting cheese on my meals 😃 wow
Pea soup is very popular in finland, sweden and like norway! We usually eat it with a finnish mustard (its a lot better than the usa one!!)
CANNNNN ANYONE SUGGEST ME SOMEONE THAT MAKE VLOG LIKE HERR
This video makes me so happy to see Emma find something that really brings her joy 😊. That’s what life is about. Experimenting and being creative. Never stop learning in life. Well done Emma your soup looks amazing and delicious. Look forward to seeing more cooking videos 😊
Like the origional feel of the video. Very artsy of you.  Enjoyed.
Emma! Maybe you could try to blend some of the peas with the broth next time! Maybe add in some color and texture?
Yes, I love onion and garlic Emma ❤️
we evolved from cooking with emma to emma makes her own soup recipe and nails it damn
Been waiting 3 weeks for a new video and I'm not disappointed at all, so glad Emma is home and back to her comfy self cooking and just doing what she does best being herself, I absolutely love it❤❤❤
Emma - crush the garlic clove with the side of your knife. Skin comes right off. You don't have to peel.
im gonna makie it today. I NEED THIS SOUP
Praise the soup
Great video.
I would pay $18 if you made it ❤️
Emma I know trying to diagnose people can be quite dangerous. I love you and like most people would say I relate to you a lot. I was wondering if you ever considered ADD (ADHD). I was diagnosed myself recently but at first it was just considered anxiety. I love you and I find your videos so comforting, thank youu !
Brilliant I like the way you fix your soup 🍲, you will make a lot of other Cooks jealous
Peaceful cooking show ever! ❤️
Loved this. Cooking content from Emma is so fun
we missed u 🥺
I missed you
i love it, i love you and i just love this
I- I am a garlic girl 😳
Excellent work chef! Pro tip…blend some peas with the soup base to get your green colour. Leave some peas behind with the potato for added chunk and texture. Hard cheeses (like Parmesan) tend to have low lactose so can be better tolerated in peeps with lactose intolerance.
this was so boring to me
I'm proud of you
Umm I thought she left youtube but I just checked her uploads & it looks like she never left! Only reason I'm now noticing is bc its trending so I'm not the only one that just realized that she's back...well back from never leaving! 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤣
emma evolved so so much throughout the years. i felt like im growing up with you. probably won’t see this but i love you and im proud of you. <3
love you emma gonna try to make the soup looked good fr
your vlogs and style of editing are top tier emma, it creates an almost cathartic experience. the sheer stillness of mind omg it s mesmerizing i can t even-😭😭😭
Not into this content at all 🥱
i love how she rated the soup and how much she would pay for it lmaoooo🤣
Yes I've made it too, it's so delicious 😋
Thats a lot of peas in the soup.
J.H.A Cw
Nice
good soup
Hey my Gemini Queen 😙...its so much better & fun to cook and eat at home...😋
https://youtu.be/SzFNWz4qsos
good soup
Its called sopa. Mexican dish without noodle and add pea
It made me think of monggo
Plsss bring back the old vlog format
Only for Emma will I watch a 12 minute video about soup… I don’t even like soup
we love seeing the queen trending
tip for the smell of the hands!!! 🙌🏻 I bought on amazon: Stainless Steel Soap, Odor Remover Bar....a game changer 💫 Have a lovely Xmas holidays, greetings from Paris 💞
It’s like pea cereal
The fact that I just sat down with my chips and salsa and opened YouTube to a new Emma video >>>
OMG, 6:33 is a total knut buster!  I love you Emma for how funny and insightful you are.
Emma should wash her hands in lemon mixed in water to avoid smell from garlic and onions!! Hack for anyone really
Love this for you! ❤️
i love this so much. Congratulations on making your soup, and your lovely journal of the account. It really seasoned my day... like lil chopped chives :)
That be gangster part blended 🤤
If you want to get rid of the garlic smell off your fingers just rub some metal like the sink tap or something....idk what it is but it will stoo smelling instantly!
You are so cute
This video is so sad and shows how f’ed up this society is nowadays. I’m not judging Emma cause she is not guilty of what happened to her. But does she have a family, how did any food end up on her table until she got to her 20’s. Did she ever see her mom or dad making any food whatsoever? Like, wtf, researching the internet for 1 hour for how to boil pees and potatoes? What about you try. Boiling shit and taste on the way to see what happens? And those nails, who told her it was a good idea?  And then how do you end up with all that amazing cooking gear if you can’t boil a freaking potato? This video for me was a huge WTF? It’s like a people and a world I didn’t even know existed…
We know papa Joshua is proud of you
these are great - luv ya emma!
Emma: Teaching today's women the freedom of cooking, personal style, solitude, internalization and reflection.
Try to blend it all together next time, you will create nice and creamy puree with this..
We have this soup in Turkey!
im so happy you're satisfied Emma. I was worried that you haven't been posting lately <3 love u sis
Are you working your way to owning a restaurant in 5 years that also features your coffee?
emma girl i missed you 🥺
Ure a good chef
i care about the research you did on why cheese doesn’t hurt your stomach bby🥺✨♡︎♡︎ spillllll it outttttt
it might sound weird but i think you have beautiful hands
i want her old videos back
This is when u know youre getting good at cooking when u imagine food that goes well together in your head and have a clear vision of what it is then its so much easier to cook
I think you might need a small vegetable knife.
the way emma was slicing those potatoes made me Nervous
Soop
In 10 years Emma’s gonna be famous for being a chef! That creativity is so cool. Keep on goin!

I do love onion and garlic
“sometimes i itch my armpit and cut a shallot within the same hour and when i smell my hand later IDK IDK if the rancid smell came from me itching my armpit or from the shallot um… *silence* “ fucking love emma omfg
for next time, you should cook everything in one pot so that the broth has the flavours of the veg in your soup. but it does look very delish
if any of you enjoyed this and don’t listen to Anything Goes every week you’re missing out!
this was legitimately art
This made me so hungry , I’m so curious what that soup tasted like
emma i’m gonna need that perfect scrambled eggs recipe
I would like to see you and your face, not so much just your hands if that
i loved this video so much
emma :- i get it why the grammas are into this shit  meanwhile me:- maybe i am gramma
Oh hi. Didn‘t see you there. That‘s totally awkward random. 😂
Really missed you Emma, glad you're back
You don't even know that how much I fucking miss you
Read salt fat acid heat if you want to keep building your cooking intuition and feeling confident cooking without a recipe, it will change your life wow :)
a Revolution microwave???
the sifting ahshsjbakjbaskdj
I’m confused how soup is #9 trendjng
I’m going to be 100% honest….I wasn’t going to watch this video and I am SO BEYOND happy that I did. Soup looks bomb I can’t imagine how good it smelled or tasted, and it was hilarious lmao 🤣
Similar story, I’m allergic to the enzyme in milk but once it’s cooked out I’m fine with baked dairy products.
Good soup
Your videos always comfort me
you can def cook potatoes and peas together in the soup, so you dont need to clean more pots
Emma! Biggest cooking tip I can give you! Season at EVERY step as you go! Happy cooking! It really is the most therapeutic/fun thing to do tbh
Emma has entered her “cooking mama” era and I’m here for it      Referring to games if you’re too young to understand
good soup -dishu et shivi
😴
If you didn't read the description, you better should.
Tbh I'm here for the soup content 🍲
this feels like your podcast
I see a cookbook in the future and I’m here for it!
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
im really proud of you, Emma. Good job. *pat shoulders*
Emma we boil the potatoes and then peal of the outer dark layer. And then only we cut it and add to the soup.  Also the ash stuff in the union you should wash it off. Those are there cause those were under the dirt. Nothing to worry but wash ❤️
You've lost the spark in your voice....... hope you're okay girl. Just tell yourself one day at a time. Fuck the past look forward to the future rather than fear it. Can I tell you for real, I never watched your videos for so long and then I started to watch a few and then more and more and you would make me laugh out loud and that's hard to do LOL. You're too relatable and straight up about things and at your age for how strong you seem and how aware you are of when you're not doing well, is a sign of complete wisdom and I commend that girl ❤💜💛💚💙💖
It’s videos like these that remind me how much I feel like I’ve grown up with Emma. We are the same age and I’ve been watching her for years now and I feel the experiences and journeys she talks about coincide so closely with mine and I’m sure most 20 year olds
There is something wierdly deep and philosophical about this soup making video.
Emma chamberlain soup coming soon lol
i missed your videos,  they are the highlight of my day
Ok, Imma head to the grocery and make this soup tonight it looks soo good!!!
love you emma!!!
That soup better have crack at that price shi
I love your cooking videos !!!
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life677
love u fool
*tiktok enters my brain* GORGEOUS GORGEOUS GIRLS LOVE SOUP
the INTRO
I see Emma owning her own quaint cafe in the future selling pastries, breads, soups, grab n go wraps and only chamberlain coffe!!
why is stirring the shallots in the pot so satisfying to watch
That UMMM… pause moment while you looked through the cupboards moment was EVERYthing
good soup.   forreal though, why I just watched a whole soup recipe video is beyond me...Emma makes anything cool and calming!
Lactose intolerant Italian here ✋🏼 to explain. Parmigiano reggiano is lactose free due to the ageing that needs to be at least 12 months. In this process the good bacteria that is naturally in milk eats the lactose and breaks it down. Every long ageing cheese has very low lactose for this reason.
Hi love…
this reminds me of acomaf soup
i wanna try it ngl
emma’s next business adventure: a personalized recipe book
this is why ill never hit the explore button on Youtube ever again.  explore = a video by a girl that has 11million people watch her make money because people keep watching her. GREAT STUFF. I mean its an amazing job for her, but  HOW/WHY ANYONE finds any entertainment from this is upsetting. Is it sposed to be relatable? wholesome? life affirming?  Im not gonna watch anything i already tried to find a title that might be helpful, but that was a failure so i figured id just straight out ask, WHY is this something Youtube literally pushes at users?
Как получается так что все что готовит Эмма вкусно
can you make a cooking channel
watch this go viral on tiktok
Emma, how did you trick me into enjoying a cooking video? I remember your first appearance on David’s vlog and never imagined you would go down the creator centered video style. Thank you.
DUDE I make homemade soups alllll the time and I use the better than bouillon veggie paste in every single soup and it is sooo good. They also have a vegan "chicken" one! But I throw soups together all the time, and definitely research what spices compliment your ingredients. I even make mashed potatoes with the better than bouillon, earth balance, and some salt, pepper, garlic and it is soooooo good!
We stan a fashionable chef! Yasss queenette
It looks like our filipino dish munggo hahahahaha but its mung beans instead of peas
Specifically $17... Don't know why but that made my night.
WOW that's a LOT of PEAS
emma trying to compose a thought: i think i get it… like… i get it…. like i… i think it get it now
Emma there is these like metal bars that look like soap that you can rub your hands on and it gets rid of the smell on your hands!! I wanted to send you one but I don't think you have a p.o box right?
good soup 👌
Soooo what I’m hearing is you’re making a soup line next 🤩🤩
emma that was boring
Yum!😛
I MISSED U WTF
te amo
I miss youuuuu
The most wholesome content 😚 ily
Not me watching this video while eating a big ass meal that I made by myself
man lemme tell you, that is a whole lot of peas for a soup!
How sweet! $17
If cooking ain't rewarding then don't cook and don't eat.
Is Emma Chamberlain's channel turns cooking channel or something? 😆
Waste of life force.
My father is a cook and something he teached me is that it is waayyy easier to give a round object a clean edge. Like when you were cutting the potato: you had to hold it, so they wouldn‘t roll away. If you would cut it in half (lengthwise) you can cut it safely :)  And you can totally eat the end and the beginning of the potato
i am your fan
i like your`s videos
i love your food
i like your videos
WOOW JUST WOOOW .. I'm proud of you and I literally want to cry
i love youuu
I love the music!  🎶.  Great job chef!
just noticed 11.1 subscribers .. ✨angel numbers ✨
i love u but parmesan isn’t veggie
Gorrrrrrrrrrl get a stick blender!!!!!!!!
are green peas not normal in america?
emma you’re the best
So proud of you gurl
Emma is literally in her bon appetit recipe developer era and I’m here for it
If you want the soup base to be greener you could blend some of the peas into it. And then to wools look less like you were just eating a bowl of peas
Emma, watching this high was another experience. And that editing style hahah loved it
literally looks bad la;sdkjf;lakjf;lkaj;dlfklmaooo
omg i want emma to cook for me
@missremiashten put this girl on cooking with remi!!
I see her baking for the whole neighborhood honestly 😩❤️
Emma's content would be 100,000% better if she read the communist manifesto
We need two videos a week plz
I HATE soup so only Emma could get me to watch a 12 minute video of her making it
Top Anime Openings Summer 2019 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJMXuwIQojA&ab_channel=Kurowolf
I would blend the veggies too and top with 🧀🥓
we missed u girl
If you want to make it look green just add fresh cilantro when you’re blending it
Your pots are on the wrong burners, but good try.
I miss you! 🤎
I'm afraid of peas, it's a traumatic memory I don't wanna talk about it. However I'd love to see Emma's method for pickling her carrots.  🤔 I'd really like to get into doing that! So far she's got me into using nutritional yeast love the flavor it adds to food. She's also got me into the habit of roasting a variety of veggies. I love them I feel so much better after a big meal of veggies. Also I always cook my eggs on low and slow.
I think you got the cooking time of the potatoes and peas right.  One tip I would give is you don’t have to stir as much.  Just let the fire do it’s thing.
The "ummm ...anyway"🤣😭
your shallot was in good shape! loved the video!! your skills are looking great!!!!! so excited for you!
i remember when she made the reading books video and someone commented she's teaching us slow living and this truly shows it❤️
That's some interesting soup preparation techniques...
From PB&J to a chef Emma Soup!
i wanna watch emma make split pea soup and love it. like genuine soup recommendation (serve w garlic salt and tobasco). its the perfect vibrant green color
I’m not just high this surreal right
Its so peaceful here 😊💖
This was.. annoying?
4:37 literally , a life lesson
I AM TRYING THIS RECIPE RN
good soup
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates-🎈
✨happy to see youuuuu✨✨
literally aaloo matar ki sabzi
i miss the forehead kisses :(
Çorbanın bitişinde ahiret müziği gibi müzik koymuşun, kulaklıkla dinliyordum ödüm bokuma karıştı sabah sabah.
The finest of hobbies Emma, honestly. Ever considered a culinary class?
gorgeous gorgeous girls love soup
i found this video so peaceful and i love the way emma’s filming style has changed…🥣💚
I Loves U Emma, I Am Dod.
also loved this video, had me on the ropes the whole time
This video dead ass helped with calming my anxiety today. Thank you for these videos . They really highlight my day .
Totally trying this soup. Love u Emma. <3
emma i want to see you doing the ‘letting the person in front of me decide what i eat, challenge
this is a like a documentary and i love it
love and missed you <3
a cooking tidbit, when wanting to simmer herbs def low heat and let it beat, however, it your rating to sear something or cook it on the outside but not really on the inside you have to cook at high heat. When simmering herbs you can use butter!! it makes the flavour of them come out and gives them a nicer texture. Just some info from a wannabe cook :))))
Hi
IVE MISSED U
I've been away for some months.  Is it just me or... Her voice sounds like she finished puberty.  She sounds like a _woman_ woman now.
this video cured my sadness
That’s how I like my gf’s ratchet flat because there cooking is what we need that comes from the heart
This feels like a video she sends her therapist
6:29 EMMA im eatinggg 😩
Emma, it’s bouiLLLLLon
I want to see this as an animation short film. Because this monologue is so good!!!!
WE MISSED YOU <33
I MISS U
i can see myself in a dystopian world finding these videos and crying to them because i haven't seen another sentient being in weeks
Amazing.
this deserves an emmy
This dish is what we call in Greece arakas! You should also try it with rice as a side dish it’s delicious
she is the girl I die for 🥺
You are an icon, and that soup looked absolutely incredible. Much love to you, Emma!❤️
Make a cookbook for people our age who cant cook but want to get better, build a love for it, and care for ourselves
Love you Emma ❤️
I'm so proud of you Emma.
you are literally everyone's comfort youtuber, like i think i can speak for the collective that when we watch your videos there's this sense of safeness and calmness
$17
we are of similar age and it seems we share similar experiences and feelings around the same time. It’s comforting to know someone of your scale is living the same life, just in your own way. You’re descriptive speak and rawness helps me feel accepting of myself and life rather than judgmental. Thank you.
The way that I felt like this was a  podcast cooking episode
i super duper love your videos emma
this is giving me cooking with emma vibes but it’s just an elevated version 🤩
Lemon juice and rubbing your fingers with a metal spoon gets onion garlic smell off your hands
Only Emma could get me this invested in soup
Our best emma ❤️🥰
We need a Emma x Claire collab ASAP
I have missed you…. Please upload more ❤️
I would love to see Emma be an episode of Without A Recipe with the Try Guys. I think it would be soooo fun to watch!
A whole documentary on making soup from scratch n i loved it
My mom makes that soup all the time but we call it a stew 😮‍💨 yummy
More cooking videos pleeeeease!!!  😍
So happy for you emma
BOY-ON
emma ily
emm, i luv when u cook, ty
gross
dude I’m so happy for you like actually.  i wish i could just in-vision something that doesn’t exist and then make it and it be good.
You can get the onion and garlic smell off your hands by wetting them and rubbing them on stainless steel (a sink or faucet or they sell bars of stainless steel that is shaped like a bar of soap). There is a chemical reaction and it takes the smell off your hands completely.
I love the smell of onion and garlic on my fingers
MOM IS HOME
plz make a side cooking channel
Emma uploading gave me motivation to do my finals pre-work. Thank you Emma you have helped me in so many ways. I hope you know we all love you 💗
NOT ONE DISLIKE
Amazing video! God bless you all🙏🏽God is so good🙌🏽Jesus loves us all so much🙏🏽❤Turn to God He will guide you and give you strength🙏🏽Trust in Him
Why am i so normal man i gotta get it together.🤦🏾‍♂️
my mom always cooks the potatoes in the broth!
What happened to your regular vlogging?
i miss u
Tyler Durden says...
twins i also made soup today
i love peas !!!

I really enjoyed this soup video. idk it felt warm & genuine <3333 more soup videos pls!
i can’t believe how happy these make me. seriously whenever i see a notification my day just instantly gets better honestly.
I missed you 😭😭❤️
I require Emma to narrate all future cooking recipes please and thank you
Ooo, this looks phenomenal and yummy as f. I’m curious what the texture would be like if you blended half of the peas with the broth mixture. Maybe it would make it a bit thicker. Not sure tbh but I love that you have me riffing like this. It makes cooking way more fun.
i miss you
hate green pea but would eat the whole thing
I missed you so much
pure seratonin ily
good soup
Emma! You hit the nail on the head. I love your content, and the creative way that you deliver it! Love you so much 🖤
EMMA! You could prep the onion and garlic beforehand. You could chop them up in the food processor in bulk then store them submerged in oil :)
ily
can u make miso soup pls
should be titled as 'the story of peas'
emma add white kidney beans to your soup
OMG NOBODY CARES
Bitch! 😌 I love it when my hands smell like onion & garlic ✌️😗
Emma, for a creamier soup add a bit of the peas and potato to the blender with the broth. Then incorporate that with the rest of the whole peas and sliced potato.
We missed u so much Emma!! Love this vid its so peaceful
my favorite part..*emma eating her soup peacefully feeling so accomplished as she should*  Emma:"MMM---" music bye. i love it so much
EMMA U NEED TO WASH UR POTATOES FIRST
Rewatching cuz you said so 😂
Get it Emma!!!
I recommend the big wooden cutting board from Crate and Barrel. It’ll save your knives!!
Emma posted on my birthday!!
forgive me, its really not that deep… but i believe its pronounced boo-yon like boo ahh im so scared 👻 instead of boi. i really enjoyed this video tho food tik tok is taking over my life
it was probs soil on ur shallots
Emma, it is so exciting watching you go through the process of cooking exploration.  You know what flavors you like and recognize what works together.  Your instinct is good, so go with it. Also, about dealing with the hand stink from chopping onions or garlic…use your sink (or any other stainless steel thing available) to get rid of it.  While washing your hands with soap, rub them on any stainless steel surface and it goes away.  I know it sounds weird, but it works!
i would not be bad if Emma became a cooking channel
It is just Emma doing what's make her happy and present / we all here for it 😍😍😍😍😍😍
EMMA!!! I MISS YOU!!!
why is this video so funny in the most calming undertone way?!
can u start a cooking channel plz
This was a whole soup journey and I am here for it
i miss u
Soooo happy to see this video!!!!
I really wouldn't mind Emma making cooking into a series like this. It was so soothing to listen to this.
i'm so happy you're back<3
I miss the short nails from New York
I love your cooking videos!!!! Would love to see more dude
Maybe if you took half of the peas and blended them with the broth it would help with the color, but keep the flavor the same overall!:)
who even is this
missed u bestie
Can u make me chicken noodle soup
Love this, love you Em
Flat💀
EMMA I MISS YOU
omg finally！I‘ve been waiting for your video haha...muamua :3
this video made me realize how similar you and my dad are
this is the beginning of a cooking channel lol
this was eery
this was really nice to watch!! ending was so satisfying 😋😋
no
Honestly, you have such cerebral commentating. It’s so refreshing to hear such a direct narrative. I was enthralled the whole time. And it was peas.
the moment of silence after “idk if it’s from itching my armpit or cutting shallots”
I remember when you used to postmates everything, ugh the growth proud of you
Coming from a girl who lives in wi., I in fact care that you can consume cheese without any consequences. 🤣🤣💛🧀
Not me shedding actual years when the screen says “bye” 😭😭 see you later Emma 😫🥲🥲🥲🥲
being patient when it comes to cooking is soo hard
her pronouncing bouillon (boo-yaan) as boy-yawn has me cackling
hey emma what up? how are you? i missed u love u ❤️
The really long pause after shallot armpit story…. I felt that
my fingers smell like garlic right now!!!!!
Emma is about to open a restaurant in la
i love u sm emma
i’m so happy that you find joy in cooking.
Loving the vibe E! Looks delish! 🍲
Why do i want more though
how to love cooking: Have a massive kitchen and every luxury cooking product on the market.
Too many peas
Emma I swear to god you better come out with a cookbook called I Don't Know What the Fuck I'm Doing. kloveyoubye.
Soup queen
Only Emma can make me watch a 12 minute soup making video. Didn’t get bored at all. We miss u!
When you have the time and energy, cooking is totally fun and awesome. I also love baking.
Only Emma can trick me into watching a whole cooking tutorial lol
Sooo…are we too old for forehead kisses😢🤔
at first I questioned the peas with potatoes but that literally looks so good
This is a podcast with a video
8h ago
Bro that thumbnail is the most fucked up thing I have seen in a while
1m ago
.@  .
@. .
my biggest flex is that me and Emma have the same toaster
6:06to6:10 No i don't
yummy
MISSED YOU
pls she looked so disappointed watching the soup blend 😭😭
you 10000/10 need to publish a cookbook one of these days
you bring me comfort
Hands down best video of 2021… the amount of precision and enthusiasm that went into cooking was next level
This is my new favourite video
petition for emma to create her own resteraunt
missed u bae
I do love onion and garlic
when Emma posting a new video, my heart-
video idea. Make your own herb garden
I wanna try this soup 😩
YOU SHOULD HAVE A COOKING SHOW OR SOMETHING
These videos are making an impact on me. I just bought tempe. Now I’m thinking soup. I’m impressed.
Emma! A tip i learned a while back to get the onion/garlic smell off your fingers is to run your fingers up and down the flat side of your stainless steel knife. I do that, wash my hands and the smell is completely gone!
this is so funny and so well done. i love ur new editing style.
you’ve finally figured out how to edit ur style. i love it.
waiting for claire's pr team to reach out to u cuz we need a collab
omg ur voice overs remind me of when u used to edit urself in between ur videos. it’s like a better version of that.
vegetable "boy an" 😂
love the cooking content Emma is bringing to the table
So proud - go Girl!!!
i hate wasting food too
Looks yummy ❤️
i love that ur doing voice overs. i think it works better honestly.
❤️✌🏼
emma i can’t even tell you how happy it makes me to see you grow as a person. i’m so proud of who you have become. ily :)
I dont think you are supposed to put anything hot in the blender
Look at our Emma becoming a chef! I am a chef and the way you described having ideas in your head like that is awesome! :)
Try putting the peas in the blender first as a base then adding the stock. Love this 💕💕💕
I dont watch your content. Just came by to write....."Good Soup"
emma when do you ever not like cheese
I missed you babe, but I’m glad you had your well deserved mental break, we love you ♥️
its giving me the shining intro
Joshua Weissman is quaking
great work emma!
Emma ❤️
I do feel the same
Oooooo I wanna smell your fingernails nice cooking 🥘 vegetables
emma do you get a lot of food under your nails while cooking
Not me literally falling in love with making soup and calling myself the soup lady all week and then Emma posting this. Somehow your videos always resonate with me
everyone praising this soup right now are the same people that if they'd been served this in public school lunch, woulda took a steamy dump all over the lunch ladies LOL
alt title: making soup without a recipe!  The try guys couldn't make it, so it's just me vs my standards
I wish I could make tens of thousands of dollars from making soup
Is this ironic?
emma's videos are going in the direction of a video essay but like, the kid who forgot there was an assignment and just wings it in front of the class
I MISSED U BESTIE, you look stunning as always 😌
this is so relaxing
I <3 ur cooking vids
I MISS U SO MUCH!!!
IM SO HAPPY U POSTED
yas our queen is in trending on YouTube ♥️
I love cooking I just absolutely hate doing the dishes.
This was so cool to watch also the thumbnail + caption made me laugh.
emma this is your sign go back to New  York
Emma ily thank you for sharing your soup chronicles with us 🤍
I really love this for you Emma. You are trying things many of us are afraid of doing as well but seeing you talk to us like you’re talking to a friend about your experience and seeing you achieve your end goal is a huge serotonin boost for us all. We love you and your videos. Thank you.
My mom has always said "Medium heat is your friend, medium low is your savior."
Omg what if emma opened a restaurant… in NY?
Imagine: Emma Chamberlain cookbook, like—
Also mash you’re peas .. at least half of them anyway
I only like basil for pesto or pizza, mint would have been my choice with peas.
wash your garlic hands with a metal spoon or metal anything and the smell will go away 😌 they even sell a metal "soap" bar for this purpose lol
It’s the straining the liquid blend and then pouring what you strained out back into the soup for me. 10/10 want to try this soup tho
11.1 million omg
Yesssssssss soup!!! I swear you do everything I dream of doing when I live in my apartment by myself in a few years. The bliss of being excited to cook soup 🍜 how lovely how peaceful
cooking with Emma yassified <3
i missed you lol
I have to say this one thing, because it always bug me when I see it. But use the opposite edge of your knife to scrape food off the cutting board. Using the sharp edge of the knife to do that dulls the knife, so I thought I'd let you know! Love you and your videos Em, you're a huge influence in my life.
I have never considered restaurant food as quality food.  I have seen how restaurant food is made, so I avoid it as much as possible.
wow that music after the soup was done. it was so ominous
Not Emma SCREAMING into the mic at the beginning
hope you're feeling better, em. love you
imissyou
watching emma's videos is exactly like sipping warm soup on a cold day
We love and missed u Emma !
Martha Stewart does all kinds of cooking 101 videos, on roasting, soups, baking any category in food. Or Julia Childs.
Missed u
Emma has become our mom
she made such a simple thing like cooking soup so profound. i love u emma
always bend your fingers when you’re cutting things! this will help keep it steady and keep your fingers out of the way so you don’t get cut. and never brush things to the side of the cutting board with the sharp edge of your knife so it doesn’t go dull. :)
You should get an immersion blender! It’s so fun to use! Plus then you can avoid transferring things to a blender
COOKBOOK COOKBOOK COOKBOOK COOKBOOK COOKBOOK pls
i would probably also blend up some of the boiled potatoes and peas to give some body to the soup. my mom does it for this indian dish we make called chole bature. yeah. just coz, the potatoes have a bit of starch, that can thicken and give this nice thick soup. also add in a bit of butter? idk. never made soup whatever it is. i took a ss of ur desc, imma try making it someday. and when i do, i will let uk😤
thank you for turning my horrible day around with this video.
be my mom and make soups to me pleasee!!
Now I want soup
$17 dollar self evaluation is the low key funniest part of the video
I thought I was going crazy not being able to see Emma's upload the first time
Im ready with $17
We missed u!!
Amazing I’m loving that you founds some new passion to explore!
AS A FRENCH CANADIAN, THE WAY YOU ARE PRONOUNCING BOUILLON IS SEND ME ASSFGHJKL ily
if you arent subbed to emma then what are you doing with your life
if you blended some of your peas into the broth it would be even more green :)
Just throw your root vegetables into the soup base. No need to boil them separately. But good job!
I actually really enjoyed this video Relatable with learning to cook !
this is a good video
Rub your fingers on stainless steel to get rid of the garlic smell. I promise you it works. 😎
No offense but you need some more protein in your diet
I missed you emma.🥺💚
What is happening?..... Depressing......
what happend to Greyson and Ethan Dolan i miss then 🥺
please make a cookbook.
Gordon Ramsay has a cooking class on Masterclass…just a thought ;)
food has become the main subject of her videos for months now yet she is getting thinner and thinner every video and she films herself eating berries and salads. this is lowkey ED content on lite mode and I am worried
Gratz.   Looks delicious.   I'll give it a shot w/ what I've got.   Goo job! <3
who asked
i totally got it when Emma is explaining bout cooking especially the onion and garlic's part...ive been there as well
the real question is…please, can i have the left over soup? 😓
missed u mom <3
how do you describe a podcast with video? this one's it.
So, waited 3 weeks for a podcast video. What’s really going on?🥶
i had a vision.. a vision of my nails in the kitchen..
this had the same inspirational energy as disney short films do
you should make/write a cook book!
Props for holding the knife correctly! You’ll figure out how to dice an onion in time
good soup
was it good soup
We're all so proud of your growth 💗
im making this TOMORROW
“ and … and …. and … and “
Why did this video make me cry
i feel like this channel i slowly turning into the anything goes podcast
EMMA CHAMBERLAIN COOKBOOK…. I see it happening
I love your videos. Also the podcast is amazing. I listen to the pod when I clean. Thanks Emma🤍
no  way  could i pay that for soup lol
Hey Emma loved the video! But a tip on cutting, put the tip of the knife on the board and then press down :) you’ll cut more effectively
scientifically the ideal color of foods is brown if you think about it
Emma i absolutely love this video
do we all remember when emma was refused to cook?,now look at her she is a little chef :)
At some point I felt like this was one of Shane’s conspiracy theory videos 😅
emma talks about one subject as if she’s required to write a 5000 word essay. i love u tho
Better Than Bouillon Veg is really one of the best bouillon paste in the market. You can also try Massel. They are also vegan.👍🏻
good soup
Way to dopey to continue watch after 3 minutes. Duhhhhh
Tht looks delicious but tht pea to soup ratio was not it!
From 9:12 onward I just could not stop laughing and smiling like this is just so great and wholesome I’m crying
EMMA WE MISSED YOU
The only soup cooking video I would voluntarily watch. 💕
there was something extra comforting and peaceful about this video with showing how you were trying to formulate this recipe-free soup while also talking about the trials and errors of learning to cook. i loved it
soup looks so good!! im proud of u for being proud of ur self. #girlboss <3
Good soup
i wish i didnt hate peas.... but i do with a passion. still watched the whole vid
It’s like listening to her podcast but with images … I love it 🤍🤍🤍
Can someone with disposable income please gift this angel an immersion blender
low and slow is the way to go
a real life ratatouille.
we missed you
MORE COOKING VIDEOS PLZ
$17 is exactly what I was gonna say
this is like a visual episode of your podcast and i love it 🥺
Emma: two shots of peas
GOOD SOUP :)))))))))))
cant even explain how happy i am that you’re back. i hope you took a long enough break though that you’re feeling better ❤️ love you
shes so funny
why was this the most entertaining thing i have ever watched
SAME MILK HURTS MY STOMACH BUT NOT CHEESE AND MY FAMILY THINKS IM LYING BUT IM NOT
6 hours ago i was stalking your channel and said " it's been a month since the last vid, i miss emma " 😭
This is very how to with john wilson and i love it
Love you Emma 💚
Emma eating carbs makes me so happy
If u mix some of the peas in with the broth you could maybe get that green you were looking for? idk just a thought. loved the video!! xx
This is one of my favorite videos that you've ever made emma, it brought me so much joy
i miss my forehead kisses
I had to comment right before watching the video. Emma, you have no idea how nice it is to see you again. I was just going on a spiral downward, until I saw your recent upload and it made my night. Sending much love to Emma and everyone!!
You’re lucky you get money AND free time to be able to do things you enjoy. I wish I could relate
soup ❤️💕♥️💗💖💞❣️💓 boullion 🤍💟💌💝💘💓❣️💞💖
It’s official, emma will be a phenomenal chef by the time she’s 30
Get a vitamix you will absolutely use it for literally anything, soups, smoothies , nut butters, sorbet like my god the possibilities are endless.
WE MISSSSSSSSS YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
This is motivating me to start cooking more often! Also, since you've been cooking so much you should do another video with Joshua Weissman!
You can rub your hands on the stainless steel (generally your kitchen sink) and it helps to remove the garlic/onion smell.
I LOVE YOU
Lmao! I’ve never seen anyone make cooking soup look so complicated 😂😂 y’all I promise it’s not that hard… u don’t have to cook the potatoes separately. Bless her heart
I missed Emma so much!!! Glad you are back queen 😌✨
i missed you
Just listened to ur podcast and now I see u posted? Back to back baby
Gorgeous gorgeous girls love soup
*good soup*
Feels like an homage to how to with John Wilson! Either way it’s a 10 for me
You are back! We missed you <33
i hate garlic... i really don't get why everyone likes it so much...
As a Grandma… I am into this shit!
ตอนจบนึกว่าบัวลอยสูตรใบเตย
I do love onion and garlic soooo much!
The french word "bouillon" is "broth" is english...
Love me some disturbing music in a cooking vlog
good soup
Haha loved this! Although i am a bit more experienced in the kitchen, I have this inner voice narrating and wishing it comes out delicious. Thanks Emma 💜
WE MISSED U GREAT TO HAVE U BACK I LUV U
Why the grandmas are so into this $h*# haha
You should 100% do an appearance on Selena Gomez's show "Selena and Chef"
Can you catch me making soup?
Okay but this was pretty immaculate to watch Thank you
Those black stuff on the onions(u call it scalot something) is normal just wash it off
I love the drama this soup gives off. The music is amazing…very moving.
This sounds like a documentary
add the peas in the blender the next time you make it. it will puree it nicely.
gud sup
soup girls are the best girl
Looks so good!
This was a scary video. Like I'm Poppy.
the pause 😭😭😭
podcast voice
this was so relaxing
Y’all I’m allergic to onion and garlic I found out, literally so unfortunate like the queen herself said, THE BEST MEALS HAVE ONION AND GARLIC😭
Im the same way with cheese and milk!! I can eat cheese and yogurt no problem but if I have a glass of milk or ice cream… it hurts.
Wow that’s amazing
Good soup
omg, I feel so proud, FUCK YEAH, MAKE THAT GOOD ASS SOUP, I WANNA TRY THAT SOUP
Thank you for coming back <3
So.. we’re the shallots good? 👀
Te amo
This is like a crossover between the YouTube channel and the podcast
glad ur soup turned out
Ive been a professional chef for a living for the last 10-12 years. id happily be on call to help answer your 101 questions whenever youre needing a bit of a nudge in the right direction. lmk queen
I watched this whole video just waiting for her to start making soap
i have never thought that i will watch a video about making soup in my life and now i watched it with a 100 time more attention than which i pay for my lessons
This feels like a podcast with a nice soup visual lol love it

yeah
uuuh
esto es lo que necesitaba para seguir, te amo emma
Please, it's pronounced Bull-yon.
we miss your recent updates story:(
this narration is just next level emma what the fuck 😂🖤
what about our forehead kiss?
Wetting your hands and pouring a lot salt on them, rubbing it in will get rid of the onion smell on your hands
I’ve missed you so much, I’m whole again.
I feel like i’m listening to a “visual” podcast
GIRLLLLLL you almost turned that blender on without the lid.  I seent it!!
The fact that Emma made a 12 minute video narrating her soup making experience and it was still stimulating is astounding
Petition for Emma to make a cooking Youtube channel/ become a cooking Youtuber
AMERICANS DONT HAVE PEAS??????
You could have cut up the potatoes a bit more than you did since it's a soup. Also, for more of a green base, you could have blended up some of the peas into it. Love the video! These are just my suggestions. Take them as you please.
so happy you found your niche apart from creative media :)
i MISSED YOUUU emmaaaa
she's evolving
Its great seeing that Emma is back :)
This is basically stand up comedy for an italian
why does this feels like one of her episodes , il this
THE QUEEN IS BACK😩
it's feels like a podcast with visualization
You really inspired me to go back to cooking with this video, I’ve been struggling with my mental health for a while now and stopped doing things that I loved doing because of it, cooking was definitely one of those things..  Watching you get creative with it and having such a good time doing it really inspired to do the same, I’ll try your recipe and some others that I’ve had in mind for a while now and see how it goes! Thank you ❤️ Love from France 🇫🇷
ONLY Emma can be making soup and turn it into a life experience, ly!!
We missed you Emma!! Im glad your ok and im so proud of you for going out getting that inspiration! I will try this soup when I make it! It looks so good! Love you Em!! ❤❤
Finallyyyyyy😮‍💨 seen you post on ig & kept waiting
Emba I missed you
Search KANGSOI  in our traditional Manipur
“I don’t say this a lot but I’m fucking proud of myself”. That legitimately hurts and the fact that it happens once in a blue moon for me is a fantastic feeling
missed ya
FINALLY OMDHSLAHANA
only Emma could get us to watch a 12 minute video about a soup
Emma Thanks for uploading on my Birthday <3
I need more cooking Emma content PLS I am also trying to get into cooking
I'm kinda new here but I've noticed from alot of your vids, you don't eat meat so Im only assuming you're a vegetarian. Careful with parm cheese. It typically has calf rennet. Anyways, LOVE your channel so freaking much.
emma might have a cookbook in her future tbh
Missed you and your vids beeech, much love Em.
6:41 I thought my Bluetooth headphones died
Definitely in a soup phase my self looking to make a lentil and Italian sausage with small bites of  potato.
I LOVE it
just emma making soup . Very entertaining if you ask me
emma, you're losing too much weight and you're losing hair as a result... I've been following you for years now and it's my first time commenting on a video because i was concerned... be safe and, that soup looks bom!🔥
11:25 - the end is the best part lol
That is such a creative approach to a cooking video, i really really enjoyed every second of it!!
EMMAAAA
"I was shocked" Emma: 😐
This sounds more like a parody than Matt Colbo's video.
i love emma’s new content
omg i missed you
Who's here from Matt Colbo?
i love you <3
okay but if she made a cookbook, i would totally buy it
we missed u
This looks so good Emma! I need to make it ASAP! So proud of you!
I love u Emma!! ❤️❤️
A new emma video in the middle of a mental breakdown thank u
I would absolutely play $17 for this
Yay! No more burnt eggs! So proud of you emma! <3
I've watched making my dinner and I'm feeling so contemplative right now.
havwnt eaten in a while and this made me get up and make food
Emma’s about to start a cooking channel
Btw, if you ever read this! There are those metallic soaps that take away the smells off your hands xx
Cause you in 4 k
I love you Emma baby
you had me watching your old videos bc i missed youuuuu.
the title is in lowercase
Please start cleaning your vegetables, its disgusting
i love the podcast type feel sound over the video
Indians use a lot of potatoes and peas in their food. Add in some green chilies, onion, ginger and Garam Masala. And you’ve got perfection.
Do more videos cooking, i love it
EMMA OMG FINALLY
i loooove her podcasts but her videos don't grab my attention anymore and it makes me sad
*all the stores run out of peas, potatoes, and basil*
This is basically a soup podcast
Good soup?
This screams Gemini sun, Taurus moon
now im hungry thank you
culianry genius.
The top comment w the name mariah.. it’s no coincidence the subscribers have stayed at 11.1 milli <3
i’ll give you all my time, for sure.
miss you emma😍❤post more videos if you can because you just make your days💞
So happy you found an interest that makes you happy
Love you Emma! <3
smoking a bowl for you emma
why is noone talking about HOW DISORDERED THIS IS
i find it easier when chopping something, like those small potatoes, if you keep the tip of the knife down and just lift the handle up and down, its a little smoother and safer! <3
i love you so so much
I was waiting patiently for another video from you. I love this one, I want soup now! ☺
We need to see you making you’re new and improved eggs
We’ve missed you
I really loved this video Emma
I would cook the peas and potatoes directly in the broth, so it becomes even more tasteful and maybe even a better texture
this is beautiful
Next time leave out some of the peas and blend down the rest in the liquid and your soup would then turn green.  It would taste yummy.
This was like an Anything Goes episode, but with video 😂
Salad master
“English” green peas I never knew that we always called them garden peas or peas in the uk.
I don’t even like soup, but watching Emma make this literally makes me want to go and cook some! It looks so yummy!
:/
boyon
EMMA CHAMBERLIAN COOKBOOK
y ingredients so smol
I like how I ate some soup just before watching this. :) It looks delicious!
Emma could literally upload a video staring at the camera and I’ll still find it entertaining 😭❤️
this is cooking with emma 2.0
Milk and cheese have different proteins. Also your diet is causing your hair loss and slowly  killing u. U need more animal products.
AHHH BESTIE EMMA IS BACK <3  MISSED YOU SO MUCH HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD BREAK MWAHHH
Emma did great with this recipe!! I'm from Brazil and we kinda have the soup she was looking for. Here we called it "caldo verde" (It could be "green soup"? idk lol) and the ingredients are potatoes, peas, kale, parsley, bacon and pepperoni sausage. It's really really good, we usually eat when the weather is cold. It's not considered fancy or anything, is more like a comfort food for cold days. If you'd like to try cooking at home, just search for "receita de caldo verde". Hope you enjoy it!!
Emma I missed u & ur vids dearly
I don't want to upset you because it really is amazing that you made this without a recipe, but this already kind of exists. It's called grašak in my country and it' a traditional meal!:))
Her videos are so relaxing for me. She can do the simplest thing ever and I’ll still watch her videos. Thank you for helping me get out of my comfort zone ☺️
a tip for garlic hands: run water over them for 2-3 mins without!!!! rubbing your hands or fingers, just put your hands under the water
This background music be giving me planetarium vibes
you know, you could take a cuisine course
the way her eyes lit up from eating the soup omg 😂😂
oh my god im making soup today.... SOUPCEPTION 🍲🍲🍲
yayyyyyy missed you baeeeee
i watched this whilst eating soup
Please show us the pickled carriots, tnx
LOVE THIS.
You should seriously create a cook book!
You cutting with one finger ON THE BLADE gives me so much anxiety
bro try lemon juice for the stanky hands!!!
you make me the happiest
Emma where have u been loca
Good soup 🍜
i missed u sm
Hello to anyone in the future. Love you Emma xx
Listening to her talk about how shes never cooked without a recipie made me realize that i almost never cook with a recipie. Like ive always got bad luck with recipies. They never work out for me and i had to alter them somehow.. and i learned to cook with whatever i had soo yeah.. also like times of cooking and stuff.. its never what they tell you it is.. i just try everything to see if its cooked to my liking and thats it.. when she was freaking out bc she didnt know if she cooked the potatos and peas correctly i was so confused.. try them lol
Emma! You said you weren’t very good at chopping onion but you were killin it chopping that garlic. Keep using the curve of the knife to your advantage; you don’t have to actually lift your knife off the table if you rock your knife on the curve. Congrats on the soup :)
Tbh in Greece we already kinda had this recipe called "αρακάς με πατάτες" , but yea this one has your vibes in it :D gj
Emma you should open a cafe
in the middle of watching this i got up and made soup with emma lmao :)
Try Ina Garten/Barefoot Contessa recipes.  I think you'd love them.
That’s one too many green peas for me
Good soup👌
emma i hope your ok ❤️
yaas you are back and doing new things that makes you feel right im happy for you also i can smell that food♥️
Omg I missed her videos so much
More like $5 soup
chef emma??
an emma and claire saffitz cooking vid needs to happen 😩🥲
“Boyon” hahhahahahahahaha
why is this making me crave soup
this is the most boring video i’ve ever seen what the heck
plz share more of ur cooking journey !’ i love it!!! and i now want to try the soop
You'll probably never see this but I make homemade soup for a living and would love to write u a recipe and directions for this soup! Also posting this as ur cutting the potatoes so if you love the end result of your recipe then nevermind 🥴
ok now i want to try da soup!! it looks delicious and im so proud of u emma, u are trying to do a new hobby and u being very successful. Thanks for the inspiration to try new things <3
You should cook the potatoes in the broth the next time so the potatoes soak up all the flavor! Hope this helps love you
this was so comfy
Emma you have to read my year of rest and relaxation or eileen by ottessa moshfegh…. I have a feeling you would appreciate her books
please keep the cooking shows coming!!!!
idk but emma using minecraft music made me very happy
I love this format!!! You are so eloquent and such a great commentator. Please do more cooking videos!
This is what happened to Paul McCartney when he thought of the Yesterday tune, he was convinced it already existed. But it didn’t, Emma my child this impromptu soup makes you the fifth Beatle
This is similar to a Punjabi dish called aloo Matar!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
My boyfriend “hates” garlic, yet he thoroughly enjoys my cooking which almost always has garlic involved. 😂
لا ما احب البصل اكرهه مره و اكره ريحته و شكله في الاكل
Please try a hand blender next time. Way safer and less mess. Someone below makes a good point that heat in a blender can cause a little explosion. Soup looked good!!! : )
I watched you make this soup as i ate instant ramen noodles.
Ughhh I just love her 😩🤚🏻❤️❤️
we missed u
Holding that knife like a pro 👌
Gorgeous gorgeous girls
Thoroughly enjoying your newfound love of cooking! So rewarding!
I love cooking with Emma 💕
Adding spinach makes it green without changing the flavour
I missed you so much, Emma
This made me feel happy and warm  especially rn when it’s raining outside and I’m snuggled inside my blankets ❤️❤️❤️
it feels so strange to watch an emma video without that cute little cottage grandma music
Thank godddddddd, motivation!!
I wish I were at your level... Every upload is just received with grace👏
this was such a comfortable episode. it felt like i was watching a podcast episode
u should invest in a stainless steel soap! it helps neutralize strong odors when u cook :)
Emma, first of all I love love love you,, But plz don't do this type of videos like you put an audio podcast on a vid ... Plz don't. P.s: I loveddd your alone to New York and having a 🥯 and hot ☕ era.  P.s2: you are awesome 😎
cooking with emma looks a lot different now
Can we get a claire saffitz collab? Maybe?
Hi I missed your videos 💜
good soup
i literally cried when i saw you just posted a New video. We missed you Emma
Ya antojaste emma. :(
Try to let your oil heat before putting your veggies in it. You can test the heat with a drop of water. I would also put some of the potatoes straight into the soup, it can help to thicken your soup. In the Netherlands, maybe more countries, you have Split pea soup. Maybe something to look up. Anyway, your soup really looks good and you are making me wanting to make it too! Thanks for the inspo
I loved this thank you<3
i’ve missed you
i miss u, emma
Proud of you Emma 💘
*turns temp from high to low on the dinner I'm cooking while watching* 😂
Small channel that needs your help!
Try making french onion soup; it has the cheese and onions that you are looking for
EMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  <3
i'm very thankful u posted. hope your finee
In Greece we make a soup with peas and potatoes all the time  and its delicious ❤
MISSED YOU!!!!!!
vegtable bouy-on
As someone that loves cooking, Emma I am proud of you cuz yes this looks good
omg emma, i caught you making soup again you goof 😜😜😜😾👍😦🍊🍊✅💪🏻😾👍😍👍🤙😾😾🤙
So many questions….none of them answered
17 dollars is a good decision 🙌💫😉
Why does the narration and editing feel like the Office
EMMA!! i just recently learned from a professional chef that a lot of cheeses actually don't have any lactose in it, or very little so it's easier to digest! hard cheeses like parmesan, cheddar, etc. lose majority/all of their lactose during the making process so that's probably why it doesnt hurt your stomach! so eat that cheese queen! (:
what are your favourite recipe blogs to search through for inspiration emma?? xxx
missed you so much Emma, hope you’re doing good <3
Why was this so inspirational
i love u
All I want for christmas is... Emma uploading  more. MISS YOU but take your time  <3
this is one of the most known greek recipes!It's a basic one,u are one of us nowwwww
oh i missed you emma
I’m screaming girl soup cinema
I think Emma is going through her reputation era idk why but I just feel it
EMMA I HAVE MISSED YOU
🥳🥳
6:07 OH HECK YES!! I LOVE ONION AND GARLIC!! 😍😍😍
a whole plate of peas !!!!!
I had soup today omg
Love u Emma & ur podcast is amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️
THE SILENCE AFTER THE COMMENT ABOUT THE SMELLL OF EMMAS HANDS IS KILLING ME
the way Emma pronounces “bullion”
i was sad she didn’t upload for a while.. and then “u totally caught me making soup”😭
why can't I get over the fact that she's older than Billie eilish?
the thought of pea’s makes me want to puke but here i am, love you emma
I think the reason why watching Emma is so calming is because she doesn’t try to be hype. She just is, and it makes me feel like it’s okay to just be. And that’s enough
Emma! next time blend the peas in the blender with potato!
We need a chamberlain cooking channel
I love soup
17??
Missed you
Emma try following Greek recipes I feel like you will find good stuff there and it will suit your style of cooking ❤️
bitch you were gone for too long, i missed you. sending virtual hugs 🥺🤍
SOOD GOUP
Omgggg this made my day
we missed you
I love you Emma sm <3
"Cause I don't know what the fuck I'm doing"    - Emma Chamberlain, philosopher, motivational speaker, 2021
Good soup
this video feels like i'm in the kitchen talking to a friend while they cook
Take a shot everytime Emma says "etc"
u totally caught me watching this video entirely and not pausing at any moment moment
Hi Emma Ur never gonna read this but -I love this video style (visualized podcast storytelling?) and rating system (purchase price)  & -Im so happy u found the joy of working  creatively with food.  -For me it's always been the other way around I rate food in restaurants regarding the question if I would/could make a similar thing at home or if I cannot and actually wanna pay the price for having them prepare this food for me   If u want try these tips: - wash your hands with soap and rub them in the metal or your sink and tap to avoid the smell - u could make the broth and then add potatoes and after some minutes the peas - less dishes to clean :)  - even when ur alone in Ur household, it might be best to avoid getting Ur own germs in closed food containers..So they can stay good for longer and we don't need to throw away moldy food
I love how none of us look for the lil arrows on the blender that tell us which side the top closes on. We all just try until it goes down 😂
Everything about this video is perfect <3
wtf happened to your videos u used to be entertaining
It looks like a very good soup, but $17 at a restaurant????  That sounds high to me.  Too rich for my blood.  I will just follow your recipe and make it at home.  Yum!
Finalllyyyy ughhh
fun fact (maybe not so fun): parmesan is not vegetarian.
this was the most wholesome thing I've watched in a long time. and I want that soup!
Suddenly Emma is americas next top chef
How was your little break, we missed you, glad we can see you making some soup 😌😌 + this whole video reminds me of your podcast which is iconic
Ngl fell asleep during this, but cool u trying new editing things. Not tryna hate, just speakin the fax. Think this could work if u added more activities, but honestly what do Ik 🤷‍♂️ other people seem to love it so 🤙
Mmm 😋
Hear me out emmas cooking channel  where she invites people like rachel ray or her friends and does q and as has them rate her food?!
Little tip to get onion smell out of hands, cutting boards, wooden spoon etc.  Table salt. Lemon works doubly well with the salt but the salt works by itself as well. Any time I chop an onion I just do a lil salt scrub on my hands and surfaces. Bam. Good as new. No stink.
emma’s return reminds me of that one tiktok sound ‘so the queen is back…’
Split pea soup?
17 for a soup I gotta try this soup out fr looks fire but next time you can cook the peas and potatoes in the same pot as the broth just blended it as you did and add the veggies raw and let the potatoes and peas  absorb the flavor of the broth , also to make it more green you can add peas in the blender or spinach idk how spinach will affect the flavor tho
Shes the gals who lose their ass with growing older
i missed u
Frendly reminder: don't drag the knife thru the cutting board when you need to move some stuff because it will loose its sharpness very quickly. Do this only with the oposite side of the knife.
Looks like she’s picking up where Jenna marbles left off. Is it just me or she kind of like a younger version of Jenna marbles. No offense to Jenna.or Emma.
definitely making this, thanks for including the recipe!! <333
i’m predicting it, emma is making food career
This video brought me joy.
Can’t wait for the cookbook and kitchen decor line!
Hi cook the potatoes in the soup peeled and the peas ❤
as a soup lover you up to something and u made it happen. ill update when i do it!
Can we be friends i'll teach you how to cook🥺...get a slow cooker☺
I love that she’s narrating this entire video as if she’s a chef in chopped and all freaked out under pressure 😂 the obsession with cooking shows may be getting to her …but I relate to u queen 💗
Ngl I’m living for these cooking videos.
Gurlllll ugh I’ve been waiting so long thank u so much 🥲
it’s a great thing when u take something u love and make something brilliant out of it by putting your own original twist on it because that’s what art is u made art with this soup Emma great job I’d say that was a great feeling eating that
this felt like an experience, a podcast.
FBI HORABULA
I love your manicure
Good soup?
Emma, you have no clue how happy I was when I saw you posted a new video!!
I don't throw away food either but burnt food may cause cancer. Even crisps that are too brown may be dangerous if one eats them too often.
YESSSSS 🙌🏻 I love cooking emaaaaaa
That really looks delicious
i love how she struggled to put the blender lid on
Anyone else read that as soap and was waiting for the soap to be made
The best part of my day is watching your videos. And that soup looks amazing <333
emma if you blend up some peas into the broth too maybe itll be more green
OK but why was this more relaxing to me than my last acupuncture session fr
emma understanding the hype of reading AND cooking !? love that for her
AHHHH YOU ARE BACK WE MISS U SO MUCH
sentimos sua falta<3
Finally a new video!! We missed yoou 🤍🤍
I miss you and your videos! ❤️
Waiting for an emmachamberlain cook book…
At home wanna be chef tip wash hands in cold water no soap and it gets rid of the onion/garlic smell!
Cooking with emma emma would be so proud
Emma I’m so proud of you for inventing a recipe and getting creative in the kitchen!!!
Missed you Ms thing 🥰💗
girl that's literally aloo matar
Gorgeous gorgeous girls love soup🍜 . Soup girls are the most popular girls in the chicken coup🐓.
Imagine Emma 2021 telling Emma 2019 that cooking is her therapy and dreams about it
Been obsessed with making Baklava lately. Try it
the way she holds a knife an cuts things gives me anxiety. but definitely trying this recipe
emma love it but please sharpen your knife
Hi
MISSED YOU EMMA ❤️
i really want emma to start posting more cooking videos
Emma! remember to not cook in olive oil. Love you!
I love you so much Emma, ur soup looks delicious
Rubbing your hand with salt helps against the garlic smell
Uhhh I bet blending half of it would be bomb, you still get the full peas and potatoes but it also becomes creamy. I have to try
the background music is so good
Where are our forehead kisses? :(
there’s just something about being in the kitchen alone cooking for yourself that is so soothing
okay so, short film of the year right here
was not prepared for the $17 price tag
Chef Chamberlain 👩‍🍳
it looks so good omg
I can’t believe I sat through this whole thing. If this wasn’t an Emma video I would’ve clicked out 30 seconds in 😭
welcome back 💓
SHES ALIVE
i loved this i wanna cry
omg I might actually make this soup it looks bangin <3
When you said pea soup, it reminded me of The Rescuers Down Under Disney movie
Loml i had missed u💜
why was this video so satisfying
Since you were gone I’ve realized that I have a dependency on your videos to get me through my depressive episodes. Don’t worry I’m gonna talk to me therapist about it
good soup
comfort person
i do love onion and garlic
Chamberlain cook book will drop soon
The way you hold a knife when you're slicing stuff is giving me anxiety. Keep your fingers on the handle, not the blade or the next video we see will be "Watch Emma get her fingers reattached!" That's awesome that you're so into cooking now. Just stay safe in that kitchen!
8:39 we care Emma. WE CARE
This is my favorite episode of your life so far.
I said this on the original upload but I can DEFINITELY see Emma taking cooking classes! Chef Emma coming 2022
EMMA you should create your own version of “Anthony bourdains parts unknown” while you travel. You love food and culture so much i could totally see you doing an amazing job with a video like that♥️
I loved this style of video!!!!! MORE RECIPE VIDEOS PLEASE
This was riveting.
Just a little tip girl :) when you chop garlic to make the process easier to peel the garlic you should smash the garlic with the knife being flat and the peel comes right off.
$ 17 😭
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH
I wish I could try emma’s soup love u, bestie ❤️
I missed you
It’s good to see you again, Emma! You’re so sweet for uploading your soup recipe for everyone. I’m glad to hear that you’re enjoying cooking now. Take it easy. Love, some random girl from Australia x
Emma should go on without a recipe with the try guys. I feel like she would be really good at it
$17 US that’s a great soup
Chamberlain soup??!
Cooking with emma is kinda of back 🥰
your finally back 🥺
Will you be my personal chef? I love you Emma….You are an awesome chef and you are gorgeous.
there are these metal soap bars that can get rid of the garlic/onion smell :-)
Go       Little                 Rockstar
If i ever witness somebody having a panic attack, I would straight up bust out laugh right in there face! God I would love to see it!

I absolutely love when Emma uploads 😭 she makes me feel like I’m on ft with her
I hate cooking, I hate cooking shows/videos but it’s Emma she makes anything entertaining. I actually enjoyed watching a cooking video😳❤️
Jesus loves y’all ✝️💕

anything goes (emma's podcast) x emma's youtube vlog was the vibe i got whilst watching this whole video 100/10
MASTERCHEF IN DA HOUSEEEEEEE MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS ONE LOVE IT
Dairy free garlic dressing. Aquafaba, a few garlic cloves, salt and pepper. Blend and slowly add in some olive oil. 👀😅
this is the perfect combo of a podcast, documentary, and utube video and i loved it :)))
I love making soup. So delicious!!  Great job!!
Not my favorite. The narration was a bummer.
the Angel numbers in this video. the timer at 333 her having 111 followers. thus being at 222 views
i love you
Missed you girl it's crazy 😬❤
If you hate food waste then why throw away half of the broccoli? Make soup or stock of that, same with onion peels, carrots etc.
Love this video and the different type of story telling!! Nice soup
the final sound of emma just remember how much i feel identified with she, and it just made me happy, (she still be emma)
Ok I literally never comment on any YouTube video, but I just wanted to say thank you! I literally have been going through a horrible depression and anxiety relapsing stage and all I wanted to do was watch your new videos every Sunday, but nothing was ever uploaded so I watched old ones. That you for posting this and plus posting it on my birthday!
No lie I been craving soup. 💗 🍲 How is she in my head!!!!????
This could be a new phase in Emma’s life where she only posts once a month and I know that we could all shed a tear 😢
Good soup
IVE MISSED YOU!!!!!
wait…America doesn’t have peas? I’m so confused
good soup
This felt like I was listening to your podcast with some additional video footage. Really cool and new thing to see:)
Good soup, Emma
i missed you emma
I really really liked this style of video. You really had my attention the whole time!
Missed ya! SO glad you posted I was starting to worry! I mean you been posting pics on instagram so assumed all was well but you know… THIS is more solid proof you okay so 🙏🏼💗
Emma making me soup would be life complete 💕
she's not in mood.
This video keeps cutting out and saying playback error
Wait why are the peas English, do you not have peas in America
our emma is growing up!!! i started cooking when i was 7 and now that im 29 i love it even more lol such a stress reliver for me.
I am. SO PROUD
You can cook the potatoes with the soup. You don’t need to use oil either when sautee’g garlic, shallots. Just get pan hot first, then just add a little water after sautee’g a little. The bouillon is probably high in salt.  Can you make more videos of what you normally cook?  I’m plant based too. Thanks!!!!
It's been a minute since you posted girl, you don't know how happy I was to see your new video.Nice soup btw <333
R u fucking serious , I waited  3weeks for ur vlog ; and u come up with this shit Emma ? U just filmed your 1 time cooking and recorded ur talk for 15 min or just take it out from ur podcast idk , plz do ur regular stuff . Don’t change the content after making people wait for 3 fucking weeks .
s o u p

And I would pay… ✨17$✨ for it
The pause after the armpit scratching and shallot fingers was *chef's kiss* hella funny
This video feels like a college application essay lol
when she took such a long pause that i thought the audio on my computer went out LOLL
Queen
🙌
Wow. I do love onion and garlic 😄
The visual podcast for Anything Goes, thanks miss emma! 😊😊😊😊😊
Jsyk I, and many others, will watch literally anything you put out. Just sayin lol 👯‍♀️
Ok but it felt like the little voice in my head was commenting the video and not Emma  I relate to that way too much
Im so proud of you 😚
Peas are underrated!
Do your peas inmilk on the stove trust me milk n buttrt
Good soup
i missed u bestie
I always eat bad things because i´m a bad cook ( and i hate to waste food)
i don’t even like soup but now i wanna try this
$17 holy shit I need to make this
Emma should sell canned soup or a soup mix
Thanks for a video
not the futuristic/scifi music behind her soup making lol
this feels inspired by John Wilson
Missed my Queen, this is a great thing for me to watch before my exam tomorrow
the European in me is screaming at the skin on the potato 😂
loved this journey. love you even more. xoxo
Small petite peas are my absolute favorite and green beans
omg!! ahh u uploaded!! thank u sm!!
I eat soup right now
Wait that looks so bomb
Should we expect a cooking series soon?!
I care, Emma. Tell me about the cheese.
Omg I can't believe I got you 3 hours out.EMMA YOU'RE SOOOO BEAUTIFUL, A BREED APART. I love you so much and I love your coffee ☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕☕,💋
I think we just got a life lesson.. thx Emma! 💖💖💖
yass gotta add shallots and garliccc baby! lol great vid. i love making soups☺️
i do not like this new style of video. please talk to the camera again soon. xoxo
So happy to know I’m not alone with being someone who can handle cheese, but milk? Absolutely not😂
For fuck's sake, we get it, you're angling to publish a cook book (and not very subtle-y).
Needed this
Emma please look up how to pronounce bouillon
you should write a cookbook!
hi
bro this narration, a whole story, a journey- so good!
and for 12:11 my life was okay  <3
you should make a recipe book
Emma has made a pea soup I may actually eat 😳😳😳
i love how she can keep one video classy, funny, relatable, welcoming and spontaneous all at once
hey emma! i think you should scrub the dirt off your potatoes next time. other than that, i think your soup turned out nice!!
she’s back, i needed this video ily emma your videos are literally how i wind down
i love you, so much
Okay, but do u guys remember when everyone wanted cooking with Emma to come back?...well here we are
good soup
its the abstract
omg i so thoroughly enjoyed this im gonna make some motherfucking soup now you don't even know
only Emma could make an actual soup movie & have our full attention for 12 minutes and 11 seconds.
if you want your soup to taste better, cook it on a very low heat for few hours. It will make all the spices really come into the water.
In 30 years :  * *Notification* *"new upload from Emma's kitchen : REACTING TO AND REMAKING MY FIRST EVER RECEPIE ON YOUTUBE: GREEN BEAN SOUP!
Love this video, thanks for making this day better 🌼
The temperature talk! If you take anything from this video I hope it’s that. Low and slow lol I feel like it’s one of my biggest accomplishments of Covid is learning how to cook an egg
Outro music suits you. In a good way
This feels like EVERYTHING GOES
Why didn’t you ask papa
Missed your videos felt like I was catching up with an old friend ☺
i missed uuuuu!

I’ve missed you Emma
I missed you!
Cooking with emma🥺
UR BACK AAH :)
EMMA IM SO FREAKING PROUD OF YOUUUUU
She made...pp soup
I made a soup with peas and potatos the other day and was so excited for the lunch tomorrow to eat it... and when I came to the fridge, the soup was gone. The potatos literally soaked up all the liquid. And then I made chicken and served vegetables from the soup as side dish. :D
missed u emma :)
I’ve been really struggling recently. This video talking about absolute bullshit is making me feel..
You make me wanna cook more ❤️
it’s crazy that i just sat here listening to a woman talk about making pea soup and enjoyed every single second
i was expecting a better video. not a podcast.
fyi parmesan isnt vegetarian sadly
I was just thinking last night of how I missed you and couldn’t wait for a new video 😌
Bestie! You posted🥰
i totally caught you making soup
loveee uuuuu
Absolutley loved this video its like the perfect video to watch relax and sleep LITERALLY ✨✨✨
YES SHE'S BACK
rub your fingers on metal if they smell of garlic (like a spoon etc) :) it takes the smell away instantly
Now I wanna have a soup in 2:53 am
Fun fact: I gave my two fishes half a pea to help with their constipation .  They are okay now
I've missed you bestie
The blender is made of plastic fo be careful while adding hot stuff
MISSED YOU BESTIE
Why am I going to cry? This is just so wonderful and calming and nostalgic somehow
8:34 Not Emma rotating the blender lid to every side until she finally got it right 😂
i think it's just shallot dirt! haha mine have that too
Ok so I appreciate your videos but not much of this one. I like it better when you’re talking in the cideo
Hey, I really enjoy cooking too. If you are looking forward to cooking more soups you should try pumpkin soup. You can make a spicy or sweet one. The basic recipe is: 1 sweat potato 1 hokkaido pumpkin  5 potatoes 3 onions pepper, salt  To make it sweat, you can add a mango or some banana. If you want to make it spicy you could add some garlic and ginger. Also different spices like chili powder or red pepper powder. To make the soup you basically chop all the things in small pieces. Then you take a soup pan and fry the chopped onions (with garlic and ginger if you want to use it). After the are golden brown you take the chopped potatoes and the chopped sweat potato and put them in the soup pan as well. After they got a little golden too you add the pumpkin (and the chopped mango if uou want. It should smell delicious. Then you keep frying till the pumpkin is just getting a little brown. You add 6-8 cups of water (so that all the vegetables are covered in water) and let it boil for at least 30 min. Add the pepper and salt (other spices if you want). If everything is getting soft you put it in the mixer and mix till smooth.  The pumpkin soup is ready!! Have great day
Now I need to go make potato soup and add some peas 👍🏼  Th am for the smile and the inspiration 💜
Love this, you did awesome!
your voice is so soothing. Really love this video and how you walk through your thinking process
btw if you DO wanna get rid of the onion and garlic smell off your fingers, just rub your fingers on stainless steel and it should get rid of the smell
Love u
Yess a cooking video ! I loved this . So calming
You don't know how fast I ran to the grocery store to make this it looks so good!
what i always put the pot in the back stove (near the backsplash) cause id something falls on u, u hv time to back off b4 getting burned but u don’t hv time to protect ur self when the hot pot is in the front
God.  That's $17 rating at the end of the video was my favorite part.
This is Anything Goes with Emma but with a movie attached
if you want to know if the potatoes are cooked stick a knife in one or three and if the knife come out without the potato the are cooked
1.11 subscribers & 12:12 video 🔮💖
Boyan hahaha
The more fat there is in dairy products, the less they will respond with your stomach. The fat slows down the response lactose gives your stomach so that’s probably why you can eat cheese with no problem, but not milk. Cheese is higher in fat than milk :)
Pls open a cafe-restaurant later with all ur food and coffee recipes!!! i would literally come eat every week
this is a major slay
Emma’s cookbook coming to a book store near you in 2023 😂🙏🏽
YESSS GOOD JOB GIRL
Girl you need to sharpen that knife
ilysm
Эмма открыла гороховый суп!! 🤣🤍
Bestie I hate peas tho.. but go off
this felt like watching a low budget documentary and i loved it
Next time you cut onion and garlic if you wash your hands with cold water instead of hot water the smell doesn’t get into your pores in your hands as much
No, because this look so good… I’m making immediately.
im so at peace
I know I love onion and garlic, that is the definition of being Portuguese
more on the cheese and milk research situation because the same thing happens for me
I love you, but I like when you talk in real time not voice over
You gotta try Roast My Ugly Vegan Food 2.0... Classic ish
“I don’t think anyone cares.” Girl there’s a reason we watch your videos, I WANNA KNOW THE SCIENCE ON WHY CHEESE DOESNT HURT UR TUMMY
I EAT 2 EGGS IN THE MICROWAVE AND LOTS OF HAM AND A KAISER BUN 🍔
Cooking with emma is therapy
This is what progress looks like… shoutout to self growth & improvement 💙💙
on thins episode of "anything goes"

Tellement drôle le début le plan ça m a fait trop rire 🤣
i've missed you<3
7:56 you must be very brave to use this thing with long nails lmao
i am also in the "i get cooking" phase of my life, and it takes about 3 hours of my day to make my meals, but im obsessed.
The way she says “bouillon ” lmao 🤣. Love ya @emma
This looks so great Emma! A little tip, you could probably get that green color you were looking for by blending in a half cup or so of the peas in with your broth mixture <3
Missed you sweetie
Emma!!!! This video is what the world needs. It’s what I need anyway
I can’t believe Emma managed to turn a video about making soup to an allegory about patience and perseverance
welcome back kween
Why is this video such a vibe
emma needs to make a cookbook now.
A new video finally? This day just keeps getting better 🥰🥰🥰
What an experience.  Thank you.
I once was cooking and accidentally spilled cocoa powder all over my grandmas porkchops that she'd JUST taken out of the oven 🙃
i missed you & your videos 😫💗
You can also add corn starch for thicker soup
When her follower count is 1,11 mil 👼🏼 if you know you know
❤️❤️❤️
that some eerie ass music for a pea soup
Spinach could make it more green and the flavor would also be insane
This was magical
please come out with a cookware line
that's defenitely 'peas with soup' and not 'soup with peas' xp
i totally caught u making soup
missed you
Potato, peas, Basel , onion reminds me a perfect samber Emma you gotta try this indian dish
i missed u. needed this video today <3

Hahaha “what the fuck’s going on here?” When discussing your research on cooking potatoes 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good soup
I love this video sm it gives Anything Goes
Emma thank you, I’m having my final test for statistics and this is really calming me
Looks incredible as is, I myself would have added a bit of heavy whipping cream but that’s bc I like really heavy soups. But it looks amazing!
I use that veggie bouillon it makes everything yummy! Better Than Bouillon is the best! You can't go wrong!
okay finally bcussss I missed uuuuu🤍🤍🤍😩
Wow the effort and just the thought that went into this video was phenomenal 👏  I love cooking videos and I love your videos and I got the best of both worlds  💞
No because I really could live off just soup for the rest of my life

I bought the emma phonecase 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
missed u xoxo
i Love u emma 💕💕
so glad you're back i love u. you are my happiness
can someone do gods work and let me know what the music is at 10:15 and 11:48 ...
get yourself an emulsifier girl, cuts out the blender step entirely which is beautiful (also looks like a bomb soup)
Is this how Americans pronounce bouillon? Honest question I'm not a native speaker. I love it!! Boyann!!!!!
love this character development
omg emma I think u should try to make sushis, I sometimes cook some and they're really good!
ily for this
Emma do you need a dog? I can bark 🥺
We missed you! ❤️
Alternate title: $17 soup
Bouyon. The french cant spell, its not you emma xoxo
As an avid soup gurl, i just like the bown everything in the same pout and add broth but you made it fancccccy. Id eat it
Give us 1 hour videos of this, please 🙏🏻
Miss Emma I’m so happy to see you Again, 3 weeks was way to long😭. I was so happy and excited to see that you posted a new video I commented on this before I even watched it!!! And I’m sure the video is gonna be amazing like all your other ones. Love you, hope you doing great ❤️❤️❤️
I’m not sure what LA is like but we have stray cats in the nbhd here and if there’s extra food we food them since they’re not house cats they’re used to digging up food anyway so might as well give it to them
If you’re going through the cheese phase, Trader Joe’s Unexpected Cheddar is your next adventure.
A cooking tutorial with recipes included by Emma! Talk about making bank! She should start her own Cooking show! Go Emma! She's all grown up now! LMAO!
Emma! Where have you been loca ?!💕😍
omg welcome back emma!!!! LOVE YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK you deserve the whole world!
When she put the hot soup in the blender and for a split second, went to switch it on before putting the lid on, omg lol
Priceless soup
Not everyone likes onion and garlic. They can taste it in a dish if there's any, and don't like it.. They have a strong flavour!
Nice video Emma
OMG I MISSED YOU SO MUCH 😭 ❤
Gorgeous gorgeous girls love soup 🥰
i missed you so much

Strong John Wilson vibes on this one. I love it
This makes me happy 🥰
i hope emma makes a recipe book soon
I MISSED U MOM
I've never missed a Youtuber as much as Emma
tbh it is really refreshing to see a super rich youtuber who actually uses their nice ass kitchen instead of just ordering postmates for every meal lol
snert

Is she eating unpeeled potatoes😭😭😭
I missed you!!!
We missed u queen 🤍

I MISSED U EMBA
I just have gut feeling that you're going to write a book about your cooking journey one day and the how you ended up being a professional chef
Ill make the soup
luv youuu
This highkey sounds like the long ass story before you get the recipe but like... I liked this one
You just want to be Claire Saffitz
I need more of emma cooking, I enjoyed this so much
We already know you're gonna be coming out with a cook book eventually, watchu gon call it

U can rub ur hands/fingertips on stainless steel to remove the garlic smell!
Thanks for making yummy soup for us
I love u
U DONT KNOW HOW MUCH I MISSED U EMMAARR
I’m British and was wondering is $17 a normal amount for a bowl of soup in a restaurant?? Here it’s around £6/£7 xxx
Ur backk yay
wtf happened
Therapy isn’t free but Emma’s vlogs are 🤠
Next year: Emma publishes her first cookbook. I’m so here for it👍👍👍👍
I gave you a like for this 17 $ soup

i didn’t imagine i would ever watch such an in-depth video about how to make a soup. but then again its emma who’s making it so can’t complain
Hi
Hi
She uploaded on my birthday💘💘 love you emma
i’ve missed u love u queen
who's waiting for emma to open her own restaurant?
i missed you queen❤️
Hi bestie🤍❤️✨🥺😘🎊🤍💕✨
I’ve missed you Emma
I hope this isn't annoying to say, BUT be soooo careful blending really hot liquids, they expand and the blender can literally explode. If you open the little pour vent on the top you should be fine. Also, the soup looks phenom, 10/10, will be trying.
emma if you put a couple peas in when u blended it u probably wouldve got  a nicer colour :)
well, that's A LOT of peas
its good to see you back emma<3
hey Emma, I'm Turkish and we have A LOT of veggie soup recepie. Most people thinks that  our cuisine includeus generally meat dishes but we have a lot of delicious veggie recepie. Especially we have tons of different soup. So I'm highly reccomend to you to check it. Love you <3
this is so authentic i love it
we missed you emby chamby
Emma is gonna watch this in 20 years be like : 👁👄👁
😻I just adore you Emma
I‘ll teach you to dice an onion
More taters, less peas next time.   :)
Emma by a soup maker!!! I brought one the other day it’s such a cool Gadget
U didn’t post for so long I started getting separation anxiety never do that again 🙄😿😾
proof that gorgeous gorgeous girls really do love soup
Emma I don't know if you're still worried about your new editing and taking it back... but this is *chef's kiss* and makes the world all okay for 12 mins. thank you <3
watch them fingers when cutting 😳
Can we get the recipe for your soup pls Emma
Ur Videos are so chill to me. It brings me down everytime. Thank u sm.❤
emma the chef!!!
she's backkkkkkk<3
the chef is back
It would’ve been cool if you said “cooking things low and slow is the way 2 go”
Good Soup!
Lol I would NEVER pay £17 for a soup…. Don’t think I’d even pay £7. Must’ve been good soup
good soup.
Wait. Why did you take this down then put it back up. I watched it the first time around ...
new emma vid!!!!! hot chocolate: ready
I want you to do a video of like three recipes that are fire.
I love to make soup!  Also love using the Veg Better than Bouillon.  It adds such a good flavour to soup and is perfectly salty.  If you're using potatoes and peas in a soup again you should try blending some of those in too!  Makes for a thicker broth.  Anyway this sounds delicious and I might have to try a basil soup!
You will love original greek - Turkish - Italian food
You should cook persian food 🤌🏻
One time at a music festival my best friend and I got the entire camping section chanting SOUP, SOUP, SOUP, SOUP!!! 😂🍲🤷 Soup is life! Love you Emma!
:)
Emma is to bouillon as life is to soup.
Looks so delish! Any chefs on here know how to make her soup green like how she wanted? Let’s solve this, fam!
I feel like these type of  cooking 🥘 videos would be the only ones I would Watch
“It’s yummy” Two seconds later: idk what that rancid smell is 🤣
now i wanna eat it
You should had chik next time but looks so good
Emma releasing a cookbook 😏🧐🧐
The next time put slices of carrots with the potatoes
From when I started watching Emma I started having thought about being a YouTuber and blogging. ( exactly what Emma does)😃😆
i love you emma
i missed emma's videos sm
Is cereal soup?
its like listen one of your podcasts but with the visiual
"I've never used boy-yawn before"   same energy as   "I've never been to oova java" 😂❤️
I love Emma but Ik so many young underage people watch her so maybe let’s not drink while also underage…
BON APPETITE!!
i missed you soooooooo muchhhhh emma i love you
is this what its like realising hobbies esit when you're rich
when she talked about she itching her armpit... dude I feel like she is a philosopher (no joke)
I LOVE IT i’m going to make it
This vid reminds me of the fly episode in breaking bad. Strangely metaphoric
That was fun. Love you queen
i love you emma
After having covid garlic and onion taste and smell rotten to me☠️😭 I used to love them.
literally, Emma uploading this video made my all day. so happy she is back.
Love the narrating style of video.
Better Than Bouillon is the best!
Add a little bit of corn starch to your soup for thickness :)
So happy
Parmesan has VERY low lactose content so typically lactose intolerant people can eat it and be okay... also try boiling the rind of the parmesan in the soup it gives such a good cheesy flavor! also you could try blending the peas and also make that part of the base of the soup to make it greener and give it a thicker texture.
During this hard time for me, your videos have given me some solace. Thank you
emma im glad your back! please don't leave us,,not like liza, PLEASE
Dear Emma, I would definitely eat and enjoy this pea potato Soup!  BUT I would never pay $17 for it haha
We missed you Emma 😭❤️so happy that ur back.
This was like a video podcast ☘☘🔥
The soup looks delicious and I’m proud of you for making it. Just a suggestion being that I am a chef, you might consider these things to make the soup base look more green. First, training like a quarter cup of the peas that you were putting in the soup into the blender and blending it. If it’s still not green enough, you might add a leaf or two of baby spinach. This will add color without competing with the flavor of the basil, shallot and garlic.
Love you Emma thank you for always keeping me entertained
lmfao her gemini screams so loud sometimes I loved this
✨peas✨
te amo
te extrañe mucho<3
Oh dude i've waited for this, so happy you're back❤
Try adding some zuchinni (cut into 1 inch slices) right before adding the water, after 10 minutes it should be fully cooked and the soup will turn out much greener after blending. Also garnishing with lemon zest could fit amazing with this recipe :)
why was this weirdly poetic?!?!!
12.12
rub your hands on a metal pan after chopping garlic, onion, etc. Then wash your hands! Smell gone!
If you want the broth to look more green maybe try throwing in some spinach
i’ve had a horrible week at school, my house hasn’t been great either, thank you so much for just fucking talking about soup for 12 minutes, i don’t know why but that was exactly what i needed to hear rn, i love you, u da best
My favorite step is Emma straining the soup and then dumping what is in the strainer back into the pot... next level technique ;)
Looks delicious. Defo will try. Thx :)
“Finally I think I understand”… this is growing up in a simple sentence. Love it.
STOP IM SOMLATE NOW STUPID AS SSCHOOL AHHHH
Emma I do care about why cheese doesn't affect your stomach
Can you and Joshua Weismann make soup together 🥲 Soup girls are the most popular girls in the chicken coop
am i watching a cooking show or an emma chamberlain video, i will never know but i love it
دلمون برات تنگ شده بود بابا 😩
Also I loved It dont get me wrong
I hope Claire Saffitz is watching this
🥰
darling that's not a soup. that's a bowl full of green pees plus some water. it's barely even liquid:D
Pls do the videos like it used to be 🤦🏻‍♀️
i have never missed someone this much...
i loved everything abt this
the queen is back!
I’m early!
u understand me Emma.
Thanks for telling us to cook on lower temperature!
if this was a short tiktok video the sound would be "good soup"
NOO bc I was literally just thinking “I wonder when Emma’s gonna post?” and u DID, queen never fails to deliver 😤✋
Not you about to start a new salmon and rice trend.  Queen
That veggie boullioen or whatever the name is has WAY too much sofium, consider the chicken one eventhough you’re vegetarian
So, I love the video, I really do. This video is a master piece BUT... But... please DO NOT BLEND HOT LIQUIDS is super dangerous. Love you 😘😘 and I want the best (less hazardous) soup making experience you could have.
i’ve heard that if u comment ur favourite YouTubers name three times they’ll pin u and ik it sounds cringy Emma Chamberlain  Emma Chamberlain Emma Chamberlain even tho emma probably won’t see this she is my favourite.
This is a little borinf
Missed you!
I MISSED YOU A LOT
only 12 min are you seriously??? i needed mooore
chamberlain coffee might need a soup pop up
When I saw the notif  I said “yay!” rlly loud and my brother looked at me weird but it’s so worth it 😩
I luv cooking Emma sm she’s so mature and cool
i’m so proud of you Emma!
Rinse your shallots/onions with cold water. Often times the black substance in between the skin/layers is just dirt as onions do grow in the ground. Dirt won’t kill you but best to not consume it!
Next time, maybe blend up some peas in with the base. It bet it'll be really good.
I’ve missed you
EMMA sometimes my stomach doesn’t hurt when I eat cheese but always hurts when I drink milk WHATS the science
Loving the fact that Emma is enjoying cooking, but she did not wash her potatoes. You can get yummy aches from not washing potatoes too girlie!
im hungry now😋✨
i need to know what music you played in the video rn
EMMA! i NEED you to share more recipes.
YESSSS
WE HAVE MISSED YOU
yawn
The soup looks so good !!!, I think next time you make it you should blend it all together with an emersion blender for soup, it might give you that vibrant green color that you had in your head !
i missed you, thank you for this
omg Emma you should do a collab with The Try Guys in their The Try Guys Make *food item* Without A Recipe series
Yaaaayyyy Emma. We love a self-confident Chef 👩‍🍳💕
OKAY I WANT SOUP
ok
I always watch your videos while I have dinner and for some reason today I decided to prepare my first kale soup. the thing is that I didn't have a recipie either and when I was watching it I could relate to every single thing that came out of your mouth because I had just lived it. It was a strange felling but I loved it. Definatly will be trying your soup. thanks for eveything<3
:,) good soup
drop a recipeee, we want some of that soup 😭
This is a fucking gem 😭😭😭
EmmaEmmaEmma, grocery store time, soup items hmmmm in the description, garlic, shallots, vegan bullion, chives, basil leaves, makin a list, checkin’ it twice,  “” Fannie’s Magic Irish Farie Soup “” , thank you
Please more of these videos they’re perfect for studying
I would genuinely pay to try that soup... and not just because Emma made it
i have a feeling emma is gonna make a cook book
this is a strange video but i really like it
We Indians call this pea and potato combo as 'Aloo Matar ki sabzi'
You look and sound like mini lady gaga
This video is like a parable. A short story with a hidden deeper message. You cooked, not liking to cook. You tried your own recipe in hopes it will turn out all right. While cooking, you realized that not everything has to be cooked on high. You were questioning your cooking technique because you were shooting in the dark. But you kept going. Your dish dream didn’t come together but your reality dish was worth $17 dollars! the taste of your finished soup was greatly surprising, you loved it and you were proud of yourself.   Moral of the parable: What if everything goes right? just try it.
Parmesan has no lactose! That’s why it doesn’t hurt your tum
i literally eat peas DAILY they're so good
not me watching this entire video and being allergic to peas
I love her. "I hate wasting food" throwing in the trash the initial and the final part of those potatoes in the while. Without peeling out them
missed you emma
Missed you
I missed you
these kinds of soups are actually pop.in Europe
Realistic, this is what cooking looks like Emma, you are a chef ✨
12 minuets of pure joy <3
SHE’S BACK 🥺💗
Emma, I’m proud of you too, I’ve been watching your old cooking with Emma videos because I recently became a fan, but seeing you now compared to then, amazing 👏🏽. You’ve grown girl !
I MISSED YOU!!!!
the fact that she can create innovative recipes out of nothing is impressive
emma u need ur own cooking show !! :))
wow. emma really is growing up.
Its interesting that she has stopped cussing as much as she used to, because as you read, your vocabulary increases which takes away the need to express your self through cuss words. So um yeah. :)))
yo nice soup
sorry but i really do hate onions and garlic cause i hate aftertaste🙁
This literally calmed me down🥲
the ending made me laugh 😂"...and i would pay 17$ for it" ❤️ super glad to see you back!
Baby u should post more ,we miss u🥺
I missed u so much. I love you <3
this was so comforting to watch
i'm so proud of emma. she has grown so much since last year. i also love the new video format.
Parmesan doesn’t hurt your stomach because it is very low in lactose compared to something like milk :) I’m sure you know this, but glad you can enjoy some cheese!
she’s just so comforting
i loved this, thank you
The long pause after she talked about touching shallots and then scratching her armpit had me in tears!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
would make this except i’m completely lazy ❤️
why did i get emotional during this
I didnt really like the "podcast" way of filming this, but happy for the good soup :)
is she saying bouillon weird or am I just Canadian
Emma you’re amazing!
I missed her😭
I would actually purchase a physical recipe book from you. ❤️
I LOVE U
Where the fuck did u go Emma.
thank u i missed u so much
Hey  Gonna make this tomorrow ❤️
a tip for a pretty good soup and to thicken it, add some lentils, or quinoa, or any legume or grain, it’s so good!
This inspires me to continue to bake like I always do! I’ve always enjoyed baking but I only do it when I’m stressed which is not good, but it calms me. Idk, something about baking just brings me and my mind somewhere else and I love it. So I completely understand how you feel Emma! I love you xxx <3
The queen is back 😫🤍
miss Emma chamberlain we need to have a talk about your recent behavior missy
Yes the dish is called Cau Cau and it’s Peruvian
i love u emma !
watching again because emma said to!
I needed a dose of Emma chamberlain!!!!!
emma for more of the flavor of your spices toast them!!! just heat them on a skillet w some oil for a bit
MISSSSSSED YOUUU
And just like that  the soup   was done    * extraterrestrial music plays*
SO HAPPY YOU POSTED ILY
peas with a side of soup
Loved it ✨❤️
Boy Yawn Vegetable Boy Yawn
Emma there is no milk in parmesan
my heart skipped a beat when i saw you posted <3
Does ur toaster have a screen…
I felt the phrase 'the thought of waking up in the morning and cooking excites me... and that it is priceless'. Things that make you get up of bed are definitely priceless.
This was so relaxing i loved every minute of this <3
THAT SILENCE WAS LOUD AF
You put way too many peas in the soup so you failed and that must be really hard for you ;) ;) xxxxxxx
just watched you make soup for 12 minutes and I enjoyed every second! so glad that it tasted as good as it looked
OMG I MISSED U SO MUCH
emma i care about your milk/cheese research <3
I really liked watching it, idk its relaxing
This was great!! Love you Emma x
Emma you have a little bit soup in your peas
I love you 🦋
it looks sooooo delicious I would pay $20
missed u sm! but also hope you get to rest and to like disappear when you want ♥︎
Bestie, it was waiting for a new vid for weeks
if you don't like garlic or onion smell on your hands (for several days at that) there are stainless steel soap bars that help with this  worked great for me can totally recommend these :)
i love u
I loved the videocast mode!!!!!! And i wanted to try this soup so baddd
Love u, Emma<3333
This girl is a fucking genius. I don’t know. She make boring things entertaining wich is amazing (and confusing). Love your content Emma :)!
MISSED U
I missed you, Emma
I MISS YOU SO MUCH EMMA
Love it
Seeing that you posted made my entire day so much better.
im so excited to try this soup bro
I need a podcast episode about how to enjoy cooking😩 I cook every day for myself and my husband and it still feels like such a chore
So she remembered her YouTube password
legit her videos have grown with her... like this is an utter materpiece and her recent videos are all so calming to watch.. i never miss any of them because i LOVE the way they make me feel
Yay another video. Its been a bit long since I last watched ur previous vid. Wishing U all the best. all the way from the uk 😇
OMG!! YAS THE QUEEN IS BACK
Great job Emma! Just an fyi the thing about making soup is its a one pot thing! The longer it simmers all together the better it becomes. Save yourself the unneeded steps and cook all together in the soup pot! Congrats on enjoying the Joy of cooking!
EMMMAAAAA ♡
i just want you to know that this is what i'm watching on my birthday i love soup emma you're a treasure
YES U BACK
Endlessly entertaining! More kitchen experiments please
no comment on the iPad toaster?
this reminds me of the soup that Shrek washed his hands in the dinner scene of Shrek 2
I MISSED HER
my source of happiness is here!!!!!!!
This really inspires me to make soup now!
I'm so proud of you
Good soup
These videos are so calm and therapeutic and Emma is like a friend I always wished to have. This is wholesome content. - Love from a fellow creator 💙
Good soup.
please make a cookbook please
I will make this today it looks so good
this has the feelings of a murder documentary but it's a pea soup recipe and I love it
Emma i am writing my first essay about you:)
her videos are becoming their own kind of art like they have to win an award
I truly love mom Emma
$17
this feels like you finally understood that one math equation hhhhh :p
Hi Emma. My tip of the day is……after chopping onion and garlic wipe your damp hands on your stainless steel faucet. It takes the smell away 😄
Best notifications ever
why lie? it was not the only shallot you had, see 4:30
Watching this while eating a soup i made yesterday
When I finish watching Emma's videos and return to YT home page my world starts to have no meaning again
thats the beauty of cooking you can cooking everything to be exactly how you like it
missed you love you
ILOVEYOUUU!!!
This was excellent ✨🍜 love peas and veg bouillon soups
This looks so amateur  Also she did put a lot of peas lol
This video was so comforting... Even though I ate soup 2 days ago and vomited 3 times after 😭
Don't u peel the potatoes ?? U getting me confused over here
brb rewatching emmas old videos because this shit sucks
i hope you know you inspired me to make soup
My comfort person
Literally no one is as funny as her like
Mmmm good soup
Hi Emma ! I dont' know if you watch the comments, but I wanted to let You know that actually in Hungary we have a really similar soup called green been soup it's just contains more vegetables like carrot . I hope one day you'll try it out (and that you will like it ). :) xoxo from Hungary. (love your videos and podcast <3)
I missed youuuuuu
I missed you. This made my day. Ily so much it hurts
Making soup is something everyone should do cause the sodium is so high on almost all soup you buy in the store. This did sound like audio from a podcast. I think Emma may be done speaking to the camera.  Less personal but I think she is more comfortable doing this. Besides too many people get too attached to Emma, a complete stranger, I have noticed reading comments.
Emma cooking is just the most relaxing thing to watch
I missed her uploading so much🥺
im very proud of emma i love how cooking makes her so happy
Good soup
Little chefs tip for handling the knife - use the back of it when you scratch the veggies from the cutting board. It will blunt more slowly ;) *smart ass mode off
Ooooo if you try another recipe with peas, you should try to blend them! It creates such a nice creamy texture🌸
I totally caught Emma making soup
YES IVE MISSEF YOU
emma's video = therapy= (hence) should be shown in schools= better mental health= (no serial killers=) better humans
Leeks in lieu of onion for a more green color.  Also delicious with potatoes and peas
emma duuuuude ! :)))))))
this video reminded me so much of the vibe of your podcasts !!!
love the video! as a tip i would start with a smaller knife to cut garlic, onions and stuff it’s easier to handle! and you can cut it more precisely/have more control
The way you said bouillon is so cute 😂
The look on her face after tasting it is just everything
I MISSED YOU EMMA
Sooo tell me Why the fck evry time I got drunk/hungover emmas new video is my cure like legit no joke but I’m not complaining tho HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA 😂😍🤯
Been waiting‼️‼️
The finished product looks so good!
this is amazing emma
OMG THIS IS ACTUALLY A DISH IN MY CULTURE AND IT'S MORE LIKA A STEW THAN A SOUP
$17 😩
This is the most dramatic cooking video I’ve ever watched
just what I needed
Good soup
comfort person
i feel vip for having seen the first upload
now let the cooking content commence !! missed u emma <3
Omg !!!! That soup  looks like egyptian vegetable soup !!! 🥺❤️❤️❤️
a masterpiece
oh hi so this is actually like a romanian dish but reimagined. we like to make it more like a stew and have the peas paired with a sort of meat, usually sausage. this is a great recipe! love u emma ❤️
Pro tip!!! I would've blended half of the peas and potato's into your soup mix! You did good tho! Cooking is such a stress reliever for myself. Keep doing it.
I just feel like I need to do this soup now
missed you
Sooo happy to see you again. Hopefully you doing well
I’m so sorry but ur yt channel is getting a bit boring emma
who else isn't studying for their exams and watching this
my mouth is watering
enter this in cannes ⭐️
COMFORT HUMAN
absolutely love it
Love this video! Now you have to go out and buy different purpose knifes. Lengths, scalloped, depth.  Crush a lemon slice in your hand, it will remove the smell.  This was fun!
ahhhhh i missed you
So nourishing
omg yes my source of happiness is here
i feel like you’re the best person to have a wine night with
Strange, I easily found many recipes for basil broth with peas and potato.
this does not feel like an emma chamberlain video.. it's just so depressing and i miss her old videos so much
not me watching a making soup video and being VERY RELAXED watching it !
Art
I loved this so much
I’m in looo000ooovvv3
missed you bitch
onion and garlic with a touch of salt 👌
lowkey learning how to cook w emma
It looks so yummyyyyyyyy
I love her
✨ good soup ✨
i love you so much em
I’m interested to know Emma, do you listen to music/podcast when you cook?
Emma has a cooking channel now and I'm here for it. 👩‍🍳
How many times bouillon is said
ladies and gentleman... now THIS is an influencer
Just need to wash the shallots before cutting next time lol (it's just dirt that's easy to wash off, all shallots usually have dirt on them)
Missed you ♥️
Your videos are good for my soul😊❤️
I actually loved this... the way you show us a completely different side of YouTube... just wow
Missed you bestie
you think you can hurt me? i survived the emma chamberlain drought
We should be friends
Looks good but that’s a lot of work and cleanup for two bowls of soup.
EMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA....you caught me off guard 😭
Lol not gonna lie I made this soup today and it was so good
EMMA PLEASE PLEASE MAKE A COOKBOOK
How is she eating parmesan if she’s vegan? Parmesan has animal rennet in it.
i don't think i've ever been more focused watching a youtube video
I thought it said “making soap” and now I’m disappointed
love you more
good soup
I love u 🤎🐻
Oh yeah she is definitely gonna make a recipe book✨
Imissyou emma thanks for uploading today hehe
I’m getting cooking mama vibes and I’m here for it
that looks so good emma! next time if you want to get a more vibrant green, try blending half of the peas with the broth 💚
I missed you love
OMG I LOVE SOUP! Not even kidding though. If it's all I could eat, I would eat soup. I basically like eat it on the daily or if not weekly because it's soo good. I also like how I can mix it up each time I make soup
Felt like too many steps for a potato soup
Emma: Boy-on…😀 Me: Boo-yon…😣 7:00 😂
we missed you🥲❤️❤️
does she or does she not have the perfect “cooking mom hands” 🤣🤣🤣❤️
i’ll be waiting for the chamberlain cookbook to release
I can never justify spending money for food at a restaurant. It has to be an ultra super special occasion. And I'd still go for the cheapest thing that I can eat. Is $17 a lot for a soup? It seems like it, so it must taste amazing!
These videos are my happy place. Thanks, bestie xxx
Yay Emma, damn ion even eat peas but damn that ish look good!🔥
THE END
EMMA!!!!! WE MISSED YOU SO FREAKING MUCH
Thank u for make me happy
If Emma made a cookbook I would buy it and make every single recipe in it
Soup, just like this video, soothes me. Thank you Emma💚
I see nothing wrong with hands smiling like food
isn’t this kind of minestroney
I'm so proud of you, your cooking is going better💕
The same think happened to be trying to make fried rice and Japanese pancake... the pancake was a disaster I was super angry
Yes, this is my favorite video on youtube
missed u bb
I MISSED YOU
i would but it for $23
the soup looks so good ngl
dropped everything i was doing to come watch. happy you're back bestie<3
I love you
I don’t understand how she hates wasting food while she cuts the extremities of potatoes (??) and in other videos she wastes almost half of the strawberries
Ilym
Baaaaaaabe! Get a stick blender for the ultimate soup making experience!
Hey Emma, I hope you’re good. I don’t know if you do that already but you can freeze the shell/ peel of onions (carrots, potatoes and similar vegetables) and make delicious vegan stocks for soups and sauces with it! :)
thanks 4 the video. its my birthday present :)
Long time no see !!!!!
Emma ur editing has always had so much personality but recently the level of artistry and personality in your videos is so humorous and clever
This feels like it’s leading up to a cook book release
hey i missed you :)
You know you shouldn't cut off the tops of a potato, right? A potato is not like a cucumber or something
dirt, the grey substance is dirt
emma, have you just invented a soup?
I love how she says "boyan" for bouillon ❤ so cute
Only Emma could make a video about soup interesting
emma pls bring back forehead kisses I am begging you
this is my free therapy
yes i do love onion and garlic
You caught me catching you make soup
I felt like I'm listening Joe from You at some point
emma chamberlain cookbook! emma chamberlain cookbook!
It would be easier if you just threw everything in one pot and cook it like that😝
missed you a lot <33
Okay hear me out — younger Emma had the “Cooking with Emma” segment. Older Emma should have a “Chef Chamberlain” segment! 👩‍🍳
emma i am so fkn proud of you aaaah!!! absolutely love this video, also i dont rly like soup but i certainly would eat this one LOOK SO GOOD COOKING QUEEN <3
<3
I just miss u everytime I finish your new vids
There's lactose in milk but not in parmesan because it's aged!
Emma goes to bora bora, gets tattoos, goes to events but will shows us her soup recipe. SHOW US THE FUN STUFF
SHE’S BACK!!!!
I’m having such a bad day and I really needed this, thank you Emma 💛
Tbh not really into this style of video
I missed you
Thank you for uploading aaaAaaa
the green peas were the main character in this
she made me interested in soup. I hate soup. She's an amazing storyteller and videographer
.
AHHH im so glad your vlogs are back! missed you :D
Shit I missed her.
lolz...
Watching her videos is like being on FaceTime with her😭
I missed you emma🥺
thank u for always making my day better. your videos, podcast and overall content always make me feel better. thanks emma. <3
Cooking is the new spiritualist method to stay sane.
This whole time I thought it said soap I was like where’s the soap
emma, fully cook the veggies in the broth so it absorbs the flavor
who else excited for an emma cookbook?
Loved this ❤.  I went through a soup/stew phase in my 30's and had some great success except I never wrote any of the recipes down. Once I took a pot of vegetable beef soup to the neighbors who were sick and she brought the pot  back and asked for the recipe while praising the soup and when I said I didn't have one I just threw things in to taste she acted like I was purposely keeping it a secret from her! I'm glad you were proud of yourself Emma, that's what counts!
we miss u
EMMA WE MISSED YOU
that was the most beautiful thing ive ever watched
girl ngl when you started cooking this i was worried...now i want to make this soup...you're an inspiration to us all, emma
My heart stopped 8:31 I thought she started the blender without the lid 😮‍💨
Hope you enjoyed ur recipe and can't wait to tried out
Would´nt be mad if this turned into a cooking channel
I din't know needed this untill now thanks again emma ily
❤️👍🏿
I think now is a good time to say "Good soup"
I Really need a forehead kiss asap
Make this soup ASAP
This video just saved me from a meltdown
11.1 subscribers congrats Emma <3
Ive been building a passion for cooking too and seeing you develop this interest aswell has been so cool.
Does Emma have a cookbook out? Cuz if not she totally needs to make one 😤😤🙌🏻
Yes emma!!!!
YESSSSS QUEEENNNNNN
Miso soup
I fucking knew it. I knew you made soup 😤😡
this felt more like a cooking show but it really mademy day though
Emma u really don't know how much your videos have helped me. I remember after having a meltdown, I watched your videos because they calm my nerves & also makes me feel warm... Ig...? Your videos somehow portray extremely genuine/raw/authentic emotions in a very artistic way, which make me feel very understood. So i'm really thankful :')))
I missed you.
emma doesnt seem okay
i wonder if you had put half of the peas into the blender, the color would have come out more green?
At some point idk why I thought it was going to be a pregnancy reveal! like it was a really weird analogy lol
I’ve been watching your old videos and forgot how much u loved u
cooking with emma in a better font
Look up Gordon Ramsey’s YouTube: How To Cook
Ok green peas for lunch today 🙃
Okay but seriously that food combo sounds like it would slap, thank you Emma 🙏
WE MISSED YOUUUU
Cooking with EmC redo’s??
Beautiful creation Emma💜
Ok Emma - reality check! COFFEE hurts your stomach!  Also, you're clearly a natural with food. But also, you have the luxury of focusing on your 3 meals a day and the preparation of those / shopping for those, more than most people, luxury of an influencer's life. Good for yoU! Hope you feel better and come back properly soon x
Wow. Never thought that this bitch right here would watch a god damn video ‘bout a woman cooking soup. Never. But u know Emma is not a normal woman, she’s THE woman who makes literally the best kind of videos. I would probably watch videos of her siting on toilet and talking 😭
i missed you sm
8:35 when you try to insert your usb key in your computer 😂
I thought that I was the only one who kinda enjoyed when their hands smelled like garlic idk but I sort of like it
i'm truly happy to see how much emma has done to improve her cooking skills, this is dope!
She has uploaded 🥳🥳
As much as I’m saying this I also hate that I’m saying this: I miss your sitcom
Emma pronounces bouillon “boy-yawn” 😂 so I’m going to pronounce it like that
I missed her a lot, but I would like to see her talking more in the video,  anyway we love u Emma thanks <3
I might make this 😚
emma we love u❤️ Ty for the video!!! Take care
i missed u bestie
so glad you're here🥲💘
I love this
Who else wants to try Emma’s food? It looks so good
EMMA this sounds crazy but will you show us how you clean your stove and stove top, oven, all of that.
I think Emma just remembered she has YT channel.
new comfort video.<3
I’d pay $17.50
i can listen to emma talk for hours her voice is oddly soothing and she can make the most boring subject so interesting
Anything Goes but 🥙video edition🥙
so proud of you. we will always be here cheering you on.
The recipe isnt showing up Emma! I think Youtube messed up some coding when they removed the dislikes lol edit: I refreshed it and the 'show more' finally showed up and I can see all the info now
Yum! Also, sounds like a great Erewhon collab: Emma's $17 soup.
Storytelling (- and cooking) on point!
I want her to be my mom haha
Emma, you dont need to cut off the ends of a potato, they actually done really have ends lmao
lol hellooooooo :))
Omg the way you’re saying bouillon
It feels weird being this early🥲
emma should so do another road trip video <3
Every day I look to see if Emma’s posted.  I’m a 55 yr old woman and her posts make my day. I just wish when I was younger I had the opportunity to voice my opinion’s and life experience’s.  Thank you Emma xxx
every time I watch your videos I realize how much we are literally the same person..to have a friend like that is just a figment of my imagination
♥️♥️♥️🥰
no, you dont understand, you don't need to do anything else while watching an emma chamberlain video, you need to focus on it and on it completely.
It’s true. I love garlic. I can’t deny it. These are just the facts.
my day is now complete
I'll watch it again and again sweetieee :')
A good substitute for onion and garlic is Hing (aka asoefetida powder)
Pea and potato soup 🍲 😋
We missed you!!!!!
why am I literally so proud of you?? like pop off chef emma!
damn i thought u were going to make it into a creamy soup like u know blended very well
i am so proud of you emma <3
Love you Emma but this video gave me major anxiety
I recommend you clean as you go so you aren't overwhelmed by the amount of things to clean afterwards! LOL I always dread the clean up when I finish eating my meal 😂
i love you emma <3
BESTIE I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!! I HOPE YOU HAD FUN IN BORA BORA!! YOU NEEDED THAT BREAK!! I RAN TO THIS VIDEO BEST TUESDAY
the.queen.is.back.<3
I was literally on your channel watching old videos of yours cuz i missed u uploading videos. I know your last one wasnt that long ago but i just love being here <3
I’m feeling nostalgic after watching this
wow it's look so good, we're proud of you emma and im so glad you posted a video today
Can you make a video with Christmas recipes?
no. 1 - how did you make making soup poetic and no.2 you need a soup maker. You just put all your ingredients in and press a button et voila. Best purchase ever
Honestly I wouldn’t even be mad if Emma made this whole channel cooking videos
YAY EMMAS BACK
I feel like I am listening to Emma’s podcast
hey you're back ilysm <3 thanku for making my day!!
emma the shallot has dirt on the outside. it's not mold, it's okay
bestie is backkk
Emma, you need to look into getting an Immersion Blender for making soups. Way easier.
I’ve missed your videos
Kind of an oriental dish i guess, Peas Tajin
Giiiiiiirllllll i missed u.
Oi, sou novo no YouTube, poderia deixar gostei em uns dos meu #shorts ? Será rapidinho
thank you for this masterpiece, Emma. we've all missed you ❤
Omg Emma we are proud of you too 🥺🤍
Chef Boyardee 🤌🏻
Thanks for the recipe! Can I substitute in chicken bouillon for the vegetable bouillon though? I have way too much chicken bouillon that I gotta use up.
it felt like i was watching an intense documentary about making this soup from scratch. not mad at it bc it was definetly a masterpiece
chef emma 😙👌
I wanna try itttt
This is like her podcast with visuals😭 love it though
her videos are fr my therapy
I miss you GIRL !!!!
I MISSED YOU EMMA
Not me eating soup while Emma cooks soup. soup sisters
Your taurus moon is showing ❤️

emma is like my personal therapist. she makes me feel so safe <//3 we love u emma
Miss you
Love you Emma ❤️❤️
I’m gonna make a soup right now but hopefully I have the ingredients because I don’t feel like going to the grocery shop
The cutoff at the end 😭🤚
Here for the second time 🤪
not me thinking the title said soap instead of soup!! i was waiting for perfectly cut soap blocks to appear the entire time
it's actually a curry in india... it's called aloo matar.. we usually eat it with roti i.e bread or you can even eat it with rice
u always make my day better love u:)
i love you emma.
can we have the recipe pls? xoxo
I think your audience is evolving into "older" as in, I'm 26 and I really enjoy your videos now, whereas "before" I felt a bit too old... I dunno, that's badly explained and I just wanted to compliment and encourage this growth, these changes and .. I'm here for it
Missed you!!
Hi EMMA!!!! I also am obsessed with cooking. A fun little hack—use the side of your chefs knife, and smash down the garlic underneath the side of the knife. This will get the skin off so easily!! Love you boo thang!! 🥰💕
I’ve waited so much for this
SLAYY
Agree Emma, cooking is weirdly fun. I mostly like trying new recipes. The same ones over and over can make me burnt out on those.
Hey Emma we have the same blender
Finally my queen is back
I missed you ❤️❤️❤️
Emma yelling “you love onion and garlic!” gives the rat from ratatouille yelling at the chef vibes
Next time, throw those peas in the blender too... that'll give you a nice green soup base.
$17??? on some soup?? i’m sure it’s lovely but … i’ve never spent more than £7 on soup in a restaurant where on earth is soup $17
You definitely looked excited tasting that first spoon... lol
i missed you❤️‍🩹
okay but I can imagine Emma as a grandma just absolutely making bomb cookies for everyone
YOUR BACK 💖💖
I MISSED U SM
It was almost like watching a crime movie and then you got everything covered up lovesit
I looove this style of cooking video but dear god…. That was a lot of peas… I hate peas lol
Emma buy edible food coloring. It will CHANGS your life.
I missed you emma <3
i live for your videos emma :)
just seeing Emma cooking makes my day
missed you <3
I am so going to make this.  Thank you.
finalyyyyyyyyyy ❤❤😍
omg i love you emm
gööd soup 👌
I SMELL A COOK BOOKCOMING...called "i dont know what i am doing"
We dont fry onion and garlic  We just boil all of them together
You should go on cooking with remi!
This video kinda scares me
Yayyy! I missed Emma and the rest of the community subs! ✨💃🎉
it looks so good!!!!
that's "bezelye yemeği" dude, u made bezelye yemeği!
A tip sent with love-if you flip your knife and use the dull edge when you want to scrape your veggies to the side on your cutting board, it keeps your blade sharp longer :) I love these cooking videos, learning from experience is the best way 💛
Getting HOW TO w/ John Wilson vibez on this channel now...I like it.
good soup 👌🏼
Loving the podcast/ video kinda thing omg
when you put the hot food into the blender, my heart!! always terrified it will explode lol
Welcome back! Happy to hang out with you again let's make soup
the best days of my life are when Emma posts these wonderful videos, i just love her so much
+codz+
8:27 I didn't know white people ate plantain lol
good soup
yay another vid :)
Literally my instincts told me Emma would post after 3 weeks. Moral of the story: trust your gut.
Girl you should’ve blended the peas!!!! It would had been green
The queen is back😍😍
Next thing you know Emma will be on Top Chef! 👩‍🍳❤️
darling post a vlog from bora bora or Maldives wherever you went too i am dying to go a virtual vacation with you againnnnnn
I'm so proud of you! The soup looks so stunning!!
What's with the scary music bro
emma!!
you did great emma :)
use a lemon to rub on your hands after you cook it takes out the garlic and onion smell
you're a chef
Hej jestem tu nowy
I hope you are seeing this emma~ idk if it’s just me but when you were talking about cooking on low heat and the food turns out more delicious after patience, I personally auto-related that to life and how when you do things fast and spontaneous, sure it’s nice, but the real beauty in experience comes from patience.  idk just a good for thought… 😌 I thought that your video is getting so artistic and meaningful❤️
You make my day, Queen. love ya
😍😍😍😍
this vid feels like listening to a podcast that has a video
why do i have a craving for for soup all of a sudden? 🤔
it would be a dream to eat a meal cooked by emma
Glad to have you backkkk!....missed you sooooo muchhhh
I honestly thought i traveled back in time or like, had a vision of the future or something idk gurl you made me think i was tripping it was scary.
I loved this flow. Resembles “how to with John Wilson”. Specifically the risotto episode. I am glad you make videos Emma. Much appreciated.
i love emma <3
Bro. Getting used to cooking on low heat!! That is definitely something I’ve had to learn 😂 especially with making pancakes, like trying to make pancakes on high heat= all burnt pancakes 💀😂
cutest shit on internet
emma i love you so much ♡♡
omg is this a video podcast cuzni fuckin love itttt
HI HELLO OH MY GOD I MISSED U SO MUCH

The lid of the grinder, it was hilarious
Omg the podcast but ✨cooking✨

Emma becomes americas next master chef 🥲
a feeling of hope and longing just washed over me, by watching a video of a person making soup!!
why does putting heat in a blender feels illegal to me?
emma chamberlain makes my day my week my month i love her💕💕
we missed you Emma .. long time (3 weeks) no see in YouTube
im going to act like i didn’t watch this already
Half expected her to say “Good Soup” at the end but ah well. Great video Emma.
you're right, I do love onion and garlic
In Manipur, India we do make this recipe
Please  the silence after the armpit talk 💀
your nails changed during the video. ....I was gonna say you have short nails and then they changed.

Emma’s my entire life
Emma really said “good soup”
a narrated video. Hey, I like it. Emma is also a great cook, as well as a great vlogger.

Bestie I'm glad to hear from you❤️❤️❤️
these vids are such a vibe
Soulmate 🦖
Making food has become my favorite hobby too. And same as you,i remember when I first realized that patience is what makes a dish from usual to amazing.I had a question to my fellow desis... Is this Emma's twist on our usual aloo mater sabji?? The whole video I was soo close to asking my mom how she makes aloo matar sabji if you call it nimona etc. It was soo interesting to watch.  I'm sure the soup was amazing, Emma.
I love herrrrr
good soup
So proud of you!!!💜
Finally I missed youuu
yesterday i told my boyfriend that you were going to post today at around 11 am to 4 pm, and when i click to see your story on insta, i saw that you posted and i was absolutely blown away and felt strongly intuitive. maybe it was just by chance, but thank you for posting today, other than “predicting” this video, i was also excited for it. <3

Was gonna dm her about the audio in previous vid but thought it was just my cheap headphones lol
The voiceover and matching video clips makes this feel like a visual podcast episode
The fact that I can watch this again and again without getting bored.
she always uploads when we need it the most
I love that she doesn’t post consistently it makes it so much more authentic just posting whenever she feels like it I love her ❤️
my day is automatically made when emma posts
I swear this was posted earlier?
I can not be the only one who rewatches Emma’s videos when she doesn’t post for a while.
i thought it was my phone omg
already watched this but u said to rewatch the new upload so im here watching again... ur power
come on emma this is two times i’ve caught you making soup now
Cool Emma back good to see you stay blessed. You save money by cooking yourself. Trail and error to get it just right.
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh my mental health was really declining but the queen makes everything better
John Wilson vibe. I like it.
