Now if this was Beyonce this would be number 1....my bitch Monica so underrated 😩😩
Bop and a whole vibe
I’m sorry 😢
I’m still here if you can see
♥️
I lyke hw she got her ppl in her video❤
It’s the Gang Gang Gang for MEEEE I’m in here practicing that part!!! Lol   I am The #SavvyBoss of SavvyByYOU Marketing & I loveeeee this shit here Monica! 80s baby verified certified!
It's really too bad that this single will go down in history as one of those overlooked Monica singles. It's 🔥 but it reminds me of Just Right for me. She had a hot rapper on the track, the single was FIRE, but the video came out much to late, and it was pushed to radio late as well. Same thing happened here. If Monica decided to release this song at the beginning of the tracking with, instead of halfway through, along with dropping the video simultaneously, this would have been her first top 10 r&b songs hit. I always am confused by any artist who isn't Drake or Beyonce releasing new music in the middle of the tracking week. Oh well, still hoping the album is fire, if it ever drops...
On some real ish lil baby made this with monica 2 different generations connected to make this hit his versus was completely relevant during 2020 and hers was completely wisdom 🙌👏
They killed it two different styles came together so well made me get chills♥♥
Monica I love this gang gang
Monica. Monica. Monica. Juzt came n sett da place on 🔥

Found me a new song!!!
Monica DOES NOT get enough credit. She has a fantastic voice, makes GREAT music, and is really a style ICON. I'm always seeing people hating on her in the comments and they always gotta mention how they think Brandy is better blah blah blah... Love them both, obviously, Brandy has more vocal ability but Monica is just a better artist and makes better music, plus sis really kills it with the outfits and on the piano. A full artist!
I LOVE THIS SONG! Ive been driving my kids crazy cause I play it so much!!🤦🏾‍♀ Been a big Monica fan since her first album( which is my Fav)
this slaps
Gang gang gang🤘🏼
I love Monica. Those shoulder pads are very distracting😂
This jawn hit different.

Fun fact Chris brown was in the video
Can sum one make a song with only lil baby’s part plz
This is 🔥👏🏽👏🏽❤️
ok if her and Cmurder dont get together if he get released Imma be mad !!!!
Monica + Megan=  It can be done💕💕
Dam didn't no this was Monica. I'm shocked she sound so different. But love this song. I thought it was a guy. Her voice sound like mint condition lead singer
I looooove this song! Monica never disappoints!
Can we take a moment to accept the fact that she's a legend in the game still knockin down doors...
🔥 💘 this
Leave it up to Monica to keep it HOOD!! She took the broad out at the end tho🤣
Just got over a million. Now let’s keep it going.  I like how Monica switched up her style on this one. I wonder what the rest of the Neptunes tracks sound like 🤔
LOVING THIS SONG! its giving me 90s-2000s Monica vibes with a new age feel. :) Fell in love with her when makings of me came out, what about ya'll??
Love this song always moinca fan
The beast song
Wow love my gurl ugh yes sis give us this in 2020 💞💞💞💞

Congrats to Monica And Happy 26th Birthday to Lil' Baby 2020!!!!!

I fucking love ❤️ it!!!
This song is fucking amazing
Monica Murdered the track
World peace 💜💜💜
Oh oh she’s back...
Thug Monica!
Ok monica ✅✅✅ I'm feeling this👍❤️
I have been a fan since she stepped on the scene at the age of 14,  she has the total package that's why I call her lil Whitney. She's a force to be reckoned with.
This song is lit!!!! But just wondering who would yall have liked seeing rapping on here instead of lil Baby
I listen to this song at least 3 times a day🔥🔥🔥 this is definitely a sleeper hit
One Million views in 1 week!!!
muah
🥰🥰🥰
I have been trying to find this song every since I heard it on the radio a month ago. Little did I know my favorite singer Ms. Harmonica aka Miss Thang was singing the hook. Lil Baby you out did yourself baby. Perfect collab you got a real one
🔥🔥🔥🤎🤎
Damn she got her brothers and stepson in the video💯❤... come thru Monica/Goonica
Terrible 😞
loving this song on repeat
Zone4 to the fullest...
Monica is such a Boss, legend,  love her❤🔥🔥🔥😍
Hopefully her upcoming album is better because this song sounds like a damn lullaby putting me to sleep!
That shirt threw me tf off...
❤️ Yes
And this is why Lil baby is my favorite rapper.
Missthang killed this..100%..
Love is what u make
Thissssssssss
Wow this is what we need something soft but still hard and heart felt
I love this
Monica is my Top Artist 💞
inlove.
We know that braided up girl was supposed to be brandy laying on that table! 😂
How I love this song .  And Monica hasn't ages one bit😍
Now what the fuck was this Monica ?
This song is as high as Monica shoulders 🔥
Song was cool, I expected more from this video tbh, since its "featuring Goonica".
Okay Monica🔥 We just waiting on the album now!
Her stylist is trash. Those shoulder pads are a no go. Monica is too attractive for that. A cropped fitted turtleneck, and some high waisted shorts would have been just fine, and decent earrings.
Letsssss goooo
Can you release Carti's version of Trenches
Monica stay sharp!!! 😍👌🏾
On heavy repeat 🔥🔥🔥 Gang Gang Gang
❤️❤️❤️ Killed IT!!!
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Yassss.Guess I can stop listening to Commitment👑😜 Love it ..ATL .in the building👑👑🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING, STILL GREATER THAN WHAT'S BEING MANUFACTURED IN THE RAP-R&B WORLD.
❤❤❤❤ this song is for me going into 2021!!
Smooth voice song Bird.
OMG THIS IS BEAUTIFUL  💜 🦋💜MONICA RNB SOUL SINGER🦋💜

The MONICA! 🙌🏽
BOOM! hit....Hit....HIT!!!
Idk how many times I watched this...this is a banger
Absolute GARBAGE 🗣🗣🗣 They stole .0000000000001% of my life and made a song about it then tried to threaten me like this is my first haunted house. Live your own life and quit stealing my style. 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Okkkkkkk then y'all go off I'm here for it
Love love love this song and now the video 🔥 too. Monica looks damn good. This song reminds me so much of a guy I was dating, you know they are good deep down...but they so busy tryna follow what everyone else doing or in his case lying over shit. Thats why it's hard as hell to date...even when you try to date folks the right way they still be on some sneaky shit. Men in general need to be more direct with how they feel about things. Speak up and out if you aint feelin someone da same no mo, instead of wasting time. Cuz I damn sholl turned down a few dudes to be real✊🏿❤💯. With him.
Love this song and looks go Kelly
I love this beat. Makes me feel like things are gonna get better.
2020!!!
Yesss 😍
Anybody else listening to this repeatedly?🥰🥰🥰
My 12 yr old he luvs this song 💪💯
😍😵GOONICA!!!
Legendary Monica with the vocals and new legend in the making  lil baby
Lil Baby tha Truth my brother.
Not Goonica...🤣🤣🤣 Monica sware shes 20. She need to leave those goons alone. That's why she has bad relationships always wanting these street boys. Grow up girl.
I love ❤️ you Monica ❣️They don’t know you for real 💯❣️

Love is what you make it I'll give you my heart if you promise that you won't break it I'mma keep it real with everyone, it ain't no fakin' I was trying to give it to you, you was trying to take it And you cannot run from reality, gotta face it I been trying to do everything for you to just make it Don't care what people say, especially when they talk crazy Don't play with me, I'm baby I'm watching in plain view, you caught up entangled In a web of the world, I wish I could save you Deep down you're an angel, but street life, it trained you Now listen to your girl Don't let the game keep playin' you Take a breather nice and slow I know it feel like they got they eyes on the skull Why you balanced on a tightrope? Tryna get the crib, you and I can go to Come and smell the roses (roses) You can have it all if you focus House, feelings flowing lovely  But first thing you gotta trust me (yeah) Baby, when the hype get cold Superficial people in your life get ghost Same ones say "I hit you right back bro" Told you there wasn't on the right tracks, so But I kinda like that though Ain't no distraction, get your sight back yo I think you wanna fight back so Let me shut up, I'm talking in circles I'm watching in plain view, you caught up entangled In a web of the world, I wish I could save you Deep down you're an angel, but street life, it trained you Now listen to your girl Don't let the game keep playin' you oh oh oh (Gang gang gang) oh oh oh (Gang gang gang) Something I adopted If they won't buss an eighth, then they flip like an omelet (flip) Environment toxic I can't breathe, haters make me nauseous, ew Get that Gucci office Get a couple outfits, bags, and the boxes (yuh) Find him in the commons, while we shine like diamonds, yeah Baby, when the hype get cold Superficial people in your life get ghost Same one say "I hit you right back bro" Told you they wasn't on the right tracks, so But I kinda like that though Ain't no distractions, get your sight back yo I think you wanna fight back so Let me shut up I'm talking in circles I'm watching in plain view, you caught up entangled In a web of the world, I wish I could save you Deep down you're an angel, but street life, it trained you Now listen to your girl Don't let the game keep playin' you oh oh oh (Gang gang gang) oh oh oh Mama told you not to go down that road Brother told me not to tell on your bros (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Sister told me never these hoes And these niggas just as bad, I'll never trust a soul I heard you been playin' with your nose You know that type of shit against the code (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) You know you was supposed to be strong You know glitter ain't gold, what the fuck is going on? Lil D' and 'em tryna get back they life, they coming home The lawyer gotta keep it above, and still be wrong (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) They came and got you fired from the pent from off his phone And it's crazy 'cause this time he ain't even do nothin' wrong Talking chills Ever since he answered the appeal, fuck a deal I go down in history being real (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Never squeal, never played the victim and I probably never will I just wish that you was here (yeah)

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Come on through Mo with That C-Murder LOOKALIKE!!! I JUST LOVE THIS AND THE LYRICS JUST GIVE ME CHILLS!!! I'm not saying you wrote this for him but if u did it's BEAUTIFUL and if you have been through some things with a man that has been through this or is going through this some women like me can relate... Some men can have an heart of an Angel But The Street life changed him... Either Way I LOVE IT BEAUTIFUL QUEEN👑😘❤💯💪🏾
This song has a very important message please listen carefully.. thank you monica 🙏🏼 and of course baby kills every feature.. LLKV
Love it ❤❤🌹
You hit hard with this one Luv
Love this song and video Monica.  Thank you for being excellent~
Monica thank u ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I need them boots ! 😍
I know my neighbor hates me. Repeat mode and singing along.
#fav artist..deadly song but you should sing a lil more @baby...
Lord Jesus  forgive me this is made me feel so good. For so many reasons. New Goonica.
#mynewanthem drop a comment for my #Monical and #lil #baby
Monica you are the REALIST baby!!! I ❤️ you! Your Spirit Your Attitude Your Everything! 🥰
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just saw this and I like it. Monica or lil baby Never disappoint!👍👍👍
Yes Queen Mo
All these so called ganstas VLS crips in jail or innocents at the wrong place at the wrong time needs to really open the mind to listen to this song  bc she’s speaking some truthful stuff the hype get cold these superficial friends will set u up LOVE don’t love nobody mo kept it 💯💯💯 in this song trenches...
O shoot 👏 I think she go get C murder when he get out, her true love....
really dope
The gang hang gang part is a no for me..
She’s definitely waiting For C murder lol
I respect Monica for lots of reasons but one is how she never let the pressures of the industry cause her to change her body. Monica is surrounded by thick women, most of her friends are thick some natural some not but that ain't the point lol. Takes a really strong and secure woman to not change anything on her body. That lady has literally had no surgery. She's also beautiful and talented. #underrated
Yesss 🔥🎶🔥🎶🔥 repeat
Okkk come  thru Monica 🖤🥰💋🔥
Nothing but Vibes 🙌🏾 it’s a Yes for me 👏🏾❤️
It’s Gang gang gang for me 🥰
Nice
anyone notice the C Murder resemblance???
When she sang this on Verzuz with Brandy.. Automatically fell in love 🥰 ❤️ 🔥
Love Monica she really about her music. She tried to make it work but also knew when to walk away in put her first! She didn’t settle that’s inspiring cause she help many of us heal from broken hearts
Yes! I had dream of her dropping fire music coming back full force then this appeared on my timeline !❤️❤️❤️❤️
Goonica LMAO 🤪
Listen I love Monica since the 90's whn she came out and stlii going strong. So anything she brings out is always 🔥🔥🔥 and lit.  The beat goes in. Mmmmm Mr. Brown should have kept his shit together he missing out on a gd thang just saying
OK ok 🔥🔥🔥
Yass slay Monica!!!
✨🔥🔥🔥💫🙏🏾
Life is back!  Keeeeeeeep going don't stop for longer than needed. I prayed for these song's to become. Thankful 🙏
Monica is THAT GIRL! 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥
Monica 👑 2020  This song is 🔥💜🎶🎶🎶🎶
This song so underrated
Is it just me but this song reminds me those car commercial on the radio.

“I’ll give you my heart if you promise that you won’t break it”🥀
ehhh, I don't like this one sis...I'm sorry still luv u Monica but gotta pass on this one.. I tried...
C-Murder maybe?
Where is  the Album ? The Released Date Came and Went and Not Still Out.
Too slow.  I’m an 80’s baby, grew up on Monica.  I need some better visuals.  Give me an uptempo waterfalls type beat and I can get with it if it has a message. A better story line would have helped this.
Lit 🔥
Don’t just like and comment BUY THE MUSIC AND STREAM IT. Add it you your playlists. Monica been a real one and her music is amazing. This legend needs to stay in this industry releasing regularly. These kids better know who the F Monica is!
Wayment!! Who TF would thumbs down this freakin MASTERPIECE! 🤔
Dope song
The AutoTune on their vocals is horrible.. A very forgettable video and song.
🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯

Yaaassss Mo🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!! 🙏💝💐😊💝

*LORD JESUS DIED & ROSE AGAIN TO FREE U FROM SIN ACCEPT HIS GIFT* ✝️✝️✝️
The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!  Good News- The Gospel  John 3:16 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.   Mark 1:14-15 14 After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. 15 “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”   Acts 4:12 12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."   Acts 2:38-42 38 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”  40 With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.”   1 Corinthians 15:2-4 2 By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.  3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,   Acts 13:39 39 Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses.   Romans 10:9 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.   1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 16 	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord   Hebrews 9:27 27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:   1Timothy 3-4 3 This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 4 who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.   Ezekiel 18:23 23“Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked,” declares the Lord GOD, “rather than that he should turn from his ways and live?     2 Corinthians 5:17-21 17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! 18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. 20 We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. 21 God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God

@brenda porter it says in the article that the hollywood celebrities use a japanese skin lightening & bleaching lotion that changes their skin color from dark skin to light skinned mixed race although they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/bleaching-skin-lightening-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml-top-selling-product i guess that they want people to think they are naturally light skinned thats why they dont admit to using this lotion to lighten their skin thats the only reason i can think of.

Switch it baby love this
Love this
Of course I like the beat since Pharrell produced it, but the hook seems a little watered down and cliché for me ,after my 2nd listen I was over it, felt this was better as an interlude rather than a song..no shade
LOL Those are all real gangstas at that table... imagine them answering a casting call lmbo!
THE GOSPEL IS THIS:   JESUS CHRIST the SON OF GOD came came to earth, he lived a life NONE of us can ever live, he never sinned, he was spotless and perfect, he lived to show us an example of how to live. He is the VISIBLE image of the invisible GOD (Colossians 1:15) JESUS CHRIST is GOD ALMIGHTY manifested in the FLESH, GOD took on flesh and bones and dwelt among us (John 1:1-14) ever since the garden when adam and eve sinned, they bought forth sin and death to the world, the world became fallen, and GOD separated himself from humanity. BUT GOD PROMISED A WAY TO RESTORE US TO HIM. he sent his SON to take our sins away, JESUS CHRIST was nailed on a cross and took your punishment upon himself, so that in him, you now can be righteous and acceptable to A HOLY AND PERFECT GOD, the wrath of GOD was poured out onto JESUS CHRIST on the cross and he died for ALL HUMANITY, that includes ALL MANKIND , he was BURIED, and in three days HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD, THATS RIGHT JESUS CHRIST ROSE FROM THE DEAD, proving all his teachings were true, the bible says in ROMANS 10:9 if you confess with your mouth the Lord JESUS, and believe in your heart that GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD, YOU WILL BE SAVED. ( from eternal separation from GOD in HELL) if you choose to not confess with your mouth the LORD JESUS CHRIST, you will one day, the bible says one day EVERY KNEE will bow before him and confess with their mouth that JESUS IS LORD to the glory of the FATHER (Philippians 2:10-11) but it will be too late. Confess NOW and turn to JESUS CHRIST NOW!!!! HE IS WAITING ON YOU!!!! HE WANTS TO GIVE YOU ETERNAL LIFE (JOHN 3:16) BUT YOU SEE FOLKS, IT IS ONLY THROUGH JESUS CHRIST WE CAN ENTER HEAVEN, NOT OUR GOOD WORKS/DEEDS, IT IS ONLY THROUGH JESUS WE CAN ENTER ETERNAL LIFE. DONT BE LIKE THE RICH MAN WHO IGNORED THE VOICE OF LAZARUS, DONT GET TO COMFORTABLE WITH THIS LIFE, BECAUSE THE POOR MAN (LAZARUS) AND THE RICH MAN BOTH DIED, THE POOR MAN WAS CARRIED INTO ETERNAL LIFE IN BLISS, BUT THE RICH MAN OPENED HIS EYES IN HELL!!!!!   1 CORINTHIANS 6:9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites.  1 CORINTHIANS 15:1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, I submit my will to yours, I place my Faith and Trust in You alone as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism.

If you want to be saved and have everlasting life, repent from your sins, believe that Jesus Christ is Lord and that He died on the cross for our sins, and was buried. Then, rose on the third day, which proved He is truly our God and Savior. John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

) Falun Gong practitioners, along with Prakash Belawadi, a noted actor, director, and activist, organized a screening of the prestigious Peabody Award-winning film Human Harvest at Bengaluru’s Suchitra Auditorium on September 16, 2018.  The 100-seat auditorium was nearly filled to capacity, and the documentary left many in the audience deeply concerned and teary-eyed.   The award-winning Canadian documentary Human Harvest was screened in Bengaluru’s Suchitra Auditorium. [Photo credit: Veeresh NTD India]  Directed by Canadian filmmaker Leon Lee, the 2014 documentary exposes one of the worst genocides in human history. The movie reveals the involvement of Chinese state-run hospitals in the harvesting and selling of organs by murdering thousands of prisoners of conscience, most of whom are Falun Gong practitioners.  The film Human Harvest is based on the investigative work of two Canadian Nobel Peace Prize nominees, David Matas, and David Kilgour. It is recognized for its compelling storytelling and documentation of how innocent prisoners of faith are used as a “live organ bank.”   The screening was followed by a panel discussion with Dr. Shirdi Prasad Tekur, Sanjiv Bhalla, and Aakar Patel and moderated by Prakash Belawadi. [Photo credit: Veeresh NTD India]  After the film, a panel discussion was held by Prakash Belawadi, a noted actor and director; Aakar Patel, Executive Director of Amnesty International; Sanjiv Bhalla, a member of the Falun Dafa Association of India; and Dr. Shirdi Prasad Tekur, a noted pediatrician.  Belawadi, the moderator, started off by saying, “I want to clarify that this is not a political film about China. This is actually about human rights abuses.”  Aakar Patel said, “I thought the film was very interesting… I think that this documentary showed things that China has a lot to answer for. But, ultimately, the source of power for change in any large society rests internally, with its people.”   Sanjiv Bhalla, a member of the Falun Dafa Association of India, and Aakar Pater, Executive Director of Amnesty International [Photo credit: Veeresh NTD India]  Dr. Shirdi Prasad noted, “Each of us has a purpose in life… Being aligned to a purpose and knowing that we are all in this together. I think that, in itself, will change our minds quite a bit, with so many people in China [being persecuted for their faith] is really also hurting us. We may not be able to do anything immediately, but we can start with ourselves.”  Sanjiv Bhalla said, “The Chinese people have no human rights, yet China is there on the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations… There is no easy solution to it… All that we’ve been doing and continue to do is to raise awareness about this… But sometimes the truth is so horrendous that people are in disbelief.”  Prakash further added that trust is built upon transparency, that he would not trust China as it is not a transparent state, and that exposure and awareness are a real weapon against the lack of transparency.  Many people asked for more information on the persecution and how they could help. Based on the response, practitioners are planning to host more screenings in the city.

For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏

Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🔻
get saved in christ right now before it's to late. just pray that you believe he died for your sins and that he is your Lord and savior then tell him to enter your life. when you say this that dead spirit in you comes alive, your born again, soul is saved from hell, name written in the book of life. after that get to know god. repent and trust in God. serve god, you will be rewarded.
🎼🔊💃🔥This song is Big facts🎼🔊💃

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17);
To whomever is reading this, I want to remind you that God loves you very much and he has a wonderful plan for your life! 😁  If you died suddenly this very moment, where do you think you would spend eternity?? If you are not sure, God wants to let you know that he loves you and he sent his Son Jesus to die for your sins that you would not perish but have eternal LIFE!  God came to me, saved me and filled me with his spirit when I was at a low point in my life a few years ago. God will do the same for you if you allow him. You have a choice, but know that YOU ARE GODS CHOICE and he will NEVER CHANGE! He wants a RELATIONSHIP with you! He loves you!  The bible says in Romans 6:23 that the  wages of Sin is death! But the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour!! Romans 10:9,13 says that WHO EVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF JESUS AND BELIEVES IN THEIR HEART AND CONFESSES WITH THEIR MOUTH THAT HE IS LORD SHALL BE SAVED!!  Im going to say a prayer for you! Lord bless my friend and their family with a long and healthy life. Lord I pray you protect them and make yourself real to them the same way you did for me in Jesus name. Friend, If you would like to receive Jesus in your heart or rededicate your life to him say this with me with your heart and your lips out loud...  Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart, forgive of all my sins, wash me and cleanse me, set me free. I believe that Jesus died for me and is coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Jesus make yourself real to me. I accept you today as my Lord and Saviour. I'm born again, all my sins are forgiven, I have a home in heaven because Jesus is in my heart!  Friend if you've said that prayer, I pray that from this day forward your life will never be the same. I tell you today that all your sins are forgiven, and always remeber dont run from God but run to him because Jesus Loves You and has a plan for your life!  If you prayed with me, plz type amen! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=900241527115892&id=100013901589755  God bless!😁  Dont believe? 👇 Checkout these testimonies  https://youtu.be/XjTvi_wjZ9U https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLDcOBdOcvB_5PWtPqeFqI6JSLCih9EH6

Not saying this is bad but I miss 90s Monica
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the Blood Atonement of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning (we should as we're thankful and build heavenly treasures), it's about having faith from the heart that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and died for ALL our sins and raised up proving who He is and that is God in human form and you're given the free Gift of eternal life. On the cross Jesus said, "It is FINISHED!" The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation from damnation, all you have to do is believe in your heart and have faith in what Christ has done for us.

God he gave his only begotten son for you he loves your smile,your Hair,your sweet gestures,your eyes,your the main thing he wants His Arms are always open waiting for you to come home but most keep running away   It’s tearing him apart inside knowing he LOVES us all so much but most don’t love him  some even hate and blame him for all the wickedness in the world even though Humans have Free Will they kill,hate,destroy  REPENT and Accept Jesus today             #christian #jesus #faith #love #god #bible  #christ #church #christianity #fairtrade #gospel #hope #blessed #jesuschrist #truth #handmade #prayer #pray #scripture #life #holyspirit #worship #peace #godisgood #inspiration #religion #bibleverse #encouragement #motivation #good-news

There’s a reasons she being nominated as the woman of soul this Sunday at the soul train awards. Miss Thang, Mo, Monica.. is the embodiment of what R&B/Soul music is supposed to be, what a shame and horrid “R&B” music that is being played on current R&B/Soul radio stations nowadays..
Monica is an incredible talent and I’ve enjoyed her since the 90’s.   SO happy to see her continuing to make hits in this era!!! 😍😍😍
👍❤🧡💛💙💚🤍💜🤎♥️

The Queen Period‼️‼️
Monica playing up to Goonica a bit too seriously. She's a whole Mom with three Kids. Monica in her 40's. Do we really think she gonna do a bid for her man. Then what type of example she giving her kids. Come on Mo no need to glorify Goonica. We in our 40's.
I don’t like the video
Gang gang gang🥰🥰🥰
She been killin the game. I remember way back in those Rowdy Records days in Atlanta. I hope God blesses you with much continued success.

Please can we just have an extended long version of this song with you just singing Monica.  You killed the heck out of this song you don’t need all these extra stuff.
I like the video even more now that I watched Monica’s countdown to its release, she explained the vision, the characters, and this video lines up to that! I guess I just wanted to see someone blatantly set someone up like in the "everything to me” video
Why I feel like Monica enjoyed hitting ole boy over the head with the bottle 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love this song...
Great job. Love the song and video
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Been rock'n whichu since way back when in 93. Dope joint rightea Miss Thang.

Fashion is so versatile and you are just right for all of us. #monicamadness #monicasangthat #shegotfashion

Goonica done came out of Jail from Commitment to go gang gang gang in the Trenches with Lil Baby. That's ride or die right there.  Love how Monica still looks out for Rocko's son and treats him like her own. Cool seeing him in the video after he helped Mo get Lil Baby on the song.
