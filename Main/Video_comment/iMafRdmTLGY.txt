what a bonus! 👏 is this the definition of BTS content? 👀
Please, i need subtittle indonesian language for i can know all video😌
Lingard is a decent option as a backup 10 for Fernandes
2:14 that’s me saying I can see him there look
I was in this
I'm very excited about our team this year 🙌  Is Manchester that cold 😂
Fred's goal?
Van de Beek definitely needs more starts. He scored more than 1 in 4 matches for Ajax and has only scored 1 in 36 at Utd. Not enough starts. We know to get those starts though that he has to impress as much as possible in the chances he does get or he will be moved on.
Thanks for this but where an earth is Fred's goal?!
Wow! That was lucky, to be there at just the right time! I think it's a bit of a pity that the Premier league has been so competitive at the top for the last few years, especially if you might be involved in a title race; it means that managers can't (or won't) take chances with some players. In United's case, with the likes of Donny and some of the younger players, it seems like he doesn't want to risk it in case they screw up and costs the team 3 points, which might be the difference between 1st and 2nd place at the end of the season. Or maybe that it would be a hit to their confidence if they get taken off after 30 minutes, or at half time. And I think it's especially critical for Ole this year, there's a lot of pressure for him to come up with some kind of silverware. I can't see him taking many risks.
Important minutes in the players' legs, especially for the likes of Martial and Sancho!
We need a world class pivot. Donny is at his best when he plays at no 10 and making those runs into the box. Bruno needs to play deeper, and I saw highlights from his previous clubs, his natural position at no 8 where he can really dominate and progress the ball forward. I think he can link up better with Pogba at that position rather than playing as a 10.
I was there 🕵🏽‍♂️. Check my Twitter for vids @subz_k
Behind the clothes door 🤣🤣🤣
How did Sancho play?
I'm applying for the job after Ole
No footage of this fred goal anywhere
Loving the hustle here, great work to all involved.
What's with the creepy music at the end?
I disagree, martial isn't unlucky, it's becoming a norm, he's getting the chances, but isn't clinical enough,
As  a massive marital fan really hope he steps up this season. Reckon it will be his last season with us unless he really turns up
Where can I watch Fred's goal?
Haha so cool Jay for you and your kids! And for us to get these highlights!
What's with the creepy end of days type tune at the end? Is it cause Fred scored again?
we're winning the league guys !
This is bs free Afghan
The fact I nearly went myself the same day 🙃🤣 Are we sure Jay isn’t secretly coaching the lads with ole
Matial and lingard with that Sancho master pass. LOL!!!
The passion for the clubs so apparent! Proper fan content
Cavani,Martial, Greenwood,Rashford and Sancho alongside Bruno -Pogba. If all of these guys perform at their best, that's easily the most balanced frontline in PL and probably top 5 in Europe. We need to win trophies now with such squad depth. No excuses.
Would do a 4-3-3.  De gea Awb Varane Maguire Shaw VDB Bruno Pogba Sancho Greenwood Martial
Donny started ❤️❤️ finally
Why would they had a game when they need to play Southampton this weekend.?? WTF man.
If you play Donny or martial, who do you replace? The team look good without them.
Marinating on a possible VdB - Sancho connection. Don’t hate the idea, would like to see it at some point.  Also, how secret was the friendly? Have we played others? Makes ya wonder on how deep Ole’s managerial rabbit hole might really go.
Did burnley start with their first team players?
Lovely surprise... thanks for the clips...
Eric Bailly played huh! I guess we won’t see him again for 12 weeks.
Want to know your thoughts on changing the position of Lindelof to defensive midfielder when Varane is playing as CB
Bush can without the bush! So just cam
What pisses me off most is when Donny gets his rare starts it’s always with our B team players. So he’s already out at a disadvantage!! How is that fair? How do u expect him to impress if he’s never allowed to line up with our real first team?
Why didn't Varane play? I thought this game would have been organised to give the late arrivals to training a game, as well as the better under 18/21/23 a run against a Premier league side for experience.
Jay carries a microphone wherever he goes confirmed
I trust Ole to decide when DvB is ready, if it doesnt happen it doesnt happen...
Stretford Paddock killing it with content.... Instagram is filled with your clips.. Planet football, F365 linking the clips, no other United fan channel can match the content here
Great video Jay.
Why was FRED'S goal not covered? 🤔
Feck!  What  month is it?  You look dressed for winter.   😀
Why is Sancho being played on the left when we have so much cover? We need him on the right wing
Sancho for Lingard was very close
Any sign of Jones
This is awesome
Clearly Martial's goal
I like that the club has managed to stop the leaks to the extent that friendlies are unheard of before kickoff, never mind the starting XI's.
Swear martial got a goal then an assist then he says “Anthony Martial was abit unlucky missed a few chances” ways to pain negativity 👀 he played well💯
Pogba × Bruno were too good against Leeds to be dropped for Donny, he should be subbed on at the hour mark or half time if we're comfortablely up. But Donny should be starting some games in the near future to prevent burn out of Pogba and Bruno.
Oles really like: Donny you can start.. but no one can know 👁👄👁
nice summer's day
We all know Ole wont play DVB and will start again with Mcfred :-(
Donnnnnnyyyyy
Donny
bought Telles, Shaw improved bought Varane, Lindelof improved buying Camavinga, Fred improves
Imagine tipping up for thr tour and seeing this it's absolutely fucking mental
No matter what time of the year it is, they always seem to wear coats and hoodies at old trafford.
INSIDE SCOOP!! Cracking Vid! 😉👍👏👏👏
Dont understand why no one is talking abt Amad, he is genuine talent, must get some minutes here n there, much better than James... Wish n hope to see him play
m telling you lingard will be something else if he'll get enoigh chance hope ole gives him chances
Go on the lads !!!
I don't get it. How can you play a friendly if the season has already started? What am I missing?
When was this ?
Lucky
Did we sign Danny welbeck on the sly and did he play?
Who’s responsible for the fire beat at the end of the video though?
Did Varane play?
anyone know what that music is at the end please??
a tour w a bonus !! match
What are the chances o that
Can’t believe this story 🔴🤣⚽️
Fred scoring as many goals in a week as he has in his entire United career. Did we bring a different Brazil back from the Copa America ?!
Why is Sancho playing on the left?
Whats the chances😂 Stretford Paddock don't miss a trick, always primed and ready with a camera
Thanks for the effort for on this video. You guys rock. Excited for the next match.
I hope ole will start rotating squad
That’s was really good. An unexpected bonus at a stadium tour.
This Man is so lucky 😂😂
SANCHO ASSIST?
Jay ( and kids ) frickin' legends. Great stuff and really interesting analysis, although it must have limited time. Nice.
Why has Martial slowed down? He used to be rapid when he first joined.
Im worried ole put sancho in this team. This is literally the team ole puts on the bench. I dont think ole will play sancho.
Anybody know what’s the music towards the end of the video? 👌
Wait was this event after our 5-1 win against Leeds?
Did Donny perform well?
Fantastic.  You couldnt have timed it better to go to Old Trafford. What a real treat for you all .
Greenwood was poor on Saturday. Great goal and a couple of good passes to Pogba, but generally not getting hold of it when he should. Touch letting him down too often.
WE WANT BUSHCAMS BACK!!
Donny's problem was that he was injured at the point were he would have had some chances to play more last year. He'll be fine and will get his chance. Everything he says points to him wanting to be here. I feel like players want to play for Ole let alone United.
Martial scored btw
Great Bush work Jay, get back n da bush 👍😎
How about you ease up on the British accent for crying out loud.
OH damm it..i never knew you could watch it
Why on earth was Maguire playing? 😂
Did Varane play any of Real’s preseason? Is he up to match fitness yet or will we need to wait a couple of weeks?
Did Martial plan that no-look, back against the ball, head-tap goal?? he still looks a bit rusty...
Kinda looked like ole was playing a 4-2-2-2
i'll take any win over the Dingles
Got to love that Ole is proactively building the teams fitness up quickly.   Clearly he realises that if we want to achieve anything this season, we need to be strong very quickly!
when was this?
how did jadon sancho perform in the friendly?
That was great, Jay, but why no weather report at the start?
Anyone got footage of Fred's goal?
You seem clueless about donny...
Still nothing on Fred's goal?
Harrrry maguire his heads fucking massive🎶🎶🎶
Looks like Sancho was out left again. Sigh
Jay acting like he didn't know 😂 yes let's go have a family day down at old Trafford... oh what a coincidence there is a game on... 😂 Great work, Jay!
Jay converted a stadium tour with the kids, to a behind closed door friendly. Jay "houdini" Motty
What day was this?
That was cool✌👍🙌
Remember me, this is August in Manchester??
Jay your so jammy, 1st Ferguson and now this. 🤩  Really nice thing for the club to do, fair play.  If it was pre-protests they probably would have charged ye a match ticket
First Fergie, now exclusive game ... what next? :)
GET IN, JAY!
just focus on the game ...you can talk without showing ur face,😅😅😅😅
Wheres the bloody weather report J
Wow!!! Great inside info. 👌
Another thrashing coming soon in the prem just you wait.
Arsenal should be doing this closed door games as they got 🔙 european football
Heard Sancho and Martial had good games. That’s music to my ears.
LOL KINGS SHHOUT OUT TO ALL THE NINJAS
Martial is awesome on the left 💯
great job joe Motty
Martial scored, not Maguire.
Fantastic work!  Perfect timing mate
I was there, met Jay and Joe and got a picture. I felt bad when i realised they were just out with family though 😬 Great to see Martial play well, Donny seemed to play in the double pivot, Dalot constantly made surging runs forward, Bailly did what Bailly does. Amazing surprise after a great weekend for United.
The biggest question is, was Phil jones playing tho ?🤔
Ha, class
What a bonus, your kids must be made up mate.
This is why Stretford Paddock is the best United channel.
When was this???
10 DS should send jay to Afghanistan now on a secret Mission.
This Young Lingard is one to watch
Christ on a bike how many months ahead are Manchester 👀 October? Bonus Content 🔴❤️
Oh that's wicked Jay. Great opportunity for you and the kids. Nice one!!! 🙌  Worth it just to see Lingard! 😁👌
How did Sancho do in the game? He didn't seem to look match ready against Leeds, hope he's got some good match time
Maguire the undroppable
Shame Varane didn’t start, not the best indication of him starting Sunday.
Was jadon on the left again, we finally buy a right winger after years and play him on the left?
I think the Utd hierarchy really rate Donny, and rightly so, but I think they were concerned about his physicality etc for the Premier league (against teams exactly like Burnley for example) so they’ve had him build on his physical size etc etc and were acclimatising him to England in his debut year. I think we’ll see much more him of him this season.
Jay your one lucky man
So we finally get a right winger, and then play him on the left????
Wait.. we're having friendlies after the season has started?
do burnely play like southampton that wouls make sense to have a game against the same type.
What’s with creepy track over the game highlights lol
Who all came off at half time?
When was this?
Not sounding good, apparently Sancho played but you guys didn’t give much info on him, eish
jesus even in the friendlies Maguire is playing
Eric doing Eric things😂
I’m kinda confused when was this?
08:02 Bloody hell imagine if Cavani's there in that chance
"Tony Martial was a bit lucky, missed a few chances..."  ...as per usual then, so damn ineffective!
I almost thought Lukaku came back
Hopefully Brandon Williams gets a decent loan move this season
3 points... We'll have that thank you very much 😂
Where's Howson
Vdb needs to control the tempo more and he will start more often. Less of his 1touch short passes
Because Stuff like this @stredfordpaddock is number one mufc fan channel
Was that music? I thought I was back on dial-up.😂
what?
Jay man 🤣🙌🏾
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
Jay grafting, even on a family day. Commitment.
Who scored the third goal???
Secret Agent Jay
This was a welcome surprise, thanks for the share.
Wow jay you lucky basterd every one is jealous of you
Hope we play Donny more
hahaha, great stuff, Jay!!
how LUCKY jay is😂😂😂
Mad that’s well cool
These behind closed door games are class
P.S. That's MARTIAL'S goal!  HE'S BACK!! 🤣
No way 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How tf has Jay managed that?? 😂😂
Cant wait for the season😩😩😩
This is basically Bush Cam without the BUSH! 😂
Nice to see the lads getting extra minutes after the preseason game was cancelled
So is this to raise the fitness level?
Can sense something special this season hopefully.
Feeling giddy for this season  can't wait.
