You’re the best
Watch closely—most people miss what happens in the background. But if you look carefully, you’ll see the moment everything changes
I’m curious what are the gun laws in that specific area. And if they continue to camp there do they carry now?  I would have to.
I KNEW IT WAS RICKY I KNEW IT WAS RICKY I KNEW IT WAS RICKY
The appalachian trail is a reflection of society over time. You're crazy if you hike that trail now because of so many murders. But years ago it was totally safe.
He is such a great story teller!
This story was masterfully told! I completely thought the campers would be the villains.
Y 17:42 Jeffery Dhammer VIBES ❤❤❤
The way he told the story, and joined the Events together.. this is novely/movie-like narrating🤌👑 10/10 from me
No you don’t use gasoline you use dry beans so it grows out with possible injury to someone
Found your Channel today and um hooked. Love love how you narrate these stories💐
Arm and hand waving makes his videos unwatchable
Yawn
So many ads.....
I took a woman kayaking on a secluded pond/small lake. Within two min of being on the water she breaks out a blue tooth speaker, asked what I wanted to hear.  Peace and quiet. She laughed. I said good luck no service here. She had music saved on her phone. That was an annoying afternoon
I can't stop laughing MrBallen using his hands when he talks so funny😂
Don’t ever play music while camping, Randall is watching
What a turn of events 😅
54 is old and frail? 🐂💩!
Incredibly brave and strong men!
Any Indian
Shout out to Ricky Williams for winning the heisman trophy
Mr Ballen's storytelling always pulls me. I was on a scary story compilation, but this story made me come here.
I love your work and stories
14:00 Wow, someone actually told the police important evidence right away and the police actually looked into it, right away…lol
Why are you bowing so much in all your intros? 😂 every couple words
I went camping by myself once and had another guy come over and asked if I wanted to come to his camp and have some drinks, do a little partying, dancing and have some wild sex I said sure how many people are going to be there. He said just me and you.
Bro I like your videos ❤
15 years for double homicide? 🧐
Hi Mr. Baller I listen to the run fool intro, to me it ( my opinion) he doesn’t sound real, more like a computer. However, love your stories 💕
Do you know how to get to bells canyon?
Does this guy really have to use his hands so much??
Ricky gonna steal 2nd base
Mr Ballen, our house loves you but hearing the pronunciation “Appa LAY SHUN” is hurting us
I was  so in to you till you broke it...😢
I’m pretty sure your thumbnail pic is Tony Sopranos drivers license when he was 16 years old 😂
Always love your stories man I hope your doing great and great work
I feel like I’m listening to my gf tell me about her day. I’m stressed I gotta go
I’ve heard this story but from the other side and Shawn should have clubbed him 😂
Never answer your door. Go to an upstairs window to see who is there.
Shawn must be a good friend. When he got shot, Scott straight up ditched him and Shawn still stopped his truck to help Scott even after he abandoned him
What happened to the dog?
Whats that thumbnail supposed to mean😂 I bring my banjo to any camping trip I go😂
24:34 dannnngggggg
How can you tell the  story from the killers perspective i witch the „killer“ is afraid at one moment alone in the forest because of the killing that Happen a few years ago ?  Love your chanel and check it out daily but that story was ass 😅
anytime theres a dog in the story, i have to skip it.  I cant take the chance.
How does a mentally unstable guy who murderer 2 people not stay in prison for the rest of their lives? Makes no sense to me
He tells us very specifically how to like the video 😂
I'd like to know what round this pistol was chambered in. Not to many rounds are that forgiving.
Appa-la-chin not appa-lay-shen
"listening to music in the forest is disrespectful" HAHAHAHAHA please tell me you're kidding
If Smith had been put to death in 1981 then there wouldn't have been anymore victims. Why do we keep trying to rehabilitate cold-blooded murderers?
Mad intro bro i’ma go to bad
💯💯👌
The "Run Fool" voice over guy is just ok.  I prefer Mr. Ballen for this genre.  😊
Brilliant, just brilliant to let the guy out of prison. I'm all for second chances, but some people are violent and we need to have more concern and empathy for the potential victims of violent crime.
Sounds like dude was gatekeep nature. Why tf can you listen to a little music while you camp.
You're the best Mr Ballen.
Great clip...as always   If planning a weekend or getaway   Definitely.....Food for thought
Love your videos, man, but you got to make some new stuff, bro I go to some of your podcast even and it’s a repeat. The videos are on every channel even different ones the same story.  It used to not be like that. Don’t know if you know about it or not just giving you a heads up because I’ve stopped watching as many videos now because I’ve seen them.
This is not just a story, it feels like an experience.
Appa-LATCH-an  I live only 30 miles from dismal creek 😳
I watched this whole story but heard nothing about banjos 😂
Anyone who releases murderers should be held accountable for all the subsequent crimes committed by that murderer!
This is exactly why serial killers should never be let out of prison!!!
I’ve said it before you have a natural  talent for telling stories many times have I been entertained by you  thank you my friend aloha from the westside of Oahu Wai’anae 96793 🤙🏽 my friend aloha and much respect!! to you great story as I said before you have a natural talent love your stories are you the guy who does the smoke pit stories ? Love those stories too thank you my friend much aloha and respect to you!! 🤙🏽
bro 😎 really said "Im not dying today"
Shouldn’t the code of helping anyone you come across be universal?
you should consider putting the "real photo" text in green and the "fake photo" text in red, so we can just use peripherals, and stay focused on photo. just a suggestion
A most intriguing story. Thank you for sharing it. Stay safe out there.  🏕️ .😊
If Ricky had run out of food and hadn't caught any food why did he stay instead of going home and what was he dog eating?
Yes 💯 we work out lives away for a living and they get a living give to them fuck that shit america and it's people need to come first
That man talking to Margret has to be the most emotionally unintelligent person I’ve ever seen   “ you have to be mad “    Just … wow
I've watched enough mr Ballen now to not be surprised by these twists anymore. 😅  The more Ballen tries to make someone look frail and innocent, the more you can bet it's the killer lol. He even stressed early on how this was an old man who was losing weight and was therefore not a threat to anyone. He also put emphasis on him being uncomfortable and nervous around the two guys (who would end up being his victims). All this is to setup the twist but there's a point where it becomes too obvious.
Well that was a shocker!
Can anyone tell me what the music is that plays at the beginning?
When young I lived in CA. When old, I lived in the East. I hiked and camped only with one friend in Pacific. It seems if I was by myself I would be carrying a 1911 auto loader with several clips plus a tomahawk and K- Bar and my dog. Too many nut cases in the East trails these days. Carry lots of canned dog food, tuna and bacon for the trail. Let people know your plans. 😁
Why do you have to put "not a real photo from the campsite" it's a photo of fish being cooked😅 I have no idea how that can incriminate or pose any threat to the channel. Seems strange to me.
What happened to the dog??
How could the justice system just let this murderer out on "good behavior"??  He murdered two people, for god sakes!!   I don't care if he becomes the reincarnation of the Dali Lama.  This freak murdered two people out in the woods and tried to do it again!  WTF!!!
That's really fucked up the way u told the story very misleading and flat out lies I know what u were going for but it would of been better telling the story from the victims perspective and it would of actually made sense 😅
Double murder, 15 years???? wtf!!!
I love how he tells the story, you never know what you're going to get, who's going to be guilty. It isn't obvious lol
Crazy twist 😮
I'm sure this guy had more victims, it was probably his thing that deranged serial killers have, he would act like an innocent guy and then find a pair of two people that will be nice to him and let him in and then kill them both and dispose of the bodies, I'm sure those spots circled on the map were his spots to sit and wait for hikers
WOW. DUDE. You just told people to go start an arson fire. Are you sick???????? The way I heard it, many others heard it too....
Sorry but who goes out camping, let alone camping without food, without a knife.
Stop releasing murderers out of prison. Every murderer shouldn’t even be alive anymore. None of them. What would it hurt in this world to put all murderers 6 feet deep. It would hurt no one and save many and keep this world a little better. Gonna release murderers on good behavior lol smh man. That’s just diabolical
So.. Ricky seems like a closeted Karen
If there was ever proof to not allow parole for murders.
Sean’s instincts were correct.
no good deed goes unpunished
Jesus that story went sideways fast, glad the 2 good men lived and evil was gone
Did the police ever find where those kid clothes came from?
The only mental illness in this story is letting a murderer of two peoples walk away only to try it again
That poor "like button!"
Guys Im from germany, if I ever decide to go to the apalachians with my wife, should I invest in some license for a gun? Or shouldn’t I go there at all? Whats your guys experience?
“Let’s let a dangerous murderer out of jail on parole, what could go wrong.  Oh no, he did it again???” -The State
I bet they go armed now.
Murders should never be set free. Ever!
I CANT BELIEVE I PREDICTED THIS RIGHT. IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF
America has the best legal system.
Mr. ballen is the last person I listen to every night before going to sleep.  The way he tells the story takes u into the story and u can actually see everything happening right before ur eyes.
What I love about your videos is the narrative and the delivery 👍
Man Sean is an absolute unit
When you get below the Mason Dixon line, it’s pronounced APPA LAT  CHUN, not that weak APPA LAY SHUN 💩…
This is fucking INSANE
Very happy Randal passed away.  What a complete scum.  Hope it hurt bad.
Wow a murderer killed again after being set free I’m sooooo suprised
How the hell does a person who has murdered _TWO_ people get paroled after 15 years?!
Damon Salvatore
Two women - 'one made their way.'  Now why call ONE WOMAN 'they'?  Seriously, the public school system in the US needs to defunded and abolished.
"He meagerly asked, 'Can I help?'" MEAGERLY ASKED?  Dude, that public school education reverse engineered your literacy.  Go look up 'meager.'  It doesn't mean 'meek.'
Do you know the way to the bells canyon?
Really good twist!
NOT a real photo of Ricky fishing
As soon as I hear "Appalachia", I know the story is about to be fcked up lol
you can't break up the stories like that. This is "desire for like gone wrong." Lame
0:17 what is that? Why he keep saying these weird random stuff in each video? i don't get it
That "code" is worldwide universal, for decent human beings??????
Cool story! And u are telling it like you were there 😂❤
Never trust a man who talks too much in the woods
To think that Sean and Scott made a full recovery and still continue to go back to the same location really shows their passion for nature and camping.
There is something about Appalachian mountains. It used to be part of the mountain range in the middle of Pangea, called, Central Pangean Mountains. The mountain itself is an extremely old volcano that separated Pangea. If we get any weird creepy stories, Appalachia has to be one of the places on this planet.
Women's underwear?😂😂😂
The fact that Sean and Scott forgave Ricky for what he did to them says everything about them. I’m glad they survived that. ❤❤
Should be the way it is everywhere! People looking to help each other!
One evening, a few teenagers dug up and replanted the flowers in the public library’s garden to spell out a naughty word.
What i don't like about these videos is that there are lots of ads
Was this the inspiration of the movie A Perfect Getaway
Don't trust anyone alone in the woods. That's what I take from this.
This happened in my home town. Randall lived 30 min from me and he was in the NRV jail where he died which is 15 min from me. So crazy when you hear and see pictures of where you live on YouTube especially this story.
Double homicide to be released back to society. What the actual fuck!!! 0
This story is great .. what a twist👍🙌
❤
This was a horrifying story, but the way you told the story from ricky's perspective made it scarier. Peak content.
While telling the story, why did you say that Ricky had heard about the nearby murder and was scared?
"Run Fool" - People Under the Stairs reference....
🕯 Thought it was just a normal camping trip? Until you realize… you invited a killer to dinner.  This story isn’t just creepy — it’s true. And trust me, Dismal Creek hides more than just shadows.  🎧 On this channel, we tell real horror stories — about survival, instincts, and the people you never want to meet.  🩸 Come take a look. Sometimes the scariest thing... is the kindness you gave to the wrong person.
This was a movie
What about the dog?????
Great ep bro there are sum sick people out there I've been single for years fell alone but I could never hurt anyone I'm not even sure I could kill in a kill or be killed situation
In western Virginia or West Virginia?
That guy who survived with a bullet to the head and chest is an absolute unit of a man.
Thanks God they survived
Wow from the beginning you could think that Shawn and Scott's were the criminals
I feel like he should be eating a soda biscuit and sipping a ginger ale.
What happend to the dog?
The only videos I actually click like, because of the effort mrballen puts into telling me to
Another masterclass in suspenseful storytelling. The moment you described the police finding the birth certificate, I got goosebumps. It's terrifying how a simple act of kindness on the trail could lead to something so horrific. Definitely makes you think twice about who you meet out in the wilderness.
I was listening to popularmmos until this started to play. Strange algorithm I have, lol
There havw been a couple of murders on the area... Perfect time to go fishing
I was born and grew up in Roanoke, VA.  One of my boyfriend's sisters was killed on the Appalachian Parkway. They never found who killer her.  Just wondering
What IS that mist you have drifting behind you? The sound effects are perfect
Good
I think I saw this on a true crime show, on ID channel while ago…
Run Fool is the worst Ballen studios podcast it’s a bunch of race baiting nonsense!! I love all the Ballen stuff except Run Fool it’s terrible!
Thank God Scott and Sean survived. What a scary thing to live thru
Love!
A surprise ending. You never mentioned what became of Randall's dog, was he in the car that went over the cliff ?
So Ricky was acting like a victim? Meanwhile he was the suspect the whole time?😂😂😂
Ballin 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤ yes we Ballin today brother 😂😂😂❤❤
you're the best at this :)
I’m pretty sure this story was told on the show ‘I survived’ by the survivors. Worth a watch
So, you’re an older guy, running out of food… how about stop camping and leave? 🙄
No good deed goes unpunished
I remember the incident in 1981. Dismal isn’t far from where I live. I have been there a couple times. Thank you for sharing this story in such an interesting way. It was very creepy to learn that Randall Smith was out and had struck again. I have the book that was written about the first incident “ Murder On The Appalachian Trail”.
They have changed the trail since the 1970s because of murders. Don’t stop for trail junkies.
Um... so what happened with the dog?
This is why I have trust issues
This is why everyone going into the deep forests in the US should be ARMED.
Omg I think I know the twist 😁😁
Watching this right before going camping😭😭
Hope Sean and Scott are doing good now and are happy and healthy🙏🏻❤️. God bless him and may Randall rot in hell
If Randall was any other race, the narrative would’ve been totally different and so would his sentence.
Good behavior in prison is different than good behavior out in population.  NOPE  !!  Do Not let them out !! 😮
15 ads. what the hell! D:
mr ballen vs mr nightmare
The story isn't funny, but the way Mr. Ballin describes Ricky as a kind-hearted person who likes to pray and meditate in nature and really sell it to us, knowing he's got a hell of a Uno reverse term of Ricky's character is kind of hilarious😂
Did not see that coming!
You constantly contradict yourself in every story I've heard you try to tell. It's annoying.
Keep up your amazing work
And this is why the death penalty exists...
Scared of the camping spot THAT HE CHOSE TO CAMP AT 😂😂😂 Simple question - after camping a weeks and knowing your food is dwindling, why not JUST LEAVE 🤔
Don’t judge a book by it’s cover comes to mind.
No lack of stories for around the campfire!❤
Horrible.
I think I lived in FL then. I do recall a story, but not the details.
Sean and Scott seem like such homies I would love to hang out with them
Its more like dismal swamp
Please no ads in the middle
Hi
I’m a guy who loves camping,and I ALWAYS take 8 pairs of glasses…a police scanner and PLENTY of women’s underwear with me when I camp. As the Boy Scouts say…”Be Prepared.”
Anyone else wonder what happened to his dog? Another innocent involved in that psychos wrath
I needed to listen like 3 times to understand this lol
Im very civil and very respectful
I think it’s a stretch to say a convicted murderer is ever capable of good behavior. Not murdering in jail is easy.
This story was absolutely bone-chilling! 🌲😨 It’s wild how something as peaceful as camping can turn into pure nightmare fuel. These kinds of tales remind us to stay alert, trust our instincts, and never ignore the signs around us. Keep up the amazing storytelling—it keeps our imaginations alive and our senses sharp!" 🔥🎒👻
What a plot twist Mr Ballen
The guys voice at the end is unlistenable for me.
What happened to the dog???
damn man. you are an EXCELLENT story teller, for real. hats off to you!
It’s crazy that you can be paroled after a murder conviction
I've always had a fear of the forest at night and a fear of the unknown, and watching videos like these is like my own little personal poison, it terrifies me and creeps me out, but it's so enticing, I can't explain why
tomorrow I'm gonna dress up in a tuna fish costume and my friends are gonna use me as bait to catch the krakken.  My mom says I shouldn't go krakken fishing but I'm gonna listen to judas priest breakin the law and go krakken fishing anyway without my fishing license. wish me luck.
Those encircled places in the maps are probably where he found those items. He probably collected it just incase someone tries to look for it then boom he will shot at them.
Im always screaming "Run, Fool!" while watching horror films. 🤦🏾‍♀ Genius title for a podcast like that.
"had come off" not "had came off"
Thanks.
Damn that plot twist
you mentioned that sean had been shouting so many times in the face and at the end rikky shout him in the heart. how after all of that he is still alive?
Thought camping was all about relaxation and finding yourself… Only to realize: I’d become someone else’s nightmare all along.  Who would have guessed the weakest soul held the bloodthirstiest demon within?
I love your stories but this one, i feel like you tried too hard to create scenarios that are either not realistic or don't  belong to the story.
Bro. Someone is going to set their neighbors house on fire and sue you. You need to put a disclaimer saying it was a joke. lol. You know people these days bro.
I saw a show called “Dead Silent” and this story was an episode, so I knew immediately where this was going. Man, what a crazy story.
So thankful they survived ❤❤
Need more people like them in this world.
Too long and drawn out
I feel the guys blasting loud music was enough to trigger Randall to shoot at the guys. That was the disrespect.
so that intro...you want me to go commit arson just because my neighbor wont turn his music down at 2:30 IN THE MORNINGGGG   ok.
Listening at 3:30 in the morning. Can’t sleep 😅
Does anybody know of another with similar stories that are told as good? I've been looking after I caught up on all of Mr. Ballers stories and I can't find any as good!
Crazy old man
Why aren’t you in the same shirt? Very confusing. It makes me think I’m not listening to the story I want.  Lol
Not sure why it took me so long to find this... Bit that intro about the neighbors sounded personal, ngl.😂
I look forward to what new thing you have for the like button LOL
Ok this is the craziest story I have ever heard 😭
Love the channel. But the vocal fry is something else.
21:29 looks like William Afton from the Five Nights at Freddy’s movie. I don’t know why, but that’s the first thought that came to my mind…
Bring back the death penalty.
I’m sorry but Hamilia always takes over with Ali she needs to let the parents be parents with all due respect it’s your grandson not your son. Let  Samia and Omid chose what’s best for little Ali☺️☺️

The comments give away the whole story
Wow, I did not expect a twist.
Love the backgrounds😊
jon...dude.... absolutely dropped the ball by not telling us the fate of the dog here.
Soooo cute, Mr. Ballen
I took your advice and 🔥 my neighbours yard, now they are mad.
The way he tells stories is so confusing sometimes lol
That was a great plot twist
I saw the movie she didn’t deserve it
Been hunting for over 30 years one of the craziest things I experienced was a man running into our camp screaming in the middle of the night he was completely naked he screamed for about 30 seconds then ran off into the forest! We hiked back to the truck and let the local police know what we saw they kept saying it was probably a guy pranking us. That was 25 years ago in Grass Valley Ca to this day it still bothers me.
15 years for double homicide and an attempt at another double homicide , sounds like American justice 😅
I wonder what happened to Randall's dog, I hope he was okay.
That must an amazing fishing hole
Okay but what happened to his dog? 😭
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢❤😢😢❤😢❤😢❤😢😢❤😢❤😢❤😢😢❤😢❤😢😢❤
Run,Fool is just too Audio Book-y for me
Only recently started watching this channel, and I love that the stories are unique or rare and not ones I've heard covered on other channels. I only wish we could see some of the photos from the case files! (though I do love the captions on each of the 'non-crime scene photos lol)
I did not expect the sudden turn
Awesome story got right into it.
These videos are really comforting me in the idea that camping is NOT for me
Sanpaku eyes
Am I the only one thinking "poor like button"? Lol
10/10 story telling
there should NOT be an early release option called "good behavior" because they got in that prison by doing something HORRIBLE
For further reference it’s a hard CH not a SH
Wt
Wow
this story should be made into a movie
Crazy idea, don't release murders or violent criminals back into society...
STOP PAROLING MURDERERS AND PDFs!!!!!!!!!!
Your other stories, are they true experiences?
Wow!!! What a story!
Last time i was on a 30 day camping trip in the woods my little FM radio was awesome.
What 😭 Ricky did it?! Oml.. that poor dog
Good job!!!!
So this story is basically: “Wait a minute… I know what’s going on here, I’M the murderer!” *shoots them*
man why are you caping telling the story in that way 😡 like wtf and  blud said explosion
He was not mentally ill,  HE WAS EVIL.  I Blame the parole board, damn idiots
Now that’s my kind of happy ending 😊
54 and frail? Im older then that and not frail.
My late husband and I with some friends camped and trout fished on Dismal Creek in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Beautiful area.
Probably he nicked the clothes from washing lines and did the map knowing he would probably die in his camp sooner or later and  that way he maybe thought the police would believe he had killed a lot more than he did.
I FEEL LIKE IF U R CHARGED WITH A VIOLENT CRIME ... U R NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE "GOOD TIME" OR "GOOD BEHAVIOR" CREDITS AGAINST UR SENTENCING!!!!
I've  never owed anything to the United States Government anything and don't intend on owing for anything cause I was raised to pay cash and nothing but hard earned cash for every single thing that's needed to survive..I'm pretty sure if I can't afford anything, I don't need it and if I did need it. I should have kept saving up to be able to afford and keep whatever I wanted..Rent a center and rentals is selling used items for double. Always do same as cash deals or go to a store with brand new stuff so you have a warranty and it's yours. Government loans will catch up sooner than later especially when no schooling has been posted by the institutions that's supposed to have been attended..
Double homicide and got 15 years... gotta love that privilege
So, the ladies live so "remotely" that emergency services got there in no time?
Randall sure looks a lot like Albert Fish.
Did you ever use elwctricity. 🙃
Great story
Me trying to avoid wome comments so they don't spoil the story for me😂😂 this guys narriation is like watching a movie, been listening to u for years brother keep up the great work.
I can only hope the dog made it out unharmed !
I like how those two men went back to that place and faced that horrific incident. I really respect that a lot. I don't know why but it feels like it was a lot bigger deal to the the first time they went back. Then any of us could ever know
I wonder what happened to the dog? 😢
Tbis is a WOW story!! Muchas gracias, eres inigualable 👍
The fact that they survived is nothing short of a god damn miracle. The fact BOTH managed to get up and escape despite grievous wounds. Not just that, but they fucking got up and drove and "self rescued"?  Insane. I know it's cliche, but man I'd love to share a beer with those guys and listen to their stories.
If you are in the woods, and you hear banjo music, immediately add harmony with your bear Gun. Music has a way of overcoming strife.
Got the vibe he was a killer when he found the two other guys was desperate but wouldn’t ask to come into society just for food. He was afraid of the other guys because he knew based off himself that there’s killers and if they realized who he was he could be attacked. He also knew they saw his face and would 100% realize who he was and tell authorities. Just like what happened after they got shot.
I love the stories but I wish y'all would time the commercials better
Just got out of prison for serving time for setting someones yard on fire
Wow... this story truly sent chills down my spine. It wasn’t just ordinary creepiness — it was that lingering sense of helplessness and anxiety with every detail. The slow, skillful storytelling made me feel like I was right there in the forest, hearing every whisper of the wind, every unfamiliar footstep in the dark. This was a story that's not just scary but deeply haunting... Thank you for sharing it; I’ll remember this feeling for a long time!
I like Mr Ballen 🐈

i have fuund
As soon as the weird chants in the tape were mentioned, I figured that Ricky would be the murderer.  Even before that I wondered about it, since him being the wounded man at the door would be too obvious and you probably would’ve said it was him if it was.   But the tape part removed all doubt.
Imagine what "Ricky" would have done if they had played, instead of country, some electro-latin sounds.
Hands down one of the best thrillers I’ve ever come across. Every word served a purpose. Incredible!”
booohoo boring
They straight selling fake pops.  They got caught and now are scrambling.  I forsee a bankruptcy filing and closed doors.  Bunch of people have said pops and will get screwed and unfortunately they’ll try and recoup some money by passing on  these fakes.  Glad I jumped the Funko ship.
You (for some reason) never fail to make me laugh, because your so animated it makes me laugh 😂
It kills me when the story teller keeps mispronouncing "Appalachian" I grew up there.  🙄
It's crazy that they can make us feel like those two guys were suspicious, but when you see everyone's photos, they just look like the nicest guys. Looks can be deceiving, but in this case, it's the excellent writing.
So much hand movement on every point made. It is very distracting.
Do you make these stories up?
Wow, you are so good with your retro horror stories. Keep up the good work 😃
_There are some seriously BAD people in this world. Anyone brave enough and over 21 years old should look up about human sex dolls. 🫢🫢🫢 We should be thankful if we've never had to encounter these types of people. 😜😜😜😜 Watching this in Spring of 2025 and planning a camping trip too by the way._
„deboning the fish“ really? We grill them with bones 🤷🏻‍♀️
i started watching you when i was 13 iam now 17 i remember the time you told a story about a trip your took with your friends and u seen a ghost phase thru him
18:24 for crying out loud dude! Stop dragging it out. My memory isn't that bad that I can't remember what you just told me. You're getting painful to listen to.
Those knives were likely trophies. His crimes happened over several decades and evidence would have been hard, if not impossible to find
🪕"You sure do gotta purrrty mouth.."🐽
24:40 Well, I supposed they de-nuttered the area, so it'd be safer there than most other places up those mountains, which havent had their nutter quotas reset recently...
This was on investigative ID. The 2 guys gave their takee on it.
Murderers should not get a second chance…
9:16 … yeah the look Ricky noticed from Sean & Scott that made him think that they might think he’s weird, is almost certainly what they were thinking.   If I had met Ricky there or any person on a hiking/camping trip, & within a few hours of meeting this person was saying stuff like he liked it out here so much that it’s like a religious experience. Also adding that he sometimes meditates, prays & chants in the woods. I would 100% be thinking that this dude is a little strange.   If all he had said was something to the affect of “I love it out here so much that it’s almost like a religion for me or a religious experience”. I could accept that & simply think that this guy is one of those people that just loves being in nature. But prayers & chants? That’s an immediate strange label in my brain
“Real photo of different trout” lmao 😂
A tack...a tack man!!! Lol
I always enjoy listening to Mr.Ballen's attention 2 detail for the naritive! He is an awesome spokesperson,very astutely sharp as a taco...as always!!! Thank you!!
I'm so proud to have been the 1st 500 subscriber's of mrballen
One time I was hiking on a trail right by the AT (yonah mtn), we watched the sundown on top since it was a short hike back and we could use our flashlight to navigate.  Almost at the bottom, this creepy dude came running behind us and was laughing in a manic/ creepy way, we thought it was funny after he passed us and didn’t think much of it.  10 minutes later we finished the hike and there were like 4 cop cars at the end with their lights on. 🤷‍♂️   I was also on a shit ton of L$D
Ricky was a young boy, he had a heart of stone...
Randall Lee Smith is actually Tony Soprano and these were his first hits
Jesus is lord. Your demonic add exposes yourself.
She’s the sweetest lil thing! Really enjoying the kids growing up, so happy you had the last 2 to make. It complete.
I remember Hearing this story i watched a show that covered this story crazy but I'm glad they got away and made it
Never parole a cold blooded killer.
I'm like Ricky I love nature and I'm gypsy
i scar
Thank God Sean and Scott survived!...
Did the poor dog die in the wreck or what?
Crazy how they survived the encounter but the suspect dies from a crash fleeing the scene
Does nobody learn from Deliverance
Well damn, that took me for a turn. I thought they were gonna murder Randall. 😂
Great story but you sure set us up.
Randall should of never have been let out jail Mental ill
What happened to the dog?
"(NOT A REAL PHOTO OF RICKY'S FISHING LINE)"
Brother that's arson!😂
This story actually happened in Virginia; and it was an episode on the ID channel.
I know of a Dismal River in Grundy, Virginia. Would this be the same one ?
Lesson: Trust no one.
I just had a feeling Ricky was the killer
So Ricky was so in-tune with nature that he took on a predator role of killing trespassers..... 😅
I still don't understand why are serial killers are obsessed with knives
I had a feeling ricky was the protagonist in this story
Wow glad those guys survived😮😮
Thanks ballin for letting me catch arson charge 😁
Scary. 😱
Alright I did but now the cops are outside……what do I do next?
NOT A REAL PPHOTO OF RICKY'S FISHING LINE 😂
I’m addicted!!
Curious here, Where did Randall Lee Smith get the firearm?
Make Asylums Great Again!!!❤🇺🇸🙌
You have a perfect radio face. While I unde3stand why you would promote and say the run fools! Guy has an amazing and anooth radio voice, that really is not the case. I would listen to it, but his voice is nasally and is sort of off putting. I mean absolutely no offense, his voice just ruins it for me. And while I imagine you're a great person to work for, and that you back your people no matter what I am fairly certain that im not the only one that feels this way. The reason mrballen brand does so well can be attributed to you specifically. Not to be a dick rider but your voice is so soothing, the way you tell the story, plus much more is honestly probably 85% of your success. You could be putting up videos about the most boring stuff and im sure there would still be a number of people listening because of how well you do what you do. If you did run fool, itd probablybe much more popular. Imo  I wish that show the best
You should do a story on "the Cora tree" in North Carolina- I checked, but you don't have one.
You know I really love your videos you're great. Really do like your company
The problem with Run Fool is that it doesn’t feature Mr. Ballen, the greatest story teller in the history of YT.
I don’t think Mr. Ballen understands that we love him as a storyteller.. and only him 😂
Im not sure if i missed it but what happend to Randall's dog?
22:07 "NO ONE KNOWS WHY HE KILLED THOSE HIKERS " ????   CMOM MR BALLEN ...YOUR THE BEST IN THE BIZZ. HE KILLED THEM CAUSE HE WAS A NUT BOTTOM LINE.
Ricky Williams????? Former Longhorns running back!!!!
Goddang it Ricky!!!!
He conjured up a demon or demons that took control of him!
Gotta check the dates after that April fools one
The moment John said that there was a radio playing chanting noises. My mind went, "Ricky, oh Ricky/Randall, is that you?"
TMI
This is just me thinking here. Maybe all those found belongings whose DNA didn’t match any victims were stolen by the guy from people who had been camping—people he spent time with—and after "evaluating" them, he didn’t kill them because he believed they weren’t disrespecting the place. But he still kept the belongings he stole from them, like some kind of memento/trophy. And the two men in this story weren’t spared because, for that sick bastard, their loud music was a sign of disrespect to the place and, therefore, they deserved to die. Again, this is just me thinking here. As Ballen said: "We will never know."
Story telling is improved like fine
What happened to the dog?
I thought that Ricky was the one who was gonna get killed by them-
Saw this story on I Survived.
Bro that was a hell of a plot twist I had to rewind it like four times to understand 😂
I've never done this before.   You had 199k likes when I kicked the Like Button up side the head.   Then it flipped to 200k likes 😂.   I must have really kicked the Like out of that ole boy.   He jumped up afterwards and said, "which one of you kicked me"???? 😂😂😂
I live right near dismal swamp park. Never heard of this story, but there’s plenty of other creepy ones about this area.
I've got 2500 mi  on the Appalachian trail 1200 in one stretch. The trail is awesome
That is scary... Frail old man in trail. 🤔 Old men don't usually go long without food before going home. Something about this guy's history, maybe something about his camp tells you enough. I've met good people who've done bad things, but who are inherently good... This guy isn't inherently good, he's apparently bad and disconnected in some way. Maybe Scott missed some cues in this guy's personality and appearance, the eyes usually tell you what type of person you're dealing with everyday.
I will never understand releasing violent. Criminals back into so very because of "good behavior" as if they can't pretend to have good behavior just so they can be released and cause more harm...
No matter how good your behavior is when your in prison for murder, I don't think that's a reason to release them to do that same thing again, eventually...or like Randall over and over again not even being noticed until that horrible incident happened, WOW 😮 hopefully this is entertainment purposes 🤔
5.9 Million Views! Go Mr Ballen!
There’s a reason the forest feels different at night. It remembers things… and it doesn’t like strangers. 🌌🦉🩸
i PAY for the product, & the price just nearly DOUBLED, from $45 EACH (2 wks,IF it makes it that long, as they often fail before the 14 days.), to $80 EACH.
Gosh the way you told this story was horrid.
Whose clothes and belongings were in the tent? They didn't check that out? That dudes eyes look empty.
Criminals always return to the scene of the crime. Moral: stay away from past crime scenes.
Whose clothes amd belongings were in the tent? They didn't check that out? That dudes eyes look empty.
The Woods.
How about they are just evil!?? Whenever it's a certain group of people. It's always  mental issues. SMH, the history of mentioned group.  Is evil.
The fact that someone had the audacity to kill someone who helped them is actually the worst thing ever. Such disrespect.
im just gonna say it, Sean is a fucking Tank. He took a shot to the Head and the Chest and saved both his and his friends lives
This story is so weird and scary, I can't imagine going through a similar situation that's why I don't like hiking or camping, you never know what kind of people you're going to bump into!.. 💯👀👀👀 living in such an isolated place, nope not for me and I love nature so it's infuriate... Mr Ballen never seems to disappoint, great story man keep up the amazing work and story telling skills is 🔥❣️💯😎😎😎😎😎
I was thinking what a great story teller you are!  Whatever happened to the dog? Thanks for a great conveyance of this story.
I loves your stories.
What happened to the dog? What happened to the dog?
This name's first suggested Ballen video! Ha ha! Extremely strange...i remember a crazy light lakeside coinciding with this exact story around November-ish. Crazy stuffs, indeed! I has all kinds of content to catch up on. Mad love and light, all! Stay frosty out there! 👽🐸😜
Don't understand why these people are going camping with no 🔫 I mean not just for protection but if Ricky would've had a 🔫 he could've hunting for animals not just relying on fish just saying
❤❤
LISTEN 👏TO👏YOUR👏GUT👏INSTINCTS!!!👏
Banjos , lol You do got a purdy mouth Mr Ballen , Love from Kentucky
54? Frail? Mr.B.Allen! Don't be naughty!!Haha!😅
I hear banjos. You got a purdy mouth.
STOP BEGGING FOR LIKES AND SUBS. SAD…..
its also the little sound effects you add that really enhance the spooky, eerie experience. Like the sound of the door unlocking 12:32. And don't even get going on about the dark ambient haunting and unsettling music that plays at a perfect volume in the background while you story tell. 👍 you mastered the craft.
There is at least one serial killer on the  Appalachian trail at all times !! .Anyone hiking the trail by themselves  has a death wish  !! Never hike alone or unloaded !!  It really sucks when you finally realize you brought a knife to a gun fight !!!
Poor dog
You’re an amazing story teller! That is a God given talent. The memory, timing, voice & ability to weave it together are all things that are wonderful gifts! Please keep doing your thing, stay healthy & the success will continue! You’re very lucky! You keep me so entertained! 😊❤
Thanks. I was worried about what happened to the dog. ❤😊
I haven't heard Run, Fool yet but it's clearly a reference to people under the stairs, I love that movie
Really follow your intuition!  If you feel something weird, it is something weird!!!!
Jesus this guy can drag out a story
I bet those 2 guys carry guns now when they go back to that camp site
Like I get the piece and quite but not all people that end up turning on music when they have a guest in the woods are trying to disrespect anything … Not only will it deter predators make people feel comfortable but can also be used for someone lost in the woods to find there way to people
“No good deed goes unpunished”
15 years?  Ppl get longer for weed
And that's why I always have my pew pew in the woods. Not worried about critters as much as I am about the two legged ones.
Too much talking
It’s good to see that Scott and Sean are doing ok and still hang out and go fishing and stuff and lived to tell their wild story🫶🏻
More like Satan worship and nothing to do with loving nature.
This is like the ending of the movie, The Sixth Sense. Totally not what I was expecting. Well done
Don't want to see or hear Chaney unless she's handcuffed and perp walking
What did you say at the beginning about hating our neighbours? 😂what was that? 😂
March 17, 2025 today. I have returned to this story more than once, for it is thoroughly absorbing.
Mr.ballen my BROTHA! 🫵💎💪💪💪🫳🎤✨️🙌✨️🕯🙏🕯🤜🤛
😮😮😮😮
What about the guys that drown from the invisible eddy current at niagara.
At 15:56, Ballen delivers the story with such intensity, building up to the climax.
I'm kinda with Ricky on the no blasting music in the mountains.
How do you get parole after murdering two people and only serve 15 years!? And we have people serving life for drugs!
Bro why, just why do you have to treat us like idiots and put shit like (NOT a picture of his truck) (Not a real mermaid) like for real? Is it supposed to be a joke? If so. Oh
Omg! Before I left Cincinnati, my downstairs neighbor was a PAROLED SERIAL RAPIST named Randall Smith.
Does anyone know what happened to Ricky's dog?
Guys Mrballen told us to commit arsen 🤣
So Ricky's dog was just his hallucinaton. There was no mention of the "dog" when he joined the others. That's what threw me because serial killers don't have empathy for animals, much less humans (Buffalo Bill's Precious notwithstanding).
I found out a lot of these stories are from reddit. I wish I knew that earlier, before wasting hours of my life that i'll never back. Reddit stories.😅😂🤣
It may be a human code to help people on a trail, but not always. People are responsible for themselves. It seems nice and all, but on like Everest or something NOT one person will stop to help ya, step over dying cause you didn’t pay ahead of time for rescue. That’s the Risk  pal. Get hurt and be left there in certain cases. Or like a kayaker flips over at sea. The other guy heads to get help. Leaves him to die. Helping people is not a code at all. It’s called being a good person
If you as an American go camping without a gun,you just another dumb mofo that didn't need to be born in the first place... People need to understand that even your own property can become a hostile environment so imagine being in the wild??? People need to used common sense
RICKY SHOWS UP WITH NO SUPPLIES......
RICKY DON' LOSE THAT NUMBER....
JOHN B WHAT IS WITH ALL THE HAND JESTORS?  IS THAT TO KEEP THOSE WITH A SHORT MEMORY SPAN HOOKED TO THE CHANNEL? IT IS VERY DISTRACTING, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE CHASING AWAY GHOSTS IN THE STUDIO......😂😂
Good job telling this amazing story. Usually, I end up a bit depressed after hearing one of your stories, but not this time. This one had a good and appropriate ending. “Infamous bad guy dies …”  TY
Fool run, talk to soft,
I see so many saying the moral is to not release killers, well that's too be debated depending on the type of murder but that's not my point so I digress. The moral is this is why the second amendment, gun ownership and training are important. Don't be a target, stay strapped and well trained! Something like this story damn sure wouldn't happen to me unless I was the person he shot in the face and didn't know it was coming, even that might not go well for him. Appendix pull training is a thing, lol. Anyways, have a good day people, go to the range today!
Ahhh, you had me going there Mr. B! I though Ricky Williams was going to be the victim!
At of all the intros biv herd about the like button I fell like he has an vendetta against it😅
What happened to the murderer's dog?
I'm from Brasil and i try study inglish. Your way of talk and expression is very easy to understand, especificly to one beginner like me. I wish you very Lucky and progress at the youtube ❤ thank you
It’s disrespectful to blare country music anywhere
He was satanic. Likely had demons.
what are some of these ppl doing for a living where they can go fishing/camping for weeks at a time
the most brilliant thing is how you told this story from "Ricky's" perspective so we never suspect him but he turns up being Randall the killer.. I thought it didn't kind of make sense he's out there with his dog with no food and so hungry but brushed it off...
Great show!
Doesn't sound amazing to me 😮
Glad to hear that Sean and Scott pretty much made full physical recoveries and apparently still enjoy going camping in the same area of the incident. Pretty amazing actually
What happened to the dog?😢
So the cops found DNA of women and circles on a map, but didn’t try digging at the circles? Amazing police work
Wow!! This threw me for a loop!!! I totally had it all wrong!!!
Nice way of making the psycho killer sound like the victim.
"You sure got a pretty 👄" ----Deliverance the movie
I live right beside the AT. There are caves on my property, and hikers would come stay in the backyard , and I would take them through the caves. In Hampton, TN. I saw some really strange people on the trail, but also some of the best I have ever met.
Just got recamended this channel yesterday and already addicted. Very different and interesting. Subscribd already ! 😊Thanks
54 is older?? Hu?
Your so funny
Mate, I love your uploads but why do you wear your baseball hat backwards, you’re not a teenager 😂
Hi, just wanted to say I learnt about your videos after watching the dive talk guys. Would be great to see you guys do a collaboration
1 year anniversary 🎉
I like how Ricky thought it was disrespectful to a beautiful place to be blasting country music. Yet murdering people and hearing their screams as he took their lives in that exactly beautiful spot is somehow better. What a delusional pos
Why are you using pics of RMH Carrilion???? Thats the craziest thing Ive seen in your vids so far!!!!!!! I went to RMH when my fingertip got yanked off...LMAOOOOO!!!!!!!
What a sick story.  Too horrible.  But it goes on every day in Washington dc.
Yes but Washington  DC  is a horror  show of murder   So you don't  have  to look far. We❤earth humans Google management surgery Larry.
What happened to the dog? :(
To spill blood after the sharing of meat and mead is to bring a curse upon your house.
What a meany head
More about unknown serial killer.
Why is it always "pairs" of underwear?
Comment for the Comment Gods!
Application trail is very haunted & dangerous
❤
I'm embarrassed that it took a picture of Roanoke Memorial Hospital for me to realize I don't know this story and I live where it happened! I heard of his 1st murders when I first moved to the area, but I'm not sure how I missed this 2008 story. What an amazing survival story. I've always been a little afraid of the trail, which is an irrational response to hearing about murders. I'm so glad someone on here found out what happened to the dog!
Mr .Ballen, you absolutely amaze me.... every time.  I think that you must be Italian from watching your hands.  My spouse is Italian and has given me a few black eyes,  from his Expressive hand explosions!!
What a twist !!!!!!!!
Thank you!! Now i owe my neighbours a new lawn!😅
He was a Satanist, or demon-possessed.  I have NO interest in  being in such isolated places .
When I have my own place I’m gonna get 3 big dogs so I don’t gotta deal with this bs
Truely, humans can be the worst monsters out of all existing monters anywhere.if you dont know that person never get into their vehicle as many here in Phoenix az have learned last year 500 homeless people vanished in this manner. Be aware and be safe and trust no one.
With over 6 billion satan worshippers worldwide i say its best to avoid any forest areas, your just dimminish ing your chances of living your life. This is a bad thing thats only going to get worst as time advances.
His worse mistake was running into a 3 to 5 day person of action. Smh Thank God the other women still had a pulse and called instead of co-stare.
Too much poetic licence
Who  de-bones trout before cooking them on a campfire?
This is basically a story that should have been made into a movie. The twist at the end would have the audience go crazy.
Reminder: Evil, sick and twisted walk among us everyday.
How tf did the police and ambulance get to the house so fast
Sick sick people. They are out there....lurking
My mouth is wide open, watching this😮
I've heard so many terrifying stories about the Appalachian Trail that I wonder that anyone hikes it anymore! 😱
This is why YouTube needs to allow people to disable comments.. got spoiled the twist like 4 different ways from this auto-scrolling comment bar.. I despise it 😅
Ballen, you need to learn how to telk a better story - you insert too many details which you repeat
This story was featured on the show “I survived” you get Sean and Scott’s side of the story as it happened
Where was the banjo part???
Jessus 😮 we need 100% free therapy around the world. And this guy shouldn't have been let out in the first place, double homicide 😮
But what happened to the dog? 😢
Those guys still go back there. Respect to them
Ah yes Uncle Jon Rambo is alive
Why are murderers getting out for good behavior?! Sorry, but no.
I thought it was a mom and son that was at the house where the man banged on the door for help.
New sub here
Never would’ve imagined that a man with a dog could be a murderer, that was a terrifying, but expected😟😟😟😟💕💕💕
The thumbnail 😂😂😂
What happened to the dog?
The dog didn’t shoot anyone right? The dog is innocent 😢
All these other videos about women living "the van life", and camping alone? Oh no thanks.
So what happened to the dog?…..anyone?
why would you start the story as if ricky was the good guy ?
Mr Ballen. Do your own version of the Russian Sleep Experiment!
MrBallen finds every way to troll the like button
I love how he kept it suspenseful! I thought "Ricky" was the victim at first. Love this channel, great at storytelling 👏🙂
The jokes on the beginning are one of the best parts,🤣very well told story as well.💯
I don't care about the code..... Those sentiments pale into insignificance when our intuition speaks to us and reaffirms that no amount of camaraderie is more important than our own safety.  Never measure another person's character by your own merit..... There are truly evil people out there in the world with nefarious intent. People can disguise a devil's horn under an angels wing.  I listen to God, my intuition, and will never let anyone intercept my boundaries.... Only authentic travellers will understand that, and are part of the tribe.
I love you man
A story teller indeed ❤
God bless Christ...For those men Survival..And to be able to be alive... But i bet old school starting to get all weird talking bout his past...Said to much Old school had demon's..
Paroled after killing TWO people.... 😐 Anyway, very glad Scott and Sean managed to survive - it sounds like the police/emergency response was super quick which saved their lives and ensured this maniac was caught... again.
Wow, I would have never expected this ending!!!
Bit of a stupid intro, set fire to your neighbours garden
Ricky has a heisman he’s aight
Am I the only one who was picturing NFL and NCAA star running back Ricky Williams in my head this whole story?
I like my neighbors I live in a country village.
looks like rauli badding somerjoki’s driving licence
Wow... there's a twist... 👌
What police being smart for once
Love your show n stories only one thing can you make less hand motions 👍
And ppl wonder why we choose the bear over the man...
Awesome story. Great narration. I'm a first time listener... I have to tell you, however, Appalachia (Appalachian) is pronounced "Appa-latcha" ("Appa-latchin")... G'day!
Hey Mr. Ballen, I lit my neighbors yard on fire and had to serve 11 months in jail. Just got out today. Did I do something wrong? Instructions seemed clear.
Appalachian mountains we’ll never be on my by bucket list! Ever!
app a latch n  not app a lay shin -- sorry - just not how you pronounce it
Hungry? You got ur dog don’t u?
RECIDIVISM
No wonder old karen dude died...you don't get rescued and then feel some type of way because you're rescuer decided to play music after rescuing you.
your little joke at the beginning was the wrong direction in today’s insane society - do better
But did his dog survive
I’m always so jealous that Mr. Ballen gets to travel to all these pretty sweet filming locations just for a story. Heck yeah
This “code”, is not a thing.
great story as always keep it ^^ !
Man, this would be my favorite channel, but I try to listen to this while I'm on my long drives and the format is killing me. It gets to the peak of the story didn't switches to a very long ad and then when it comes back, it's never back where it left off and I can never get back into the story part of that is trying to fast-forward through the ad and landing back when he's telling the story, but I just did that while I was parked, and it still doesn't come back to where it left off, it's like this endless cliffhanger and I just stop there and go research it myself. Are there any other channels like this one that just tell the stories?
Cold eyes on that feller.
3:47 sorry at that point you gotta ask if Natural Selection should be left to do its job?  He knew about the crimes that happened just the other say right around the next corner and decide its a good idea to go there? Im sorry to all the families who lose family members do to their bad decisions 😢❤
No knife,  no gun, no brear spray? That's on u bud
I thru hiked the Appalachian Trail in 2016 and can confirm that everyone looks out for one another. Not just hikers to other hikers, but the townspeople in each of the crossing areas literally come out to the trail to feed and take care of the hikers. Even with all of the scary stories, there's truly so much "magic" (as it's called out there) and kindness. Met a guy that lived out there on the trail because he too felt it was home, and lived on the kindness of hikers. Thankfully I met him in full daylight with lots of other hikers around and I did give him some food. Still best to keep your wits about you and never truly let your guard down, just in case. Or as mad-eye-moody would say, "constant vigilance."
OK but what happened to the dog?😢
John, you are an extremely talented storyteller; you make it all look so easy, and your tales are second to none.
I don't care,man!GOD will get you!
FINALLY!!!! A happy ending! 🥹🥰
Wow!  What a scary but happy ending story  that was.
Remember, I’ll throw an apple at Chya if you say Appalachia that way 😆. Apple at cha. But anyway, I think I annoy my family with how much I watch your videos!
7:50 this is a city persons mindset, people who are trying to escape how terrible piles of concrete are get upset when they see or hear something that reminds them of civilization out in the woods. for people who grew up in the woods it's just normal, they're not trying to escape anything and music is enjoyable for them in that environment.
I hear a slight tinge of “Hotel California” in that background music
I like how you talk with your hands.
I take it, Ricky Randy wasn't happy that day.
Wow, what a plot twist. Im so glad that Sean and Scott survived though. That must've been so scary. Thank you mrballen
Demons are real. They leave if you say in Jesus name go.
This is why you should judge people
I’ve seen this story on my True Crime channel I watch
Noooo... he tries too,hrd, it's corny like he's telling a story for little kids.and hid personality bland. Sorry!
But… was the dog okay?
please let that be outside his house he slid the 4xnothing
👍
I really shouldn’t be watching these scary camp stories 😂 me and 3 other friends were stalked during a wild camping trip in the forest.  It’s frightening to hear footsteps repeatedly walking around your tent not know what the intention is or if you are about to be attacked in the middle of the night.
I live near several AT trailheads... I'm pretty terrified of the AT tbh.
I REALLY don’t understand why anyone would ever want to go hiking for weeks, knowing that they’re going to be steadily losing weight due to food rationing? Why is that enjoyable in any way, shape or form???
Bizarre how at the start Mr Ballen made out that 'Ricky' was the innocent one and that Sean and Scott were suspicious. I wonder why?
Total scum human. 15 years for two murders. Shoulda been locked up forever!  Sean and Scott were so nice I’m soooo glad they’re okay. 😩
After 5 years, is the like button okay?🫢
I live in Montana, and most of the smart hikers always take a firearm, and it is not just about the bears.
Where’s the evidence?
Every year we see yet another reason to never go hiking or camping without being armed.
Randall being the villain was a twist I never saw coming especially because most of the story was spoken from his perspective I though those 2 boys were the murderers thank god they recovered.
Why do we let mentally unstable, convicted murderers out of prison?? After 15 years?? Give me a freaking break.
Wow.. what a twist! I feel awful for the two men who simply were wanting to help a fellow “hiker” who they believed was starving.
Omg I saw the movie about the Essex " The heart in the Sea" ! LOVED IT 💗
Is the backdrop of this video the shelter at rocky knob in virginia?
The scariest part of these stories, is how mentally unhinged and unstable people actually are, but don’t necessarily project that. You could be talking to someone who seems friendly and kind but is secretly very sinister.
kinda disapointed big foot didnt make an apperance
🎉
I have heard this story b4 not from this pov nicely done. Im a huge fan. U R Doing An AMAXING JOB. THANK YOU!
“Hi I’m Ricky Williams, you may know me from my time at Texas and the Miami Dolphins”  *hmmmmm, I think this guy’s using a fake name..*
Telling the story from ‘Ricky’s’ perspective was brilliant
The fog right  Now in Anchorage Alaska we're having the same fog it' has a really thick chemical taste that like sticks in your nose and your throat it's no good and it's been rolling in about 3 times today  And throughout the last couple of weeks This past Friday I got diagnosed with a sinus infection After walking outside for about an hour a day 3 days in a row. It is January 20th and it's about 6:30 PM
I just LOVE IT that you ALWAYS edit miles and foots in metres. Thank you for your work !
I know this story from STM... Crazy how Shawn and Scott got down the mountain together while slowly passing out...
Thank God they survived❤
Twist 😍👏
Mr.Ballen you are the professor of the scary, dark and mysterious. I've watched over 50 of your videos thus far and I'm never disappointed, always intrigued, on the edge of seat, popcorn and drink. Very captivated. Thank you.
A murderer is always going to be a murderer .
I believe Mr. Ballen storytelling and his voice are  much better than anybody by far....
I like this channel.  Glad I stumbled onto tonight
❄️y justo estamos esperando la nieve y temperaturas bajo cero Fahrenheit 🥶
You are such a wonderful story teller! Thank you 😊
What a story telling 🔥
What happened to the end of the first story ?
DELIVERANCE
Like what gives, what's the motive
My favorite story you told!
i love the plot twist your good at this
Damn I was fooled by a fake smh, watch out theres someone with the same name as MrBallen
Nice
The plot twist was good!!!
Ah america favors murderous vermins over logic
Mr Ballen stories: 👈👆👉👇🖐️🫰🫷🤞👇🤏✊👇👌✋💪🖖👇🫳🫴  Good stuff bud.
The Appalachian trail is primo hunting ground for hunters of humans.
Real photo of different trout haha
Thank you for this story. I had no idea Vaseline was flammable.
What happened to Rick's dog??
If you hear Banjos you run
This guy's hands movements are in a whole other level 😂
I watched this survival guide guy yesterday as he specifically said too many people loose their life not listening to their Gut feeling and not to act rude or mean
and here i am after midnight looking up best door locks online, and eyeing my mossberg
Talk about plot twist!
Does he really mean to start a fire in your neighborhood’s yard? I dont ever get what he means why he has us do these random stuff
No vehicles on the Appalachian Trail. Fake story.
so if he was running out of food, why did he stay?
There is a GLARING error in this storytelling. Why would Ricky Lee Smith be agraid of a specific killer if HE was the killer?!? 3:30 when he is fishing. I highly doubt that any point of the interaction Ricky was afraid of the two men. Next week: the story of how Dennis Rader moved to the Midwest and was afraid of a killer called BTK, followed by a guy named Gary Ridgeway being afraid of the Seattle Streets because there is a killer nicknamed the Green River Killer on the loose. Unless these people have amnesia (which they don't) this story just dosen't work.
Crazy how ballen victimizes the murders. Lol
It happens that each time he says  "that´s all we do" a snake pass by through his feet.
He sure makes up a lot of stuff
Wow! Did not see that coming!
Oh Mr Ballen.  It's pronounced AppaLATCHun not AppaLAYshun!
shaun and scott sems like really nice guys... sad about what happened to them
So glad they both lived! Idk why but I found myself attracted to Shaun ❤ 😂 not the place, not the time I know. Couldn't be happier this creepy was finally caught & arrested!
You told the story well, i really thought the weak old man was the victim.
I just have to know are these all true stories or just some made up stories?
After listen to mr.ballen after 2 months, I finally subscribed
Good behaviour… INSIDE THE WALLS
🎉 How is he ok, with 2 bullets in him? The metal could get, into the bloodstream. Impair the function of the nerves. Gunshot wounds, can get an infection in it.
they should look at every case from 81 that has murder and release them if they were on good behavior smh
Murdering 2 people and only getting 15 years is CRAZY!!
The heck with the Appalachian trail, to many murders and weird stuff
Small town murder just covered this episode 555, in greater detail I absolutely love both story tellers.
What about the explosion.. What was that
Randle was demonically possessed.
Ricky Williams really fell off since leaving the NFL
Do you know how to get to Bell's canyon..?
Do you like real horror story?  Visit my channel.
7201st.   ❤.   2:05pm Monday December. 30.  2024 Philippine. 🎉.  Time.  😂
I didnt expect that twist.
What happened to the dog?
This is entertaining to listen to but I feel like it's a bit of a misleading way to tell a story: hypothesising it from Ricky/Randall's point of view, that he's hungry/tired, wary of Scott and Sean and just happy to be there having some food and feeling really anxious around them. It's all fiction of course but it's a completely faux set up for a crazed lunatic to essentially serve a surprise ending to a story.
That was one hell of a twist.
I knew Brenda Lee Smith she was pretty cool actually.
I don’t believe murderers should ever get a second chance. They are not worth saving, and risking more lives.
What happened to the dog?
What a plot twist lol
I hear banjos too. My neighbors are out on the back porch having an impromptu jamboree again. 😂
I can't stop watching this channel 😭
Wow. What a twist!
This isn't exactly how the real story went. Also, it wasn't two women it was a woman and her son.
Merry Christmas to you and your wonderful family best wishes for love and prosperity for the new year
What happened to the dog ?
🙄 I wish people would stop diagnosing  killers as mentally unwell! There’s pure evil that exists out here!
I’m just saying I haven’t finished the first story yet, but I dunno how the guy who looks at walking around outside as a religious experience, who in the same vain can’t catch a fish to save his or his dogs life, can look at two men who go out too the woods together, blast music and cook food as weird. Guys seem like dudes to me.
Wow 🤯 stories. NEver disappoint
Blasting music in the woods like that is _so_ not the vibe. But as apparently, that was the least of it.
I remember back when this lake began forming..
Is it just me or are Mr Ballens advertisements ruining his amazing videos!!!
I love the fact that you convert miles in KM, I’m Belgian and learn English with your videos so it’s easier, thank youuuuuuu ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This story was on an episode of "I Survived" and is told by the two victims so it's from their point of view not the bad guys. I wish i would of thought of starting a YouTube channel where i would just summarize true crime shows, get millions of views and make millions of dollars. Both simple and brilliant. Great channel.
Anyone else scroll thru the comments after hearing "Ricky and his dog were camping" knowing how these things end up to make sure before watching any further to make sure the dog survives? Asking for a friend. 😂
Randel was possessed by satan, evil dude.
I found this narrative confusing for some reason.  The circular nature and hearing the names over and over again somehow was confusing to me.  Maybe Im just getting old.
Wait now Mr.Ballen……. 😮 you didn’t finish the story !!  What happened to the doggggggg?!?!  😭 🐾
So,i guess randal killed the other two people back in 1981,is prob because,he didn't like them or they like disrespect the mother nature?           Blud,i dont even know
Oh no don't do that with the gasoline. I personally know a guy who did that 30 years ago because his neighbor was messing with his wife and when he kicked her out she moved next door with the neighbor that she had been cheating with. Anyway, the guy went over and did that very thing on the neighbors lawn and he went to prison for 3 years over it. After he got out of prison he told me that his 3 years in prison were a cake walk compared to the 2 years he was married to her. She was married 7 times before the age of 30. I am not sure what her count is now. I got tired of counting.
Im so confused ngl 😭 Ricky just suddenly just turned on them? Feels so weird
Randle is a "thrill" killer.
And this, my friends, is why we carry guns especially in the woods 😂😂
"I hear banjos...oh, sh*t! Paddle faster!"
The background of @MrBallen ‘s video is a place I worked and lived at called Pisgah Inn, it’s on the blue ridge parkway and you can see 3 states from the vantage of where Ballen is.  It’s incredible and beautiful but also eerie bc you’re in the middle of the woods and the only law enforcement is a good hour away, aside from park rangers.  There was a murder of a worker there by another and it just marked how unsafe it can be.  A coworker of mine had been drinking one night and was walking back into housing and was chased all the way home by a bear.  It was a funny story after but terrifying while happening
Did Ricky go into the mountains without a knife of his own? Or any weapons at all? I don’t leave the house without at least three knives, a can of mace and my hand held equalizer.
Many many lessons to learn on this story.
Well now we knw why women choose the bear.
Great job, Mr. Ballen. I didnt see that coming!
That is excellent I just seen that both men are such strong Stout men they survived
Here's something we can puzzle over how does a man murder two hitchhikers and get out at all much less 15 years later. I haven't finished this story yet but there is no reason for him to be out and Sean and Scott to be murdered or attempted murder
Get to the fkn point
I see the hidden message on the pole 424
I love these stories… READ MORE
I love these stories read more
15 years for killing two people is a terribly low sentence, even worse when you realize that the woman was probably raped although they couldn't be sure because of decomposition.
Well what a twist lol
Not going to lie i thought it was sean
Their rights seem to be more important when compared i our  need not to be tortured and killed
The moral of this story is very clear and evident... Don't play country music in front of someone trying to um... Just don't play it!!! Mr. Ballen forever!!!!
Can we sometimes just lightly tap the Like Button? I kinda feel sorry for him. 😢
Yo man. The way you did this story was so fuckin dope bro

Didn't see that twist coming
IT SEEMS LIKE RICKY HAD SCIZOPHRENIA OR SOME OTHER BIZARRE ILLNESS AND MAYBE DEMONIC POSSESSION TOO
where was the dog in all of this? Did he run away?
That intro, now that’s how you gaslight your neighbors.!
(REAL PHOTO OF DIFFERENT TROUT)
It's important to remember that the perpetrator was almost certainly VERY mentally ill.  It's kind of mind blowing to be reminded that murderers often only spend 10 or 20 years in prison and then they're back out amongst us again.  How can you randomly kill a couple of people and ever be deemed safe to reenter society?
It's always great when the story has a happy ending, albeit😂 fairly rare
There's got to be an interview somewhere out there with Scott and Sean lol .
I'm so excited that Sean and Scott lived!!! OMG I've been crying since they got shot!!! Randall should've never been let out!!! NEVER!!! Justice was served though!!!
Perfect example of why  harsher punishments are needed.
Welp this confirms why I just don't make friends are really want to be around anyone ..
Stick to your stories stop side tracking
GOD bless you both. Sean and Scott hoping your prayers are answered and that you have a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Sincerely,                  Me.
Daily Reminder: JESUS LOVES YALL ❤️ 💝💗💕💛💝💖💚💓💕❤💌💛💖💝💙💌💓💖💝💗💘
Bruh I thought Ricky was shot.
Ha! Randall was so bad he couldn’t kill those two beast of men there bodys said we will not die till he behind bars and they Lived and Randell died karma work in a magical way
I think the aliens  are controlling  the nuclear power  plants.
the guy at the end is just mr. ballin pretending to have that smooth black voice.
i imagined Ricky's dawg as his homeboy
Im so proud of how far you've come man.
As a former Probation Officer of 19 years, I was often frustrated when the courts would release offenders after probation officers argued for continued detention, elaborating on their dangerous tendencies with justification but were denied
Wow, what a twist!!!
OH MY GOD! I REMEMBER THIS STORY! great retelling!
Society does release murders, sometimes to soon or give light  sentences. As a criminal law professor once told me, the law doesn't recognize being sociopath as a valid mental illness defense. There are just to many of them.
I LOVE how this story starts from Ricky's POV, it makes this story's twist WAY. WAY BETTER.
Were they playing dueling banjos maybe it was Deliverance
"Not a real photo of rickies fishingline" 😂😂😂
When ballen was good
Can see how Sean survived those bullets, guy is built like a space marine
i hate my neighbours😁😁
BRO where tf did that plot twist come frommmm😨🤨
Why the heck would someone like that get parole.
I’ve stumbled across your channel and I must say, you’re a great story teller. Keep up the great work and thank you!
So let me get this straight. The man is convicted of murdering two people, he goes to prison for a few years, and then they just let him out, because “good behavior”, then a few years later he tries to murder two more people (that we know of) Here’s a crazy idea, maybe keep murderers in prison so they don’t murder more people.  Crazy, huh? I guess they have to make room in prison for the oh so dangerous parent who lets their 11 year old walk to the store alone. 🤦‍♂️
Apple atch an
What a psycho ingrate
bru why he so vulgar with the like button 😂
Mr Ballen, love your content. Having lived in West Virginia most of my life, many of our towns have pronounciations that look deceiving, for example Hurricane, WV is pronounced Hurr-ick-un. Appalachian throws many folks for a loop as well. It's actually pronounced App-uh-latch-un to us Appalachians. Please keep up your stellar content !!!
I enjoy the stories, but I'm not a fan of his strange, dangerous and sometimes violent suggestions before he starts each story. I'm becoming less of a fan ☹️
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS AND I FOLLOW UP WHAT YOU SAY ALL THE TIME....I SET UP MY NEIGHBORS GARDENS ON FIRE AND NOW I AM IN JAIL....PLEASE HELP ME.....HAHHAHA
I knew ricky was the killer the SECOND you said he got slightly upset shawn was trying to "force" him to stay (they were trying to feed ricky) If he was so hungry, his guard definitely wasnt going to he raised to an insane level Guy had to have had mental illness with no medication Praise God both good samaritans survived  That was a blessing. ❤
Leggo
Mr Ballen..... You're an iconic sorry teller yourself brother
absolutely horrifying as always. loved it
Did Ricky/ Randell tell his story that way. It sounds weird how he tells the story thru the killer eyes.
He prolly ate the other hikers he murdered and no one will ever know. You can just see the evil on his face
😆😆🤣🤣 you said underwear... you had to say it multiple times.🤣🤣😂😂
fr plot twist after plot twist
I'm an 89 year old veteran and have suffered some not inconsiderable injuries. I lost both legs, both arms, my torso, my eyes, nose, mouth and one ear. These videos are a huge source of entertainment for me. Thank you, Mister Ballen!
Nice going and see run fool
Randell killed the hikers because he wanted to. He just wanted to kill someone and thought hikers were easier prey than attacking someone in a more populated area 🤷‍♂️
These are interesting stories and I love that they are true.
Lol😅 it wasn't the furry kind that gave him paws
15 years for a double murder!!??  Unfucking believable.
Didn't Rendal lee smith died in 2008??
“App- uh-latch-un”
Is the dog ok? Plz let me know
Everyone knows if you hear banjo music in the words to run like your ass is on fire.
I’m so glad we got clarity on that photo of NOT Ricky’s fishing line! 😂
I really like Run Fool. I agree with you, his voice is amazing. It’s very soothing and his story telling is top notch. However, I have the premium subscription and I don’t know why, but there’s so many advertisements. To the point where I stopped watching. You, sir, are completely amazing! Love everything about your channel ❤ thanks for all the hard work you obviously put into this!🙏
Thanks Mr Ballen from Singapore, after listening to you and then listening to other channels, I now appreciate you even more as I realised how clear your diction & voice is. Good job Sir
WOW, What an interesting story. I Love listening to this channel ! I’m a retired Mental Health Therapist. Mystery’s and True Crime has always been intriguing to me. One of my Best friends is a victim in a book written by Ann Ryle. The name of the book is “Mortal Danger”. My friends name is Dr Randall Nozawa. He was in the hospital for 9 months after he had been shot in the head. Randall and his wife, Debbie are great people.
They let him out? I mean, if it was a bar fight or a car accident, I could see why, but this guy killed for no reason or provocation at all. Don't think you can recover from that
oh you know only one of the most well known serial killers in that area oO
"Ricky" looked back at Sean and Scott after he fired the shot because he heard a noise?
I get that
Wow
Wow, never heard this story but this is a hospital in my hometown
I kept waiting to hear what happened to the poor dog, who, just like a "child," would not have understood any of it, and would have been upset about being separated from his person.
I really enjoy this watching the show, but I’m concerned about the comments he makes about the Light button for example “ I hate my Neighbour”burned into someone’s grass.  This have suggestions may appeal to young teens and get them into trouble.
Mr. Ballen you should write a screenplay of something like this, and maybe even narrate the film as the voice of Shawn or Scott remembering it.
Do you have a way of keeping people engaged. I love your storytelling. I’ve been listening to you for two years and I don’t get tired.
Randal was a Democrat btw
John tells the best stories!! I can’t find anyone who even comes close.
I’d bet they go to the woods well armed nowadays…..
If
You tricked me there MrB. Its the way you tell them. Lol. 👍
We are well over knee deep into being a "Police state."  Before we're unable to step out of this quagmire, we MUST do something to stop this... I'm just unsure of what needs to be done.    I just know that things have gotten bad over the past 10-15 years, to the point that I never thought could be reached.  I grew up in what was a small town.  Back then, cops were friendly,  considerate, and cared about the community.  If you had a tail light or brake light out, it wasn't an excuse to harrass you, they'd stop and tell you.  Thats all.  There were even programs a few times a year where they'd stop people randomly and gift drivers prizes.  This was in partnership with a local radio station.   As the town grew and new cops were hired and old guys retired, things changed very quickly. NOT for the better.
I did not think Ricky would be the antagonist lol
Wow
Dont worry the comment section will keep us all safe
YouTube should make some adjustments to the autoplay function. It only plays videos I've already watched.
"NOT a real photo of Richie's fishing line."
It’s the perfect time for Scott And Sean to get married ❤
So Mr Ballens' got a prolyem with thr neighbours. Hehe  Join the club
Love all of the content!! However in looking for a home I will not be looking for a modest 2 storey home. Bad Juju 😂😂
Reminds me of the movies wrong turn, house of wax and Texas chainsaw.
15 years for double homocide? The judge that released him should face a portion of what would have been Randall’s sentence. In any other profession you would be on the hook for gross negligence at least
The wilderness is always dangerous. Anyone who goes into the woods without carrying some form of protection is an idiot who deserves what they get. 🤷‍♀️
Nobody gonna bring up the fact there were glasses, clothes and shoes at his campsite? That’s very odd! Maybe he was just cleaning up the AT! I doubt it but nobody knows!
one day.. they'll be able to scan your memories and you aint hiding nothing..  While that is terrifying, i think its gonna be neccessary for dealing with dudes like this.. You just dont know what other people are capable of, and cant scan their sub conscious and see wat their really thinking.. But i think its gonna be paramount in parole.. This dude should Never have been released, he should of gotten life without parole. The fact he only did 15 yrs is astonishing after taken 2 lives.. You did that to my family, and get out like that.. yeah, justice is getting served personally if the government is uncapable..
Literally jaw dropped 😱🤯 when you said rick was the shooter
Fu@# I can hardly ever sleep these days but I cant lie your videos keep me going I'm battling severeental illness but you help me sleep better at night I love your content and im so proud of how far you have come! ❤
Beautiful storytelling, did not expect the twists.
Randall Lee Smith do look like Anton Chigurh though.
too many advertisments
Not the Appalachian Trail.
I remember someone else telling this same story on a podcast...a few years back
I absolutely love love love your story telling . It’s so good!! ❤
I Love mr B mr Ben
Ben your a genius
"Appalachian"  Yep, that's all I needed to hear
Hearing banjos is one thing. Hearing "duelling bangos" on a pair of lutes at the Renaissance fair is quite another 🤔
Mr Ballen pulled you in the perspective of serial murder, then weave a sharp twist to a crazy ending! Oh man, you’ve got me there😂
Wow! That was a plot twist.
Like button animated shorts!
Good narration
Convicted of a double homicide and is released on parole after 15 years? What kind of insanity is that
My favorite thing about your videos is that you label the photos real or not.
I have already binge watched Run Fool. I love it, can't wait for more to come out!!!
Randall has the deadest eyes ive ever seen. Absolutely terrifyjng.
There’s that “ No Country For Old Men”  psycho hairstyle.
I literally just camped at the exact same campsite…. Didn’t know this story until 2 weeks afterwards ☠️  …. And my good friend was there camping with his tennis team 4 days before this happened 🤯🤯🤯 I love the AT, hike it all the time, but it can be SCARY at times!!!
Talk about karma!! You shoot two people, they live and you die 4 days later
he said... He said Appalachia wrong..
I love the real photo of different trout.
Wow. The way you told this story. You absolutely turned it around and it turned out the exact opposite way I expected lol
but was the dog ok?
Upload once a week? It used to be 3,4 & 5 times a week 🤷‍♂️
Randall is a major D.B.
Anyone know what happened to the doggo? It's not the dog's fault that it had a psycho owner.
And this is why i stop watching your videos. Because when i come back, i have a bunch i can just binge. Love your content, man. Keep it coming
He so adventurous because he gos everywhere to tell these story’s
How do you get to Bells Canyon?
Moral of the story. Never crank up country music while youre hanging out in the woods with a mental case
Look at the face he’s making if you pause the video right at the beginning at zero minutes and zero seconds
But what about the dog?
Oh this was a twisted one. You would think ricky was the good guy who ran into two strange men.
Stay strapped, my friends.
I have been binge watching this channel, That Chapter and Into the Fog. I'm now terrified of the woods 😂
Odd thought, how the heck do you carry 2-3 weeks worth of food?
That actually makes so much sense why he thought they didn’t like him and why he thought everything they did was rude or disrespectful when imo it was pretty normal actions or reactions
only thing i don't like is the many ways he violates the subscribe button
Where’s Rickey’s dog?
BOTH of Randall’s victims surviving is mad disrespect to him. Hope he’s looking up from hell absolutely seething
But what about the dog? I can't be the only one wondering what happened to the pupper.
Why does he promote terrorism?
First part of the first story I kept thinking... Why not just go home....? Why continue camping if you have such little food that you're losing weight?
What happened to Randall's dog?
I enjoy your stories, but this one was a bit confusing.
I wanna know what happened to "Ricky's" dog. Hope it was ok
1:02 not me panic-cleaning my phone thinking it got cracked
I love your work MrBAllen I don't think there is a story I haven't heard and I hope you're time on tour is very successful and fun.
Bro is like M Night Shyamalan with that twist. You sneaky SOB
Why would the killer keep his own birth certificate in his campsite that’s SO convenient… almost like it could have been planted? Lmao not really but still weird right
My brother in the strange dark and unusual you HAVE to fix your pronunciation of Appalachia and Appalachian hahaha
I think  if you kill someone  you're  life is null and void
Talk about crappie people
Lord, thank you for keeping those two alive. God, that is a miracle.
Is this a true story?
.
I wonder how many serial killers running free listen to this channel?
Ok but why were Ricky and his dog out in the forest without food to bring about this situation anyway? I don’t know why this part of the story is bothering me so much. 😅😂
Amazing storytelling
What happened to the dog?
Mr B.Allen you are definitely the best ❤🎉
Ok, but what about rickis dog??
Such an insane plot twist I love you Mr ballen
How good are you at telling plot twists???😂
Nothing irks me more than people that dont pronounce appalachain correctly. Its pronounced app-uh-latch-in not app-ah-lay-shin. Ugh
What happened to his dog?
Be a twist if they were the killers and Randall was stopping them. Just a thought
Love and Respect 😎 Thank's for the information 😂❤
What kind of person looses that much blood
0:29  oh no. He’s “gaslighting “ the like button. 😂😮
Only serving 15 yrs for a double homicide is crazy. I wonder if the law said whoever sits on that parole board that releases these dangerous criminals gets to live with them in the same neighborhood. I wonder how many people get paroled. U let him out and he moves in next door
These storys prove more and more why carrying and being proficiant with said firearm is so important.
Hey. I know a good business model. He thinks to himself. Let's wait until we get to a reallly juicy part of the story, you know when we know we fully have the viewers  attention, and just leave the viewer on a cliff hanger to plug our other stories! Yeah that's a wonderful idea. That way they are more likely to stick around after the plug 😂 dick. Love the stories. Keep them coming.
THE PLOT-TWIST? holy shitttt omg. i’m so glad sean & scott survived
Thanks from your fan!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
I also am a small frail guy so i never enter the woods or forest,wilderness without my pistol at least maybe even a rifle slung. I feel like this guy should have known to take protection.
Its not common for AT hikers to have spare food. Most have just enough for their thru hike, your constantly running low, unless they are day or weekend hikers.
What parties activist judges are letting these criminals out?
Sean is huge!!
I go walking in the middle of the night during the summer months to beat the heat and started playing this video. While Im walking by this section of woods, the video plays the sound effects of some rustling leaves and it literally jumps me. Well played Mr Ballen…well played 😅
“They”?  Dont u mean “she”?
Mr. Ballen,  There is one true story of a Siberian tiger hunting down the poacher that had shot it.  It tracked him tore apart his cabin and everything with his scent then waited for him...  Vlad. Was his name.  Any way.  It tore him up.   It's a good story  ✌🏼❤️🤍💙🎇🪽🙏🏼
Yes always befriend obviously sketchy drifters you come across especially in remote wilderness areas …. Always wise thing to do 😂
is this based on a true story?
I love Dismal Falls. Have gone there many times over the years. Used to go beyond that on Flat Top Mountain. Sometimes we would go at night and it was so dark without a flashlight. Some spots were super creepy.
I'd say the Appalachian Trail 'code' is just an universal thing when being in the wild.
😮 well it's Dry in Arkansas so i burned in my yard but said," I Hat My Neighbors"!
Ricky Williams is a football player
That was a plot twist 😱
I just want to know… what happened to the dog? 😮
App-uh-latch-uh!!! Not app-uh-lay-sha. If you say it incorrectly 'round these parts, they'll throw an apple atcha! :)
Seems like Sean and Scott were right to dislike “Ricky” from the jump 🥴
Run fool just isn't narrated by someone who speaks as clearly as you. His voice and way of talking just doesn't draw me in like yours does.
Once a murderer, always a murderer. Thanks for posting.
How did I miss what happened to the dog? So glad they were able to get away and those women helped them! Glad Randell didn't make it so that he could go on and kill even more! Those women could have been victims at some point. Glad all are safe from the psycho who should never been let out of prison!!
🚫 spoiler blocker 🚫
Mr Ballin- Randal, Willy Wonka or Puff the magic Dragon… what ever name he wanted to use …”Randal was crazy as hell” and is exactly why I don’t go hiking!!! 😂❤ As always great storytelling bro! 😎🎥
Ricky was a young boy, he had a heart of stone Lived nine to five, and he worked his fingers to the bone
Why am I listening to this while preparing for a 55k hike alone and unarmed with my dogs? 😅
This woukd be a really good horror movie
Again, an awesome, smooth narration of an unbelievable story...
I remember this story on ID channel
Did the dog live?
I mean ricky does sound like an entitled pain in the arse. Wanted free food, didnt try and get on with the big man, got annoyed about the music, blabbed about loving nature and finding it spiritual then felt judged for it (kinda fair enough when you launch into that with strangers) idk like, haha ricky sounds like a douche 😂
Why do you always tell people to do crazy things that could get them in serious trouble in your video intros it’s very weird
Hands down, best episode yet!  Bar none.
What he told me to do in the beginning of this video is diabolical 💀
Gotta thank my friend and drinking buddy with this one , He introduced me to this channel
So glad the 2 men are ok & living the best life they can under the circumstances ☺️
Watch the vid before reading comments!!... Full of spoilers! Thks guys
Oh man!! I was worried about Ricky! I was thinking “no Ricky don’t follow Scott! Are you insane?!” Turns out he was insane.
The way you tell this story amazes me, the twist is insane!
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG?!? 😩😭
This was a super interesting listen. Felt like watching an episode of Fargo but real
"So there's this guy quadruple the size of ricky" Caseoh?
I followed the 1981 murders in the Roanoke Times and read Murder on the AT trail-because at that time-fewer people hiked and it was unheard of that someone was so crazed.  I did not know or remember that he was out of jail -so sadly surprised. I hope he RIP and others can be at peace  that he is not here anymore. Thanks for your storytelling.  Now there are thousands of AT hikers….  Oh and I do remember 2 women brutally murdered on the AT-closer to Charlottesville- don’t remember if the murder was solved.
I found out that Randall Smith is a distant cousin of mine. That's creepy and crazy.
No Mr B you actually use lawn fertilizer & you can burn certain  rude words into their lawn instead but it wasn't my neighbour. The things teenagers did in the 80's at least we weren't bashing pensioners or homeless people though.🤔😮‍💨
I love the way that this is written!!! I completely expected from Randy’s nervousness and that he was retelling the story that he’d be the victim that miraculously survived. Did not expect him at all to be the killer, much less a killer that’s killed before. I’m glad that they both survived because it makes the story a lot more relieving. Awesome work!
I did not see that twist coming. Amazing story telling.
Repeat after me: app-uh-latch-un. Notice there's not a single y sound in there
So creepy!
Campers are weird in general. Almost every time weve gone camping and run into folks, they're either normal super nice people or way too friendly (impolitely imposing) or too suspicious like theyre hiding something murderous. You can be disarming and polite as possible, but that doesn't seem to help.   My girlfriend and i met a father and son fishing and were friendly with them and suddenly he asks her to stop talking to his son. For no apparent reason. We even offered them some chewy granola bars since we brought too many and the father refused.
I have off the charts adhd but somehow I’m able to make it all the way through you videos without skipping a beat, thank you Mr.Ballennnnnnn
If I have learned anything from the internet it’s stay the fuck away from the Appalachian trail.
Sorry, but I'm not helping anyone but women or children.
Randall was released from prison?!  He murdered two people.
Wow
Appalachia (ăpp-ă-lătch-ă) The Spanish named it. There is no 'sh' sound in the Spanish language.
Haven't been dooped like that in a while, I'm surprised I didn't see this when it came out
"The Appalachian Trail was a very safe place." The Appalachian Trail has NEVER been a safe place. PLEASE do not go on the Appalachian Trail expecting it to be a safe place. Let people know where you're going and do NOT go alone. There are reasons why there is an unspoken "code" that you're expected to help other hikers and vice versa when help is needed.
CHOOSE THE BEAR
That’s so messed up.
Turn to Jesus people, he died for your sins. Repent of what the New testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel get baptized and obey the teachings of Jesus. The gospel and the teachings of Jesus are documented in Matthew Mark Luke and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, if you have faith in Jesus through your faith you will live by his teachings. God bless you all in Jesus name praise God
Great story. Goes to show you cant help everyone.
That dudes voice is awful sounds like an npc and or AI 🤣
That doggy must have been Pawmitized😢😢
I KNEW IT WAS RICKY
श्री सीताराम🙏🙏🙏
I live here in Christiansburg Virginia.. Appalachian trail heads nearby everywhere. Carilion hospital from the picture in the video is about 35 minutes from where I live. Never heard of this story before. Glad the two victims survived.
Damnn. What a twist! Ricky (Not Ricky) WTF?!? 😮😶 Glad Sean and Scott recovered. Fkn survivors, man.
I love that you always translate miles into kilometers. So I can follow perfectly without googling. I’d wish more YouTubers would do that.
Unwritten rules are called codex.
OMG ❤❤❤
John johnston
Missin those “we upload twice sometimes three times a week” days
LET'S GO SCOTT AND SEAN!!! SO GLAD THEY SURVIVED!!! I was so hoping they would make it despite their grave injuries
I’ve watched quite a few episodes and no idea what the riddle in beginning of episodes are for? Can someone explain, does it apply to story?
2 big guys. Brilliant. Scary. Glad they went back to nature.
Just an idea, maybe at some point we stop releasing criminals with serious crimes? "Good behavior"? He's surrounded by prisoners in an enclosed building, how that can be a representative of his behavior in society?
mrballen I want you to know that you are the best person and youtuber ive ever come across. your videos are the highlight of my week and you are just hella awesome and i love you fr
This guy needs a better rider. Ricky...scott...rickyy ....
When my family asked me why i dont go for a camping, I showed them your this video and they have a reason. 😂
But what happened to the dog 😢
The dog?🙁
I don't go deep into the forest, especially for a woman like me, it's not worth it!
well well well the apalachian trial - ive seen enough mrballen to know that under no circumstances am i ever going there
One of the best stories you’ve told!
What happened to the Dog ? Did he die too  ? Genuinely need to know.
I just listened to my 1st RUN,FOOL episode. It was the one about the Wendigo on the Res. I immediately fell in love with Rodney's storytelling style. I'm looking forward to my next episode.❤
I've seen this on a crime show and you're damn good at telling these stories especially this one. You telling it making Ricky feel kinda scared about the 2 friends!! About half way through I was getting disappointed in you for skipping the friends getting away,but you still leave me just a little disappointed because after Shawn picked Scott up,as they were getting the hell out of there Shawn was loosing his eyesight and Scott with his injuries, sitting in the passenger seat was steering the jeep and telling Shawn to brake to slow down as they would approach a curve and speed up when they could.  Glad they survived and I really enjoy your story telling, I find them interesting as hell.  Thank you for your PATRIOTIC SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY.
You KNOW whoever named it Dismal Creek was having a terrible day
Mr John Ballen expertise is the type of truth that DC needs to have on staff.  Speaker of the house . Definitely contributing to the world learning the truths that keep us safer. 😊. A qualified , personable extreme soldier,  the public would listen attentively to information from him. Consider it please 🙏🦁😇🪖💀🗣️🐦‍⬛🦉🥾📢
It’s interesting to my how many people are argumentative about the justice system, mental health, rehabilitation etc in the comment section. I guess that shows how the more questionable laws came to be 😅
a bear wouldn't do this
a bear wouldn't do this
Who is running these parole boards that let’s lunatics who have been convicted of double homicide back into society?   Seriously, a guy brutally murders two hikers for really no apparent reason, does 15 years and some person was like “who cares if he slaughtered two people, he has great behavior!” and just let him back into the world? What in the actual…
Yeah..stop letting killers out of prison  If a person kills another person then they should never be let out of prison.. Unless the victim comes back to life...😮
One of the best stories  Sure ghosts and such are cool But nothing comes closer to the danger a living breathing human can pose and also we actually get to learn something from such experiences
I like how the story begins, with Rick feeling uneasy about someone in the woods, because he was near the place where he had murdered someone before,
Stop letting murders out of prison😢
It’s ballen o’clock
Does anyone know what happened to the dog ??
You should do the story on Saratoga Sam It will be hard to research though, because it is a local story. I don’t even think there’s anything about it on the Internet.
Dude that twist was crazy i thought rick was the good guy cause he had the dog wth
The Casual Criminalist and Kyle Hates Hiking both covered this story as well and they're worth watching.
chill with your hands yours fkn annoying
what a twist!
I love how he tells the story of the killer so it surprises u in the end
Cray cray mentally insane
I said I was interested in your channel; I lied. Your stories are to.long due to much unnecessary detail.
Appa-LATCH-in Trail…not Appa-LAISH-in.
I have to say Mr. Ballen that i like this type of storytelling more so then the podcast because with this type i like the way you talk with your hands and also the expressions on your face when telling the story and what you say about the like button gotta love it.
And thats why we don’t release murders back into the world
Glad to hear Randall wasn’t given the opportunity to be released on parole again. Great to hear Sean and Scott are doing well.
If I was on the Appalachian trail, there is no way I would go into a wilderness like that without a gun. Not just for self defence against people and wildlife but for hunting in case the fish are not biting. Especially because I am a small defenseless woman.Just like that man seemed like he was pretty defenseless and small. I don't want to be eaten by a bear or murdered in a terrifying location or anywhere for that matter, do you
I don’t like country music either, but Jesus
How could the call bring help that fast?  I can't find information about the map and clothes, were they confirmed incidents
It's always reassuring how folks judge danger by human body mass!
Well I got a feeling I going to do something bad to my like button so I ready for this story
So all the narration about “Ricky” being hungry and suspicious was just a setup to throw us off that he was the actual culprit? Isn’t that really a cheap trick that goes against the true story?
I hate when people bring their poor animals along on long hiking or camping trips. 😭
Not that remote if police and ambulance appear so quickly
I love ur videos still ngl i only recently started watching u.. but since then cant stop watching keep up the good work g
Have you checked out the story of The Legend of Baltimore Jack. On the Appalachian Trail.
Hy wut hapind to the dog!!!!!?
AppalachiaN TRAIL IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS TRAILS TO TAKE ALONE.. IT'S HUGE.  There's not just just NUMEROUS murders THAT TAKE PLACE there BUT tons of missing people ON THAT TRAIL. It can't be trusted for just 2 people, let alone 1. WHY CHANCE IT.. ? JUSSS SCARY
Anyone who says “Appa-lay-shun“ can’t be taken seriously
5:36 Its a fishing rod hooked on a branch. How simple-minded were these 2? Something isnt right.
What happened to Randell? 😮
They’re in the Appalachian 😂
Always great to see ya John always look forward to your terrific presentations brilliantly written & produced, dramatic & gripping Many many thanks, Mr Ballen sir 🍀
The creepy movie called Deliverance has a weird young guy playing the banjo.
Do you know how to get to Bells Canyon?
I’ve heard this story before but the way you told it made it way more confusing so I didn’t realize it until the end
That picture of old Randall is horrifying
I really need to stop listening to these when I fall asleep. I have the weirdest dreams 😂
i thought ricky was the good guy😮
Crazy story telling
HOW THE FUCK YOU GET PAROLE ON A DOUBLE HOMICIDE
I read: "i hear handjobs".
I hear floyd roses     Squealing like Dimebags
That either one of them survived is miraculous. That’s messed up
welp i live in western va im cooked
Dude's hand gestures are too much. I do like this channel though.
TF, Ballen! Banjos? Where're the fricken banjos??? Dude. Seriously.  Peace 🙏 🐉🐉
Good story
But what happened to the dog?
My gasoline letters have been lit on fire.
That plot twist was so crazy. I thought Scott and Sean were the bad guys.
This was a seriously amazing piece of storytelling! I’ve watched you from the start so I usually know that you can’t always trust who the “good guy” is in your stories, but this one got me hook, line and sinker 😂
I love a good "nature chant"? And i hate country music but wowza. Glad those dudes pushed through.
The most tucker and dale ass thumbnail
So the women who lived in a very remote area called 911,  and it was like ten seconds before the cops and ambulance showed up?
9mm weak
I'll bet it was the country music that set Ricky off.
I heard the fishing there was dismal
Randal Lee Smith pretending to be Ricky.
❤❤❤  P.s as an Appalachian.. it’s appa-latch-in ❤
Interesting storytelling from the perspective of a killer. Well done.
Hi
Wheres the damn banjos??
best story teller ever
Ok, I totally empathize with Randall’s sense of responsibility towards Mother Nature. I own some acreage in Southern Appalachia and I embrace stewardship of the land myself. But here’s where Randall and I seem to differ: If I come up on two guys listening to music in the woods I DON’T ATTACK THEM WITH A FIREARM. No, in fact I embrace the philosophy of live and let live — it tends to work.
Mr. Ballen, you’re a real one!  Usually, true crime stories are told in a way that doesn’t ring true, but you just told that story in such a way that I finally understood the conflict, which is an essential part of any plot.  I’ve heard it many times before, and I finally get what happened.      A lot of people say they can get into the minds of criminals but they can’t, because they forget they are also human, with human feelings and motivations, flawed thought their perceptions may be.  Usually, the monster is truly one of us.  Remarkable storytelling and true crime analysis!
I literally had to rewind to make sure I didn’t get the names mixed up. And turns out I had heard this story before so as soon as the twist was announced I remembered it 😂 Great storytelling!!
Something made me question whether this bang was a from a gun that Randall shot, because it was said that he suddenly turned around before there was even a bang. That kinda gave it out for me. It was definitely an unexpected plot twist
Does anybody else watch his videos when falling asleep so they can have nightmares I swear I’m not making this up I love nightmares
Girls call me Mr, the way I’m ballen
I feel like he thought they recognized him
It’s a story folks lol a story
1:4
1
Brilliantly told
Didn't know that about the helping hikers but I just thought that should be a given right
Damn you got me with the storytelling from the murderers perspective
Just watch “Black Mass Paranormal” u will see what happens to people in out there
With all respect some of ur stories sound completly made up
If you aren’t going to be the story teller I won’t listen to any podcast.
man this is why you don’t help people but it’s such a hard thing to do
Randall just get angry, because Caseoh aka Sean eat all his fish.
My name is Traci and in 2018 I married a beautiful Navajo man on the Navajo Nation Indian reservation in Chinle Arizona.He grew up here and I moved here from California to work with struggling addicts. The work here is difficult and although the Navajo (Dine) people are beautiful, the land is beautiful and they are by and large a spiritual people, the evil and supernatural things that go on here are very hard to comprehend because it frankly sounds impossible and made up. This unfortunately is only ONE of the scary things that happened out here on the Rez.It was at 2:30 in the morning when the last episode happened and not the first time we had fear like this. Anyone who lives on or has been around the Rez knows that what happened is true, but honestly, I'm fully aware that this story sounds fake, but it's 100% true and only one of over a dozen stories about what is happening out here..So,here goes;The neighborhood dogs were aggressively barking which woke me up and suddenly I experienced the most intense and terrifying rush of evil that was completely unexpected and out of the blue. A millisecond after being awakened by agitated barking I heard a sound close by outside (my window was open for ventilation) that almost sounded like growling but somehow off. (I really can’t explain how it was strange and off, it just was.) I then stood up and looked out the window and saw something so wrong that my brain was trying to make sense of what I was actually seeing and feeling; I saw what was a large dog sitting down and staring at the gate and right when I pulled the drape over it turned its head and looked right at me even though I’d made no sound. What was WRONG WITH THE DOG was the fact that its back legs were backwards, absurdly long, and bent the wrong way. I stared in shock and clearly saw the entire body and my hair stood up and I broke out in goose bumps. I quickly woke Oliver up and within 2 seconds, it was simply gone. I have experienced many demonic experiences in my life, even as a CHILD and I can honestly tell you that even though I clearly saw it, I felt my mind reeling from what I clearly saw and felt, and for the first time was shaking in pure terror. We quickly prayed for protection for the campus and ourselves and pray that I never experience that level of terror again. I KNOW THAT THIS IS CRAZY SOUNDING but come to find out that MANY others here on the Rez have seen this same exact thing. I’m sooooo grateful to have Jesus Christ because the spiritual world seems 10 fold out here. Evil feeds off fear and I’m grateful for God’s protection and watch-care. Ya, even before I went to the window I was slammed with a sudden wave of evil and fear that I could not explain, BEFORE I looked out the window. I still have a part of my brain reeling against what I saw but my heart knows what I felt and what I saw. I have a suspicion that some people are just sensitive to the paranormal because I've had numerous experiences since childhood. I wonder if it is someway just deeper because it's the Rez.
WOAH i got such a jumpscare from that first picture of the dismal falls 😳 did not expect to see such a local story on here!
I have a feeling that the main guy is the murderer tbh
Not saying it is. It just little theory on maybe why he attacked. Wonder since they stated that he was mentally unwell, wonder if he was paranoid and since he’s okay with killing, I wonder if he was state of “kill them before they kill me”. Maybe he had extreme paranoia. Or like he said felt like they were “disrespectful to nature” and wonder if clothing isn’t victims but rather stuff he stole or left behind stuff. No matter the reasoning, he shouldn’t have killed/harmed other and shouldn’t have been out of jail.
A lil more pictures pls ❤
What happened to the dog???
the neighbors liked my message so much they invited the cops over!
I got a question for you guys: whats the correct way to say data?
That radio voice isn’t that great. Kind of mush mouthy
You Tube
How do I comment?😊
So sad they tried to help and feed this IDIOT, and he repaid them by doing what he did to them... Released on good behavior  FOR A MURDERER there should be NO RELEASE AT ALL.....
Rodneys voice is shite
As far fetch as this sounds, maybe they release them back into society is because of the all mighty $$  Think about how many jobs, judges, lawyers, da's, ect..  They always say, (or use to at least) best qualified person for the job!!
Thank a democrat for a life-long criminal being out in the streets.
Maybe these stupid judges should stop releasing convicted murderers. ESPECIALLY in only 15 YEARS!!!
This is the third or fourth Virginia story... You gotta do the Bunny man of Clifton VA. 1970
At this point we’re just trying to kill the like button
Telling a story from that person prospective I can't imagine damn. I really didn't expect it
Never release a murderer!!!
Camping at dismal tonight and tomorrow!!!!! Cant wait. Just wish the fishing was better. It used to be some good fishing up there. And also the falls are but ten miles from the town of Dublin. (My town) He could have gotton food. Scott and Sean were almost victims of thier own decency. Glad they survived.
And for those who want to know, the dog was adopted by a loving family and lived out a happy life.  True.
I'm so fucking tired of every fucking video on this stupid internet is full of of fuuuuucking commercials...   Heey... yooo... did you fucking forget why TV is obsolete ? Exaaaaactly... commercials... It's so tyring
I love the videos and the channel
I love that thumbnail.
I didn't know the Appalachian Trail is so extensive. Thanks for the map.  What a crazy story!
i normally wouldn't have even suspected the twist if it wasnt for me getting use to mrBallens story telling haha.  it still took me a while to guess how this was gonna go.
Dude.. .if you are a Seal..ummmmm
The most craziest plot twist ever 😳
I find it unlikely that someone bleeding arterially from the jugular could survive a 4 mile trek through the heavily wooded Virginia backcountry
bro, chill! the like button has nothing left
Praise God they survived  from this satanic  ritualist.
There wasn't anything about banjos in this story.
What happened to the poor dog?!
Tucker and Dale vs Evil. Definitely. Two hillbilly types, one smaller and clean-shaven, one larger and bearded, are innocently just trying to spend a weekend in the woods and are attacked by what people would normally consider the 'victim-type.'
Holy crap. What a story
Hey Ricky!! Don’t lose that # 🙃
I love Mr ballens videos Shoutouts to the G.O.A.T
You said Appalachian wrong but I'll forgive you because I love your videos
I really like the way you tell a story - very good!
i just wanna know what happened to the dog :(
When hiking or camping I pack a 9" survivor fix blade knife or a 16" combat cutlass and a 7-shot 9mm Pak blank auto pistol to scare off "wild" animals along with a can of mace, whistle, and a flare. I feel somewhat safe with these items
America letting a killer out for good behavior
This guy sucks. But, what happened to the dog 😭😭
I love the way u tell your stores.  Very trippy and unexpected.
What happened to the dog?
curveball again 😂
What a bizarre twist to this story! McBallen is anaddictive story teller!!
Why did he kill Sean and Scott? Because he is a killer
Yea right when does an ambulance show up that quick?
Why does the algorithm only suggest your videos on my feed when its dark outside?
What happened to the dog?
What a surprise a convicted murderer gets released and tries to murder again…
And my husband wonders why i never want to go camping 😢
Bro this story was crazy!!
Next time you want to blare your country music in the woods, remember this story.
Why’d the title say  “I hear banjos”
Ok, as I sit listening to the story, I also have work to do on the computer, but I cannot do it. I just have to watch your face as you tell a story because you just get so into it. Thanks for what you do!
btw you can open carry up to a 20 guage caliber.  I will be the judge.  DTA Dont Trust Anyone .
I saw these guys story on “I survived” and it blew me away. If you all haven’t watched it you should because the telling of it from their perspective is insane. 🎉❤ so thankful these guys get to live a normal life.
Naimov ML 🔒
Wow!
What happened to tha dogie tho 😢
5 minutes in...  Me: *siiiigh* please tell me they just hold hands and ride into the sunset for gods sake.  *Remembers the title*  SH!T
So happy they both lived. Also what happened to the dog?
I heard the dog was adopted by Sam Carr.The dog made friends with a guy named David who would have long conversations about life and death. Maybe we will get a Tale about a dog like this one day and the precieved origins. One can hope.
“Appa-LATCH-in”
Thats y we have trust issues to help stranger also😢
I would like to know how thorough of a search if the circled areas on the map were. Did they use cadaver dogs?  If he did kill other people out there, it could have spanned over many years, so much so that there is no visible evidence to be seen. A cadaver dog though can find human remains if there were any in those areas, despite how many years ago they were buried.
Wait, these two women who live in the middle of nowhere, called the police. Then the man collapsed. And before they could even register what just happened, the police and ambulance showed up?  How?
Love your style ❤
I honestly think the president should pardon the like button for as much hate that has been done to it
The twist just had my jaw wide open. Holy crap
So Ricky was actually Randall???🙀
Imagine being shot in the face and chest, and other guy getting shot in the neck and back, still managed to get to help, those are some true warriors.
I think ill give run fool another chance. I tried listening to one when you first promoted it but for some reason it didnt real do it for me. Its understandable of course that being Mr John B Allen, you dont get the same fill WE all get listening to Ballen stories! ❤
Idc if it's premeditated or not, if you kill someone in cold blood you should never be released from prison.
Wow that really was a plot twist
I know the backward cap had become a brand identity for him but I just wish he changes that. It would be nice as it looks very juvenile  but very clever story teller.
What a story, I been watching you for ages but never commented I watched this video multiple times, what a twist. 10/10 story teller bro!
I love gyatt bbc
I don't like really violent offenders should be eligible for any kind of parole.
You sound like a fed when you pronounce appalachian like that
wait what happened in the first story an explosion happened, then what?
I don't miss the lock-downs or the coof but I do miss his uploads 3 times a week.
Democrats are weird
I believe time is recorded in a never ended tape, that stacks on top of one another.   Like when you record over a cassette, and during silence between songs, you can hear the last recording.   When bad things happen, it spikes, and bleeds through the new layers.
The way this story was framed is genius.
LLLLLLLLLLLUNNNGY
I hope you keep doing the videos.  For someone like me the hand gestures and body language keep me engaged.  Podcast i tend to zone.
LOL..l hear banjo,s ? Then git over that log BOYYYY !! I gotz me n ardea LOL!!😂😂
The abuse of the like button is the best😂😂 getting some great ideas😂
Oh, wow.  It’s almost like paroling a double murderer after only 15 years is a bad idea or something.
Never go hiking anywhere with out fire arm.
❤
bloody hell x10
I really feel bad for those two all they wanted to do was help a man who looked like he needed help
I was so confused when you said Ricky shot them, I was like: ????? Ricky??? Wasn't that the old skinny dude with a dog???   Your really an awesome story teller, loved it and I'm happy that the last victims survived :)
Bro you are the master of storytelling!! This was a great story!!
no fucking way
Moral of the story, stop letting murderers out of jail to attack people again.
21:17  the system is so damn dumb why y’all released a man who murder two people oh wait he’s white 😅if he was black they would’ve never released him 😅
I hope this isn’t repeated, but with over 6,000 comments, I won’t hold my breath. The items that they found of all kinds of people is “litter”. It was disrespectful to the trail, so he cleaned it up. Several remarks were made about his disdain for visitors that disrespected the area. I loathe litter too 😄 23:27
This was intense. Those poor guys, I'm glad they live. Randall looks like Rowan Atkinson if he was a psycho murderer.
Love you Mr ballen but it’s APPLE AT CHAN
This story is crazzzyy 😱there really are some psychos in this world.. Thoughts to all the people involved :(
U twist the truth of the story  U made him sound like the good guy an the others like the bad guys an them u come on the end an turn It all Around.  U misconstrued the truth for likes an subscribers
And we also don't understand why you made it sound like this Ricky dude was someone he wasn't 🤦🏻‍♂️ I despise liars you jerk
This story was on “I survived “
I’ve heard this story before but didn’t know it was the same story until you said that they were airlifted to a hospital then I was like oh this is the story of when Randal Lee smith was released and started killing again
Well my friend & I started making plans in April to hike the trail next spring, yikes
That is absolutely frightening that you meet people and you NEVER (and will never) know what they are capable of. I have helped people and even given rides to hitch-hikers……never again. Nothing ever happened to me but my brothers got worried and I learned that I can not be so helpful and naive.🌸
Aside from you stories……you are absolutely adorable! 😎
Why would you release someone who had murdered two people before? So stupid.
Hey i live on the trail. Do not fuck with things sounds or other people. Any bad feeling you have in the woods is correct listen to it
Fake foto of different fish 😂 Paroled for good behavior😢 Anybody who does weird chants and shenanigans are always sus. GOD TOOK CARE OF THE PSYCHO ❤
It was the music bruh. It was disrespectful to his sacred place. He was insane and that was probably the logic.
I think it's so cool that the people who were attacked still go back to the same place lmao like they're not going to let that horrible event ruin a good time
that RUN FOOL STORY  is so stupid
bro this story really made me say “wow.”
I love the videos. But how can you explain how the person was feeling or saying if they were killed 😂😂 I never understand that in the videos
Starting the story with the killers pov is wild
The way this was perfectly told with foreshadowing and plot twist was cool
Aint never been in a situation more that 10 minutes that i was uncomfortable about or around....Thank God i was raised as a self cared for child that answered to no one without any repercussions as i still do as i want without repercussions.
I think I might have heard this on I survived
i still like u better the matin :))
So how do they have vehicles if they are out in the middle of nowhere on this trail?
what happened to the dog?
Y’all skipping the fact he got 15 years for double homicide.
THIS IS WHY WOMEN CHOOSE THE BEAR  Men should choose the bear too
Chad wright says hello and wonders what happened to navy meats meetups 0:33
I wonder what happened to the dog...
WHAT!?! What happened to the dog!?!?!  But really, politely, was dogo ok?
Now I'm addicted & can't wait to head to the podcast! Ty Wonderful Channel Nice to escape Poltics, etc!!!
Sounds like Ricky was not very smart.
I didn't get the ending if he d!ed after the truck incident then when was he arrestd and released?! Please explain and clear my confusion.  Thanks in advance!  I came across your channel today and binging already!  Regards from India 🤍🙏🏽💐
That was a hell of a plot twist for me. I genuinely thought that Ricky was going to be the victim not the attacker. Had me gasping at work 😂
Your storytelling is one of the best on the internet ❤
What is it with you and the Like   Button 😂
I love Mr. Ballen's storytelling. I do hate how everyone has their own version of how to pronounce Appalachian. I say we defer to Appalachian State University. All other pronunciations sound like people wrestling with sounding more sophisticated. Lol.
When I listen to all your story telling I'm so amazed how you tell them so finely detailed. You have an amazing gift. I love your YouTube channel . I congratulate you.   It's awsome you are so talented I tell all my friends.  Blessings from Uruguay 🇺🇾.   I lived in Australia for 43 year and never heard anyone tell stories like you do.  Thank you for sharing.  🙏
Is this channel independent? Or are you supported by the corporations?
Sean and Scott surviving is the absolute best part of it all and I really hope they're happy and well
You look a lot like Scott Johnston :p
Ahn, the American legal system…
But what happened to the dog?
what happened to the dog?
One time I went to a retreat in Santa Barbara Ca to a place that no longer exists La casa Maria@ 3am I woke up and could hear native chanting since that land belong the Chumash Indians it was scary
Biggest crime of century zionist nazis treachery against Palestinians who opened up their homes to them when Europe kicked them out
What happened to his dog?
What about the dog ?
Appi LATCHIN (pronounced LATCH)....please! 🙄
I’m so confused did they shot at him what was the bang
I hate that fuking like button too but ill hit it for ya on everyone of your videos. Youre channel is very entertaining and you tell these stories very well. Plus you were in the military and risked your life so i dont have to worry about mine. I wish you all the best, success, and happiness. You deserve it. Thank you for putting me to sleep at night( except a few scary ones actually kept me up)
This guy uses his hands as much as John Madden.
Wow what a twist this is why i love your videos
Good thing i only listen to the audio, the hand gestures is used more than the italian gangs in italy and it's useless and annoying.
Should make this a movie
Why wouldn’t anybody help anybody in need? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Mr. Ballen is the story teller, mountaineer Hozier.
Doth thou knowest thy way to thine canyon of Bells?
Am I the only one who finds it very strange not bring out trained cadaver dogs to each and every spot that was circled on the map they found. Of course they aren't going to see any outward signs of violence having been committed. The likelihood of that has got to be soooo super low. Between weather and time in general it wouldn't be visible for very long after something like that happened to begin with. Or so I would imagine anyway. Let alone however long after it had been for the other areas!! Or how many times it had rained since ect. Just seems strange to not THOROUGHLY and completely search in full. These days there's so much technology available  to begin with for goodness sake. Everything from trained dogs as mentioned, to ground penetrating radar and who knows what else.
I bet they pack weapons now....shoot fire I would....
like ok nature boy we don't do that meditation stuff or yoga...
The "Real photo of Randall" looks very post- mortem.
i gotta hand it to you, this is excellent storytelling.
Were there any homosexuals lurking in the woods there?
😂
THANKU AMAZING STORRY MRBALLEN
The gals lived in a remote area off the Appalachian trail and the police showed up lickety split?
I’m sorry but Rodney Barnes is NOT for me …much love Mr. Ballen
Goddamn, it was fuckin Ricky this whole time.
People need to stop telling us how animals are such wonderful judges of character.
So either we need to stop letting killers out or remove the thing that lets them kill aka their arms. I’m glad them men survived and they have steel balls to go back, I would be too paranoid
I enjoy a lot of this channel but I wish I could black out the lower half of my screen so I can’t see the obsessive hand movements that never match what he is saying at the moment he makes them. Please stop so I can watch more. Handcuff your hands to the table or something.
I’m really hoping those clothing items they found were just things he stole from other campers.
Dude was possessed
I think you overlooked a small detail, he said he was mad that Sean turned in country music that disrupted the peace of the wild ,  maybe something triggered that thought process back in 1981.  Maybe he was an extreme wildlife person , and didn’t like it if anyone acted out that would disturb it
You should totally do a video where its like a plot twist, where you tell a whole story, and then it turns out your telling the story in the perspective of the killer... edit: nvm thats exactly what this video was
scott shouldve picked a bear i guess
I think the dogs name was Bo
If they recall MrBallen to Active Duty, they should make him the Bob Hope of story hour for the troops.
The true Disney twist villan
The camping stories are the best.. they scarr me so bad I have to listen to them.😊
In the beginning I thought Ricky will be murdered but damn that plot twist
I hear banjos,  lol
* NOT A REAL PHOTO OF SCOTTS BAIT *
whenever there is an animal involved dog cats , don’t tell us if they died too 😭😭 THAT kills me more 😩😩 we don’t need to know
The like button put a hit out on you man!
Hhhwwwwhhhhwaaaaat thats crazyyyyy. What a loser like we FED YOU 😩
Do you know how to get to bells canyon?
Pronounced apple-arCha
I don't understand, if he was starving why not just go back home? Why starve???
So this piece of shit took 2 innocent lives & shortly got released for “good behavior” ? What the fuck is wrong with our legal system 😂 the punishment for murder should always be life in prison or death. This story just proves these sick fucks will always do the same thing over & over again
The plot twist was shocking i was bamboozled
Sounds like he’s paranoid, and that he takes his outdoors home very seriously lol. Those two guys weren’t being disrespectful of the outdoors. They’re just southern guys. They play country music when they camp!  They were nice guys helping a dude out!
I prefer your way of storytelling, not gonna lie 🙈
Sounds like George and Lennie from Of Mice and Men go camping.
Why did the police let go of a brutal murderer, who killed 2 innocent people in a trail, by stabbing them after only 15 years of prison?? Like wtf
Love the intro background music man but quick question, what is the song called?
No way this happened on the exact day I was born. Once I heard it I had to go back and make sure that’s crazy
I had both this video and That Chapter's "Police Discover the Missing Hiker is a Serial Killer" RIGHT next to each other on my Watch Later list for more than a month now. I *just* finished the other video and was startled to find by about the one minute mark that this is (at least in part) the same story lol.
This "code" you speak of. Normal people just call that being a human being!
Thank you for many interesting stories! I can not find episode 16 you talked about, where is it? Thank you from sweden
Released after 15 years for good behavior? What about the EGREGIOUS behavior of previously MURDERING two humans?
I have two important questions:  1. Was Randall’s dog okay after the crash?  2.  Did the doggo find a new home?  🐕
Oh I know this one I think. Dear old Ricky 😬
What? No offense. But this prolonged and over dramatized way of telling the story ultimately destroy it.
Wait, what?? Now i hafta rewatch. So confused.... lol
You told the story in very suspenseful way. You can be mystery writer 👏👏👏
you deserve your success, you're a very charismatic, animated storyteller, well done.
Why you pack a piece fellas
Exactly why would someone like this guy ever be released from prison!!
But most importantly what happened to Rickie’s dog
And i thought the whole time that scott and sean were gonna kill Ricky and that Ricky was the one who went up to the house. That was an amazing twist i didn't expect that.
I’m so confused I don’t know if Scott is Ricky like help
They STILL go back camping ?? Naw crazy
This man has traumatized the like button
ALWAYS BE RUDE. NEVER BE POLITE .. IT WILL COST YOUR LIFE
You are getting close to 1 million subs. That is absolutely great. I am so glad for you
Guys trust me I didn’t do what Mr ballen said he’s lying
'older man'...in his early 50s...smh
What happen to the dog?
Why would anyone care that a criminal displays good behaviour? And use this as an excuse to let him out? Because he behaved well when he was not free to kill? He committed a double murder. He's incarcerated for a reason. I'll never understand.
As a native i respectfully request that you say Appalachain like the natuves say it- "apple latch un"  thank you
The ballen bow,😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah that’s what Ricky thought he was going to get lucky with
It's actually not pronounced like app-a-lay-shin. We say app-a -latch-in trails. Appalachian trails
They even appeared on an episode of “I survived “ you should look it up it’s interesting to watch them re tell the sorry
"fiddling around with weapons" used to sound a lot like "properly utilizing tools".
Brilliant story teller ❤
I've grown up running around the Blue Ridge Mountains all my life camping and hiking. I also grew up with all the horror stories of the Appalachian trail. And there are a lot that the general public doesn't know. There's a few us locals don't have answers to. I avoid the Appalachian trail as much as possible because of the things I've heard and know. There's plenty of other trails that although clearly not as long and famous but that's the point to. This crazy Smith guy is still a boogyman tale here that visitors don't take seriously and some think it's just a ghost story. But people like me stay far away from Dismissal Creek. The name alone is a warning.
Word of advice, if you hear music in the woods. . . turn tf around and book it.
No way would I go hiking without a gun
Totally thought it was gonna go the other way around and Sean and Scott had shot Ricky.
Please bring light to what the heck is going on in Flint Michigan with the water and also the people they promise a ton of money to and that’s not happening
Dude what happened to ricky???
That was a crazy twist! I was thinking Ricky was the one attacked
I wonder if mentally disturbed people come to the woods and trails to find peace and their violent tendencies just come out there; or do they come to the woods and trails actively looking for trouble.
I remember watching this on I survived!
This was a good episode
Excellent twist!
Appalachian.... enough words for a big NO
I knew it  Im getting so good at predicting the end and who the killer is. Is pretty obvious after listening to every single mr ballen video
This is the biggest loads of BS I’ve ever heard
How do you know the exact conversations😂
Make this a horror game
That’s why I NEVER GO OUT TO THE WOODS, even being raised to love nature. People are freaking C R A Z Y!!!!!!  They’re usually the nut balls who seclude themselves for a reason because they can’t function in Society.
You got me!  I’ve heard this before from you! I def like hearing the tale from a different perspective.. you had me thinking that Scott and Sean were the bad guys! But duh if I only knew the campers name from the story! ❤
My favorite that I didn’t even know was my fave lol are the camping trips and the hiking trips .. I will never go alone if I EVER DO .. I’m a chicken anyways these stories solidify that! .. ❤
MrBallen you think your good looks have anything to do w your rise to fame lol jk you tell a good tale in a special way and you don’t laugh or make fun no opinions given you leave it up to us to form our own thanks .. ❤
As always. Great give.
Thanks Obama
Bet you they both carry a firearm these days.
Wow just wow, talk about PLOT TWIST
"You're a city boy, aintcha?"
Is the background falling creek in nc
Too much hand motion my man...
But….what about the dog….?
Did I miss the part where he said what happened to the dog? What happened to the dog?
Wow I know Sean. This was such a crazy story. So blessed Sean made it out alive🙏. My daughter and I still go to Dismal a few times a year. Its totally safe and I never had a problem. Really bad luck for Sean though.
Paddle faster I hear banjos
That like button suggestion was hilarious
Im sorry i feel like if you murder someone in cold blood especially you should never be off electronic monitoring.
need to watch out for moutain people
It never ceases to amaze me how many people go hiking/camping without a handgun
Wonder what happened to the dog...Ugh
Maybe the detectives should do their jobs and go to ALL of the circles on that map of the Appalachian Trail and see if it contains a murder scene or a dead body!!! Yea, that just might help a little bit.....
The dog?
Iam not an investigator or anything but he’s only convicted of murdering two hikers but yet has a map with a whole bunch of circles (kill sites) and stack of bras and prescription glasses they just dismissed all that like it was normal not including everything else found at the same time
The twist in his stories are the best
Bro this story really shocked me
I did NOT expect that ending
not saying “appalachian” like a fed 😩
That was a dark like button skit but I love it
I’m so glad Mr Ballen is finally getting the fame he deserves, I’ve been watching him for 4 years and I’m very happy that he’s finally starting to blow up
''the bloody guy'' hahaha love u Mr. Ballen
What’s wrong with you and are you OK? That is not right and that’s not a good thing to do to your neighbors.
A perfect example of why certain actions a human makes, should forfeit their ability to get a second chance. Why would you give a murder a second chance for “good behaviour” 😂. What is this world? 😂
App-Uh-Latch-Uh
Run fool! is very good. Suggestion; Have Rodney say "run fool" like hes telling someone to run. It is the only thing that gets me. How monotoned 'run fool' is said.
After all that, it may be stupid to ask but I'm wondering what happened to the dog that Ricky had.  Ricky seemed like such a normal guy at the beginning just out fishing with his dog Ricky and the story start out innocent enough and then everything just got chaotic.... and the dog disappeared in the story. I don't understand how he had the dog in the first place if he was living out in the middle of the woods and why the dog wasn't freaking out during the shooting.
Why I have to hate my neighbours to watch ur vedios???looks like u r going insane like ur stories.....
Damn.  I am listening to this on May 6 th....cool.
He wasnt released flr good behvaior. It was mandatory parole after serving his two concurrent 15 year sentences.
I’ve heard this story for Scott and Sean’s point of view. Extremely sad and disturbing. I’m glad both men are alive today to tell the story. I’m sure this ruined their trust with strangers as it does with me listening to these real stories.
I knew it was Ricky but I ain’t think  it was the same killer from previous murders
I was like “oh may 6th my birthday!” At the beginning forgetting the video I was watching 😂
I was so happy to hear that they lived and made a full recovery. May God bless and protect these young, brave men. Can't imagine the trauma
Instructions unclear; my neighbors had me arrested for arson.
Western Virginia? Or West Virginia
I called it from the beginning of the story when the killer was mentioned 😅
Maybe the clothes & glasses & things that clearly wasn't his, came from clothing donation boxes he possibly broke into.
I live out in the Sierra mountains of California...not sure why I love these camping stories! So grateful these two survived.
A literal menace to humankind that would kill any living thing in his sight with no reason or remorse was was freed from jail just because he "behaved well".
You have got to have the most unique " like and subscribe" intros on youtube. Keep it up man
Doesn't ,anyone use common sense anymore camping alone is risky at best
this side of the internet i visit sometimes
I don’t know but maybe 15 years for a double homicide isn’t a long enough sentence. Imho
Rickie betrayed me
The albino banjo player from deliverance
But what happened to the dog?
Mr ballen has an uncomfortable vendetta against the like button....  I'm absolutely here for all of it 😂
The spin on this story was smart I thought it was the 2 campers who was hurting the one bloke but I was wrong real scary stuff.
Parole board should be held responsible.
How does Sean still have a bullet in his back and in his head? I can see maybe the one in the head being too unsafe to remove, but the back?
bring back insane asylums.
Mr. Ballen: "There's a code in the Appalachian trail-"  Me: "Don't look into the trees?"
No good deed goes unpunished I guess. I’m glad they survived.
Scary business right where I lived 😢
Can't believe how many subs u have now, been listening for six years...
What a crazy story!
Alright... me now adding camping to diving and spelunking on my list of things to never try.
what happened to the dog ?
First time I’ve ever figured out what the plot twist would be before it was revealed on a Mr Ballen story, still a great story as always!
Sean is a fffkkin G!
I just seen this movie but can't remember what the name is
It's crazy how you get every single little detail right when there's no one left to tell the story
What happened to the dog ?
Who was the old man if only u use discerptions it will make it easiers
I live in VA about a hour from the Application trail....
What a plot twist! You have a great way of telling stories
So they live out in the woods away from people,ambulance was there in minutes?
MrBallen, you tell stories the way I do.  I'm very animated about it and I even insert sound effects where I need to.
If you’re dumb enough to go to a place called “dismal lake” you get what you deserve.
Infuriatingly dragged out. A five minute story stretched out to 26 minutes. Totally unnecessary.
22:31 I think maybe that was the reason for attacking Sean and Scott
Are these actually legit like what I mean is I remember randle but I don’t remember the story going like that the space that would have be since both incidents happen is very long
Scott is one of my best friends almost see him everyday
I'd hate having to hear country music too.
why was ricky/randall nervous about the murders in the beginning if he was the murderer? Sometimes this kind of storytelling is so convoluted.
I never understand hiking/camping unarmed. At the minimum it can be a great signal of distress along with being protection from all kinds of predators.
Dude that was insane. Wow. What a Kerrrrazzzy story ...
I love MrBallen's camping stories! They're amongst his best. Reminds me of the "do you know how to get to Bells Canyon" story
You'd think probation for people that intentionally kill Innocent people wouldn't be a thing.
Ricky Williams was a hell of a running back sad to see how his life turned out
Great storytelling.
Wait it was May 6th 2008??? That's the day I was born!
I’m so relieved those two men are okay. You really do have a way of telling these stories cause I was convinced Ricky was the good one.
So if I want to lose weight I should just get lost on the Appalachian trail..? Giving up million dollar ideas AND telling spooky stories?! You’re the peoples champion! Sign up for my weight loss program! 5000$ for a two week wilderness program;) plenty of calorie free air and diarrhea inducing terror!
Does anyone else hate MR Ballen compared to MR nightmare
But what happens to the dog?
He sure had balls!  *real photo of testicles*
I've been homeless in a tent in the woods in the most recent months... & It's always very disturbing to hear some of these MrBallen stories about all the things that could go bump in the night in the woods. 😬😳😅
I’m from Roanoke where the hospital was
West virginia or western virginia?
When you said “I hate my neighbors” I thought you were bouta say a no no word
Ain’t no way they paroled a murderer 😭😭. This story was just a rollercoaster
Ngl I haven't been keeping up with mr. Ballen but he still messing with the like button and that just cracks me up😂😂😂😂😂
Do you do dogman stories❤
Plot twist fr
So glad these men survived. But I bet they will think twice before offering kindness to a stranger again, which is the saddest thing about this story.
I went camping for the Eclipse with my friend and his toddler. we were winding down for the night and this toddler is putting up a fuss not wanting to go to bed, and this dude from across the site brought us some logs for fire as a peace offering because he had his generator going ,and he started telling us a story of how a couple of campers were killed in that area back in 2003 when this crazy homeless guy with a .22 in a ghillie suit decided to kill these two campers. it was fucking scary.
he is like the guy from the end of The Descent Part 2 lol
I am blind and you are a great story teller, an i feel i am right yhere watching it.i miss reading books and watching movies.
we need more Appalachia stories
Never thought I'd see my local hospital on Mr B.Allen video!
Thank you for pronouncing the 2nd A in Appalachian trail correctly. I grew up in those parts and idk why but it always irked me when ppl pronounce it without a long A sound.
You’re a good storyteller brother. Thanks.
I was expecting Ricky to be the victim here, that ending really got me flabbergasted. Masterful story telling as usual by Mr Ballen.
Our penal system is obviously too soft as they let a completely deranged man out of prison. This happens far too often.
What a weird way to tell the story though.
This is my first video from this channel so I’m not familiar with his style of story telling, but this twist was crazy I never could have seen that coming
Good twist. This could be a good movie!
love listening to you ever since i passed away in 09'  listening to you has really help the time pass by !
The fact that it’s called “Dismal Creek” makes me already not feel very good about going. Names have powerful meanings behind them. And if you ignore them it can be your end at times.
The whole time I was thinking that hope the dog survived
Your podcasts aren't the same without your smile, and constant recycled habd gestures 😂 . Cant stand not watching you tell the story. Come back to YouTube please.
Loving it and thanks for your time and great stories..
Boy...that escalated quicky.....i mean that really got out of hand fast It jumped up a notch. It did, didnt it.
The best story teller💯💯
It’s the spirits of the slaves playing banjos
What happened to the doggo tho?
Sean & Scott vs. Evil.
Black Star Canyon ca is definitely worth a look up. Tribal drums and cults. During the day its a peaceful hiking spot. But at night it's no bueno.
Live about 20-25 minutes from there.
Wow! an incredible story! N when it comes to run fool, he has soothing voice but I would def prefer more of a voice like Mr. E Files, he has such a unique voice bc his voice hits different octaves
What's the AI service you use for those pictures they came out extremely well detailed
Well people say "I want to enjoy wilderness and reconnect with nature" they forget that Nature is all about eat or be eaten.
One of the best stories!! There's no way you can foresee what happens.
Glad sean and scott survived. Also that twist made my fucking jaw drop
Dude, your story telling abilities are amazing. I wish I had this talent.
App-uh-latch-in
damn, sounds like wolf creek
Mr Allen is the best! With a B!
The only way I’d go camping in America, is if I had: a German shepherd, a truck, a great torch/flashlight & a pistol.
All of the videos i’ve watched of Mr.Ballen’s i have enjoyed , however in that time ive grown to wonder what beef does this man have with the like button 😂😂😂
Wow!
Man, that was quite the twist. I was so confident that Scott was going to be the killer. 😂
@MrBallen  Would you stop jestering at every spoken word, please? It's the one thing that ruins your story telling.
I don’t understand when Mr Ballen says “ Subscribe to OUR channel …. So you don’t miss any of OUR weekly uploads.”😂😂😂  I don’t ever see anyone but him 😆
Wtf does nobody care about the dog?! We get nice updates with pictures and shit about everyone even the killer but nothing about the innocent pup. Not even confirmed if ever got fed like Ricky.  Still diggin this channel though 🫶🏼
Having to piece together these stories is annoying just tell the story in a linear fashion ffs. I don’t understand why everyone loves this style of story telling it’s sucks. The many useless details and making it way longer than needed is insane.  The first 10 seconds of the preview at the end proves my point.
Man one of my friends told me a different episode was not scary but just funny so now that I realize non of these faze me this wasn’t even disturbing
Oh my gosh this is on I Survived!!! So cool to hear it another way
This cap s many holes in this story
Love your vids ... have watched dozens of them
So he may have killed a dozen or more unknown victims with no traces.
I suffered two strokes last year at 51 years of age and have some eye sight deficit. I listen to your videos/stories when I’m conducting my therapy. I really enjoy your story telling, keep up the good work brother. 😊
He killed them the say before I was born
Dude, the way you told the story in this one was so good. Giving us details about 2 hiker killed and telling us who killed them then diving into how it went down was amazing. You completely messed my head up but it was so good.
Are you sure you're not talking about north umberland county 😱
Im so confused, you said that Randall died from a blood clot 4 days after the car crash, but you also said that Randall went to prison for 15 years, was released and lives with his mom.
I love run fool! It’s different than Mr ballen but equally awesome!
Yeah, I went camping before and ran out of beans nearly halfway through the trip. I had to eat the San Francisco treat the rest of the trip
what happened to the dog ?? it looks like the blood clot that killed randall is karma
Wow this one k*cked my ass!! Excellent story telling.
From a personal point of someone who is from Appalachia it’s pronounced app-uh-latch-uh
This is what happens when you take away the death penalty.
What's with the weird long pauses during stories. I mean, I get the commercials but why these long pauses where nothing's happening and I'm just waiting for the rest of the story. I'm kinda tired of that, not sure, if I'm gonna continue to watch. I just don't understand the purpose of them. Maybe if the purpose was explained to me I'd get it, right now, I'm just annoyed period
Certainly one of the best stories you've told, MrBallen! Very well thought out, dude!
Thsi would be a wiched thriller movie
A video on my hometown? This is going to be great! I've been fishing at the EXACT spot where that photo was take many times.
What happened to the dog???😂
Whats funny is if u google DISMAL CREEK VA,  first review: " great place to hike and camp.."😂😂
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG😭😭
So you told fake story in beginning ? he wasnt nervous or scared since he was a killer you just made that up to build a suprise larer... cringe and annoying your old videos were better
A couple years ago (I was like 14) me and some friends decided to hike to the top of a mountain for cell service at around midnight.   Miles from any other people. We’re all from West Virginia and have been told not to go into the woods at night. A massive snow storm had just passed. We made it to the top. Tried to start a fire but all the wood was obviously soaked. So we start getting mad at eachother bc we’re freezing and not getting service, we’re arguing for maybe 10 minutes when roughly 50 feet away from us in the tree line we hear a female voice scream followed by a calm “help me”. We said nothing and essentially threw ourselves down the mountain back to the house. We all slept in the same room that night and barely talked about it since. I have chills and tears in my eyes from even typing it and remembering. Stay out of the woods at night dude👍🏻
**Best storyteller EVER!!!**
Ok...as an avid LISTENER on Amazon, watching the videos of you speaking is weird...lol! Are you actually speaking in real time on these videos? Seems like you're "lip-syncing" with a voiceover.
⚠️DO NOT READ COMMENTS BEFORE AND WHILE WATCHING. MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS⚠️
I knew once the police went to the campsite I knew Ricky was the culprit.
Wonder if Randall ever thought about respecting Mother Nature by not killing the humans she produced
Well Mr Ballen is going to be in trouble when somebody lights their neighbors yard off 😂
I live in Georgia and I’ve heard of this!
Get another crazy and extraordinary story. I always love to listen to these while I'm doing housework I put it on high volume do what I got to do and get to listen without Nickelback things stuff that needs to be done around the house and sitting on my tablet or on my phone. I always loved your podcasts. What I find really cool is the number of people who actually follow you and I didn't even realize how many people I know are part of that group  .I was talking about some crazy stories that I knew about that I had heard from you and I was telling them while I was working and someone I work with chimed in and they said you really got to hear this story by this guy that puts a story up every week and I listen to it and look forward to it. After she told me this crazy cool story that she had heard from you, she told me your name and I was like wow I listened to him and look forward to his stories too! Then someone else chimed in and said the same! You have such a following and it's amazing but everybody knew exactly who we were talking about ... and for anyone involved in that conversation at work that day who was not following you, they are now.😅😊😊 never stop we all love your posts thank you for all that you do
I am now hungry for TROUT. YUMM.😃😃
Did anyone think Sean and Scott were the bad guys at first?
Wow did not expect that plot twist. i had to rewind just to make sure i was understanding what happened right lol
Wheres spike?  Be careful.
He is faster than you know and has many wives supposedly.
10:36
Man darren hit me with a bubble I was not expecting!
I have some gifts for the nursing home for next year.  Choose your slippers.amd robe.
Stories with twists are the best ones!
When MrBallen said Ricky turned around and there was a loud explosion, I knew what happened. I'm normally oblivious and don't guess the ending of stories, but I knew this time. Still a crazy story, tho! And MrBallen told it perfectly, per yuzh.
Well done.
....and then Ricky asked Sean and Scott "do you know how to get to Bells Canyon?"
Murders 2 people and gets parole after 15 years. That’s the worst part of this story and a disgusting fail from our justice system. It’s insane that a person who sets out to murder people, not crime of passion, best of the moment, domestic, just a cold blooded killer and they let them back on the streets.
roanoke memorial hospital? so this happened near me? i didn’t know about this.😭
The storytelling in this was ABSOLUTELY incredible. I had to go back and rewatch the whole video with the post-video knowledge 😂❤
Gotta tip my hat to that good ole "borderline disrespect". 😅😂😊 Thanks Mr. Ballen for more great content.... I've been smashing and obliterating the like button a lot from your "strange, dark, and mysterious" stories...
Sean knew that guy was dodgy, straight away.
... Bro, you look tired ASF...
As soon as i heard him talking about some music being disrespectful to the trail I knew he was a nut job whacka-doodle 😅
Mr ballen needs his own legit show
Imagine being shot in the face and chest and your pal in the neck and back bossing it still
I bet those circled things on the map are areas where he buried his other victims.
I didn't know about the code on the Application Trail.
19:00 whut? Ricky walked away and reacted to an explosion sound that was infact him firing a gun, WHUT :S
Insane plot twist.
Crazy dude decides to try and kill two innocent guys for flimsy psychotic reasons.  They both survive.  He dies while trying to escape.  Dude was probably suffering a lot from his mental issues and situation, but when you're being that much of an unstable threat to be around, karma hits you back no matter your excuse.  He had to be stopped, and if that wasn't by justice, it would be by irony.
Knew from start who killer is when meditation and connection to nature got mentioned
Just FYI: It’s “App-uh-LATCH-an.” DeSoto named them after a meeting/spending time with an Indigenous Tribe in Northetn Florida and Southern Georgia names Appalatchee (that is the correct pronunciation). Sadly, they no longer exisit now😢. Survivors of disease/violence were absorbed by the Seminole and Creek.) Apparently, it means:  “What lies over the River.” DeSoto went north Georgia,  Crossed a river and saw mountains. —Sincerely, An Appalachian American (I live near Asheville, so no banjos or  dating of cousins here)
Spots circled on the map may be where he buried his victims??
What about the dog???
I was worried about the smell old man. What a twist😅
Seriously what is this man’s problem with the like button
Wow, I literally thought the hole time that Sean and Scott were the bad guys, did not expect that twist
This case really scared my grandmother. The family had been going to visit Dismal Falls for decades piling into the back of a pickup, big family affair. The trips stopped and now the falls are a tourist trap.
Is it just me feeling bad for the dog 😭
Wow. This one had me chewing my nails. Excellent Mr. Ballen! Didn’t see that one coming. 😊
Who else dances to the theme music?
I was confused when Ballen said that Ricky was starving to death in the middle of the woods. I was like, "if you are hungry, and the fish isn't bitting... just go home??".  That was a huge plot twist, at first I thought that Sean was going to be the dangerous one.
May sixth 2008 is my exact birth date
Everyone always likes creepy stuff but they never like me
This why I don’t go into nature (secluded areas) anymore. Especially as a black person at that. Too many psychopaths in the world.
How in the f#ck do you get paroled for good behavior after a double homicide? What? The lives of the ones killed don't matter? Sickening!!!
I’m truly relieved to find that they both lived. I also love the photos of them both too. They definitely look like nice fellas.
What happened to that Dog?
@northwestwind
I live in Giles County Va..Randell Smith was actually from Parisburg..
Dang it Ricky i trusted u
26 minutes on 1 story ? you mad cuz its a simple story not rocket launch manual advert clinging bstrf
For the second story, I was anticipating the surgeons somehow being able to use the husbands heart to transplant into his wife.  But the actual story was just as good.
Good story tho thank you
This story feels fake
Wtf did Richie get into this why did he kill
Crazy. Cool story.
I love the way you describe a 50 four-year-old man as Old and frail I mean come on really.   If that's the case at 55 and I should almost be dead even though I can run circles around my grandkids
How you can obtain all the facts events and details process it all and orate it all in a easy to understand well spoken flowing dialoge amazes me. Your stories are so interesting and the way you present them is grabbing. That's why your uploads get millions of views. Congratulations on your thriving channel
Wouldn’t be surprised if that guy stole the underwear from his moms house…
wat happened to the dog of the bad guy that shot those 2 guys?
I grew up a few miles from Dismal Falls, I loved it and the area is beautiful but I always was cautious with those things that had occured in that area.
Funny 1 liners  😅😅😅
So Ricky was the killer lol
I bet those two guys have added a few items to their camping list 🔫
May 6, 2008 was 3 days after I was born
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG THO
I think the dogs name was Bo
killers should NEVER be released from prison!!!!!
He should of never been out of prison in the first place specially for double homicide
Rather than thinking the trail was his home he probably saw it as his hunting ground
Well researched
Nah thats Blind Owl from Canned Heat in the thumbnail
Watching the episode on court TV. I survived it was cool to get to see both programs mr.ballen included stuff that the show missed
It’s not Nills that’s bullshit
Lets be honest, the picture captions are the real entertainment of these awesome stories 😂
What happened to the dog!
21:16   Maybe it's just me, but he’s a dead ringer for Anton Chigurh from “No Country for Old Men.”
More power to you boys! Don't let a random nutcase disrupt your outdoor adventures ❤️
Boi, you get deep with that like button😅
Great storytelling!
Look just stop going on the Appalachian trail. Loads a weird shit happens there and it's the perfect place for psychos cause it's miles from help on foot. That's the beginning of all horror stories.
Wow I would have thought I was done for if I was shot in the neck. Will to live is amazing for both of them. Good story didn't expect the twist and never heard of it before.
These two men are absolute units.
I'm not a true crime fan, but you are a damn good story teller.
It wouldn't be a surprising fact if it turned out to be that randall decided to murder sean and scott as a some sort of sacrifice for the things randall believed, about nature, about where he felt the most home. Also the carvings in the map could have been as marked places of where he wanted to sacrifice his next victims, or some places even were already used as sacrifice points. If that is true then these marked places were like holy sites or churches to randall, where he decided to sacrifice people. Maybe sean and scott were only the first victims of his greater plan to sacrifice more in other marked places. Of course everything with a grain of salt. I'm just speculating.
I just clicked this to say that the real horror story here is that people go camping when we have air conditioning and housing. You deserve whatever whack stuff happens to you by those facts alone 😭😂
Sounds like traditional Satanism there church is nature. Human sacrifice is frowned upon but not un heard of with in the community. This is just one example of some one who was caught. I think labeling him mentally ill and leaving it at that give him a free sleaight in a way. The man was a Satanist.
“The other woman” I got whiplash
Sean and Scott need to start carrying firearms for self defense
"the Appalachian trail is generally safe"....
Just goes to show, never asume and never abandon your gut. Literally,  i was thinking that scot was the killer but no. Wow great story
what happened to the dog?
So you can kill 2 people then get out years later…parole board should be put behind bars.. pathetic
Rest in peace 🙇🏼‍♂️
what a turn of events🫢🫨
I waited for the end but we still don't know what happened to Scotts dog?
Watching your arms flailing all around in the air, your enthusiasm with all of your hand gestures are so annoying and ridiculous that I can’t concentrate on what you’re saying. It seems as though you are targeting the deaf by all of your dramatic hand gesturing. It gets frustrating after so long that you can tell you’re doing it on purpose but you look absurd. It does nothing for your channel but turn the viewers off, it does for me.🥺🤷🏻‍♀️🙉
❤
Luv the way u tell ur stories
I absolutly love the content and the way Mr Ballen tells this stories, but, that Run, fool! Podcast is sooo aweful. So hard to listen more than a few minutes.... Huge miss from Ballen studios in my opinion
I like everything about MrBallen, except how he talks with his hands...so much...over and over...
I might've missed it but I wonder what happened to his dog
I started listening to RUN, FOOL! a few weeks ago and I love it! If you are interested in lore and storytelling, you should definitely try it. Also Rodneys has the perfect voice for it imo.
Didn't hear anything about banjos
Why do you always encourage people to bully the like button 🥺
when you're watching a Mr ballen video and a picture of the hospital you were born at pops up on screen
What happened to the dog?
I do hate my neighbor west of me no respect for neighbors space
Person in id looks like young Anthony Soprano
Did I already know how this story would end? Yes. Did I still watch it? Also yes.  I’ve actually already seen this story on Dead Silent. Great show, if you are really into these types of stories. But it’s crazy what happened in this story. Letting him out on “good behavior” after murdering two people is wild to me.
This story made absolutely no sense at all 😅
Ok… hear me out, as someone who spent the beginning of their life in ohio(Appalachian) we had mountains even tho that map didn’t really show that, it has NEVER been safe to be anywhere on those mountains, never.  Disappearances, attacks, creatures and feral people the safest place those mountains have is parts close to town and even then tons of people just went missing… Appalachia is never safe.
Love your work. It takes a lot of time and effort to research and put these videos and podcasts together
man im glad i live in south Georgia where you can go fishing and hunting without people bothering you... its just me myself and I
I would enjoy listening to this guy if there was even a sliver of truth in anything ive ever heard him say.
Dam!! That was a story and a half🖤
Does anyone else feel the urge to protest upon hearing, “So, that’s gonna do it…”?? 😅
My girlfriend of 3 years broke up 💘💔❤️‍🩹with me during this video, love your content keep it real Mr. Ballen. I'll continue to enjoy your videos!👽👍
Not a real photo of Ricky's fishing line. 💀
OH MY GOD. The TWIST in this story. My mouth was just hanging open.
All those circled spots were probably people he killed...I wonder if they ever checked that out.
You should do a story on the Yablonski murders. It's a fascinating story of national importance.
Good story🙂
So if Ricky/Randall ended up being the killer, how do we know he was nervous about Sean and Scott cleaning the fish with their knives and then was relieved when they put them away? 🤔
Thanks for making the Appalachian trail something NOT TO DO  !!  Great STORY telling!!
To me,it's so unfortunate & depressing that 2 kind hearted,caring men,even still as being strangers,are off of this earth & lost their lives!There's always more room for more good people like that! 😢
I'm so pleased the guys survived. I had to re wind the video. I  couldn't believe the name I was hearing. After rick had said the two guys were  not right, I thought he's the nice guy. How wrong was i
I'm building a small shelter for my new pup outside since I couldn't sit and watch I'm  playing this video ful blast on my bluetooth speaker,😂😂😂 neighbours are on their veranda,terrace,roof all looking towards me,I hope they enjoying the story as much as I'm.
Rather interesting wouldn't it be.
and serounded be degenerats who like bumping me and my family im blind and kinda stokeished may have been and continue to be getting set up from the cp to move my mouth and brain the wrong way and derection on atuo  pretty much just got to sleep on it is all i acan say lolor not lol

Your jokes about the like button can easily give troubled kids an idea for revenge
Amazing as always!❤
Randall did NOT age well.  Just saying
you are an awesome storyteller buddy, definitely subs
i'm so glad sean survived, he's really cute <3
I had to watch this twice woah
Police be like ricky when I catch you ricky, ricky, ricky when i catch you ricky
I think it's wonderful that they go back and didn't let this man ruin something they love.
this was a good story
As a banjo player my feeling just took a hit
Good one
i absolutely love the way you tell these stories. the order always has me on edge waiting for what is going to happen next i love it so much! love your vids!!!
This is such horrible writing. Where did the quality go
✨Emaculate✨ Storytelling
As an Appalachian American living in Appalachia, I am not sure where COUNTRY music played in the forest is disrespectful? It’s not like it’s Rap or Norwegian Death Metal!
What happened with the dog??!
❤️
You are a good storyteller.
YIKES!
Your storytelling is immaculate. I was invested the entire time!
Mr. Ballen, you should check out voice artist Ryan Deatherage. He's fantastic.
What got me was that virginian drivers license
I am new to your channel and it's very very good! Thank you for amaizing stories!
Where does the “I hear banjos” come in?
As soon as he talked about chanting to himself like an *sshole, I saw the twist coming.
I was not expecting the twist
I mean..... Wtf Forget hiking manners bro. 😂
Wow, thank Gosh both of these men out simply fishing survived, this one John, the way you told the story per your norm was awesome, but you got me...I thought the single dude was innocent throughout most of this, great coverage, thanks so much~~!
I can't believe they survived that
Listening to this the only thing I could think of was professor McGonagall going sheer dumb luck
24:46 But what Happened to the Dog 😢😢😢
Did randals dog die in the crash?
Paroled for murder, yet people taking selfies in the capital getting 25 to 30.
But what happened to the dog? That is clearly the most important thing here. WHAT HAPPENED. TELL ME YOU SON OF A BITCH! I hope he's happy and still a gud boy.
I love watching your videos with my dad you always make them so entertaining and make me want to listen more. Keep up the good work
I was expecting the other guys to be the killers…..mind blown!! 😮😮
SPOILER  I like how the story starts from the killer's perspective without knowing it.
Sean being a big boy saved his life
MrBallen you should start putting secrets in your videos again, I feel like people always liked that
Amazing that they both survived and basically made a full recovery. Sean and Scott are some tough guys.
So good voice
You're still so good at telling stories. Love it
Run fool is a show? I can watch or only listen to it??
But what happened to the dog?
I wonder if those circled spots on Ricky's map were of ideal places he wanted to murder more people. So not yet places he murdered but places he felt would be ideal for his murders to take place. As for the clothing, who knows?
I can't listen to this with the constant mispronunciation of "Appalachian". Yes, us North Carolinians take it seriously. Especially with a husband that graduated from Appalachian State University! Please check your pronunciations. Thanks.
Once a killer always a killer
Randle Lee Smith should have gotten life in prison for killing those two people I believe they where women, we heard about those killings this made the appellation trail seem so scary and formidable we never wanted to go there and then this let the killer back out goes to the scene of his last murders and does it again when will the parole board learn and where was this guys parole officer supposedly keeping an eye on him?
He murdered 2  hikers yrs earlier ....and yet was let out to terrorize again ....slipped through the cracks .
Gf
Whenever I hear the term "Appalachian Trail" in any of Mr. Ballen's videos, I know that shit is about to get down.
I love it when the victims survive to tell their story, and go on to have a better life then their attacker ever could have
Sorry......... No one tells a story like Ballen and the podcasts do nothing for me.
Wow. Was NOT expecting that at ALL.
Think Shawn got a bad vibe about Randall 🤨
Good behaviour??? WTF 🤨
OH SH*****! Some people are just evil!
Very confusing. So Ricky was the killer?
Is run fool a saying or a reference to that movie the people under the stairs?
Whats the purpose of hiking again? Because it seems dangerous but y'all keep going
Death sentence needs revised 😊
My grandfather, who was a forester, told us to see everyone in a forest as criminals. You can always change your mind; if you don't, you might never get the chance to do so.
OMG 😮This story gave me the chills
A murderer like that should never be allowed out in public.
I think i saw this on some show i watched. It sounds familiar.
The 2 guys are just absolutely hardcore. Just be careful on who you help. My family already had a bad experience in helping. Sometimes those people who you help will bite you in the neck. Just like this story.
wow, this just proves you cannot trust anyone. You will never know what sick thing people think
Great story!! Run fool is also a great podcast 👍🏽
Too much filthy language in the Run Fool podcast.
I like your rendering to this video I have seen this many times you did a great job narrating thanks for the truth, and it's good to remember the tragic B's.
This guy sucks. Takes ages to get to the point. Too American. Nope
Great Story And Pretty Good Ending With A Twist!
Poor guys!😮 im so happy they made it!❤
Ever since my friends and I were just teenaged boys, we never camped with just 2 of us. Always 4,5, 6, 7 or up to 12 to 15 of us. Good numbers to have when you're off the grid. Camping alone, hiking alone, hunting alone, anything alone out away from civilization, is dangerous. Aside from accidents, wild animals or even just natural causes that may put you into an emergency situation, there are also mentally deranged people out in the woods, where many like to hide. Not everyone living away from society is a psychopath. Some just like the peace and quiet. But that doesn't mean there aren't any psychopaths living out there either. And for those psychopaths who do dwell off the grid, for a lone camper, hiker, etc. If they find you, and their intent is a violent one, they're able to do what they want with you and no one is going to know anything is wrong with you until you're reported overdue to return from your little solitary adventure. You go out there to do that stuff, you're far better off with a big group. Alone you're a sitting duck. I think it's stupid to venture off alone in the wild. Even with just 2 of you, that's not great odds either. Especially 2 women or a man and a woman. 2 guys are going to fare better most of the time, I know that people will say that sounds sexist and I don't care. It's time to get real about this. Violence against women is so incredibly high in this country. For the majority of predators, a woman is who they're looking for which is going to force women to take measures to protect themselves and I'm sorry, heading out certain places alone as a woman is just stupid. I get so upset when my wife does that crap. She's so stubborn, like most independent people. But damn it, there's being independent and then there's being stupid. Some of the risks she's taken have just been stupid and careless and makes my stomach upset knowing that these deranged animals are lurking in plain sight most of the time. It's ok for women to not be so polite to strange men who approach you. Screw his feelings, read "The Gift of Fear." And take the authors advice and warnings VERY seriously. I know this story is about 2 men. Who survived! But WHAT about the 8 pairs of women's underwear they found in his tent? Who's are they do you think? MrBallen is right, we will never know. Might be some of the women from Missing 411. David Paulides books, read them. We've taught ourselves to ignore our 6th sense that alerts us of danger. We do so because we value politeness in society over everything. Screw that! Value your safety first!
Once he said "a man was covered in blood" I knew exactly what the plot twist was going to be.
Umm i like you telling us stuff Mr Ballen
Source?
OMG... you have a way of telling stories that keep you on the edge of your seat and heart thumping. True talent
I absolutely love Run Fool! I love the way it’s told from his pov. It really immerses you, and the plot twist is always so satisfying! He’s so good!
I knew Ricky was the killer
WHAT HAPPENED TO RANDELS DOG THO !!!!
If this doesn't scare you away from camping I don't know what will. This is crazy.  Love Mr ballen story's.
Talk about a heel turn
Who got a perddy mouth?..🥺
What happened to his dog?
Not an actual photo of Mr. Ballen
How is the dog?
"You gotta purdy mouth, boy. SQUEAL LIKE A PIGGY!"
i wonder how this guy finds so many chilling stories
Being familiar with this area of the Appalachian trail,  I'm quite familiar of the dangers associated with hiking alone.  As an experience hiker, the first rule of thumb is that one never hikes alone.  It's too dangerous. Sounds repetitious, I can't stressed that enough 😎
What happened to Randals dog because I feel bad for that dog it didnt do anything wrong
He didn't like the music
wtf
You're pretty good at taking stories that you know that everybody already knows, and acting like it's a new story! I already knew what story it was as soon as you started setting up the circumstances!🤣
“Dad, why is my sister’s name Rose” “Because your mother loves roses” “Thanks, Dad“ “No problem, strange, dark and mysterious delivered in story format”
I love these stories so much
These details are horse shit. Zero chance anyone in the history of ppl has brought their birth certificate camping. Lol Never before has a birth certificate come in contact w the canvas of a tent.
Really love your content and style Ballen. You know how to draw viewers in and the stories you have are fascinating. Keep entertaining!
What about the dog?
The names confused me.   Ricky is the loner, the one with the dog who meets sean and scott.
😂 the Appalachian trail this is going to be good I love how you say this is a safe trail considering that my entire family has banned me from ever hiking on this trail alone I think it's probably the most unsafest trail in the United States my family doesn't care where I hiked as long as it's not the Appalachian trail😅😊
Mr Ballen you quotes for the like button is hilarious keep up the good work!
☹️🙁🙁
Man I totally thought Scott and Sean would be the killers
If he was a Satan worshiper they were probably, “blood sacrifices”.
PLOT TWIST
Fuck Ricky, any asshole who don't like country music especially while in the woods is a really real asshole.
I can almost gaurantee you that those knives he had were "trophies" because There's no way, you're going to be out in the bush lugging all those knives around. 2 or 3 yeah, but 30?  I love knives myself and I would take a large 9-inch knife for big tasks in the woods, a smaller one for food and/or fine work, and a neck knife for back up. You can't surivie out in the bush without a knife unless you harsh 'caveman' it. But that guy there, clearly had those as trophies.
0:26 oh trust me I would if I could
This is classic ballon!
My hope is he just collected and hoarded stollen goods from other campsites. Still perverted and mentally ill but hopefully no one else was hurt
He served just FIFTEEN YEARS for that first double murder?? WTF.. I just cannot...
What happened to the dog?
Fun fact… people that are convicted of murder, sentenced to death and have their sentence carried out, reoffend 0% of the time! Use this knowledge wisely.
What do you mean JOKE it’s….. NOT A JOKE I am bearly starting the video so stop
I haven't watched Mr ballen since last year, just started watching again, seems I have a lot of stories to catch up on lol.
How does a person spend less years in prison foe murder than a drug dealer who spends 20 plus years!!! This system really is a joke!
Why would u ever came with out a gun either for predators be it man or beast
Omg you certainly know how to beat around the bush lol
This story has hokie holes in it.
THERE SEEMS TO BE A SHADY STORIES ON THIS FAMOUS HIKER ROUTINE IN APP. MOUNTAINS. ALWAYS TRUST NOBODY WHEN ON THAT HIKERS ROUTE .MANIAC OUT THERE. DRIFTING PEOPLE 😮. STAY AWAY!🤨🤔 22:57
I hate it when I encounter people out in the Mountains while I'm scouting an area to Camp or Hunt and hear them blare Music really loud, To me Imo, it is 100% Disrespectful 🤷🏻‍♂️
ONLY DEMOCRATS, are dumb enough to free coldblooded killers. 😩
Apple-at-cha
Bro lead up a true story like dude who was a serial Killer had a good reason to try to kill these guys in the woods. 😂 another YouTuber trying to profit off a Murderer not surprised.
I mean, his nickname was "Lyin' Randal" so I don't think we would've ever heard the truth from him even if he hadn't died in that car accident 😂
R U ON SPOTIFY
Banjos. Probably Taylor Swift
You're wondering why I don't camp any more??  Yeah??  MR. BALLEN!!!! That's why. lol....but seriously
I'm gonna have to circle on back around to this one. Nine and a half minutes was enough for me.  Laterzzz.
Wow
Why isn’t the unsaid rule of “helping anyone who you run across that’s in need of help” be applied universally. Great work as always.
Am I the only one wondering what happened to the dog? 😂
I wonder what happen to the dog😢
👏👏👏
SPOILERS:  Ricky was "apprehensive" and "on edge" about being in a location that was close to past murders  .... that HE committed?  Mmmm, unreliable narration shouldn't really be a thing in Mr. Ballen's stories, IMO.
👎👎 I remember when this guy was entertaining
What happened to the dog??
This story really doesn't make much sense the way you tell  it!
Ok man, so I don’t mean to just be critical, just trying to clarify. I’d never been to your channel or seen any of your videos. I tried this one out in good faith, and actually enjoyed it. Well, I enjoyed it until the twist ending, which is the point.   What I’m trying to clarify..  So then, the whole first part of the story was, what, gaslighting before the fact?  Everything leading up to the noise was just pure invention for the purpose of misleading?    What the guy fishing at the beginning was thinking, that he was hoping for someone to come along to help him, what he was worried about, his reaction to hearing a male voice, his weariness of the guy the voice belonged to, his embarrassment at having divulged so much to the 2 campers about how he felt about the land, how he felt about the music from the radio, the whole thing about his concern of the knives when they were cleaning the fish, his relief when they were finished, his discomfort and reason for leaving the camp, and finally his shock at hearing the noise, which he of course ends up having created. Just pure invention, all of it?  I guess I’m just wondering, why not tell the story from Scott’s point of view..?  ‘Guy traveling along the trail alone, friend stayed back at the camp, surprised when he comes upon a lone fishermen seemingly in need of help, invites him back to their campsite. The 2 campers grow weary and more concerned as the strangeness of their guest becomes more and more apparent the longer they’re in his presence..’ kind of thing. Why not do that and trade off the twist ending for not having to make a bunch of stuff up in order to mislead and make that twist ending possible?  I’m gonna subscribe and watch more of your videos either way, just curious to know why if you’re telling what’s meant to be a true story..
Mr. Ballen, thanks once again for an amazing video, I really enjoy your storytelling and can easily get lost inside your stories!
I don t see why a killer wld keep clothes that aren t his if they re not to his victims.....
Definitely misleading storytelling….
❤
Why are these repeats???
Had a feeling Ricky was the culprit when Mr. Ballen said the police heard chants on that recorder
Who the hell goes camping and fishing without a knife?
That was a huge twist! I love listening to your stories Mr. Ballen :)
We  gave you just a second, we didn't like it !, we love you, lol
Great video.
what kind of 'fisherman' goes out fishing without a pocket knife
The circled spots on the map is not places he's killed, it's kill caches.
Ballen why do you hate the like button so much lol!
Weird!! 😮😮😮
Bruh
Called it!
31  0 0
That’s weird seeing Roanoke memorial hospital, that’s in my hometown What’s also crazy is how far Dismal creek is from Roanoke
i pray that ricky never gets saved and goes to hell and i don't feel bad for saying it
This story was on “I Survived” told from Sean and Scott’s perspective. It was chilling hearing their perspective, the way he couldn’t see anything but barreled toward his truck after getting shot and finding Scott on the trail and stopping to pick him up. I can’t imagine. I’m glad they made it through  the ordeal.
One second he said 11:27  I'm a instant fan😂
It’s called “grit”. Courage & resolve. Strength of character.
I love watching your stories. One day I hope to start from #1 and watch all your videos...i enjoyed your story about your friend who was in the military who went Rouge and went to Africa to help people like in the underground railroad after seeing how things were done in Iraq and place.
WOOWW really had me thinking it was the 2 people who he was with that killed him. Thanks man made my day before school
You have a weird narration style. A bit deceptive, for dramatic effect.  Ex - Apparently Ricky heard a loud noise and looked at the camp site. And they are all looking at each other - when you tell us it is Ricky doing the shooting.  Also, Ricky who has been camping here for weeks felt scared & apprehensive when he heard a noise. Because there had been a murder there (turns out Ricky himself was the killer in those murders too).
What happened to the dog?
Wow great video
Run Fool is soooo good you guys
Ricky sounds like a weird mf Damn...i called it
i saw it coming when ricky was mad at country music heard about the campsite 😂 still good story
I HATE MY ROOMATES 🤣
I don’t know how to go to a sub Reddit but I have a good one and don’t know how to get it to you. It’s from a murder in Bixby Ok in the 90s. I think you would love this story. I knew the kid that did it his brother and the girl he killed.  It has some really crazy twists.

I bet Scott and Sean are more careful when encountering randoms on the Appalachian trail...
But what about the dog though
Scott and sean are such bad asses
(Not a real photo of Ricky's fishing line)🤣
Can people near confirm that the Appalachian trail was EVER a safe place? that confused me....
Why do you keep unsubbing me??
Me just wondering what happened to his dog 🥲
Eeeeech!!!
Randall is proof that life in prison is a good thing!  How did a convicted murderer lawfully get a gun?  I’d say Randall is a serial killer..
I honestly think this is the best Mr Ballen story twist I've heard in a long time
What happened to the dog!?!?
Barns is good but, I prefer ballen storytelling. He is just better in my opinion
Never trust skinny people or fat people or, any people.
Im glad I didn’t listen to this before backpacking for 4 days on the Appalachian trail this past week.
Here I am thinking that Randal was the one who was gonna become unalive. All along he’s the one taken lives, it’s true you can’t trust someone by how they look. Thank God they lived!
Sounds like his killing field? All the clothing, glasses, ect.? Wonder about the dog?
Now I wonder how many paroled murderers there are, walking around. This makes me not want to trust any stranger.
I'm sure he's a serial killer they never should've let him go let alone 15 years
Paroled ??? It must be a joke😮
What happened to the dog?
Man, the like button has been through it all. Sometimes it’s just silly little pranks, and sometimes it literally felonies
And they would never invite anyone old or not to their camp ever lol. Human are more dangerous than animals out there.
Sean and Scott are absolute UNITS!
Don’t get me. Wrong I love your stories
This video is 10 days old I’m pretty sure I’ve heard this one befor
How can you be paroled after murdering 2 people.
The handgun was a .22LR revolver.  Anything larger with a greater round capacity and the outcome would have been much, much worse.
You can just tell by looking into the eyes of that Lee Scott character that "there's nobody home". Pure Psychopath; the eyes always look "dead".  There should never be any kind of parole for people like him.  Early release for good behaviour ? Bollocks !!    Remember, people: IT WASN'T GOOD BEHAVIOUR THAT PUT THEM IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE, WAS IT ?!?!?    Let them do their time - they've earned it !  Keep your sympathy for the victims..... 😢❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Subscribed!  Hell YESSSSSSS
damn!
It's hard to watch with all those hand gestures I get dizzy
"MY FISHING SPOT!"- Randell
There's a little video on your advertising
Mazing that ambulances and police arrived so quick. I live 25 minute walk from the hospital and 5 minutes from the police station and you would be looking at an hour wait for the former and god knows how long for the latter.
randall probably ate his victims
*Spoiler warning*   I’m so glad Sean and Scott both are still alive and still enjoy life in the great outdoors. They truly are strong for having survived that nightmare. Although, I’m sure they now think twice before inviting strangers to their campsites.
What happened to the dog 🥺
It’s weird listening to these and knowing the twist because you are so familiar with the story.  😅
Yep. I was raised right near the Appalachian trail in va./w.va. line
I like that your hairs growing back out! I really miss men having hair because for some reason, men always have such nice hair. Sorry, woman of the 60's and on. I'm 63 and I just love a man with gorgeous hair!
Every time MrBallen posts one of these, it’s another reminder that if I ever go camping, I go in a large group of people and not too deep into the woods
So at what point when he was walking away from their campsite did he obtain a firearm to start shooting everyone? It doesn't sound like he had anything with him?
I went back to this video and found out it wasn't just your usual murder story because they actually survived. Survival stories I'm all for, very glad they did. Also I love how MrBallen tells it in a way that always leaves a twist at the end, making it seem like the old man was the victim at first.
My wife likes to tell me that it's pronounced App ah latch ian
Lol dammit I thought Ricky was the good dude because he had the dog 🤣
I can't stop seeing how much you talk with you're hands after a friend mentioned it to me 😮
❤❤❤❤❤
If Ricky is running outafood, why didn't he simply leave the woods and go home?
Wonder what kind of good behaviour did a killer of two displayed so as to get patrolled really insane 🧐
Big fault in the story - he says the ambulance was followed to hospital by police car and how the ambulance sped off then. Says they got airlifted to hospital
Never go camping without a gun.
"Real photo of different trout" 🤣
Not mentally unwell he just plain straight evil, through and through.
I’m so happy to hear those men are still alive!!
I started listening to your podcast, then discovered you were on YouTube and I must commend you on your fantastic storytelling. It’s truly amazing.
This was the most bizarre way to tell this story… For the first half of the story, he’s describing Ricky/Randall as feeling “uncomfortable” and “nervous”, but I can’t see that being the story that Ricky/Randall gave the police… It seems more like Mr. Ballen kind of made all that stuff up to “build the mystery” of the story.  Odd.
tienes que hablar sobre YouTube aqui en Estados Unidos quieren prohibir tik tok mucha gente cree que no importa pero si ellos quieren hacerse mas ricos y eliminar la competencia
Dang it. I spoiled it for myself by checking the comments first only to make sure doggo lives
Run fool! is really good.
Haha!  I currently have a sign in my yard with an arrow pointing at my neighbors hours and it says, “mow your yard!  You don’t even work!”
Trust no one. Always be cautious.
I could listen to this guy all day, who needs TV
I hate what those men went through, but for once it’s kinda nice that the victims aren’t female.
@MrBallen you really should do a episode on the Sorger murder that took place in Ephrata WA, my friend at the time woke up one day at the ripe age of 11, and was going to take another childs life...the week before that we had a sleepover at a friend's for a bday party, n nothing pointed to a boy who I knew for years, was going to kill another kid. But there's more to the story I'd love to fill you in on man.
I’d love to live in America & be able to camp wild Appalachian trail is my dream. Unfortunately I’m disabled so I’ll do it through your videos lol 🎉🎉
Liberals and there stupid fucking "Rehabilitation" smh this dude was obviously a psychopath
On a side note to the usual excellent story telling, I really do enjoy the ‘Run, Fool!’ Podcast!
what!!  what a plot twist...
What a story! Im glad they survived and the bad guy didnt. Im also happy ithis didnt stop them from returning to the woods that they seem to love. Sure didnt see this ending coming!
great guys for wanting to make sure he was okay, i'm glad that they've continued doing what brings them joy.
Could have done without the "satanic ritual" garbage when describing the ramblings of an insane person.
You know they go back to that creek armed now 😅 idk how you could go out there unarmed after something like that happens to you. A literal living nightmare
Will never understand the sick mind of a psychopath
Yeah southwest VA be creepy like that
Ok but what happened to the dog?
I love listening to your stories but man... get to the point 🤦🏻‍♀️
Me and my 6yr old daughter love listening to your podcasts n channel we love it 😊😂❤🎉
I have to name Steve Stockton from the channel Missing Persons Mysteries as one of my favorite voices 🥰 Perfect to listen to when you relax and want to rest your brain from disturbing noises!
But what about the dog?
Is this place near the sarver hollow shelter? Scariest night of my life.
As a child and former girl scout, i went to Girl Scout camp right across the Missouri River from Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. Talk about the stories told around those campfires.......
Crazy fact that I just learned today: My step dad was in Dismal creek 2 days before Randall attempted to kill those 2 men. Makes it even scarier to know that he was in the area the same time my step dad was.
What happened to the dog?
Maybe I'm out the loop but I keep wondering why you don't post new 411 content Mr.ballen. I really liked the way u did it. It seems like you just stopped one day. Please let me know anybody on this content.
This was about two of my best friends in high school.  Just shows you that your life can change at anytime good or bad.
00:11 —lol 😂😂😂😂😂 yesss! 😂 0:48
The like button needs to press charges on MrBallen. It already has other content creators advocating for it's getting smashed but MrBallen advocates for the complete destruction of it's life and belongings.
I have heard that the two women who were killed were partners..maybe that was a different killing.
Yup…this is what happens when we allow killers to go free.
what happened to his little dog
Why did I read the comments before finishing the video 😬
Am i the only one that wants to know what happened to the dog? Lol
This is a tragic tale but at least the good guys survived. My thoughts on this is that IF the police really want to find the bodies of those that Randal had with him - they would need ground penetrating radar. Why? Well, besides the obvious that it can see what is underground - the machine is fairly light and now it has a tablet computer that you attach to it and the tablet records everything to an SD card (like a 512GB card). It is supposed to be accurate down to a millimeter squared area. Now - does this mean a skeleton would just pop out? No. What it means is that instead of having to go through by hand through (I don't know - a mile maybe) the ground digging everything up - instead, you just do the walk through, it keeps the logarithmic location of where you are AND when you examine the map - it can tell you exactly where you were standing. (And not by going "There you are!") So then you can just go to that location and dig. Also, the police could use the new Lidar they are using to see ancient cities in the Amazon even though the cities are covered by dense forest. So they can find interesting places to examine - or - then take the ground penetrating radar unit to that location and walk around on it to get a better view of what is there. I am thinking that all of the forestry services should be given both of these instruments to help locate lost people as well as dead people. It would certainly cost a lot less than the money spent on our military.
I'm sorry I do think your amazing and usually I love the way you tell stories, and I know everyone's like woah clever... This one just annoyed me. If you wanted to go from the killers perspective here you should've built up his connection to mother nature more in the beginning and given us more of an insight into his mind rather than just what he might have thought about the victims - which you basically just said he felt nervous to see people BC of the murders.... Which is just false.
Something tells me Ricky wasn’t hungry after all…
I did the gas thing on my neighbor's lawn and I got arrested. At least the pigs allowed me to listen to Mr ballen in the cells 🎉
These things in these "stories" is why I'm always packing. Better them things than me 😏
Thank God Sean and Scott are alive ❤🙏🏼
I didn’t think I would, but I really Love Run Fool… the episode with the little girl looking for the hit and run driver who killed her and the Goat man are ones I have listened to more than once!
All of this guys videos are total horse 💩
What a crappy narration, as well as a delivery!  Wordy, exaggerated, with clownish gesticulation. The Internet has polluted incredibly in just two and a half decades...
The way you tell stories is awesome, new follower here and I like how u talk about the like button 😂😂
I just thought of a good idea for a dark comedy about two serial killers (who don't know the other is a killer) one who's hitchhiking and one who picks up hitchhikers on a road trip trying to kill each other
Directions unclear. My neighbor Ike Button is suing me for repeated harassment.
i like how u told the story with the initial perspective that Ricky was the protagonist..well done sir
But I need to know about the dog!
I love that the community of people who like horror stories are mostly just loving and awesome people 😂 my friends and family cannot relate to my enjoyment of these stories
This is why I use night vision, carry a g-n. Two just in case. Believe me. You feel their weight. Every ounce feels like a pound. Every pound feels like a brick. As you keep walking for hours up n down hills.
Please STOP with the hands soooo annoying
Blaring  country music anywhere is disrespectful
So if he was starving and there is a trail and he can get to a town or even house why didnt he just go there
The moral of the story is never blast country music
TM podcast is stealing your work. I have been listening to your voice without realizing it for hours. TM podcast runs continuously after I watch one of your videos
Once a murder always a murderer they’re just sick people they can’t help themselves
I know that the non-Americans will give me shit, but again, this is why you bring a gun when you go into the woods
Note to hikers, some hikers are more friendly than others. Grandma might give you some cookies, but that 26 year old single mom will give you some...
great job telling this story
But what happened to the dog???
Recommendation for the next like button joke. “Next time you see the like button, hand them a pair of roses and bend down to toe your shoes then get up and take the roses and walk away.”
Hahahahaha!   Yeah right Navy
I’m sorry if it’s not appropriate… but when I saw the thumbnail my brain didn’t see the words, “I hear banjos.” My brain saw those letters and constructed the words… “I bear handjobs.” Lol
I love run fool run. His voice is great and I like his style
Dude . This is exactly why you don’t fkn let MURDERERS OUT OF PRISON . I’m livid . Just watched another video where this dude had been convicted of kidnapping women 3 different times & was released every time & he kidnapped another female for the 4th time & severely beat her w a bat . Our entire system is fucked .
Sitting in a tower cabin in the forest with the cool breeze and  peacefully narrating a story is amazing 😊I can feel the vibe ❤
What about the dog though…
what happened to the dog?
The whole first 5 minutes im just thinking “ricky when i catch you ricky”
Why only shown in 480p ??
Now  I  know  you  have  keys  to  my  mom's  house... you  stole  my  driver's  license.... enjoy... I'll  just  get  a  new  one  online.... petty  🙄
I knew it. I’ve been on the MrBallen bandwagon too long
You are the best storyteller … I love how you made it sound like ricky was going to be the victim in the beginning… but that twist was so shocking!!!
Run Fool! Is a wonderful podcast and Rodney’s voice is like butter
Scott and sean survive bc their behavior was the behavior teching by our only true Savior jesús christ they found What they think was a poor soul in need and they help waiting nothing in return god bless them
Please, Apple-at-chin.
Anybody who have a brain WILL TELL you oh the food getting low time to GO HOME!! Wtf is I’m missing. White peolpe I tell u
How does a double murderer get paroled after 15 years, ffs?!
Umm white peolpe and then woods.. will never learn but keep going in them woods so we can know what’s gone behind y’all dumb ass actions.. All love tho just call it how it is..
Whoooaaaa!! Plot twist!!😮
I’m getting “The Hills have Eyes” vibes. *shivvers*
I guess blasting music "disrespecting" nature was enough to attack
Knew something was wrong with Ricky
Absolutely disgusting that he was released I’m so glad these two survived
Paddle faster I hear banjo music!!! 😊
My cup hit the counter loudly right when mr b said “bang” in the sentence- rickey turned and heard a BANG sound. Love these silly overlap moments.
Wow
His dog lived and was adopted according to a Reddit thread I found incase anyone else needed to know 🖤
Ricky when I catch you Ricky
Watched him for 3 years or so,sick now,whilst Ballen is a good storyteller  , his advertising  and many other platforms is making it feel more like a money maker.
There is no “unspoken rule” that you just freely give up food or take care of anyone you meet on the Appalachian trail. The unspoken rule is quite the opposite. You are responsible for yourself, and if you need to ask for food to survive then you are jeopardizing someone else’s ability to survive. I could tell something was off from the moment Ricky was described as a scrawny guy constantly leeching off others for food. Literal human leech
New podcast we would appreciate your support @chase&akil subscribe and like
Was like Wrong Turn in real life. & the dudes still got a dog??? Which is odd for such a psychotic person.
Wow! That was a solid twist John! You narrated that insanely well bc here I am (probably like most others) thinking this frail little guy is totally gonna be the victim…
If anything happens to this doggy, I'm down voting and not watching the rest 😢🥺
They shouldn’t let you out just for good behavior
Just wanted to take a moment to hype up "Run, fool!"   I was on the fence about joining another story-based podcast, cause.. how could it get better than Mr Ballen himself? For a couple years, at least, I've had MrBallen as my only source of YouTube stories. To hear anyone else's voice telling me stories of the strange, dark, and mysterious was simply not something I'd considered.  Well! A few days ago,  I decided to give "Run, Fool!" a shot, and I have not put it down. Whenever I'm in my car, or playing games, or cleaning, I've been listening to Rodney Barnes tell stories. 17 episodes in, and I can't wait for the next one. His delivery of vocals, his uncensored language giving a personal touch, combined with the Ballen Studio method of story telling, and all that comes with it is a perfect blend for spooky stories.  As a side note, I've noticed many people (myself included) have noticed the lack of supernatural horror stories recently, leaning much more into true crime stories, "Run, Fool!" is where they seem to have gone. So, I'd encourage anyone to check it out!   #TeamBallen
What i don't understand is how did he get Rickies perspective in the first half of the video and then say they don't know why he attacked them in the second part? Did he just make up the first half to add some excitement to the story? 🤔
Come on ballen "womens underwear"? Dont tell me your gendering crap too
Definitely one of your lesser videos intentionally set up the twist . Kinda annoying actually lol
i think most of the stuff he had was just stuff he picked up from other camp sites
So I know this story but I appreciate how you told it in a different way. Nothing unfactual in your telling but different from the way most people tell it. Sorry I was struggling to find the words to say what I was trying to say lol. In much more simple words good job 👍🏼
Ok but what happened to the dog??????
He probably just rifled through people's campsites he came across stealing food and other things...like the ladies panties.
BALLEN SEEMS LIKE A FOOL TO ME WITH THE STUPID LIKE BUTTON SUGGESTIONS, NO FUNNY SORRY.
Yes, but what happened to the dog???
I’m glad that both victims survived and the killer didn’t what a crazy twist
Sounds like hills have eyes!
Well for starters they can't really be to far out in the middle of nowhere if police got there that fast!
Once again anyone that goes on a hike like this and doesn't take any kind of protection is just plan not thinking! Period
Was this in "western" Virginia or was it in West Viginia
I was taught if your in the Appalachian mountains and you hear something no you didn’t and if you see something no you didn’t
Rodney Barnes (sp?) is not a good narrator...
Good ending surprisingly
Bro, you said when they got to that lady’s house and knocked the door when she answered the door, blood was pumping out of his neck and now you’re saying that the hurt dude was in the Jeep the whole time
Where is the banjo lol
The American justice system is insanity on steroids. Freeing killers  😢
Now I need to know what happened to the dog…
I tried your suggestion on my neighbors yard, (whom I dislike), and I ended up in jail. Please explain what I did wrong? 😁
Rodney barnes is definately not soothing lmao. you're overselling that trash, but this was a good video
Hi Mr.  Ballen,  your videos are very addictive while snacking on some junk food and I'm loving it.   😁 Blessings to you from Trinidad and Tobago 🇹🇹😊👍🏾
Why are you trlling your viewers to commit hate crimes by setting someone yard on fire with the words. I hate my neighbor. Thats ehat white supremacist did......whats wrong with you. Are you a white supremacist?
Make more videos❤
So is this an actual incident, or a creepy pasta sorta thing.
And here I thought Ricky was the innocent guy... Great story...
Im from Virginia and still here.. glad this story found your channel ive been a fan since the first episode! Also thank you for your Service!
So this dude is famous for telling someone else's stories. Amazing
Very clever telling the tale from the killer's viewpoint so I thought there was a 4th guy hidden in the woods. His fear at being with Sean & feeling nervous at Seans size. Lotsa red herrings to confuse just like M. Night Shyamalan would do.  Certainly confused me! Great story Mr. Ballen 👌🏻
I’m so happy that Scott and Sean didn’t let their encounter with “Ricky” ruin their tradition of camping and doing what they love. They seem like truly kind men
yay a camping story! finally!!!
Your story telling is literally unmatched👏🏼
Hey Ballen, DO SOME MORE 411 STORIES!!, theres that new movie about 411 cases (its not great) but you might be able to jump on some algo stuff!
Serial killers usually wear their caps back to front. Just think about that ?
Hey MrB. I thought for sure it was Scott and his buddy. Wow, what a story that’s crazy anyway, I hope you’re doing well Mr. Ballin thank you so much.👍🏻
This was a plot twist for me lol i was feeling for Ricky😅
Appalachian Mountains.. pronounce it as Apple-at- chia... or we may throw an apple.. at ya😅
When you were describing him before he met scott I figured he had to have a gun. Nobody stays out in the wilderness without a gun in america.
What happened to uploading 3 times a week 😔
Tf I was unsubscribed.
what the fucc
Just hopping on to reiterate what Mr.Ballen said about Run, Fool! It’s hands down one of the best podcasts I’ve ever listened to and I cannot wait for next weeks addition! Rodney Barnes is a remarkable author and storyteller
Another great episode Mr Ballen 👏
Please take that stupid  cap off.
Does anyone know what happened to the poor dog?
*GREAT WAY TO TELL THE STORY!!*
Hi
@mrballen please do make a video about “Devils Kitchen” a cave in Kodaikkanal India. There is an interesting story about how 11 friends visit the cave and one of them gets trapped in the cave.
You should do an episode on the haunted room at West Point. Room 4714. It's a great story and very creepy. The room stays boarded up to this day.
Okay so the thumbnail made me laugh...  "I hear banjos... The terror
What happened to the dog though? Was the dog ok?
*Abysmal Creek 😳
It apears many who use the appalachion trail believe a knife to be a defensive weapon until they realise to late, I should,a  braught a rifle.
Not just the best storyteller on YouTube, but the best storyteller in the history of storytellers
How in God's name do you get out of jail for good behavior after murdering two people? There should not be any parole possibility when you take a life yet alone 2 lives. We've given people the DP for less and almost always keep you in jail unless it's like self-defense. They are 100% responsible for the victims that he had after those two women including the two they know of and all the ones they don't. Smh. Do not let murderers out of jail it's really that simple
I agree that this is why these psychopaths shouldn't be let out of prison.
God might of had his protection on Sean and Scott. If they had the holy spirit I think they would of had a bad feeling about Ricky. From what i understand and hear from other people the holy spirit warns us of danger.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Incredible
Man, how you framed this story is great!
Always glad to see new Mr. Ballen🫡
He was a cancer
Is the dog okay?
i feel like the podcast host needs a deeper voice
That definitely was a strange story! Thanks for sharing Mr Ballen! 😊
The stories you tell about people lost in nature are the most chilling to me. Keep them coming please (poor people 😢)  Incredible twist on this one!
What happened the dog?
What happened to the dog?
Geesh I never look at someone and think eh they’re harmless. People can always surprise you.
Hey news flash for anyone that doesn’t want the story spoiled. Don’t go to the comments before you’re done watching it.
I really enjoy your stories.  It's Very Well Done  and Interesting, where you want to listen to all  the All these Stories.
ballen i have watched you for 2 years nowand every upload is a absoulute 10/10 love you man
Dragging……….
Damm i stopped to go do something during the brake.  Restarted the video and was so confused because i forgot everyones name😂.  Took me a minute to realize who was who.
Does anyone else find the overly wild and exaggerated hand movements of MrBallen distracting?? I assume they are to retain our attention. Maybe a podcast would be better for me.
Gr8 story !
Is this a repost I swear you've told this story in a different video I listened to awhile back?
I just wanna know what happened to Randall’s dog
What is this direct text thing? I made a comment and got an emailed response to it. Is this spam?
Did not expect that ngl
How can MrB get it sooo wrong with "Run Fool"? It sends me to sleep (during the day) ☹️
M Night Shaballenon
❤❤❤❤
The plot twist of this story is insane.
But, what happened to the dog????
OK, what happened to the dog?
I still don't understand when Mrballen tells us to do something with the like button. Wth am I missing? Someone, please explain to me.
Recycling videos is so cool.
I'm not going camping any time soon
This story just seems so  fishy. You mislead the story but implying Ricky is well aware of the murders but he's scared and w.e when he was actually the killer. I care more about if the dog was fed.
20:14
21:20 it´s only me, or the dude really looks like Anton Chigurh from "No Country For Old Men"?
Great story teller 😊
Wouldn’t be caught dead in dismal creek

Hallo, ik geniet zo van de manier hoe je het verteld. Van alle andere. Die het ook doen, ben jij de beste. Dankjewel
Reminds me of the phrase "no good deed goes unpunished."  Good to know the 2 men recovered from their injuries.  As for the killer, he got his just desserts. Fate, as a result of his actions, brought about his death.
As this story went on I realized that I actually knew this story!  It was crazy to see the photos!
I still can’t get passed the undocumented details he puts in the stories 😭 “ He thought to himself” “ she looked at the sky, took a deep breath and smiled”
I love twists. You worded this story perfectly
The ball tickler at the end is actually hilarious lol 👏
What happened to the bad guys dog?
"Run Fool!" is chef's kiss 🤌🏻
What happened to his dog?
Trust me John, my neighbours are well aware
What happened to the poor dog?
Great story! You really had me going!
another exapmle of USA's failed health care system.
Why usa have so many psycho killers ...🤔
this poor like button 😂😂
I really thought Shawn and Scott would be the evil people, happy and such luck they actually survived.
What happened to the dog???? Please tell me they found the 🐕. Poor dog. 😮 Glad the guys are ok.
You did an excellent job of creating a "twist" for this one!
I had a feeling it was "Ricky"...ugh
Man, why is Mr. Ballen so mean to the like button? *proceeds to hit the like button*
Being suspicious of creeps is called discernment
Taking advantage of people's generosity. Tale as old as time.
How the fuck do you have this information like they look at eachother, it's all bs
Should be called Mr bullshitter
It's strange all those comments to tell us to do is very unusual. I don't know if it's part of your videos. But you seem to be a very disturbed person
Love ,   ya , .  But didn't care for the Gasoline joke ,.     At ALL.   .    BE NICE AND THINK OF OTHERS PAST ,       YOU KINDA JUST UPSET ME 😮
I love the way you told this one!
15 years for 2 murders
I listened to "run fool" for about a minute and half and realized it's just a woke story teller throwing in an occasional racial trope...nah I'm good..
PLOT TWISTYT
Anyone members the clip where a banjo off erupts in a the middle of a train and got so heated they summoned a full souhtern band? That's the notes that played in my head as soon as I read the title of this video 😂😂😂
https://youtube.com/@steve-the-gamer4649?si=YR7fOZdh4ednm_9X
3:20 I listen to my inner feelings
What gappened to the dog? 😅
Woah.
Is daily podcast your channel? Because they have photos of you in the thumbnails and sounds like you but more AI generated voice of you or a lower quality voice of you. If it is your channel I feel you should have it in bio. If not there is an imposter uploading as you daily…and I mean DAILY!
What is your next video MrBallen. Please comment to my comment.
Run fool seems pretty cool
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Run Fool is not my thing at all. I prefer the other podcasts, never been a fan of supernatural stories or ghost stories, I like hearing anything else. But still a big fan of u sir!
HELLO THERE M.R BALLEN HOPE YOU ARE DOING WELL, I ENJOY EVERY STORY LINE THAT YOU PRESENT BUT I MUST SAY THIS WAS BY FAR THE MOST INTERESTING DUE TO IT'S ENLIGHTENED BEGINNING TURNING A CORNER TO A FRIENDLY ENERVATION WITH A TWIST OF DARK PRESENCE WITH A HIDDEN PAST WHO HAD THEE ASSUMPTION OF DISRESPECT THAT TRIGGERED A BREAKING POINT THAT ALMOST BECAME A REENACTMENT OF MURDEROUS INTENTION, WHICH IN THIS CASE THE VICTIMS  SURVIVED AND THE KILLER PAID THE PRICE BY LOOSING HIS LIFE BUT OVERALL THERE WAS A HAPPY ENDING THO THE MEMORY WILL NEVER FADE AS SEAN AND SCOTT FREQUENTLY VISIT BLOOD ON THE MOUNTAIN 🏔️💥💪👍❤️
WHAT A TWIST
Topic I would love to see plz the Alaskan Avenger his name is Jason vukovivh and  I really think he should have a chance to be heard. If you could find a free moment I believe you would agree! Thank u
I am stunned those women opened the door ... like call police, yes, open door, no.
Or be given jobs as cops....
I love this channel and i love listening to run ,fool ❤❤❤❤
Wow only 15 years & paroled for good behavior, white privilege if you ask me. Im so glad this had a good ending, the monster died & the 2 guys survived continuing to live their best life ❤
Sup ballen ..i perfer your O.G channel .. no disrespect or anything
Man, I was on the edge of fearing for Ricky life. Hoping he could get away from Sean and Scott. But man, Ricky you asshole!!! For a second I was on your side.
That was quite a plot twist!
Apple-Atcha
Wat Garbage
Go to the like button and tell him to his face that the way he grows his beard looks like he’s got dirt on his face. 😝
Every time I want to  watch Mr ballen do u ever notice the top comment always ruins the story 😭 u want to get the like button to sort that out as He's the closest  fist to the  comment 👍
I am so glad that monster is no longer able to harm innocent people.
Ballin shot callin
Am I trippen or where there no banjios
What happened to the dog?
paused when i heard theres a dog, before i continue can anyone lmk if there's animal cruelty in this??
You need to do an episode on unit 731 the Japanese did live test on pows to develop bio weapons during WW2 and it was horrifying
OK, this reminds me of one of my favorite original "Twilight Zone" episodes.
9:06 9:08
Not four minutes in and I'm wondering why the Ricky didn't go just home as his food supply dwindled.
Nice of use to include the kilometers with the miles for non-American viewers (which I am not, but I have non-American friends).
So this story is fake ? How would you know what Ricky was thinking ? You made it seem line Ricky was gonna be the victim .
What happened to the dog
Has anyone else noticed Mrballens slight Valley girl accent. Lol
Wow Mr Ballen, you surprised me again!!! Great video!
I think you should start doing 'air-dicking' with your hands while telling stories. Call this story is about Ricky Stanicky
Reminds me of the story of how that famous American Sniper guy tried to befriend a veteran, but then realized “this guy is really weird” too late and was killed at that gun range
Just wanted to say that dude David that wrote the missing 411 book is smoking crack if he thinks a paperback book is worth over $130
Why is it you can go to jail for 25 years for smoking weed but only get 15 years for killing two people? America has some crazy laws
You Sir are The King of Flannels and Story Telling 🙌 🙏 👏 ❤️!  ₩€€£¥《》《》
Kudos to Jon Ballen for his whole storytelling channel and all, BUT.....I must finally say that his "Like button intros" are just plain stupid!    When I first heard them, I was confused, lost.  I didn't realize that he was just trying to be funny until 3 episodes later.  But yo, they just don't make any sense!  Either symbolically, metaphorically, or literally!  I wish he would just drop that part of the podcast completely.  They're not really that funny.  They don't really accomplish anything (including making us laugh), and they just eat up time, making his episodes longer than they need to be.   Just saying.
That monster butchers 2 innocent people on the trail and gets released after 15 years because he was a good boy in prison just to try and do it again, we have non violent drug offenders who have done a lot more time than that in our prison system but it's a violent murderer that gets paroled, our justice system is screwed, thank God Sean and Scott survived, i wish them all the happiness in the world
(NOT A REAL PHOTO OF RICKY'S FISHING LINE) 😱
Good this guy get on my nerves , talk and talk and talk ...lol
Just found this channel a few days ago. Great content, my dude, I am hooked.
Love me a good camping story.
23:15 Demonic possession is absolutely real and I'd say there is a chance be was possessed.
Absolutely did not see that one coming. Really great swerve.
Ricky Williams life definitely turned out different than i expected after football😅
5:00 I like to pretend that it ends here and everyone lives happily ever after as great lifelong friends.
Thank you!
I first read about this case in one of my favorite books 'A walk in the woods' by Bill Bryson. It's an amazing book about his attempt to hike the Appalachian trail as a middle aged unfit first time hiker along with his friend who only admits that he is an alcoholic when it's too late to do anything about it as they are literally in the middle of nowhere. Overall it's a lighthearted funny book which only made the chapter about this even more shocking. There was two other stories in the book that have stayed with me the first was about a random dude who just went for a short hike in the woods close to his house and the Appalachian trail of course but as he is a local and isn't actually hiking the trail he goes off trail through the woods when he comes across a small aeroplane that had obviously crashed into the woods and never been discovered, the skeletal remains of the pilot and one other was still strapped into the seats but in the back of the plane was millions of dollars and a huge amount of cocaine! It turned out the plane had sat there for around six years with nobody any the wiser, it was theorised that the pilot had disconnected the transponder and flown extremely low to avoid detection which is why there was no huge search party searching for the plane and it's occupants. Very quickly the other story was in a chapter describing animal attacks on the trail from when it opened right up to the year he wrote the book. So this guy got up in the middle of the night and headed to the trees to relieve himself but out of nowhere a huge owl swooped down and attacked his head with it's incredibly strong & sharp talons which resulted in the poor man being scalped, the owl flew off with all of his hair and a very large section of skin from the man's head. One more thing although they have made a movie from this book it is nothing even close to the book they went for cheap jokes and laughs and cut out all of the historical facts including every animal attack, violence or anything that could be considered adult material.
apple at cha. appal achia. appalachia
Please sort out the volume and sound. I get that it’s creepy sound but we should be able to hear you
Just unbelievable
Not to the end yet but DOES THE DOG LIVE
Was this n Giles county va
I was born and raised 30 minutes from Dismall Hollow. It's known for this and the haunting of a murdered little girl.
Another one bites the dust! 🫵🤡🐷🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
Mr. Ballen, maybe you could keep your hands still. It's very distracting.  It would be easier to focus on the story if your hands weren't flying all over the place.
So it looks like, to me, the reason he ended up shooting the pair, was because of the music that was played. Its crazy to go that far, certainly, but i get it. It drives me crazy to walk trails or kayak and the groups around me and my party are playing music openly. It truly is disrespectful because yeah, we go into nature to be immersed in nature. Not to listen to music. The forest has its own music if you have the ears for it. But i wouldnt actually shoot a man for something like that lmao
if you have to keep reminding us what happened you're not telling the story very well are you 😂 i mean god so much wasted time in this video just repeating what we already know
It feels good to be back
It's makes me wince every time I hear him say," we upload once a week."😢
So relieved the two guys pulled through and still enjoy life. What a nightmare for them. 😢 God bless them. 🙏
Ive loved all ur videos an believed everything uve had to say in them up till of u saying terrorists were the ones who attacked the twin tower's. When its already been made well known that that was an inside job done by our own government.
We’ve just progressed to hate crimes on the like button
I'm only 4mins in, but I have questions.  If the man knew all these things: that he was running dangerously low on food, that there's no guarantee he'll come across a helpful hiker with food to give, that there were a couple murders, that he himself is nearby the area the bodies were found, that a killer was never caught... Why in the world would he just stay there, fishing with his dog?  Already, the whole food issue with no guarantee you'll come across someone would have been enough for me to be like "hmm, maybe I should start making my way out of this." But murders in the woods, *_near where you are?_*  I'm sorry. It just feels like a dumb decision and completely off. It's a weird decision that just doesn't sound right. I do hope he and his dog will be just fine, and this is just a "close encounters" scenario, but jeez.😢  Edit: Ohhhhh. Oh boy.
I seen this on a TV episode good narrating Ballen
Always one of the best storyteller
Shawn and Scott seem like cool guys. Hope they’re doing well.   They’re the kind of folk I’d wish to run into if I were lost in the woods.
You ever do anything again on cryptids, please do one about The Big Muddy Monster
Hi love your vodeos. Do you have a second channel called TM Podcast? If not someone is using and uploading your content
What the hell man? Why did you lie about Ricky for more than 50% of the video? Why did you fake his anxiety to leave? Why did you portray his internal thoughts as if he was afraid all the time?   Straight up lies as a plot hole is not good man. Not coming back!
The Appalachians have hillbillies that live in very remote and secluded areas of the mountains. They are feral people and very dangerous.
Omg mr ballen i love your work can u please mention me in the next video pls i love u man ur awsome❤❤❤
That’s so crazy there are so many people out there that have Mental problems and no one knows it until something triggers it and after they ate and Ricky Willams AKA Randall Lee Smith was leaving then the men turning on there music Trigger this person he went from a man that just wanted to leave after he ate because he was talking about all that spiritual stuff about being out doors and he must of freak the two guys out what ever he was saying about being outdoors how ever he was talking these two guys they knew somthing was not right with him who would know there music  made his crazy come out and start shooting both of then that’s so crazy you can’t even go to a place of peace to camp any more that’s great they lived and  Randall  he’s I’m sure in hell now that was an evil person 👹👺👹👺☠️
Yo wtf happened to the dog ?
trembling
what happened to his dog?
Tbf, the moment I looked into the eyes of Sean 6:32, I could tell that he can't be a bad guy at all. Like look at him 🥺🥺.
There was a doctor in the early 2000s who killed his father in abingdon va left him on the creeper trail. That's the local name for it there. Cut off his fingers pulled all of his teeth out. There has been alot of bad things on the creeper trail.
"NOT a real photo of scott's bait" "real photo of different trout"  well done
Bro is this  a   Joke or something
Hey all :). Ive been away a long time getting into some fun hobbies but I had a minute to listen. Feels good to be back!
😅okay. I'm sure I'm stupid and didn't see that coming
Like a movie story,,,,,creepy
I wouldn't ever go hiking for far or for days unarmed or really alone, ever, lots of things can happen
Prò arío iñ  kiláb
I think the piles of stuff was just Randall cleaning up the forest, a sacred place. I think was triggered with the music.
https://youtu.be/TDETiMYnNTU?si=h5b7_QwUwIbJp3xa  This person is putting out Mr ballon’s stuff.    Disrespect and wrong on every level  I usually don’t comment but I think everything Mr Ballon does comes from his heart and life experience.    You can’t replicate that…
But the dog was okay right? Lol. I’m good as long as the dog was okay.
Is this for kids? Italian kid rock
After my pdsd goes away I will stop looking at Your P.T.S.D.
54 is old?
🎶Ricky was an old boy He has a heart of stone🎶
Fr fr, from " move along....to the end of that comment, was spirits in the suggested words area again as well 😂yeah 👌😎)
Your hand gestures make it on point. You're the goat storyteller
I had a feeling Ricky was going to turn out to be the creep. Mr Ballen really likes his plot twists.
Have you thought about putting 20 more ads in the video?
Love your stories in the woods, need more of your places you can't go and people who went anyways, me and my wife can't get enough of those. We've watched all your stories, your great at what you do man. 👏👏👏
What a twist! I had to rewind. :)
I asked my new neighbor what’s your name? And he told me Mike Sutton so I said nice to meet you and walked inside sat down and started thinking did he just freakin say LIKE BUTTON? So it instantly pissed me off went and grabbed my gas can and started pouring it in his yard trying to spell “I HATE MY NEIGHBORS” and the fire got out of hand burning his house down and mine, I currently on probation paying 500k restitution, will you help a brother out mrballen
Add a comment
Redditors on r/camping will tell you nothing ever bad happens in the woods
What happened to the dog Mr Ballen? I NEED TO KNOW THE DOG IS OKAY!!!!!!!!
I come back to mr ballen channle every summer. It just hits more when it’s warm and dark out. I don’t know why 🔥🔥 been watching for 3 years. Last you you had 3 mill now u at 8 milll 🤯🤯
But what happen to the dog!? D:
Maybe spend a few more bucks on your cap .  Guess it’s backwards when you ride your tricycle.  Probably pretty windy tho’.. 😮
You know, you're awfully mean to the like button when all it does is try to help you.
Love the captivating storytelling and ultimate, inevitable plot twists!  Never disappointed! Thank you, MrBallen. ❤️
you should do a story on albert fish
Yep 👍 run fool is good listened to every episode his voice to me is better than. Most so far 😂 ❤️ the creepy sounds 😂 he makes you feel like you’re actually there when you’re not. Can’t wait for the next episode 😁 And some episodes I don’t think I’d ever visit those locations 😂
Sean and Scott are legends, so glad they recovered
My mom died before I was born and she was a massive fan of yours MrBallen. I started watching after she died and I’ve already binge watched every video of yours in 24 hours. Your videos have helped me to help me. Thank you❤️
What happened to the dog?!
How to get to Bells canyon?
How in the HELL can u only get 15 years for 2x murks!!?? BUT u can more than that for nonviolent drug offenses!!?? 🤯🤯
Many years ago, I was once an international fugitive, wanted across North America and Europe. After spending years behind bars, I can tell you that the system will do more than you think if you just keep your trap shut and maintain good behaviour.
Mister Ballen is High Again.  ❤wink.
I’m willing to bet he was a cannibal too due to the fact he and his dog were able to survive off the land for so long.  And why no other bodies were found; yet their clothes, hats, and glasses were.  If u disappear but your clothes don’t, the only way that’s really possible is if someone ate you!  If an animal ate you, ur clothes would be ripped up and strewn about.  Not neatly stacked in a serial killers tent…
Sean is a Tank, good thing they survived
Not sure why such Mr. Like-Button hate, esp when he can generate $$. How bout try some Mr. Like-Button LOVE!?? 🥹☺️
These men Sean and Scott, are very strong to have survived this brutal attack. The fact that they still go to Dismal creek every year must mean they dont have PTSD. I think its awesome !
What happened to the poor dog?
Randall wasn’t mentally unwell. He was an evil man. He was getting old, he was tired of living in a tent, and tired of eating fish everyday. He just wanted to go back to prison where he’d get 3 hot meals a day, and have a warm bed to sleep in with a roof over his head. Randall was a loser.
What a twist. I wasn't expecting that. Very creepy.
The way you tell these stories Makes it 👍👍👍👍👍
Country music in the woods is disrespect but a knife in the woods cleaning fish is a menacing weapon... got it
If herd this story before on a channel about hiking on the apalation trail.lots of creepy story's about that trail.i don't think it's safe in parts
This is gotta be your best storytelling so far. You got me hooked right away, completely nailed the storytelling-skills on this one. Gj
I saw that twist coming..😂😂
Crazy how he can get less time then someone with drugs and he took not one but 2 ppl lives
Love that you started this story from the point of view of the killer!
The thumb nails on this guys videos, lmfao. I feel like I'm back in 2010. I'm sure it's working for him but it's a tacky as all hell and tacky sells baby!
He should have never been released!
What happened to the dog??
You do not look anything like I thought you would...... - a new listener
11:36 love Run, Fool! Rodney does an amazing job!
Awesome video!
Omg! They went to Roanoke Memorial! And the WDBJ7 footage!! I cant believe it. Hahaha! I should've guessed it was near there when I saw the guy decked out in VT gear. I lived in Roanoke at that time but don't remember hearing about this. Wild! When I saw the picture of the hospital I did a double take and outloud made an Aaahhhhh sound. Lol😂
🇨🇦 in the house 😫 any other Canadians watch me ballen🥳🥳
All the hiking/camping stories you’ve covered have taught me never to go hiking or camping. Bye nature 😂
holy crap mrballen SUCKS now lol, i cant believe you sheeple just eat this crap up
Im good on "Run Fool" I like the way MrBallen tells stories. He's the only story teller for me. 😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIZVTNt2Yx4
Talk about the plot thickens….
Really fucking hate forced ads the middle of videos... always an auto downvote
They would have taken them to Radford or Blacksburg before they would drive to Roanoke.
I just wanna know if the dog was okay. 😂😂
So he died 4. Days after and lived for 25 more yrs?
What a story Wow...
I heard Sean and Scott tell their story before. I'm so glad they survived
I don't get it. I starve as you tell stories of bullshit. GOODBYE 👋
grilled fish sounds really good right now
I havent subscribed nor liked any video.but i do watch the stories alot
Well how desolate was the house if police,ambulance turn up double quick Mr Ballen ? .
Sean and Scott are absolutely beasts
I wonder if Randall was mad about them infringing on "his" stomping grounds and playing loud music to boot? Also how does a murderer get s gun, wonder if they were able to trace it? Perhaps another one of his victims?
Omg wow
Didn't expect this story to turn out the way it did.
You have gotten so good at telling telling these stories, thank Mr John B Allen
Just goes to show you just how insane nature worshipers are.
Okay but what happened to Randall’s dog??
I could not find the "run full" podcast on YouTube. Is it on a different platform?
This was pretty disingenuous story telling. It isn’t clever to be telling us something from the perspective of someone, but then have it turn out that he was the one doing the things. You said he was worried about the killings, but he wouldn’t be worried about those obviously. You basically just misrepresented his inner monologue to try and create a twist
Looks like a young Gandolfini or his son, Michael.
I become a 4yo again when I listen to your stories. Criss, cross, applesauce. Hands in my lap, mouth agape with suspense. 😄❤
Judge!! Judge away people! We've been conditioned to "not judge" people anymore and let our natural guard down. If you have a weird feeling about something or someone, listen to it! And always keep your guard up and get trained to carry to protect yourself and family and friends if you're out in a life or death situation dealing with a evil criminal.
It’s Apple-at- chin… 😭
Wait so it Randell th3 guy that ate lunch with em
“Ricky” / Randell was in the wrong area of the Application Trail if he was expecting “ peace and quiet“. Idk about now, but in 2008 , Dismal was the place a lot of young people ( me being one of them at the time ) went “muddin’ “ fishin‘ , swimmin’at the falls. Some solely went to hang out , listen to loud music and drink. ( which probably explains why the police were there so fast 😂 . Even though Giles Co. first responders have always been on top of their game.) But, I  remember this happening. My brother  in -law was the cop who road with him to the hospital. Love your version of it ! I’ve been a loyal listener of “MrBallen” for years! Pretty neat hearing ya tell about an incident so close to home and some of those involved.
I knew it something fishy about "Ricky" when he said about liking to meditate and liked nature, and the police finding ritual tapes.
They probably set him off as soon as they said hello. 😂 honestly sounds like he was extremely disturbed. Glad Sean and Scott survived. Thankfully they had the adrenaline rush. ❤
What a brilliant story. So well told. I was not expecting that at all.
I went to the like buttons house, sprayed “ I hate my neighbours” using gasoline, lit it up ……. Oh my days, you’ll never guess what happened ….. I got charged for arson 😂 That’s the last time I take advice from Mr Ballen 🤣🤣👍🏼🇬🇧
Cant tell the story. Has to advertise in the middle. Dude you suck.
Me, from western North Carolina mountains, sitting next to my banjo 😮
So what happened to the dog? 🐕
if you hear Banjos here in Kentucky , well your fuc%&$ ! and do mean just that ! MrBallen has a purdy mouth !
"...I hear banjos..."  Oh God, they're getting closer! I hear them playing every time they creep to another tree, or Bush! They-they're everywhere! I can feel... I feel all my education & attraction to people who aren't related to me waning! What is happening?!?!?
That's the justice system for you
When he says "Western Virginia" he is referring to the WESTERN part of the state of Virginia. Not to be confused with West Virginia.
I sure wish his dog could talk. He'd have some wild stories. I'm imagining his voice like Dug from "Up" .. "Today master and I were chasing some campers. Those bad campers. SQUIRREL!" ..
I did that and got out of bail on Arson.  Thanks mr.ballin  I hate my neighbors
Randall was convicted before .  How did he purchase a gun ?
Mr Ballen needs to pin a comment at the top so that the first thing you see beneath the video isn't a spoiler.
ricky. when i catch u ricku.
Always carry my Glock in the woods. Too many weirdos.
The walking dead was right
Can you do a story on the Stardust Ranch in Buckeye, Arizona? It’s very very strange and it’s a mystery 🤔
Amazing story and love how you describe it amazing, but is anyone going to talk how the intro often about subscribe scenes be does? it's truly funny and I love to imagine it.Pretty awesome you didn't forgot about that after being in Youtube for a year now! Good job MRBALLEN!, I enjoy your stories and it's exciting to hear them!
Take your podcast away from the pay wall you were my favorite youtuber and Podcaster until you made that greedy move
We getting kinda violent to the like button I see
Damn what a plot twist
Anywhere you play country music it's disrespectful.
If you kill someone and your found guilty YOU SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO BREATHE AGAIN PERIOD
Dude what are the fucking odds that you do a video about the Appalachian trails this week.. my cousin and I just decided to plan a hike on the trails. We're literally getting together this Saturday to start planning our trip. I almost don't want to finish this lmao this is a mrballen video. We all know this doesn't end well. I'm going to be so scared now 😂
I have never heard this story, and it is a wild one!! Sean and Scott truly are meant to be best buddies!
Used too love these videos but with all the YouTube ads and then the in video ads I just can't take it anymore 😂 I understand you gotta get paid man but jesus, half the dam time were just listening to an ad.
In swedish, Ballen is slang for penis. Have a nice day.
Do a new stalker episode for educational purposes for the victims
whats with the dog tho?
I hate when the comment shown under the video is a spoiler 😒
A extremely
I loved how you started to tell this story. From the actual killer’s side instead of the victims. That was a twist thank you Mr ballen for this sad but good story.
I knew Ricky is the bad guy. And why do so many people go into woods without guns. Those two women living in cabin did not sound like had guns.
0:00 u better be careful some kids might watch this and take it seriously
Holy crap. I’m a huge true crime lover, follow many true crime channels/podcast etc but no one tells stories like this! Usually you know what’s gonna happen in the story from the beginning but this channel is SO different! Been binge watching since I discovered this awesome channel and have been genuinely surprised with almost every video! Best channel on YT hands down!!!
The plot twist ! Am I watching a movie?😂
Idk Mr. Ballen, that photo of Randall at the 23:00 mark looks like he's expired......just sayin.....
For me no one is better than you
The casual criminalist also did a really in-depth video about this case if anyone is interested
bro how u know all these details
It had to be the country music 🤷🏼‍♂️👍🏻✌🏻
"If I was Rickys Dog ,Knowing that my owner was beginning to get desperate for food ,getting thin and weak  ,I would definitely keep my distance from him ,,,( If you know what I mean ),,,
To the mad people in the comments. How about yall be smart and not read the comments until yall finish the video that way it won't be spoiled. That's common sense
Some of these stories are so long ago that the details are not actually what he says..
He shouldn’t have been in a jail he should of been in a mental institution jail just makes it worse
Never trust an old weird guy with a gun.
What if the circles on the killers map are areas he buried his victims at. The Police should have brought cadaver dogs in.

How many people did this guy truly kill, we may never know.
Not American. I live here but still can’t quite understand how a brutal murderer can be paroled? Bizarre laws over here.
Greetings. I've been a fan for nearly three years, now. I'm looking for a particular MrBallen story (it's an older one, for sure. I'd say one and a half to two years ago, maybe) About a strange man who was following a girl home from school, pretending to be a doctor, etc.  The police couldn't do much. I believe the story escalated to the man attempting to break in, but gave up, and later in the daughter saw her father in the kitchen, and it is implied he took the matter upon himself to handle. I just can't locate it so I was wondering if anyone remembers the title to this.
How did our system become so twisted that it paroles a double mrdr
Hello Mr.Ballen! Your content is amazing, could you PLEASE consider doing an episode on the "Real life Walter White" Dustin Hawkins 🙏
(Not a real photo of Ricky’s fishing line)😂 man you get me with these every time.
Been awhile love the vibrating logo
What happened to Randall's dog?
Happy ending. 😊
Are we doing the whole “people are called” instead of “people are named” thing like the British?  Odd
Wow  what a story of fate .. god was w those men that day 🙏
Yeah ok but more importantly, what happened to the dog?!
Stories about psychopaths arent scary stories . They are simply people killing peolel stories.
ballen the way you tell these stories is damn amazing, had me confused all the way you deserve your own damn tv series🙏🏼👊keep it up
I find your voice more attractive than Rodney!
Thank God they survived.
I knew it.  Who the bad guy was 😢 Had the feeling.
Creepy!    how do I get in touch with your studio about some content I created and am trying to get out there?
This episode is so damn stressful…Jesus H…seriously if you haven’t considered it you need to write some screenplays, what with your ability to pull the suspense of a story together.
But what happened to the dog?
We should get a compilation of all the ways to annoy, distress, impair, assault, maim, and generally kill the like button that we had so far...
But what happened to the dog?
Those are some hard a** dudes.. .So much respect.
It's hard to be charitable anymore.
This has to be one of the craziest stories I've ever heard! Holy batshit crazy 😧😧
Who decides to go fishing near a murder scene?!
Wow! Today I'm getting many vids from creators i love but i haven't seen in many months!
People, just carry a dang gun.  I mean, at least a revolver with rat shot rounds, if you're Squeamish about that thing. You can buy a 38 or 357 magnum, comma and put rat shot rounds In it, And have a less than lethal Weapon, unless you aim at the face of course.
The Appalachian trail actually starts /ends in Alabama at Flagg mountain. I've been to it and so why nobody ever includes it. Lol it's basically a big rock.
Who else gussed the ending right away 😂😂
Who else gussed the ending right away 😂😂
LMAO at “not a real photo of Ricky’s fishing line” 😂
I love you brother but once a week is killing me. I miss the 3,4, even 5 times a week. 🫡😔
Well, I ain't gonna shoot 6k rounds for home defense, I'll take that for that price. Would you believe me that PSA ar15 cost 150k pesos or 3000usd...😂
I was NOT expecting that plot twist 💀
54 is older and frail???!!! What an immature ageist remark!! There are men and women in their SIXTIES who are in a hell of a lot better shape then people in their 30s!!!!!!!!!!!!!  DAMN
.....but what happened to the dog?
THE DOG, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG ?
Why didn't ricky pack it up and call it a day if he couldn't catch any fish?
Mr. Ballet, your voice is so much better than that Run Fool .
I was a fan until YOU MR BALLEN SOLD OUT!!!!  ENOUGH TRUE CRIME!!!! GET BACK TO WHAT GAINED YOU MILLIONS!!!!!!! (YOU KNOW....GHOST AND PARANORMAL STORIES!!!!????)  THERES NOTHING!, ZERO ANYTHING, STRANGE DARK OR MYSTERIOUS ABOUT TRUE CRIME!!!!  NOTHING!!!!!!
Phill! I love how fast you talk; I normally watch/listen to things at 1.5x speed. Never change ❤
He kills two people and they parole him....The fact is there are way too many f'd up people working in our justice system....
Crap, as always Clickbait
You Obviously need Jesus telling people to do that crap to your neighbor
Incredible that Sean and Scott survived, and I hope someone took in the dog too.
Sean and Scott are the kinda dudes you hope to run across in a time of need. It's a shame 'Ricky' used their kindness against them. I'm glad they survived and didn'tlet that man's evil taint their love of the outdoors. The way MrBallen told their story was brilliant. Dude is a mastermind of storytelling. So glad he and his studios are bringing in other amazing storytellers to create the ultimate campfire story studio
This is why we need better gun control…
Way to go, justice system. Letting a murderer go free to murder again.
Originally I felt bad for the old guy.
"The wiiinding mountain roooad" 🎶😂
So much for doing a good deed on the Appalachian Trail.
"And the name on the birth certificate was...THE LIKE BUTTON!!!"
A person on a hike, camping trail, fishing, hunting, or camping does not have a knife to clean fish?! I just want to know how his dog faired?!
The one thing I’m wondering through all if this is…WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG?
Proof that no good deed goes unpunished 🙄. I hope they didn't lose faith in humanity
Why did u tell this story in such a confusing way ?  U said ricky was walking away from the camp site and as he looked bck there was a huge explosion sound and said they was all staring at each other in confusion not knowing where it came fom making it as they were all confused  wondering where it came from as they dtared a each other soooooo why not just explain what ricky did at that time instead of makin every one think that the sound didn't come from them that the noise was off in the distance and not actually near thr 3 men and make it sound like everyone was ok as they stared at each other in confusion then tell a whole other part of the story instead of saying he shot them
Blaring country music ANYWHERE is disrespectful!!  (OK, so is blaring ANY music...)
With navy seals you either get an extreme criminal or someone who does something great after
I heard this story actually from the guys that this happened to they were on the show “I survived”
What about the banjos?
Randall Lee Smith's mother died while he lived with her. That's when he moved out.
Hey Mr ballen it's rachael on my own page just had to put my page up as it's 1 more view aswell from rachael and philip dublin ireland ♥❤🇮🇪
Love how Mr.B calmly calls for calamity and calumny to come down on the Like Button's cranium ! Seagull Lung for President !
It tells me that God is above nature. Usually when someone disrespects nature is some ways, or take it for granted, that's the person paying with demise. But, in this case the 2 men were kind and helpful to the needy stranger, yet the two are viewed as not intune with nature's sacred undertones. In the end, this is the outcome that won. If the killer would have followed his path to full redemption, this ending wouldn't have been. What a story. I actually pictured them very close to the actual pictures. It can only mean that the story was told impeccably. That's why I love this channel.
Well, this time I had pretty much got what happened the moment you first mentioned the serial killer. Ricky was just too meek and useless in your description.
I peeped the comments.. and srory ruined.
8mins in and Ricky sounds like a paranoid schizophrenic whos not to be trusted. Let's find out shall we. 14mins in and I was right 😒
Gas is too expensive to be wasting it on the like button
As they say, no good deed goes unpunished.
I knew Ricky was shifty from the moment it's described how he thinks Sean and Scott are disrespectful for blasting music and then openly sharing his odd story about coming out there all the time to chant like a weirdo.
Typical, bring back capital punishment.
I was gonna complain about hand expressions, saying your cardinal arm movements are bad but naaaah storytelling format its right.
You need to stop dragging out the story and stop over dramatizing it with the over kill characterized drama in the story..
I like your background so much better than your other back ground.
that was one of the most unhinged Like prompts I've ever heard 😂😂😂
Im guna start a go fund me page for the poor like button
Could you do an asmr section. Maybe a female voice?
Deboning fish = fileting
Was this story featured on an episode of "I survived…"? Story sounds so familiar.
I got a real question. So you had a video where the guy that ended up that he had been knocked out outside of a bar. But he went on a total brain trip for however long. And you know he came to and had to get actual medical help to deal with the loss of the family he never actually had. I have tried my hardest to refine that one. I had a similar experience. And there is no way in the world that I could describe it. Except for the way you told that guy's story and I really need to find it so I can show other people
What happened to the dog?
I saw this story on “I survived…”! Such a trippy story!
I'm glad I watched this after, not before my camping trip 😂
RUN, FOOL is so good. Honestly. Would highly recommend it to everyone that likes the channel. 🖤
What happened to his dog?
Fuck me, that was a nice touch telling the story from the killer's PoV.
My old coworker is named Randall Smith, (Randy), and he just retired to go hike the Appalachian Trail. He’s. Or the same guy obviously, but still lol
If any of you were Scott, would you have run or stayed because of your friend being shot still being there, and then maybe try to stop the maniac, and more than likely get shot too?  Tough one.
Isnt the Appalachian forest haunted???
Don't read the comments if you haven't watched the video. Some 'genius' has spoilt it. Given away the plot.  Thank me after you've watched the video.
Always go with your first instinct when helping someone out. Evil has many faces
Watch out for Appalachian Trail!!  feral jerks live in there!!!!!!!
Hot Take: if they kill, put the animal down, they will do it again.
Mr. Ballen causes me to take a breath, then contemplate if I was in a Ballen frame of mind. Meaning; do I want to be creeped out, can I hang with a freaky, yet touching monologue? Do I, or can I survive sadness told in story form.  I’ve concluded that one’s Empathy Level determines one’s capacity for Mr. Ballen.
Gimme my daily MrBallen FIX!!!   AAAHHHHhhhhh...🤗! That's the good stuff!!
(Real photo of different trout) - these photo captions are the best!
I feel like your voice is the most soothing. I don't really listen to anybody but you, especially when I'm trying to go back to sleep, I just thought I'd put that in there. Love your videos and love your content. I've been watching you since you came out, and I actually found you on Snapchat. I've tried to put my mom on to you. I've tried to put my fiancé onto you. One of my best friends actually watches your videos, so he and I have that in common.  I love what you're doing and don't stop.
Idk why, but to me the intro at the start of the video, the music, while u are talking, kind of sounds like the song Bryce Vine - Drew Barrymore, I have always been thinking that I just finally decided to comment about it.
What happened to the dog?
But what happened to the dog?
The moment you said he didnt like country songs, i knew their was something weird about this story.  I love nature but camping out there, with great food and some nice country music just hits different.
Why do people go in the woods without a gun
So did the dog eat the fish too?
So let me get this straight, they damn-near get murdered by a stranger in the woods just to go back several years later wtf
A complete 180 on this one 😮
Before I finish this……does the dog die?
Good thing, David Paulides just put out a new book missing 411 Washington, so you have more material to steal
What about his dog? What happened to the doggo?
Why does it say I hear banjos on the thumbnail 😂😂😂 it's baffling me I need to know wth banjos has to do with any of what I've just watched? Still awesome video as always
>Killed 2 people >Only served 15 years  I think I found the problem.
Even randels mom didnt  love him lol. Randel is a loser
I don’t know how to contact you as I don’t have any of those other social media connections. Why is a Fake Mr Ballen Studios allowed to post your podcasts? Please let me know   Love your content!
Rikky.. like fucking mongoose right.
Maybe those spots he marked is where he buried his victims no one knows about. Like he scattered them around,and those clothes don't match the missing persons around there bc they weren't from there like maybe tourists/ppl just going on vacation there 👤?
These attempted murders were the dirrectcresult of a liberal criminal justice system.  There's no way a double murderer should ever be reased from prison.   Those who let Smith go free after 15 years are the true criminals.
Such unfortunate timing. That chapter literally just did this story. As soon as I saw the pics of the two campers I knew the spoiler😭You need to have a word with Mike 😂
What happened to the dog? Was he rescued?
What happened to the dog?
What happened to Ricky’s dog!?
An explosion?? Bro be reaching lol
Take my hat off to them policeman for keeping their cool with her
I hiked the Appalachian Trail in Boy Scouts and I got the certificate
Is the doggie ok ?
What happened to the dog?
I asked myself why the guy wouldn't leave to go get food instead of staying there
Run, Fool is awesome, I really enjoy it. But I gotta say, Rodney's voice and narration style, as well as the guy who narrates Bedtime Stories, has a sense formality to it, as if they were hired to narrate an audio book. And that's cool, but I think what distinguishes Mr. Ballen, and why people may gravitate to him more, is he really sounds like one of your buddies casually telling you some bugged out story, but he happens to be really good at it, and not insuccinct, and all over the place like most of our real friends and family lol...and that's comforting.
Man, i love this channel, but i cringe and click off every time he goes into a psychotic rant every time he wants to ask for a like or introduce a sponsor… man that’s cringe…
Mr. Ballen you are hil😂arious
The ID in the thumbnail threw me for a loop. I’m currently at work, around 3 blocks away from that listed address. Small World.
Why do people keep going on that trail?! Do they know how many stories Mr.Ballen has done on that specific trail?!?!
But how is the dog?
Don’t worry, your neighbors hates you
Omg… I read « I hear handjobs » on the thumbnail at first 😭😭😭
Luce County Doe Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
That would have been a fun terror movie to watch. The Main protagonist turning into the villain and you rooting for the support characters that are now the main protagonists.
Knives aren’t weapons UNTIL they are used as weapons
It sure makes me think that each of those knives they found in his tent, belonged to victims of his.
Crazy twist, was not expecting that at all.
Natural selection is better suited for taking care of ill prepared hikers. No gun shot wounds needed.
Let's be honest, those are his mother's knickers. 😂
Oh wow well it's great that they was good cuz that's only crazy that they was helping him and he was trying to kill them but I'm glad he's in jail and hopefully he'll come out
There's black and brown men serving life sentences for selling drugs but this dude gets released after only 10 years for KILLING two people! Just goes to show how this country view people, race, and the privilege of skin tone. Tragic. 😭🤬 Glad those dudes survived💪🏾.
It's sad your stories used to be presented as true now you just make up narrative to add a twist ending. You've done this story before from the victim side years ago this is just pathetic if you want to do fiction be up front about it.
When i read “i hear banjos” i immediately thought of “the Rainbow Connection” by Kermit the Frog.
To be fair, I get pissed off with people playing music in the woods too. But I just prefer to mutter about it under my breath, rather than get, y'know, shooty.
I really like this shirt!
In a reddit channel talking in detail about Randall, the OP has stated that "You may be pleased to hear that Bo has since been adopted, and given a home with a loving, caring family who feed and walk him regularly"  I am SO happy about this.
Sean DID get a bad vibe when he saw Randall and they never became too comfortable with Randall which tells u that bad vibes are real.
This was edge of your seat mystery and tension.
Ima be mr ballen this halloween!
it is the government mistake by releasing him after the first murders.
great story! i feel like you lose yourself in unnecessary details or trying to explain stuff by repeating certain points which almost pulls me out of the story. Again great story and i love your energy!
Letting any type of criminal out for good behaviour is just insane to me.
I listened to this story 3 times and every time at the beginning when you said Ricky was running out of food and if he ran out I expect you to say he’s going to end his trip and start heading home every time but nope the story continues lol
No one cares about your podcast read the story story boy
that was a good one
The things this man makes me do to the like button is truly more disturbing than his stories.
There is no way i would hike this trail EVER!! As many stories as I've watched you tell of this hike trail, my mind wouldn't be able to handle the unknown surroundings of it. And I love the outdoors, but this would be to much for me.
Youd be able to see the "i hate my neighbors" for about 3 mins tops. The fire will conjoin fast, especially if gasoline is in the equation
Waw and to think the old man was the good guy😢😢 love the way u told the story
You are an amazing storyteller. Thank you for the video
sean and scott go back to dismal creek  i couldnt do it
for those who arent familiar with this story sean and scott being shot likely due to the fact that were shot with a .22 pistol  had it been a larger caliber this would likely be a homicide story
Glad to see the “metal bracelet” that Ricky wore was monitored by law enforcement…not!
The story is insane 😭🫶🏻
OH GOD OH GOD I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA BE A GOOD ONE CUS THE COMMENTS R SPOILING
It's stunning that they still go back to Dismal Creek. Creating new memories at the place of trauma.
Like Button: "My neighbors already know I hate them, anyway. What difference does it make? They still know I'll shovel their fucking sidewalks."
Run, Fool! Is AWESOME! He's a wonderful addition to your studio! Thank you!
Sorry but your voice is so much more soothing 😊
That’s crazy I was camping at Greenwater in Washington state and then the next day a cop came to our campsite and was asking us questions about if we seen anything weird. Well, it turns out that in the next camp over a girl was stabbed really bad and left for dead and she was crawling her way all injured to our campsite and ended up dying Halfway to our campsite…. like she almost made it she wasn’t that far from our campsite. it haunts me to this day, because if I would have just taken a walk and seen her, I could have saved her. It’s just scary to think that there was a poor dead woman not that far from our campsite and she was just laying there all night as we were partying just laying there dead. Also, it’s scary to think that there was a fuckin murderer at our next campsite. Thank God he wasn’t going from campsite to campsite to kill people. This happened when I was like 18 or 19 years old and I’m 38 now and it still haunts me to this day.
Gotta be honest, I saw this one coming
This isn't about the current video.  It's about the podcast RUN , FOOL.  I have been listening to it for about a week,  mainly while I'm relaxing and getting ready for bed.  I am  loving this podcast Rodney has a very relaxing voice and,  he's an awesome story teller.
When was the last time MrBallen made a video that *wasn't* based off a criminal report?
I hope that at least he took care of that dog because what happened to the dog? Shawn and Scot are blessed for real, that was god saying it is not your time to go.. God bless them❤❤❤
They had a small yard, it read "I hat my ne"
Mr.Ballen I have been a fan since back before you had a 100k sub back when you was doing so like this 5 day a week
Thanks for doing this story! I passed Randal on the AT in April 2008 when I was out with my Boy Scout troop. I have also met both surviving men, they came to our middle school and told their story to us. Anyway, very cool to hear one that you feel especially connected with!
Murderers should NEVER GET PAROLE. Certainly not a double murderer.
'real photo of different trout'         lol, always gets me!!
But what happened to the dog?.
Hey where did you get that shirt I want it
Mr. Ballen~ You're looking tired.  You gots soooo much going on. Take a break,  figure out what you can keep doing, and what you should cut down on.  Everyone still loves you,  it's ok. 😊❤
I’m begging you to post some scary story compilations. 😫
Wondering about the dog anyone? I am 😂
“Ricky” literally bit the hand that fed him. You can totally tell he was mental from the beginning of the story guys living in the woods with a dog seems pretty weird to me as an older man who doesn’t even have strength or anything to fish for should have already been a red flag.
The 70s 80s and 90s were a wild time for murders to be released in short time.  We are trying to do that now for some stupid reason.
I think this is one of your best videos to date, the way it’s told & the switching around of things really leads us your viewers, on a very creepy but enjoyable ride.  Only one thing, & I don’t know if it’s just me, but the last part where everything gets explained etc, the voiceover & the actual video don’t quite seem to match up, it seems a tiny bit disjointed. It’s probably just me & sorry as I don’t mean anything bad by it, just curious 🤷🏻‍♀️
I would love to suggest the story of Debbie Wolfe, the nurse whom was found dead in a pond on her property in North Carolina. This story has always really bugged me.
i cant be the only one who misses the disturbing photo videos right
Sleep
This guy put me too slet😂😂
Thats horrible. Feed a man. Then get attacked
My deductive skills knew it was Ricky the moment you said they heard satanic rituals. I was like “didn’t homedog say he likes screaming in the woods”😂😭
Banjos in the woods? Are they dueling? Because I think that's important. 😅
just goes to show that a homicidal maniac doesn't get any better with age.  our justice system is so screwed up.
Why you cannot measure crazy by size. Its the ones that you least expect.
It’s pronounced app-a-la-chin mtns not app-a-lation mtns trust me I live here in the mountains of East Tennessee none of us call them the later. For some reason that aggravates  the hell out of me
Another failure of our corrupt justice system
All those hand gestures…. Making me dizzy.
I had to re watch it cause that was such a plot twist 😂
make more diving videos man 👍🏼
Aint gonna lie you definitley got me on the switch. Thought that "Ricky" was the one who got shot. Not the one doing the shooting.
As far as narrating voices go I don’t think you can get better than Mr Ballen, Shiny Gold Tales, or Booze and Boos. 👌👌👌🙌🏻
What the hell man, I come here for true stories, and what I get is a picture of some DIFFERENT trout? Make it make sense
Damn number 39 on trending
Wonder what happened to the poor starving dog..
I swear to God. I kept hearing him say "dismal" creek.
Wait, but what happened to the dog?
creeepy
Contact the civil air patrol VA wing for good stories. CAP occasionally helps with missing persons cases and downed civilian aircraft. One of my former colleagues had some interesting things to say about the great Dismal swamp.
Captions bro needs caption
What happened to the dog???
I think after the like button gets their samoyed dog perfectly groomed to be a fluffy white marshmallow, someone should put a kiddie pool full of sloppy mud in the middle of the house while the like button is out.
am drunk MrBallen you sob, definately this shit caught me off guard
My Alexa could never find RunFool, I realized I had to manually search for it in my app in order to listen to it. I had the same issue with Medical Mysteries too.
Time for a beer for each story
I never guess these normally but something about “Ricky” seemed off from the get go crazy story thanks man 😀
"No good deed goes unpunished" - if you want to survive in this world, remember that quote and apply it often
This is the best retelling of this story that I've come across. Great work Mr. Ballen!
I think ill just play the banjo to get the bheigbhors wrath.
It was a lil hard trying not to be completely confused bc I'm stoned as The Dog lol
This is so crazy, But what happened to the dog?? I hope he's okay :(
I really love listening to you. I'm a 56 yr old woman. My house burned down a month ago and then while staying with my daughter I fell down the stairs and broke four ribs. I have been so depressed, but listening to you has helped me get through all of this. Keep up the great stories.
Whats up jordan
Bro put me in a shock I subscribe now 😆
the "code" is BS lol
Thanks for coming back to Spotify
Hopefully somebody saved the dog.
Wait wait wait. A person can kill 2 hikers and just miracously make parole after murdering 2 people!! that's insane, whoever let him out should be convicted!
What am I doing HERE? Eh..
The stuff mentioned about Randall was really creepy. The fact that he mentioned doing stuff like meditation or that type of occult ritualistic stuff among the other things they found at his campsite and even how he died suddenly made me think even more that this guy was possibly possessed if he wasn't just mentally ill. The things that happen in this world are spiritual, and we as humans don't entirely understand or even see everything that's going on ourselves, but spiritual warfare is going on everywhere and has been since the beginning according to the Bible. The world is also getting worse as the years pass because it's getting closer to the end. No one knows when that will happen but the Father, but we're told to be prepared. I give thanks to Him (God, Our Father and Creator in Heaven) for saving Sean and Scott's lives. When I heard that part of the story, I began tearing up because I thought they were both going to die because of how severe their injuries were and the description and visualisation I could imagine made me feel emotional, but they were saved because of the Lord, and I was so happy for them because they didn't do anything to deserve having that man do that to them when they were kind enough to give him food. This was definitely a miracle. Thank you, God. In Jesus' Name, Amen.
Mr. B, please upload more Run Fool !!!! It's just as you mentioned.
I had to listen to this twice to really grasp what I was hearing. What a sick man.
Am I the only one wondering what happened to his dog?! 😅
Why won't you take your hat off, what are you hiding up there?
Sitting by the fire tonight, perfect setting
Imma name my child like button
I literally have watched a docuseries on Sean and Scott telling their story and the way you told it still had me caught by surprise. Great work per usual !
Excess deaths this year (23). Tell this story mr Mason
"Very likely not a threat" SURE
Interesting story. Glad Sean and Scott pulled through.
Scott and Sean are some tough mf
Murders should NEVER be let out of prison.
Week 1 of asking you to do the story of Linda Stoltzfoos 18 from June 2020 from Bird-in-Hand PA.  Her story needs more coverage.❤️
Wait this Ricky guy.... his last name Bobby? You know Ricky Bobby!? "SHAKE AN BAKE"!!! Lmao had too.
Hehehehehe Mr.Ballen always be giving me bad but fun ideas!! Lol
Just another brick in the wall.
Died suddenly. Do you talk about this topic? Its trending.
What happened to the dog!?!?
Great story. Two good guys survived and the bad guy died. I wonder what caliber they were shot with that they survived shots to vital parts of their bodies?  The scariest thing about this one is that they met up with some random guy and tried to be nice and he assaulted them with no warning.  Just a random act of malice.
I think Barnes is a great story teller but Run Fool's actual stories are too hysterical and whimsical.
Greatest plot twist ever
Did it. Sub button wasn't happy and now I have 20 years in prison.😊
Aww, MrB!!!!  I sure do wish you could’ve shown a real photo of Ricky’s fishing line! 😂
I had to listen to this twice because what!!!?!? Rickkeeyyydaaanmmmnn😮
Thanks MrB. I'd forgotten about this one. So incredible! And the way you told it really gives that build up of suspense and worry...and then bam! Yikes. I'm so glad Sean and Scott made it and found help from those ladies! Guess Gods karma got that particular monster🙏🏼💔🕊️
Wtf he was given parole and he killed two people that is absolutely 💯percent insane 😳in ireland 🇮🇪 we don't have the death penalty and very light sentence for things that they should do life for its absolutely disgraceful thank you Mr ballen for another 👏brilliant story u never disappoint 👏👍from rachael and philip dublin ireland ❤🇮🇪
I just love ur videos ❤❤❤The way u elaborate awesome ❤❤️❤️I just dive in ur video’s ♥️
His dog Bo was adopted by a loving and caring family ❤
Bro can you tell a story without repeating yourself over and over.
I love Mr.Ballen he’s the reason I keep fighting 🥹
Nothing but reruns on this channel anymore
What happened to the poor dog ? Was he found ?
What is wrong with people, it shows 1.4 million views but only 80k likes?? Y’all full of sh*t🤦🏾‍♂️ it’s not hard to click the like button. People something else for real. Good watch sir, you at it again💪🏽💯
Once again reminded why I don’t watch this channel by your god awful attempt at subversion. “Ricky looked at the men look at each other and Sean’s face had blood all over it because he got shot in the face and he got shot because Ricky shot his gun at him.” And that’s the short version of what you said. You really didn’t have to do all that man, it made the whole thing feel awkward once you go “and this guy is actually this guy, and this guy is actually this guy, and the campsite was actually Ricky’s, but Ricky isn’t actually Ricky”   Just unnecessarily dramatic for no reason.
I remember this story from a show I watched, either I Survived, or I Shouldn’t Be Alive.
This story is based on truth but Scott shot Ricky.
If you can't catch fish out of that creek your out of bait.    They keep it stocked
I lived there.
"run, fool!" ... Haha. What a name :)
Mr. Ballen? The like button is still in the hospital after misheard you in your last video and pushed him off a cliff. Also he doesn't sleep anymore because of the crazy crap We all do to him.
Wow, that story took a turn for the worst but at least Sean and Scott still have that picture that looks like a before and after weight loss
Hahaha real photo of different trout
You look so tan.
When I would’ve lived in times without TV or any electronics, I would’ve loved to have someone in my family like Mr.Ballen, who would entertain the family with great stories at the evenings!
You are the best 🎉
Great story!  I also listen to Run, Fool. Listened to the first episode and got hooked.
I knew there was a reason why Ricky didn't just go to town for more food.
How you construct a story is beyond amazing 😂
I’m so glad the two men made it, but what happened to the poor dog?? 😢
People don't have brains now and days . please stop suggesting such evil things....lol
Camping Story? Campaign Story? Yes!! The story follows like: me & my dog~ by the river banks~ waiting for hours & hours catching fish!! They walk down all the way to catch fish!! Finally to add suspense on that day no fish were at sight!! All of them went into hibernate state. Why it was winter?
15:40
I was SO glad to hear the victims at the campsite lived!!!  Jeez....
He murdered two people and after 15 years was released for "good behaviour".    Geezzz
Please Mr ballen. If you have never hiked the AT. Don't talk about some stupid imaginary custom. There are loads of horrible nasty people on the Appalachian trail you don't want help from.
To much hands man, to much hands
C my page for 50$
I wonder why people camp in the wilderness at night
Great story. I’m very cautious of who I bring around. I’m a big guy myself that carry’s a firearm but sometimes there’s situations that you can’t get out of.
Knowing the twist, I went back and listened to this again and I have a theory, albeit a speculative one.   I think this was Ricky's little game. I think he's done that same thing multiple times and he would do it to anyone he found was disrespectful to " his area." Basically if someone did anything he didn't like he would kill them. And as for being paroled for good behavior, I think he minded himself so that he could get out so he could resume his game.
When you’ve watched Mr.Ballen long enough you can almost predict the plot twist❤ love his videos. Been a fan for a couple of years now.
Yo Ballen you should stream FF7 Rebirth you nerd
So you are speaking to millions of people and telling them to put gasoline on their neighbors lawn and light it on fire? Reported.
Sean and Scott have to be admired for not letting this, quite frankly,  terrifying experience from stopping them doing the thing that they love. The fact that their friendship survived this ordeal and that they charged on regardless is commendable. Massive respect and ❤🫂. Like deployed 👍
Mr. Ballen is hands down the most brilliant and captivating storyteller to ever grace the earth. The way he spun a twist on the identity of the killer was ingenious.  In fact, it wasn't until the very end that I realized I had been previously familiar with the story.  The way he initially presented it from the perception of the killer led me to believe that Scott and Dan were the bad guys and that Ricky had indeed been the innocent victim. I was absolutely elated upon learning the truth.
I grew up next to dismal falls! Spent soooo many summers days swimming and drinking with friends. Still has creepy vibes there tho
Maybe your best yet..disturbing photo of Randall near the end..each eye, is looking different direction. Cold ,aloof, smugful disdainment.. "Everything and everybody ,is stupid but me glare"..His after will unmentionable terrible
This is one of the only episodes that i had a feeling what was actually going on. That ricky dude seemed hella sus hahaha
Is the dog ok?
You did an excellent job of reminding us all about 'perspective' with the twist in this story. Scott and Sean were good guys but from "Ricky's" perspective as a mentally unwell murderer he somehow saw scary men who were judgmental, angry, and out to get him. It makes me wonder if he had received any treatment for schizophrenia et al. though he never should have been released after 15 years for killing 2 people.
So basically you made up 70% of the story.. All the first part and context you made. That's messed up man, and quite frankly a disrespect towards the victims.
Bloody hell I wasn't expecting that twist!!!😮
What happened to Ricky's / Randall's dog?  I would assune the dog was in the car he crashed, but nothing  was said about it.  Maybe he left the dog at his old campsite, when he went to have dinner?
Wait what the fuck? They both survived? Thats awesome.
What happened to “run fool”? I can’t watch or see it on YouTube anymore
Parole needs to stop.
I had to listen to this twice
He was hangry.
I have no audio???
Great video Mr. Ballen👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
And I’m here worried about the dog the whole time … bad doggie 😅
The best, MOST soothing voice you will EVER hear= Joel from @LetsRead   EDIT: And if I didn't already know this sorry, so well, this would be a great way of retelling it. I mean IT IS a fantastic retell but because I know it, I miss out...
15 yrs for a double murder ! You get more than that here in the UK. I’m glad those two kids made it , god bless them both .  A better outcome would have been for that guy to either rot in jail or get sent to death row
I just started getting into that album surprise - I think it is quite good.  So agree with the hype not either of you.
Oh yikes Ricky went out on my birthday that sucks 😂
Is there a version of this without the music? I feel like the bass is crawling up my damn throat I’m sick of it
They should sue the state for granting somebody parole after 15 years for murdering two women
I was fully expecting to hear banjos at some point😭
Appalachia(n) is pronounced Apple at cha! Get it right Mr B, or I will throw an Apple atcha!  I want that cabin (?) where you are sitting in Green Screen land!  ✌️♥️
Great story as usual! Thanks so much!!
Bro I'm in court with my neighbours with an arson charge but they just don't get the ballen vibe fuck them 🤷‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
I wasn't expecting the ending for sure, so pleased the two guys survived the shooting. It must have been so horrific.
Ricky sounds like a woman….😢
My apologies, John. If you happen to read this, please keep rolling with what you do . Been a fan since day one.. ...almost😊.. thought this was a basketball sight "mr.Ballen" 😂😂😂at first.
Shrimp Alfredo 😢
What happened to the dog ?
There should be a huge spoiler alert to those people who commented before anyone had the chance yet to watch the video
What happened to the dog ?!!?!
I remember hearing this story on that show “I Survived” and Scott and Shaun told the story from their perspective. You did a great job turning this into a mind bending plot twist. Incredible story telling skills.
Thought you were exaggerating when you said "Ricky" saw a massive man 3 times his size, but you were not. That is indeed a large man.
I won't be watching anymore all you do is push other programs your doing. You fxxxxd up great story programs
What happened to the dog? ☹
IF SOMEONE IS ARRESTED FOR MURDER WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY EVEN ELIGIBLE TO BE RELEASED ?!?!!?!?
The fact they survived those injuries is just insane
I ❤ your creepy camping stories
First you said when the police arrived alongside with the ambulance, they put the man in the ambulance and took him off. Then later you said both were medically transported via helicopter. Were they taken to an area where the helicopter could reach them via ambulance?
Mr. Ballen - I am curious, why was your Mr. Ballentines hoodie only selling for a few days?  I wanted to order one but didn't have the time, will you be selling it again?  I'd buy that one but I don't want to spend $60 - $80 on a hoodie that's just a solid color with a small skeleton thumbs up.
ballen comin in clutch with the bedtime story
I was raised in Bluefield, and live in Giles...grew up with Sean and Scott..unbelievable story...Glad they survived it..
🐕AND what happened to mans best friend??? Glad Sean & Scott survived this psycho.
I’ve heard this story before but your storytelling is on another level. It was on the edge of my seat, even though I knew exactly how the story would go.
Who'd rather take the like button captive for some merch?😅👇
Damn Mr. Ballen!! You scared the poop out of me with that sudden "wait don't go anywhere" at the end!!😂😂😂
wonder what happened to the dog..
I had a nutty ex that wrote s1ut across my front garden grass! Killed the lawn so badly that it showed for months. I hate my neighbor would have been much more preferable to me 😂😂😂
I’m going camping on this very trail next well 😢😅
I recently stumbled upon your page somehow and I’m glad I did. You tell some pretty good stories! Although some are basically a replica of “Forensic Files” episodes. If I could provide some advice for your story telling, perhaps you could ease off using the words “But” and “totally”, that would make it much more enjoyable for this listener. But, if you insist, I totally understand because you’ve been doing this for so long but it’s just something to totally consider.
I’ve heard this story before.  You made this so confusing by making “Ricky” out to be the good guy in the first half of the story..
I knew that weirdo was going to be the killer... Never trust weirdos you find alone in the woods, kids.
you should do stories like this but build suspense but then have them end in a good way. like imagine randomly you did that, it'd throw people way off lol
So glad Ricky didn't steal their joy, and they still go back for fishing and camping!  Those are my favorite endings when hearing a story like this!  🎣
I knew it was Ricky when we didn’t see a picture of him.
Telling children to use fuel to put on your neighbours lawn & set it on fire is not what the world needs at the moment. It needs, “if the like button is asleep, let it sleep soundly & have a wonderful nutritious breakfast ready for it, when it wakes, so it can run a race like never before.”
moraleja nunca confies en un vagabundo xd
How do people who have committed cold blooded murder get let out for...."good behavior".
I have been missing out 😢😢😮on RUN FOOL! BUT I TRULY LOVE YOU MY FRIEND
When I decided not to go camping today …I thought it was “safe” to watch this.   It is extremely disturbing! great job thank you!
Reopen the asylums!!
The way you structure your stories is 🔥
I've heard this story before but I didn't realize it until almost the end because of all the elaboration at the beginning of Ricky being scared and all that and the other two being the bad guys. That happens a lot with this channel. But I love it anyway.
That thumbnail the kid looks like the young Tony Soprano in the Saints of Newark!
I missed what happened to the dog.
OK, that was a nice story. But what happened to the dog???
Listening to this at work and the gasps I gusped😭😭  Twas NOT expecting that twist. Omg
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG
I think they should get park rangers on those areas just once in a while park rangers would go out and take pictures of anyone out there to know who came and went and mark locations and follow up on anyone they saw to make sure everyone is good
Love you MrBallen! <3
Run fool is such a good podcast! And I love all Mr Ballen Content it’s so well written/told and put together it gets me through my work day
“ not a real photo of Ricky fishing” LOL
This somehow reminds me of "Tucker and Dale vs Evil".... I can'T help myself seeing Scott and Sean as Tucker and Dale.
can we please go back to more than one video a week 🙏😖
Sean and Scott are legends, respect
Can confirm that "Run, Fool!" is an incredible show. Despite the distinct terror & weirdness of many of the subjects, Rodney's narration is delivered in such a way that I still feel like I'm gonna be OK after, which is huge for me. A different style of beautiful storytelling, and I love the folkloric aspect.
Perhaps most of the things  found  in his campsite were stolen
is this a movie of an actual prediction, cause the start of this sounds like a pretty sick movie pitch
15 years for killing 2 people? This is why woke left wing judges and parole boards are a threat to society.
Wow.....15yrs for a double homicide! And I thought Britain was soft on monsters.
Rule #1 in camping .. always listen to that first voice and your dog....crazy story
Was waiting for the dog update 😢
Never trust a no-one!
Wow! So glad Sean and Scott survived! That’s a miracle!
So where is SEAGUL-LUNG?
Have you done one of those places you shouldn't go but did anyways? https://youtu.be/uH0W5AK4bwI?si=HojMYntzE5DR6N-i
I normally love this channel.  But this one was just a ridiculous way to tell the story to make it into a big twist!! You almost like made this into a movie by the way you "fake" told the first half of it. You went on and on the first 15 minutes as if this guy was scared for his life etc.....this was misleading and only to make interesting, but if you go back and listen its all just make believe, really not true in a sense, and thats not what his channel normally is.
I knew the story from TV show " Dead Silent " on Travel channel or Investigation Discovery.. The re enactment on the show was creepy- thriller to the core.. Amazing job John!  If you look up more story the ' Dead Silent' tv program had .. You will be amaze with the many dark true stories out there .. Like yours with visual horror lol
This guy is so good in telling stories, his version of the "Knock, knock" joke probably lasts for 30 minutes... All joke aside, great story as always.
This story is the definition of the old adage.. no good deed goes unpaid .
This happened 30 minutes from where I live and I have never heard this story. Thank you for sharing, what a crazy ending.
Thank you for doing stories based in Appalachia!
Might be a little paranoid but I would have assumed the country music was played to keep anyone from hearing me scream or yell.
We live near dismal creek,we camp there a couple times every year,we camped in the exact spot where the two hikers were killed not knowing about this whole thing,we still camp there but in a different camp site now,it's just to creepy to camp in the old spot knowing what we know now,dismal creek is a beautiful place with an amazing swimming area at the falls,definitely worth visiting if you are a traveler.
All of us OGs of Mr Balls, we have heard this story before… many years before!
Nature is a religious experience if you want it to be
You should do the Robyn field story
Made the mistake of looking at top comments while still listening😅
They feed him and he turns around and shoots them!! Horrible
I love this channel but the run fool stuff is plop.
Love this channel so much
The ‘plot twist’ definitely emphasizes the old saying, “There’s two sides to every story.” Another reason I try to be impartial to just about every one-sided post on the internet.  Thank you, Mr. Ballen, for another wonderfully told cliffhanger!!  ❣️😃
There's a yt channel called mysterious duniya thats copying your content
Wow. Amazing guys for surviving. Hope the dog was ok.
I know this story. All of are recycled.
There's about 10-15 creepy and disturbing camping stories on here.
Those are some tough guys
This is good!
Title should be - Stupid Ricky & his dog.  Thank me later for not watching this...
I mean he definitely left sean to die 😂 but glad they both lived
A very good video, indeed.
Thanks Allen
I’ve literally never heard of the Appalachian code before that’s actually so freaking cool haha and so glad I know that now. I probably would’ve learned eventually but I’ve always wanted to hike that specific trail so it’s good to know in case I didn’t run across that in my research before I go haha thank you 😂❤️❤️
Goodie found me some old stori xD nois
Over from weaponized
This is my new favourite podcast great videos, I especially love the sound fx thanks man 🙏
I suspected that Ricky was the one to be a killer and the twist of the story
How can someone be paroled after killing two people??
So well written!  Great story.
This confused me for a lil bit.
@ 0:00 gotta creeper right there  #.trollmaster
Paroled for good behavior after killing someone is insane
Disclaimer as follows:  locals who live near the Appalachian Trail are Not Your Keepers or personal food bank for when you fk up and dont take enough supplies on Your Hike.. Disclaimer In Layman's: Dont expect a retired salty veteran to fork over his PB trout, It aint fkn happening.. we will eat yer leg before we hand over our pb trout...
Any other channels like this? I love the story’s, just the audio quality isn’t the greatest. I would love something that’s nice and crisp.
Saw that one coming.
You are my favorite YouTuber storyteller. 💙🤍
I apologize!  I had no right to speak on a situation that I have no knowledge of. I hope Anyone who is Seeking help can find what they are looking for God bless
Hubby walked entire AT that year (took him 7 months) as 20+ yr old eagle scout...told him bout this story ..he arrived at shelter the day his original victims' bodies were removed .....and the guy did it again....im blown away  He didnt stay at any more shelters after that. He said the killer thought the girl he killed was old g'friend...they were found buried by hiker...coz foot was sticking outta ground
Wife: “Why wouldn’t Ricky just go home instead of starving?”  Me: “Plot twist!”
You are food for the soul Mr Ballen, thank you for sharing that instant pep and feelgood vibes love you so awesome
Like button's goin to jail.
I love your videos soo much,you are the best ❤❤
wait,what!!!!!!! parolled for gud behavior???? no murderer should b parolled unless it was involuntarily manslaughter period,tanks Mr Ballen for keeping me at the edge of my seat,sorry about his victims though.
Any chances we could get some more ghost stories?
I dont think it matters if the storys are about the strange, dark and mysterious. Aslong as mrballen is telling the story. Im listening.
MrBallen you tell the best stories I've ever heard my entire life
What about his dog ?
I would have expect that Sean and Scott was the killers.
Love Scott and Sean, amazing 💕
Most people's front yard isn't big enough to spell hate these days so neighbors might be hard 😂
So he was anxious because of murders in the area but he was the murderer? Either that anxiety was made up to make the story better or he was even more mentally ill than you said he was
Paroled for killing two people was insanity. The board that let him go is part to blame for this attack occurring. The death penalty ensures that monsters like Randall can not prey on innocent people again.
Why do I feel like I've already heard this story....from MrBallen ?🤔
Bro I called it!!  I was like imagine if Ricky was the bad guy all along, Told story well but wasnt til you started saying that Sean n Scott were looking at Ricky like hes maybe lil weird and he didnt like the loud Country Music n all that I started to wonder, Then fact that hes been out there for weeks, The thought just crossed my mind what if Ricky was the bad guy here all along but I quickly dismissed the idea thinking there was likely a 4th camper that came after the 3 of them or something…
Sounds like a French or German thing where its the law where by they have to provide help by law
cool. but its not a "places nobody should go, and people who went there anyway" video. those are my favorite. real "f around and find out" type videos
Sean & Scott are ride&die friends for real. They have my respects, and I'm glad they made it.
Our judicial system is broken!
If the wild beasts don't attack ya, one of your own will🙄
AS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR IN TWO PLACES. WHAT TASKS WOULD YOU THINK TO HAVE YOUR ASSISTANT SELF DO AND GET DONE FOR YOU IF YOU COULD MOVE LIKE A GRAND WIZARD. #PAWZ2PARKOUR
Wowwwww omfg I would have never guesses it was ricky in a million years
👍👍👍
I really do hate my neighbors & I live on a 500acre dairy farm. How would you suggest getting rid of a whole golf course & a couple stragglers that bought sandboxes for yards & slapped a cookie cutter house on it & THEN, realize, that the fields beside them aren’t theirs? Live 5 mins from the Appalachian trail, also. Just lookin for suggestions
Noice🇦🇺💙
You pulled a Hostel 3 in the opening.
Parole for good behavior alone is insane to me; they behave in prison because sometimes they just belong there.
It completely blows my mind that men and women walk these trails without a single weapon on them I don't go in my own woods without a gun they could atleaste take pepper spray wake up people it's not a safe world
What’s even creepier is that those objects in his tent were probably from people who are still alive today 😳
Ricky sounds like a Karen. Getting mad about people listening to music and enjoying themselves in the woods and pretending to like people so he can eat their food.
😂 I saw the title and I automatically knew the whole story BUT I’m still invested.
WoW..😮That's mad..very strange
This story happened on the day my sister was born
1 Corinthians 10:31 31 So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.🙏🏽
Glad these fellas survived that encounter, I'm sure that's one hell of a campfire story for any other hikers they'll encounter on that trail.
Sean is a real-life juggernaut.
Gun is your friend
I tried run fool but the audio is really static sounding
It is disrespectful. It’s country music. I mean unless it’s Johnny cash or something from that era . It’s disrespectful to play country music anywhere at anytime
Currently camping on a peninsula out in the Gulf of Mexico. It’s storming. 5am and dark. Perfect time to listen and fall back asleep 😴
Lol those guys are absolute units for going back like nothing happened 💪🏻😂
On every cop in the area’s radar, but not behind bars.  It figures.  It’s almost as if the justice system has no use for an indigent recidivist.
I feel like Mr Baden really hate his neighbor and that was a message to them 🤣🤣
Mr Ballen:  describing the contents of the tent. Me:  mouth slowly drops open.
@MrBallen 15:50 top right of building, its slender man glowing like a mofo.......did I win?  Pin Me if so  God Bless You & Yours
love it
Might of used to much gasoline neighbours house is on fire
Banjos?? Maybe he watched deliverance
Im so glad they survived so I didn't feel so bad about laughing at the pic Scott & Shaun at the end of the video...look like  "PINKY & THE BRAIN" standing side by side like that‼️✋😆😭💀
Some people are born evil great video as always Mrballen ❤
Camping stories are your best ones!
I AM BEGGING YOU!!!!!.... PLEASEEEE SO A 30 MINUTE VIDEO OF THE 431 MUSEUM AND THE BACK STORY I NEED YOU TO TELL ME NOBODY DOES IT LIKE YOUUUU!!!! P.S SORRY FOR THE UPPER CASE I REALLT NEWD THISBTO STAND OUT.
Lesson 1. NEVER TRUST ANYONE
The dog tho.
The dog, "Bo", survived and was adopted by a loving family.
dude killer jawline Mr Ballen
Need a disclaimer so when does  that
They befriended and fed this guy, he relays them by trying to kill them!! Shaun's first instinct regarding Ricky were bang on
👍
Thank God they survived! 🙏 😢❤
26:10 Thank you for my bed time story! 😊
Note to self: Never read the top comment accidentally while watching (may contain spoilers) ⚠️
❤ Follow up, for your happiness and fun life.
I love the Appalachian trail but dang bro. The whole reason I love it is because of how peaceful it is. This guy just took it way too far. If you don’t like someone out there it’s not hard to just get away from them
Anyone else wondering if the dog was okay😂
Invite the like button for a sleep over at your house. As you are turning to go to bed, casually state “You might not wanna close your eyes tonight”.
This explains why the house down the streets lawn caught fire and burned their house down leaving “I  HATE MY NEIGHBORS” on the front lawn. They caught the perpetrators. Ended up being their neighbor
12:05 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
At the very start I knew there was something weird about this dude just starving himself in the woods when he could just drive home, stop at the store and get some food lol
🐒🙉🙈🙊🐒
A lot of this story is not right, tandalld mother died and the electricity was shut off, that’s why he left, there is so much wrong,it wasn’t two woman it was a husband and wife, the cop didn’t just show up while Scott was on the porch they had to wait over 30 minutes bc they were so far out and they waited inside, the ambulance ppl came and knocked on the door, before the cops got there, also they were looking for the truck and knew it was Scott’s truck the shooter hadand it crashed fleeing from them, I mean that’s not even touching on all the stuff before that, I know everything about this case, watched dead silent: curse of dismal creek, I watched fatal encounters, murder around the campfire, also Chris Hansen interviewed them not to long after this happened, it was actually the only time I saw Scott interviewed, it was very traumatic for him, so Sean does the interviews now. Mrballen is good at his craft but how much of the stories he tells is actual truth vs his own made up stuff, I mean to tell a story is one thing but when it’s a real life situation I want the real story, not what the person telling the story assumes a guy who never spoke about his crimes was thinking and feeling. it’s not just ballen I take issue with that over it’s all these ppl who do stories or documentaries
Excellent story telling the best i have ever heard thank you ❤
Love Run, Fool. Awesome podcast. Another great video thanks Mr B
I literally got hyped when you said they both survived 😂 Like thank God!
I can def fall asleep to Run Fool ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊
Just a note for other ballen fans: Run Fool really is a great podcast. Definitely worth the listen.
These poor guys! I hope that they're doing well today and not in any pain.
Oh weird you made us think the bad guy was afraid of the good guys by flat out lying about what was going through his head earlier on. Like you do every other time now. Lame. Be better.
it's disrespectful to blast country music ANYWHERE
So….what happened to the dog?
It's cool how you start with Ricky and he's aware of the guy named Randall had killed people there then the end Ricky was Randall 😂 your the man g 🤣 good story teller 👍🏾
Your best work to date. I really mean it. I can’t wait to listen in to Run Fool!
Love ya, my fellow military man❤🇺🇸. ..but gasoline writing isn't the greatest example to ruin the like button. You've got a FAMILY!!! John, you've got a great crowd, but a young one. I'm 47. Let's direct that to the border instead😉
I convinced the like button that every photo shown in Mr. Ballen episodes IS the actual photo.
I hate the way this story is told. It's like it's meant to evoke sympathy for Ricky. And the transition from Ricky's story is really lame with the whole turning around and there being a big bang, then later you get the "surprise" that the bang was actually Ricky shooting a gun. I'd rather the story was more straightforward, instead of jumbled around.
Don't go into the wilderness without a firearm on your hip.
The only reason I cant watch the Run Fool Podcast is because Mr ballen doesn't tell the stories lol
You’ve taught me how to talk to people ❤
🎉love her
As soon as Mr Ballen said that the cassette tape had chanting in it, I knew it was Ricky chanting bc he said he liked to chant while he was cooking the fish with those 2 men! & he said the men were looking like they thought he was weird cus he was weird! It all makes sense now
I saear you told this story before
Oh portals are under beds and archways. So what you saw as a teenager was an interdenominational being. It's all documented and real.
The inescapable conclusion from all Mr Ballen’s camping stories: Canpung in the woods is overrated 😮
You'll probably never see this but understand the satanic ritual requires a blood sacrifice. That's what Epstein Island was really about. The old perverts having their way with teens was the least of what happened on island. Critical Thinking' does anyone honestly believe young attractive people on list would need to go to an island to find willing teens? Think Temple Of Dome... It's bad real bad guys. I can't talk about it on any Google based platforms because they are complicated in it all..  God Bless
I could of sworn that it was Scott and Sean that was going to murder “Ricky/Randal” I had it back,ass,wards;}>
This horror story sure had a insane plot twist.
Blame the united states government for thos incidents. This system is so corrupt and broken. How is this guy out in 15 years. Innocent people and guys with lesser crimes doing over 20 yrs to life. USA system is Rigged. 💯  SMDH!
Run fool doesn’t sound good. Needs a new host like me ballen
What happened to his dog??
Mr Ballen will demonetize YouTube when he retires 😂
Wait what happended to Randall’s dog?
Just saying as a trail hiker I appreciate what you are saying, hikers help hikers, but going farther to help someone that needs help should just be universal ❤
I’m glad they didn’t let that jerk ruin their fun at their old camp ground. I’m glad they still go and enjoy it.  ❤️💜💚
You know it’s bad news for the character being introduced when their picture looks like it’s from the 90s
#33 trending! that's awesome dude!☺
The hand motions are getting increasingly theatrical and distracting
What happened to the dog?
Redneck rampage.
Wtf is wrong with people 🤦🏻‍♂️
Ill say it once again... STAY YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE WOODS. Thank you and goodnight
Wtf paroled after what???😮disgraceful 😤 he should have got the death penalty im from Ireland 🇮🇪 we do not have that here but i think we should if it involves children or premeditated murder 🤔 w.d.u.t from rachael and philip dublin ireland ❤🇮🇪
seriously, i was genuinely surprised about Sean and Scott surviving those wounds. like my god, their insanely brave!
Wildb
As Soon as you put up the picture of Shawn I knew exactly what story you were telling. As is Par For the Mr. Ballen side of story telling you told it through the eyes of the Twisted Phucker !! When I heard the story it was being told by Shawn and what him and Scott went thru. Thats what makes you You John telling stories from the perspective of someone Other than whod be expected! Thanks Again for Crushin It !! Mr. Ballen For President!!
Anaton’s haircut
@MrBallen could sell me anything LOL
Spay painted ihate my neighbours  😂😂😂 in ⛽ gasoline brilliant you are so funny u and lungy ,papa 😅 love it ❤ from rachael and philip dublin ireland ❤🇮🇪
Okay, Tennessee requires me to inform you that it is pronounced Appa-lash-in, or as some pronounce it Apple-action, just depends on who you ask lol. Keep up the great work man!
If you say app-ah-lay-shuh I might throw an apple-atcha. Easy way to remember the correct pronunciation.
U are right ✅from rachael and philip dublin ireland ❤🇮🇪
Lord Jesus, bless Scott and Sean and Mother Mary please be with them. And the 2 hikers killed by Rnadall years ago. May Jesus have mercy on Randall too, but, what he did was really evil, so I don't know.
What happened to Randall's dog
How cool! I grew up going to Dismal falls often!
I just love your episodes. You have a gift and please stay humble. That will insure your longevity. Thank you for entertaining me!
This is one of the best videos on this channel so far
Great way to tell this story!
Am I the only person who does all the hand gestures during his intro?
Definitely gotta check out run fool.. & despite hitting like button because I do like this vids, always crack up at Mr Ballen's jokes about insulting it.. 😂
Worst thing about this channel?  Upload once a week as opposed to the 3-4 times a week previously.
He's got the voice for stray corn
Put your hands away
Banjo in the woods...definitely creepy, especially here in B.C  More rare than Bigfoot.
It's disrespectful to blare country music anywhere if we're going to be completely honest
Oh I love Mr Ballen, especially in middle of nights when insomnia has me tossing & turning- despite stories being freaky, his voice just calms me.. there's a few channels that copy him, but the original is definitely the best! Gotta ask if Mr Ballen has Italian roots but, cause he speaks with his hands so much! Glad he got out of military service intact, respect that he fought but us Aussies will never understand how or why US sends troops to unnecessary wars.. 🥺
Paroled after serving only 15 years in prison after killing 2 people? What a joke! Especially after killing 2 random strangers because that shows that he would kill for the thrill random strangers.
The most disturbing thing about this story is the fact that the authorities released that psychopath because of "good behaviour".  I mean, what kind of world are we living in? 🤯
Sean was a few years ahead of me in school! Very cool to hear you tell their story!
RIP every piece of art, drink, lamp and chandelier in whatever room you happen to be speaking in.
I hate campfire stories..still gave a like 😂
These two are so lucky to be alive! It’s too bad that we’ll never know the origins of all the items found in his camp.
Releasing a murderer from prison is almost as bad as murder itself.
How often do you release medical mysteries?? Because I have a really long drive this weekend for my bday and I CAN NOT do it without either a podcast or new YouTube video and so far I’ve listened to everything 😢😢
WHAT ABOUT THE DOG???!!??!??
So glad he chose to film this in a hunting blind 😮‍💨
Damn Mr ballen has no limits to his hatred of the like button.
An advertisement in the middle of the story is so weird why would you do that?? When I listen I'm really listening putting myself there.  And then you just stop and start talking about something so different.. super weird.. it kinda ruins it..
Oh dear, I subscribed to "Run Fool" and was really looking forward to it, until I heard the narration.  Preface:  I am autistic and am extremely sensitive to sounds. Rodney Barnes has a very slight lisp, which literally sends chills down my spine and makes me physically uncomfortable.  I feel so bad saying this.  FYI, my parner who is neurotypical, cannot hear the lisp.  I listen to hundreds of podcasts and there are a very few narrators (three, I think) that have lisps, and no matter how fascinating the story is, I am in pain because of the pronounced and prolonged shhhssses.  There is one narrator on one of my favorite fiction pods that started out with a lisp, but she worked on it and got better, and now I enjoy her narration.  I am sorry because this sounds mean; but maybe Mr. Barnes could take some speech therapy classes.  I talked to some other autistic people who have high aural sensitivity, and they assured me that I'm not the only one that notices these things. Please don't send hate, I cannot help that I have extrasensory abilities.
I want my own personal Mr.Ballen to sit next to my bedside and tell me stories while I go to sleep.
opening joke NOT funny.  Hate is NEVER funny. Shame on you.
Why tf would they parole a convicted murderer??
What happened to the dog.
Now we know not to play country music at the Appalachian trail
Your hand movements are obnoxious and gay
Don't judge a book.....  ❤ wolf in sheep's clothing *** And sometimes 'scary' looking people are the 'Salt of the Earth'... be careful out there! ❤
So they were all camping out in the wilderness, far from civilization. But the women call the cops and they - AND AN AMBULANCE - arrive in minutes??! Were they camped out in a Walmart parking lot?
Just commenting on the soothing voice thing. I once knew a marine by the name of Justin cook. we went to a police academy together and after a the oc spray portion I was on my hands and knees, pouring dawn dish soap and milk on my face freaking out because I couldn’t breathe and cook had the water hose aiming it at my face and he was just talking me through it like you’re okay you’re okay… ect and I was astounded by how soothing his voice was, I asked him why was his voice so soothing and every other person there started laughing, but I truly was surprised how he remained calm enough to calm others when we just went through the same thing. (Oc spray feels like the devil pissed on your face) then it feels like a super intense sunburn after subsides a bit. The best part was definitely Daugherty leading me to the wash off spot “carpenter why are you fighting me on this” because before I got sprayed I tried to take a mental picture of where I was going to run when I got done and I was heading into the opposite direction as he was tugging on my arm lol
Am I the only one wondering what happened to the dog…
24:31 uh ya no
Fiddling around with weapons. Lol fileting fish= fiddling with weapons now 😅
What happened to the dog?
I really wish I could watch the other stuff like bedtime stories and run fool but bedtime stories the tone used with the dragged out word at the end of each sentence is very annoying and run fool is just the fact that first person stories I don’t really care for is all
This is why these dumb mfs need to stop letting ppl out on parole idgaf what “good behavior “ in prison seems you shouldn’t get a second chance you took away any chance from someone else
i love how it was told from the killers perspective at first. well done Ball.
Randall had dead eyes.
Mr. Ballan looks like you're in a fire tower with smoke coming up...like you would see in Virginia?...lol! Great story as always.
Such, a great storyteller
What happened to the dog?
Hi John another great story. Thanks for sharing with us love to you as always Tracey England UK ❤❤❤❤
That was a good one!
Mercedes Benz is the correct answer.
I'm guessing Scott's dog never came back?
Stories like this aren't the reason I don't like camping, but it's now part of it.
YouTube is just gay Nazis
I first pictured Ricky as an 80 year old but he was 55, not that old.
But what happened to the dog tho? 😅
I love how you talk to strongly with your hands 🤣😂
Randall Lee looks like anton chigurh.
Do you guys think MrBallen farts? I'm not convinced.
God definitely saved these good men! ❤
Not a real bucket of trout. Disclaimer. Ha
Thank you for your great content. As a side note, Appa-latchin, not Appa-layshin. I’m finally getting close to having seen all of your videos. Podcasts are next. Thanks again for all of your great content and especially for your super power of how to tell a story. My favorite channel.
I wonder what happened to the dog.
It's been a while since I've watched a Mr. Ballen video, so I forgot how much disdain he has for the like button
I'm definitely 100% a ballentine
Everyone has a fan name. Your's should be ballentines. Fits perfectly lol
Randell is well know around  Giles Co.  We’ve grown up hearing the stories and most of us were around to see the last one unfold.  It’s just absolutely unbelievable that he did it TWICE in the same place!!
Dam i haven't watched mr ballen in a while. 8mil views in 1 day is crazy.
Just listened to “Dark Watchers” on Run Fool and I have literal chills! Thank you!!
Darn you are a one good of storyteller! Also glad these men survived, instead of.. 😏
Glad I read the comments to know this wasn't paranormal and just another waste of time murder story.  Edit:  went back to this video and found out it wasn't just your usual murder story because they actually survived. Survival stories I'm all for, very glad they did. Also I love how MrBallen tells it in a way that always leaves a twist at the end, making it seem like the old man was the victim at first.
What the dog doin
I love tragic stories with happy endings... Bless those 2 strong amazing and caring men....
It’s wild to me that you can murder 2 people and be set free.
I hope the like button doesn't have a ring cam.😂 This is getting ugly!
Run Fool is a great campfire-scary-stories podcast! I can't wait for this weeks' part two of last weeks vampire story!??!
Obviously, he shot them for playing country music.
Do you just stalk ThaChapter's channel and just put out the same video as him. A few days later , all the fcking time pretty sad. Use to have great content
I'm so glad Sean and Scott were okay in the end! But... what happened to the dog?
54 is NOT old!! And if dude was hardy enough to be calling for weeks at a time he was likely pretty resilient - just sayin….  Also does anyone know what happened to Ricky’s dog (poor thing!)?
Run, Fool is great! Thank you, Mr. Ballen!
This story had me on the edge of my seat! Great story Mrballen!
Must feed rabbit."really hungry".."food dwindling down "ok ok. Ill pause this awesome story.
I'm not very trusting.  I  would not be camping by myself without a weapon especially on the Appalachian trail.  I watch too many crime shows.  Lol
Wow 😳😳😳🤯🤯🤯😊😊
Thanks for the ever awesome scary content Mr Ballin!
I'm glad they're okay...so uh the dog? Is the dog okay? lol
doubt  i will live that long
O!!! M!!! GOSH!!! My husband and I listen to a Mr. Ballen story every night while having dinner  and this one my husband said,"That's my mama's cousin Scott he talking about!!!" Small world and crazy!!!! I think this story was even featured on TV?  (on one of those crime story shows)
How tf u get parolled on a double homicide
Ricky obviously tried to kill them both because they did not have tartar sauce for his fish
waiting for yer stories to be declass
Mr ballen needs to team up with the guy on crime zone. That guy has the perfect voice for true crime and he narrates very well also. Yall need to check out crime zone. 💪
Happy they lived? What happened to the dog.
I'd listen to it on YT but yeah, not on here so pass.
What a twist!
mr ballen got me past so many exams 😎
i really like this background
Man. The Appalachian Trail just seems like a bad spot to go.
I’m glad to hear Dale & Tucker survived that evil
Great story, but... what happened to the dog?
I used to watch this show call “I Survived” and Sean and Scott were on there telling there story  on a episode in 2009. I knew it sounded familiar as you were talking about it
Props to Sean and Scott for not letting such a traumatic event ruin their love of the outdoors. Lord knows if that happened to me and I'd survived, you'd never see me even remotely near the treeline of any forest ever again.
I'm really glad those two guys lived but was the dog ok???
Man, you guys should work with Wartime Stories. An animated Mr Ballen series would be pretty sweet
(friggin "murder goats", WTF!?!?) 😱....
I live in WV but worked in Pearisburg VA, which is pretty close to where this all went down. I remember hearing about this when it happened but didn’t know who was involved at the time. I’ve been told this story a couple times by a really good friend of mine. So after listening to this, I texted that really good friend & said, “Sean, you’re on MrBallen this week dude!”
Ricky was a young boy…
Wow! Good story!!
Soooo... what happened to the dog?
Ricky Williams was a rb for New Orleans and Miami
The banjos reference is so amazing
I seriously do not understand why violent criminals are ever. Let back out of jai, especially when you're talking about killings that have nothing to do with a passion. There are so many stories where violent criminals have gotten out of jail and then go on a killing spree
21:23 knew it
I saw Sean and Scott's story on I Survived. At least I think it was that show, but if not it was one like it.
But what happened to his dog?
The text in the thumbnail, “I HEAR BANJOS” was entirely irrelevant to the story
As soon as you described Ricky  mesmerized by the glint of the knife, I knew.....
Hate to be that guy cuz I love your channel but I doubt the legitimacy of this "hungry fisherman" I've been fishing my whole life and EVERY fisherman I've EVER met carry a knife if not multiple knives and a firearm.
Who else listen to MR BALLEN on their air pod or ear phone while working or doing household chores  and also have him on spotify and other podcasts u could get him on
As soon as he mentioned that "Ricky" felt like they were being disrespectful to nature just cauze they played some music, I knew he was the weirdo of this story, huge red flag right there
Im at 8:34 but I believe Ricky is Randell Lee Smith because he also went by Ricky Williams
I'm getting sued for setting my neighbor's front yard on fire. In addition, I 'smashed' the LIKE button and broke my keyboard!🤣
What happened to the dog though?
Didn't see that coming. That was sarcasm.
I really enjoy Bedtime stories. Run fool is mostly made up stories, and that takes me out of interest.
What happened to the dog?
The best is watching Mr ballen I do not like the podcast
He found his boy ❤ they weren’t going out like that.  Great story as always, Mr.Ballen!! Thank you
USA Double homicide let out for good behaviour. Also USA get caught 3 times for selling weed jailed for life.
I love Mr.Ballen videos 😊
The country is being flooded by pychopath hill billies by design of our CIA which is the corrupt church.
He definitely killed more people
Thank you for not pushing the betterhelp scam this time.
randy just needs a few cheeseburgers, and he'll be feeling alright again
What happened to the dog?
He was not "mentally unwell", he was a killer, yt ppl need to stop using that excuse to pretend they aren't naturally bad😂
I'll never understand why someone who murderers 2 people is let out of jail to murder more innocent people..
But what happened to his doggie 🥺
Remind me not to go to bismal creek however it’s spelled or associate with any Randel’s
Well...That's what happens when you give only 15 years for double murder, then they go out an 2 years later you have them tryin' to kill the lads for blastin' some country music in the woods. Come on...! :(
As always great story and storytelling.  Respect! 👍🏻🇸🇪
@3:33 Anton chigurh?
Sean and Scott are beautiful souls. Need more people like them in this world.
This story makes  me a little nervous. My youngest son hikes the Appalachian trail a lot. He wants me to take a hike on that trail with him this spring.
And this folks, is why you don't  blast music when you're out in nature!
Thank you for your service
major twist i absolutely love how you story tell mr ballen! thank you so much for telling scary stories!
Literally just hiked past dismal creek on the AT yesterday
I love your channel, has listened to every episode at least once, some more times than i can remember. But there is one thing that i don’t like, especially since it has become more or less standard which makes it easyer to guess the ending. Ricky was of course not worried for the known killer if he was the killer when Scott came up to him in the begining. That is of course just fantasy. And even if i do think it is okay to assume things to make a living story, to fabricate things we can for sure say was not what was happening is a bit to far from being true crime in my opinion. Several times these fabrications has been made up just to make the ending surprising, which is why i expect it and there for not surprising. This is positive criticism, no hating. You are great!
Why would you be so deceptive and start the story from the perspective of Ricky as if he’s innocent???
I’m looking for something strange, dark, and mysterious. Am I in the right place?
I started thinking Ricky and Randall were the same.  Stop releasing murderers!!!! 😩  They're just gonna kill again. 🙄  So annoying!!!
Scary stuff. I mean, when you are living in the middle of nowhere , it’s all dark outside, and there’s a pounding on the door…wondering if the first thing to do is have an exit plan a damn big dog some weapons handy your trained with a hole in the floor to hide in…maybe even ask,”Who is it?, before unlocking and opening the door?
Am i the only one that wants to know what happened to the dog?
I would not say ”we will never know” if the things came from victims. With todays DNA-searching method where you search for the closest relative in huge DNA banks it is actually kind of likely that we at least could get to know if the stuff came from people that disappeared or not.
Well you got a couple guys listenin to Country music in the outdoors, that could make anyones eyes go red. Not that I support his actions of course.
I can’t lie Mr B I caught the twist in this one a mile away. Great way to tell the story.
So are these stories real or fully fictional???
I wonder what happened to the dogs. Poor angels! Why homeless people want dogs with them? When they can’t take care of themselves! I’m sorry for speaking so but I feel so bad for the 🐕 dogs!
Plot twist
Technically, it's disrespectful to blast country music regardless of where you are.
Lesson of the story. DTA: dont trust anyone. Cuz stone cold said so
Take Me Home, Country Roads
Dude ur the best story teller ever ..I bet the seals loved hearing ur bs when the morale was low or just joking around like all sof do .😅 Would love to meet u .keep it up bro
Never heard of run fool! But is definitely a bit of me 😊 thanks John 😊
Ok, so I was not expecting that ending 😅😅
This shit boring asf . He move his hands around too much
I believe if Scott had not turned on the radio, Ricky aka Randall, would not have shot he and Sean. WHY: Noises can, and do, set off those who have a mental illness.  TRUTH: I've endured Bi-Polar for 70 years and know how fast my state of calm flips to a feeling of horrifying rage. It's set off by 3 sounds, each are bad by themselves with 2 made much worse when together; I'm thankful the third is rarely heard anymore. Two are so-called music so I'm unable to listen to radio and when out I wear noise-cancelling headphones so my choice of calm music drowns out what stores pipe in. THANKFUL: Sean and Scott are two of the most blessed men and while I don't know them I do feel thankfull their lives they survived. That they continue returning to the area and enjoy themselves is what miracles look like! ♰
Mrballen I love your content, my spouse and I watch your videos always. You're the best online story telling we know. I got a question for you , recently you said you had a promo code for a company in which personally helped you which is better help, do you still have the promo code ?
You gotta love Mr. Ballen.
Another good 1
I figured it was ricky at the beginning when they were eating fish
Crazy story! I did see some show that was all interviews with Sean and Scott and to listen to them tell the story of getting down the hill to find help was amazing and terrifying all at the same time. 😮  I also listen to Run Fool and it's fantastic. I've always been into horror stories and True Crime and just recently got into YouTube and podcasts. Totally addicted! 😂😊
If you're going camping, hiking,etc always arm yourself.  Doesn't have to be a gun..bear spray, a knife, baseball bat , the wildness isn't just teeming with animals.
GREAT storytelling here, smart way of telling this story.
Please put more stories in you tube I'm the visual fan 🙏
Good twist 👍🏽
Stay strapped,  my friends.
Good to know they survived and are now at peace
The only small tiny way I can emphasize with the guy is after a lung collapse surgery, the dumb doctor pulls a tube out of my chest as instructed but covers the damn hole with gauze and not the plastic sheet to seal it up and I just felt air seeping through my lung hole through my fingers. In the end my lung collapsed again after that.
i  love you and your content more than youd  know bro. perfect channel to watch while eating after getting home from school
I haven’t watched yet, but the “I like banjos” got me.
i dont understand why people act that way
Jesus, I feel really bad for that dog
Run fool is about as addictive as this channel.. I'm always left wanting to hear more
That code should be a code anywhere and everywhere.
But what happened to the dog though?
If you're a fan of the strange, dark, and mysterious, you've come to the right camp site.
Never go camping without a gun
Simple story telling but incredibly intriguing. This format is why we know about stories from centuries ago. Bravo
Thank you Mr.Ballen
Man, Sean's gut instincts were on FIRE.
❤❤
❤❤
❤❤
I know where your background photo came from. Its an old AT shelter in VA up the hill from The Saddle overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Spent the night a couple times in that very shelter.
Talk about edge of your seat
My ADD brain had such a hard time following this story 😅
I love you Mr.Ballen
The hickup between loud bang and whatever happened next got me so confused, that I had to re-listen at least twice again in that part to understand what actually happened. It went from nice story into chaotic true crime delivery so fast, that it was so confusing for me in the end :D
You def deserved that 8 mill followers n got my sub
WOW! I think that has to be one of the biggest plot twists I have ever heard in a story! Such an amazing story by the best story teller!!
im scared, no bs
Always, always, follow your gut, people. This would NEVER have happened to me. Never, never, go into the woods without weapons or alone, ever. This would’ve turned out completely different if I had been there, instead.
Tell the like button to spell ICUP💀
I trust that the dog got a new home.
What happened to his dog??
What happened to the dog though
Bro these stories have become more Click Baity than anything else....   Trying to Red Herring us.... LOL
Appalachian - - - It's pronounced Apple Latch uhn. ;)
Great story...
the plot twist is always good
Run fool is amazing. I love you MrBallen
I try to stay a fan and enjoy the storeies but man are you getting bad with really making things up just to drag out a story while repeating useless information multiple times.
Definitely…. creepy..thanks for sharing Mr. Ballen!
I’ve heard this story other times but this was by far the best of course!
What is a murder goat?!?
poor dog :(
the way that, John tells stories is so good that I thought Scott was the killer in the first half
w
So far it is about tent, camp fire, and mentally unstable. I will finish my report later.
Loved this story!!! The twist had me like 🫨
Apple-LATCH-uh. You’re welcome!
So why didn't Ricky just leave? I think leaving would have been better than starving to death.
😥AWWW POOR MR LIKE BUTTON. HE HAS A REAL HARD TIME . EVERYONE GIVE THE LIKE BUTTON A LIKE AND THUMBS UP 👍❤.cheers .love mr ballen , yr a legend.
It's great that Sean and Scott made friends out of the ordeal.
Mr. Ballen; you never cease to amaze me of your story telling . Been with you ," like 4/ever). This was one crae crae story. WOW 😲❤
Run fool and listen to Run Fool.
Someone is stealing your stories and putting them out on their own channel:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufHrZVhHcVk
Maybe not too many people listen to Run Fool because it’s not Ballen’s voice?
I hate when Dogs are involved. What happened to the dog?
🌴🌴🌈🌴☕ Mr Ballen you cheap tease now I want to hear the rest of the story
Great telling of the story. Props to both survivors!
Why was the psychopath released from prison after 15 years? It makes no sense
Wow that was an amazing twist
Civilization is but a thin veneer over the primal beast within us all
Whst happened to his dog?
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG?
That story was crazy!! Thanks for another good one!!
Scott should pay better attention to his spidey senses.
So about these podcasts. I keep trying them and i am realizing the reason its not sticking is because its not you narrating. I feel like a lot of people probably share this opinion as well. It would be really cool if there was a way where everyone could choose the narrator they wanted lol
God loves you and takes care of you so that this message reaches you. God is the one who created this great universe and has complete control over it. And the greatest loss that a person loses in this life is that he lives while he does not know God who created him, knowing the Messenger of Muhammad, the last of the messengers, and the Islamic religion, the last of the heavenly religions.  The great intelligence, before you believe in something or not, is to read it, study it, and understand it well, and then you have the choice to believe in it or not. I advise you on this now before you do not have time to do that.
Glad they made it
What happened to randall's dog?
It’s so sad that this could have been easily prevented, but I’m so glad Shaun and Scott survived!
I normally dont immediately re-watch a video but I did this one. This blew my mind. When you said they turned and looked at each other and "Ricky" started running and gunning... I had to rewind, like no way.
This adds on to my fear to go camping.
I really enjoy your story telling style.  Thank you for the descriptive way that you bring these stories to life.  ❤
They still go camping but I bet they are well armed now.   I wouldn't go back.
I really thought you covered this story before. 🤔 I do love your coverage of it though.
I don’t know anyone who likes to dislike the like button so much!
I started off fearful of Ricky because of his description you made and how one could interpret the motivation of describing Ricky that way was to plant a seed that would have us believe even though he posed no threat to anyone someone out there killing people could not use as an excuse he feared for his life and had to kill him or that a killer would not find such a frail older man someone they would have fun killing because it was just too easy!   But now at about 26:30 I paused the video because I am beginning to think Ricky is the killer. Why? Because earlier you mentioned he was telling the campers he liked to pray and meditate. Then later on you mention a recording of eerie Satanic sounding chants. And chants in many religious disciplines are a form of meditation.   Perhaps I am over reaching a bit but your stories often have unexpected twists and the campers looked at each other like he was weird. So that might've been a foreshadowing clue.  I am going back to the video now and trying not to see a comment letting me know if I am right or not lol!
Why give someone who killed multiple people for no reason parol?
Man, that was some story, glad the two guys made it
When the world's toughest soldier is afraid of something then you know it's real scare!
Not actual footage of MrBallen.
I love Mr. Ballen videos but I can't listen to him say "App-a-lay-chan" over and over again
Was Sean's angry glaring some creative liberties for the story's sake, or was it confirmed?
A Mr Ballen camping video. Everything is good in the world!
7-10
Hello, my name is Steven. And I am.. a fan of the strange, dark, and mysterious. I have been for I guess about 4 years now. I’m happy to be here and hope I can get some help. Thank you
What a Twist😅
I feel bad for the dog of this Psycho
Sean IS a big guy, wow! I can see why he felt like he didn’t have to fear anybody.   There’s something that I don’t understand though: How the hell did the police and paramedics get there so quick? It’s like they all showed up as soon as the ladies called them! Weren’t they out in the middle of nowhere? I’m not familiar with Dismal Creek but I’ve been on the AT in West Virginia and the trail really is off the beaten path in most places. 🤔
But Ballen.....what about the dog? :O)
Marked places on the map must have been by some reasoning sacred places to Randall. Also what happened to his dog?
“About 30 minutes later” yeah Ballen, we don’t even remember what the fuck you were talking about cause you put a stupid add in the middle of the best part of your story. Wtf Ballen? This sucks! “About 30 minutes later” lol . Guess what?! Nobody even remembers what was goin on Jon Ballen! Fuck!
Ricky is my name
i wonder if that’s where people are buried
You absolutely MUST also hear them tell their story on I Survived.. season 2, episode 17. They seem like some really great men. :)
Am unwell at the moment and your upload has cheered me up. As much as i love nature, stories like these make me never want to be even a few hours in the woods! Let alone weeks. And that's purely because of people, not mother nature😳🌲
I do not get why anyone hiking on this trail or camping aren't packing, I mean guns, knives etc. I would assume that anyone on that trail is a potential threat to my safety. Sorry but that is the reality of the world now
I like my stories like I like my women… Strange, dark, & mysterious. 🙎🏿‍♀️👩🏿‍❤️‍💋‍👨🏻🤷🏿‍♀️
Damn have I missed these woods stories that remind me why I’m never going camping lol
The creek and surrounding trees Look creepy even through my iPad screen. Also I hope the doggy was ok.
But....what happened to the dog?
Guys, the like button is now asking us to commit arson...
The fact that he was paroled for "good behavior" after killing two people is insane...
I am a pyromaniac.
I remember when this channel had less than 200k subscribers it’s crazy in the past few years since I got out of the Army how this has grown so much. Amazing I love this channel❤
I thought those 2 will kill him first wasnt expectin this twist
I don't know why I always listen to these before I go camping. I'm guessing it's to keep my guard up. Fortunately, I haven't gone camping lately, but I still listen to these just in case.
“But what if he shot ya in the face?” - Lloyd Christmas
900k views and only 65k likes?! If you watch a FREE 30 min video the LEAST you can do is take 0.5 seconds to hit the like button you dorks 😂
I’ve heard this one before. A friend and I were talking about it on Saturday. I’ve often wondered what happened to the poor dog.
Heard this already on I survived and the survivors told the story. But Mr.ballens narration is great
Just another reason to always be ready to defend yourself in the woods you are your own 911.
Why is he so good at telling stories 😮
Wow- that’s crazy! I know the story well. Sean and Scott were good friends with my brother. I remember when this happened and the horror they went through that night. We all graduated from Graham high in Virginia.
Do I need to sign up to post on the Reddit? I have a story suggestion..there was a murder mystery case in my hometown when I was a kid and I would love to hear you tell the story of it..
This one’s twist was crazy!!!
Amazing story
sorry, John, you are the incredible and iconic storyteller now
the death penalty is underused and insane asylums should be reopened
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?! 😩😂
Those last two LIKE button bits. I've enjoyed watching your channel develop ever since your Bell's Canyon days.  Sometimes 3, 4, 5 times a week.  And my sticker with an old wooden sign that said "Bell's Canyon" over a pathway, with a vulture sitting on it and a sneaker in the weeds, was a strong seller!  But these last two LIKE button bits.  Too close for comfort.  And this one about gasoline...is it even legal to say something like that in public?  Isn't it sort of like inciting?
They for sure are best friends ever now
I swear I heard this story first hand from I think a show on  A&E called I Survived..
What happened to the dog tho?
Why Ricky didn’t just go home if he was hungry
Man this one crazy
Awesome story! Also, you’re right - that clip is sending me right over to the Run Fool podcast ❤❤❤
I really like Mr. Ballen. I listend to runfool which is awesome I do wish he would not curse so much.
The real question is, do the still play music in the forest, or did they learn their lesson. Lol
I was lookin forward to run fool. But it just sounds like someone reading a book to u with no enthusiasm, sometimes hes reading fast with no enthusiasm almost as if there just rushing through a homework assignment then theres other times were theres wierd unwarranted pauses. He just doesn't read it like its a story consistently its up an down. Im really not tryn to b a dick but its the furthest thing from storytelling. Its quite literally someone reading a book to you. Sorry but thats how it came off to me.
Shawn and Scott go back there to camp. I bet you they bring a gun this time
I love Run Fool and Rodney's voice and way of telling his stories! I listen every week ❤
I look forward to a new Episode of Run Fool every Tuesday
Whats crazy is he post like one time a week now . That’s so boring .
❤
Yes, the tape was indeed a Satanic ritual
Seems like another "justice system" failure...when is enough, enough?
Going back to Dismal Creek is a perfect way of saying eff you Randall. Thankfully they survived. ☮️🖤
I was on the Appalachian Trail when this happened. I remember hearing about it and seeing pictures of the guy all over the place with notifications to call the VA State Police if you had seen him. He was apprehended quickly and died in jail 10 days later
HAVE NO FEAR, MR BALLEN IS HERE!
I live in Giles county, va. Pearisburg is where i use to live and so crazy this story wound up on the best story tellers youtube. Small world
As someone who lives in VA, and occasionally camps and hikes parts of the trail, it's crazy to imagine that fate could have brought me face to face with this guy at some point in my life, but thankfully, didn't.
Wow I was thinking the two guys were going to hurt the guy with the dog, that took a turn
Matthew santoro brother
Can anyone else find Run Fool on YouTube? For some reason it disappeared
Seen this on i survived
That was an extremely well told story, amazing!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
as a woman who enjoys and often goes camping and hiking alone  with my dog,  and does not carry, though stories like this make me rethink that, I can well relate to" Ricky's" misgivings about these guys, but luckily, the people I run into on my trips are like me, just out enjoying the peace and solitude nature can provide like nothing else know of
Seems my 2  comments were too Harsch for YouTube. I will Phrase it differently: dear Americans, your justice System is not perfect but adequate, and preferable to letting criminals walk FREE on probation after having committed a Gang SA. Yt, this is not fake news. It happened in Berlin last year. They are FREE to play with their Playstation or whatever while the girl will Suffer for the rest of her life. No prison sentences.
All of this happened only because Scott had to blare his terrible country music 😢
The real lesson to learn is don't play country music while your camping.
⛄ 🔪
Mr. Ballen is the best story teller in the history of YouTube. Thank you sir for you contributions every Sunday afternoon. I'm right here in front of my TV listening to Mr. ballen.
Another legendary narration. You're just insane Mr Ballen. Thank you for all the entertainment you've provided. <3
Pahoot Pahoot! Where’s Pahoot?
Great story bro!!! I want to camp now 😂
Out of all the mrballen stories non of them have been able to scare me as much as camping or stalking stories they always make me paranoid for the next week after hearing them yet I don't mind the stories where someone gets brutally murdered or stories about the paranormal something about being abandoned in the woods and being stalked by something and knowing you are completely helpless freaks me out the only thing that sometimes match camping and stalking stories is home invasion stories.
Watch this in 0.5 playback speed 😂
Loved it?
Jesus! John can really tell a story, eh! My goodness. I wonder if he'd ever be willing to do a movie or something... That would be crazy. He knows how to get the suspense going!! Absolutely incredible storyline! Thanx for all the hard work Mr.Ballen 👍🏼👍🏼
WAIT - what about the dog?!
But what about the dog?
I’m so glad the ending was good!❤
I came for the banjos, but I stayed for the flannel.
How can someone who killed two people be paroled is beyond my understanding
I love Run Fool.
Man Mr. Ballen is resorting to arson and vandalism to trash the like button 😂 it won't be too long before he asks us to just murder it
Ive fished here before.  I only live about 30 mins away.
I want a seagull lung pin 😢
How does a person convicted of a double murder ever get released from prison? Totally insane.
What happened to the dog.
Man, at first I felt bad for the skinny guy, thinking, Dude, if you're that low on food, go home! That ended in a hurry.
This is why capital punishment needs utilized. How many innocents need to perish at the hands of these killers. Great story though as always You Sir are exceptional at this. ❤
life was good when mr ballen posted twice a week
This was a great twist i didn't see coming, anyone else wondering what happened to 'Ricky's' dog?
This is why anywhere I go camping I make sure atleast two of us have a license to carry in whatever state we decide to camp in. We've come across some very questionable people that start off cool then turn into weirdos as the day goes on, but that is like 3 total people out of well over 100 we've met, we are always welcoming and always have people spend the day to chat with us or have dinner. You just never know whats going through peoples minds man, you have to be careful.
Damn dude. I’ve been listening for years and this guy can always make a story sound intriguing !
Well I wasn’t expecting that
Hum what happened to the dog please?
Full of thrill and adventure. Very unexpected end no one can imagine. Incredible story.
What happened to the dog?
Great video I’m glad they made it
Man, the way you wrote this story is just incredible, i was feeling really bad for ricky at first and just feeling his pain of embarrassment and "starving" but that plot twist through me so off guard, im so glad scott and sean are not only alive but are doing well, thank you for covering this story and true crime in general in the amazing way only you know how to tell them! 😀
I always look forward to new uploads. The way you deliver a story is phenomenal. You are by far my favorite on here!
Really incredible story as always. My only unanswered question is what happened to Randall’s dog?😂
Living in maine, I will not go in the woods without  a firearm. I had too many bad experiences  from animals and people.  Once a guy claimed to be a warden and tried to get me to put my rifle down, but when I lied and said I knew every warden in the area he switched to a sheriff. I refused his order and he took off. Turns out that he was an wanted man who was breaking into camps looking fr a gun.the real cop chased him through the woods for 3 days before he finally got so hungry he gave up. Never go in the forest without a firearm.
I had never heard this story until a month ago and this is the 5th different version of it ive heard.
Sorry Mr. Ballen but Jesus Christ said to LOVE YOUR NEIGHBORS!!!
When am sad,unhappy feel disown this keep mi company thank you mr ballen...and even doe am watch the video I was anxious to know who was at the women door step and I thought it was Ricky
Why was he paroled in the first place????
9:45 hippy meets hill-billies. (I'm generalizing) When I go in the the mountains, If you stay near road camping sites, you get a mix of hippies and hill-billies. The campsites closer to civilization are mostly hill-billies: glass, garbage, cans with gun shots in them (kids partying too). The further you go, the more hippy the campsites become: no trash, nature. But anything accessible by road can have-hillbilly traces at it. If you want true hippy places, you have to get off the roads. Backpacking is nearly 100% hippy (maybe some horse people). The only way to avoid people, is to get off the roads. I've gone to the furthest roads of the largest wilderness in the lower 48, (90 miles from nearest gas station), and there are still old people RV'ing up there. Or you can find a rough road that goes up some pass, and you will get mostly Jeepers/Hunters (classy hill-billies).
Do you know the way to Dismal Creek?
What happened to the dog Mr B?
Can you do a video of a made up story where the like button goes serial killer from suffering all the abuse from people? 😂
I'm following Run Fool
That was one hell of a twist. Not because of the story itself, but because of how well Mr Ballen narrated it
I just looked into this. The doctors said that Scott had so much muscle mass in his chest that the bullet that went in got pushed back and away from his heart. Insane
I'd like to go back to when we didn't consider a knife a weapon, but a tool that you could use as a weapon if you needed to
Mr.Ballen is the adult version of goosebumps. Love his story telling ability. Thank you for helping me fill the empty parts of my day🫶🏼
Oh wow I've actually heard this story before from watching the show "Dead Silent" such a crazy story. Amazing Sean and his friend survived
Oh, and not the recidivism being alive and well here!  15 years for double murder, and then released for good behavior - it makes my blood boil 😡
Oh no! I thought the "poor old man" was the victim.
Wat hapend with Randall dog?
Mr. B-Allen. I am representing Mr. Like Button as their attorney.  We are asking you to cease and desist all harassment and to make a sincere apology for the years of abuse.  If you refuse, we will begin litigation in the form of doing to you, all of the terrible things you have done to Mr. Like Button. You have 24 hours to respond with your decision.  Sincerely, Social Media Button Protections LLC.
Holy moly, what a story!  I am so happy they survived and made a great recovery.  ❤️‍🩹  Great spin on the story - the beginning made it seem like Ricky was not the villain here.  Great job, as usual.  The Appalachian Trail is no joke
Smith's first mug shot HAD to be inspiration for Anton Chigur's hair style in No Country for Old Men.
Just want you to know you mispronounced  Appalachian.  It us appa latch an. Great stories. I live in Southern Appalachia and that is a common mistake.
Run, Fool is bloody great :]
Why are murderers released it is more than likely they will do it again
Humble request 🙏 plz start uploading atleast twice a week.
Run Fool is my JAM! I have a reminder set every Tuesday morning to listen! 🤭🤭‼️
More soothing than Bob Ross?
I'm pretty sure I know the guy in this story lol
I hate when these bad people take advantage of the kindness of others. I know he was mentally ill so he obviously was struggling, I just wish he could’ve seen Sean and Scott’s kindness through his evil eyes
Dang lol you got me 😅 I never would have guessed that one
The run fool podcast has been such a letdown
15 years for double murder meanwhile a kid accidentally ran over two people and got 27
That Randall should be in life sentence.
I hate our country.  Get 10+ years for stealing any amount of money from the government or state. Get 10+ years for any type of monetary fraud.  Get 8 years and let out early for kidnapping a 15 yr old, r*ping, beating, and to top it all of mutilating by amputating her arm (horrifically sawing and breaking them off) and dropping her body off of a 30ft tunnel underpass onto the jagged rocks below.   But she was alive, crawled out onto the road WITH NO ARMS HORRIFXALLY BLEEDING IMMEDIATELY HAVING SOMEONE FREAK OUT AND ABANDON YOU BY SPEEDING AWAY IN THE CAR  AND SHE FREAKING RAN FOR 3 MILES BEFORE A GOODANG SAINT FINDS HER AND TAKES HER TO A HOSPITAL AND SHE FREAKING TESTIFIED. HE WAS ALLOWED TO GET XLOSE ENOUGH TO PROMISE HER WHEN HE GOT OUT HED DO IT AGAIN TO HER. SADLY HE DIDNT GET HUS CHANVE TO DO IT TO HER. BUT INSTEAD A DIFFERENT VICTIM AND HE DIDNT LET HER LIVE.   8 YEARS WITH ONLY   3  SERVED  I HATE OUR COUNTRY   WHENEVER YOU QUESTION ANYTHING  NOTICE  MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL
I liked run fool but it was hard to listen to with all the cussing. Now I cuss like a sailer it don't bother me but listening to scary stories like that i just cant take serious with the  random cussing
People not from the app mtns: "AppleLayshun". People from the app mtns: "AppleLatchin".   :P
I'm getting "Wrong Turn " or " Texas Chainsaw "  vibes but let's finish
I like your hair
❤
Just realized my town in Virginia was in the cover photo of the video on the license. Wow that was crazy but glad scott and sean survived. Look forward to next video
I know this story, it is so great listen what happened in details, crazy crazy one, thank you, I loved!!!!! Scary and good.
Great story ....its relieving to hear Sean and Scott survived  . Be safe everyone
@MrBallen, instead of gas use fertilizer. It works on high school football fields, just saying
The way of start this story and way of end, can only be done by Mr Ballen. Great Suspense
MrBallen, I love you the way you are now, but I miss part of your sentence, we are uploading 3,4 or maybe 5 times every week.😁
So now we are targeting our neighbours and not the like button? I think you're on to something mate.
What happened to the dog? :(
you're gonna have to dig deeper because this stories already been YouTube recycled a few times. people have been doing awful things to each other since before written history and that's all you got. it was a good presentation at least.
They must not have seen wrong turn🤦🏽‍♂️ should’ve known not to go in any forest in Virginia!!!
This story was featured on the show, I, Survived. 😯
Crazy story
I’ve heard this story. I’m pretty sure this was on the podcast
That sample left me wanting to listen you were right about that narrator's voice.
Ya know what happens when you play country music backwards. . . . . . .          Ya get your truck back Ya get your dog back Ya get your fishing pole back  And I assume everything else
This all is why I don't go camping. Also because I live in Australia
❤️🇵🇹
I think you have a better story telling VOICE 😊
😮😮😮😮😮😮
Man, yhere was a time MrBallen posted 2,3 and sometimes even 4 times a week. Well done MrBallen...will you ever do anything live in DC or Baltimore in the future one day?!
Musta been a 22...
Sean is now a famous rap artist called 50 cent
I don't live far from Dismal Creek...far out
Just because one shows ‘good behaviour’ in prison it should NEVER be a reason to just release a murderer
What happened to the dog 🐕
I normally love MrBallen but I'll be honest, I don't like the dramatised effectively made up perspective for Ricky/Randall. 15 minutes of a creates sympathetic view for an old guy to then deliver the twist that he's the killer. It's unnecessary with this one and could have been achieved just the same using the other two mens perspective of him, not inventing thoughts and opinions that we do not know he had. Dunno why, just seems a bit disrespectful to the victims to do this for effect and drama. I say all having listened for years and love the channel.
Im glad Scott aand Sean survived, I hope the dog also was alive
Accept that U narrate Ur story in His voice when U r doing something,  and the story begins at that moment 😂😂😂 U need to look super cool.
Sean is a few chicken nuggets from a happy meal  Hes a few apples short of an apple pie 🥧  Hes hungry basically
Wat hpnd 2 his Dog ???
Always a good day if a new video from my favorite channel is up :)
If you really want to be sneaky, go to the like button's lawn and spell it out in a thick line of salt.  The grass will slowly die, and nothing will ever grow there again.
Commits a double murder and gets out?! What the hell? Thank God those guys survived! Great storytelling!
I Remember Hearing About This Very Case On The News,
I just tried to ask my Alexa to play Run, Fool podcast and she can't find it on there 😢 am I not saying it right?!
Run fool is a great podcast! I listen to that, medical mysteries and the podcast connected to this channel, plenty of content to listen to 💕
Personal opinion this is on of my favorite channels and thy best channel ❤
But... what happened to the dog?
Day one of asking for a story in the Frankston killings in Victoria Australia
Back then ppl didn't get that much time for that kind of crime.
Can i ask for you to try this in spanish language format?
Wow I wasn't expecting that twist holy shit.
have you ever watched mystery archives on you tube? now there's a voice
Scary stories with survivors. I like these!
Well, loving Appalachian folk music, I've always wanted to explore the area. I think I'll just do it with Google Earth now ...
If Ricky was that hungry, why didn't he just go home?
Is this gonna include loud screaming about seagulls half way through 😢 . Makes Tryna listen to these and go to sleep impossible  ." Which would lead to my phone giving him tons of play time as it goes through his content"
Thumbs down,😂😂😂😂 your move flannel
I feel like I heard this story on Mr. Nightmare
Your talent of story telling is unmatched, the art of your plot twists just blows my mind. I impatiently anticipate every story for you. Thank you. Your the best. And as always thank you for your service. Love you bro and i hope your family is doing great
New title: when country music kills...
You said Run full has the best stories and the voices comforting .No I think you're talking about Mr ballin. I'm sorry sir but you are the best storyteller by far. but your nice, and modest
Is Mrballen podcast on YouTube yours or should I unsubscribe?
You need to change your format because this video was completely unsurprising. That was not a very good twist.
America is the most messed up country with it's laws 😂
Wasn't called DISMAL Creek for nothing, seems like a seriously dark place and who goes to a place called DISMAL Anyway?
I know I'm not the only one who was wondering if that dog was okay when that truck flipped.....
That was absolutely shocking 😮
I watch A LOT of true crime videos, especially about murder/attempted murder.  One common variable between many of these murderers is they were previously convicted of violent and/or sex crimes and later released, only to escalate and kill again and again.  Almost like they should not be released to the general public again
Dude, I love your bedtime creeping story I hope you doing well and have more time to tell us more stories maybe 2 story drops in one week.
But did he ask “Do you know how to get to ‘Bell’s Canyon?”
At first, I thought the two men would kill Ricky and eat him since there wasn't enough food for them in the next two weeks 😂 because that's how your story was telling in most cases.
does anybody else think we need a does the dog die site for ballen episodes ? just to ease some of us.
I’m hereeee🎉
I’ve been watching so many episodes lately that now I use more hand gestures when I talk 😂😂 it’s very handy as I’m trying to improve my online videos on social media. Thanks for epic entertainment ❤
your channel remains the best ever
Unfortunately the run fool show isnt with your voice and story telling style
One day I will hear we upload once a year.
Man you just never know. 😮
Love the camping stories so much bro thank you
Nothing will ever top Bell’s Canyon
This is what happens when you try to help out a stranger
What a backstabber. Only the worst kind of person can turn around and attack someone that has been kind and helped them. No loyalty at all.
LOVE "RUN FOOL!" 💚💚💚 Listen to every episode.
Sometimes when you're good at guessing the story, it just makes the story less interesting. Is there any advice how to not guessing the story I'm growing tired of it
Mr ballen my best story teller interesting stories as always!
This is why you take a gun or 3 camping always
Thank you for using real stories with research and not Reddit and Tumblr stories.
I can’t get past 3.5mins because he mentioned a dog, I need to know if its ok before I can listen further.  Anybody help me out please?
I love your camping horror videos do more please
The US justice system is far better than the majority of the world although it's far from perfect. Using this case as a yardstick to measure and condemn the system is a mistake.  First off, when Smith murdered the two hikers in 1981 he was sentenced to two 15 year terms. Unfortunately they ran concurrently so he had to be released after 15 years instead of 30.   However he was required to be on probation for a decade, including wearing an electronic ankle monitor until 2006.  The fact that he served 15 years in prison and then another 10 on supervised probation yet neither law enforcement or a mental health professional was able to suss out that he was a serial killer and probably incapable of rehabilitation seems like the real issue.   As soon as Smith was no longer being monitored in 2006 he left his mother's house and moved out to the A.T. where he attacked these men and probably was responsible for the death of others.   The state laws where Smith was tried and convicted in 1981 required that he be released after 15 years, although he was on supervised probation. During that time he didn't commit any crimes that the police are aware of.   State laws, like federal laws, are a reflection of the political reality in each particular state. If Smith hadn't been up for parole or if he hadn't served his two sentences concurrently he would have still been in jail in 2006.   People often react to stories like this by saying "the system is broken" despite the fact that the US has more people incarcerated per capita than any other country but China.   The US justice system definitely has serious issues but i would still prefer it over 90% of the countries on the planet.  The main reason our incarceration rate is so high is the decades long failed "war on drugs" and the politically motivated mandatory sentencing, like the 3 strikes rule.  In some states these measures are being rolled back and the war on drugs is spending more on recovery and intervention and less on incarceration.
Oh no not my insomnia waking me up at 5am Monday morning… Just to remember you uploaded Sunday, thank you! Thank you for being my much needed medicine ❤ And damn I was like I knew you weren’t going to tell us his name but I thought Scott was Ricky and Ricky was Sean in the truck but you twisted Ricky was Randall… Great one! 😊
Everyone just remember to put this guys video on 2x speed. Hes one of those guys who loves to hear himself talk, and will do so despite however much boredom you may experience
I really miss the old Mr. Ballin videos. I got addicted to him and now I just feel like the topics have changed completely. Still a fan always love to Mr. Ballin in his family and Ballen Studios ❤ love Dallas Texas.
I remember this story
Was the dog ok
My theory is that those circled places could have been future areas to look for victims once we was done at Dismal Creek.
Mr ballen, the male fairy who appears once a week and graces us with his presence with exactly a 26 minutes. 🥹🥹🧚🏻‍♀️
Halfway through this Story and I already dislike Ricky...... ;p;p;p  Self Centered and Unappreciative.....and These 2 guys sound Perfectly Normal. :/
Wow. MrBallen made very good use of how humans perceive/judge things or other people based on the physical description/ appearances.  Like how the listeners would think that Ricky came across a scary guy or two, when the scary guy was him all along.
thank u🙏Mr ballen 4 confirming my fears of the forest,😬after listening 2 ur oh so MANY stories bout the forest I🙅‍♀️REFUSE 2 have ANYTHING 2 do with a forest🙅‍♀️NO sir😳
What happened to the dog??
Do a story about Marianne Bachmeier such a very very sad story
Was the dog okay?
They sould call it survival camping not camping I think camping sould be learning to live of the land yes I know they call it homestead 😂
Brother you got better voice then Rhodney I will listen to run fool in your voice
Commit arson on the like button huh??  This is going to be a disturbing one.
The phrase "biting the hand that feeds you" comes to mind. This is scary. Imagine trying to help someone you believe is in need and they use it against you to cause harm. Sometimes it's difficult to tell who really needs help.
Ok do not listen to this one while being high...
Hello from Dorchester mrballen good show
I love how Mr Ballen was a real Navy Seal, yet he's approachable like a normal guy.
Omg When the birth certificate came up I was like "omg best/creepiest plottwist ever". And when it came up that rickie is Randall I was like "ha I knew it" greetings from Germany btw❤
Scott and Sean are amazing. getting shot in the face, neck and chest, and still survived the whole ordeal... that's incredible!
What have we learned? Dont talk to strangers in the woods.
Ooooooo why do I listen to Dark and Mysterious scary stories? Because Mr. Ballen tells them so captivatingly. I need a Happy and Mundane story to even me out now.
@11:00 @MrBallen put it on youtube and i'll watch it
“ do you know the way to bells canyon?”  3:20
OK but what happened to the dog ? 🐕
Stop releasing dangerous murderous people just for behaving in prison dangit!
U should make seagull lung merch just saying 👍
That’s great that Sean and Scott are still friends and their would’ve been murderer is dead. Sucks that we won’t know anything about the campsite. Wonder what happened to the dog 😢
This story was funny to me because it wasn't until he explained who Ricky was that I remembered I had listened to another episode that told this story from the other two campers perspective.
Lessons learned , never go camping at creeks named Dismal or scuba diving in Murder Lake or hiking in Devils Pass. Who names these places?
Sucks when you know the story already
😁👋👍👍👏👏💕🙏🏻 Thank you
The reveal was hilarious
Yesiree Bob, "Run Fool" is FANTABULUS.
At least they know they won't be meeting "Ricky" at the creek ever again.
What's this man's beef with the like button😅
The things this guy has made me do to the like button over time is unbelievable.
I hate my neighbors. Where did I put the gasoline now?
1 mil plays overnight, MR BALLEN is competing with MR BEAST now. Verry well done
Following since you got 3 to 4 times a week during the pandemic until now, I'm glad to see shine my brother 🎉
He should change his intro too if your at work and you like listening to stories hit the sub button.😂
Good morning, Mr. Ballen. Thanks for hanging out with me while I get ready for work. 🎃
People with PTSD from shellshock after the wars get very bothered by loud noise, easily makes them violent. Maybe got a large smack on the head in his past (essentially the same as shell shock). Probably really hated the loud music?
Wow. I was NOT expecting the twists in this story. SPOILER:     Incredibly cool that Sean and Scott survived, especially considering the types of wounds they suffered. Just wow.
sounds like Randell was a dumpster diver who possibly would loot clothing donation bins. Also likely had schizophrenia.
Well that was a twist wasn't it! 😮 I'd probably give that map another look though. Jmo
Someone help me out,  Is run fool real stories or are they camp fire stories?
THEY WAS tryna find Bell's canyon 😂
How does a double murderer get out, ever?
What happened to the dog :(
Sean and Scott look like sweet simple dudes just chillin in a beautiful place. I was CERTAIN Mr. Ballen would say at least one died. Thanks to God for preserving the lives of these men from that savage lunatic. Sucks that we live in a world where motherfuckers really livin in a tent in the woods with a pile of glasses and a birth certificate waiting to shoot you in the head for not being crazy af like their possessed ass
Been watching this shit since I was 11 turning 12. Let’s just say my childhood was ruined after watching this guy💀
13:30 you got me there I thought there’s an ambulance passing through in my neighborhood 😂
Wow, Sean and Scott are very brave.  I sure as heck wouldn't ever go camping again after experiencing that!!  But props to them for not letting it ruin their enjoyment of the great outdoors.
We love ❤ you Mr ballen Love from Nigeria ❤…
Excellent job john! This was the best one you have had in awhile. The twists, turns and who-done its were up to par!
The run fool podcast isn’t easy for me to listen to because that guys voice isn’t very good to me it’s hard to listen to him he sounds amateur when it comes to voice acting or story telling
Thank goodness Sean and Scott survived...but I hope the poor dog was ok too. 🥲
They either cleaned the trout or they Filleted them . I’ve never heard of deboning fish.
The best, the most professional, the most hardworking, the most entertaining and the most animated storyteller on the planet.  Also, please send my ❤ to your mom - all the way from Finland 🇫🇮, Scandinavia. If it wasn't for our moms, we'd be screwed.   Your own story about overcoming the depression is very touching. A real troo- per! I'm very happy for you.   Thank you for everything, for all the horrible and shocking stories, Mr. Ballen. 😱
I'm currently at war with my neighbor due to constant noise violations. And then you just said in your video : "Go to their front yard and spell the words 'I hate my neighbors' in gasoline all across their front yard and then light it on fire. 🔥" Lol I've thought about it quite briefly 😂😂😂
54, weak older man ??? Really, Mr. Ballen ???
Is this a re upload? I feel I’ve heard this before could of been different channel though
I was here today.Thank you Mr.Ballen for these stories.
Paroled for freaking murder. Unreal. We're becoming more like Western Europe by the day when it comes to sentencing.
Didn't have any extra gas in a can on hand (thinking the Like button got lucky this time) Soon however, I felt that the other kind of gas was brewing up. So me being me & never wanting to miss a good opportunity, anxiously letting it cook as I snuck my way inside I noticed was getting ready for bed. Being quiet as possible I tip toed to his bed, sat on his pillow and just let her rip! Even though muffled it was still was pretty loud ! Gonna check if he gots the pink eye in the morning!
I feel bad saying this but the way you described the narrator for Run Fool is exactly the way we all feel about you. No disrespect to the other guy he's great and all but he's no MR BALLEN.   But because he is part of Ballen media company I will give Run Fool a fair chance and subscribe to it.
How on earth did they release him after just 15 years. That man belongs to prison and should’ve been sentenced to life without parole
Why didn’t Richie bring dog food. Dogs don’t eat fish..And why did he stay camping if he had no food?
John. Careful with your jokes before the piece. ‘Put petrol on your neighbours’ lawn and set it alight’ lightly to get you onto trouble.
Coffeehouse crime brought me here.😅😅😅
That was creepy. Also creepy for me as in 1977, I was 11 years old, my Dad was Navy and our Navy family met at the Great Dismal Swamp to camp for a weekend. I was fishing on one of the docks there with other Navy brats my age and I forcefully cast my line into the water (unintentionally throwing myself into the water) and almost drowned. This story brought back that memory. Not really related, but the place. I’ll never forget being underwater, not knowing how to swim and seeing eels or snakes swimming to the top of the green looking water as I was submerged. I’ll never forget that day!
yeah yeah yeah, what about the dog???
Correct me if Im wrong but didnt you also tell the story about the first 2 murders which was a woman and a man I believe who also turned out in the end to be Randall? The end sounded so familiar but different victims. Wow you never cease to amaze me. I wish you uploaded more videos, I am selfish and can never get enough of the way your stories reveal themselves. Thanks
WHAT ABOUT THE DOG?! 😢
Ohhhh my bad. That was just me and my banjo, just waitin for someone to squeal like a pig 🐖
please reconsider how u do the ads... before or after... not mid
What a crazy story
Stupid story telling, ricky was shocked by the sound...that he created. Give over
Mr.Ballen deserves an Oscar award for his outstanding narration skills 👏 👌 🙌 👍 🎉😊
As soon as I hear 'Appalachian trail' i buckle in! 🤣
Yeah, when you start hearing banjos, you have gone too far into the woods. Squeal like a little piggy isn’t far behind
“The Appalachian Trail’ is a very safe place…..?! I only know about the AT because I listen to your stories and true crime 🤣
RUN FOOOOL🖤🏃‍♂
Our broken Justice system releases a double murderer to kill again. I wish I could say I'm surprised.
He's a GREAT story teller.. I love his stories I hope he keep the stories coming❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Off to *_RUN, FOOL!_* I go...
dude got beef with like button
Kind of an important detail missing from this story… WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG???
always a good day when mr ballen uploads!!!!!
I don't understand how our justice system determines 15 years are okay for 2 murders. How each case differs is unbelievable.  Maybe the prosecutors need to stop offering deals on cases they would easily win.. maybe they get paid more that way and if so, that's a problem.
I'm glad everything turned out well....but what happened to the pupper?
You told this story before
Always love a happy ending
kyle did this a week ago, i think. The story is very well known
With all due respect to the Navy Seals I was just watching part of a another podcast of a guy talking about Mr ballen interview where he's talking about how the seals were mad at him for self-promoting and he was saying that Mr ballen earn his Trident served his country did two tours I mean what more does he have to do to be able to express himself I have the utmost respect for our warfighters and not even just warfighters just the military in general but how is it that one seal can come out and write books and talk about their experience and yes I know the expression quiet professional but the man's trying to make a living I mean he didn't link know National Secrets telling top secret missions or name any names of active duty sailors so I mean what is the problem if anything he's using his platform to help Advanced awareness for combat veterans through his charity so my opinion I feel as though he's proud of his service we're proud of his service so he should be able to talk about it
"In Alabama, you don't hear boss music. You hear *banjo* music." ~Mike, the One Who Lived
I'm actually really surprised by the lack of people that were on the trail. I did a weekend hike a few years ago and stayed the night a few feet from the trail. Despite the heavy down pours that weekend, I was probably passed by about 4 people per hour. I was near the Southern PA state line. Everyone was very nice and told me to be careful because I'm a small young lady. I wasnt too concerned, I always carry when I'm hiking. It is so disgusting to use this trail of wonderful people as a human hunting ground, just because you know they're going to lend you a hand.
The story we've been waiting for 😱👻
Woah, I never expected “Ricky” would be the killer. I really thought Sean & Scott were the killers or related to the killers.
Your stories are the best im one of.your earliest subscribers i just rarely comment oh and fuck. anyone in the teams eho doesnt support you
Great story, emotional roller coaster of good, bad, madness, wholesomeness, luck and ultimately triumph for Scott and Sean to get back there again and still enjoy it!
I'm making this comment at the 808 minute mark I've already heard this story I definitely love the way Mr Ballen is telling us because if you didn't know the ending you definitely won't be expecting it I'm not going to say nothing cuz I don't want to ruin it for anybody has it😮😮😮😮
I do hate my neighbours bc they are loud, obnoxious and dont take care of their kids 😢
How the hell did the emergency services get to that house so quickly when it was in the middle of nowhere?  The crazy guy should've been in a forensic institute for the rest of his natural life after murdering that couple.  Sounds like he had paranoid schizophrenia and wasn't taking his medication. Or maybe he was just an evil SOB. So, glad to hear the fellas are doing well.   As usual, Mr. Ballen you're a born storyteller, an art few can master.
I hate my neighbors 💀
6:33 Shawn is so cute! He reminds me of Richard Karn who played "Al" on "Home Improvement," in the 90's.
👍👍
I’m genuinely curious what happened to Randall’s dog.
Since finding this channel, I will never go hiking, swim in the ocean, and you damn sure won’t find me anywhere near Yellowstone.
Manu Ginóbili tells amazing stories
I called it when he started acting weird around the campfire but started second guessing myself at the big sound haha
Can I find the “ RUN FOOL” podcast on YouTube Music? I’m not familiar with Podcasts and where I can find them. I’m not much of a navigator when it comes to social media.
It’s Appala-chun!!!!
My neighbour hates me now . Why would you tell me to do that . I trusted you 😵
the way you tell your stories man!! i freaking love the plot twists. terrible story but im glad sean and scott still enjoy camping, nature, and the wilderness and didnt let one lonely crazy man ruin their experience!! lightning doesnt strike twice in the same place i guess!! sean and scott are walking proof. as an og watcher i love love love this video so much. used to always watch you with my grandma!!💗💗 thank you mr ballen. love u!
This was the most interesting story and best video in a while. Love these kinds of stories
I remember watching this story on Kyle Hates Hiking a few days ago. Very cool!
Wow!! Loved it. It's 2:41am in NC and it's been wonderful 2 days after rain on Friday. Hearing lots of cicadas making that noise. Billions of cicadas are expected to emerge this spring and summer on eastern part, so start getting your tune right with cicadas buzzing. I once saw, possibly on first planet earth series of documentaries, that cicadas have certain time when they chirp/buzz. Meanwhile search for the vdo of dog with cicada in its mouth....dog was in dilemma, should I stay or should I go by the clash could've been perfect soundtrack
They have a hiking community here I see them when I'm out running or just working all 70 and over lol bless em
Wow excellent perspective Twist on a story I've heard before. you made the story new again
he has been killing out there for years he clearly said that hes out there for weeks at a time and all them clothes and stuff  thank god them men lived they can test them clothes for dna and see who they belong to. do your job police or can't be bothered
hope the dog was ok
They have a hiking community here I see them when I go for a run or I'm just working all over 70 lol bless em .
Is this a re-upload?
You are captivating! Thankyou for giving me my dopamine hit:)
What distinguishes you, Mr. ballen from others, is the way you tell the stories .. it feels as if you were one of the characters ....while all others are just reciting from papers which makes it very  boring at the end
23:05 that’s a creepy lookin mf
Did this really happen
I just knew that “Ricky” was going to be Eric Rudolph. Whoops
Hi ballen. I saw a couple of your vids some time ago and again now and you're still making these unnecessary hand movements which is very distracting. It's not how you communicate naturally so ease up on that ;D
I believe this was an episode of I shouldn't be alive
The plot twist in this one was as good as it gets
Run Fool is so boring and if I'm being honest, it doesn't seem  like you've put your best foot forward on this story.
Great video!!! 💯💯💯💯 I was on the edge of my seat 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Did anyone else think, until he explained it of course, the special code was like a secret phrase that people say when they run into each other to show that they are fellow hikers?  Hiker 1 : " The squirrels are noisy today aren't they?" Hiker 2 : " As are the chipmunks." Hiker 1 : Nods. " Good luck on the trail brother." 🤣
I hope the dog got a good home.
Lying Randall
broken justice system wtf...I can choose any random person in the youtube commnets and they would be a better judge....What do we need to do to change this? been going on for decades and its worse now.
The narrator of run fool sounds a lot like the one inside my own head…
I love your camping stories. The “running/laughing man in the woods” still has me creeped out.
Really done that story justice Mr. Ballen ❤🧢
Miss these camping stories. This was a great one
Day 154 of doing to my girlfriend the same thing Mr Ballen does to the like button
I wonder if they didn't play the country music would Randall still have tried to kill them
I always feel involved in these stories! Your story telling abilities are remarkable, and I’m always excited to see a new video!
I could have sworn that I was subscribed to this channel… I just subscribed again.
I've heard about this story. Randall also shot his own dog. If I remember correctly, that was the second shot after shooting Shawn. I believe that there are other victims - they just haven't been discovered. The other video on Randall that I saw went into detail about both the first murders, as well as this one. I'm just glad that both Scott and Shawn lived to tell the tale.
How do you let a murderer off after only 15 years.
My neighbours hate you now.....had to blame someone
The best YouTuber ever 🫶 When Someone says  " strange and creepy videos delivered in story format," I always go. Oh Mr. Ballin 😂  Edit: Sean and Scott were just trying to be good and decent human beings 😢 Im glad they both survived and hopefully they havesome decent normalcy after this event
How many dudes are hanging out in the forest with a collection of knives and panties?
We need the David Crowley story told by MrBallen!
I’m so happy they both survived
The camping/hiking stories are my absolute favorites, but they still TERRIFY me as a very amateur hiker, who hopes to one day get better, and spend days at a time out in the forest, as opposed to just a few hours and then going home.
Who on here remembers when MrBallen would hide Easter Eggs in his videos?
RUN FOOL IS AMAZING MRBALLEN,really enjoy listening to it gives the creeps and calmness lol,its a must listen
what a beast sean must be. got shot in the head and chest and still survived!
Bro you’ve already told this story! Smh
sheesh, this nut definitely has more bodies than that. He is the AP T killer. but hes so crazy no one even knows why he kills(like why wouldnt they find out? and why would you release a serial killer who had no motive to kill. he just killed,! lol) or how many bodies he has. a true psychopath. not an angry one, a disturbed one.
Repeat after me "apple at ya". Say it fast now "apple atcha". 😅 You're still the best though!
I hate this, because I love your content. I feel like this story could’ve been narrated without leading the story into a place where you could provide a twist. The story was good on its own. Plus, your delivery is always flawless.
i was going to go camping alone for my holiday this year in BC. but my years of mrballen viewing would simply keep me lying awake sh*£ting myself
I personally prefer Rice for the like button  Mr. Ballen. It's much harder to remove
This is the first time I think that Mr. Ballen has covered something within an hour of my house.
RUN RICKY RUN
This is why you do not release murderers, they never change
Sellout
Am I the only one who wondered what happened to the dog??
Run fool is the shit. Get on it. Trust.
Ahhh yes I will commit arson towards the like button.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxOt2D2DSaw
One day… I played with my banjo so much, I snapped my string
I am so glad that sean and scott survived, I would have been so mad if they didn't.. Of course, you had me believe in that Ricky Was the sane guy all Along. Great storytelling.
When camping/fishing @ DISMAL CREEK winds up taking you up SHIT'S CREEK
Moral of the Story: Don't disrespect Mother Nature in front of Weird Strangers.
...👍🏾🙏👍🏾✨✨✨👍🏾UP OUT TO THAT AWESOME STORYTELL ...THAT WAS SO EXPERIENCED TO WATCH AS YOU MR.BALLEN ...YOU CONTINUALLY STAY UP AND STAND GRATEFUL AND LOVES AND SAFETY AS I WILL SEE YOU IN YOUR NEXT VIDEO SO OKAY LATER BYE SIR✨✨✨👍🏾🙏👍🏾...
How this dude get out of prison so soon after murdering 2 people ? The prosecutor/judge/parole board and whoever else assisted in dude getting outta prison so soon should all be charged criminally with some sort of crimes.
He's told this story before, hasn't he? He didn't include the part about the women, or the cops with the flipped truck. Or the crazy Ricky's chanting. Like, I swear I've heard this. Maybe it's really similar to another story, because humans are the worst.
I love your podcast and have enjoyed and loved watching all of them, but I will never watch Run Fool again. I had enough of his WHITE people are bad jabs that I am good with only ever watching the two episodes. If he could leave all racial crap out of his videos, I think he would have a mush wider audience. He tells a great story. Best of luck to him, but it is not for me.
I don't like country music either. Understandable
Sorry MrBallen, you've used the plot twist setup so much that I guessed "Ricky" was the one trying to kill the other two.
Why is it that when I go anywhere near the like button he says I need to stay more than a hundred yards away from him he said something about a restraining order it's probably nothing 😅
My cat, Chaco Taco, is absolutely awesome 😎
Now that's what I'm talking about, the strange, dark, and mysterious is back, great episode, and why you should be packing anytime you're out in the middle of nowhere. Also Ricky was a great running back in the NFL
That twist tho
As an old school NFL fan, I had a much different Ricky Williams pictured 😂
After everything I've heard about the Appalachian trail over the years, not even Jeff Bezos could pay me enough to go anywhere near it.
The way you told this story was masterfully done. What a twissssst
Great story well told. What happened to his dog?
what an amazing story.. the two dudes ended up surviving getting shot, and the guy who shot them died to a blood clot right after 🤣🤣now they're camping living life, and the weird dudes laying in a coffin 😂 so much for being in tune with nature
**NOT a real photo of Ricky’s fishing line 😂
I'm struggling to follow this one because I suck at remembering names. I don't know which one is the one with the dog, or who shot whom because I can't remember which name goes to which person.
Remember this ep from “I survived “
Yeah! Back to the good old Forest/Wilderness Stories! Those are some of the very best and most disturbing!
I guess, country boys CAN survive!
Never heard of dismal creek but recognized the hospital picture as one about 15 minutes from me.  This happened very close by.
Why am I watching this right before bed
Mr. Ballen fishes for COCKS. He absolute favorite catch is the elusive PENILE TROUT and DONG BASS !!!!
How the fuck is a double murderer paroled in the first place? Throw away the goddamned key.
Another strange, dark and mysterious story but not a tragic ending. 😊😊😊
Ricky and his dog should have packed a lunch so they wouldn't have been so damn hungry. Mr. Ballen NEVER gets hungry when he's out fishing or involved in some other outdoor adventure because he stays full from eating so many DICKS !!!
I've been to Amicalola Falls, which marks the beginning of the Appalachian Trail in Georgia. My friend Brannon and I kayaked Amicalola Creek. There used to be a huge tree strainer preventing the ability to kayak down Edge of The World rapid, but Brannon chopped it up and cleared the way for whitewater kayakers to once again enjoy. yay!
I am a die hard MrBallen fan, and gave Run Fool a true shot...but I personally didn't like it and found most stories cringey.
I thought Scott's co-camper wss a Bigfoot.
Don't talk to strangers
There really are crazy people wherever you go.  🤷‍♀️
So glad to see your channel keep growing Mrballen. Idk for sure when you started, but I’ve been here for a long while. Your videos get me through the week. Keep being awesome! 😊 I want to say I’ve been here since the story from your personal life at the ski resort with your childhood friend, but maybe that’s just the first I remember. Either way, I’m sticking around! 😁 edit: it’s been a while if memory serves since you did the little hide and go seek in the video.
And this is why you will never see me hiking.
I like peanut butter.
That was a good twist. Didn’t see it coming. The other 2 dudes are lucky to be alive
Wow this was a crazy horror story.  But so glad those two men survived. Great story
I'm really starting to be afraid for Mr Ballen's life on what the Like Button would do to him😅
I love hearing about your recommendations but I haven’t t found one as good as yours ❤
Appalachian   is not pronounced as appalashun its appalaCHUN
Im curious why at the beginning of your story you would pretend "Ricky" was worried about the woods about the murder of the 2 people just less then 2 miles from him yada yada when he himself WAS the murderer?? You painted him as this timid guy afraid of his shadow sitting at a campfire with people that were whatever when he infact was a psycho
“Rikki Dont Lose that Number”…NOT
All I can think about was your PNW stories out here yesterday deep in the woods. Heard this weird noise.  It was like…. A radio call… like a voice… but it was a call… sooo creepy. Getting goosebumps talking about it .
I think it's possible the map was mostly benign. If the Dismal Creek was marked, that is already the location of this camp. It could just be that those locations on the map are places he liked to stay at. Similarly, the collection of clothes and such, rather than being from murder victims, could have been petty theft instead. Ya know, a wild man sneaking into a hapless campers campsite in the middle of the night and takes some random item. It's possible he hadn't made any other attempted murder in the time since he was released to this incident. Not that it makes what he DID do any better. Just that it could explain some of the oddities of the case.
Sean is a real life Viking. A natural superhuman. Strong guy 💪🏻
I am glad that both men made a full recovery, but I can’t be the only one wondering… What happened to the dog?
Johnston, Lasard?
I absolutely love all things horror and can’t wait to check out run fool!!!
Speaking as a personwho grew up and still spends their time in the woods of Kentucky banjos is never a good sound😂. And eastern Kentucky is straight up like deliverance right next door to West Virginia
Really enjoyed the story.👺
id like to make it to a live telling camp style. Mr. Ballen your the man, thanks for your time and content sir 🙏
The like button left with the fishermen
I'm so disgusted with this country when people commit truly senseless murders, are convicted, and then get out again.  I'm not for endless retribution, but if they seem as though they truly are repentent, just give them extra books to read and an extra helping of mashed potatoes - but don't ever let them out again unless the verdict is overturned because they were wrongly convicted.  I've met two bone-chilling murderers in my life, and the thought that either of them might ever get out of prison is terrifying.
Do you make stuff up
What about the dog? 😫
But what happened to the DOG?!
What about the dog?
Ballen is The best Ever ❤🎉
Iga chads
Glad Sean and Scott survived!
I live in Western Virginia and have stayed near the trail often fishing and camping.  My friend from back in the day was always with me and we were always armed.  We were polite to everyone we encountered but never trusted a single other soul.  If it were after dark we took it for granted that nothing good happens after midnight, and thankfully never were approached or for that matter ever saw anyone else at night.  It's a hairy place though, no wonder it draws the outcasts. I believe a visible sidearm is a good deterrent to people scoping out an area during the day.
But was the dog ok?
What are the links between kratom and seizures?
I think we can see Shawn's massive balls in the last photo.
yo like button didnt get tortured this time
I'm sorry but I can barely understand the guy in the clip of the new podcast 😭
What happened to the dog?
I love listening to Mr. Ballen's stories. The forests and wilderness stories are always the ones that keep me up at night.
Yea I heard this story they some soldiers ❤
These scary camping/forest stories are the best
Randall is demon possessed. He was evil incarnate.
May I have the podcast title to this video?
Mr. Ballen, a.k.a, Hand talker 🤣🤣🤣🤣 cool stories bro, your hands just don't stop though 😂
Glad they survived but Sean should get those bullets removed out of his system though😬
#RunFool Narrators voice is so soothing and i sleep everytime i try to hear a story at night 😄
This is why you never trust people you meet in the wilderness.
Of Mice and Men.
At fast I thought Ricky would be the victim
yo Mr. Ballen how come you don't do spooky ghost & supernatural stories anymore?
8:25  Ricky asks meagerly “hey, can I have a knife?”  Foreshadowing, if I’ve ever seen it.   Dum dum dum-dum duuuummmmm
As I was hearing the story I thought that Scott and Sean were going to be the crazy ones but NOPE. It was Ricky / Randall
This was a great story for sure. I'm always wondering where in the world are you getting all these great stories from and just the way you tell them is amazing
MrBallen reminds me how people do weird and strange the things to each other
Sorry man. It's not your voice doing Run Fool. Just ain't the same.
I understand the significance of letting us know when we're seeing a real photo but did you really have to tell us that wasn't a real photo of his fishing line? Come on
I love Run, Fool! It is almost as good as Mr Ballen. I can't stand the bed time stories podcasts that name voice grates my nerves.
It's insane to me that if you kill someone you ever get to see freedom again. In fact it's a waste of tax payer money to even waste funds keeping them alive. If you blatantly take the lives of others, you should forfeit yours. Also i hope those guys learned to start carrying a gun if your in the woods, for humans and other predators. Especially the 2 ladies in the cabin.
Not into the Run Fool podcast the guy doesn't sound convincing or scary more scripted I'll pass.
I did that and they called the fire department then the law  Thanks man By the way did I win
My only question is, is what happened to the dog?
Damn! 👍 you know the rest homie
That podcast is just…no.
I remember this story from I Survived, but this was somehow even more informative and definitely more enjoyable
You are awesome, John! I wish more men were like you.. xo
Thank you for your service man, I’m in the Army and I have a lot of respect for anyone spec-ops.
I don't know why I keep watching this...oh yeah, he's an amazing storyteller. Unfortunately, I am now very nervous every time I camp..
Just in time for the camping season to get started
What happened to the dog at the end?
The whole 26 minutes, I couldn't turn my head off to stop thinking about Tucker and Dale vs. Evil..... :D
This is why I never go camping!!
I know your exact location…and I’m coming
Run Fool with Rodney Barnes is everything i feel i wanted in a horror story... DEFINITELY keeps my attention
Mr. Ballen, Your voice is the best I’ve ever heard 😊 You sound almost identical to a radio DJ that I listened to a lot in my young adult years. Anyway, I love this channel. You’re an awesome storyteller! Love from Alabama❤
repeat
Theres an episode of I Survived that has them interviewed about this event, its a great episode!
Finally another wilderness story I love these
dude was a CANNIBAL!!!
My boy Seagull Lung been neglected the past couple weeks lol😂
lets get to 10 million subs
Or just don’t go hiking with high risk of dangerous conditions and horrific stories just camp near society with everyone else safe and sound not a suicidal experience area
The picture of Randall when he was young kind of looks like the creepy sketch of that urban legend that supposedly many have dreams about.. AKA "This Man".
Is the background music a distorted form of Hotel California ? Every time I hear it that's what my brain tells me.
Thankfully, it was a .22 caliber revolver which is probably the main reason they survived.
See..... This is why my kindness to strangers is always done in a very guarded manner. Never too friendly. Anyone asks me for help, I'll help them but then *immediately* move on/leave.
What happened to the evil monster's dog after the car rollover????
This story is exactly why I don’t go camping!! Great story Mr. B! Keep it up! I’m looking forward to listening to Run Fool! Say “hi” to ol’ Seagull Lung!
All that stuff they found in his tent could have been things other campers and hikers left behind. If he truly thought it was  home, anyone leaving trash behind would have been seen as being disrespectful. Maybe he collected it and noted the locations in an attempt to keep track of the spots to check for more trash or victims.
Randall should've gotten life or the death penalty for murder.
Wow, it's amazing that Sean, and Scott both survived and awesome that they didn't let an incident like that destroy their love of camping.  Great job as usual Mr. Ballen 👍.
I live next door to the like button, and I'm actually just really easy-going.
"Ricky" seemed weird the whole time from how you described him. I have hiked around there and there's no reason you would be stuck there without food so long you'd be skinny. It's easy to get to civilization from there - something is wrong with you I hope the dog was ok
can’t wait till he hits 10 M subs
A Huge component is missing from this story. One that I wish Mr Ballen had included. We know what happened to all the humans, but What happened to the dog?? Did he get left behind in the woods?? Was he rescued?? Was he thrown in the pound or taken care of?? 😢
!!!HUGE MAN!!!
I just heard this same story a few days ago
wish i could do the like button task to my current neighbors hahahahahaha
Those of us who are old enough. We thought “deliverance” when we saw the title 😂
Place names hold a great deal of information ... the naming is never entirely arbitrary.
I honestly don't know how in the ever-loving hell you murder AT LEAST 2 ppl for no reason and get a 15-year plea deal (I assume Randall was absolutely insane and they were scared of an insanity defense working)...I wouldve assumed life wout or the death penalty.  I think a Mr. Ballen investigation into wtf happened there as well as an investigation into the Stephen Paddock case and his close friend who somehow seemed to know what and why was coming but who incredibly was never even interviewed by the FBI would be 2 of his most incredible vids he's ever made.  I understand he's a scary story teller but honestly what in the f happened in these 2 cases?
We watched this streamed on my hubby's phone. This was wild! MrB, you have got to be the best storyteller ever! I don't think we blinked once. ❤
Tell the like button his favorite wrestler is signing autographs but when y'all show up it's really just John Cena
Imagine if the radio killed the battery in the jeep
Nope ! You Are Still the Best Voiced Story Teller Telling Dark Strange and Mysterious Stories in Story Format  Mr. Ballen 😎
I've watched enough of your vids to know from the very beginning- freaky Ricky was of course the culprit. You're becoming predictable! More seriously, I've just been watching your vids for a long time, don't change anything, you're an epic story teller! :P
What is the point of those weirds comments about the like button??
He murdered because he was a punk. That’s why u carry a gun not a log
I am so relieved that Sean and Scott survived such a harrowing experience! To top it off they still enjoy camping which is awesome.   That said…. HOW ON EARTH DID HE GET OUT OF JAIL AFTER MURDERING TWO PEOPLE THE FIRST TIME WHAT WAS THE JUDGE/PROSECUTION THINKING!!??!?
What a bitch and he has a fur baby. But who hangs with strangers in the woods.  Man B tells a gr8 story
Love Run, Fool! Rodney's storytelling is great! Awesome pacing. Can't wait for prt2 next Tuesday
LOVED ALL YOUR VIDEOS KEEP UP A GOOD WORK. KEEP TELLING STORIES ❤❤❤
Make run fool available on youtube
He only served 15 years for a double homicide?  WTF!!!!!!!!!
That was a dark sensation of the like button but still hilarious
But what happened to the puppy?!
I had just recently heard about this story and was excited to hear Mr. B’s spin on it. As usual, he didn’t disappoint!
It may be there was no match to DNA on the other items found at his campsite bc it's Appalachia and possibly there are people living there that aren't even on paper
Oh jeez if they hurt the fur baby I’m never listening again. They r so much more loving and loyal than people. Come on Mr. B let pup live lol
I love how you put us in the perspective of the criminal. It made the story much more interesting not saying I sympathize with Randall Lee Smith, but the way you told the story made me believe for a second that the two men were the culprits. You made Randall or what he was going by Ricky sound so innocent. I guess you don’t know the true details of what that man felt before he did what he did and lord of it is filling in the gaps but bravo on just well done storytelling even if some of it is probably just exaggerated.
So let me get this straight....this man murdered two individuals. They don't know what the motive was except that he's just a murderer....and he gets parole??? What part of ''he's a murderer" do they not understand??  How many more people like this have they paroled and let loose to murder again?? I'm rapidly becoming pro-death penalty. This man didn't deserve to live when he takes the lives of others like it was nothing.
Old story. I heard it told on “I Survived” a long time ago. Glad to see Mr Ballen retelling it in his own unique way
I knew ricky was the serial killer. The fact shaun reached for a club and not a gun shoes he wasnt the one who fired . And The fact that they fed him and could have killed him any other time.
What happened to the dog??
Currently camping while watching
Great tale! I'm so glad the two men recovered from their injuries. And wowza, Sean is YUUUGE!
Dude? Seriously........ arson...............?????????
APP-uh-LATCH-un Trail. Great video as always, otherwise.
What happened to the dog??
….But what happened to Ricky’s dog??
What happened to the dog?
I saw Sean and Scott on I Survived, but because Mr Ballen is the best story teller, i didnt connect the dots until the end
Why in the absolute F*ck would anybody grant parole to a person who murdered not once, but twice in cold blood?! They let him out just so he could almost kill two more people, and who knows how many people they never found? Cold blooded convicted murderers should at the very least get actual life sentences, not just a decade or two, no parole.
Whats crazy is, if this didnt happeb to sean and scott, who knows how many more people wouldve died or how long his reign of terror wouldve went on for. Im so glad they survived. Who knows, maybe randall just hid the other potential victims well. Its such a shame that good people always get the worst luck. But im happy theyve overcome this scary situation and can still go and camp and hike there. Ive always wanted to hike in the mountains, i like about 2 hours from the appalacian mountains in nc, but all these mr. Ballen stories (especially the missing 401 or whatever its called), they got me thinking differently lolol or to at least bring my pist0l and a recording device if i mysteriously vanish lmao
You are my YouTube 🫶🏽. Every time you say “ if you’re a fan of the strange dark and mysterious delivered in story format” I always say “I ammm” 👏🏽😊😊😊 i just get really happy watching you telling these amazing stories! I watch you everyday! Thank you so much for all the good storiessss. What you do is amazingggg! You’re awesome 🙏🏽
I know this episode of I SURVIVED
Ricky just sounds like he wasn’t making smart decisions.   If he was running out of food why didn’t he leave?   If he knew there were murders why would he linger?
Randall Lee Smith might be a wolf in sheep’s clothing. I have a feeling that Sean Farmer and Scott Johnston would’ve automatically died if one of the bullets pierced through one of their vital organs. Fortunately they survived their near fatal gunshot wounds. I would’ve never imagined being put into a situation like this—this is much more terrifying than average horror film.
Kyle Hates Hiking did this story awhile ago and MrBallen's version of it is told so differently I didn't even realize I'd heard it before until nearly the end
That should be the code anyway… at least in Minnesota it is. If someone needs help, you help them. I thought that was human thing. But I guess not.
I am here with you not spotify😢or whatever. Thank you sincerely I appreciate your stories 😁👍✔️🐕‍🦺🚶🙏✔️
GUARANTEE THEY CARRY WHEN THEY ARE CAMPING 🏕️ 😮 I AM SO HAPPY THEY SURVIVED
This is why I don’t trust anyone, regardless of age.  I’ve heard many stories of old people like this.  Sometimes they will deliberately use the fact that they’re old to get you to let your guard down.
always assume anyone you meet in the woods is a criminal
Love ya channel....thank you! 😁✔️🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🐕‍🦺🚶 Washington State USA
Double murder an got out to kill again 🤔 well he tried didn't he.
Seriously Àny backpacker wil draw toward himself..,... survival..the Dog is his protection. Seriously I backpack alone w dog. Hummmmmm ya.  Never
I love your channel and can’t even count how many times that you’ve told me stories until I fell asleep! But I have 1 small complaint.  Having been born, raised and still living in the Appalachian mountains, it drives me nuts to hear you pronounce it wrong.  It isn’t “Appalation” as lots of people pronounce it.   We have a saying in the Appalachian Mountains “Don’t pronounce it Appalation or we’ll throw an Apple-atcha!” 😅😅 The “ch” is a hard sound.  All of us Appalachian natives would appreciate you pronouncing it correctly! Thank you for all you do!
The fact that Mr Ballen tells true stories is insane
Oh Yeah , Now We're Speaking My Language  , Camping !
Yes, this is the kind of content I been longing for,  Camping, forest, fire tower, trains & cars in the middle of nowhere/ traveling through forests, dash cams in the middle of nowhere,   That type of stuff is so interesting and scary.
Perfect timing thanks Mr.B
What happened to the dog?
I'm never disappointed 👏👏👏✌️🪖
Ya🤨
those are some brave dudes returning to the creek after all that. don't think I would do that, even with a gun.
Glad they survived! I've been listening to Run Fool for a while now.. it's cool, but nobody tells a story like Mr.Ballen ❤
Run Foo!l is awesome love it. My 2nd favorite
When they go back now I bet they are well armed never go into the woods without a weapon
Been watching you since the beginning and still love this
Yay! Finally more camping stories
@MrBallen Are you aware of TM Podcast using your videos with generic screen saver images?
I still hear do you know how to get to Bell's canyon
this is probably the nicest flannel
A very well told story! Although, I think Randal would take offense to your pronunciation of Appalachian 😉
This. Story. Is. WILD!!!
Anyone starting to get the impression that this guy doesn't like the like button?
Wow!!!!  That was a GREAT story!!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Woahhhhh jawdropping turn of events
Man..Mrballen is really cashing in on his popularity. Seems like every single video he has started a new podcast or is selling something.
As a Virginian who lives in the Roanoke area, I never had heard this… kinda scary, good video!
No one tells any stories like Mr. Ballen! Did I miss what ever happened to his dog? Poor pup ❤
The committee that gave him parole after fifteen years should spend the rest of their life in prison.
I don't want to hear anyone else but you tell stories
Given the Like channel doesn’t have a yard to write nasty grams on  - the joke seemed rather dark. We don’t need extra dark w/ strange, dark, & mysterious. I’ve watched & loved you from day 1! But please stay positive.
What happened to the killers dog?
Ohhh, this one had a great twist. I was not expecting Randall!! Well done as always, Mr.Ballen!!
I just heard this story recently.  Did you make up the part where Ricky was scared?  Did u make up the part where when Ricky was done eating he decided to get up and go back to his camp?  I remember Scott saying he just got up and turned around and shot Sean first then him.😕😕😕
Why pull any American go into the wilds without a gun??? Use your 2nd amendment rights
it's funny cause all those i need feminism women are lonely as hell now and all the men are married to women from other countries.
I'm gonna throw an apple atcha until you learn how to say Appalachia ;)
0:58 Runescape flashback.
I don’t understand how he got out of prison after a couple of murders before.  So glad both those men survived!!
Imagine only serving 7 1/2 years for k!lling someone 😒
Didn't see that coming!!
Another wonderful story about how left wing "justice" policies let violent criminals out of prison who then murder again
AHHH!  I’ve even heard this story on MFM from the other angle and it STILL got me!    Perfect storytelling as always!    (And SSDGM!)
What’s with the insanely cringey like button comments
You should post every week I love your videos a lot mane❤
I like to imagine being in a crowded room, watching him tell a story while being too far away to hear anything over the noise. His gesticulation tells you everything, I'd be absorbed just watching him tell the story.
SPOILER SHIELD
I remember when the original Dismal Creek murders happened. It freaked everyone out that lived in the Appalachians. My grandmother's home wasn't far from there and we were never allowed to play in the woods again. People are just no dang good and ruin the world for the rest of us. That's what mamaw used to say. She was right.
Great video! Thanks for sharing.
I have several chilling camping stories. And yes Mr Ballen can use them. Let me know if you need more detail.   1. Human vs human (less exciting but was still scary) My husband, daughter and I went camping. My daughter was young, very young. I won't disclose how young to avoid the comments about her being too young and taking away from the points. We set up off a back road that led into the mountains. It's called Truck Road out Butte Falls, Oregon. It leads up into the woods and even pops out on major roads if I remember right.   Anyway we get our tent and easy up set up and start enjoying our time. Everything seems normal, quiet. Peaceful. We made dinner and went to bed.   At almost 5am we had to get up to take my daughter outside to use bathroom. My husband turns the lanterns on in easy up next to tent so we can see.  We were laying back down and I hear a vehicle coming. We had been out here a few times before and rarely seen vehicles but it does pop out and lead else where so it could have been a hunter or even law enforcement so we quietly listen for how close the vehicle is approaching.   We were camped around a little raised pull off that over looked the main road so we could see down where the vehicle was. The vehicle started honking and a man yelled something we couldn't understand. My husband armed himself and we waited to see what the man in vehicle would do.   The vehicle left. Did not approach. So it wasn't law enforcement, law enforcement would have checked in with us.   We were beyond creeped out and this sense of unease was overwhelming, too many unknowns. Who was this man? Why did he honk and holler then leave? Not that I wanted him to come closer, BUT WHAT WAS HIS POINT?   When I come across campers I turn around and leave quietly. I don't make myself known at 5am by being obnoxious.   I our my daughter in truck, then We loaded up all of our camp gear in like 20 minutes. Maybe less. We were scared. Armed, but scared. Our gun safe doesn't fit all of our weapons but we didn't know who this person was or why they had found our camp spot or what they wanted so bad to be as noisy as they were.   Husband and I climb into his lifted ford and THE VEHICLE CAME BACK!!!!! As we climbed in- the vehicle approached. Was the same one. Dark 4 door car. It was just light enough when it came by first time at 5am to make out if color was light or dark and what kind of car, like we could tell the silhouette was dar and an suv, it wasn't a tiny car or truck.   The car was different this time. It had 3 other people in it. Men it looked like. We didn't get a super close look of who was in vehicle like individuals faces but it was 4 decent sized people in it so they were at least adults if not all men.   I told my husband to pick up his speed and drive towards the car. If the car didn't move to allow us to pass:, hit it with our lifted truck. Truck is lifted enough that an impact with car would have damaged our bumper and wench but that's it, we'd be driving away and they wouldn't. The car was blocking the only way to get on the main road from our raised pull off. As we picked up speed the car backed up suddenly turned around and left, going quick enough to kick up dust and block us from seeing the license plate. We would have had to have gotten super close to see it and we didn't want to interact we simply wanted out of the situation.   What did these men want? Why did one guy holler at us then leave and bring back 3 more men? What would have happened to us if we went back to sleep instead of leaving as quickly as we did? Did making the knee jerk reaction we did save our lives? I don't know the answers and never will, mostly thankful. I just hope these men didn't harm other campers who were innocently enjoying nature.     2. Human vs unknown (mini stories as there are 3 id like to share)  A.) The white dress lady. (Most recent) Last fall upon leaving one of our favorite swim spots in the woods at a fairly used spot, it was starting to get dark but not fully dark. We exited the little road that led to swim spots and camp spots when my daughter asked if I seen the lady in the white dress.  I said no but my husband said "you seen that too?" to my daughter. I said "seen what?" My daughter said there was a lady standing by the tree In a white dress but she couldn't see her face and she didn't wave back at her(daughter). I didn't notice it but both my daughter and husband did.  My husband asked if I wanted to go back and my stomach knotted and I told him we cannot help her right now... pretty sure it was a ghost or spirit or something not really there but still there...  B) "The rock" We found a new area on Google maps and went to explore it (DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU ARE UNPREPARED TO SURVIVE IF YOU GET STUCK SOME WHERE AS GOOGLE MAPS DOESNT SHOW 100% OF CHANGES OR ISSUES WITH THE ROADS).  Husband and I pull into this pull off camp site and explore it for a few minutes to stretch our legs. The water that should have been there was dried up that time of year so we didn't want to stay long was hot and we were looking for a place to cool off. After a half hour or so if hanging out at this spot we decided to load out kids up, son and daughter. Husband was changing my son inside the car and my daughter was running on the driver's side of the car in front of me. Everything was normal but I had a feeling of being watched. However no other cars were around so I figured maybe a deer was watching us or something and my sense of unease was just misplaced.   Then, I felt a thud about 2 feet behind me.   EVERYONE I HAD WITH ME WAS IN FRONT OF ME. Husband was about 4 feet away changing my son and my daughter was about the same distance but like to the left not right by the car.   I 100% felt something behind me, one thud. Felt the vibrations in my feet.   I look behind me and this rock is laying there than I hadn't noticed before. Not that I notice every rock or stick but this rock was foot ball sized and I had just walked from that direction and the rock would have been a rock I would have seen.   I told my husband we needed to leave and I mist have been white as a ghost or something because he rushed to finish my son and loaded my daughter quick. I didn't move until my daughter was in the car.   I'm 80% certain something threw the rock and it landed 2 feet behind me, like if I backed up a big step I would have tripped over the rock. It was that close. And if something didn't throw the rock, then I cannot explain the thud I felt in both feet but no one else noticed.   Why, and what, would throw the rock?   Last one I'll share for now: C.) The scream Husband kids and I went to have a cook out in the woods. We found a camp ground that was closed that time of year for some reason maybe government shut down? Not sure. Anyways we drug out the food and made burgers and hot dogs and we ate and had a good time. As it started to get dark we loaded up the kids then I started to help my husband load the food while he went to get water from the creek nearby, maybe 50 feet away. After he disappeared I again felt the unease of being watched. I had loaded everything other than my husband's stuff he would grab in a second when he returned with water so I got inside the car with kids. My daughter said it was cold so I turned car on and turned on heater. Then I heard the loudest, high pitched scream I've ever heard. Almost like a banshee from mass effect 3. (Look it up)  I locked the doors and looked at my daughter who didn't seem as scared as I did so I just sat there watching for my husband to come back with the water. He finally did like 30 seconds later although it felt like an eternity. I asked if he heard anything while getting water and he said no. And he looked at me and said "I'm guessing you did?" So I explained it and he re locked the doors and we drove home.   Is it possible to hear a warning from someone or something without an actual noise being made others can hear? I know I heard something. But no-one else did...     I'm terrified of the woods but I don't want to stop living my life. I haven't gone camping since the first part of comment we just do day trips to places. But now even that feels uneasy. I want to find my peace in nature but unsure what that would take. Not even sure if I can. Weird things happen out there I cannot explain. Seems like once every dozen trips out something will happen that isn't a good feeling...
@21:56  The missing person poster is really quite misleading.  He was a potential danger to others and the writer of the poster did not hint at that. Amazing those two guys survived this wacko.
What happened to the dog
Was the dog ok?
this was literally insane to me. no one could tell it better!!
I know it’s a joke, but don’t do it, that’s arson.
You're so handsome...I need to see your hair!!!❤❤❤
Wow
I live in the "boonies" and just yesterday, while talking to a couple who moved here from a bigger city, told them they need to always be carrying when they are out hiking, riding their atv's etc. Never know who you might run into. There are a lot of weirdo's who think the boonies are a great place to disappear.
It would be less depressing if you said "every week" instead of "once a week".
I've been watching mrballen since the 90k mark now it's over 8.1m, man has grown so rapidly I'm impressed.
If nobody has listened to run fool you should already addicted & up to date
I have learned watching these videos, trust no one!
This is why I will never visit America even if I was paid to. This would never happen in Singapore or Japan or Malaysia where I lived
How did Scott lose his right hand?
Sean is an absolute unit
God vs. Satan. God won.
Ok but what happened to the dog????
I live 20 miles from where this happened and I never heard this story before! very sad
Yankee white… always be ready to “kill people and break their shit!”
Really loved the way you set this up by making "Ricky" the story's protagonist! Love it when you twist up the story like that to keep us in suspense. ❤
The YouTube Channel "That Chapter" did this same story weeks ago. It sure seems like MrBallen is just redoing stories I have already heard from That Chapter. This has happened several times.
Whew pretty harrowing stuff. You should do one on the Meredith Emerson murder by Gary Michael Hilton. Another freaky Appalachian trail murder around that time.
NEVER go in the mountains, especially a national park, unless you’re packing heat.  Period.
dude.. sirens began blaring around my apt complex just as you got to the part of the bleeding man showing up on the women's doorstep and I had to put it on pause and take a breather. dang, that got too creepy.
I knew Ricky was a hippie.
What happened to Ricky's dog??
I love how many former navy seals look like the neighbor who will fix your lawnmower for weed… and probably are that neighbor
I like how you framed the story originally to portray randall as the victim until the very end. Great storytelling
To anyone who has listened to Run Fool, is it super scary?
17:20 WOOOO VIRGINIA MENTIONED ‼️‼️🗣️🗣️ WHAT THE FUCK IS A NORMAL STATE GOVERNMENT
Way to go releasing a double murderer after FIFTEEN years for GOOD behavior?!?
There is a photo of "Mostly Harmless" somewhere on YT.  He looks like he could handle do some harm. Not imposing, but wiry.
“Real photo of different trout.” 😂
My son & I always try to guess what the ending will be around the middle of each story.  I thought it was the 2 guys that killed ricky & my son thought that someone else killed all 3 of them. Boy were we thrown off with this story. VERY WELL TOLD SIR!
Hey bro I was wondering if bedtime studios is yours because they post your videos but without you doing all the crazy sign language (lol) but all jokes aside I support you not video poachers. give us a heads up if this is so mate please. keep up the work mate your videos help me a lot with my ptsd
That’s funny. I hate my neighbors😅
Wow, that was a plot twist!😳
Love ya Ballin but I thru hiked the entire trail in 2017 and there is no such explicit code. People will bend over backwards to help each other but the only code I know is “leave no trace” and “hike your own hike”
Really unique way to tell this one. Well done.
Bruh the intro 😂
I like your voice more Mr ballen
Wow! A new one! Yay.
Dang! This one was a doosy. I love this guy! Been watching him for years! Probably won't stop any time soon >:]
What happened to the dog though!
Why anyone who has nefariously deprived another human the ability to breathe is ever released back in Society is beyond me.
❤ 0:04
I wish I didn’t have to search different channels, pay for subscriptions, and wonder if I’ve heard a story or not before, before I get stories like this. I can’t keep up with the new channels I wish everything was just here
I’m not a legal expert or criminal psychologist or anything like that, but I kinda feel like maybe we should stop releasing convicted murderers back into society.
Am I the only one who wants to know what happened to “Ricky’s” dog? (Which for some reason I imagine as a German Shepard
ricky was fishing but didn't have his own knife?
There's so much mrballen content stealers lets keep this man going
Is run fool true stories?
Lately i noticed that a lot of creators are covering stories shortly after Mike from That Chapter covers them. Regardless good story telling and super terrifying
Opening scene shows the forest upside down.
Great story, one HELL of an unexpected twist!!!
Reason 1,000,456 I won’t camp
I never thought it would or even could happen, but "Appalaychin" makes me want to punch Mr. Ballen in the wang dang doodle. I know it'll pass though.
Every time you talk about the Run Fool podcast I can picture and hear Kelly Jo Minter in my head "RUN FOOL!!" lol ❤
You look like guy that can put a 12 pack of beer down like a pro
What happened to Randall dog?
Rte.64 goes over dismal creek,drove over hundreds of times,creepy. Commenting before watching.
i cant find this run fool podcast please any link?
For some reason, "REAL PHOTO OF DIFFERENT TROUT" struck me as rather humorous.
Why are we paroling people who commit double homicide?
I like all of his silly disclaimers  such as "Not a real photo of Ricky's fishing line".
Top notch, Mr. Ballen, top notch!! Another ripping good yarn!!
Mr. Ballen, I love run fool the guy is a great story teller. Lover scary stories.
That chapter just did this story 2 weeks ago. Two good storytellers
Actually write "Mr. Ballen was here" on your neighbor's lawn.
He must have been stealing from other campers when they went for a walk or a swim
dang, crazy those two survived that.
I often listen to your podcasts at bedtime, but it is a special treat to see as well as hear you tell your stores.
Ole boy has a nice voice but nobody beats the og ❤❤
RUN FOOL SUC BALLS 🏀🏀
Why does the intro "i hate my neighbors" sounds personal.
Omg what happened to the dog!?!?
For a starving man Ricky is super picky
What happened to the dog?
Yet another example of no good deed goes unpunished. You won't catch me helping anyone for shit. Not worth it.
If you post corordinates to example the rake phenomenon I will go and get one ! I mean why not prove some of these myths ! Let me man !
I had to Google dismal creek. I live near a place called dismal hollow and the top of my mountain intersects the AT. Luckily dismal creek is far away lol. The whole time I was thinking "Ricky" was going to be the victim until I realized he said a truck was at the womens' house. I remembered he said they played country music from the truck. Also when he said the cops found a cassette tape with weird meditations satanic ritual sounds I remembered he said Ricky had talked about meditations. I'm glad the two men survived. I can't imagine ever going back to the dismal creek campsite but good for them for not letting it ruin it.
God bless, it's liberating hear a story where the killer dies and the victims survive
I don't want to drag the sentiment of this page down here, but every time I've tried to listen to RUN, FOOL! I've had trouble understanding what is being said. I know I'm a 1/4 deaf but I don't have to have subtitles on thru your stories, John. You diction is so clear but maybe it's also because I can see the expressions on your face and can see your lips move (not that I'm a lip reader by any means). Even with the short clip you played at the end, I was still having trouble. I think it's the lack of some articulation but it's also the underscoring of the music. It seemed to play a certain beat here and there louder- just enough to knock out that part of a word, making the sentence seem out of context. I know I'm hearing more and more Americans drop some consonants in their words Eg the word 'edited' might be pronounced 'edided' with the last letter trailing off and a soft 't' for the middle consonant. I'd really love to be able to listen to more.  Does anyone know how to turn on subtitles on podcasts? Is there such a thing?
As someone who hikes a lot, this is something I'm always wary of. I carry a 7" blade with me on most hikes, both because a lot of people feed the bears so they're somewhat likely to approach people, and because the Appalachians are a great place to hide if you're doing sketchy shit. I've only ever hiked the TN and NC part of the range, but I've definitely seen some shit out there. Be aware of your surroundings and the behaviors of other people near you no matter where you are, but especially when you're someplace isolated. It could save your life.
Mr ballen be balling
So never trust anyone!
You Told Their Story Better Than The Episode Did; You're Tellings Of Stories Are Very Entertaining!
Im so tired of hearing these evil guys being paroled for “good behavior” after being convicted of murder. No!!! Once they have murdered once, it’s only a matter of time before they do it again!  I knew Ricky was the crazy one the moment the his fish story didn’t make sense. Can’t catch a fish for days, yet the victim appears and all of the sudden the fish start to bite. 🤔 He was lying.
Damn, glad they made it through it all.  As far as the Devil wanna be. Well, I will just say I hope he got what was coming to him at the end.
There is no way I would go out in the wilderness without my firearm.
I found Mr Ballen about 2 weeks ago and am hooked. I told my friends and now their hooked too lol. Thanks for the awesome stories Mr Ballen!!!
Hoping Sean and Scott got strapped now 💯
For some reason, the "RUN, FOOL!" narrator sounds like Mike Tyson with less of a lisp. That's not hate, just an observation; I'm sure the guy is a good narrator.
MrBallen is such a great story teller. I've heard this story before but since he started the story in Ricky's perspective I had no idea it was a story I've already heard. I love this channel ❤️
Lying Randall.
Interesting.  You don't debone trout. You cook em and pull the meat down and off the bone.
how in the world did he get let out
Fam is currently eating Taco Bell, at the table, lights off, listening to Mr. Ballen. Let’s. GO!
Sorry that's just my people
Good Lord...crazy beyond word.  Glad those two gents survived.
I love how you told this story making it seem that the “main character” is about to be victimized, however turns out he’s the bad guy. Well played
I just started watching your channel. Why are you always so mean to the like button? Where did the beef originate?
Why would the law grant a parole of just 15 years of murdering 2 men in the first place .....to let him murder more men  and maybe that's why people everywhere always takes the laws in their own hands 😕
The I'd photo in the thumbnail looks like young tony soprano from the saints of Newark
Go Hokies ❤
I swear u did this story already 🤔
Yoga is demonic.
I LOVE your videos and have been a fan since you first started years ago. I can listen to you all day, your a gifted storyteller ❤
All the people who were responsible for letting that man out of prison AFTER him murdering 2 people should have been charged.
Took you like 10 minutes to just say the person was shot. Thumbs down
May 6th is my birthday 😬😬😬😬
I love that Mr. Ballen basically takes a real story and makes a bunch of stuff up to throw off the listener. It can be annoying until you realize it's his own story based loosely on a real story.
I’ve watched enough Mr. Ballen episodes to know that the main character was going to end up being the antagonist 🤓
I've always wondered why Mr Ballen bows his head when he says certain things.  But I guess that he's bowing, as a movement of respect, like, welcome.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG???? 😭😭😭
Evil is just evil they or it or what ever it ,they them what ever evil goes by does not need an excuse evil is evil and all of us God fearing people need to be aware at all times amen brothers and sisters
I'm left fearing that there was a little lost starving dog left there all alone to fend for himself.
Another great story ✌
More importantly, what happened to the dog?
I'm pretty sure I've seen every one of your videos over the past few years. But I'm still not sure what the hell the "Like Button" ever did to you, to deserve such terrible retribution. 🤔
I love run fool almost as much as I love your story telling ❤ I love listening to your story’s on YouTube and your podcast ❣️ that’s for all the work you do to keep us with new story’s 🥰
Banjos I’m the woods? Dang the band really picked a banger spot for the concert.
I haven’t even finished the video. But im pretty sure the plot twist is Ricky was the one who was up to no good.
This was a goodun man
That's so sad glad the two friends survived but have to live in pain from the shots.
Sooo.. don't trust a man with his dog on a trail?.. 😅
I really thought that the "s+inby frail guy" was a victim. The fact that he was a killer was a surprise. This was (uje good fracture, but sadly, it was true. 😮
SPOILER!!!!!!       it really healed my heart when i learned they both survived i like happy endings sometimes
Wow, suspenseful story! Thanks for doing this show. I look forward to it, every weekend!
I was so happy to hear that both men survived!
Man that guy got off too easy.. dudes are badasses
There was no reference to the Banjos as on the thumbnail...I was thinking Deliverance - Squeal like pig boh!
plot twist af! i thought they were gonna hurt ricky!  PLOT TWIST AGAIN
Sean looks like big ole bear!
You never let me down you are the best!
I'm waiting for the episode that Mr. Ballen finally decides he's had enough of the like button and tells us to cut off the like buttons thumb, essentially turning him into a fist, making it impossible for the like button to do his job. 😆
They still go back to camp?!?!?! What????!!!
I can attest that Run Fool is expertly narrated, well written, and legitimately interesting content. Don't sleep on it.
Scary forrest / camping stories are the best of Mr Ballen videos. I'm always excited for the next one!
I live a county over and have went to Dismal Falls to fish.  It's a trout stock location.  I've never heard of this story.  Absolutely wild that someone would do something that evil in our little area.  Southwest VA is generally a quiet place to live for the most part.  Thanks for sharing this story.
Note to self:  Don’t accidentally read the top comment posted before viewing the story, otherwise you’ll get a spoiler like this one, “I’m so glad Sean and Scott survived!”  SMH 😌
Good god, Mr. Ballen is such an amazing storyteller. The twists and misdirections in this one 😆.  On another note, I'm really glad that Scott and Sean survived and that they continue to enjoy nature in Dismal Creek 🙂.
Ricky Williams from backyard football 06 was HIM
Brother asked me to commit arson on my neighbors lawn
Run Fool is really good. He tells some seriously spooky tales.
Well i didnt expect that ending 😮😮
heard this from a diff youtuber think That Chapter can not recall
Hey control.alt.esc 👀
What happened to the dog though?
I listen to these stories before bedtime with my kids, they love it, it teaches them the old "Stranger danger", to beware, be careful, take pleasure on your 2nd amm3ndment rights to protect yourself, and ALWAYS ALWAYS be ready to dial 911, and know exactly where you are to describe it to dispatchers, these videos are extremely educational, thanks Mr Ballen!
This is why I will never hike the Appalachian Trail. Actually it's because of the (2002) movie Wrong Turn, and a bunch of other scary hillbilly movies, and the fact that I already hate hiking, but also this
What a twist.
11:39 LOVE RUN FOOL! I try not to listen if my hubby is not in bed right next to me lol sounds and voice are very engaging and scary!  💙💙 👻
highly favored 🤍⚪️
well done for the wording! i had no idea until it was too late 🙏🏽 what a twist!
I love this channel
what happened to the dog ):
I got sucked in by the dog when reading the teaser yesterday 😅
Run Fool Podcast is definitely one of my favorites out there
Dont read the comments until after the video. Some ppl are unaware of mysterious story manners lol
I learned from the Appalachians if you hear banjos thats when you know the doors better get locked
Anyone else love watching these videos late at night by yourself in the dark???
The plot twist is craaazy 🤯
Haven’t watched the whole video or even heard anything about this story and already can tell Ricky seems very sketchy the way Mr ballen is describing him lol
Hi Mr.Ballen! Just wanted to say I recently found your channel and can't stop watching your content! You're awesome!! 👍
@MrBallen I have a story from India, Google "Manjumeel Boys".
Coo Coo Coo Coo
Ok I'm from SW Virginia and I am sooooo stoked for this story because my family and I have been to Dismal Falls so many times!! Edit: My middle child was born at that very same hospital. I love that one of your stories is based in my area 😊
What happened to the dog?!🐕
MrBallen, I apologize, but for future stories can you please pronounce Appalachian like “app uh latch in”. That’s the correct pronunciation. Before anyone says otherwise, look at the etymology. I’m also from the Appalachian mountains. Regardless, you’re incredible and I hope I don’t offend!
Loved it!! Great as always, Mr. Ballen. One thing, though… what ever happened to Ricky’s, I mean, Randall’s hungry dog?!?!
Oh man....my neighbor is so mad at me now. They called the coppers on me. Thanks alot Mr B
This entire group is weird, totally like most all of these hikers especially the ones who camp/hiker alone and never carry personnel locator, especially now because they are affordable?  Now I am able to give another supporting fact to show/prove how Americans judicial branch/system is by far nothing but the most corrupt worthless government criminals who are solely responsible for 70% of all the crimes, Injustice that we have in America. So many times these worthless corrupt judges and the district attorneys let murderers out or send them to a few years in jail for intentionally murdering people. And every time the people in the community are not notified this murderer is out about and living among them. What ends up happening is they murder someone else or for someone who commits sexual assault they rape again. And I feel that these judges should be sensed for the murder or their next victim. But we'll see these judges and the system throw people in jail as we're watching them do to this hoax they created about January 6th leaving people in jail or prison now for 2 years and it's all based of a misdemeanor. We also see them throwing people in jail for years or longer sense than murderers because of some so-called child support which is totally abuse of their power. I've never seeing a system that sole purpose is to protect and Serve the People and catch and pious the real criminals. We also see the people in this judicial system that's all of them the judges, district attorneys and police officers are always involved in other crimes or where they rated a person's home killed the person or people and it was not the right home or person. And what did they get they get a leave of absence with pay, the sheriff usually talks about how great the officer is and this says nothing about the innocent person they murdered. And when the officers are reinstated they usually get a raise and promotional. Are you going to hear someone calling in 911 obviously in a terrible situation and a 911 operator talks to to the person like they're dirt, they don't take their plea for help seriously, they'll jump on to them tell them to calm down, they won't pass all information what's going on, in case they'll tell the if they don't calm down and answer the stupid questions they ask they're going to hang up on them. And these worthless people on 911 meaning the call the result is the person calling you for help is either and or kidnapped. The result is no one in the police department is held responsible for failing to help the person who called 911, you'll have the sheriff end up taking up for this person and they in essence try to blame the victim. These things are not isolated incidents that happened often all the time and without any one facing consequences. I don't why the people in America do not come together and demand our whole system be overhauled judges should never be allowed that much power and have no oversight and be able to hold that bench for their life. And we have people who still think this judicial system and police officers are so great. All those days just for 5% who are bad that's even worse because it's 95% are supposed to be good according to them and why are they not going after this 5% who are bad criminals. The reason is the 95% are bad also and they're just coming to the aid of the Criminal officers or judges. Again everyone these people should be held accountable and whatever the punishment for the crime is on the books they should have to face the harshest punishments times 10 because they know the law and they're abusing it and no one is holding them accountable
8.6 mil 👌
How about we not allow murderers to be paroled for "good behavior "
So was it Trout that they ate or the damn dog where is the poor dog???
scott is cute...hehe.
what happened to the dog?
Just thru-hiked the AT last year, and it’s crazy to think this stuff happened at Dismal Creek. Idyllic campsite otherwise!
I wonder if the dog ever thought that there was something wrong with his 'master'.
I love the way you tell the story.. you keep up the suspense!!!
Ricky wad a young boy He had a heart of stone. Lived 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone
You can get off the trail long before you starve to death.. if you starve on that trail, you don't have any business being there.. eat your dog
I identify as: [  ] male [  ] female [x] a fan of the strange, dark, and mysterious delivered in story format
Why do i think that bro was eating them for dinner and that’s why no one was found
I eat LongPig bcuz we are so delicious
0:36 But Officer, Mr. Ballen said I could burn their house down!
Run Fool is fiction and Mr. Ballen doesn't narrate. I don't mind the guys voice but I wasn't plussed either. Just saying. I love Medical Mysteries but there hasn't been an actual new episode in weeks. All episodes picked from YouTube. Be nice to hear one I hadn't heard before. I know...I'm bitching. Sorry. Really do love what you do. Thanks for everything
so basically judged need to be held accountable and this horror story would have been avoided.
OH MY GOD I REMEMBER THIS! I live not far from there, i live in the Blue Ridge/Appalachian mountains. The trail life is one i know well. We all look out for eachother so when this happened, everyone was shocked.   Whats crazier is I have many pictures and videos of me and my friends at the EXACT SPOT of the picture he used at 10:44 in the story. I have sooooo many of us swimming and just hiking. If u were to look straight down, theres these HUGE flat rocks you can sit on or sunbathe on, like 10 people could lay side by side on this rock. If you turn left, theres woods and an embankment. If you look right, theres a big camping spot where you can make a fire and chill, theres a big rock that juts out so if it rains, you have pleanty of cover. Its beautiful out there. Its on Bland County VA if anyone wants to go!
I just knew it was Ricky(aka Randall) who was the killer! I’m starting to get the gist of MrBallen’s plot twists. If it isn’t the spouse, then it’s probably the least suspected person like the ‘good son.’
Mysterior ?.?.?. 🌑
i don't think someone who commits a double murder out of sheer cold blood should ever be eligible for parole.
Always a good day when a video drops. Thank you, you don't realize how you've helped people like me that need an escape. ❤
I'm trying to think of how that experience would be - running into strangers on the Appalachian Trail... I've spent my entire life in Arkansas where we have a lot of hiking trails, creeks and camping sites and such - probably nothing compared to the Appalachian Trail - but a lot of beautiful, pristine, primitive and highly popular places - and there was dozens of times, if not more, that I would be swimming, fishing, kayaking or hiking alone and/or camping alone or with a small group and a random person/people/group would just walk up and hang out - sometimes it would be very..."rough" looking folks just stumbling out of the dark and they'd just sit and get drunk and laugh and tell stories with us.   Sometimes maybe I would know them (since we always camped close to where _I_ grew up and most of my friends were from farther away) and sometimes I wouldn't. Sometimes, they'd be a long haired mountain man, moonshiner or meth cook and other times they'd be a tweaked out meth zombie - sometimes all of the above.   The point I'm trying to make is, I was never just _horrified_ or anything when someone would walk up on me/us - and these sites were actually fairly popular for the area - again, probably a miniscule number of visitors compared to the AT but - specifically with our favorite creek - Snow Creek - a dirt road running beside a pretty big creek - some might even say "a river" in some areas - with primitive, non-official campsites lining the dirt road periodically maintained by just us people and kept trampled down by our traffic - I remember very often, we'd go to camp, swim, fish, canoe/kayak, etc., and all probably dozen campsites would be packed with RVs ( _nobody_ from my area owned an RV) and the few times we'd just squeeze on in for creek access, they'd all be from either far out of town or even out of state.   I remember we would always shoot guns up there - and we packed some wild heat - it probably sounded like a warzone. There was this one time where a big RV was in "our spot" and they seemed cool so we squeezed by and went down to the creek and, we were stupid-ass kids, weren't considerate _at all_ , we didn't think about it, figured the RV people were probably cool, thought we were far enough away, etc. and we started blasting our guns at the creek (like I think I had my Mosin Nagant (probably the loudest of our guns), my friend probably had his AK and 12 gauge, and maybe somebody had a pistol or whatever and maybe some .22's) - like typical firepower for this area but likely terrifying insanity and overkill for anyone from out of town (turned out they were from the state but were "city slickers" lol).   So they almost immediately called the cops on us and several state troopers rolled up on us. We both told our stories and the state troopers told the RV people we had every right to shoot guns where we were shooting - it was based on the distance from the road and the distance from the RV or something - and my wise-ass, overly aggressive, in-your-face type of friend made absolutely certain to shake the state troopers' hands right in front of the RV people, converse with them and thank them before they left and we continued shooting - as the RV left to go to another spot...   I feel like we were sort of in the wrong just like ethically/morally even if it wasn't illegal - it was just a younger dude (15ish years older than us - we were late-teens/early 20's), his wife and a kid or two... So I think we were the "scary, dangerous people" that day... My friend was always kind of the "leader" or whatever just because he was so aggressive (always wanted to start crap with people or scare them or whatever - we thought it was hilarious at the time) and he's the one who insisted we stop in that exact spot and start shooting even though the RV was there - he ended up being an MP in the military and then a police officer.   I remember this redneck dude asked to shoot his AK one time and he just looked at him and was like "Noop". Lol.. The redneck got so mad he had his fists clenched and was rocking back and forth, red-faced and was even kind of crying from rage - like about to jump my friend - even though there was 3 of us with guns - and my friend was just taunting him - like, "Why are you crying you bitch?"... So we were 100% the assholes a lot of times back in those days.
I just love Mr Ballen. I love how he twists the plots. Keep up the good work!!
How did Randall only serve 15 years for double murder??? 😳
I'm 6 minutes in and I already know Ricky is the bad guy. I saw this on I Survived, I recognized the names of the victims. Interesting perspective telling the story from the perps perspective. These guys barely made it.
That little move you do in the intro... it has finally come to me.... the masterpiece.... we shall call it... "The Ballen Bow" TM
Good story man, nice to hear one where there's survivors
Need to go back to the stories like the nasa guy haunted by demon type stories
"Sunday, Ballen Sunday!" 🎶
DayZ teaches you to trust absolutely no one 😂
Wowwww .. didn't view the ending that way
Camping is like going out of town too always have someone with you that love you and have your back
I've now heard this story about 3 times but this is the first time I've heard it from the murderer's point of view.  After finding out that the two guys survived, I wondered about that poor dog. 🐶
Thanks to Mr. Ballen, I'm even more confident that I'll never go camping or hiking in places that aren't filled with people. At the same time... There have been enough scary incidents that have happened on hikes and camping trips... I fail to understand why would anyone want to do it alone especially if they're vulnerable like being old and frail
Mr Ballen is the GOAT
For anyone who was curious like me, i did a little digging on reddit and someons write up says Bo the dog survived and was adopted out to a new family. 😅
That turned out differently than I thought
I really have to stop looking at the comment section before I've heard the whole story !
I saw Randall covered on That Chapter just a couple weeks ago.  Such a scary guy!
Scott is my neighbor.  This event took its toll on Scottie. That's all I will say. He's outside RIGHT NOW sawing wood to sell.  Thanks for covering Scottie and Sean's story.  Also its Apple atcha.
You are amazing story teller I am so glad they are ok
Interesting that Sean had such an immediate gut reaction to Ricky's sudden appearance there.
As MrBallen got to the part about police and ambulance arriving, I heard really realistic sirens and thought "dang, these are especially good sound effects". As I usually do when I have that thought, I paused the video and realized there were actual sirens happening in my town somewhere. 😂 The timing, though!
I don't like his voice
I have to say,I think ( because i enjoy ALL your stories ) the 411 stories are my favorite stories from Mr. Ballen
Awesome story man!
The like button joke was a flop, but the "not a real photo of Ricky's fishing line" was a success lol.
Just to let you know, Appalachia is pronounced “Apple-atcha” 😊😊
Mr Ballen, as a huge fan across the 'pond' in England, thanks for your continued content. I recently got into the podcasts too, such great stuff! And given your background and military work, you're a super respectable bloke and I always love to see you in my notifications. You take 100 news articles/hour long documentaries into a really engaging, visual and shocking story that often hits home. Stay safe and take care my friend!
Are used to like you. Now you’ve just turned really annoying. You draw it out and draw it out and draw it out
aww dude you gotta say Appalachian correctly next time.. it hurts..
This is why I ALWAYS carry while camping or hiking..and now I have 22 rounds of 10mm.
How many of you guys remember...."Do you know how to get to Bells Canyon?"
Can someone tell me about his shirt? Like brand? I really like that shirt lol
i lit my neighbours yard on fire and now i'm in jail what's the next step?
Good video!😊
Really sounds like a scavenger that killed to survive in the wild.
I really love seeing a notification for MrBallen on a Sunday . It makes my day !!😂❤
16:41 in, I'm going to make an educated guess without looking at any comments or skipping to the end, and state that Ricky is the murderer. I'll find out if I'm correct or mistaken later on.
Great story! Thank you, Mr. Ballen. RUN FOOL! is awesome! If you like Mr. Ballen, you will like RUN FOOL!
What about the dog?  Glad they escaped, though!
Have you thought about collaborating with Let’s Read? 👀
very long story TLDR at the bottom. My grandpa told the story similar to this. Back when he got back from the Korean war, He needed some time to decompress and shake the war blues as he called them. Fonda place you could stay extend stay kind of campsite deep in the woods. He talked to the rangers was on good terms They would see him go out every now and then to town get vittles and other staples. What evening A guy just came into his campground. After like 10 minutes you finally just said he needed food so my grandpa made him some food. My grandpa said you knew the guy wasn't right That same feeling he got out on patrol and they'd come across the enemy same feeling vibe he got from this guy. Eventually after treating the guy was just relaxing He showed my grandpa small little firearm some measly six shooter probably 22 or something. But this guy said he's killed with it many stop talking. Gramps asked the guy if you wanted and after dinner drink just some like boosie head on a guy accepted so he bring some over a cup goes back to get his but instead grab the knife went behind the guy and just slit his throat. Grandpa hung out for half hour Then decided to drag his body off few miles from him deep in the woods where some animal would do them in no more park ranges rarely go or any human for that matter He only found it for being out there so long. Around the time he need to go back out and get some supplies He subtly brought up if there were any other guest and he was only one up there and probably would be for the rest of his stay as nobody camped at that time of year in that part of the park. Didn't see any missing person flyers or any talk of anything at the town. Grandpa spent, I think like two or three more weeks there and left. Never heard anything about somebody missing but he did find out years later that there had been some type of serial rapist and killer killed two people but had raped five women in the area They were all within a year and a half span and then they stop never happened again and Grandpa's convinced that was the man. He had a friend that was a cop and told him he was interested in the case and that there was a strange guy when he was camping out He gave some food to one night and the guy just wandered off and never heard from again and none of the park rangers seem to remember him Grandpa didn't feel it necessary to report him that was the story he was going with is friend was able to dig up an old sketch and it looked a lot like the guy that night. My grandpa on a hunch seem to have killed a very sick twisted killer and rapist. This is many years ago maybe Grandpa made a mistake and got the wrong person but it sounds like with the work he did he himself was convinced He had stopped a very wicked man from harming anyone else. They said this is just a story my grandpa told who's now since passed. Can't see if it's true or not but the story reminded me of it.  TLDR. Back in the late '50s early '60s my grandpa was camping out for a few months in a park. 18 a person wandered in looking for food so my grandpa fed them but said he just had a wicked vibe very bad man in when he had showed him a gun and bragged about killing people Grandpa slid his throat and just post his body deeper in the woods where nobody really went or knew about. Nobody ever look for the man in years later my grandpa found out there was a serial rapist and killer in that area that just suddenly stopped had a friend who was a cop and was able to see a sketch from one of the victims and it looked a lot like the man my grandpa killed.
How did those guys get their pickup truck and drive it down the Appalachian Trail? Now like all Wildlife areas you have Park Rangers and the Wildlife officers but they are just like any police officer or someone in our government's judicial branch never around when you need them they're usually out harassing law abiding citizens and out abusing their power just like police officers. Nothing but corruption when it comes to America's entire judicial branch and system
What happened with the dog?
Why do I feel like ur told this one before?
I FREAKING LOVE RUN FOOL!!!! It’s amazingly creepy ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bullshit
Big love to Sean and Scott. So pleased they recovered. Excellent vid Mr Ballen thank you ❤
I love Mr Ballen because he really leaves you guessing the whole entire time lol I had no idea where this was going.. at all. It’s so crazy that it was the SAME MAN leaving terror in his wake just like he did so many years ago. But I’m so relieved that the good people survived this time.
As a pro banjo player tat
I don’t know how you do it  but you make the story actually come to life. When I listen I start to see the forest camp site it’s just wonderful. Bless you and yours
I like that you have other people working for Ballen studios but I think (at least for myself) the majority of us here prefer true or allegedly true stories like you tell That's why we're here. Also why I haven't been able to sit through a whole run fool episode personally. True horror is always better and always has important life lessons in it if you listen to it for more than just morbid entertainment. I don't care for most fictional horror outside of the legendary storytellers like Stephen King. But that's just me and I only speak for myself. I was already subbed to bedtime stories for a couple years too. Great content.
Murder two people and get 15 years in prison. Gotta love the US justice system
Another great episode.   Love listening on long road trips.
Love your channel Mrballen all the way from London UK 😊
I know you are trying to build a good story but some of it is conjecture.  You don't know how Ricky felt, nor the others. I know I'm being picky but I watch your Sunday shows faithfully.  Overall a good job.
I heard this story many years ago
What happened to the dog?!!!!
I've listened to every Run Fool so far, and I love it!!
Wow, it's been a long time since there was a story this good, nice twist toward the end that I didn't expect. Great stuff MrB!
I’ve come to a scientific conclusion that the Like Button stole Mr. Ballens first and ultimate love of his life and couldn’t win her back. Now they’re beefing for eternity. 😂😂
I dont like this recent trend of intentional misleading while telling the story. Like the whole thing about 'ricky' feeling uneasy when he was alone fishing cause he knew he was alone blah blah blah. It's straight up cheating just for the sake of plot twist  Smh
I’m so happy Sean and Scott made it. I always wonder, what’s it like to interact with a serial killer when you don’t know they’re a serial killer, but you know there’s a serial killer in the area 😳  I’m still thankful for Sean and Scott’s recovery ❤️‍🩹🙏🏾
Excellent story as always MR B 👍👍
What happened to the dog 😢
Please do a video on the Virginia Colonial Parkway serial killer
what happened to the dog?
The way you deliver the story is art.
Cool thanks will watch
Another excellent episode thank you
Murder two people and only get 15 years??
Missing MrBalllen’s stories with footage, videos or pictures with it, hope we will have those soon!
anyone would kill someone if they played country music lol
What happened to Randall's dog?
What a freaking twist. Apparently Sean's initial attitude towards Ricki was very appropriate and rightfully so. I about garuntee he murdered others that no one knows about. So glad they still go back and it didn't break their spirit for the outdoors.
That’s why I don’t help anyone anywhere 😊 best story teller in the world
I love your content Ballen it’s so good keep up the amazing work!
Friggin hippies
I’m guessing he stole them from camp sites and it escalated.
I love creepy camp stories!
The whole time I was actually worrying about the dog than the humans in this story. I guess I already expected what will happen since I have been watching too much murder stories but I am honestly grateful to know the two men Sean and Scott survived the attack.
So you're telling me that when Randall heard a male voice approaching, he got nervous, because there's a killer in these woods... when he's the killer  Ballen strikes again 😅
This is why I don't go camping or hiking without at least 4 backpacks and a mini dinosaur to carry them. One with camping supplies, one with "vampire/supernatural" killing supplies, one with 100 mini-rocket launchers, and one filled with supplies to defend against "magic/dark arts". Better to have it and not need it, lol.
This was a true story!! This was on a show on Discovery Channel!! Twisted guy!!! Omg!! Awesome job telling this twisted story!! You really have an amazing story telling ability 😻😻😻
What happened to the dog?? I have to know 😭
i really appreciate the small details of whether or not a photo is real or just for imagery
Omg I was definitely shocked 😲
Sad that you can't enjoy the scenic beauty of the mountains anymore without security guards
Can’t believe Ricky got paroled for killing two people should have at least been life in prison
All of mrballens stories are fantastic. Most have disastrous endings. It’s uplifting to hear happy endings from time to time👍
Still wondering what happen to his dog 🤔 Also love how you tell these stories!! This one was shocking wow, I’m glade Sean and Scott survived
Look at how high up Mr Ballen went just to tell us this story. What a guy!
Soo we still let convicted murderers out of prison,   Uhhhhh.  Ok then.
at least this one tis not supernatural..... i skip all those ones.... the non supernatural ones i love.... have u ever thought of having a supernatural category? i know i get annoyed when i start to watch one then realise its supernatural.... love real stories not fairy tales. have u ever thought of doing a collab? ur camping stories would go so well with Kyle Hates Hiking xxx <3
wow
Don’t spoil the ending!
I'm SO glad Sean and Scott survived!! I think that experience would cure me from camping for good.
As soon as you said Ricky and Dismal Creek...as a VA resident- knew exactly the story. Thank you for telling it in such an entertaining way!
I obviously miss all the stories told in this way but I do think if u at least add AI photos to the podcast me and a lot of others will tune in. Garenteed for sure
Ricky clearly using a pea shooter.
Randal Lee Smith looked a lot like James Gandolfini’s kid
WOW. What a crazy story. Great to hear that both Sean and Scott are doing well, and that they didn't let one lone psycho ruin their enjoyment of the great outdoors.
Please more missing/mysterious stuff on you podcast ! ❤❤❤
Scott put Sean in danger.. having a nice welcoming friend can unintentionally put u in danger
24:55 No one cares about your podcast. But thanks for the disjointed impossible to follow boring story.  Asshat.
have not been camping in 20 years, i heard something in the woods that shook me so hard, i could never go back , compared to what these guys went through, my experience was nothing.. it's shocking to me they would keep going out. pretty courageous.
Lets not go to Dismal Creek.
But ummm… what happened to the dog?
I jst went and took ur advice with the gasoline on the ground in front of neighbours house...🔥👨‍🚒🚒  it didnt go well... and wasnt funny 😐
10 minutes in and I'm predicting Ricky is the bad boy lol Post video Edit:  *SPOILERS*. DO NOT CLICK "MORE" IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED.     Boooyah baby!  Mr Ballen, I'm starting to figure you out good sir! As soon as you said the big man at the campsite was unhappy about "Ricky" being there and that "Ricky" was saying stuff that made them thiink like he was crazy (CHANTING, "praying", "meditating) I was like yah dude must be weird for both guys to be creeped out by him.   Great story!
I'm only five hours late to the video I didn't have signal and I was partying with my friends and I made some strange dark and mysterious music with them
That certainly wasn't what I had expected  Wow   Wonder what happened to the dog 🐕??  Hopefully the pup was ok
As a small guy myself... I like to travel with the world one day and go out and hike and camp everywhere but I always told myself I am going to always be protected.. now if was hiking and there were two campsites One with two really big dudes and another one with a small guy like myself.... I would be more worried with a small guy rather than going with a too big dudes so I will approach them first if I was needed to help... Because I know this guy chances are he exactly feels the way I do... The small guys were not going to win a fight and to hand with a bigger guy that has more pounds and more height and more advantage.. not say it's impossible but chances doesn't favor our odds.. so we're not going to go and look for a fight but we are going to different ourselves at the highest level especially when going to places like in the woods.. but do you know who I blame for this innocent to happen is not on Randall himself even though he shares a good amount of blame it's the system how in the hell can this guy get 15 years and then get past parole after killing two people knowing full well he has a history of mental illness...He should have gone either to a mental asylum and stay there for rest of his life or she should have gotten the death penalty...
Prime example my late pawpaw a WW2 VFW& My late dad was a Army Vietnam VFW&we always camped&hunted&fished when I was growing up in the late 70's&80's&they taught me firearm safety&how to use  every type& That  its always better to have a firearm & not need it than need one&Not have-oùr most importañt Freedom our Second Amendment&Gun's don't murder/kill people-bad-evil-criminal people murder others not firearms,baseball bats,knives,swords,cars&trucks.
Im left wondering what happened to dog.
R🇵🇬🇵🇬,,
I'm 8 minutes in but if these two guys that invited Rick back to their site, aren't the inspiration for Tucker and Dale, I'm gonna be shocked
Can confirm that Rodney Barnes is a brilliant and engaging storyteller!
Your the best stotyteller. You make/made my day.
Wheres dog?????
At the 11:45 mark how bad did MeBallen want today “go run FOOL” but didn’t…
16:30 Im hoping you mention the dog again.
Those two guys must now consider Dismal Creek the safest place in the world to camp. What are the odds of something like that happening twice?!
Can you stop recycling dateline stories. Geez
Plot twist!!!!!!
Don't ever judge a book by its cover.
Hey I love these stories buddy thanks
The fact you have been doing this for 3 years and have nearly 10million subs ❤❤❤❤well deserved
Damn. Those two men are tough af.
You've told this exact story but reworded earlier this year.
Always enjoy your stories.  Thank you!!!
I heard of this story before, the survivors were on an episode of “ I Survived “…. too crazy
I started of watching it, wondering if it would be yet another "i saw this, i heard that" type of abstract story. Thankfully it was not. I really don't understand why people need to put themselves up as victims for such deranged individuals. Also, the gun laws are too lax. How can such a person be allowed to keep firearms. Ofcourse he could have attacked them with a knife, but at least they would have some chance to defend themselves against that. Plus the attacker might not carry out his plan if it was not so easy.
13:37 Close the door get your gun
"they live in a VERY SECLUDED part of the country"  Ambulance is there within 2/3 mins.
Pretty sure he's told this story before... 🤔
So what happened to the dog? I love animals, not crazy men.
The guy looked at Ricky and Ricky said “While we’re young mutha f*ka!” 😂😂
Not me wondering where his dog went 😭
I haven’t gotten through a full story in about a month.. I pass out about 10 min in then wake up for the last minute every time.. I spoil the stories on myself lol
10:30 If anything happens to the dog............
'Never just a book by its cover.'
I wonder what happened to the dog
Cleaning and de-boning fish near one's camp is a great way to attract 🐻 bears, especially in springtime when they're hungry and/ or have cubs
The plot twist i never saw coming!!
I thought the guy the murderer met at the creek was going to ask do you know the way to Bells Canyon? 🤣🤣🤣🤣😳
"if thats of interest to yoiiii"
Thanks man you have the best stories, I love to listen all the time. Again thanks 🎉
Particularly funny like button demise! 😂
Ok, So what happened to the dog.
I hear banjos. 🪕 😂
Wow, Sean really is twice the size of Scott!
It's all well and good until you hear banjo playing
I have to say I wasnt too interested in the Run Fool podcast, but none the less, I decided to give it a go.... Love it. Absolutely love it, it is a great podcast, and I eagerly await each episodes arrival now days. Give it a go, you wont regret it!
Wow  tremendous story! I knew about this story, but I'd never heard it from Randall's point of view, so it took awhile before I recognized what was happening. Randall is just another example of our flawed parole system . I mean, why would a double murderer ever be released from prison?
Run Fool is bearable but you definitely can't ignore the superimposed political bias.
Wake tf up mrballen just dropped
We have a Dismal Swamp in New Jersey.
"Today's episode is a very creepy and highly disturbing camping story"  MY PTSD: Do you know how to get to Bells Canyon.?
Me ballen! You need to do a video over the Kelly Wilson missing person case! It happened in the town that I am from and is such a crazy story and I would love to hear you tell the story!
❤❤❤❤❤
another unnecessarily convoluted drawn out story.. thank you mr.B. unsubscribe...
#24:56 What ever happened to the 🐕?  All kinds of weird stories seem to derive from the Appalachian Trail. I don't 🤔 we'll ever truly know how many people have gone missing (missing 411) due to whatever happens out there. This story was a whopper!! 😮! Thank you, yet again, #MrBallen, for another Sunday special!! I look forward to next Sunday!
Imagine if Ricky was you.
By 18:00 I could already tell this Ricky guy was no good 😮
I hate creepy camping stories. Except Bells Canyon ofc.
This story sounded so familiar I must of heard it somewhere else but I thought I heard it on this channel but I guess not
Really cool to watch your channel blow up. Love your work. Thanks.
💐💐🙏🏻🙏🏻RIP Robert Tatton Mountford Jr. (4 Feb 1954- 20 May 1981) (aged 27), and Laura Susan Ramsay (27 May 1954- 20 May 1981) (aged 26) you will truly both be missed and my prayers go out to you both and your families. 💐💐🙏🏻🙏🏻 Randall Lee Smith (June 29, 1953 – May 10, 2008) (aged 54) was a convicted murderer from Pearisburg, Virginia. Smith was arrested that day after attempting to escape in Johnston’s truck and subsequently crashing. He died in jail four days later as a result of injuries sustained in the crash
This is why, if your gong camping in a tent. Make sure you have a side arm or 2. Better to have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it!
I can't be alone in this... What about the dog?  Lol
By the way, *please* nobody really actually set your neighbors lawns on fire! 🔥 lol
0:35
When your THAT heavy set I’m not AMAZED your still alive being shot in the chest ……… I’d be surprised IF HE DID  pass away (no disrespect to my heavy brothers and sisters out there , eat a salad)
What happened to the dog
Man, you got me in the first half ballen. I started to feel for, Ricky. What a twist! Shawn and Scott are true men 💪🏼🤙🏼
One day your going to say do whatever to said like button as im doing it. Careful
Mr Ballen is my fav bedtime story teller! 😊❤❤❤
10:15 Once apon a time it use to be"silver ware",but now 2024 its only "cutlery".
10:53 How about you just make some vids for the people who were here when you had nothing… and stop with your greedy-ass advertisements. How about that, Balls?
I honestly cannot believe how and why they let killers like him go. It happens over and over and over
Why did Ricky shoot them?
Every Sunday on my lunch break at work Mr Ballen comes in clutch thank you Sir!!
Only 5 min in but Ricky seems like an idiot lol. No food, camping by murder scene…🙄
But...what happened to the dog?!
This was a pretty easy prediction, at least after the loud bang. Ricky being the culprit is the only reasonable conclusion, with the way the story was being told and the identities being withheld. If it were Scott and Sean, there would be no way to make a plot twist and make it interesting enough for the channel. If it was a random person, there would be no story at all and it wouldn't be on the channel.
On my bucket list: Appalachian trail. ✅. NOT 🚫.
I love the way you tell these stories as I can picture the whole thing in my head just like a movie.  Mr Ballen you really are a very gifted storyteller... thank you for sharing this gift with the world. ❤️
I have no respect for someone who takes his dog on the Appalachian Trail and can’t feed him. You wanna go hungry, get skinnier and skinnier, fine. But your dog trusts you to know what you’re doing.
Mr. Ballen! Great episode! This was the best one recently.
I bet they never played country music that loud again.
Keep up the good work! Love what you’re doing. Awesome content!
Glad they are still alive, but there is no way I’d ever go back there.
Is it worse than the toe pincher? 😬
👋
Don't ever offer your fish to anyone. I repeat, never!
Imagine getting shot in the head and you realized you survived and then get shot again in the chest and you’re still alive. And you end up making a full recovery. hell of a story
We love you Mr. Ballen and congrats on your continued success! Well deserved. Top story teller on YouTube 🎉❤
I’m glad Sean and Scott survived that horrific incident and I hope they’re safe and sound to this day
I was taught that there is another code that you have to leave a shelter better of than when you found it
Was anything ever reported about what happened to Randall's dog?
True story: I was in my moms belly  & they were carrying my 2 year old sister on the Appalachian trail. They passed the shelter where that demon had hacked up that couple. Gutted them. Shelter 13 I think. Was off the trail, they didn’t see. When they left the trailhead police were already there. Questioned them. Would have been 81-82. 30 years later it’s deemed someone like that is rehabilitated. 🙄😡 I am friends with Shawn’s brother.
Hubby's watching NASCAR, so I'm settled in to watch the strange, dark and mysterious!
See this shit rt here makes people not want to help somebody who really needs its boy people fuck it for everyone!!!😡😡😱🤬🤬🤬
Don't find run fool's voice sound good
Wow absolutely incredible great story thanks
ur genuinely such a good storyteller its insane lol
App-Uh-Latch-in
Too much details…..I gotta stop watching
The cops showed up as I was spreading out gasoline like you said...
Love, Run Fool. Highly recommended
SPOILER BELOW!!        Ricky being nervous about potential murderers in the forest, when he himself is one, is the defenition of. "CALL AN AMBULANCE... BUT NOT FOR ME!"
Bless those men's hearts. ❤❤❤
Watch on Investigation Discovery, Dead Silent: The Curse of Dismal Creek. I knew I recognized this story!
Ur good enough to feed Randel but country music has forsaken u
Randel pipsqueek
Do you know how to get to bell's canyon?
“And they still go back to Dysmal Creek every year.” I guess getting shot once and coming close to death just wasn’t enough for those boys.
another perfect reason why you LISTEN TO YOUR INTUITION PEOPLE
Going hiking anywhere near Appalachia without a gun is a WILD move.
John…great story!  So glad both Sean and Scott survived. One thing, though, Southerners will tell you that that is NOT the way to pronounce Appalachia (it’s not AppaLAYcha). If you have a hard time remembering that, just remember a Southerner will throw an “apple atcha” to remind you!  LOL 😂😂😂
on my birthday
Ballen is the best!
I’m glad they survived, but what about the dog🤷‍♀️
No good deed goes unpunished
Damn, I’ve literally heard about this case before, knew how it ended, and Ballen STILL had me on the edge of my seat. My mans can tell the ISH outta a story! 😂😂
I'm shocked! What a twist, my family and I were on the edge of our seats. Great job, mate. Hi from Australia.
Always carry multiple weapons just in case.
@MrBallen please please do a collab with Creature Preacher you could have a regular strange, dark & mysterious animal story off him each week. Its a match made in heaven & viewers would love it!! I suggested it on Creature Preachers live stream & he said he'd love to collab with you. His stories & story telling abilities is second to none like ya own.
If you go into the woods/forrest stay packing, pretty much every horror story I've heard would have been prevented with a simple .44 Mag, you'll always be in control of your own self/situation. I've never gone out empty handed, but I could only imagine how sad and stupid I'd feel being held out in the woods by a murderer who was going to torture me or being tracked down by a hungry bear all because for absolutely no reason I chose to go into the wilderness empty handed.
I know Rodney Barns is good but Mrballen is the master story teller hands down. Thank you for what you do! Love you!
He sounds like a liberal
As an avid listener of Run Fool! I can confirm it’s amazing. Every story told is so well narrated and can keep you hooked on every word. I highly recommend it.
What happened to the dog?! That’s all I need to know
Just WOW
Dead silent investigation discovery. Nice to hear it told in a different way
Now THAT was not only the nicest depiction of Rickey I've heard yet but also the biggest stretch yet by Mr B to conceal a killers intentions and character!! Well played Sir lol. Poor Rickey just wanted to make some friends
This man is awesome
@mrballen I LOVE RUN FOOL!! I’ve REALLY Enjoyed getting to know Rodney’s story telling! I’m so glad you partnered with him for Ballen Studios!  I’ve also enjoyed your Medical Mysteries too! I’ve been listening on Amazon Prime so I’m all caught up & have to either Re-listen or just impatiently wait for Monday (your podcast New story!), Tuesday (Rodney Barnes’ - Run Fool!), &  Thursday (your podcast, old stories), Sunday (YouTube - this show!)!  Thank you for days & weeks & Years of Great watching & listening entertainment!  Thank you for creating the Mr Ballen Foundation! I give monthly because I believe in this & love that you give back 💯 % to survivors & victims of violent crime!  P.s. my friend & I also got to see you in ATX for your FIRST IN PERSON Show!!  Can’t wait for more “Lungy” pins to get back in stock! 🐸
Oh Look! The American justice system yet again being total ass
brilliant
All this trauma dumping
Cast a spell on the like button to stub his toe every day .😂😂😂
Hearing the clip of story from the other guy from Run, fool.. I preferr you Mr. Ballen. Thank you
I don't know why but I guessed Ricky would be the perpetuator. Thank God this story ended on a happy note and thank God Scott and Shawn survived and are doing well. God  bless Mr Ballen too.🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿👍🏿👍🏿
But what happened to the dog? 😫
wow they still go back, good for them, im glad they are ok
But what happened to the dog? 😫
😂i love how mrballen says "normally the Appalachian trail is pretty safe.....😂😂
Ricky sounds like my ex girlfriend (mother of my son). He will step over dollars to pick up dimes. Its not what u give ricky its what u didnt give ricky that matters to ricky
I didn’t get a notification?.? Iv been watching and subscribed sense third week…. WTH
Rickys psychotic insecurities. Rick what u think? They gonna pat u on the back for ur life??
I LOVE YOU
Yeah, I'm not camping there.
Is the dog okay?? 🥺
Man that Shure was a turn of events..that was so crazy
Spoiler Blocker 😁❤️
Such clever storytelling! I bet Randall stole the clothes from campsites as he worked his way up to murder, & then circled it on the map. I can’t believe he only got 15yrs for killing 2 hikers & that Scott & especially Sean survived! What a wild story!
Knives r tools. Ricky sounds like an idiot or a murderer.
So, what happened to the dog?? 😭
I spoiled it for myself because as soon as Mr Ballen said the name of the killer from 1981 in the beginning of the video, I looked him up and read about him.
Who would even want to risk hiking in a beautiful remote place like that when there's wierd maniacs who will murder someone instantly for no reason
Glad Sean and Scott are fine. What a twist in the story. Never saw that coming.👍
Mr Ballen has been mewing🤫🧏
That’s why it’s important to avoid getting really drunk while camping or in unfamiliar surroundings.
Mr. Ballen giving another master class in storytelling. Thank you
Pretty soon it will be like smother the like button with a pillow while laughing maniacally 😂👍
Perfect delivery.
You have the best radio voice for narration. No one is better. Maybe the British nat geo guy……, and still I don’t think so
I am sure that you already told us this story 😮
Darwin…. So they weren’t lost or anything? Just tried to fish, and caught nothing. But stayed until they were starving hoping a hiker would bring them a protein bar?
🪕 🤠 i think ill save mountain hiking for west coast.
Mr. Ballbag should shave off the rapo-stache. It looks like he smeared poop on his upper lip. He doesn't look like he wears deodorant either if that makes sense.
15 years and parole after murdering 2 people…?! The justice system in this country is completely broken. It’s a miracle that the 2 men survived when they could’ve easily been two more murders. I hope these 2 men sued the hell out of the state for releasing this man.
I just heard this story from somewhere else.  It's also assumed that Randall killed his mother, because her remains were found buried in the home where he lived with her.
There was a show on A& E called The Curse of Dismal Creek . It tells this account very   well. Very well done Mr. Ballen .
My fav time of week when Mr ballen comes out with new content! 🫡🫶🏼🇦🇺
New subscriber here and i always needed a storyteller like you but i never knew it.❤
As a Miami dolphins fan since 99’ Ricky Williams is my favorite running back in franchise history! His one-two punch with Ronnie brown in that wild card offense was lethal! So Sad that this happened to him
Mr Ballen has the best voice imo. The run fool dude's voice is just not in the same league
First, I want to say that I am glad that the two best friends survived and still continue to do what they love. Perhaps those items may have been things that once belonged to his mother, that Randall may have kept to remember her by?
Its amazing they both survived!!! HALLELUJAH
The picture of that creek was absolutely beautiful
Yes very creepy and reminds me not to drop my guard. And always carry my gun. With extra magazines. Better to have it than not have it. Don’t forget about your knive.😎👍🤘🇺🇸
You should make your videos live action/acting.
Gas prices in CA are too expensive to do that.
I'm just going to clarify this, it is not one region of the world like this.  Anywhere in the wilderness, you do whatever you can to give emergency hospitality to others.  When the power goes out for 2 weeks a year, I use my tractor to pull a trailer with gallon bottles of water to help my neighbors who cannot backload their well.  I store insulin for 1 neighbor who cannot backload her fridges.  You just help each other out here.
I knew that Ricky guy was the problem.  Don't understand how people like him are EVER released from prison. Smh
For some reason I could hear dueling banjo's while you were telling this one 😮😮
Lol, if you only saw how close everyones yards are next to each other in Chicago. Plus they are super small
Wow, I loved this one!
How do you even do that to someone? Someone takes the time to help you when you need it, feeds you their food that they cooked for you, gives you fishing bait so you can be self sufficient, and then they get shot in cold blood for the favor. This world man, sometimes this world just baffles and disgusts me.
This defile through me for a loop
Oh my days!!! You never EVER dissapoint MrBallen 👌 I always end my Sunday nights listening to your channel. You're the best 💯♥️
Carry a gun people. Crazies already have one.
Terrific but sad, the killer should not have been release from prison......
If you want to hear about those murders, look up "this is monsters"
I feel the same way about the country music ugh👎👎
Why do we allow mrballen to lead us astray by pretending that Ricki was afraid of Scott due to the serial killer if he himself was the killer. Don't get me wrong it was an interesting story but the rules should be that everything has to be truthful, not like ballen who lies to us.
They caught fish but Ricky had no food 😕 did the other guy steal his fish 🤔
Everything Mr. Ballen is good! I enjoy them all and the fact our gut served and fought for our country !! Thank you for everything Mr. Ballen #mrballen #beststorytellerofall #usa #thankyou
Pretty twisted at the end
Yeah im more scared of humans instead of animals. Thats why i decided to have a cc due to these stories when i go hiking
Take the like button to a movie. Excuse yourself for a restroom break, but really leave them stranded.
Imagine if the guy said 'do you know how to get to bell canyon?'
A lot of crazy shit goes on at the Appalachian trails!!!!!
Just wanted to tell you just how much I enjoy all of your podcast collaborations...especially Run Fool (love Rodney's voice and style of storytelling).
💖🙂💖
That poor pup.. I wonder what happened to him/her
One of my favorite parts of the stories are the Real/not Real captions on the photos.  Just fun.
I'm so happy sean and Scott survived! Such a crazy story. They are very lucky
No other comment except keep up the videos. I love them all. You're great. I wish more people would have this talent that you have. By the way, I download every video you post and watch it multiple times. This ought to tell you something.
I knew about this one but rhe way you display this story makes it so much scarier. Thank you for this content ❤
Was this story made into a movie? Definitely would make a good one
Im glad those two felas still go out there and enjoy their spot. You can't let the bad guys win.
The observation deck is the perfect backdrop :)
Wow that twist was insane
I totally agree about the music thing. When I'm out in nature I never have music playing.
I don't know if they're still around but there used to be a cult that lived and worked along the trail!! I've lived in NC all my life! I've met and dealt with these cult members. If anyone asks you for help at their cafe or at their hotel politely say no. I know the rule is help those who ask but these specific people are EVIL! They might not be now but when I ran into them they certainly were!!
It's the same if you're a boater on the water if someone is in distress you can get a ticket for not helping them
Love…Run Fool!
I'm glad Sean and Scott made it out alive. I do wonder what happened to that poor dog though. Sad.
What hapoed to the dog???
If anything horrific ever happens to the like button, I'm sending the cops to Mr. Ballen's house.
This one really had a twist! Well done, Mr. Ballen, I really was fooled!😳
Dude..I love you so much. I'm so addicted to YouTube because of you LMFAO 😂😂 I will stop everything to watch a new episode. My god, how do you find these gripping-nail biting-crazy twist stories xD  You legitimately helped me get over the hardest breakup of my life LOL. I just sat there listening and it took me away from my pain and eventually the pain was gone.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING MY BEAUTIFUL DISTRACTION! ❤ -Emma, California
"Not a real photo of Ricky's fishing line" 😁
I was just thinking I wanted another good camping story!
What happened to the dog?
What happened to the dog???
Mr Ballen is one of the best story tellers I’ve come across 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
how many of these kinds of stories are going to have to happen until we stop letting literal murderers back onto the streets
I wonder if Scott's turning on the radio in the truck is what set ricky off, or if he felt that they were not being properly respectful to the Appalachian Trail and decided to force them to atone.
ALWAYS  be nice and respectful to people.  but yet...  always plan a way to defend yourself if things turn south.
☮️❣️
Just curious, how do you know it was 'satanic'? Like what was on tape?
1. Hikers/campers who play music on a speaker while other people are around should be arrested and imprisoned.   2. I assume that people who venture into the middle of nowhere without a firearm are actively trying to become the subject of a MrBallen story. 90% of these stories wouldn’t happen if the victim was armed.
What about the dog
Literally saw this story on Investigation Discovery just a few weeks ago. As soon as more details were being presented through MrBallen's story I knew the turn this story was going to take. Especially Scott showing up bleeding at a woman's house. I too when I saw it on TV was surprised both men survived the ordeal.
But was the dog okay
I can’t help but wonder what happened to the dog
Lmao this didn't happen far from where I am it's about a 20 or 30 minute drive (edit) Nevermind I remember hearing about this it's actually a lot closer than that
I conceal my pistol when going to the grocery store , gas station etc .the deep woods I’m carrying a pistol pocket knife bear spray and more . There’s so many crazy people out there .
Such a great story teller I miss the podcasts.
What gets me is the so many hundred thousand views, but you guys can't hit the like button....What's with that????? Great vid Mr Ballen...
What happened to the dog?
Excellent and very scary story. I love anything about the Appalachian Trail. It seems beautiful but quite treacherous up there. I’m glad Sean and Scott survived such a terrifying ordeal and are still able to go to Dismal Creek together.
My dad passed away last week and he did the same thing to our neighbor, just didn't light it on fire. It definitely killed the grass and took forever to grow back. It's like he's letting me know he's ok!
The more stories I hear about that trail, the more I want to stay away from it. If there were a highway that skirted the trail, I would love to drive it but to hike it, I don't think so. Thanks for your hard work! Take care and stay safe!
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG?!!
And he thought THEY  were disrespectful
The dog better survive
54 old man????
Great story!  I have only 1 small problem. Appalachian Trail is pronounced  Ap-a-latch-in. Thanks
WHAT HAPPENED TO DOGO
What happened to the dog?
That is such a nice view he has behind him. Must be expensive.
I don't know anything about podcasts how would I find it so I could listen to that run fool show?
The dog was mentioned a few times.......was it saved or just left out there for dead.  If you do not know the dog should not have been mentioned at all.
"Real photo of different trout" wtf lol
Wow poor Sean and Scott that is crazy but thank God they lived through it
Listening to the “Run, fool” promo sample at the end only fortified my already strong belief that Mr Ballen is in a league of his own.
did u seriously have to censor the word "crashed"? wtf
what happened to the dog?!?
A disgusting example of what happens to our veterans....now he is living off of not only vioence, but fictional violence.  None of the people in this video were born.  On top of the fact he is a traitor to his own team and makes men like me who ACTUALLY defended this nation look horrible.
A psycho killer can't be reasonable og ballen  good story
Got to be carful in the rural parts of western Virginia
Damn that was intense. Didn't expect it turn like that, very opposite on what I was thinking.
The RunFoil story teller is good but he has nothing on you Mr. Ballen
What happened to the dog?
This guy kills two people and gets paroled to commit more crimes.
Heard this story many times before but as it was Mr Ballen telling it, I had to listen again 😂
Americans' obsession with spending the night out in the woods with no help for miles 🤦🏼
Well, what happened to the pup?
Listening to your stories has definitely helps me get through my anxiety and my addiction thank you very much Mr John Ballen. I appreciate what you do
Thank you for the proper pronunciation of Appalachian trail 🫡
I knew Ricky was off from the moment he was camping with no food. This is exactly why you cant open up your home to a "homeless" person. I tried once, and the lady was extremely mentally ill. I was not able to help her, but I might have reunited her with her family. You should try to help someone who seems to be unable to care for themselves by calling police for a welfare check. Where I live in California there are a lot of homeless people with disabilities, now even some with intellectual disabilities.
i haven't missed a week of run fool. Its a super great podcast and im always on the edge of my seat listening to it every Tuesday.
At least this, it was hitting the right guy. kind of a 'happy end'. The story was very well told
This story would have been absolutely hard to guess the results after ricky  walked off. Tables turned instead
Your intro music tells my brain its scary story time, and soon as you said appellation, i just knew lol
Well, canceling the annual camping trip now.
What an amazing story! God bless those 2 men who made it through that horrible nightmare they experienced!! Mr. B is probably the most articulate person I’ve ever watched, and or listened to!!
What a good lady to help a person in need of help. My 31 years brother completed suicide 4 months ago and while he was doing it my sister in law went to our neighbors to ask for help and they didn't come just shruged her off , didn't call police, didnt call my parents. That type of prople u deal with in India. 😞😞😞
Banjos? Extremely scary? UM THIS VIDEO IS GONNA BE GOOD
Imma dox the like button
It is disrespectful to play country music under ANY circumstances!
I tried to listen to "run foo" I just can't w/that narrator. He's probably infamous for Bedtime stories 🎉🎉🎉
Wow! Another great story. Thank you Mr Ballen. God bless you! ☦️❤️
"If you like this video, please hit the like button so many times that only their middle finger is unharmed, so it can give you an appropriate reply after tapped near death " 😂😂😂 LOL jk Love your videos and storytelling Mr Ballen! Thank you! 😀
The like button retaliation is getting extremely physical & law breaking ....I am truly concerned that MrBallen will end up unemployed by bad verbal choices to millions of his true followers like the past on TV as example; like the Jenny Jones show outcome😮. Think about this & lighten up on the  cynical sarcastic choices told as humor. Simply because some peeps will take it as face value. 🤔
That really is a beautiful area. The waterfalls are gorgeous, there’s an amazing hostel (Weary Feet) just down the road and a grocery store for resupply all within a few miles. The woods in that section north of the falls do have a vibe tho. I was glad to be with my tramily.
I love listening to “Run Fool” on Amazon Music. I’ve been listening since Mr. Baller first mentioned him coming to Ballen studios. Thanks you Mr. Ballen for not only your amazing content but for bringing more amazing content to Ballen studios.
What an A-hole. 2 nice individuals helped him and his reaction is to kill them. I which that big guy was able to get his hands on Ricky. That would have been the justice that was deserved.
I am OBSESSED with Run, Fool! It’s top tier entertainment. Now I know why he is apart of ballen studios, he’s on the same level as you. It’s incredible! Well done!!!
Oh snap i remember hearing this on casual criminalist.  The details of this case were insane.
This is the second time that I’ve heard this tale told. The first time was on a Investigation Discovery “murder show” back in the 2010s, and it freaks me out every time. I have met weird people in the woods, but thank God, I’ve never had any bad thing happen like these guys did. Always amazing! Thank you Mr. Ballen for another great tale of the strange, dark, and mysterious.
That like button shit was violent and unnecessary. NOT FUNNY.
Not into horror or paranormal though 😢
I forgot it was a sunday was so excited when this notification came up 🤣
Excellent story Mr ballen.
But was the dog OK?
So what happened to Ricky's dog?????
How the hell did he only get 15 years for a double homocide. At the very least it should have been life without parole? People have gotten much harsher sentences for lesser crimes.
Sympathy for the Like button 👋👋
Went to listen and subscribe to Run Fool, and I love the catchy line ‘Don’ jus’ stand thaya, RUN FEWWL! ‘ 😂 🏃
"As Ricky was trying to calm his dog down he began to hear a voice in the woods right behind him." "Do you know how to get to Bells Canyon?"
When you first started telling this story I wondered ro myself if I had heard of this case  before on another channel that womeone else had covered. But, the way you told this story (and every other story you tell) had me hooked like, "Omg what's going to happen next?" "Whos the bad guy in this story?" Ect. Ya know, all the questions you ask yourself to try and figure out if your answers to those questions are right before you hear the end. So, when the end came I said to myself, oh I have watched a video about this case on another channel. But, it felt like the first time I was hearing about this. Thats how good of a story teller you are! Thanks again for another strange, dark, and mysterious video 🖤
7:06 yeah this is a new ballen story somethin is bout to go down Scott is too nice
As someone who has been watching your videos since nearly the beginning, it is amazing to be watching a fresh episode and just watch the "views" number climb right in front of your eyes. Im so proud of what your channel has become. ❤
Does anyone else miss the days of having the *”Secret Image”* hidden somewhere in a video and it was a game to see who was the first to find it?
the one thing ive learned from these videos is to stay far far away from the woods
Ricky may have thought Shawn and Scott “disrespected” the trail?? That is absolutely absurd of Ballen to try and make excuses for a homicidal maniac. More accurately, he’s just a fucking psychopath.
Did he just suggest we light our neighbors' houses on fire?  Oh no... just the like button's house.. i guess that is okay then
As usual, great story....and I love Run Fool!
Good afternoon Mr. Ballin new subscriber love the way you put the stories out there. Thank you very much.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You're the best! Thank you for immersing us in the story ❤
notha banga as always
"Run Fool!" is an AMAZING show, I highly recommend it!
Rodney Barnes is indeed a Great storyteller! Yet mr. John Ballen is a Truly an Amazing, Dark ,Mysterious with lots of Expressive hand gestures Storyteller Icon for the Modern age of Social media!
Run fool sounds like a black… no thanks
Sean and Scott are TANKS.  Dang.  All good things to them. 💖
I just saw Mr Ballen uploaded 50 mins ago and thought I might get close to a first like or comment but theres already over 25000 likes there. Amazing!
Wow, great story. Done by the master story teller. Tried the other guy and while his voice is calm, its just not the same. Sorry
Sneak into like button's room, go to his PC and click "stop render"
Country music pushed him over the edge i guess. Freaking psycho
Wow! Glad the good Samaritans didn't die, but wish we'd gotten more info before the killer died to see if he had more victims. Sad that he was even given a 2nd chance after taking 2 lives yrs back. -_-
Welp, just cancelled my camping trip this Summer lol.
Yessiiiiiir
How creepy. My family and i just planned a camping trip. Might cancel now 😮😮😂
Been obsessed with this channal for years now. I hope mr.ballen is around when i have kids so they can listen to him too❤
The story as usual was completely captivating but I'm here to say that you were absolutely right the guy in your new pod cast really does have the most soothing voice to listen to, which is good for me.because I plan to lol.
Was not expecting that!!!  Taught poor old Ricky was the target😂😂 ur brilliant 👏
How's the dog? Is he okay?
In the thumbnail it says "I hear banjos". I don't recall anywhere in this whole video any mention of the word banjos though lol??
I already had heard this story on Youtube,  but I only realize it was about that serial killer when the photo of the man appeared at the end. Great storytelling, as usual.
The old protagonist is actually the antagonist switcheroo . . . I love it!
There's a handful of stories where campers experience the paranormal or end up being a victim of bad luck in camping situations. Seems like we must always be mindful of who or what we interact with—unless they are considered non-violent or malicious in nature.
The only thing more disturbing than this story is the way you say "appalachain"
Can you do top places you cant go but people went anyways?
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG?!
I could swear I JUST heard this story.... Is this a re upload ?? Does anyone know ?
Damn! They fed him and invited him to their camp to hang out unbelievable.   Is the dog ok?
The best part of my weekend is a new episode to watch! I’ve literally watched every video on your channel. Thank you for the wonderful storytelling Mr. B!
The way Mr. Ballen presents these stories is something else entirely, the man has a gift. To not realize this was a story I've heard and am familiar with until 3/4 of the way through is pretty impressive.
I need more.. every night I listen to these i literally watched every one
There's an art to telling a good story, no matter the genre, and you do a beautiful job....love your stories.
Can we stop doing this stupid ass narrative where you try to make us humanize or be on the killers side? You have a weird thing for trying to make these killers like they’re good people in the beginning it’s honestly just weird. Perfect example is you trying portray Sean and Scott as hostile when they’re clearly weirded out by a serial killer. Just say you want a kiss from one
Dismal Creek and Dismal Falls are extremely dangerous.  I was hiking the trail with my sister.  We made it back to my car and started to drive away when we noticed a man who was parked beside us (and had been drinking) started tailgating us.  We sped up and he sped up.  We finally lost him but it was a very scary event.  In fact that guy looked a lot like Randall.  There was a couple killed in the same area.  Maybe they are all connected.
Thanks again 🇺🇸😊👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Where's good old Seagull Lung!? 😂😂
I miss hearing  "And we upload 3, 4 and even 5 times a week" I also miss the "secret" in each episode too. But i still am a dedicated subscriber and am here for it EVERY week.
another excellent 2a ad
greetings to the land shark 🤣
I love this channel !!
I'd listen to 'Run, Fool' if MrBallen narrated it 👍🏼
Screw helping strangers. Animals are more greatful. 🖕people
Omg there's another story about his on Spotify that sheds more light on Randalls life
Okay, but what about the dog in all this?
I didn't see "Ricky" being the one trying to kill Sean & Scott coming! I thought one of them... probably Sean since Ricky thought he didn't like him... was the one who tried to kill Ricky... and je (Ricky/Randall) was the guy at the door! Mr. B you are the most kick-ass talented storyteller I've ever seen/heard! No one could build up such suspense and manage to not hive ANYTHING away before you're ready too! You always have me on the edge of my seat, biting my lip, wondering if what I THINK has happened or is going to happen will be what actually happened.
I love MrBallen’s stories and been a fan since 2020. But I’ll be the first to say sometimes the format of him telling stories in a circle or hinting details and going back to them later…really annoys me 😂 I’m only annoyed with this format mostly when I already know the story
Make long story , we are tired of short one
Love.
Eeeeek, I'm a little late, but I'm here! The strange, dark, and moment I've been waiting for all day... 😍
Ok but what happened to the dog?
Anyone else pronounce it a-puh-la-chn?
Great story!  The truth is always scarier
The appellation trail.
I was so happy when I started posting to this. It was because I knew Ricky was going to make it in the end! The details of the campsite with the two strangers were too specific! They could’ve only come from Ricky!  I have a criminally analytical brain as a retired public defender. Those details did not escape me. I knew that Ricky made it off of that campsite !
I used to go on alot of solo hikes all around the Appalachian trails, i had always heard of murders that happened but never thought anything of it. This mustve been what i was warned about
I saw this story on the TV show, I Survived.
I recently watched "They Called Him Mostly Harmless" on HBO Max, so the timing of this story is spot on. A masterpiece, as usual.
What about his poor dog?
It's just automatic that SirBallen gets a like before the video has even started, because I know it's gonna be good 👍 👌 😌
Sean and Scott are still camping - good for them. I am hopeful that they live long, happy lives.
My vigilance went down and I too believed the old man was in a different type of troubles.
3:55 Ricky was well aware that he was not packing iron.
Wow, what a TWIST! Totally unexpected! I really believed that “Ricky” was a harmless older person and felt sorry for him until everything fell apart. So glad that those two campers survived, so incredible! That’s what I call high quality entertainment! I absolutely admire MrBallen’s storytelling skills, this channel is such a gem ❤
I love Mr ballen
I'm 6mins in and realized this is also in I Survived the TV show. Wow, glad I got it that early but I guess it ruins the twist
Actually I hate my neighbors
Glad Sean and Scott survived that horrible situation ... How terrifying 😮 . Thanks Mr Ballen 😊❤
Never go into the forest. Got it!
Needless to say, I absolutely love this channel, but the twist here felt kind of insincere. I mean the first half of the story is just a fakeout.
This is just wild!!!!
Is anyone else worrying about what happened to Randall's dog?? 😢
😀
I like Mr ballen has been slowly going from "make the like button brush thier teeth and then drink OJ." To now committing domestic terrorism on the like button.
Is de-boning a fish similar to boning a fish? My friend wants to know.
Mr. Ballen! As entertaining as ever!
Seemed unstable to me when he thinks that a knife in the timber is a weapon. Liberals will never understand what tools are.
How great it is to be able to sit down, relax, and hear about the strange, dark, and mysterious in a story format.
I am just so happy that Scott and Sean miraculously survived and still go to that hike
My Brian checked out in the beginning for a bit until he said gasoline, what does that say about me?
Nah...Old Randal was a cross-dresser.
I heard the banjos, too.
Me and my dad really enjoy your videos 🫶🏽
EXCELLENT as usual Mr.B !!❤
Imagine the vibe you would get if you just happened into Sean and Scott's campsite these days.  "Uhh, no offense, we're just kind of... cautious about strangers."
I love MrBallen!
I’m not a fan of that Run Fool channel….too much descriptive narrative that takes away from the story.  Mr Ballen is the GOAT
I seen some “i spit on your graves” or “the deliverance” or any related scary playing banjos
I love the way you do stoeytelling, it feels like scooby doo :)
Ok, you can't have a story with a dog in it and not tell us what happened to the dog 😅
👁️👁️   👅🙏... Hummmmmmmmm ...
What did the like button do to Mr ballen? 😢
Its crazy the lengths your body will go to survive when its in serious danger. Once that adrenaline starts flowing its like we gain some kind of super powers. Really interesting stuff
Wow! Insane they lived. Great story!
You really should do the salt creek monster story from Australia
I need to know what happened to the dog. All I could think about after the bleeding guy knocked on the door was "what happened to the poor doggo".
That was pretty good! I know how the stories always take a weird turn at the end, but I was not expecting that ending! 👍🏼
less than 1.5m subs to go for 10 mil!!
I lived about 45 minutes from Dismal Creek when this happened and remember seeing interviews with Sean and Scott. They seemed like decent, friendly guys who were just trying to help someone out.
craziest plot twist I ever heard
Its not a "police scanner"  no such thing. It's a...  scanner. That can get police frequencies.
Wow...didn't see that coming!
Moral of the story, don't trust the strange hobo living in the woods.
MONDAY MYSTERY AND SUNDAY STORIES ARE WHAT I LIVE FOR!!!! thank you sir for everything you do! I wish you could narrate a novel!!!!
😂😂 your pranks against the like button are getting very dangerous 😅😂.
Nice plot twist, did not see that coming, who would have thought that the person this story is about is... the person it is.  Man, your story telling talent is just insane. I bet you could tell the very same story five times, each time from a different perspective, and have it appear like a completely new story, each time. I'm hooked and Sunday evening always makes me happy. :)
I dig it
tricky tricky.
I used to ride my horses at dismal, beautiful place!!!
A few big plot twists! Wow. Your switch of focus works well. I immediately replay it.
Called it from the beginning
That’s crazy for Ricky to just turn on them like that
I remember this happening. Scott's sister was my daughters dance teacher.
Wait how in the hell did he get a second chance to get out and murder/ get that chance to hurt anyone. And man those dudes got cheated for justice.
another one
Great video!
Ok but what happened to the dog??
another case of no good deed goes unpunished
I knew I'd heard this story before!!! I like how you switched it up though. Great story telling as always.
Just love Ur stories when my baby's with Der dad I binge watch Mr ballen, lol ❤❤❤❤
What did they get shot with a .22? Lol Jesus
We are at the right channel today.  Thanks mr Ballen. ❤
You hear banjos?? Is that like ban JO or banjo?? Cause you say that like its a bad thing. I play the banjo. Does that mean im some stupid hillbilly hick? Mmmyeah. Maybe
Wonder what happened to his dog.🤔😏🤥
It was the strangest of times; it was the darkest & mysterious of times.
Story time  @mrballen, thank you
I don't wanna go camping anymore
Killed 2 people, served 15 years and let out on parole. Ayup.
What about the dog???
Guess there are places where nature doesn't respect you back and might even $¢r€w with your mind. Usually when the guy that fires multiple gunshots is the only one that gets killed the opponent is a bear.
I must've missed it but what was the big explosion?
Wow crazy story. You told it amazingly.
I feel highly  disturbed already
Thank goodness for MrBallen made my Sunday better ❤
I am happy for them❤
❤Another great story with a twist ending, love the way you tell them John, ❤love you too xxx ❤
I've been saying mrballen should get back to these types of stories for months/years.. and stories like this is why I carry a 10mm in the woods lol
MrBallen, i have the same Yeti hat,its my work hat lol.
Randall should have been put down for the first two murders and releasing him for "good behavior" is an insult to the people he murdered.  I find it odd that the two women lived in a very isolated location yet EMS was able to get there fast enough to save a guy who had been shot in the neck and was apparently suffering from an arterial bleed and a guy who had been shot in the face AND chest.
Mr Ballen and Mr Nightmare are the best storytellers on YouTube.
Incredible story. That's why you put this people to sleep forever, and you don't take 2nd chances. 16 years, and he was released?
An act of kindness almost cost two men their lives... Makes you think. Maybe the country music disturbing the peace of the night, made Randall snap, but who knows...?
Another reason why I always carry while hiking lol
Rickey Williams was just stoned probably… jk I know it’s not that Rickey Williams
On Randall's missing poster, they referred to him as "the suspect" numerous times and then wrote at the end that "the suspect is not wanted for anything. Just checking for wellbeing". The choice of words is just a little strange.
OMG! Am I the only one who pictured this Rickey Williams as an old decrepit Black guy for the whole story!?? (Right up until the end) Maybe, bc. the very 1st image that came to mind , when I heard the name, was the former Dolphins RB.. 😮
Our justice system is so screwed up. When I hear stories like this where they have a murderer in custody but release them at some point back into society and they murder again, those who release evil like this back into society should themselves be held accountable. We live in a time where people just don't value life.
I would love if you cover the infamous "Zodiac Killer Case"
As much as I haaaaaaaaaaate the Like button, I am NOT going to break the law to scare’em. :-)
Keep it up Mr B
I'm so happy to hear that Scott and Sean still enjoy their camping spot despite the evil that they encountered there.  I'm sure that knowing that the guy was dead helped, but it would still be unnerving the first time or two that they went back. It had to be! I'm glad that they hung in there and didn't let evil win.  Thank goodness those two ladies who lived in the middle of nowhere were brave enough to open their door that night.  In doing so, they saved two lives.....two of the GOOD guys in this world!
2:37  Did they ask, “Do you know how to get to Bell’s Canyon?”
Nice video, well done Mr Ballen!
why didnt he just eat the dog?
One hell of a Curveball John!! Brilliant storytelling as always! I was really rooting for "Ricky" until the end!
That’s messed up lol poor like button. 😅
I feel more myself in nature, and love just being in the deep woods with no one else. I'm also well aware of how other people are and I'm always armed and cautious if I run into someone else. Which is why this May when I turn 42 I'm retiring early, moving back to Alaska and buying a big plot of land in the most remote area I can find to mostly live off the land.
Im really getting tired of this channel. Been watching since he first stayed and his videos are just so boring now. Its hard to stay awake during some of them.Ballen stated in a video that the people that he hires to make the scripts go through a class and that the story has to follow a certain flow. When he said that I knew this channel was gona start to become recycled crap. When you tell a story the exact same way every time like clockwork, it starts to feel like repetition of language with a different story. No more creative freedom. His videos for the last year have been so underwhelming. I use to get soooo excited when I got a notification for a new video and watch it as soon as i had time. Now I think I only watch a video every month or so now and I always regret it at the end when it's the same "twist" ending that a four year old could figure out. Damn shame. I believe hes also reusing his old stories that ive already heard, either that or they really just are all repeptive nonsense. Sucks fof the diehard fans that have been here since the beginning.
Gegigedagefagoudagpu I been marred long time ago
Love your stories, but your intros make me cringe😳
On a side note, does anyone know what the like button ever did to Mr Ballen to deserve such cruel and unusual punishment every time?😅
What happened to the poor dog? 😢
You really built up the suspense! What a diabolical case.
What happened to the dog?
How awesomely told!
Run Fool! is one of my favoeite podcasts! Rodney is a fantastic storyteller and his team does great job. It's a must listen!
here again for the awesome disturbing stories
hot damn! love a good scary camping story
Wow great one today! I didn't see that twist coming at all!
Is the dog okay?
These are the kinda stories I've been missing on this channel for a while
can u do something on the little Albert experiment
This is extremely worrisome John, my cousin Smiley is a big time thru hiker and he has hike AT several times over his years of his walks across America 🇺🇸. He doesn’t carry a weapon other than a small ultralight pocket knife and bear spray which we all know will be no good against an attacker with a firearm. He’s a former Sailor but he’s not a former Seal 😂 like you sir. He’s currently here in East Texas with us working but he’s planning to head out at the end of our busy season to start his next Walk Across America 🇺🇸 and I still haven’t convinced him to get a sub compact or micro compact pistol to carry with him. He’s somewhat concerned about the states that still require a permit of sorts to carry concealed and also other places along his walk that don’t permit firearms to be carried. I hate it that’s he’s out there in this crazy world without a weapon to protect himself but I do understand his dilemma and decision not carry. I personally carry everywhere I go lol my current EDC is a Shadow Systems MR920 and my secondary is a CR920 Elite both with red dot optics for the hell of it lol. I’m a big 2A supporter and I’m very thankful for Americans like you that served our country so we are allowed to carry and protect ourselves. Thank you for your service and for what you do with your platform sir. Skål 🍻
This podcast was way better when it was his only one the bigger he gets the shitter these vids get so sad how that works
Randall should never be out in society.  You just can't trust that mf
I love Run Fool.  Everyone should listen.  But they are really short.  OR. Maybe they are so absorbing that they go by so fast…  Mr Ballen, can you do some longer ones?   I could list to hour long ones for sure easily.  😅😅😅
what if they both needed help? lol
Dismal Creek isn't far from me. Like just over the hill. My husband fishes there.
22:22 How about no one knows WHYYY Lyin’ Randall was allowed to leave prison after committing unprovoked DOUBLE MURDER!!?!
Anything but the cave diving stories, i cannot relate, and i refuse to relate.  Otherwise great content.
damn, what a turn around....you never know who you're going to run into..
You are correct. He has a wonderful voice. Thank you.
So am I the only one wondering what happened to the dog?   I’m going to replay in case I missed it but 😅
Piles of eyeglasses 😨🤤👀👀👓👓👓👓👓👓
Happy those men survived and moved on with their lives💪🏾
Apparently they don't keep lists of missing people on those trails though?
i was watching a different clip, and i saw the thumbnail for Mr Ballen right at the top (obvs).  it says "i hear banjos," sure.  but what I *read* was "i bear handjo_s."  edit; for anyone curious, the clip i was watching was a heavyweight brawl between Ryan Reaves (TML) and Mett Rempe (NYR).
Missed you Mr Ballen❤🎉
So... Was the dog ok?
Creepy, disturbing, camping … I’M IN!!!
this was actually a brilliant told story!
I would have so much ptsd from the trail if I were Scott or Sean that I would never go back. Let alone stay around the woods at night.
Bring back the missing 411
When you think your friend who is built like a Mack truck will protect you out in the woods while camping...
When Ricky first heard the voice in the woods I was hoping it would say "Do you know how to get to Bells Canyon??"
What happed to the dog?😢 I need to know
I knew the good ole Tennessee boys weren’t the bad guys 🙌🏼
Yayyy! I miss your camping stories!!
Making "Ricky" seem like the protagonist in the beginning threw me off, but I recognized the story pretty quickly. Good stuff
OK Mr. Ballen, we got to admit you got us all. You put us in Ricky's shoes and made us feel threatened by the other two strangers in the forest.
Sean and scott im sure mr ballen has told this story before but in the context of the survivors point of view???? I could be wrong though because  i listen to alot of crime storys and missing people storys  . And it was a very good telling of this story so i dont mind 😂.Just wish we could have more storys like twice a week or three times 😂
Can you do a series of camping only stories ? Or just put the camping ones you have done into into a playlist ?
So Sean’s instincts on Ricky were correct from the jump! Glad they survived that!
What happened to the dog???
Mr.Ballen, Golf Clash, Boston Cop Lights & Sirens. Complicated moral  value when someone comes off needing help ends up being a deranged psychopath killer. This story tells me the moral is always be on guard and have a firearm cause it may be in your best interest.
My 16 year old daughter and I love your videos! We also love camping. Camping will never be the same after these videos 😂
ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! 2 hours in And 1300 comments already 😂
What a plot twist!
Ever since I saw my Very First Mr Ballen episode, which was almost 2 years ago now, I was Hooked! Needless to say Mr B, Like Millions of others, I am a Huge Fan of you, your channel, and Of Course your videos as you are Incredibly Gifted at story telling- HOWEVER, I had one Very Big Issue with this particular video- And that is, I Will Always Wonder about what happened to “Ricky’s” poor doggie- Even though he/Ricky was apparently an Evil Lunatic- Anyways, wishing you and your family Many Blessings and Keep up the Great Work!
Ive been backpacking and cross country hiking since i was 16 and ive run across some real weird people in the middle of nowhere. I always carry bear mace and a fire arm when im out in the woods. Better safe than sorry
Very clever how you made us think that Ricky was going to be the victim and the other 2 guys were the bad guys but it was the opposite! Great story like always. 🙂
*Biggest plot twist I've heard in a while...* wtf. "Ricky" made it seem like Sean & Scott were the weird ones but noooo, I was wrong...🤯
Bring back the spooky stories!
This took a massive, unexpected turn. I cannot believe how this ended. Telling the story from the POV of the person you chose was genius & was a complete shock to me!
My favourite  stories without a doubt are the ones place’s you shouldn’t go and they went anyways amazing couldn’t stop watching from then love your channel mrballen
The Appalachian trail is... interesting. Sean and Scott are such badass men for surviving such an ordeal! I'm glad they're okay.
I saw this on "I survived" The best show!
Thought #2. " mentally unwell" equals "bat shit crazy" at least in this story.  Toodles
I’m so happy I found the best channel for strange dark and mysterious content delivered in a story format ❤
Meh
As soon as I heard there was "satanic rituals tape in the tent" I knew it was Ricky who attacked. 😂
Unbelievable that he served only 15 years for the double murder.
I don't believe you one bit!
I was just on TikTok last night and videos popped up about the mountains and the next day, Mr. B you come out with a video about these same mountains 🤣🤣
I got a little bit confused but then I realised    OH SHIT RICKY AKA RANDELL IS SHOOTING THEM!
There no code for the A.T.  to help others.
Rodney Barnes like the movie producer/writer?
Meh voice isn’t Morgan freeman level
Wow.... crazy or what, A amazing story. Thank you.
Mr.Ballen story tip for you:Lake Bodom murders
Bro at 8:00 I so confidently said "OH MY GOD THEY ARE GOING TO EAT RICKY AREN'T THEY!?" like girl no 😭
What happened to the dog?
I was going to say, the moment you showed the picture... "WHY is this called "dismal creek"?" ...because even the first picture is gorgeous.  So NOT dismal.
I love @runfool! Been listening since trailer! My fave so far is #boohags! #labmalahora #deadchildrensplayground&theknockknock! Rodneys voice is amazing and can’t wait for part 2 of vampire one🎉
Sean and Scott remind me of Tucker and Dale
Like this comment or else Ol’ Seagull Lung gets it!!!
This is one of my favorite fucked up camping stories! Love the way you told it ❤
Great story as always.  To be more authentic, it's pronounced "apa-LATCH-ens".
I run away from people so that would never be a problem 😂💁🏼‍♀️
Murderers should never be set free, they won't change their evil ways.
That poor like button, I'd hate to get on the wrong side of MrBallen! Lol Another great story!!
Love your channel and Thank You for you service.
Paused it at 16:09. My guess is that either . . . . . Scott or Shawn (didn't check spelling) is the guy on the porch, Ricky crashed the truck. The S name not shot is in the woods/at the creek. My guess.
My guy
That was good. And I love the twist at the end.
I want to know what happened to the dog.
I wasn't sure how I felt about Run, Fool! At first but after listening to a few, I really started to like it
I like how this guy sets up the twists and turns in these stories.
Warning: do not look up Randall Lee Smith till after the story
Not a real photo of Ricky’s fishing line made me bust out laughing😂.. thank you John for another great video!
this type of video is the reason i started watching you, its getting me nostalgic of the days i binged on multiple of your videos a day, i miss those days.
Mr Ballen, plz, 54 is not elderly. Please, im 54. And also very normal.
Very well-constructed retelling of this horrible story.
Deliverance music plays*
Not Mr Ballen endorsing arson
Thank you Mrballen. It has been so long since I realized why I never have ANY desire to go hiking, camping, fishing, looking for Bigfoot or any other reason to go out in the woods. Funny side note, I live in the Appalachian Mountains, part of the Mountain State, the 35th state of the Union,  West Virginia. I do look at said mountains from my back porch just to make sure they're still there. Actually thats not 100% true, I do venture out to make some shine. No joke.  Toodles
I have an idea to really put the like button in its place…..
I had just watched a video about this a month ago. I think it was on the tv show called I survived.
"Yeah, he murdered two people in cold blood, but he was a pretty cool dude while in jail.  Had some good stories.  He totally gave me a recipe for chocolate chip cookies.  I mean, c'mon.  We let him out early."   THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS GOOD BEHAVIOR WHEN YOU'VE GONE A KILLED PEOPLE IN COLD BLOOD!  The legal system is a freaking joke.
wow! that had me all tense! excellent story telling! this was perfect for this rainy day!
dang things escalated with the like button 😂 we’re committing arson now
I knew Rick was the killer. Mr.Ballen usually tells the stories like that. First, introduce the killer like he or she is innocent.
Yes pleasee , go back to scary mysterious stories for this year.
I’m getting to the point of addicted to these videos that I genuinely don’t know what I’d do if you stopped them 😅 Start from the beginning all over again? Probably. Thanks for all you do!
After a long Sunday at the restaurant, there’s nothing I love more than coming home and hearing stories of the strange, dark and mysterious 🤘
54 is an older man? Lol
This is definitely one of the better videos from Mr Ballen in the last few months. I was able to figure out the twist by the time the sponsor break ended but it was still pretty shocking. I’m so happy that Sean and Scott survived.
Mr Ballen's videos are one thing I look forward to after a long week 🫡
Every sunday my mom and i watch your videos! i travel to her so we can watch together! we love you and your content john! thank you for all the good stories! keep it up :)
Thank you, Mr. Ballen for another great episode. Today is my birthday, and your stories help me unwind from PTSD. If I'm not listening to your channel, I'm listening to Unshackled episodes from back in the day.
I believe your clock is broke. Posted at 3pm not 2pm as we were told yesterday. 💪🏽🧐🫵🏽 🤘🏽🥳🤘🏽
Thank you Mr. Ballen for another upload! We ❤ you!
Remember when MrBallen used to post 3-4 times a week😢
Two loveers, forbidden from one anotheer.  A waaar diviiiides their peopllllee. And a moouuntain divides them apart...   They built~  a~  path~  to~  be~  toogetheeeer~  *AND  DIEEEEED......*
I spent 6 months thru hiking the Appalachain Trail in 2018. Happy to report nothing too crazy occured
can't expect fans of you to be fan of someone else and go watch their podcast. we like your voice & story-telling, that's it <3
Not another really old story, told by countless youtubers. No wonder I never click on ballen videos anymore. Yawn
There are trail angels that leave food in drop boxes. Boxes made from wood with a latch type lid. These boxes are usually attached to trees along the trail. The trail angels are locals from the little towns that run along the trail.  Maybe the food boxes that Ricky found were empty. Hence the reason he was starving. If Ricky and his dog would have made it to these little towns then he would have gotten homemade meals,a shower,and a nights stay away from the trail. These towns take in long term hikers whenever a storm or hard rain or snow coming. Churches open their doors and trail hostels are open during bad weather so hikers can get away from bad weather and get a hot meal served and a hot shower. These places will have a log book so in case something happens to a hiker the authorities will have some kind of sighting of hiker.
Live people are the scariest things about living on this planet.
Yeeeeah more horror camping stories!!! Perfect bedtime story🥰
If youre in the woods, and hear banjos, RUN!!!
Got my  BALLENTINES DAY  sweatshirt 😎💯💀
That Chapter and Mr Ballen must share notes 🤔 lol
This is why I don’t do 💩for nobody.  You never know who has a gun in their jacket & women’s underwear in their tent 😑🤨
Ap- pul- latch- un.....
Just egged the Like button’s house
That was my fishing line!
I was kinda hoping that The Dog was driving the jeep.
I trashed the like buttons yard, are you coming to bail me out?
What happens to the dog?
Whoa!  Then to go back to the same camp area?!  Crazy story.
Hey hey, Karen here, the podcast ad placement made it REALLY hard to follow the story. I had to go back 3x. I was really enjoying the story
Whats the deal with the TM podcast?
'Run Fool' truly is as good as Mr. Ballen says it is! And it deals with folklore & cryptids, which is really fun.
Good for them. It must be a beautiful place if they keep going back after that.
MR JM THATS WHY HIS MAKING $$$$$$$$
Please do not pour gasoline in anyone's yard and light it! 🙄👎
I'm dreading the news tomorrow when they start counting how many yards are put to fire.
Wow. I feel bad for both guys, but imagine being sean.. just shot in the head but still alive and staring right into the eyes of the person who is actively trying to murder you. Thats gotta be a hard thing to wrap ya mind around so quickly.
That was a great one Mr. B, keep em coming👍👍😊👍🌠❤️🐕🐕🙏🙏
Wow they went back to the camping area they got shot at. Props to them. I just bet they are taking a gun with them from here on out lol
It always a Ricky.
Did you say 'had came off'? That's not English, Ballen!
I asked the like button to have Mr Ballen like my comment and the like button said they don’t talk anymore
Mr. Ballen got people out here committing felonies on the like button’s property 😅😅😅
John you are so dang funny and so good at storying. All the little details of your videos bring me so much joy. Thank you for everything 🎉🎉
WOW
Karma's a b"'# -Ricky 😂
Sir...I am already a fan of Run! Fool!
I am confused. How could Shawn and Scot not be aware that the shooter had a shotgun?
I love Run, Fool!  I can't wait until Tuesday's to listen to it!
The two hikers killed were a lesbian couple p sure. He watched them through the night before attacking them
He was fishing with Ricky for a day and they NEVER talked about why they were there?!🧐
THIS. More of this. Im doing my make up getting ready to go out to eat and my pulse is racing 😂😭
I hate it when some giblethead starts blasting music while I'm trying to enjoy the outdoors.  Can't shoot 'em, though!
We should judge other much more
I just love listening to these while playing games. absolutely perfect :D
That's why clinically insane criminals should never be paroled.
The storyteller all other storytellers are now measured by...
Maybe they were too close to his campsite.
one day we are going to get a scary story about the like button getting revenge on all of us.
Man, I was thinking that Ricky was about to be killed 😮 great story, MrBallen!
you are such a good story teller
Anyone else wondering what happened to the poor dog??
I am from the area in the story, there are a lot of stories that comes from the trail.
Randall don't like stranger's up round dismal
Who agrees that MrBallen deserves 9 Million subs? (Love your videos! Keep up the god tier work! 🙌 ❤)
I love that Mr Ballen totally flips the script on you, I thought Scott and Sean were going to hurt the old man. I love the twists in the endings and this is why I love Mr Ballen! 😄
Is it wrong of me to only have one thought, what happened to the dog.
What happened to the end of the camping story?
Why do I have a feeling Mr.Ballen doesn't like his neighbors. 😳
How does a serial killer get released? Ridiculous.
I hate to ask, but what happened to his dog? I will just pretend it was taken and had a "Dodo" happy ending where he eats every day and can still go on hikes.
I ❤ Monday mornings. Pay day w a dose of MrBallen 😊
That last picture of Sean and Scott standing next to each other really put it into perspective just how big Sean really is. Wow!!
What a miracle that those two men survived! 😮❤
More 411? I loved that series
What happened to the dog???
Their episode on I Survived is amazing.
Had to lol at the “I hear banjos” caption
So riki ...spelling it like that for a reason...so riki says he goes in the woods all the time. But then he's all hungry and unable to fend for himself and has to rely on other more experienced people?
Can anyone tell me if the dog was okay?
Wait the beginning sounds like Randal, who shot those 2. Haven't u covered this already?
Every time I hear a story by you,even if it's one I've heard a hundred times, it's like a brand new story, because you're an amazing storyteller 😊
This guy loves adding details to his stories that nobody could know. Never mentioned in the trial or anything. Kind of like a movie director, just loves exaggerating. Pretty despicable tbh.
What happened to Ricky or Randals Dog?
There's nowt as evil than a man led by the Devil
I really liked his account of his own paranormal experience and I was trying to find more stories like that told from the firsthand perspective- does he have any like that you guys know of? And if not, @MrBallen I’d love to hear some more like that!!!
I love his like button gags.  It feels like he is describing the most naïve person on the planet.  Only slightly worse than one of my former co-workers.  😆🤣😂
Horns Down, Horns Down
I grew up playing and hunting around dismal I still go to dismal falls every summer but it’s Appalachia I grew up here and I’m always armed ! While Cougars packs of wild dogs coyotes and bears are a threat my fellow man is the real danger !
What a relief...at least the dog didn't get shot!
3/4 way through I started to think Ricky/ Randall was culprit. This was a great one MrBallen ❤. Thanks
Good thing they didnt let him fillet one of the fish he may of tried to fillet shawn and scott🙏
15:39 bookmark
The whole time I’m like “what about the dog?”, “Is the dog ok?” , “Did the dog eat?”
18 minutes in... This dog better be okay! What happened to the dog?!?
Hoisting  holographic from depends how many people in this country and the other passengers have not heard of any one who cares about your business in any manner that will make your business easier
but what happened to the dogg😭😭
As a fellow veteran (USAF Security Forces), I can't tell you how much I love your channel. Totally awesome stories delivered in an amazing way by the most chill dude I've ever seen. I've binged your channel since i found it. Keep up the amazing work! 😎
Never missed a Ballen Sunday Best day of the week
I've heard this story, not long ago, actually. I believe KyleHatesHiking covered it but from the perspective of Scott and Sean, so it didn't sound familiar at first.
so creepy this dude was stalking peoples camp sites when they slept and stole their stuff..damn
You are going to have some LEFTOID report your intro.
At least we have a good ending 🎃
I’m out to marry you!!!
❤❤❤❤
Thanks babe.
HA!!  "Not a real photo of ricky's fishing line".
With all the stories you do on people killed or abducted or whatever in the forrest. Its still 💯% safer than being around people. Populated by humans areas are more evil and wicked than any secluded areas. Give me the forrests any day.
Sundays used to be my least favorite day of the week as the dread of the coming week set in. I have found little things to help & mr. Ballens sunday uploads certainly help keep away the sunday dread 🥹
love the videos, keep up the great work
This is a repeat but told in such a way I didn’t realize it until they started to eat the fish
First hour club
Run fool, I thought you said lung full.. like lungy had his own YouTube channel I was so excited... 😢😅
you should do the missing 411
What happened to the dog?
what I wanna know is who was stupid enough to think this guy was harmless enough to be released
I wasn't really listening, so I sprayed gasolene all over my neighbor's garden, was I supposed to set it on fire?
What happened to the dog 😭
I thought this sounded familiar. It was on an episode of Dead Silent called The Curse of Dismal Creek. I love your channel
Wheres SEAGULL LUNG 🐸
Real photo of diff trout lol
yesssssss NEW MR BALLEN  O YEH
its time guys!!!!
Anyone else wondering about the dog
What if all parties need help? Who's coming to save us😢
Scott still has a bullet in him?? Was it not possible to get out? Or was it like a Tony Stark situation where it's too close to a vital organ? Lol
Listen man, if the birds can sing all day and the bugs can sing all night, I can play a couple songs out in nature.
Code name:” like button assassin club” has executed task!!! Like button never seen it coming. Lol. Your welcome.
guys! (NOT A REAL PHOTO OF RICKY FISHING) !!!!
How in the hell do you murder two people and then granted parole?!?
I wonder if he was planning to go on a killing spree at those other locations on the map.
I'm so glad Scott and Seann survived. I was afraid they wouldn't live to tell the tale. Randell got the ultimate karma
Ballen time babyyyy!!!! I look forward to these every single Sunday 😎🙌🏻
I recognized this story pretty quickly but i love mrballen storyrelling style with the twist
They were all 3 in the hospital afterwards so I wonder what happened to the dog? Was he in the vehicle when it crashed? Perhaps the police made sure that dog got to an animal rescue place?
You know it’s a good day when Mr Ballen posts a new video - the GOAT!
I absolutely love Run, Fool! it's so good go listen now
Regardless of laws, I'm not going in the woods without a defensive caliber handgun onward. Isn't happening. No way.
Man i enjoy making up to a new Mr Ballen episode every week
😎✌🏻
Our laws are terrible, how did this clown get out of jail after doing these other murders!
I remembered hearing this story on "I survived."
I hate podcasts 😒  I have adhd lol I need to look at something... face to face story telling is what makes ballen so good... feels like he's talking to YOU
That narrator of Run, fool, he makes me think of Don LaFontaine a legend.
What a great way to end a long day at work :3
Thats why you never release people like this from prison.
Hay,what happened to his dog,any ideal 💡
Stories of crazy things like this happening in the woods, is what got me hooked on MrBallen. I'll never forget the bells canyon one 😂.
*Moral of the story: STOP BEING SO FRIENDLY TO STRANGERS AND TRUST YOUR INTUITION*
Damn, those men are so stoic. I don’t know if I would be the same in those circumstances
What a twist I was feeling very sorry of the older man Ricky🤯🤯🤯🤯
That's a wild one
Randall should have stayed in prison. Why do people keep getting out of prison for murder on "good behavior"? I can understand some people can change, but not others.
I'm just saying...... What kinda American hikes without a gun.  Laws blah, permits blah.. Stop letting people tell you when and how you can protect yourself...  Get you a small gun, and carry it.. Dont be breaking no other laws.. keep your mouth shut. Have all your other stuff legit so some tyrant cop aint got no reason to sniff around and youll be fine
It's Ballen o'clock! ❤
Bruh.......I never knew storytelling  could be so good
I love to listen to your stories and do my house chores😊
I have missed you
What about his dog?
Great another original vid with actual work put in im sick of those lazy reaction videos too bone idle to do any actual research well done
I love the forest storys ❤️ wish you would upload more bro but understand your busy
I have to say, while I am fascinated by true crime and also, the strange, dark, and mysterious, Im not a big fan of the horror genre. I wasn't sure I'd like Run, Fool! but I was hooked at the first episode. Rodney, like Mr Ballen, is a fantastic story teller. Sometimes the subjects of the stories are familiar figures and others I've never heard of, but they are always interesting. The stories themselves are like modern fables, always with a lesson to be learned. I definitely recommend fans of Mr Ballen check the podcast out. (Also, Mr Ballen is right about Rodney's radio voice. I could listen to  read an Ikea instruction manual. It is that good.)
Wow
I've BEEN hooked on Run Fool!
Yesss another creepy camping story!! love these 😍😍
Love your stories and the way you tell them 😊 And Rodney Barnes voice is amazing, you’re right!
I just thank God the two guys made it. You just never know who you're going to run across.
Is this a recycled episode by chance? Because i swear I heard this story a couple weeks ago on MrBallen Podcast. Either way, great video as always!
Mr Ballen! go back to the beginning content. I love your growth,but the old style is what had me hooked.   An onemore thing i see u are not to be played wth you are torture to the like button. 😂How bout liliking the like button poor thing😂❤
thanx
Hey ballen I was wondering if while making this was NFL Ricky Williams in the back of your head cuzzz I thought NFL Ricky lol love the story though
Mrballen please make more mysteries and ghost stories, there so much better then true crime
Gotta get my Ballen on for the week. WOOO favorite part of Sunday for me
26:30 well if I must then I will.... That poor poor like button 😢
MY NEPHEW NOW HAS THE POLICE LOOKING FOR HIM DUE TO YOU TELLING HIM TO LIGHT A FIRE. YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM AN ATTORNEY JOHN!!! SHAME ON YOU
BOOM!!  MR b- ALLEN, OF QUINCY MASS..  THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE CAME TO SEE!! this is the exact thing we want, granted you could tell a story of Bob Ross painting & make it sound interesting but this is the content we want you to stick to..  You know how many disappearance stories you've also yet to tell? Doesn't have to just be piggy backing off missing 411 either. These stories like this one & the missing persons cases.. with that old nostalgic/creepy music you used to play.. is it sir. Somewhere in between the the start of this channel 4 years ago & now you've hit on other true crime cases but we want the unexplained creepy sh*t.   Like one of the greatest philosophers of our time once said "I DONT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS BUT ITS PROVOCATIVE... IT GETS THE PEOPLE GOING "  Old creepy soundtrack + Mr Ballsohardallen +  unexplained & unsolved creep sh*t= very happy campers   Hope all is well,     Lawrence (from quincy too)
I miss the old ballen...saying that, i love the new ballen too...things change.
The disclaimers that he is forced to put up on the photos are a sad reflection of society. Gone are the days where you only needed to do that if it was real to make an impression on the viewer because we would all assume the others are put there for our visual benefit.
Please please please fo the hello kitty case I find is so fascinating it's one of my favorite murder cases
barnes sucks
Don't care about Sean and Scott, I feel bad about the dog that lost it's owner.
This is what I miss from your channel. The offshoots of your channel don't have the face expressions or arm movement like this one does
But what happened to the dog😕
What happened to the dog though? lol
What happened to doggo?
I'm so glad Sean and Scott survived!
Yay I am number 12k person who liked this video #ballancrew
Mr B ❤ love learning from you! Thank you for you and your teams hard work!!
Okay okay your whole subversion thing worked this time nice haha
Once I heard Appalachian trail I went oof😮 this gonna be juicy
No offense to the narrator of Run Fool but his voice has a bit of a lisp - his tongue is either too thick for his mouth or he has a big space between his two front teeth where his tongue plugs the gap when he tries to texturize his voice when vocalizing certain consonants  and vowels. Not appealing to my ears.  It would have been cool if you and Mr. Nightmare paired up.
Yep I’ve hiked there!
Damn what a gripping story! That was a bizzare twist, thank God they survived to tell about it.
Most YouTubers: hit that like button Mrballin: go to there house and ruin there life is so horrific ways that it is worse than death
I miss you
Before I ever start doing remote camping, I'm getting a thermal optic.
Crazy story
Well this just made sitting in the hospital so much better thank you MrBallen ❤
I'm happy Scott and Sean lived!! ❤
OMG! 😳😱
Hello Mr. Ballen,  I have been wondering if you had any more installments of Missing 411 in the works. Owning a copy of the book, “Devils in the detail” myself there are so many great cases you could do more strange and mysterious segments on!
18:18 wow well you never disappoint! Great video
You talk about periodic Justice
Mr. Ballen, do you have any stories involving Mount Shasta?
2:40 "Do you know how to get to bells canyon?"
And I thought the like button might just catch a break this year...
Very good story 👏 my favorite story you did was music executive killed by witchcraft...in my opinion that is the most scariest story
what happened to the dog though?
Blasting country music is disrespectful to anyone anywhere. Lol
Been binge watching your videos literally for the past couple days  best content on YouTube amazing. Keep up the good work.
No thanks, I only want you telling stories....
I didn't use gasoline, but I definitely did use a riding mower on the lowest setting n mowed a huge F U in a lawn before.
Am i the only one that thought “you know how to get to bell canyon” when he said the guy heard a voice in the woods 😂
What happened to the dog 🐕?? 😢
Mr. Ballen,  I am a Sasquatch that live on the Blueridge Parkway. Please encourage Your viewers to pack BBQ sauce with Them. Ty 😊
everyone loves MrBallen I love watching the view counter go up when he drops something new
18:18 why do they let people out like this? When it comes to a serious crime like that I'm not sure if they should be let out. Kind of crazy
IMO Anyone that takes a life like Randall did should lose theirs , going to jail & then  letting them back out is a mistake
I think the "food" that was running out for Randy was the people whose belongings were found in his tent.  Was dna testing done for missing persons?   Creepy....      Sometimes, I get shivers thinking about how I used to spend time outdoors by myself in isolated areas...
Has anyone else noticed that The month of MAY almost always ends up in his stories? Leave a reply
thanks for the re-post
I first heard this story on That Chapter, and though I love both of your channels equally... I feel that your telling of this story was better :)
Say her name: Willow Grace Clare
The more I listened, the more I wondered if Ricky was the bad guy.  He really had some demons.
The like button comment was relatable since I am moving soon because of my horrible neighbours...
You replied to me on a TikTok live comment months ago! I’ll never forget. Your ballen mr ballen 💯 great content!
Yoo dat Randall is crazy😅
ok, quite the turn around, but what about the dog? ??
I love creepy camping story so much
From watching an interview with Scott and Shaun, it didn't happen like is portrayed in this video. They were sat around the campfire, Smith got up with shaun and scott sat down and said to his dog "come on boy lets go" and with both still sat down he shot shaun, immediately turned the gun and shot scott twice and turned the gun on shaun again, then left. Scott hid behind a bush no more than 15 ft away and then walked through the trees to the road where shaun picked him up.
I USE NORD VPN  BECAUSE OF YOU!! 🤘
the guy on the ID card in the thumbnail looks like Javier's character from No Country For Old Men
My fave story is still the sitting tree ❤❤❤
18:18 What the hell
This is an old video why did you re upload it?
Geat content, Mr Ballen.  Outstanding story telling.        😎🐢🌽🌲🇺🇸🌎
Please bring back spooky paranormal stories
I love ya John but I’m not committing arson for you. LOL
Always bring a gun when hiking or camping.
This story is a true horror movie
SO GLAD SEAN AND SCOTT SURVIVED THIS ORDEAL 👏 😊 BECKY 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 XX
Run Fool is amazing — the writing is exceptional
Love these first youtuber a got addition watching seen them all 😂
I remember when Ricky played for the dolphins lol jk guys I'm still at the begining
Hey! Love your videos! I love these scary stories, they’re so interesting!!!! Pin?
Your next channel should be “revenge of the like button”
Wait.. I think you've covered this story before. I knew exactly what was gonna happen because I've definitely heard this story, And for some reason I think it may be one of yours from like 3+ years ago? I could totally be thinking of a different channel that covered this story but your voice and description is just so memorable before I ever finished the video.
...but what happened to the dog?
What happened to the dog?
I’ve heard this story before but because Mr Ballen always tells the stories differently than others it sounded like a completely different story at first. Love it!
App a lat chin
Anyone know what became of Randall's bork bork?
WV is part of these famous mountains.
so the police found a birth certificate in a tent in the middle of woods? not saying its impossible just crazy.
Too bad narrator on "run fool" is so unbearable. The stories there seems so interesting, but it's a pain to listen to that guy
Let’s be honest, story form is the best way to get your strange, dark and mysterious! Who’s asking for it any other way? That would be weird.
Hey... What about the dog? It is complicit in the crimes. 😅
Sean knew what wasup... ALWAYS TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS !
This is all we want!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE'S NO SEARCH PARTY FOR THE DOG AND HE'S JUST OUT THERE ALL ALONE AND WE'RE LEFT HERE UPSET IN THE COMMENTS HOPING SOMEONE KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT THE DOG 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
finally, a camping story
Hello from Colorado, I hope everyone is having an amazing day today!!! ❤
I was not too shocked it was the unseemly guy. 😅 I watch too much ID
A suggestion to mr ballen is to retell some of his older story in video format but tell it in in a different way and it will still sound like a new story.
15:40 seems like everyone's trying to bounce from that place
This one had a twist alright - I thought a different person was driving that Jeep that crashed right until the end. Love this channel, love the podcasts 😁😁
U need to watch what u say kids will probably more than likely in America setting fires just watch love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Ballen❤
We want to hear the crazy ridiculous "true story" between you and the like button!
yes 54 is sooooo old.
You are an amazing story teller! thank you for sharing....
I tried to get into the other podcast Run Fool, but I just don’t like the voice of the guy who narrates the stories. I wish that he sounded more like Tom Taylorson or Sean Runnette or even Ray Porter. Then I would totally listen to any stories narrated by those three wonderful gentlemen.
Yay, Sean and Scott!!!!
These ladies live in a remote area, but before she can make heads or tails of the Jeep, police and rescue are there? Damn, they've got some great first responders.
Sorry ?  I saw this already on youtube a long time ago.  Why are you posting it as an "hour ago" ?
Can someone help me fix my teeth 😢
Big daddy ballen!!
Wow i was not expecting that!
LETS GOO! I always look forward to Mr.Ballen uploading. I’ve been religiously binging your podcast since it’s become available on Spotify making sure to hear all the podcast exclusives and re-listening to the YouTube remasters. I’ve watched every so gel one of your videos lmao. I’m a huge fan, keep up the great work man. See you in a week
We need to know what happened to the dog!
My brain is broken. All I can think of while hearing Ricky's name is "when I catch you Ricky" 🥴
Even though, I knew exactly which case he was talking about. MrBallen just has a way with storytelling that made this just as unnerving as the first time I heard it.
Randall chanting had nothing to do with mother nature. He was doing a satanic ritual chant
It's so sad what's been happening on the Appalachian Trail and others. A once beautiful experience as long as you were prepared is now pretty scary.
I sometimes wonder if there’s a person out there who makes it a goal to actually pull off all the pranks you lay out for the like button
Yay! It's another strange, dark and mysterious story👍
You've helped me out so much when either I have nothing to watch, or when I'm working. Just listening to your storytelling helps out so much when I work because it helps kill time so quickly as I'm imagining what's going on in my head. Thank you so much
10K likes in the first hour. Wow!
ballen got me w this plot twist. looooved this one!
Awesome video
NOBODY COMPARES to your storytelling abilities!!!
Feels strange, dark and mysterious being this early. Lemme tell you in story form..
This is the only YouTube channel i tune into religiously! Thank you @MrBallen!
I think it's time for a Mr. Ballen original: The Like Button. A story of friendship and betrayal. 😂
When is the American justice system going to learn that you can’t let killers out of prison. It happens over and over again. They lost their right to freedom when they took a life. Enough already.
I must have missed the part about banjos
I'm an hour late but glad I caught this, I always wait for a new video every week I can't get enough of Mr ballen's stories. 😊😊
I want to see a collab between him and Rotten Mango so much
I love small mouth bass. Great fish!
You should drop your videos every Saturday night
always great stories :)
There's a video of Scott and Sean at the actual camp site, re creating the event for a interview. It's crazy
Mr Ballen needs to learn sign language since he talks with his hands so much! Then the hearing challenged/deaf could enjoy his stories too!
Instantly stop scrolling to watch a new strange dark and mysterious
No offense but did you really write this story because it screams hollywood. In a wierd way. Great storyteller though.
This was definitely a plot twist 👀💯
9:14 I don't know I have heard some weird stuff in the woods near my house. It didn't sound like a human or an animal and I'm not the only person that heard it either. So at least I know I'm not completely crazy. The best way I can explain it it sounded like a Scooby-Doo ghosts. I know it sounds crazy I was with this cab driver that you know kind of gave me rides since I was like a teenager. And she heard it and we were both really freaked out to the point where I had her drive me all the way up to my garage I ran into the house and I grabbed my handgun I came out I said if you're a human I have a gun I have a weapon because they were on my property and if it was an animal I figured this would scare It Off at the time I had two dogs that I really cared about. So I shot four rounds into the ground try not to be irresponsible and I haven't heard it since. So was it a human was it an animal I have no clue. I told my father about it and he told me something even stranger he heard something in the woods that sounded like some type of scream but it was more animalistic. Very strange this is when I was in New Hampshire who knows what's really in the woods
Highly recommend RunFool!
I’ve tried to listen to Run Fool. It’s kinda hard to follow.
Love a Sunday afternoon Ballen tale
We should probably stop letting murderers out on good behavior.
23:27 what are those orange balls over your shoulder?
I'm in uk and tried to buy the missing 411,david polidis books. They wanted over £100 per book! Loved Mr ballen telling those stories!
I wait every single Sunday for another brilliant story telling. You totally deserve over 8m subscribers. Ive been a subscriber since 2019
Blah Blah Blah.. just get to the point will ya 😂
10k likes in an hour for a lazy reupload?
That was “Very Creepy and disturbing camping story”
What about the dog?
This channel has gone downhill fast.
Are you feeling okay?
Dang, sad to see a good channel that has gone to complete crap. You’ve already done this exact case bud. Just because you made it big doesn’t mean you shouldn’t put in any effort. Just sad.
As soon as you hear “ Appalachian Trail”, you know you’re about to hear some scary shit.
What about his dog, Ricky's dog ? Lol
Let’s gooo it’s always a good day when Mr ballen drops a new video
First started listening to you on my drives home from work. I'd literally put my phone in the door handle,it was one that had a bottom and was by my ear kind of, and listen to you tell stories. So glad to see you grow over the years. Keep it man.
MrBallen best friend Seagull Lung - Lungy sure does try to get them into trouble.. LOL.. 👨🐸
This was amazing! Love stories about the Appalachian Trail!❤
When I started this video there were 7k likes. When I ended, there were then 9k. Crazy!
and the mac is back once again!!
I know Ricky he played for the Saints and Dolphins
This dude is hight overrated, before that, lets take a sponsor break. Wave your hand around more, flannel shit, and hat guy
I hope the dog was okay
How the hell do you do a white guy do  double homicide and even get the opportunity to have parole,   but if a black guy have a pound of weed he get life 🤦🏾‍♂️....... Alwayz You the mental Illness as an excuse for them that man was Sane he just evil he knew exactly what he was doing that's a damm shame
(The wind up:) The most shocking thing was a single piece of paper and was a birth certificate and..(The pitch:) the name on birth certificate was... (Ball one:)a name that all police in this area knew and in fact anybody living in or around the Appalachian trail definitely would know know this name and..(The pitch:) the identity of this person the name on the birth certificate was... (Ball two:) 😑 the key to putting all this seemingly disconnected events that had happened on this night. 😫😮‍💨😂 You get it. Wild story. 👍
Important Question… is the dog ok?
Mr. Ballen really is giving us pointers on how to be passive aggressive. 😮
Love the scary camping stories. They are definitely my favorite next to the paranormal stories.❤
7:12 you know I would like this to end on a happy note but that's just not Mr Ballens style.
Shawn, Ricky and Scott started getting me a bit confused 🙈
This was a great story, you’re the best storyteller ever.
Comment
Unsubbing. Bruh, just spamming your other shows and your telling stories getting a lil lackluster
Going by the snippet at the end run fool is completely not something I. Wouldn't be interested in.  The narration I find to be what everybody else is doing outside of mr ballen. What does everyone else think? Do you like the stylized narration voice?
I hate to break it to you, but the beauty of your stories or the reason they are so captivating, is the fact that your stories are real stories.  Run Fool however is just a fictional narrative. I gave it a chance but couldn’t get past the first episode. Love you Mr. Ballen, I mean no disrespect Mr. Barnes, but the Run Fool series might actually gain traction if it just follows the same formula of Mr. Ballen and sticks to non-fiction. This is  just my humble opinion. Keep up the GOOD work.
❤MrBallen❤
@MrBallen  Please add wavywebsurf, Well, I never and Crime Zone to your group.  They are brilliant Youtube channels.
The dog.... what happened to the dog?
Good lord, this video got a hemi? Damn thing running over a thousand vpm...
I'm glad the 2 humans are ok, but what happened to the dog?
I buy popcorn at a movie theatre nearby and come home on a Friday night just to watch Mr Ballen’s weekly upload on my big screen TV in my living room. I save his video til a Friday night when I am off from work the next day and I can treat watching his video like I am planning to visit a movie theatre for a Friday  night  movie. Heck, I don’t even watch movie flicks anymore.
I live in West Virginia. 20 minutes from Harper's Ferry I remember when you did a story about a case here.
Always be weary of people you meet in the great outdoors .
Ballen! ✊ Ballen!! ✊✊ Ballen!! ✊✊✊
maybe you shoulda just stopped after the cave diving stories, its clear you are grasping at straws now
If you swapped it around to the men feeling uncomfortable around ricky the story would be much better.  I just feel lied to not that there was an amzing twist
I know where this is headed! I've heard this story! Wicked way of telling it!
Appreciate your work big dawg!
You're the King of Misdirection, Mr. B. Well done, lad!
Hi
I've been looking to talk with the like button about his extended house insurances 😄 I think he might be interested to talk this😂 time
OHHHHHH-NOOOOOOEES!?..."Hearing BANJOS while Camping" got my ASTUTE attention.... -N'aw I may be highly telepathic n' "Hear Voices" (See: NASWhidbey Electron Warfare Air Wing;)...But @ least I dont have to contend with BANJOS!...;) My fave tale-sharing MIME! (Please do "Trap'd Inna Box;)
I've been watching your channel for a few years now, but, I have not subscribed. 😮😮😮, if in your next vid you say "If you do not like the "like" button do not touch it, i will sub. Lol 😅😅😅😅
Ballen has gotten so big he don’t even gotta try to create a clever title lol
I remember this. This story is in my back yard, Carilion, aka Roanoke memorial hospital , is 10 minutes away.
😲 I thought I'd get this one after almost 4 yrs of listening to Mr Ballen yet I wasn't even close this time .😢  Excellent episode John 👍
The twist !!!
I'm going on a camping trip in a couple of weeks can you please make more camping episodes ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Parole Board definitely dropped the ball on that one...
LONGER VIDEOS ! this cheered me up
Mr. Ballen i love your channel and have been a subscriber for a long time now. Love all your content.
How in the hell do you get parole after a double homicide? 🤦🏾‍♀️ Absolute madness.
I recently injured my eye and cannot watch anything on screens but your stories are always so well told I don’t even need to watch I can just listen. Thanks Mr Ballen!
I hope seagull lung hasnt hopped off. Haven't heard you mention Ole SEAGULLL LUNGGG in weeks!
Really enjoyed this one,great storytelling as always
Seen it on i survived. Knew it when he started the story
think you did this story from the opposite point of view From Scott and Seans side
Dude you are one of the best youtubers ever I mean that
THAT is rapid response. 👀
Mr Ballen you’re the story telling, man 😂❤
Hey, MrBallen?  What happened to the dog?
Every vid is a vibe!!! Content is not suppose to stay the same, cause we would complain about how redundant they are! I love the variety of content, and if you look…he has went back and forth to mysterious and spooky , missing 411, paranormal , extraterrestrial, and etc… keep doing a great job Mr. Ballen
Mr Ballen is such a legend for this
I’ve camped and fished in remote areas of Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina for 40 years. I’d never do this without at least one firearm. That won’t always save you but you’re a sitting suck without it. I’ve encountered people over the years out in the bush that made the hair on my arms and neck stand up. Trust your intuition. Also, i wouldn’t recommend women do this alone or even in groups. A well armed man and a woman are two different things. Human predators exist.
I listen to these playing resident evil games
Crazy how both of the guys survived and are doing well a happy ending I would say.
Hey I’ve been wondering how you get all your information, do you just fill in the blanks or what?
Dude, Rodney Barnes' voice is just as buttery and smooth as Morgan Freeman's frfr ❤
I didn't used to need a chart to follow his stories.
Happy Sunday Mr Ballen... Loved today's story.. And I'm gonna give Run Fool a try.. Sounds great!!
I dont understand giving emotions and thoughts about ricky that you wouldnt know.  This isnt a story its like a movie that has to cause some doubt and confusion to be good.  Stories are great but this one was just adding bs to it because it wasnt that good of a story
This story hands down was very creepy. That said thank you for becoming one of my very very top favorite channels!!!! ❤
I only just started following and bingeing Mr. Ballen's videos/podcast episodes within the past few weeks. Of course I came, and stay, for the incredible story telling...but I can confidently say the Mr. Ballen community is comprised of so many compassionate, empathetic, good people. I think it says a lot of Mr. Ballen himself too that this community is so great. I love reading the comments and love being a part of it :)
Your mispronouncing Appalachian.
I always had my 357 when I went camping in the Appalachians.
I hear banjos 😮
Listening to MrBallen tell stories about the woods is surprising relaxing.
Señor balones ⚽️ 🏈 🏀. .. 🫡🫡🫡
What happened to the poor dog?
23:54 those items are indeed trophies, but they were merely stolen from sleeping campers/hikers along the Appalachian Trail. That guy had been creeping around there for a while
Did any of these people have jobs?
I’ve heard you say , upload 3-4 times a week, 2-3 times a week , 1-2 times a week, now it’s 1 times a week. Lol 😂
I am obsessed with this channel i seriously love it and cant stop watching 😊😊
Oh man, its always such a treat when new Mr Ballen video drops on a Sunday afternoon! I gotta stop whatever I'm doing to watch, every single time. Thanks for great stories all these years!
1:35 no shit I did not know that this went through New Hampshire. shit I didn't even know it was on the East Coast. I don't know how sad that is but yeah geography not my thing
I swear I heard you say this story before.. creepy I don't think it was anyone else I follow either.. so I think only real reason I feel this way is I know the future.. just saying
I love getting here early
Appa-LATCH-in. Apple-AT-cha.
Oh I just started listening but know exactly what this is
Mr Ballen, what's happened to Seagull Lung🐸?! Haven't heard from him in a while. Please give him a high five for me.  🐸I love Seagull Lung updates!🐸
You truly are an artisan Story teller, hands down one of the best.
Achievement unlocked: story time  Watch a MrBallen video within one hour of it being uploaded
Not a real photo of Ricky's fishing line 😂😂😂😂😂
Ugh, stories like these, just make further reinforce my "nope" stance to camping
21:45. Sunday.  3/3.  In bed and ready to listen to Mr Ballen.  Best bed time Story teller.   From South Africa 🇿🇦
Hey MrBallen, if you see this, can you please consider making a story about the unsolved murder mysteries of the haunted Myrtles Plantation? It won’t make me mad if you don’t, but if you do it would make my life! (I love your videos!)
I literally sat up waiting for the name
VA IN THE HOUSE!!!!
What happened to the dog?
VA IN THE HOUSE!!!!
I'm a big fan of Mr. Ballen and if I've learnt one thing from the hours I've listened too is never go camping.
Nice more happiness been a while
Wasn't this on "I survived?"
0:21 how do you keep on coming up with new ways to torture the like button. That poor poor like button LOL
👌
But but but what happened to Randall’s dog?
What a great surprise, came on here to watch a Walking Dead discussion video and you had yours up early! Wooo
i was wondering why you weee doing this frail old weak guy so much heat while telling the story then it made sense 😝
Don’t let a man like that out of jail!
I wonder what happened to the dog.. 🙃
I'm glad Sean and Scott survived but what happened to the dog? I hope it was rescued.
I don’t know what it is about Mr.ballen but it’s weird when all these adults come into the comment section acting like little kids
I've come to look forward to Mr. Ballen's stories to start the week off right and with a bang.
This is 2hrs earlier than usual, and I'm okay with that 😂
Yo @mrballen you put this one together masterfully!!! That twist was crazyyyy
How in the world did this guy get out of prison after a double homicide?! What a shame that the most predators to watch our for in the wild are fellow humans
Can’t believe I subscribed when you were at 40k. So proud of you & your family! Deserving of all the best successes in life!
Love Mr Ballen stories. Just catching up on his podcasts. So excited to binge the stories like I did when I discovered this channel. He's the best! ❤
I swear I've heard this story before
*Not a real photo of Ricky's fishing line* .... still the same ol' Mr.Ballen, Love it!!
Love u dawg. Thanks for makin every single Sunday special😊
Yes more 411 plz.
you the best👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
At this point, I kinda wanna be friends with the like button 😅
My parents had a couple of friends who they worked with, who were killed on the Appalachian trail in 1981, iirc, and they were the two that this guy killed first.
I just wanted to say that I'm enjoying watching this episode from jail after I was arrested due to pouring "I hate you" with gas over my neighbour's lawn and lighting it on fire .. lol jk.. Another great story! Thanks for the content :)
I'm shocked to hear that Sean and Scott are still going to the Dismal Creek after all that. I could never. Brave men! Awesome job Mr. Ballen!!
He was released because of his good behaviour 🤦‍♀️ he sounded absolutely psychotic, I’m so glad Scott and Sean survived.
I didn't expect that Plot twist💀
Unreal!!!!! I love the way you told the story, but holy crap. These guys are practically superheroes. I wish them peace.🌺
Rodneys voice is so soothing. The only sad part about finding run fool is that I couldnt really binge bc of how new it is!
😮😮😮Oh, okay, yeah, I already heard this story on another channel.
ONCE A WEEK IS NOT ENOUGH!!!
15 years for double homicide? Huh
Excellent upload!!! I love a great story with a twist at the end!!!!
You already told this story
Mr ballen is a good story teller
Insane twist
I find myself spending hours listening to the countless stories while cleaning. Thank you for making sundays easier
I just saw a post about a Florida man who kidnapped a scientist so he could make his dog immortal.   I just didn't have the strength to know that alone.
Always nice to hear a new one!
Dang that story took a turn! It ended up the complete opposite of what I thought was about to happen. Incredible! So happy to know Sean & Scott recovered and are still enjoying their camping trips. May they live long & happy lives.
Great as always!!! 👍🏼😎
i prefer to listen to people that don't come from the ghetto
I will never understand people who go into places like this without a firearm.
The spoken boom, got me 😂 I physically jumped
Watched you from the beginning on tikotk in lockdown your videos are literally amazing plz keep it up 🫶🏻
I smell a Like button rebellion in the near future.
You probably shouldn’t advocate setting fire to something there are so many dumbasses out there that’ll try it.
Early, Love your videos Mr Ballen. Sending lots of love from Aussie ❤
its too bad Randall's crazy it seems like he could be a nice man
I knew this story about 2 mins after you started, I have seen it on a few other channels, but you did a great job telling it.
37 min 42k views. Crazy
You can get paroled after 15 years despite a crime like that??? You’d get the firing squad in China 🇨🇳.
I love his stories i just started watching them. But im so caught up now im doing the waiting game for a new video.. he needs to do more videos a week like 2 more so 3 a week lol
❤❤🙏🏼🙏🏼
Got to stop these other channels stealing your podcast material.   I hate when others making money off of other people.
Me and my friend were out on the Appalachian Trail camping at the time when Randall was out there.. I'm really glad we managed to avoid him and he didn't discover us.😬
Love your stories MrBallen
Stay strapped and stay aware.
So why would ricky be afraid bc of the murders early on
glad im kindive early. i  sall the video 34 minutes after it was posted im all ''burnt out rn.'' so im just listening too this while i try to get comfortable and probably go to sleep.
Just what I need on this gorgeous Sunday afternoon here in Western Mass!! 60°F out and loving it!! Gonna sunbathe and get lost in the story.
Dude you’ve already told this story.
Sundays are renamed Ballen day in my house.  The kids and I just got done cleaning and as per usual before I leave for work, we chill out, eat dinner and watch your stories ❤🇧🇸
Been following you since you only had a few hundred k subs. It's been fun watching you grow
I will go with a group to the mountains, or atleast have another person with me, I have read an article about serial killers, using the mountains as their hunting grounds. You never know what you will come across in the woods.  If you come across people deep in the woods, you have to be very careful. I open carry a firearm when I camp or hike. My friends and I have experienced crazy people, at night time at our campground.
This is mysterious and spooky...
Glad they recovered and survived
I love this story!!!! Thank you!!!!!
it was his hunting ground. Most likely the circles on the map were murder spots.
RUN FOOL IS AMAZING
I THOROUGHLY enjoyed this! 😁 One of my favorites I’ve seen thus far 💕
This is the 2nd story Mr.Ballen has done about someone named Ricky Williams. Such an unlucky name!
I love that moment when I realize “Oh dang! I know this story!”, but MrBallen’s narrative is still entertaining.
Omg yes!!! I am so saving this video to watch before bed tonight! Thank you for the vid!
I thought i watched this story already but clearly not if it was posted 33 minutes ago . 🧐🧐🙂🙂
I just followed the "Run, Fool" podcast after listening to about 8 minutes of "The Monster of Chesapeake Bay". Thanks, Mr. Ballen!
Watch these when you’re hunting. Then you half to walk in the dark alone. You don’t know how chilling it is.👌you feel like everything is watching you. You turn around in the dark  to look behind you. And then the coyotes start yipping and howling. And you know that when they don that they are getting something apart. Have fun next time you go into the woods.✌️
I swear I forget about MrB all week and every time I see it pop up on Sunday, which happens to be the only day I get a little me time away from the family, but it’s a nice little surprise every time lol. It also makes me realize how shit my memory is.   Edit: this was an episode of “I  Survived”, but I really like your setup and angle to the story. Good stuff man.
taking a break from studying for midterms, thank you for the great videos.
Run, Fool! Is a really good show ballen aint lyin
What a pleasant surprise ha, I forgot it was Sunday 👏👏👏
I knew that plot twist was coming, absolutely love your videos brother! 🫡👊🏾
Just curious, anyone ever found out how to get to Bell's Canyon?
I'm not gonna lie. I'm kind of grateful he didn't do the lungy skit! I have followed mr. B for years now and lungy is my only complaint lol.
My favorite part of the day is story time

Love the true crime stuff waaaay more than the fake ghost stories. Keep up the good work Mr Ballen!
Hey Mr Ballen, please do a story on Rehmeyer's Hollow in PA, it's a very interesting tale and popular lore of PA.

I love your content, but my grandma would be screaming at this episode.  Appalachia is pronounced "apple-at-cha", or as she says "If you say it wrong again imma throws this apple atcha!!!!!"  Appalachian Trail is the the Apple-atch-en trail haha.
Very good story! Thanks Ballen!!
I miss when Ballen hid a secret in every video

That’s is so crazy (literally) I can’t believe he was still out there for this long just waiting for the right ppl to pray on. 😮😢
For every like i will do absolutely nothing and after 1k likes i will write a cringy edit saying hey mom im famous
Never trust your eyes,” says the magician. And rightly so. Our eyes are easily fooled every day by what we perceive on the Hollywood screen: pictures of immortality and blissful innocence. Do you know who John Wayne is? Famous movie star from California, played in 127 movies, mainly cowboy movies. Often called “the Duke.” The Duke was no stranger to death on screen. He often went out in a blaze of glory. But how many of you know how John Wayne really died? As he lay confined to a hospital bed dying of cancer, he called for a preacher to come to his bedside and pray for him… because he was afraid of death! Now many of you like the Hollywood jock would say “Ha! I’m not afraid of death!” That’s the Hollywood you. I want to talk to the real you, the you that says, “Oh! I don’t want to die!” Because if there’s one chance in a million that “Jesus Christ has abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,” then you owe it to your good sense, and your loved ones to look into it. Either it’s true or it isn’t, either death has been destroyed or it hasn’t. I’m asking you. Why? Because I think you’re in mortal danger? But I have a problem… I’m guessing you don’t believe it. I think your life is on the line. If I can convince you that you’re in danger, I’m doing you a huge favor. Let’s wind back the clocks, if I went back to 1912, the time was 11:00 and you were a passenger on the titanic. I would tell you that you have 2 appointments to keep this very night, one with death, the other with this cold hard thing called Gods justice. No doubt you think you’re a good person and need no repentance. Well let’s just put that to the test, how many lies have you told in your whole life? What do you call someone who tells lies? Come on you can do it… a liar. 😊 have you ever in your whole life taken anything that belongs to someone else? If so then you’re a lying thief. If you still think you’re a good person just listen to this: have you ever used Gods name or the name of Jesus to cuss? Would you use your mother’s name as a cuss word? Most people wouldn’t because that would be extremely dishonoring. Yet you’ve taken the holy name of God who gave you a mother and gave you life, lavished His kindness on you, gave you eyes to see with, ears to enjoy good music, taste buds to enjoy good food, love and laughter, friends and family, and used as a filth word to express disgust. Here’s the one that nailed me: Jesus said “whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery in his heart.” Have you ever looked with lust? Have you ever hated someone? The Bible says “he who hates his brother is a murderer.”  If you answered yes to all those questions then God sees you as a lying thieving blasphemous murderous adulterate heart, and you have to face Him on judgement day whether you believe in Him or not, if He judges you by that standard then you’d be guilty and end up in hell. But here’s the gospel: God is rich in mercy and provided a way for you to be forgiven. The 10 commandments are called the “moral law,” You and I broke the law, Jesus paid the fine. Then He rose from the dead defeating death. Repent (confess and forsake your sins) and trust in Jesus, He took your punishment on that cross so you can walk out of the courtroom on judgement day, and God will give you eternal life as a free gift. Don’t trust in your own goodness because the Bible says you haven’t got any, you’re just like the rest of us. You’re like the first class man on the Titanic, it strikes the iceberg and this is his plan, he’s going to try to bribe the officer to let him on the life boat with his money. Don’t do that… just humble yourself as a little child, and trust in the Savior and you’ll get free passage to eternal life. Make sense? Or, like the radio operator who was warned about the icebergs, are you saying “Shut up?”
Highlight of my Entire week, esp when I get notified at work 😂 I Soooo look forward to coming home!! 😊 Best story delivery Every Time, Ballen is Amazing!!!
Can we get more "3 places you cant go and people who went there anyway" videoes? I really miss those
I just watched this story on I Survived, i think it was..  crazy story.
@MrBallen LETS MAKE A DEAL!!! Start giving us TWO videos a week and I’ll make sure the “Like Button” never hurts you again! Watching you tell the story just hit differently my man!
Wow that a story madness of this man…
Time to fold some laundry and listen to Mr. B!!! Thank you!
It is 23:27 Sunday in Azerbaijan,Baku😊 I have been waiting for this moment 😍Finally it is out
This is now officially a true crime channel.
Pro Tip - Rather using flaming gasoline... just use liquid fertilizer to spell stuff on someone else's lawn.  (One can also use "once a year path weeder" for a similar effect.)
First.
😢😢😢So, why would an older frail man go hiking alone? Kind of stupid.
I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Not sure if I’ll ever go camping again.
30k in 30 minutes is crazy 😂
Looks like Scott. Had nerve damage.  But at least he has his life.
Yessss its Ballen storytime w0ot woOT 🤪
⭐What an AWESOME story. Gracias.💕
Love your ability to keep me on the edge of my seat while listening to your stories. A true gift. ❤
Much love all the way from Zimbabwe, Southern Africa. Love these type of stories, in the woods or cabins. Keep doing what you do so well Mr Ballen. You are the best👏
Love me some Ballen😂❤
WE NEED MORE MISSING 411 STORIES MR BALLEN DONT SWITCH UP ON US. PLEASE.
I can't finish the video, I'm afraid the dog is gonna die and I can't listen to that. Can somebody tell me whether the dog dies or not so I can finish the video?
why do people keep going on this trail, this is about the 6th story i have heard about this trail
i dont need my dad to tell me stories anymore
I literaly have the worst insomnia and take medication to try and help me sleep. Yet somehow Ballen's stories help me sleep better than ANY medication ❤
Who else gets excited when they see a new upload by Mr. Ballen? 😂🥳
My favorite part of Sundays, a mrballen video on my day off
Hey Mr.Ballen, thank you for the upload 🙏
I have been needing an escape this morning. Woke up super anxious and this really helps distract me for a while ❤
country music really is terrible. poor ricky
What about the dog? What happened to Ricky’s dog?
Classic Ballen right here....great video!
curious dark sent me here. i'm glad.
Mr Ballen Great story  once again...!!
42 more episodes this year 😍😄❤️
You actually meant Western Virginia and not West Virginia... That's awesome. You're awesome.
MrBallen is the reason I watch horror stories like this one.
I’d like to hear about The Black Donallys
I’d love to start finding the secrets in today’s episode again 🙏🏼
Total crap
It's Ballen Sunday!!
I stand by my statement that Mr. Ballen is the ONLY one we can trust to be our president.
always been tuning in to your stories since 2022 and I have always been entertained by them thank you !
I love listening to Mr ballen with my father. He is called the story man by my dad. We listen almost every day
I was religiously watching Run, Fool. And then it evaporated from YouTube. That was a dagger. 😊❤
Wow, now that was a disturbing encounter that I’ve ever heard
Mr Ballen is the only one who cured my alcoholism. Whenever I can't sleep or feel stressed, instead of going to a fridge full of beer and wine, now I lay down in bed, and let this man tell me a story so this old man can relax, visualize, and drift of to sleep naturally without alcohol.  😴
YES Mr. Mr Ballen I AM a fan of the strange, dark, and mysterious delivered in pdf format! Just kidding. Love all your videos. Consider returning hidden object in your videos?😊
Spelling anything legible on a lawn in gasoline is much more difficult than it sounds. I will not be elaborating.
Just passing ur peak. Get all u can now.
Never camp or hike unarmed.
Is the like button fuckable?
To the King Of Storytelling, THANK YOU so much king 👑! Stay blessed and take care brother
INTRODUCING THE REIGNING DEFENDING UNDISPUTED HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE STRANGE DARK AND MYSTERIOUS DELIVERED IN STORY FORMAT MR BAAAAAAAALENNN!!!
I have hit myself in the face with a soccer ball and broke my wrist.  I’m I need an hour. I’m call my mom. I might need to go home.
Thanks for making Sundays a thing to look forward to MrBallen!
I don't believe you would ever say write with gas on the lawn light it up says I hate my neighbor's 🤬
Barely 21 minutes since release and already over 3.2 thousand likes! Whoot! Hugs from Esquimalt
It's already 3 am in PH but I'm glad I've waited for mrballen to upload.
Be careful, Mr Ballen... I hear the like-button is planning to sue for relentless harassment!! 😂😂😂
Yesss, I’ve been waitin all week! I’m so excited to watch this lol.. love ya Mr B and please keep the videos comin ❤️
Love your videos man.. stay safe brother🥰🥰
John,  it blows my mind that you have only uploaded this video 17 minutes ago but you have 2.6K likes and over 20K views.  Thats insane. I am now going to do what 20K+ people have already done and listen while I wait for the sun to rise here in country NSW Australia. Thank you John for your efforts and they are VERY much appreciated. Take care now.
Please Mr.B stop your "Jokes" at the beginning of the Video. They are more scary than the actual story. Love ya
Thank you Mr. Ballen ❤. Listening before I go to work 😊
Ballen Sundays usually come on Mondays in Australia, its 6am Monday here I stayed up all night for this!🎉 well worth it. Mr Ballen has ALWAYS been a man of his word, long before I discovered him a few years back. What Dave Chappelle is to stand-up, this guy is to storytelling (GOAT)
idK ?! I kinda dig Disturbing  Darkness in Storied ForMat  does that maKe me Disturbed ?!  *(Please Do Not Disturb)* -is the DoorKnob Tag  I Hang from my Hotel DoorKnob
Best thing all week!
You look soooo good in red ❤
Woah 😮
I love the camping story’s
When you hear a banjo, you best ran jo ass outta there.
I'm real curious to know what the like button did to Mr. Ballen 😂😂
I hear banjos
When you turn your Master Audio to Mono and listen to just the left speaker output, you can hear noise, not so on the right speaker.
Finally!!!! Old school camping horror story
The Apple Vision Trail?  []-)
Thank you, John ❤
It made me laugh out loud when you had to put the disclaimer, "not a real photo of Ricky's fishing line"😂
❤❤❤❤
No stop edits and cuts. Unwatchable. Unfortunate because the content is good.
Be careful around Panther falls on the Appalachian Trail Google Chad Austin you'll know why
BEST STORY TELLER ONLINE 🎉🎉🎉 MR. BALLEN 🎉🎉🎉
Mrballen please collab with Mr. E Files  youtube.com/@mrefiles 🙏 You inspired him!
Am I the only one who feels like I am a "chosen one" everytime I catch the vidéo of MrBallen just few minutes after being posted?
I never knew you posted this early. I always watch you and scary interesting every Sunday night.
We have devolved from harassing the like button to blatantly committing arson.  This is starting to scare me.
My bank could say I got a deposit for $500, but this would STILL be the best notification on my phone!
Yesssss Sunday ❤️
Yes!!!  My favorite time on YouTube each week hands down!
Didn't expect a navy seal to upload a video before the usual time
The camping ones are the best 👻
I just watched They called him mostly harmless on MAX it was about a hiker that hiked the Appalachian trail and that was one crazy story.
Playing in the background while I draw ❤
She drank beer and she was very drunk.  My dad was we are leaving.
Meanwhile I'm over here pissed at Ricky for taking his dog camping without enough food for them.
I h8 my neighbors my neighbors are h8ers
Oh.. I recognize those names...
Immediately recognise the ID photo it's"Lyin" Randall Lee Smith the Appalachian Trail Killer
"I hear banjos..."  THE HORROR 😂
Drop everything..... a new Ballen video just went up!!! 🥳🥳
Cannae spell;
We love you, Ballen!
Looooove uuuuu John!!!!!
Ah another great video.
Nice one, bruv!
Dude that (what I saw in my room still haunts me) traumatized me. Thank u.
Yo! 👋🏾😃
Still remember when you had 3,000 followers 🥲
Love Sundays strictly for MrBallen storytime. ❤
❤❤🎉❤❤
279th    3:14am Philippine  🎉  TIME MARCH  04   2024 Thanks for your  story  ❤
Bro, we have done so many bad things to the poor like button😭😭😭
I sure as hell hope nothing happens the dog!!!
❤Thank you Mr.Ballen❤
Holy Molly I'm early finally Hi Mr.ballen
the first video i ever watched of this guy was the Russian Sleep Experiment. I watched it at like 11 at night and couldn’t sleep for another hour. Here i am around a year or 2 later watching basically every one of his videos and listening to his podcast
Tremedous Talesman
Love your content!  And thank you for your service!
Extremely weird camping story?  My dad was get into the car. That’s a Grizzly Bear and she she’s extremely angry.
Yay my favorite genre of storytelling the Mr Ballen does!! ❤🎉
I love how specific the captions on the images are, they crack me up. “Real photo of different trout”
Yay! New stuff Sunday!!!!!!!!!!1111oneone
Its almost 1am in India, staying awake for MrBallen's new story 😊😊
I’m so glad MrBallen is starting to do more of the mysterious scary stories he used to do. Good ol’ bump in the night horror stories hit different
I FUCKING LOVE YOU!
That would a been my cue to run the second that Scott put on loud country music especially after getting all those bad vibes! Over the years trusting my gut instinct has saved me an innumerable amount of times and most horror stories show victims ignoring their gut instinct.
10 minutes, 10k views. That's wild!
MrBallen, Nick Crowley and Lazy Masquerade in the same weekend 🥳
Perfect for car rides
theres my brother
Do you want to interview a researcher who just completed her 2nd investigation of the Dyatlov Pass location?
1k views a minute! My hat is off to you sir. (10 minutes after going live) *edit* This is the best retelling of this story I've been privy to.
❤❤❤❤
This is just what I needed today! I've been looking for inspiration to continue writing my novel series, and this is gonna do it! Thank you MrBallen for posting this amazing content and keeping us thrilled with this strange dark and mysterious story :D
Mr Ballen, it’s the one person that can take my mind completely off the sadness around me lately. Appreciate you much.
257th comment
Genuinely one of the best storytellers on YouTube, you have improved so many peoples lives be it from your service in the Seal Teams, your charity work, or even just posting enjoyable videos on the internet, so for all of that, thank you.
Camping stories are the best. People need to always carry a gun especially in the woods.
Love MrBallen. Thank yu
I LOVE THE LONG ONES!
For every like this comment gets I'll do zero pushups💀
Ok, when the title of the video is that straightforward, you know it’s true.
Whose been a long time subscriber 🙋‍♂️. I listen to this guy at work all day
I’ve been going down nostalgia lane and rewatching Hannah Montana recently on Disney+ and noticed MrBallen looks just like Billy Ray Cyrus on that show.
the absolute shade thrown at the like button is my absolute favorite ballen specific way to introduce every new video lol
Early!! Found you a month back and have binged all your YouTube videos and podcasts 😅 you're so good at telling story's, the small details you add about the victims and other people really paint a vivid picture, keep it up 😁
I feel like if I was in the middle of nowhere in a bad situation I probably would be way more creeped out if I actually did randomly bump into someone.
I love listening to these strange, dark and mysterious stories on Sundays while cleaning the house 😅
Do you plan on telling any more combat orientated stories in the future?
...someone else knows how to get to Bell's Canyon?
If you could I think it would be great if you could make a top 3 places you cant go, or a last messages video again. Its been so long. 😢
YAAAA MR B UPLOADED  Always makes my Sundays great
Now my Sunday is complete, a story from the like button 👍🏿 hating Mr. Ballen 😂
We gotta thank MrBallen for climbing all the way up Bell's Canyon and finding this little shed and telling the story
The "Like" button is in therapy.
Heh my gut feeling of wanting to watch the strange dark and mysterious got me a brand new episode-score🎉
i’m early what’s up strange dark and mysterious gang 🫱🏼‍🫲🏾
I hope the Like Button is being compensated appropriately for all of this torment!
The fact that these videos are absolutely terrifying but I still consider it my comfort show 😂😂
I've been refreshing all morning for this. Thank you!
The Like button has experienced a lot of trauma😢😢😢😢
Start animated videos love your stuff
Great story keep them coming.
Mom wake up, Mr Ballen just dropped another banger!
Awesome story teller, former navy SEAL and best advice on how to be a dick to the like button. Best channel on YouTube!
Love your stories ,way to start my week,thank you
Wow
its fake news
I have to leave for work, and my train ride is always about 27 minutes long. MrBallen is just the best!
I feel illegal here, knowing that I’m early and vibin while watching the amazing video. I haven’t finished it yet but it’s really good.
Great content as always keep that up.  When the like button is asleep, put a rubber chicken on the like button's car exhaust before he goes to work.
Thank you for all your stories Mr. Ballen! I’m very proud of how far you’ve come. I hope the nostalgia stays❤ 👍🔨
Did I wait til 3am for Mr. Ballen’s vid? Mayyybe 👀 now I shall slumber peacefully 🥰
Is it not crazy how many loyal fans that literally have cravings for Mr Ballens stories like a bunch of addicts? It's only been 3 min since he posted this and already has dozens of comments. ♥️ Love your work Mr.Ballen!! You truly are one of a kind!!
poor like button, it's always...🎉ABUSED🎉
Thanks, Mr. Ballen, I still look forward to every Sunday to listen to your strange, dark, and mysterious stories.  Don't ever change, brother.
Whoa now
Yaya finally I made it first thing
love listening to a  good ole mrballen story
Time for a nap with Mr Ballen😅
Woot Woot🐸🐸
Amazing like alwase 🙌🙌
I love ur content keep up the good work my brotha
The like button will really need to be sealed in a titanium box with no way in or out. 🤣
I've never been this early to a video. I look forward to my Sunday laundry videos! Strange dark and mysterious is always my favorite!
Amazing video once again!! Never fails to amaze me. My first thought when I woke up this morning was your video.
❤❤
🎉
IM STILL ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT AS I TYPE THIS OMG
Here we go baby!! Been waiting all week for this!!!
Holy hell, 1000 likes in 5 minutes. Must be nice to be this good at YT.
I'm seeking better help counseling for the trauma the Like button has endured over the years
Dismal Creek! That's my neck of the woods!
Great story!
Been waiting on this all morning🎉😊
First Mr. Ballen vid I've gotten to watch hot of the of the press in long time.
You are seriously such a great story teller. I struggle with my short attention span but the way you deliver these stories keeps me engaged. You do a great job painting am image.
Just teasing the like button
Mr. Ballen if you read these, can you more war stories again?
I love MrBallen, I wish he uploaded more than once a week though. I miss getting a notification almost daily about a new video! But I’m just glad he’s still actually uploading on a pretty consistent schedule and not like once a month like some YouTubers. Thank you MrBallen!! 🎉 Also, side note: I’m going camping for 2 nights in Allegheny National Forest this week so you know I’m bringing my gun and extra ammo cuz I am NOT gonna be in one of these videos 😂😂
It was once said that if MrBallen was to ever go missing, it would be because of the Like button😂
Early! Yay!
love u 💛
Being this early is wild. Watching the comments likes and views going up in real time is weird 😂
Yay! Perfect timing ❤ feels spooky here in Minnesota today.

Hey MrB. The 'AEST' time is 6am, not 5am. There is a time zone converter available online to ensure the correct time is posted. The Australian time has been incorrect since Oct last year. ❤❤🦘🦘
Am I the only one why found one video from this guy and got hooked on his videos like a junkie???😂
Nice
Perfect timing! Just finished the why files …
