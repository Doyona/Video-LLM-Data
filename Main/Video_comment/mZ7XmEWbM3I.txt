BRO I JUST REALIZED... RILEY IS A GENIUS.... Riley was not only able to discern what Amanda wanted but she also figured out that the tapes held clues on how to find Sam Colton and his kid and by the second game, she figures out that this is a whole top secret operation being conducted by an actual research group AND the churches involved... I agree about subtle messaging in kid's shows and somehow feel like this game is based off of REAL shows that try violating the sanctity of the psychosphere...   Psychosphere is a location in the human frame of mind where all thoughts and mindsets reside.   In SCP-5000, there is a creature in the "psychosphere" that threatens to destroy humanity if ANYONE expresses any emotions. The creature is so strong that the 05 Council had to literally create countermeasures that involved destroying humanity. As in, whatever was in the human psychosphere, it was capable of FAR worse than d3ath so much so that the 05 Council performed a merciful duty and unalived humanity.   SCP-5000 was a suit meant to protect the wearer from being located within the psychosphere along with being able to hide the wearer from physical amd mental threats whilst documenting anomalies far beyond the strength of "GODS". In other words, legend says that SCP - 5000 was an advanced A.I. capable to transporting itself AND its wearer to different realities where the Foundation decided that the only best way to cataloging SCP - 5000 was to keep in locked in a facility where it randomly appears in. It is self-contained and does not pose a threat to anyone.   Reason for all of that is because Amanda the Adventurer seemingly is able to brainwash kids into liking the show by tapping into the collective psychosphere and planting sick and twisted things in the form of this "innocent" and "innocuous" kids show. And forcing them to summon Hell's generals to trap the souls of kids...
I love how well they did the early 2000s bad acting of a kids show, they clearly know what they're doing but they make it so good in the coffee break segment
The quick AH! 18:20 😂😂
49:32 New Super Mario Brain Cancer 64
like button glows when he says "please,like"  in *6:27*
17:40 the barn was on zaza
Amanda The Rizzler
There is no 6th tape btw
Rest in peace, Wooly & Blabbot
You don't want to help wooly he's secretly the evil one
You literally got the updated version of the candy store thing   to fast that you dont understand what is happening
35:36 Wtf
The Change In Her Voice 43:21
35:36 bros demented
popy playtime chapter 3 :
I heard that the only way to get the 6th tape is by entering the game files and giving your self the tape. hope that was helpful😊
Sam might be Wooly
48:05 In this VHS, Rebecca was actually saying the names of three demons, if you didn't know that
Hello
7:45 Look At Ryan cheer The Sheep And Sheep CAN HEAR HIM, Trust Me And U Know What I'm Mean 💀💀💀🤘🤘
If only ryan waited long enough to hear blabbots pleads They’re fun
Am I the only one who likes the voice for 25:28
18:22  and 21:50 Ryan’s face is class reaction 😂😂
46:54 Wooly was scared there! 😢
44:36 Wait... What's that?😮
who ever that guy is was he Sam Colton?😶
this is just a personal theoretical question from me, what if all those colorful tapes resembles the notes color in piano?
So there's nothing to save wooley. Poor sheep
The cake is a lie.
Okay so, the director in the purple tape was basically forcing Rebecca into summoning demons from the Ars Goetia (baa lamb- balam, pie man- paimon, bye yell- bael) and from a comment i saw under another youtuber’s video about this game another person said that Rebecca isn’t talking about a man with headphones, but to a demon, so the ‘headphones’ represent horns. I also saw someone say that Rebecca/Amanda has the ability to communicate with/summon those demons, which the directors are taking advantage of.
Not for nothing but what if the tape of Rebecca signing the contract was backwards and the guy we see standing guard isn't guarding another room but the room she went in to sign the contract to make sure she didn't run out
I played the demo, but this is nothing compared tot the full game! And honestly, Amanda the adventurer kind of reminds me of DDLC.
Someone give him his cookies
7:00 , 8:37 & 43:24 Oh... I think Rebecca is trying to break free and ask us for help here! 😧
If anyone noticed,when Amanda said "I'm out there... somwhere"it actually links to when she said "Sometimes I feel rotting but it feels far away though" so that probably means Amanda/Rebecca is dying or rotting.                      Also before this version of the game came out(which was a demo)there was a part in one of the tapes,that had a location so maybe Amanda/Rebecca is there
Dont worry bro, my hand writing is shit lol
Jorden from the start of the game is wooly
When Ryan went to the picnic and meat spawned what If the meat was in the food and that was rotting and in the last one what I’d wooly was the lost brother and Amanda knew what happened to him that’s why the bakery turned into the meat play for a split second
35:03 THE CAKE IS A LIE!!!!!
Guys... Can anyone help me ASAP... When I pause the "in the neighborhood" tape at the part where there is a song.. Then I play facade on the music thingie... I get the orange tape instead of the turquoise? Did I do sm wrong? is there an explanation to this?
That ??? Thing is a joke becouse you "forgot" who your suppose to send the card to
Amanda, Wood, Ramos and Rebeca
My theory:  So I feel like dora is somehow related to this Amanda. Dora is also scary and there are many lores about it. In the next game, it’s gonna be like a fight. Amanda and Dora vs Us and that guy. When we broke the tv, it was like Amanda was trying to say “ HELP! They trapped me!” Like she is a victim! We could be the next Amanda or it could be a dream…? I also feel like Sam is wooly. Like he is also trying to get out. And if we don’t answer the “who’s birthday is it?” We would get this secret tape and figure out everything. The guy in the mask might be Sam or the “director” trying to take us too. So many lores. But let me know what you think?
I think the man who came into the attic after you smashed the TV was Sam himself. I believe that Hamln somehow summoned a demon to absorb Sam into the show first, and that's how Hamln were able to get full custody of Rebecca, and then they offered her to be the Demon's new puppet to convince kids to keep watching the show until they too got sucked in as the Demon's victims.
Hey Ryan hate to break it to you but Amanda killed Wooly
This entire game is a gaint cry for help from Amanda. I dont trust wooly at all.
27:26 yes canceled
18:20 I am in tears right now, and I don't know why.
Ryan, the "codes" on the paper with the names being colors, they are Alchemical Symbols.
17:40 that house looks boxed Lmao
The fact that this dude can piece everything together and how he can solve clues is really impressive this dude is a genuine genius
Type in sam if amanda says what the daddy chicken is called
Idk why but it felt like he already knew the game
Was that Sam or Hamlit Company?
I swear, mint, was the code for the red box at some point.
What I was thinking, the secret ending has to do with help Amanda when she doing her “surgery” on Wooly. From what I’ve seen from other YouTuber everyone helps out wooly but not Amanda that probably why no one has found the sixth missing secret tape. I do think there is a sixth colored tape but no one has deep dive into looking for another alternative ending because different choice in each of the tape leads to a different ending. Just a thought!
I heard that in the zoo episode if you write police/polices in every answer wooly and amanda will get scared
To find the last tape you have to match the flower on the doll
first video where i saw the 'hat' ending
It got so cryptic at the last tapes
When Ryan dunked the water on the little robot, I managed to get this:  *"WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIFE TOGETHER, PLEASE DO NOT FORGET ME-"*
WAIT in the tape that gives you “CBF” you get cookies for your “friend “ and you send them the Kate and in the coffee break tape we hear SAM talking  about cookies Kate and rebecca / amanda . Coincidence I think not
Honestly I really hope that the developers of this game make either a dlc or a straight up sequel because like you said this game has so much potential
18:21 💀😂
I think Amanda uses the lonely kitten as a metaphor for herself And that's why she's so upset when you say you won't help
time stamps tho?
Dora is Amandas
35:04 - The cake is a lie!
RYANNN YOU SPELLED WOOLY WRONG POOR GUY
The Thurston Tree Forton in can you Serct hide seek in family  card Police is FBI  peep in spy in are look  Tubes provided hours of fun as we explored giant tunnels left by the volcano. And no visit is complete without a visit to the famous Kilauea Volcano National Park where kids and adults can visit the interactive museum, Discovery Center and circle tour. You can even experience incredible views of the sulfur spewing crater (a bit strong smelling) and enjoy hikes, tours or visit the restaurants and gift stores. The think Family Adventurer it an Family Adventurer, Kilauea, Volcano, family he cool  National Park where kids and adults are in [REACTED] cool in are put Devil you in floor seek in watch in
Every video he makes is exciting and funny.
35:36 pause it at this moment
I don’t know if anyone else saw this but at the part where you don’t help the kitten, you can see wooly’s suit disappear and then a human
NAAAHHHHHH HIS HANDWRITING IS SO BAD THAT THE CAMERA ALSO STARTED TO CRY💀💀💀
Ryan is a giga brain when it comes to puzzles. Like who the heck would even be able to get some of these.
18:46 the barn looks at the camera
"splish splash"
How to sum up the full release of Amanda the adventurer for me.  Amanda: Your friends must love your treats from the post office…  Me: Bitch, at least I have friends.  Amanda: (clicks on the cake)  I can’t send that in the mail!  Me: How the hell do you expect to send cookies, you better have enough money for some same day shipping!
I love that Ryan counted some random boxes as a chair for some reason, but he still got the 2682 code because he _didn't_ count the sofa lmao
One thing worth noting: In that tape where Rebecca is recording what the director calls "Simple lines", it sounds to me like she's being tricked into chanting demonic names. "Bye yell" and "Pie man" after a bit start to sound like "Bael" and "Paimon", which to my understanding are names often associated with demons. So my theory is that when Sam was offered to "turn Amanda into a cartoon", they meant that more literally than he realized, and used demonic rituals to actually trap the little girl's soul in the show itself. The lines "Sometimes I feel myself... rotting. But it's far away" and "I'm out there... somewhere..." Imply that Rebecca's body is somewhere out in the world, most likely in a comatose state or a rotting corpse, and her soul slowly going mad in her own cartoon can feel it.
Help Amanda instead of wooly in surgery
Remember when you say no to the baby or lonely kitten Amanda brakes her bone 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wooly was such a good character 😢😢
I believe there are two secret endings
Did you know that wolly is evil and Amanda is trying to help us ? Only when we get answer wrong wolly is with us
"Some mommies eat their babies!"  *Peck* *Chirp!* "Yum yum!" .....wtf
the last tape is not in the game and  it is in the game and its in the game files
Guys a lil before 39:07  it says he is allergic to apples and in the start she knew so she said apple pie
21:55
Oh i almost forget if you type wooly at the begining amanda will turn around
Sir if you go in the chicken farm and type sam it will said wait how do you- and if you type Riley in the meat store  he will cover his mouth  and in to the gray ting valcano or wathever just type kate or riley and if you type Rebecca in the farm where he stared in the chicken pig cow
Ryan do you remember when Amanda took you to the house in the first little peak and ask us to nock on the door what if sam live there as a representative or maybe that was a where Kate lives and the something happened and what if when she got to the house when she said she's out there some where and she entered sam's house and now he's missing(just a theory)
Pause at 35:36
50:13 You have to do it quick, (or slow playback speed) but if you pause at this timezone, there is a weird looking face on Amanda.
48:06 notice how the words she is saying means Bael, paimon, and Balam I think that’s how you spell them, but anyways these three names are the names of demons. That company probably did something to Rebecca and maybe made a pact with these demons and that’s how Amanda was created…? I think Rebecca is stuck in that game and wooly is trying to help..? Also if you look at the credit scenes, wooly’s name isn’t on there, so who is wooly??
50:13 isn't she beautiful
35:05 caught me off guard💀
I really like this game and I understand everything about it but can somebody please tell me that in one of the ending when Amanda attacks you as the monster, what is really happening to her? Like is she a demon or something? (sorry if I wrote stupid things) :D
36:47 the forbiden episode of saw they didnt want us to see!!
Amanda from "Amanda the Adventurer" is Over Powered Done right  Amanda Is the Flute to the pied piper of Hamlen. A Tool for Luring Children Away. She is Alone and Desperate so she feels That No one Can  Help her. She wants friends but shes Being used to kill others Trapped and Frustrated  She Feels herself Rotting away.
I have watched many playthroughs but non of them had the hat ending
Heres some lore what if the investigator is sam the person who walks in at the very end when you break the TV and hes their to help stop amanda with you so you can save the world mabye their will be a second game and we get to know way more stuff thats just a therory
The analog clock
His neck was brown, maybe the fedora man is sam. Sam was also black
"Grass is a type of plant" 🤓
5:55
Its the tape behind the slaughter
Here we go again watching a different YouTuber playing this game and at the time I’m watching this it’s 3 AM in the night well trying to stay quiet so my mom doesn’t catch me in the night it makes it feel more scary :p
21:22 tf why did that sound like the ps2 startup for a sec
Ryan managing to misread and misspell everything has me rolling
@8-BitRyan the last tape has probably got something to do with wooly maybe when he tries to talk to u pause on him that’s all I can really think up 🐡
Wooly is acting too sus to me, mostly in the beginning. Might just be me
25:49 aww her voice sounds sweet
When the tv says “flood warning” what if you use the water bucket on the tv or the weather toy?
55:30 same thoughts
For the “What is the Daddy chicken called?” Type “Sam”.
Tape 6 (the video) can be found in the files of the game, its a 10 minute footage of Wooly sitting at a table.
That was antu kate
hey Ryan. at 37:35 try to help amanda and see what happens .
If you keep saying Sam what happened??
IDK anyway
btw you spelled like wrong (this and a hate comment)
48:31 BTW, the producer is lying. He's making her say demon names. Bye yell-Ba'el, Pie man-Pai'man, Baa lamb- Bal'am.
Ryan was right with that secret plant pot for the doll but yeah he messed up lol
I think that Rebecca in the show is locked into it. I believe that the show getting weird has to do with amanda realizing her world as she is actually Rebecca and Hamelin doesn’t want her to realize this. So they add wooly to distract her. I think wooly is evil.
Tip: if you get the scissors at the beginning you can cut the dolls head off
I don't know if anyone has tried this, but on the "everything rots" tape, what if you type in "maybe" instead of yes or no
35:05 the cake is a lie
HOW DID THIS GET 1MIL VIEWS AND THE OTHER VIDEO DIDN'T
I think I know how to get the end with the man. By having to look at the purple tape and finish the sun end, then the man comes! (this is just my guess)
Am I the only one that wants to know what happens if you help Amanda do the surgery
God the actual lore for this game is slowly getting crazy , jacksepticeye made a real good video on covering what he thinks is happening , if you notice the monster has "wool" over it's eyes , and when they were interviewing her she was saying the names of demons she says something along the lines of baah lamb ,  maybe wooly is a wolf in sheep's clothing .
14:05 Ryan saying Por Favor is incredible
The last tape is in the files…
I heard that if you put "colton" in the kitchen tape you skip and trigger the good ending (skips to the part when we throw the brick)
33:19
Answer Sam
In the newspaper clipping with the interview with the father, he and the interviewer met for strawberry banana pancakes....
I wonder if the petting zoo tape is her moving on from Wooly since Wooly is the main form of sanity for us and Amanda. Without Wooly, she's all alone and thinking imaginary friends.
During the sequence where Wooly says it's his birthday, he seems to be very manipulative but starts to lose control over Amanda but eventually got his way. I think Wooly is like the director or producer or big company trying to control Rebecca, loses control of her or the show but eventually gets his way. Just my little insight.
13:54 BRSERK REFRENCE
I heard a theory from Cory about Wooly where he was brought into the show to keep Amanda distracted from the outside world and if you go back to the what’s a family tape and type “Sam” in the daddy chicken thing you can see Wooly have a surprised reaction, like he knew who that was before Amanda realized so he knows a bit more than he’s letting on from the looks of it
When are you gonna do fnf again
35:07 so it is a lie!
by the way there are five more endings to remind you
I don't know if people have already said this, but the last tape no one has gotten legitimately unless they had early access. The only way people got it were either getting early access to the game or they hacked and no-clipped Out of bounds to get it. So to my knowledge there is no known way to get the last tape.
if you say yes amanda will say she is out there some where
amandas real name is rebeca by the way
if you use sam amandas real dads name sam instead of roster she will say someing difrent by the way lov e your vids
This lore of this game is insane I love it❤❤ that is the mystery of amanda and the tapes I think Rebecca is associated with amanda and nothing with wooly
The guy at the end of the true ending is sam
I think the detective is the man in the headphones that Rebecca was talking about
4:54 HAHA
So, no one put timelapses here to only see the endings, so i decided to do something  here you go:       OF COURSE NOT IM TOO LAZY HAHA
-For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.   (Hebrews 3:4) -And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.   (Revelation 7:13-14) -And I will bring the blind by a way(Jesus Christ) that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.   (Isaiah 42:16)
Does anyone know where Ryan got his computer or what computer it is since I’m getting one for my birthday and my parents said it can be any one and I’d want one like Ryan’s so I can play the games he plays or if anyone knows how much it is that would help too, thanks guys :)
Also! When amanda said word of her secrete "im there, somewhere" - without static - is insanely scary!
But, what would happened if you help amanda to make brain surgery?
15:27 Amanda: "can you make a sound like a sheep?" Me: "beep beep I'm a sheep I said beep beep I'm a sheep" 🤣 that was seriously my first thought at that moment
Ryan I hope you dont think Amanda is evil
Theory: there is a town called hamelin in germany (hemln in english) this town was the town that wrote the pied piper (you might see where this is going). in the tape where amnda is saying those weird words like "baa lamb" maybe something is in teh headphones telling her what to do. "the man in the headphones". i also have a crap theory where sam is the monster. trying to ruin what hamln turned the show into.
Amanda:breaking the tv to get out :me: run away and throw a molotov on those dvds and tv
Thats sam in tje bed and thats rebecca when she got possessed
in the animation she said shes rotting somwhere sometimes and probalby she got killed.. maybe like sam the dad of her(rebecca)
Colton... try the name "colton"
Amanda the adventurer is the only game that gives me goosebumps every single time
11:00 the first time ive seen him getting something first try
Amanda force us to do stuff for her cause she is lazing af
I just wonder who the Rain coat/ hoody guy is????   He must be some person who's gonna save Riley or maybe......   He must be there to save Riley!
Don't you just love when you're just casually watching YouTube, and the site just decides to stop loading the video entirely despite still having a good internet connection? Seriously, I can't be the only person that has experienced this bullcrap scenario. I'm forever stuck at 15:43 because of it. It's infuriating.
again  NO TAPE WITH WOOLY? AGAIN WHERE ISTHE SECRET TAPE FOR WOOLY
Pause button....
Theory: wooly is a victim of the tapes, when wooly starts acting differant because they arent wooly, amanda tries to "fix" wooly, turning him into the sheep
Wait a sec, I think I realised something... Pause at 38:47(the part where Amanda in the kitchen). You will realise there is a 'symbols' at the fridge! The bookshelf near the trapdoor and the bookshelf near the blabbot have some book with the same symbols!!!
Video 6 of asking Ryan to adopt a Cat
I don't know if this could be something important, but does anything happen if you put rose instead of kate when amanda is trying to send her friend a gift?  I'm thinking what could get tape 6 and that's the only other thing i could think of.
me, thinking i'm super clever knowing the music notes: i can read this! it's F, A, C, A, D, E- [gasp]
Lots of people have mentioned the possible correlation between Amanda and the Pied Piper of Hamelin (guy who lured children away from the town of Hamelin, Germany).. and Ive noticed that in english the word Hamelin is spelled, "Hamelin" But in German it's "Hameln".. the exact same way the companies name is spelled in the game. 🤔
Blabbot's death is so sad
I dont know if someone told this to ryan or its already done but idc.if you grow a flower on the pot with a 21 on it you can give it to the doll and you will get a tape
Can someone give me  a timestamp where corey left off plz 😂
49:32 My brain when I learn 3+7=10 but 33+77 doesn’t equal 100
This game is the next fnaf. What i mean by that is how popular this is going to be. Also alot of people making theories and stuff. There's alot of lore in this to. We might get sequels to the game how popular it is
18:56 That’s Because That IS Wooly!
Just wanted to see all the endings on this game and came across this channel. (Heard of ya a couple times) And noticed you're shirt! Memento Mori🥲
The dolls va is just default voice of CHATGPT 🤖🤩
Bro there is a vha tape that at the start wooly ask to help and you can say yes or no say yes
Try siding with Amanda when she tries cutting wooly head offq
ur Hand writing is good i saw ☺
I have an unhealthy amount of love for 8bitryan videos 😂
Is it just me or the cake kinda looks like the cake from portal 2
Y’all, I just realized something! What if the company that made the show killed Rebecca and put her in a butcher shop? That would explain why she was screaming, “I don’t want to go in there!”
Matpat from gametheorist thinks HaMin is the Amanda, the adventurer version of pied piper. If you paid attention sam said "his show didn't make alot of money but he doesn't care because it brings joy to kids." When HaMin takes over show, kids and Sam end up missing. In the story pied Piper, this guy is hired in a town to get rid of rats by playing a flute so rats drown them selves. Once townies, people refused to pay pied piper  he plays is flute to to lure kids to drown themselves. This is what matpat and his team mostly ash where talk about on his game play channel gtlive. Do you think that this could be a possibility?
Rebeccas ded
CHECK THE FILES!!!!!!!!!! #... (DELETED)
Ryan, remember when Amanda hurts wooly at the swing set, you went along with it, but she acts different if you say something that fits into the lines, like “police”
i cant watch this...something about it triggers intrusive thoughts that i simply cant deal with right now, however it is a good video
35:58 i love how woolys face is like that its cute.
the other tape is making peach pie im pretty sure
kate is the auntie in the letter
Now that I have a theory for the tape for the camera that was recording who was that,I think that was Kate and she got caught and now is probably dead with Sam
At 35:36 wooly has Amanda behind just an fact idk what’s it for also make the speed at 0.25x
I have a rhiori What if rebeca soul is in Amanda and Wen you go back in to the meat shop she remembers the two D virshion were wooly dies and she dosent Whant that to happen again she and and that perdone waching control the plac she is in wooly says that she can take them some where els so she controla the univers there in too
20:39 bro tried sneaking one out 💀
I never realised there was a 5th ending
You should try typing Sam for the daddy's chickens name you will enjoy what you find.
I wonder what happens if you help Amanda "fix" Wooly
so with any segment regarding the piano, what song plays after he puts in the correct sequence? Like the song at 34:58
I think to get the other tape is helping Amanda unalive wooly during the doctor scene
the notes translate to "facade"
I think the game makes you spell his name wrong...? I've seen a couple other guys play this and they all misspelled it as wolly and not WOOLY. Coincidence????
49:32
WHEN theres amanda asking how daddy chicken is called say sam
When you type sam in the place where you supposed to write rooster, after amanda asks, where did you know that, the barn, and all the animals are looking at the people. And it's a pretty scary fact, that Amanda can manipulate even things she isn't supposed to
1:21 end (fake)
I think Amanda and Rebeca is connected  They are basically the same person I think this  because Amanda says “I don’t wanna play anymore” like something is happening to Rebecca
35:36 pause then you can see Amanda with her goofy ah stick arm about to grab wooly.
Ok, what I'm trying to work out, is why would Kate (the player) have all of the items that are required to solve the mystery? Was she close to Sam?  On a side note, who killed Sam? We cannot be sure that it's Amanda, she seems lost when it comes to people from real life. All characters in the cartoon are resembling someone, so there's the Butcher and Wooly that we don't know anything about. But it's Wooly's birthday, but it was adressed to Kate? Or maybe we are not Kate, but in Wooly's house? Maybe Amanda wants to kill Wooly because of Sam? Maybe Wooly is the voice in the headphones, or at least that might be what Rebecca inside of Amanda was thinking, and the person behind voice in the headphones perhaps killed Sam? Hence why she doesn't treat Wooly as a friend. It is all just speculation, I have nothing to backup anything I wrote, but think about it this way.  Wooly starts to like Amanda in the show. Rebecca doesn't want to continue teaching Amanda's AI random things. Sam sticks up for her. Wooly hearing that someone wants to take her friend away, kills Sam. Wooly is happy that she gets to keep her friend. AI breaks, Wooly starts to get scared. Rebecca is sad and angry, corrupts Amanda. Amanda wants to stay the way she is, Rebecca want out. She reaches out to people with hope that they can help her leave, or replace her. People get sucked in instead. Rest is creative freedom that spirals out of comprehension, I don't know how to make sense of it.
SAM is woolly
I think Sam might have been turned into Blabbot: 1. They have similar voices. 2. Amanda getting angry at the farm scene, when you type in Sam's name may be Rebecca being angry that her father abandoned her. 3. Blabbermouth is another term for a tattletale. 4. In order to get the key for the final chest, and Amanda's secret, you have to 'kill' Blabbot.  5. Hamlin Entertainment wouldn't want the father-figure anywhere he could influence 'Amanda'.
I got two theories about the man in the headphones. 1 one it’s one of the demons that Rebeca was saying or, number 2 it was the mystery man in the fedora
maybe sam is actually wooly
Bro I have a theory, so on the edges of the tv there are those white things right? If you look closely at them while watching the tapes they are stickers that were ripped off. What if Aunt Kate got those endings except for a specific one so she left it with “you”???
If you waited a little bit longer with the water bucket in-front of the robot then the robot will  say “I love you”
The best brick shot in a tv in the world😂
Maybe you get the final tape by helping Amanda and not Wooly?
The doll is Amanda
I have a theory for the person in the hat It might be a stretch but I think that it might be Kate because Kate is a investigator
wooly- wrong wolly-correct
Am I the only one that thinks Sam Colton got turned into Wooly?
2 minutes after i finished the video my mother barged in talking about a kitten that needs help and it wont stop meowing, crazy coinsidence
Pause at 35:36 and you will see noodle arm, Amanda
43:20 bro her Voice like Mable to Woman
THE CAKE IS A LIEEEEEE 35:01
Rooster
Ryan, I love you, but I am very confused f***ing confused lol
Not only does he make good videos even the smallest details like finding a way to flip a paper by hitting it against a table for extra lore. This is crazy dedication. This is why he's ryan such a unique person.
I feel like the “detective” is Sam
21:50  Ryan:talking Weather toy:flies at him Ryan:I GOT ASSAULTED BY A TAPE
5:56 dent in the head
Okay okay okay listen up why don't you try banana and apple cook banana and apple pancake because it says that they are Sam's favourite so maybe it'll give you the last tape???
52:33 if that's the case, then who was the Barn???... cause that one looked like the most disturbed one
You have to say nobody when Amanda ask You who can help wooly
it aint wolly its wooly
dear Ryan, What if you answer Amanda's Aunt Name KATE for ALL Tapes - Amanda the Adventurer  found this in yt and there is a hidden clip in the record . btw that mysterious guy is Aunt Kate .
WOOLY IS SAM OMG I JUST PUT IT TOGETHER
Ok i got jumpscared
Theory: it was all a gas leak hallucination, the “detective” seemed to be wearing a gas mask, everything is normal, you just breathed in the gas that was leaking from the pipes
3:09 bro, are you colorblind?😂 The last one tape is darkblue and you can't get it in the game, not yet. But you can see the video in the game files.
So if u put peach in the oven u will get a yellow tape
Wooly isn't a bad guy. That theories bad. Wooly is trying to keep amanda on track because the bad entity will take her over if she is confused or upset.
3:52 write colton and go to the tape that wooly gets hurt in his knee write there nobody
What did you just do after the purple tape because I’ve never got that ending before
That was pretty intense and insane 😰 an amazing story and game!
Hey Ryan, you should try putting in the family name Colton for every time you’re able to, it’s a secret dialogue I guess
waitwait the doll has the ai yandere gf voice !!!
Pls answer sam for every tape just see what is does 🙃
gays
The longer you hold the bucket the more sad diologue you get, its honestly enough to make a dud tear up
I love this game, and I spent a couple of hours making a theory:  So basically, Amanda the Adventurer (ATA) was a simple but enjoyable concept invented by Sam Colton, with his adopted daughter Rebecca as the star of the show playing Amanda herself. Make note that it is quite likely that the character Wooly was not in play yet, since it wouldn’t be possible to have a talking sheep in the phase of ATA where it was a live action TV show. However, as the show gains popularity, Sam is approached by Hameln Entertainment (Spoken about in the purple tape on the coffee break - “I’ve [Sam] actually had some people [Hameln Ent.] approach me about it. They say they want to turn Amanda into a cartoon”. It is evident that this is the case, as seen with the cartoons that our character, Riley, is able to watch and interact with. However, it appears that Hameln entertainment has some sort of darker secret, some other motive. I believe that they want to make ATA a fully interactive TV show, where the children of the audience can basically choose their own adventure, as such. However, this appears to impossible without some form of otherworldly intervention, which is why they start to make Rebecca say Demon names in the Green tape (Baa Lamb —> Balaam, Pie Man —> Paimon, Baa Yell —> Bael), in order to possibly channel some sort of demon inside of her so that she can basically make all of Hameln entertainments wildest dreams for the show come true. Sam eventually intervenes with this (“I want this to stop”), but the director pushes, basically making them “Take 5” before returning to the script again. Hameln entertainment most likely saw Sam as some sort of threat or obstacle in getting the demon inside Rebecca, or maybe his death would’ve sparked extreme emotions that would allow her to become possessed, which is why they killed Sam. This is confirmed in the Blabbot Voiceline ‘Send my condolences to Kate’, implying Sam is dead. Sams missing story is shown all over the news (Red tape), Which is the point where I believe Rebecca truly becomes possessed by the demon, and is connected with Amanda in the show. This is evident with the “Change in subject matter”, where the voxpop shows that Amanda has been saying strange things like “Mommy and daddy aren’t always right”, attributes that were not evident beforehand. This is the tipping point, the time where the demon truly starts to take control of the show. I feel that they lull the children into a sense of calmness and sort of hypnotism, as seen with Laura in the Orange Tape. Then, they take their victims and make them an object, building or creature in the show (Butcher meat Ending) . But how does this account for the open door? Simple. The demon can take a physical manifestation of sorts, seen in the Bad Ending where Riley is taken by Demon Amanda. The Demon entered through the front door and took Laura with them into the TV show, which explains why Amanda knows Laura’s favourite Ice cream flavour. The physical demon idea is also backed up when Amanda says “I’m out there. Somewhere”. But how does this explain why Amanda says she sometimes feels herself rot? I feel like this is most likely because Rebecca’s actual body is decomposing and rotting away somewhere, and Rebecca’s soul is still attached to this body. Finally, the raincoat person. I fr dont have any idea who this is, but it would be probably be Kate.  P.S. There are three things I forgot to mention:  1. The lonely kitten: This most likely symbolises Rebecca after Sam went missing, once again alone and scared for her life. When you answer “No” to helping the kitten, Amanda twists into her demon form, most likely similar what happened to Rebecca. She is so terrified and sad about not helping the kitten because this is precisely how she felt around the time of the Red tape. 2. Woolie: Who is woolie? I think that it is Sam Colton. It sounds weird, but it does seem plausible. Woolie is always trying to make sure Amanda doesn’t step out of line, and is always making sure that no sensitive subject matter comes up from Amanda. It sounds weird, but basically Woolie and Sam share similar character traits. And for people who think Woolie is Amanda’s brother because she says “Grandma” instead of “Your Grandma”, you can still talk with your FATHER and call them “Grandma”, further proving the point that Woolie is Sam’s soul. 3. I don’t know if I said this enough, but basically Amanda is a manifestation of the demon channeled inside of Rebecca. Which is why we see the childlike innocence and sentimental moments such as “Something bad happened [Sam’s death]” where Amanda appears quite sympathetic, especially when it is Woolie’s birthday. But then again, the demonic monstrosity has larger control over Rebecca, meaning that Amanda is more often seen as an evil psychopath than the charming innocent young girl who has “always seen the world with such kindness and joy”.    Long story short, Amanda is an amalgamation of Rebecca’s innocence, and a demonic evil that absorbs children into the show to become animate objects in the show (The Butcher Ending), and Woolie is Sam Colton Reborn.
no way my man 8bit forgor the WOOLY
I am convinced that Wooly is either Sam, Jordan, or the grey guy in the secret ending.  Maybe the grey guy is Sam.
Idk abt the notes but all I know is that the notes for me are f a c a d e  for trumpet
I realise like at 7.20 timestamp the musical notes spell facade
Cory is great to you
This is probably the most unsettling game. I dunno why but I felt so creeped out 👀
was there morse code in the credits
5:55 is why I love Ryan's editing skills 😂
why does he sound like an indien dude its kinda buging me
38:41 The oldest episode of Amanda the Advanturer in 2019/2021
I love the little details like the barn turning it's eyes towards the camera after you say "sam" to Amanda
try pausing while amanda kills wooly
I think this game is a giant allegory for dangers of AI generated content.
41:33 R.I.P :( 2023-2023
You get the last ending from giving a peach to the doll the spits out a tape and you will see the ending for yourself  Hope this helps:)
I mean, Amanda isn't really wrong. Parents aren't always right. That's a fact. lol But obviously, the reason she said that is to get kids to trust her more than their own parents.
Maybe when Amanda is cutting open Wooly, instead of helping Wooly, you help her.
Use the peach, put it in the oven you’ll get a Secret tape
She signed a contract with that person
i feel your pain....8-BITRYAN, amanda probally broke your brain confusing you
4:55 Wooly screaming “BAaAA BAAAaAa bAAaaA”
your computer time has to be 3 45 to unlock the 6th tape
That muffin is looking awfully like a hamster
10:39 the notes are F, A, C, A, D, E
49:32 dodododoodoodododododododd
purple guy tape
Ryan pls read this when Amanda ask you what the rooster called type in Sam it kinda like an Easter egg she'll say WHAT DID YOU SAID!!!
You should help Amanda and see what happens🤔🤔🤔
I'm curious... During the part where Wooly's nee is hurt, what would happen if instead of Doctor or Nobody, you typed Amanda?
NAH RYAN CRAZY bro search up "what do you call a male" on google, and then relate to 18:29 for no accountable reason 💀
R.I.P Blabbot, you will never be forgotten brave soldier
The music code is facade
Sam is the barn 47:24 look how he looks at the screen and he's the only thing with eyes that are like bloodshot and breathing heavy
Nothing is better than watching Ryan playing a game for hours and sip some nice cup of tea
Something tells me the investigator could have been the person behind the camera secretly recording behind the door
Idea: for all tapes anser Amanda
My theory is that Sam is wooly, wooly is kinda like the "parent figure" of Amanda, hes always warning her about things and telling her that she shouldnt do something or stop doing something, they also sound kinda similar. something else is that when in the recording room when the tape ended and there was like a strange thud, maybe amanda got put into the show and same as sam as wooly and the director maybe as the worker man.
I’m over here saying Rebecca is Amanda and I ain’t even know XD
not going lie
his good at fnf
2:16 bro read potato on the wall and was surprised when he grew a potato 😭
4:54 This had me laughing so much
Sus amanda
When she says “do you know what the daddy chicken is called?” Type in Rebecca you might get the last tape.
Ryan on one of the the letters on the wall it talks about a strawberry and banana pancakes which you have when use the oven so if you make them I think you get the 6th secret tape.😮
It’s like an escape room
You know how you put the sam insteaf of rooster what if you put kate?
I know it was shoto be disturbing, but that "AHHH" sound affect lol.
They need a ending that’s let’s u save wooly😢 and take him to the real world!
The 6th tape I think I seen a video where wooly was in a white room plz see my comment and tell it on next vid
You have to pause it when it says thunder warning for something I forgot what it does but yeah
I have my own Theory I think Amanda Sam's daughter I think that the one of the guy at the end was Sam he was just hiding acting to be sitting disappeared because he knew what Amanda was doing Amanda was doing something and or hanimations or whatever it is cold but I think Sam he saw something so he act like he disappeared and the person that ran in was Sam.
I don’t know which part disturbed me more, the cake melting with a distorted happy birthday song being played in the background, or Amanda trying to perform surgery on Wooly.
OMG OK SO AT THE START OF THE 2ND IRL TAPE IT SAYS THAT COLTON WENT MISSING, AND HIS DAUGHTER REBECCA WAS THE ACTOR FOR AMANDA  NOW IK WHY SHE PAUSES WHEN SHE IS GONNA SAY WHAT THE ROOSTER IS TO THE CHICKS CUZ HER DAD IS GONE
If you put your video at 55:40 there is Amanda with a weird face does it have to do anything?
Why does Amanda's voice kind of sound like Mabel from Gravity Falls?
listen Ryan go to the farm tape then when she asks whats a daddy chicken called type sam she will have a special response
After sinking into this game and getting a tad bit uncomfortable and scared, its nice to hangout in the comment section. How ya doin.  Drop down your theories I'd love to read em!
Try helping Amanda instead of wooly
9:48 his name is spelt “Wooly”- not Wolly-
This. Is a bucket.
You spelled like wrong you said liek sorry IL shut up ok
That part when he got hit in the head and got a dent had me dying 💀
i find it absolutely hilarious how the beginning of the petting zoo episode was deadass just amanda being racist to wooly
One Secret about the Sam thing the reason why she acted so weird  is because Amanda is actually Rebecca and Lauren another fun fact Lauren and Rebecca are the same people the birthday tape is when her name used to be Lauren but something happend and she got adopted by Sam Colten who went missing in 2000
The 6th tape exists currently in the game, I saw it on another play through for the game.    This tape does not change the endings you have them all.   S P O I L E R  The final tape looks like an attempt of Wooly having his own show.  The tape opens with Wooly looking like he's thinking by a peach titled "Herd of Mouth with Wooly the sheep" which then opens to Wooly sitting at a table in a gray  otherwise blank room.   The tape is 10 minutes long, Wooly doesn't  speak just does things like yawn, look around and scratch his wool.  At one point he looks like he's going to speak but doesn't.   It then goes to the blue screen and that's it.   Not worth looking for the tape only to sit through the longest tape of well nothing.   The point of the video seems to be that Wooly can't really exist without Amanda to interact with.  If he's alone and away from her he doesn't beg for help, he just sits there like he has no idea what to do with himself.
You should’ve splashed the doll
Play The Return to Bloody Nights again
Theres a secret tape in the game files and its pretty  important to the lore
So like idk if anyone noticed this but the music notes in the card store spell out facade...
Put the Yellow flower in the doll's hair
Ice is good with milk.
That TV jumpscare about snapped my neck, it scared me so badly 😂
Did anyone else see a code on the fridge?
Does anyone remember that wooly said he was allergic to apples, and Amanda was making apple pie when wooly wanted to make peach pie
Great vid 👍
Pls pin me
Ay Ryan the red box in the back and remember the book that said guts that’s the code to the red box
pin this  so when you picked up the favroite movies tape it had three names on it witch of zo looking for beebo and john's candy factory  need more info sorry i will update this a soon as i get more info
You’ve got to play one of the state of decays
“Amandeh Amendeh Amendeh” had me dying 💀
Timestamp for me: 43:32
One thing that clicks to me is that when sam was on the tv and the cookies get mentioned alot i remember that amanda tries to get cookies for woolys birthday wich makes me think wooly is amandas father maybe ?
"Wolly"💀💀💀
I stumbled across this video and i am intrigued, but i dont know what the heck is going on. Someone help.
The part where  Amanda said "I'm still out there somewhere" makes me more curious
If you already did this I feel dumb but you can use Rebecca in the "What's a family?" Tape and you can say no to helping the kitten in the same tape you can use Rebecca and something will happen
the guy recording outside of the room is wooly duh
Its wooly!
I think the colored tapes are a code to the robot
I don’t like scary games
16:14 SUIIIIIIII
47:26 I think Sam is the farm house in the background cause when Rayan typed (Sam) the eyes started to stare at us and they are the only red eyes in the game so Sam is traped in the show that's why he's missing
18:33 Somebody's got family issues lol
as a person named colton, i can indeed confirm i am missing
The 6th tape is bugged. You’re gonna have to hack the game to get it, I think.
Wait a second...What if Wooly is Sam? If the theory that people get traped inside the show..and he is kinda the first person that would get traped in it since he went missing during the production of the show...it would make sense that he is traped as wooly, the second main characther. Just what I think.
12:16 bro just wanted an autograph
Knowing the lore the game is crazy
I know that if you Wait I don't know but When it's at the doctor park And you see Amanda wearing the suit with the Stuff and it's time to choose who will you choose trust Pick Amanda Cause I think you should pick Amanda instead of wooly and then will we get mad
OH MY GOD WHEN YOU TYPED IN RILEY?? That was freaky
I wasn't scared about the coffee brake tape it's kind of funny that they added it😂
You can also get a secret tape if you type in lamb at the meat shop
one major thing i’ve taken away from this is that amanda is not just rebecca in the cartoon. The main take away from the game is that rebecca is trapped or somehow linked to amanda in the tapes, however i don’t think it’s always true. amanda seems to have two sides, her insanely destructive side and her…. human side? Her shift in tone when she says things like “help the lonely kitten” and when she’s distressed about not wanting to go to the meat shop is obviously not the “main” amanda, but possibly rebecca breaking through the facade. I don’t think rebecca wants to do what’s she’s doing, but something or someone is forcing her to. This could also link with the irl tape of the recording session, where rebecca seemingly hears a man in the headphones, rebecca responding “i don’t want to do that”. there is DEFINITELY something greater controlling whatever is happening.  This also explains why amanda is so, so distressed about going to the meat shop. We see in one of the endings we leave the attic and wake up in the butchers, this heavily implies that every inanimate object with eyes is a human soul trapped in the tape. Rebecca doesn’t want to go the butchers because seeing the souls that she has unwillingly trapped is traumatic for her. it’s torture.   I also wanted to mention- out of all of the inanimate objects with eyes, one sticks out the most- the barn at the chicken pen at the petting zoo. it’s eyes are slightly reddened and irritated, and it *breathes*, starting slow and then speeding up. It’s an odd detail considering we never see another trapped soul with irritated eyes or moving (apart from bobbing left and right in unison) what do y’all think? i think that the barn could be important! i’m glad this game has expanded the lore a lot more, it’s really roping me in lmao
Fun fact: you can only find the 6th tape in the game files
🤔🤔🤔🤔
Ooo
IV BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER AMANDA THE ADVENTURER VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!
That house has seen some shit
ahh, that shirt brings back good memories.
what happens if you help amanda other than wooly when amanda is operating on wooly?
Plot twist: she ate wooly
He has five endings but there’re is six
That happy birthday sequence actually creeped me out. What in tarnation
What if,Wooly is one of Amanda's victims.Condsidering,when Amanda said that Wooly was a sheep,Wooly didn tseem that happy,and infact wooly was about to say something about this,untill Amanda interupted him.Also,its says auntie kate,and in the letter Auntie kate had left (idk where)in the tape with Amanda,it says her friend is (idk) .Plus!Auntie Kate left all her belongings to riley.Auntie Kate is most likely to be in the game as one of the objects.(Ending with white trapdoor)but this is all i think.
8 bit fartin
I wish I didn’t click on this😢
this is literally like if dora the explorer had a horror game
When she said “trapdoor” I thought about the demo where Amanda crawled through P.S: I didn’t see bad ending
16:13 you were suppose pause at the warning
I think Ryan forgot to help Amanda  in that surgery part with wooly
Of course I could be wrong, but I honestly think the evil company somehow put Rebecca physically in the show (if that makes sense), which is why we're able to respond to her and her having different reactions to certain responses. Because when she said "I'm out there, somewhere" it's either she's physically trapped in the cartoon, or the company has been keeping her hidden from the real world for so long that she doesn't know where she is anymore. Another thing that I thought about was Wooly was that he can correlate to Rebecca's father, since he tries to prevent her from doing anything dangerous. The tape when Amanda gave Wooly the drink and killed him, maybe that could mean that Rebecca was potentially forced to kill her own father, but the demo where she's trying to dig up something counters that. Kate was probably the person who recorded the director, Sam, and Rebecca, which is why she stated in her letter that she won't be coming back, since most likely the company didn't want her reporting them. Sam could've also been killed by the company since he kept objecting to Rebecca reading some things and stuff. Also, since the cartoon somewhat correlates to the real world, maybe when Amanda turns into a monster is the only time Rebecca is able to break free from the cartoon (referring to how I thought she could be physically be in the show). They probably to science tests too, since the lady with the notepad taking notes looks like a scientist. Again, I could be terribly wrong, so I'm kind of just speaking whatever I thought about while watching Ryan play. And thank you Ryan for making this video about an hour long and making it entertaining.
Iooks like edditor has a autocorrector lol
18:23 AAAA
the man and the doll are connected. i know it.
35:03 As a revolutionary game said, the cake is indeed a lie
Before inputting "sam", the barn was not moving. But after inputting "sam", the barn started breathing heavily as if it was afraid of something or someone (Amanda). Notice also how the barn inhaled so much and stared at you at the end, as if it was telling you " stop messing around and be careful "
In one of the secret video tapes, some guy was spying  on them, I remember there was Sam, Rebecca and maybe the man in charge of hamley production. I think they were trying to do something bad to Rebecca and Sam know it. Maybe the company want only to use Rebecca's voice to creat a unique AI with the same mind as Rebecca have with his dad and the show. Maybe that's one of the reasons why Sam disappear , he knew something was wrong when he make that deal with hamley productions. In the end, Rebecca was all alone, the company maintain her as their main prisoner in other words. I have a clue that what Rebecca sign with the hamley productions( the company), was like an agreement to donate something to the company. Because in the end we all know that Rebecca is dead and her body is somewhere around a forest( unknown location). So my answer will be that hamley production somehow Manage to maintain Rebecca's consciousness with all her acting, attitude, and her voice. In other words, when the program went live the first time everything was good and Sam and his daughter saw nothing wrong. After sams death and after her daughters misterious death( probably killed by the company and they only take her consciousness for future episodes) the show start to change because what hamley productions didn't know is that Rebecca's soul was inside the show. After a while of being on the air, Rebecca didn't remember a thing but she probably realized that her life was taken away by the same people his father trust. ( hamley productions) Even if we said Sams name in a few steps of the episodes, she is totally mad that someone saids her fathers name because that reminds her of everything she suffer during her fathers death and her own death. Thats why she start to change all the new episodes:   1. To make contact with someone in the other end of the screen of the Tv and maybe try to add some clues to the kids so they avoid being on the same situation.  2. Even if she try so hard to make kids understand her situation some how, she was mad because some of the kids maybe they answer something wrong to her that make her mad and turn into a monster to disappear each children that didn't understand her( in other words too much hate, anger, and  revenge inside her soul  make Rebecca the perfect monster)  3. Last but not least Rebecca's anger is so big that make every kid in América and probably around the World. Being control by her, and demonstrate to the rest of the parents of each innocent children what she suffer. ( thats why they where reports that some kids disappear without a trace, because thats how Rebecca disappear and her body still somewhere, waiting to be found)  In other words, Rebecca and her dad where victims of a big horrific deal between hamley productions. In real life they are cases that some actors ( big and small) are all being harassed by the same film and television companies just for money, and today they are many cases that havent been resolved.
In order to get the last secret tape I believe you have to go back in one of the earlier tapes, maybe the oh no accident's one, you have to put Rebecca's name as the answer. I think, it's just a theory though 🤔
8:43 Look I don’t know much about this stuff but you know about how she would make things disappear if you pressed the wrong choice? Yeah that is what’s happening but out of control.
genius wow
Those were some really good theories
18:24 yum yum!
cant belive i watched this full video
Bro xqc huge fan
Regarding the company name "Hameln" with the rat logo:  This is a hint to an old German fairy tale. Hameln is a city in Germany. It is said to believe that one time they had a rat issue. They called a person for help, like an exterminator. This guy had a flute and played it to lure all of the rats out of town. After he did his work, the townsfolk didn't want to pay his work. That's when he got angry and played his flute a second time, but this time the flute lured all the children out of town. So all families lost their kids.  I think the game uses the name 'Hameln' and the Rat logo, as the company at first maybe did scientific research and something "good", but at some point switched to robbing the kids out of their families with the show. Do you remember the video part with the birthday, where the daughter was suddenly gone? That's how it went in Hameln in the fictional story. All kids were suddenly gone.  Just wanted to let you know that. I think it's a nice word play on this company's name.
Just a Dog loving Community spreading Awareness for Canine Mental Health❤❤❤
my name is colton
Ryan type Sam at the start of the Petting zoo tape it will unlock Xtra dialog
You’ll never get a million views on a video in one day you keep this up in not subscribe
14:21 “Did you just fart right there?” 🤔🤔🤔🤔🫣🫣
When the directior instructed Rebecca to say those line, one comment here says the line is actually a demon name tricking Rebecca to summon a demon, i think the demon that he instructed her to summon is the monster in the bad ending
One interesting difference between Mats run and Ryans here is the doll gave him the "sam" tape while mat got a green tape from her. Peach tape was different too.
I don’t know if anyone pointed this out but I’m going to anyway, to help Ryan understand what Rebecca was reading: The weird words that she was reading are actually pronounciations of various demons. Bye Yell is Bael, Pie Man is Paimon, and Baa Lamb is Baalam. Basically the director is making her summon a demon by doing this.
I'm sorry to say this but the last secret tape is in the game files and it's just wooly sitting and just thinking check it out
Wooly is a sheep we can see that Rebecca was saying lamb so that means the only reason why wooly was there was to get sacrificed by Amanda when they summoned that demon
ryan , you didn't watch the green tape!
he makes it so obvious hes searching up the other endings lmfao
Just a quick mini theory. What if Wooly is Kate? We know Kate was at least connected with Sam, the creator of the show, so maybe she was close with Rebecca or Amanda too.   On top of that, the “birthday puzzle” for Kate seems so out of place, yet it’s not the first time a birthday has been spoken about. In the second iteration of “in the neighbourhood, it is also Wooly’s birthday. Maybe thats because Wooly and Kate are one in the same?  If people who watch the show get trapped in it, maybe thats why Kate is gone, she was taken into the show. That may also be why Wooly has been trying so hard to help us, because he knows us.   For a game about secrets and “more beneath the eye” kind of thinking, the birthday coincidence just seemed too out of place to not be something. Thoughts?
Man passed up saying “the cake is a lie”
18:22 ¨AHH-¨
This is still creepy, but not as much as the original game was. I think the originals scary simplicity the best part of it.
The way she said she's out there, somewhere, I think she was asking for help rather than trying to scare the viewer.
Splish splash I was taking a bath😂
Ryan when you get to the part where you have to type rooster type Rebecca instead
What would happen if you helped Amanda instead of Woolley during the surgery
Wooly rn:💀
Men when type Sam the barn house look at you
Hey Ryan , you should try typing Sam in the petting zoo tape when she asks what a daddy rooster is?
Bruhhhhhh Amanda's transformation on the “won't you help the lonely kitten?” Bit was AMAZING! I've never had goosebumps like that i swear
This reminds me of that one game “duck season” Ryan played on vr believe it’s the concept of something watching you while you play that coexist in the game and life
What if you help Amanda kill Wooly?
When amanda was about to sew off woolys head you had the option to help her or wooly but you only helped wooly so what happens if you help amanda?
Holy crap the kids who were mind controlled and made to leave their home ARE TURNED INTO MEAT as seen in the fateful end ending
What if the red coat man in the ending was Kate?    Also, what if you help Amanda instead of Wooly in the saw vhs?
Ryan the last thing you need to do is cut the dolls head off
Bro the final tape when amanda tries to share a secret made me jump Almost fell out of my bed
I haven’t been so confused about lore since interrorgation 😩😭
❤
Wooly deserves a better friend
18:23 killed me 😂
43:07 why did I guess that 😂 I feel like maybe the director is wooly because the director was trying to stop Sam from opening the door and was acting like he was scared of rabbeca because wooly is scared of Amanda Also I have a feeling maybe in one of the versions of the second tape in the mail place maybe for friend you have to put in Sam? Or the picnic one you have to do what I saw cory do and don't answer Amanda's question properly but I think that part just ended the game
There's honestly something creepy i feel about The Fateful Ending. And mainly that is one of my favourite endings in the game. After saying yes to help the cat, i can just see the cat is locked away and Wooly is looking directly at you in a way saying "It's too late, and trust me, this is a fate worse then death". The Cat as well (Which i theorized) is Riley. He made a mistake and now will live among the other souls locked in Amanda's world. Even when hearing the music, there IS no way to get out, there's only one way and you can't avoid it. And the second you're in the Butcher shop, you see them, their eyes staring ahead of them, and when you try to move, you can't. You look at yourself and you see it. You're one of them, a prisoner, a victim, a lost soul forgotten in a world of false imagination.
So when you do a new game there is a note on the desk (witch you already know) it mentions Riley’s little Brother going missing and they THINK someone snatched him of the street. Well what if I tell you he’s wolly? Because he IS! It makes sense he goes missing like SAM COLTIN The creator of Amanda The Adventure. They obvi died,but they HAD to watch Amanda the Adventure and Sam died during somehow don’t know but His little Brother kept watching. And then he got sucked in and became wooly for good reasons. 1# He was with Sam Colten. 2# He was MISSING like Sam Colten. And that’s the end of my comment because I feel like someone’s watching me. Easter egg hehe
THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS
I think that wooly is actually kate bc when we play for the first time amanda says that her friend is kate but in the other endings Amanda's friend change into wooly what is kinda wierd isnt it?
The last tape is hard but you got to go to the files of the game the you will see a name but I forgot but it’s something like tape something
Here is my theory, the Amanda in the tapes is her soul while the Amanda that attacks you in those two endings is her body, which was experimented on by that company.
You already know game theory is on this shit
I literally just pieced this together: Amanda being sad when she was with the chickens had something to do with her father missing. Idkkkkk that just randomly popped uppp😭
YOU HAVE TO COOK THE PEACH FOR A SECRET TAPE
Sam is wooly
"The cake is a lie" litraily💀💀💀
MATPAT IS GOING TO HAVE A FIELD DAY
There might be another tape if you help amanda. Not sure about it but it might work. (Helping Amanda during the doctor scene ofc)
At 49:21 The dude that popped up when the sun came up seemed to be looking like a fire fighter? Since he has a red coat and red hat on *or* he was the directer, the person who gave the script to Amanda (Rebecca) to read *or* its someone else..
your like ghetto diamond minecart
I think wooly is Sam since they both like cookies and wooly was annoyed when she called him an animal . They just kept hinting to it .
what is the song used in 50:22 time stamp
AYO DID AMANDA COMMIT ARSON
I remember watching you play beats and shapes😢
pot sam for the farm
i just realized that at 48:38 Rebecca mentions that she doesn't want to do something for "the man in the headphones". if we look into the possible demon names she was saying before one of them is called "Baalam" which has been described with three heads One head is the head of a bull, the second of a man, and the third of a ram, the type of ram with corkscrew horns. she thinks the horns on a demon are headphones. The Man in the Headphones seems to be the Demon Baalam trying to tell Rebecca what to do. Rebecca is seeing a Demon.
That was awesome
The 6th tape is not in the game and physically impossible to get but if you go in the files of the game you can find it but it isnt very interesting and it goes on for 10 minutes
Sam said he loves the cookies and Amanda freaks out of you don’t pick the cookies
Scott: Amanda was talking about now mommies and daddies aren’t always right Honestly sounds like the moral of a lot of Disney movies.
10:00  not wooly calling himself cute lmao
40:39
18:21 “Some Mommy’s eat their BABIES!!!!”🤪
Boogitybot's last words please do not forget me
he forgot to help Amanda instead of wooly when Amanda is trying to kill wooly
Better solution to the lore:The butcher is the good character
Damn it Ryan you should of helped the lonely kitten
Mat pat : "no understanding of lore? 🤨"
ISTG if Mattpat doesn't make another theory on this awesome game then I will literally go insane
day 18 of asking Ryan to play Dredge
50:08 is this dude even playing? how did the mouse move with his off?
I feel like the barn is sam
number 24 on gaming
I dont know why this hasnt been pointed out yet but the symbols on the plants are actually solar system symbols, I know this because 999 (9 persons 9 hours 9 doors) has stuff where it's locked with those same symbols. For example the sun is a circle with a dot in the middle)
HECK YES!!! Was waiting for this video! 18:21 - the sound effect 😭😭 50:13-AMANDAS FACE???
idk if you saw but at 19:45 there is a sheep standing on the barn
speed?
Wait, the company wants to TURN AMANDA, *INTO*, THE CARTOON, and the script summons a demon to possess her and to influence children watching
TO GET THE LAST TAPE. You need to make the peach pie after the first tape, In The Kitchen, at 40 minutes 425 degrees.
The hen just inhaling the poor chick made me laugh out loud hahahaha
Anything but the kitten bro why!?
inkew there was something wierd about the meat
Shes definitely the scp shy guy version in denial
Is anyone else waiting for him to play simulacra 3 ?
43:28 made me jump
50:12 Anyone see Amanda's face change? I know it isn't much but just pointing it out.
Amanda the Adventurer takes place in Kensdale, Ohio. Only in Ohio bro 💀
Look at Amanda at 55:40 her face is changed on the tv
Oop- not the Unnus Annus shirt😂😂😅
i see no one talking about Riley. the person we are playing as so here is what I can get about her. Riley is the niece of Kate who worked directly with sam to make the original amanda the adventurer. she had a younger sibling who went missing. she thinks that the show may have something to do with her sibling dissaperance since she knew that Kate her aunt Experementing with the Show. maybe Kate's role is bigger than we think   Throwng a longshot maybe wooly is kate since Kate is the only person whos directly Involved with the original amanda and she probably didn't like it when the company is abusing rebecca.
WON'T U HELP THE LONELY KITTY  WHY WON'T U HELP THE LONELY KITTY
cool
How about you try to type in why when she asks you to know her secret
Wait in some of the tapes their the clips that were in the old game where we couldn’t move the very first update there’s the reference of wooly being allergic to apples and the clip where he says’theres not so much time’ and it glitches that’s all clips of the old game
43:00 thats sheep cheese
Its just a usual horror game
I've been waiting for this!
Please, someone explain to me the scene where Wooly is just stting quietly, yawning and looking around?
You need to adress the cars to the dad sam to see what happens
Ryan is trending?!?!?
Okay but did anyone else notice that Amanda had teeth in this clip 44:41 😨
Theory: What the trapped kitten represents is Rebecca being trapped inside the tapes and I think it's specially a kitten to relate to the logo of Hameln, a mouse. Cats chase mice and the trapped kitten represents Rebecca/Amanda being trapped by the mouse (Hameln) and therefore she needs you to help the kitten and free it so it (Rebecca/Amanda) can catch the mouse
I swear I played this game on Roblox
Wolly doesn’t deserve this
My guess for the lore: Wooly 1): Wooly is an original character in the show, he was there with the original Amanda, before Rebecca became Amanda, and the reason why he wants to help us so badly is because he saw what the producer did to Rebecca, and what Rebecca did to everyone who entered the house Wooly 2): Wooly is Aunt Kate, she is constantly helping us, she is stuck in the VHS tape but Rebecca took a liking to her, so instead of turning her into buildings/meats/other objects, she turned her into Wooly, and because of that, Aunt Kate asked us to free her and everyone else from Rebecca, and free Rebecca too, from Amanda, since Rebecca is just a small little innocent kid who is controlled by Amanda and according to the top comment, Rebecca was summoning 3 demons, so prob she was possessed by the 3 demons too Wooly 3): Wooly is the player, us, but in a different ending, we got dragged into the show too, but Amanda knew we were not normal, we aren't normal humans, we can just go back and redo everything, and not forget anything, she realize we are like a god, similar to her in the show, so she found us useful and used us as her sidekick, she makes us watch what she does to everybody, and if we try telling past us about it, she kills us Rebecca) Like I said before, she could possibly be possessed by the 3 demons, so that explains why she had 3 sets of multiple eyes, one left, one right and one in the middle, so we might need to save Rebecca from the 3 demons and Amanda in the next sequal Part 2) In the next sequal, we might follow that man into different forests to find the VHS tape and free Rebecca slowly and getting rid of "Amanda the Adventurer" while trying to escape Demon Rebecca, and we have to do it possibly 4 times, each VHS symbolising  the 3 demons and Amanda
That severe thunderstorm warning finna be me soon
55:32 HE SAID IT
4:55  Naaaah bro accidentally left the oven on 💀
My ear starting ringing once the singers starting singing happy birthday thats scary
What don't players im sorry have well really are to help?
Did anyome notice on the Riley fun movies tape the first clip that popped was from the og Amanda the adventurer demo
The fact that he got (most) of the endings and  makes a theory better then game theory is so wild, Ryan got the BRAINZ, kudos to em.
Try clicking on Amanda when she asks what killed mrfox
1 tape in inside piano..
Can you see if you can pull the plug
Is the “ahh” meme sound actually a part of the game? Or is it just edited
i see all of the youtubers make this mistake, but in the coloring book part, your supposed to draw first on the "We Went", and then "Where?", then "You Took Me.", and that'd spell "We Went Where you Took Me." which is hinting at the part where there was only meat stores. and how amanda was acting there.
This is now a depressing story.
2:46 Ryan be asking the real questions What's your opinion? Potato🥔 or Yellow🟡?
at the beggining of the game back in part 1, we read something about someone going missing their name was like Jason or Jaxon one of those two. and in the "Wooly's Birthday" Sequence, wooly says "that's not who it's for" when you type wooly and will eventually say "You don't remember". I wonder if you could put Jason or Jaxon in it again I can't remember which one it was specifically but maybe that will unlock the sixth tape.
😮
Rhe company has something ro so with thr pie piper
This game is made for lore
Here's my theory- they're making the girl say the names of demons, which suggests that Amanda is a demon/the devil. Wooly is a lamb. Jesus is often referred to as a lamb too. Wooly is also trying to save us from the devil (Amanda).
has anyone tried putting kate instead of dead on the tape where they're inside the rotting log?
For the final ending you could try saying Rebecca instead of Rooster because they are the same length
Dora the adventurer if she can actually hear you
This was a cool video! Keep it up Ryan!
Ryan I think you can use the pause button in the first ending when wooly says “You don’t have to answer that” maybe that will lead to something
My name being Colton is actually making this scarier.
Ryan should really try some of the weird Amanda the Adventurer rip-off games 🤣.
9:11 XD I'M 💀
The music notes spell out the word facade. Very interesting🧐
Ryan, in the farm you have to say nobody can  help wooly, then look behind you for the purple tape
Time for lore, MatPat do yo' thing
This adds a whole new meaning to the Bendy line “Sheep sheep sheep, it’s time for sleep.”
hmm will sozumuci is right but i think shes going to summon a demon to take director and sam which i think wooly is sam and she killed him so the ending shows her breaking the system but her dad is trying to break out so he dosent die as other humans the meat is real humans get trapped but at the same time they are dead only with eyes meaning that samand amanda could die either
If this the last thing game  Im sure this character will fight the demon
The Musical notes spell out, F A C A D E, or facade, facade meaning artificial front or appearance by someone showing that the show or Amanda in soecific is a facade
Hey Ryan,  This is gonna be a long or either short-lasting comment (i dont know what that means) but I HIGHLY recommend you try the game Portal 1 and 2 made by Valve. It is an absolute game to try out with insanely good graphics for its time and its fun puzzles. You won't see this but if you do,  PLEASE TRY PORTAL!!!  Like and Reply so ryan can see pls thx!!
Hey dude! Loved the video! I came here to tell you that a dlc for dying light 2 came out, and I thought that you might like it✌️
Wait,Dom didn't get this?!.
Hey Ryan to get the 6th tape you need to tell Amanda Nobody can help wooly when she wants you to say doctor in the oh no accident video
Am I the only one that thinks they should 😊make a show about this in real life and you have to piece together the clues through each episode then it comes then once you get to the end of the last episode everything comes together that would be awesome

Sam is wooly that's why he fears Amanda because she took him from the real world into the show. and why he's asking you to trust him. the reason why u can't fully say yes or no when he asked you to trust him is because Amanda is lonely and the gives her power in the show when wooly asked for her to bring their friends back she ignored him because she doesn't want to be powerless. That's also the reason why wooly doesn't want Amanda to be talk about everything rotting, because he(Sam) wanted to create a show to teach kid nice stuff like to listen to you parents or be nice to other etc.
I really like how this game is organised
dude maybe wooly is the creator of this kids so trapped in there the same way all the other victims got trapped and Amanda killed him cause he did something bad to her..dk if im correct or not :)
25:14 you disrespecting my boi blabbot?
you could try choosing to help Amanda intstead of Wooly during the surgery tape
Imagine when she said "the man in the headphones" near the end she meant she was talking to us/the player.
Hear me out....
I see now she is in control and kinda of not, it like depends on her emotions, kitten ending she got sad then when she let her emotions go she got possesed, so its all her emotions.
I can't believe I watch you again
DEAD ISLAND 2 PLS I NEED MORE!
I have been waching these vids for 6 hours so I am gonna watch this to make it 7hours😢😢😢
CUT THE DOll Hea-#;:$?:+""!
dam amanda ugly-
But you didn't pick Amanda when she asked you whether you will help her or wooly, while she was trying to cut his face, maybe it will give a different ending?
I think I know more evidence towards the fact that Sam = Wooly. (Please make sure you read the last part of this comment!)  I've found slight proof that Sam equals Wooly in Wooly's lines and personality and in the video of the person sneaking around to get footage of Rebecca, the Director and Sam.  [Personality & Lines] In the Coffee Break show, the host and Sam talk about educating the kids watching and letting them see the good in the world, or something like that. I find it interesting how Wooly often tries making the mood happier, or offering parental guidance or just let's Amada and/or the viewers watching about safety in general. I find this interesting because Wooly is trying to make the show brighter, happier and safer and Sam wanted this to be a safe, nice and educational show for kids. Similar huh? That's what proof I found in personality and voice lines.  [Video Footage (+ Sam's Disappearance)] In the Video, it shows a person (which we don't know (yet?) creeping around with a camera, recording outside the door of a room with Sam, a Director and Rebecca (Amanda's actress). The video cuts off once they open the door and so we assume this person gets caught. I find this interesting because when we hear them talk, Sam doesn't like what the Director is doing. Sam tells them stop and doesn't want to do this anymore (I think?). The director gets Rebecca to say some words (@SOZOMUCIMAD made a comment explaining it below this one). In my opinion, I think I did a really good job realizing this one. What better way to get your partner to let you do something, then *remove* them all together. This company is obviously trying to make the demon Amanda we see today. It would make sense, suck your partner in your own cursed realm.   Thank for reading this theory if you did. If you have any questions, problems or anything you need me to answer, just reply to this comment and I'll try answer them as best as I can! Oh and also, that's just a theory.  A GAAMEEEE THEOR-
Cory we need you to catch up with Ryan
bro the doll was gone for so long and i was just yelling at ryan to NOTICE THE DAMN, MISSING DOLL 😭😭
Cut the head of the doll, with yellow flower. It might do something
50:20 BUT HEY THAT'S JUST A THEORY A GAME THEORY
I should not be watching this as 4:48 in the morning, but I also can’t sleep.  Fun times 🗿
The tape is colored white and half black and half white theres 5 types of heavenly end  half whtie and half black tape, white tape, black tape, gray tape, and rainbow tape use the white half black tape thats first 2nd white tape 3rd black tape 4th gray tape 5th tape rainbow tape if you got it worng you will go outside and now you see amanda dead and theres hellish amanda named kate pls make it correctly.
4MILLION 🔜
Now that it is 3 am I sleep
Try when amanda says can I share a secret try saying dad
This is actuall such a cool concept for a video game. Great vid as alwyas Ryan!
It kinda similar to the please don’t touch anything
if you do the tapes to the last to the frist to make it reversal the tape name is " HEAVENLY  END" it means the orginal amanda died while the  other one is hellish so the other hellish amanda is she was the one who killed amanda pick the original amanda to make a win when not theres a new badge "REVERSAL IN TIME"
Anyone noticed the reference with  Hameln and "Follow us to fun"? - the logo is a rat and it's a direct nod to the Pied Pieper of Hameln who took away the children of the city of Hameln after they refused to pay him.
31:49 When Sam mentioned cookies, that reminds me of Kate. Kate is good friends with Sam, and also in the original "In your neighborhood" tape Amanda wanted to send Kate some cookies.
Heya Ryan! It would be so much appreciated if you play roblox trials! It's a nice saw-like game.
I paused at 10:10 when i saw that the doll was gone XD
this man sucks or smth?
Alright, with Wooly having a VERY DEEP lore and an unexplained identity, we're bound to get a second game... i personally think it's Sam as he has a relation to this and that he's clearly concerned with Rebecca but the thing is he may be stuck in Wooly the same way we get stuck as the meat in the shop like the other victims. And the tapes may have been intentionally hiding Sam's involuntary appearance and trapping in the show, which means the Director wanted this to happen and Sam doesn't. Knowing that Sam knows about it and that he may share the info, the Director probably took him and placed him into the VHS by force so as to silence him in some sort of way, let alone the fact that they're all VHS tapes meaning they never planned on letting this out... but Sam as Wooly isn't so contempt at staying silent, and we just so happened to stumble upon these tapes thus giving Sam a chance to warn us of the company's actions... but Rebecca knows this, so she's trying to keep his mouth shut which results in their constant tension and struggle in the show, they're out there alright... We just have to find them
This is the first time I've watched this guy. Is this his usual casting style? Or does he usually let viewers get immersed in horror/story games?
When will we ever get more episodes of medieval you never finished it mate and that was a really good series you had going on for that
I have this feeling that deep down Wooly is the one behind all this. He's always acting weak and has been the one getting picked on throughout the entire game, there's also no connection between him and anything else, where in the credits it shows who Amanda was played by but not Wooly. There have also been multiple occasions where Wooly broke the 4th wall besides the times where he was begging the viewer for "help".
37:34 what happens when you choose amanda ?
i feel like when amanda told us that she was out there some where, she meant that in the literal meaning. i feel like during one of the early tapes (last vid) where we see a kid named lauren running out of the house, that was amanda taking control of her, and later on she starts to get even more control of her based on our actions. this explains how that demon amanda thing was able to reach us in the real world
Damn, Sam starts successful show with adopted daughter, Rebecca. Shady company wants to take over, making Rebecca do weird voice lines summoning demons by name by saying words similar to them 3×. Sam no like, so he mysteriously gets disappeared by *cough* probs the company *cough*. Kids start disappearing after Amanda the Adventurer gets weird without Sam round. Earlier Sam mentioned Aunt Kate by name, saying how she was a close friend. Enter Riley, related to Kate. Riley constantly gets reached out to by Amanda, although Amanda seems to recognize Aunt Kate has passed. Multiple endings implying that Riley is killed by Rebecca/Amanda's demon-possessed self, lives to tell the tale, or suddenly is approached by... someone... wildin'
The bad ending is you die ending imo
i cant get over the fact that when wooly makes you check whats wrong, it just looks like hes A Posing lmao
Who wants some knockout pills It makes to you be knocked out for a few hours  Or a amnesia pill  And does what it says in name
What happens if you choose to help amanda instead of helping wooly when she trys to KILL HIM
i think something happened to amanda, maybe got kidnapped. the locations and order they went to might be her last known locations before she dissapeared.  i also remember something about x marks the spot and under a tree, and she spoke about a rotting tree and feeling rotten... perhaps the tree rotted and they found her body?
Its satisfying hearing ryan making theories
45:22 i think i heard she was saying let me in let me in ! might be thinking Amanda wanted to escape from the tv
My question right now is, How did the player/character that Ryan is playing found the tapes?
Hi Ryan will you ever decide to make a new Minecraft world again?😊
amanda: woolie head is bwoken oh no me: wait so he has survivability in battle cats?
50:20  AAAAAAAAA GAMMMMMEEEEEEEE THEROY
I wonder if the detective is Kate.
Hey Ryan could you do a play though of Star Wars Jedi survivor?
People if you want to play Amanda the adventurer the first one is for 7$ or something but the demo one is for free on steam. Maybe it will be for money soon.
I would absolutely love to play this for my channel however my laptop is so bad I don't even know how well it would run and would run out of storage very quickly and I also dont have 13 dollars
Is it just me or the creepy doll sounds like Neuro-Sama the AI
0:07 ryan you good bruv?
So what is the deal with the Entity in the real world? Maybe there is something in that Celtic article that could explain how “AI” Amanda can apparently move to and from realities.. (between the VHS reality and the real world)
Type nobody when she says who can help wooly in the legit accident tape like so Ryan can see
Witch of 20
45:56 *detroit*
Don’t mind Amanda! She has anger issues 😁 - every goofy ahh fat mom ever (yours)
I speed runned with manlybassashero so I aint missing anything lol
I agree Ryan; i don't think this is the end for the Amanda the Adventurer series...
use strawberry and banana in pan
Ay where is the dark deseption
Jon bernthal is such a great punisher that wait wait wait is memeable😂
I only watch this game with my glock In hand... and i still scared
Where the dead island 2
I feel bad for not trusting the doll when she said "turn around".
Ryan spelling wooly’s name wrong 😭
Like
Nice
does anything happen when you put in 'Rebecca'?
Oh my god, the piano spells facade, i NEVER got it before! Wow this game and its story are well thought out
My daughter and I were watching this. When they said something about a treat for a friend in the meat shop, I quipped  "Lamb chops" and Woolly yells, "Not funny" About jumped out of my skin
my theory:  Amanda started off as a simple kids show and was normal before it got bought by Hameln. Hameln was having Amanda doing rehearsals that seemed normal at first but then Sam Amanda's dad noticed some sketchy behind the scenes things going on. He started getting more involved and limited Amanda's private rehearsals. someone noted that the words Amanda was rehearsing weren't as simple as they seemed and could be translated as the names of demons implying that the producers might be having her summon demons, or it could be subliminal messaging for the children viewing the film. Now I think Sam noticed this and decided to try to stop this and the producers didn't like this. so they had to get rid of him. Now with him out of the way they can continue with their plans. I think using AI learning software along with occultist practices they trapped Amanda's actress in the show and made her into a monster to collect more souls for this show. Remember Amanda controls everything.and with the AI and demonic rituals Hameln managed to keep Amanda under their control making her do terrible things. However there is one person that isn't under their control and that is Wooly. Wooly is always trying to help you and stop Amanda or at least delay her attempts. But he also seems to care about her and at times it seems like she cares about him as well. This leads me to believe that woolie is actually Sam. He disappeared without a trace, nothing was found. Much like the missing children he too was trapped in the show and now tries to prevent others from meeting that fate. Amanda hurts Wooly as punishment for his actions, but not because she wants to. Because the producers force her too. And now you play as someone trying to put the pieces together to learn what happened and how to possibly save everyone living in this VHS hell.  or I could be wrong who knows. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Why when the mom chicken ate the baby got me laughing
I think the detective is the person who was recording Rebecca aka Amanda saying the simple words like baah lamb, I noticed that lamb was the meat of sheep and “baah” was the sound that sheep make, this could have something to do with a comment I saw saying it was a demon named baalam. Maybe there will be a plot twist where wooly isn’t the victim Amanda is. And maybe this “ai” is trying to control her from killing wooly (obviously that failed), and maybe wooly is the demon.
bad ending : If you don't throw the brick to the tv
GIMME MY LIME BACK🍋
You have to type in lamb at the butcher instead of meat to get that extra tape gangy
I literally just noticed that Wooly saying(I am allergic to apples)actually means minus one.😮😮
Woolys probably Sam
Hameln is about the pipe piper who took the kids
I hope the creator of this game adds more or makes a sequel to this game to maybe answer the questions behind what's going on... But a theory of mine is Sam, Rebecca's dad, is dead from the episode tape everything rots. I think it kinda hits that something bad went down.
I think the last tape is in the doll because in the book it show that the doll was being cut.
We need matpat on this ASAP
My god I had chills through the whole thing 😮 I love this the creaters deserve a award for this one I got tears in my eyes right now 😮
I think the red fedora guy is Sam
Now that you've mentioned it, the tapes from demo didn't come back to this full version. Does that mean something? Like, perhaps there's two people examining different collection of tapes from two different locations?
Wolly😂😂
Pls dead island 2:'(
Something is really sketchy about Wooly. I don't think he's necessarily on the "good" side as we may think. He seems to intervene whenever Amanda is trying to recall something relating to reality or the parts that are connected to Rebecca. Whenever Amanda gets a gift for her friend (whom we find out in that tape is Kate), Wooly tries to end it early before they reach the post office. Then, in the second version of the episode, he steps in and takes the direction toward himself so Amanda wouldn't think about Kate.  Another red flag is the rotting tape, whenever he says "Nothing is rotten here!" When there are many signs that there is something rotten happening below the surface of this children's cartoon.  I saw one comment in a different video mention how Wooly might encompass the phrase "wool over the eyes" (both figuratively and literally), and I feel like that is pretty apt. He's trying to keep Amanda placated, keeping the facade of a bright, colorful, and cheery children's show going, but Amanda is too powerful even for him. That's probably why Amanda/Rebecca gets gradually more antagonistic towards Wooly the more it goes on; maybe she realizes he's the one keeping her trapped/contained, keeping her (and the player) from the truth.  Of course, I think there is something even more layers underneath this; it has just yet to be seen. We don't know his motivations: he could be doing this for Amanda's/Rebecca's benefit (or believing this is what is better for them), or he could be just a pawn from the culty Hameln company used to control/keep Amanda in line. Maybe he was once a human trapped in this world with Rebecca and a demon, or he could be a part of the demon or even an AI that the Hamlen team created.  Kudos to this team for creating such complex and engaging characters and mystery in a compact and well-made game!!
Hearing the director try to make her say the names of the demons was crazy to me! I was a little surprised I was able to catch it before i checked the comments, haha. Bael (bye yell), Paimon (pie man), and Baalam (baa lamb)
Can you go play eggs for Bart because it actually had a chapter 3, and you thought there were only 2 chapters, so go play chapter 3, please, because I saw the other youtubers play it except for you
Amanda is a Jojo's villain. All animals die around her, especially dogs.
Ngl this is the first game which made me scared this year not while playing but watching a video on it
I think that in the tape where rebbeca (Amanda) is saying some weird words it almost feels like a chant or like trying to summon a demon. That’s why the man who was making her do that had such a weak explanation to what it meant.
No one going to mention he thought wooly was spelt wolly?
41:05
P go parents School
48:50I’m betting the dude behind the camera’s wooly
Bro the music notes at 7:27 spell out FACADE
I have to say, from where they began with a small game in Dreadxp and now it's its own full game. Possibly with a sequel planned in the future. They really made great improvements! The one improvement I really approve of is the voice acting! Amanda and Wooly really had amazing impactful lines. Amanda talking about the abandoned kitten, Amanda in the glitched town, Amanda talking about the name of her friend she can't remember. Wooly wanting the birthday gift, Wooly getting "tripped", Wooly being nervous at the doctors the first time, Wooly defending Amanda in the butchers shop, Wooly and Amanda in the rotting episode, Amanda and Wooly at the doctors the second time. I was really surprised with the emotions behind those lines. On my second time watching a full play through of the game it still gets me a little bit.
Maybe try saying yes to wooly when he asks you if you trust him? I think it was the tape you found in the cake. Maybe it'll work if you type faster?

Why is this game so extremely unsettling
The End? ending figure looked like a Hazmat Unifrom more then a detective
I’d be watching this in 4K 60 fps and I HELLA ENJOY THIS Ryan you always be making me smile and laugh even made me laugh so hard I just can’t breath lol but hope your day is an absolute fantastic
I looked it up. Apparently Hamlin is a town in Germany. Idk what to do with this info.
46:33 I'll bet that hurt to type
Cool bro
I want to adopt Wooly.
When Amanda the Adventurer was first on the internet, I really thought it was going to be one of those crappy but overly popular things like Garten of BanBan. But honestly, It's actually quite decent. I'm surprised and pleased at the same time, and I really hope to see on how the series will continue.
I'm watching this at night and I'm scared I keep saying what the poppy play time is this cause the 1st 1 literally reminded me of poppy playtime like what the heck I'm scared Of the game nothing else I unplug your butt Plus I'm wearing earbuds And it's not night I don't like it but I meant to it for some reason😅
Most likely the signing in the tape with her, is a contract, most likely a NDA for what happened next.
Hey Ryan. Did you try helping Amanda instead of wooly. Don't know if someone else commented it but might be worth a shot.
Did anyone notice that when he paused it on the tornado waring screen it said OHIO
1:23 Ryan's face of genuine disappointment LMAO
To be honest you are hunting me. with this cereal
This cracked me up 18:22
this game makes me feel unsafe.
7:00 I shivered like never before
this took scary to a new level
46:04 "LEAVE" plus Among Us.
@47:01 I Can Somehow See That Becomeing A Meme Now....
RYAN, YOU NEED TO REACT TO URBANSPOOK, PLEASE IT'S SO GOOD
this game actually freaked me out THIS IS ONE OF THE SCARIEST GAMES EVER
Number 13 trending for gaming
Her secret probably means she was killed and buried somewhere
Also I think my theory is that the red coat guy is Sam which probably explains why he disappeared, I think Sam wanted to hide from the world so he can try to find a way to stop the entity that is processing Rebecca, so I think Sam would be in the sequel trying to help us  I’m not sure if the early demos are canon but I feel like the guy who tried to burn the tape only to be stopped by the Amanda entity was probably the guy before his soul got transferred to wooly, and since that wooly was killed the main protagonist in the demos before Riley was targeted by the entity and the entity used him as the next soul for wooly  That’s my theory
Type in Rebecca.
This is not a horror game where I screamed or get jumpscared much. But what's worse is that it gave me chills , *literal* chills like something is crawling up and down my spine throughout the whole game.  This is not like FNAF, or like other games where you got frightened the wits out of you by jumpscares or stuff like that. It's the game where it brings out the worst fear in you as a human being: Not knowing the unknown; the future, and what it has in store for you.  Another great game to watch Ryan play it, and another sigh of relief from me when I realized the fear would be much worse if I watch this late at night.
This more like friendly game
wow u also got bob ending :DDDDDDDD
And Rebecca is Amanda.
TO GET THE LAST TAPE YOU NEED TO BAKE THE PEACH AND YOU GET A ORANGE AND BROKEN TAPE
the names that rebecca was saying as "a few simple words" were plays on demon names. pie man being paimon, baa lamb being baalam, and bye yell being bael (i think that's how you say it??). i think the man from her headphones was either a demon or someone in her head that only she can hear.   also this game is awesome. i love it.
duolingo+dora
Your Kate because she gave you the cake
Bro really typed wolly
In
Under in my bed
Am I only one watching this under the covers
I wonder if the “Home movies” is a reference to the movie sinister
35:26
I never thought I would say this, but this game is somehow actually scary.
I love the evolution of Amanda the Adventurer! It started off a small game like the ring. And now is a fully fledged multiple ending video game that actually has some disturbing and uneasy moments! As it’s supposed to. I really hope they make more games like this in the future.
You have to hack the game for find the six tape
The muscial notes say "F A C A D E" in the back (I play violin :3) ((little edit I commented this before I watched the rest of it!!))
49:09 I feel that figure at the end of the vid is Kate, who else would know where the protagonist was? Either she found the protag or the protag got stuck in the same realm Kate got sent too
Pause the vid around 0:22... It's baby Ryan...
Honestly, this game surprised me. Like, the demos did not hook me at all and felt at the time like it was trying to cheapen its success from the recent friend of episodic (incomplete) horror games like Poppy Playtime and Bendy before it. But damn, they really made this game feel existential almost and made Amanda a real, sympathetic character.
The man in the headphones is Ryan
amada is lost she say im out there somewhere i think
38:40
Bye yell: Bael Pie Man: Paimon Baa Lamb: Balaam  I think these are all Canaanite deities.
Wooly might be a metaphor for us, or maybe the kids, maybe even the viewers in general...a sheep and Amanda's friend which is why wooly doesn't have a specific name
Super specific question, does anyone know the music ryan has playing in the background at the end of the video? I recognize it, but i cant put my finger on it and it is drivng me insane... Something FNAF????
Help Amanda instead of Wooly
me angry at Ryan because he never put Kate in the farm tape 😡
more pizza tower when
Hey! Just a quick question, but do you have some sort of playlist you have which you choose music to put into the video? I've always wondered that, I'd love to know.
Hey 8-bitryan do you remember undertale well there is kinda a sequele its called delterune could you please play it thx again ps ur vidios are asome
You know when Ryan uploads vid it's gonna be good for our breakfast
If she really does listen from outside the tv, then she can probably hear the robot speak as well. Maybe messing with that can be useful or a waste of time 😂.
if my imagenation came true... i will use my imagenation to destroy the demon and save wooly... i wanted everyone to have peace in my imagenation for so long... either for 5 or 7 years... I have been imagening everyone being peaceful for so long... and if all of it came true that i can make my imagenation become real... i will balence the universe and finally allow everyone have freedom...   yours truly... - james lee
I think hameln actually took sam out the picture if you know what I mean
I’m not going to lie but think noodles missed everything you did so i think you’re a better youtuber
Ryan the tape you got the last code fore the robot had a temperature for the oven maybe there is the time for the oven somewhere near that
What happens if you help Amanda during the 2nd accidents tape?
Note that the things Rebecca repeats in the one studio tape sound like demon names, Bael = Bye Yell Paimon = Pie man Balam = Baa lamb Pretty interesting huh
goofy ahh dora
They got her signing  her own parent  consent  form👀 @12:20
35:13 the cake is a lie
I suspect the girl in the orange tape disappears because the door serves as a white portal, which the parents don't see I also get the impression that Sam's disappearance is him becoming Wooly, as he talks ad-nauseum about his love of the coffee break cookies, and Wooly is revealed to love cookies
Man.. I wish we can save wooly I really wanted to save him so bad
Good, now play The Return to Bloody Nights :D
If I wanted people to release me, I'd play the victim, not the villain.
2:11 punisher reference!?! 😳😳😳
I think a it’s brainwash I think she is and I think that’s why sam got missing That’s creepy.  Rebecca
🔥
Maybe to get the final type you have to help Amanda instead of wooly in that tape called "oh no accidents" otherwise, I'm not sure how to get the final tape.
It’s set in Kensdale, Ohio. Meaning that this is the most normal cartoon in Ohio
I honestly watched MatPat's video first, he never finished, but did find a video with a silent interview.  The only thing he did was use the peach for 40 min instead of 30, I might have missed if you played it though.
Ü
Hi ☺️👋☺️
DADDY RYAN HELP IM SCARED
Hey Ryan awesome video its good to see someone get all the endings and awesome theorizing I thought maybe the fedora guy at the end could be the one security guard in the one tape that opens the door or the guy that was videoing rebecca saying those lines maybe he was a mole in the company and wanted to expose them also I just wanted to recommend that bramble the mountain king came out today and its amazing you should check it out its so similar to little nightmares
This game genuinely gets my lore brain tingling.
Bob
brooo this gives me hella duck season vibes...
Ya
Caught in 4K saying the F  bomb
It would be cool if there was a Five Nights in Amanda the Adventurer
F in chat for our robot friend.. he will not be forgotten.
18:23 Wilhelm scream!
Howd he spell wooly wrong
Fun Fact: 28:01 When ryan know that characters, he mention from game call "Chip's Tips".
idk if anyone else said this but I almost wonder if Sam is Wooly, I mean they kind of sound alike and they both don't really like whats going on
Hey I love all your videos and I’m always excited the next day for a new one keep up the good work 8 bit Ryan
Put Sam where we usually put rooster
I was thinking wooly would come back to stop Amanda or we get sucked into the game and we help wooly or we are actually sam   Or the monster is hunter us down and then wooly comes out of the show and helps us
Just finished the video and my theory might be that wooly could be that one guy that was evasdropping its wooly is always self conscious of Amanda's true intentions which seams to add up because if that one guy didn't see the producers true intentions he wouldn't have evasdropped would he?
Maybe the guy in the hat is Sam 49:22
to be honest im loved Ryan reaction 😂
My thoughts on Wooly Is that he came from the guy who was caught filming. In the news tape It said that Wooly's read a thon was cancelled, and this was said after the guy was caught. Before Hamlin took over Amanda's Adventures, Sam didn't mention a character named Wooly. To back up my point: The man who was interviewed In the news said "My kids are still really Into that show, but It has changed. I mean, I walked In the other day and Amanda was talking about how mommies and daddies aren't always right." Sorry for my bad English.
Everyone sharing their theories I’m gonna share mine. Rebecca and the Entity (the thing that attacks/Captures you in the bad endings) share the vessel of Amanda. It’s the constant switching of tone that does it for me. Some instances have her be cruel and taking joy in tormenting wooly while other times she’s confused scared and sad/somber. I’m fairly certain that the Entities abilities are tied to Rebecca’s emotional state and the times when she’s distraught give it the strength to escape but it’s power possibly varies depending on how negative her emotions are. Like at the one Kitten part where Amanda has a breakdown everything in the Tape is going to insanity and Amandas model has the Entities eyes showing what I can only assume it taking the wheel and crawling right after you. I also believe that the release of it comes when 3 tapes have been played unless tampered by the outside world in which case the entities has to break Rebecca down even harder since it’s being thwarted. I also have a feeling the Red Haired doll is another vessel but it’s for Rebecca specifically to give you a tape or the batteries/ help you a bit. And at the Secrets tape she can take full control of the area and basically kick you out but also preventing the creature to influence you more. As for Wooly I feel like he’s some strong willed soul/ one of the first victims (Maybe that one kids brother from the letter) and he works with Rebecca to keep the entity from killing to a Limited success. Annnd that’s all I got atm but if you have anything you wanna throw into this crockpot feel free.
You should help Amanda when she is holding wooly down and see what happens
To be honest, Ryan My handwriting sucks as well. Everybody in my class can’t read it except for the teacher.
What happens if you help Amanda instead of wooly
Kittendgxb te snedjj ku de la semaine prochaine pour les vacances pour
WAIT NO AMANDA WAS SIGING SOMETHING TO BE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO BE IN THE GAME
Im guessing there will probably be another one
Kitttteeen
Yoga to death
9:09 😮 Ryan!!!  😠
Ryan, your deduction skills are the scariest part pfff, how you can so quickly figure things out
3-8-2002 is my birthday, how funny.
I feel like something is missing. There must be an update to this game, I kinda wished there were more tapes, even those missing from demos.
I think instead of helping wooly when he was being fixed maybe help Amanda.
Actually during the secret tape where Rebbeca is in the room saying stuff, they are ACTUALLY tricking her into saying names of DEMONS, probably to connect to the entity in the first Ending 48:03
honestly i think hameln wanted the show because they saw how popular it was. ofc we see that the dad doesnt like what they are doing and i can assume at some point they took him out which is why hes missing. and that then Rebecca is Amanda. just like how u got trapped in that world in that one ending. they trapped rebecca in the show obv as amanda and this is also why her meet up appearances were cancelled because obv shes trapped in the show.   side note: idk why but i have a suspicion that wooly is the dad who went missing, not to sure what role kate plays yet tho
See what happens if you help Amanda take out woolys brain
When the mommy chicken ate the baby chick I was so surprised I it caught me off guard.😅
9:44 Wolly 🐑💀
Hey Ryan I’m sorry I’m late to the video but anyways how’s your day goin?
9:14 I respect that you made up for and showed some sincerity it’s small but is effective in real life
Actual place in real life if you didn’t know that place where something something is buried I don’t know it’s confusing, but it is a place in real life so who knows
Damn, this is disturbing
Been watching Ryan for over 3yrs and somehow just realized how good his lighting is 😮
I'm thinking that the strawberry banana pancakes have something to do with the last tape, maybe by putting them, the strawberry and banana, into the pie tin and oven that maybe thats where the last tape is
Why haven't people tried choosing to help Amanda instead of wooly in the surgery scene
In the previous video, there was that news article about a Celtic relic being stolen. Could be that connected to Hameln, and possibly why this VHS series has a supernatural element to it?
If you go at the rooster part put sam colton to get mee paths of this game.
Ryan this was an AMAZING playthrough my guy. Top 5!
Ryan can you record you finishing fnf imposter v4 I want to watch you beat finale plz play the mod and record it plz
maybe the detective is sam
dang got it before Cory
If you watch CoryXKeshins video about this game you can see that he found out the extact times to put on each clock
Hey man, if you would like to react to some Analogue horror videos, I really recommend you go and react to UrbanSPOOK's series. It's really well made and disturbing.
Amanda definitely not a animal abuser
I am stunned in how amazing this game is
I think we need to look back at the previous versions of this game from GameJolt and the demo for the lore to make sense.
18:23 Bro the yelling effect made 10x Better OML
This is nightmare fuel
Amanda is scary 😵hope their is DLC must save wooly🙂
Hey can you play Zelda tears of the kingdom when it comes out it looks amazing and I’d love to see your reaction to it 😊
9:46 Who is "wolly"?
fedora guy could be sam btw as hes missing so a ghost which is possible with the long trench coat, he found riley as we were tryna stop the tapes like he wants to....
When the doll screamed when you chopped of her head I was like, "NUUUUUUUUUUU" and when she said, "Thank you, that's my favorite flower." just warmed my heart.
Ryan spelling Woolys name wrong and unintentionally finding secrets is hilarious to me
Did you try clicking Amanda when it asked “which one of us will you help” when she’s doing surgery on wooly or does it do the same  thing?
You made my childhood, man!
He didn't help Amanda kill wooly that's another option
When she said “The man with the headphones” I just noticed that u had headphones on you so she was talking to you?😅
49:10 bad theory time! I think that is Sam getting angry at the player for destroying the TV, maybe she was trying to escape the hell she was in but you ruin it by throwing the brick. He hides himself because of the guilt he has on himself for his daughter.
Wolly
hey Ryan I have an idea(don't read this comment yet if your not done with the video yet, it's big spoilers)                              try and help amanda in the tape where wooly "has an oppsie"
24/7 in words is wrbu
I think Sam Houston wasn’t buried,I think Amanda was because she said “sometimes I feel  like I’m rotting…” and she said “I’m out there” so maybe she is out there rotting.I personally think Rebecca is Amanda because if you read the notes it makes for sense
14:05 did he really said "por favor"?
Will you continue Dead island 2? Just wondering
SORRY MAN I WAS AT SCHOOL FREAK I MISSED IT Love you man
Sam escaped the Amanda world
I have a slight feeling that wooly might be that man in the headphones Rebecca was talking to, because she might have found out that the producers of the show were plotting against Sam, so after saying those weird chants that sound like demon names apparently, she became the demon monster thing fueled by rage lurking in the show, she may have somehow dragged that person into the vhs realm to exact her revenge on him, i mean Amanda was treating Wooly as poor as she possibly could, not letting him have a voice, passive aggressively remarking Wooly isn't her friend, psychologically torturing Wooly, injuring Wooly and saying it was an "accident of him tripping", and especially how Amanda drugged Wooly and killed him in the operating room, and I guess that after you (the player kept trying to tick her off) she brings her monster form into the real world to exact revenge upon you as well in the bad ending. I dunno tho, maybe that detective will bring some light on the situation in the sequel if they make one. Wooly showed that he had signs of sentience, trying to guide you through the tapes and all, so if he was Sam, I feel like he would have just told her in the vhs realm who he is and Wooly wouldnt have been mistreated or straight up murdered, yet he got mauled by Amanda, and it seemed like Amanda was even a little happy he was killing Wooly without a shred of remorse or mercy. maybe him being headphone guy is why Wooly's va was never said in the credits. Just a theory
This might be a reach, but I really think the robot and wooly are one in the same. Like just think about it
10:48 the music notes are "F A C A D F. I think you play that on the piano       Edit: I realized after that you did play it on the piano...
Dang that was fast Ryan very nice
find the tape in the bobot
What if Sam got turned into Wooly?
Hey, I have “found” the 6th tape and manlybadasshero is someone who found it so it’s a tape of wooly sitting and doing nothing and then a ☝️😮 expression then back down.
I have an idea, what if you get the Hollow Ending? Maybe something different would happen where the man isn't there and you get a new tape? I don't know if you've done this already or not.
What if wooly is Sam and Amanda just hated him because of family issues. She wanted to oof him because she is just a little kid and doesn’t know any better
Bro at 18:23 i laughed so hard
Next time in the oven mystery put the peach
imma say a theory i just thought  Amanda Said She is talking to the "man" or a "kid"in the headset it MAYBE be the character ryan playing when those option to say "yes" or "no" it kinda makes sense if tou think abt it 😅
Hey Ryan. What happens if when Amanda and Wooly struggle on the gurney that you select helping her instead of Wooly? Will that do something? 🧐
I don't think Rebecca is the evil one here. I think that somehow she ended up with some sort of supernatural/paranatural ability involving her voice before Sam adopted her (there are mentions of "what she's been through"), and Hameln decided to exploit that ability for their own ends by using technology to replicate her voice- but something went very wrong, and Amanda, the character in the show, somehow grew beyond what she was meant to be into a monster who can see and act beyond the limitations of being a recording (hence being a multi-eyed monstrosity). The times where she shows remorse or sadness may be some echo of Rebecca showing through.
i think you have to help Amanda when shes killing wooly to get the 6th tape
Dead Island ✊
Instead of helping wooly help Amanda
Dead Island
Please just spell the name right 😭
I love how invested Ryan is in this game. This game probably would have gone unnoticed if he didn't play it so many times.
Hey thank you for making content I’ve been going through a lot in my life and this helped me make today just a little bit easier. I think I can say for all of us thank you Ryan❤ much love and keep going your doing amazing work
i wonder if anything happens if you put "kate" when amanda says whats the oppisite of alive
What happens if the detective is Sam?
I think the creator of Amanda is stuck in the tv and trying to escape because at the end there’s a dude who is pounding at the screen
The part where you could choose who you want to help, I think there you can get a different ending, but sadly I don't think there is a way at all to save wooly, since the start he was a complete goner.
I want someone to put sam or Kate when she ask if anything rots or something like that
Anyone else get the feeling that the player has more control than in the demos?
I hate it when people pretend they know things but they just google how to get endings/secrets. It really makes the fun of finding things on your own boring and especially watching someone get there answers of the internet. I should not even be watching this kids content lol.
I watched Matpat play this before and was very intrigued and actually surprised I didn’t think of the whole pied piper thing. Anyone else?
tbh i think amanda is trapped in some way and wooly is a sort of warden. amanda keeps referring to not being in control yet wooly tries his best to undermine her. Wooly for sure seems more malicious than it seems. I believe amanda is trapped somehow and just like a kid is lashing out. especially when she says she's out there somewhere.
26:41 Valid.
My man needs to fix his handwriting and go to college
if you see this ryan! 'this place is not happy' made a new upload you should check out :)
"He's aware of Rebecca" I should hope tf so, he's her dad xD
Ryan's theories are blowing my mind
When ever I was at 35:03 and was trying to connect my consul, I swear I saw a reflection of someone walking up to me😦 my heart dropped
I swear the fact that Amanda knows her friend is dead is scary and quite depressing
Burn the tape by putting one it the oven or turn on the oven and see if you burn the house down
Try making the peach pie again, it is a random thought but maybe there is an orange tape?
I'm gonna shit myself
When you get to the tape where Amanda hurt wooly when she asks who can help when you get hurt you have to type in 'Nobody'
Don’t know if anyone has already said this but Hameln is a reference to the Pied Piper story, take that as you will
There's a few... oddities that stand out to me.  1. Why does a cartoon company need some sort of researcher? And what did they have Amanda... idk, sign?  2. Why are the specific words used when reading the script eerily similar to the pronunciation of demons?  3. Who was the buried body in the demo? (My money is it's Sam)  4. Who actually is Wooly? Judging by how they act, they know Amanda personally. We also know Amanda is human though later possessed. Whoever Wooly is, they are in a position where they want to genuinely help her, but also feel comfortable enough to attempt to put their foot down, even if it fails. I doubt Sam.  5, Why does the demon get so peeved when we refuse to help the kitten? It's so unique that theres a failure condition here, where the "right" choice is saying yes. This needs to be looked into.  6. The demon obviously got sick of wooly's shenanigans, so they made him a background prop. Yet, they bring him back for an episode, then kill him off completely again. Why? Possibly a warning, followed by the punishment.  7. The demon is not all powerful. Wooly was almost able to directly communicate with the viewer, before the tape fuzzes and goes back to the episode.  8. Why not directly attack us when Amanda is trying to break out? We know from the other endings the monster is nearby and knows where we are, perhaps already in the house. Why tell us she (or rather the demon) is out there as a threat? Just for it's amusement?  9. The player has control over the tapes, somewhat. We can change them to an extent, but we don't match to whatever is torturing and possessing Amanda.  - Note cause im typing this as I go; I think amanda was kidnapped. Theres no news about her being sent to family, and the way the company talks about her on that written statement it almost sounds like they dont want anyone looking for her. Is she what's buried? I vaguely remember that perhaps only those who summon the demons that were named can be banished by who called them, but I'm most likely completely wrong here. -  10. The sentience of nearby objects. Is it the tapes doing? Are they tied to it, directly or indirectly? Is it the tape giving them life, or something else trying to help the player?  11. We still don't know the circumstances of sam's disappearance. I think he was murdered. The way the person recording the demon summoning tape freaked when the door opens tell me not only do they know something wrong here, but they know the punishment of getting caught, which points to the company being... lethal, in it's methods. I think sam is ultimately dead, and not wooly at this point.  12. How does it snatch children on a dime? We know that it can snatch, but we still had to approach the exit, and in the first bonus tape we saw where the girl vanishes, there was practically no time for anything.  - Note: Realization; each tape is someone else, maybe? I think Amanda's ice cream comment was from the girl herself, not "Amanda" who was the demon initially. Do they need to snatch people to be released in a physical form? Why is wooly the same person then? unsure.  13. What was the guarded room?  14. Who is setting things up for us? The tape?  15. The rot section feels especially important to me. Someone Amanda knew has died. Not been snatched, but died. Again, I think this is Sam.
17:42 I want soem of what that house having gang 💀
8:06 there's an oder to the houses
This Theory doesnt make sense and im not good with making them  so uh heres my theory:  (SPOILERS)     Theres a comment that explains why Amanda was singing weird "lyrics". (Creds to SOZOMUCI) Bye Yell means "Bael" Pie man means "Paimon" (and i dont wanna hear genshin comments. screw off.) and Baa lamb is Baalam.   Okay, so, Sam went missing, and i think that when the director was making Rebecca say the demon names, i think she was then trapped in the show. after that, it made Sam go missing. Rebecca is supposed to be Amanda (ofc) and The Entity that she summoned is making her go insane and making her think ur the one who made Sam go missing. Wooly knows about this and keeps trying to tell you where Sam is, but he fails because the Entity is always on him.   I Personally think that Wooly was probably the Camera guy that was recording at the door, When the camera guy tried to escape the Director found the camera guy and trapped them inside the show/game too. I dont know, i dont think it makes sense either, now that i think about it, how would the camera guy know where sam is? unless, the camera guy has been spying on the Hamlen (i forgor what their called). And the Hamlen company has probably been planning Sam's disappearance ever since the show/game was getting popular, thats why the Camera guy knows.   so uh thats my theory :')
This is really giving me chills Frfr
This has to be the most haunted game ever made
Dude Kanye it's like the future and she's done being bad ands shes now depressed NEW LOREEEE
Bro just said: "I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair.  It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. Tt absolutely moved my soul , and i don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a piece of bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a bacon I have ever seen especially on 17:24. I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon.

This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you." 💀💀💀💀

This is a certified spook classic.
I love blabot,it’s voice sounds like a friendly fella
HE FINISHES THE GAME A DAY LATER, HOW IS HE SO GOOD??
I don't understand this game ? Sometimes amanda kills you  And sometimes amanda is trying to brake free  Like is there 2 versions of her ? Or is she split by half ? Or wait  Maybe the monster is her true body And the cartoon is another demon
A
Wooly might possibly be that person who was spying on the director and Sam when Rebecca was doing the voice lines perhaps, they caught him, and they put him in the show or something as a prisoner and that's why he has no name in the credits?
Amanda: Wait how do yo-
I think sam is the hooded man, it would make sense because that ending only happens when you collect all of the coloured tapes. Which goes into the background of the show.
Let’s play football
Bro, just like the voice actress for mommy long legs. This actress that plays Amanda really needs a pay raise
And my way of thinking is why Sam disappeared is because he got sucked in like the kids did and became wooly. It makes sense
Who you think is the investigator is Amanda’s dad Sam
Game suggestion: Ultrakill
When is the next dead island vid
i actually really like this game, really cool gameplay and lore
47:26 BRO WOOLY'S FACE WHEN RYAN TYPED SAM WAS SO PRICELESS WTF
personally i think the detective is sam because if you look at his neck he has a little more of a dark tone like sam and they never found where sam was.
Lore theory: at 8:46 Amanda couldn't control what was happening with her world, and that resulted in her to snap and lose it, and then she gave up, until wooly talked her out of breaking more fourth wall schtuff
Who was that random people near the ending of the game
Justice for Wooly man😭
Mmm yes wolly
If you don't for the brick at the TV it goes in a loop
Wow
At 48:05 I think the director is getting Rebecca to recite the names of demons, “Bye yell” is Bael, “Pie man” is Paimon, not sure what “Baa lamb” is.   Pretty sure “the man in the headphones” is a demon too
play minecraft plz
I just want to say rayan I love your videos the amount of brain cells you have is incredible
Guys the cake was a lie
Imagine if wooly turned on amanda and became the entity and captured her lol
In the first video wooly gets hurt and you said nobody but you can spell doctor and Amanda please try it!
I think the director actually tricked her into chanting some sort of demonic ritual which may be why she is trapped in the show
Hi Ryan
I thought he was coryxkenshin lol😂
I feel like Amanda is not the villain here... i feel like someone else has made or done this to her for her to be like this
If you want to save wooly  👇🏻
🔥👍🏼
Me playing the game and get's to we can share tape:   Amanda: ''Im out there. Somewhere.'' ME THINKING SHE MEANS THAT SHE'S BEHIND ME:''WHAT THE FU-''
Day of asking 176 to play Skyrim
So I have two questions real quick, and people are more than welcome to answer the first one if they know. What happens if you choose to help Amanda instead of Wooly in the hospital? The other thing, in the part 1 video in one of the tapes while it was flickering at the credits, there was a "containment expert" or something, whats that about?
So cool game
now get the other secret ending
Every time I see a sad or hurt cat in a game or movie or anywhere I have to go pet mine
Destroying the TV was the good ending
Bro, Matpat gonna have a field day with this one lol
Dude this is a creepy game but you handle the gameplay well
Why aren’t you making any dead island videos
Am I seriously the only one who thought that the security guard with the real life Amanda tape actually kinda looked like Walter White
Bro I Swear Ryan You And Me Are The Only One Who Thinks Wooly's Got Your Back Like Yeez!😅Keep Up The Good Work Ryan!❤
I think the dude in the coat is sam? Just a guess
and to think this all started out as a small portion of a 3RG video about a year ago!
You play as Kate in game
MORE DEAD ISLAND 2 PLS
You all how this game is extraordinary phenomenal just how long well made this game really has gone. Thanks for getting all the endings and secrets, Ryan man
"this is fun! animals make funny sounds!"   *"do you have a family..?"*
Alright I've seen the comments so now it's my turn to take a crack at the lore **Spoilers if you haven't finished the video yet so click away now**     Okay so let's start at the meat man, a year or two back MatPat had a theory about the eyes on the objects being the souls of the victims, and this seems to confirm this. But what I think is, bare with me, the form you take in depends on when you were forced into the tapes. Listen, when we see Wooly and Amanda in places such as the kitchen, meat store, and other places with small objects, not all of them have eyes, yet we've seen before in other places where objects DO have eyes, even if they're small. This being said, I believe the tapes have a capacity, and once the capacity is reached, the souls move on to the next tapes. If we take the early tapes, they have significantly less souls/eyes in them, this could be because of the length, the longer the tape the large capacity. But let's move on; In the last video Ryan made, Amanda says something along the lines of "Sometimes, I can feel myself rotting." My theory here is that the monster, demon, whatever, is taking her over, killing her. It's happening slowly though, and evolves throughout the tapes. But because the tapes are old, Amanda is already gone by then, at least, her body is. I think this because in the last tape, she hesitates on her name, almost as if she's forgetting it, and her secret being "I'm out there... somewhere" Feels as if she is not herself, or that she doesn't know where she is because she can't remember. We also see her become more demonic throughout the tapes, recall that when Ryan set the oven on fire with the pause, she and wooly were genuinely terrified, screaming, however as we see her progress, she becomes angrier at you for not picking the right answer, as well as becoming indifferent and kind of.. happy... when she sees blood, and even killing Wooly only saying "I can do it myself" and "Go away." In the same tape at the very beginning, her voice is demonic, as well as her actions. But the "Go Away" could be the actual Amanda attempting to stop the demon, or at least in a last ditch effort. Moving On, Kate, and the BlabBot, There is definitely a connection, as we here "Give my condolences to Kate" from Blabbot, as well as her being mentioned in Coffee Break. I'm unsure of what it could mean at the time of writing this but I know there is something there. Next I wanna talk about the tapes, we know there is a sixth tape considering the missing slot, this could be either a specific word or phrase you have to use as an answer in the tapes, like with the demos, or something with the oven, since those are our only versatile options at the moment. I think once we finally find it, the detective will be a part of it like Ryan mentioned. It's possible he had to investigate Hameln, or Sam dissapearing, and therefore found the tapes, but that's all I can think of at the moment. I have more but I'll have to rewatch. Great stuff as always Ryan
This is a very scary Dora the Explorer clone I've ever seen!
49:22  OI KIDDO ARE YOU OKAY?! I HEARD GLASS BREAKING IS THERE A FIRE? LET ME GET YOU OUT OF HERE
amanda amanda amanda how you killed wooly, 191951
Hey just wanted to say loved the video but what happens if u throw the brick somewhere else besides the TV keep up the great work
Happy to see your back at it for this game again! I hope your ready for the ends, mostly the secret ending! I'm hype to see your reaction! Keep up the amazing work Ryan!👍🏽😄❤
8-bitryan can you play Soulshatters? just a suggestion....
I think Sam gets trapped in the videos as the weird looking farmhouse, that’s why Sam is an option for the chickens
Inst the old irl tapes show.. the neighborhood of that missing duagther?
what do you think will happen if you choose to help Amanda instead of wooly when she tried to do brain surgery
Huh..
You could also choose the side of amanda instead of wooly in the scene where wooly was killed to see what happens
On time.....yay
Dude Ryan. Your adhd kicks really in this Video. You dont really concentrate you try so much to fill every second with words. In this Video it was really hard to listen to every : yea omfg mh yeah yeah cool omfg oooh ooooh. You didnt sold it well
Yes Ryan i would love to hear more of what you think about the games and discuss it's story.
Lesson of the story?  Don’t watch random goddamn VHS tapes or things like this happen!
I like that after all these years he still puts liek instead of like
I´ll just guess that Wooly is Amandas/Rebeccas best Friend and first Victim?   But maybe we´ll find out in the future
43:51 I wonder what happens if you don’t break the TV
53:19 There's that part where Amanda says "I'm out there... somewhere" and that's when her voice doesn't sound as playful as she regularly does, it even sounds as if she were in the same room as the person playing the tapes and she kinda has a sad look. So it might be that the buried body and the location that was showed in an older version of the game is Amanda's body and she died at some point?  But that wouldn't make sense because they never said that in the game so that's why it could be Sam, but then again there are things that they never expanded upon like the mention of Dynakinesis (the bending of reality, we see that Amanda constantly changes things so it fits what she wants, she makes things dissapear or forces you to say things you don't want to).
Okay but has everyone forgot that wooly is allergic to apples-
I'm guessing Amanda is somewhat like a pied Piper
For anyone who doesn't know musical notes, the notes are f a c a d e which of course, says facade
8bitryan🔛🔝
R.I.P Wooly and that kind robot.
43:22 the way the quality changed immediately though
Yeeeaaahhh
Thats just a theory a game theory
Banger video. And solid theory. I'm pretty sure if the mystery ever get's revealed, at least the majority of this theory will be there. Ryan really should include his afterthoughts more, it's always fun to hear what he has to say.
There's one more secret tape. A blue one. I don't know how you get it, but it exists.
There will be a sequel
That’s good lore I got to admit and can’t wait this game to be a YouTube poop
Are you going to play the fnaf games again I got some for you five nights at sonics, five nights at candies five nights at Mickey’s love your videos by the way, your try not to laugh videos and the Reddit videos are my favorites you can beat the return of bloody night I know you can do it.
54:50 what is the music called?
Ryan I dare you to play ULTRAKILL (gore can be turned off, dont worry)
you didnt get all the endings
Ryan: “What’s a family?” Also Ryan: *”I don’t know”*
Dead island 2?
This game just keeps getting better and better. Really hope they keep updating it with more stuff. I want more lore on Wooly and Sam...like where is he. And what has really happened to Kate and Riley..so much to keep building on.
Oh yeah, just got out of school and Ryan posts bootleg dora! YES!
If you were wondering the guy in the red siut with fedora is Sam.
When you come across the petting zoo episode put Sam for dada roosters
POOR WOOLY DON'T DESERVE THISS
PLOT TWIST, good sir! That seemingly delicious looking   r a t   actually carries the Black Plague! You have now accidentally aliven't due to a tricky little rodent!
I'm glad this episode is out so soon 🎉
2ch 43kw 7.6kl
If you chose help Amanda you would of seen the longer scene wooly dies oof there was no blood
what
Hey, just to let you know, there is actually a 6th tape, but I'm not sure how you are actually able to get it, maybe it unlocks after you've gotten all endings?
If this gets pinned I will coat myself in beans.   SUPPORT THE CAUSE 🫘🫘
The conference room in the IRL tape was Amanda signing a contract
i love it
The lore is gonna be insane, MatPat is gonna have a field day
okay I'll come back but it's 4 AM so I can't watch it alone. actually a bit scary lmao
Omg thanks Ryan for this love your videos so much!!
I don’t know if anyone pointed this out but I’m going to anyway, to help Ryan understand what Rebecca was reading: The weird words that she was reading are actually pronounciations of various demons. Bye Yell is Bael, Pie Man is Paimon, and Baa Lamb is Baalam. Basically the director is making her summon a demon by doing this.
I honestly feel like Wooly might be Sam(the father) because often times he redirects us when Amanda starts tweaking. It seems he’s the voice of “reason”. Such as in the secret tape when Rebecca is reading off the script, Sam sounds worried and speaks for Rebecca saying “she’s upset”. Wooly does similar things by telling us “she’s confused”. When at the post office, after typing in the name ‘Kate’, Wooly is also visibly upset, like he knows her too. Also when you mention Sams name at the farm part she gets angry- she's also always mean to Wooly. It could be a stretch.
Bro wooly going through HELL
Day 54 of asking Ryan to play ULTRAKILL. I always seem to be late to his uploads, so liking this comment would be much appreciated, to maybe get him to see it. It's a fast-paced boomer-shooter inspired by games like Quake, Doom, and the Devil May Cry series. It's also made by the folks over at New Blood, the same ones who made Dusk and FAITH: The Unholy Trinity.   MANKIND IS DEAD. BLOOD IS FUEL. HELL IS FULL.
Bro the game just came out💀
18:23 That & the meat shop make me think something more dark than we're expecting happend
When will this man FINISH IMPOSTER V4
Bro did a dear david reference 5:57
I have a theory that Amanda is trapped as well. The demon is keeping her and wooly in the show. Thats why sometimes she would actually seem sad when talking. She has voice lines like "im out there.. somewhere" and "its too late" while looking sad. Maybe the demon could be using her body outside of the tape and occasionally takes control of her In the tapes as well
What is woolly is a human
I don't know why but I feel like wooly is the evil one.
48:07 Bye Yell: Belial Pie Man: Paimon Ba Lamb: Baal 🤨
I think that one tape said "Riley's Fav Movies (short for favorite), witch of ZO (Wizard of OZ), Looking for Beebo (Finding Nemo), and John's Candy Factory (Willy Wonka's/Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Pie man= PAIMON Ba leel= Balel She's trying to say demon names!!!
I'm so glad he posted this so quickly. I can't wait.
Linx 4 did not find any of these secret colored tapes...
When is bro gonna finish return to bloody nights?
I wonder if this is about public TV programming and how much of it now, especially for children, is being cann!bal!zed by corporations and dark funding
Ryan: "And here's your uh, definately not poisinous, safe to eat, you will not die if you consume this, mushroom Luv this part, lol
Aint no eay dream is the secret ending
Ryan was rushing too much and missed a lot of the nuances in the story.
im trying to wonder whats the cause of the "the end?" im thinking of 2 theorys Theory 1: everytime you click continue (which is you coming back to the attic) every time you keep destroying the old tv that plays tapes (because of amanda) you dont remember but you did the same exact thing before but since you replayed the same attic loop over and over again it caused the time line to break and then that person is in. theroy 2 (not really): it is prob a certain chance
Salute to Blababot
the hens do eat their babies from stress
This game is honestly very good, not the prettiest, but that's how it's supposed to be, can't wait to see whats in store
Bro put like a day of work in this video . This man deserves likes🎉
Ryan is very intelligent when it comes to games like this.
I think that with whoever is buried in the forest, might actually be Amanda's body, hence why she says "I'm out there. Somewhere." So, ideas: 1)Her father killed her and buried her in the woods. Maybe he got tired of the director giving his daughter weird instructions. 2)The supposed 'man in the headphones' made Amanda kill her father and bury him. These two things would link into Amanda's soul being trapped inside the series character itself. The first one, she died and her soul entered through one of the tapes as an attempt to stay alive. For the second, the so-called demon entity could have taken her into them, though left her body behind. It could explain why Amanda is actually able to hear and respond to the player/viewer. It's because she's still alive. So if there would ever be a DLC/update/second game, it might involve what was seen in the demos. Going to that forest to burn the tapes, or maybe to find Amanda's/Rebecca's body and set her free. Though, there's still a chance it could be her dad buried there. Or, maybe something entirely different; Wooly. Because again, as shown in the demos, she used the crowbar and rope for something. So maybe she broke into what would be Wooly's house, and killed him. But I'm not entirely sure tho, most of this is just spitballing nonsense in hopes to make sense. But I mean hey, it all sounds likely in my opinion.
Day 80 of asking Ryan to continue Alice Madness Returns.
doesn't the lore also cross the older versions? because if so then the guy in red takes the tapes from us and tries to burn then but can't burn them all and bring back the last tape
THIS CREEPY BRO
Bro did not say Wolly
ngl after watching this video kinda in the mood to bake some cookies 😋
MAYBE WOOLY IS SAM?
I feel so bad for Amanda, I feel like she needs just as much help as Wooly, maybe more…
“I Got assualted by a tape” wise words from Ryan 21:51
Bro didn't help amand with the "patient"...I feel like we missed something important and I can't get my game because I can't buy videogames
when Ryan tried to make the peach pie he actually made the pie wrong and made a brand new tape I've not seen before
Holy cow, man  This is terrifying. You did an amazing job with putting lore together in a way that made it easy to understand
Help Amanda kill wooly maybe that's how you get the pink tape
man for some reason 8-bit ryan give me a good feeling watching him
I don't know why but to me, It felt like Amanda didn't want to kill us. It's almost like she has two sides were she is the evil Amanda when she does surgery on wooly but when she was talking about kitten and herself she felt sad and was like she needed our help as the MC. Also when Ryan said no to hearing her secrets she let us go so easily and was disappointed at our answer. Kinda strange for an evil entity to let us live if you ask me but it seems like there are two of them in the tapes. Maybe the ending will be us saving or at least finding the real Amanda
WOW
Felt like the tape within the interrogation like room was some MK-ultra kinda thing
Also she says "I'm out there somwhere" and in a different tape "sometimes i feel myself rottint but it feels far away" maybe Rebecca is dead and her body is rotting or a actual monster thats rotten to ots core.
Love ur video! Can we pliz have more subnautica:>
35:07 THE CAKE IS A LIE!
Ohh Mat Pat? Here comes a game with looore!
Good
What do you mean this show is weird?This is a show us ohioans watch
Long ryan video ? count me in .,..no wait let me get some snacks first
We don't know who that guy at the end was but I'm intrigued to see more from the developers because this was great. I do have a theory that Sam is the barn with the human breathing and bloodshot eyes. As we saw from the butcher ending adults can get sucked into the show too, assuming the character we play as Riley is an adult. But it looks like when Sam was catching on with what was going on with the company, the company deciding to get Sam sucked into the show as well. I'm only assuming based off the fact you can only type his name in during that scene at the farm in front of the barn, and that out of all the objects and buildings that have eyes, the barn is the only one that doesn't sway back and forth but physically breaths like a human being. The barn also looks at you after you type his name and right before you leave to see the sheep. And based off that interview with Sadie, Sam says that Rebecca(Amanda) has been through a lot even before the adoption, certainly some trauma from being alone, you even unlock an achievement titled Daddy Issues. I don't believe Sam has any ill will towards his daughter though. The company clearly knew something about Rebecca and took advantage of that to create Amanda in the demon form. I'm hoping in the next game we learn more about what the company Hameln was up to and maybe perform some sort of ritual that will set all the people trapped inside the tapes free. Also in the tape where the person was secretly recording what they were doing in the recording studio, Rebecca(Amanda) was saying demon names. Ba lamb - Balam A demon king.
Dude wooly has been through it
this game really makes me uncomfortable, and i've watched a lot of horror games... this game is a masterpiece like, seriously
Also disappointed that there weren’t 4 lights.
😱
I know this game is everywhere but please play Dredge Ryan! You won't regret it!
I think the kids turn into the objects with eyes but the black chalk outlines might be the adults who started asking too many questions. Sam, Kate and the person who wrote to Kate asking for help with the disappearances.
YES!! AND I'M GETTING FOOD TODAY TOO BRO LET'S GOOOO
does the 5th ending tease an upcomming game?
geez, MatPat may be able to get a break if we have more of this! lmao
😃😃😃😃😁😁😁😀😀😀🤓🖒
I feel like every vid he makes brings a smile to everyone’s face keep it up
Bro that house in 18:38 is high as fck
Can you play Concrete Genie next please?
bruh vhs 📼 creeps me out so much! 😰
Theres a big thing in the game with rotting.
26:38 this is the most relstic thing I have seen in any game ever because it's true though ☠️
I've seen a theory where the real body of amanda (so rebeca) is actualy roting somewere far away with her spirit blocked inside the tapes. It would make sense cause at one point amanda ask you if everything rots, if you take too many tries to anser yes after wooly disappear you're forced to say yes and then she say "I think it might be too late" like if it was too late for her. Plus when she say "why wont you help the kitten" it's obviously a reference to herself asking for help to get out of the tapes and when we help the kitten (by clicking the cage) we get stuck inside the tapes.  And remember we dug up a body before in an old version.
Amanda creator found out what the company is doing and they made him go away. Because they were in development when he disappeared
I literally did a spit take when I heard the game say my name for the first time.
Deadly new video! ❤🎉😊
i feel so disturbed after this im never watching kids cartoons man
From 2013 to 2023, I will never stop watching this man, he is always gold.
An hour of Ryan having adhd
In home movies it says 425 on the oven maybe that’s where it is?
Day 239 of asking 8-bit Ryan to play fnf Ben drowned: mic of time 2.0, Wednesday's infidelity 2.0, ddto+, blueballs incident v2, retrospecter 1.75, troubleshooting v2 and impostor v4 part 2
The most dedicated YouTuber of all time
i think amanda is freaking out  because she cant figure out why she is suddenly not the only one in control anymore
There's also those black like figures on the ground during the segment with the 3 shops. Maybe those represent missing kids absorbed into the show?
Sometimes Amanda gives me flashbacks to Little Miss Fortune, especially with “Silly Mr.Fox”
Pied Piper of Hamlin

The mixture of early 3d cartoon animation and live action, did absolutely pretty well. And the part when Amanda said, "I'm out there. Some where.." and then the jumpscare of the screen, literally scare the living daylights out of me. Also the part when the detective in the possible true ending of Amanda the Adventurer after breaking the TV, proves that the detective might know what has happen or what's going on. Hopefully there'll be some follow ups or a possible sequel of Amanda the Adventurer, and also not gonna lie, this whole game literally blew my mind and my expectations.  Absolutely fantastic job to the team behind Amanda the Adventurer for not only make a well made puzzle game, but to actually made a fun, and terrifying game. Props to them, and I can't wait for what the future holds.
When Amanda say something bad happened it made me think of poppy playtime secret game file
Amanda the adventurer isn’t a live action show and it never was. The original version is the tapes you watch. The cartoon version of Amanda and the adventure is something similar to Dora in the sense that you would be expected to say something out loud and they would respond. The tapes would act as a more active version where you can actually interact with it. The cartoon is live which would make it impossible to answer. There is also something to note with the original version of the games since they were included into this game which makes the lore connected.
When Amanda asks what the rooster is called, instead of Sam, should you try Rebecca? It's just a theory, I don't know what happens
bro his face when she said some mommies eat their babies 🤣
the part were wooly acted like a real sheep is funny🤣🤣🤣🤣
You didn't just steal the idea from Manlybadasshero but you also stole the thumbnail.
I was here
so around 48:05 where the kid is saying simple words, i believe that the producers are trying to summon demons. as Bye Yell sounds similar to Bael, Pie Man is Paimon, and Baa Lamb is Balam. all 3 of these are actually 3 of the 72 demons of the ars goetia, and all 3 of them are kings in the ars goetia. this theory could be a stretch but it makes sense when you really think about it as when you make amanda mad, she sends a demonic version of her after you. and also as soon as rebecca is cut off from reading off these words, she mentions a man in the headphones to which sam says there isnt a man in the headphones, so is that potentially one of the 3 mentioned demons speaking to her instead?
Awesome video man! I do weirdly miss the old Amanda voice actor😅
No tape 🥺
Funny how this game is scarier then other indie games.
Day 16 of asking for a Half-Life playthrough.
Where is dead island ep 3 we want more and need more but truly loved this video
I love your intros
Don't know if this has any bearing on it, but the company Hamlin is a reference to the Pied piper of Hamelin.  Look it up if you don't know, Ryan.
So here’s my theories and what I know about the story. Sam adopted Rebecca and started the Amanda the Adventurer show which was a big hit. Then a company called Heimlin or something (too lazy to go back and see the actual name) approached Sam and wanted to turn the hit show into a cartoon. The tape where we see Amanda signing something is most likely her signing a voice contract or something along those lines and she then gets taken to a recording studio. Kate is our aunt and we are Riley who I think is a girl but could be a boy. I think Kate liked what Sam was doing and was trying to help him in any way possible. I think she was the one recording the purple tape. The studio was trying to get Rebecca to say something that I assume is a curse or chant that makes the audience captivated by her voice. But curses always back fire so she probably got possessed by some entity or turned into an entity. Sam and Kate were getting suspicious of this company and I think they were trying to stop them, but the company took both of them out for knowing to much. Kate does say in the letter that begins the game that she will never be seen again. I think Sam is genuine and actually cared for and loved his daughter, but got caught in an evil companies search for wealth and power. Sam could very easily be Wooly simply because he cares a lot for Amanda and almost tries to stop her from doing anything dangerous. I don’t think Amanda wants to be evil but is simply trapped and the entity is forcing her and wooly to do it’s bidding. As for the man in the red coat and hat, idk where he filters in or what his role is. He could be a servant of the entity or company, he’s kinda a curveball. However the achievement or something I saw on FusionZgamer’s channel said something about new friends. So red coat guy could be an ally. That’s all I have as of right now, but I think it’s pretty solid.
I love that Ryan is a details gamer 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 I can count on him to dig and that's part of why I subscribed. Thank you Ryan
Probably somone has said it already but ...... My theory is that is literaly the story of the PIed Piper of Hamelin. The are taking the children, and the "amanda" monsterform looks like a Queen Rat to me
Ima show this to my grade 1 class
At the end, when Amanda stole all the furniture i thought "are we in detroid"
Should you revisiting Indie cross?
Did anybody else notice that at 55:41 Amanda has a blacked out face with human images
Just a weird TV lady with a talking sheep. Don’t think much of it.
Wooly is the brother of amanda
hey are you going to car ey on with dead island
The real Amanda Rebecca signed a sort of contract most likely after her father disappeared and she worked for Hamln.
My question is: how did this show even release, I know later down the line things get weird but… why.
I don’t know if this is fake or real but there is a woolly ending. I don’t know how to find it or anything but I just need to tell you there is a woolly ending.
Amander:Wooly's head is broken Me:What do you mean, if his head was broken he be dead
In the time spent looking for the final few secrets that wasn't in the video, did you help Amanda in the hospital sequence?
Yeah I was wondering why "Amanda's" eyes looked like a Bee Hive... Or like wool when she turns into a monster
I am so hipe to Watch This video i love How This game maken me so scared and amazed bij How the little video’s are Made
Nah this game will make little kids sh.. their pants
Maybe wooly is the first kid that got abducted or mabe the little boy we here about in the note on the board
I was really hoping for an ending where we actually save wooly
Damn Ryan, I've just finished to watch the last video and did you just upload another???? THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK YOU!!! (School librarians, we are here!! Kate we support you!)
This may be long but it's important to the lore.  Something to also keep in mind regarding Wooly is that we don't know who is the real life counterpart to him (or whoever is supposed to play as him). In the first couple of tapes (I think it was in the kitchen and oh no! accidents!) whenever we finish watching those tapes we see the credits of said tape like normal – until you get to the part of the cast. We see that Rebecca is casted as Amanda but nothing for Wooly. We don't see a name associated with Wooly because there is a weird static effect on that section in the tapes (this cut happens immediately after we see Rebecca being associated with Amanda) which completely cuts off the name who casted as Wooly and it then cuts back to credits like normal. This feels intentional.
This game is lowkey trash. good video tho.
The cake was a lie!
Just realized ryan has a unus annus shirt
honestly I don’t think that tbh it looks more of like a demonic chant so like that seems pretty correct
Help Amanda when she is trying to kill wooly
Great video also there is a horror game called the backrooms test 861 you should check it out
Imma need the game theorist to do a video about this gameeee
It might be an old game but can you play deathloop
When I heard the company name is Hameln, my mind immediately went to the Pied Piper of Hamelin, who used his flute to hypnotize the children of a village and take them away from their homes Maybe the director is using the cartoon and Rebecca’s voice as the “flute” to hypnotize the kids watching the show and kidnapping them
The cake is a lie.
Maybe typing Rebecca at some point will get you the final tape. I also think that the man at the end may be Sam and he's going to try and help hoping to save his daughter.
42:30 that's the couch in the first demo I believe that was a demo
I LOVE THIIISS CHAAANNEEEEEELL
The aHhhhHhh mad me crack😂😂
“That isnt funny im sorry bro” LMAOO
OMG I got earlier for this! Love you Ryan!🥰❤❤❤❤ I've finally arrived in the first hour(barely 😅)!
That butcher ending is disturbing  Imagine being trapped like that for who knows how long
what a really nice, fun and nostalgic show, I hope a demon doesn’t climb out of the TV and devours our insides
I wish this game was a little less.. on the nose?
woot I am not alone in taking notes for this game :)
Good work!
Broooo imagine DLC the story of wooly but it then connects with the actual story and at the end wooly tells you what actually happend to Sam and then you meet the real wooly in person freeing him from the Amanda world. that would be so cool
Hmm I have to start with part 1
Watching Ryan struggle to spell wooly killed me
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
me casually thinking when 8bit ryan will play this game again *opens youtube* OH THERES A NEW VIDEO
hi i came EARLY(ish)
YESS ANOTHER UPLOAD BY RYAN LETS GOO! ❤
I feel so bad for woolly he Is stuck in a living hell
such a good video
35:36 I found something 0.25x 3 frames after
So ready
How did u spell “Wolly” wrong when his name was in the text as “wooly” 😭
cant wait to watch this after school!!
I was looking for another video from you on this but couldn't find any other then after I came back from a break I saw that you uploaded it 39 minutes ago , Awesome video!
0:12 “A men de, A men de, A men de”
8-bitryan really using a rat to make food bro who let him cook. XD And what was the game dev smoking when he made that part
Day 4 of asking Ryan to play Cyberpunk
i don't know if anyone has already said it but the Hameln company with a mouse-like logo isn't hasard. "Der Rattenfänger von Hameln" is a German story. To be really quick : a city was invaded by rats, a flute player came saying he could make them go by playing music, the mayor promised him money but after his job done, he was refused to be given the money. So he decided to come back but this time, the flute melody didn't attract the rats but the children and they disappeared forever (just like the little girl ran away after watching the show !!)
Repost from last vid: BACK YET AGAIN WITH A NEW THEORY (i have 3 more theories i wrote within like the first 5h of the game's release lol)  I know what Amanda is saying. I know what Wooly is saying. Hear me out on this!  ⚠️ SPOILER WARNING ⚠️ ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW THE GAME ENDS.  Amanda keeps talking about this "alone and scared kitten who is trapped" and she asks us if we want to help this kitten, because (and i quote):  In the Kitchen: "I'm not sure where they are right now" (after wooly asks about parents).  The Rotting Fox tape (idk what its called): "sometimes... i feel myself... rotting."  Then, in the other rotting tape and the petting zoo tape, where the KITTEN is rotten instead, she keeps repeating "will you help this kitten?" and how the kitten is Trapped and Scared. She smiles every time after we say yes, giving her hope. Unless, True Amanda knows about their plans and pretended to be the innocent Amanda while saying that, then maybe tortured both for it (unconfirmed?). In other words, she's giving us hints to her being the kitten in this situation. If she asks for help, she will be punished by True Amanda. If she ever gets mad/sad, she also gets overtaken by True Amanda. That is proven in the petting zoo ENDING, where she keeps asking you to help this kitten and after you say no, she gets sad, loses hope and can't control herself. She then gets flung around by True Amanda and can't stop screaming in fear and pain. You see how she says she doesn't have a family, feels rotting and is implying non-verbally, that she is trapped, lonely & scared, then proceeds to say the exact same things about the fox and kittens? I knew she wasn't the evil one. Her and wooly are both trying to get out, but True Amanda is preventing them, by hurting them and such. Also, wooly knows when she's True Amanda and when she's not and they BOTH know that True Amanda is listening to them all the time. So they can't make it too obvious, that they need help. By the way, proving that he knows when to say "out if script" things: In some tapes, Wooly tries to stay positive and spread it towards Amanda before she gets mad or sad, but in other tapes, he holds back from doing it, because he knows if he says anything "out of script" while Amanda is in her True form, he will be punished again. The earlier versions of the game also proved me right. The one where wooly says "take the tape out now and destroy them... BU- RN THEM" etc. he actually fought True Amanda and still told Rily (us aka the player), that they need help and these tapes shouldn't get watched by anybody else. Once again, i was right.  EVEN MORE proof, the "secret" ending, before the TV literally BLOWS UP,  you can see a male person, most likely wooly, IN HIS HUMAN FORM, being tortured HORRIBLY. He got punished that badly for it, apparently. Like being thrown against the wall and having bits of his body be bitten off by those sharp teeth of True Amanda's. It could also very likely be after he tried to fight True Amanda. And that's apparently, how bad the torture is. Oh god, i just feel bad now.
35:57 man got brain damage
🤨
please play dead island 2
epic
That's what I love abt Ryan he legot explores the entire game and endings which is so cool
I know it might be a bad time/video to ask but could you come back to days gone there's nothing new about it I just want you to try it on the hardest mode
Wtaf this is messed up but rayan just makes it so cool
What if you kept going on “forgetting woolys name”?
When Amanda was Like "something Bad happened" at 6:59 my brain continued with "something Bad Always Happens". If you get it you get it 😂😂
Always love to see Ryan’s videos about an hour long!❤
YESSSS
When he said yes Amanda looked at him, like she was ready to beat him up xD
Matpat pointed out that the company’s name is a possible reference to the pied piper, as in the character who led children to their deaths,
5:16 that sound effect gave me hello neighbour flash backs holy moly
*I NEED THIS GAME*
30 mins of gameplay but 1 hour of secrets? That's my type of game
I'm so hyped for this I oddly love this games design and flow. And seeing it grow through ryans channel has been amazing
lol i was just searching amanda all endings
the farm tape is literally like how in animal crossing you can get frog villagers but you can catch frogs and put them in a museum
Let's goooooo amanda is done for!!!! Where's dead Island 2 dude????
is it just me? or would Amanda the Adventurer would be a great SCP.
hi ryan
Time stamp9:15 Ryan trying to get some sheep stew 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🙌
hi ryan!
Can you please play hogwarts Legacy
"Oh amanda amanda amanda you think were done" 🤨 "After getting the bad ending" 🙂 Also, pause button made the characters not be able to move but everything was still going like nothing paused And the demon took over amanda's body and only you and wooly can fix this? Idk who can fix it
Thank you ryan for having consistant uploads
This is the PERFECT TIMING. I watched the upload right after I went to school and I thought that it would be amazing if he uploaded the secrets video next. This is right before I'm sleeping. Welp, guess I'm watching ryan
Hi
goodday ryan :)
I swear i didn't think this game could get any creepier but here we are- and the lore depends even MORE!? This game is absolutely one of the best this year for sure, So glad ryan's on this thing he makes the experience infinitely more fun ☺
Wyan nevew fails to dissapwoint ❤❤ 🤖🤖🤖🤖  Every kid trying to get the most likes on a youtube video
very scary aaaaaaaa
I love this mans videos!
Who wants to see Ryan play pizza tower again
he never fail to make me happy❤
Yes sirrrrr yayaya
Amanda is just Dora's crackhead sister
Poor Wooly, I can't wait to find out more of his story.
I think you am now understand the true story behind this! It was never the company or Amanda or the man who went missing, it was the man behind the headphones that made this story a horror experience! (Not involving you silly)
I love this game! It went from a game where you eatch game and respond to  exploring and secrets
Nice a new episode keep up the good work Ryan.Don't forget to have some rest once in a while.
i think amanda was posessed
Only 2 likes what a joke I’m the second one-
hi
ryan why are you so awesome?? please respond i love you
Can WE tAkE soME tIme to APpreciaTE thE aMOunt of EffOrMt he pUTs inTo HIs viDeoS
It sounds like they are having Rebecca intone some sort of spell, the phrase ‘pie man’ sounds a lot like piamon, a demon. Her hearing a voice in her headphones could be actually a voice in her head, the demon perhaps.
My theory is that the guy wearing red is Sam Colten, I don’t really have any other thoughts…
You do know you're perpetuating the popularity of these absurdly bad 'kids games' that most of the gamers & let's players with a brain have been arguing against & trying to not continue the creation of BAD GAMES that are targeted at kids. There's no redeeming value to these things. I really wish Ryan would stop wasting time trying to appeal to younger kids, the gamers who don't do this & don't sensor themselves have been just as successful by refusing to continue turning YouTube into a site full of kids content. Kids have their own platforms! 😮‍💨
Lol you uploaded the follow up of the last playthrough as soon as i finished watching it , godly timing
nice v i d e o 10/10
This game is mehh
Chicken scratch that one person can understand is better than chicken scatch that no one can understand
Ryan never fails to make my day ❤
AMANDA AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Ryan at the farm tape  say the father chicken is Sam
It's sow amazing to see the channels progress I remember that in the first 4 min of release there were hardly any comments but now there are so manny I couldn't find a bottom good job man and keep it up
I Love This Channel So Much! It's Always Been A Dream To Meet You, Ryan. But Due To Me Living In The Crap Hole Known As South Africa. It'll Take Very Long Until I Can Afford The Fly To The UK Just To Meet You. But Until Then, As Long As You Carry On With These Videos. I'm Happy And Will Wait For As Long As I Need To. To Be Able To See You In Person And Shake Hands Even! May We Hopefully Meet Someday, Ryan. Someday.  Keep Up The Work! I'll Always Love Your Videos!!
