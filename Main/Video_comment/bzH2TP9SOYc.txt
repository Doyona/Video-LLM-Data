Greatness has to start somewhere.  Thanks for showing us the beginnings.
Can't wait to see what is next on the diesel brothers checklist and what the big new change is

DON'T MIND ME GUYS BUT THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO IN DAVES CHANNEL ACCORDING TO ME, YOUR OPINION MIGHT BE DIFFERENT BUT TODAY WHEN I SAW THE VIDEO STARTING WITH HIS FRIEND NOT AN FRND BUT AN VERY OLD FRND WITH WHOM HE STARTED EVERYTHING AND HE IS WITH HIM IN EVERY UPS & DOWN AND IS STILL WITH HIM AND THEN HE TOLD ABOUT A GUY THAT IS HIS FIRST EMPLOYEE THAT DUDE STOLE MY HEART HE WAS VERY HAPPY WITH  SPENDING MORE THAN 19 , 28 YEARS OF HIS LIFE WITH DAVE . AND YOU COULD EASILY SEE THE HAPPINESS IN HIS FACE IT MADE MY DAY RIGHT NOW I AM ONLY AT 11.30 MINS BUT I AM VERY VERY HAPPY FOR ALL DAVE HAS DONE AND WILL DO IN HIS FUTURE. LOVE YOU GUYS  💕💞♥♥♥♥♥♥♥💕💕💕💞💞💞🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Me just realizing this is a 2 year old video...*fist shaking at the YT algorithm *
Dave try to get past winners together and raffle to only them an upgrade or a mod they want on their build that would be insane
Great video and life with freinds, greatings from Sweden
Been a loyal fan since first video maybe you could do episode of some of your friends and employees where they are now like Heavy D
Someone is trying to run a scam on one of you truck build giveaways
Why are all the link suspended or shut down?
I missed something!  Someone dying?
I love hearing stories of perseverance and beliefs in one's self. Even though I landed myself in a wheelchair never to walk again,  I rose from that and moved on from that to  only to do it again 10 years later. Although I now reside in a tent in the foothills of ski country in Maine in my 60's, it's guy's like you that keeps me going when windchills  are 40 below in February. Thanks for the share. I'm very grateful that our paths crossed!!!🙂
Good thing you didn’t quit. That’s why you’re where you’re at today.
The Dodge is ugly and stupid looking,sorry but I hate ugly designs
Smooth sailing!!

Congrats on everything you’ve accomplished” so far”, there will def be more to be accomplished, I already know that just from watching your videos!   And to do the things you do, like I watched the video of you helping to solve that 20 year old unsolved missing person. Dude, straight up, we need more people like you and your friends!

Visited your “now” shop early August. I really enjoy your videos and you are an inspiration.
That's an awesome journey,a xyou e
Awesome story,love your show..
2011 it's yesterday to me.
People post anything for content.  This is from an article from the Indy Star just a couple days ago.   So, after a whirlwind of a year in which she helped to sell out home and away arenas, broke the league's single-season assists record and rookie scoring record, and came fourth in MVP voting in her first season in the league, Clark will not be playing any offseason basketball.  "She has endured a lot this season, and has handled it in the most professional way," coach Christie Sides said. "She's grown not just as a basketball player, but as a as a young professional."  All these channels saying she’s playing in the European League don’t show one video of her playing
So I'm new to watching YouTube, but loved watching Diesel brothers on TV.. Kind of binge watching your vids for the last week. Awesome to see where you came from. Also kinda cool you had so many Landys in the shop. Always thought you only worked on big American trucks..
Omg I love your story make me go back when I help 3 amigos with the 1. Business and the business well and after that they ditched me like and old shoe
I heard their show is coming back in December!
its nice to see how you started and where you guys are now,all the struggles you had you guys are awesome keep it up.
An inspiring story that resonates with anyone who has ever built and maintained a business.  What interests me are the subtle clues of your backgrounds before DP and all the rest.  Heavy D met his wife at church and you've referred to your religious roots a few times.  That you and Diesel Dave both speak Spanish fluently also tells me that you spent a couple years of your life serving your church as missionaries.  Most importantly, you've carried those traditions into both your personal and business lives and into the service that you provide to many who ask, but also out of the kindness of your hearts.  You've managed to turn your trials and tribulations into lives of charity and service that emulate our directive that to serve others is the highest degree of glory one can achieve in this mortality.  Well done and keep up the good works.
I moved 4 times in one year! 2014 was not a good year for me!
Enjoyed the vid, great story… from one Adobe editor to another. Was the media pending error at 32min deliberately put in as a hidden cookie for us creators 😊
Love the hustle
Man, you guys rock. I lost my best friend, Mother, and Father, my wife Marcie in 5 years and to top it off, My Dog. Very rough times but, you all make me think of my lost brother with a smile! Thanks Guys! William
Thanks for the history hard work and chasing your dreams
Inspiring !
my god i am sorry i wasnt in the running to win this truck :( awesome video guys
Anyone else wondering why they are walking?
Love you guys. Love watching all you do
how to defeat poverty:    1.   produce essential goods and/or services
I’m 63 and in need of a truck nothing new or even close to new but I could really use some help finding a running truck. Doesn’t have to be pretty. I would appreciate it.

You guys blessing 🙌 🙏
I like you guys video if you guys need my phone let me know
Bro I always see you guys video pls buy me a used car pls 🙏 God bless 🙌 🙏 you guys I always but you guys on my 🙏
Im shure there are moree than a few real 100% american veterans and just the good old persons who still believe in the rule of law and respect it. You know who im talking about those old boys that got switches too. That could possibly bring down some of that good old cowboy justice. We'll see what switches up then.
Great American success story of working hard, focus, determination and discipline. Very inspiring journey. Your story is what it takes to live the American dream. - Well done gentleman.
I Love You Guys Channel. Because You Guys make Helping People Fun!!
Back when diesel brothers were not a sell out ....
Love your alls stuff and love your videos of recovery and old heavy equipment. I'm a operator at work myself. Just curious about the us 12 valve pics
So why does the pics of yall building the US 12 valve show a crew cab truck? When the red dually yall made it out of and the US 12 valve is a straight cab truck?
I hope you Dont stop gyes
This saddens me a bit, I've only just discovered your channel.  I too know what the end of an era is like.  I've been volunteering on a computer support site to fix peoples computers for free.  I've put in about 14 years to it and another fellow has put in 16 years.  We just got news that the server is going to be shutting it's doors.  I'm confident that I'll land on my feet - and I have the same confidence in the both of you.  I wish you nothing but the best in whatever the future holds.  With any luck you'll keep the airwaves alive with your wit and adventures.
How is 100,000 miles "low miles"?
Yeah and it seems like we're still waiting for you to give this damn truck away because it turns out you never did! How about that you scammed everybody! Website constantly saying something went wrong and they're going to resend the flyers blah blah blah! Come to find out that original website no longer exists! I bought something from you guys to get an entry to win this truck and nothing ever came from it you guys are a complete scam!
That is freakin awesome!
Awesome video guys thanks
I never realized you w are brothers  (only been watching 1.5 weeks… maybe less)
Wait so why arent you guys doing give aways anymore?
Diesel Dave is actually a good looking guy, he hides behind those beared
Great Story ! I Wish you Guys continiuos Success. I've been following you since maybe 2012 ! Congrats To You, your Brother & Family. I particularly like Offroading. Not good at mechanics, I have a 1972 International Harvester Scout II 4x4. Been working a little since I retired, having problems in getting replacement parts for it.  Congratulations. My name is Jesus Soto from Juarez,Chihuahua, Mexico.

I think it's sooo cool that you never seem to tire of tooting your own horn.  Persistence !
Hey guys I started a woodworking business in 1980 that was perfect for as far work but ended up costing me over 37500 in bankruptcy. Buy licked my wounds and started over with a different company to build homes in Ontario Canada. They hat again took off and had over 25 employees building home. I ended up buying some land and building spec homes which I couldn’t build fast enough but pressed on and finished selllng all 300 homes. That had taken over 25 years. Over that time I went bankrupt 2 times but retired last year with a beautiful home on the water with losts of water toys. I’m 73 in Canada

AMAZING BRO!..THIS made me subscribe. You are the epitome of the American dream for a bust your balls never give dreamers. I had a similar story. I just finished medical school at 45 years of age and finally did my helicopter license. I started as a poor immigrant with patches on my goodwill clothes and was told 5000 times I'd never make it. Keep the dream alive. You are gentleman and amazing, generous soul.
Love your story and it motivate me to do the best in life no matter what...Cheers guys for your success
I’m at the bottom again. At 60 . My brothers and I are no longer together. I am so happy for y’all
Guys, look at all the stuff this man has bought, there's no way Dave Sparks wasn't born to a multi billionaire.
Bro I'm so poor! I can't afford a free lunch. I was shot by" accident" by cops. Ran over on cycle. Badly injured! Lost 100 pounds. Please bless me bros as I always support you. Been subbed since day 1! Bless me please bro

Where is Paco now?
1:46 I don’t know if anyone will get this but when he was young he looked like Crowley from Supernatural. Like a lot.
Such a great origin story. I know this is an old vid, but proves that hard work, hustle, and tenacity breeds success. Respect 🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸
That’s a bad ass truck
This was fun. Life stories are veey entertaining.
a very inspiring story. thanks for sharing it. Makes all my failures seem like dues paying. A whole new way to look at things going south
We should connect.
Lost my horn on the Truck Convoy. We came from Niagara, connected and headed for Ottawa. Slept in my car with Duke my dog at -33.  In some parking lot.❤
Canada Needs a Truck like that! With a Canadian flag. FJT
Hi Dave I'm in love with you for your courage ontil you be come successfully I do place my other for a ti 👕 .I love you guys I'm in the same fight to be on my foot but it not easy.
I mean what a mouth piece taking for almost an hour. No stumbling no ah ah ah what a great video. These are are really going to make it big. The look the brains the ideas are great.
what a telling title, wont watch it because idk what its about or if ill be interested. but Good luck with bull shit video titles!
WOW Ooooo..Weeeeee amigo..thats wat da good LORD says..plant a seed and it will grow..bud..bloom n blossom n give fruit...and thats ur bio in a nut shell..im sleepy now GOD bless n keep u safe amen
I didn't know you had a show until now. Let it be hydrogen.
I love theee guys man pure good men
I got a question if you only have $500 how can you buy cars that are 2 3 and $4,000 how does that happen
I hate to say it, but I have to. That enormous American flag on the back of your truck is just out of place for me. Since Donald Trump totally screwed up this country and just about brought our country to The brink of disaster, I don't feel like waving the flag! I used to be really proud to be an American, but nowadays I wouldn't even admit to being one if I were in a foreign land. So take that as you will. I'm still subscribed to your channel and watch every single episode you guys make and I will continue to comment because it's nice to have a say in something
This is a really cool video. This explains why you guys are so close. Keep it up!!
I think Ill get a truck
✌️❤️✌️‼️‼️‼️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Thanks for doing this! Good to show people the work that went into great success.
Very cool, watched some of your stuff, never knew the history.
tell you one thing these guys CANT do and thats …
final resting place? bro.
Make a video on when you met all your employees and what you liked about them and when they started working for you.
U had a good run
I can't believe it now what do I watch and there goes my winnings
Bless you Boy's. You are good men and proud of you!
31:54
Whatever happened to this truck? Love this truck..
Get it son! Very impressive.
Congratulations on your success!
Are you guy's giving trucks away right now?
I find it really cool you know what a Sweat Lodge is.
Thanks for sharing your story! I just recently found your channel and really enjoy it. God bless you for the work you do for others along the way. Looking forward to many more great adventures.
Had no idea of all that going on
What a great story…. Thanks for sharing!
My wife and I enjoyed listening to your story.  We live in MT, the "Big Sky Country."  We moved from the west with $400 and a 5th wheel trailer.  We started in Sidney after getting married and moved around just as you with several ups and downs.  I worked as a field logistics mechanic.  In many ways we did thebsame thing buying and selling from Gov Liquidation and others for fun.  For work...I worked on Hagglund B206, Oshkosh 2518 Snowblowers and Unimogs for a Seismic Survey company.  It was crazy fun.  We grew slowly but never lost sight of where it all started our beginning.  Our home is now in Billings, MT.  Thanks for sharing your journey.  Maybe one day will run into eachother.
Beard shave off for charity😅😅😅😅
Me and my wife love your guys show I would love to have one of your trucks some day 🙏 In the future if I ever get the money 💰 I'm coming to get one keep it up
Does diesel dave do drugs ?
Wow lads what a story, I'm in the UK and love watching your channel thank you for sharing your journey ❤
Hay man.  Would really really appreciate you letting me know where you got the window air vent on this bad boy.  All the vents I find on internet are for rear windows so did you modify it from a base vent or is there a company out there that will custom build?  Thanks
This is so great to watch I don’t know how I missed this video on your channel I watch all y’all’s video and I remember watching y’all on tv and social media videos at a young age and I always knew HeavyD was a generous humble guy who’s got it going on but it’s cool to see how he fought his way to the point he is today, it’s also great so see early videos that I hadn’t seen in so long I honestly forgot! Y’all are legends and y’all interest me and have me watching and waiting for cool stuff everyday!!
Osem diesel daf
I just started watching the HeavyD channel on YouTube. These guys seem like they are really good people.
🇨🇦👀🏁great story 👏👏
Wanna wear a seatbelt, wear one ... dont wanna wear a seatbelt, dont wear one
I never realized yall were the ones doing those pranks back in the day. I reference that cab over prank all the time.
There are many groups of people, you can be a individual doing many things. But when you are one that is doing it with family & friends in a business & doing Awesome things. It says a lot about you as a person. Blessings to all you good & brother’s & family. 🤍🎚🎚🙏🏽🙏🏽🇺🇸🇺🇸
Those harbor freight welders give you an immediate return on investment. One job and it is paid for. It shocks me that everyone doesn't buy one. Plus if you get a cheap generator you now have an emergency setup for your trail rig. It truly is a no brainer. got a rusted out handrail on your porch? Boom paid for itself.
Where can we buy that jacket you have on?
It's over 4.0  see you next year
The Name of the Camo Brand / Jacket / Hoodie he is wearing is FREEDOM INDUSTRIES
I thought the long beard dave will never start speaking - took him 18 minutes for a whole sentence
Awesome
Who's driving the truck at the beginning of the video when you guys walk past it? Thats an unsolved mystery.
What an awesome ass American come up story!!!!
I wish I could have gotten into something like this!
In my best grandpa voice, "Is the truck still available?"
I've been watching ya'll for a long time, digging the video's...
My name is Jonathan Butcher and I would really like to have that truck
I could really use this truck!!!
Been a welder, Craine op, tank builder, aircraft rig. Boy wish I knew ya
What about the epa ?
that sightseeing bus used to be parked in front of my cousins house in Glendale lol never knew that was one of your first builds. Thanks for sharing!
Ive never been given anything period you guys rock
Love the camo hoodie we’re can I get one?
Man i am really going through some hard times right now for me and my little family. I have watched so many of your videos over the years, well because they're awesome. It's crazy that it feels like this video found me today of all days. It's good to hear from someone else that had hard times trying to start a business. This video gives me hope for a bright future, giving your story and then your success. Very motivating. Keep trying and bouncing back on your own makes a  man stronger. Thanks.
Awesome Video, Thank You Guys!
You I have a dream to get cars to fixs up for single moms r dads that want to work but can't get a car r truck to drive to work
Hopefully Diesel Dave finally got his own place.
Смакота!😎🔥
This was a great video.  I realize I'm a little late to the party here but thought it was worth noting, you are a fine example of how success is really made...  "It wasn't available but I made it available".  I always tell people who are caught in the struggle associated with wanting change: Your opportunities are all around, surrounding you.  The only thing stopping you from having your dream is you getting up and making it happen.  Build the drive internally and navigate with your ambition.  God helps those who help themselves.
Nice that Brothers can work together, i tried with mine, it was a no go that still makes me sad.
The fact that you didn't try to get as much money as you could out of everyone is probably part of the reason you're so successful. It's good karma. We're not supposed to step on others to get a hand up and we're also supposed to be helping others get their own leg up. Love this video and I'm not even done yet!!!
Love this, love your content, it was great to hear about your beginnings. I just started following you but wasn't 100% sure of how you got where you are! As a new business owner this is great motivation and inspiration! Keep up the good work, bad ass content and keep moving upwards!
Hey D. We're all human. We all make mistakes. At the end of the day. As long as you and your family are OK. Gr8 work by all ppl involved. Love from Scotland. Keep up the gr8 work youz do.
Diesel dave is this show. His comedy makes me smile. He is so freaking funny and just a laid back.
Thank for the content
just an info commercial.
these guys are awesome
Thanks guys. You've always been  cool. I've laughed my butt off so many times...'cause you're crazy stinkin bros. Continue havin too much fun.
Had no idea you guys have been doing this for so long.
This was absolutely amazing. Thank you for sharing ❤
Hi I’m 74 years old and I would be so cool in that truck ❤
Good story
Nice story ❤
I'm a Dodge man from way back I'll take a picture of my Dodge and then you'll understand
Please don't stop you got an awesome show don't give it up
I kind of  remember that one when you started
Hi heavy D its mike frm Australia.  I congratulate U guys , NO one else would have gone thru what u and your team.did to  get  your dream business set up  to reality. U guys r  AWESOME
Diesel Dave can’t even get a word in edgewise  😂
*You all are amazing some people will never get to come close to the life you live.God be with u and keep u Safe*                                                 *CATER*
pure dedication and passion
I’m a fan of your come up. I’m all the way from Saudi Arabia and diesel vehicles isn’t popular at all here and I understand them, i didn’t like them because it’s noisy and smell of diesel burning is suffocating and doesn’t have an attractive presence, but you guys got me into it.
thank you my brothers for such an inspirational video. you guys sure did motivate me to start my business.
Great story!  And a true testimony to the fact that nothing worth having comes easy.  My most memorable moment was when you paid tribute to the Mexican guy's who jumped on the roof leak in the rain!  As a prior small business guy who employed Hispanics,  I'm here to say they are invaluable and the backbone of America,  unfortunately we spend way more time talking about the one's causing problems.
What this proves Dave is never give up on your dreams. With hard work and the belief in yourself  everything is possible. Thanks for sharing your incredible story.
Your family must be so proud, good on ya guy's
I’d love to know where that camo jacket is from! My hubby wants one for Christmas. 😊
So what are they doing now??
I had signed up to your channel two years ago, and then, seemingly forgot that I had.  A couple days ago I found some of your videos and started binge-watching, and today I found this.  I love this!  Great story!  I'll be watching more.  Keep them coming.
Lol ok.   9 minutes in.   Gotta get my waders on.     It’s getting deep.    Take care you guys.   You got couple million people that are , uh,  nice people.   I’ll be nice.   Wow.   Off to see some real people
God bless you both .So much positive energy in any situation.  Love watch your videos . You both amazing persons
I guess it's like all great thinkers, you have to dream it.and then do it!
Hey hey hey:)I'm a broke a.. veteran..I can't afford to purchase a raffle ticket..very nice truck:)
Ty for sharing ur story. U had a dream and u made it come clean. U have a big heart and help people when u can. One awesome man and great crew.
Loved seeing your story in full ! Also very happy to see you guys involved in Bone Rush and recovery episodes ! What a great melding of the best of the best !  Good Luck !!❤❤❤❤

HeavyD if he is still with the original Mexican mechanic he better be paying him minim 200k
Enjoyed that thanks
Hey your link to enter for the free truck is hacked, Now it's a domain ownership buy site useing your name ??
My grandson and I love watching your videos and your show
I am a 56 year old grandmother that really enjoys your channel as my grandson that I adopted loves your trucks and other vehicles. Thank you for helping people out as you and your crew are a blessing. I wish I knew about your channel years ago. We will always be watching. I am going to try to get some gear for my grandson and I as soon as I can afford it. Please keep surprising us with all that you do and come up with. God Bless
I won't that 06 Dodge I sure hope to win it guys. I thank I've got to buy a shirt or something. Looks like I'm going shopping 😅
Anybody else see diesel dave sliding his hand across the window for the key to his old room 27:40! He must've been wanting to take a nap!
This makes me feel like I wasted my life on stupid shit what I'd give to walk again and work in my own shop
I ❤❤❤❤ you HeavyD and Diesel Dave. If i could choose life it would be to be an employee ...there with All of Ya.❤❤❤
10 months late, but still enjoyed the video. Thanks.
I remember that long time ago I watched you drive it. The track thing that was pretty cool back then.
All the eye candy a man would want and then some
Yous guys have done things the old fashioned way . Work hard for what yous have got yet government hasn't got there share .  Hope everyone  sees this and helps  Total respect fae me and alot of fellow worker  👍👍👍😜🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🦕🦄😁🤞✌️
🙌🏽 I love this Project’s vision! To support vets in a program like that including the BlackHawk is immaculate!  We have an aligned vision and program with a NASCAR through The Veteran’s Trust using racing Simulators in partnership with Full Send Sims.  Would it be ridiculous to suggest we somehow align and connect?
I love everything Diesel brothers do...God bless you ❕️
What a fascinating journey to watch from the United Kingdom. Seeing you guys go from a dream to reality is amazing. Thank you for all the joy you bring to your followers and Blessing to all your new endeavours.
Only in America can a story like your happen, that's the reason why this country is worth fighting and dying for. Anywhere else in the world you wouldn't even be allowed to have a dream that could reach this magnitude, God bless America and thank you.
I love these kind of videos..i havent been following long but im hooked! You guys are amazing at what you do. Good hearted people that really care.🥰♥️
You goter have a goal!!!
I wish i could own a truck like that.
Your channel is inspiring dude.
Wey estoy esperando mi camioneta deivi  mi regalo
El Caro de fuego 🇲🇽 this history its amazing
You guys  are awesome,  thanks for bringing  us along  on a great successful journey.  With you all the way.
Really wish I was born in US and near you guys....But sadly will never own a awesome build truck from you... Greetz from Holland
I have a new outlook on diesel trucks going on disability  looking to building something for car shows
Big fan since beginning but can't afford it i got nothing but would love to if I could
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤
" Bravo,bravo pour cette vidéo...qui retrace vos débuts jusqu'à là.... je vous suis depuis la France.. je vous ai connu avec Discovery Channel et, je suis un passionné de mécanique diesel et, vous avez bercé mes week end....en me faisant découvrir le monde des pic up, des moteurs Cummings.....Si vous avez du succès maintenant, c'est à la force de votre persévérance et, de l'audace et, de votre travail.... continuez et, encore bravo à vous Heavy d et Diesel Dave...."
Story of my life with all the moving and being broke. I'd love to finally get my 8th and final move

I heard Eric Weddle’s name at the 3rd location. Utah Utes, then my Chargers drafted him in the 2nd round. Wish we never parted ways with him. Glad he got his SB ring!
Think it's cool that you do this. Show us how to make money  easy . Thanks  , I'll wish you guys all the time. Keep it up 😊

Absolutely awesome story
This is my favorite video. I heard some of this on a podcast and this video popped up on my feed ..Glad I found and the story is amazing.
BE PROUD GUYS. Greetings from Holland
What a gem
Love the web show.
Great video but I would like to know any update on the muscle and all the other guys who were in all your videos and on the show. Also I have never understood whether Dave was your partner or a glorified employee. You have had some good guys come through your shops and it would be nice to see where they ended up
Hi i am South Africa can also take part in the comp. I watch all ur video's and love it. Thanks for all the intresting video's that u show and make for us to enjoy.
The funny thing is you can still see the plywood spray booth (that’s what it looks like at least)
They made the right choice not being clean shaven
really enjoyed watching that and the memories , plus your enthausiasm!!
wow, what a journey, what courage and determination. Well done, a credit to you all.
You guys are amazing, I,m a 73 year old disabled man in England. I bought a Renault Master van to take my disability scooter and have been trying to get help to customize it. I have a tail lift but trying to find people people to do what you need is nearly impossible and the prices are just unbelievable. Carry on your giveaways because you must be helping some needy people and good luck for the future      Mickfield
Watching you all in 2017 gave me a dream of owning a diesel someday. After a disaster of a first purchase of a 07 F250 6.0 that I had to sink 14k to get it right, I recently sold for the same price I purchased it for. And now I own a 21 3500 Cummins Dooley. I’ve enjoyed your content for a long time and was sad to hear of you court proceedings recently. Keep rolling!
an inspiring story of growth and adventure !
You never sent me what I paid for David Sparks I'm coming after you
what an inspiration!
LOOOK !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Keep up the good work, you guys F~~~~~ ROCK🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘Little T
Really enjoyed this video
0:40 baby Dave's aww
Dang it! It hurts a little because I want to help out and possibility win a truck at the same time. I am so broke, truck in the shop and my son and I are homeless as of this year due too rising rent, gas, food, etc.. We all have it a little rough in 2023. Anyway, I love show/channel, love the work you all do, keep it up.
😎🇺🇸 luved your journey wish I could have got in on some of the giveaways but I believe I'm about 6 months late but laying here with Kobe trying to take your family I enjoy your videos. Just keep them coming keep on keeping on. Practicality is what I preach and that truck was practical. 🧡
Keep up the good work boys 😊
You guys look SO DIFFERENT in the picture you posted from when you were younger 😮
Real life "Fast & Furious" right here.
Dave goid to go
Legends 👌🏻🇮🇪
Are Chris and crew still on the payroll? If not do you know what they are up to now? Sounds like a great group guys.
That first picture of you 2 😂😂 lots of love and support from Amsterdam❤
So many moral lessons to learn from this beautiful story. Thank you for inviting us to where this brand started. What a beautiful reminder that perseverance and real sharp focus can take you so far. The brotherhood, the ups and lows and the legacy of this brand stands from a very good foundation. - “love”. Keep doing what you’re doing. Inspire more young people and beyond everything thank you for generosity and authenticity. We see that from all your videos. Much love. Thank you
Love watching ur videos I love all of ur vehicles especially the ram makes want one even more instead of my fanger
Scam
Scam
I was just hoping we could watch LOTS of ads.
this is what hard work and committment will get you, total success.  Capatilism works.
They kinda looked good before having a ridiculous beard.
Got some major nostalgia in this video from the first three giveaways you ever did. Incredible how much you guys have grown since ground zero.  Absolutely phenomenal video🤙🏼
Seeing how you guys started gives me a lot of hope i just dont know how im going to do it. but seeing your story has given me hope and all i can say is i pray i can do half of what you have done.
Youtube paid for all this and your helicopters etc? wow
I just absolutely love you guy's your are living the American dream all hard work everything earned nothing given true patriots to heart you set the example on what it is to be an American you walk with your heads up and the American flag flying high I am a US Army veteran and proud to call you guy's my brother's I stand with against people who want to destroy our country because they hate what we stand for and like the Margaret Thatcher said in a speech to the parliament " I AM GOING TO DESTROY SOCIALISM" and we will because we have the Diesel Brothers god bless you and your family's and all the crew that work for you....
Interesting history.  I didn't realize that 100K was considered "low mileage".
God Bless you both for what you do. Keep the fire burning 🔥🔥
I wish that I could afford a RAM 1500 Limited Crew Cab 4X4 in patriot blue (I call it air force blue). It has everything I need in a truck. I'd want running rails & a hard rolling bed cover. Other than thatI just wish I could afford something to drive that's an automatic in what's called patriot blue. Love the fact that you like to work on vehicles! I'd really like a hybrid engine like the Ford Maverick has. I know what i  want in the truck...very large nav screen that runs the navigation, music, & cameras & saves on gas but it's an automatic.
Heyyyyyyyy i used to powder coat for 2 different companies Just north of my lil home town here. I started doing that in 2000-2001. Loved doing that kinda painting over wet paint.
You guys are flipping awesome to watch. I love your videos and watch them when i can. Keep them a coming our to us Alllllllllllllll. Take care of yourselves my friend's.
Freaking inspiring 🔥
In a  rescue rebuild video you said you 3 things I like about you... Here goes - - -  1)you keep everyone on equal planes.. I mean I tried to imagine a kid with major injuries- broken clavicle etc... incapacitated by life threateniing injuries.  The casual mannerisms were uncanny. 2) You have a big heart..Matches your ego!! Heavy D are you calling me a hypocrit. Or just mocking my pain??? 3) You like big trucks and so do I, No  other mother would defy.when I see you sittin' tall in the box ..I need detox,, it hets me just that high!!!
Hands down your best video so far
Diesel Dave's face when Heavy D said they'll probably move again 🤣
You can do anything you dream of in America if you grind hard enough and bust your ass. What a fucking journey.
Although I couldn’t win because I’m over the pond and late. This video was absolutely epic!
What an awesome  ride!
Gracias por darnos todos esos vídeos por eso siempre tendrás la bendición de Dios
I am only a minute in and I am just dying here!  🤣😂🤣  That big ol' truck following along behind you like an overgrown puppy is the funniest thing I've seen in a while.🤩
Balls
You guys are living proof that if you work hard while treating people with respect you can do anything.  Your success is awesome.  Thank you for being an inspiration to young men everywhere.  This Southern Bell is proof of you and for you.
Does anyone know if Dave and Dave had houses on the same Postal Route before they were born???
Max from Australia loves you guys.  I might be 60 but I'm one of the best chef's  you've ever met.
I HAVE NEVER WATCHED A SHOW TO WHERE I GET THE MOST ENJOYMENT FROM BUT YOU GIVE ME THAT AND I LOVE WATCHING YOU ALL DO WHAT YOU DO AND I TAKE MY HAT OFF TO YOU FOR FIGHTING FOR YOUR DREAMS WELL DONE
31:54
I love you shows everyone I'm catching is like 6 months later just started watching I guess I have to wait on some newer ones to come out but you guys are awesome at what you do maybe you'll make some recent ones here soon
Do you export to New Zealand if I win that truck LOL???
I think the pizza place
I lo e your business life story.keep it up guys
Thank you guys so much for posting this video its means a lot for a young llc owner like myself. Things have been hard lately im in my second year still working under another contracter but slowly planting the seeds for seperation understanding the main man is ready to retire as soon as he can afford it.. I personally pulled so much good useable info from this and has fueled my fire. yall have truly became an inspiration for all the little guys out there.
you two men and your other crew are awsome..keep up the great job guys
From Ecuador. what a ride with you guys, since I the  program in discovery channel to now love everything you guys do. I own a coffee bar and shop ESPRESSO CAFE in Ecuador since I got divorced 5 year ago and I'm still struggling to get up and running, been alone is hard with my two boys I keep on going everyday like baby steps, all for them
Technically an attorney can ask for evidence if going to be a civil suit.  Even as a media outlet you have to turn over evidence to the court if there is a case filed.  A car chase does not mean that it was high speed.
I've never seen someone move location so much in so little time. I mean each location had to be 1 year atleast  rght nless u were kicked out. Normally you sign a lease 1 year sometimes 6 months. Nvm I just saw you say broke alot of leases. Broke to Millionaire lots of hard work but discovery coming to you guys was luck that never happens people don't just get shows.  No helicopters mansions etc . I love muscles house I wish I'm sire its alot cheaper there than most places. Shit where i live I south flo those mansion  20 30 million and even smaller. I mean 50k for me would change my entire life. Nowadays it's harder to tart a buisness or youtube. In every genre the competition is ridiculous. Automotive I gotta compete with cleetus Adam lz etc build q 100k car in 2 videos who would watch me build a pos cheap car for months. Electronics pcs  etc ltt jayztwocents the competition is horrible. Reaction is the only way and  alot alot of luck
Can not get one your site to buy or enter the give away
Determination Beats Deteration!!!! Willpoweris a greatmotovater!!!! ( I know ,my spelling sucks!!)  congrats!!! on all your success!!!!
Cool givaway!!! For some reason I can't get your link to work.
When that’s heartbreaking I just hope that if any of your guys come down with the chronic illness, you just don’t kick them to the curb
America needs more Americans like this.
I always wondered how it started. Great vid!
You can tell how close they are and it is so beautiful that they grinded it out together
I don't ever watch videos this long, but this was just too good to skip through. A universal theme in every success story is it starts with a series of failures. You just kept getting back up. Great video, and best of luck in the future.
As a fairly new subscriber this is pure gold! Getting to know you guys and what drives you and where you come from. Big thanks!
Note to camera man: at about 48 mins… you, only frame of the speaker…. That gets old quick!             Sprinkle that in is ok…. Cheers… otherwise excellent work👍
You need to meet Charlie Clark of d.n.k used cars Farmingdale maine.
Hola  amigos que buenas camionetas sos de Argentina  yo tengo un auto viejito un Peugeot 505 como me gustaría tener una camioneta de esa
a new subscriber here - thank you for telling this story. Encouraging, Inspiring, and I love watching all the videos. I managed to catch a video, it was buying of a hardware store, and thought "these guys are crazy." I was hooked from there on and been watching video after video.
Great story. Always love hearing about people who are self made and give back as much as you do. Hat's off to you Sir.
Love both of these guys, they brought reality value entertainment and at the same helped people in need and sharing their contents to their faithful follower’s like myself! 😁💯🤙🏽
Much love and light ❤
Like Gary Lankford... I myself discovered Your guys show not long after my son passed away in my arms. I was completely lost and lost control of my life. Turning to drugs and partying. I started watching Your show and spent many many hours a day watching episode after episode. Sometimes even watching the same episodes over and over again. Especially when You guys would help search for those less fortunate souls that were taken and lost. I want to Thank You guys from the bottom of my heart... God bless You both
Just goes to show dreams can come true with hard work and dedication
Nice
Is the blue airplane 8:35 a romanian made IAR 823?
Inspiring story! Happy to see your success and the accomplishments. Your videos are very enjoyable but watching the brotherhood you guys have is the glue that makes it all work like magic!
Wow I'm surprised that no one has ever mentioned the fact that you guys never gave this truck away and I've never even spoken about it since. Had everybody by crap from your website to win points just for some mail-order problem to pop up? And a new date was set it came and went and absolutely nothing. Pathetic what a waste of money.
I like you truck bro congratulations home
Hey guys. I Love your guys channel and what you stand for. Great role models for success and determination. Keep it up. Your friends from Toronto Canada
work hard lol you play harder.🤠
love it
Dude your the freakin man! Nothing but inspiration. Thank you sir.
WELL DONE  TO all of your team! Have enjoyed the rides!  The DIVES!     And the Flies!   LIVE LONG and PROSPER FROM BC  Canada!
I wish I can win the truck because I love Cummins
👍
I think you and your crew have a seat in heaven , I hope their is more people like in the world.
opening line in cab should have been seatbelt LOVERS
14:14 That’s harmful and carcinogenic
Well done, do more mega mystery auctions, they're always a blast.
well this is awkward, I was just told to ask you guys for a job because no one else wants a guy that can imagine the things that do not exist. Let alone bring them to life. congrats guys Enjoy your well earned retirement
This video kinda reminds me of the draw my life mile stone/trend.
Lmao the truck was rolling
Now I know why I like you so much…
It’s guys like you that    makes America great , not Trump…
great story you guys are briliant to watch and funny
Cool Story
What Men are made of make sure to spend time with Your Wife Kids and Family my wife and I started with nothing miss the times I won’t get back with my kids is my only regret.
DD.... You are the show... ♥️🇩🇰!!! 😉👍
Whish I could afford any of it. But this is out  of my price range especially  since it has been over a yr that I have been expand never applied  for either or unemployment..doing my gest not to suck off the teat of uncle sam....from time to time when I can afford it I do MOM...  market on the move ....60lbs of vegetables  for $10.00 .... the last  time I went through thought I had the $10.00 , only had $5 there was a boatload of mushrooms and a bunch of weird shit like supplements  but only had $5.00 thought I had more  cash wise nh3y want me to make up th difference the next time I go through...which I will probably  do but I definitely  will not make it after they close for a butt load of supplements
Hey dudes, why are you not gathering  your strengths? My brother goes crazy when I watch one of your shows and he is listening, some of the places ya'll  go has some of the best gemstones in the world...my brother is  jeweler by trade but rockhound by blood...did ya'll  know 1 of the rarest gemstones in all the world is foun in Utah? He at one time wrote  book about to find shit rockhounding, but never published  it I am trying to get him to rewrite the book. Of course  this was before internet.... but some of these places do not have coverage
As I have out of work for over a year and if I had them both i would have asked for help.. but since my daughter due to needs and government has sorta gifted me me her 2006 Ford escape with a lot of work still needed replace the radiator which at this time is on its way, still need to get it installed, needs a tune up, and an oil change and total change and my daughter  still wants $1200.00 because it is worth it. I just was hoping it would include making  this a fully contained or mostly contained SUV. I KNOW shower  and crapper  will not work
My favorite  vehicle  is an old beater `69 international harvester pickup, which I paired  with an old ' 69 8 1/2 ft cabinet camper with hydraulic  Jacks on all 4 corners of the camper, the truck had an extra gas tank
Wif and I
Wife are so poor we have lost all we owne 4 times now just bareley surviving now no fun at all
This truck is so sexy..... I'm in ❤️ with it ... the color shape and height OMG
So you moved several times to get your business going. Just remember it's hard to stop a rolling stone!
Do you know Ivan Rich?
IF there ones one thing id have to see if i ever go to mericah, itd have to be the trucks. Or utes as well call them. Awesome!
Great show. I've watched you guys for a long time as I enjoy your content.  But this was especially nice. Keep up the great work
Wow you're human!!   I love you guys so much thanks for sharing all ur dreams and ur fails.   ❤❤❤
Wow I always one of these trucks hopefully who ever got them is treating them with care!! Diesel bros you guys are amazing!!!
Heavy d: let's ghost ride the whip for the intro!
Wow, what a story !!!
When people see it from start to finish they get more motivated to over come their own demons ..the truth of the hard ships is inspiring as long as u never give up it's hard but builds character and makes a good day more understandable and less taken for granted .. witch equalls fuel for the fire inside
🥇💪😅😜
damn, 850k is no joke. That's some bullshit
very inspiring!!  I watch all your videos.  Love the offroading adventures.  You are a person who never gives up, and your partner is amazing.  You remind me of Freddy Dodge and his story.
Awesome to hear your story
Congratulations to you Heavy D for getting to live your dream of Owning your own business!
this is the end, my friend,         NOT
Where did you get your business model from did  you see someone else doing something similar and that gave you the idea
Wonder who got that beautiful truck?
It would be dope to be able to work for him .
You guys are Amazing You'll never know how much you guys and the team have touched so many! Keep Your Dreams Alive the Diesel Brothers not only build some of the most amazing vehicles but watching you guys build your dreams your showing so many of us to Live Your Dreams !! Thank You
This is amazing, I wish I wasn’t late to the party and had a chance for one of the older give aways. Keep doing great things guys
11:42 safe belt
It was a stroke of genius figuring out how to use YouTube to your advantage
Always been a fan of what you do. It was a good video to watch how you've grown so thanks for that!!
Love this team. Can't get enough of your videos ❤
Interesting story behind your group and you two. It's been a great few years watching your videos and shows. You all inspiring to watch.
Believable. Glad everything turned out ok. Only thing could have been done was to investigate why, when you didn’t see water coming out of bilge drain. Just my two cents. Love the genuine content
What! You guys are brothers. Oh shit. Diesel bros🧐
Very nice 😀👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 hard work pay off in the end👍🏻👍🏻
Watching your story has been a pleasure .  ❤️🌿
Outstanding !
I pray 🙏🏻 I win one of y’all trucks 🛻 Thank You for ALL YALL DOGOD BLESS 🙏🏻☘️
Glad 2 know that you'll R safe
I really connected with you guys after watching you, your team, and volunteers help rescue the people from the snow in the San Bernardino Mountains 🏔. That was so inspiring. I am glad that I saw this video and am caught up on your background. Great video 😊
It's so sad that this is what we've come to. Cars have always been the only passion I've ever had. People won't ever understand what these machines mean to me, but I promise that when it's no longer possible for me to own and drive diesel/petrol cars I'll no longer be around.   It doesn't matter what we do to the environment anymore, we're just too late.. and those electric cars are definitely not gonna save us. Your Tesla's aren't any better for the environment than a new diesel/petrol car. I'll keep the catalytic converter and all that shit in my car, if it means I can keep it. Good luck with all the batteries on your electric cars in 10 years. There's still no way to efficiently recycle them so we're literally just burying them when they're done.   And countries like Norway who have the cleanest ways of extracting oil are gonna slowly stop doing it, not just cause they're running out, but because it's so fucking bad for the environment. And that doesn't mean that we'll extract less oil in the world, it just means that someone who most likely does it worse will take over.   A lot of people think that oil is only used to make petrol, diesel and the oil you use to get less friction in stuff, but we use oil in EVERYTHING!  Even your clothes have oil in it! So not making petrol and diesel doesn't mean we'll stop using oil.   And no matter what the more economical stable countries do, the poor ones will always keep destroying more than we can fix. And we've known for a long time that what we're doing is destroying the planet, so why did we only start caring when it was literally too late? It doesn't matter what we do anymore so why start overcompensating now?   I'll be laughing in my grave when humanity finally realizes we can't save this planet.
U guys are cool and would be cool to meet
who would have thought you guys went from buying vehicles and selling them to just straight up giving them away.
Thank you for digging out California!  You are true heroes!

You mentioned being sued a lot? Was that because of the broken leases or..?
So was the last spot purchased or is it being leased from the plumber?
Ive always injoy D D.
Thanks for sharing, I enjoy all your video's.
Jesus Christ is Lord and Savor. 👋 hi from Burlington Kentucky
Must've had some well lubed wheels on those tool boxes, you definitely did a lot of moving
Guys. I love your videos, but you guys look so weird without the facial hair. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So freaking inspiring for a 27 years old like me, LOVE this content. You guys rock!
Would never have the chance to win one of you work of art of a truck. Love you guys.
34:30 Seat belt Dave.
Thank You for sharing

You guys are truly amazing. I know my comment is coming out months later. I found you through whistling diesel. I've loved you guys since the moment I found you! I was oilfield and a plumber. I love heavy equipment, and rigging. Keep up the awesome work! You really show that you can really do anything! What a brotherhood! You are an inspiration!

Love your show been watching for years
Very satisfying
grrr at the end again grrr time to wake up tomorrow and just work for that goal.
this is my favorite and him almost lost, ,most dont have real friends.
I'm late but this is truly Inspirational to watch.🔥
I love watching you guys tackle some of the hardest stuff but I have ever seen I love watching how you guys for last stuff out get reloaded you do amazing work Dave how was I was younger so I can come to work with you I enjoyed running record when I did
37:00 even didnt know you was on Discovery :) Found an Vid you made on YT 2 years ago, and here we go 😉
I really like this narrative because it’s not a story of success. It’s a story of failure and perseverance and this video isn’t an ending. It’s an introduction to the next evolution of a business model.
To everything there is a time and a place, and  season.
whatever you guys do, please do not go separate ways....
All bs in there bunkers from nuke clear war
That was enjoyable watching how things started and progressed over the years.
Did we miss the raffle for that amazing truck!!!!
😀🖕entrepreneurial success, you did great.....Ive been a viewer but not a subscriber..This  viedo got me to subscribe, 👍
Man I've been through so much with losing my mom my sister watching my home burn down an then losing everything kids,job,car ect ... watching this vid still gives me hope that I can get everything back plus more ... I eventually would love to do what y'all are doing building cars an trucks it's really something I would love to do.... y'all kept going no matter what an that's what I have to do if I wanna get out of this mess ... thx for the vid an thx for all ur vids ... God bless!!!
This was amazing. Been an on and off follower for years. This almost brought me to tears. Love you guys! Can’t wait for all the next chapters!! ❤
Then explain why and how youve been sued more than twice for ripping people off. Explain why you ripped people off, explain why you lost all the cases even with badass lawyers.
If more people were as determined and committed with your work ethic this country would be so much better. Making and doing things in the United States of America
I respect deisal Dave! He knows he's the co star and doesn't try to be anything else! He respects heavyd ! And doesn't try to take the lead role. Much respect to d.dave!!
Very cool to see your story. Thank you for sharing
Starting to think I got scammed by the very people I have watched and admired for years….😢
Why U still not wearing seat belts?
Long story short, you had lots of rich friends, without them you would never have a business
I have been watching you since you started on youtube I have even gone back and re-watched a lot of your old video rescues and builds all great stuff god bless you guys from the eastern shore of md
😗
What an amazing story.  You guys are inspiring.
Such a great story, been following you for so many years.  I gave up on my dreams years ago, my story doesn't matter... this is my last year.  Hope you the best in the future
8:15 so you started your business out of a chop shop?
Congratulations on the success.
I love you guys you guys are amazing
I already heard that story because I just finished listening to you on Romans podcast. Absolutely and utterly amazing and what a blessing thank you so much for all your admonitions and ideas!!!
One of my favorite dudes, Tim Sandefur, likes to say that its impossible to measure the things & businesses that never existed, as a result of regulation or policy. Had you adhered to your local zoning or residential laws, this entire thing may never have existed. Same for your 1st mechanics. How would that have helped anyone? Valuable lesson on the scope & role of governance.
Was wandering,what happened to the truck?
So I'm wondering why I'm listening to your life story cause I'm sure you don't wanna hear how I built my boat factory from scratch. Your story is good . I'm 80 years old and tired so good for you. I gotta go out to tend to one of my cows. So keep on trucking. Dandahermit
Absolutely amazing story. Wish I found your channel sooner. I love this stuff. Keep up the great work
These guys tried scamming me when I really already couldn't afford to live....
Hi I’m a 69 year old grandma that along with hir husband love Dodge diesels. So some years ago I managed to buy a 98 Dodge diesel. The people I bought it from really did not take care of it at all. My husband was a good diesel mechanic and the plan was that he and I would work on it over time.  Long story short, my husband had an accident witch left him bed ridden. By then I started working for an industrial maintenance outfit that worked at gas plants, paper mills and power plants. I was in my late 40s. I had been trying to fix things on my truck over the years and thought I had finally found a place I could trust to fix things on my truck. By this time I was forced to retire because of my heart. Little did I know these people were not fixing thing on my truck but still charged me . Then my husband past away Dec. 23 2018. After that my truck went down and had to be towed to the shop (where I still didn’t know at that time were taking me for a ride so to speak) they told me the injector pump was out and it was going to cost $3000. To fix it 😒. We’ll it sat there for 3 years. Until my grandson asked me if he could take it to a friends place. And start working on it . I let him he got it going but is still having problems. That was when I found out the so called mechanics didn’t fix most of what they said. The point I am getting at is my grandson years before had shown me one of your posts on the internet called diesel brothers. He wanted me to send it to you boys. I sure wish I had listened to him.
I got the comment backwards. Obviuosly jut now watching the Nover Episode. I am sure you caught the jist of Deisel Dave was night time security
Hevi D, he should have paid you for Overnight Security Duty....
2011 I was over 60 years old…
I would love to win that truck
I Love America! You can't drive around in a monster truck with a flag in Scandinavia...
He'd still be doing the same thing without YouTube. In less than ten years and thanks to the viewers he can now retire, he must think he's dreaming
From what I can see you deserve everything you have earned. Good for you. 🤠🙏🏼🤠
Drive by your shop all the time. Ima stop by n buy some merch soon
❤ I💕💕💕💕💕💕
Why the flag?
Oh so that's how y'all got your editing and production skills. Branching away from corporate tv is better for y'all
love the content. you could come to bear lake pa. and fix on my 03 f-150. i need a truck to haul stuff!!
I Love this shite.. This is what makes this country great.
My grandson Hunter never misses a chance to watch an episode of Diesel Brothers.  He says he’s gonna come work for you when he’s graduated 😂. Y’all are great role models and I for one appreciate you for being that kind of men.  If you ever have time and think about having a 16-yr old boy come spend some time with you and see how your shop runs I know one who’d love every minute of it.  God bless all you do. Keep giving Him the glory and honor for everything and God will take you places you never dreamed you’d be.
I was wondering where you guys went now I know you guys rock ❤
I have watched you videos for a few years. I am not sure this is the account I have subscribed with. I have really enjoyed this episode. As a businessman, a building contractor for 39 years, this episode really touched my interest.
What an amazing story, warms the heart to see such determination and the ultimate success, big congratulations 🎊 👏  So well deserved for all. ( I bet you had your wife a little bit nervous at times, 😊)  Congratulations 😊 🎊 👏 💐 🥳 😊
I wonder why they are going to quit doing diesel truck giveaways. That’s kind of what I’ve always known them for
Wish I had a brother from another mother someone I'd be proud to call my brother someone who would give life to each other you can't buy that BOND ...I HAD THAT W MY POPS NOT TO THE POINT OF YOU TWO BUT HE WAS A DAD NOT A BUDDY THATS WHERE SHIT WENT SIDEWAYS YEAH WE HAD A BLAST...BUT AT WHAT COST....YOU GUY S KICK ASS IM PROUD OF Y'ALL A FUKKIN TEAR IS COMING TO MY EYE....THATS EXACTLY WHAT IM LOOKING FOR IF I CAN TRY TO BUY SOME MERCH I NEED A WORK TRUCK THAT DEPENDABLE SOB OF A TRUCK..ONE HELLA RELATIONSHIP WHAT I WOULD GIVE TO STILL HAVE THE FRIEND A I HAD....I DON'T NEED TO SAY WHAT ROAD THEY WENT DOWN JUDGED BY 12 CARRIED BY 6........IMA LITTLE OLDER THAN YOU GUYS BUT DONT LET ANYTHING GET IN THE WAY OF UR FRIENDSHIP ITS A WONDERFUL THING🤜🤛💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💯👊
Awesome.  Fortitude.  It takes Fortitude to succeed.  You have plenty of it and hopefully will have success long into the future.  I love when people who WORK HARD get to a place where they are happy and enjoy everything they do.  May you find the light in all things to come.
I'm newb... why arent they giving away trucks anymore
I love to hear from you Deisel & Dave
❤❤❤❤❤❤
literally inspiring... Me and my father are working towards our own fully operational business. flipping cars and making headway now!
I wish I could win the truck I have been trying since day one 😢 😢😢😢
Good for You Guys. 👍👍
Ahh the Rockwell compound! I lived right around the corner for 16 yrs.  I remember when they had a go cart course over there.. so cool!!
Pretty cool history, thanks for sharing for those who want to start a business. Perseverance rules!!! Get off your asses you young whippersnappers and get creative.
You need to tell the truth about Kiely Rodni!! Her death was not an accident, and you know it!!!
I love stories that show determination and achievement.  Such stories show how perseverance results in success.
Thank you for sharing your journey brotha!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Hey Dave man you do go on on well who cares as for getting gordo life sucks
Awesome
Thank you!
Y’all deserve all good that comes your way.. great guys and the hard work seals the deal!!

💓💓💓💓
Good stuff Dave!
You guys rock🙌
Good for you guys
Hola muy bueno lo que construyen soy de Uruguay saludos.
Great job  Good info
Great video
Have y’all gave away the US 24 valve truck yet ?    Haven’t heard anything about this truck since you posted it before Christmas of 2022? Just curious
Love the story and the incredible journey that you guys went through to successfully become the persons you have become.
"We had nothing and fought for everything"  5 mins in......oh my mate let me sell cars out his business so I had 0 setup cost and didn't need to arrange any of the bonds you need to do that.....k
Wow what a crazy journey you guys had heavy d and diesel Dave just listening lol
I love watching your videos, I'm going to miss you Guys.
Thx for that video! Love you so much guys 💪💪💪
I have to say, this is a fun channel. It's fun to see "boys with cool toys" that I'll never be able to afford.
Great story and Bad Ass truck!
May it just keep growing for ya!
You got bigger and better to bad you stepped on us little unfortunate people like keep the truck you gave me cause I couldn't afford to keep paying for delivery
love this  !
When do we get to hear Whats Next….
How did you get into recovery and heavy equipment stuff? I saw an excavator recovery but you started out like a car dealer?
That's one 4king nice bakkie
I live just north of you in Logan! Get a hold of me and let's go get some ghost hunts done on Antelope Island!
Always cool seeing humble beginnings makes for wholesome content and great perspective
You should have gone to prison for this massive Ef u of the law th rest of us follow
Powerfully motivational man! True American story! Made want to get up off my couch and do a push up or bicep curl!!💪🏽!! Power to you guy 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲✊🏿
Fantastic Cinderella story.
i like your toys :)
You guys are great. I found your youtube videos and how you rescue crashed vehicles
I currently cannot afford your merch because I'm a disabled Army Soldier.  My wife has a very low income job and we are trying to figure out how to pay the bills.  We refinanced our home to pay off our cars and lower our mortgage.  Too bad this is your last truck.  I'll keep watching and once I get some major surgeries out of the way, my focus will be on getting off disability and going back to work as a Software Engineer.
I love that TRUCK  !!!
Your story is so inspiring to someone like me who want to own his own business one day, but with nothing to build with.
I'm glad u made it I tried and didn't succeed
One of your best so far. Really enjoyed hearing about all the failures (or what I like to call unplanned opportunities) & successes re history of the business.
Did diesel Dave get a house yet I hope haha
Got my order in just in time for Christmas. Thanks for the cash and the bearded butcher zesty lime seasoning!! Can't wait to come get that truck 😃  Happy New Year!!!
Happy new years! I got the merch and a dollar bill! Woo-hoo! Now I can almost get my grill (teeth) fixed! Just $8558.98 to go!
Rocking the ronin off-road gear spreading the love I like it!
You guys should be very proud of how far you've  come.
Fabulous video ❤️
I’m glad I finally found y’all.  I’ve missed Diesel Brothers
I'm not the first to say it,..." if you can't Dodge it, Ram it".
seatbelt haters? they hate you for wanting you to be safe? huh
may i suggest some lofi instrumentals, or a beats as a back ground sound, using spotify to help
7 locations 7 years or less, admire the hustle, ty for recapping the struggles and the highs of running a biz
Dave has "the look" to make it HUGELY in Hollywood!  Perhaps he can get in on their next round of wilderness / mountain man movies.
I have so much respect for these two
Wow,  such a huge effort and personal true story!  My respect factor just went up several notches!
Happy for you guys, what a story, amazing! Your friend from Tennessee 👍

Unreal lads fair play to ye.

It's time you begin converting the antique diesels over to hydrogen fuel ⛽ cell...
Nice
I have an 69’ Camaro and based off ur videos you have converted me to buying a truck.
God bless America 🇺🇸
reall nice! i live on a boat in Berlin Germany and have been watching your stuff since a couple days.. makes me want to get my motor running and go recover suncken boats :)
Inspiración sin miedo al éxito…..👍👍👍
Gonna miss you guys! Goodluck on your next adventure.

Great story, just a few days ago I came a cross you guys on You Tube, love all that you are doing, keep on doing what you are doing, merry christmas and much love from the Netherlands, God Bless...!!
I've watched a lot of your videos and they're awesome to watch. I would have enjoyed having one of your t-shirts, but unfortunately I live in Canada. I'll be watching more of your videos as they come along. Thanks guys...
Look up the WEFA ACT  Your friends will say it didn't pass.  Don't listen. Judgment day is coming.
Rodeo Rose  love it
Hilariously pathetic
Can anyone do a tl:dw recap for me?
Carro de fuego that’s is the good one 👍
Everything is possible with hard work and faith in God.
I felt the growth of the company and constant hard work and perseverance pays off my hats off to you gentlemen. You’ve made it
Thank you guys for doing this. ❤
damn i missed out
steve the plumber that my friend pete used?
You both  compliment each other!!!!
You all Rock, Thank you.
@HeavyDSparks.  I ordered a t shirt for this give away . Badass shirt and someone from shipping left a dollar bill with the shirt ha
Great story, very inspirational! Thanks for sharing it with us.
Best part, walking off into the sunset... That's blocked by a huge building hahaha you guys are a riot. So inspiring to see your guys grow. Excited for your new moves!
You didn't show how your wife's are girlfriends helped or didn't help along the way. HI HI
Well to small parking as I see it now, so next location need to bigger to.
I couldn't help but notice that one through six previous buildings were all vacant, and while you drove around salt lake City, things looked mighty slow, you better be careful in your new adventures. The sign of the times is showing.
It's a little hard to take. Knowing it's over. But at least we still get to see you guys through UTub
We’re going to show you just how little we had” “so this is where I started with my car dealership” 😂
These videos are long ass hell (which i love) ive watched about 6 without gettin off the couch and alot of these stories about his experiences in every aspect from helping families to personal stuff. The more i watch, i feel good that someone like him is doing what hes doing and this is out of his good intentions to help others 💯
so cool
Great job guys
👍🏾❤️👏🏾
An awesome walk down memory lane and an inspiring story which makes me believe I can keep on pursuing my idea to start tourism in a town from perspectives of my people... Cheers Guys!!
All the dream of owning your own buisness in 2013. You can hear how the. Government wrecked everything in his voice. Just disappointed with all this government juice crap.
It's been fun watching the evolution from start until now. Keep it up.
Lowe you guys
To all the people involved including y'all, Congrats on all the Memories that have come about on this Wonderful Journey based on Hard work and Dedication and the Heart and Love it took to make all this Happen! Wishing everyone involve BEST WISHES AND GOD BLESS..... 💯👍
Your Rockwell location has some epic videos to remember. The many smoke out videos you guys, the bathroom being the most epic, made me stay watching you. The atmosphere you guys carry is amazing. Keep it up with where you go in the future bud. 💪🏾💪🏾
Well guys that was a good video y'all keep up the good work I've been a trucker for 43 years this is Ronnie from Georgie y'all just keep mention that gas and toting that ice 10-4
Damn RESPECT i didn't know u had to work so hard for what u guys have damn.
What a story, thanks for sharing!
Great and inspiring little video! Regards from Tabasco, México [Land of The Olmecs]!
Congratulation on you long successful journey. Your dreams did come true...
31:55  Premier Pro lost a picture, and the editor missed it 😀
I hate channels that use Clickbait, I thought you guys were better than that!
Does diesel Dave still live in the new shop?
I wonder what Dave's thoughts are on Chinas evolution or regression in the last 5 years?
I love both those trucks I spent 24yrs in the Army and got crapped on by our government anyways but I would love to have a truck like that would be awesome I love my country and the US ARMY. Love You Guys!!!!
Persistence beats resistance!  Blessings too you both
I'm glad HeavyD took care of the Carro De Fuego guys👏💯 DieselBros are a class act👌
@31.54 what's that?
Barely showed the truck during the description
🌴 RAWSUMNiSS 🐢 🌴
I remember the first time I saw diesel brothers on TV crazy how fast time flies
why are these videos soo dramatic?
damn what an amazing story. missed my entry for the truck its my dream truck.
D- Brothers! You guys are the SHIT!!!!! YOU NEED TO BE PROUD AS YOU GUYS ARE WHAT AMERICANS SHOULD ALL BE. HUMBLE LOYAL GRATEFUL AND INSPIRATIONAL!! KEEP DOING WHAT YOUR DOING. NICE TO SEE SOME OF OUR YOUNGER GENERATION OF MEN AND WOMEN USING OLD SCHOOL TRADITIONS. KEEP PASSING IT ON. THANK YOU THANK YOU.
He said did I ever pay you he said no you gave me a Land Rover
I love the pic of u guys when yall where young
hard times is what makes you stronger in the long run,  being fluid and open to what makes you a living is what makes you grow.
Find the original truck and see how it's doing
I love that truck but I know I'm to late but nice story
DO YOU HAVE TO ENCUMBER YOUR HOUSE DEED?
Nice story, enjoyed that.
Diesel Dave look like liver king
I hope you don’t mind me asking. When will the announcement be made about the truck?
Love this vid brothers ,u guys  are truly an inspiration. You guys deserve all that you have. You are truly humble and I can tell that y'all appreciate where you come from and all the hard work it took to get there.
Started with nothing.... including no beards.... lol  Great video guys
Definitely inspirational  Ur American heros if we just all could make our dreams come true.  But for once who cant its always cool to watch guys like u to keep us going that just maybe one day will still happen  God bless  Good luck with ur future journeys.
These boys are the embodiment of the American Dream 🇺🇸
Curious how Chris and Jose are doing
This video just goes to show you that if you can't make it in this great country then you are just lazy plain and simple. Everyone regardless of color or where you came from has opportunity. Hard work and dedication will take you anywhere that you want to go in America. Good for you guys!
Hey D........I dare u to send this to Africa  to be precise Nairobi......
awesome story...from zero to hero...
that truck in gta5 dammn that would be sick
dorks. seriously. just massive redneck dorks. please end this for the sake of mankind.
There is nothing better to watch, then Americans living the American dream..
Love the story of your life and love you guys and what you are all about God bless you wish I had money to get some stuff from you guys but I don't can't wait till your next videos
I love this
Good stuff. I’ve know you guys so long your family.
Would love to win it but I would just have to sell it to get something I could get in and out of. But it would be nice to replace my 03 Yukon with over 325,000 on her. Hope she makes it to 500,000 but rust may win
That is the most bad A truck I've ever seen hands down..
The epa and all those stupid lawsuits is the reason for the shift in their business model. Heavy D was even afraid to say rolling coal, such a shame what the government and all these tree hugging groups have done to them.
I would love to work for you I don’t know what I can do but I’ll do something
Question, The small alley way to the back lot, seems small for you.
God has blessed you. Dont forget Him!!
Cool story you had a vision in your head. Nobody else could see it but you and you made it a reality.
Good riddens
I worked for TJ & Lori too, some of the absolute best humans on this planet.  You moved up/down redwood road 🤣
It’s fake
I WANT THAT MONSTER ON WHEELS 😭♥️😭♥️😭🔥🤦🏾‍♂️🔥😭😘🔥🔥🔥
👍👍I lived in Salt Lake from 2015 to 2020, started watching the show. We even drove by your place on Redwood Road a couple of times. I'm aware of the good things you guys do, I think it's great. Good luck with whatever comes next.
Mad respect 🤙
Great story,good to know your history,and your presentation is matter of fact no waffle ,makes it watchable !
I may have missed it but why stop the show?
I still want this truck so I can tow a 5th wheel trailer painted by Billy...🤩
Great to see ,, Australia ,,,
You guys are the realization of the American Dream.  From 0 to 60 in 6 seconds if you catch my meaning.  Thanks for sharing your journey.
Oh, cool show, or rather history. You do move around a lot but you grew incredibly too... wheeling & dealing everything to make it work, seems over-whelming and risky as heck (which is what must excite ppl). What is it that drives you, and what is it your ultimate goal at this point (knowing direction may change)?
'Last Diesel"? Hmm. My Dad had a 2007 Dodge Turbo Diesel 1500 I let go to family I never knew. I have at least the memory of that incredible power.
Awesome journey guy's!! Thanks for sharing your story!
Nice video, great story! Glory be to God
Dude what a story, you worked your ass off and made it.. Congrats bro you made the dream happen for a whole lot of people... Great job
Its awesome to finally hear you’re back story, Congratulations on all your hard work. I’m excited to see your new plan!
One question; Is Pedro and his team still with you?
I really enjoyed this video. Congratulations for the success of you and your team!
The American Dream is still alive. Thank you, Dave and all the crew for the motivation.
Interesting , Thank You . Thank you for the trip down memory lane . Off to the New adventure
Wait!!! Dave was a blonde??   A lot makes, a lot more sense.   (J/k, you guys are the best!)
This is one heck of a story but well worth watching!
Thank you guys and your team for the vids we love and appreciate you all. May God Bless and Good luck to whoever wins that may you better your life with it
You guys faked me out sooooooo bad.  When you put up the picture of "young yous" I didn't recognize you at first, and with the proximity and the pose and the facial expressions, I swear for a second there I thought you were making some kind of a joke and put up what looked like could have been the box cover art of a gay porn video.  Seriously, I was laughing my ass off thinking you guys were insane to play such a prank, and then I recognized your eyes from the photo, realized it really was you and then I was laughing even harder.  PS. I think the evolution of your styles was a really good idea.
Yeahhh!
you guys are like j and silent bob really only in the aspect that your the talker and Dave is the physical emotion that randomly spouts wisdom and knowledge and jokes around truly a great combo
This is awesome... real friends will stick around
So diesel Dave was rooming with an old lady at the Octagon office ? Lol!😂
What a great inspirational episode especially since I just started my own business. Congratulations all your hard work is still paying off.
27.42 Dave was looking for a old joint left up on the door frame
I wish I have friends
totally awesome journey guys.....Thanks keep it rollin
I suppose you are going into the EV hop up business
Sitting here wondering where I'm going to store 4 trailers and 3 trucks, and getting the idea that I'm not the only one struggling with suitable real estate.
Awesome go for it
Figures, I start watching you all and you stop doing something. Could use something new, truck! A new truck is what I'm talking about. Keep filming! The videos are high quality, it's like I'm there when I watch on the big screen.  AL
Inspiring
from 500 bucks to millions i feel proud for both of you keep safe lee epc yorkshire england
I enjoyed 99% of that, I still don't get why DD is in any of the shows at all what does he do other than act stupid.
I hope you're not going full electric or something like that.🤮
hi im from uk ,love to see you build a 40ft truck trailer into motor home
I hate moving.  I admire your passion and determination!
So what happened to the original mechanics/fabricators? Your story is inspiring because after the first couple of setbacks most people would have went back to a 9 to 5. The story of Paco and company is great because they stuck with you and your dream.
I've been watching you guys from the the first season of Diesel Brothers till now. Your recoveries and content is at top of my list. I can't wait for what you do next. I really want to buy a 30' bro dozer recovery rope. I race 4x4 rock bouncers in Canada and run big cranes so I've seen it all. You guys are absolute gems.
Looking forward to seeing where you go next. It'll be good. You guys make things that way.  Take care and seasons greetings from Oz !
I used to bring cars to Tj and do work with him at that first store you were at, Tj had his bull dogs and BBQ's in the back of the shop. I didn't know you all at the time but started watching you on Discovery Channel. I came to your shop once and was shown around from one of your employee's that I knew, it was pretty cool. More recently I ran in to you at the gas station ( Erines Too ) on 2600 by Discount tires. You were taller than I would have guessed from Tv but so very kind to say hi to. I've been working here in Bountiful at Mazda for 26 years so I know some of the people you talked about in the video, it makes it seem like its all gone by so fast. Anyway good to see where you have came from and where you are now. I still know Tj ( good fella and still at your 6th place ) and Martin his painter that started working with you,  Way cool!!
I love that truck
You cannot be over we all love you guy's ❤
Great team .god bless you guys .what a story .
Great story, and great success to you and all your guys. I think I've been with you guys since 2014, and I'm still here, can't wait to see what you guys have in store for us next, going to be hard to top this, what you guys have going on here is pretty darn good.
Awesome! More of this!!!
This 2nd comment is for the "Al-Gore-Rhythm"...👍👍👍🤣
These are my favorite people
@Heavydsparks what was the paint code you used on that build?
The Red Dodge with the Super Single looks familier. Does anyone know the story on where it ended up?
Too bad we're almost all out of diesel.
Great job on “your journey “ inspirational for aspiring entrepreneurs thank you for the  insight 😀👍

Man your just a walking 🚶‍♂️ zoning violation lol
💎
still by far the worst show to touch discovery channel
Hai.. I'm from Malaysia.. I first time know you all from tv.. good luck to you all..
No mention of your family , any chance they could be involved in the business? Great video,
Hey guys the trucks are cool and all but can you help me understand  WTF is up with you driving around on American roads & highways waving an American flag everywhere you go ? Are you going to drive up to some hill top and proclaim it America ?  WTF fellas .
Always a leaser never an owner
So awesome to see the transformation, evolution and the struggle.  Gives me the motivation to keep fighting for my dreams.  It definitely gets super hard and difficult but hopefully one day the juice will be worth the squeeze! 💪🏼
Got my DP hat today and what a great hat..TY
Great vid! How cool, good history story guys. Thanks!
Hey it’s the EV BROS, LOL..
Hey EPA NO ONE HAS EVER PUT TUNERS ON IT, ITS TOTALLY STOCK GRANDPA, LOL…

Exactly 26 minutes and 36 seconds you can see a UFO in the background
I wonder what happen to the carro de juego guys
Awesome videos ! I came across you guys one day on discovery channel and been hooked since!
Wow …. Love it … wish I had money and seen this video in time ….
I love that Deisel Dave mostly listens.  Silence is so underrated.
I’m not crying my eyes are just sweating
Struggles what ripping senior citizens of there money progress what progress ripping people's information on credits cards no one gave you any money, that was a true statement you stole it from senior citizens accounts living on set income!!
Dude I missed this a few weeks ago. I love this video, its awesome how things come about in your life and how to pursue what you love.
You guys are inspiring thank you can’t wait to see what’s next and fingers crossed on the give away I mean who wouldn’t want this piece of history, what a perfect truck and even greater success story !!!!! ❤
So what is the thing they are doing? Don't have 40 mins to watch the whole video at work
I am sooo sorry that this has happened to you...if I had $$$, I would send u some,but I have my own sad story...lung cancer....did u have insurance hon??Hon??? Ur my fav on the show, I wish u the best...take a deep breath,step forward, and keep marching on...keep your eyes to the heavens...God knows your pain....onward my friend...Rosey
I have enjoyed watching you guys
Consistently Pray for forgiveness, guidance in a good (positive) direction, and for help against evil. Pray to be saved from hell  (whatever that may be). Pray for your friends and your family too, it only takes a minute or so/less at a time to pray. Do it and your life will slowly get better, or maybe quickly. It probably just depends on you and the kind of person you are/have been. Don't wait until its too late and you have to suffer the consequences of built up bad karma from immoral acts/unrepented sins. Maybe together we can help make the world a better place by changing ourselves for the better, and changing things around us for the better. And addressing/thanking the CREATOR, LORD GOD at the beginning and end of your prayers would be a good idea 😊 Or just be my friend if you don't want to say the prayer 😄 I'm trying to help you get right with the LORD🙏  Amen.  You should prostrate yourself if you don't want to do spoken prayer, or do both 🙏☺ Please worship the LORD GOD and not any idol.
I remember that first truck……….I’ve always loved you guys and would do anything to work for y’all.    Much love ❤️
You are just a hero in your own mind.  I'd still take a free truck.
Cool story, you guy's are legends. As a South African, please excuse my ignorance, what's with the beards, EX Special Forces?
At 50 yrs old I've been scratching at the dirt all of my life. I've made a lot of money and lost everything many times. You can make the perfect safest choices but sometimes outside influence, people, governmental greed can clean you out. Remember you are never to old and it's about how you handle it. Keep your head up and keep moving forward.
Booyah 👊 😁 👍 🇺🇲
WhistlinDiesel brought me here. Gratz on the Blackhawk. Never heard of you before. What an amazing story. I love origin stories. Thank you for sharing. Gives me a realistic picture of what it takes to make it. Resilience. Kudos, Love it. Subscribed.
Dude first time to the channel. Awesome. Your perseverance is contagious. Thanks. I can't wai to see what's next.
Can't wait to see what comes next😎
I love watching all your videos you guys are awesome
Man, I going to miss you’re guys truck give aways! Looks like I’m going to have to win this last one!! Corey H. From Denver Co. Thanks for sharing your awesome story! Stay Frosty fellas. 🫡❄️🇺🇸
You guys are so cool and awesome and it sucks that your show is about to be over because I love watching it you guys came from nothing and made something out of nothing and that's cool you guys rock I'm with you 100
Dave is truly a caveman.  I love the stories.  I really enjoy the trucks especially the 6x6s.
You had your friend wash at the office with a water hose why couldn’t he just crash at your place you was staying because obviously you wasn’t paying him ..
Love the story. I am working on my success story as we speak. I am building  my you tube channel and I also have a full time job moving people cross country saving money to build a shop at my house... I am looking forward to making my own video on my success story.
This is a great video. A great story .  Persistence. When things get tough, the tough get going. Thank you for sharing. Blessings.
Don't leave I love you I will miss you if you leave
I missed all the entries and deals but watched your video anyway and then sent it to my son. You guys are the very pictures of success, refusing to give up and willing to make the sacrifices necessary to follow your dreams! You help people along your way too which is priceless to those needing you! God bless!
I'm from New York Long Island I would love to win that truck
You guys are awesome
great video
Excellent testimony to the power of hope, fortitude and belief you would "make it", All the struggles, All worth it !! Now,....you come into BLESSING
El que se raja pierde…keep doin what u guys do
Thank you guys for being a great example of following your passions, hard work commitment and perseverance can and still do matter.
Had to come back and take a look at that beautiful beast again..  It would make a great personal truck for when I do my Tree work.. Can definitely see my chainsaws, climbing gear, rigging and ropes and to finish it off that nice multi unit that has the air compressor, welder, jump pack, and generator..
ll are an inspiration for me im nowhere near where u are but thanks for the years of filming and editing
Bye, C~Ya¡! Wish I could've trusted you more. Too many hackers and scammers connected to you and your pages, shop, Instagram, Facebook, etc, etc. I will breathe a sigh of relief if I ever find out that you are on the up n up. 🙏🏼🇺🇲💪🏼😎👍🏼✌🏼
The internet model of “giving away” something in exchange for buying merch is a brilliant strategy. A ton of money to be had this way and anyone who had a decent following would be stupid not to follow this model.
What a story! Love the content and it makes it even better knowing where you guys coming from! Keep on doing the good thing and being a kind person helping other people out, that is what i like the most such a good feeling everytime when you guys helped out other people's! srry for my bad english though and greetings from The Netherlands! LOVE!
this video is a inspiration im 49 and disabled time to fly bro
What an awesome story.  amazing.    I mean, i am a guy who swore off cell phones, really Beepers it was so long ago, when I was 12 years old. LOL   I can only see you guys right now because in the early 80's i was given a 486 Packard and I had to see what the heck made it tick and I started building my own pc's.  never went back on my word to my 12 year old self though, never had a cell phone in my life.  Never lost a girl cause she looked in my phone either, never got tracked , never had a cell bill mistake, or even a non mistake bill. LOL      also though i am not rich Bajaja      so I was looking at the site at all that awesome stuff you guys have going and realized since I don't do cell phones I wont be doing app entries ever so... bummer for me eh? LOL  there are a few down sides to not conforming to to tech. :o(
That would be awesome to have, my kids and grand kids would go nuts If i got of those here in Idaho, I'd say i could not imagine where I could go in that but I can because I have seen those places i just could not go there LOL.     funny, i am just seeing this today so I can't even enter .    i didn't really realize what you guys do, i started watching when I stumbled across your search for Dylan Rounds.  just recently started watching more videos.
I'm a newbie, little over a year now, your relationship with family and employees  I'm in ahhhh!!!  Thanks for showing what family and a company what it all about!!!      My wife says you have a secret man crush on your YouTube channel... lol
ABSOLUTELY awesome video!  💖LOVE ALL OF YOU GUYS!  And ALL of what YOU ALL do!  ❤
We bought a 2017 SD King Ranch from TJ Chapman!
Amazing video!!!
Bro don’t say nobody gave you money and helped you and proceed to say how people helped you and let you borrow money 😂 if they gave you the money knowing you may lose it, even if you had intent to pay them back they still gave you that money. There ain’t no shame in saying ‘I couldn’t have done it if people didn’t give me what I needed at the time”
Dude! I’ve been watching since discovery days and this was soooo cool to see your story. Y’all are great. Thanks for sharing.
I really needed these video. Right about now in my life to continue working hard tours my dreams and goals witch are similar to yours.  Thank you guys me and my son enjoy your videos
I missed the deadline , but I enjoyed this video so much. I have total respect for you guys and what you're doing . I do most of my own work on my truck , even when it's a bit hard for me. I recently did a radiator swap and next will be new idol pulley and tensioner. After that , a complete front suspension kit. My '08 Silverado 4*4 is in need of minor repairs and front suspension replacement very soon actually.  It already has a new upgraded transmission and a new rear end complete with axles and all. Thank you for the encouragement you give to all of us who must fight when the chips are down.
Very impressed how far you have come and that you never gave up! You are such a well spoken man and have surrounded yourself with wonderful friends that have been there to support you all the way! Can't wait for the next chapter!  Good luck!
I have so much more respect for you and your videos now. True blue collar worker. Keep it up man.
great job again, thank you. (a fan from istanbul)
Amazing story and how you guys trusted each other and stuck it out to the best. Love watching your videos keep up the great work
This video is a real motivation for me to get my ass in gear and do what I've been wanting to do.
Ol Jay and Silent Bob lol
Nice Truck!
The trump administration made the sale of tuners illegal.
Without FB I would never lose intrest in you.
So no more builds due to the EPA battle?
Cool
I feel the pain! Shop after shop!  Central Florida area. I love the great full start, STAY HUMBLE!!!!
anybody know where Daves coat is from?
Bless you and the path before you.
Great story! You have much to be proud of.
Awesome stuff keep working hard! Work hard, play hard
I swapped an R32 Skyline engine in my old Subaru Forester. I started the physical swap in a friends shop at location 7, and then 2 years later I had it tuned at my other friends shop in location 4. I had no idea you guys were in either of them. 😂
😂 Seat belt haters... I prefer my trucks not tell me what to do just like people. You dudes are good people if your ever rescuing in Wisconsin and need a extra back I'm there.
You at the Best
Great story and real motivation for all of us working out on business.
Old ci, he left us hanging off a cliff, brothers came n helped us up 🥺
Can you do a segment on G56 vs NV5600's with mods to extend the life of these manual transmissions? I'm partial to the G56 but they don't seem to take the abuse that the NV5600 is capable of.
I’ve been to location 8. Very cool storefront. Bought a few things as well.
I know that feeling to well. I'm also a business owner and when I first started man was it a struggle almost lost my  house, wife and I were constantly arguing about the financial situation but we kept pushing. Now I look back on how everyone thought we weren't going to make it ( my own family even my wife ) but I kept telling them "watch one day we'll have a line of people waiting to come in and have a bite at our restaurant" 10 years later we're still at the same spot and yes we've had a full house multiple times! we had our ups and downs but that's how business is, you just have to keep a peep in your step and everything else will fall into place... ya'll are doing big things and more power to ya'll
Love the back story.
It's a real pity that you feel the need to apologize,  for rolling coal.
I seen my truck (ARIAT) in the video. I would love to win another truck from you guys. Yall are very humble people and I'm for ever grateful that I got the chance to win one of yalls builds and meet all of you. God bless yall.
Where can I get that camo hoodie???
By Its over meaning your going to stop fkn up the air with your diesel smoke than thats a good thing Dave
You guys are cooler than that dos equis beer dude!!  I love your online content and your show.
I inherited my father’s 79 F150 he passed away 5 years ago and I have been slowly fixing stuff on it but I am not a mechanic and now I found out it needs a engine I believe it is a 6.6 engine and now I am not sure what to do I was quoted 6 to 7k for a rebuild
Great show! But too much time spent with shots of you. Get more shots of what you're talking about.
Fly me in I'm ready to shut it DOWN...  Ready ..able ..willing
so loved this, it was very interesting to see your progress !!! Thank you for sharing this :)
It inspires me to see that you never let anything stop you from living your dream.  God bless
Guilford Land Rover????
I would love to own one of your trucks. I have a 2001 Ford ranger that has transmission problems tail lights are needing rewired and I can't afford to get a new one. keep up the good work
You guys are truly inspiring I once too started with nothing hard work and dedication goes along ways
I am a 63 year old, white fairly conservative granma, you men are definitely from a time gone by, i know, i was there! 🇺🇲
This is a great story! Showing us your story was really cool! Thanks for showing your ups, downs and success. Can't wait for the future.
Diesel power gear is over because they're being sued by the brand Diesel.
Love  the truck I built one so similar 10 years ago its in my drive way now paint faded and engine blown. Twin turbo 5 speed nv4500 in a 2004.5 dodge with 2006 front end custom flat bed and road armor front end sitting on 38.5s six inch stack ect very similar mines burnt copper... very similar though. Needs rebuilt but love to look at her from time to time. Love you guys. Fan for life..
Thanks for the journey. Great story. Some time do a video on how the main characters came into the picture. Would be cool story
Absolutely awesome. Love that story how hard you fought to get to where you are.  It brings me memories of my garage story and tuning I did.  At the moment I'm on the sharp bent where my spine (or something near by) was damaged by the physio past car accident and whole my dreams run down 🤦‍♂️ Very close to be bankrupt and in need to sale all but still fighting. I'm in diesel tuning also for but here in Europe (England) we do small engines so for example 1.9TDI from 130hp to 700hp😎 Or randomly some V10 TDI from 300hp to 1200hp. Not long ago bought RAM3500 5.9 2003 and did 1400hp out of it.😁 Then another same 3500 that blocking 1 of the ramps.  I'm working on my own since 2007 and do 3 to 8 cars same time.  Unfortunately now my back not let me to use even half of the potential and concentrated more on to daily helping others with bit of loose till I'm available rather then making money.  Tuning garage is best dream any 1 can have and best experience in life. Even when it must end soon.  Any way. When I pack up completely my plan is to go US and say hello to you guys and gas monkey and others who I'm big fan of and watching your programs 😍  Hope you will grow unlimited and do crazy things like you do now.
I appreciate these type of videos.. makes it feel more human than super hero
Me: oh cool! A HeavyD video recommendation from youtube! “Contest is running until the end of November!” (looks at date) Dec 1. D’OH!!! 😂 lol  I enjoy your videos from time to time. I hope one of your amazing true dedicated fans gets this truck! What a fantastic journey you guys have had this far. Cheers for your continued success!
Love what you have done and can't wait to see what's next.  I'm sure Utah isn't ready for it but we are!
Why does it say media offline
i would love to work with you guys one day
Amazing story of true friends
Great job guys.i loved watching this video.unfortunately I can't afford any vehicle.but I love watchn the ones you's had made.veey nice group of guys I love watchn when yous helped recover vehicles and even when yous went to the old  mine.
Phenomenal story of success and grind.
Amazing how much a difference it makes to have a brick and mortar, plus an online business. I worked as a contractor and passed on a few opportunities I probably should've taken, but while I'm not rich, or flying helicopters, ,or able to bless people the way you guys do, I made it and retired. These days, you need to have an online presence to make it. Things have changed a lot in the last 30 years. Thanks for the trip down memory lane. Have followed you guys for a long time now, and it's great to see how much things have changed for you.
Darn.  I just saw this today.  Missed the truck give away.
Diesel Bros. I spend from 5 pm to 9 pm watching the most awesome videos on YouTube. (Your videos) Thanks for the content and please keep it coming! God bless and please be safe! Love you guys!

Buy Felicia!

i love this. yhank you for giving all that inspiration
This was cool and inspiring to watch good job on all your success, I was a big fan of the tv show always wanted a 24v diesel truck but could never finds one.
If you would move another time, what about to BUILD you own workshop with office and a big backyard with maybe your own runway......
I thought you said you were going to tell us about some crazy stuff you were getting ready to do and then you leave us hanging lol
So it’s man buns and EV’s next?😂
The Youtube channel is way different content from the Tv show. Im a fan of the youtube videos my dad watches the show on tv, i'll have to share this with him. Very cool to see how things started and evolved
I loved hearing your stories and have enjoyed watching you guys over the years!
Your beards are on point!
Awesome story!
I won’t lie, I just started my business in February, and ran dry, had to pick up a full time job and still do things on the side, I work on semis, and this helped a lot with motivation and I appreciate you guys

Wow. the life of a startup business.  I am just closing my IT business after 20 years and know about 'winging-it'.  It's not about knowing everything it's about attitude.  Determination wins with intelligent design.  How did i manage that?
Living the American dream with flexibility of challenges, just to awesome to know about.
WE LOVE YOU GUYS SO VERY MUCH LAURA LAKELAND FLORIDA USA HERE 🇺🇸 ❤
That Dodge would be able to get my Tree Service LLC. Up and moving if I had it Iove the truck

I didn’t the seatbelt haters existed on YouTube… the only time I feel hate was when my old brother died…. 1996-I Love you Bro.
Great story guys
Great Video!! Really enjoyed seeing the history and evolution of DP👊🏻👊🏻
Dave is starting to look like the Liver King.
You guys are incredible!
You should be very proud you all do amazing work and keep going because you all deserve all the success and were grateful for all of you thank you for always putting smiles on our face and making us so proud of all of you..
I feel ya....I get it....having your passion and following it.....keep the blue side up...unless you are doing something crazy....then just make sure you pull up as you seem to have constantly been doing!!! Cheers to your adventures!
You guys are so inspiring. I wish I had followed my dreams the way you guys have. You are a unique breed and are among the few that took that leap of faith. You should be proud of what you built and who you have become. Keep you awesome videos coming. I've never met you yet I feel like your family. Thanks for everything you have done.
So you said something happened… so why is the future? Just videos? I mean I’m good with that. Just wondering if DPG is still going to be around. Love your T shirts.
Can't wait to see what you do next!! Love you guys!
Great story guys!  You guys are the perfect example of the American Dream!! Well done
Wow, just goes to show you, you CAN start with nothing and build an EMPIRE. Just takes HARD WORK, and PERSEVERANCE. Sadly that is lacking in a lot of Americans today. Do you get up early, show up early for work,  do you stay late if needed ? These are the values I was taught as a child, and still live by 53 years later.
Thanks so much for your video's,  the enjoyment I get watching you & your guys Your amazing Thank you💞 Love you guys,Terrie Moore
8 locations in 5 years!?! What a nightmare!
Dave (Recovery)  Just watched the video of some doctors trying to sue you. What BS. I came up with an idea to help you out with $$$ . Can you do a video that if all your viewers send a dollar to help out.  I will be the first to send.  Love what you guys are doing.
Graet Documentary
My husband watches you guys every single day. Finally was able to order him some of your merchandise that he has wanted for so long. He is your biggest fan! Thank you for being such an amazing inspiration to him! He has always wanted to do what you guys do. This gives him hope! Thank you!!!!! God bless each and every one of you.
The future is electric or become a dinosaur 💯
Great story guys thanks again for sharing 👍
Thank you very much for sharing. Your story is very inspirational... where there is a will there is a way. Congratulations. Wishing you success on all levels. Many greetings from Switzerland, Cornelia and Christophe
The videos at the Rockwell building were gold , the time your ran pipe in to the washroom and smoke out the muscle.. or the video with that cab Over when you left the cab unlocked and rolled out the tractor tire haha. I still would love to come one day and visit
Heads UP!  You have to BUY something to enter/ download a stupid program.
It was great!!! I have dream of owning one of your builds. But been 67 years young I just can’t see it come true… Keep on the good work my friends!!! Blessings to you all 🙏🏼👍🏼
This sounds like an amazing place to work. I live in the Woods Cross area. I teach High School Engineering and Drone piloting. Love watching your videos!!!
That was one of the best by a creator I've seen. Rarely do viewers get the story. Only complaint, you Saud you were going to call and tell us what's next.
How much influence did the EPA have in changing your model?
Thank you for sharing, we always wondered how you got to here.  Very impressive.
Why no more giveaways?
You need to have us tow anything you need
Congratulations to you both and I hope you have a very blessed Christmas brother, and good luck to everyone
Miss watching you guys on tv here in Australia. We got old episode’s playing on tv
Wow. You guys are such an inspiration. You almost made ME cry! But keep up the great work. The road ahead is wide open!
With the amount of people screaming about environment and fuel costs would a electric version that you could could charge in any environment by solar, water wheel or wind power be a good option for going off track in one of your trucks? Then you wouldn't have to keep on stopping whatever your doing to find gass stations.
A stroll down trashy memory lane.
What happen with the videos for Susan see more videos of that what happened did you find her?
Thank you guys for giving us the shows that you're allowed us to be able to see on the TV and see the hard work that you do for us folks .😁
Our last give away ever.  Well, we’ll keep giving away trucks …..
Tough living in Australia, the shops items don't ship here😔
Always wanted to enter your give aways this time I finally did either way huge fan of yall!!!!
i've spend some time wonder how it all started, now i know. excellent video.
The truck kind of reminds me of the old m37 power wagon  very cool plus the stories was awesome I came from Wyoming to where I live in vegas so diesel power was well known throughout Utah apparently but yeah makes me think about whether or not I'd like to buy a hmmwv from drmo and build a good toy for dune running
Just bought the midnight oil Hoodie, I'm on Deployment hope I win that awesome truck when I get home.👍👍😁
I LOVE your drive, work ethic, and total lack of fear!!!  Wish nothing but continued success for you guys and thanks for reaching out to folks who need help!
We love you guys and your shows. You deserve the best ! God bless you both ,your families and colleagues!!
Hey guys is really sad that we’re not gonna be watching anymore diesel Brothers I was even thinking to bring a truck to you guys can build it for me
Awesome story guys! Can I get my Christmas Box from 2020 now? You da best!
great story hope you all continue to do well ....
@3:06 not a harbor freight welder...lol..and which crew cab is that,><??? good video awesome to see the come up.!.
Wow this was great.  My daughter got me started watching Matt’s Off Road, she said, Dad you will absolutely love it. Well Matt’s led me to Fab Rats, then to Robby Layton and now to you. I watched You Tube when you and him recovers the two vehicles that were over the cliff. Thanks very much, your Journey is a great one.
Guys all some story . Hard work pays off.  Best video ever.
I follow. Dave and HEAVY D almost since the beginning you tube. Discovery tv n truh the ridiculously law suit... That was painfully to watch them... And they recover wonderfully I preciate them very much... Gracias Dave and HD.
I can honestly say I am so damn proud of your hustle! Another reason why I tell my nephews to “ Look, Listen and learn” when they watch many of your videos…. with the exception of Whistlin diesel “ LOL! God bless you brothers continued success.
You guys are some Bad Ass's loved hearing all about your start through now great post. 😉
Jay dd man i love that...sky in d limit ..do what u guys do best...nuff love
That truck is so cool! I can't wait until it's parked in my driveway!
It's inspiring to see that you've had your fair share of trouble, but you never gave up and eventually landed a success.
An amazing story by a guy that can tell a story amazingly!!  Great to hear a story of a guy that brings a group of people UP rather than down!  Congrats to Heavy D and the entire crew!
Did the mechanics stay with you?
GOD BLESS YOU GUYS ❤ YOU DESERVE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE 💯
I can relate with some much that you are showing…God is good.
Ummm so how was that truck following you both and then you hopped in wtf😯 I have watched this 4 times and im still trippen 🤔
Hey guys Very cool Truck you built..
So your still giving trucks away but not diesel? Does that translate to you have been getting hassled by the government and EPA ect... and now will do builds more inline with the environmental pushed stuff they want us all to do?
12 valves for life!!
✨💜🥹So, You Started As a Barter Dude,.. KOOL   But, Why Didn’t You Let DD Take a Shower at Your House,…?
I found you guys the same day my daughter died. Sitting with a broken heart I turned on the TV and saw my first episode of your show. You both had so much fun and I've watched you ever since. I know this comment will be lost is all the posts here but I wanted to express my appreciation for who you and your team are and the risks you are willing to take to succeed. You both meant a lot to me that day and you still do. Thank you, brothers. You helped me carry on even though you never knew. God Bless you both.
Man love you guys and all you do
Have they said what they are doing next?  My guess is some sort of Extreme Makeover type thing where they build trucks for people who need them, as a part of a series for YouTube.
Братья привет как вы. Вы просто молодцы. Здоровья вам и вашим родным и близким. Вы супер. Вопрос есть у вас авторезина 215. 50.13?
God Bless the time and story of where you started to now all the Way From Puerto Rico i follow for more then a year like the videos and specially i love the Diesel Vehicle and all the trucks that you drive
That wedding photo had a little Elon Musk kinda vibe to it 🤣. I freaking love you guys you're awesome 💪. Inspire me to shoot for the moon 🌙...... Due time ..

In GOD we trust!
Awesome to hear your story, thanks for sharing it 👍
Get you someone who looks at Dave like Dave looks at Dave
Your passion  has built  a power house of a business  that you continue  to give back to the fans and people  in need, you are a inspiration  to many , loved  the shows and hope you can continue to fulfill  you bucket list in life while helping  and inspiring   many!
oh man, electric vehicles really suck
Stay blessed…
What a great story that will forever be documented for the next generation of Heavys and Diesels!   Ya'll are a true testament to grit and the American way. 👍🏽🇺🇸
31:56 What is this?
I don't think I have ever sat and been invested in a YouTube video ever! You are inspiring! Seriously true meaning from the bottom to the top!
😂 I laughed when you showed one of the first videos I seen,rolling coal into the bathroom 🤟🏻✌️
Hey super cool video I own that dually on semi wheels from your first shop now. Way cool to see it in the video
I actually found a 1977 Dodge Julie with A 440 big block
And truthfully I love that truck I've always loved Dodge and Chevy
That's actually exactly what I'm trying to do is try to buy a car trailer so I can buy cheap cars fixing up and sell them and start my business out small and then increase my business and make my business bigger as the years go on but it's not going so well
Let cool it with the ads. Damn bro
In other words it's nice to have rich parents! Oh, and what they mean by hard times, is that they were always totally secure!
You guys are truly an example of a classic American entrepreneurial success story.
Enjoyed that video Heavy D, great to see you getting to where you are now, starting out is on your own is never easy, will done for what you have achieved, and good luck with your future projects,👍
Is that in Woods Cross by Holly Frontier?
Just bought two t’s from your site and gotta say I’ve never felt like this was one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. Feels good to support you guys!
👍
I've had this dream. It's about my moms Lexus CT200h. I wanna do something to it. Tune it up. Give it some glam. But I've been in a hole about the entire project since my mom passed 2 years ago. But I'm starting to think that if you guys can come from that and be all of this then I can make this dream a reality. Thanks for the motivation.
Smart move I will keep watching you. The way you about this was priceless.
Awesome!!!😃
Thank you for sharing your hiSTORY... It was amazing. I'm one step from becoming homeless, even though, I doubt I will ever become a success, like you and diesel Dave, you did calm my panic and reminded me of the strength we all have within. So I believe, it will be okay. Recently been diagnosed with Pulmonary embolism I'm 53 yr old {yes an old pic of myself @25yr} looking a place to move to. Don't make much, I've been in a paralyzed PANIC. Your Video was way more than just another story, because you wrapped it in with, truth, humble, inspiration, hard work and the belief in yourself and history, that's why I called it hiSTORY. Thank you for that.
Diesel Dave you have balls of steel. What an amazing story. This is the kind of grit and ingenuity that made America great.
Thank you gods for stopping this channel that destroys the air we breath .. Good riddance
I had a 12 cylinder Lincoln Zephyr 1939 shift was in a place that was strange kind of csme out of the dash
Well don’t dump coal out the tail pipe and film it and you guys will be in business for a long time I’m sure
Wait, you guys weren't born with the beards 😳
Awesome story, Life is full of struggle keep believing in you and fight for your dreams.
the sisu is the copy and not the häglunds
Have never really heard or watched anything of you guys before, only some of the recovery videos. Awesome history and very inspiring. And also anxiety provoling because I don't know if I would have come out the other end the same way you guys did in terms of having a TV Show and everything.
Clickbait as usual. Thats why i never subbed and still wont do it.
I'm an old Grandma, yes, with the first name of Duane. I've has a dream, never realized, of driving big loud vehicles with manual transmissions. I've had to settle for my cars being stick shifts only. Anyway, I stumbled across your videos, and I've been living vicariously ever since. I love and respect each and everyone one of the guys for their hard work, generosity and compassion.  Question: with the current energy "crisis", and your last diesel build, are you moving over to electric? Just curious. God's blessings to everyone!
Damn man I’m 19 and I’m currently a free lance mechanic I work light and heavy vehicles and equipment both gas and diesel propane all of em anyways man I’m on that journey and you sure bring hope through this video
Imagine this meme: it's the one where everything's all futuristic looking and it says Society if that orbital sander hadn't got ran over.
Great video! blast from the past. Do you need to be logged into the account before you place the order to get entered in? I didn’t so hopefully I still have a chance 🙏
Your a prime example of everything that makes AMERICA GREAT. Building something from nothing. Everything earned nothing for free. Excellent work. Hard work and the never quit attitude.
Man that truck clean as hell y'all keep up the good work
You guys are Awsome.😊
From someone who has followed y’all from across multiple social media outlets from the TV show,YouTube,Facebook and the Podcast you guys have pushed my Business partners and I, To always try to think outside the box. And even know we do golf carts watching what y’all have created in your industry drives us to push ours. Thank you for inspiring us as well as giving us the courage to keep trying to grow and succeed.
I fell  victim to one of your scams before never Again
You guys are cool
Thank you for making this video. This was very inspiring! Usually we just see all your success but walking us through how your skills compounded and all added up to where you’re at now is probably the most motivating thing I’ve watched and has given me a lot of hope. We’re very excited to see what you guys do next!
Well done guys keep it up
Love the camo jacket what brand is that ?
You guys are incredible. Gave me the determination to start my own business which has now expanded online. Also to grow my beard 😂❤️
I just want to spend a week with these guys I remember the videos of diesel Dave in the auction vehicles
Seen the blackhawk on another chanel whistlingdiesel chanel.....whats up...
When you grew beards you became cool....the business grew with the beards...
Established titles is not who you want to have you sponsored by....
Should bring back the world champs shirt. It was the first shirt I ever bought from yall
Aus Dave thank you ❤
Thank You for telling us and showing us the journey to get the business up and running. It wasn’t easy. I love your resilience to make your dream happen. It’s a blessing to having all the right people to make it a success and the way you appreciate them shows🙂It’s inspirational. Also the jacket you’re wearing is awesome where can I buy one?
15:25 they pass their final place
What are the chances you can help me grow my business I need help getting customers and I just dumped all my savings into this business.
you are definitely getting another place , and or have 2 places haha, custom made place would be perfect!! lol better ways in and out and a wayyyyy bigger lot!!!! 10-20 acres haha man this is my wish, it will never come true, i get over whelmed to easily, though i would love to get a property way out of the way with a  garage and a house to work on cars and vehicles, to sell...maybe one day...
So is this done for the channel? Done for Diesel Brothers show? Diesel Power Gear…..I mean😢😢😢😢
Still remember watching US 12 valve on the tracking app you guys set up. Thought it was coming to Helena MT. Ended up in Butte if I remember right. So cool.
Location 7: we stopped by back in the day to visit ya’ll. The Muscle let me drive the six door and the crew was awesome. Can’t believe how far you’ve come.
I'AM A HUGE FAN. YOU TWO ARE SO INSPIRATIONAL TO ME.  AND I REALLY APPRECIATE TRULY,, NOT FAKE BUT TRULY GOOD AND PATRIOTIC PEOPLE LIKE YOU. DAMM RIGHT I HOPE I WIN THAT BEAUTIFUL TRUCK!
You're right, it is over.
That cateye on the semi-truck is a buety
It’s so crazy some of those buildings you used to be in, I inspect their fire systems. Some of them really suck. But man I love the journey you guys went on and came out ahead. Can’t wait to hear about what’s next!!
lol, you guys built my truck, 2004 dually flatbed offroad 6speed 24. I haul 4 yard of gravel up 2000ft anymore the front tires pop up -no steering, unless I rev down to 3mph
I blame the fact that you aren’t giving diesels away anymore on Joe Biden.
As a starting commercial sales guy, your video here is giving me some free leads of potential opportunities. Thanks guys! 😃
Nice truck.
The American Dream Lives!
Whats up with your boy Jared Lysic (or however its spelled)
It’s awesome to see the American dream still survives. Y’all’s journey is awesome and is a great example of not to give up and follow the dream. Good luck 🍀 with your future endeavors.
I think your buddy looks like the actor that's playing that bad Santa this year
freek'n cool as
Great content but I don't see many people these days able to afford diesel these days, but I'm poor and black what do I know 😌
Can’t buy anything when you’re in Australia 🇦🇺 😢
Great story of the American Dream.
I had a Patent back then
Ive been watching you guys sense 2014 and the facebook video days and bought quite a few things from your webs sight! Super cool video! Kind of emotional! I'm glad to be apart of the journey!
It's been a great journey I have enjoyed the trip. All the best on your new ventures. 👍
Wow, what a journey 👏 👌  , really awesome.
Good Riddence!
why would you buckle up in the middle of nowhere? 🙄
What do you wanna talk about Dave
Loved watching every minute and learning about your story and what it took to get where your currently at. Its encouraging for me. I am apart of a family business which is at its 5 location and probably final location unless we find a way to grow and expand and this really motivated me. You remind me of my father and why my father has been so successful.  What a great story 👏
Was that picture of the Land Rover taken in Moab?  I was born and raised in Moab!  I moved away in 1986 right after I graduated high school but it will always be home to me.  I still have lots of family there.
This was awesome to watch especially for someone like me who just started following you guys this year. It was neat to take it all the way back to the beginning and hear how it started.
I remember that diesel exhaust pipe in the bathroom video. That was the first video of yours I remember. 😂
I had the tire clinic ( Deerpark WA ) steal my JEG'S high-performance K-7 with a mid-rise Eldebrock boat intake with a rebuilt Carter competition carb. and rebuilt trans. strip my 88 1500 4X4, I bought a new motor but it sits in my driveway under plastic while I am in a re-ability hospital in Post Falls Idaho, After getting my left leg amputated. your truck is really nice but it is a wee bit too big for me. Plus no bed. so I have no use for it. Next spring I've got a lot of work to do re-building mine.
Would love to win this Truck! You guys do such amazing work! Going to buy some merch asap!
Dave
Who saw the freedom bus??
Boy do I have a good content for y'all....moving forward. Build a 3 wheel motorcycle, old school style. It's small job, but awesome build. Love ya guys. Call if u want to see where we got this, in Tennessee. Thanks guys
Pretty cool to see where y’all came from Divorce ended my dreams and now no desire to go fight to start it over agian
The other thing is that I like Dodgers and I always had good luck with them where they’re at I always had to replace her alternator but the truck got me back-and-forth to work in with the alternator down and then we had a Maya an older model where it was a third GEN and I had a 67 Cummins motor in it and we had a head gasket problem on that one the dealership that we bought the truck from end up paying for half of that job that we had to do on itAnd we could’ve fixed it up and everything made it our own I’m still doing little things here and there because we can’t afford to buy a new truck so Meisel fix up the old one and make it work for us so like I said you guys are bad ass and I learn a lot from you guys to
Met you guys at vendors row in glamis on Halloween 2022 getting food late night.  I just watched this video and realized that I'd been watching you guys content on YouTube  for years but when I met you guys I told you I knew you from watching you guys rescue the guy from lake Mead. Anyway,  Watching this video was not exhausting at all... It was actually very special And after meeting you in person knowing that you guys are very approachable down-to-earth good humans It was very hard felt and I am so happy for you guys to have this amazing journey. I don't know what your next announcement's going to be but I really hope it is more rescues because God needs people like you!  Not a way are you doing a good deed for people that you're rescuing but you are blessing all of us that watch you and encouraging us to go be better humans as well. Keep up the good work boys. Canyon Steve
What you guys did in your lifetime is bad ass good job on you to I always like watching all your things I can’t afford to buy anything right now because right now we’re just trying to make ends meet and my mother-in-law has Alzheimer’s which is in stage three so we’re just trying to get her done with a Arabian horses in me going to work back-and-forth a semi truck place and trailer that’s what I work on
Great life and adventures. Wish all of you success.
Where can i get those window rain guards ?? Thanks
The title had me thinking they are done. Good way to get  the ole play tab tapped though.
I’ve been watchin y’all since 2012ish?🙈🤷🏻‍♂️ I remember the YT Vid where diesel soot was tossed all around as Dave’s in bathroom. And the one where he winches out car parked in the diesel pump spot! I was singe and 21. Now married for 9 years and have 4 sons. Awesome to see the growth and hear the journey life took y’all on over the years! Always inspiring and encouraging the rest of us! Keep up the amazing work guys!❤️
am i the only one who likes the video first before i even watch it?
Great American success story Dave
What pops up on video at 31:55?
I don’t have time to watch the whole thing right now!! I truly hope you boys don’t leave the limelight!! You guys are what’s truly inspiring in this country today. Hard work. More now than ever before is what is needed in this country…. We need to TAKE BACK MANUFACTURING from foreign countries! We need to AMERICA STRONG once again. Within America. With American workers. American materials making the best products in the world. You guys need to be held up as positive example of what is possible for us!!
You guys are totally awesome
Well I tried to order but your website is not working correctly. Then I tried speaking to someone and noticed it said gone till monday...hmm
Aaa inspiring thank you for taking us on the trip now it’s time for me to do the same. Alway love all of ur personalities. Great guys.
THANKS FOR SHARING
Would love to watch the video but 5 Oley ads in the first 4 minutes of the video killed it for me.
Life’s a garden. Dig it ✌🏻
What are you going to do when the Diesel is gone. Biden did it and I don't approve of his very poor performance in running our country. He needs to fix it.
That truck tho! 😍
Yeah? Did you make enough money from ripping everyone off by sending us baseball cards? Time to retire?
Awesome story ! I ran the national gas to you current building
An amazing time line, RESPECT BRO.
Hey man you are definitely an inspiration been wanting to try and set up my pressure washing business just learn the hard way cash flow and you need to talk to do that but definitely would love some merch just priorities and money but love the fact that you peeled back the covers and showed how you got to where you are now keep doing it love your videos thanks
Unfortunate that the lightweight navy is oos :(
Thank you for sharing your story... big time inspirational, trying to get my painting business going ( @robzillaautobody ) it's a hard road to travel...
Cybertruks?
Amazing story! not unlike my own but I'm about 10 years behind
That was a very good and educational video of how you and diesel Dave came to be, so handsome.  The work you put into everything you did back then to now show the energy and drive you have.  Starting out selling auction cars not just for yourself but for those who couldn't afford brand new was just the kindest thing one can do for others.  Eight shops in a matter of a short time was just your growing pains finding your way to where you are now, show how hard you have worked with those in your life to get to where you are now.  You are a kind and generous man, not just to give Diesel Dave his start in the business, but also a place to call home as he worked alongside you till this day is a testament to the love and kindness you have for others.   Here is to you and Diesel Dave and all the others that have been a part of your life's dream of having your own shop and making the lives of others a little better, a  little happier and a little more enjoyable.  My hats off to you, your family and your crew, May the coming year be bigger and better for Heavy D and Diesel Brothers Inc. Sparks Motor Co.  God Bless you and your always.  happy holiday from Hawaii....
Its bittersweet to see them go, but. They will always be loved, and supported, no matter what. These guys weren't just content creators, they weren't just the guys who gave badass trucks away. They were so, so much more. These guys go in my book among the greatest People to ever grace YouTube. Thank you Diesel Brothers, for everything you gave us, even if we dont win, you still made us feel like winners. <3
I see you helping a lot of people and doing good things for the people
I will love to win that truck
So how long has Diesel Dave been working for room and board?
One hell of a ride boys
Cool story,  Can't wait to hear what the next chapter will be.
Wait, I thought the business spun off his parents business? Is that not right?
I drove by this place almost daily for over a decade and just found out earlier this year who these guys were and what they do...lol
Your Chanel changed me.  It’s helped motivate me through a difficult year.  The work life atmosphere of your crew is something we all strive to be a part of.  It’s like no matter what your crew has each other’s back.   I hope to someday find that in my life.   Thank you for the great content and all you do for positive change in this word.   We can all make a difference.   I’m going to miss seeing you all.
I love watching your videos. Dave and heavy d are good hearted people. It's gonna suck that that's the last give away truck. You guys have came a really long way.
You guys are the most awesome dudes alive! The way you help people is simply amazing! I personally think you should be nominated for Humanitarians of the year! I'm a young 64 year old chick who can't stop watching your programs. My favorite show by far. I so wish more young men would watch your programs. They would more then just learning to fix heavy equipment. They would learn how to treat people respectfully, I could go on and on. But most of all they would learn what it is to b a MAN! Guys I was having a crappy crappy way crappy day. The side of my car got taken out by a huge ass Boulder. There was a huge heavy storm that dropped like 4 feet of snow. That pushed this Boulder off the mtn. Any how point I'm trying to make is I went from oh crap my car looks like shit, to........Rotflmao at your program. That's it....I'm Crack addicted to your show! Not real Crack BTW. I wish I was better at my dam phone to enter your contests. Ugh. But thanks for being who you guys are what you do. Oh my car. My ins company said it was an act of mother nature! Wth. Now I have full coverage. Also had just made last pmnt on  her. Keep helping with God's plan.
Anybody know what jacket he’s wearing there ?
So excited for news of what's coming. Love what you guys do
Not sure where you are but I'm willing to walk there on foot, for that truck lol
That was so awesome to watch your story. I can truly appreciate the hard work and dedication you put in to creating you dream. Thank you
Oh Look! TSC in Waco, Tx is sponsoring sodom and gomorrah shows. Actors are from corporate. Who would of thought TSC would turn on food supply and family too.?
Awesome. May you continue be blesssed
So basically you kinda played the game of trade up
Great video very humbling congratulations on not giving up
27:40 Dave looking for a hidden Key
Wish I could afford it man what a sweet truck
That big ass flag American flag hanging from your truck is that necessary? Are people in your  town confused as to which city/town/village you are living in? I'm American and served my country, but I would never haul a big ass  flag on the back of my truck, do you understand the visuals of Nationalism? If you haven't, they lost a war.
You guys are great dudes ..  hope to still videos.  Be safe and Ty
Hi boys iv seen so many of your video an never seen a bad one, it's a pleasure to watch all of you working an having fun in your job, what ever you do in the future take care of yourself's,
I Love You Guy's From Orillia ,Ontario Canada 😎

This is a great example of risk vs. reward. Thank you guys for years of trucks! Love you guys
Cool to see where it all happened, keep it up!
I’m watching the vid now. And all I can think is, great truck, but I don’t want it. I would love to be able to afford to restore my 03 dually. Heck I’d be willing to let ya airbrush your name on the side to advertise your business in exchange. But anywho, been watching you guys for years and loved a lot of your builds.
Heavy D and Deisel Dave you are the most amazing man I watch your videos the story was heart ❤️ warming
Pretty cool vid. It reminds me of some of the struggles I've had building my shop here in the Seattle area.
I sure hope it’s something to do with Doug and the non gross former members of AWP that would be a killer ass show.
Please SOS I don’t even want the truck please help me out to fix my Jeep Grand Cherokee 93 5.2 4x4 it was my daily driver and overland rig and recently my engines been acting up ever since my powersteering pump bracket broke and caused a bunch of other issues I fixed them all but for some reason the jeep keeps turning off on me and now it won’t even start please people LIKE So he can see I love this jeep so much I just got it this year and this happened I’m only 22 and I used up all my savings already tryin to fix this thing  I can’t even get to work anymore SOS please help a brother out I bought a carabiner loved you guys for while  hope y’all see this😅
i loved this video. thats a lot of moving around.
Thanks for sharing. Pretty great to see your starting point, where you are today and the struggles and triumphs.  As a guy still working on a dirt floor in his newly built shop, I can appreciate the hard work and effort to grow!
Very inspirational . Thank you .
Rollin Coal is still a great saying no matter how old you are.
Thank you for sharing. It gave me a little more motivation I needed
You guys worked hard to get where you are and are truly an inspiration
Great video. Watching from Seguin Texas
Thank you for sharing! Inspirational journey!
You did all that without remembering to shave..!
So did anyone catch that the truck appeared to be on a remote. Or am I wrong about that.
$5 for a Tshirt? You mean $35 for a Tshirt?
Class.
Dope to hear your story! I also take seriously when someone says they started broke with no help though.  Some people's definitions of broke are different from my definition of broke when I was broke..
Impressive. Came a long way. I'm glad to see the American dream can continue. Good luck with your future endeavors.
In that pic you look like the dude from twinpeaks and Tokyo drift
WHEN YOU MEET YOUR MESSIAH IT WILL BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF!!!
Very kind hearted guys.. kudos!!!
Dodge got the best leather seats my butt has ever set in. Oh God i love them My Super bee seats ARE AWESOME. The whole car is AMESOME.  Performance, handling, Fuel mileage, power, and speed.  The looks are killer to > You would think my Super Bee is 2 doors?  but its not! Its better than a 2 door. ITS A 4 DOOR  ♥  I LOVE IT
I miss the Diesel Brothers builds and give away on those trucks. I kept saying > PLEASE LORD ! Let me win 1 of those trucks 🙏  I love the 4 doors trucks. The way you BEEF THEM UP 👍
you boys are the BEST !!! KEEP ON TRUCKING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just ordered sad to see this end 😢
I enjoyed the journey of where you started & where you ended up and looking forward to seeing where your adventures take us all next...as one of your biggest fans....
Awesome story guys !
This was an awesome video and I enjoyed every minute of it you never get to hear the whole story on how or where the channels got there start but for you guys to put it all out there and let everyone know it can be done and you don't have to have a load of money gives hope for all of us still trying to make it today. I took 5 years of diesel mechanics after school cause that's what I loved and ended up building what is still today the fastest 5.0 mustang engine ever to be put in a street legal car. So to see you guys come as far as you have is simply awesome die hard fan for life. Plus we have an awesome last name lol, keep up the good work guys.

Hey Dave and Dave. I've been watching your channel for about 4 years now. I'm not someone who comments much, but I have to say, this was a GREAT video. It was so cool to see the growth and perseverance you've endured and used to turn into an empire. Truly motivational. and to quote Dave, you should be "Damn Proud", of what a journey you've achieved. I love your videos, keep them coming, and thanks so much for sharing them with us. Your viewers appreciate them and you all.
Why do you have flags everywhere?
Not sure how or why your vid popped up in my feed but  this 51 year old woman is now subbed to your channel. I don’t build vehicles, not even interested in it…but my hubs is rebuilding my grandfather’s 87 Dodge Ram  for me! It’s sat in a pasture for the past 15 years and now it’s mine! Your vid ias so good, and now I’m interested in checking out your channel. I mentioned y’all to Hubs and he’s like oh yeah I like them. Lol anyhoo…y’all are a trip and best of luck in your future endeavors!
Turbo diesel 👍👍💺
Wish I could have the ability to help ppl like you do would give a meaning to my life again!! Keep up the great work guys
Life is good! Keep it up man! Happy Thanks Giving!
So what’s next? Anyone got the scoop ?
Never cut your beards again bros
Most of these locations are vacant now. Is that a reflection of your economy over there?
So many dam ads to watch makes me 😫 🤒 😷 🤧 🤢 🤮...nice truck dave.. nice facility
Good for you both, Dave and Dave. True definition of self made American dream. Two kids with no plan, no money and no one stopping them turning a dream into reality to provide for their families. I hope a lot of kids from the younger generations watch this video and get some sort of spark up their butt to do something other than sit behind a laptop, desk top, iPad or cellphone. Finally get off mom and dad's tit and decide to do something for themselves instead of living off mom and dad in their early and mid 20s and waiting for government handouts. This is America people, all you need is a dream, sacrifice and hard work to make that dream become reality. Somewhere in the last 20 years the dreams, sacrifice and hard work got lost. Thats because our govt made it too easy and comfortable for the younger generations to live off govt handouts. No one wants to work anymore, it's easier to live off the govt but yet they all want to know why other people have more then them and then they say the guys like Dave and Dave who sacrificed to make their dream become reality somehow dont deserve the millions and billions of dollars they made over the years but yet, they should give some of the money to the less fortunate who decided to do nothing with their lives. The people who decided to do nothing, deserve nothing and the ones who decided to make a dream become reality, deserve everything they have. The liberals in this country will never ever have anything of their own because they will wait their whole lives for money to be handed to them from the 1%. They say billionaires should not have billions of dollars, thats too much money, so divide it up and give some of the lazy less fortunate liberals some of your money. I mean after all, thwy do deserve it for doing absolutely nothing with their lives. Get out of here with that liberal BS and keep standing there with your hands out the rest of your life, look how far it got u this far!
upgrade, upgrade, upgrade..
Respect
... Take the money and run.
I am getting teary eye's 1 min into the video! Great Story of hard ward = success! Thank you Brothers!
speakin of grandpa trucks, i actaully still have my grandpas 41 dodge wc that iv been wanting to resotre but have decided to do a frame swap on a frame i already have but again with my back at this time im very limited an reachin out for help

Unsubscribed after seeing the stolen truck video. Glad to see they noticed. 😁
But but does Dave have a bedroom at the new facility!?!
Let's put together a truck and 5th wheel for people to admire. How about a 5th wheel that Billy paints to match the theme of the truck. And this rockin pair drives around the states while I retire.  If I was to win this beauty of a truck, this would be the start of a dream coming true for my wife and I.
Baby faces lol
Nothing wrong with Rollin Coal... In moderation of course!
31.54 ??
God bless you guys, you are a good  example.
I moved 4 times in 18 months going 200 miles from one location to another on a train by myself with 2 suitcases 4 bags and no money i can only imagine moving so many times for business.
Thought y’all were shuttlin down the business
Awesome truck. I wish I was in the position to be able to buy some merch and enter to win. I love how you guys give back so much.
0:44, damn whats in the food in the usa, looked much healthier in the 90s early 00 and no it has nothing to do with age, many 90+ look better then they. unhealthy
That truck probably tripped in valve with a full tank of Diesel  If that truck runs on Diesel
Interesting story of your business. I just like watching your videos then realized I had watched you years ago and did not realise this was you until you mentioned Discovery.  I cut the cord after I retired 6 years ago but remembered your 6 door truck you gave away. That was impressive which inspired me to build a Nomad from a regular 55 Chevy 2dr 210 wagon. 3 years into a 5 year project now and still working on all the.metal work because No one makes many of the part so I have to make them by hand. Good luck on your Blackhawk!
We bought our van from TJ in location #6. This was a fun video to watch. I may not agree with how you handled some giveaways but I still think you guys are awesome and do some good stuff! Fun to see the history and journey! Keep up the good work!
Hey Heavy D question do you Love Jesus?
Did Diesel Dave ever get his own house with a yard to hang his hammock
Great trip you guys have had so far and enjoyed seeing you fill in the gaps to complete the picture. Will continue to look forward to seeing your new direction in the forthcoming instalments.
Can’t wait to see the next step of ya’lls journey
Thanks for sharing your story guys. Shake and Bake !
Fake it till you make it.🛻🇺🇸〰️〰️〰️〰️〰️〰️
I figured you guys were gonna shave
Absolutely amazing and Inspirational as hell!!! Alot of people can learn a ton from you, alot of times people think they need to have everything perfect and money to make there dreams happen when you are living proof of "where there's a will, there's a way" much love to you guys and I'm extremely proud of yall!!! ❤️ 💪
I clicked this video, didn’t watch a single second of it just to say that I guarantee it’s clickbait just by the title. Good bye.
I hope you and your family had an amazing Thanksgiving
Congratulations bro proud of where you’ve gotten in life @HeavyDSparks
Oh don't say coal 😂😂 Say coal be proud , it's how we keep warm in the winter , don't bow down to the pink haired leftists , relying on government hand-outs
One of the best marketing videos of the modern YouTube era! Makes me want to buy some merch! Let’s go!
If your new business model is to go electric on everything, I'M OUT!!!
I've only watch your show a few times. I just don't watch alot of TV. BUT I enjoyed listening to your dream business journey. Love your builds. Politics aside, like Trump would say, "never quite". Best of luck in your future endeavors.
Super excited for you all and what is to come for you all. I have watched for a long time now. That truck would look good in Knoxville TN. I am sure there is so much more coming in the future!! Proud for you all!!
How do I enter your truck giveaways?
I never liked their crap show anyway. B. BBB bye.!!
I like to see your Genuine sides.
Work hard and smart and you'll make it.
DieselSellerz and Diesel Power Gear kind of “kicked off” my interest for diesel trucks. I was high school age at the time. I lead a very successful career now, with a nice 06 LBZ and an 11 BMW 335d at home. The diesel industry has led me to many, many great people, fun events, and unforgettable memories.   “Diesel Dave”, Dave, and “Heavy D” Dave, I want to personally thank you guys for kicking all of this off for me, this fun, tight knit, and epic lifestyle. This truly is, an end of an era.   Stay safe out there, guys.
such an awesome build, wtg guys
Damn I didn't think I been there since day one but I have !!!and almost 1k broker Trying to win a truck lol p.o 15  9th st mazon illinois if your feeling jenruas lol
Awesome job sir!
Diesel Dave Gummies ???
Awesome work guys,  thanks for taking us along.
WOW HEAVYDSPARKS WITH CLOTHES ON ! HEEHEE. DIESAL DAVE IN A HAMMOCK ! 😄 WHAT A JOURNEY  what a great pair of guys . RESPECT for all the amazing things you all have done for all the people you have been involved with .Also with Brett and CERRO GORRDO.  NO ! I live in Scotland I don't want the truck roads are too wee .
Congratulations on your journey to where you have reached from starting to presently. It is always a difficult journey but keeping a level head and goal oriented you will always reach there one day. I am in a similar predicament starting a new business and with it me being alone. But I know it will be successful with hard work and dedication. Again congratulations
We don’t hear enough from diesel Dave, he doesn’t talk enough. Even when it’s about him he doesn’t tell it. Sad to see it end, always been awesome!
I just love watching the content and wishing I could own a good truck
I think you guys will never forget what it took to get where you are ! And that is why you will always be successful !
The definition of hard work pays off
You guys are freaking awesome congratulations on all your successes keep making videos I’ll definitely be watching god bless
Man man man i loved this story of how you guys came along  It sure wasn’t easy but y’all push through! Amazing!!! I really needed to see this video!  Y’all just gave me a huge motivation to push harder than what im pushing!! Great great story!!!
Nice video .. could have edited down to about 3 minutes and just told the truth.... Y'all broke the law to many times got slapped with almost a million in fines and are to greedy to sell some of what you have to pay the fines so you are moving on to other stuff
Ok have fun
That’s cool
Hello all I'm a YouTuber and a small little appliance business repair company out of Colgate. And I know the feeling of struggling trying to get stuff up and running I am still struggling to get my business up and running and my YouTube channel
what a great video!!! I'm glad I came back to my house & found it. I've been nursing my wife back to health at my sons house (15 miles from my place) He's graciously letting us stay with him so my honey doesn't have to contend with the steps here entering our home after her knee & hip surgery. Enough of that, for now, I have to go get some diesel merch to win this truck... wish us luck, love you guys!
That’s an awesome looking truck 😊
Every time I came down from coalville or Morgan through riverside into Ogden. I would always look for this shop. Your shop. You guys are an awesome Embodiment of hard workers in Utah and how awesome this city really is. Way to go Dave(‘s)👍🏼💪🏼
Your apparel website SUCKS, you dangled a discount in my face, you fished for my information and then you won't let me log in to the account.
Couple good looking dudes.  I must say you tell a crisp story too well spoken 🇨🇦
You boys are a inspiration I'm born American raised Canadian you keep up that hard work 💪 good men supporting there family. Would make a great new welding truck
let me guess, its not over, its just another click bait title
Well done. I bought a shirt for my boy
Thanks for what you guys do. God bless
Wishing you the best in your new adventures
Dave, I started watching your channel a couple of months ago after seeing you work with Mike Patey.  I watch him for his aviation content.  I watched you recover the remains of the pilot in Oregon (where I live) and return him to his family in Chahalis, Washington.  The more I see, the more amazed I am with your work.  I love the spirit you guys share.  Finally, just today I finished watching your interview with Roman Atwood while I was on duty as an EMS pilot.  It took me three days to watch the whole thing.  After viewing the podcast with Roman, I made the comment below on his channel.  I thought I would share it with you too, since I didn't know if you would see it there.  "I couldn't stop for the last part where you talked about the church.  I've watched both of your channels and never knew any of you was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  I had wondered about Dave just because of the Utah connection.  I found Dave when watching him work with Mike Patey, and got really interested when he started talking about his Blackhawk.  I found Mike when looking at videos of his plane Draco.    You guys are all awesome and you have warmed my heart with this video.  I converted to the church at 20 years old, and as a single college student wasn't real active.  When I got serious and started to truly convert a couple of years after my baptism, I met my wife within three months at a church dance at Arizona State University.  We raised four kids, all grown up now, and have been married for 34 years.  I spent 8 years flying Blackhawks in the Army and have been a commercial helicopter pilot since 2000.  Now I'm a Bishop in Oregon and fly as an EMS pilot full-time.  Thank you so much for sharing your testimonies.  I started listening while I was on EMS duty just because I enjoy hearing stories about what people do and thought it would be fun to hear you talk to each other.  I had no idea that it would end up with a discussion about the church.  I have been really blessed to hear you guys and thanks for the fun content that you both provide.  I can't wait to share this with my kids and friends."
You guys are so inspiring. This whole video gives me butterflies thinking about possibilities....you show the possibility of the American Dream. Hoorah!
Best wishes for the ever changing future
Thanks for everything u guys do !!!!!!!!much love
Still have the t shirt I bought to be entered into the 1st truck give away 🥲
I remember watching your videos on Facebook! The one where you started speaking Spanish blew me away and have been a fan ever since! I appreciate trucks for they are and they're purpose more of a car guy really but your content has always been great the builds have been phenomenal and you guys have some of the best energy can't wait for what's next !
Hey there!!  I was on Brent’s channel for a few months when you came barreling in, had NO idea who you were but have watched you on and off over the last couple of years - great guys, big hearts and seeing your story today made it all full circle!  Thanks for sharing but tell me have you ever driven or worked on big car trucks - I drive cat 793s and liebherr 350t electric trucks which I hate as they are sooo unpredictable - would love to see you get a couple of these and do SOMETHING with them!!!
What’s next for HeavyD & Diesel Dave?
Been a blast guys ❤️
Wow what a lovely look back of were you came from and what you have achieved, your dream has come full circle. Good luck in your new adventure. I love watching your YouTube.

Since I first saw you guys, I loved you guys and your business. Fascinating to watch your success, and you have great personalities and are wonderful entrepreneurs.  You guys f*cking rock and so do your trucks. Big love!
Buckle up...but he didnt buckle up 🤘🏻😂😂
Stop desecrating the Flag! Don't wear it as clothing! Don't use it commercially! Don't burn it!  Don't let it touch the ground!  Have some respect.
What a fantastic look back, You guys are amazing!!
Wow! Great video showing your new place! Love you guys!
Amazing success story! You all deserve it too. So happy for you all 💪💥
So cool guys!!

Wicked content you guys make, and hilarious to🤣🤣 keep up the excellent work 👍👍👍👍👍
Thank you for telling your story. I didn't know any of this I just happened on your work while searching the net. Excellent job you guys. Can't wait for the next gen Heavy D episode.
Been a great journey with you guys since  preview of the  premiere on TV
💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝missed yaaaaaalllll
Love it. I started my company (HalferLand Performance, specializing in everything Honda V6 J-Series Performance related) and initially worked on the side of my house on a concrete pad with a car port and a shed as storage. Larger companies downed me, said I wasn't legit because I didn't have a $2000+ monthly to rent a shop. Well the company has grown year over year, started in COVID and have done nothing but grow. I ended up moving my personal home, upgraded to a 2500sqft house and half an acre and instead of paying $1200-$1500 month for 1000sqft shop I built our own shop, just under 900sqft (yeah it's not huge but it's ours), paid cash for it, laid my own concrete slab and don't have any overhead. We also just went full solar on the shop so we operate as clean as possible and affordably as possible (again the full solar kit paid on cash) 😎🤙 Love this video you guys have, being appreciative of what you have and where you came from says a lot about you guys. So what people call "Not legitimate" or "back yard shop" we call SMART and understanding how to maintain and grow a company, especially in tough times (world economy)...and what has allowed us to grow our HLP R&D developed High HP Honda Jseries Performance Part lineup, bring parts to the Jseries platform no one has
Beard shave off forr charity
❤❤❤
You should pick 10 finalists and whoever drives it out there lot first, take it home!! With that 6 speed stick shift, most of your millennials are in trouble!! 🤙🏻
Man. You guys are awesome
Definitely a Story of perseverance!
Great to see a couple hard working Americans. Love you guy's.
Yes cash flow and working capital is the life blood of being self-employed. Glad you made it, I've watched your shows over the years.
Great video! I dig the journey!
You guys are an inspiration for Entrepreneurs here in Utah and all over the world, the little guys with a dream and a vision of where they want to go. I am boot strapper as well , so I know the struggles are real.!!!
Love you story! You are such an inspiration! The world needs more HeavyDSparks !! We loved watching your journey from the start! My 1 and 4 year olds check youtube daily for your videos!  Thanks HeavyD ❤
Amazing guys hard work does pay off keep up the great work and the awesome mertch all I ware is your shirts I love them just ordered 4 more lol great vid !!!!!!!!
Well at least you are not flying Trump/Pence/MAGA flags on your truck. I will give you points for that.  no one can be an American and support them fascists.
The original build still runs around my little town in CO!! Love to see it still cruising, it was the most iconic truck!
Guys this is amazing, I hope to meet you in future, is amazing how you where start and what are you become
Love how he admitted that some of the trucks were actually hacked together lmao
I remember 2012 Era I was in the army broke asf with my clean 6.0 putting every dollar I had into building it! And praying to win one of your trucks!!!
Wow! its been a long journey!  Too bad you could not have gotten good advice sooner.  I enjoyed your videos, I live in Cal so the truck would not meet regulations here. Good luck!
My favorite video you've posted. The highs and lows make us! Glad to see your hard work paid off.
Great video! Thanks for sharing your business journey. Very inspiring to those who are still in the trenches building their dream
Great video !!! Answered a lot of questions for me. Hope you had a blessed Thanksgiving 🦃❣️
To be honest as a single mom with cancer at 29yrs old I'd sell this truck so we don't go homeless I can't afford a 90$ Hoodie though :( (I'm in canada) but good luck to you all !!!!!
I'm  done too!
You all work hard to have fun while having fun working hard.
Man u guys built an empire!!!! Good for you guys..... amazing what some motivation and hard work will get you.... God bless
Awesome History 101 of HDS !
Awesome truck, I would love to own it and deliver my firewood with it. I would love to put my company name on both doors with your logo on the fenders. We all had to start from the bottom and work our way up. A lot of blood sweat and tears but if you're determined anything can be accomplished. Respectfully, Godspeed.
You didn’t tell us if Dave still lives at the office? 😏
From day 1 Diesel bro are legends and good good ppl
Never give up, never give in. There is always a solution if you really want it to happen. Also, keep your eyes wide open because opportunities usually find their way into view from the sidelines. And lastly, behind every success is, aside from an understanding and supportive spouse in some cases, a loyal friend that’s the rock where pivotal timing seems to be their most valuable attribute. Great story. I’ve had similar experiences of fail, brush off, and keep at it and can tell you for a fact from experience that perseverance definitely pays off. 👍🏻😎👍🏻
31:53 - lol
If you didn’t put that stupid click bait title on this video and named it for what it was I would of watched it days ago. I almost didn’t even watch it because of the title.  But it was a great video and story horrible title!!!
I didn’t think you had Land Rovers in America for some reason 🤔 didn’t there used to be some kind of import restriction on them?
Diesel bros got boring when Redbeard disappeared.
What happened with the if I remember right bathe Federal law Suit against you two ???
I like watching you guys helping people I wish I could get out that way and be one of the bearded I mean one of the guys 😁
Beautiful truck
Like your show, 2BReality is Ready to Work from anywhere ?
Do your original mechanics still work with you?
When I had to Pause Wednesday on Netflix, It had better be good!
Thank you for putting this vedo out, it help explain my main question, were did the $$ come from. I have worked hard for every thing I own. That's just the way I was raised. I totally respect a man that will bust there but to get what they want. I now see Heavy D in a different light . But I still think they went the wrong way with the stolen truck episode. I have had a lot of thing stolen from me . the biggest thing were a '56 dodge pu and a '57 Chevy pick up which was stolen two times in one day and I never seen them again. So it might be classified as P T S D .Because it triggered a flash back or some thing and I was with them till they ripped the container apart. It was a that point that I knew this is a crock of shit. That was when I thumbed down and unsubscribed . So I have given this one a thums up but will not resubscribe at this time.
What a roller-coaster ride! Thanks for the round-up. And best of luck for all the 'new' content. 👍
So glad your  dreams came.true. I  hope that you inspired alot of young people to  follow  their  dreams. Congratulations!!!
Got to be the best video you fellas have put out this far, amazing journey to where you are today 👏👏
I prefer trucks!!!  You all make awesome trucks
Coming to the comment section to double check that this video about a new truck build wasn't like the last one... 😅
Badass that you never settled
I buy and sell cars and trucks as well, i really enjoyed this video
If I buy some thing do my entery points get accounted for automatically
Pre-hairy apes... Congrats gents. Returns in life come after hard work and dedication. When someone says you can't, you have always figured out how instead of taking "you cna't" for an answer. Adapt and overcome boys. Semper Fidelis, or SFMFs! Be safe and continue the fight. Location 8 tours? JS - also, if we win something, can we offer our rides (original 2004 f250, my baby) that need some work? I would be willing to give it to a fellow disabled vet. Adapt and overcome boys. Semper Fidelis, or SFMFs! Be safe and continue the fight.
Please tell me y’all ARE NOT going to electric vehicles, that would be devastating! love y’all!
Woah! So odd seeing old pics of babyfaced, clean shaven Daves! How cool!
Hahaha that’s where my first tow yard when I start my towing company
Goodbye guys gonna miss you x
Great story thank you for sharing
Glad you stayed true to yourself and have built an incredible empire.

What a fantastic look back. There is no doubt that so many people are glad you did. We are greatful to be able to come along and be witness to how funny and thoughtful you and Dave are , as well as your crew with all the rescues and support you give to stranded folks. The broke down school bus going from Idaho , where i was born , trying to get to mexico setting them up in a hotel while fixing the bus. I am so happy for your sucess. ✌✌
You started this video with don't want seat belt hater's. and you put them on, just the once. Lol love you guy's super big. you are the kindest people I've never met Thank You. LonnieRay

That is one awesome BIO, been a fan of yours for several years. I love to see people succeed, you never fail unless you quit,  Good Job !. & Thank you for sharing...
Bad welds
I'd love to win a truck
Wouldn't it be crazy if you gave that truck away to a die-hard fan from day one who couldn't even afford to buy merch because he's living in a fifth wheel saving to buy a house embracing the struggle I'm just saying I would love to have it but my old lady would shoot me in the face if I spend $1
That was pretty cool video to be honest. It had me thinking it was really stolen lol
Great story of what it takes to get to where you want to be. You have to be willing to lose everything to achieve your dreams.
Urgent for D brothers, I just sent you a note at your store on line PLEASE READ B 4 you give away truck, from 101asllc !!!...
What brand jacket is diesel wearing
good bye fake content
2:37 im in😍🫡👍
And?
RADOMN comment: where can I find that hoodie? Camo and black 💪🏼💪🏼
This was amazing! What a story
Blue Collar Guys! You both represent what this country is all about. Failure was never an option and you succeed because you never lost focus. I always enjoy your videos and content. You are all some really good dudes! God Bless You All and Happy Thanksgiving!
Hey there Heavy D , I have been a fan of your shows on cable and YouTube for many years! I noticed today that you used to work with Rockwell watches ⌚, and I am a watch collector and in my searches for watches I found a watch brand named Diesel and now I am wondering if you have any thing to do with this brand ? I have heard some good things about this brand , though I don't own one as of yet ! Anyway I have wasted enough of your time , I was just wondering ! Anyway I love your shows and all you guys do ! BTW if you look at those watches on line  I think you will understand my questions about you and the Diesel watches!
One thing I can say is that you men built it all with those hard working hands and tough heart. I still watch the re-runs on Tv, stay watching on youtube to. Love the work you’ve put out. 🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Nothing but blessings and great adventures.
I grew up in Utah. I Know the road you are filming on.  My first shop 'didn't have a paint booth that we did not paint the building inspectors vehicle in'.
Yeah, this was a perfect video, i'd always wondered about your beginning days, great video 🙏
God bless you all and God Bless America.  ❤
amazing truck  - and great to hear the story. unfortunately I can't justify paying $30 or more - especially living in the UK on £700 a month - with gas prices tripped, then doubled then tripped again... Fuel is still upwards of £2 without ALL the risks being proved a fake... SO ordering a t-shirt with shipping would mean I can't heat my flat. I've Eheers Danlos, fibromyalgia, chroninc health and much more, so cooooooold winters in Northern Ireland is not doing my arthritis any good. BUT i'd am trying my best co complete my 5th masters to then move onto a PhD - hopefully in Australia - then to move to the US to work as a university lecturer, and eventually run as GOVENOR as I want to make REAL CHAGE (mostly linked to my PhD which is developing affordable, durable modular housing that offer dignity and respect... So I'd LOVE to have that truck when I do eventually move in 4odd years... Make it into a utility truck and have a camper set up on top to travel the US and fall in love with the landscape.  I guess I will just have to keep loving your programmes. (I am working on a podcast and videos based on those with mobility issues trialling different cars but I will also cover going through shops and dealing with doctors. I need to get my Masters thesis done (redeveloping refugee camp architecture and challenging the policies that make it all "temporary)... Then I NEEEED to get back out travelling as I've been here for too long... Then the PhD starts.   All the best - I know it will be get a brilliant  response.
I'm pretty sad yall aren't gonna do giveaways anymore but I can understand
Youre an AWESOME bunch of guys, and seeing your journey is inspiring.  Envisioning your dream, and working hard to achieve it, despite hard lessons and hard knocks, is something we need to see more of in this world.  Godspeed to achieving all your future dreams!  To infinity and beyond!!!!  🥰
So what’s next?
Are y’all going to still make videos
Nice story Brothers, Good Guys and Motor Heads.  Whish you the best
Too cool!❤
Dave  "Hi, this is not an advertisement" Also dave  "this truck is why we made the video"  16:30
Well done, well deserved. I've enjoyed watching you, Dave, and the crew over the year's. I might enter for the first time.
I want rattletrap lol I have the perfect home for it here in KY
Man that dude loves to talk.. I feel. Sorry for the quiet friend.
Well I'm glad you didn't never give up look what you've accomplished now keep doing it big man
Really enjoyed hearing your origin story gentlemen.
Nothing wrong with crying Dave, if I don't cry 5 times a day there's something wrong.. Lol 👍
B E A Utiful truck! Nice ride through the years! Ya'll rock it ... been a fan for A LOT of years! Looking forward to your next "thing"!!! Please share more details about this build. I feel like a member of your team ... really! You had me at diesel! LOL
Can I enter the contest without downloading an APP?
It never fails. You're giving a truck away and scammers are trying to scam your subscribers. They are trying to scam me right now but I'm not an idiot like the scammers are.
So sick of this ish.
Awesome flat bed truck reminds me of my buddy's 1942 Ford he rebuilt it from the ground up! Used stainless steel and Tek I was beautiful we drove all over town in that truck!
Started watching you guys on discovery and just warmed to your humour and awesome builds. Loved seeing you help out that man who's boat was grounded. Thank you YouTube for this awesome channel. Peace and Love from New Zealand 🕊️❤️🙏
ALRIGHT LADS IM WATCHING FROM IRELAND 5HANKS FOR THE UPLOAD ! EIRE !
so whats next ? electric trucks ?
I enjoy watching you guys! I look forward to watching you guys! You are amazing!
Good news! Time to move on to something new and exciting!!😃
Clickbait probably?
Just an amazing story........Keep up the great work you guys do.....
Dave, I admire you and your team for all the cool things you guys do and the cool thing I wish I could do like drive cool trucks and fly the helicopter. One thing most people don't see is the struggle one needs to go to get to the top. Manny people may see you and think look this rich guy showing off not knowing everything you went through to get where you got.  I really appreciate this video and more than ever my admiration for you has growth even more than before and not only that but you give us hope that if we work hard we can reach our goals and dreams. Happy thanksgiving and may God continue to bless you, your family and your entire team! cheers! 🍻🍾
🇺🇸
Proof that Perseverance=Prosperity.
This is so click baity
Good old Bandvagn 206! It's not a "Swedish" version on anything though, it's a Swedish design that's been exported all over the world. In use by the US Army and Marines, UK, Spain and dozens of others. The Sisu Nasu is a later 80s "clone" produced, entirely new design that just looks similar to a 206. By that point the Finns had been using the 206 for decades, little brother always with his copying ;)
You guys remind me of fast and louds Richard Rowland and Aaron coughman
i couldnt afford to win that truck lmao the fuel and taxes would put me under in todays economy. cause of this economy we in now i went from moving ahead to standing still and somethings gotta give and it aint gonna be me thats for damn sure
As an retired Aerospace Tech and specializing in Search & Rescue etc, I wish I was younger getting old really bites Thank You and the entire Gang for who you are !!!!!!!!!
Man.. I wish i could win that truck but im only 16 and i just got my first truck, a 1996 Dodge laramie SLT club cab V8 but still taht 12v is amazing keep up the great work my brother!
I need that truck!!!! Please!!!
garbage forgets its roots.
Love your Passion and Creative Minds!  Good for You...
How wild of a journey and to see it all come together over the years is a true inspiration! Great job!
I didn’t realize you were also flipping trucks at auctions, but I’ve noticed some of the same trucks and vehicles that I have bought and sold like the Oshkosh trucks, and ambulances, wreckers etc. I also started with nothing, still don’t have a shop but I’ve worked a few nickels into dimes and I have about $85k in 2 trucks that I’m trying to get as close to $100 as I can then with that I’m gonna do it over and over until I have enough money to pay for a shop space because in my area you can’t find a shop for even $5000 a month. It’s awesome to see that you were kinda doing the same stuff I have been. I really don’t even care if I get a dealers license but if I could get one I would focus on scrap / parts and just a handful of higher end work - diesels a year
Other Then Diesel Dave, Do you have any of your original employees? (the Mechanics)
I’m very happy for you guys great people
Thanks for taking us on your amazing journey. Can't wait to see what's next for you and the crew. Thanks for all the hard work, laughs , and amazing badass builds! Looking forward to the next chapter!
Good idea keeping them beards
Love seeing this! As someone starting out, facing failures and hard times. I like hearing stories like this! Thank you for the motivation!
hmmm probably illegal to require a purchase for entry. just food for thought.
In the beginning, where did you live and support a wife?
Si the mexican mechanics still work with yall
I just love you guys you are just the best of the best an your morals an what you stand for but sometimes you get fed up of the fight all the time but I'm so glad you made it you all make me smile you have a great crew standing with you both 💙💙💙

Your journey has been a pleasure to watch.  Love your content and everything you are doing now is so special.  Looking forward to see what lies in your future and wish you nothing but success.
Great episode 👊
US 12 valve was the first time I started watching.   Got a signed pic of diesel Dave.  Good memories
Correction, the Sisu is a modification of the BV 206 that you had. It originated in sweden, made by BAE systems Hägglunds. The Finns have later made their own from scratch I believe tho
I enjoyed watching this and hearing about your experience and the knowledge that you have achieved from shear hard work from the lows to the high over the years. Keep the faith, inner believe and trust in your dreams because positivity outweigh negative stuff that happens in everyone's lives. Hope you all have a fantastic Thanksgiving weekend. Happy Thanksgiving to you all. Sending Positive vibes prayers and blessings to you all from Lincolnshire UK 🇬🇧💜🤗🙏
I'm going to buy something just for the chance to win that sweet truck. I win it it'll be a wrecker. I've been looking for a truck to put my booms on and it would be perfect 🙏🤞
Sooooo What happened to Paco and the Rey of the guys ? Where they at?
Cant wait until other videos come out. I really enjoy watching you guys no matter what you do. Thanks & Happy Thanksgiving to all of you 👍🦃♥️
Quit putting miles on my new truck
🥇🦈
A great tale of friendship and hustle. You bagged on the 12v valve so much I would love to see it rebuilt to modern specs.
What is up with the red screen when you are talking about welding at the frezzer building it has a couple of different languages and doesn't fit the context of the video
The king of clickbait
😎 Happy Thanksgiving 🦃
Hopefully it's the end of overly produced click bait.
Awesome! What a great journey you guys have been on. I'm looking forward to where this goes from here.
The desire to achieve, working all the way up the ladder is just beautiful to see, kudos guys
oh yeah that's what me and my late big brother and I always use to do aka barn finds good deals at times if I can get my Southern Saskatchewan you tube up and going right now trying to find and down load a free editing one  my channel will be from daily repairs of all vehicles to doing die cast customs and very reasonable resales on them to trucking stories yes I'm a senior truck driver
That is an awsum story of how hard work and percaverance pays off. You all seem to have big hearts and caring attitudes toward.

Kick ass video

Love you all
I need to  come to work for you please
We all love you guys sincerely Dave lol
thank you for sharing it was well done and I finally Understand your journey to how you became Famous, keep going and living Big from a small Canadian man in North West Territories I appreciate you. :}
I loved that video! Being an old lady, I appreciate a good joke and the acting was great. Everyone believed you! I am 70 but I love trucks. We own a 2017 lifted F350 and I am still raising and lowering myself in and out of the truck with full body arthritis. Don't take away my running boards as I can sit and pee in the middle of the desert without lowering myself to ground level. Thank you for sharing your dream with us.
Even the BOTS like you guys with their replies. 🤣  Best of luck in your next adventure. Keep us in the loop please.
Love this!!!
Awesome Guys! Thank you for this opportunity and for the incredible video showing your roots!! I've made a purchase so I will be hopeful!! Stay safe and keep doing what you do!!
gee...maybe get a shave and a haircut?...haha...great vid...greetings from canada...
Thanks for the insight of your growth it inspires me to start thinking its possible to start my business dream im ready for the hard work highs and lows hope to finally meet you guys one day
70$ a hoodie and 30$ a t-shirt? Wtf those are race track prices. I'm not against making money but damn lol
Why is this 'the end'?
In the early 2000s I worked for a hay farming family in the central California valley. The father of the family once told me “hard work creates its own luck”. He and his son had been through the ringer just trying to make things work. I have very fond memories of that family and the lessons I learned from them. Although not an ag background your story is near the same. Going to show that hard work creates its own luck. Congratulations on the growing success.
God bless you both you are amazing men and awesome family always May you both have a blessed and beautiful time always keep up the faith of family and friends 🙏🙂🤠😎👍
Thanks for all yalls hard work and dedication opened the eyes for alot people
Some dumb click bait.
Sorry, whats over? lol
HAPPY HAPPY THANKSGIVING boyz  thankyou all so much for all that you do
I want that truck! entered.
Great video. I like how you decided to leave out anything about the massive fine you had to pay and why you got it.
Do you think you would be as big as you are without the TV show
That was great Thanks for sharing the journey your perseverance has paid off I would love to hear the rest of the story with Discovery channel I know you have also been through a couple hard times with the lawsuits yet again you came out on top hats off to you Dave for following your dreams. A true Testament of what you can do and be in America.
What a amazing video guys ! I really have a lot of respect for everything you guys have done 💪🏻👍🏻
Thank you so much for the inspiration! You have no idea.
Great vid guys loved the story of the hustle
These guys have always stepped in when others couldn't. They have big hearts and seek adventure. Badass all around.
🥲. ❤️❤️❤️
Why do you guys advertise Chinese Scams? You guys seem like such good guys but then you rip off your own audience for $
You boys are a great inspiration to the young.❤❤❤
Going EV
You guys are a couple of shysters😂
ty .. i think this is one of my favorite vids, well one of them.. there is many lol.. I not eligable to enter the truck contests etc. Allthough most my living family is US residents, veterans, etc, im still not a US-citizen. I was aiming to be one, pre covid, when i was in spain 2019, I started some paperwork, but it was all halted, in 2020. Now I dont know. health stuff keeps me back, and my norwegian goverment, well Ive been battleing them since my stroke 17 or so years ago, they still refuse to help me out..  I dont remember the year.. But thank you guys, for the travels, the adventures, the legacy, and the wizard.. Happy thanksgiving!
Kind of funny 15:30 where you say” in the back of my mind there was a dream of having a facility where I could have a shop and everything all together” as you drive past the current facility. 😁
I've followed you boy's from the start,I get all emotional like where family.
If a 44-year-old woman from Sweden, I might not fit into your audience 🤣 But I love your videos! 💫
No recovery calls this week dave? 😌
Has nothing to do with what's going on with Adventures with a purpose being arrested for child rape?
America...
Heavy Dave you're awesome build some nice things stay safe God bless
Love you guys. Wish all the best for you.
Im surprised they didn't look out the window at 15:25
its good to see self made men
Dave you need to make that "Cash for Wrecked Cars" Flier into a hat and shirt, thats hilarious.
Such a cool truck! I always wanted to build an engine thought having that knowledge would be so cool! Well being a woman and growing up when I did my mom thought I was crazy  literally!  To the point I went to a psychiatrist then sent away to school  Funny how times have changed there's girls playing football now and in the military ect.I was just ahead of my time I guess.  I really enjoy your channel and all the things you do was so excited when you started helping Brent cause I'm a fan of his too!  Thank you for all the awesome videos you and your crew do You are aces in my book 👍
How can i win thiis truck
We all have stories. Some better than others, some worse off than others. We will defiantly all have endings, again, some better than others and some worse off than others. I myself have lived a crazy nomadic life. Never really staying in one place for more than 2 yrs at a time. This put me in the lives of many people who ranged in many different ways. The one thing I think society has gotten away from, in these days where social media can make you anything or anyone you want to be. Some abuse this, some respect this bit all are affected by it. If there was one thing I could say to everyone is this, "You can walk a million miles in someone's shoes but you can never wear their feet" you never know what a person has gone through and may never know, but none the less we are all human.
Love this but I wanna see more Blackhawk content!
I've followed you guys since season 1 and the come up that yall have had is truly inspiring. I absolutely love yalls content and love watching the YouTube videos. Keep up the amazing work guys. Yall are nothing short of inspirational. Thank you.
I’m a Army Veteran I love watching show like this I got a 2000 Dodge ram that I used daily and next summer I got do body work on. My brother got it for me went my Mom was in the hospital she doing fine and I did enter the drawing and got myself a shirt good luck in the future
LOVE YOU GUYS....Where did you get that sweatshirt?  cammo with old glory?
Inspiring!! Dedication, Courage, Faith. Great Job guys!
Thank you for sharing your story
Diesel to electric?🤣
lm a litle intimedated at the videos  you do like 100 subscriber is un worthy
Such an inspiring story 🙏  ⚡ The Diesel Bros⚡
Thought for the first time The other dave will be allowed to talk! 😂
😎
I appreciate your view on success principles and how you leveraged them. Thank you for sharing your journey!
Awesome
As a new small business owner just finishing up its first full year in business, this video was very inspiring. Thanks for sharing your journey.  Can't wait to see what you have for us next.
Amazing journey guys. Thank you!
What an amazing story. A dream i wish i knew how to take on.  Just confused by what is meant by it being your last give away ever. Guess we will all have to wait and see what your next chapter holds
I too am a disabled combat veteran and I have to tell you that even if ya don't win a truck the clothes that I've bought from DPG are literally some of thee most comfortable that I own their heavyweight hoodies are insanely thiccc and warm and the t shirts do not stretch on you when worn throughout the day (or two🤫) you could literally sleep in them and wake up n run right out the door and still look like a million bucks! Sure I wanted to win a truck too but atleast you know that you're buying very top quality products when entering if you don't win lol
I love, I mean absolutely love the fact that you were so fortunate to have such a loyal tremendous giving and no doubt hard working honest friend such as Diesel Dave. The dynamics of the way you two function together are just beyond words but priceless. I believe your entire crew deserves a huge degree of credit of course and not enough can be said of just how great everyone works together and so incredibly hard, anywhere, anytime, day and night.  Diesel Dave is a treasure, a great friend & partner for your business who’s been instrumental in its growth. Congratulations on your success  !
Love you guys. Your the best. Don't ever give up. Hand pump.
Do people build these ridiculous lifted trucks and expect admiration lmfao.
Why is it your last diesel powered pickup?
Really, you are going to to do this on Thanksgiving, so disappointed in you, breaking contracts, not keeping your word. If you were staring Clint Eastwood in the eye on all these contracts then defaulted, what would you say publicly. Just disappointed in your business acumen . Count me out of the contest. Life is too short.  Your word is worth more than any credit ratting agency, than any bank that will not loan any money to millions of people just like you. Expected more.
The American dream,  love it
Mobile game store needs decent games. Money grabs an all.. story is good on playstation an stuff. People there looking for something cool. Creative field, er something.   Abes oddysee is a favorite of mine.   👊
Made it by the skin of your teeth
8 is Great 🤙🏼
This is great.  I have been following you for some time and remember some of the events
What ever happened to the two Mexican mechanics? lol
I want to complement you on how gorgeous that U.S. 24 Valve build is... but I've learned my lesson on how jealous my old Dodge is, and I'd like for it to crank tomorrow morning... ifkyk
Does red beard still work for you
Which one is the child predator?
It would be awesome to come out to your hq with the tribute car & meet some veterans and those who serve 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Awesome video guys! Great job editors looks amazing!
Love your show and your spirit guys, happy thanks giving to all of you, long time fan and follower of your channel
Does that truck have rear sway bar?
How do I enter the contest?
What kinda trailer is that at 20:56? Looks like exactly what i want
please don't leave
Man an end of an era excited to see what comes next
I'm on a complete opposite path. Made rank recently in the Navy, and have just over 10 years left in this career. Instead of spending the next 10+ years with a steady job, and no need to ever worry about money, I decided to do what I'm truly passionate about, and become a pilot. To say I'm scared is an understatement, but I would of rather tried and failed, then to never try at all. (I'm almost 40, I don't really have time to wait another 10 years.)   Been a fan of yours for a while now, and I hope I have success like you two in the near future. Wish me luck.
My brother that truck is a dream come true. I really loved. Blessings and success. I wish you the best. From Miami Florida.
Guys I have watched yall since yall started and purchased  tons of merchandise  over the years and I just want to say thank you for all yall do and Happy  turkey day to yall and your families.
Repent to Jesus Christ “Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” ‭‭Psalms‬ ‭23‬:‭6‬ ‭NIV‬‬ R
I just started a small heavy duty diesel repair side gig. And what grabbed me out of this whole thing was harbor freight welders… I have a small 110v welder that’s cheap… and old generator my dad gave me and my tools in my 04 dodge. I have a family of 5 on 1 income and I’m blessed because we always have what we need. I work full time 7-4 get home by 4:30 kiss my kids and wife eat a couple greasy sandwiches and take off for my side gig till 10 or 11pm every night. The only way a family got rich was by hard work or the lottery is what my pops said. There was no other way. I see the fruits of your labor of hard-work and sacrifice. Your an inspiration to me!! You guys are awesome!
Super proud of you guys and happy to have you guys as Utah locals. Keep doing the good work and I hope to stop by soon to support the business.
Thanks for sharing your journey, you guys are awesome, keep up the good work.
Awesome Story...... Hard work and perseverance pays off!
1:25... Wait, was that truck moving remotely controlled?...
Can not wait to see what is next. Only started wa5ching your channel like 2 weeks ago and I have watched over half your videos already. I enjoy all that you all do
31:55 what is this
Awesome, I pray that whatever is next goes even better than anything you ever imagined.
Awesome episode boys.  Very cool story too.  Rock on.
Been watching you guys for years!!! Its Badass how far you guys have come. Living in Idaho and now near Salt Lake City its cool how you guys are in the same area. Working in the  Oilfields for the last 10 years I started my own business and get motivated watching these kinds of videos..
Incredible story !!!!🏁 This is why I love helping small business grow !!!!!! Cash flow and funding when you don't have the best credit 💳 but you do have some cash flow. Nowadays BAM your in the game.
Dedication! Congrats boys!👍🏻✊🏻✌🏻
Y'all better not be telling us you're finished building real trucks and instead, switching to electric garbage to appease the climate cultists...
Great video! Very interesting to see the evolution of your business.
I just love following this video, everyone starts somewhere.  My husband, now deceased, we worked ranch jobs, so yes I get the moving! Keep it up, I enjoy your videos.
their is something shady about these dudes mark this comment
Great story but how are you supposed to make it with zero rich friends or generous people who own buildings or a guy like Dave who made the viral video that kickstarted everything?
Hey y’all. Love your videos but there is a thing on Facebook saying your having a give away. Idk 🤷🏼‍♀️ I registered incase its real but I’ve gotta feeling it’s fake 😮
this guy looks like one of the "Patriot Prayer" blokes from Vantucky Washington, LOL
What if you subscribe but by Saturday and can't buy merch?
Congratulations on all the success
What about Joel Buschman
When are ye coming back to TV??????
i have always wanted to enter the give away you do but because i live in the uk it has been impossible to do so :(
man you guys are fast. I'll be 50 and slowing down. I am an older smaller scale of what you guys do. it's like you approached a stock in the market to invest..and saw what kind of audience fed it instead. True success. great story.
Brother I feel your pain and your success. I did everything you mention in this video. There is no success without failure.
Totally sweet build.
I am not a American. But i love America. And see that flag behind the car feels amazing. I have 7 usa flags. Love the video's.  Greetings from The Netherlands 🇺🇸🇳🇱
Never entered before because my story isn't so successful. But a truck like this could save me. Probably not but it's worth missing a couple meals to try. Have nothing else to loose at this point. If you ever open shop in Phoenix. I can help you with your construction needs. Maybe you could save my k2500 before I have to sell it
whats the announcement??
Wait… what’s going on. Where are you guys going? What happened? 😢
Wow what a video. I’ve been watching since season one and it’s going to be such a change and I won’t lie I’m a bit sad about it but I know it’ll be good for you guys. Keep being awesome.
Thank you for your selflessness  guys.
Hey I hope you and your guys have a happy Thanksgiving.
Great video.  What an inspiration.
wow
@ 31:54 ...  ???
31:54
Great  video, Heavy D.♥♥♥
🏁🏁🏁
Yeah it is .🙏✌
I hate the sales pitch ruined a wholesome vid
Jesus please tell me it isn’t an EV “model”…
The true power of never giving up! Amazing story. Do you still employed the same mechanics??? Jose and his team ?
WHERE DO YOU BUY THE MYSTERY BOX?
Don’t go electric… not yet. Give it 20 years
I sure hope the show isn’t being canceled because I will surely miss you guys. Loved everything you did and you’re great people. Love your stance on immigrants and keep hiring Hispanics because they are very hard workers. We need some here in Virginia. Well if that’s the end thanks for showing us your lives and how you build those beautiful trucks and entertaining us too
Happy Thanksgiving!
Biden 2024
Have a Happy Thanksgiving!
Beautiful.. its an honor to watch you guys.  Done well i love your friendship..you both are just amazing.  Fantastic journey and heres to many more to come..
Thanks for the videos
There is going to be a lot of movement on the Sealed Indictment. You will see names that where in households for the last 400 years. Tracing lineages and crimes back generations. We are leaving no stone unturned. We are going to get every last one of them and ensure that nothing like this can ever occur again. It’s going to be Biblical, Monumental and Historical.  We are talking about a simultaneous cascading take down that will place within side of a 4 hours period around the entire world. That is the military brilliance of 30 nations. This is a phenomenal operation and that moment is coming.   We are waiting for the Beast to take itself down. Then we go in FAST.  The Hunter’s have become the HUNTED!? This is a Cleansing of the World. Hooah / WWG1WGA
Thank you for sharing a grate American history. After looking at my Excursion with 100K miles and no be able to work on it because of illness, I see how perseverance and hard work it is all possible. Keep up the good work, wish you all the best, and hope one day I will travel to Salt lake and meet you in person. The best to all of you, and happy thanksgiving.
I love that jacket where can I get one feom
You ppl are alright , dig the builds , the auction is definitely a great direction , Best Wishes , Happy Holidays , 🙏
I'm impressed, you always put on a good show. Very entertaining, helping others. I've have been binge watching your vids for the last 3 hours, lol so good. What a laugh, yer all nutters. So glad to see you have made it & Happy doing it. You made me Happy just watching. Thanks, a million. All the best from across the pond in UK
Okay guys I'm looking for a van under $5,000 but I can build into some sort of temporary camper sleepover deal so I can park it in the underground parking at the hospital when my son is in there because I can't afford hotels. It has to be something I can fix up because five grand is an expensive vehicle for me to pay on. Please put your knowledge to work I got antiques to trade and I know where there are at least a hundred Hidden Gem cars in outbuildings and Morton buildings on farms around here in Iowa that I wouldn't hesitate to introduce you to the owners. Hint hint. Trade dealing.
I got a camo Diesel Bros beanie and I don't even like Diesel :P   no matter where you land, we'll keep following..
What hoodie is HeavyD wearing?
I just joined your 2 and a half million subscribers and enjoyed what I've seen. Keep up the work and happy Thanksgiving, Gil
I am 78years young and i enjoy watching you guys  Keep up the great work you do .
I love the truck. you guys really know how to build a show truck/work truck.

You guys are AWESOME!!! Please ditch the beards.
All good things come to end.
You guys are freaking awesome love your videos and it's good to see you again
This is awesome. I cannot tell you how many times I have started over.  But hearing all of this. I love it.
Love the merch and videos. Can't wait to see what's coming up next. What color green is that wrap? I want to rap my Ram 2500.
So what’s over exactly.. just the giveaways
Stealing from subscribers is my guess how you got there
Still waiting for mystery boxes what a rip
Wow that truck i like it, sad this that i dont see that on the Nederlands. Greetz from Sneek.
You guys are amazing. I love hearing the struggle. Proud you are where you are, not even knowing you. Just proud to see hardworking men aiming higher. Good for you guys. Keep on keeping on.
Them
I absolutely love dodge ram so I hope to God I get it. I loved him for like the past 10 years and I’m only 19.
I'm a broke mo fo how can I enter to win?
Glad it has worked out for you guys and that your hard work paid off and became a positive story you can share with others. Thank you for all of the content over the years.
God bless America Amen
Best 48:14 minutes I have experienced in  while from the net except for UGA football.
Been struggling with custody battle driving a crappy prius 7yr old wants a house and truck. Now keep praying for it to happen.  Divorced and single father of 1 is a pita. But wouldn't change it for the world
Badass!!
Don't do that to me! I was scrolling and saw Heavy d and it's over! I was so upset!
Two guys with over the top beards selling merchandise for 48 minutes. 👌
great vid, thanks
You sold me.a truck with that harbor freight welder you need to redo the work
One thing I know is struggles, I really like you guys. Very genuine and honest, Pretty hard to come by these days. Good luck with your raffle. Hope to see many more videos of awesome trucks.
Very cool story! Continued success to you guy's!
You guys are great I hope you keep making YouTube films you do so much great work for the poor people thank you from the bottom of my heart
I am so 😊 happy that you had the courage to keep going. 💛 You guys never gave up. All the help you gave everyone. No matter how dangerous it was you gave it your all. God Bless all of you. Keep safe and all of you ❤️ 🙏 and your 👪 have a Happy Thanksgiving 😊
So fun to see the doors they have opened with hard work and determination. I’m excited to see where they take us next.
Im starting right where you guys did. This year i started my auto repair buisness and only have a few customers. I have no idea what im doing just figuring it out as i go while still working a fulltime job. Thanks for posting this video because it really gives me hope if I work my ass off, it will pay off.
Happy Thanksgiving what a great looking truck.
I love you guys! I'm probably not your average  viewer. I am a 62 year old grandmother of 5! You guys are great.  How do I sign up to win the truck? My kids and grandkids would think I'm the coolest grandma ever! I would drive it too!!!!
You need to move from your current location hoss. I stopped by and that traffic is crazy. How many accidents do you see in front of your shop? Get a big spread with easy access to tourists.
Love the show. Also dig the camo jacket you are wearing. Where can I find it?
You guys are the real deal. Down to Earth. Willing to work for what you want. You give back 10 fold. You are happy family men that just get life.  Hope you all have much more happiness and good fortune in future endeavors.
To you  and  your  family  and  friends  have  a  happy  Thanksgiving  from  Terry dobson  in Michigan
Your ambition. Your drive and your friends, your just overwhelmingly good people! God bless!!
Bro is definitely the Son of that actor from the 80’s  Or @ least related.   The orange beardMan looks exactly like Him  I can’t think of His name but I’ll figure it out & see what’s up   I can’t believe if they’re not related.   Dude looks just like Him  I think the actor was in Revenge of The Nerds  if I’m remembering right off hand 🤔
True brotherhood and team!
Little ironic with the inversion in the background. 🤡
Realize that being fortunate enough to have 1 friend close in your lifetime, close like you guys is a real blessing. A scarce blessing.👍🏼👍🏼
You guys are an inspiration of what can happen if you just keep grinding.  Love the videos.
Love y'alls story. Perfect example of the American Dream!
So, this is kinda like a goodbye huh? Or maybe see you soon... thanks for everything guys...
Yo that was an awesome  story .
Respect!
I have always wanted to know how you guys started. Now this information is very vital and encouraging. I am motivated knowing that everyone has a strong story from scratch to fame. Blessings upon you always Heavy D and sparks crew 🥰💯 legit respect 👍
LOVE your videos but times are tough on the farm the struggles are real bad now and now trying to pay down my debt so i can save my farm WHY? i dont know but im ashamed to say i do not have 5 bucks on me i am doing EVERY thing i can sending EVERY penny to the bank cause in 42 years of farming ii have never been this scared the way the country is going.   EVERY thing except seed i buy for the farm has doubled and tripled to me but NOT what i receive for pay from the crops.   keep up the good work i love watching you guys and being so helpful the world need more people like you!!!
WOW! I LOVE IT! MAN YOU NEVER GAVE UP AND NOW YOUR KNOWN WORLDWIDE AMAZING 🤘😎🤘
Hustlers - very impressive ! 💪🏼🏆👍🏼
Happy Thanksgiving Diesel Boys!  Looking forward to seeing video of your journey… thanks for sharing!
Thank you for showing us your journey!  It goes to show what it takes to be successful in business both the ups and the downs.  To me the moral of this story not only has the obvious component of hard work and tenacity but the willingness to be flexible and not painting your business into a corner and even more that you have fun along the way.
Dave this is the first time I have commented on one of your videos sounds like you are a true American success story thru hard work and vision. Thank you for helping me make it through my chemo and bone marrow transplant to put me in remission. Good luck in the future and I'll keep watching. God bless
Love it yea
Sorry it's over!
respect from denmark
Heavy d and hans i have been watching you guys for a wile now I'm always impressed with your work until I have just watched what you guys did to the red subaru just a big no no what a waist you obviously have far to much money pure disappointment
Did the old crew still working with y’all  or they started their own business?
Wait why aren’t they doing giveaways anymore??
Is there a reason why all these buildings are empty.?! Was this filmed on a Sunday.?!
Lost everything to a fire. In 2019 I opened my dream Detail Shop in Laguna Beach.  January 7th 2022 lost it all to a terrible fire. You guys give me strength.  Thank you
Enjoy watching you guys very very much.  You all give so much from your❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Watching you two makes me wish my best friend (whom is my biological brother) lived closer to me. We have lived in different states for over 30 years. Good to see brothers work together.
🇦🇺🦘💜
Awesome looking truck! And BTW I saw your old AMC Eagle wagon for sale. Still looking pretty sweet! Keep up the great work!
What happen to the Mexican guys
Great story , best of luck in your future endeavours. Never loose that special friendship.
Amazing. You guys make me push even harder to make it happen!!!   Well done 👏 ✔️
I just realized you both are named Dave 😆... Great story about the car flipping, really hits home. I did the same thing here in Vegas for years, literally paid a company to put my flyers on doors and wrapped a bunch of Astro vans with Cash 4 Cars lol... Youtube has been a much more pleasant journey for me so far and appears to be the same for you guys. 🤙🇺🇸
nice
Fake it until you make it...
Just finished your it's over video, love it. I spent 30 years working for Chevrolet dealership, sure wish I would have met you boys. Sure looks like you guys had some great times. I've seen most of your videos must say you remind me a lot of my buddies which are mostly dead now. Couple painters and some mechanics and Truckers all great people. We had a great team we just didn't put it all together like you guys. Wish you all the best of luck and more success in the future!!
i wish i could get a truck like that. as a vet and first responder that truck oe one like it someday would be awesome
love the journey, good luck in future 2023, USA!
I wish I was friends with those guys.
Going to make a guess a here and say that the Nikola truck they've been working on designing is going to be the next big build.
I'd like to  win
Sad to see you go guys
You two were popular in high school and I bet you both were on the football team.
Great story!
Kinda sad man want a heep of your merch but dont ship to Australia :(
Not like heavy D will be reading this. I loved your work and stuff, but after paying $80CAD for a shirt that I was sent the wrong size and y'all wanted me to pay for shipping to send it back. And a dinky car, I lost all interest in. Video on my page (my YouTube is not monetized, so I'm not doing this for views)
Thanks for standing up for what you believe in. That made you guys legends for me.
The best part of it ALL is the bonds forged as a result of having taken the journey together.   Such is the only way to create friendships as deep as yours.  You were rich well before you had any money.   Congratulations!
Dude, @heavy d who puts there phone in there front left pocket 😂
Anybody have clue what brand hoodie Heavy D has on?
Cool thanks we love you guys
I was screwed out of $50.00 from who ever owns or have hack this site.  Careful  I'm Calling FRAUD
I enjoy the behind the scenes / how the business came about. Congratulations on your successes and to many more years. Looking forward to seeing what’s next!
Let me guess custom Hello'$
I was screwed out of $50.00 from who ever owns or have hack this site and I'm Calling FRAUD!
Surrounding yourself around successful people and working hard is a great way to succeed
Super low miles @ 100,000, 😱we would be scrapping that in the UK, hardly anybody would want to but anything with that mileage. 👍
Of all the fine and nice things in your videos that people might envy for one reason or another, the thing i envy the most is your relationship to each other as brothers, thats a valuable thing to have in a life!! Im all most alone since i have no family, sure i do have very good friends but that will never even come close to the bond you guys share
Congratulations on your perseverance and success guy's.
Transitioning away from America. Transitioning away from courage patriotism. Transitioning away from diesel and jobs and farmers to.pervertedd computer ai drones and electric hell. I hope the selling of your souls to Klaus schwaub is its own reward.
I'd love to win this truck but I know for a fact that shipping costs would be insane as I live in Belgium and that the Belgian DMV won't allow this to drive within Belgian borders, ever xd Anyhow, keep up the great content ! This is a great example to never give up !
Washington State that is !! Lol
I don't see where it tells me how long this video been up ? And I'm very interested in that truck !! . I'm from way up the northwest of Washington
How old is this video ?
Appreciate who you guys are, all you have done for orhers
Dam that was a pile of tires somebody dumped on the side of the road !
What an awesome video! Thanks for telling your story.
pretty boring compared to other truck builds.. How many I’s can i hear in 5 minutes
So if you just buy something on the website you’re in the raffle?
🌹sending out condolences to all the people that have passed away in 2019-2020 2021 and 2022 covid-19 the most evil thing done in the history of our lifetime
Super video always nice to see you guys keep wheeling and dealing
You're going to make someone really happy when they get that truck
The truck is a beautiful build looks really nice
I have one question what inspired you guys to grow your beards
Congratulations on your great accomplishments!
I've been watching your videos since you guys started it's really nice to see where you guys are at now I feel like I'm a part of the family here somehow from YouTube
I hope you're buying that property and not renting
That was a super video I didn't know you went through so many shops damn
I sure like have that's truck  Diesel's Brothers build !!!!
I nead a Rollin coal tshirt 😎. Sounds badass
I feel like if you bought cars from heavy d back then you would know exactly what your buying. I dont see him selling people shit.
Well done Guys. The journey of Business I Know so well. 34 years of Having and Not having :) pray that you have ever success for your new Direction . Keep up the good work. Dave from Australia
Peace out man, Glory to GOD.
Didn’t know you were the diesel bros
The two of you are an inspiration to everyone that crosses your path brother. Bless you for paying your good fortune forward. Very glad to have seen your interview where you were proud to express your views about your religion and believing in God. May you go from strength to strength and continue to help others in need.
What in the MK Ultra ? 31:54
This is the American dream. You work hard and live your best life. God bless you both and your families. Ron
Just the title of this video makes me sad..
Who makes that jacket your wearing
You guys are inspiring. Awesome truck build. There has definitely been an evolution in facial hair over the years - from early Dave to current Dave!
Always move forward and let the past go so y'all can b better off
So when DD rolled the rock crawler did the guys buy the truck
May be weird.. but I love that he showed the mistakes made in the journey, while unintentionally leaving an error on the editing side at @31:56. I legitimately love this video, in a weird and wacky way, these guys are insane. Love coming on and seeing a new video pop up, be it the Blackhawk, the crashed aircraft recovery vid, or anything else in between. Keep it up fellas, looking forward to the rest!
Soooo glad ur showing how u got big I was seriously thinking maybe u was trustfund kid or something but hell no!! Way to go man keep up doing what u do
If you are abandoning diesels, I’m out! Will wait and see but if you do some woke electric bullshido you will loose the essence of what you have created! Wish you good luck!
Thank you for sharing your story.
Man! I have been watching from the beginning and i tell ya what a journey! Its good to see yall so successful. What a freakin truck! I sold my baby (2007.5 2500 on 38s)out of hardship a couple yrs back and love seeing it reincarnated as an icon. What a truck and what a story. Good job guys!
You guys have been  good stewards of Gods blessings.
Inspired! You guys are awesome!
Is the lets talk person actual heavydsparks ?
YOU GUYS ROCK!!!!!!
Just think...you coulda stayed at the first place and by now they'd call you Slick D slingin' Buicks to old ladies.
I've watched you guy's since the first give away.  You and your crew are simply the best at what u do... im a life long fan... when driving through slc I wish I had time ti stop at your shop, the busy life of a otr driver... ny to cali and back to ny
I used to deliver to that freezer lol
Have you ever considered using your success to invest in a charity? I have so many students who are not the "college type" But do super well in auto. What if you invested in scholarships, internships, auto and vocational ed etc because our government wants to push kids into college but that leaves so many kids out to dry who are not academically inclined because they are mechanically inclined. My husband is a contractor, no college education and makes more than I do as a credentialed teacher with a Master's Degree. So many students have so much potential but nobody to invest in them. Also a tax break. Im passionate about education... and vocational ed is sorely under appreciated.
Gona miss you guys
You have come far you still have room to grow yet there is a big world out there yet. I would love to set up a place over the pond that can be the link for you in europe
wtf is at 31:54
Absolutely an amazing story of an American dream and sacrifice to the road you guys are at now. Thank you very much for the entertainment these past few years!
sad, if Biden adminstration and globalist have their way. We won't even have diesel power anyhing. Good luck guys...
I am glad you guys have succeeded in life. I am a disabled veteran, and my life has been nothing but failure. I once had dreams of being military for life, being a mechanic.. and all that stuff. Thank you for sharing your history.
Grinding and paint makes me the welder I ain't.
Man this is a badass video!!  It’s Rad you took us all the way back to the beginning and even let us know the struggle and just flat out hard ass work and dedication it takes to believe in yourself and make those dreams you had starting off in an office to the KickAss Diesel Bros!!! Hell Yeah Loved Seeing This👍👍🤟🤟
Looks like your dream came true bigger and better than you expected. I for one am glad.
Good to hear you started with no qualification in car chasis building and modification yet you no doubt built and sold a bunch of super dangerous stuff. Only in Murica
Do a shop tour / office tour of your place
Love the truck!
I'm am so proud of y'all 🤠🤠🤠
So cool to see the progression as you clawed your way into a tough business. I'd only seen about half of these places!
My husband and myself watched you guys for awhile. You like him are good hearted guys. He volunteered on the veteran comitee at work for years, rolling thunder 9 years and several fish fries and Christmas parties at our local VA hospital for years. He traveled to Tenn for operation Stand down for homeless vets 3 yrs. I did these along with him and we were blessed with 30+ years. He passed very unexpectedly last week and we buried him today. My heart and world is shattered. So just wanted to say thank you for all you do. He loved watching you guys.
Great video fellas.  But….  Why do you have the mirrors extended while not towing? It looks kind of dumb TBH.  Is this just a RAM thing, I see guys doing this all over the place.
Time To Go Home 🌎🤴🏼🌎🦅🌎🐅🌎🦁🐺🌎
Hey Dave can i enter this ??? im in New Zealand, Hoping it will fit on our skinny roads :)
....and how they finally managed to grow decent beards.
Love how he never gives credit to his parents who deserve more credit for funding his dreams than the couple vehicle flips he harps on.  Typical Millennial.
Never quit, perseverance. Can't wait to see the next step.
I had to place an order fora chance at this truck. It is everything I have ever dreamed of when it comes to a truck. That manual 5.9 is heaven🤞🏻
Congratulations on moving up one rung at a time, never giving up, keeping close friends and giving back...that's one hell of a legacy.  Wishing you and all those you love even more blessings on your journey.
31:54 ????
Hard work pay off and the will to lean new skills and the drive and will to successfully and the mind set 👌
God I wish I could have one of your cars as my first. But that's a fever dream XD worth dreaming tho
HEAVYDSPARKS , CREW AND FAMIL .you have come a very long way.  The tribute to the first truck you made is awesome, and both trucks are beautiful . On September 14th retired from the national guard reserve and slowly getting money coming in. I will try to buy what I can buy. You have awesome items to buy. May the HEAVYDSPARKS CREW AND FAMILY HAVE A BLESS DAY AND THANKSGIVING  !!!
So like are they going away or something can someone explain
Wasn't it the DAMNED CALIFORNIA E.P.A. THAT SHUT DOWN DIESEL BROTHERS?  I know k&n and ame are up n fully leaving Cali. As well as a few other big  named builders and company's.. Basically if it's powered by gas and you can make it faster funner better more gas conserving then yep California is all up in it. Cuz global warming lmao!! They don't talk about how Californias plates have shifted 12 inches west or the Earth's core heating up..BUT NONO LETS CUT DWN TREES AND PUT UP A BUNCH MORE APARTMENTS AND ADD MORE CONGESTING ROADS .... SMH
The end? But I look everyday for your youtube videos?
Great job
Not bad video JAY AND SILENT BOB !.
i absolutely love this channel
I have loved this video and feel the pride in what you have done.  You two are so much fun to watch, love you both I am hooked into watching your escapades and wish you love and happiness and a wonderful new year.  From Susan Ribeiro in Victoria, B C , Canada See you soon.
It’s about time y’all drag it up.
That goes to show you kids...don't ever give up on your dreams and goals...keep going regardless of what happens and what people think.  It's nice to have been able to see this evolution. 👍👍
You guys are very good job happy Thanksgiving hope you guys do well you got a pretty good if I had your name to be helping everybody out I can nobody cares about every time I ask somebody to help me around here they want money money money
I drove for a company out of wa stand delivered power pole cross arms just around the corner feel in love with the monster  bus I wish I would have stop love your videos your TV show now I want to buy some  gear
Great job guys great job. The American dream still lives on.....god bless and happy Thanksgiving
No I’m not a video guy I’m just an average old soldier trying to appreciate what you guys are doing that’s all I’m an old veteran by myself have 9% of the time I was just saying how good do you go to do the work like you do to you do good work comp list a lot but I’ve been in the military for 20 years I couldn’t come push what are you guys done you guys done a lot to help a lot of people out average Joe’s nobody cares about
I'm gonna guess "Dave" the most "think outside of the box" "go getter" ,innovator etc. you tuber  is joining the electric car/truck leaders and show us how the world is going to  dispose of all the used up electric car/truck carcasses we are about to be flooded with.
Watch you guys all the time I have a small business that is going pretty good. Like to win the truck
Loved hearing this story. Great to see how far you guys have come!
I was thinking during the vid what the audience is drawn to this channel, and I think it has stuff of interest for almost everyone. From a teen into drifting, to a retired tradesman, or military personnel, towing/ recovery people, pilots, mechanics, and just people who like trucks. This channel is appealing to such a wide audience, it's no mystery why its so poular.  Hats off to these guys. They all definitely  deserve the good fortune.
OR TRUCK..
CAN YOU HELP FIND A CHEAP VAN.....
Clickbait as usual.  I love this guys videos quality but the bait is seriously not necessary. Leaves a huge stain on the brand and makes me feel like you think your viewers are dense. Like why bother? Just put out a good video and the title should be actually related to the content.
Helping people out is what you guys are GREAT at! I tried to send Dave a picture of what I wrote about my 84 year old mother, but sadly my cheap flip phone wouldn't do it. Thanks anyway Dave, and keep helping more people. There are thousands more, but you can't help everyone. Have a great Thanksgiving!✌
I'm a retired JSOC veteran... believe you me ... your story is not a singularity , we weren't building a business...but trying to set up a FBO in hostile lands is just as frustrating ! 🤣 Love your American Spirit !!!
Hi guys to move 8 times just shows the determination you had to be successful I’m so glad you shared this with us nobody can ever take away what yous have strived so hard for and to help as many people as you all do shows how kind you all are well done to all you all deserve what you have take care and god bless you guys awesome team ❤👍👌👌
I love it I want it I never have a  truck before  can I have it
My youtube channel
What’s your thoughts on Jared from AWP? You guys touch hearts while Jared touched his cousin and sister.
23:14 funny to see land rover of guilford, ct on the wheel cover on that old truck. I've driven past that dealership hundreds of times, and now I see that on a vehicle 3000 miles away. It's just a little weird. Small world lol
What a journey, so inspiring..much love all the way from Kenya 🇰🇪🇰🇪
Hey good night heavyDsparks i enjoy the show u host I love video so cool nice and good one in great job and bless day
14:15 - so that's where that thumbnail/ meme came from! That clip has been around for a long time, I know I've seen it a bunch of times, not necessarily just on this channel either.
Dealing with people some people want to sue because I can and I will not educated enough to know what real life is about you guys know what real life and help others out like I do
👍❤
Could care less!
Love this story.
Good job on that one appreciate that you guys do what you can and I know you help other people out soon God bless you I know you’re thankful for all the stuff you do
That’s what you guys are grateful for you guys did everything right but being a veteran I’m always usually end of everything everybody forgets about the old Veterans everybody forgets about them I was always asking people to help with nobody wants to help me but I help everybody I can only do so much now and I got two vehicles my friends vehicle and my vehicle is having problems and I’m having a hard time trying to repair them I know you guys are good guys I’m just letting people know how I feel about you guys you guys are really good guys
You guys are out having fun again you guys are always having fun
we need more people like you 2 men,Thanks for who you are,Cheers Bob
Awesome story. Love you guys. Im pretty sure i know what is coming next and I hope it goes farther or higher than elons good ole space x falcon 9 that just launched. Lol
Pretty awesome story and amazing progress you all have made. Excited to see what’s next!
I wish I could afford to buy merchandise so I could get the truck but I’m on disability and raising grandsons   Love you guys
You guys are legends all of you!
The most honest and hardworking
Diesel Dave you are so humble and faithful to your friend.  I have a feeling that you have done more than given credit for. You are my favorite!😎
I don't have $500.00 nor $5.00. I pay my own bills. Don't like flatbeds nor stacks. Still...sick B E A utiful diesel.
Thanks to let us be part of your hell of a story!  Wish you all the best for all new proyect!  Pura Vida!
Did they buy the building they are in now. I did not hear if they did. Great journey 👍. I look forward to all your videos.
I was working for a company down the road from you before you moved in to your current location. I stopped by and bought an office chair for 5 bucks. That chair went with me through college getting my engineering degree, through a business partnership with a co-founder who was defrauding our investor, and I just barely bought myself a new chair a month ago after moving my business to SLC out of my spare bedroom. That chair is where I learned to design. In it, I designed every sled part that I currently offer through Pin'd, every patent figure, every email reaching out to riders, dealers, and manufacturers. It's honestly a terrible chair, but I couldn't not say thank you for it. Had you not moved in, I wouldn't have seen the ad on KSL that happened to be down the street from my summer job and I probably would've gone through college without an actual office chair because I'm that cheap.
Someone is pretending to be you on Facebook and trying to scam people    They have 20+ different accounts
I pray my name gets picked definitely the dream truck of mine.
What was that suspicious screen at 31:54?
What happened to the TV show and everyone that was in it with you ?
Love watching and seeing how you guys have built/maintain one bad ass company. I would love to see a shop tour and see all the things you guys are capable of doing in-house. Keep up the good work!!!
Why so melodramatic?
Wow you literally started from nothing. God bless both of you guys.  That was awesome
I've watched everything that I can on your Channel from the lost mine to this and I think it's all impressive I've always enjoyed building things I have never had an opportunity but watching what you have done is amazing, my son has recently gotten into building motorcycles he has recently taken to and made one so I am very proud of him doing that I wish I could enter your contest but I am a disabled veteran and I rely on everything I get but that doesn't mean I won't stop watching your Channel. I think it's great starting with nothing and working up to what you have I wish everybody in this country had that kind of Drive thank you for your many things on your channels and I hope to watch more and more Adventures that you have.
The greatest failure in life is never trying ! All of you chased a dream to do something yall love and it shows with all the blessing you've received and most importantly gave its awesome to see people accomplish what they were put on earth to do  , cant wait to see what's next guys ......
Won’t it be cheaper to buy a properly with building an pay mortgage instead of leasing .
Just 2 or 3 thousand dollar cars, In my 37 years of driving I've never paid more than $500 for any vehicle I've owned. The $500 one was a 1972 Volks baja beetle. Most of my vehicles have actually been $25 cars or trucks including a 1964 Chevy 10 pickup that I drove for near 11 years.
So cool to see the journey.  Congratulations on all of the success.
NO WAY! I remember seeing the video where you filled the bathroom with diesel! That was ages ago. I remember some guy sticking the hose between his legs. I remember thinking, "those bad bad people" haha. I've changed my opinion now!
So are y'all going out of business or going a different direction
The American Dream.. so cool..
Crazy story we all enjoy your videos keep them coming
Car salesman & a bullshitter through & through.  Makes sense now.
Outstanding story, I think everybody should at least look back at their life, and whether they are successful at least everyone trying to make something out of their selves with all the push backs in everything that we encounter in life great show I wish more people would look back on their life life it is what it is and what you make of it stay strong God bless you and your company and God bless America.
Great vid. Will you ship to New Zealand if I  win?
Great story.. Thanks for sharing!
That guy had done amazing amazing job the Lord the Lord was with you and it still with you I seem to all your videos YouTube everything I appreciate your guy you guys making my life very awesome man made me decide suicide it's like it drags me into it make me feel like I'm somebody now and I'm glad you guys made it through yourself amen God bless you guys

First video I ever saw on YouTube of yall was of yall backing a truck up to a window and shoving flex pipe into the window and rolling coal on a guy. Classic freaking loved it I was hooked
Diesel brothers have come a long way. Starting from nothing but a strong work ethic and dream. Hope they never forget what and where they came from. Happy thanks giving to everyone.
I have followed you for years  ,but live in uk
I love you Guys
Standard clickbait. I've followed and liked these guys forever but I'm sick of the clickbait.
You guys sure do get it done keep the good work going
I remember the tv version of diesel brothers when it first came out. Look at you now
To the diesel Brothers Happy Thanksgiving to you and all your family
People forget how hard you had to work to be successful! Hell of a journey!  But next time title your video better. I thought you guys were folding and my heart sank!!!!   Looking forward to the new era!
Stay blessed!!!!
Great video.  I really enjoyed the history. I loved watching you guys on TV. Keep it up.
So inspirational--the Diesel Bruhs have done it again! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Inspirational
I had no clue you were so into Discos. I still have my 04 D2.
Not sure why he just doesn't open a casino.  In my opinion it's same thing as gambling.
Another great video!  Some glad you got back with Heavy D or your videos wouldnt be the same without him.
Really love listening to the story there's a lot of things I didn't realize but yall really put it into perspective some things I didn't realize. Really cool that y'all shared y'all's story and wish y'all the best. Keep up the great work
This was great, it cleared up a lot of questions, looking forward to the future adventures !!!!
Wow, great story. Worth the listen
This is not a sales pitch…. Than goes on a two minute sales pitch!!!! 😅😅😅
Love the video and the story. Thanks for sharing!
I can have legal representation now.

I love seeing the building process differently don't ever forget where you came from
Thank you 😊 I can't tell you how similar our family stories are.  You two always give me hope, that someday it will be my season. Cancer, son's addiction, lose of family members and lots of struggles along the way but I know God's got me and my family!
Why are you not doing diesels anymore
"Many people over estimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in a decade"
We need you guys, your such a positive influence world wide. 🥰
Amazing what you guys have achieved together
Do I get entered automatically from my first PB purchase?   still waiting for the next set of 4 stickers or was it 5?.
Almost feels like after you did the "Roman Atwood Podcast" got you on a remembering trail.  Interesting stuff.
Awesome story you guys have come a long way.
How awesome of you guys....very
Nice truck but it’s too high for me I would be able to get inside it because of my spine and Ubolts holding me together I drive a land cruiser which has a two inch lift and it’s eazy on me to get in and out of I cannot drive a car as it’s just too low to the ground as I would have to fall into the car and crawl out of it because of my spinal injury great videos of your channel
In any and ALL friendships of… two individuals… psychologically and emotionally there always has to be a LEADER and a FOLLOWER.
Fantastic insight into your growth and showing determination to succeed in a business that didn’t really have an end game .  Keep it up . Watching from 🇬🇧 uk
27:39 Spare key isn't there anymore?
Loyal fan from Africa ,Kenya you doing good job guys
You guys are going ELECTRIC! IT ALL MAKES SENSE! I'm totally calling it first. I heard it in the words Heavy D was saying and it just goes with the business model. You progressives you.
So many try to dismiss you guys as just a couple of extremist rednecks with money. But, in your channel, I see my Brothers from another Mother. No Bullshit guys, just trying to do the best you can in life and being gracious enough to share it with us. Hard work and perseverance with class and honesty. All wrapped up at the end with a generous spirit bringing back your good fortune to the community you live in. YouTube-tards (like me) are priveleged to know you through this channel. God Bless!
I started with y’all on Facebook, love to see what you have developed into!
You guys are good men,, thanks for all the great memories.
Incredible story here, honestly. As a vet, I would love to win that truck. That thing is a beauty
Love the behind the scenes story of how it all happened!
Wot an awesome journey, would love that truck but iam based in the united kingdom
Absolutely love watching you guys. Keep up the great work. Keep them coming. Love all you guys
SUCCESS in business is to suceed and progress from failure & mistakes along your journey with plenty of hard lessons learnt , but to fail in business is to repeat the hard lessons already learnt over & over again & again.   hmmm ok DAVE pretty sure 100k miles is a heap of millage on any motor doh (100% soft genuine one lady owner miles ) bawhahahahaha!!!!
I’m a 69 year old woman turning 70 this coming Spring I’ve been wanting a truck for so long if I can win this I’d be forever grateful ❤god bless you guys you’re doing amazing things for people and I love your shows ❤I have 4 adult children and they would not believe it if I pulled up to dinner with that beautiful machine ❤❤❤
What a success story! The ’Grandpa Truck’ fits me perfectly. Merch is bought, entries are in, good luck to me. Looking forward to your future endeavors.
Awesome Journey! Can you do more stuff with the helicopters? Maybe a journey video of your helicopters?
I'm great full that Dave and Dave have had there journeys and challenges tho some of them where very difficult in type but hope to see them join  after settlement
That is really awesome how you started your careers just coming from nothing to what you are nowadays I really enjoy watching your videos and your builds I'm kind of drooling over the truck you're driving now I love to have another third gen I have one years ago and sold it like an idiot but now I have two second chance 99s and I'm driving now but I love to have an extra one my collection .
Respect, the only word i can come up with , from the other side of the water"thing" // Sweden.
Very inspiring really like ur story..thank you guys TSgt Austin
There entire advertisement is based off toxic patriotism. I'll pass and don't care.
Miss you all on tv thank u
Good video you made your dream come true
Wore out or tired? No this was very inspiring and insightful. I myself am currently trying to figure all this stuff out ,on top of my health decline due to multiple sclerosis but can't stop won't stop. But it is very difficult. Thanks for the motivation 🤘🏼
I really enjoyed this video! You guys have come a long way in a very short time, and I'm proud of your whole team!
This video is NOT ABOUT  THE BUILD.... Tells you about the build for the entire video. But it is not about this build.
What a great story, I really enjoyed it.
We love your videos everyday me and my grandson just can't afford to enter to win the truck love your videos though
would love to have one of your truck but could never afford the diesel for it lol love watching you guys
I mean, who hasn't been to the breast enhancement doctor to get their head stappled?  🤣🤣
Kind of like the Heavy Checklist...love the content there too however, it is kind of sporadic. Great video of your rise to fame
Fun to Hear from both of you.  I'm also a Helo pilot and struggled through hard times with kids etc.  It's always magical to look back
Truly the American dream!
Awesome story I've been watching for years can't wait to see what's coming next.
Ive always enjoyed watching your videos with my son for years and we still watch them today. He has always wished that he could drive one of your trucks or meet you guys. Maybe one day this will come true for him! Thank you both so much for all of the excitement and most of all the special time I got to spend with my son enjoying your videos.
Congratulations on this fantastic video. Keep up the videos guys I have been watching you ever since I learned about you guys for about a year ago and it has been exciting every video thank you I hope that everything keeps going well for you guys and good luck in the future can't wait till your next video comes out keep up the good work thank you for Michigan

Truly amazing guys. Your story is inspirational and goes to show that if you have hard work and dedication you can comp anything you want in this world. That’s something to get that has gotten lost but you guys prove it that you can do it if you can think you can dream it you can do it. Thanks guys looking forward to the future and what else you guys are gonna bring us!!
Awesome thank u guys so much!!
Have you ever been fo badlands ranch Utah
Heavy D and the A team.  Its going to be big
Hey guys i'm italian and i don't know if you can get a truck shipped to italy... like it's hard and i understand... i don't really know how to use it so i just don't want it
So do you guys own the building now or still rent

We fuckin love you guys. God bless you and everyone in the world
I love you guys crazy BIG!!! What a wonderful testimonial!!!! I feel like you all are family!!!
Wait was the truck driving itself in the intro????? lmao
Kan niet wachten , wat de nieuwe content word.
3 years into my diesel car cause of you. Thanks for your caring nature.
Outstanding video of your history and development.
Your a hard worker and smart.  You deserve all the toys you have. I want your helicopter tho lol
Grinders and paint make you the welder you ain't!  LOL
Good going heavy d,I would love to win that truck but can’t enter as I’m in the uk but I’m going to keep watching your videos and the antics you boys get up too.
U Da Man!
Does anyone know what front bumper is on the US 24 Valve? I want one for my 24 valve.
Still waiting to smoke that joint with diesel Dave and become best friends good luck g guys and can't wait to see what happens next God bless and much love 💘
It’s a joke
Very inspirational.I relate to the story alot... I'm 24 a prety good forex trader. I bought my first funded trading account couple months ago. Unfortunately I lost it and now I have to get 100usd to buy another oneEven though theres no cash to buy another one.Never quiting should be the spirit... persistence very important
What are the odds that you guys might attempt a diesel hybrid truck? Like a tow vehicle that is more efficient but still has the power to haul a horse trailer or a big flatbed with a tractor.
This was a trip I remember sitting watching discovery channel growing up watching these guys build trucks. Cool to finally hear their whole story
hey, dont mean to be a critic, but the truck at 3:08 isnt the same truck, 3:08 is a crew cab love the videos keep up the hard work, im honestly upset to hear its the last give-away truck
I LOVE EVERYTHING YOU GUYS DO !!!! You 2 have some amazing hearts !!!!!!!!
The way you two were on the motorcycles being followed by the truck reminded me of the ending scene and easy Rider...oh no my misstack you're not on motorcycles are you But easy Rider is still a cool movie....
I would love that truck but being disabled I could get in it of afford it
Hi from Germany! You're great guys and many people her loves you, youre Show and youre trucks! But what hppend with the Diesel Brothers? I miss this Part of the Story.  What happend with the Guys from the Show and why the Show endet? Please can you tell us more about the last years?
Amazing story! Inspirational!
Awesome to hear the real story of where you came from and how it all evolved over the years. Showing us all the struggles and hardships you had to endure. Not sugar coating it and exposing all the flaws to the plans along the way. Keep up the awesome work and looking forward to what the future holds.
Love you guys. Hard work pays off.  Also.. Love the blk/camo zip hoodie.  What brand is it?  I'd like to buy one.
Ohhhhhhh the electric truck!
Is this give-away only US? I'm a european so would be sad to miss out on this piece of art.
I love the fact you guys remember where you came from and the struggles! It not easy to start and keep a business afloat! Congratulations guys!!
Thank you very much. I started out with your very first show and I've watched you grow.  Thank you for sharing this journey with us. I can't believe just how fair you have come. Look forward to seeing your next chapter and your videos.  Keep up the great work.  Congratulations to you and Heavy D.
Was looking for snap shots of all the guys we have watched over the years who are no longer there.
Good to always remember the humble beginnings to better appreciate the present of today… hope to win the truck .I’m sure it will be a blessing to someone
I can buy the merch, i can watch the videos i can like ans subscribe, but i cannot win the truck. Does that seems fair???
What did we learn? Grow a Beard and your life will launch to the next stage.
impressive
Bought a couple of tees one more time.  I've been in probably 75 giveaways, didn't even scratch the top.  Give it one last shot.
best motivation video ever, and also please show us the mega ram
I wanted to say Thank You and the Team of Families that stood by your side over your years of growing.  Your 💕 are truly so magical in this world.   God Bless Your Family's faith in doing the right thing in this lifetime will always be your greatest accomplishments. THANK YOU
Stories like this will help people see a future to keep looking forward and moving up this was so good to watch would not mind more stories of things y'all have done
dave has no idea what to do with his hands haha,hes just there he just keeps shrugging when dave dose and then pointing back at the truck tryign to sync up with him its hilarious
Thank you for showing us the progression of the business. I like it way better when you guys are being real and authentic. I have to admit the truck stealing video did pass me off a little, but videos this this bring me back. PS it was weird to see you guys without beards.
cant believe how far you have come  love you guys from Uganda love everything u do
Uggg sweatshirts are 70 shit I can’t afford that darn it
I am 62 and your story mirrors mine from the start. No I am not famous but I still build custom everything. Started with a few hundred, painted cars in a camouflage building to hide from City officials, then built my own building. Brings back many memories! 06 Duramax, 02 3500 Dodge 01 2500 Dodge 7 Trailers. Thank you!
Well that messed with my head seeing you two with out a beard 🤣
Why do I feel like I'm never gonna see you guys again?  This video sure has a lot of ups and downs.  Great story!
Loved the story. Mahalo for sharing. Love all the BUILDS y'all did.
Great history on how you got here.   Life is always  full of ups and downs, but I think success is not wealth, but being able to keep working through the hard time and reaching a goal no matter what you do for honest work in life.
I have wanted to see this story for years now, so proud of you guys!
All I heard was work work work. You earned it all boys
TO EVERYONE: Hope you and your families have a Safe, Fun, Blessed, & Wonderful THANKSGIVING! Enjoyed watching the progression of how and where things started and went through. 👍
SCREWED BY THESE GUYS AGAIN
You'll came a long and hard way,  but we all have to start somewhere. GREAT JOB !!!
Lower business partner and the best buddy Steve totally enjoy your guys's content you guys can do some really good videos I haven't seen a lot of the truck buildings I've seen a lot of the heavy d removals and recoveries and all that but we have a and a question in my question is this. If you want to put air bags on a f550 that's going to stand up to the weight of a service bed keep mind the 550 is also four wheel drive, I'm electrician by trade, and like you I do more than just my trade I can do plumbing I can do drywall I can do painting all that so I tend to have all the tools and everything that I need on the truck so it gets pretty full. I just don't want to put everybody's on that are going to fail I've done that on my Tacoma it didn't work out very well so I'm just curious on what you're recommendation would be. Nobody Steve we are going to have to go to the auction and buy another f-450 or another 550 with a service body on it to haul a fifth wheel that he wants to buy because he sold his house, I want to put the airbags on that as well if you recommend because that way I know that it's going to be airbags that are going to stand up to the weight of formulated toolbox and also a fifth wheel.
I'm excited to see what new changes are in the making.
Next time, let the Diesel Dave talk too and keep rolling cole 😂
Electric off the wall superfast trucks?!? That would be epic. Or electric race planes. Man, whatever it is it should be epic. Good on you guys. 🇬🇧🇺🇸
Much love squad much love keep up all the hard work.
Your early car dealing sounds like mine, but my ex would never allow me to start a lot.  She held me back and who knows what I could have done.  God is still good and I am blessed today with a really good wife and 2 great kids.
I dont know these 2 guys personally, but i got to say they really seem to be 2 genuine good people, i believed they are very blessed, good for them, it really makes me happy to see the goodness they have done and made peoples lives better, May God continue to bless you and keep your happiness bloomimg.
When I first seen anything, from you gentlemen, I wasn't too sure what you guys where even doing. I seen you guys go to a man's mountain that he had a hell of a cool collection of heavy duty old trucks and was building his home inside the mountain I think? I'm just now finding out the crew and Discovery Channel had a run??? I'm going to have to check that out for sure, being said I my first thoughts were you guys were a bunch of rich kids going around and having fun exploring and finding really interesting people to show how their lives were. Huh, Very Little, did I know, and funny I'm usually the first to say,  don't judge the book by the cover, shit I was wrong after a very short while of seeing a couple of your tube adventures I seen that the crew was so much more, Caring, Respectful,  Loving,  Real Human Beings That Give A F'K, Looking For missing people,  to plan wreckage and recovery for family that were stuck in a whirlpool of what to do, how to do can we do, to the crew leading the way saying we don't know if we can Help? BUT WE ARE GOING TO F'KN TRY OUR BEST WITH WHAT WE HAVE AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP!!!! In my opinion a lost human trait, emotion, a giving a damn, that unfortunately not many act with everyday, or every week or even 1 a year, people generally just don't care about fellow man next to them, especially after achieving the goals and level of success to be satisfying to them selves where I believe that's when greed and EGO kicks in and generally people stop caring about helping the person next to them or the one 4 states away! Sorry so much into this comment,  But Just Really Wanted To Say Thank You TO The Awesome people you gentlemen really are, I don't see fake or in it for the money (I do understand its well earned) but in it to LIVE AND HELP LIVE! THANKS,  KEEP FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT!
Is Dave moonlighting as Liver King?
It's a crying shame to see you and actually breaks this Navy Veterans heart. I'm not sure way it has to come to an end except that in every book a new chapter always begins. Your TV and YouTube shows were and still are real honest programming to watch. There will be a void in my viewing preference now and it will be difficult to fill. I'm going to be out your way working on new data center and I'm hoping I will have time to swing by your shop. I was an honor and a pleasure to follow your journey. Good luck and GOD SPEED
Exciting times for you all. All the best on what seems to be a brilliant move. Can't wait to see what you have in store for us all. Xo
So did you guys rent that space for a while or did you buy it off the guy that you met when you went there
.... with no barber ...... scary
can you tell him to cut his beard ? :) its horrifying
very interesting , insightful and watchable 👍👍👍👍
Excited to follow your new chapter soon. Bittersweet
Man I wish I could find my footing likrle this. You guy's got great hearts. God bless
You boys are awesome. You both worked hard for what you have and, you help people out. That’s what makes you guys awesome.
Dave gave me a truck and his driver stole it drivers name Terrance sparks
I'm proud of you guys, heck, I'm proud to say I am a huge fan and subscriber. Love the show, the channel and all the vids (even the stolen truck one!!!) Keep up the great work, I look forward to what's coming in the future.
Many businesses start on a "shoestring" budget, and the vision works itself out, every day, good or bad. The best part is the way you get swept up in it, and where the journey takes you. If after 10 or 15 years you can reflect on many positive memories, it's all worth it.
Just a thought....the clickbait titles or thumbnails are COMPLETELY unnecessary. When you get past that the content stands on its own and is so well produced. Why put those tactics ahead of what could be a squeaky clean reputation and nearly universal respect from your viewers?
Cool story Spark's, kind of curious as too know the role your wife played during the building of your business. Was she working at that time and helping financially? Were you two starting a family at the same time all this was happening? Was your wife involved in any part of the business? Just seems like you could have gone a little deeper into that area of your quest for becoming successful.  Keep the cool content coming! 🇺🇸😎👍
Keep up the good work, this is what we need.
Is that how you learned Spanish
Thank you for takin us on your journey and showing us what hard work and determination will do!! So nice of y'all to do this give away!! Blessings always from Oklahoma!!😊🙏❤
We love your way of doing Things.Roy
You deserve it every single thing💯👌🏽
Damn this makes me sad
Somebody time stamp the reason why they're closing up shop... don't care to hear about the "struggle" from a couple of millionaires who got a community loan from the Church of LDS.
Great video as always 👍 a mate and myself have just set up a company ( well 14 months ago ) we’ve just signed on the dotted line for a workshop. It’s a 9 year lease and a lot of money, so definitely had a few worries! Watching your video has made me think yes we can do this ! We’ll make it happen. Thanks for these videos they really do give people inspiration 👍
I WANT IT NOW!!! 🤣
I really enjoy a biography and I really enjoy your channel. I find myself watching more of your content than anything else. Also I just ordered the Tan Survival Backpack, I intend to use as a tool bag because my other bag was stolen from a job while I was working. I used the HeavyD20 code and saved 20% on my order. Can't wait to get it and start using it.
Be nice but it would never happen tho
Hi guys, absolutely amazing what you have been through from the start all the way to now, I applaud your hard work and cunning and the ache to be bigger and better. Thank you for sharing, much love. xx ❤
I love Dave….but real talk bro looked like a teenage version of Beavis when he was younger and didn’t have a beard 💀
Totally Awesome story. Truthfully. I have alot more respect for you Dave. You are a person I would like too work for and have a friendship with. Unfortunately I can't finacialy afford too move. Out of Virginia.
insane cool truck!!
shoppp tour
I don’t understand…. Is this the death of the channel? I missed something obviously? If so why and how???
Don’t ever shave your beards off .. you guys have become the pinnacle of handsome bearded fellas . Well done
This is truly amazing!! Seeing this and the progress you guys and your team has made and what you’ve gone through is such an inspiration, thank you!
I've always wondered about your guys struggles and its awesome you guys are speaking upon it! I love it I wish ya the best in life!
I’m so happy for you all and I can’t wait for what’s coming next! 🇺🇸
Are you guys going to keep the name diesel Brothers
Because America
God  bless you  guys
Thanks guys. I enjoyed the trip down memory lane and feel like I have a better idea of who you guys are and where you came from and how you achieved what you have. Cheers.
Good video
So.. no more give a ways huh? damn
The video you mentioned where you were trying to locate a friend's stolen truck was, IMHO one of the best made videos you've ever done!  Sure, it didn't "feel" great to know I'd been Punk'd when it was over, but that feeling only lasted 10 minutes or so and then I remembered how "caught up" in it you'd made me, and I became very impressed at how you'd taken me in, and I got over it.  Maybe I just have thick skin, but I really liked that video a lot!
I have a signed box from Diesel Dave from 2014. Just a little kid who loved diesel trucks and silly dudes
I love harbor freight
Wow you have been through alot
This is something you never hear about. So many businesses go through what you did and unfortunately they never recover.  Your history and evolution throughout the years shows that anything is possible if you stick to your dreams and never give up.  Thank you for sharing your humble beginnings till now.  Looking forward to your next chapter.  Keep on rollin. 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Thanks guys
WAIT.... wait what... So Dave wasnt always a ( Yeti ) ?
OK, maybe I'm old and a bit oblivious but I never new you guys had a TV show🤣. I have been watching your YouTube for years and never new. I came here from watching one of Matt's Off Road Recoverys videos, and your video was recommended. I love how/what you all do. Anyway thanks for the entertainment, and I can't wait to see where you go.
What are those front traction bars called that go to the front axle I have been looking for some for my 3d gen but I don’t know what there called can u please let me know
Well I tell ya that was a very cool story, and I think you were amazing with moving forward with your business, I think you guys will just get better and better  , I did in joy it, just to tell you I don't want anything from you guys just your prayers ok, I'm an older gentleman, and on disability, and home less, I would buy something from you but I just don't have the flow to do that, like I said I don't want anything, I just want to be able to see you moving forward with all of videos that are yet to come, good job, and keep making the memories, sincerely Wes troglia.
You guys have accomplished so much and you all should be proud of what you've done. How you guys handle yourselves now by helping others with what you've built is even more impressive. Thank you all for sharing this and for not giving up on your dreams. Really appreciate you guys.
Can’t wait for the new videos
Love the build wish I could have it lol ya'll have put about some amazing content hope it never stops love ya'll  my boys say hey.
Sounds like someone is taking over AWP
We're so happy you made it!!! (Your life (truck too)) You're more than amazing!
Make it sound like your channel is over. Clickbait is pretty popular with these guys.
You guys are straight up.
Que Istria tan interesande veo que noasido fasil llegar adonde estan orita pero orita son los mejores saludos bendisione ✌️🙏
So is Diesel Dave only an employee 🤔
Been around since even before the first big 3 around DieselSellerz and enjoyed the local events since the early times. It's been a great journey seeing all the growth and the projects.
What a fantastic opportunity sadly in Australia it is not able to go on our roads Stupid government
Love your videos man I have been watching you on tv since I was 6 I remember coming home and seeing my dad watching you on tv I think I’m more addicted to you then he is now 😂 but love to see the progress and see how far you can keep up the good work love y’all ❤
Awesome story bro!!👍🏼…Aloha🤙🏽
Hard work and Pure determination!! Great video guys!!
Helping people out is what you guys are GREAT at! I tried to send Dave a picture of what I wrote about my 84 year old mother, but sadly my cheap flip phone wouldn't do it. Thanks anyway Dave, and keep helping more people. There are thousands more, but you can't help everyone. Have a great Thanksgiving!✌
Hey Heavy D, what sweatshirt are you wearing in this video? I want one!! I checked the Diesel Power Gear website hoping it would be on there and I didn’t see it? Where can I get one?
Good story
Home sweet home, been in the shop twice
I'm so excited for you guys and proud of how far you guys have come absolutely speechless! 😊💯
Dude... Why are you ashamed of your rolling coal gear name? The first thing is, I doubt anybody that watches your content is offended by that name and second... YOU STILL BUILD AND DRIVE DIESEL TRUCKS!!!! Who gives a fuck about those triggered pussies, let em go sit in traffic somewhere.
This is awesome and you guys should be proud of yourselves but the click baity titles aren’t very wholesome
Great Story!
thank you guys for sharing that that was always a thought in my mind. what a journey only bigger and better mind-blowing things on the way keep grinding you guys keep grinding
Wonderful story about Wonderful Journey...
My rebuilt trans auto lol just took a shit after 1.5 years it's my only truck I would like to manual swap it do you have any pointers

A True American Success Story ! 🚛
Your trucks are very inspirational I took a little of this and a little of that and put it into my own build
Love these guys always positive and showing hard work does pay off respect and love
I would like to share something with you I have tried to live by for years, it goes like this, “ we are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” Written by Aristotle. I think you, gentlemen,  are  a living example of this. Thanks for the ride along gentlemen.
Will you ever update your hat selection?   Maybe with something with a little bit more color?   Love everything you do guys do and don't stop!!! ""BIG MIKE "" Out
Awesome story brother,
Great story! Thx for sharing…..I love how you never stop or give up! ❤
I had a friendship like that, then my friend met a woman and I never heard from him, after knowing him 7 years.
Inspiring story. Me and my bros have a custom shop here in so-cal and are learning the ropes as well. The unknown is what keeps you scared but motivated. I just pitched my bro the idea of swapping the new measly tundra 3.5 twin turbo engine in an mr2. Let see if we can make it happen soon.
You guys are awesome.  Loved the story 48:07
thats pritty kick ass glad you wer abel to make it work and finly git it all going  and i bout something hope it was a nuff to be entered for the truck i dont normaly enter stuff i think you guys are trustworthy and i love what  you do for people
That’s crazy I use to have a shop in the area behind behind TJ Chapman, we were restoring Vw Bugs and also had a T Shirt printing business there at the same time were were still there when it got foreclosed on and all of us small businesses got kicked out, we loved that place. I can’t believe it’s still empty.
Just bought me a hat pray i get a random spark of luck! Thank you for what you guys do I’ve been watching since I was 10-11 years old that’s 12-13 years.
You could have added drop-down steps on it so you can get in and out easier
WOW.....what a wonderful story....But God heard your heart and you always said what you wanted and it Great how everything just fell in place and now you both have a wonderful smile and happy as can be 😎
Wish I had this truck lop wpukd be a awsome truck to have at 16
OMG he's a used car salesman lol makes all the sense in the world now. I always said he's full of shlit and now I know why lol.
"successful" truck "give aways"
This gives me hope and strength to keep going and going. Thank You!!
This is what we the American people supposed to do! Keep it up hope you all keep up fighting for freedom. God bless
Nothing strong comes from playing it safe.
I still remember that black 3rd gen ugh loved that truck funny ass video😂
Great back story!!!   The next phase of merch will involve 10,000 Bro-Dozer hats
accidentally tried your road winter 2020? Failed spring 2022 forward, 14 yrs old daughter and i still do not have location #1
Really enjoy hearing about your start up journey with business! I’m in the first hurdles of mine with my commercial roofing company and it’s not easy but it will be worth it!
Very awesome journey!
The whole story is very inspirational.  You guys have put in lots of hard work from the start, and I am very happy for you that it has paid off.  Much respect!  I've been watching you guys since the beginning of when you started posting videos to sell trucks.
Great channel, always enjoy the adventures.
Hey guys... where's the trailer for the next big thing... LOL... good luck you guys deserve it... helluva of journey...👍
🕶 👀Wow loved the first one! ! Congrats on getting here,through the thick,very thick and thin !!  Wow .   Truck is amazing👍🇺🇸 Can't afford to buy anything rite now , but hey. I'll try later but would love that truck,a chance at it  at least.👍🇺🇸👀
Fuck yeah boyz
How awesome would it be to win my dream truck? I got some merch from the store for my son and nephew. Fingers crossed 😅 Awesome story BTW. We learned a lot.
I would LOVE tp win the truck but alas, I live in California where fuel cost are so bad, I would never get to drive it like it deserves
Great story!
Im on about step 6.5 right now, besides selling merch
You guys are so inspiring and make me feel like I can tackle any obstacle that comes!! Love to see you guys pull back the curtain and show everyone the struggles of the journey. Love all the content and I am along for the trip. Can’t wait to see what’s coming next!!!!
Dave how's the Blackhawk coming around is it almost done
So what do you mean by it's the end are you guys done doing YouTube
How long have you guys been married?
Beautiful truck great story!!!...
Too cool!
This is one of my favorite videos ever from you.
Wow what a cliff hanger 😂😂 truck looks great! Cool vid , pretty interesting to watch
Couple of bums!
Super cool history and trippy to see you guys clean shaven
i want to give you like every two minutes
Gentlemen, I've been watch you for about 3 years and enjoy it. I am a retired firemen, so with this SAFETY question. Why haven't you purchased radios with head sets. You work around dangerous settings. Communications is key to SAFETY. I hate to see anybody get hurt. Also, for you Dave, there is a cordless mike that you can wear.  Just a thought.  Keep up the good work.
Okay no kappa that’s Dave and Dave picture was a little….ahh Nevermind
Absolutely love the old pictures! You both are awesome guys and I wish you a long life of prospering.💯🙌✌️
What did bud do this time?
Love the video…..the truck not so much….but you are one of my favorite YouTubers……can’t wait to see where the future takes you
I have nothing but Respect for this video. It gives you the feeling of triumph and Familia.
Nice to hear how something got from point A to B.
Garden hose shower rules. The four key areas arm pits ,  asshole, crotch and teeth.
Too many commercials.  Every 5 minutes is a little much.
This is a real testimony that good friends can take you farther than a dollar bill.
Quite the story of how you guys have built up a very successful business. Lots of moves with a lot of hard work and finagling. The fact that Discovery Channel thought enough of what you do to produce a show is a success story in itself. Congratulations guys and continued success. I enjoy your shows.👍👍🇨🇦
Well guys, I will say that you all are just amazing.  And have followed you journey from the time I found you on TV. You have built some of the most amazing trucks I have ever seen. And I hope you can keep going. And I can't wait to see what's next. Good luck and keep fighting those who want to do you harm.
Woo Hoo!!!!!  Freedom bus at 17:20.
I know it’s not huge me that thinks old HavyD looks like wolverine
I won't bother to enter since, I'm wheelchair bound and the truck won't work for me. My 412 lbs powerchair needs a ramp or a lift in order to load up. I don't have a vehicle and it would very liberating to have a vehicle to get around in. I would be able to go to the VA hospital and see my kids, maybe go hunting and fishing again. It's just not the type of vehicle that I need to have. What an awesome truck for just about anything I mentioned including 4wheeling. Best of luck to you and the crew. I really love all of you. You're all amazing humans.
Golly! Now that is quite the epic journey, and it seems there's more to come. Major kudos to your wife for putting up with all this. You guys are really something special!
That is quite a long road to success! Thanks for sharing your story!
what got you  in to flying
Onward and upward !! Can only imagine what, how, and where you will take, not only yourselves but hopefully us along as well. Peace, love, and diesel on guys !!
Db's man yall are awesome i really enjoy the shows and most of all how yall give back to the ppl.
will get to the hanger
U guys should do a monster truck build like Whistlendesil
The love! Solid works.  That's my language
Hi, I'm 16 and have been watching you guys since you have been on TV. The road you guys have been is just insane. I have always wanted to meet you guys in person. Just such great people.
The real question is how they built those beards
We love your channel and look forward to each new program.  We also have a 2005 Dodge 350 cummins diesel  dually, 6 speed manual with Jake Brake. 129,000 miles.
Awesome story. No pain no gain. Keep it up.
I really love „Media offline“ 🤔😝😆 Just kidding 😉 It was and still is a pleasure to watch a video of yours, I can’t describe how much joy and fun I have watching your videos. And if you ever need a cameraman and video editor with over 18 years of experience, let me know cause I‘ll pack my family in a plane and move to Salt Lake in a heartbeat (I‘m from Germany, that’s why 😉) Besides that, I‘m very excited to see the next evolution, but one thing I know for sure: It will be a banger 🙏 Kind regards from Germany 🇩🇪, Philipp 👋
As we learn. A little hard work and some good friends and you can get through it. Keep those friends good friends close
That truth.  AMEN  keep it simple..
y
So proud of you guys! A real American dream come true.
By far the best video ever, what a beautiful story and hard work rewarding. May God Bless you all.!!  We can’t wait the new era!!
Congratulations on your success. I don't know who you are nor have I ever seen you on TV before. I'm glad you two think your famous. Do you guys do a lot of drugs? Do you know what "grandiose" means? I think that's what's going on here. Anyways, I hope the rest of the population will catch up.
Thank you for sharing your journeys through your many accomplishments you have done . The ups and downs that you all went through and you kept  your beliefs in God as well. To me that was awesome, you didn't push it but you kept in the forefront of this is who we are. I wish you all the very best in your journeys, with God by your side there nothing you can't do. God Bless  Roderick Byrne USMC  Butte Mt   Ps. Have fun
What an awesome journey. I love the truck. The O.U.R. Truck is still out on the road kicking ass. The truck is awesome. Every time I drive it someone offers to buy it. My answer is always “ I’ll never sell it “. Thanks for all the great shows, I can’t wait to see what’s next.
Bought another power box. Let’s go I wanna be able to have a dream truck! Love y’all
I’ll never get an electric car cuz of these bad asses .driving an evo turns you into a chick w dik or some man w a clam who sits when he peees
So what about your cattle ranches and land ownership?
Freedom just does not have the same definition as it use to
From humble beginning to owning you own Blackhawk, and who know what else is coming!?  Very inspiring, and I look forward to watching the next chapter of your story.
You and the team are amazing! You all do great things for people. Loved the video of where it all began. Shows us little guys that we can do it as well with almost nothing.
Thats  the nicest truck I've  seen
This guys clearly have big ego and constantly need attention. Having lots $$$ Beards, trucks n EQ don’t make ya special
💯💯💯
What a great story. A success story. Good tough times and learning and driving force to succeed. Proud of you guys.  And what your future holds.. 🇺🇸🤠👍🏆
Very cool.  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
the beginning of the video was bad a$$ with the truck right behind you guys... i freaking loved it. you guys are awesome
Your example  for a topless bus is from my home city Victoria BC.
Probably one of my fav vlogs you have made because I have so much respect for people that have made it show how they have become and where they come from but also show the people it does take hard work for even the people that worked for it but it’s also a journey to get there and also shows how no one will do it for you no one cares u til you get there then all of a sudden people want sort part of your life but before this they would give to sh$ts idk very positive upload but shows why people have to worrie about there selfs and family
My best friend and his dad worked at location #8 back when it was Contour Composits and played in the back lot with our dirt bikes and atv's, awesome times.
Humble asf and this is y I love y’all guys u make everybody feel like family
Great work guys, When do you guys start shipping to spain. Always willing to buy but cant buy shit!
Hard work pay off. You are a Good business man.
Always a pleasure to watch you guys!!! Respect……
Love this, amazing video. You have   placeholder at 3150 fyi. Those old pictures, amazing.
Enjoyed this video sharing your history . Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family.
Great video, I'm gonna be honest though, after the powerbox disaster, there's noway I can throw another penny towards you guys...
Do you know what guys God has let you do what you are doing because of how awesome you guys are going out helping people like you do
God bless you guys I love your show and I love diesel trucks
YAH.  KNOW....YOU NEVER. CHANGED........YOU. DONT. GIVE.  UP......STEEL. DETERMINATION...
Love watching you guys... but can I make one suggestion. When you are describing something in this case the truck... show the truck!!  We already know what Dave looks like. Please!!
As a business owner,  your story gives me hope.  It also affirms that shutting down a business that's working to try at another that might work better isn't crazy.  Thank you!
This is AWESOME💯👍 Thank you for sharing your stories & your friendship 🤗
I want to go buy something and fix it up now.
Really enjoyed your insight into how it all started. Coming from virtually nothing and all the trials and tribulations to were you are now, I take my hat off to you and diesel Dave and the rest of the guys you have today. So glad it all worked out for you Dave, you never gave up and I'm so glad that you started with YouTube because i love everything you and the guys do from the rescues to more sensitive stuff like looking for missing people. Thanks Dave and cant wait for your next adventure 👍
You guys are the best
you guys are brothers???
Why have you not been on tv in a long time?
What’s the brand of the jacket you are wearing?!
Hey from Australia,,,,,great video Heavy D and Diesel,,,,you certainly have come a long way and I really enjoyed watching your journey....you were saying that you were having problems putting 3XL...4XL etc hoodies etc into UPS flat rate boxes and satchels...may I make a suggestion that you vacuum seal them first...those vacuum sealers are amazing....just a suggestion though....keep up the good work :)
waw nice awesome story, i like the truck is insane cool, i always want those truck,  Hi greetings from Aruba🌴🇦🇼🖐️🖐️
I love your story and that you've beaten the odds and succeeded in doing what you love. Keep up the good work. Incidentally, Do you guys do "how to" videos for the backyard mechanic? I'd trust your stuff long before a lot of other YouTube videos  I've seen.
Love the truck!
A true successful journey in determination  and forward looking dream . Great job now and forever...
This was a great awesome video
wow guys
Amazing story ! Keep doing amazing things! You guys are the best!
True entertainment, just unfortunate that thousand's of us can't be in it to win it if we're outside of the US is have had a go if you'd send the truck to the UK 🤣👍
So you said this is the last truck to be given away, and you said you’ll continue to give away trucks.  So something is changing.  My guess is you’re going to start shaving regularly.  Can’t wait to see what you’re up to now.
Are all the places in Utah.    Love the background scenery.   Awesome
I grew up a Mormon who was sexually assaulted by a mormon missionary. I'll never go back.
SCAM ALERT,  PICTURE OF DAVE WITH PHONE NUMBERS NEXT TO IT IS A "SCAMMER"
I love watching your video's.  My son and his friend have a shop, starting off with nothing, but the tools and there will and love for gas grease wheels. They have no money, can barely pay for the shop, I think can relate   This is what it's about.
Can’t wait to see what coming   Watching from Australia you guys are awesome
The AMERICAN dream. Love what you do. Best wishes. Bob
Well done gents…
I loved the stolen truck video… Did you ever catch the SOB’s?
I can hardly wait to see what's next. I've been a fan for years but I just could not bring myself to subscribe to Discovery...especially now with all the gay pride nonsense. Whatever is next, please keep it on an outlet that is more concerned with content and not being "woke". Thanks and God bless you all!
What???? Where you guys gay, a couple?????
Today is the oldest you have ever been,today is also the youngest you will ever be,never stop on your dreams,read that again..
Pre EPA engine killing BS!!! Yessssssss
What a interesting story of your struggle on how you both went on your journey brilliant video and adventure you guys are doing started following you on television at first now following on YouTube now keep them coming guys stay safe from Halifax England 🇬🇧
I always admire everything you guys do.  I am a diesel, boat, utv, jeep, etc guy also.  close to river
Hell of a long bumpy road, guys. But you jacked yourselves up, put your big-boy tires on, geared down, and owned that road. So, way to go guys and keep on trucking!
💯💯💯🔥🔥💯💯💯
Truly inspirational Dave! As a local in your area starting his own businesses and going into the unknown, this inspires me so much!
you are AWESUM congrats and like I always say PRESS ON ! ! !
Dave 2 needs to cut off that beard.
great video...now WHERE'S THE BLACKHAWK??????
Saludos de Amarillo Tejas! Siempre chambiando! 🤙🏾
Is this because of adventures with a purpose pedophile scandal?
I may not have space for a cool Truck a home But i like it 👍👍
Thanks for sharing your journey. It is the American dream. Enjoy your content and down to earth attitude the entire team shares.
Little more Diesel Dave please! =)
Beautiful 3rd gen 🫶🏻
Jailed Donald trump is a bop
Great story! Love it! 👏👏👏
Yo Guys rock much respect 💪
I wish my health was good enough to work hard and do stuff like that:(
I can not enter always errors --sign in after login  look at the  pics to prove it is you and --NOTHING..but, anyway I love your travels and rescues.
Absolutely loved the video. I didn't find you all until shortly after you came to YouTube in the last couple years. Definitely great to know the backstory of stuff.  And props for not making this one the greatest click, bait, and switch I've ever seen. Although that was a good video too as far as the acting and filming goes.
HeavyD, another youtube team up you should look at is RichRebuilds ... They do fun conversions like tesla to gas engine or gas car to EV. Diesel truck conversions too. He also one of the few who has a Sherpa ATV ... craziest amphibious vehicle I have ever seen.
Much Love to you All.
Very cool video!
Ain’t nothing over until it’s over.
That truck is NICE! It looks absolutely perfect & the flag flying in the back is the cherry on top! Super cool dude. (Love the throwback pics of you guys, those are really neat to see.) Wishing you all the very best and thank you for giving us some great feel-good content to enjoy! Can't wait to see what you guys unleash in 2023. Much love from California👍🏻
Screw the seatbelt haters!
Do you know why they call it black Friday?
A big dream of mine .. someday I'm driving across country to meet you guys I've been a mechanic old new fabrication I was born into it and you guys are a great insperation
God bless you guys everyday. Son los mejores.
Y'all are a very Handsome Men.
What can happen when you refuse to take NO for an answer!!!! 👍👍👍👍👍
what an awesome story, well told, and been a fan for quite some time.  I would like you to do a video on your journey in aviation, I think that would be cool to see how you got into it, and the aircraft you have purchased/still have.
Dang I can't believe how long I have been watching you guys 😳
14:12. That's when I started watching Dave that was Hilarious! 😂😂
I  have struggled to get the truck I never received it was 3 to 4 hours away and driver wanted more money I couldn't pay so he is taking truck back a free truck and no one gives a shit they just f___ed me haven't heard from Dave in months  thanks guys
Well done 2 u and your team loved watching u on sky channel hope u make a come back allan in England 🇬🇧
Dude you have some of the best merch on your site! I got myself a sticker for my shitbox Subaru and a camo lanyard from you guys as a promo! Thanks again ❤
Hard work pays off 💪 🙌 🙏
Some people in life make it , you are one of those people.
From acorns, 👏👏
❤
Said it before and I'll say it again you guys are cool dudes.
Super cool video, except it’s going to bug the shit outta me that you held out on the “what’s next”
I discovered you from watching Matt's Offroad Recovery.   I have owned diesel-powered trucks for as long as I know. I presently own 2018 Ram 2500 which is Rhino-ed top to bottom. I am a Ham Radio operator, do I am getting it wired up for it. I live in the South Texas Brush Country, do I have to have a truck that can deal with driving thru Brush filled pastures eith out getting Texas Pinstriped (gouges in paint from brush).
It’s more than truck bro your respect and love for human life and what’s right is a testimony by it’s self.
👍👍👍👍🗣️🙏🙏🙏🙏👌💯
YEAHHHH HEAVY DDS!!
Matt's off road needs a flat bed for a truck he has and I told him to check with you because I seen what yaw can do for a bed
Clems #1....
I have a true admiration for what you have done and become, all those people yo have helped and crazy projects. I do feel grateful to follow you and what you have said about the fellow Mexican guys working there and how you helped that family giving them a transformed new truck speaks magnificent things about you. Keep trucking
My dad bought a 1991 5.9 l coming diesel 12 valve he said it was going to be the last truck he ever bought we lost my dad 4 years ago next month but we still have the 1991 5.9 l coming diesel 12 valve I miss my dad
It's a pity that the era is over..all good things must come to an end
See America !! This is what our country was blessed with. People who care and willing to help others. This is why HeavyDSparks guys out shines everyone. They take pride and care of others. God Bless You And Your Crew !!!!
Thanks for the walk through History.
Wow I remember them days where you pulled a prank and unhooked the cab bed Cause in damage to that tow truck if I remember correctly that wasn't even your tow truck And then smoking out the building with coal from a truck
Very Cool, like watching my Family evolve and that truck looks really stout.
Love story guys a credit to you all. I still run a 98 Land Rover discovery I still own the first Land Rover I bought in 1985 a 1970 S2A & my wife and I named our first son TJ back in 1986 keep doing what you are doing good luck in the future 🇬🇧👍🇺🇸
Powerful story I love it. Sounds like u are going electric

Thank you for sharing you experiences with us.
Awesome video guys.
What a wonderful journey—-and a Fantastic episode!!! ❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗🤗
32 mins mark ... i know that screen all too well lol
Damn Shipping cost are the same as the T-Shirt to the UK lol, awesome vid though 👍
AWESOME! I know how hard it can be sometimes Iv been at it for 25 years you’re blessed with having a great crew. It’s hard to find any one who wants to work. You guys deserve a big pat on the back!!
My buddy and business partner Stu was the guy that turned me onto you guys videos 10 years ago. We started a small shop buying auction cars and flipping them . unfortunately we lost him last January to the big C at 41 years old. It's been a real struggle for me the last year finding the motivation and money to keep doing this on my own . Watching you dudes is an inspiration to keep chasing the dream me and Stu started . Thanks dudes .
Heavy D out of curiosity did ypu guys ever finish that diesel powered bronco build you guys started on the show but then put it in that sea container?
I used to do the same job as Dave here in Florida the worst part about the job was getting chased by dogs
I can hardly wait for PTII and buildings 10-18!
awesome story ,, be safe friends
There’s a guys acting like heavy D in the comments that’s not the real guy
Sorry I can't afford to buy anything right now.
I’m sure credit is due.... Behind every great man.. there is a Magnificent woman!! Either inspection, perspiration or mental sanity.... your familys deserve the “you dun Good” Awards as well.
Love your pursuit of happiness glad to support a local buisiness born and raised in Utah hope to win the truck and keep it here in Utah
I love the storys but r u guys still going to make u tube still and why no more give aways r u guys okay
Clearly, you’ve never done any welding but you’re good at tacking things that something
You bought the Effer
What a great story! Great video.
Up until this point it never occurred to me that Dave was a real person, now seeing him without his beard I am weirdly surprised he is
Awesome video!  I wish y'all the best!  Beautiful truck built by you and your awesome crew.  Keep being you...
Be awesome to see where the old 12v is and if you guys could do some upgrades on it
Awesome hearing more about Diesel Brothers business journey.  You guys have worked so hard and taken so many risks to get where you are today.
You guys are real and totally amazing!! Thank you!
Very interesting!  Thanks for sharing!
You definitely make me reassess my life goals. Ten years. You can do things. Big time in America, but not if your wife won't go along.
So much of this sounds so similar to my career,  beer bug made me semi-retire. Wish I could build some transmissions for you. Good luck 👍
fab life to date story Love the energy MABROOK  Bravo for following your dreams LIVE  LOVE  LIFE is precious
Building #8 rocks! Oh man, I looooved hearing this story, thank you for sharing. I applaud your determination, this should inspire a lot of people. You guys are so awesome!
Needs to sink the company to be able to pull a hulk hogan 400M lawsuit from the people that magnified his involvement in Nikola 😂
You guys are inspirational, love your videos, I'm an ex South African living in the UK. Was raised on a big farm in South Africa, so miss the big open spaces, dirt bikes and the like, now a single father with 2 kids and one of your biggest fans in the UK. Keep up the great work.
Very weird. But a sht ton of effort. Given your age in life you have lived more than most. Sums up America. We can't even fix a 1953 Plymouth Cranbrook over here.   I sum not sure about the helicopter stuff. Especially a Blackhawk.   The engines are probably 2 million each by now. Way to much talking though. Sorry but damn, reminds me of Obama speeches endless. America is opportunity.   Air Assault.
Great video as always guys. 👍👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
This is a story of how hard hard work pays off. Have big dreams, focus on your Customers, and the money will look after itself. Dave and Dave are examples of how friendship and relationships are what make businesses successful.
What a crazy journey, I've been watching since the TV show. I'm excited for the new era though!
We need a rebuild of an upgraded ‘El Forker’  for use at the current shop!!
What flag poles did you guys use
I love all your videos
Very cool way through "the life and times" of Sparks! I'm sure it seems like a very long journey, but on the calendar I was pretty much just retiring and it hasn't been all that long. But you guys have put together something very cool right here in Utah. Lovin' it
I been watching you guys since your second show you are great
Really enjoyed this.  We have a similar business drive and this reminded me a lot of myself, just in a different industry.  Cool story!
Where is that camo jacket from?
would ya send it to Perth western Australia. Australia. Diesel Dave??
I’ve not really watched many of your videos before but I’ve seen you on Tim gentry /Cletus and always wondered what’s your story so for me was a fantastic story and starting to enjoy your videos , great work lads
You guys are awesome
I love the story! And how you never gave up! You had so many many road blocks. But you never gave up! Much love and respect to you and Dave and a awesome crew. But hay 19:04 in your video what is that in the air?
Beautiful
Excelente episodio. Gracias por compartir! te vemos desde Puebla Mexico!
Great video , you guys really are hard working and truly inspirational keep up the good work
It's interesting hearing you talk about how it all started
I watched half of this video through my break I will continue this tonight but so far so good it is a very inspiring story and I hope to see more of the diesel brothers
The best method I've found when using a hose as a shower is wash down from your head as far as possible. Wash up from your feet as far as possible. Then wash possible last.
How the hell did that truck follow y’all
Proud of you man you have come a long way keep going!
My heart nearly stopped when I read the title. I couldn't believe you were stopping making videos. You are my favorite channel. I can't begin to describe my relief to find out this was your history leading up to where you guys are today. Thank you. Inspiring video. Keep up the great work and your selfless devotion to humanity. We need more people like you setting the bar for all of us to aspire to. Thank you.
Congratulations guys I'm a Rancher same thing started from nothing with nothing and is so wonderful to work hard save your money and make things work God bless you boys
With the team of this video I think you should build a truck called remembrance!!
Dam, idk y’all had came so far…respect.
I neeeeeed a truck like that!  I have a Jeep I tow my RZR around with....need a truck!
I wish I could buy something to be entered but just to broke😢
how much hate you got for the first clickbaity thumbnail that you had to change it to this :D :D :D
Your journey was and is amazing! Hard work paid off
Great video as always, I have always loved the show and you guys. I look forward to whatever the future brings.
My son would die if I showed up in this!!!!
I guess it's call "The All American Dream" for All of you.
Fired up to see what’s to come! 🔥🤘
i never watched or heard of this show,but I am impressed with your ability to overcome adversity and stick with it. congratulations on your continued success and yes i watched the whole video lol
You have the best stuff
Love your videos, and so cool to hear your story, so once I buy my merch and get entered to win this truck, and by some miracle I do win it, I am only 5'3" tall can I get you to install some side steps/nerf bars on this truck so I can get into it without needing a ladder? 🙂 As a USAF veteran one of the main reasons I love your channel is because of how much you love America and your support for our military and veterans, and I cannot wait for more Blackhawk videos! Be so cool to get to fly in that thing!
This has to be  the best vidio ever  you out.... i have follow from the start  but we never realy seen the hard times and thing Ya"ll went throw to get here where you are now... My Hats off to all of you for sticking with it and the person you turn out to be Because of your struggles thank you
I always look at your videos and wonder how big your business really is. You do so much and it started off so single. Most newcomers just think you're a heavy duty tow truck company. LOL this enterprise is much more than that and it's amazing to watch and learn about.
Thanks guys love it. what a journey I guess  it had been said that if you don't give up and work hard it will come. Great job  I have been watching from the start. Keep them coming.
You guys are awesome!!!
LOL. It should be "U.S. 12-valve", not "U.S. 12 valve".
I Have watched you from the beginning of your video experience, I really appreciate you sharing your journey with us as how you were able to overcome and persevere with what was going on at the time within what you were trying to do with your life and the way you wanted it to go. It just shows you with a little hard work, and determination that you can overcome any obstacle that may come your way and it’s really been a pleasure to see how you have grown into what you are now. I always say that life is like a roller coaster ride and you just have to go with the flow. You take care of yourself now and I do have a question if you can help me find a plow for 2003 Toyota tacoma I’d really appreciate it but in between time you guys take care and be safe🤠
Nice work
Wow, awesome story, and thank you for sharing it!  I really admire the determination and just plain hard work.  Congratulations on how far you’ve come, and best of luck on new endeavors.  I’m sure you’ll be killin it, and I’ll be watching it.
este vídeo es Muy interesante me encanta hermosa camioneta y es todo un encantó de Los hermanos heavidispar me encanta 😃👍🙄
That picture of them on the water when they were younger reminds me of how much I loved heavy D’s character in tokyo drift lol
Love love love all of what all of you guys do and what all your hard work got to achieved with zero handouts!!!!!
Can’t try win the truck but wondering where did heavy d get his jacket from I like it
Oh the memories, Takes me back to the days I started out learning as many different things as possible so I didn't have to rely on anyone else to get whatever job done. 👍✅
Seen you guys in Glamis Halloween you guys are awesome wish you the best
I got in to diesel trucks because of the diesel brother's I have two Ford diesel trucks and I've been wanting to do more with just had the money but by watching them anything is possible
Never stop dreaming!!!
Brilliant video
I loved seeing how far you guys have come. I hope you never move locations, because it is a highlight for my 2 boys to drive by your shop and see all the cool trucks out front.
Loved you from day 1, can English fans enter the competition?
Absolutely LOVE this story, esp the moral. Without your dreams, ambition, sacrifice, hard work & good friends who’d sleep in a hammock, shower with a garden hose, you wouldn’t be where you are. Success didn’t fall in your lap, you failed, got up & kept going. You imagined it & made it so.
Do u still have the Mexican and pacho from season 1 ? In ur new shop
What about ol' Red Beard??
NIIICE TRUCK!   Hugs from Idaho!
I've watched your videos for years and until now never knew your story.  Your tenacity, persistence, and motivation is a true example of what makes America Great.  Thank you so much for the 'back story.'  It gives a whole new perspective to what, why, and how you and your crew do.  AWESOME!!
Congratulations on ur journey from start to where u are now.8times is a lot to take in big up bro
Congratulations Lads you have pulled it off with the hi and lows never the less you all are doing what you enjoy and you lot make some great entertainment for the rest of us … thank’s DDD’s for all of it bloody fantastic show and I enjoy everything about it 🇺🇸💪💯
Love that both building one and two got bought out and built Something else
Would love to enter, but your merch is too small.😂
love the show, the cast, content, what you do you for your neighbors and in extension to the world because I believe you are an international sensation!
Great video! Inspirational for a failed business owner.
My husband is restoring a 1962 CJ 3B Willis.  He's a metal welder fabricator.  That's was  what he did in the navy. Not his first restoration.  I don't think there is anything my hubby can not do lol.
i dont think you,ll be satisfided untill your the first privater on the moon. as allways brill vid, have a good one.😀
Boy HeavyD can talk. He could sell anything! Well done to you all.
Click bait Title, I get that its Youtube so no hate but for any worried subscribers they are just changing vehicle give-aways  Also the history video was good.
I’d love to see a video of the point of view from your guys. The best memories to the times they maybe thought wtf.. I’ve always thought working for you would be a dream come true. Seeing and hearing it from those that get to would be a close glimpse to the what if it was me.
You guys have 100x more subscribers than all the politicians. Which makes me wonder why politicians get so much face time on corporate media.
I really enjoyed this video! So intetesting to hear the backstory behind everything, and so well told. Best of luck in your future adventures, I'll be sure to follow you guys here 😊
Well… PRAISE GOD - You guys didn’t tell us something messed up. 😅😂
I want to drive it!!!
😔😔😔 it's over series
I’m a musician … I’m to frikin poor to buy anything ….  To enter for a truck I can’t afford to feed .. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️    Love what I do , guess I’ll live the rich life vicariously thru y’all. 🤠🎸🎶🇺🇸💪
Very rare to have friends in the beginning then starting a partnership in business. It is a very rare find to see two friends accomplish that without destroying your families and friendship!! you two are the real deals.
Aww! look at the young bucks with no beards! just wanna pinch those cheeks!
Dude I miss watching you guys so much! I got rid of cable 4 years ago because it's insanely expensive, and when I did I lost you guys and it sucks so bad because I love your show so much it is amazing. But atleast I can check out what your doing on here, so keep doing what your doing and God be with you all.
Love this origin story. As a Small Business Owner of an Electrical Contracting company (Nov 2020 in middle of Covid is when I started) and two years in , I can appreciate the struggles and the pursuit of the dream. Your story inspires me in many ways. I discovered you all a couple years back and been a fan for a while.
Man. I remember location #4! After goin with you and Rich down to baja 1000 I bought some dana 6 axles that you had NO CLUE what was inside em. You sole em to me for $1,200 and a few months later I cracked em open and they were LOADED! Yukon shafts and ARB lockers that you never plumbed. Felt bad that I got em so cheap, but man they were sweet axles. That was back when you were doin diesel swaps in the Land Rovers. Fun times!!
Did anyone else get a weird multilingual screen at the 31:55 mark?
Loved this video  so inspirational ❤
Such a awesome storey and nice to see where it all started from, can’t wait to see the future as it can only get better 😎
What a good video. Thanks guys. True story!!!
So great to see your evolution of hard graft and self belief…
Trip down memory lane
Why not shipping to Norway ?
So you’re the mfs that bought everyone’s trucks out of their back yards in utah
I like the truck until I heard 100,000 miles is low mileage. I guess
Awesome show very interesting to hear your beginning gotta watch it again👍👨🏻‍🦳👍
Brings to mind Elon Musk commenting, "...it wasn't easy."
Great vid never watched you on discovery but watched you evolve on YouTube you listen you have made mistakes but you listen then change what’s not working good to learn from this vid you are humble & normal like the rest of us….  Top job 👍 from 🇬🇧 uk.
Great to see gentlemen!   I remember first seeing you on the Discovery Channel when I was 16 and returning home on leave from basic training. Many lifetimes ago and alot has happened since then. So happy to still be on the journey with you! Miraculously enough, I'm now a CrossFit Owner and have seen that next to alot of your old units, there are now CrossFit Gyms, especially in Rockwood!   Will continue to share the love and keep tuning in! Excited for what the future holds for you both! Might try and get across from London,UK!
I wanna work for you BAD! I got tons of fabrication skills and need a new start on a career.....Love you guys BIG
Electric trucks are coming
WAIT!!!!!! WHAT?!?!?!?! Why the last truck give away?? Noooooooo!!! Did I miss the explanation of this in the video?? I'll go buy something to enter to win but if I don't win, can my 18 year-old son and I come hang out with you guys, shadow y'all to learn some mechanics and camera work? My kiddo is quite the videographer/photographer. That's a fair request if I don't win the truck! LOL We don't live far, easy drive from SW CO.
That truck is awesome.
What happened to your give aways once every like 250k subs on the you tube Chanel?
Hey HeavyDSparks we had a sad day my dad was in a pretty serious wreck and the truck was our family truck we all love this truck a 2005 dodge Ram 2500 turbo diesel with only 112,000 miles and the insurance company said it was totaled but I don’t think so and we really need it for the family wood shop for crafts. Maybe you could help bro we really need help so one can afford to fix it right
This was great to hear all about your beginnings!  You really worked hard to get were you are today!  I love watching you!  Wish you all good things in the up coming year!!
Awesome video learning how you guys started!!
Clickbait Title lmao
It’s been an fun ride. We are all hoping the next incarnation of you all is just as fun and incredible. Thank you for sharing this video and taking us on this tour.
i love how God has used u guys as ur business grows, and how u still help out and havnt forgotten the little guys,   my God bless u and urs .   u truly have so much to b Thankful for this Thanksgiving,  u r an inspiration to ALL of US, keep it up, TRUE AMERICANS!!
So they are doing any more truck giveaways after this? Why not?
Thank Yall for all that you do for the community and for the truck builds that represent our great Military..!! 👍 🇺🇸
I’ve been following y’all since the beginning. Literally remember almost every location or memory that’s been posted over the years.
Wow, this is an incredible story, thanks for sharing.
Why is the video titled “it’s over end of an era for us” with a video that goes over the past. I’m confused. Is this just click bait?
Hey heavy D, I liked the stolen truck video, fuck em. This one was a much better promo though.
Congratulations on evolving through the tough struggles that brought you where you are today. I look forward to the progression of the next chapter in the book of your challenges, and successes.
Love this channel. Got some co workers hooked on it too. Love how open and how selfless you guys are.
I wish I could get a sweatshirt but being on disability I can't afford it at $65
I enjoy your content and I am not interested in the giveaways.  I enjoy you giving back to the community.  Keep it up.
LOVE Seeing Our Great Countries Beautiful Flag Flying In The Back Of Your Truck.
Very respectable nice video
Dave and Dave, Don't EVER shave....  that is all.
Awesome story,glad you never gave up. It definitely goes to show hard work pays off.
Did the mechanics stay with you throughout the whole journey?
Gona miss you guys
I love the coliseum from rockwell!
Love to own that truck in UK be cool
I have a roll coal hoodie. I hope Dave had a hard time stuffing it into that little bag. Still wear it mostly my wife steals it. But I’m glad to own a part of your amazing life’s work.
The great old fashioned American success story!! Hard work and determination!! Very cool!!
Congratulations on your well earned success 🎊. How do we enter to win the truck and other items. Thanks
the good ol bros
I enjoy your story how you started where you are now and always helping people bless you and keep doing what you’re doing. 🙏
I know you guys had a hard getting but I had no idea great story so much love that if you know what you want in this life you can get it congrats guys always a great show much love Brothers
Living the American dream! Hard work, determination And capitalism.  Keep up the the good work.
I always have had this feeling that one of those days I would win one of the giveaways. I'll win something at some point. Thanks for keeping me entertained in the meantime!
I like you because you're real.  You worked hard for everything you have and you deserve it.  It's so sad that so many people have so much that they don't deserve and haven't worked for that is ruining America and destroying all of us who worked hard for what we have treated our customers and employees well and paid taxes.
Is the give away international?
I love every video you've put out... I love the truck...yall are amazing im glad u showed us how you got started...your life with ups and downs and LIFE!!! THANK YOU for helping families when needed...
Twist in event they will stop all production of any gas or diesel vehicles and only build EVs 😂
In case anyone is wondering, the LIKELY REASON they are making this video is because of the "Diesel Delete" legal issues with the EPA forced the issue with the TYPE of vehicles being worked on and given away by HeavyDSparks and friends! I hate to say this BUT the long day of the Cummins, Duramax and Powerstroke diesel is riding off into the blue yonder and their tears-inducing final sunset!  TOMORROW, it will be the 2000 Horsepower at 2000 foot/pounds of Torque of CUSTOM-BUILT high-heat-resistant Cobalt-Samarium electric motors mated to ultra-dense Aluminum-Ion, Aluminum-Sulfur batteries or Hydrogen Fuel Cells and the newest Sheet-Graphene Supercapacitor-based HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS!  I tell you that the Diesel Brothers of today will TRANSFORM into the ELECTRON-TWINS of tomorrow, lending their expertise to all things LOUD and HEAVY DUTY in terms of trucks, towing and hauling!  There may be no more rolling coal BUT there WILL be the digital exhaust note of THOUSANDS of horsepower STILL coming from the ruggedized IP-68/Mil-Spec-810G-rated onboard loudspeakers of those custom big rigs STILL to be built and given away!   The used oil of a busted crankshaft may be still burning in Hell BUT the NEWLY-ORDAINED MINISTERS OF ELECTRONS will bring us the 7-G's accelerated rush of electric heaven in all things truck, tractor and trailer!  The axles will still break in half! The tires will still explode or merely hiss in deflated defeat! And the tow-chains will still screech under tortured strain BUT NOW the Electric Dragon is REBORN rising from the ASHES of long-dead dinosaur oil .... TOMORROW IS A NEW DAWN AND I TELL YOU THAT HIGH NOON IS A-COMING! The gunfight at the Electric Corral is waiting for the electric gunslingers yet to be borne!   Time to Lock and Load and become ONE with THE NEWNESS of ELECTRICITY in a HEAVY DUTY TRUCK!  It's time to DYNAMITE the oily tree stumps of the last decade and EMBRACE the hiss and whirr of MEGA-VOLTS, MEGA-AMPS and MEGA-WATTS !!!  "...... In 2008, a crack mechanical team was sent to the sandy deserts of the Western USA by a court of public opinion for crimes of turbocharged horsepower to which they can't ever admit. These men promptly escaped from maximum overdrive to the American Horsepower underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a mechanical problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them....maybe you can hire The E-TEAM ......."  Bring on the sweet smells of burning electrical cable and bring us THE SHOCK OF THE ELECTRIC TRUCK AGES !!!  Rock On Wayward Sons !!!!!  V
Inspiring....and INVALUABLE to have/make a dedicated crew.... Understanding wife, perhaps a few other 100 accolades, GODS faith, human knowledge, and YOUTH 🤑👏😺👍
🍺
Hey Dave really enjoyed the video. Your relentless drive to transition to the next level is inspiring. I'll absolutely be praying that the Almighty blesses your next endeavor
You’re sold out of too many shirts in L/XL.
Dave hunting for a key was funny!
That hoody your wearing is dope , would love to know the brand
I'm handicapt  I wish
I’ve spent many years running a route between SF- Northern NV - SLC. I’ve met many entrepreneurs throughout my journey. There’s something about that part of the country that drives the likes of many young men (like myself) to get the most out of life. There were so many times I was down on my luck with little to nothing to my name. I would meet someone and hear their story, and get right back @ it.
I like this
I love your story that’s awesome shows what hard work and dedication can get you. I watched the Roman Atwood podcast with you guys. That was really inspirational. Also, you guys are the best.
Been with You for about 8 yrs, it has a great journey, this really made it all complete, Wishing you and all the crew many more years of great success and a Happy Thanksgiving.
Great vid showing where your business started and the progression. Would love to buy some merch but sadly all your tshirts are slim fit. Would be great if you carried relaxed t's for use larger folk :)
Sad to see a good thing come to an end. Hope I win the truck reminds me of my old 12v I had built before it got totaled.
The American dream is still alive. You just have to have the right idea and be willing to sacrifice to achieve it.
Standby for an email from me later. All I can say here is, Thank You So VERY MUCH
What a unit!!! That'd take my business to the next level, what a marketing piece.
MAN Brother Dave's really enjoyed watching the video I always wondered about how you two started.  What a Amazing story watching how the Hell you two did it and made a successful business grow to wear you both are today.  Can't wait to watch you both to see just what your plans are for the future will bring.  Good Luck with many more things to come!!!
Cool story bro
Wait until Trevor Milton gets sentenced. How much did he pay the Douche Brothers to commit fraud? Utah's finest
Hey DPF filter Dave the DPF filter brothers bet you haven't cut one of those out in a while hahahaha the money's in the Prius catalytic converters mate from 🇦🇺🤠🦘
I was hoping for a current shop tour
😎👍👍💜
That was a powerful video... Honestly sharing your path and history,  is the best way to help someone find their own path and future... thanks, I for one found inspiration and hope in your story... rad dodge... think ill order a few shirts test my luck, that truck makes me want to do 88m things again.  good luck on the gold mine venture.
I loved this video man. It really shows that y'all had it rough just like everyone, it also shows y'all worked your asses off to get where your at.
The front bumper and flat bed is amazing. Amazingly cool and sleek looking!  I heard the flat bed was designed/engineered in-house, but was the front bumpered designed and built in-house as well?
Respect Bro’s The diesel brothers 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍💯😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Good stuff guys. I've been with you since Diesel Bros episode 1. Cheers from West Jordan
What’s going on here? Something is up! I’m guessing that the fines are coming due from the prior lawsuits! Sorry that has to happen!
Love the video. Great to see that you all are showing the ups and downs of your career. Not everyone has money to start a business and you proved it. Keep working hard.
Props to Heavy D for the vision and props to your friends for hangin on!!! Amazing
Overseas France 🇲🇫: I can't hear end of story. It's not acceptable from those we love to follow.  So ... Please stay on sharing us passion and loved work.  Don't care when, how, but that's probably what all your fans wait from you.  Life is made of choice.  You have success and fair solid community that could be a game changer in any choice. And for some, life is long, and you are young.  You was for years on my must see list for a future travel in US incznt assume for the moment due to health and money, there is few guys on this list, you are on it.  Hope you read few words of my bad English that affirm you are worldwide must shared guys.  Cheers from France 🇲🇫 ❣️
🔥💪🔥
Loved this video just ordered from you guys. W8sh me luck.
Can not wait to see where you go from here.
Next chapter being the opening of one or more locations perhaps? Natural business evolution, expanding to more locations seems the logical thing to do. Multiple shops that build and sell badass rigs.
That hair line bro lady killer 😂😂
So just curious is LA RAZA still working with you
Just curious is Diesel Dave a full partner or do you heavy d on the whole business
Your story is very inspiring ❤️ strong friendship
End of an era but tells nothing of why it is. 🤦‍♂️
cue the lame ass clip show
I love your story!  It takes me back to the late 80’s when my ex husband and I started in business. He also always looked ahead for growth and new (any!) opportunity to expand!  Congratulations on perseverance!  I love the truck and was I not in another country, I would manifest this truck, and it would’ve mine!  Best of luck to everyone who tries to get her!
Well i cant drive a stick so i'm out lmao
Nice to see your journey.  Thanks for sharing.
Absolutely great job guys if I lived in Utah I'd loved to work for you looks like you found your niche in life thanks
I actually loved the stolen truck video.  Thought it was fun , creative and funny. Injoyed it thoroughly.  Thought the backlash was silly
good job guys  keep it up
Love watching you and the team from here in Australia! Loved seeing your journey and will continue to watch and see what happens!
as an x army guy, you guys are my inspiration.
👍
AAH BLESS YAH!
Excited to see what's next.
That was the most extreme thumbs up I've ever seen.
Man what a story.
The LORD has blessed you guys….I’m happy for you.
HeavyDSparks, I have a 1997 Dodge ram v6 magnum 1500. Doesn't work, I put $5,000. Still not reliable. Brother's
Stop spam
Why change the video title? You are always on some click bait shit. You are one of the most phony people I've ever seen
FUCK the seatbelt haters!!! Too many people way too concerned what others are doing!!
You said you would tell us what’s coming next. Jerks! Lol
What's next? You guys going to retool and set up a tampon making facility? 😆
That is cool!! You guys are awesome and thank you for all you do!!
Do you ship to Australia?
Very inspiring story, however I tell you I’ve been there, (meaning where Y’all are at now) Anyway it is so rewarding but don’t ever give up or make the wrong decisions in life, because I promise you it can all be gone with one wrong choice…….Just Sayin, losing your dream is like a death in the family when it’s your whole life and had been for 17yrs. It hurts and all I’m saying is stay healthy and make healthy choices all the way around.__Ya’ll are great guys, don’t blink and keep up the hard work, Y’all do great things for people and Y’all are very inspiring..  With Love Sincerely  Adam Dalton R.
Great story. I really enjoyed getting to know the history of HeavyDSparks.
Is it just me or does this video feels alot like goodbye,,😭😭😭😭
This was such a great video and it was well put together. Yes unfortunately we all have struggles ups and downs and the blahs and it's always such a joy to see the outcome when we don't give up. If this video isn't motivational then I don't know what would be. Alot of respect to you guys and love for giving back to the community and your subscribers 🥰
good luck
Stay-Safe Stay-Blessed,   Happy Thanksgiving. Dallas B.
Damn that’s nuts I fr watched the whole vid
Awesome show.
You never gave up and kept pounding the pavement that attitude and putting in the work and sticking to it,it pays off and you 2 are prime examples of home grown American business prodigies
You looked totally different without your beard.
Can we get the story on the mega ram runner
big changes? Time to do some radical ev ?
You guys have inspired me since day 1 to build something and nurture it. To build a legacy. I love you guys & everything you stand for. No joke. Pure inspiration.
America have a civil right, not To wear a Helmet, Not to wear a Seat Belt, and able to carry a Gun... 7 Billion, 700 Million people look at america, and Go? Fn idiots... 475 Mass shootings this year and growing... no other country on the planet has that.. And next year it's roll over and repeat... no other country in the world have Yearly Mass Shootings... Your Struggles, what BS, typical American, you ripped people off, to make money... Put your seat belt on, because pealing your face of the windscreen isn't fun...
Hmmm,what’s next?? 😮🇺🇸
my favorite one yet it was awesome to see the history of Heavy D and the boys
Super inspirational
Awesome, Gentlemen. I watched the Discovery show is how I heard of you both. I would say as my knowledge and the use of the whole social media platform grew is when I became a subscriber. My family and I love what you both do and enjoy watching the videos. Shot out to the whole crew and family from  the other side of the world. The Islands of the Marianas
👍🏼🛠🚛🚗🇦🇪
Hey love you guys so much. You have the biggest hearts and have overcome so much. You've really helped to improve and inspire me and millions to not to give up on there dreams I hope to be  successful as you one day stay blessed 😊
Thanks for an awesome Vlog Heavy D and Diesel Dave.  What a whirlwind story for you too but very riveting and awesome to hear how you guys started out and where it has brought you to today.  Looking forward to what the future has in store for you guys and your crew.
I lived in the HOA across the street for a year -- I never watched you guys back then but I always saw the monster truck bus and man I really wish I stopped in and said hello Maybe I will soon, We could super use your help Dave, and Dave
Great to see all the land rover's,  what a fantastic story.
is the end that you will stop clickbaiting and refund all the powerbox giveaways?
I'm thinking EVs are the next foray but Dang I want that truck soooo bad
Loved the video guys... Thanks for taking us on the journey with you...
Well done guys, I wish we could win your stuff here in Australia, I saw you first here on the TV show then started watching your You tubes, love what you do.
Literally no clue what this means for the this channel, your business and just huh????
Awesome video. I realized i have following you guys a bit after you start the business. Love to see how big it became and still growing. Keep it going. That Dodge is awesome. Looks so clean. It's a bummer you do the give aways only in the US. Lots of love from the Netherlands
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! YOUR GUY AT ROCKWELL WATCHES HAS A FRICKIN WATCH FOR SALE FOR 170.000.00 WTFFFf????? LOLOLLOL THAT IS INSAINE BROOOO!!!! JUST SAYIN!!!! THANKS, F.M.V.
Thank for sharing guys.
The American dream
first let me say location #2 wasnt a total failure, you learned alot Im sure.. most of all you discovered the temerity to carry in and thats something worth dozen failures.. ;)
I'm looking forward to your future videos. I am sure whatever is next will be huge and I am looking forward to it.
That trucks missing the quad mini gun water squirter  placement in the rear
Would love to have this truck in snowy weather in Europe but shipping costs would be a nightmare
I am only half way through this video and already I see exactly how hard you have worked to get where you are. You two are great guys. My husband and I love to watch all your videos. It’s nice to see how you got your start. When you first start these kinds of projects, most people don’t have thousands of dollars of equipment. It teaches you to be more creative on your processes. As you add tools the things you can do become easier. These are the life lessons that everyone needs to learn. You have come a long way. You are an amazing man with skills we respect not to mention your eager willingness to pay it forward and help so many other people. You my friend are someone to look up to!
The video states, “it’s over..” and “end of an era” is it the family growing up you want more time at home. Stepping away from something or changing roles? Something big is happening here. I feel so confused it’s eating me up. Something that’s going to blow our minds is coming. Last truck give away ever. But yet still doing give away but changing format. I hope my fav show isn’t ending or someone’s leaving or parting ways. What’s going on boys
Merch purchased 👍 Been following since Bldg#5 first give away truck.  Done good!!
Did you win or loose money on each property when changing?
Inspiring 🤝
I use to watch diesel bros before u was even on YouTube I miss seeing them trucks get built it’s wild u done with the give always done that since episode 1
odds on them transitioning to fully electric vehicles and modifications... incredible story and journey, btw guys. inspirational!
It all paid off…amazed by how you bros stood up together
What!!! I thought you guys were born with beards. I’m need to rub my eyes and replay…. 😂❤ you guys are great!
🙏🇹🇭
Going electric!?
I really salute for the hard work of this guy's,amazing people...your my idol sir
Which scum bags dumped all them used tyres
great video dave and dave are really interesting as I was in the mechanical business and similar things happened to me with leases on buildings but I finally found my dream garage which I have now sold to a great friend of mine as I am done spannering time for relaxation and cruising the seas as I did 38 years of hard work now to spend and relax love watching your videos your a great couple of guys you have great employees like hunter and bud and all the others just great guys who work hard and play hard that's what I loved doing now I play hard yeeehaaa. all the best from rugby UK.
I absolutely love u guys. There’s no one that holds a candle to y’all anywhere. The best video I’ve ever seen
So  you   MOUNTAIN  MEN   WILL HAVE   TIME  TO GET BACK TO MOUNTAIN    WOMEN  Men from boys  is the size of their TOYS   TAKE CARE    BOYS
Nice
the true american dream
so why is it an end of an era? whats over?
it really is best to get your failures done by age thirty.  sets you up for a lifetime.  I started with 15 pounds and never looked back.
That door to door knocking is the best way to make cash for anyone starting off.
It’s over? I know what’s not over, the click bait. :)
I actually liked the stolen truck video for some reason. It was kind of funny
So nice to see more of your family.  Have you introduced your mom on a video?
Top people a real inspiration to others keep it going well done ,
Good luck to those that win the truck, I'd never win. I never have 'positive luck', only bad luck. At least is constant though.
2:37 The last diesel powered give away truck that we will ever see !
Happy holidays thanks you and ur friends  doing your videos and telling us how everything  u did to get to this point
Look at you two.. all young and short hair...  An interesting insight into your background.. you've certainly come a long way, but you're definitely living the dream now...
Dave thanks for a fantastic video, about the hard struggle you've gone through to get where you are now
Great success story guys…well done 👏🏻👏🏻🇬🇧
Nice video boys i found you before a month and spend all my free time to see your videos keep up good work greetings from Greece
Truly inspiring  ! Loved you guys since day one . Very entertaining love watching all the stuff you put out. 👍
You are so fortunate living in the USA it wouldn't of happened in the UK. not enough space. Thank you for sharing your journey and keep dreaming.
awesome, great vid! shot for the story keep on keeping on boyz!
Nice
Lets hear the emission lawsuit story over the EPA. Want to hear the facts.
Just wondering what happened to Chris and Jose, and did Dave ever move out of the office?
U guys scared me I thought u were giving up and going???!!!!
Hi guys is this for me dave from uk
dont do the no more diesels bullshit
Wandering if vacuum packing might have helped?
Great vid guys !!!Something a mentor said to me many years ago " How do you eat an elephant??    One bite at a time"  take really big bites and chew really fast.......Thats how many businesses kicked off. Great to see you blokes reaping your rewards.
Can we have a shop tour????
This video was so great,  good to get back  ground of how hard you guys have worked. Super excited about your next adventure. When I finally come to the USA I'll visit.  How about a world  tour finding unusual vehicles, and stop by Australia .
love it - can't wait 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I have watched almost all your videos since I came across you guys earlier this year  and to see this video of your journey and how you got to where you are now was great. you guys have done great work with the help you give others  with nothing in return I wish  there where more people like you out there. GOD has blessed you keepup the good work
The OLD ADAGE Ya gotta spend money to make money. Also you work ya balls off, along with doing what's needed to get the job done and out the door. Great VID HDS and guys. Hope ya keep growing and making wild video's.
I loved that you shared your business journey with us. I know that both of you growing up we’re very poor; and starting a business is really super hard and takes your money really fast.   Thank you for sharing.  Great video.  I like these kind of humble videos.  👍🏻👍🏻
Too good guys
Great to hear your story...
Rollin coal is a fates that comes and go like tense what is going on the streets and other garages are doing and its not my thing if you ask me about it i will stay with the straight pipes and normal pipes on them as well with a 7.3 idi diesel engine
When I read “it’s over” I instantly thought that Diesel Dave would stop dressing up in his “Daisy Dukes” & cowboy boots.
HELL MAN!!!  Y'ALL BOTH STARTED OFF FILTHY RICH!!!  WTF YOU TRYINA SAY???  SURE ITS GREAT Y'ALL BE THANKFUL AND ALL THAT, BUT MAN, WAKE UP!!!  Y'ALL STARTED THIS ALL OUT WITH MONEY COMIN OUT YOUR EARS!!!  GUARANTEE YOU, YOU COULD NEVER GET WHERE YOU ARE, STARTIN WHERE i AM NOW AND I INHERITED A PIECE OF LAND I DON'T HAVE T PAY FOR!!!

Heavy D or audience. Can someone tell me what that zip up hoodie is that Heavy D is wearing in this video?
Y’all are a great inspiration to me
Bro, don't apologize for your "Rollin Coal" business, there was nothing wrong with it then and there is nothing wrong with it now, despite the haters. The bullshit you all went through was the result of liberal leftists bias, and while we definitely need to take care of our planet, I'll start faulting you when the rich elite starts taking responsibility for the pollution they put out through private jets and the like...  Great video, long journey, well done!
will you ship the truck to australia if i win ?
I still have the rubber wristband and diesel power shirt from that exact truck and that’s what got me hooked  on diesel power on Facebook I dont think you even had a YouTube channel at the time. This is so rad I feel I need to try for this truck
As a struggling new YouTube channel I appreciate hearing your story and thank you for sharing the journey with us.
Just saying, i liked the stolen truck video, XD
"Frozen pizza joints." Lmfao. Great video.
I like that camo hoodie. Anyone know where I can find it?
AMAZING STORY! Love the channel and everything you guy's do! I'm from Utah and I'm proud to see you guys representing Utah the right way! Keep it going!!! ✌🏼💯🇺🇸
Hard to believe I’ve watched and followed this story for that long!
Can't wait to see what y'all do next.
Top blokes you's are both very inspirational also bradas cher
Need some training..
Wish I could go walk the wall and chill with Buddhists.....
Let's hear what invisible man in the clouds God has to say,,, take it yourselves!  Stop this God shit! You lads are the ones who need the credit, not some fictional character in the sky. You 2 are why, not that religious crap.
It's so cool to redo a project and do it with the new tools and skills you have now.
The outro lmfaooo. Loved that bit of history guys, you all came a long way!
I wanna win that truck..
Good stuff DB congratulations to all of your progress and accomplishments!!
Loved the story! I love hearing stories about how people improved, including the ups and downs.   I do have a question though. How does the competition work if someone overseas wins?
❤❤ respect
Does this mean there’s no more chance to win a choice of any of your toys ? Helicopter please pretty please
Bless y'all.❤️
Can you build this mom an awesome handicapped accessible suv for my little princess??  That would be AMAZING 👏 😍 🙌 😇
Wow D., for a diesel it sounds smooth!
30 seconds in & IM HOOKED  for the next hour = solid in the middle o' rhe night
3rd location is on redwood road near rose park in Salt Lake City. Was living in rose park. There’s a fun little road to race cars on by the oil refinery down the road :)
good story, thanks ! and hi from Finland :)
This is a truly amazing success story of follow your dreams and never give up until you get what you want. You had a dream and nothing stopped you achieving it. Automotive has changed so much over the past 10 years and I know what’s next for the boys is going to kick ass and take shit to the next level. :)   Ps if you want a custom fabricator I’m happy to move from nz to work with you guys lol
Do you own the building now
FANTASTIC,  it just goes to show what determination perseverance love and passion can do when you have a dream and you wanna see it come true welldone all of you!  As Sir Winston Churchill once said " IF YOU'RE GOING THROUGH HELL, KEEP GOING".
I think this is awesome video of how you got started, travels from one to another building and up to date.  I have been watching your videos for some time now.  the world needs more Humble people like you.
How about an evolution video on how you became a helicopter pilot and the desire for the black hawk???
I enjoyed the story and just wanted to let you know that I just bought a l hoodie from your website
Good business breeds good vibes. Good vibes breeds good people. Good people breeds good lives.
The pic of the 2 of you younger you look so familiar. Were you born and raised where you are now?
I am so happy for you!
I can relate to the journey here in so many ways. I know the challenges that come with trying to start and build a brand. What it’s like to see tremendous growth. How it feels to move again 7 months down the road when you had sworn you found the right location. One helluva journey for you guys and though I look forward to seeing what’s next it’s still crazy to see what’s behind. Thanks for the years of entertainment and can’t wait to see what’s next!
From epiq content to epiq adds but sadly only ever adds now
I got 37min in to watching this. You say are we bored yet. No way I found this very entertaining and so interesting how you guys got started. The title of this you tube vid. Noooooooo!!! don't stop your vids they so good and entertaining. So happy you guys still doing your vids.
Watch your guys great content regularly. Im a soldier in the Utah army National guard. Saving up for our next deployment to get my first big truck when I get home. Love the story in your episode today about starting from scratch to become successful. That’s what the army has done for me.
SISU is the Finnish version of the Hägglunds BV206

Diesel David clean shaven reminded me of Terrence Hill. I reckon their antics would be similar as well.
God bless Texas and God bless America
Thanks for All your great videos big bro congratulations for all you success
It's over bros. Good Run.
Sounds like you had a lot of good friends and connections. I've tried to open my own place a few times and always failed to get the needed money.
Big respect.
What an amazing story.  Proud of you guys and your journey ❤
This is Fake this dude said I win 10,000 dollar's and all it was was a lie 🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥
@HeavyDSparks love this video thank you for filming it. i wish i could have the chance to win the beauitful rig but i dont think ya'll would frieght it to cowra nsw australia lol
Nice, hopefully the next journey is not electric junk that no true Motörhead wants.
You guys are bad ass!!! Viva Mexico Carbone's.....
How many times have you been broken into or had stuff stolen? Where I live if you start doing well for yourself you always get someone spoil it and so called "friends" getting jealous.
Shortly before my mother died she gave me an envelope of papers. There was an old civil service application of my father's. I also found his old Los Angeles used car salesman identification card. (1950's) I never knew he was a used car salesman. I don't think he ever applied for civil service either but I have his complete work history. It's a neat piece of history to give to my sons.
I'm an old widow woman who ran across your video about finding Alan's fortress and subscribed to him, because his project is fascinating.  I didn't think I'd enjoy your video's but saw you had a whole team of hunks and I'm old, not dead. Then I realized you all are great guy's with hearts of gold who have struggled to get where you are and I really respect that. Kudos! And I love the music.
I’m not here for the truck but I am here for the wisdom.  Thank you for sharing 🙏
I have to wonder just how many people you fellas inspired by making this video alone? You definitely impress me in what you have done and are doing. May GOD HIMSELF Bless and continue to inspire all of you!
Thanks for all the vids, interesting, entertaining,  and fun....keep it up
That was a nice  piece of History to learn.
Very cool, to watch you boys ! Oorah !
That's awesome to your journey to see how you made it to where you are now. It's so good to see you never quite
My husband met you guys at MdAnderson as he was getting out of treatment and I was just outside waiting for him. He hasn't been able to go back for treatment because we have not had a vehicle since June and we live almost 2hrs north of the hospital.
can someone seriously tell me what this video is about I'm not watching 48 minutes of this youtube cockteasing to figure what nonsense this is
What are those things on the windows and where can I get them?
Where is your camo jacket from? Love it!
GOODLUCK ON THE NEXT CHAPTER BOYS
I don't understand how one day there searching for a missing person the next there saving people off a mountain the next a video for truck
Good channel,. GOOD STORYY, GREAT CONTENT. Love this! LOVE
What a Great story into the trials and tribulations of your journey thus far. There’s still many more chapters to this book before it’s complete, Myself and I would assume many more others can’t wait to see what the future brings for HeavyD. To the stratosphere!
Well boys if I can be one of the first to say a huge big thankyou for everything that yous have done cos like the old saying we all need to crawl before we can run and yous are now running with it and well done for pushing through it all cos now we all get to injoy your hard labour cheers guys love what yous have done and continue doing if I was near the winners place I would be going hard with getting mech but I live in Australia and we don't get the chance to win these kind of things but we can still dream and that I will be doing lol cheers boys for everything yous have done for us love it can't wait for the next chapter
Try being sick with cancer and several other serious illnesses and having NOTHING! NO JOB, FAMILY, KIDS, HOUSE OR APARTMENT,  AND CAN'T WORK! I struggle and cry because I know my life is just more hell with nothing to show for it. Died 4 times, coma for most of 2017, 8 ft of intestines removed, kidney failure, bones of a 80 yr old women and more! God please help! Take me or help me live instead of waiting to die!
I can't wait to see what yall do next.
lol, you guys look a lot better without all that fluff around your face, ;-)
Only been watching your videos for about 8 month's now.  You guys are awesome and so inspiring.  May God bless you all. Praying that the lord keeps you all safe and blesses you all abundantly.  Good luck and God bless with the next chapter in your journey.  Love you Guys.
fuck i dont have the patience to listen to this shit just say what it is
Its always koo to watch you tell your stories. I really enjoy your shows. Thank you and Dave you guys are awesome. Just keep having fun.🥰
I loved this as much as I love you all! I need to move to Utah! I have skills..

i remember the smoot on the bathroom prank it was either that or the trucks cab flipping up when i started watch you whichever came first
What a great store . It was fun watching you from the beginning to what you have now. Great video.
I am totally enthralled with your content as most of us here are.  Been watching the show since season one and love the comradery you all have and how you evolved.  Your even more generous now because of the financial abilities granted to you by God and your kindred spirit. My son's have watched you along side of me and get inspired seeing the greatness you do each and everyday.  They see the things my wife and I do to support our community and it good to have our kids grow up with the right inspiration and your kids will take after you. Keep it up. Prayers and well wishes to your next leg .
What was that that popped up at 31:54?
i cant believe how far you have come in just 10 years... you are honestly an inspiration to everyone.
This would help us so much 😃
I'd like to give a true shout out. Thank You Tonka Trucks! You have inspired greatness! From the sandbox to Beyond!
Cool Story! do anything with Brian? He has stretched a few trucks for us and he is a really solid guy
I have enjoyed watching your videos!!

Merica 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

A good ol Bevis and Butthead story gone truckin". HalleluYah!
i remember those days i feel you on that one.. it's like clouds and rain over your head... the struggles and hustle day and night..starting with nothing.. bridges were burn, bridges were broken on accidents. relationships went sour, emotional wreck ..
are the giveaways available for Canaderpians?
Sound electric
Very cool of you to show us the path That led you to now
i work in the oil fileld and i drive a grand cherokee with oilfieald mafia stickers on it i get repspect but when i drive my work truck to the rig thay look at me funy i am trying make it big or go home waching this will keap my head up
I am a great grandmother who will be 72 in a few days. I had a trucking company in Texas that worked in the oil field for a couple of years. I had a Dodge dully and pulled a 44 foot goose neck. I love your channel, would love to drive some of your machines, they are beasts. When you pulled that house boat back into the lake, it blew my mind. My favorite was when the snow machine went down the mountain, and your buddy was ok. Thank you Jesus. Keep going.
Merica 🇺🇸
You had it so bad ahhhhh poor thing what a sad story of coming from the gutter!!
anyone se the red screen with all the Chinese writing? at 31:54
I HAVE SOOO MUCH RESPECT FOR THE BOTH OF YOU !!! GOD BLESS
Your story is an inspiration, I have just started my own little business out of my kitchen ( I make and sell sausage rolls and samosas plus the featured product biltong(beef jerky) chili bites and dry worse.  These "foods" things are like a staple food in Namibia (Africa). Well, I am working my ass off, do have some help...but I am doing my own marketing/selling/branding and also working on merch.  But watching you do what you did and be where you are now, I am super stoked.  By the way, as I make my pies I binge-watch your channel, Oh crap yes and I am also a full-time photographer. hahah.  Thank you for this video today I really needed it.  Be Blesses guys.
Wow wow old tight.  " diesel dave. Great Wall of China and marathons" a set of words   that need examining so much more..
?
Am I the only 1 that was tripped out by seeing these 2 geniuses without beards
Jesus christ man this is me just cant ge the traction 😔
What a very impressive and informative video,thanks for letting us know how u started thanks again good luck in ur future business ventures
My favourite YouTuber of this year 💥
Brilliant and inspirational story, dont stop helping and assisting which have earned  you, your success. Most of all your hard work as built you  Empire
As always, you guys put on a great show. Loved to see how it all started. Yes you have worked extremely hard, but there is some luck in it too. I wish I had a little luck with some of my adventures. Keep up the great work and humanitarian work you guys do so well.
I remember watching both of you on Discovery
Hey dave I'm 18 and in school for diesel and heavy equipment mechanics at lwtech, love the videos, always be watching the recoveries, going to get a couple entries to win the truck rn!  Keep it up plz!
love your content mate.
Proud of you guys and the struggles you have had
Low miles only a 100,000k miles on it,,,,😅😂🤣😅😂 This infomercial wasn't a infomercial,,, you should do stand up comedy 😆
need to go have Daves hair fixed, its not that much
Holy Cow! Im jist sitting here listening to the whole story and Im realizing Ive been here for the whole thing. I was addicted to Discovery when I was younger and you guys came on. Man youve grown so much, and I ended up losing my 10 year rental in the housing crisis here and was left basically homeless with my child hoping my go fund me helps us get a piece aof land to grow on. Youre an amazing inspiration for me to start building tiny homes to help people! Thank you for everything.
im going to need a high definition portrait of this photo @0:39 !!! Look at that smile!!!! Cant wait to listen to the story and it humbles me to find out you guys have been friends for a long time not just business partners.
Damn that new build is sweet. You guys are really awesome people
wow thanks for sharing I have a 2006 dodge crew cab and love it.  You and   Dave  are a inspiration to watch. I just keep thinking how cool would it be to have  had a dad like one of you. keep it up !
That stretched dually van drove around Springfield Mo and I had I no idea you guys built that! That picture was taken in front of hammons field the Springfield cardinals stadium!
Good video
Love the video guys great to see the beginning till now. Keep up the great work guys.
🧡🌟💜🌟❤️
I loved the video, Thank you for sharing your story.
You have certainly done the hard yards, but you guys have definitely made it work. You should be bloody proud, I would be.
You guys are top notch
I been watching for years love the show it’s hard for me to purchase anything  I wish I can  win
I love the honesty and transparency in this video
Help your friend so he doesn't have to live at work!!! Poor guy.
its been great to watch your content and look forward to what comes next. Keep on keeping on , and may God bless your families all of you Happy thanks giving.
Great history keep doing great things will y'all be doing custom builds
Guys,  don't get Me wrong, I love  hearing of how you started and  your  dreams and progress..and I truely admire and look up to the Opportunities you guys have been given.  Being have had Similar dreams and a Journey of my own through the years as a  cust fab/cust turbo fab and tuning shop owner in the  time of things starting To "take off". But the marketing aspect that is brought in towards the  end of most of your vids ruins it for me.. No mention of the epa issues, struggle and fines during the progress of growth..  I respect what your doing,as everyone wants to, and needs to expand ànd make $  And grow..  But lately most vids have seem to have had an agenda in the end.  The masses today don't see it. But those that been in the game  from way back can't turn a blind eye. I Love how you help and bring others to the front line and help them achieve by exposure.  No disrespect , but.just making light of things that may be needed to be thought of In current day marketing when there is still the smart  "og,s"(lol.) Sitting back with popcorn watching.  From" one" to "another ", I hope you can relate ,understand , and  not take anything personally.. J-
Why is this the last Cummins truck?
🀄♥️
What a great story  Thank you for sharing
I just love you guys! Awesome crew!
Heck yea man my dream is to build up my first 7.3 powerstroke and I’m fixing to buy my first big modification for it it’s a kc turbo 300x gen2 its my dream to build my truck
Really enjoyed this video! Always wondered where you guys come from! 👍
Such a cool video.  Thanks for taking us on this adventure.
Omgosh, I've been following you guys since the Discovery Channel @#7, wow! ♡ liven the dream
Excellent video
Buro!  0:43   Same..... same
I have nothing but respect and admiration for you and your entire crew. To see how you built your empire from the ground up and from nothing is inspirational. Thanks for this video!
To see this video of the history of were u guys started to were u guys r at today is awesome. To see how big ur channel has grown to today just shows how humble and great u guys r on the way u help ppl out and have grown with the same crew over the yrs. U guys r awesome and very blessed to have been able to grow so big and still bein able to grow together. Love all ur content and everythin u guys do. U guys r truily a great bunch of ppl.
Your an amazing dude foreal. I'd like to work for you.. Prolly hear that alot tho
Yeah... to bad I live in California and diesel is around 7$ a gallon
i'd call it a raffle it's a bit more honest, tickets are $5 each to be in with a chance to win a nice truck but the merch is extra advertising, spreads the brand further
So are you guy finishing up or will there still be a YouTube channel I don't really get what this video was about is it a way to say goodbye
With the world full of Wolk it’s just nice to see men doing man things.   Great story
Your buddy looks like a rabbi
Just curious how fast do you drive with your flag up I have the same size flag on my Durango and I've gotten upto about 100 to 105
This is living proof that dreams do come true if you put your mind into it and put in a lot of hard work! You guys are a true inspiration to all of us. Please stay safe and healthy and God bless.🙏🏻👍
Thanks for this. Unique vid. The truth.
AMAZING! CONGRATS!
great vid.I went to the site to sign up and by something i can afford and the lanyard was to much for me ...sorry. being retired really sucks..
Do y’all still got that cabover truck only seen it one time
DD brothers, if I win the truck I want you to resell it for a charity of your choice. I've been watching for years and charity is the way to go. Love you guys!
as much as i like the videos i gotta say i have never seen one show of yours on discovery( i dont watch mainstream tv) i enjoy the hell out of most of your videos here on youtube. as much as i would like to get in on the drawing paying even 15 bucks for a ball cap is out of the question. one day maybe i can get out your way and roll in to meet yall but until then keeps the videos coming very much enjoy them take care yall
Huge fan this was really cool to see !
I watched the whole vid didn't lose my attention!
It has been a hell of a ride.
Someone explain to me why a give away requires a minimum of $5 purchase to gain an entry? To give away implies to give for free. Wouldn't a $5 raffle entry be more appropriate and not misleading?
One of the best videos. Thanks for sharing your story.
Thumbs up if you have been here since the MegaRamRunner.
We need a video on Dave, looks like he's done so much and it doesn't seem like he has much to show for it. You've got all these high ticket toys yet we've only seen that Dave has a elcamino hung on your wall like a picture and his mini car that I think he said he daily drives. Is he still living in you basement or has he finally been able to build his dreams like he's helped his buddy do for so long.
Hard knocks
That's a jawdroppingly gorgeous wow!!! And the sound of the Cummins is awesome 👌 👌👌 love it especially the flatbed perfect for putting that always handy to have that 5th wheel for my dream RV
Love ya guys, glad you guys came up.. you always would have made it, no matter what. .. I'm bout given up on life it's bs. So many games once you start making money. I'm done. Love ya vids tho they keep me goin. I'd love work with y'all done alot of this.  Go went don't care about me tho jus you n YouTube
While it's not a recovery it is! Nice Job! Lunch on me when I can get back down that way!
Im from the Philippines and im a big of yours...God Bless you Diesel brothers..
This is a great video!  You guys looked totally different without the beards!  It was nice to see your progress over the years and see the hard work you put into it!  One question, will the Discovery show ever come back?
Love the story.  Most businesses that start up don’t last more than a year.  The fact you made it succeed is huge.  Keep up the good work
Congrats on the success
What a crazy life. You've both come up from the dirt and made it. Congratulations to you all.
Believe this is my favorite video
Hey DHeavy D ND Diesel Dave, been a long time fan, been to your store in UT twice have made many purchases online. I just watched your latest you tube of your last truck giveawayn tride to purchase your everything pack, but it wouldn't  let me login, kept going back to creating new account and the robot verification, not sure if you have an issue with website or what, disappointed,  I have tried to win four/five of your awesome trucks and wear your gear regularly,  fyi will keep watching your YouTube channels
I really enjoyed this video. You're truly self made men, yet you have maintained your integrity and haven't forgotten how it feels to have nothing. My favorite saying (and I'm not well off by any stretch of the imagination) is, "I give,  not because I have so much,  but because I remember what it feels like to have nothing. " You're the embodiment of that saying!
I have Enjoyed your guys story, family bond and sheer determination to do what you love most and thats helping people. This isn’t the end of a era this is just a chapter change in your guys book of life. Thank you for letting us be apart of it and sharing that anything Is possible with determination. I look forward to seeing what you guys build and do next!
Hello Guys! Happy Sunday.  This Flatbed is  So Great!  Merch! Merch !Merch!
If I win Dave, Id rather forgo the truck, and work for ya??? That would be a dream of mine, to have friends/know people like you guys.
thank you and your amazing team. My beautiful wife and myself live in upper Wyoming and love how "real" all of you are, we watch every YouTube video you create.
You guys are the embodiment of the American spirit, drive, and relentless pursuit of awesome. Congrats, you’ve earned it!
I really really enjoyed this basically touching old roots I will gladly sit and watch this video over even if it 48m loved the engery and whole thing about this keep on being awesome diesel brothers!!
The building youre in was owned by Contour Composites. I wont go into why it was for sale but I can say I own a machine shop and had to take the owner to court to get paid.
Wish I had the $5 to enter, love you guys, watched and followed you for a long time, seen your struggle over the years and you guys have come from nothing and created an empire and one awesome brand. Once I get myself back on my feet (disabled vet on hard times won't bother anyone with details) I'll be able to enter your giveaways, I know I wouldn't win (I have the worst luck ever, I could scratch off a lottery ticket and I'd end up owing $50k) but I'd be happy just knowing my money goes to an awesome group of guys with an awesome brand and know it goes to making more awesome content. Keep up the hard work guys.
I laughed my ass off watching the clip of you smoking Johnny out while he was on the toilet! He's a good friend of mine and talked about that forever. Enjoy watching you guys. Love to hang out with y'all sometime....
Well done! Big dreams + hard work + giving back + persistence +  rinse off + repeat = Big wins! You keep on dreaming Big!
Best of luck from a guy who lives close by in Bountiful.
Its crazy it's only been 7 years, well almost 8 since the tv show started and it feels like you haven't been doing it forever now.
YES...NOW I KNOW WHO, WHAT AND WHERE YOU COME FROM. WHAT A FASCINATING JOURNEY... LIVES LIVED. I AM SURE JOU LOVED EVERY MINUTE. LOVE YOUR HISTORY. YOU ALL CAN ONLY BE BLESSED IN FUTURE. LOTS OF LOVE.
I was left hanging. Did they buy the last building or rent it?
Great story!!
Is there anyway to be entered to get the truck for free. I really need a truck but can't afford to get one and it's going to be a few years before i can get on my feet. I just need a little help. After 34 years in construction i messed up my lower back bad and now I'm disabled
Thank you diesel Brothers stay humble
Took the first minute and I was hooked
🙏🙌🔥
Thanks for sharing!
Do the Mexican mechanics still work for you?
You two put a lot of miles on my new truck! 🤣🤣🤣 great video!
Would love to own a piece of history from you guys.... Great Journey! So Far....
I love y'all, from where you started to where you're going!..💚
great story
@31:53 missing picture file
Great journey guys! I love what you do and cant wait to see whats next! Keep doing what you're doing brother.
I'm broke and unemployed can't afford to fix my 99 dodge 24 value it has a automated transmission I wish it was a standard I was repairing generators diesel engines  for the last 25 years by with the prices of fuel it's been hard to get work
Are you two brothers??
Good luck boys
Yep You’ll be successful with your new ideas because you are a man that makes it happen
Great story
So I keep hearing you wouldn't be anything if it wasn't for other people and "your success" was given to you. Must be nice
And in the end, thank God for the Internet and Youtube. That seems to be the norm these days. Antics interest people and so people watch and support antics. Whether those antics are silly or technical or compassionate, the antics win the attention of people and people's attention equals money.  Antics without advertising equals failure. The Internet led to Discovery which started the advertising which led to Youtube and success.
Did anyone else notice @31:55 what was that even? Kind of weird.
Living the American dream!
❤️🇺🇸🤘
You guys are awesome!
I love watching your utob videos and TV shows I would love by some of your stickers and shirts
Wow ! Good for you Heavy D for not giving up!
Do you guys still have the original mechanics? Wonder if you all stuck together?
Thank you for the backstory on your operation! I've often wondered how you got to where you are.  Great job and wish you more success in the future!
I’ve been watching y’all for a good while now and even though y’all always post PHENOMENAL content this video is hands down my favorite!!!!! Y’all have actually inspired me to make some changes for myself and what I’m doing in the Laser world. Thank you for sharing
Hard work and a dream..Now look at you!!! Congratulations guys and God bless America.
Not gunu lie I gave you the benefit of the doubt until you said you were car salesman’s now I don’t trust you lol
Good luck guys
Damn, way to hang tough! Congrats. Enjoy you channel. Cool to see you hook up with Matt’s recovery.
Did you ever get to do a show with the MythBusters?
Absolutely awesome video.  Wish nothing but the best for your team and keep doing what you do.  I've been following you guys for years and the progress is beautiful.  And Wish all of the team a Happy and safe Thanksgiving from this fan.
I wish I could have you guys build my Duramax. Alas, just can't afford it. Maybe someday I'll at the very least get to meet you guys and your team. Thanks for the videos. Happy Thanksgiving to all and your families.
@15:26 Do I spy The Freedom Bus
Very humbling video fellas. It definitely wasn’t an overnight success! Hard work and persistence pays off.

It is great to hear the background I took off my first airplane off that strip was not a good one but fun
@heavyDSparks when you bought your first place were you a qualified mechanic
Wow what a ride but u can see what determination an ambition will get u in life..
moving a complet shop is a pain.  But if the move is for bigger and better its worth it. and most shops/businessesHave a rough time when they're first getting startedMay 8th you stuck with it even when failureseemed closeYou did what a lot of guys can'tYou turned what could have been adversity or failure into thriving businessI've been there a couple of times over the yearsMe and my buddy when we started our shop We about at last everything we had that we put into it a couple times These days things are looking pretty good
Finally work close caption. Thank u so many  u good experience  start small property   For long time   U got a big property   Better  are u plan give away that green truck I like type truck look like heavy duty wheel. Cool 😅
Thanks for the history! Amazing struggles you overcame and and quite a few challenges you faced.

American dream ❤
Diesel  bro I want to enter to win but I cant buy anything from the web I just came back from a life support machine... and I can not move my legs but I can work with my hands and complete any thing u put 4th for me to do ... I can show u  ....GOD BLESS HEAVY D SPARKS ...
You have done so much for others .You deserve all  the best .
Man, watching this video just listening to your story I can really feel the emotion of your hardships and successes. It hits home for me because I have always dreamed of having my own automotive shop and for the past 15 years I've worked out of my home or doing mobile mechanic work all while working a "9-5" job and I have finally landed an opportunity to have my own legit business that I am signing the lease for next week. This video really added wood to the fire of my motivation and I am really happy for you guys and your success. Keep being great and don't ever stop pushing yourself to be better.
Hahaha thats so funny the "convertible tour bus" on the paper picture is meant to be one of those old double decker busses in england but is a replica which has half the roof cut off  (the exact same bus in the pic" in my city of, Victoria British Columbia Canada!! what a funny way this video has a local refrence!
I remember getting one of those usps boxes. I couldn’t believe you got five shirts and a xxl hoodie in it. I was impressed.
I think this might be the best video you guys ever made.
Your business story is amazing!  To say that you clawed, and scratched your way to success would be putting it mildly.  Seriously, Diesel Dave taking showers out of a garden hose every morning at a business location?   Never heard of that one before!   lol   Congrats on a successful run, and I can't wait to see where you're headed next!
31:54 wtf is that??
So amazing,! Thank you guys,! ❤️
An American dream come true through perseverance and hard work. That sweet truck belongs in my yard.
I love everything that you’ll have ever done I’ve watch a lot off your stuff and you’ll personally’s
Why stop building diesels trucks?
i will never win this hopefully whoever gets this appreciates what you have put into this truck
Like all your shows ,  keep it up . Always a diesel guy
Much respect for you guys, coming from nothing to small channel guys to, well, DIESEL, well deserved and a spot from my own experience and heart...Thank You
hreat story to tell mate
@ 0:40 OMG, that pic! WOW! ha
Such a beautiful build. Sure would look good cruising down some back roads here in Ohio ☺️
This one definitely hits home. After years of putting it off for one reason or another I have finally gotten my LLC waiting on the bond in the mail then I can file for my dealer license. It’s very hard to jump out there. I had hurt myself working in the oilfield 15 years ago and haven’t been the same since. As I am putting all this together my neck and back have decided to throw a curve ball. I will for sure have to have a surgery or two however I’m still very hopeful and I’m going to see my dream through.
i want the truck but i’m only 16 😭
16 min in and it sure seems like a video about the truck
DUDE! You guys were dirt bags!!!!!!!!  I like it!    Hustle that money! 💵💰🤑
In my heart I’m 16  .. in reality it’s 67… retired and disabled and until recently alone since 1992.  One of my friends moved in with me because she was homeless, so she kinda takes care of me and with her recent diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease i help take care of her too.   You do what you need to to make it through life. ♥️. But her and i enjoy the heck out of watching you guys running around with the BEST vehicles!!!  lol 😝  and you guys are great role models for doing the right thing all the time.  Not too many people on tv do that anymore so I’m happy I can refer to your channel for right examples of right and wrong.  Love you boys … if ever you are in Boulder CO with one of your big trucks… Susan and I would LOVE to have a ride!  💕😊😊
God bless
Incredible to hear your story because I’m kind of going through the beginning stages now like you did. I had an Aquaponics farm and bit off more than I could chew financially and it ended up going under this past summer; almost lost everything and Al’s it went homeless.  A few months later I connected with some people who genuinely wanted to see me succeed and I’ve started my new, hydroponics farm, but on a very small scale with no budget.  I’m far from being successful and every week is a grind, but like you, I have a big dream for sustainable, indoor agriculture and I refuse to give up.  Truly appreciate you sharing the highs and especially your lows because it gives me hope.
I’m literally 1 minute into this and I’m absolutely in love. You guys are incredible. Never stop kickin ass and being amazing. I mean that in such a sincere way. Fuk yeah diesel bros. Keep making the world a better place by doing exactly what you do.
I remember the cab flip. Geeze has it really been that long
Love the truck but I'd need an elevator to get in it lol.  I miss my old S10...
Man I remember them Rockwell days😂
GREAT  VIDEO FOR  SURE
Keep up the good work
Awesome story guys, cant wait to see whats next. Keep pushing! 🔥
I remember the first dodge like this. Given to a kid in Idaho who complained and complained about not getting a title fast enough.  It was a nice truck. Free truck. Dude was still bad mouthing them according to the internet at the time.  It ended up bought and sold several times on Craigslist last I herd.
I've watched you 2 and crew from about 2014, it was one of the few shows I enjoyed. Don't watch TV anymore, just stay with YouTube. You  guys have every right to be proud of all your accomplishments.  I'm a 73yr old female and still get excited when I see your awesome creations. Just don't ever stop being the honest caring individuals that you are. I don't know if you are still on TV or not sorry, just got fed up with media lies and BS commercials. So big hug for you both and know that you have helped brighten my day/evening at one time or another. Best always Rusty in Southern Oklahoma ❤️
Can’t wait to see what happens next
Mean looking beast lol
So very cool to see the progression of an American dream! Good work sir!
😊👍
nice show  john
Wow! I love it watching your show! I am poor and had hard time myself because of deaf! I wish my own business than job why some people bullied on me I hate it! I want good my life! I love work on vehicles! My favorite Chevy truck!
awesome to see the growth & success over the years.
I just listened to your podcast with Roman this morning on my way to work.  So kinda awesome to see this now
❤❤❤🥰❤❤❤
I love history, and yours is an awesome story. Thank you so much for sharing this. I wish more of my YouTube favorites could and would share their success stories as well. You guys take care and God bless.
They really don't make any better men than you. You guys are a challenge that everyone should try and accept. I'm jealous and humbled at the same time. Here's to the future!
As long as you stay away from child raping cousin diddlers, you’re good.
Way to leave us hanging! Great story, can't wait for the next adventure! Good luck guys & gals!
I remember when Diesel Brother aired for the first time! Could not miss an episode! Being a 4x4 guy I watched the hot rod shows all the time but  you guys did it for me with your show! Hope to see many more episodes! Do you make the window channel guards for sale like on the 24 valve or is that one off!?
Wait the clip of the truck rolling and stuff was one of the early vids? Damn I've been here long.
good luck on your next adventure
I sure do enjoy watching you guys!!
You guys rock! From humble beginnings to a solid business with a great team! I have loved watching your progression and the fact that you do so much for so many who need help. Your whole team are great role models for the next generation of entreprenuer's! As a fellow helicopter and fixed wing pilot ( I hold Commercial multi engine fixed wing/ instrument  and Commercial rotorcraft/helicopter ratings but only flew for a hobby not for a career) I love the joy you have for flying as well. German engineering of the MBB BO 105 was a outstanding. I always remember how solid the doors sounded when closing them unlike Bell or MD ships.
hell yeah i like it a lot i really enjoyed it
AS EPIC AS THE GREAT WALL!
I’ve only recently been watching your videos and I am hooked! Love the vehicles and your generosity with helping so many. The helicopter is pretty cool too👍
Wish I could enter to win would love to have that truck. But I can barely afford my bills now witch are not that many but still struggling since covid started. Lost our home lost a lot of our belongings but we have a car to stay in and our each other. Love what you guys do to help people. You guys so amazing things.
Did anyone else miss location 5?
''MY  KIND  OF  PEOPLE==''BLESSINGS'' IN ALL YOU DO===''RITCHIE''=84 YEAR OLD FAN==

I really appreciate the video and I would like to thank y'all for all of the stuff that you do happy Thanksgiving
''HEY'' ''BRO''==THIS IS MORE LIKE A LIFES JOURNEY==''MOVIE'?=GOOD JOB = KUDOS''
America that's why
as someone that just found you guys this video really helped me see where all of this came from and how yall got to where yall are now. one of the best from nothing to the top stories ever.
Lovely story
Dude your eye brows are plucked in a very feminine style. Rock it 😂
Awesome story! I’m literally right in the middle where you guys started. Looking forward to having a similar story and meeting you guys down the road🤙🏽
When you forget how bad the Canadian dollar is… that was an extremely expensive sweater… worth it for a chance at the truck though! Got I love the look of that!   You guys have made it so far, good job on the grind! Thanks for all the content along the way as well!
I’ve been wanting to see this video forever. Now we know the rest of the story. Thank you for the video.
Holycrap I live in Victoria, BC Canada and I see that bus with the roof off every single summer doing it’s tours to this day!!!!
What happened to the give aways every 250k subs?
🔥💕😍👍
Really interesting & inspirational - you were such a handsome couple!  Wishing you all continued success in your Onwards & Upwards - can you beat the YT trolls & scammers. thou?!  Keep safe, looking forward to the next incarnation.
Don’t worry muscle will keep building and selling junk trucks full of expanding foam
Great friend you've got there Dave.
This is why America is the best damn Country in the world.  Achieving a dream!!!!!
Thouse LEDs!
NO!!!! THIS CANT BE THE END OF DPG!!
Sounds like a company rebranding or renaming is coming. I love all the funny and good stuff you do to entertain and help people. You've always had my support. That will never change. Oh, and I have my first lifted truck because of you guys. Lol. 🇨🇦
I will still always remember Dave when he acted in game of thrones.  His obsession with the big woman will for ever entertain me
Been following y’all since day 1  great story …  loved the original cast red beard the muscle  and crew hope this isn’t the end of diesel power gear ⚙️ I’m Sure whatever you guys have planned in the future is gonna great !! Can’t wait
You guys are amazing.
God bless y’all I would soo would buy something from yall but I’m just starting my life off that god blessed me with I love watching y’all tho!!
Honestly.. crazy story. And the fact that dave just hung around and followed you blindly into the unknown is true enthusiasum. The trial and errors and shear determination to just keep grinding and changing plans non stop and looking for the next thing without a second though is grinding to the max. What a great entrepenurial mindset. For real..
Enjoyed your personal story congratulations on your journey.
Wow thanks I'm not giving up...
Can we get some Nolan content
What ever happened with Discovery channel? just curious
The American Dream👍🇺🇸
Where can I get that hoodie your wearing.
I love this! Will go buy merch. Btw, at 31:56 you have a premier media error on this video. Fyi
Wow, I never knew of the timeline of the company before you were on Discovery where I first saw you.  Thank you for doing this video.  I have to check out your mech...
Hope you make improvements.
I gotta say that photo of you two clean shaven was awesome! Great story and history, and you have a long way to go!
Awesome channel, and a really cool story. Keep up the hard work. You and your team are an inspiration to all those in the automotive industry. May God continue to bless you. Looking forward to seeing the next video.
From rags to riches! You guys chased your dreams until you were living them. Thank you for sharing the journey!
Excellent story!
An interesting journey HeavyD. We all have our own journey. Stay awesome brother👍
31:55 - Hahaha...happens to the best of us.
Well done to you and your team! Thank you for bringing us along with you on your journey.
Gee Thanks, I just got reminded how long I have been following you guys. Holy crap ! ✌🏼😎🤙🏼
Wow!
I hope I can be honest. This is one of the greatest things I've seen from your channel and I love your YouTube videos and I really didn't like your TV show because it didn't really feel like it was a real business. On this channel you show how much you care about your fellow man. Thank you for sharing your life experiences and your ups and downs. God bless you and your crew
Nice to know the background.
Does anyone know what jacket Heavy D is wearing?
I love your channel.  I really enjoyed your story.  Thank you for letting us in and sharing this with us.  Some people would of given up.  You have helped so many people.  The world needs more like you guys.
You guys are amazing thank you for sharing your journey and all i can say is i wish yall lived closer your all amazing people keep kickn a$$ and thriving in life many of us will follow yall wherever you go and whatever you do👊 If you want to invest in more property in California letme know I have 1.7 acres you can help me save😎
Have you still got the mechanics from when you stared
Awesome story!  Success isn’t easy if you give up…..thankfully you didn’t!    GOD Bless all of you!  🙏💖🙏
6:35 fool i about fell off my chair 😂😂😂
😂😂 dry your eyes Dave. Good stuff guys, awesome hearing & seeing the backstory 🤙
I like it.   I have also been through it like you but I only moved three times.
I have so much respect for you guys. Absolutely love what you do. This video shows clearly the type of people you are. Hard work always pays off. 💪 being only a couple hours away from you guys I hope to meet you someday.
I love seeing people go after their dreams and not giving up when they get knocked down, it’s a testament to your dedication and desire to see your dream become reality. You worked hard, have a great team, but most importantly you realize that your team is important to your success. I’ve watched you guys forever and wish you the best on all future endeavors.
I know many people like yourself don’t come from money, but to be where you are today! It’s astonishing and baffling. Your colossal shop, many yards, tons of vehicles and parts, employees, it started with a dream and you made it a reality! It’s so uplifting to hear with some elbow grease, you can achieve ANYTHING!
Hey what’s up bro how are you much love
Comment
Swear to god that place looks like mark martins old shops when he was still racing now I’m curious got to go hunt marks videos down
That was a beautiful story with a happy ending! Keep up the great work y’all do!
i had no idea! cool video <3
I entered to win that beautiful truck as I am a mopar man, its all I own , but it is a privilege to support you!
I am having trouble paying on your site for order.
🤙love how far y’all come keep pushing for your goals you will make anything happen
I loved this show. It really shows how hard you all worked. I really want that truck. Keep up the good work.
It's almost like working hard pays off. Who'd-a thought...
Came a long way been a big fan also I want that Camo hoodie we’re can I buy it
I think one saying that somes up their past is "what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger"
I was my late husband have a Rollback. I was his hooking I work with him. I have a birthday on 14 it would been great 👍👌
Wow, amazing journey of success-the trials & tribulations, yet the humbleness never disappeared. By giving back to community in assisting with their cries for help, totally free, you & your team are such a blessing ! Just keep going. Wish I could personally visit. Gan Govender, Durban, South Africa
Hey guys, If you ever want to lean to weld better just swing by Morgan high school. The kiddos would love it but i would gladly give you a one on one with any process you wanted . Morgan welding is on another level im telling you.
Yeah buddy. Cool stuff
This was a great video!
Good for you and your good fortune. you have made amazing trucks and many wonderful projects.  it's also very cool how you have given away so many bad ass builds and shared your talents with anybody and everyone who has watch your progress along the way of your triumphs and struggles. always enjoy watching your builds and how you help others in need. your rescue videos of people in need of assistance in way off places and bad predicaments are really cool too.  and how you  help out others as your climbed your way to where you are now is just a good example of what you and your business is all about. normal people, helping normal people. it's nice to see people with success not forgetting how or where they started from.
Thanks Guys In My Opinion This is the Greatest video you have made. It's nice to see that hard work and not giving up, can  sometimes pays off
Man yaw were just baby’s back then no beards or staches
That pic though....Makes me question how close you two are.. lol
Glad you went back to Ram
black Friday is my birthday I hope I win!  🤣 that would be an amazing bday present. also  nice to see a switch in the videos once a while.
Wow, I've been watching your videos for a while and enjoyed seeing all the cool stuff you guys have done and built. Most of all, you have my respect and kudos for all the things you guys have done to help others.👍 You guys are one of a kind. The world needs more good people like you.
My late husband would have loved you guys . Sorry I need a home more than a truck 👍 . But thanks anyway
You should do more videos about you helicopter n pilots journey     i love. Your guys  stuff.   Couldn't happen to better people.
You are the embodiment of the old school American Dream. Something that has been lost today Hard Work and a Dream. Love y'all!!!
It's good to how you guys got to where you are. This is how we work in America, wild and crazy antics, struggle and innovation. Keep going after your dreams.
Back in the good old days when we could beat off in the spring works building......oh the memories.....
Dave you’re an inspiration man.  I’m a contractor out of CA scratching to build a plumbing company and a buddy and I started a YouTube journey a few years ago (up to 10ksubs now)   I just want to thank you for showing the journey, it’s inspiring. Makes me want to work harder, risk more and dream bigger.  If you want some cool CA hunting content look us up, Caccia Outdoors.   God bless the diesel crew!
Thanks for sharing...i learned more great thing about you guys...cant wait to see were live takes ya...you worked for all you have...and having some fun too...
So do you own your location now or do you still rent your current location? Congrats on sticking with it .
Much respect Brother ,ya kept movin forward not lookin back..Just goes to show drive and determination can go a long ways..Been watching ya for quite some time and hats off to ya and everything ya have achieved 🤘💥👊
See you didn't start with nothing, you had help to get where you are now.
Wassup with that random Chinese thing at building 5 lmao
I would love to have that truck for myself or my son but neither of us could afford to run it lol!
It was great to see the history and the struggle. Makes me feel better about what I’m doing. 🔥
Dude to get back behind a stick.  She is very nice looking, a definite head turner.
This video helps me to keep going in my business, it gets hard when you fail to keep going but seeing the end product of your manifestation of your dreams and the breakdown of your grind to get there is real motivation
Sad that you guys have to click bait
David, I have a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Laredo 4x4 I'd like to get this Jeep setup with bushcraft equipment and to get it lifted, with a winch, fenders, new suspension, wheels and tires. What would you recommend me to do for that year of vehicle?
That's one of the nicest trucks you guys ever built that's one of the nicest trucks you've ever built and I want it
Hard work and dedication pays off bros
What a beautiful stubborn feracious journey you men have been on to create a world renown business! So impressive, so inspiring!! Bravo Bravo! From a little old lady who loves watching in Reno Nevada!❤
You love to fly, and I have your videos....I have a crazy idea and would love to talk. Think safe, Stay Safe!  Cowboy
Fake it till you make it. *intent
Great breakdown of how you all have grown!! Pretty damn cool!!
Thank you guys for everything, we've all been on the journey with ya, and we will continue to be on it with you, wherever it shall lead!!
Love that truck!!!
Thanks for the trip down memory lane.  I'm curious to see the next evolution.  I'll stay tuned.
Dave I was glued to you till the end. Sharing when you started, the constant struggles to live up to the dream you envisioned yourself to be at is all inspiring! If people come to your channel and see all the equipment, toys you have may think you were rich, but sharing your beginning to now, much respect to you and your Crew!! Congratulations on your success! ! 🤙😎
Love that truck!!!
There will time be to reminisce later now is not that time, you are both young men. Enjoy life spend time with your families and do the reminiscing when your in your 70s plus.  Your just  kids!
Awesome story thanks for keeping with it all these years
Don't buy this scam guys. I bought last mess of give away. Signed  up for the redo never got anything! Not even the card to a chance to win. This why they're going stop doing it.
Love the video! Love you guys! Keep up the great work!
From 0 to a million that is awesome!
The globalists warming hoax & their threats to shut down fuel exploration is never going to happen. They will all be in the ground before that happens. Dan LePena shows clearly that climate change is globalist hysteria to steal money & create fear & discord. Don’t fall into their pit of bs
Awesome job brothers
That's awesome can relate just never Finnish the dream
I was wrong, for some reason I thought Dave was a SOB" son of the boss family business handed down. Thanks for making this video. I never like how shop shows on discovery channel showed conflict and cry babies, this is why Im a fan of diesel bro and the crew display brotherhood and leadership.
Awesome trucks I love your shows and my husband loves your Deisel trucks give away❤😂
Did you used to go to the westerner in westvalley a lot , like 8 years ago without a beard?
A true man is never satisfied until he says so. Glad to see that  happiness and hard work has paid off for you.
Great walk down memory lane.  We haven't been watching long as newbies, so it was great for perspective. Really love your Random Acts of Kindness. You are good souls.
About 89% of that was pure bulshit LOL.......
Started watching on discovery, followed to YouTube and its only gotten better.
Long time viewer in Australia. Wish I could enter your competitions
Totally enjoyed this video guys thank you.👍✌
well glad I live in Salt Lake City, i can drive down to your shop and buy gear thanks for all you do for your this great state.
This is a fantastic story. I applaud you guys. Just brilliant. I hope you go on to bigger and better things. The worlds a better place with you guys in it. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
It's funny how long I been watching. And being on disability any truck I would have tried for I didn't have the money in time. Like now 10 days is the 30th I get paid on the third. Good luck hopefully you sell out on merch. As always much love and God bless.

KALICK BAAAAIT
Thank You For Your Video's
Really appreciate your imagination to reality builds keep chasing the dream and make it a reality God bless
USPS small box shipping.  Best thing ever.  With some thought you can fit three of just about anything in one.  You theoretically could ship a 2" x 4" x 6" block of lead in one.
What is that all !   wow what a story.  Good work guys.
Hard work and determination
I clicked on the link and can't see how to enter 😬
Just goes to show that with enough courage and guts, you can do what you love.   When you what you love,  you'll never work a day in your life.   Love your channel.   Stop by in Texas, we'll go full-auto at the range,  :)
I sure hope you guy's are not done!!!!!! Doing what you do. Thank you for showing us how it all started . And I am glad you do what do! And keep doing it !!!!!!!
Happy Birthday to me with that beauty of a trk.
You guys are so inspiring me and my husband (mostly my husband lol) watch every video you put out since we found your channel on YouTube.  We are trying really hard to get on our feet and this video helped us realize to never give up no matter how many times we get set back.  My husband is a carpenter for more then 30 years and worked the oil field now he's doing a different job and enjoying it but his passion is working with his hands making anything he can come up with out of wood.  1836Woodworks. In tx. Lol.  One step at a time but I know we'll get there some day.  Keep up the the great job you'll do.  Love you'll be safe God bless.
33:56 Where in Moab were you at? What trail?
Love it!
This has been quite possibly your most EPIC episode ever! I have only known of this HeavyDSparks you tube channel. I did not know that you also had a Discovery Channel TV show as well. More power to you and may your future be brighter than your past!
Very KOOL story Definitely came a long way
Interesting for sure ! Thanks for sharing !
Awesome story guys, glad to see you make it through all the struggles especially in this world these days, keep her runnin!!
I found y'all at building #5. And you've made me smile through all the MS crap, including my diagnosis, and years after, up until now. I've moved my whole life, from Maine, my home state, then FL till I was 2, then cheap housing in southern California, my start of skateboarding, and I guess my realization that I was a fighter, and a rebel, and I always will be. I don't give up. I fight late stage, and unknown up untill 5 years ago. I'm 42, and my MS began it's destruction starting in my late teens. Dealt with it, and docs couldn't figure out why, untill I found a real one in  NH, about 5 years ago, when everything went sideways, I started to see the truth in people, and I lost everything, 4 times. But I never stopped fighting, and I'm safe, and getting the medical help I've needed, but was too far away from major cities, and the different types of medical help i needed, and finally found. I don't quit. Ever. It's an old school, military, and farmer work/life ethic, and set of morals learned, and built, from a crazy life of over 50 or so moves, from US corner, to Corner, and down the east coast. Thank you for being there with videos to make me smile when life's just a nice big plate of $h*t.  💚🎗️🦙🤘🫠
That truck is awesome .. Makes me miss my days in the Army
31:54  I found an edit error 😂.
This is great!! So fun seeing how y'all got started!!
Love the video!  Keep pushing to that next big thing.....very inspiring!!  Glad you guys are doing well!!
I'm starting my hotshot business with all used equipment... I've got 25k invested on the equipment... Most hotshot drivers buy brand new $125K+ and get in debt that is overwhelming for them... So they go out of business... I'm starting out with used equipment in hopes of within 5 years I can afford all new equipment... My pickup truck will be gas powered instead of diesel... It will work...!!! It's amazing how you guys have grown with all the UPS and downs...!!!!!  Keep doing what you're doing...!!!!
last give away because tax law changed?
i saw a black hawk fly over lagrange KY about a week or 2 ago and i had to get a second look at it to see if it was you haha, love this video, its refreshing to see you can come up from nothing!
43:43 the way Dave Kiley is just Staring at you dude like he really loves how you changed his life that a special moment man
Great Video love the story hard times brings out the best in people cheers ❤️❤️👍👍👍🦘🇦🇺
I heard your story on romans podcast it  is much more in depth on there but it’s interesting how many times you moved and how everything was told with video. Love the content by the way you guys build pretty much trucks I dream of owning and one day will own. Tough rugged work trucks for the working man and that is what a guy needs
Great intro! A 👻 driver shot, perfect!
What a shame I live in Australia. Love you guys, you all make me laugh with all of the antics. I would have to have a lift put in to get inside this truck or actual steps, as I am getting on in life. Dave keep up the dream, we all get knocked down in life, but we have to just get backup again, which you have done many times.keep up the good work.
OMG!!! I would be so honored to own that rig and since I am a patriot Ole glory would be flown.
Very heart warming video. I just might have to enter this one. That truck is beefy. You guys are awesome.
Did I miss something ? Why no more giveaways ? You worked hard for what got, you shtbe proud.
Happy for ya. When the market rolled over in 2008 I hung on until about 2013 then I sold everything I earned my whole life. Well almost it was very tough I tried everything even went back to school in my 50s. I'm very grateful for what I have and I'm happy that things have turned out so well for you happy holidays
hahaha-BORING...lol
At 31:55 what was that? Or foreign language or something
You guys literally live my dream
All i have to say is.  SCREW C.A.R.B.
Good for you! Happy for your success! Just ordered one of your overpriced t shirts! Lol ! Hopefully I win the truck and bring it to Ohio! Great video!
That Was Mind Blowing, & I'm  Really  Glad You Did This Video,  & Talk About Paying  Your Dues, You Did BIG TIME,&  We Can't  Imagine  What's  in Store But Were Sure it Well Be Great & FUN 👍👍👍👍👍
I am disappointed. I would have watched the video anyways, and probably would have enjoyed it, if it weren't for the awful clickbait title. I'm sure the majority of your fans would love to learn about your history, but the clickbait is a real piss off.
Awesome stuff gang, wishing you every success in the future
This was great ive always wanted to no the history of you guys ive watched everything youtube n ur dvds shows u dont need alot of money to create something great keep up the work guys  Im from australia n were jealous of what you guys can do there. one day id love to come over n meet yous
Wow a lot of locations sweat and tears I'm sure.... I'm really happy for you now you have success 👍 love your channel you guys are awesome
You didn't even tell us the big announcements?
Will you still give away trucks??
Good story glad to hear how u all came about well 👍 done
Love this!!!!  GREAT CONTENT!!!
I really  enjoyed watching your story of your business   I admire you guys so much
This was a cool video and very inspiring,  don't ever give up.
Thought this was also leading up to a new compound 🤣
Awesome job you never gave up, hard work an taking chances that could bankrupt you is a scary thing. But you guys made it work, you all deserve the good life as you help so many and never forget where you came from.
I would love that truck and the flag just the way it is
Is the Discovery show being rebooted? I have seen some older episodes they are calling NEw like the Double Diesel VW flip cars.
Crazy the bed you designed is close to one I designed for myself 7 years ago and will never make again because it's mine so I'm gonna try to get this truck for myself so boys let's fight
Glad you found the home.
As a 76 year old I had a hard time getting my head around some of your antics. Watching todays episode explained everything when i thought back to my younger days. Youve come a long way and deserve every last thing you have.  Enjoy your show and now have a huge respect for what you have done.
Sorry DD, that truck being manual just isn't for me.  I couldn't master the M-35 in the USAF.  Not about to learn now.
Thank for your story. It's stories like these I would have needed decades ago so I wouldnt waste 15 years wondering if I should make the jump or not.
Get the shipping issues. Fitting unusual sized  items into normal size packages, absolutely loved  my job, unfortunately cancer got in my way. Nowadays while i recover I have been enjoying your vlogs.
Military green is my favorite truck color.  Nice build.
crazy story, an the   girl stay with ya the hole time ,that something
I wish Canadians could win.  I would so give it to my son in law who is with the military.  You guys are the best we love your show so much.  It’s show in your personalities that you worked hard to get to where you are today. ❤
Love story how guys got started , help get small business off ground my partner bought me out 2011 . Pretty cool think back now all ups and downs, I know you guys be successful no matter what it is! God bless and keep it 💯!
Just saw a skull sticker on postal equipment. No where near Utah…..
i love hearing stories of success from nothing. yall should be very proud of yourselves.
I dont really care for this story because it's less in touch with reality than what people will see it. Most see it as yea you started from the bottom now you're here buttttt you had a couple of friends that REALLY helped you out. Determination and perseverance is great and all but having someone who let's you rent out a space for 500 bucks a month is definitely a big leg up within a business perspective.
yal have came a long way to bring yal self up in this world and proud of yal and god bless and I do like that truck it's very nice truck
Gained a lot of respect after this sorry for any hard words said by me..your the man D!
You guys kick ass... I love watching your vids and enjoy wearing your gear even if I have to pay shipping twice to get it here to New Zealand.. Looking forward to your great step forward.. Cheers guys
Where’d you get the hoodie heavy d very interested 😊
keep up the hard work,,,,,,
Fake it til you make it nice!
It was nice to hear and see your journey from then to now. You guys are awesome.
Love your show and I would  like to ask you both what is your thoughts on AWP.    I know it has shocked us all.
Very interesting story of how how work and pushing through failures will make you American dream come true
Great story, love hearing how someone succesful starts out and progresses through all their trials and tribulations to where they are now. David is definately a go getter and achieved a lot in 10 years! Kudos guys!
Please don't tell me y'all are going start doing ev swaps
Your videos are always awesome to watch! Love your story and how you got to where you are. 💕💕
Very cool. Take notes boys and girls, that is how you do a video!
Seeing that old picture of you guys, actually didn't believe it for a second.
what i wanna know is when the guy said “you’re not who you think you are”. .. hahaha wtf does that even mean!? 😂😂
Who makes that camo jacket on HD?
The new move is they are now ev only techs
This is honestly my favorite VLOG!!! Reason being is I get too understand your struggles and see the growth you have achieved and for you to express it. There's no I wish I could or  I wish I had this or that. You showed the blood sweat and tears with all the hardships the 8 locations you encountered you still found the light shining no matter what circumstance was thrown at you. You've had more pawn moves than I have jobs but hey look where your at I look where I'm at as well compared to the years you shared at what was going on. 8 years strong with the company I work for a lot of growth has happened for me and as well with your life! And career love it👍 awesome video again!!!! I feel the connection in 2 very different scenarios 💪
Great to know that you two have done where most have failed.  Congrats on achieving the American dream. If I wasn't so broke and trying for disability I'd love to buy another hat and hope for the best but it's not in my budget at the moment. So good luck to those that can afford your swag during Joe's inflation.  TTFN
I loved that truck tried so hard to win it you guys make me wanting to keep building my truck keep up the hard work guys
Thanks for sharing that tale.  A lot of people probably see how you spend huge amounts of money now, but don't realize how broke you once were.  Jayman...
WOW again such lies TO enter the CONTEST to WIN the truck,YOU must spend 5 dollars on their WEBSITE to be entered in this so called GIVE AWAY,THAT he JUST FORGOT to mention,SUCH A SCAMMER,just call it what it is.....😎
Love what you guys do. Congratulations on the success. Moving forward an improvement would be to stop using clickbait crap and be real and true like Rory with Trailmater or Matt with Matt’s off road recovery 🤘 good luck 👍
Hard working Americans like my Pop used to say. He only had one leg after his ship was sunk in WWII and never let it stop him. You young men are the true examples of the American Dream.  God bless you all.
Congrats on your success. Hard work and next step strategy worked well together. Outstanding 👍🇺🇸🚜
You guys are AMAZING. Thank you for being down to earth~Love your show. 😁😁
You guys are awesome 🤘
im never going to win this truck so no worries
I'm calling it right now the next step is going to be a diesel-powered spaceship. haha. but a great story of an epic come up.
Inflation finally caught up with you guys
You guys are the nicest people I have ever seen on utube. I've watched you since the beginning. You're also the craziest.  Nice history.

Thank you for bringing us along and motivating some of us to pursue our dreams. Look forward to the next chapter. 👍🏼👏🏼🤜🏼🤛🏼🇺🇸💪🏼🤙🏼
Great video! Could you show the inside of the buildings? Just a tour
You have prove a true principal "Necessity is the mother of all inventions"; "You could do and be anything you want only if you put your mind and hearth to it" and a true friendship 2 good friends threat each other like brothers.
@Heavydsparks man,  after this and the Roman Atwood podcast I have a huge urge to start my own business...HUGE inspiration.
Man I’m so glad you did this video! I just watched the Atwood podcast you did and wanted to hear more of the story! Lol
Loved this video. I was freaked out when you said people were suing you every other day!!! What........what on earth ???  Why? Anyways.......great job and good luck in future ventures.
sooo is this the end of diesel brothers?
you better not stop doing recoveries .... those videos are AWESOME !!!!
The first time I seen yall was that tv show. I had been waiting all wk to watch it and I ended up in the hospital with blood clots in my lungs. I'm going in on Tuesday to get infusion for my kidney disease. I have been really struggling lately to find motivation to keep going outside of my family and trying to provide but it's rough. But watching some of your videos have really kept my spirits high and kept my going to do better. Keep it up and thank you.
So Awesome I found your Channel!!! Found it through Ghost town living! I love this Shit! I've been rebuilding CAT engines for 15 years! Keep these Awesome Vids coming 🍻🍻🍻
Another one of this "It's over.", "I quit.", "This is the end" - clickbaits. Why is there so many YouTubers who's doing this now?
Nothing worth it is ever easy. Thanks for taking us on the journey.
Love all the videos and y'all are freakin awesome. Keep on keeping on. Happy Thanksgiving.
I thought everyone on YouTube just had a really rich daddy??  😄  All kidding aside, I have never doubted or questioned how hard you guys work. This really paints the picture of the real effort and determination that givingupanyone can achieve by not on yourself and your dreams. No matter how off it seems or how far you fall down.
😍👏👏💚💚💚💚👏👏👏👏👏
What an amazing journey. Thanks for sharing your journey with us. I so enjoy your videos
I remember the us 12 valve like it was yesterday
Wow!!!! That was an INCREDIBLE journey.  Congrats on all your hard work!!!! Looking forward to seeing the new, bigger, badder, faster, stronger version!!!!! Till next video, laters...
American Dream.
I've never been a fan of yours from the show. The show was kinda dumb, but let me tell you I've grown to be a fan and have a ton of respect for yall for helping people the way you do.
This is my favorite video that you have made. You've bared your heart and soul for all of us to see. Shotgun says it's his favorite as well. you are a wonderful person and Shotgun and I hold everyone in your company in very high regard. We appreciate all you have done for others and our environment. It's nice to know someone cares about the environment enough to drag all those abandoned vehicles out of where they're lying and dispose of them properly. We also appreciate the fact you are willing to rescue and recover those which everyone refuses to even attempt. You and the rest of the crew have hearts of gold and the passion to help others.Shotgun is the only other person I know who has the heart and compassion you have. I have known Shotgun for 62 of our 66 years. It's a shame Shotgun's health is failing and all of those he has helped through the years couldn't even take him to his radiation treatments. He got so sick from them and is still sick, he worked through 30 of 33 treatments and took less than a week off after finishing treatment 33. I don't know how he does it, after losing nearly 100# in less than a year he still manages to ride his fully dressed Harley Davidson. I truly believe You and your crew are cut from the same cloth as he is. If we both were 30 years younger and in better health we both would love to be part of your crew.
I can't wait for whatever the new is coming you guys are amazing!!!
Way cool.. I know where all those places are!!
Lame
👍 👍 👍 👍
stop the clickbait stuff dude. you have a great thing going and it awesome what you all do. just call it what it is....not telling viewers "It's Over". thanks yall are awesome
i didnt know you and diesel dave were brothers
Cant wait to see whats next..
D I know it takes alot to take us through a low point but this is very inspiring. I have now finally opened my own dealership out of aspirations of being like you. I made my first 2 sales this week so needless to say I thank you and wish you and your family well. keep pushing forward and keep the content coming. I hope anyone that sees this comment that you can do it as well and know that it will be rough in the beginning but in the long run you will be 100% happier in life and will feel more free doing it yourself! Best of luck to everyone and god bless.
It was nice to see the back story of the business and how you never gave up on your dreams. Congrats
What an amazing life lesson in what it takes to live the American dream 🇺🇸🤙
I absolutely love this story,these dudes put in the work fr!!!
That is a lot of moving around.  Good things happen to good people.
I am going to homeless soon and it is hard to think about !!
What a roller coaster ride but you always came back for another run.  Hard work does pay off. Congrats to both of you to make it work.
We wanna show you the struggles. We only started with a small lump sum of $2,000,000 and we were both only making $150,000 a year. I don't know how we did it...times were tough. We had to eat a single steak every night instead of 3. I was only able to spend $200,000 on my marriage so my wife really sacrificed to help me get started.   My man....if you wasn't eating ramen noodles every day to get by...my struggle and your struggle are two different types of struggle lol glad we both came out better on the other side though.
Cool video.  Detroit Loves you guys!! G
from the title of the video i thought it was going to be the last video but i am glad that its not
Amazing video; didn't know I was up for 48mins but fastest 48min I've watched. Too many people see the success but not the hard work and hustle it takes to get there! Happy for your success!
Thanks for sharing.
Great freaking story started watching a little before the pranks at rockwell shop and it’s been awesome to watch
I love the truck it's a dream
Congratulations on your road to success!
Congratulations.. Great Video!!!!! You've  earned it.. Rock on Cowboy
A very nice story, really enjoyed it. You are awesome, keep up the great work.
I love the truck it's the dream
Love that privacy fence diesel.. lmao 🤣
hugely inspiring. well done.
We need your help finding a full size van need to work with a big electric wheelchair my husband and my self are disabled and can not afford much.
I have always wondered 🧐
I need that 24 valve truck for my OFF-GRID property!
Location 7 where he sold his soul u don’t get on tv without being a mason and selling ur soul they worship the evil god
Those flat rate envelopes... We were forcing 2 snowplow feet into the padded flat rate, and most of them made it to their destinations... Fedex One Rate is the way to go now. Better packaging, and cheaper.
I'm in Ireland 🇮🇪, and I've only one thing to say, i love your chanel guys,  i wish I had known about your chanel a few years ago but thanks to matts off road recovery, was when I subscribed to you guys,  LETS go Brandon 🇱🇷
Respect
Thanks for the content. Awesome video and truck.
Can you please help me fix my 2010 X5M. I bought it and the engine blew in one month. It's now been in my driveway for a year because I cant afford to get it fixed? You would probably know just what to do to get it back on the road.
Really enjoyed this "Christmas carol" clip from past to present, looking forward to the future clips 🤩  congratulations on all your successes 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍 well done guys and thank you for the jaw dropping antics and the heartfelt clips you've given 🤝
I would love to get a flatbed, and use it to build an overland to me my dream of traveling to Alaska.  After 12+ years in the military. 8 tours in Iraq,  blown up 2x by IEDs which took my career in the service. And it lift me disabled, multiple injuries, but hopeful for the future.. would love to win the flatbed. I'll buy some merchandise. But as all things, God will work it out as he has pretty much been all my life. Thanks guys for all you do for us Vets
I enjoyed this a lot. It’s sad that it’s the end of an unbelievable era of hardship struggle and amazing trucks,for us as viewers as the outcome. Thank you and I’m super excited for what’s next.
I have a 98 dodge ram 12v Cummins stock
I love that truck, just can't afford to enter.
Appreciate you taking the risks and entertaining us along the way ❤️
The black smoke in the toilet video made me realize how long I have been watching your videos😂.  This was a awesome video, I can’t wait to see what’s in store next.(hopefully some snowmobile content)
It's very cool to see where you guys started from. Congratulations on getting to where you have got to! I look forward to seeing what you all do for the next stage, and I hope you can stay true to your origins. Truely inspirational!
🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely love my DieselDave shirts!   You all are the best!  Blessing’s and Happiness Thanksgiving!!
Spare me.  Shameful
Just some good dude's!
What a great story of your journey through life... Thanks for sharing with the world.
For the algorithm
what is up with the Blackhawk??????????????????
Really enjoy your videos. You and your crew has worked hard to get where you are at and happy for you.
This “Next Chapter” wouldn’t have something to do with Nikola and the pickup truck that never was…would it?
I'd love to win this truck to donate it to Brent Underwood for supply hauls to Cerro Gordo!
Gorgeous truck ..
wrong time of year for us retired guys have big tax on our land and have to buy plates for our car nothing left for Christmas love your videos merry christmas and happy new year we will get by again
Both of you are truly inspiring love watching your shows thank you for inspiring me.
Thats a sweet ride.
Still can't recognize them without beards.
GOD works in mysterious ways...Love you guys...
This shows the ambition of young equals the sky's the limit. Let this be a lesson for younger generation, set your ambitions and go for it.. Don't focus on the particular items \ situations and focus on what you have a vision for.   side note: It all makes sense now..  Dave being a car salesman it makes sense lol he'll sell ice to an eskimo. But he really has a big heart and intentions are good.. ( as seen in several videos )   Hey Dave another huge project idea for people along the Wasatch Front.. Some kind of huge underground bunker incase something is to happen. ( 72 hour notice etc.. ) and people like my self can pay for a spot in that bunker. idk  Or maybe individual bunkers out in the desert. I would buy one for sure.. away from the city.. idk
Awesome!
Way to work through your struggles.  Great job guys!
i hope i win
I wish you were close to SC and could help me find my amazing daughter her first car. I'm disabled from an injury that happened when I was in law enforcement. She had a slow start when it came to driving because I've been dealing with tons of health issues. She's been working really hard and is saving up for a car. She and my son have sacrificed so much to help me. They really are amazing kids. I don't know anything about cars nor do I know anyone in this area that I should trust to help me find her something dependable. I don't want her breaking down at night when she gets off late from work. It's just not safe in today's world. My son's car is an ok car and has been really dependable. None of us can afford a new car so if anyone has any advice on what to look for or where to start in a car for my daughter, that would be so appreciated!  Seeing how far you've come is so inspiring!! The saying that hard work pays off is so true! I really enjoy your videos. You guys rock!
The NO beard look great before! Should have shaved before this video.😎😊 Going back Memory Lane❣️ Diesel😍 gas ⛽️ memories lane🤩 Never forget the start is always because of a significance other aka girlfriend /wife💞 Last the great Team, strangers, Loyal Friends, and FANS. So many cool and awesome 1 of 1 built for all purpose vehicles. Very memorable to me, love it!🥰 This video was cool for me too. I love all the cool vehicles modifications! I remember those moment when you were going to another building. Your facial expressions showed you didn't like it. I remember it but I didn't really know why. 3/4 way of this video you explained. I'm super excited and happy for Diesel Brother dream to come true. Discovery Channel was cool to host the show 😀
Inspirational as shit
Hard work pays off!! 💪
It just shows that if there is a will, there's a way; Hard work and perseverance got you where you guys are today. Nobody said it was going to be easy. Your determination, is unmatched . Congrats; Well done guys 👍👍👍.
The story was remarkable, the journey is in its self a learning process, hey Dave here is something that can help.you.mive up even better and maybe faster I want to do invest in your stock/ your company?
I was thinking Dave is happy you finally got to location # 8 with as high as that truck is diesel Dave doesn't have  to jump in and out of the truck anymore  🤷🏼‍♀️
Thank you I enjoy your videos very much and please keep it going.
Where is your grey giant stretched Dodge that you had during the show? Where is it today? Still around?
LETS GO BRANDON !!!!
I'm excited to see the new theme
Most enlightening. I must confess not knowing what you guys history consisted of, thought you may have been born with a silver spoon in your mouths. To see the building blocks brings back memories from my own journey which at 70 is nearing completion. This is a testament to hustle and hard work. Failures along the way can actually be beneficial if the lesson taught is a lesson learned. As one door closes another opens.  I laughed on the smoke bomb in the head snippet. I remember that video. In fact it might have been what prompted me to continue following. Like many of the folks here, it brought back some of the craziest most fun times in my own life. Those are the memories and the friends that make life livable in spite of the challenges along the way. One of the casualties of modern days are those who are not familiar with hard work  and incrementally gaining ground on the American Dream. They seem to feel everything should just be handed them without effort or having to start at the bottom, gain experience, and work their way up.  I gained a lot of respect for your character today.  Good luck in your new endeavor. From a fellow Utahan finally taking some much deserved time to attempt the slower pace of retirement. (Still have those limousines with  LT1s in him just waiting on some gumbo monster mudders.) I shall now go check out the warez and win me a truck. (lol)
What an awesome journey
.... Legends....
Such fantastic people! Your generosity is unheard-of. Your crew and families deserve all of the success achieved! Congratulations, and never stop. Thank you.
I started watching you gyys back when your angels saved diesel Dave's life when he feel off that 1000 ft cliff.   Since then y'all been angels for a lot of people . From boats on lakes drying up to the Ghost towns. It's awesome seeing the motel slowly  coming back to life. And then it's these beasts of equipment y'all create are amazing in there own. I'd love to own a beast of a vehicle like you create but my hoopty is all I can afford.  Also with Joe in our white house and diesel fuel ordeal scares me. Well TTFN back to your past. Aka video. Actually at 23:35 reminded me when I started watching you was the Lamborghini I was like what the heck?  When you put the track wheels on it. Laughed butt off.
Beautiful Truck!!  Thanks for sharing your story! ❤️
Are you done with YouTube
Thanks guys, you make amazing content and hope things keep going well for you :)
Hi Big D 👩 😂 🤣 😆 Big D sleeping on a trailer bed, From: Scranton, Pennsylvania 👩
The fact that you admit the hodgepodge is a big step lol. Well done video
We need a video about Dave’s adventures in China 😂
I cannot but feel like there is really something very sad happening here.  You gave us a little hope at the end, but the tone of this video still has a lot of dread tied to it. Hope everyone is OK, and hope to see more great videos in the near future!
Dave fantastic love watching .wayne in uk (your journey) brill 👍keep it up .
I have been buying and selling classic cars and any good vehicle I can make money on for the past 5 years now I’m going on 22 I sold all the inventory I had just bought a new property I’m developing a huge shop and going big wish me luck up here in Alberta Canada haha!!
Ty for the journey share, i always wondered.
How do I enter
Omg look how cute you two were.❤
I always thought Diesel dave was a partner hence the moniker DieselBrothers? So he is just an employee after all these years or is he a partner in all this?  He's like the Free Soul the exact opposite of HeavyD. He seems like he doesn't care about possessions or money, helicopters, airplanes, or toys. He's just chill to be doing something constructive.
Dude that truck is SICK! I need a new sweatshirt I'm entering for that build for sure! Your merch is awesome!
love hearing yalls story, much deserved success
I can't afford to buy anything to enter😭 I want that truck so bad😫
Is my dad said hard work always pays off hard work always shows results
Hey guys that’s great you are changing directions, but is it possible that the special sticker boxes can be taken care of? I’m in for 2 that we’re never replaced
Lol "Buckle up so we don't get the seat belt haters"
Love the videos, much respect for you and your team! Enjoy the holidays.
"struggle" .... yeah idk about any struggle but whatever makes you feel better lol
There's nothing like driving a stick shift, tell you h'what
You had a dream and you wouldn't let nothing stand in the way good going Heavy D ♥️🤗  A lot of hard work and mistakes but you came out of it and you did something that you could be proud of and you never gave up !!!!!👏
Congratulations Well done.
Are you actually giving away the truck? Or am I going to end up with another football card? For $75. Or 5 worth hours of manual labor worth of money.
Are you guys still printing your own shirts? Curious if you were printing manually or had an auto....I would guess an auto? I only ask since I'm a screenprinter....thought it was cool you had your base business and then decided to have a little print shop to do your gear.
Finally......I've been waiting for this forever.....they're finally stepping up to the next level......Yep!  They're finally going to start doing helicopter giveaways😉😆
Huh,Dave and Dave use to be sort of good looking,and alot less hairy,alot!!!
I love how the team has virtually stayed the same with growth. These guys know how to both earn and pay respect and make and retain friendships.
You have a powder coating facility? Are you looking for any painter's, been in the metal finishing industry for almost 20 years..I want that truck hahaha,how do i get in...??? This video was dope,looks like you came along way,glad your at where you wanna be,and I'm sure you're not gonna stop for sure,keep up the great work brotha 🙌💯👌👍👍
You guys are the bomb!
I tried making an account but the website I think might be getting to much traffic right now with the video being so recently posted wasn't able to get the price for being a member but still purchased for enteries anyway!! Good luck everyone!!
How do I enter
Awesome story! Wish successful people would do more like this to show the struggles and trials they went throught. Everyone thats aiming to do the sane will see yal went through the same and how fsr you came just from sheer dedication
Are all the rescues over?  Clueless in Kentucky! Is the show over now??🫣🤔❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

G'day guys. What an awesome video. One of my favourite things to watch is history. Glad to see you baring All.
@31:54 - What happened there?
I’m thankful for all of your episodes, I have watched many. I’m disabled and blessed that I’m able to celebrate this with you
Heavy D, you're inspiration and the world is truly blessed to have you in it!!
What did I miss?! I don’t understand what’s going on??😮
Down to earth hard working dreamers. Love the history came from the same theory . I  love the show
When was it that you let Hands off the floor board?
What did the truck originally look like?
how are you not related to ryan taylor with those younger photos lol
Nice to see and follow your success good luck in the future thanks for sharing
God Bless Your Care of Others! 👍 👍 👍
You do Utah proud brother!
Bullshit masons u sold ur soul
Most people would've gave up.. much respect!!!!! 🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿
heavy D i almost had tears in my eyes listening to your struggles, becuase they reminded me of my own. Life is hard, and you get out of it what you put into it, and its showing big time with your biz.  Another great video. oh i like the recovering stolen truck video, you guys were great at acting, and the reason most didn't like it is because they have the intellect of a fourth grader. hahaha   peace brother.
Well I LOVE YOUR STORY, GUYS.  ❤  I think you should run for Mayor & I want to move there from here in Northern Arizona sun I win this Diesel & buy a travel railed &'come work for you! They used to call me a Heavy Hitter when I basically started from answering phones to a highly technical portion that company based their profit on as well as their clients relied on for profitable biz & ran shipping & receiving. Maybe I can just help run a new store or just cashier for you. ❤
Love that you guy's are still humble and it shows in what you keep doing!
Absolutely PHENOMENAL video @HeavyD… I’ve always wondered how y’all’s journey went. I’ve watched since day 1.. I loved all those old videos of pranks and things y’all used to do. You all are truly blessed!! Wouldn’t do me any good to win this truck.. I’ve got 2 now that I can’t keep running.. lol.. ole Murphy loves riding shotgun with me.. I can’t wait to see what’s next. I think I have an idea.. but we’ll see soon enough I guess!! Happy Thanksgiving to you all and your families and may God keep blessing each of you!! Such a great team!!
The kings of clickbait... we're going to tell you and show you the new stuff we're doing and then as every damn video,  NOTHING BUT A FREAKING SALES PITCH!!!!!! So done with this channel.
Hell of a story...   Grats on the success.    Sounds like you grinded like hell for it.
I remember hauling trucks for you back from Cali , when you had that busted up high side at the property. Super proud of ya ! 👊🏻 keep up the hard work .     Car hauling life SLC 👊🏻🥃

Hey big man hey uncle David lol jk need a truck please so I can get started on my own business so I can help out my mom and family and friends like I said u can come get my truck just needs a new or a rebuild engine I have a nice 2003 f150 4wd sport with 130.089 miles on it just don't have the money or time for it were I live u can't work on your vehicle I hate to sell it bc I love it but it's just sitting there so if u can help me out I'll sure would love it thank u
I love the story.  I love watching you guys pulling those trucks and cars were they went off a cliff. Are when y’all doing things in the snow. I just love watching you guys doing things like you do with helping people. 😅😅😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤ can’t wait till the next one comes out. So please be safe and careful Y’all are always in my prayers.
What a  awesome  story to tell  I bet alot  of people  think  that  you had money  to burn  fr the  get go but  just  goes to show  with  a good  mind set and determination you can do anything  👍 💪 🙌
interesting
loved the history - bit bummed that I can't enter for the truck (no shipping to my part of the world)
Watching this, I saw the red school bus conversion, and realized that it solved the question of what the bus-looking vehicle on the Ritchie Brothers lot (Las Vegas, I think) was.  I think that's where your bus ended up, or someone copied it and THEIR bus is there for an upcoming sale.  I was looking at other equipment, and thought this was quite a weird thing to be mixed in with the dirt movers.
To many ads I can’t even watch the video
And Diesel Dave’s Man-Crib trailer bed… 😂
This truck is very crazy, insane, all the best. Like everything you do. Show! Best of all, it fits in my garage. Dreaming is part of this life! Nobles Heavy D and Diesel Dave, I'm a fan forever! 💪💪💪
"tHiS iSnT gOnNa bE A sAlEs PiTcH vIDeO!!!"  Proceeds to do 2 5 minute sales pitches in 48 minutes
I know what’s it like to build a dream from scratch and work hard to keep it I have a small custom farming operation and it’s hard to keep it running. Great job taking it to the top some day I be there
Do you ship to South africa also
Fun video
great story love you're journey.
I just think you all are so awesome.. love watching all your videos
Great to see how far you have come, just out of curiosity have you spoken to Jarred?
I like your videos on the recovery operations. You should build a 6.0 ford F350srw you could make that 6liter run like a whipped dog
Nice video  keep it coming
Wish I can get that truck , for are beaches recovering team , I tow cars off are beaches non profit
The contrast between this and the previous "stolen" truck video is a smart move.  People like sincerity, or at least the perception of sincerity. Good luck with this format change, whatever that entails.
Heavy D and Diesel Dave two amazing friends. Your story of how you guys started out is pretty Awesome. Love that 3 gen truck pretty bad ass.  Keep up the great work. I want to take my truck to you guys to modify it when I get some more money.
Amazing, and you did it all without any FEDERAL LOANS!
I work in front of that 6th location !!!!
When you said it was a stick shift, I'd was buying some merchandise!!
I really enjoy your YouTube more than the discovery show honestly seems way more real
I only discovered your channel about 6 months ago but I've watched a ton of videos in that time, I'm always awestruck at what you achieve and at your generosity and how humble you all are. Seeing the journey that led to where you are now, the struggles you've faced along the way that you've always bounced right back from has been incredible, thank you so much for sharing it with us. You're all such genuine great people with such big hearts, To see the machines that you build, the rescues you do, the lengths you go to in order to help people in need is nothing short of amazing. You should all feel so proud and accomplished, and I'm sure that you all do. Keep up the great work guys, you're all amazing!  Have you ever considered a side-hustle as a shop mover? 😂
Congratulations you all. I can fill your pain.
Young men working hard and doing whatever it takes to make it work! Hopefully someone can watch this and know that with a little sweat and tears you can make your dreams come true! GB everyone!
I appreciate the history young man , you guys are the best !!!!
Wonderful video. I appreciate learning your history and the struggles of the past.  I understand what it takes to keep going. I look forward to all your future videos.  Thanks again.
It’s always been the MegaRam Runner for me
💯💪💪💪👊
I wish I could afford to buy some thing but the only way I can show support for this great channel and all the awesome people in the videos is watching, sharing and liking all the videos.
Hellye brother's
really enjoyed learning about your background/history and how you came to be....
You are a good inspiration to people whose touched by your struggles and ability to never give up on your dreams
Great looking truck but I am too big for your clothing.
i remember the field behind rockwell where we played airsoft with tactical airsoft then they closed the field and built more buildings back there that was a fun place to go
THATS HORSE SHIT! PLEASE DONT SAY DIESEL BROTHERS IS OVER!!
GOOD LUCK BOYS
Just got my first diesel, it can't be over, I plan on driving west and possibly meeting you guys or seeing your operations.
Love this shows you never gave up on your dreams bother ☺️☺️☺️☺️
Have been in some ups and downs and you guys have helped me in the dark downs moment so thank you guys for that:)
??
You do monster jam
I honestly had no idea you all had a TV show!!! lol Watching season 1 right now.
I'm in the early stages fighting tooth and nail rn.I used too just want a opportunity now I create my own opportunities.
This is clickbait BS. If you aren't quitting, don't intentionally mislead people by titling your video like this. If you are quitting, that should be the very first thing you say in this almost hour-long video.
Thanks for keeping it real I’m glad you guys are able to share something so life changing for you and frankly everyone who experienced your life changing event…. Thank you
This is what I wanted to do for my job! 40 years ago, I ended up just doing a few builds, I ended up selling at no profit  :(  My favourite was a GMC Step Side pickup with 42" tires off an 18 wheeler (I welded 1/2" plate steel in 20" split rims)  and a custom transmission set up with 3 stick shifters,  23 forward speeds and 13 reverse :)   A
The true American dream, your are living it, good on ya Bro.
In-video ads every 4 minutes: i just cant do it, guys. Im out.
I read that Diesel Dave was part owner in the company. I would have liked to see how that came about. Is he an employee or are you business partners? Other than that, great video!
You guys are the epitome of why AMERICA is so great. CHEERS to you guys on the next big dream.
Love your videos.  We need a car, but are both disabled, so don’t do trucks. Yesterday we watched the podcast y’all were on, but I can’t remember whose!  However, loved listening to much of your lives’ stories!
I was in middle school when I subscribed then I got hooked on diesel Brothers and it was all history from there I been here since near the beginning of then starting the online stuff
Interested how to apply
I sold cars for over 16 years, so I have some knowledge of what you went through. This is a tough business to start and become successful in, so congratulations, you guys earned it.
I think I saw my first video of you guys in 2014 right before the TV show. I have been a fan ever since. Great to have been able to see the progression to where you are now. Thanks for an awesome journey.
Very cool.
31:57.
"Seatbelt haters"
Love this! THIS is the American dream! Not having things given to you, but the opportunity to turn dreams into a lifestyle! Good things come to those that are willing to work hard and serve others!! You guys deserve the great things you get to enjoy because of your hard work!
I'm in the middle of a long hard 25-year journey of failed businesses and just can't stop chasing the dreams and goals.  I'll NEVER give up.  It's stories like the Diesel Brothers here that put more logs on my fire and keep inspiring me to keep on going! F__ing love you guys!
What happened to y’all TikTok account
Hell yea brothers! Thanks for everything y'all do and good luck on the future!  I would love that truck, my half ton is getting the shit kicked out of it on my ranch! Hats off to whomever wins that beauty.
Hi, Dave  bloody hell, you guys looked , so different,  clean shaved, 🥸🥸🥸
That’s one beautiful truck. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
And that's how American 🇺🇸 dreams are made 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Dave and Dave this was a lot of fun to watch. It's the semi-typical American story, someone wants to do their own thing, learns hard lessons, gets back up and eventually makes it.  Thanks again.
It is soo bloody awesome to get to see some the the history behind of where you ended up today. Since this is the internet etc, a lot of people would make some wild assumptions that it came from 'old money' or the like.  Nice to see that some f#$%ing hard work and a decent amount of elbow grease can reap rewards. Thanks for giving a rare insight/look. 🖤🤍🖤
Love it watching as I am cutting Parts out on the plasma table. Dreaming big this is America baby!!! got to start somewhere.
That’s where you got the winching ability using winches and snatch blocks reefing them vehicles out of your 4th location.
that vlog was great thanks for telling us your story.
Nice awesome.. inspiring 😍
Incredible and I would hope my story has such and end! Will be watching for the transition!! Eyes open, no fear, be safe!
Very cool!!
Keep up the Hustle when u slow down or get complacent it has a way of kicking you in the rear love the video
Heavy D, crazy sick camo jacket!  Who makes it, where can you get it?
wow nice story
Great story! As a small business owner I can relate.  Almost had to call it quits this year after getting rear ended by a semi while delivering to SLC. Put us all the way back but not out. Fighting everyday twice as hard to regain what was lost. Love what y’all do!  Thanks for the reminder that it is possible!
So basically poor people who dont have money won't be able to enter
Came along way congrats wished I can win it be a honor
Great video
I think the best part of your videos/Journey is the fact that you guys are such good friends. I have a friend like that but where 1500 miles apart. We try to hook up but it’s tough. It’s one of those relationships that it may be 5 years between seeing him,but we are good. Good friends are everything.
Enjoyed that..allways wandered where u cam from as i didnt see early series of diesel brothers..may be odd show..but love it and cant wait for next season :-) happy days.
Please tell me your not quitting I love watching your shows on here your an inspiration I used to love watching awp but that got messed up keep up the good work your doing
Nice to see your business progression. It amazes me how some people can do this. One thing they seem to have in common is friends and family that give them a break of some sort. In kind is common.  You're fortunate to have had that. I did notice your strong drive to keep making it better. I liked how you pointed out so called failures some of which proved to be a success in disguise.
Great life y'all have had diesel bros. We all have a story I rode a bus from w.v to g.a in 2016 with nothing to stay with a friend in the air force that told me with my skills painting cars I could make a lot of money an at that time I was trying to battle addiction. It's crazy cause he paid for my bus ticket I was broke. I'm watching this video looking around at how far I've come an was finally able to not get my dream truck that's a dodge but an 03 powerstroke that needs a oil cooler but one day it'll be done. 6 years clean an I have money to buy breakfast when I wake up every morning. Life is what you make of it
😢 Would have been nice to have some more of your merch. Been a fan from the beginning. To bad everything is sold out. 😢 You guys are great. Love everything you do.  When you get your g700 I want a ride!   😊. Keep up the great, caring things you do.
Fakest channel out there. J.U.N.K
Hard work & determination can make anything happen. Good on you guys. You give back all the time. Billy J.... Queensland, Australia.
Bud. Did you ever consider. The helping hand of the man upstairs? From what I have seen. You have an awful lot of angelic help.
Hard work pays off
You guys are Amazing, your videos are inspiring! Keep up the fight & God bless !!!
Good vid boys 🤘
You guy's did a fantastic job. Proud of you guy's... This video was very moving and inspirational. Thank you diesel brothers.👍
Congratulations on our your progress you are a inspiration I hope that the people that need this push find this video this great country was built on the idea of the American dream I hope no one ever forgets it GOD BLESS YOU and all you have done for people and this country
That's some cool stuff! I own a couple of Rockwell watches.
Love watching your shows but I live in pa.    There is no way you could even give that truck away to any one in pa.   You guys cut the frame , put it up to the moon . You guys follow no rules . The tires are too big ,stick out past the fenders.    Oh I think they look cool but I know if by chance I’d ever win one.   I could never drive it in pa.    Keep building them Dave.   Love watching your shows I’m a subscriber but in all reality. NO one in pa. Would ever win.    Dan
The struggle is real.. Your grind has paid off. WELL DONE Gents!  But you still can’t fly 🤪
I'm a 60 year old Nana.  I would proudly drive that truck. ❤
Great story boys, had no idea you all worked that hard. Watching you now for about a year, kinda thought you all came from money. Very glad to see that you worked your way up from the bottom 🤠. My hat off to you all. Very proud to say I know who you are an where you came from. Can't wait to see where you take us.
Really fun video
This made me cry. The struggles to be a successful business owner is hard..very hard. You never gave up and that is what the American Dream is all about. Congrats to you!

Sorry to say; but this is SOOOOO much better than the TV show... Diesel Brothers is cool, but this is real and this is heartfelt.
Those naked baby faces!😉 I love the truck! Especially with our beautiful flag flying proudly behind it! 🇺🇸 From a Veteran, thank you!
Really I just started bros..💀😨
This is a great show. Thank you for sharing with us. Time to shop! ( hope there is 3X's in medium sized boxes)
used car salesmen lied to a property owner? SAY IT AIN'T SO!
Enjoyed the travel back in time from success through the intricacies of tough times, good times, hard work and God's righteous right hand as the humble are rewarded for their strive!
You both look much better without the Beards! Click Bait but a great story of perseverance.  Well done Gentlemen.  You have big hearts and great friends.
Well done you two
Your living my dream, I should of tried it sooner.I love that you never gave up.
I finally found my 1990's bronco, Now I been hunting for the parts missing the last couple months. But I am afraid because I know nothing about mechanics, yet I am building a car shop. This video is like a sign from heaven telling me STOP BEING AFRIAD OF LIFE, n_n for sure It will be just as hard as it was finding a 32 years car, but If I was able to drive home across 2 states with a broken transmission 2 hours of sleep and never drove a land boat before... I'll figure out how to run a garage somehow.   (In case you wonder, replacing transmission and transmission mount, all engine gaskets, engine mounts, the whole electrical harness, probably all the bushings, but it only has 89k on a 351w, and the interior is pristine.)
When you first started out, what was your wife doing? Was she working and paying the household bills? Was she supportive, or did she doubt you?
I'm going to say it again this country needs more people like you guys. You built something from nothing into something awesome by hard work and never giving up!!
Hard work does pay off happy for you guys great content.
Last Diesel???  I hope your not going "woke" and start with some shyt Green Energy Vehicles
Thank you Dave. Yours is an inspiring story and I'm sure seeing your success from humble beginnings will help many others realize their dreams. Well done.
Loved this video! Thank you for sharing your story with all of us. We all have to start somewhere and that's with a dream. Anything is possible with a vision and hard work or not giving up. Love all your videos. Y'all have such big hearts and are always helping others. God has blessed y'all just for being who you are. Keep up what you love doing. ❤️
you were a good looking guy when you were first married. the face hair really messed it up.
🇺🇸❤️✌️
Wow I really enjoyed this video God bless you guys for sharing this and keep up your great videos!!✌️🇺🇲
thanks for your time by doing this for us i think its good for you/us to know more about ourself and talk about everything
WHAT a journey....hard work & hustle. Loved your story.
Another really swell video. What a long strange trip it's been. Truly a testament to the tenacity of the American Dream. Good job fellows. Really well done.
You two are really good looking men. It makes no sense that you hide under those awful beards.  Well done on your success and good luck on future endeavors.
One of my favorite video yet!!!
Good heart, solid mind, i had no idea about your life's progression
Take care lads and I hope another era comes from your content I love it all. I am just some weirdo with similar dreams from Europe and willing to do the same as you all have.
Love the conversion at 23:11 with the Top Kick/Kodiak mixed with the Savanna/Express!!!
That dodge is so sexy
I'd love to know what DD's parents thought of his living arrangements for all that time! 😂
Awe look how cute you two were what happened 😂 just kidding You men are awesome keep doing you Sending lots of love and respect ❤️
Love you guys!
Its nice to hear others stories, as a business owner i have mine too. Nice to see how far you came. We all have mentors that have helped us, now its our job to mentor others.
Pretty cool story. I started following you guys with the US 12 Valve. I had #69 of the limited edition Black Smoke shirt. Always enjoy the content and really like how you can keep it real. Keep up the good work fellas.
Great content…..👍
What happened to the auto repair guys from the beginning?
The symbolism of starting with that truck and riding around in it visiting your old places and ending with it is deff a full circle moment thats awesome!!! Cant wait to see what the future holds!
driving on me road
Don't be fucking freaking me out dude, I thought you were losing your channel or some crazy shit
Great story. where's the cake and ice cream? Whatcha expect? I'm old as dirt, and have a sweet tooth. Loved the Story of your beginnings, and Glad you made it all work! Congratulations to you all!
i am really proud of you guys , you've come a long ways in just a little time. Your the proof that you can make it starting from almost nothing with hard wok and preference . hope the future gets you even farther.
Nearing the end of a 13,000-mile trip around the U. S. in 2016 we were pulling our 26' RV down a street when two pickups pulled out next to us.  I immediately recognized the drivers as the Diesel Brothers as their pickups pulled away from us blowing tons of black smoke out of the stacks.  I know that black smoke was one of your future problems, but it was impressive and a memory of part of our trip.  This episode was your story, and it is the story of many, many businesses throughout time.
They are awsome they offered me 2 trucks and turned them down lol oh well
Wow! So enjoyed your video from the beginning, transitioning to now.  My heart is excited each time you bring a new video because of your hearts to help others in the process.  Thank you
I'm just glad the big announcement didn't involve gay love.
I love hearing stories from successful entrepreneurs!  Great to learn of your (12+ year) overnight success!
What a journey.Thank you for sharing.Stay humble//Amazing work.Almost Everyone deserves a friend like Dave and Dave.Very happy for You All.Tons of hard work ,great  minds and good attitudes.
Wow, this is so amazing. The years I have watched these guys grow. It's been incredible and inspiring. I feel like I know them, and yet have never met them. Truly amazing. Great job and amazing work.
You guys are an inspiration!
If that truck is a Grandpa truck, then my trucks are Great Grandpa trucks. I never really got into diesel trucks because I grew up building trucks in the 70's and 80's when big block gas engines was what people used for big truck power. There never was a decent diesel truck until Dodge started putting Cummins engines in their trucks back in about 1990. The truck I have now is a 1991 V3500 last year square body Crew Cab with 454/4L80E/NP205/Dana-60/Corp 14-Bolt.
I really enjoyed this video. I have a small car dealership in Utah I’ve had for a few years. I rent a small unit in an industrial park and often times it’s embarrassing to show cars there because it’s not where you find the typical car dealer! It’s been great though and I’m very blessed and we’ve had success! This video has motivated me to approach a business about a place on Main Street I know will be available, thanks for the motivation on moving up in a property sense for my business!
WOW! I’ve always wondered how you got started. Thanks
So good to see how far you both, from literally nothing to now a force to behold. ❤️ Australia 🇦🇺
Guys, Having grown up in Woods Cross and being gone from the area for 20 years, It was extremely refreshing to see a lot of places I remember. Your first place was previously known as CL's bodyoworks. I worked there in '88. It's not very often I see anything about my home town in line. It was great to hear your story and see places I remember. Great job with your future. I've enjoyed your adventures so far and can't wait to see the next chapter.  Good luck to you all!
I love the quick story. Cause I know there's so much missing to the story. I love to see a plan come together, even better when it comes together its better than the dream.
Hey guys thanks for sharing this, it really is the American dream work hard go after your goal. Happy for you God bless
I discovered you on the Discovery Network. So nice to see you guys are still around.
I started on my own at 15 yrs young and slept in other people's cars living on the streets. Luckily I survived and was taken under the wings of a group of 6 veterans that taught me about life and how to survive. Now at 53 and raised 4 kids all grown living in a section of a national forest and loving life. It's great to see others who never gave up and living their life on their terms and doing good. Hang tough and thanks for sharing your experiences. God bless
Seatbelt saved my life when a drunk ran a red and changed my life forever .
Apparently you guys are right wingers. Mormons usually are. Happy to no longer be a brainwashed, indoctrinated member of the Mormon cult. Being an ex-Mormon progressive liberal atheist serves me well.
It takes years of hard work. Extremely good friends and family. Some more hard work. A bit of luck and more work with a bit of play time. You then become a overnight sensation. God bless you and your family. I can hardly wait for more black hawk stuff.
Dave, this story is awesome. One of these days I'm going to find sparks motors. And visit and talk with you. When I was a young lad, I spent my summers in SLC at my grand parents. I was watching roman Atwood interview with you. And you made a statement about your family tree I found to be curious to me. As it turns out . There's a possibility we're related in some fashion. I'd really enjoy a conversation someday to see where that might lead. I have relatives all over the state of Utah, and also a good portion of Wyoming. I live in PNW currently and have lived here for several decades. I'm retirement age now, and making decisions to facilitate my end of life, you know my bucket list. And just one of the things on that list is meet and talk to you. I'll give you the heads up before I head out that way. I can't wait. Great channel, great content. God bless, be safe.
Congratulations guy. You deserve all the success
Thank you for an Incredible look at The American Dream !   Rags to Riches ❤️
Always thought (mb even messaged it here) that Diesel would be a good model. I didn't know until today that he was modelling your merch!
You stuck with it guys, good for you! Happy for you!
Geez! Give me a heart attack. The title of the video made me think you're ending the channel.
did you get a mic? you should.
Hell of a raid to success my friend, you guys are amazing
Fake it till you make it. Way to go guys!
Watching this and realizing I am wearing my DP " Work Hard stay Humble " shirt it hits me right in the feel goods. Thank you all for sharing a great story of how it all began.
Love watching y'all guys y'all are awesome thanks for everything y'all do
What a story!!  Seriously, I have changed my my favorite cooking and home decorating videos. Y ahora disfruto cada uno de sus videos.
Great to hear you story finally Dave. Congrats diesel Brother. Keep it up.
Great video guys , I really enjoyed your journey and everything you’ve done for others along the way. I’m sure based on the new direction of recovery and as you get acclimated to the Huey you bought there will be some great times ahead.
Epa is bad boys when diesel Brothers stop building diesels lol what a shame
Living in Philippines, how do I get entered into truck drawing???
As my welder instructor once said, grinder and some paint, will make you the welder you ain’t.
Truck is smokin 🔥
Wow you guys look so much better without beards in my opinion.ex military
wow struggle is real
How can you tell if someone is having a difficult life? Apparently they air their dirty laundry on the internet with their hands out.
That was worth watching how successful you and Dave have become 👍🥰
What happened to all the 250,000 sub giveaways all the way to 10 million
So I download the app, buy something from you, now I don't see how to enter to win the truck?
Much respect for you all. U all are genuine good people I'd love to meet one day. And nothing but the best for each of u
The dream truck nuff said
That first throwback photo is so precious.   It really shows how far back you two go.  Your hard work and friendship is inspiring.
cliff notes?
You guys are extremely generous and give so much back to people. You really inspire me and make hold hope out for humanity. Thank you.
This video is so awesome man, hearing some of your trials and tribulations as you move from place to place is a perfect representation of hard work pays off. Cheers bois
You guys are great. Heavy D an Heavy Diesel Dave. An I love you showing how you guys started and what you have become 💯
Awesome journey !
Scam artist!!!! Still never got my power boxes I payed for. Filed with States attorney general office!!! Scammers!!!!
I started heavy haul in the 80s till 94 when I blew my knees out moving and 824 RT Dozer. Thank you for all the great memories that you brought back to me! Murray’s Cozads and 5,7,9 and 10 axel moves, Powermonger
#1 u-tube channel for the people that want to be inspired by these guys life struggle and generosity much love guys. ☕❤️💯
WOW! So awesome to see how far you both came! Awesome Job!!! God Bless You Both & Your Families ❤😎🙏🇺🇸
The US trucks are really beautiful. I have a 94 f350 dually that I've been slaving over the last couple months. It has the 7.3 idi paired to an e40d, but I'm on the hunt for a ZF5 5 speed to swap into it. These e40d autos are really finicky.
@D. Bros - "PERSEVERANCE" should be the name of the last give away truck of that type, ultimately being at this point The Truck that came to fruition and culminated as a result of all the failures, progress, and success you experienced during your journey up to this point that enabled you to envision, create, and build a jewel of perfection.
would be cool to see some nice Electric monsters or something with Cummins like their  Nitrogen ICE that they have been testing haha anyways im exited to see what comes next always love the vids you guys put out and it was nice to see a glimpse in the past.
I watch your videos since you got on Youtube and even Discovery. Great journey and good memories.
thank you for the tour of the area I am in for a few more weeks :)
Thanks guys for sharing that that was hella cool to show how everything you guys got you earn, you earn it with blood and sweat love it thank you
It's kinda weird being here since before 100k!! CONGRATULATIONS ON EVERYTHING BOYS!! GODSPEED!!
The next chapter I suspect will be the ultimate off road EV builds!?
Good Souls
Dont scare us like that damn
Can you guys give stuff to your fans that don't buy stuff i would appreciate it 😊
Good video. Nice truck
This is amazing!! Love it!!
I own a 98.5 Dodge 2500 5.9L 4x4 in the 24v short bed, quad cab. She’s a beast! But down right now. Needs a complete suspension rebuild and new hub. New computer, but her motor is just as tight as the day I bought her,and I bought her used with 100k on her in 03. I will keep putting her back together, till I just can’t anymore. Her and my 1999 F-350 7.3L SD/PS 4x4 crew cab, long bed, dually. Both my dream trucks and babies. Not the mechanic they need, but I do what I can.
Your story and seeing how you have affected the world is just damn inspiring.
Dave Sparks I could almost have guessed your history of starting out with almost nothing losing everything and starting again because only someone who has had nothing could be as generous as you are ! Congratulations you and your team are very special people
Just started watching. This will answer some of my questions. I do hope you create a build video of that truck.   Love the retro photos! You are a great example of how thinking big can pay off... with enough work and persistence.
So sweet..yet so scary(no beards).. you all deserve what you have worked for! Keep on, keeping on!!
HARD WORK, WILL GET YOU EVERYTHING... THANKS GUYS
Love the story of how you came to be. I was doing essentially the same thing at the start of my stint of working for myself. Did the whole flyer thing and advertising for junk cars. Got pretty big in about year 6, had several guys working with me and even had an independent film crew shooting footage and shopping the teaser trailers around to several different networks. Sadly didn't get picked up but had a blast shooting all the footage. Still scrapping and now doing weld and fab as well. Kinda funny how the stories are so similar. I also volunteer a ton of time like after natural disasters etc...wish I could have gotten picked up and made into a brand as big as yours but I've not let that slow me down. Keep up the awesome work guys!!
Just proves hard work DOES pay off. Retired FMF Corpsman, and Blessed with a great family. You keep doing you!
No budget means unlimited lol, tight budget or budget means limited ❤
Best video ever. Really describes the people we have loved to know
Well that was just Awesome!
I bet you and your family are proud of you, that’s really cool.
Ha Awesome 🤘🏼‼️
Same color and marking scheme I got on my rig, been like that going on ten years now.
Obviously you guys love what you do!
Your employees got you to that Spot I hope the see it in there Checks respectfully
Hola from Southern New Mexico👋🌵🌶️🙂 Been watching you for years now and enjoy your videos. Thanks for all the memories💖💯
i got a creepy broke back mountain shiver when i saw that photo at the intro
I loved this video!!! I’m so happy for you guys and I will always be here to watch the next move 👍👍
I will never win one of these trucks.
I started my tree trimming Co with a bow saw in Phoenix Arizona I was walking down the road starving seen this company trimming a tree and sed to myself I could to that walked door to door after on day I bought a chanesaw within the next couple days I bought a delta 88 Oldsmobile week  after that was a truck after that I started JL TREE TRIMMING
My heart Drops when I see titles like this especially from what I consider a hero figure. What an amazing video, I actually feel like I was apart of all those experiences. I used to drive by your current shop and be terrified to stop in. Now all I want to do the next time I am in Utah is just spend the day their. Keep the content coming, somehow I am uplifted every single time. You make me not want to give up on my goals.
What an awesome story!
Another clickbait video full of bs
Very interesting and entertaining video Dave. I really enjoy, and look forward to each new video that you put out. I wish you and your team and your family all of the best in your future endevors, but most of all i really hope that you continue to keep the videos coming. Great story, great products and great videos Dave....you guys totally rock!!!  👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I guess cash flow means how to rip off your subscribers,
All I wish for some day is a small camper/rv to tow to take me and my young guy camping, can’t do tents no more, broke body…
Grats!
I can absolutely understand your story. I started messing with cars, fixing them at the side of the road. Fast forward several years, I'm in pain after a huge accident, relying on painkillers daily, but got my own small garage where I can do pretty much anything from servicing to full resto weld jobs. Sadly, I am in so much pain, I can only last a few hours, but it's my whole life. I enjoy helping people save a few pennies and keeping my hand in by doing whatever it takes to keep a vehicle in the road. Just spent 7wks welding a car that is worth nothing other than the sentimental value. But I am absolutely delighted that I have been a part of the journey in saving a vehicle for someone. I have no car lift, no pit, only an endless chain and home made ramps. But I somehow manage to plod along doing the thing I love. My only heartbreak is my son is only interested in playing with a computer.... Great for now, but when the apocalypse hits (climate change is NOT human generated, but rather planet cyclic stuff), I am going to be some old wizened goat trying to teach a computer geek how to weld chassis and roofs together to make a usable transport. Oh, and we need a boat!!!  But you guys are awesome 😎 All the best from Doo in Scotland 💖
Any advice on investments?
Both Daves, A Long Time Ago A Friend Told Me " If You Are Following Your Dream And Don`t Fail At Least 4 Times You Are Doing It Wrong, Start Over And Do It Again." I Have Been Following You Guys For A Long Time. And , Now Can Say I Have Seen What My Friend Had Told Me Those Few Years Ago. Thank You Both For Sharing The Story Of Diesel Brothers From The Start To Here. Hope , You Both And Families Have A Wonderful Thanks Giving.
I'll enter as long as the OLD GLORY is part of the WIN. Honestly the flag is the best part of that rig.
Loved your story! Became aware of you and your company while following AWP on their searches . I was blown away with your helping other people. You are successful because of hard work and helping others. It is my pleasure and honor to follow you and your brother as well as your whole crew. Thank you for helping others as I am blown away by your generosity in helping those in need.
Warlock for Senate. Oops I meant Warnock.
Give away means you need cash stop the cap you only do this to make a fast million tax free of a pos truck stop it
IN THE EARLY YEARS YOU SHOWED NEVER LIVE IN FEAR OF CHALLENGES MIND, BODY, SOUL EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU CHALLENGE LIMITATIONS, KEEP DOING WHAT YOU ALL DO MISS SEEING ALL THE THE BUILDS AND REBUILDS AND PROJECTS FROM THE DISCOVERY T.V. SHOW HOPE TO SEE MORE ADVENTURES IN THE BUSINESS ENDEAVOURS IN UP COMING YEARS ALOHA HEAVY D AND DIESEL D 🌴🏄😁
Your video title is ironically Prophetic. You guys just don't realize it yet. Extremely hard times on a Biblical scale is headed America's way and it's never going to come back. This truly is the beginning of THE END for America. Mark these words.
I'm currently in the middle east deployed with the US Army, thank you for posting videos regularly. I am renovating my first home when I get back and you guys give me motivation. I honestly hope to be posting on one of your videos saying "it's done". It will take a few years, but the home has good bones.
Man, Here I am at 50 years old and I'm throwing myself a curve ball and trying to switch "careers" from being a drywaller/carpenter for a couple of decades, and into selling cool old cars and youtubery. Much like your younger selves, I am broke as all get-out, but you've given me a little push in the right direction with this video. Thanks for that.
Sad to read that it is the end. Have fun in all the tings you guys going to do. I was always looking forward to see a new upload. im sorry that im not going to look the upload. Im not so good in the goodby thing.
Curious to know what the next business model and step is for you guys
Love you guys, all you do, and all you stand for and represent.
seat belt hater there just trying to stop you going tough the  windshield but if you want to waste every thing you built up  dont put them on and die
Seems like a cool vid but can't sit through all the adds
D is our P.T. Barnum
Be so cool to win that truck! Bring the US 24v to Kellogg Idaho where the US 12v originally went!!
I L❤VE  Y❤UR SH❤W❣️❣️
From the southern lands of Australia you have truly made my day and inspired me to keep going. I have been trying to start a business restoring old Patrols and LandCruisers but it's been really slow progress. You have given me the drive to keep at it.
This is awesome it definitely reflects the book you guys wrote. I'm also going through the bumps and bruises of starting a business from nothing. I hope to continue to push as hard as you both did to build an empire and help people the way you do. Definitely a big inspiration to me and a motto to follow!!!!
American female vet (MOS 52d mechanic) watching from Philippines. Love watching you all. Do you have any tank tops or shirts for women?  Can they be shipped to Philippines?  Keep up the great fun videos you help so many people!!!
Dude, I'm gonna enter cuz that truck is so close to my 2005 3/4 ton.  We could use it to pull a camper and farm equipment.
Thanks for the episode guys
Please tell me you guys are taking over/absorbing/rebranding AWP. Your recoveries are epic, and the compassion for the families you work with is palpable. Either way, please keep doing what you've been doing. You're wonderful amazing human beings with huge hearts. Can't wait to see the next chapter. Xx
I want to know where you got that jacket...
You guys gave me a great laugh and I enjoyed the show and love the videos I’m down on my luck and on my last pennies but you guys keep me motivated to keep going and to push on! Thank you!
I'm Jacques from shouth Africa
They’re about to start giving away helicopters lol
Hey guys. Thanks for sharing the story of how it all started! I always wondered how it all started! Great video. Thanks again.
AWESOME, It was fantastic to see your back story and see where you started and to see where you are now you have every reason to be very proud of where you are now and I wish you the best for the future
Struggling is a part of life... it’s what builds our character!  🇺🇸
I'm a huge fan of your channel I myself am from Canada and always enjoy watching the videos you post I always wondered what happened to thqt super nice boat that sunk???
U the best love wat u do
HeavydD what top is that you have on i like it ?
God’s humbling road is rewarding if you keep walking on it to see where it goes.
I'd still roll coal.
I never knew your back story, maybe started checking out the channel a year ago.  That's pretty great, love the progression from a series of mistakes, growth, learning, a crap ton of hard work, to an "overnight" success! Keep up the good. work.
Muchas mas Bendiciones Dios los Bendiga
It's all about the journey of getting there.   To carve it in the stones you must be able to play in the sand or well snow to come lol.
So you guys are done on you tube no more posts hmm OK bro you know where we all will be here waiting for you 2 to return respect to you both peace
Heck of a story you guys really worked hard to get to where you are today👍Best of luck on your new ventures! From humble beginnings barely getting by to helping others congratulations.
As someone that has a struggling small home remodeling business I congratulate you guys for all the hard work you had to do to get to where you are now God Bless you
THE BEST VIDEO YET
I'm guessing your doing this in part due to Discovery airing the last season of your show?
I'm going to by some merchandise and win that truck I love everything u guys do I feel like you guys are brothers from a nother mother
I can believe it's over but it's good that you guys are on to better things I ll keep whatching you guys
Man, I've really grown to love you guys.
😁👍
Mate see this is what i keep telling my 28 yr old son. He is such an amazing young man. Dropped out of school at 14 due to learning issues he couldn't overcome. Went straight in to a programme for kids like him to learn auto electrics. But the programme was shut down half way through due to funding. He got a few jobs. One he was fired from despite him being a good worker because it was a family run business and they were a strict religious family and didnt like my sons tattoos or music choices. Just wasnt a good fit. Finally he got his forklift licence. Has been employed ever since at 2 jobs. He has a fiance and 2 beautiful little ones. But things seem to never work the way he wants. His 4wd blew up. He is using my car as he cant afford another. I have a chronic severe illness. Was in a coma last year for 6 weeks, in hospital for 4 months in total. I was working full time as a night nurse. Then in an instand had to learn to eat move walk etc again. Well i cant really walk much as i have severe peripheral Neurapathy on top of my chronic illness.  Im living with them in a 2 bedroom apartment. They take care of me. Now the landlord wants to sell and its hard to find a place. By 13th Jan. But i keep telling him to never give up on your dreams. His kind and giving heart, his love of family and always his willingness to help others is awesome to see. He has mental health issues. Is on medication and sees a psychologist every other week. It helps. I love watching him as a daddy, so amazing. But you mate, are exactly the type of mentor he has always needed and never had. The proof that if you just keep getting out there and trying, never give up, then your dreams can happen. You should be so proud of yourself! I am proud of you, just as i am my son. Such a wonderful story. Thankyou for sharing. Love and Prayers xo
Glad your doing great.
So did you end up buying the property ?
Awesome work Men.. keep at errrr
I always knew that hard work brought you to this moment. Having you show and tell was great. I’ve loved watching you help all kinds of folks, laughing, scared when you guys go on those skinny, steep roads and the fear when you were at the cabin. Thanks for the ride!
Keep up the good work and Awesome work
Well that's an hour I won't get back..!!
For every real success. There's a hard fought origin story. Can't wait to see what's next!
Absolutely Impressive HeavyD, Dreams can come true if you believe in yourself and push boundries.
You missed out the Island...  I would have loved a quick recap and to see where it fit amongst the moves and the motivation behind it.  Loved the Tour and the US 24 Valve looks Awesome.
Hard work and good people always succeed and im proud to see this in order iv been a fan for many yrs but as of late knowing you guys more and the help you offer people that are in need its just awsome so you guys deserved the world then and do now as well
I really enjoyed your story and I can’t wait to see what’s coming next!  God be with you!
I really hope you’re not trying to do something with electric vehicles, they are cool but not practical.
That episode was awesome! Never knew the beginning of your story. Thank you for sharing.
There's nothing wrong about your "lifestyle" choices...lol The there's nothing you can't do with a great "life" partner!
Hey guys, what a  adventure! You guys are both awesome! Love to watch! Thanks for sharing your story!  Very interesting!!   GODS BLESSINGS TO YOU ALL! 🙏🙏❤️❤️
if a welder job opens  up where to they post it
It's been nice to see yall grow into what it is now. I remember watching that video of diesel Dave at the gas station pulling that gasser out the way trying to figure out if it was legit. Thanks for sharing your story, it was nice seeing some of the backstory. Brought back some good memories for me when I worked with cars.
This video i loved it  super content
The clip of the paintball trap and smoking out the bathroom were the first videos I saw of yours, it feels like not that long ago. You guys are great
@heavyD Your stories remind me of imagination and integrity goes hand in hand, stay interested, intrigued, and engaged and nothing could possibly go wrong!
Thanks guys for great videos and uplifting stories !
Such an amazing journey
This is the American dream come true. Hard work mixed with brotherhood and a little bit of diesel power. You boys made it to the top and you have not forgotten where you came from. Love and respect
Have a great Thanksgiving. Hope someone in need of that truck wins,  still don't like the color. Army green is not for me I'm of the Haze gray kind.
Very ,very interesting to see where you started from, you have earned everything you have and have my highest respect.  Everything I have, I have earned, so I can relate. Looking forward to the future of what's coming.
HeaveDSparks nice to c where u guys came from more important great to also be shown u have never forgotten where u came from great job hard work n dedication
ive always loved watching your videos, and seeing what you guys come up wiht. and i wont lie your success story inspired me to take a plunge and start my own business, and for that i owe it all to you guys
permitless county, work stuff... need a permit to buy, paint sand paper tools everything. "permitless county = money is permit, money = lunch, buy this and there is no room for that... $5 that leaves ya hungry for months" how to get a permit, have active engineering degree renewed and tested every 3 years... props to having permit, buddy doesn't pay bill state goes after them. "permitless work is permitted via bylaws to the same regulations, don't get paid hardly anything... state just cuts more checks. "crabby lady, monsters inc." always watching...
That great and all but why a dodge?
Man, talk about hustling. People will see what you have now and have no idea what you came from.   Inspires me to know I can start a business small and grow it and not be afraid of my dream because it’s too big.
Why’s the brightness so low or is that just me
I love you guys.  I'm a 70yr old wife & mom who enjoys watching your stories.  My family & I love Jesus & try to live for His glory everyday so it's especially enjoyable to hear you speak about your faith in Him.  May God richly bless you, your families, & Diesel Brothers.
What the soccer is seeing you guys with no beards that scared me I have nightmares LOL keep up the great work love you guys God bless you and your crew and your family
And we’re is the black hawk
Great story loved watching it Thanks for sharing
Whats it cost to bulletproof a 2004 6.0 powerstroke? Had it 11 years, always had issues. Ruined my job,  ruined my marriage, my life tbh.
US 24V's exhaust stacks remind me of tank cannon muzzle brakes and I love that.  Edit: Also I love how "around 100k" is considered "low miles" because these things just go forever 🤣  Edit 2: "Sunset's that way" 🤣🤣🤣
Best video yet!
You’ve worked hard and now help so many other people.  God bless
Dont like the title change, Its misleading. Not even going to watch it, Started to before the title change and I thought the original fit more appropriately.
Clickbait title. I was sure y’all were coming out of the closet.  We all know those beards are to hide the bruises on your chin
Guys, I need that to haul my 5th wheel.😳💞💙❣️💋
My son saw that truck and looked me dead in the face. Daddy I want to drive in that truck. So here I am. Hoping I win for my kids🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻this story is amazing. Rags to riches.
Great video, thank you for sharing! Excited with what’s to come.
On would and up  would  the way forward  best  regards ✨️
Awesome history, you do so much for others and came from such humble beginning
Great story. Thanks for sharing!
Great Story, Great Dudes, Great Company, Thank you for sharing!!! Happy Thanksgiving Diesel Brothers and crew.
Right on you 2!!!!
Love you guys!
You ZZ top looking fools are doing good God bless
GREAT VIDEO MY FRIENDS THANK YOU FRANK FROM MONTANA.........
Loved this video. Shows with a dream and busting ur butt u went from nothing to the world is the limit. Ty and good luck in future endeavors....
I have a lot of respect for you guys you guys have heart with a lot of people don't you've helped a lot of people through your journey God bless you guys and keep up the good work
Nice truck, but do you (and all other residents of the US) ever think about warming up of our planet on which we all live and have to SURVIVE?
Can’t wait to see what’s next!!!!!
You're amazing. What a amazing story.  And you now are helping people in need.  Just goes to show how truly humble you are, and you don't look down on people.  God Bless you.
Cool story bro. LOL No really,  awesome journey. Can't wait to see what is next.
Thats a cute little picture of you 2 guys! LOL A little brokeback mountain vibe but still good stuff!!HAHA
Tell us you are not selling something while telling us you are having a huge sale on EVERYTHING!!  You sir are a TRUE used car salesman.
45:00 with gooseneck flatbed trailer, it would make the perfect HotShot rig
Good luck Dave and Dave you two are making great bounds!!!
Awesome story 👌🔥
I wanted to get some of your remote trucks for the kids ! But you dont ship to Australia!!??
@Heavydsparks would you be interested in a 2003 cummins with 113,000 miles? The truck is absolutely flawless and clean. I dont how else to reach you.
Bro I was scared I thought diesel Dave was leaving
💙💙💙
I am a ford man but I wouldn't mind that bad boy truck!! I was drinking to Dallas from western Washington and on the way back to Washington State we pulled in to your shop was having truck problems it was like 7 am last Saturday morning  I wound love one off you 5 tons ... Love you guys!!!
2012 homeless and sick, 2022 homeowner and better. Never give up, only move up!
All that you guys do is really cool! I think you really care about helping people who need it rather it be helping a employee who lost everything to attempting to find missing people to bring peace to the family and hopefully justice that is unreal for most to even think about once you have means to do that, and says alot about who you guys are. I'm not going to tell you my sad story, that was another time and another place, just wanted to tell all of you thank you for what you do and the faith in man you have restored in myself! Hope your holiday season is great for your family , thank you once again Scott Hodson Golden co
Awesome journey
You guys put a lot of effort in your work and many people who should respect that I know I'd do. Just keep on trucking is what I say.
Hopefully it isn’t EV!
A great story of entrepreneurship
Okay I am confused I thought your name was Dave, so if the other ones name is Dave what is your name?
I would love it but I can't drive stick shift plus I am short & it out be too hard to climb in and out of. Boy did you guys look so young without the facial hair. Great video!
I've wondered for quite some time what your story was now I know thank you for sharing
Thanks for sharing your story 👍
What an amazing story of success. I am always impressed by anyone who is successful through their hard work. What I find more impressive is that after reaching a certain level you then start the work of being available to help others who need it. Your service to people you don't know and willingness to go far beyond what anyone could imagine will be your story that others will tell. I enjoyed hearing you tell the story of your guys evolution and wish you blessings to you and all those you touch.
I ran my business out of a storage unit for 5 years. It started with one storage unit and one parking a lot for the company vehicle to we pretty much rented half the parking lot and had 5 storage units. We finally got kicked out by the fire department. I literally got in my truck and started driving around looking for a commercial space. Same kind of thing, I found a place that I could tell people were moving out of but didn’t have have a for sale sign yet and got it just in time!
You both are an inspiration to many
lol  I visited with you boys up in Mountain Home Idaho where you brought a couple vehicles there to compete in their Tough Truck Challange back in 2016 I believe !     That 12V Cummins was last seen over in the Kellogg Idaho, All of their builds have been SPECTACULAR !
THIS. This is what I really like to see! The background and history of the Diesel Brothers. You are both so full of character and inspiration as I am trying to start my own business. I'm looking forward to what's coming next, please do more of this wholesome content 😊👍
It's a great country.
The truck you are driving with the big tires, what size rear differential is under it?? The differential looks like a string with a knot in it!!!
I love videos like this. You guys are awesome
I've never had such a roller coaster of emotions watching any video until this one, thank you so much for everything you all have done for us, you're the dads I wish i had, please don't ever stop being yourselves, you guys are pure and genuine, and again thank you ❤
Dam enjoy your videos .Your team is kick ass. Have great Thanksgiving and Christmas 🎄
Great story
Why am i crying i feel like something is over
Oh, how I wish NY alowed individuals to go to auctions. The car auctions are restricted to dealers only.  The sight seeing schoolbus should have had a couple roll cage type hoops, so in case of rollover, anyone belted into the back wouldn't get crushed.
What a story! Rock on brotha!
I love your show
Very cool video guy's enjoyed the trip .From N.B.Canada all the best well done
Inspiring! Hard work, determination, smart business sense and good friends- can't fail!
Gotta love a good Origin Story! Every hustler seems to have dipped a toe or two in the Auto industry.
if you do anything make it at least regular gasoline and for God's sake do not use electric
Typical click bait bullshit
America, Were hard work will still result in success, also were Democrats want to take that away from Americans .
Awesome! God bless you guys. Keep on trucking 👍👍😎
You guys are awesome.
movie line with Woody Allen in it “my accountant says I have a cash flow problem…………It’s not flowing……..
Awesome Bio on your business, great video.
Just a amazing journey.  I've Ben with you since day one on YouTube.  I don't have much time left in life.  But I will continue to keep watching all your videos  . Thanks for sharing brother.
What a ju what a journey these guys came from nothing and they built a small Empire they got to be proud of themselves
I’m sorry brother I just can’t afford anything on your website at the moment so I’ll miss out on the entries for the pickup truck I’m sorry man.
I thought the potion of the video at 31:57 was a bit odd (offline media) as if something got screwed up with Premiere Pro during the editing process. So who mucked it up? :)
Damn Dave looks great without the beard… I say all get cuts as it always grows back….
This is a really cool video man.
i would  like to win that truck to sale to my neighbor I would give it to him but he would never take it from me.
Wait the title wasn't clickbait? Nice
Heavy D❤. You are a Really, Really Blessed Man From God.🙏😇🇬🇧🙏😇🇬🇧. Your amazing Love. Your a Blessed Man that’s for sure. Your someone for the young kids too really 👀 up too. You’ve helped far too many people too even remember and not even ask for a Penny???  You and your group of Chaps are literally amazing. ❤. Just think, if there was a few more like you??? How different the world would be????  Heavy D, I don’t know you except online, but Geez Love. I honest too God I Love You. 💕💖🇬🇧💕💖🇬🇧  you are a proper human being, in this world of people that just don’t want too know about hard ship. It’s there own fault they are struggling. Yet you didn’t say that HD, you helped them. For that, according too me. You are a new age Guardian Angel, these days. I can’t watch till the end. I just had too say, you and your guys are top, top people that also have fun in what they are doing. You guys need far more recognition for what you do?????    I love you guys. 🤞🙏💖🇬🇧🤷‍♀️. Keep the faith. 🤞👍❣️💔👀🙏💖🇬🇧🙏💖🇬🇧😇🇬🇧😇
I guess this shows when you are chancing a dream. no matter how high the mountains or how deep the valleys. you got to keep pushing for what you want. And never give up on your dreams.  Wishing you and all the guys and gals that work for you. And your Family a very Happy Thanksgiving.
Hard times are coming, don't carry any debt. The lefties plan is for us to own nothing by 2030. Let's drug test all politicians!
Trucks after 2007 aren't worth owning. Personally, I think anything after 1995 should have had a crusher at the end of the assembly line. Once the emissions crap got mandated on diesels, they became nothing but trouble.
Thank you for our family and friends that support us overseas!!!
Oh ok, So you are Not quitting Youtube and Shutting down Everything and like retiring for good. Just closing down the way you do Giveaways. Bit of misleading Title.
Wow!! That picture of you two with no beards is insane!
Wow!! That was a great history! Your perseverance for your dream is inspiring! Thank you for sharing!😁
Oh, please more commercials. Another and another and another...
Now that the building that the white Chevy Duramax he was working on caught on fire
You showed me that im still going in the right direction  Thank you
Ha ha I got my first shirt from yall at location #7 this is awesome to see.
Second watch
It’s nice to see people doing nice things paying it forward I use to have one of them good ole trucks they definitely were the best  and man is it nice my welding machine would look great on that beast good job you guys!!!
It's one thing to have a vision.. it's another thing to make that vision happen..  Good work guys..
THIS VIDEO IS GREAT THANKS THO FOR THE JOURNEY
Great story. True American honest hard work to the ladder of success.   If I had to guess it sounds like it’s time to go public.  All the best to you boys!  If that’s the case I’ll be a buyer!
Many congrats for having come so far and for being so honest
An inspiring story, you set a high bar for those who aspire to make their dreams come true on a major scale Heavy D.
i came across a video of you guys on youtube a year and a half ago and i fell in love with the content you guys made. after watching a few videos i found out that you guys have your own show on discovery. so i subscribed to discovery+ to watch dieselbrothers. and I've been your biggest fan ever since, at least from the Netherlands!  Keep up the good work, and i’m excited to see what you’re going to do next! Love you guys!
I've watched you guys grow>>> from your big discovery channel show- bro dozer every post from this channel>>>>>>> Can't wait to see what is in the making! Your whole crew are awesome and my friend "Ant" and I tinker around (I'm a non formally trained body man... I'm good and he is a awesome with only audi and Volkswagen but Pick any year)  so we have semi normal jobs right now (alot of temp agencies) you diesel boy were friends from start and inspire me and my best friend!
That's the American dream people out there pay attention nothing was given and it was done by there boot straps
Love your channel. I can appreciate your struggle. This is where your character is forged. Keep up the good work. Faithful fan Al Reed, retired carpenter.
GREAT SHOW YOUR BEST
Did you guys design the exhaust tips to resemble muzzle brakes?  Looks awesome!
Bruh I’m not even done watching the video and this is definitely the best video y’all have put out and glad y’all made it out this wonderful journey
Damn that 24v is beautiful.  I'd love to own that beauty.   I'd love to get rid of my old old junk 1500 dodge and drive that nice dodge.   Really good video Heave D and Diesel Dave.  Keep up the great work. I love everything you guys and your team does. Don't ever stop.
We inherited a business beginning of this year and we are just now leasing our first piece of equipment and we just purchased a press. This year has been rough but we have doubled the size of the business. I worked for quite a few people the year that really burned us. But in all of that, I learned how to manage cash flow, assets, business models, marketing, etc. We are super excited but still eeking it out. It's tons of fun!
You are amazing! You wife is amazing for being there for you. ❤ Your mom must be very proud of you! Congratulations for making your dream come true. ❤️
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Fookin epic
Silly boysl. Trucks are for girls!
Thanks you for representing a true American family and patriots.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you!  CWO4 USMC Retired.  Nice truck too!
Beautiful truck
24:43 The sightseeing bus was from my home town Victoria BC nasty Diesel engines they burn coal all the time and packed with tourist lol
Oh GOSH, what a deal!!!  Instead of 100 thousand entries there may only be 90 thousand entries!!! Meanwhile I am still looking through my Tshirt that I foolishly bought that is SEE THROUGH!!!! You guys are a piece!!! I'm not going to clarify what a piece of S$%] you are, I'll let the readers decide but my 30 dollar order with the "cool die-cast" and see through Tshirt is a F#%/Kin joke!!!!!!!
It just goes to show hard work can pay off .respect to guys and ya team
Turn 2 bothers !!!
I moved a small engine repair shop once and it wasn’t fun at all with all the tools and equipment, can’t imagine your guys moves with additional specialty tools and equipment you guys had to move 8 times
Nice video to see the evolution.
Only in the USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Somebody pat him on the back
Inspiring
You guys have kept me going threw some really dark times, you have always been there when I needed it and I thank you for that
Great throw back video. Thanks guys
Will you ship it to Norway if i win?😂
A tour of the entire building  Please !!
i watched you guys on the tv show and recently caught back up with you on youtube! struggles make us realize we are real people and need to push harder for what we dream of having 😉
Thank you guy's for all you do. I'm a disabled truckdriver and can't get around much anymore so watching you all go  on your adventures It's like I'm there to....Thanks again
Awesome story. As a small business owner I can appreciate where you have been and where you are going. Congratulations. Can’t wait to see what happens next.
Narcissist.
heavyd sounding like a liberal probably because he is one.
What was Dave doing in China all those years ago?
Yall went thru a lot. Now Yall look better at the place.
Diesel Dave is the epitome of loyal. Love you guys.
I'm delighted to learn some background, this helps me understand your history and perhaps a glimpse of what is to be. Thanks for taking the time. Be well, be safe!
Luv watching your videos mate. You definitely have put your heart and soul into what you believe in cheers 🍻 love the new build . Have a great day old mate 👍
Thank you Dave and Dave!!! You two are true Patriots!!!
Awesome video guys 😎 Stay blessed
Absolutely Dam love it, love your story & love the hard earned success!  Ever since seeing the show from discovery to now the true story on YouTube your been amazing and can’t wait for the next chapter in this adventure.  Keep up the epic work and the kind heart & soul that you all are. 🐻❤️
Really cool story fellas rock on dudes!!!!!!!
Really Inspiring, wow.
You guys came along way. My dream is to just a lift kit on my truck but being on disability it’s so hard I love big trucks.
Great video, it just goes to show that you can do anything you set your mind to with goals and an unyielding determination towards them. Failure is a natural part of the whole process, you can not give up on your dreams or that's all they'll ever be.
Great vlog gents, what a journey. Nice truck too only way too new for me lol. On a side note, I think a fan poll on either HeavyD or Diesel Dave shaving their beards is on the board. Or Hans/ Badboy to grow a beard. Keep the vlogs rolling!!
Thanks for sharing your story~I'm very proud of you guy's and your determination~🤗❤👍✌
There's just something about a Backstory... Thank you for sharing & taking us on your adventure! 🤟🤗
Weird multi language offline red screen in the background around the 32 minute mark. I have a screenshot if you need it. 👌
Thank you for sharing this. I’m trying to build a life out of hopes and dreams as well and this video has shown to keep my head held high and move forward. All dreams come true if you work hard.
Very nice
Ever think about getting together with OriginUSA to release some products? Automotive related of course.
God is absolutely good and you all are blessed beyond measure. Keep up the good work. God bless you all.
It is hugely gratifying to watch a successful businessman be honest and open about how he came to be there. It totally makes sense now why you guys all help out as much as you do because you do genuinely recognise that you wouldn't be where you are now if others hadn't done the same for you. I didn't cry lol but it was a beautiful watch!!!
Great story of the great American dream. This is what happens with hard work and dedication.  You've earned it. Best of luck in the future. I look foward to warching
I hope a deserved veteran can earn your gracious. Thank you Navy Bothers!!!
You guys are talking in a context like this was 25 years ago lol it’s barely been 10. Tremendous growth and shows you what hard work produces congratulations.
we are very alike! they call me the barter king over here, I buy/sell and trade just about everything. its how i make a living.
Amazing what determination and gritty perseverance will do, well done fellas, I have been a fan since someone sent me the og airbag musical chair video, can't remember the truck you were giving away but I do remember laughing rather uncontrollably 😂
another fish or click  bait give away , no  money , no entry  lol  awesome lol
I want the truck lol
Outstanding story.  American in every way- hustle, street smarts and keeping a dream alive.  All the future success to you!
You guys are so awesome! I can sit and watch your videos forever. I wish I could afford to support by buying some merchandise. Times are hard. I will purchase as soon as I can. Please keep the awesome videos coming!
More clickbait I don't even know why I watch these videos.. at the beginning he talked about telling the story of all the ups and downs and he really didn't say anything this glazed over it 46 minutes of time wasted but you know what I still love these videos and I still love these guys keep on trucking
One of my dreams was to have one of those old Land Rovers in the picture.  Maybe an 88 or something. I've had an 05 D2 for 10 years now, bought used. Pushing 200k miles and still going strong.
Love the story. What an outcome!
I'm sure you know that your journey has inspired alot of the younger generation to get off their asses and put those interprenioral skills  into motion great job not possible without great people that you trust and rely on great ideas-just a hillbilly from Pa.
I have a 2004 Cummings turbo diesel, with 130 miles on it.  Excellent condition.  But, I don’t want to sell it.
MY UTAH BOYS
You guys never gave up,love your videos and the skills you have to recreate on different vehicles to make them stand out,keep doing what your doing with great awesomeness whatever your future leads you too and may God watch over and protect you
I love the story to see how you started, like truck, like your story!
i was going to buy something to get in on the truck but you want to much presonal info..
Great story y'all. Congratulations on what y'all do.
Used Car Salesman
It's been a wonderful journey following your adventure. I wish you all the best of luck on this next chapter..God Bless you Heavy D & Diesel Dave.
Definitely needed that inspiration today, having a gloom outlook lately....thank you
When you guys started doing the six door duallie's I told my wife,now ex,that one day I wanted one of them.Well,how many years later I have an ex-wife,a crew-cab,my dog and an RV that me and the dog live in.Unfotunatly i couldn't afford to do it now.Thats the reason for the crew-cab,half is hers,the dogs LOL Still not enough room for me and a 90 Lb. GSD,hahahaha
Cool video! How is your ring tattoo holding up Dave? Many thanks
Amazing story. I look forward to the next chapter!  You guys are role model entrepreneurs.
That image of you when you were young was so clingy lmao don’t ever shave
That was just one big click-bait load of marketing BS.
Diesel Dave jumped in when he saw it was safe
When did you change your name to the Diesel Brothers and when did you guys become partners or does Dave just work for you
Quite the story
Don't tell me u guy r leaving the diesel Brothers I'm going to be sad I love ur show
I am very happy you guys made it. I hope I will get there soon, God Bless.
Soo… what is “over”? He rambles so much you couldn’t tell what his point was or what is over
Wow heck of a journey you and your business has been on. I am 24 yrs old and I'm still trying to figure out what career or job I would like to do and I just want to say wow you sharing your journey is very inspiring to me. Gives me personally hope that I will find a good career someday or maybe even have a business of my own someday. Happy holidays to you and your family and thank you for sharing your story.
holy crap dave and dave with no beards!
I got to take a nap after this video
Bulcrap!! That stolen truck add was EPIC NOTHING SHORT OF THAT!! Too bad the public lowers your  standards of advertising to match their level of market. Although short,  My travels with you and the H D fam... have been a life altering inspiration! I’ve installed a new 5 point harness in my recliner.  I’m buckled up and ready to ride!  Love you boys and enjoy your work. Kudos to all !! Dump the Clutch!
This was awesome!! Way to go boy's!!  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
You guys deserve all you have for the effort involved and helping people is definitely paying it back!
Really enjoyed this video it reminds me of how I've done things one step at a time. It's interesting when you look back on what you've done You can't believe the time that it took and how much time was invested and then you see where you are now and you think how did the time go by so fast. Good luck guys
Tha ole Geezer and I wish you the best at any avenue y’all go down, also we’re going after that bad truck which would make our day or be part of our days 😊
It is stories like this that really do make America the greatest country on the planet. So glad to see that the Diesel Brothers did not just succeed but are thriving. Keep building bad ass diesels and continue making America the Greatest Place on Earth.
You guys are just beautiful people.  Glad I meet you, at least trough your videos.  Real guys, real brotherhood
Great story goes to show. What you can do putting your mind where you want to be. Hope you guys have many more years doing what you do
Great story. "Bunch of hopes n dreams"
What a great story you guys! Best video to date IMO! love you guys..
All this time I've been figuring you guys were offspring of someone with deep pockets financing all your craziness. Glad you proved me wrong!  Kudos for coming up the hard way! 🤠👍
Oh ya.   From scratch.   From living in card board.  To having a job   And a nice car    Keep up the great work
Great Video I've watched from the start
Thanks for the backstory. I really enjoyed it.
I am over 50 years old. Started watching the TV show about 4-5 years ago and got on to the YouTube videos about 2 years ago. As an IT professional and security expert, I avoid posting on social media like the plague but I had to do so for this one. Gentlemen, this is the best I've ever seen.  Well done, guys.  Well done.
Are y'all going out of business
Hell of a Journey guys, all the best for the future 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
One has got to love an underdog story. Thank you for the trip down memory lane. You saw potential in yourselves and had the stones to follow through. Where I worked maintenance there were a few of us that could have went out on our own, but took the safe route instead. Time goes by too fast to have regrets. Again great job!
So great to hear your journey.  I wish you all the best with your continued success.
Awesome Journey guys! I know your momma's are proud of you! ❤️🙏🇺🇲
You guys are an inspiration and very strange seeing you without beards, Great channel and great guys 👍 thanks
Promises...
Great Show, glad to learn your history of HeavyDSparks, thanks
I remember when I first saw you on Discovery thinking ‘ these guys are idiots but the build some pretty cool trucks’. I’m not to proud to say I was wrong, you’re friggin’ genius.
Welldone boys!
Well, ive only been watching you guys about a year now,and I was always wondering where you guys came from. And your journey , so this was cool 😎.
Working there would be a dream job. I've been welding and fabricating for almost 30 yrs. But im tired of waisting my time, effort and talent to just build air supply and dust system components.  I believe I m floating around just waiting for my calling as to where I could let me ideas n the love for fabricating to evolve.  But im on the east coast. Lol, go figure .
👍👍👍👍 I watched every show since the beginning I love it keep on tracking
😂😂😂😂 keep giving $ to this scam artist
When the video was finished I was like what  thats it  I wanted more  hahahaha great video guys greetings from Athens Greece
I enjoyed your walk down memory lane with Roman Atwood and this was just icing on the cake.
I wanna know how Hans and Badboy came into the fold? Seems like you got a good 2 for 1 deal with those guys!
Overcoming the theft from the government on “emissions”, how did you get through that?
This motivates me.. I'm currently losing everything
Vary awesome indeed. Keep up the great work you guys. Okay.
I can't wait to see what is next!
WHAT A WONDERFUL STORY!!!!  THIS IS WHY WE WILL GIVE OUR LIVES IF NEEDED TO PROTECT OUR FREEDOMS!!!!
💚✌️
Just a quick question. Why no more giveaways
P.S. GIVE US AN INSIDE COMPOUND TOUR TOP TO BOTTOM!!!!!!     please.
Are yall gonna continue to make videos or take time to yourselves
Freaking awesome
Thanks for sharing your story guys.
I'm a disabled & widowed (lost my other half last Feb to COVID) dad of a teenage daughter who has been on dialysis for almost 19 years now. Aside from my baby girl, there's not much in life that brings me joy these days but, I do look forward to these videos of you guys' journey and stories! I don't know what tomorrow holds for me, all I do is take life one day at a time & enjoy each like it's gonna be my last. My thoughts and prayers are with you all in whatever direction you go &v God willing, I'll be here to follow along. My only affordable adventures and enjoyment are through the lives of ones such as yourself.  God bless! ~ Scott H.  💙🙏🏼🇺🇲
Bloody headed,  that's takin 1 for the team !
I thought you were going to announce that you got cancelled and are going to do other things. Very deceptive thumbnail.
Absolutely an amazing video and story about where you came from. Can't wait to see what else you have in store for your next adventure.
This was a full blown documentary.
What a journey! Keep it up guys!
34:56 Way back in the 90s that building had a trucking company in it.  I delivered someone's personal vehicle they purchased from California.
Very glad you shared. Now l have much respect thanks.
Most of us have watched the TV show from the beginning, and now have been watching since the beginning of the YouTube channel. We have never had a shop tour or tour of the whole facility. It's probably the biggest part of who the Diesel Brothers are.
Beardless young diesel brothers look soooooooo weird 🤣
I wish.. I could have a truck but....
That jacket you are wearing is sick why is it not on the website.
One things for sure in the passed 10 years you never bought a razor
I’ve watched y’all for a long time and I enjoyed hearing about how it all got started…👍👍🇺🇸♥️
Yo.. I’m so stoked to watch this story. It’s something I’ve always hoped to see one day…so thank you
So no more videos 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Great story, did you buy the space you are in?? Or rented?
Your old dually is up in Washington state
That's a pretty awesome truck, I'm hard up for cash these days since times are super tough rightnow but Im gonna spend some money I don't have on merch I don't need because that truck is something I WANT!!! I could make some serious money with that thing!!!!!!
Nice Guys you deserve your sucess!
Heavy D what more can I say save this. I wish I had the talent and drive to do things like you guys do. I wish I had the money for the merchandise. Right now I'm going through my 2nd divorce. My 5 screws and 2 steel plates in my right foot and being born disabled in southwestern MN makes a tricky situation that more tricky to live on. Your videos are great and the trucks are just useful for the everyday uses. I wish I could afford them. Keep doing what you do Heavy D. You have the right people and the drive. What the future will hold we can only wait and see. If I had a working cellphone right now but I can only watch YouTube. At least I got the house out of this. Now to find a way to pay the bills on retirement disability SSI not going to be easy.
Badass journey. After listening to Atwood’s podcast I think I know where this is going. Best of luck and kick ass.
That is funny. I went to school with Cole
I love what you guys do! Never a bad Wibe with you guys!
Thanks for sharing your story  you guys are awesome people  love the content  thanks
Happy Holidays   Keep up the great videos,   Keep safe Glen from Guam usa
I loved the stolen truck video! I was completely on the end of my seat.
Loved seeing the evolution of your business!
Heavy D what’s that camo jacket you got on??? You sell them?
My husband and I love watching your videos.  The convertible school bus is great!!  Hearing you talk about your humble beginnings is so awesome and inspiring. It makes sense now why your heart is so big to do for others.  My prayers are with you all, Be Blessed, protected and have continued good health.  We look forward to your videos.
As someone working for the American dream it has been a pleasure watching you share your lives and knowledge with us. Clearly showing it can be done with hard work, knowledge, and a little luck. I wish you all the best with what is next in your lives. God bless
You guys are amazing. How come you guys are not doing any more truck giveaways?
Love the stories and the love the journey
Fate
🤠The absolutely coolest guys in the USA and I'm a Canadian saying this. Real genuine good people.
loved the history of diesel brothers
Love you all you guys man. The Raza is with you ! 🇲🇽🇺🇲🤙🏼
Excellent! Thanks for more backstory. That being said, rumor has it that Diesel Dave still showers with a garden hose to this day. Lol.
This story is the definition of "fake it till you make it" !
I hope and pray that you give blessings to people worthy or not worthy, God has blessed your soul. One day we shall meet. We all go through a bunch of crap sometimes it changes us but the true heart if we give and not expect anything back God blesses us. I do believe it's part of the Gospel of Jesus. He once said if you give a cold glass of water to someone that is thirsty you are doing it like you're doing it to me says Jesus from God. That's one thing I loved about Jesus he always refused to take any compliment he would say no I'm doing it because this is what God wants.
The Roman Atwood podcast with you 2 told a lot, this was even better showing the journey. Thanks for doing what you do!
Your life was basically sad as country music back in the day  but now you're Rockstar happy.  Yayuh yeet yeet 👍
al tho i can't win because i live europe i really enjoyed watching this give away!
Love your videos heavy d you and your team are amazing
Heavy you and d diesel Dave built s I me amazing trucks I enjoyed watching them being built
Gotta ask, what jacket Heavy D is wearing?
Where is the free entry method got to have a free entry method legally
You two,are awesome thanks for sharing
Did you guys not watch the Gale Banks videos where he shows just how shitty those stupid diff covers you put on the truck are? They're a recipe for disaster and you're just setting up the next owner for failure. Really makes it seem like you guys don't know what you're doing.
Great positive video. Just shows that doesn't matter how many falls you have always get up and do better. Inspired by this and now time to make a change.
That was fantastic guys and no wonder I like your Channel I'm rooting for you👍👍👍👍👍👍👍✌
Seeing people like you guys cast aside the fear of failure and chase your dreams is so inspirational. Sadly it makes me reflect inward a bit and realize I have not done the same. Amazing story and I can’t wait to see what to see what your next adventure is.
Yea that was not fun maybe 4 you   But I'm glad there's a button called fast forward
Now thays the way you do it! Keep it up guys.
I would love to have that truck but right now I don't have the money to buy any of your merch I wish I could but I can't not right at this moment
As a disabled veteran I absolutely love that truck. That's AMERICA 🇺🇸
It's so easy to look at successful people and think you can never get there. Thanks for sharing the journey, and showing that success is within reach for anyone willing to grind for for it.
37:11 hell yeah I'm still here!!!
WOW who were those handsome young studs in the beginning?❤❤❤
I love that I know all these locations and can remember driving by all the time and seeing these changes but didn’t even know what was really happening
Ok Thank you
You guys are an inspiration for me and my own channel. Thank you
Must be so nice to have a friend that is on the same plane as you and you're both after the same vision. That's a blessing from God right there!!
Good luck. People are broke. Inflation at a all time high. Not alot can afford to buy merc for a chance to win nothing. Hell I bet 90% of us are to broke to pay attention
When black hawk coming
Whatever you and your Brother's plans are? May you enjoy, grow and succeed in.
Nice!!
I wish I could buy some merch to be entered but I'm falling to far behind on the 03 ram 3500 that I have so no money to spare on merch 😥 thanks for the vid guys
So basically you started your career off as a LIER. And you admitted it on film. “Yea I can turn your school buss into a sightseeing tour bus.
This is what makes you how you are well  grounded guys you have integrity buddy thanks so much fun
I would love to see y’all work with Black Rifle Coffee on a truck build and they’re right there in Salt lake
Gutted I’ve never been able to try to win one of your awesome trucks!! I live in the UK. I’m guessing shipping would be a tad impractical! 😂  Would you guys ever do a competition that us Brits can join in with? 😎👊🏼
What's over or the end of an Era? Maybe in the past not now.vYour click bait titles are starting to make me not want to click.
This truck would be perfect for Louisa khovanskii,  the photograf from Ukraine,  that just moved to Canada.  It have room for all her gear, and its perfect for comming around in Canada,.
But I will not stop watching you
Key…. “ looking for the next moment of growth”.
Best One yet!!! Thank you for sharing your stories
I don’t trust you anymore
I love your videos but I have unsubscribe from the channel because of clickbait titles this video popped up on my feed. Please stop the F-ing clickbait titles you have good videos just stop it.
Oh man love you all and Thank you from old Army man  and just keep the videos coming ....
You guys rep UT very well
Love the content. Keep up the good vibes boys.
I love story time. :) This was a cool video. I'm excited for the future!
That was a great history story, I love it
I wished I could have you guys afford to have you guys repair my 24 valve truck it's a slug brand new transmission and it does does not have any power
Thanks
Great Story.   Gllad you told us  :)
I love all your videos bros
Look at the baby pictures..
It wasnt a failure It was a learning lesson What lifes about
HeavyD, Diesel Dave , that's  the  kinda  of  Wisdom (Work Edict)  sharring  One's  Drive  and  Determination and  Spirit that, goes  along way!  My   Older  Brother  says  Dean  hang  around  the Rich ! Hang  Successful   Positive  Ambitious   People   and  it  will  " Rub  Off"  on  you!  He just  Retired at  60yrs Old!  Half the  Kid's  are Millionaire's  now, all  Selfmade  Middle  Class  Kids  from the  early 1960!  Drive  and  Determination ( Never  Give Up)! HeavyD  and  Diesel Dave,   i   like   how   you  Guy's  " Pay it Forward"!  Dean (Soul) Toronto
What brand is the camo jacket he is wearing?
Thats what called making a vision come true. Been watching since day 1. Dont stop doing what you guys do!
Why you stopping give aways?
Ooray! Brother and fam forever !
I like how close you are to Rockwell where it started.
That opening shot of the truck just rolling in drive with yall walking in front of it👌visually amazing
"Let's buckle up before we get the seatbelt haters" -- I'm a seatbelt hater. I hate wearing them too.
I am a late comer to your video's found you when I was recovering from a lighting strike. you and matt from matts of road keep me going and seeing the stuff I wish I was able to do. as a veteran of two branches of service it was hard to stay down like i needed to long story short now I am starting my own business now your here giving me hope again. i hope someday i can thank you and matt.
Beautiful truck as always. Good luck to everyone who enters!!
I would love a truck built from them but in a theme of my Marine Corp time lot of years in recon
I'll clean the garage to park it next to its new brother the 3rd gen mega cab rusted rhino

I've got a 1997 T-bird with a V8 if anyone wants it for the motor and parts. The engine still runs.
Dam that hoodie is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!
I'm disabled veteran on fixed income so your merchandise is not in my budget but good luck with everything
I have always loved you guys and the things you build and do. Wish I could get a truck built by you guys one day. Happy Thanksgiving and God Bless.
👍👍👍👍
Dave sparks looks like buds twin when he didn’t have a beard
Humble, kind, helpful, empathetic, caring, and God fearing men are things that come to mind when I think of you and your crew. You all are amazing human beings, and you deserve the life you all have now after struggling but never loosing hope. May God bless all of your family's and I hope you guys continue until the end of your time making amazing videos for all of us to enjoy. Much love -Hunter
Thank you for sharing your past successes, failures, good, bad and ugly.....Also, you guys are always respectful, caring and thoughtful of others. You are enigmatic of the American Dream. Work hard, do your best, don't trample on others, lift up your community and help others.
The new thumbnail is 1000 times better.
Folks look at successful people and the end result looks easy, but those who have started something new know how rough the road can be.  Congrats on navigating the bumps, and persevering.
how come its the last truck?
Amazing story!!Ive always wanted to hear where it all started,or at least a bit of how it started!Thank you so much guys!!You are amazing! 🤩🤩 (18:20 btw,no BELT!Using the phone while driving! Its an outrage 🤣😂) (And the scam thing,dont bother answering this comment)
I run my own paint shop for 30 yrs ,broke down and out,And this kind of videos make many of us hold on to that dream.❤️❤️❤️❤️
Great video great story. Congratulations y’all.
Stop backstabbing your fans !
Very impresive story; you work hard and no one can take that away from you, you schould be very proud. greatings from sweden.
DP,  Please sell a heavy duty hoodie that says.....         .. "Good Things Come       To Those Who       Wait                     (at this point cross out wait and insert over it)       WORK FOR IT"    And, do some graphic stuff with the lettering.
I want that bad a## truck 💪🏻
What fun! Thanks for taking us through your journey.
Seriously a Land Rover for a couple years of work. Man you sure make it look great on video. TELL THE TRUTH. “Heavy D” is the fakest person ever. And like I said in my last comment I went to middle school with him. Sat next to him in class. He came from money. DO NOT LET HIM FOOL YOU. AND IT IS A SALES PITCH.
Where there's a will, there's a way...corny and simple phrase but you guys prove its a major truth.  Giving back to others in your generosity insures your future is blessed and bright....be like Rust, Rust never stops working!!!
On the topic of dpf’s I find it funny that they prevent particulates during everyday driving but it’s perfectly fine that they then release said particulates during a regeneration
Nice video guys. It helped to understand more of your guy's background. Newer knew anything of this, just thought you were kids from high money parents and born with golden spoon. Good job guys, you have made it well. Maybe this can be also example for others that you can do anything if you focus on it 100% and work your ass off. Hellos from Finland =)
Love you guys.   I've enjoyed your content for years... can't wait to see the next evolution.   I'll stay tuned.   Thank you.
Nikola Badger incoming? We will see
Merica
It’s a bummer 😢I love your videos and went to buy some sweatshirts and shirts but they only go up to 2xl and I’m a 4xl😢
The one thing dave leaves out is his parents. Happy Thanksgiving America!
Thank you for sharing that video Dave and diesel Dave just seeing where you guys started from and where you are now if you put your mind to you can do anything I just want to say thank you for all your videos and I just want to say stay safe have fun from your big fan in Papakura New Zealand big Matt
I remember a lot of these locations in your videos.
The coolest thing to me is you guy's friendship. God Bless.
Thank you for sharing your journey with us, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how hard and how far you all have come, hard work and a dream.  Happy Thanksgiving to all.
You lived the American dream!! You story is the American dream! The young generation doesn’t understand what it’s like starting with nothing and working your a$$ off to achieve your dream!🙏🙏
Heavy D I’m sure you have to say it for legal reasons but ROLLING COAL is nothing to be ashamed of and still cool and less harmful to the environment then any EV piece of 💩 they make today!! # defund the EPA
Hard work and dedication have payed off so far. I can feel for you guys, been there and have the shirts.
What an incredible story...!
The only people that say the American dream is dead aren't willing to work hard and take chances. If you don't believe in yourself nobody else will🇺🇲
Great video. Complete 180 from the "stolen" truck recovery pank. I was not a fan of that video but this one was awesome. I started watching much later, after the channel was established and after the Discovery show started. This was a nice look back that gave great context into your history.  Keep it real fellas. In my opinion, the videos are better that way. :)
Awesome !!
Great story !
Hi from Australia blokes.  Always awesome. Thank you fro sharing.
You do a great job making your videos love what you guys do
I apologize in advance for this rant, but it is something that I have to do as a truly homeless person. I will start this of with saying that i enjoy watching your videos. Now what I have to say is that you are miss representing what true homelessness is except where you were talking about Dave living in the office at some of your locations. True homelessness is where a person or small family has no place to live. I know this from personal experience as I am currently living in a homeless shelter. Your business being ' homeless' is another thing all together as many businesses when first starting out are are in the same position. They might start out in a small storage unit and then as they start to grow the will move to some place with a bigger footprint. Many businesses will do this till they finally get big enough that they have to buy a big enough piece of land to have as a premiant location with room to expand. Now that I have said that here is b brief explanation where I am coming from. I have worked hard ALL my life till about 4 years ago when I became unable to work any more do to old injuries and my girlfriend becoming unable to fully take care of her self which left me having to use up the money that was in my saving up till the day she died. This left me living in my van just parking where ever I could with having to go into public bathrooms to clean up everyday at one of the city parks. This continued on till I was finally able to get into a local homeless shelter where I'm at now.
i just ordered something from your store.  not so much to win the truck (though that would be nice) but to support you for all the good ive watched you and your team do.  keep being you.
Nice and a dp recap. Guess everybodys cought up now.
That is A Very  Nice Truck Dave.
Wait so they’re actually brothers 😮
I don’t like it when people put the flag on the back of the truck it’s just suspect to the people that died for it we should buy a sticker
@HEAVYDSPARKS thanks for this video,I drive by some these places, I remember the pizza places! Time flies, small world, love it!
Where did you make the patriot
is this a joke or what
There no close caption  sorry
Thanks for sharing your journey.  Inspiration, perseverance, a dream.. I first came across your videos around six months ago and have been addicted since. Love the builds and all of the insane equipment and toys. Of course all of the great friends and colleagues all the way that make it a family. I just recently turned 52 and have spent since the age of 12 doing ball busting jobs. Last 20 years for the same company Yankee Tree for the tree service industry.  Over the last year or so things have been in a major funk on the home front with the family and much more. So it seems like it's a time for change and new directions. Who knows what the future has in store but I've either lived in New England where it all started for my family or the decade I spent in Montana and a brief stay in Logan Utah.. Regardless, Cheers to a great future for all and keeping the American dream alive. Thanks for sharing all of the great memories and experiences.
Congratulations on the success I'm in the process of doing the same and videos like this make me want to get out there and do it even more starting from or with nothing is hard but not impossible thanks for the motivation
So, Dave, how about you lend me some cash, so that I can afford some merch, so I can enter and win, so I can sell the 24V to pay you back, so I don't have to live like Dav anymore.... Lol.  Love the vid's been following since bldg#7.... take care, and God bless you both.
Whistling diesel’s gonna get that truck!
Hey Sparks where was Daddy?
Him saying barley 100k miles sounded funny lol. You came really far. Great job man.  The last 6 years I've been working on changing my life. Dave should make a vid about his life , I really wanna know about his time in China.
I still have my 2002 F350 7.3L Powerstroke, 6spd manual, manual transfer case, manual locking hubs, manual seats, manual mirrors, manual windows/ locks.. It doesn't even have tilt or cruise. lol..  (I think it must have been a chassis truck, even when I bought it used, it didn't have a bed).  I put a 9ft flatbed on it (SRW), and it has well over 340k miles on it now and is still going strong.  It's a great truck, and probably one of the best trucks Ford ever made, at least as far as a work truck/ diesel tractor.   People are constantly stopping and asking me to sell it.
Ok so the key to success: know rich people that give you money until you become successful. Got it
I'm 30 mins in and its just so awesome to see how much ya'll have grown!
Nice to see your journey. Crazy but sweet, and hard work. Congratulations guys.
Out of diesel, into EV trucks
You guys are a true inspiration to all trying to make something big in this world,  can't wait for the next chapter!!
Interesting story but click bait title...
Love the video about your growth of your company one question does anyone know the brand jacket Camo and black with a hood where I can purchase one thx
I loved hearing your story. Thanks for the insight into your history and life.
So do You own the property that You are in Now? Or are You still renting it from Steve the Plumber.
That was a awesome story.Hard work does really pay off.
I have enjoyed you shows from New Zealand
Deam i want this truck so bad for my 18 Birthday but my dad wont let me by shirts or annything from  the internet. And that im never going to win annyway so thats blown. But love the vids ♥️ ❤️
How DID YOU MANAGE all the stress and possible ANXIETY that accompanies all this setting your Self up, starting over, grocery bills, will there be enough money.
back in their peachfuzz days
God bless you. Love your story, or stories 🤗. So proud of you.
Where's hunter?
Two Rad dudes and their Family's living the American dream! They just showed you that dreams come true! Never give up!
Progress is progress, just make it positive..
So how about this Dave.  I'll donate the same truck to y'all and you can build it for me anyway you want but I want it completely over the top on all the builds you've even done I don't care what it costs to build it I already have the truck the rest is up to y'all
I grew up watching you guys with my dad. Was a hell of a run
At what point did Dave move out of the office and get a house ?
You guy should be so proud of what you have accomplished. 😀👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
We need a truck like that because we are planning a big change in our lives. Selling as much as we can, buying a RV and moving to Arizona to be close to family. I can never hope to win something like that, but have enjoyed every video I’ve watched of you and your team. I’m a forever fan! Happy Thanksgiving to Heavy D and your team!!
You guys are the best👍Love the positiv attitude and how pro yall are🤘 By the way,i need that truck,really need it for a work..i take recovering addicts out for woodwork,metalwork,landscaping… Love the vids,have great day further😉greetings from Norway😁
I'm glad u made this video I always assumed u were working off of "daddy's" money now I know u are a self with friends team made man good on you keep it up man we love this content
that`s quite the story of success, all the best to you and the gang, and may your future be bright, fun, and profitable.
That baby picture is wild.
Very proud of you living the  AMERICAN DREAM
im not a big truck fan.... i have always like cars way more... but that really is a nice looking truck... that flat bed is sweet looking... i dont think i have seen a flat bed look as nice as that one...  i really like how you guys made the sides.... i like how its got box's but they are not just hideous square box's but they are like cut and trimmed up looking in order to look like a nice truck bed... i like that a lot it looks sweet... nice job building it!
Great video. Long hard roads are the most rewarding. God bless you guys.
Ok that was cool
Ah yes.  The usual story of some-one who is "an overnight success".  Years of hard work and sacrafice and then you are suddenly an overnight success!!  So much respect for you and your crew and what you do.  Live the dream!
Nice. Why are you renting though? Ownership would be so much better.
Is the camo jacket that Heavy D is wearing available on your website?
I love the channel, your team and the backstory.  Eight was enough!  Great truck and love the nostalgia.  Thank you 🥰
I love the story I've always followed you and I just wish I had n't had money so I could buy something to enter the win you know but unfortunately I don't

Your story is an amazing example of being determined to succeed. You are living proof for all the nay sayers that through hard work one can achieve their dreams. This video shows that nothing was handed to you.  Thanks for sharing and good luck for continued success.
Double Dave's 🤘
Heavy and Diesel, this was a great video for your guy's journey through till current day on going's.

Frickin’ amazing journey. That’s some blood, sweat and tears. Congratulations.
Why change the title of the Vod?
Anybody know what the red pannel at 31:54 says?
I was homeless living in my car in college during the summer in Eastern UT so I could save all my work money to make ends meet in school. I will never forget it or the lessons I learned along the way. I do not wish to repeat it or have other’s experience it.
Great story!

i'm watching your video from Italy and i can see the American Dream came true.
loved it loved hearing your story keep it up guys
ALMOST EVERYONE NEVER REALIZES THE STRUGGLES OF A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.  THANK YOU FOR DOCUMENTING YOUR HIGH AND LOWS OF YOUR SUCCESSFUL JOURNEY.
Don't get me wrong that owning this truck would be awesome But just to hear your story was worth more to me then any vehicle . I love to watch your videos I've never got into one of the giveaways this is by far my favorite video you've ever made . Way to go gentlemen you guys Rock !!!
I drove all over North Salt Lake, Bountiful and Woodscross in my 07 Chevy Silverado Duramax hoping you guys would pull me over and bling my truck out. I'll keep on watching HD And Diese Dave as long as you keep video taping
A great story that hasn't ended yet! Thanks for sharing!!
Great story answered alot of questions. Keep being true to your beginings
Starting to sound like you just got a new place…
You have been a inspiration to so many of us gear heads. Much love you guys rock.
I’ve been watching your videos for a couple years. I’m a used car mechanic. The market has changed and I’m living less than paycheck to paycheck.  I can’t afford to purchase any merch.  Could I please be  entered into the drawing?
Love the video guys god bless you cant wait to see the mind blowing stuff you going to do🙏🙏👌
I watch you and Emelia Hartford and others, Stradman etc… you all have stories about homelessness and food stamps and being down but not out.  You all say you fought and scratched and clawed… I’ve been fighting my entire life but it’s only ever felt like swimming up stream.  What do you say to someone that never had a win for all of their fighting, someone that wants to give up, a man that can’t find the motivation to get up and fight a losing battle.
The drive and persistence is amazing. You are an example of why our country is so great. Never give up and never give in. The willingness to fail is why you have been so successful. Love and much respect to all of you. Have no fear of the future because God always goes before you.
Crazy stuff on your life's trip. I think you may be a natural salesman, I bet most guys would have been tossed out on their butts. ,
Bravo Guy's you bring happiness to many and smiles to all whom watch you all!! Keep it up Disabled and trying to stay alive (53) in Vermont  USA 🇺🇸 😀 ♥️
whoever is holding the camera at location 4 should not be operating a camera. part was soo shaky it was unwatchable
this was really neat to watch! thank you as always.
Why does Dave look so sad the whole video 💀
Loved this!   Thank you so much for your story.  I think we all needed to see this.   Can't wait for the new projects.
I knew heavy D was a car salesman! He's got that fast talking salesman personality!
Question? So Is Diesel Dave still homeless. Or does he just look like he's homeless
I'm loving the Story cause I was homeless with Job Once  inspiring tells makes real American Dreams You Two and your Crew's show this is in Everyone of Your Video's Thank's for Sharing!!!; )
Fantastic video guys, love how you go way back and show and explain all the hardships that you had to face and overcome in becoming the guys and company that you are the only thing I would add to that beautiful truck would be a big Red and White flag of Canada
WOW I never gave you guys the respect that was due ! This definatly opened my eyes you and your crew worked hard to be a success.  Great story 👏
Matt is looking for a flatbed!!!
Such bullshit. You had parents with. Money. I know exactly who you are and went to middle school with you.
Epic episode
time for an even bigger beard !
Love your channel!❤

Always love learning the back story - thank Dave and Dave for a brillliant episode!
makes more sense that Dave is a glorified car salesman...  all smoke, mirrors and a load of BS.  Nothing is as it seems.
@0:42 😅 brothers? Mr gay USA 😂
The video opening reminds me of U2’s “Sweetest Thing”
An amazing story Heavy D😊 This should show people that we can have companies here in America 🇺🇸 Happy Thanksgiving to you and your families 😀😍
You guys are a huge inspiration! It’s been amazing seeing you guys grow and do all the things you guys have done. Side note: yesterday I saw that truck and thought maybe it was you guys but figured it wasn’t, I saw the Instagram post and was stoked it was you guys! Last night I saw the truck again while with my horse, just down the road from the shop.
Blessings from Proctor Minnesota on your new adventure!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
There's nothing wrong with rolling coal, you're feeding the trees, climate change is a natural cycle of the earth. Stop apologizing, the "climate crisis" is a scheme to bring people under a social-carbon credit score. It's evil, I don't know how y'all believe this
I don't ever win anything. Congratulations to whatever man wins it. I would just have 4 months to enjoy it. To give you a hint on what I'm GOING to do, there won't be an AWP to find me. So my long fishing trip will be totally permanent. I'm not somebody anybody will miss though.
Great picture of you guys…
You deserve the success. I wish I had the money or resources or friends with resources to help start a business. I hopefully one day will get there so my kids don’t have to work like a dog like me!
Awesome story!
I'm a 66 year old Vietnam Vet and I watch the things you do and you constantly restore my faith in people today.

I am still trying to get past the fact there was a time you all didn't have beards...The world no longer makes sense!
Am I seeing things or did they accidentally get a UFO on camera?10:45 or so beside Heavys hat on the right is something strange?!
You are actually the American dream.....   Great video Cyber hugs from the UK 🥰
Hey guys, im from the uk so no not after the truck, i just wanted to say i have watched you grow from the start and seen how much you have accomplished so enjoyed watching it all, what really stands out to me is the bond between you all especialy helping your fellow man giving support and great releif to others in great need, your faith shines through allways.

Great hearing how you got started. Well done for how far you have come as a team.
I hate this click bait shit
Thank you for sharing some of your life story with your YouTube family! “Influencers” can often seem to good to be true. It is nice to see that you guys are just like us and that the American dream is still possible through some good ole grit and facing each day with determination to make it better than yesterday. This life can kick us all and it’s not easy to get back up sometimes. Thank you, brothers!
Great story guys. God bless America. With hard work and good people around you anything is possible.
Just diagnosed with stomach cancer
It’s amazing to see the growth. And my life grew right along side you guys. Much love
Thank you for sharing life is always about learning and growing thank you for reminding us as always keep the videos coming!!!
Did you guys end up buying out the owner of your current home base?
You should make a video of all your original crew from day 1
You guys remind me of exactly me. It’s nice to know ya.
I enjoyed the history of you two and your journey
Thanks for the inspiration me and my buddy just started a small sheetrock business we've been doing good for about a year trying to save us enough to get us a good work truck
Had no clue what it took for y'all...Thank you everyone!!!
Literally the best truck you have ever made!!! Will definitely be trying to win this. You guys are an inspiration, thank you for the great content and sharing the struggle of success.
are you guys done for ever with videos
Thank you for the video, it was great. And you do live in the most beautiful place in the world..great scenery, great content,great people. Best of luck for the future!
I love ya!! Happy Thanksgiving!! You have a great friendship that's so hard to find you are very blessed and deserve everything that you have.  You are so generous and willing to help anybody out of a sticky situation.  Love you guys stay safe.
I wondered how you and Diesel Dave started. Your story is amazing! Thank you for staying humble and connected to the almighty! God bless to the Diesel brothers!
Hello, I have been watching your videos for a little while now. I am really enjoying this video in particular because I get to see a snapshot of what you've been through. With love, I would like to say that you can improve your breathing with a few vocal lessons. Please don't take this as a negative comment. It really isn't. It's a transfer of knowledge from one person to the next in the spirit of sharing.
Simply trying hard has made you into who you are today. Easy, right!?!? 😉🤘  I liked the first title better than this one. Is this video title doing better, than the OG??? It can't be... It isn't as good! Lol!
It's amazing how quickly you can over come adversity      my lowest was when I just had my oldest child     I had just dropped out of trade school very depressed jobless and living with my girlfriend's mom.....  5 years later I graduated that school I am married to that same woman with 3 kids a promising career happiest I've ever been and providing basically all the money for the house by myself       just keep pushing.    You can get wherever you want to go with enough can do attitude and persiverance
It's too bad a lot of people didn't like the stolen truck video, I thought it was super well done. You have definitely shown that you are not the type of reckless person to go into that situation without law enforcement. At least publicly and on camera. I am not going to sit here and say everyone should have known better. But.....
I have yet to ask or hear. Are you two business partners? Or just best buds?
Lmaoooo in the spirit of thanksgiving, but also you have to give us money to enter. S C A M. dont give your money to these fools
Go back and help the guy build his castle after the fire for now
What a life ! You guys got knocked down and you just kept going, thank you for sharing how it all came about, I had a good laugh at the fake it, till you make it 😂 That bus looked awesome as did the very first flat bed created 👍💖
Hate to see you guys leave.  Hubby and I loved watching your shows. 😢
Not many people can say a boob doctor stapled his head closed. One of many fascinating stories here. Keep up the good work fellas.
Thank you for taking us through your memories but please tell me you're not turning into electric vehicle people
Simply outstanding!
Honestly Dave and Dave, this was a great story!!  Perseverance, adaptation and great friends!!  That's is the way life should be!!   Thanks for sharing, but I am never getting over that pic of Heavy D with actual hair on the top of his head!!  As a fellow redhead, Diesel Dave nailed!!   🤣🤣🤣
The Roman Atwood podcast with heavy D and diesel Dave  has these story’s and the time heavy d accidentally took a handgun into Mexico 😂😂
Sharing your story is heartwarming.  I wish you a continued successful journey.  Stay well.
The pic of the silver stretched truck in front of a baseball stadium at 23:11 is at hammons field In Springfield mo my home town. Wonder what the story is on that.🤔
I liked the first thumbnail and title. This new one y’all just put up is chick hairy. The first one was inspiring.
I started out at the bottom..living in a tent in the woods.  Now I live in a small home that needs alot of work but Im as happy as can be living in it.
Pre 2007 before diesel gas went up over $5 a gallon
Awesome video rags to riches
Sorry but BORING!!!!!
Sounds like a Pretty easy road....
One Of The Most inspiring video's I have ever seen
You did the American dream started a business with your buddy and turned it into a national brand. You don’t hide your mistakes on recovery’s best of luck to all of you .. mad respect
You guys are actual living legends !!! Salute you all the way from Israel 🇮🇱🇺🇸
Location #4 was when I was introduced to y'all and the legends became legendary.
Keep looking forward and up, because the sky is the limit guys. God Bless you and your familys
The end of this was beautiful and sums up HeavyD and Deisel Dave.  HeavyD: "lets walk off into the sunset" Dave: "Uhh the sunsets that way" HeavyD: "ohh yeah the sunsets that way"  Great video!
One of the best if not the best video you guys have put out. Congratulations on your success it’s well deserved and no one can take that away from you guys. Keep on doing what your doing and make sure Jesus is always first in your life.
Incredible Ytube Channel 👍👍💪💪🇺🇲😎
Félicitation les gars vous avez travaillé très fort vous le méritez
31:54 - pssst.. Media guys, you missed one.
Get some recoverys  videos bro
is this a reupload with a different thumbnail?
Your kidding me no more diesel brothers and all the insane stuff you guys do your show diesel brothers was the best
THANKS GIVING AND BLACK FRIDAY ARE TWO OF THE WORST THINGS IN U.S HISTORY, BUT BRAINWASHED PEOPLE WHO DONT KNOW THE ACTUAL HISTORICAL FACTS OF THESE DAYS, THINK IT'S A GOOD THING AND FOR SOME BACKWARD REASON NEED TO CELEBRATE THIS TERRIBLE REMINDER OF HOW PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND SOLD.  By the way great show.
Loved this video….
My truck blew today. Its a struggle week after week. I just keep telling myself things will get better. Keep up the good work guys 🤙🏼
Heavy D and Diesel Dave youtwo were, are and always will be solid big hearted guys. Is the new branch S.A.R? It would be phenomenal  👏 😍
Let me guess Original title of how you went from rag to riches wasnt clickbait enough ?
Awesome content thanks for your time to do this video 📸
Thanks for sharing your struggle. 👍
You Guys ROCK! Christ Bless!
23:14 was that your Series 3 Land Rover?
You guys are fucking the best.
Way to be boys !!!  Making the Americans proud !!!

Awesome video. Wish you did timeline at each place. Keep the videos coming.
That is awesome truck
Great story love the truck would look good pulling the 5th wheel rv I want
Awesome.
Does anyone know what the latest is on the failed mystery power box that they said was going to be made right? Last I heard like a year ago they were going to automatically send stuff out to people that got screwed. I paid $80 for a baseball card  and a pair of socks that didn't fit.
Man thats a bad ass truck good job bros.
The American dream!
So you got ALOT of help in the beginning.  Youv'e been very blessed.
Outstanding journey! Julia and I have noticed that your organization has been taking the time to reach out and help people and give back when it has been possible to do so. We have a saying, that the Good Lord will judge us by what we do for other's out of no gain of our own. Continue with your journey and we will continue to follow you. Sincerely from the deepest part of our hearts.
Big love
You all going to sponsor some scuba divers that do search and recovery? Now THAT would be awesome!! 🙏
Just love this story. So proud of everything you've achieved. I hope you carrying on achieving your life's goals. Good luck and stay safe.
34 yrs on the streets, fate put me there but i stayed, a calling to care for n help the homeless while being one of them....been off the streets 5 yrs now.....working on getting some money together to start a new project to buy a farm as a sanctuary for the homeless, using animals to heal
Hell of a journey my friends, anything is possible, best of luck on the future.
Certified Legends
What a heck of a story. Would love to sit down and here the complete story of the difficult journey you guys have had.
We should all be focused on our dreams and grow from our mistakes along the way as they are great learning tools.  You drive is so great and so is your problem solving.   I have a problems solving brain and persistence too but on a much lower scale then you.  I enjoy your channel and everyone seems so giving and nice.
As a disabled veteran and cancer survivor, I want to thank you for keeping me intrigued and inspired during my recovery. Thanks for all you do.
I like that part: "I lied and said we could, turned out we could." love it. <3
You guys are so amazing. What a journey. And y’all are killing it!!  And I hope I can win this truck. It is absolutely beautiful. And with a beautiful story.  I would have to ad a wheelchair lift to it Amd a ladder to get my short but in the truck. Lol. Y’all have an amazing day. Looks forward for  more amazing content!!💜💜
I was bingeing your channel and I've been thinking for the last few days 'Where did these guys come from?' Amazing and very inspiring! Your story lends credance to the old saying "Today's mighty oak is just yesterday's nut that stood it's ground!"
Loved the video keep up the brilliant work i loved getting to see/hear about the history of your company very heart warming so keep up the amazing work
Please keep going on YouTube and keep going with your rescuing vehicles rebuilding bulldozers
Thanks for the walk down memory lane on how u got to where u r today.
Congratulations on bulding all this up. Its the Real Americam dream. (I'm in the UK)
Awesome
Respect
Best video yet!! I love hearing the history on on things that I love and I love all your videos! I started watching at the first Diesel Brothers episode on discovery and from that time I’ve been hooked! Just like you guys I too have a dream to build amazing things but I’ve just been struggling to get anything going… I know it takes skill and I think I’m pretty good at most things I try, but it does take a little bit of luck also and I’ve never been someone who has much good luck. I’m hoping that starts to change going into the new year.
Hey D bro’s, appreciate your kindness and awesome work ethics. Looking forward to working with you y’all some day ☮️
Great Job as always....good Luck and many more years....
Honest hard-working guys remind me of my dad ❤️🦃🦃🦃
My friend had a Rotorway chopper. This was in 1988 when thy first started. He got certified and built them from kits. We had two in the garden for a while.
I've been waiting for this video since I first started watching you guys
Dave looks like liver king before the liver fetish haha
Awesome , simply Awesome . way to hang in there brothers.
God Bless you guys
Great video now we know what was in the past thanks for a great video
Great video. Ya'll have been blessed for all your determination and hard work. Nice truck.
I actually thought the red truck fiasco was fun, you could tell it was a ploy, still fun stuff! Compared to other times where it's way to serious and lives are lost or could have been lost, need a little blast out once in a while, that's what I have enjoyed and watched you guys for years, is the crazy goodness! Keep up the fantastic work.
After the 23 Nov. I will be broke and homeless in Morocco.
WOW! What a journey. I have to tell u that my brother who was a Vietnam Veteran was buried with your DP patriotic shirt 5 years ago. We bought him your shirt and he kept it in pristine condition. Was a diesel mechanic too. I L❤️VE u guys and I hold a special place in my heart for u. Continue to do great things! ✊🏽🪶
Thank you for sharing your story with us and bringing us along on all of your adventures!  I am so Happy for how far y'all have come and the things that have been done!
I love you guys! Thank you for sharing your stories with us!
Dam I'm from. The UK so no chance for  me be cool sir Dave and Dave x
Dave and big D bad ass boyzxxxx
Just a quick praise from an autistic 39 year old Dutchy.. Sorry if awkward xD  From the bottom of my heart I thank you guys, your friends, familie, co-workers and everyone that's like you, for being you. Keep being the great and positive influence that you are. I think I can talk for everyone when I say, I Love You Guys :)
I went to UTI with a guy in 2013 or 2014 and he had the US 12 VALVE truck. It was either the original or a good replica build. I always remembered seeing it in the parking lot
@HeavyDSparks amazing story, also missing you guys at 2.5hours of Le Mullets. know you guys are super busy.
Diesel Dave has a chin?!?
y’all are 🗑️🗑️ i can’t stand dave
I must have missed something.  What exactly is changing?
I dont want a truck I want ya;all to make more $$$
Great story, a few tons of hard work and lotsa drive. Love it. BTW, technically, it's not a give away. When you buy something to enter, it's more of a raffle. Still, a great opportunity.
CONGRATS!!! you have earned it!!!!
I hope not end for you guys keep going keep up good job guys
I enjoyed every second! I am proud of you guys! Never give up on your passion in life! This is why I watch your videos and I watched the show as well. God bless and keep on keeping on! Love ya all!
Gona miss you guys are a inspiration   to me ❤❤❤
Incredible journey.  You really had a difficult time.  I am so very proud to have learned about your journey.  Thank you for posting this video.  I cannot afford to buy your merchandise but I love you guys.
I find it fascinating that you pretty much started out with English Land Rover Disco's.... I'm English...and I just love the Japanese things...Suzukis, Toyotas & Mitsubishis.... yep...the 4x4's.... I had one English one...a Range Rover...the most unreliable expensive money pit ever....well it was for me...maybe I had a special edition piece of junk....but that one piece swayed me back to Japanese .... and Japanese imports!
Non aligned media object??
The last 10 years has been a trip for everyone- awesome so humble and kind 💚 Thanks for sharing 🇺🇸
You’ve got an awesome journey. You’re loved by so many. You’re blowing my mind. Heading over to buy another bunch of stuff. By the way everyone, the quality of they’re the shirts is amazing. I love mine.
Thanks Guys, for sharing Your story. I have only been subbed for a few months, and at first thought You were just a couple of spoiled rich kids- Amazed and impressed to find out differently. Love Your energy, best wishes for even greater things for You.  Thanks for sharing.
What happened to the power boxes? Been waiting forever for my box.
Very cool story and history. Thank ya much
I find your story encouraging.  I've watched you on other channels as well and yall certainly let us know to follow our dreams. Thanks
Why the last?
the video with rolling coal in the bathroom..such a epic video.
I loved the stolen truck video! In fact this was an incredible video, thanks for sharing! Amazing!
Inspiring.
"Let's buckle up so the seat belt haters.." BET
Good luck to everyone that wins 🏆 👍. Love ❤️ watching y'all
Beautiful story! Nice to know how you started 👍👍keep up the good work
What a truly great story working your way up from nothing to what you have now. You guys are awesome keep up the good work
Daddy always said "God won't let us go hungry, as long as we keep trying"  proud of you and your success. Keep climbing up.
Why the last one?
Amazing story!! Kind, generous people! 🤍
Shoutout to TJ Chapman!!
Sisu Nasu is kind of a copy of the Hägglunds.
Love the show and the awesome stories behind your careers I have a 5.9 Cummins 12 valve 1996 dually with 1.3 million miles on her she needs work but I'm sure I could still fire her up and go across country great job
As someone who is struggling to stay afloat with a small family business, it’s not easy to run so your success is well deserved boys.
God bless
Y'all are amazing and very humble! Appreciate you both! Great video and another tough looking truck. It'd be a great truck to own, but it's honestly too much truck for me. At my age and "abilities", there's parts of it I'd never use and what a freaking shame that'd be! I wish everybody luck on it though! A truck worth owning!
🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁💚🏁 US12 🎯🛠️🦾
❤ Loved hearing your journey from the beginning because I only happened upon this channel via Matt’s Off Road Recovery about 6 months ago. Keep on sparking!
You are proof hard work pays off in the end.
You both have come a long way you've been blessed. Keep up all the marvelous work you do. I was surprised to see what you both look like without your beards. Happy Thanksgiving to you and all your staff and your families.
Although I can't join or purchase you items, my husband and I enjoy you and your crews videos of joy, fun, generosity and love. Ty. ♥️🇨🇦
What a fantastic trip! Really interesting in where you came from and I look forward to seeing what happens next 👍🏽
Can someone make a synopsis of this please? I cant sit through the whole 50 minutes of this
That 2nd gen was epic
Don’t understand the red screen around 32:00
But I love you guys ❤️
Thanks for sharing your story. I used to live in West Bountiful, and I've driven past every single one of your locations. It's cool to know the history now.
Seat belts please
That was very inspirational all the obstacles you have overcome! I pray this happens to me in my journey’s to come.
frucking gay
hp hi
click bait
Great Video!!
Loved this video!! You worked your butts off for what you have!! And you have used your profits to help others! That is why I just love you guys and continue to watch all your videos. The world is turning more and more greedy and dim. But you make the light shine through in a way that makes my heart happy ❤
"Homelessness" I've learned is more of a state of mind more than a living situation. I've been homeless without a home and I've been homeless with a homes. I just wanna be happy and I can't just buy that.
I’ll fly with you anytime Heavy D anytime in the BlackHawk
u guys fuckn rockn ROCK
That's what I've been waiting for. From Rags to Ritches. Good job telling the story of hard work & good friends stayed together throughout a successful business.
Very impressive!
Thank you for sharing.   Having started and sold one business, and having started another which I closed due to circumstances beyond my control I understand how difficult it is to build up a successful business.   Hearing how you started, and seeing where you are is an awesome experience.   thank you.
Why is is trying to make this to seem like some type of struggle story you had it good dawg matter fact great from the start my guy I’ll show you a struggle Fr what the trenches like Fr
Awesome Story! It's always awesome to hear how company became to be what they are today. Also i love your videos, keep up the awesome work, cool projects and videos!
I just wanted to say thank you for making my days alittle better. Let me explain I am a Veteran with terminal lung cancer and the bone pain from the chemotherapy is out of control. But watching and dreaming of just once going on a adventure that you all do would be a great bucket list achievement.  Well thanks again for all you do and Happy Thanksgiving to you and your families.
Yo I rode that bus to Homecoming '12 Bountiful high!! That's sick!!
Great story, thanks for sharing, very inspiring!! America!!
This story. Makes me happy for you all of we live in a wonderful world you have made it. And you give so much back. Thanks keep up the very good job.
Thanks for sharing your journey with us guys. I’m trying to get my business going and seeing how you guys started from nothing helps keep me motivated to work harder and not give up. Looking forward to seeing what big plans you have next.
Did he say the last Diesel they're ever giving away?!?! Whaaat?! Honestly my entire life people have always told me that I have such a good and giving heart yet I caught a lot of bad breaks in my life. I don't expect anything in return for helping people, but all I was hoping for was maybe a little good karma?! Never seemed to happen, always felt like the crapy people were the ones getting ahead in life   - You guys have at least shown to me that good things do happen to good people, just takes a lot of work and perseverance. You guys are truly amazing people and deserve all the success you have created for yourselves and your families! Stay blessed! 🖤
Your drive along with your work ethic are most impressive.  I wasn’t aware of your television show.  Thanks for sharing!
Men of faith!Men of victories!Our LORD Jesus Christ is proud of you guys, congratulations both of you❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏
Nothing is a failure in life 😇 only a lesson and it's if you see the lesson which leads to taking a step in the right direction, which you did 😁..🙏 Awesome video Thank You
Man what a story but I never doubted there was that type of a start to diesel bros!!
What a great story brother, really enjoyed watching it
Great Story of Progression and Success. Keep doing what you do Best...Awesome Job.👍🤙✌️

Proof that the American Dream is still possible!!! Just work for it!! APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE
I just got some entries for the truck, coffee for me and a present for my son.  Great coming up story.  Your kindness overwhelms me at times.  I, as a 60 yr old woman who loves to work on anything, really enjoy your vids.  Keep it up and bless you all.
Does the flag pole and flag come with it
I worked for Tri Star the company in Evanston Wyoming that gray bus came from. Video blew my mind. 🤯
I'm only into this video 5 minutes...and I already need KLEENEX.  I have 3 words that I'm going to say now.  And I'll bet I'm not too far off at the end. ♥️♥️♥️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸♥️♥️♥️. SO MUCH RESPECT!!!!
Im waiting for my tax return 2023..pay off my $2,000 dollars off of credit cards. And get a loan cash$ for a van and detailing tools.. start vlogging hobby my passion for detailing
Not being a YouTube premium subscriber video was continually interrupted by Okay beauty product ads. Good fit? Of course! Fits with a beauty of a story😁 Having first adult business before receiving drivers lic at 16. Have win & failed over the yrs. Can empathize with some of hard lessons you learned along the way
@HeavyDSparks brother I didn't realize that your first place was my first place, just after you guys. I rented storage sheds back there, I learned so much watching Martin with Jah Collision and I painted many of my first cars in the professional booth there. By 2010 or 11 I was there. TJ Chapman. *cough* shady guy Rory that was in your building next door after you, not sure if you had bad dealings with him..
Closed captions please. :)
AKA EASTSIDE TERRI AN TERRI VALKO PUD MOINES Well told guy unless he brings the black GMC to my door won't send a dime unless Western Union. Or have Dave Video call me (Hey Dave) so i will know it is true. I see you are busy though God i really needed that truck. Ripped my heart out. I just cant get a break. Even said id come there an get truck. Nope. SO DAVE IT'S A SCAM ISN'T IT? IR DO THEY REALLY HAVE A TRUCK FOR ME FOR HELPING WITH THESE SCAMMERS. NOOO THOUGHT NOT. LOVE YOU GUYS AN WILL NOT STOP TRYING TO KEEP THESE SCAMMERS BUSY SO TO BUSY TO RIP OFF SOMEONE ELSE. SEND YOU MORE SCREEN SHOTS SOON
I love this family, you all keep me going, you'll never know how much you've done for me and us!!!
Absolutely made my day guys! It's been great to hear your humble story 🙂
where can I someone from denmark find all of the seasons of diesel brothers
Thank you so much for sharing your journey with us. Your hard work and dedication has paid off.  You are truly blessed. And a big thank you for all you've done and continue doing. God bless you ALL ❤️ 🙏
A successful business, is built on the steps of failure. A successful person, is reflected by how other see the real you, I.E. trustworthy, loving, respectfulness. Just in my opinion.
I remember when you started. So much has happened since then. So nice that you are getting really well known. God bless you all.
Thanks for sharing this story brothers! Happy Thanksgiving!🦃
Let's goooooooooooooooooooo
The only thing that would have made this better is for the two of you to shave the beards to reenact the younger you photos.
Count your many blessings !!! Good choices an good luck have favored you !!! I enjoy your antics !!! I've gotten so far behind and with my health I can't even afford a vehicle !!!
That hagglund is build in sweden and the sisu nasu is build in finland
Still waiting for my free truck 5 plus  months
Heavy D Sparks with all you both been through years of from nothing to what you all have actually achieved now Is truly a great Blessing and you are blessing others as well and for that is the joy and happiness that no one can take away from you and have a Great Happy Thanksgiving day
Thank you for sharing.
The clickbait is so bad
This a great story of perseverance and drive. You guys have come a long way. Frickin awesome man!
You're amazing every day you came a long way congratulations on your journey I'm very eager and knowing how to get this truck you said their giveaways
I remember my uncle in his early years running Peninsula Towing on Vancouver Island. As a little a little kid hanging out with him were some of the best memories. At his shop, tow yards, and houses. My mother was a part of the dispatch crew, and my father helped him a lot with heavy wrecks up the Island highway. Still to this day he's killing it, also has bought a few wreckers off of Jamie Davis.  Thanks for the story guys!
The 5th place is where I first started whatch you
good for you guys😀
Sir Heavy D, most dug deep and lived a hella life! I'm 1 of them, not single by choice, my husband committed suicide in 2014, since that day I'll never be the same, BUT i came out the ashes a i do smell like a Water lotus, my kids are my fuel. Most of us been are lowest, it's ok cause it makes u Stronger than a Empire State Building!! Period!🤘💝 Thank u for yr story.
Always wondered what segment of this journey would have been the coolest to be a part of, but seems like you always kept things wild and crazy and I’m really pleased with the timeframe I was involved in with you. Thanks for having me as a part of the journey and I’m excited to see what you do next!
CRAZY
You didnt show us any of the last location :(
When you state that you had no money, but you had a dealership...you had money. When my dad disowned me at 18 yrs old I literly had no money. Had to live with my cousin for a few weeks , got a job at 7-11 , was held up at gunpoint twice at work. Now that was a tough begining.
I'd do anything just to work for y'all
Did you trust God
0:40 Error 404 - Beard Not Found

Hell Ya American Dream !!!!!!  You guys are amazing !!!  Truly inspirational !!!!
Thank you for sharing this love from Europe balkan Kosovo love you're videos brother
I'd love to win that Beast!
I cherish my friends like this. As my Dad says we will not be around forever so cherish the friends you have and support them emotionally. So proud of how far you came and the support you give others  Your videos are truly uplifting and this one was special because it showed us who you truly are that you also worked hard to get where you came from.
Love, so much love.
Hearing this inspires me on so many different levels and makes me really look at myself and think I shouldn’t give up because I’m currently homeless working on starting a buisness out of my suburban struggling between having space for tools or space for a cot. I’ve been homeless trying to make a name for myself for almost a year now.
Great story. Also cool you have lifetime friends
What a good video to show people that you have to work for your dream ,❤ it .
That truck is badass but times are tough and I can’t buy anything but will support by watching and waiting for new content. Have a wonderful week
Thanks for all you guys do. Hard work pays off the way it should.
The fact that you guys have over 2.5 million subscribers is a solid testament to your abundance of good will, generosity and professionalism. BRAVO ZULU!

Awesome truck!
I wish I could be one that can afford to buy something to get that truck but right now I can’t afford anything. But go back and forth to the doctor about my brain tumor I have so I’ll I can do is watch your video. I’m a volunteer firefighter here in my home town in Jasper, Alabama and right now I can’t even run calls with them because I have headaches that heard my eyes
One of the best feel good videos I've seen in a while.
The title of your book: From homeless to helicopter: the diesel brothers story……👍👍

HeavyD and David Sparks there is something else U CAN MAKE MORE $$$$$ on U just know dont it and I would be the first to buy
My god that truck is gorgeous, true craftsmanship 🤘🏽
Hell of a story guys
HeavyDSparks. My dad, Jack (RIP) had this absolutely great title for his memoirs. Watching you walking down that road telling us about this reminded me so much of him and his title: The Ins and Outs of the Up and Downs of a Down and Out.
Not giving away anymore trucks
A little overkill with the U.S flag.
U said u had nothing and nobody helped you.. You got married that cost alot of money.. And was given a great partner to lead the way. Nothing to me means living in a tent without a dollar. Not eating for days at a time...
Great Story.
I am getting old and I am poor...just another reminder of what I dont have ! Please give me a break dear lord !
Ditch the DSLR's and get yourself a GoPro.  You videos will be 100% less shaky.
HeavyDSparks at 2:40 you are telling us that this is the last truck you are giving away ........ my question is does this mean you are stopping your subscriber give aways because i have not seen any videos of those give aways in a very very long time
Podcast recap video
Bad ass guys good job doing such a good job on all your projects and rescues thank u for being such good guys
is this all lies like that stolen truck video. im not watching. zzz
Oh my I would love that truck!!!
This is why I nominate YOU for President of these  F.... Up          UNITED STATES of AMERICA...
I want to see a benefit video of you guys and Mr. Beast together.
You look like wee man🤣🤣 in your younger days
Definitely motivating especially being in the thick of it
I love this vids
Wishing I could win this truck or similar 😫 😩
Just more clickbait
Great timing!
Been there. Was homeless with a daughter and a dog. Living out of my Avalanche. Yet threw perseverance. I am where, I am today. Keep kicking out ur videos.  I love to watch.
Congrats 👏🎉 y'all bro on ur video too i watch them all d time from beautiful Belize central America bro

you guys look so weird in the pictures without beards LOL. Congrats guys.
👍👍
Nice truck huck..
I  love you guys. Really upset though. Was told getting a new truck for helping with scammers. Wouldn't charge1000 like said said could send 300. Would not let me send Western Union. Had to borrow that. Wanted a Seam card or something  Emailed one of y'all an y'all said probably scam. So sparks motor sent pic of inside of truck an all the guys. But I finally told them if they will bring the black or dark blue GMC I WOULD HAND HIM THE MONEY OTHERWISE HAVE DAVE VIDEO CALL ME SO I WILL KNOW IF ITS TRUE. NEVER EVER ONE ANYTHING ALL I EVER GET IS SCAMMED. I REALLY WAS EXCITED.  But with my chit happens chromosome I knew I could never win ANYTHING. TRYING TO GET MORE INFO OUT IF THEM  PLEASE STOP THESE GUYS. RIPPED MY HEART OUT. I GET 840MO SO REALLY HURT TO THE BONE. OH WELL THATS WHY WHY WRITING BOOK  "The Life And Hard Times Of Woah PHUQ" maybe one day will be published an you all can read my one hell of a life. Lol. You guys are still my favs. No scam is gonna turn me off from you guys about the only real men left these days
I like the camouflage hoodie Dave's wearing..👌
When u first stated  I wanna link with u guys
Dude it's scarry how Diesel Dave looks fully different with no beard and full hair line.
My mother and I recently got flooded out from Hurricane Nicole. I'm a vet and going through tough times right now. Trying to find a place to live isn't easy. My vehicle isn't in the best of condition either. I watch all your videos.
Hey guys I called and spoke to you about the duece 1/2 trucks I’m in California building them here do you remember
Di Nashville Tennessee Rumah Klasik🏡 Saputra Maulana Kepala Sakit, Minum, Obat, Tidur-Tidur, 🤕🛌🏻💤😴🥛💊 Maaf, Maafkan Aku, Sayang-Sayang, 🙏🏻

HEAVY D FOR PRESIDENT LOL
I am Been to hell and back I beat addiction and now take care of my disabled my mom and stepdad I take care of my 3 year old and  my girl I don’t make good money at all we live check to check my wife works her ass off when I stay home helping my family we lost my baby brother a year ago and just wish we could have one more minute with him it kills us himand my mom shared a birthday. But I am struggling trying to get everyone Christmas gifts or even to have a Christmas  it’s so hard on me and my girl and I don’t know what to do and wanna give up and  gotta keep fighting. God bless u guys and coming from nothing
Life. IS. One Hell of a Story 👍🏼.  But Keeping Focused!
Hi
Sounds like you guys were determined and your hard work was blessed by God. Love your channel.Truck's cool but what I'd really like to win is a ♿.
That's what makes this country so great, start with nothing, work determination and grind, and can accomplish anything, I was same and I now have way more than what my parents ever had.
Wow so inspirational seeing where you've gotten in life. Thank you for all the amazing content and helping people in need. You deserve all that good that's come your way!
I’ve seen something like this on this channel before
You guys deserve everything that you have right now. You worked for it and I wish you all the luck in the future.
I enjoy watching you guys . I’ve been homeless for two years since hurricane Sally wiped me out and watching YouTube and the miracles done for others has pulled me thru. I finally was able to rent a place but even with my Va loan my credit will never be good enough to buy my own place. At sixty that makes me very sad. But thanks for giving us feel good things to watch! Love you D!
Why no blackjack stuff
👍👍👍
Heavyd idk if you will see this but I hope you do. You shoutry to make a goliath tank mine. I'm suggesting it because it can be like a heavy duty mobile toolbox. + it's like a mini tank and as a we all know how you like ur military stuff. You could possibly even put in a battery starter type thing?. If not that you could make it like the worlds cheapest car. Idk it just seems like something you all would have fun building and doing.  You could even try and make it anfibius  if you want. I can see you'll using it as a give away thing or use it to decide give away by putting a seat on it to spin get dizzy and throw darts at a balloon 10 to 25 feet away
It’s a good day when a new video comes out!
DERP
This is probably the earliest I've ever been
Thank you for sharing this ❤️ Humble beginnings and still humble  🙏🏼🇺🇸
Pre beard Daves! Lol. Nice.
🤔
