It will be a great disaster if you die without Lord Jesus Christ (Mark 8:36). Hell is a place of eternal torment! “The smoke from their burning pain will rise forever and ever. There will be no rest, day or night. Is Neither you Repent or you perish. Repent, confess your sin to GOD through JESUS CHRIST and receive JESUS as your LORD and saviour.   A repentance prayer: Prayer of salvation   Heavenly and Almighty God, I come before you humbled and sorrowful, aware of my sin, and ready to repent. Lord, forgive me for I have sinned before you. Wash away my sin, purify me, and help me to turn from this sin. Lead me to walk in your way instead, leaving behind my old life and starting a new life in you. JESUS I accept you as my Lord and saviour and TODAY I want to make you the LORD of my life. I choose nothing but you and your ways ONLY. In YOUR MIGHTY name AMEN.  Reply and I will you send my snap or insta we can discuss further 😊💕 I L O V E Y O U and so does GOD- the ONE seated ABOVE ALL✝️

I have some questions for you NAIJA MUMUS! 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨 If omonaija is so great that you folks are so proud of then why do you people feel the need to constantly FLOCK AND FLEE to everyone else's country all over this planet only to totally disrespect the citizens and try to dominate their country and moreover WHY do you people always feel the need to push and shove your tribes, cultures, lingos, swags, food, clothing and every damn thing else that's pertaining to your country down people's throats and force people to accept that 🐂💩 just to try to impress them?? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
I love davido check out my new single https://youtu.be/036LO1FkPdc

Davido
Did anybody else notice how Davido sucked his teeth after hugging somebody I just love his energy
😍😍😍😍 Davido is very generous. After his training he meets a neglected and underprivileged young musician to whom he supports 😥. His song is making headlines everywhere. Let's give strength to this young talent from Africa 💪💪🔥🔥👉 https://youtu.be/DSsp-TtrTaU

The visual quality of this playback is deteriorating. Is it the servers, cloud storage or original video quality shoot? Fix this. This is a 100M views hit...but at 11M quality is deteriorating.

Thumps up to those who agree with me that Davido x Focalistic never disappoints .This is a mad tune. 💯
King Davido is bigger than music, all he does, is to fish out hidden talented artists, bring them to limelights. Then wizkid will have the opportunity to pack all of them to 02  arena to show off. If Davido turn his back on them like wiz kid does, who will he carry to London... Oga na Oga.
Representing the punjabis who love this vibe
NICE YOUR VIDEO

Factos 👀👍
Davido to the world 2022 is our year 30 BG who dey check am   #DMWTOTHEWORLD2022
This is my honest evaluation of this music video.  The instrumentals is the only thing I loved about this video. For me, this goes to the bottom list of all Davido's music vids. I didn't like the song to be fair. Of course, it's my opinion and am entitled to it. Lastly, the positive about the video and what I have seen is that he(Davido) is trying to help other new artists get to the top which doesn't happen all the time. So credit to him. I love Davido, but this Song for me personally, is a thumbs down 👎👎👎👎. Bless y'all
The bit been giving joy 💃💃💃🔥❤️
from tanzania davido your unstoppable big up bro
Super🔥🔥
davido be droping BANGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I started listening to Davido in 2016... this dude is one of the most consistent African Artists and one thing that sets him apart is that he keeps RE-INVENTING himself. He won't lock himself up into a genre box, he understands how rich and diverse African music is and he makes sure to EXPLORE ALL OF IT.

Wonder where this video was shot
Wen u see Nigeria/SA collaboration,just know that SA will handle the beat while Nigeria will handle the vocals.SA/Nigeria,africa's best collaboration...love from Zambia.
Rubbish music. Even the singers wouldn't remember their own lyrics in a year. Neither will any of them dancing there
Found my self singing "Ska bolele thata ra e kutswa" without knowing wat it means
❤️❤️❤️❤️
At this point, rappers like lars 32 are better off doing amapiano if Focalistic gets such a feature so early in his career
Focalist understand something you gotta share with your african brotha to get big in the game its a fact
If you think Davido is lit, you're right but if you think Focalistic is also lit then you're also right. #AfricaPower
Davido has helped a lot of African Artists,Big up to the Baddest

Thanks Davido for schooling South Africans about investing in your music video. Artistry. 🇿🇦🇳🇬

Make person nor like this beats reach me abeg oooh🤔🤔🤔
No joke Davido is the biggest artist in Africa 💯   But the disrespect some of y’all Nigerians are having on Amapiano claiming y’all made it international is crazy and annoying considering the fact that Amapiano has been international without y’all 💯💯💯 Our artists have performed in the UK, Sub Saharan African and other Southern African countries outside SA 💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥  Plus u can check the trending list of this weeks trending music  Top 30 and 17 songs are amapiano and only 1 Nigerian song.   Y’all need to chill But yes Davido is the biggest African of all times💯💯💯💯
Only David came into the industry with tag BADDEST almost 11 years after nobody don challenge that tag him na BADDESTTTT🔥
Baddest 🔥❤️
interesting one

Moz🇲🇿 listening,Davido u never disappoint my homie  God bless u n shoutout to everyone watching this beautiful video SA🇿🇦 Naija 🇳🇬sisonke inja zami
Legend sound OBO ♥️💯
There is something about focalistic and amapiano sound he has to sing it in south Africa language for you too feel the vibes davido really understands that's man gave him 70 % of the song for him to sing . To much English or pidgin English could have spoilt the song
Did I just hear Harare ?
Anyone reading my comment will be Rich, Famous and Happy. Please type AMEN if you read and claim this prophesy
Thank you for an amazing experience 🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽
I am #Obenai and I fully endorse this song. I pray it gets to 400 million views very soon . Can I here a big AMEN from anyone reading this?
I was here before 400 million views.
Cool Song 👍🏾
Squad sa maradona
OBO no worry,you be 001 for life no mate❤❤💖
Whoever made this beat 👏🏾😮
It's not that complicated is it? Our bad choices sometimes get us to places we don't want to be, just as sin takes us away from God but you know what? God still loves you more than ever, can all your clothes be dirty and you burn them? No! I guess. So forget the past today and come back to God through Jesus Christ his son who died for those sins already. If your answer is YES! Please say this prayer: Lord Jesus, I now confess to You all of the wrong and sinful things that I have ever done in my life. I ask that You please forgive me and wash away all of my sins by the blood that You have personally shed for me on the cross. I am now ready to accept You as my personal Lord and Savior. I now ask that You come into my life and live with me for all of eternity. Jesus I now believe that I am truly saved and born again. Thank You Jesus.

💥💥💥👊🏾
Madddd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Video too neat
🤟🏽💚❤️
❤❤
Nice music no doubt. But in my option, that drum beats starting as 1.25 seconds is a distraction. Also, I think that Davido's part with "Away now..., Take me away... Far far away....K'ose farawe...Light me up go far away... " should have been repeated,  at least one more time. All the same very nice melody, great vocals. Infectious. I can't stop putting it on repeat.
Control here 😎😎😎  May everyone listening to this good music see 3030 and beyond #amapiano 🙏🏽❤️🥶🥰🔥🎵🇬🇭🇬🇭🇿🇦🇳🇬... Feeling the song like 🤐🥵😊

For information sake,Focalistic is not the first South Africa to break into Nigeria music space. Hugh Masekela was,then followed by Vyonne Chaka chaka and Lucky Dupe. Nigerians familiarity with South Africa music is before Apartheid was dismantled.

But she increased her speed.  I was chasing my wife  with a red candles in my hands and i didn't even know.😂 Our new neighbours saw my wife zoom passed them in a flash.

Compelled by this recent development, i decided to spice my own love and romance life before my wife starts feeling somehow about us.😂 I came back home to meet my wife in the kitchen. She had her wrapper tied to her breast as usual. I slowly tip toed passed her, heading for our bedroom.😂 I walked into our bedroom, and dressed the bed. I changed the white bulbs to red. I scattered red and white flowers on the floor, and arranged red candles round our bed, placing some candles in the centre of the rug carpet.😂 I pulled off my cloth and wore a white and red trouser to match with the moment.😂 I was still arranging the bottle of wine and bouquet of flowers in a small bucket, when my wife opened the bedroom door to see every where in red. Ooooh My God!!!!! So you are now a Ritualist .' my,  (wife shouted.) Before i could say a word, she opened the door and zoomed off. I chased after her to explain. 'Babe, i can explain, please stop!' i shouted as i ran out shirtless with just my red and white trouser. But she increased her speed.  I was chasing my wife  with a red candles in my hands and i didn't even know.😂 Our new neighbours saw my wife zoom passed them in a flash. Moments later , they saw me with a red candle and red trousers running towards them.  On seeing me, they removed their shoes and ran out of the gate, running after my wife as fast as their legs could carry them.... Now, my wife's family and I, have gathered for over 2hrs now.

Kenyans let's gather here for Davido🔥💯
😂😂😂😂😂😂 Please can you help me tell my parents that I am not a witch, am only practicing witchcraft. This is what happened,' yesterday night around 11:50 pm in the night I was trying to sleep but sleep don't want to catch me, I was looking for what to do to keep me busy. The worse is that my phone battery is dead and my mother is with my phone charger 🔌  You know that an idle mind is a devil's workshop. I started thinking about Nollywood movie how witches do their meeting. I decided to practice it. I swear to God, I made sure that my parents were sleeping. I peeped in their room and saw them snoring. I immediately entered my room, I thought I locked the door 🚪. Then I removed my shirt and brought red wrapper and tied in my waist. I decorated my room to look like shrine and use some chalk I stole from church Sunday school to design my face. I remembered in nollywood movie when witches appear they start laughing. Then I started laughing in loud voice not minding that it is midnight because I locked my door and that I don't care if our neighbors are hearing me because it is none of their business. As I was laughing like witches I felt like somebody is watching me but I didn't care I decided to take the witch practice to another level. I used my normal voice and shouted Normal voice: great queen mother your servant is hear again I changed my voice like a girl and said Girl's voice: my son you are welcome to our meeting. You have not did what you promised us Normal voice : I will do it soon, I will not dis... (I didn't even finish my statement when Mama Ada who is our neighbor pushed my door open and came inside my room with my parents) My mother immediately fell on the floor and started crying and shouting " my son have been possessed oo" My father was holding olive oil and bible and he was speaking in tongue. I wanted to explain to them that am not a witch and our neighbor mama Ada was telling him not to listen to me that it was the devil speaking. My father started praying My father : you evil spirit from hell I command you to die by fire Me: (Nothing happened) My father: ( start pouring me olive oil) I command you to leave this boy by fire Me: I told you that am not possessed Mama Ada: this demon is stubborn, I have seen ones like you before. She called her son and later I saw him coming with 3 big canes.immediately my mother ran and collect one cane and flogged me in the back and my father pushed me in the name of praying. I fell on the floor and started shouting because the cane is painful. Then the stupid boy said that the prayer is working that fire is burning me. My father and mother started praying seriously. I asked them is that how they do deliverance in their church. Before I knew it, the stupid boy flogged me another cane. I tried attacking him. Then our useless neighbor mama Ada told my parents that the demon is manifesting. To cut the story short, am in serious pain.they flogged the hell out of me. To make matter worse they tied me with rope since morning and called our pastor Odumeje. Now my life is now unpredictable because Odumeje did one guy smack down on Sunday and the guy died instantly and he said that it is God that took the guy. My own deliverance maybe uppercut. Please you guys should help me tell my parents that am not a witch. It is just a practice. 😂😂😂  Thanks so much for reading my joke,  If you enjoyed it, Please can you do me  a favour,  I want you to please SUBSCRIBE to my channel,    I know u are capable. 💛💛👍 it very simple  Just touch my profile picture and  you  will see where to SUBSCRIBE  Plsssssssssss🙏🙏🙏

😁😁😁😁😂😂😂😂 Ekene is the  house boy who drinks his boss' wine and then adds water  to   fill  it up.​   ​His  boss    became   suspicious and... decided to buy pasties ( A french wine that change colour if water added)​.😂😂😂  ​As usual, Ekene drank the pasties and topped it up with water. ​Unfortunately for him, the pasties changed colour. When the boss came back home and notice the colour change, he told his wife about it.​ ​  Ekene knew he was in trouble and decided to stay in the kitchen. ​ ​The boss shouted, "Ekene!!!" ​ ​Ekene answered.."Yes, Sir!" ​ ​Boss.. "Who drank the pasties?"​ ​Ekene didn't respond.  ​The boss ask again, still no answer. Then the boss went to the kitchen to confront him.​ "Are you insane or what? When I called you, you said 'Yes Sir', but when I asked you a question, you didn't answer me!  ​Hmmm Oga, when you are in the kitchen you don't hear anything except your name,"​ Ekene answered.  "Let's try it. Okay go to the bar and stand beside madam, while I will stay in the kitchen. Then call me and then ask me any question,"​ The Boss suggested.  ​Ekene shouted, "Boss!"​  ​Boss answered, "Yes!" ​ ​Ekene asked, "Who goes into the maid's bedroom when madam isn't around?" ​ ​Boss didn't answer​.  ​Ekene ask again, the Boss kept quiet. ​ ​The boss came out from the kitchen shouting, "Wonders shall never end!!!  Ekene it's true. When one's in the kitchen, one doesn't hear anything except ones name"​.  ​The wife interrupted, "That's not true. It's a lie".​  ​Without argument Ekene ask if she'd like to enter the kitchen to be tested and she agreed. ​ ​Ekene called, "Madam!  ​Madam answered, "Yes!" ​ ​Ekene asked, "Who is Junior's biological father? Me or boss?"​  ​Madam rushed out of the kitchen saying, "This kitchen needs to be checked, I can't hear anything!"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂 you that enjoyed my joke, May laughter never depart from your mouth.😁💯💯Amen As you press the Like button on my comment,  also touch my profile picture and SUBSCRIBE to my Channel, just my clicking on my profile, you I'll see the subscribe bomb  Please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
