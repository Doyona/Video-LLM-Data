It just seems like a flamethrower to me rather than a lightsaber. I hope you continue to perfect this.
Yo we have the same exact end goal. Let's start the sister company to build economically viable technology! I graduate in March. @hacksmith
Why did it take so long to cut it in half?
Well there goes a rare artefact
Why is play button cooked like a fish lol.😂
Eff the haters. Rock on bro.
Could you do a video like this without the sound effects added? I want to hear what if any noises this thing actually makes.
The diamond button has join the dark side 😢
12:22
hacksmith is too OP
Nice. Keep it up making new stuff.
Diamond PlayButton Durable tbh
You should use eletromagnets and water electrolysis in your next light-saber.
I wish i had skipped ahead
Honestly this makes me so mad yet so happy that you cut into the diamond play button
jit made a case hardened csgo play button
12:22
You are the best YouTuber ever I’ve been watching you for a bout three years❤
Last
jo mama
Your videos are filled with so much pointless crap to extend runtime
I'm a big Star Wars fan and I love all the cool lightsaber stuff that you do😀😄😁
You did your best🎉
Ten years into the future he will cut his 100 million subscriber playbutton
Go to 12:22 for the lightsaber cut
hi
youtube don't send the hacksmith any more buttons
What you do is amazing
You are so inspiring
this hits different after the new video
It is incredible what you have done in only a couple of years. It's the best work I have ever seen in my life. So don't give up. Please.
you should  make one with a high power hfsstc
I am from Sweden 🤣
Haha i come from sweden gotland
Hacksmith you taught me how to enginier.
i love this chanel so much but WHY DID YOU MELT YOUR 10 MILL PLAYBUTTON
Totally cool video
흐뭇
❤️
no offense to you or your team but the real reason you started your buisness was to provide weapons for us in the robot uprising
It will take a while to chop a stormtrooper in half l, but still amazing, congrats in 10 Mil ages ago!
This is a year late but you guys are awesome
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
People who complain are just sad they aren't geniuses like The Hacksmith!
12:22
Other Youtubers with their play button: I will keep this safely and and in front of the place so that everyone can see it. Meanwhile the Hacksmith: Time to burn this thing.
12:22
SO COOL
WOAH
12:22
People who like to mock and make unnecessary complain or judgment should duck tape their own mouth! :)
Lightsaber be like " finally a worthy opponent"
One of my biggest dreams is to be an genius inventor
okay, first off, *WHY!?*
If a jedi war breaks out i ll be taking a diamond play button
Wow
I’m mad because you should be at least 20 million or 100 million subscribers you deserve way more
That play button is the new beskar.
Build Roger Roger bot
These guys should work for the U.S. military
It would be really cool if you did the lightsaber in different styles, like if you fitted the tech into different characters hilts, like darth Vader for example, and make a complimentary backpack part.
the play button is made out of beskar
Dudes a legend
Will they replace it
How much do you want for that light saber
One day when the time comes he might be able to make it stronget
Bros melting the play button like a crystal💀
The diamond survived 🤣
Hi
case hardened skin
this releases my 1 iq knowledge of science and 300 iq knowledge of the star wars franchise
Bro sounds like a b1 battle droid with that mask he has on
Anyone who says "why did you break it" he can buy a new one
I will always watch your contact no matter what.
Hi HackSmith
I’m just wondering why?
Aloha!  Much respect to you.  It is a pleasure to see someone trully giving back & not just making it about $.  My son and I love watching you.  One day, we will leave Hawaii to visit & see you in person.  Keep it up.  Your inspiring.
12:22
We need a beskar YT play button
Its a good thing you can order another one lol. It'll just cost you 3k
12:12
It will shatter into 10 million peices . It will shatter into 10 million peices .   bro its a 10m play button , nice joke
Are they gonna give you another cuz ya know that’s worth a lot
Hacksmith dont listen to the haters i love you and your team you guys are the best engineer’s
Can you give me one
O cara virou o aruan, cortou o play de 10m do yt, mas lembrando que o primeiro homem a fazer isso com um play do yt, não lembro qual foi, mas ele foi o 0rimeiro homem a cortar um, orgulho dos BRS
.)
May you keep yourself centred and take time for yourself, and may the force be with you, always.
Will they send you a new one
The goblin in my head is mad that you "stole my idea!" and on the other hand, it's also happy that i don't have to do it.
Now I know how to make topaz
Make iron man armor out of diamond button lol
You are the god hacksmith !!
Yo
Poor play button
Love your channel
Man I got mad respect for all of you keep the good vibes going🤠😃
Nooooooo the diamond play button
fun fact: before lightsabers, there were protosabers in the galaxy far, far away, although with smaller batery packs, usually carried on a belt or back, and wires were a weak part of a saber
I meant you should make Ghost Riders flaming hot chain sorry
Everything you get new you just break it with your crazy machines
👍
Youtube: here’s your diamond play button congrats on 1 mil! Hacksmith: let’s see if the lightsaber can still cut anything
12:22 For people who want to skip to the cutting part fast
I will gladly lend you my lightsaber if you so desire
Hacksmith: Im giving this protosaber away Me: *Grabs my moms card* No need for bidding, any amount of cash. Im free.
Bruh I Love That Prince of Bel air Reference
YouTube after watching this Let’s not send him more stuff OK.
And create more to the US army
Why don't you sell your lighsaber to the US army
Man frek the haters your cool as hell man
I love when he said "you know its fresh because we don't have 11 million subscribers yet" and then I scroll down to see that they almost have 11.5 million subscribers, wow you guys are growing fast and I love it!! Extremely well deserved for sure!
12:22
Thinking about it, it started turning chrome, that would've been so cool if you hung a chrome diamond playbutton up!
Well, since 2009
Been a fan since he started
T video is a little boring sorry
Can you please recreate Wireless electricity with no batteries....Sir Nicholas Tesla created this once....please it's a humble request
What if you cut your beard with it
And now make a battledroid
Make a purple one
We love your content even if every thing is hard we still support you
This video is freaking inspiring you can hear him about to cry for the whole speech. I'm so glad this channel and all the people that - ehm ehm - make it real, exsist.
this guy is the best youtuber
your at 12.7M when im watching
congrats
Tbh i think you so it just fine.
Why does James sound like a battle droid wearing the mask XD
How crazy can someone be to roasting their DIAMOND PLAYBUTTON to just entertain us! They are insane!!!
Dude I hope that you succeed in your master plan
14:20 that burned metal look on the play button is awesome
Ah yes, the entire population of Sweden are fans of lightsaber ppl
Keep up the good work I love your videos
Aruan 2
Why you did it
12:22
Saiyan gloves
I love what you’re doing! Keep up the great work
Lol are you at least gonna get another one or....not lol
aruan: cut their 100k play button everyone: ANGRY  hacksmith: cut their 10M play button everyone: happy
I like how they said "make a YouTube channel and track 10 million subscribers. That's only the entire population of Sweden"
Cool
I will try to make a diamond play button food when I have diamond play button XD
get to cutting it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10mill plaque cooking dish: me good soup
Why the play button what did it do to you😂
I just found you channel today and I am so happy I did your channel is cool
The CUTTING part begins on 12:45 Yeah you can thank me later
DONT DESTROY THE PLAYBUTTON.
It sounded like he was about to cry but it made me so happy when he talked about this
14:07 you could stop right there, it looks beautiful.
I'm really excited for you. this is gonna be awesome 😎
absolutely wholesome. well-done 😅
I like the blue play button look tho
Can you do a infinity gauntlet
ok hear me out I am no scientist or a phd I dont know much about physics so tell me If Iam making shit up but  what If we used plasma to make the lightsaber lets just forget about powersource and all that and just focus on how it would work. So from what i know plasma works similarly to iron and other metals when in contact with magnets we alslo know that plasma has similiar capabilities that a non newtonic fluid has and that magnetcs can work in liquid state. so what if we used the luqid state magnets inside the plasma to make it a more less solid  thanks to the magnets making the blades shape and length cause of their force and when pressing the button on the hilt the solid  state magnets inside the hilt would either cause the blade to hide  thanks to force of atraction or  come out using the force of repusion?  what do you guys think It came up to when i was talking a shower
Why would you destroy a play button yo8 only get one
Why ?
you are 1 step closer to the dark side
What I learned from this is that armor made out of diamond play buttons would be the Jedis worst enemy
you should not upload one video a week, look at mark rober he uploads like once a month and thats because his projects is so big, and so are yours
I ❤️ Your channel
Bruh
YouTube's reaction- what the heck is this guy doing with our diamond play button!?
The channel isn’t called hacksmish  industries anymore I just realized
This is definitely my favorite YouTube channel.
New Fan! Some people deserve the negative feedback but honestly your videos dont! Yeah alot of the inventions are not 100% accurate but dude this is entertainment and you’re doing a damn good job of entertaining millions! Keep doing that! Forget the negative because i think they’re trollls
I listened to your little speech about your "masterplan" and i was very impressed because of the passion and dedication that was very noticable in your talk. Besides that, this plan sounds awesome and i cant wait to see how it turns out and which kind of projects you might be able to build in the future.   P. S: The play-button looks great. Very unique
This makes my inner Star Wars fan
I love your videos
was it worth it
Same
Love from India bro
I wish I can help you but I'm only 10
I'm such a big fan dude and by the way you should make  Sith lords ligjtsaber
People could at least give positive feedback on mistakes you do
This man now owns the “plasma play button”
Respect
I think that "ripple" is slowly creating a tide. Keep going, keep enjoying. Onward and upward.
Its just like: thx so much for subscribing now i have the diamond youtube play button. *burns play button for no reason
do not worry we are with u!!! :)
Youtube : Here you go, the ultimate precious diamond play button Hacksmith industries : Definitely
YouTubeに喧嘩をうってるようだ
I love your videos you inspired me to build
I love your videos you inspired me to build.
Why did u do that
日本人いなさそうだからコメント残しとこ
I know I'm a bit late to watch this, but I am new to this channel. I already have so many ideas for projects that I want seen done, like Doctor Strange's necklace thing (I can't remember the name). I am a huge Marvel fan, and love seeing Marvel stuff in real life. If you guys are looking to do some out-of-high-school internships, let me know in 2 years.

Fuck 👍🏻
OK! James...buddy I have seen u do a lot of crazy stuff in the past but this... this is really beyond crazy!!!       I LOOOVE IT!!!!!!
Congratulations.. keep it up doing good job …😎👍
Why why why you Döring this one Diamond are 10,000,000$ and the Playbutton 100,000,000$
This video shouldn’t have 5,000 diss likes
How many takes took you to film it
i feel like you are crying inside because of memories
That was exactly what I was hoping would happen, ahh... Also good luck on expanding the operation, exciting to have something like that going on so close to home :)
@THEHACKSMITH  I have got idea for the next prototype: what if you use a miniaturized version of turbojet engine as the lightsaber?   You not only get a flame but also recoil and resistance needed to push an object away.  Down side of that resolution is, that the same recoil what may push away an incoming weapon attack may also tear off your arms from your torso - holding a miniaturized turbojet engine is like a holding a fired rocket turned upside down.   But maybe it will work?
The diamond play button is like a silver play button.. Lol
Why would you do that because you can’t get a new one
I am useless
i would really love too work fore you
Why would you destroy something so valuebule
I loved the part when he referenced the fresh prince of bel air
Bravo!
You are the creator of the future
This is a great video
Does anyone else wanna knows what happens if you have a duel with those kinds of lightsabers?
"The Jedis are cutting in" "Close the diamond play button" "They're still cutting in" "Impossible"
Video starts at 12:17 btw
Me who only builded a gun made out  of lego knockoffs *master* *builder*
Wise. Words. You have grown so much,built so much, did so much,worked so hard maybe one day you’ll create something even more life changing.
The diamond in between was looking like red arc reactor
I think he’s more of a Bruce Wayne
I luv your vids bro. Very inspiring
pretty sure this dude's better than a lot of rich people out there, at least with stuff having to do with the earth.
This is so cool to see what a protosaber would actually be like because this is a proto saber
Your channel is great
12:22
I ment to say fix not fox I just now noticed what I sayed
I’m watching this on July 29, 2021. Exactly 2 years ago today, Grant died. Hearing what you said about him reminded me of the channel and legacy he built and the inspiration to try all of my wild ideas. We all miss him.
10:47 it`s fun whit the sweden fing but allso not so nice to a person WHO live in sweden like me
Y did you distroy it... But it's so satisfying 😂😂
hacksmith: FINALLY WE CAN DESTROY OUR DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON
It was Chrome then gold witch was better than it turned a nice purple witch was even better and then it turned blue and a few different colors
Why did you CUT the DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON
4:28 man, tony stark isnt real unless you make it real, be the ironman, you know what i mean

I am from India and love your video
In my opinion the 3 best inventors are nicola tesla,elon musk, the hacksmith
Ur the best
This man is making Apeture Science and I love it

Nostalgia
12:24 start
The good thing is he can just make a new one
you are real tony stark
12:22
You blody legend your great
Y are the best
Yes
You should try to compact the power source for the  light sabers so much so it turns into an actual light saber    That would be a cool thing
One day you should make a device that resets your body condition if you find a way to make it possible.
Hey man i realy like the things that you do and i want to take a momant and say thank you and to all your team
You should be proud and ignore those comments because there are always those type of people in the world
When Youtube looking this video
Thank you very much for all the vids and ideas.
Why would you that
I am sorry to all of the people that had bad comments😔
12:40 watch this
Hi Hacksmith
Megusto este vídeo👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘♥♥♥
Bro you're killing it. Don't worry about haters man. You guys are incredible! I love every video you make and love that you're inspiring so many people to get into engineering. Well done!
lmao, imagine casting the inside of the playbutton into a future project. *"made from the tears of 10 million subscribers"*
8:12 Top five YouTubers who have sworn
DUdE sTOp it mealting
That’s a dumb idea
Ian's so tall
If he just got is royal blue he would have the coolest diamond playbutton
Maybe could you try to make adhd from dog man?
A different Hacksmith video someone says: in the future-  "we used to have to wear backpacks when we wanted to use our lightsabers." Me: thinkin right now- "that is exactly how cell phones started!"
"Simply create a YouTube channel and attract ten million subscribers, that's only the entire population of Sweden"
12:22
Who else watched the whole thing instead of skipping to the lightsaber?
YouTube my be unhappy
I would like a lot ti learn what u hacksmith u inspire us and u are for me the most close thing to a superhero, thank you
u have 12m subs
P
the video should be called how to make your diamond play button look blue
You guys are the best!
As one of my friends said  (I will not say name of his ) this kids a mad lad ( so he said to a stupid kid /annoying kid while playing among us )
12:22
Do you know Candice?
:D
Hacksmith you are great in almost every video you test the experience your self it could blow up, destroy you but you still did it great job I love watching your videos.
He is a battle droid with a lightsaber ,lol
I wanna work with them but im too young and probs not smart enough and when i grow up theyre gonna be old asf
Dude, we freakin love you.
Hey James just a question or a content idea... introducing the team of hacksmith industries
You guys deserve everything
diamond to gold to amethyst play button
ooo god no god please please no god
Who thinks it's a bright idea to complain about more free content just because there was more than one person in it.
Is this cutting through a play button or talking about t boring things??
I am your indian fan
how could u destroy a super rare hard earned diamond playbutton
To day is my birthday and I am making a captain America shield from a dish plat that will stop pellets I'm am trying to make it stop a 22 Calubor
I think you’re awesome though
youtube: were not making an extra, so be careful with it. hacksmith: alright. also hacksmith: PROTO-LIGHTSABER vs DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON
This man inspires  me the most I'm 13 by I have made 6 whole inventions of my own and planing to make my own iron man helmet.  I am with hacksmith since 2018
Aruan 2
and gru
What if you made the hilt from a graflex if you ever do another
I don't know if there is anything that has plastic on it but I heard that breathing in burning plastic can give you cancer even if there's plastic or not I shared this.
Get him another one!
aruan: * cut the button viewers: we dont like that hacksmith: * cut the button viewers: WE LOVE IT
I want to be like you
So don't care about your fans all your fans got you that all YouTubers love ther play button but you don't care
Why
Wait... What does everyone think youtube thinks of this?
It really saddens me that people still dislike this video after what James said.  You guys are doing awesome things, keep it up!
youtube: thats some appreciation for ya!

For people who don't have much time 12:22
yeah stop hating on him
Why are u doing this
This video soooooo baaaad
I wonder if they're going to get another play button
What absolute idiots would try to discourage him just because he doesn't do EVERY SINGLE VIDEO?!
why did you melt your diamond playbutton
14:16 looks pretty cool
bruh the bel air rap
Will I still get like from you🤔🤔
I think your channel is the best
i love your videos
Your channel inspired me to go back to college for mechanical engineering.
Strongest thing on the world: A 10 million play button.
12:38 what we came here for hope it was useful
Came for the lightsaber, stayed for the awesome progression story! Super inspiring stuff, makes me proud to be an engineer😂
Dude your the best
i feel sad for james
Stop talking like you don’t matter your the best of the best you tubers
Plot twist: the James beard is made of Beskar it can’t burn so he has it forever
12:22 is what you came for.
He made the first 1,000,000 galaxy playbutton
Yt diamond play button is the real life beskar
If people call you bad don't listen to them they're just dumb and if people call you bad why don't they make the creations their selves
Hacks Smith I have a question is the diamond play button really a diamond because there is a diamond that is wretch 10,000 and it’s not Evan an inch so if it’s a really diamond you are rich if you sell it.
That looks soo cool 14:38
Hacksmith industries Real life stark industries
He should make mandos suit out of playbutton its the  same as beskar😂😂😂
DDDDDDUUUUUDDDDDDDEEE this is the first YouTube  video that almost made me cry!!!
Youtube: Hacksmith,You have now achieved your diamond play button congrats! Havksmith:Yay i am now going to slice it in half
12:22
I love the hacksmith
You should make a mini tank
holup..GRANT THOMPSON DIED???
THIS IS SOOOO COOL WHAT???!
Hi
Haha you own version of the fresh prince of belair theme song lol
You are the most hardworking YouTuber ever
they got theirs to light up better than LinusTechTips
B a s i c YouTube channels: wow I love and cherish my diamond playbutton  Cool, Galaxy brain YouTube channels ( like hack smith): nice, got a diamond playbutton...  let’s order 66 this thing!
I love your channel
This made me cry
Noooooooooo
Lwhat happened to your beard
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏🤘
That was a good speech
I think he said break into 10000000 pieces because he got 10M subs
3:30 that part is just sad in my opinion
These guys are gonna be the first to actually make a lightsaber
Why kinda ass dislikes this vid
I love you and your team....you guys are amazing and inspire me to become an engineer. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!
I’m so chuffed for you this is such a great video and I can’t stop watching it!
To the greatest hero this world will ever know: the hacksmith. People come, and people go. True legends, are forever. You are a true legend. You will find the team you need. If you put job applications, out there? People will sign up, to join you. If you have a website, for people to apply for a job working with the hacksmith? I can pretty much guarantee you: people will apply for the most desired position in the universe. People want to work with you. They just don't know where to sign up.
Hacksmith industries Inc. if Wayne tech industries Inc., And Stark tech industries Inc., Were to merge, and become 1 company? The answer to the question is hacksmith industries Inc.  Well done hacksmith. You are living the dream. You are where so many people wish they could be. Keep up the good work. Keep going strong. The world needs people like you. Well done.
You need to do a project with Adam Savage!!!!
This was both awesome and painful to watch
5 Year Olds: Mom Are LightSabers Real?  Mom: No Honey It's Just a Movie   Hacksmith: **Busts Through Door**   Hacksmith: **Takes Out Lightsaber**  Hacksmith: Excuse Me, What?
That is cool
Just imagine if he forgot to press record.
Wow destroying a priceless item
Why?😢
As a person would say when you become a famous it will not inspire the next generation in the future
your videos inspire me to do amazing things and i ended up making and coding my first robot with your inspiration
So, what was the play button made out of? It looks like it was 2 different materials. The outer material that was melted looked like some sort of metal. The inner material looked like some sort of gem. Was it a real diamond? I find it hard to believe YouTube would send you a Diamond that friggin huge! I mean that would cost a small fortune! Right? Also, it looked like the inner gem material wasn't really attempted to be melted that much. The vast majority of the light sabre's focus was on the outer material. Makes me wonder: Could the light sabre have melted through the inner gem material?
Hacksmith:destroying a playbutton Youtube:no more playbuttins for you
This guy is the only reson thr world is good
Your videos really Inspire me as a fellow creator. I don't have anything too crazy but we're getting there.
I like the vids
15:17 that’s a much better play button, sadly u cut it in half
YouTube better give them a new playbutton
Just a suggestion but if you could make a plasma lightsaber duel that would be so awesome
Can you give your silver play button to me
Cut you gold and silver play buttons so you can make your 50,000,000 play button when you get there
👍👍👍👍👍😁😀😃😄
pog

I think you should make a black panther soot and clas
I wish I could be part of this team. It’s amazing, so many amazing things created. So much brain power in that warehouse, jeez. I wish I have as much brain power as you have in your pinky. Granted I can create blueprints, drawings, how things work a little bit etc. but I don’t have the items, material, etc. but also I don’t put effort towards the materials, I actually enjoy drawing and coming up with some abstract ideas, o would put it together but the draw-ups is my favorite part. But I’m very happy to see you grow, and have the team you have. Finally so many subscribers it’s amazing. And now as I’m watching this you’re sitting at 11.8 MILLION, like damn dude, congrats to you and the team. Y’all are an inspiration and such down to earth people, I wish I could have a team like you guys have, and would absolutely love and wish to see projects being put together and visit. Amazing. I like the internship that’s awesome. More possible additions to the teams? Keep up the amazing work guys!!!
This is the only time I've left a comment for a youtube video. Way to go Hacksmith, I hope to see many more of your videos. I have always loved makers viedos, and you guys do a fantastic job making 200 hours of hard work into a 20min video that is enjoyable to watch. My nephew loves your videos too (after i introduced him to your captain america shield vid), and he has a 14yr olds attention span:). Don't let any mean commentary get ya down, you should be extremely proud of what you have made. I hope you get to see your dreams come to fruition with Hacksmith industries, and I'll keep an eye out for where you go from here.
Noooooooooooooooooo why
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
man i admire your determination and will to help the world, they aint many like you, at least who ive met and know about anyway
U just destroyed millions of dollars that could have funded ur videos
I love this channel, I’ve been subbed since 2016 and loved every second, well deserved

6:34 just wanna say that the genius of all of you inspires me every videos.
That speech at the beginning was so real, and genuine. Every 5 seconds I kept looking down to see if I liked the video.
That speech at the beginning was so real, and genuine. Every 5 seconds I kept looking down to see if I liked the video.
Sorry for losing your play button ▶️
Congratulations on 10 Million Subscribers

Awwwwwww😥😥😥🥺🥺
When the lightsaber comes through the button. “UNLIMITED POWERRRRRR!!!”
I was half expecting something to go wrong and a new superhero born. It's bound to happen one of these days.
He just customized the play button
I used the content to destroy the content
The best
Hacksmith you should become tony stark I promise Thanos Will not come and kill you and when I grow up I wanna be like you
Hi hacksmith! If you are reading this you are one of the people who have inspired me to become an engineer when I get older. One day I hope to intern for you! Thank you for inspiring me to see a whole new world of possibilities!
Ok dude cut to the bullshit
15:17 magma playbutton
Dam i was here since 2016
You should do a collab with Styropyro. He works with lasers and has a chemistry degree I think. He does cool projects too.
You all rock!
You just lost your diamond flavoursome
This makes him a real Tony Stark since he doesn't care of any prestigious price
ı am turkhish but ı very lıke you
He's officially my favorite chef.
11:22

From one small youtube person to another, much bigger one
I am so sorry about all of the native comments
You realy make the future!
This video is the best. Its inspiring to people that are hoping to have similar goals. I think what he is doing is amazing
Bro 80% of this video is fillee
(Youtube left the chat)
The haters are motivation
In 3 months you have almost gained 2 million subscribers. Most impressive young skywalker.
Hacksmith University now that’s something that’s sounds so right and a place I would love to go!
Moral of the vid if someone chases you with a lightsaber just use a diamond play button
I thought the first part was so sad it makes me so sentimentalI love him if I couldn’t make this well I couldn’t make it this far in my life without having him
@Hacksmith Industries why did you cut the Diamond play button that should've been your prized possession. (im not tryna be negative) im very proud of you keep up the good work.
I love your videos man
Hacksmith in 2077: hello guys and today we will be making a functional thanos gauntlet that can erease half the population.

The new play button the lava play button
Diamond is unbreakable
Are you mad hacksmith why did you do this the real diamond play button is rare
the after affect of the playbutton is so cool
You are so smart
wait, u can use that plasma based Light saber as an Iron man repulsor since it looks and has the destruction of an Iron man repulsor! u should try it instead of a laser :/
can you do thanos copter ver lightsaber
can you try to make a doublebladed protosaber?
12:22
Hacksmith: reaches 10 mil YouTube: you deserve this *beautiful diamond play button* Hacksmith: well well well, let’s melt it then
THE BESKAR PLAY BUTTON
That thing is made out of Beskat

These guys are the real Stark Industry.
That song in the beginning was lit 🔥
This channel is absolutely amazing. Those people are entitled to their own opinion. We can't down them for that but know the facts... you guys are amazing. You do things nobody else can. Keep going guys, you'll always have my support.
Long time fan
He went from almost burning a garage down to cutting diamond. I don't even know him personally but I'm so proud.
So why should they care
And it’s not their product
I would like to see them do it
Listen guys, I just got to know ya a few weeks ago doing some research on gauss cannons, magnetic and electromagnetic fields and such for my course (I'm turning tech at almost 40 years old) and I gotta say this. You guys are unbelievable. Seriously. So, let me tell ya:  The net is (unfortunately) FILLED with negative people who leads such a f******ing miserable life that it seems that the only reason to carry on is to go on a crusade to slander and depreciate those that actually made something of themselves. So yeah. I hear you. Lot's of great comments doesn't seem to take away the bitter taste that some negative crap leaves, but hey. You made it. All of you. And you made it GREAT. So... **CK 'em. Stay on course and keep doing what you do best: GO AHEAD. PUSH FOWARD.
I'd love to be able to work at hacksmith industries since I'm pretty young and have a love for doing things that are hands on,  the only problem that I see aside from not having a chance to join the team is moving out of my parents house and living in Canada
Fun fact: After you sit through the heart to heart you feel better about yourself
i think this button is beskar
Plasmabase lightsaber 0 aluminium block 1 (so stupid)
That is not light saber it is a photo saber
You are fulfilling all my childhood dreams
Why are you doing this 😭😭 please stop
This video is better than eating a play button.
Do you think you can get this light saber to a higher Temperature ?
12:29 winter soldier
How sturdy is that button Captain America's shield should be made of that stuff instead of vibranium
YouTube : am I a joke to you  Darth Vader : know the power of the darkside
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love from Romania
14:20 We made an actuall diamond playbutton a year later...... WE BROKE IT!!!!!
He makes the play button look tasty
هلاو
Hacksmith dont let them get in to your head because your the best youtuber 👌🏼🔥
Wow diamond play button actually made of beskar
I am a fan of ur since 2018, my account is different, I gave that account to my little brother
This is why I want to become an engineer
The Falcon Should use the youtube diamond button instead of Captain America's shield
The Hacksmith is the most awesome YouTuber I've ever seen in my whole freaking life. Like literally, I have been a fan for 2 years now 😋🥳
people should not madder to you hacksmith
You made me cry
The chrome turning blue is beautiful
Bad guy chase scene
If u hear his voice, there’s an emotional wiggle, which makes me emotional too. U have done a great job, and there are a lot of great things waiting for u. Wish u only feel happy creating contents.🙏
Bullet Proof Mandalorian Helmet
I watch your Videos since 2 years and this ist what I m doing today
could you make it(lightsaber) longer?
I like all your videos and my favorite things you made is the storm breaker
12:22
Personal opinion: save the metal until your next lightsaber you make. Make it so that in a way, one lightsaber helped create it's successor
Dont worry haksmith you will get custom play button with 50 million subcribers
Idea of "Survival of our species" has gotten so much into our heads that we are willing to destroy Earth and depart using starship. Very mean of humanity
I was just watching "Clone Wars", and i realized that the ultimate test for your lightsaber could be to try out in space. Since "Star Wars lightsaber" work on outer space. I mean, it's really really expensive I guess, but it sure sounds amazing, didn't it?  Your's is awesome 😎 i can see the power you hold
What is that thing made out of?! The safe didn't even struggle that hard to stay alive.
Poor play button
are you crazy
hi
Is it just me or did the play button look cooler and cooler as he melted it?
Wow light sabers can actually cut through anything
12:22
почему всего 4000 градусов плазма? Есть плазморезы с температурой 20000 и больше
At 14:19 it looks so awesome I would kill to have a blue diamond play button like that
We are so close to having a fully made lightsaber. 😝
could the lightsaber be more longer?
No diamonds were hurt by the making of this video.     Crystals might been hurt
This is so sad
😭
This is not lightsaber... It is an ordinary burner.
Pls pls pls use this when it snows heavy
it would be really nice if you could be working on the lightsaber more
Dude that hits a heart so dang hard.  Nice videos dude.   😎
Best speech for this channel. THANK YOU. You and your team are doing amazing. We'll always be here

THOUGHS 5.3K PEOPLE WHO DISLIKED THE VIDEO ARE PEOPLE WITHOUT EMOTIONS
Placet is more beatuifel
Hacksmith Industries is like the second Nikola Tesla
14:25 Looks like an actual *diamond* playbutton.
Dude you gotta go work with JAPAN !!

He actually sounds like a droid with that mask on hahahahaha
I actually just realized the Hacksmith Industries thing looks like Stark Industries

i love your videos ; )
hacksmith your the best
One word.  WHY
we love you hacksmith❤️
Anyone else James here look and acts a little like James A. Janisse?

It is literally a gas saber.
Don't listen to haters
bruh why are people complaining about you and hating on you? you literally built a *lightsaber* ! How about they try to do that?
I’m so happy the job Hack Smith I am pal
Half of my head Why are they doing this  The other half  This is fine... They can always make a new one themselves they made a actual hoverboard and a iron man suit
I hope your education system should be allow to get you guys certification at On-line, too.
Brilliant bro Edit: Came here to watch you cut shit , left reminded that you need an endgame and to remember it and not get caught up
If this was me I woulda stopped as soon as the play button turned blue. It Looked so cool
even tho i dont watch you so often but u love your works and videos and everything keep it up ❤
Seriously, we don't live in a sci-fi world. Th Hacksmith are trying there best to entertain and keep us interested in their channel, and people are complaining. To build something, you need to have %100 focus. Sometimes, the results aren't what you expect. They work on a project and mange to fit it into a 20 min, video. Stop complaining, complainers!

I love how amazing of an impact grant had on everyone including you keep pushing forward we see the change and love the family how big it's grown
12:43 pra quem quer pular o papo
lol im the one guy that ask for somthing while the rest of the comments are emotional comments (any body know this song reference? 1:13 ) if u do can u tell me
Sick
Gosh, I'm watching this vid almost 3 months late, but I just wanted to say that thanks to you and to stuff that happened with a member of my family, I decided to study Biomedic Engineering because I want to improve the quality of medical technology, and maybe create something revolutionary, in my country (Mexico) and become someone who can help others with everything I can try to invent.  I'm not sure how it will be, but this channel has inspired me to try and I'm really excited to start making progress during the following years, after I can graduate and get a job. I hope that the challenging projects that I have wondered about can get done, even though I'm sure you'll probably make a lot of exo-skelletons and stuff, I'll try to contribute to the future age with stuff like high quality prosthesis and other biologic materials, wearable technology, or even augmented humanity (I personally think that if the world succeeded with fully mastered Nanotechnology, then we could be capable of healing a lot of  problems from the insides of our body with less risk than surgeries, working like a powerfull antibiotic).  Thanks a lot, because of your channel I think that everything can be created.
Grant really was the best
Great speech
He is the modern day tony stark
they are willing to sacrifice the diamond play button for the veiwers. thank you
Hack Smith why don't you make a pokeball
ياخي الاجانب مدلعين

Sorry about your friend
Can u make a machine that pours maple syrup on pancakes? 🤔
Why?
.... now you're trying to cut diamond button with the sword.......
12:48 = aa thats hot
they complained because it easy to suggest than do it in reality they dont think that, its hard to design ang hard to built that crazy animation things turn into reality,, i think much better if your suggestion want to be in reality just try to do it just what they do,, let see if it is working,, don't complain if you can't do it,, because what they do is just amazing, imagine this crazy stuff, we just seen this in tv turn on  reality,, how genius they are that built this amazing stuff,,
I know this is kinda cool but if you think about it they just heated it up with a stick of heat
This stuff is awesome.  I have nothing but praise. I sit in my ass eating popcorn.  I have no input but that I love these!  And based on the popcorn habit no real skills whatsoever
Great bit but it was 12 minutes too long
why you do that didnt you want it shouldve kept it
Go on bro! You are awesome
Well I'm glad someone out there is doing big things with their life so I don't have to, what a relief. Thanks for taking the load off my shoulders, now I can chill and play video games!
I want to work for you so bad but I’m only 13 I’m hoping you continue this for long time your my idol. I also live in America which means I would have to move to Canada I just really want to join your team
i feel like one day his buisness will be worth millions of dollars
respect to you for liking hundreds of comments
I love the fresh prince camo 😂
I’m coming for that internship
But you worked so hard for that play button🥺
James its fine u don't need to be all mushy o us its your plan u take it up and make it real its up to u if it gives u 110% of your initial expectations . The thing is hacksmith will be hacksmith  nobody can change that u just need to make it real
what do  u guys think should be the first thing in 2021 that they "Lets make it real"
You will defidently be the first person in the world that might be able to make a actual lightsaber.
He sounds like he wanna cry and that make me wanna cry
You sound like a Droid anytime I put Dad's lives on
I cant wait until we can get rid of the backpack and one day make the blade longer
i love your videos and i always be so happy when i see you build stuff and you do it with your buds
ngl this was kinda emotional all the haters are fans for taking time outta their day to say something about him like dudes life and accomplishments be their whole reason for living 💀 hacksmith is a legend keep your head up king 🙏🏾👑
The play button is Made of bescar
You know, I've always wanted my own research compound as well. First, I have to become a top research scientist though. That's priority number 1. Who knows, we may end up collaborating some time in the future. That would be amazing.
Even though he said that he wasn’t iron man and he isn’t real.He just feels like Captain America mixed with Iron man
Ogod
Ive been watching this channel for so long it's amazing how you hit 10 million. I remeber watching videos from 6 years ago.
I know it’s been a while since you’ve made the lightsaber but I still can’t believe you made it! Not as strong as the actual lightsaber but the closest thing so far!
before i started watching you i wasnt motivated at school because i didnt know anything i wanted to do when i was an adult but then i started watching you and i want to become a mechanical engineer and i have gotten really much better in school so  i thank you for that. Good luck!
Your story is so touching I'm so happy for you
That lightsaber is obviously sick but if you can make a real real lightsaber that is like solid and it’s not just a red hot stick that will be sick
This is the best channel ever!
Hacksmith your channel is absolutely amazing I can't imagine why people would complain, love your projects and videos!!! Greetings from Brazil
You sound like a droid from clone wars with the mask
12:22
eis que aruan Felix vira Jedi
Lightsaber Vs. full metal iron man helmet
2034: i does a full metal working iron Man suit lets fire try and shot City
Bro u are grate don't feel bad u are and u will
I also want to build things, but I don't have enough knowledge about engineering :'>
12:40
Youtube:wow congrats for 10 mill subs here the play button :D   Hacksmith:nahhh lightsaber goes brrrrrr
Imagine he replied
Future people ppl that didnt watch this video:why doest the hacksmiths the diamond playbutton though they have  like 50mil subs  The hacksmiths: we cut the the playbutton with the worlds first lightsaber
excellent
Maybe next you can make The Inquisitors Heli-Saber
Soon, the light saber won't need the pack and will be even more powerful.
I can easily see this video being shown in like 60 years to look back at the start of hacksmith industries
That’s good
"hE dIdnT bUilD eVeRy pARt oF tHe bUIlD!"
Youtube sent us a diamond play button so naturally we had to test it by cutting it with our plasma saber.
I love your stuff you are awesome
Anyone that dislikes this video, I dislike the person
This is really far fetched but if exoskeletons become a real thing that everyone can have, do you think you will ever be able to have it implemented into your body in some way so that its not a suit its a part of us?
Keep doing what you’re doing, the time and history of  a company is shown by its fan base!
Hacksmith i love your videos but after watching this  youtube will ban you
Shave your beard off with a light saber ? 7 billion views ?do a flying car 👍
you know that you are the best in this world  you always inspire me build same things
"We dont have 11 million subscribers"  3 months later.  Yeah, yeah you do.
My respect for you after this video:📈📈📈📈 ur my role model
I love so much that they built the saber, the channel BLEW UP and then, YouTube gave them a Token of recognition... And they cut it the fuck in half. Hell yes.
Can you please make atleast one of the weapons used by Knights of Ren?
I’m really glad to say that I’ve been watching you grow since 50,000
I wonder if you could make a darksaber........
Well I guess we know what material to build walls out of when lightsabers are fully in use
Just why. You get a play button and try to cut it in half
You can buy one if you eant
Did they not even remove the diamond ?!
Other YT: Placing there DiaMond play button in a airtight box   Hacksmith: Puts salt and oil and a lot of other stuff on his play button than cutting it in half
This makes me cry😢
Diamond is unbreakable!
in the year 2200 my grand grand grand child will go to the Hacksmith University.
Could’ve been obi one kenobi
i love the hacksmith
You are amazing and I look up to you
I cant even make a phome one
When the lightsaber lights it sounds exactly like the ones from Star Wars
15:20, when your diamond play button is actually the Soul Stone, and it actually contains 10 million souls.
You are amazing!! Keep up you’re great work.. may you continue to inspire people  and touch lives.
Tons of respect for the way you went about your company and your channel and your team. Your a good man keep doing what you doing for as long as you can because your starting a good change in this more gray world

Guys you need a kyber Crystal to make a light saber duh
You should make a darth maul light saber
One of if the first thing you ever made was the metal wolverine claws. 10mil subs doesn't happen every day so cast the melted pieces of the button into a set of wolverine claws???
Fuck yeah
‘Use the diamond play button!’  ‘Have you ever encounter a Hacksmith before?’ ‘THERE STILL COMING THROUGH!’
I have two ingineer degrees and I can tell you just one thing , You've always inspired me ,you still .
Why can’t people just leave you alone...you post great content that is really cool.can those horrible people build a lightsaber? No! Keep up the good work👍
Até o Aruan se impressionou com essa
What if, hear me out here, we all tweet at Elon Musk to get involved with Hacksmith Industries? Thoughts?
I found your channel because of flying like iron man got recommended to me
I love this
I want to actually see the saber used on a dummy or something
Just what is the play button made of i was expecting it to be made of plastic and melt easily...
He sounds like a battle droid with the gas mask on.
Hacksmith : Works really hard and gets a diamond play button Also Hacksmith : Melts it and splits it into two halves 😂
Bruh mad respect long time fan and on this news i want to go to your school i want to work with you and learn. If you ever have room for a blacksmith and a fast learner
You cut your dimond play button in half. I don't know if this is insane or genius, but hell yes I am onboard.
How about making a bacpak full body ,air baloon which triggers when change in heart beat
Your an amazing person, keep it up
ur like the tony stark in real life😅
Other YouTubers: Noooo! You can't just destroy you're diamond play button, that's a once in a lifetime item!!  Hacksmith: hahaha lighsaber go brrrr
You guys are awesome!
When I grow up I wonna work with you guys 😀
Looks so cool blue.
You know, if you can get the team big enough (not like you might not be doing this already but) all the prototypes and other cool inventions you make and show us can continue to get worked on and advanced if there's enough interest or someone has a really good idea on it, plus that generates more video content hehe
Beautiful buddy, glad for the team being there, you're still amazing though keep it up.
Why are you Burning the play button
CHUPA ARUAN FELIX
Keep up the great work!
Is amazing pls guys bring us the real lightsaber!
I don't think anyone should think that you're doing YouTube for the wrong reasons and anyone who's incorrectly criticized the way you make videos or projects should really think about themselves in their lives first honestly it's okay to disagree with someone but people should think about what they say before sending it here YouTube videos really cool and inspiring and honestly no inventor really can do anything on their own nobody can do anything huge on their no can do it all in there own  I think the video about the self-tying shoes was really funny well also kind of inspiring way and if those become a product dozens of people who have difficulties moving their hands will be able to tie their shoes with just a push of a button
Starting to look like how to basic             Keep up the good work!        Lol
Is anyone else in need of a tissue?  🥺
That's The beste 10 Million Play Button in the World 🌍
If you are part of that 1% of complaints in the comments than your expecting too much from this amazing team and if you think anybody can do better than them, go make your own channel and you try it
That's awesome
yo are very good  تو خیلی خوبی
if this dude keeps on making stuff he is going to take over the world Lol
Main material of playbutton is beskar
*sniff sniff* it's so beatiful
You made me realize that anything frictional can be real
I'll say this, you've certainly changed the world People my age, with these interests, like cool new tech, pay close attention to this stuff. You are quite literally shaping the future.
12:24 video started thank me later 😜
with all due respect, it's an amazing start but I will try to make the bag more compact and try to let the protosaber cut things faster like the movies, series and comics
And if anyone came from germany
Literally no one: Hacksmith: Cuts Diamond Play Button in half Fans: Celebrate Lightsaber: Why?
I just got 10 million subscribers and a diamond play button let’s cut it in half
This is future old man
you really made me cry
Congratulations for your name in Guinness Book of World records !!!
Kids in Africa could have eaten that play button
The play button was made of Beskar
12:56 noooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LOL
Why are you complaining about the hacksmith he is the best guy ever
I wanna be a jedi
I really want to see them melt down the entire play button and turn it into a project, that would be awesome!!!
Aruan?
1:10 modesty
YT: next we should make a light saber proof play button....
Darth vader with the mask lol 🤣🤣
You do what you want to do don't let the people that don't like you stuff stop you. You are trying your best just have fun and do what you want to do ^-^
Im disening some rn at my house sence thee bither els to do
You should make wings that you put your arms through and see if you can fly that would be amazing lol
Why would you do that?You worked so hard for that
Goes to show that you should wear diamond play button armor in a lightsaber duel
thank you! from kitchener!!!
You should make the Mandalorian beskar staff
Ok now make it be able to slash through thing with out holding it there to melt things lol
Your an ambitious man. Good thing your a good super hero. Amazing story. 👍
That’s not a diamond play button... it’s a beskar play button.
I was just thinking, it would be pretty cool to use this lightsaber as the beam for a monado from xenoblade chronicles
Imaginem se o Aruan (era esse mesmo o nome dele?) Soubesse que alguém faria o mesmo que ele fez lá por volta de 2013
Yous' all are really successful people i cant wait till your master plan is finished keep up the work!!!
why would he destroy this?
Youtube be like: Seriously
Imagine that you perfect the lightsaber and sell it for big bucks, until its a common thing.        OH! Just remembered that lightsabers can cauterize wounds, so if you think about it, it could be a revolutionary step in medicine.
14:26. It actually looks better now
I wasn't a subscriber but I subscribed because you posted the time stamp, fair play to you.
TOO GOOD LETS GIVE HIM A Obsidian Play button
TENTANDO COPIAR O ARUAN FELIX NE
12:22
I think the play button is made of beskar
MAKE THE MANTIS BLADIS OF CYBERPUNK PUNK 2077
Idiots who think this channel is bad should be slapped in the face
Hacksmith  you sood not lisen to the **** shit some pepil give  p.s. sory abut my spelling
They gotta start making Star Ships out of this stuff, it obviously is more effective against Light Sabers than whatever they make the doors out of.
I'm a negative comment, now like me!
Really tho, you should come visit Utah, it has tons of hikes, waterfalls, canyons, valleys, etc.
Is built with beskar
I wonder how much gas they use??
When you get a reward for hitting 10 million subs, and you try to break it the next day 🧐
Please continue building impossible things to reality... Remember you making child impossible dream coming to reality... I hope I can make stuff like you at future... 🥰🥰
Love you bro keep going
Imagine someone tries to rob this guys house and he pulls out the lightsaber💀
if You Are Seeing My Comment May You And  Your Parrents Live 1,000 Years  Kindly Subscribe My Chanel Providing Good Content !!! ❣️ Do Some Act Of kindness May ALLAH BLESS You All say (AMEEN)
SO SAD
I have nothing to say,.... OTHER THAN ALL YOUR PROJECTS ARE ALL SUPER COOOOLLLLL!
Where'd YouTube get the beskar?
O Aruan gringo kkkk
14:25 a blue gem play button
GREAT JOB! and good luck in future   happy new year!
Lame
Damn that was super morivating thanks for that !!
I just love it
a DASH of lemon...🤦
Now for the ultimate test: can the proto-lightsaber cut the company in half
why would you do this to ur play button?
I hope you all realize just how amazing what he’s doing is sure people say oh I wanna make a change but it’s not easy he’s clearly been putting his heart and soul into his dream of pushing society into a bright science fiction future that he has started to create this company will go places and he should go down in history. This sounds bad but it’s just yur dad trying to be motivational I hope he reads this and understands how much he’s already done and how much he’s going to do this man is a legend.
You said you read everything that's posted and I have an idea I've been pondering for sometime what involves moving in space using gravity as a resource so to speak. It involves a ball bearing and a copper stopper to propel a fast forward motion. If you are interested the idea is yours provided you give it life
the cooking part Though xD
12:22 what you came here for
I love how when he was cutting the diamond play button the mask made him sound like one of the battle droids from clonewars
Why you do that
15:36 lol gj u almost melted ur arm
12:22
here's a suggestion make the lite saber longer
I say you are the best on YouTube
Is that thing actually made out of diamond?
Man, your making me feel so old 😭 Congratulations 🖤
You’re great at you’re work, keep it up! You make everyone’s lives so much better every day!
Of course the "real Tony Stark" exists.
How will you get another play button ???
what happens when james is gone?
I love this plan
The diamond play button was sold   out :(
Try to Cut a Nokia
Cut meat with it
*ahem* TO SHOW YOU THE POWER OF FLEX TAPE
Could have given me diamonds :(
You guys are awesome.  You are making a difference, and I appreciate you so much.  Keep fighting the good fight!!!
I love this channel and everything you do but I just hope you find a way to make this mostly safe for the environment
I like that
Congratulations
And James was about to cry you can hear it in his voice
Man ppl don't matter you make science fiction real opinions don't matter
You sound like a B1 battle droid
Your beard looks sick dude!
Any chance you could hire a full-time camera guy that just captures B roll? I'd really like to see more of the long tail work you guys do. Having someone document everything and do lite edits would be awesome. Maybe have a separate channel for the long-form stuff?  Anyway, I really enjoyed and appreciated the human element that you displayed in this video. Getting to know you as a person and the team is what's pushing me to sub the channel and look into supporting your projects. Long-form content and the human element, think about it.
I am soo happy for u
Imagine Elon Musk doing a project with Hacksmith Industries
Man's already at 11 mil
12:22
Yo keep going man, I love ur channel so much. To see you grown this far makes me really happy.
The play button did not have the high ground
12:22
Eles destruíram a placa, mas foda-se, foi MT daora! Chupa Aruan Félix haha
You're such an amazing and well brought up person. I really admire your work. In fact, I admire your whole team. Thanks so much for making your dreams a reality and using that to serve and bring enjoyment to other people's lives.💪♥️🙏🔥
Next Project Idea: Use Diamond PlayButton material to make Mandilorian armour and have beskar. Take over the world, rename our planet to Mandilore and make yourself “Mandilore The First”. Lastly, use your power to create the Dark Saber.
Negative comment
The play button when it was blue is amazing
You are the best do it your way
That blue is so nice
Jack dislikes ns me too
A video a week? Thats incredible! Ive seen youtubers upload 12 videos a year or 1 every couple of months.
that play button is very durable
I don't know if you're fans of The Expanse or not, but boy is that an IP custom-made for your operation. It's near-future sci-fi that's famous for its' strict adherence to science. While it might be a while before you're all making spaceships, there's tons of other cool, realistic tech to mine. Mag boots, wrist-pads, vac suits, tactical display tables, etc. They've even got their own version of a powered exoskeleton, the Goliath. It seems to line up well both with where you're wanting to take Hacksmith Industries and with the design ethos you explained in your TED talk.
Youtube ain't gonna give a shit after this video 😂😂😂
12:00 is when they start
I was the 240k liker
U burnt all ur chanels work
12:22
Your company/live story gives me and hopefully other the power to make their own dream world a reality.
Who would of known youtube are run by mandalorians and the diamond playbutton is made of pure beskar
Thanks for everything you have done and are doing!
I don’t know if you realized but you actually made the old times proto saber because in star wars lore in ancient times Jedi’s and siths had to war a backpack that is the power source with that cable or hose attached into the saber. Maybe after a few more years with more advanced technology maybe you will be able to make the light saber we all know
Dude make a mandolorian suit!!!!
This is some great inspiration.  Good on y’all. 👍🏻
don't let anyone pull you down man just keep it up man by the way i'm from philippines
Безумцы
12:58 sounds like a B1 Battle Droid
Mateus 👽👉🏿👉🏿
If you really concentrate......      You can still see his face behind all that hair
JamesYou are the best person I’ve met on YouTube
Aruan,  pq choras????
13:45 after much effort the diamond 💎 inside got roasted 😂
So real diamond...
it is crazy to me that you and the team invest so much time for the comments.. that alone deserves a firm handshake (not now due to covid lol) stay safe and healthy :)
And I have been watching you from 2012
We are with you
I hope they get another one or that’s sad
He forgot, " Make more money.”
You guys should make a suit of bulletproof mandaloring armor equipped with all the gadgets like the flamethrower, grapple hook, jetpack, thermal visions, rocket launcher, the works. That would be sick even if nothing worked properly
You should test if the lightsaber can stop a bullet
aprende ai aruan
make an iorn spider suit
Omg congrats
Can you make the leviathan axe or the blades of chaos?
great content heres a sub
@08:50 I've played The Surge. I'm watching you <~<
Diamond Play Button(Not actually Diamond) vs light saber  Diamond play button: You'll take a while to defeat me
I’d I did something like this and somebody had the nerve to say “it’s not good enough, do it better, why didn’t you do it this way.” I would just be like “I wanna see you do it and see if it’s better than what I can do, since you think your so good.” 🙄
YouTube after seeing what he is doing to the diamond play button 😡😡😡😡   All of us seeing this 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Hey can you try making a lightsaber without a power-pack? 😃
"Why would you do that"  Playbutton: "we are in the endgame now"
So when can I buy a lightsaber and an ironman suit :D
I understand that and you’re a great YouTuber
— I really love your contents to the extent I even watched your old YouTube videos pre-Garage days ! Keep calm , carry on & Make It Real !
How boring...
Meanwhile PewDiePies play button breaking at touch
Don't listen to the haters btw make speedy bots
Aruan ta diferente
If the zombie apocalypse ever happens imma go luke grimes on them mother fuckers
Fyi Swedens population is up to 11 million now lol. I guess i now belong to that 1% who annoys you lmao
Why does he always stand in a handcuffed position?
U wanna know something funny😁😁😁     He received his 10million diamond play button exactly 1 month ago and now his almost at 12million
hacksmith is gonna create entire cyberpunk 2077 but for real though, love it. tech like this would be lovely to have.
He should cut his beard
Didnt knew Grant was dead dam

You tube : where did all are money go  You tube worker : well we made a play button of steel so this guy won’t break it You tube : why would he break it  You tube worker: his channel is basically where he make just amazing weapons  You tube : did he break it?  Tube worker : yeah  You tube : remind me to have his next play button made of titanium
Lol Zarya gun
That thing is pretty resilient
Wow. 13 minutes. Just wow.
very cool
“You can tell this one’s fresh because we don’t have 11 million subscribers yet” - - - YES YALL DO! *-subscribe-*
I would do this but not cut it in half but just heat it so it turns purple
Great story and video.  Fantastic that you are Ontario group doing what you are doing.  Keep it up.
*Youtube has left the chat*
Hacksmith will always be a legend
14:17 don't
I think u r gonna be the best YouTuber
I agree negative comments are very annoying and agitating
am still not convinced but good for trying
James sounds like a battle droid with his gas mask on
I would love to see a Mark Rober and Hacksmith
That is one though play button..
Hacksmiths I know you guys prob won't see this but I'm gonna work my but off to one day try and get a internship and or job at your place because you make me think I can change the world
So this lightsaber wouldn't kill you with one blow
pls burn a diamond
U can also make bucky 's artificial hand
youtube watching this :youtube why JUST WHY
I'm inspired thank you for that beautiful speech
What’s wrong with him he burns a play button that he worked for and burns it
14:25 diamond amour!!!
Me: WOAH SO COOL  YouTube: *YOUTUBE DID NOT LIKE THAT*
Why?
Youtube: Congrats on 10m subs! Here is a Diamond Play button. Hacksmith: Haha Lightsaber go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
I love when he said "you know its fresh because we don't have 11 million subscribers yet" and then I scroll down to see that they almost have 11.5 million subscribers, wow you guys are growing fast and I love it!! Extremely well deserved for sure!
Uhhh that hurts
12:48 NOOOOO NOOOOOO I CRY😭
beskar steel
Nembiztos, hogy értitek amit írok de nagyon örülök, hogy vannak még ilyen jó tartalomgyártó és nagyon sok sikert és boldogságot kívánok nektek szerintem minden magyar nevében.
You have so much courage.

Aruan?
:>
14:30 I honestly love that look much more than the original diamond play button just that blue and orange combo is great
"Youtube will remember that..."
I have been watching you since you had 500k you got me into engineering and this channel has been a big part of my decision to pursue a engineering degree next year when i start college.
Thats quite the jar jar binks mask you have there 😆
you kinda sounded like a sepratist droid with the gas mask on😂 Great video dude, Love the lightsaber👍
big youtubers: my 10 mil play button is my prized possession hacksmith: my lightsaber is my prized possession
Guys wouldn't this be cool?   Mark Rober VS Smartereveryday VS Hacksmithindustries
hey hacksmith good you talk about it on 4:40 I can see you're having a hard time talking about it. legend for life 🙌🙌🙌🙌
12:00
At 14:19 the color of the play button looks color than the og color
Why would you want to destroy something you achieved and ain’t easy to achieve’ what do you get out of that? 😑
Yo are an inspirational person
...and you will be their maker, your strength will be their shield and your ideas...your hammer. You remain unbroken...for your goal is eternal.
James I almost cried during your heart to heart
After watching this video youtube is not going to give you any milestone any more
Video starts-12:23
Hay YouTube I think I need a new play button “thank you”
This breaks my heart man
Imagine Hacksmith launch a rocket to mars when they hit 50 million subscribs
ay you're in the guinness world record because of this invention!
Next we need jedi powers
stop the raps
Aruan gringo, only br will understand
I didn't expect that... That is truly awesome... I love it.
I am so very glad I didn’t skip to just the cutting of the play button
This cringed me cutting something worth 10million subs.
You should make a dark saber if you haven’t
I wish I could subscribe 99 times
Yea I wated 10 years to get a diamond play button only to destroy it.
Its a kyber crystal.
اسطوره
You sacrificed your play button. Im liking this video
hi
Is this made of beskar?
Os Brasileiro já vão começa a perguntando se tu é amigo do Aruam
Yall should do a video with alex labs
Bro cut your beard
The channel history makes me feel so emotional
At 14:25 the play button looked better than the original lol
Brainfootv: creator of play buttons  Hacksmith: destroyer of play buttons
With out any doubt this is the best channel on YouTube I wish you were a billionaire coz with that kind of money you could have made so much more
You ruined the ending bro.
Damn i am so happy to be in your journey from 110k subs to 11 mill, that is something
You really shouldn't do that!!
Would it boil or vaporise water?
not gonna lie. Pretty disappointed you destroyed it. It's yours but hey. Be proud of what you've done.
so bad
Ur destroying the play button u won't get it back
Can truly see how passionate you are when talking about your business. Congrats on where you are man you’ve obviously deserved it
Hacksmith: I’m so happy that people have enjoyed my content for so long! And now I have something to symbolize this amazing achievement! Well, I know what Im gonna do now.      IM GONNA BOAR THROUGH IT WITH A FREAKIN LIGHTSABER
I need to cut my High School diploma is gonna be the next video good laugh.
I wan’t to become a programmer professionally. But my uncle is struggling in the industry so maybe I’ll learn a trade and do stuff like this
How the FUCK are those YouTube diamond play buttons so tough
Hey I have been here since about three mil and I have loved every video of yours! Keep it up man!
Make loki scepter
I’m quadriplegic and I’ll be the first to buy stocks. @Hacksmith Industries
I DARE YOU TO MAKE MAULS LIGHTSABER
Make a spider man suit
Your video is really inspiring!!  Thanks hacksmith Just be yourself
i’ve been here since 100,000
A real lightsaber would cut right through it.
Make a Batman gun front that molten button
Sad times it’s a flame         Basically
That diamond was like visions mind stone😂
12:55
People who disliked are toddlers
my place is 50 habig road
can you build me a real iron-man helmet?
I sat through the entire speech, and you truly did inspire me.
I’m honestly kinda pissed that i didn’t know about this channel until the lightsaber video. I love it all.
So this is cool but when are you going to make Mandalorian equipment like an alloy resistant to this saber, whistling birds, lasso, wrist mounted flame thrower, flip down targeting system, and rocket launching jetpacks?
thats pretty impressive, but can it sear a steak? come one, guys! sous-vide bath + lightsaber sear. i need to see that!
Remember, if you ever feel useless, there are people in the comments section commenting timestamps to skip the history of hacksmith when it's already in the video timeline. Not that you shouldn't watch it.
That 1 percent are Karens and  Keven
So... You hiring? 👉🏼👈🏼
*Elon Musk isn't Tony Stark. This guy is!* 🎊🎉🎊🎉
cool, Subscribe my channel
Most you tubers : don’t touch myyyy play buttons   Him: oh let’s slice it in half
Yeah people are dicks. It's hard not to focus on the good and only hear the bad. But you've done some truly magnificent work, not just with the projects you and your team have created, but with creating that team, and building up Hacksmith Industries into something amazing. And regardless of what anyone says, that's an achievement to be proud of.
What happens when two plasma light sabers clash? will it make that weird sound like in the movies?
him and his team are gonna be famous around the whole world, like dangerously famous for innovation and changing the future just watch
think we just found our selves closest thing to beskar
i remember this channel having about 625k subs when i first saw it, im happy its 10 mil now
Hi
Deamn man you got my jiuce.. 😭 Love the channel carry on guysss
YouTube watching this 👁👄👁💧
12:40 thank me later :)
I’m not expecting huge speech
Aruan Felix 2.0
I realy love jour work   Keep it up 😎
Why would you wreck it
I love how the different parts of the video are organized, it makes it so easy to skip to the good bit if you want.
What the hell is that thing made out of??
It's so heart warming to see you going from making captin American sheilds with magnets, to actuall sabers!!! Keep it going you will reach your goal☺️
Plot twist: the play button is made from pure beskar
thank me latter 13:00
And that’s how you make iron mans core
can you make the arc reactor from iron man scene with the play button and lightsaber
I lik haksman indreusrras
Is it possible to build a lightsaber with an extendable blade, out of a material the other once had and the plasma flame around it?
12:24
you have inspired me to become an engineer
Those who dislikes is the one who say "WTF these guy is doing?? That's a freaking YouTube play button!"
Wait is it a real diamond???
Bro subscribe E.squad the creative minds
Are you mad
you keep doin what you do.
Most of the people who complaint about the vidoes have 0 experience in that particular industry.
Love you crazy doy
Go to 15 : 24
the 4.8k dislikers (yes I know it's not a word) are not great people. he spends months just to bring people inspiration (which he has) and awesome content. so for those of you who disliked the video I give you this simple question: why on earth would you be rude to a man who just wants to bring inspiration and joy to those of us who want just to do the kind of thing he does?
So basically , the *Play button had the high ground* 😂
You and your team are great.
I love you. Sigue así amigo, saludos desde México
Dont you even try to cut that beard!
I love your videos and you are so inspiring. Keep up the great work.
2040 hacksmith:today we’re using the tactical alpha war head nuke to destroy the 999999999999T uranium play button
You Hacksmithed it. Lol XD
Average you tubers: I’m gonna keep this special forever and ever  Hack smith: today I just cut my diamond playbutton in half
You burned/melted it. But anyway it's awesome
You are my heroes and one day I want to be like you
Great video but I’m just sad because they ruined a perfectly good play button
This is so much better than just keeping  regular dimond play button on your wall
Bro I remember when you had only 80k good job bro
So happy for you I have been watching you for ever
Others: Hangs play button Hacksmith: Huh... how to get creative.... OH, let's just hang it while it's in two pieces.
Can the protosaber fight with other protosaber?

One more thing I forgot , I thought you breathed helium when you talked with the mask over your face bye bro
Dont let people get you guys down, you guys are frickin awesome! Congrats on reaching 10 mil subscribers
Guys I am here since James didn't have a beard.

As a creator. These are words that transcend all types of fields.  I'm always watching guys!  You guys inspire a goal I wish to gift to others.
The one thing that got him the play button is what destroyed it
14:35 now that’s what a diamond play button should look like
Try melting tungsten
No not the play button noooooooo 😭😭😭😭 WHY?!?!?!?!?!!!?!??
YouTube: am I a joke to you? @hackmsith a real fan of u man...keep rocking
This is why I love hacksmith. They get a diamond play button but they are ready to cut it in half
Not only was it a diamond play button, but it’s now unique, cut in half with the worlds first “light saber”
Good job that great 👍
came because i couldn't believe you'd destroy that wonderful button, actually got captivated by the story behind the hacksmith
4:00 is that dude dead or did he just go to live without youtobe
You should do. Calab with  Mark Rober and do something cool
Welcome all newcomers, to the hacksmith
I will stay with you for your life. I watched every second of the video I heard your story. I love you man and you have and are doing the best you can do. Your the best
I think that community of YouTube now s very angry)
I like the color it changed to
Why do you do

Elon musk: finally, a Worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary
Your turned it into a Goldeneye lazer key haha
Keep up the good work, capitalism is great, non of this in commie country's. Keep spreading real liberal ideas :)
The first guy to brake the diamond play button in half
Mister hacksmith there are to many of them what are we going to do
Thanos play button
When they realise the video wasn’t recording
16:16 that is a silver button 16:24 woah a golden one i wish i could get 16:30 wait which one is this
I’m poor and just 13 years old, I can’t buy that mini play button, but I do dream of being a computer programmer or at least into robotics, maybe become a gaming YouTuber, because what’s the point of your time in life if you don’t enjoy it, life is short, which means I wanna enjoy it😁
when the playbutton started glowing fro the crystal it felt like a arc reactor ready to explode
WHY!!!!🤨
Dude, you've achieved immortality. Why care about Negative Nancies, at all?
14:49 seems like a case hardened from csgo
I just want to say I’ve been such a huge nerd my entire life since childhood and I literally can not tell you how much pure joy these videos have been giving me after the lightsaber one came up on my recommended. Like things haven’t been great recently and I had such a huge dorky smile on my face watching that video the whole time. Thank you for that, I love your channel so much ❤️
That prince of bel-air reference 😂😂
Youtube is smart  Bcz they knew that you are going to do stuff like this on the play button
Why not oxyacetylene? It burns at 6k°f
12:22
Sir u are doing great work please try to continue it
Congratulations hope you're future is as bright as your lightsaber
Cast it all down make your own.
Exactly Why We started our Channel as well. Feel every word. :) Keep up the amazing work.
High budget HowToBasic
The cutting play button part remind me of tony stark making his arc reactor
Imagine youtube see this the gift they gave you
*Watches this video on December 17th, 2020. "You can tell this is a fresh 10 Million Subscribers Button, because we don't have 11 million yet." *Looks at subscriber count at 11.3 Million* LIES
my guy take as mutch time as you need if theres 3 vidios a year its 3 vidios a year just be you.
Why would you do that to your awesome 10 million play button
You should build a Saber Staff!!!
People who say this isn’t a lightsaber because there’s still an energy pack be like “wE wAnT yOu To BrEaK tHe LaWs Of PhYsIcS aNd TeLePoRt To SpAcE tO gEt A pOwEr SoUrCe StRoNg EnOuGh, It’S nOt HaRd!” (Sorry if I broke your eyes)
I love ur vids keep going
12:22
Is YouTube mad?
Can you make a gun with a knife attached to the stock so that if you run out of ammo you have another way to defend yourself
whhhat!? hellz 2the yea. thats the most awesome legit light saber ever, gave me a nerd boner. military will jump all over this thing, could revolutionize CQC 4sure, wouldn't wanna be on the receiving end of that saber. all they need 2do is build a back pack 4it & its perfect
congrats man!
I can feel the struggle in your voice... You deserve a break
I dont know if your gonna see this but I've followed you for years and you have changed my life in ways that i couldn't even begin to explain. when Grant Thomson died i feel a part of him lives on in you and the work you do and the people you inspire. we all love you and are all really proud of what you have created.  my HERO James Hobson
Question. If it’s a lightsaber, then why can’t you duel with them? Just saying
14:20 when you turn the shower water up a little bit too much
I wanna buy this saber
12:43
New hot knife Trend...
12:22 is the timestamp
Ok, but could there be a Chemistry Research Area?
This guy talks toooooooooooooooooo much
Is it made out of real Diamonds?
Why would you Cut it!
Leave a like on this comment for prince of bel air
This is a variant of the oxygen source we know! The lightsaber must immediately cut off where it touches.
Idea: buy another diamond play button and superheat it.
12:42 pass tha BS
me getting play button lets cut it in half we only get it 1 time!!!
That's sad did he died not to make you sad
TÜRK VARMI
Hey do you think you can make a car jump like the speed racer movie?
Hey guys of 17-20th December 2020
Errrrrm, you do have over 11 million subs now, a month later😁
U should combine rectractable hot Rod and hot plasma in one light sabre.
You have earned my respect
EY HACKSMITH!
Apyr
You guys got the same idea I had 3 years ago. Same plasma-based saber
Did he just ruin a cut diamond?!
Fack video
You should cast that metal into small diamond play buttons and give one to each of the staff :D that would be neat
He sounds like a droid when he is talking.
it looks kinda sick when its molten
The beskar exist
Am I the only one who was anxious that the play button is gonna pop and destroy the camera in the front?
الي عربي يدوس لايك
I am 13 and I am planning that I will be applying to join you guys  I have been a huge fan since 2018
12:22
Ok i almost cried
Aruan Canadense
cool future
YouTube:- am I joke to you😂
Bro I'm from India .I think this is the first vedio I am watching in your channel and I became the fan of your channel and you give such an inspirational speech .
Your awesome hacksmith I found your Chanel and loved it
I had so mutch pain watching this
12:25 start
the youtube office are so pissed rihgt now.
They can probably sell that play button for thousands
Tell us! how much income you make off youtube. Ain't so talkative now
Now you will make a new custom diamond play button
12:57 pyro ar u pyro?
is it worth it?
This is why I love this channel he melted a diamond play  button for content he’s amazing melting a hard earned item like this and also having the courage to do it it truly amazing 😉
Aruan?
Wish you guys were able to make the blade longer
Bro you don't look good with long beard and hair
Who cuts there play button
Hey maybe one day I’ll be able to work for you.
I do have a question. Where did the name, “Hacksmith” come from?
Why are people complaining about The Hacksmith being like a business? That was the end goal. To make a realistic Stark Industries
12:22
Love you man you are the best
Please
Not gonna lie, found you guys after the lightsaber, but I like the energy and vision, definitely gonna be sticking around :)
At 10:47 weard Flex bdw
You should make a flying car! You’ve got the talent!
Came here for the first time.  Just for this.  Godspeed!
Lett’s you make battle this lightsaber 4000* vs lightsaber kylo-Ren 3000*
and another thing. this man is pouring his heart out and I really feel for him having lost someone i respect and hold dear so if I see that someone is mad because they didn't get enough lightsaber action well this comment may get deleted but to you who hates on this man for pouring his heart out I HOPE YOU PILLOW IS WARM ON BOTH SIDES EVERY NIGHT.
those people that complain, I don't understand them I'm too busy nerding out and saying "oh my gosh I can really be a Jedi" or "I could have han solo's blaster" and sitting there in shock and awe at what's happening. so who is so insecure that they watch a video series as amazing as this one and says " that was bad" how could it be bad that made a frickin LIGHTSABER how can you be mad that it wasn't perfect all in one little tube and had to have a back-pack. c'mon bro they are trying their absolute hardest.
hacksmith is my go-to channel whenever I feel like I need a little awesomeness in my life. you guys are not the smiths we deserved but the smiths we needed. thank you so much for your hard work and I can't wait until the day when one of your insane but beautiful projects becomes available for public use. like Omni-directional maneuver gear or the hoverboard.
They are going to be the future stark industries
Random person: ohh you reached 10 mil can I see the diamond play button  Them: yeah well about that...
you should get in contact with MrBeast he could sponsor you, it would give you a lot of clout and it would be really fun for both channels and the fans of them
If YouTube give this play button to me I will put it in a safe place
I was expecting the diamond play button to be made of diamond.
Come on guys like and Subscribe right now
Them: We have finally the Diamond Play Button! Me: Ah nice! Congrat! Them: We gonna cut it in half! Me: Wait what
Diamond Play Buttons will be our next walls in a zombie apocalypse
Youtube after hack Smith destroy his play button  uhhhhhhhhh u want that back or uhhhhh u good
12:22
YouTube be like :Abey saale 😂😂
Why would you destroy the real one tho 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😱😱😱
few years ago a brazilian youtuber named Aruan made a video cutting his playbutton. it was one the most disliked videos of youtube. wonder why everybody's liking this one? i think people changed
It hurts me to see this
I have been with you guys from 1M
why!!! r u quiting youtube
He spoke about his wonderful journey in order to avoid hatred from viewers for destroying diamond play button.
Every YouTuber : can we get the diamond play button ?  This guy : can we destroy the diamond play button ? 😂😂
I made a great choice of picking this channel
Love from india, i like your cooking style...👍😎
Whyyyyyyyyyyy
☹️+🌈=🏳️‍🌈
I'm pretty sure I saw you cut through steel doors like butter with that thing? Wth is that play button made of? 🤔
So step 4 is just "Be Tony Stark"? 🤔
This is why there is no bronze play button
Why!!!!
12:22
Year 2040: Hacksmith Industries partnered with SpaceX
You have made history bro......
WHY ARE YOU WASTING THIS JUST FOR A YOUTUBE VIDEO!!!
Hacksmith, if you guys expand the intenrship program, i will be definily applying it
I love your videos they are the best.
New 500,000,000 subscribers play button?
Buttom blue gem hehehehe
Damn.. cooking with the hacksmith is a GREAT show! Please make more XD
3:30 Just really shows that commitment for me,wish I still had my old YouTube account I subscribed to you on but I'm happy to be on this one!   Anyone else just realise how fuckin insane that realistic proto-saber is  (And all other projects)  Cheers 🥂 To many more years with the great Hacksmith team!
Nice
Dont worrry, he will get the platinum one soon
You should try the lightsaber on the unbreakable box!
I wonder how mad YouTube is
Bro u just posted good content You are going to gain subscriber
11:07 Delicious  😙👌  Perfecto
I love your video you inspired me to make stuff
Love your vids!!!:)
I had no idea you and Grant were friends. Thinking about it, it makes total sense that you would be. I was so sad when I heard about his passing. You do a great job with your videos and I'm always amazed at the incredible things you have made in your shop. In fact, I nearly cried when I first saw your video about making a real lightsaber as I'm a giant Star Wars fan and seeing that made me so happy. Keep up the good work!!!
YouTube is probably angry right now
This is tony stark in real life lol
Youtube be like: 🗿
YouTube:did you burn it The Hacksmith: yeah YouTube:at what cost The Hacksmith : umm.. kinda nothing😂
youtube: here is a diamond play button take good care of it   you: lets chop it in half with a fricken lightsabre  me: i would frame it and polish it if i got one
I really hope you read my comment. I'm a brand new viewer, this is only the third or fourth video I've seen and you and your team have blown me away every single time. Your speech at the start I deliberately didn't skip simply because you posted what time to skip to for those who don't care. That 1%. You're exactly the type of person the world needs. The negative comments will always come no matter what you do, where you do it or when you do it. Keep doing what you're doing. At least 10M people enjoy your content. Don't strain yourself or your team too much. To keep the content as good as it is you guys can't be overworked. Sorry for your loss but your buddy was part right. Take breaks when necessary but keep up the amazing work. You're inspiring and wholesome af. I'm glad to be a part of the Hacksmith subscribers. Also, you look so much like Infinity War Cap 👍
Hack smith you’re the best your my favourite YouTuber so don’t be sad because that makes me sad:(
Youtube be like: wtf dude we spent like 20 days making this for it to be destroyed.
Oh I love this channel
Sem o Aruan não tem graça  ;-;
It looked better the more it melted
the hacksmith: Gets diamond playbutton also the Hacksmith: LETS DESTROY IT
Hell yeah dude anything is possible as long as you have a goal and that's also what I'm trying to do on here as well it's just not going as great as you guys but that's probably just because it's a gaming channel lol you guys are amazing keep it up
So it just took 12.44 to get to the point of the video.
Amazing
Man that speech made wanna click the like button so many more times than one
I think what you're doing is amazing is keep on going, don't beat yourself up over some complaints. You can't always make everybody happy, that's what I learn in life.
I had to make a new account  but I was around the 1000 sub
WAIT WHAT 1,000,000,000 SUBSCRIBER HUH?
12:12                                                            I didn't skip : )
This makes me cry
Pensei que era um video do aruan felix
I do have a question: lightsabers actually have a strong built like it cuts as a solid-plasma so, is it actually possibly to build lightsabers like those edit: also good luck on your journey it has inspired me a lot  maybe in future I may join hacksmith industry
It diamond play button Don't do this
Noooo diamond button
But the question is will they get a new diamond play button?
gotta give props to YouTube for making a damn durable button to withstand that much protosaber
I like the king of bel-air refrecnce
i remember when you where a tiny youtuber
This reminded me off when tony stark made the new core for his arc reactor
Start video at 12:33  & Thank me later...🙃

His electrical bill ⬆️⬇️↗️↘️↙️⬅️➡️↙️↗️↘️⬇️↗️⬅️↘️➡️↗️⬇️↙️⬅️↗️⬇️↙️
YouTube watching this like  👁👄👁 ?
Have you guys tried using sound waves to modify the oscillation of the plasma in the lightsaber to condense it and make it more lightsaber like. I mean it's already been proven that sound waves can affect plasma so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch.
@Hacksmith Industries Congrats at the Guinness Book of World Records. That is so awesome. Your lightsaber is legit and badass.
Wait did your friend die
Hacksmith started as a youtube channel, and became a industry. I'm excited for Hacksmith Incorporated.
Greetings, you did it, I'm Peruvian and I like your channel :D, you also inspired me. Now I'm a mechatronic.
you cut a play button in half... I would have said something dumb here but that is what i would have done

5 years later we have made a real life lightsaber that actually works
O cara superou o Aruan , esses gringos estão em outro patamar ksksksksk

You idiots not the 10 millions diamond suscriber !!!!
SUPER SMITH?????       jokes aside I love the vids

Well it's nice to know there are 4000 dick heads in the world
It kinda looks like iron man shooting a laser out of his chest
I joined you channel because of you're realistic and upfront truth telling video.  Bro don't worry about the haters. In this world there WILL ALWAYS BE CRY BABIES. GOD  can literally come down from the sky with the biggest lite show display in the world 🌎. Still people will be like to God. Hey you're entrance was wrong. Lol so don't worry about the wankers who live in there mother's basement.
This man has worked really hard and made a real light saber he deserves a break well earned
Disclaimer:   Please don’t  try this at home to avoid burning your house down.
Wwwwwhhhhhhhyyyyyy
I was really surprised. Some people really do this.  I was deeply impressed.  I will definitely show this video to my children.
Wooow I wonder why I only now found this channel... Guys you are amazing! And this lightsaber is just blowing my mind! Well done and keep up with as great projects!!!
People don’t appreciate all that the hacksmith does for everyone.
My name mr 🧀
14:22 i would leave it like this, looks awesome in blue.
You gained another sub today i just found you through the lightsaber stuff but you and your team are awesome i absolutely love what you stand for and im canadian as well. Your masterplan is amazing man keep the good work
Is that play button made of Beskar?!?!
What would win: Lightsaber Or Minecraft Diamond Armour
How’s watching in 2021
Oooooooooh wat a flex! Lom9on
this is like a dream come true, i always wanted someone to make a lightsaber with controlled length. we’re closer than ever to making a real one
Frick those people who complain about the future! You ARE our future!
I love ror videos
Nice vid, suggestion, DOOM GUY GEAR!
Why don’t you guys merge the first protosaber you made and this one so you could duel with them and it’ll be stronger?
youtube: here you playbutton    Hacksmith : imma burn it   youtube : why   Hacksmith : its gonna be epic
Hey can I come over I live 5 minutes away and also I’ve been here from the start you make the best content and inventions I love you and why do I want to eat the play button
I like the team without the team the light sabre wouldn’t have existed eventually yes but this quickly noYou need a team to bounce ideas off each other you need a team so you can take a break and more often than not when you’re not thinking of the project that is when you get the best idea for the project
4:16 WATCH TIME 69%
It is okay James you are the best u tuber I have ever seen
You monster.  I can't give this video a like in good faith.
Just why you worked hard and melted the play button why just give it to melol!
Who is here after NEON MAN
Please tell me you have 2
That YouTube buttom isn't diamond. It's beskar
Y would u do that 😭😭😭😭. Low key it still looks cool tho
YouTube: congratulations on 10 million subs! Here’s a diamond play button  Hacksmith: b u r n  i t  YouTube: w h a t
Sir l am your big fan
Kkkkkkkkkkk Aruan Jedi mkkkkkkk
Why would anyone want his/her diamond playbutton to do like this. This is very unsatisfying
Dang sounds like he’s holding back tears when talking at the beginning
He's pretty good at that 👍👍👍
Lowkey the play button looks more FIRE than before
H3h3 hi
🥺😭👏
Do you still hire new people to work for your team 😅? I wish I could work for your team. (i'm sorry if my english isn't that correct, I don't know)
the hacksmith is my favorite YouTube  channel
Diamond Playbutton I Case Hardened
This is video is like howtobasic was smart but doesnt listen to half the shit that comes out of his mouth
12:22
Here’s a challenge: A wireless lightsaber.
He is a really ambitious man.. I salute!!
Always we are here to support you sir.
quick subcribe Hacksmith, I want to see Ruby play button being cut!
TOTAL INSPIRATION TO EVERYBODY.  I HAVE STRIVED TO BE LIKE YOU IN YOUR WORK AND IT IS TOTALLY MY DREAM TO WORK IN STEM FIELDS AND ENGINEERING AND I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS AND WANT TO BE LIKE YOU! KEEP UP YOUR WORK IMMA DM YOU ON INSTAGRAM IN ALL CAPS CUZ I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON HOW TO BE LIKE YOU
In the madalorian the light saber was like a hot stick when she was hitting beskar metal
12:22
The diamond button is done of almost pure beskar
12:22
Not even close to a lightsaber, I guess you are at least three to four orders of magnitud in energy output less than it actually takes to pierce almost instantly that play button
Did the play button take longer to cut then the vault?
Ok mhm
YouTube give "play button" YouTuber mind "let's make this as content 😎😎
Congratulations man  I thought i just came for the video but subbed after I saw how much you care for your fans
Love this Chanel and this community, thank you guys for your amazing videos. Proud member of the Hacksmith community
Seriously, why does youtube keep sending buttons if everybody just like to destroy'em
The progress of this channel over the years is awesome. I can’t wait to see where it is in the next 5 years from now. Best wishes on your success!
Avengers: lets hire this dude
"gone...reduced to ashes"
Look guys it's Jesus
Why YouTube give play buttons to these kind of people...
Bro make the sentry of team fortress 2
Bro respect
Omg it's a diamond play button
My whole country is apparantly subscribed to you (sweden)
Youtube is triggered 😤
thats a really strong play button
"You can tell this one is fresh because this channel doesn't have 11 Million subscribers yet" uhh... Should I tell him?
You may not be tony stark, but you're as good as we're gonna get. Thank you for all you've done, I really liked the lightsaber.
Well I think the lightsaber video made you a nationally recognized industry
I can't take the fresh Prince of Bel-Air reference 12:22
i can feel his emotions internally  he is sooo superb LOVE YOU 3000
Its all good your videos are the best
Just want to let you know, my 8 year old loves your channel. Keep up the awsome work putting out educational, yet fun content. You may be inspiring another Winnipeg boy.
I love how you guys are wearing masks unlike other people😄😄
I like the intention, but it will be harder and harder to keep your dream of giving back to humanity going as your company gets bigger and bigger. I was excited for Elon too in past, but he really showed he cared more about production than his workers when he refused to shutdown to protect his workers from a pandemic. But still, maybe you do better. Good luck.
YT: *@"$'##
why don’t u just delete bad comments?
Hi, I just discovered your channel like 1 hour and a half ago with the proto-saber and I've watched all the heart to heart part there, and I have to tell... you're very inspiring, I've had quite a hard time these past months about work and morale, but listening to you made me realize that having a goal is one of the most important things of all. I felt all of your emotion about the 'complainers', a'd I wish you all the best for both the channel and every single project you're working on or thinking of!  And I obviously follow the channnel and keep aware of every single video you'll post. Thanks for what you do
Plasma plated ak47 death ray vs neon cock ring
Noobs only dislikes
Studies : So in order to make a light Saber you need to have a lot of knowledge of chemistry, physics, and computer science.     Hack Smith industries : bruh
hi
In 14:19 he should just keep his play button like that
Just merch for now.... WAIT
Your videos are so amazing and you are such a cool dude! Keep doing what you’re doing and don’t stop!

You know what’s crazy in legends the Jedi started off with light sabers with energy packs so this is kinda like it I’m really convinced this guy can build a really light saber
How tf 4K people dislike this
Hacksmith: that is the population of sweden  Us: How did he know
Do darth Moul lightsaber
Play button is beskar
When the video starts 12 minutes in
i loved your fresh prince of bell-air refrence
The Kylo show: cutting random shit in half. I think it’d blow up.
I'm changing my name to Jonathan Irons, i'm gonna buy your company and I'm gonna rename it to Atlas. And nobody can stop me
Congratulations sir you deserve it  You're the best 👏👏👏👏
I doubt YouTube would allow this, but could we possibly get a video where you use it on an animal or something like that. Of course, you would then have to say, “It will keal.”
Youtube when seeing this 😀🙂😐
Ctm el capitan amera wn
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 im new here and i am already like you👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The hacksmith play button
Now when can we buy it
Y tho?
5:00 he's tearing up so much, adorable
Anyone interested in gaining followers on Instagram or tiktok??
Noice
Listening to you chock up abit about not doing things on your todd but as a team now.... a simple quote for this "Teamwork makes dreamwork" .... also doing something on your own more prone to mistakes but as a team you can all see it and spot if a mistake appears..... KEEP up the good work it makes me smile and NERDGASM!!!!
I can't wait till hacksmith industries starts selling protosabers
I was watching and forgot your name
Ppl who was here from when they were just 700k subs

Your channel, know how, passion and personality actually got me into engineering and I think you and your teams ability is going to take Hack smith Industries really far. U r the best at what u do and that's the truth bro, don't forget that. Keep it up!!!! (Also, the haters can go get f*cked)     :):)
I wish I can build stuff but these cost like a $1,000,000
Best channel on YouTube

Case Hardened Play Button
Oh my brain
I am sorry for you . You are sacrificing ....
Real d button? Why??
Is a diamond play button ACTUALLY made of diamond? Cuz if so you could just cut pieces of the diamond play button and sell it for like....i dunno 600 dollars? Diamonds pretty valuable
Jeez, I swear it was like last week when i subscribed and the count was less than a million.
Hey guys! I’m making custom edits!!!(I just started making videos for people)  15 Secs/$10 10/$7  Custom time can’t be over 50 secs. (For a Typo)  IG : @Beta.Edit

Hacksmith: reveals research campus Me: where do I sign
12:22
Where is the sex part?
So it seems we all need an armor of the material of the play button and we will name it beskar. Then we can fight like pure mandalorians
I follow this channel from less than 1 M subs... and once i left a very rude comment... i'm so sorry about that, your're making an incredible job.
I rly wanted to win the mini diamond playbutton
Oml im too late
This was already a month ago? How tf?
I think you are real iron man by your work and your heart
Why did he have to push it at the end🥺 it looked so cool with the play sign still intact and then he breaks it

Love it
Why do I hear a major key modified imperial suite from rogue one
"A dash of lemon juice " squeezes the all of the lemon juice out.
14:34 That's how the diamond playbutton should look originally.
This channel and others like it have given me so many ideas but I don't have the tools to make things and I don't know how to do the things you guys do but you have inspired me on an intergalactic level so I'd like to say thank you and congrats on 10M
12:22
I hope you get a new one
Think about how cool it would be to have  a diamond play button that you cut in half with the thing that made you get it
So your friend died ? :(

Hacksmith: creates light saber and provides to cut everything*  Me: "ya I would do the same"
I think you should make the mandalorians sniper blaster
Diamond play buttons are proto-saber resistant..........good to know

You read all of your comments? If you see this, can reply “Hello”?
Give this man more money so he can create extraordinary things, introduce him to Elon musk.
This gives me faith in humanity, it makes me believe anything is possible.
Could you use electromagnetic currents that somehow surround the blade to make it more of a defined stream?
If you ever fight i Jedi just make sure you bring your easy to get 10mil play button

The hacksmith, the king of random(only grants videos), Alec Steele, Colin furze and Mark rober have all inspired me a 13 year old boy from England to start engineering and creating right at this moment I am designing my first ever project which is captain America wakanda shield. My ultimate dream is to create a technology business which specialise in renewable energy and creating products to help the disabled whether that be bionic legs and arms or artificial hearts which can save lives I want to do it. I also want to create a new energy source which is self sustaining I also want to make exo skeletons to help the disabled as well. I wouldn’t want them to be used for military uses but it would be fighting evil and I want to help people because of you, Grant Thompson, Alec Steele, Colin furze and Mark rober. You and the rest have inspired me to try to create a better world so thank you all of the people mentioned thank you for doing what you do
who else thinks that it looks cool when its blue
YouTube worker:Why we need to send him the youtube diamond button? YouTube:We will put a resistant material and not plastic. Hacksmith: XD
Why so Many haters
This is not a diamond play button ! it's literally a BESKAR play button !
If it makes you feel better I really love your videos and when is the newest power loader video coming out?
The play button fought a good fight til the end
No price pays off for what you do. Not even a diamond playbutton. So much respect to what you and your team do! I really Hope to get to meet you one day!
you should make a Mandolorian helmet or the amban sniper would be preety cool!
Other youtuber with 10 million: *keeps it safe* Hacksmith: *cuts it*
Hes kinda really crazy by in a good way
I like how they even use their reward for making things to make things
I know I’m late to this but all your projects were awesome
12:22
Its really bad you did this to your 10m play button
Hey man, just wanted to say, you inspire me and my buddy all the time! Thank you so much for all you do! It would mean the world to me and my friend to meet you!🤪😜
Tell me why it turned case hardened
Omg a lightsaber irl 😊😍😄
Petition to google . Plz send them a new one
Youtube: *gives diamond play button  These guys: "Let's cut it in half with a lightsaber.  Youtube: "NANI"
your the best keep going I want a play button
Hacksmith: destroys YouTube play button   Me: nO dOnT dEsTrOy ThE pLaY bUtToN
youtubers: get play button also youtubers: ima do something dumb to it
When he started talking abour Grant he had such a sad voice and i cried
Why??
Him:oh i have 10 million play button now huh LeTs BrEaK iT Me: Bruhhhhhhhhhhh
why.just WHY?!
Make c3po droid
y does it look cooler after he melted it wit da proto saber
Why do they always put these sound effects in
This YouTube channel makes me want to build planes and then fly said planes thank you soooo muchh for inspiring meeee
Class video mate. You should try build the wrist gauntlets on the mandelorian. That would be class to see
did he just blow up that lemon with one hand
What is the point of doing this
He unlocked the Damascus play button
i feel honored to be an old subscriber
Naturally, it takes 13 minutes to get to the title content.
I'm pretty sure about one thing nobody's gonna mess with his kids anytime cuz they know they have then have to face a real life jedi(or sith)
Why are you doing this with your play button
I love how close we are getting to star wars technology. In star wars legends, there was a type of saber called a proto saber, which was wired to a battery pack. Granted the battery pack was a hip mounted one and was obviously much smaller, but technology is ever improving, so maybe someday we can all wield real lightsabers.
Whats inside?
Omg just why
Sorry for the bad comments that get you down James, but you have so many hundreds of thousands of fans that love and respect you and the team, you’re all awesome! Keep up the amazing work!
Congratulations hack smith u got a Nobel prize for creativity.  Hack smith: I nuked the Nobel prize with my iron man missiles
YouTube made besscare armor
Bro your greatest creation in your team😀
Mr hacksmith can you maybe make a program we’re people start an apprenticeship or learn from you don’t know if you’ll read this but yea
I wonder if a lightsaber could cut through vibrainum 🤔
You are a good man. God bless you
Apparently 10m play buttons are made of Beskar. Who knew.
U DESERVE MORE
Uyyyyylftjsxgdyljhf aedrhshwh sereasly
Your channel doesn't need a dislike button.
Average YouTuber: I’m gonna hang up my play button on my wall  Hacksmith: I’m gonna SLICE my play button in half!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this just makes me sad
This guy actually look like captain america
Oh my gawd is like slicing anakin and then burning him!
Wow, what a truly amazing and remarkable man. Congratulations on everything, you and your crew deserve the best. Love you guys y’all are are best
That bluish colour at around 14:18  is 👌
I grow up on you and Grant it’s so sad to see one of y’all gone I wish he was still here today as well.
need to get in touch with  a gun youtuber like demolition ranch and set up a target behind the blade, then shoot through it, to see if the lightsaber will block(melt) the bullet.
it is really diamond?
No mater how many play buttons are played Jesus is King     Read: Revelation 21:8, John 3:16
this speach is so beautiful i cryed and you can do it i know you can your going to change the world
still cant believe that ur first vid was about u doing a backflip off a tree and now u have 10 million subs
What happens if u use it against a mirror?🤔
Wow this is dumb as shit, just cutting one of your biggest accomplishments in half and you don’t care
cruel
Frankly I'm new here, but Holy Cow, the reason our technology isn't more advanced is because people like these don't get the resources they could utilize. I Love your work!
Im a real fan
brasil cut the play buton first
It takes guts to do this 😭
What horrible 4.3K humans being unliked the video??
me after 0.000000005 second: Bla Bla Bla less talking more cutting
Makes me think of Iron man’s core reactor
When he started talking about Grant I almost started crying..
He waited a decade just to burn it
Its looking much better now! Thats amazing.
12:20
I soo wish you had a "nerdy" counterpart to this channel!
Imagine not knowing you can get another play button
This is a man that I would love to to work for!!!!
Amazing
At 15 mil can you cut your arm out with it
So whens the Mass production to buy one!!
Dude you don’t have to make every weeks worth video you don’t have to because people say so it’s your life not ours
👏 wow
Dem beats
OMG THE PLAY BUTTON GAVE THEM BESKAR. That’s actually sick I would take that and make mandolorian armor. (Video idea) but you do you keep being awesome guys.
I have one question...     How do you get your play button so tender? My one always shatters in the oven.
Wait, now that the Hacksmith is Hacksmith Industries. Can we buy shit and hire you for our own projects now?
12:22
Nooooo not the play button
You made me cry

Flamethrower*
Imagine a play button that lasts longer in extreme heat than a safe
This video proves that the diamond play button is literally made of real diamond
Now that you made a lightsaber you should try to make beskar steel
2:40

Intresting
11:06 *a bit of pepper, more like a pile of pepper you donkey!* -Gordon Ramsay, apparently

Guys like him are the ones who puts out good content that really elevate our mind. They need the subscribers and views not some punks like pewdiepie who games and puts out worthless content and that doesn't do any good.
Since you read almost every comment hi James:) you have saved my life because your videos kept me going through hard times
12:22
That is one durable play button! Good luck with your master plan!
I love your work
How do you even hit the dislike hahaha they just dislike themselves this is incredibly inspiring
Skipping just doesn’t feel right
Bro y
Watching it 3 weeks later when the channel is already at 11 million
Now can you rebuild it? Make it stronger, better?
4 yr old me when I get a stick at the campfire:
Honestly you deserve a break you all do at the hacksmith
Not that I was expecting the diamond play to be cheap, but it's built way better than I thought.
12:25 video starts
Youtube: How can you do this? This is outrageous! It's unfair!
No offense Dude but get a hair cut
You kind of looked like the winter soldier with the mask and goggles
I love how they just want to test a very dangerous weapon in their currently biggest achievment
Hacksmith reaches 100m   Toutube:noooooooo
The diamond is like soul stone
L this is like trying to make tony stark chest peace
Is there anything past the diamond play button?
Imagine being this cool
If they can lightsabers in 2020, imagine what they could do in 2030
Hi. Your photo doesn't display correctly when trying to share this video on Facebook. Maybe look into that.

How could anyone have skipped the video 😿
at 7:40 i was like woaahhhh, i remember when you guys first moved into the hacksmith warehouse garage place, since then y’all have grown like crazy, that’s wassup.
So a bunch of diamond playbutton armor can protect you for a while from the ferocious light saber, from the distant invasion of the dark side?  The theory is that most of the people reading is forgetting how there hair is being "I LIKE YA CUT G"
Why dude
Thank you for the speach 2 Hours after I watch this I became famous in my school because I made my own EV3 Robot and please go to my channel to see it
HACKSMITH HOW ITS SMELLS WHEN YOU melt down @ Diamond play button ?
The play button is made of Beskar metal

Aruan Felix??
Love from India
I’ve been here for 6 whole years, loved every video I’ve seen, you guys totally deserve this milestone.
To be honest, that orange and blue playbutton looks so much cooler than the original “silver” diamond playbutton.
Can u make web shooter is it possible
I used the lightsaber vidio as a tutorial to make my own it cost me 300,000 dollars
We love the one true king of random
When he was explaining everything about the Channel and everything He sounded really Emotional.
Dude, you got 200k likes. Just do it!
This absolute legend made a REAL Porto saber just to please his fans!
Bouta make me cry talking about grant Thompson
James I just have one word for u "insane" yeah ur freaking insane made a channel like this....woahhh and I'm not forget about ur team too they very awesome...keep up ur work thanks for made a glorious content and a lot of tools... :))
F
This brought a tear to my eye man, I look forward to seeing your ambition come into reality like a bombshell big love from a dirty welder in Baltimore
With all of the machining and engineering capability on display here, as well as the industrial workspace and natural attention / self advertisement your youtube platform generates, it seems a very natural extension of that would be to create an actual business arm that sells specialized machined components of some sort or sells their services for specialty one off productions, even if just to produce revenue to break even and justify their existence towards being leveraged into bigger spaces and bigger projects!
You should work whit mark Robert
I love how he says “naturally” when he is using a 4000 degree lightsaber to cut his stuff
I cant belive you did it O_o
I have a feeling they will make the first ever real power armor from fallout
is the middle of the diamond play button actually diamond?
Ehmm... It’s not fresh anymore. You guys passed 11 million. ;(
Gordon Ramsay would be proud
Most Youtubers: OMG I got the diamond play button!!! Hacksmith: DIE
why does the kid in 2:24 look like jefferys girlfriend jillian from dangle bros
Is it possible to make the lightsaber longer
Hack smith      yay we got our diamond play button let’s celebrate   Team   Yeah drinks on me  Hack smith   By cutting the play button in half
Cool but can you make the mutishot crossbow from dark souls 3
I wonder how expensive a molten diamond is
Why did you do it to your play button subscriber prize
The Hacksmith -- One funny dude who makes stuff real, but then out of no where becomes the world's funniest cook : )
I was to late to get a play button
You inspired me to start being an engineer
Your at 11 million subs now
Because you got 10 million save your beard and get a hair cut
Stop I'm crying
They should make a Proto Darksaber
i cant belive he did this for his channel members
selling those sabers yet?
After watching this  YouTube : we will not make a fault of giving him a custom play button 😅😆😆😆 Just joking.... You will hit 50 million very soon
You are made
Shout out to TOAST
Thank you
If you could sit through this video and still criticize them, blow me
It's so pretty when its blue
Bro you melt my heart.... I subscribed you... But then also why I don't know you wanna do 2 prices of play button ... My dream 😥
the diamond play button is like our version of beskar
I may look really rebelic but with this guy I show my nerd inside me
I heard you made it to Guinness World Records congratulations
How do we cancel the payment if we join?
This reminds me of auruan felix Just search for his name and placa
kind of sad that the playbuttons broken
if the play button was left at being blue that would of been epic
Why don’t we get to see the top ove the saber
Well, It hard to break 10M
sorry about that i think you are the best
I'm sure Youtube won't be sending another one of those.
if you want to have a lightsaber proof door you have to make it out of diamond play buttons
Its so sick that you have gotten 10 000 000 subs I have gotten to watch you grow from 50 000 to 10 000 000 good job dude
why do you have to do this?
Being honest the hacksmith is a legend
Burn it
Youtube : am I a joke to u
Tell me if his the first to cut in a half of that Diamond Play button
12:22 to see what you came for
5 years from now you're going to make a hovering car     I know you will even if it isn't as good as people will want it. Even if it's just a platform that you can stand on and will float and move    I believe in u and many others do the people who don't just doesn't wanna see anyone suceed
This actually made me have a legit extrasential crisis
Youtube watching this must be like

This is The Dumbest Idea
I Have Not Skipped Any Of These Precious Seconds
Wow man i occasionally watched what new inventions you were making i still don't understand why people are not already satisfied the inventions on this channel are awesome this world is really a hard world and you gotta work really hard to see results happening i don't know if i can say this but good job💪🏻
Youtubers out their wishing they could someday get the diamond play button and this dude here is just using his like a test dummy for science experiments XD

That's an insult to youtube 😂
Omg that play button look delicious 🤤🤤🤤🤤
Dont sell it please

You need to do it like forged in fire and use the saber on a pig carcass, then look at the camera and say "it will keeeel"
12:22
YouTube be like 👁👄👁
Hacksmith: we don’t have 11mil subs yet Youtub: * laughs in 3weeks later *
I have been subscribed for 3 years
Can you make doctor octopus tentacles?
Its Still Not A Saber Because In Starwars They Actually Could Make Contact With Another Saber in a duel like swords colliding
this is how hacksmith creates a new element
I miss Grant, :(
Fuck motivational videos this takes the cake
all jokes aside HOW TOUGH IS THAT DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON?!
that new ligthsaber is almost perfect, all you need now is to make him slashing weapon
I am amazed by yours and other youtubers work i want to make an impact as well. I dont see myself as a face of youtube creating original content. However i very much want to and have no idea where to start. I suppose i have no idea what im even doing
The sturdy columnist ordinarily undress because ethernet corroboratively reign below a blue-eyed tugboat. supreme,  far-flung pedestrian
12:22
thank youyou, I can't thank you enough. I'm a twelve-year-old who wants to make stuff and you have really convinced me to keep pulling myself, pushing myself, and running at top speed to the dream of being like you. i want to be like you an inventor who is both smart and funny thank you
Why you destroy it?
I BELIVE THIS MAN AND HIS FRIENDS CAN CHANGE THE WORLD 🥲😌😊
Would you do that to your diamond play button
I Wonder what would happend if he pur a steak on the table

HI YOUR MY FAYVRIT YOUTUBER
(-:    0-=   O-: (-;
Don't care about the 1 percent  sucking comments just go on bro good luck
12:30 is when it's actually what the video is named for...
That  blue colour is very familiar  I once was boiling water in a vessel  It was about 10 :30 and I slept by mistake  I woke up at 3 in the night and I saw that the had evaporated and my vessel had turned red and side it was blue  I had shat my pants  God's grace nothing unwanted happened
You gotta do the Vibro blades from the Mandalorian or legends lore.
This channel is amazing I’m so glad I can see this and feel so inspired. I really want to know how so many of these work... and you make it seem so easy but it’s hard and I know it is.
👏👏👏👍❤️ Your Vision!
<3<3
What about cutting a car in half please do video about it its really cool
Good job but this kinda made me low-key angry
When the youtube bottom was melting I was crying 😭😭
Yes
12:40 There you go
I actually feel kinda sorry for that diamond lol.  It REALLY put up quite the fight.
Great video
Make infinity gaudlet
Why would they complain about your video’s
wait did i just realised that this channel only has 10 million subs
Hope you guys go bigger and bigger with new members and instalations. I wanna say that you guys make me feel that I could do whatever I want, you guys created so much incredible things that I thought they were imposible to create. If I could in my next years I will love work with you guys. But feeww years, Im actually planing of doing a rocketery engineer career. Thanks a lot of making me think about creating things like a meca and good luck.
You are looking like Little older obi wan  kenobi than in second movie
Hacksmith: Hits 10M Subscribers  YouTube: "Congratulations! Here's a 10M Play Button! Make sure to take good care of it!"  Hacksmith:
Next up a car that is affordable but runs off saltwater
Can’t please everyone don’t bitch about it
Unbreakable box vs lightsaber
Feels like you could build a blaster rifle
Poor Jacksucksatlife prob cringing right now
Are you Crazy
Youtube : not going to sent anymore playbutton 😂😂😂
noooooooooooooo
I love your videos
So wait, what kind of metal is the rest of the play button made of? Or is it all 100% diamond?
Are people seriously complaining?? Guys this guy and his team are creating the impossible just stop whining and actually enjoy their work!! These are awesome people with really entertaining personalities, so please give them the props they deserve ❤️
“Destruction is the real engineering” 😂
Imagine youtube watching this and being like: We paid so much for that and he melts it to nothing
14:24 it much cooler than the original diamond play button
U enspired me to make a carbord Spider-Man web shooter
Thats amazing 😢😭😭😭
people say he destroyed his play button. No, he perfected it
Make two and clash then
i didnt get it. What milestone they just hit?
Youtube: We should've given it to someone else
I like the fresh prince of bel air intro
I really appreciate your willingness to be vulnerable with us, far too often we forget that you are just a person and your team are just people like all of us, so it's extraordinarily comforting and refreshing to be reminded that people like you that we look up to for many different reasons are human too!
I feel bad for anyone who tries to rob you
How about if you do an Front Flip out of the same Tree in your first video that start this adventure :)
I have the idea the play button diamond sword
Y did u do that
I wish I was this smart so I could make cool stuff
Aruan cyberpunk
Skip to 12:45 youll thank me later.
also you should cast the inner playbutton metal into the hilt of another lightsaber if thats possible
Congrats man! you make a pipe dream into a feasible and viable career that has inspired millions of people all over the world. thank you.
Turns out beskar actually isn't indestructable...
You guys should make a dark saber
I would like an EDC lightsaber thank you please
These people are crazy smart
This mans development aloud he desved everything
why
Can you make han solo’s blaster mk II like you did 2 years ago?
Wow
The fresh prince of hacksmith
When he said he wants to send ripples through the universe all I could think is you already have. In so many ways you've inspired future inventors, and yes I say inventors because all stem feilds can be boiled down to invention. I think I speak for all the long time fans when I say, I'm grateful for you to be my inspiration.
Do it to pewdiepies ruby play button
12:22 there ya go so u don’t have to do it ur self
I love ur vids and all but can i recommend u something, do starwars and marvel collab like do a lightsaber vs whatever example Tony 's helmet
"We dont have 10 mil subscribers yet" Hmm yes you do (yes i know im 3 weeks late and it wasnt back then)
Imagine if we had more people like him. Our tech would be 30 years ahead of what it’s at right now.
"we dont have 11 million subscribers yet" now you do
What’s best to major in to do what you do?
This is very cool, I've been watching you for a few years now, and I'm so happy to see how much this channel has grown.
Beat channel
Sir, how can I be like you I just love you and your work in India all of us 15 year students are  said to be an Engineer or Doctor and then do job and enjoy life with our families ,but the real fun of being an  Engineer is taken by you .I'm just a kid hope to get a reply on - What should I do in future a job or my passion and ambition ?
You are the best YouTuber
I noticed watching the flashlight and lightsaber videos that you really don’t do everything yourself, and I realized that that’s actually an amazing thing. Growing a business where you have a team of 10+ people making amazing projects all the time, it’s just so awesome. I don’t really know where I’m going with this. I’m very proud of you and your team, and I wish you all the best of luck :)
You're the first one who told to skip your own video
That’s not a diamond play button that’s Damascus
I have a really dumb idea for a “laser sword” It’s like a normal sword except half the blade it’s a laser of some sort
Dear dislikers nobody is perfect on this planet not you also...🙏🙏🙏
Is your friend dead if yes im sorry😔
We are with you keep it up 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
One of a kind
Me gustaría que estuviera en ajustes los subtítulos en español :c
Looks like he is giving a thank you speech after receiving the play button. Anyway, I love your videos. Love you bro
It’s cool how his beard shows how much stuff he has done

I'm a new subscriber here so I don't know everything they did to get to where they are, but it's heart warming to listen to him talk about their goals. Love you man, keep doing the things you love ❤.
Was he sobbing ?
I died watching this
I am now mildly sad that he doesn’t actually have a cooking show
Bilender den Sa
Just why am i not impressed?
I've always wanted to be an engineer but I'm not very good at math 😅... How do I start my journey at 18 do these kinds of things? I don't expect to make lightsabers or anything but I want to learn! Does anyone have any advice on this kind of aloft dream of mine?
I'm literally crying right now 0:23-10:12
The lightsaber technology in iron man’s repulser
We all miss grant Thomson too

Don't do this to your d
Is he ok
Am I the only one that wants a slice of the Diamond play button to eat?
i still miss grant :(
I have an idea and I don’t know if it’s possible, but I would love to see the Mandalorian stun rifle thing. Also I really appreciate your videos and all the amazing things you’ve done. I am sorry that people set very high standards and think that you should ignore the haters.
11 mil
LOL the 1% of comments are judt comments of karens
I love you so much

Diamond play button actually is made of diamonds
13:00 And that folks is how to make your Diamond play button have a gold play symbols and a silver block
12:28 Great song. Listen to it all the time
That's not a diamond play button, that's a beskar play button
Jack new enemy
I love your ambition you are an inspiration to so many keep working hard and climbing that ladder and who knows what impact you will make
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
i will just say this...i dont know about others but I understand . that's all
No one: Me: case hardened play button 14:15
Best video 😹
I think you should try shoot a bullet through the flame i k ow not much will happen probably but it would still be cool or maybe even a nerf dart
Your videos make my week
Bilender'den sa
You are so intelligent
ight this is completely unrelated but the history of hacksmith bit is somehow giveing me the god waht was it called i forgot it is giveing me vibes from mgs3 the og personals beacuse thier orignal idealoliges were so pure now what iam imagining is when the hacksmith perishs a new person will take his place and that person idealogies wont be so pure  and so on and so forth
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
keep up the good work you’re coming into a great YouTuber also I think I have a video idea. you should melt a play button into a sword
I’ll always be a subscriber. This video is awesome. And the “master plan” is a great plan and you are working hard to your goals. Personally there are many ways people can impact humanity in a positive way. What you are doing with exoskeletons is a huge step. Elon has his batteries. Etc personally I think someone should find a affordable way for the average Joe to convert their vehicle to electric. Or the know how of using robotics, and even the operations of using 3d printing. The more things like this is taught the more “thinkers” we will have in the world which will only advance us further.
14:26 When he is actually about to profit, because he made case hardened 95% blue gem on playside.
hi james i am from india i am a huge fan ok huge ok  one doubt ask youtube another play button ok hope u understand ok bye see u i am ahuge fan ok bye  good luck for iron man armor  i know u can do it ok good luck hacksmith bye

Hack smith 2050: real Star Wars lightsaber that slices everything
YouTube management looking at this:........dude that cost us a fortune
Why isn’t any military would want to work with him
Congrats!
I love building things and you guys have been a HUGE inspiration for me, I’m 12 and I built my first go kart this summer because I watched your videos and thought,” wow, that’s so cool” so I just wanted to say, thank you
Thank you for keeping us entertained.
here is the part id want to skip but it cost 1 like        12:22
He Is The Chosen One that will change the world that we live on later on the future we will remember how this man had change the world from simple making a YouTube channel and many great videos  step by step he is changeing and making the world a better place.
anyone who disliked this video is a jerk
Uh Youtube we need a new play button...ours kinda....melted, there is no science on how to explain it to you!
Just thought of a invention y’all can do I hope u see this hack smith but you should make a magnetic glove for the lightsaber when u open ur hand the magnet would react so u have that pull force and when u close ur hand like a fist u have the push force like the opposite side of a magnet or make a separate globe for ur other hand
I grew up watching Grant and when I saw you two together in a video thats when I found you and I'm so glad I had the both of you to grow up watching and seeing amazing things be made. Thank you so much for the amazing content and thank you for proving that anything is possible with the help of people around you and the proper resources😁😁😁😁😁😁
But I still love the hack smith
It’s really cool but it’s basically a big and really hot Bunsen burner
Do you guys have stock? Do you guys plan to take the company where you can own stock? Your company is amazing, ideas and engineering behind them are genius. I’ve always been fascinated with technology hence why iron man will always be my favorite money but I want to invest, learn, and be part of your company
There’s a big difference between constructive criticism and toxic criticism which targets the person and demoralises the person which is not right if you have a bad comment it’s important to do it properly. Keep going you are doing great work here almost nowhere on YouTube which is sad Edit: currently in uni and hope to join this amazing team one day.
The master plan is amazing . I always thought since I started watching this channel it would be awesome for you guys to do something like that . Pretty much a school of cool and crazy tech . Awesome can't wait to see
Th e play button reminds me of tony starks broken armour at the end of endgame
Bro, this channel has been an inspiration to me all thought my teenage/young adult life, this channel truly holds a special place in my heart.
God damnit... I didnt want to cry but bring up Grant.... Damnitttt
That lightsaber is soo cool!! Can I ask that lightsaber for Christmas? 😂
Hello James shave your Beard and cut your hair first
I remember hacksmith at 2.8 million subscribers, Watching with my dad and my siblings. nostalgia really hit me...
And you just destroy the diamond play button this is always my dream to get the diamond play button
I for one LOVE the fact that you have a team. Most youtubers are one/two/three men shows (mostly editors), but Hacksmith Industries is able to push really far and have more diverse and intricate projects.   Love it, can't wait to see what new talent is brought on and what HI can do for the world.
when you going to shave?
We all miss Nate he is loved
A living legend <3
Just wanted to say that, and I think I'm speaking for the majority here, that we love and appreciate all the work you do. Genuinely just astounding and incredible work you guys put out all the time and it's really appreciated by the people that do truly care about the channel and what you're all about. You deserve all the love and support in the world. Keep going strong team.
You are the real life tony stark
Hearing the emotion in his voice makes me love this channel so much more, and l am proud to be a fellow Engineer.
99% positive comments 1% negative comments still equal 100% success, you got this, you’ve done what was right for yourself and your business
Im glad i didnt skip ahead. Great video💖
Your beard like Tony + Thor 😂😚 xD
The middle is an example of what your lungs are after smoking. Don't smoke guys.
The hacksmith: destroys diamond play button with a lightsaber   YouTube: am i a joke to you
honestly i think a lightsaber used diamond playbutton is more valuable than a normal one
Yt first reaction: Ungrateful 😡 My reaction: Oh hey it looks better now
it's just a flame thrower with extra steps
Do a swift swing against something like paper
Hear this even if they complain know that there is more of us who don't complain
The hack smith started my love for wielding and started training this year
DONT TELL ME THAT THEY ACTUALLY DID THIS
This man just crushed a lemon
that is really from the heart it made me cry and congrats for 10 million sudscriders.
tell youtube that it broke out of no where and ask for a new one
12:48 you sound like a battle droid
YouTube: here’s diamond play button  Most you-tubers : wow im gonna put this on my wall hack smith: let cut it in half
14:26 and 14:30. The Diamond Play Button looks really cool like this.
Dude he sounds like he what’s to cry 😭
You inspire me!
maybe you could make a sword with the youtube button
now im not so sure if all the diamond play buttons youtube made are even real
that burnt play button looked real cool though ngl
Beautiful symbolism.
Power of friendship is amazing
Now your play button has some character
this was gold  or rather, diamond.....
Im not crying you are. :( GOOD JOD :)
I love the colour 🌈of the play button after burning 🔥🔥
We think you are awesome and the people who don't and criticize don't know crap. Thanks for the awesome content.
youtube will be mad for sure
Do u even read comments on old video??? 3:00
I subscribed your channel when your almost 1 million subscribers
I know that you do wanna try out your projects in hard substances but why did you do it with the poor play button when you knwo that it would just get ruined
Mental
I mean cool but now you don’t have the play button which kinda stinks
you know this man cares about his job if he doesn't even care about an award that less than 0.001% of the population gets
2013: The Hacksmith 2020: Hacksmith Industries 2028: Hacksmith Incorporated
It would be epic to see a duel of the first protosaber prototype and the new plasma one or a duel of plasma lightsabers
so many ambitions, confidence is always the way to go, by the way Love Elon and that play button is slick.
10:33 fresh frozen lol
Ok if somebody without the best equipment like the best scienctests in the world do I’m pretty sure they could have made a lightsaber
Can u make a actual iron man glove that fr shoots a blast I thought the laser one u made was a amazing u made my child hood dream come true but if u can make a blast from the movies like a beam that would be awesome thank you for everything
Dont make a terminator lol your the number 1 youtuber in my world and
12:00
1% negative comments.  Bugger that.  You're doing great work, inspiring (if no one else) me to do my thing - not Youtube, I'm not as pretty.  Keep up the good work.  I love watching the projects come to life!
You guys are great and I love this channel I hope you reach all your goals
hey why did you rick rolled me
Just why
Diamond is the most beautiful material
Crazy ultrasonic sword idea: is it possible for a blade to vibrate at ultrasonic speed? Can you build? I'm from Brazil I love your videos
Do u guys think that this is possibly the limit of ur guy's lightsaber experiment, or do u think  u can go further with it, giving it the closer performance to what we see in the movies. I know It sounds pretty hard to do because, well, this is real life, and that's a movie, but it's worth a shot. Right
My mans had a Damascus Diamond Play button
I think it’s prettier now 😤
Make black manta make black manta make black manta make black manta black manta please please please
You should make black manta Aquaman‘s enemy
Next make my lightsaber or else..
I have been here since you had less than 1 million subscribers and i have almost watched your every video and i wanna work with you oneday.
ive benn a part of the channel for about 3 or 4 years allready
Should be called " Happycampersmith ".
these guys are the reason i started to like engineering
Hacksmith be carful with the things you make there are still bad people who will steal and use the things u make for bad deeds: also good job for working hard
Lightsaber vs unbreakable box
What if instead of propane/oxygen you use argon and make some huge plasma cutter?
The people that say you you don’t do it right or mess it up. They just say that because they want people to think there cool for making mean comments that make other people think that they are not good enough.
12:22
The real question is, can it stop a bullet?
I absolutely love this channel and is there any room for an actual blacksmith in Hacksmith Industries?
So It is made if beskar?
I will work for this company when I get out of the marine corpa
if u skipped ur poop but I enjoy watching if u need a break were are all happy to let u have one
Yall about to hit 11 million two weeks later lol
the fact that you see youtube a a steping stone IS awsome, and at the same time sacary xD, sound like you're on your wai to take over the world
Been here since he started working on making ironman real. And it's sad not seeing Grant anymore :(
Love cooking with hacksmith👌👍
Thank u so fuck u haters u want to make ur Negativity up to urself
Love your work and ideas, and I know one day you will achieve your goals. You inspired so many people
Why don’t you try and make iron mans repulsir using the same thing that the lightsaber is made of, just in smaller more powerful bursts. Would that even be possible? 😂
Hacksmith:This lightsaber destroys everything Me:No The Lightsaber cant destroy the Hacksmith   (p.s I love u guys!!!)
When you realise a quarter of his subs are now from us Star wars fans
Kid:(ask for a toy ) His dad:(brings a toy) Kid:it's not a toy that I was want  Kid:
Can you make a detective conan skateboard???
Waw
You and your team are an inspiration and very much needed in our world! Keep it up. People like you show just how much is possible when we come together for something better. Thank you guys for your work and content. I'm excited to follow your company's future endeavors!
Ooh no
You have been a part of my life for so long you inspire me so much I don’t think I would be this happy if I did not find your channel thank you and saw this late
This is so epic, just when you think hacksmith and the team have settled into a routine, they announce they are going to be doing something even more incredible. Truly an inspiration.
Use the play button to make a hacksmith sword!!
You all are amazing!
He is a straight-up inspiration
He works so hard if anyone deserves the play button it’s him  Congrats on 10 million!!
Sad
Ha now he has a rainbow diamond play button
At first I was thinking "why would you do that with something so valuable?" But then, when I saw it at the end, with all the beautiful colors, cut in half and mounted on the wall, I realized that y'all have made something unique that no one else could make. Congratulations on 10 million subscribers, best of luck into the future!
Been a fan Sence 1mill subs
To the Hacksmith Industries, I’ve been here since 2013 and just want to congratulate you. Love seeing you grow!
the end goal is to build lightsabers and take over the world right?

Fully satishfy to watching this ...  love form ind.
12:42 battle droid smith
Well... i think they also discovered the real life besar :/
The middle rack it is the top rack 😂
I love the ghost rider 😂😀
I love you hacksmith
You are incredible man, you conquer all obstacles attitude has inspired me to at least try to be an author, I may not be able to make a whole book I bet I could put out a killer selection of shorts.
I thought the diamond part of the play button would shoot a uni beam when the light saber got to it
The world needs “The Hacksmith“ ♥️
4:40 so, you are assembling an Avengers team?? :D
There’s your retirement plan, international cooking show 🔥🔥😹
Glad I stayed here after you told everyone to skip to 12:22, I can hear the sincerity in your voice and that this isn’t scripted. Amazing that you’ve come this far, definitely take a break when it’s due, and trust that your team will carry on this legacy even during your breaks. Hope to see you in a very big place in the future for your industry.
In 5 years, I'll be done with university, I'll try to work here by then
Make a custom play button  I'm not forcing you to do it I'd just like to see it and it would be pretty cool
Man if it wasn't for you I wouldn't be who I am today making progets so keep strong man👍

WHYYYYYYY you distroy the diamond playbutton😪😫😫😫☹🙁😤😟🤯😩😭😭😭😱😱😰😰😰🤕🤢🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
youtube should send lightsabers instead
I want to be just like u
There’s people who are just straight up miserable.... Some sit behind a keyboard and bitch just to bitch and others do it to vent, not making an excuse for them but for some reason it helps them. So, he can cut that 1% down to .5%.
RainBow PlayButton
„We don’t have 11 million subscribers YET.“
Will hacksmith
This is the way
you should melt the rest of the playbutton down and make it into an anvil. like your logo. you could even put the diamond part into it
I think he would look really good with ponytail
This guy makes me so happy, I've been here since he first started and now he 10mil subs, this channel has grown so much 😢
To all the haters if all your gonna do is come here and complain just don't watch it he works hard
Hey
Haters are the species who build up fire inside a successful person...
Oh my goshhh. I have watched all of your other lightsaber vids and it’s like a dream come true. I can’t wait to see what you guys do next!!!!!
Was it a real dimond..?
I love your inspiration and appreciate everything you have done for us and everyone else. Thank you
10 years later 10,000 degrees bluetooth smart lightsaber
Hi
You are the first youtubers I have seen that use your own curiosity about weather a diamond play button would survive or get destroyed by a 4000 degree streak of plasma energy. Hopefully YouTube does not get too ticked off at you for destroying a gift they gave you!
this is so good
This guy..... I salute him
Why are you want to cut that ? 😞 because i am a YouTuber  too (but I started in 6 months ago)
You guys are awesome keep up the good work
Please open your silver and gold play button
Your plan is just Awesome I love the way you inspire all of us to work on coolest stuff that no one will think
I really look at you as a hero in this world. Compassion, inspiring, innovative. You really step up your game when it comes to creating something inside a comic or a game and brought it to reality, you dare to create things that we could only imagine. All of your hard works are worth it, the time you spent working with all the people around you is worth it. Thanks to you, a whole team is assemble, working as their dream job and create amazing things. Keep up the work man, I can tell that you will go further than you can ever imagine years ago, best of luck on your journey man!
You should cut your hair
When he cuts the play button 12:40
Men before you retired(died) you will going to chance the entire world   How about chance your name stark I guess no its better what you have
Keep doing what your doing, and don't let the negitive comments get you down
That speech thou  Respecc 💪🏿✊🏽👏🏼👊🏼✨
I remember when youtube commented on a hacksmith video
Just glue it together and I will be a better 10 mill plaque
I’ve been here since 100 k it’s been a long time
i have a few people i look up to that inspire me, i always loved making things as far back as i can remember, i haven't done anything half as cool as what you guys do, im a tool technician who make cutting tools at big international company and i it good work for learning. what im trying to say is love you guys, makers in general Tested, Hacksmith, Alec Steel, Samurai Carpenter, you all make stunning work and i just want to say Thanks you so much for making free enjoyable content. making the future seem like today!
Do you know if Grant was a Christian? And are you
Great video I'm abput to get an application LMAO
I am big fan of you
I am from Pakistan your videoes are best
Dude really you are the best builder in the world
You know what you are best , you are really my inspiration ❤  So just don't pay attention to those f*** negative comments.
I too want to make change and will need guidance
12:22
15:06 that magma like glowing button look cool
I like how James has the motivational speaking skills of Captain America and the mind of Tony Stark. I also like how he inspires others and create job opportunities for people. I like how he thinks not only for himself but for others as well. I remember that few years back I used to watch his vid and be like "Dang, I wanna be like him" and now 2 years later I'm on my way to finish high school and study engineering. I do hope that he achieves his dreams and I do hope that he would not give up on his dreams! Thank you for inspiring me and I hope that whatever you make would continue to make bigger and bigger impact on our world!
Wots won nicola 2700
Are you crazy its your play button  People would kill to get that en you burn it
I request attack on Titan 3D maneuver gear !!! XD
i dare u to make a real life kamehameha from Goku Dragon Ball, ik its hard but ik u can make a way to do it :)
hats off to the table
牛逼啊卧槽
I am the 10.9 sub scriberrrrr
sooo... you just don't have a diamond play button anymore?
“Even Tony couldn’t live up to tony” speaking in the past tense, implying that something happened to tony. Wait
so this is why diamond armors so strong
That's crazy to se where you at now in youtube
I‘ve not been here since 50k, not 1 million, not even 10 million, but I know how good this channel was and will be, I already love it. (Also I really liked the cooking show^^)
The Team Is Where It's At! Having a group of talented people not only lets HS Industries do far more than it ever could with just James, it gives us a cast of characters to laugh with and learn to love. I for one am thrilled every time the spotlight shines on someone other than the big man himself (I do love you though!) and we get to see their quirks, their skills.  Keep up all the amazing work guys. Also, more 1 day builds please! Much love - TPC
you go dude  just so I'm a new sub and I don't regret
For the history and future of hacksmith industries, it's very inspiring and I know it's difficult to do all of this but from the support from fans, your team working together, and the effort you put into your channel, I know that  hacksmith industries will grow.
10milyon butonu ilk bölen insan adamsin sen man
I had to skip so much to get to the action
No words amazing
0.23 to 10.12 min speech was actually worthy  of diamond .Oh come on, your words are diamonds with our diamond play 'button' . but if mankind was on 99 percent depended on robots then humanity would become end with its creation controlling onboard the earth. but 25 percent is good as it would create a modern yet humanily  world . if the one controlling the countries shall give to emerge into one then peace would become peaceful life of a person. But we are the gods of what we think and create and build and "create or destroy". at last we would the one to share future to the future to our childrens and humanity .
Don't let your dreams be dreams! We believe in you.
I want your light saber
"There was an idea"
im so sad that i had a chance to meet u at bright event in the Netherlands and that I missed u but I am happy to see u make cool things
U dont wanna be tony stark becouse he died but u wanna Invent immortality
Love from India . Please reply me.
You Guys are great and inspiring and I only stumbled across you maybe a month ago and was blown away about everything you have built. I’m not an engineer but regardless your inspiring
Nostalgia..........
You guys are incredible and that is incredibly powerful
*The molten play button*
Anyone knows the name of the exact song that is played while they cut the button?
I can’t wait to see how much you guys change the world. That’s an amazing plan
Yeah I was sad in the beginning
Love you ,you made me cry
Heart Touching Video.
Why will you do that to your trophy. 😭
Un Poco De Todo
Hacksmith “reaches ten millions subscribers”  Diamond play button “my time has come”
I bet they can build a deathstar if ELON helped
Youtube: why did we give him diamond play button  Hacksmith: *cuts diamond play button in half
Make a thing that acts like the force
What if Hack-smith Industries made a plasm dark saber.
Thank you for being only entertainment in quarantine.
I wish I was old enough to work for you man, that would be a dream job
Can we appreciate how much this man would do for content.
you do great
Nice Light Saber Bro Love Your Video!
How this channel is only at 10 mil surprises me. Like wow. The tech he’s made could be considered groundbreaking like everyone who isn’t subbed, get it sorted
😀😃💯💖💝💕💞
Is it only me or does he looks like dartvader
you guys inspire me to burn more things for science
Hi I hope u finish ur dream and achieve everything u talked about in the video. From a 4year old fan

Hacksmith looks like Obi wan after 10 years of revenge of sith
14:21 leaving it like that would’ve been the coolest play button I’ve seen
That’s a strong *ss play button
:you tube after watching this b like :i amnever gonna give a man with a beard and A fire extinguisher any more play buttons
Imagine him bringing his all inventions in science fair

Came to watch an award being cut in half... stayed for the uplifting heart to heart

Sayang banget itu diamond playbutton
We are proud of you .dont let anything stop you evear
Your journey is very inspiring and touching. I myself try to replicate your small stuff which I can make. And I want to do an internship at Hacksmith industries.
You nide to make fresh princ od bel air intro
14:19  10million play button  to 100million button
YOU KNOW, THIS CHAT COULD TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING, I MEAN EVERYTHING, SO BE CEARFUL OF (HOW) YOU SHOULD MAKE YOU VIDEOS BRIGHT OK!!!
YOU HAVE SPENT MOST OF THIS VIDEO ON TALKING!?!?!? I EXPECT MORE FROM YOU, LIKE SPENDING MOST OF YOUR VIDEO ON THE LIGHTSABER, NOT TALKING!!! DO YOU KNOW WHY YT VIDEOS ARE MADE??? >:(
MASTER PLAN
i love your videos ignore the haters
If they hating as them to create a real life robot or lightsaber why the hating
Make play button please
I don’t get how 4 k people could watch this video and dislike it .
Hey man that was some pretty deep stuff put know that I'm am not one of those people. the stuff you do is different then any other YouTube channel I've seen. I bet that will stay that way for a long time
The people that complain the most think they are smart as hell, when in reality are dumb af
Wow the AMBITION you and the HACKSMITH family you made and the future of the company is very ambitious i cant wait to see this dream in the future so I can look back at it!!! I love the content thank you!!!
Blue diamond play button looks mad
I’m sorry but the beard is too distracting  Stop being so beautiful
Hey little fan request u should make the scooter 🛵 from the lorax also I would want it
Hey I think u should make the scooter 🛵 from lorax
This video is supported by the guy that suggested this in the other video
LETS GO I'M THE 21,897TH COMMENT
If any one hates on this video for james talking for to long he literly told us a time stamp to skip to
Thank you for all you do hacksmith industries really looking to get into engineering and building things for the future but I currently don't know what to do or where to go and am feeling lost in what to do next and really wish I knew what to do next ... Love your content it's an absolute insperation
NUFF RESPECT 2U...I'VE BEEN A SUBSCRIBED FOR 3 YEAR'S. I LOVE WATCHING THE PASSION YOU LOT HAVE...IT'S VERY HEART WARMING.  1 NEGATIVE COMMENT CAN DESTROY 100 POSITIVE COMMENT'S...IT'S HURT'S DEEP.  FUCK THE HATER'S & COMPLAINER'S.
Who else cried?
Better hope they send a replacement one
Ahh honestly you're such an inspiration for me and I'm assuming many other people. The stuff your team is making is like exactly what makes engineering (and maybe even science) interesting. I am glad that a channel like this exists and that we get to experience projects in which you have such a wide degree of freedom. And yeah, obviously some people will say that you're not working hard but just living off money from YouTube. Maybe they just can't appreciate that actually fun, engineering oriented channels exist on this platform. You know what else is put up on yt?  Well you probably know if you have at least some experience with surfing the internet. *Spoiler* it's not quantum physics...   (At least not in the largest quantities)  Keep up the great work and dont let yourself be distracted by those who come here just to express their opinion, and dont actually care about the projects themselves. they're always gonna be there and it's just about finding a way to get on with it:)
forge a  sword from the heart of a dieing playbutton
This is the biggest sacrifice in YouTube history
your the best youtuber love your conten
ARUAN 2
I wonder if you could make the emitter thinner in diameter, producing a thinner blade, which my increase the length, conserve fuel and potentially make the blade more powerful. Amazing work!
Nooooo
Yo if you need another engineer hit up Mark Rober
When YouTube watching this .  They : That's insane . We get 3 months to build that diamond play button  hacksmith : I cut that play button with my 1 day build light saber
SUBSCRIBE TO PEWDIEPIE

Ty stwórz prawdziwą różdżkę z Harrego Pottera, chyba to potrafisz wkońcu zrobiłeś miecz świetlny   You create real wand on Harry Potter , you make lightsaber,  I think you can do it, you made a lightsaber
I used to watch years ago and after time I stoped watching. That was one of my worst mistakes. But, now I am back and am inspired to do more creative and fun things. Thank you.
jesus that was a long intro, it took an actual 10 minutes to get to the video
Make another one for a 1v1
Lightsaber‼️  So much YES‼️‼️
Who is here after neon man video
The sun is hot, but the lightsaber is hotter

We always liked your channel, but what you shared has made us LOVE you and your mission!!!
Can you make hulk buster
Hacksmith: I've won but at what cost
he cut the play button coz he is confident that he get another and the way he is doing it i am sure he will
12:23
Just a question what project would you change if you had access to 0 point energy
Dont y u saying ur not the real life Tony stark lol cuz u r if u creating all these real life super powers, u and ur team r genius's and keep it up
Why
It turns into a T-1000 🤣
I wanna see you guys make yondu’s arrow
Well done and well said! I hope I can com'è visit in my road trip to Canada. Would be a dream. Keep up the good work!
Hacksmith makes the coolest things. Still waiting for those web shooters lol
If anything, you just made it cooler
Gj man, I've been here since 20k
Hey umm Mr. Hobson So I've been watching the mandolorian and I noticed how they all have a vibro-knife a vibrating knife so I was wondering if you could make one?
Most youtubers: I'm so proud to have this award The Hacksmith: Cuts it in half
Dude, love your channel. It’s so inspiring to see what one individual can do. Above all though, I love your humility. Your growth is inspiring and I can’t wait to see where you’ll go in the future. You may not be Tony, but you’re yourself which is even better. 🤘
Still cant believe they built an actual protosaber
I really love your videos, you really inspired me to see what career I want to study, I love technology and seeing how my dreams inventions become real, it make me thing what I can do for accomplishing my dreams, you are a great industry and I hope you become better every day, you are part of the people that also inspired to make a channel, not for the fame, but to entertain others with what I do, thanks Hacksmith ;)
12:22
Could you try to make the darksaber from Star Wars Mandalorian (Rebels, Clone Wars)
We love you hacksmith
Well said friend. You and your team are equally valuable and I hope your master plan comes to fruition!   The next step might even happen on Mars if Elon stumbles onto your videos. Either way even if your feet are planted on the ground or you're boosting people's careers toward doing what they love.   Keep those beautiful minds thinking toward the future and no amount of negative comments could compare to the achievements you've made, the minds you'll influence and the achievements you will make.

Hack smith industries truly inspires. No doubt about it
I wish this wasn't always scripted. Seems unnecessary. No big deal but try to ditch it.
The future of hacksmith be like:  we build a functional death star!  Edit: meaby its possible xd
I LOVE your channel.  But everybody has room for improvement.  Could you say "Humankind" instead of "Mankind?"  It would make me even happier.   Also, hire some women engineers.  Everyone should make women and men feel equal.
Ehh not a lightsaber yet. Just a hot 2-inch beam of light that can’t interact with another of its kind.
Oh my god
Nice song parody
YouTube: send diamond play button Hacksmisth: cut it in half YouTube: am i a joke to you?
i have a negative comment for you  That bush on your face
Thanks, for being you James. I love what you do.
That first part hit hard and I am not gonna lie I almost cried(I cried)

We love you bro
Weird flex but ok 😂
Its kinda cool tho  But cutting a DIAMOND play button in half is complete nonsense😂😂but still ur vids are great and best of luck for your future projects
Way better
The Chinese kids who made that: 😐
Can you tell me which Indian experiment Youtube channel crossed 10 million subscribers recently????
You are an inspiration for us. We are a team of school students who are on yt channel . My vision is to create the real superheros. Best luck bro.

WHY WOULD YOU DESTROY THAT
Where do you suggest going to college if we wanted to work for you?
I think when you get the ruby play button YouTube is gonna make it invincible or something
good job
i almost cried while watching this
When they actually started cutting the 10m play button I was like 😮
I just need to to say who has the audacity to dislike videos like this thees hole some  type vids who ever dislikes vids  like this deserve to go to hell
Seriously, the muscles are just unreal😂
Thank you for everything you and your team does keep up the great work and keep shing bright like the star you are
Hey hacksmith industry's I know that Alex lab already made the electro whips but I watch alot of inventing channels and I like to see lots of different versions, I can tell that this is a team of great minds and I want to see what your best version is you guys don't have to do it if you don't want to but it would make me happy if you did.
You are the best you make me want to build everything that lol build
Hello
Maybe you could cast the play button into a hack smith logo that you hang on your wall
Sir ,I vouch you for President of the U.S
I know this question might sound stupid to some people but why hasn’t the government asked for there technology
Hey man my brother shipped a package to you and he’s a huge fan and his friend took a photo with one you your guys

Rest in peace Grant😔I miss him

You are amazing 👏 you deserve this man

I have been watching ur vids for over 3 yrs ,I love ur vids
This video actually made me tear up.
I love your pep talk😌😌
Here in the world there are people that dont like any thing but if we say to them to build a lightsaber or cap sheild or exo skeletion  they will not do it.  Hacksmith i love your every projects so we are with you

I 💎💎🔪🔪🏢
His vocal expressions are a lot like Toby's from The Office
One day this video make a one of most popular video on his channel 👍
How can I become a mechanical engineer like you how can I start learning as a kid
How long are you planning on doing this for
Try to make a  giant 3d printer and make a big sword.
The trade federation should make their blast doors out of diamond play buttons, damn.
Got really happy when he mentioned sweden don't know wy
How much oxygen and acetylene did you use?
Build idea: The Mandalorian’s rifle
Who else like me didn't skip the time line
Bro I remember when I first encountered your channel around the time of the exoskeleton series . Man those were the days 🥺 I’m extremely speechless at how far you’ve come man, you’re a huge inspiration to me . I don’t want to be an engineer, I’m simply just not passionate for that. My dream is to join faze clan and become successful from what I love doing and that is of course making videos for entertainment. Seeing all the success you’ve achieved has inspired so much . Easily one of MY BIGGEST inspirations.  You’re a legend bro! 🐐
What is the diamond play button made of? I was expecting it to be a lot easier for the lightsaber to melt through it
I am your biggest fan from India
Woooooooooooooow your light sabers is75% this is very cool I hope you can make 100% real in the future
Salak
bro u r my inspiration, bro don't look on to the bad comment u r good at every thing and the team All the best for u r big plan I hope it will make a turning revaluation in the world  ALL THE BEST FOR HACKSMITH INDUSTRIES
😨😨😨 wat
Can you please make wakanda shield vs light staber
Definitely teared up with the nostalgia. I've been watching for years (at least 2015 or 16 I think, maybe earlier). It's amazing how much you have grown! I haven't seen every video, but have been trying to go back and catch the ones I've missed (life gets busy, even now I'm in nursing school and barely get time to watch anything). Thanks for doing what you do in inspiring others and pushing the limits.
Your my biggest  idol
*accident
the hacksmith making ironmans reactor on axcident
Youre the best keep up the good work
you are the best
Who is here after neon man news
Is that captain America
12:22
y did u break it??!!
I enjoyed you cutting the play button but really i liked the vid more because of the vision you shared. It's admirable to hear what plans you have and why.
That was one good dash of lemon...
How did him make a robot?
12:22
Congrats i doubt youtube was expecting people to want to MELT there playbutton
In 10 years when I'm 24 I want to see where all of this goes
People only make negative comments in Hope's your react to them.
You changed the world by doing impossible
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo diamond boton nooo :(
melt down the play button and make it a sword and put the play button as the bottom of the handle
It looks like Tony Starks triangle heart peace
U made a flipping lite Saber u guys kud make a partnership with Disney maby I am not good in bisnes
You guys make engineering fun and inspired me to pursue it I don’t I ever seen a channel that made amazing things like this you guys are amazing
OMG that look so cool
YouTube watching this video after giving you a diamond play button 👁👄👁
Why
I think hack smith is one of the only you tubers to destroy a diamond play button
This is the best channel on YouTube I am a long time fan
ok this is so wholesome how he doesn't want to just make sufficient money off youtube then go retire to some island, he actually cares about our community. he has also inspired me and many others to believe that anything is possible because, growing up, the thought of a working, retractable, custom, plasma, steampunk lightsaber was simply impossible, but this human has made it a reality. he will go down in history.
Your so inspirational and you deserve more than just subscribers
How many of u are watching his videos without Subscribing
You inspire me to be in engineering and not crying to sleep
I'm might be just a boy looking up to the stars but I would take part in a crampus wos head is someone whit such a great mind
Dedicated to all of those who insult the hacksmith: FUCK YOU I mean it, mess with him, mess with me
Who came here to see who skipped to @12:22
Happy :)
I'm glad that i watched this fully...  I was following you for a long time...aa looong time.. honestly i was thinking my self for a while  about the negatives that you mention..but now i know what's the problem. I thought you are another YOUTUBER..But i was wrong😅 ...all the best for the plans you got..i underestimated you...
Hacksmith = Grant Thomson 2.0
Its also a almost a population of Czech Republic.
Am i the only one having soooooo much respect for him.
You can buy a new diamond play button if you contact YouTube i figured i should tell you just in case you wanted a non broken one since you cut this one in half
Aruã, is you?
but why  if team youtube is watching this video please give him a new one it's my humble request
Imagine if every 7 billion people become as intelligent as the hacksmith. We would find cure for all disease and other problems in a couple of months
The people who skipped to the climax didn't actually see the climax because the climax was cooking with the hacksmith
I know I haven’t been here since the beginning but I’ve been watching for around 4 years and I love this channel and I love watching it grow.
I know it's out of the ordinary, but how about you make the aluminium-infused Profesor Chaos armor from South Park.
I bet if u talk with Elon Musk, he would invest on your guys...
who is  from jacksucksatlife ?
I was around since 1k subs I’m og
Thanks a lot I will  keep make things you have change my life
Thats honnestly my dream having a real life stark industries
i love you buddy keep on going  you inspired me to start science experiments
hacksmith: I've always wanted to host a cooking show  Me: Oh god I'm scared
Just...wow
I wonder if ,he thinks about climate change
Ermm...You Can Get Banned From Youtube Because You Just Melted A Diamond Play Button youtube send it to you
this lightsaber cuts through vibranium and steel doors but not a youtube play button
Man, some of these people don't have anything else in their life to do but complain. You built a whole company. No matter how far you get hatters are always here.
Come for a lightsaber, leave in tears. Thanks for being Nostalgic about Grant, James, we shouldn't ever forget his ray of sunshine. Yours either.
You are so talented
No i world tale so
You spend your whole life to get this and when you got it you just destroy it
☕🦆 ¿Coffee?
Maximus don’t listen to those people you rock and your inventions rock
Hey I love your video love from india🇮🇳
Amazing work my friend!
James truly is a great man 👍🏻👍🏻
I think that we won't be needing any heroes in the future, if just more people were like you guys. Stay focused on your master plan, because it really sounds like one hell of a good idea. It's always good to know that there are still people out there somewhere who actually care for the bigger picture and not just for the money or fun.  Cheers from Germany and stay safe.
"2 ours later" To citate the spongebob narator..
thanks for the insperation
Well I guess a new Diamond Play Button only stays fresh for about a week lol
when... did grant die???
That's a nice goal for your life I'm sure you will be succeed and your name will be every where I'm waiting for that day...:)
I love hacksmith.. ❤️ ❤️  The best channel
Keep up Hacksmith Industries 😘🥰🥰😘🥰
was that a real play button
An u guys do dry ice vs light saber
His right arm is on steroids.
I love that it took longer to put a hole in the play button then it did breaking into a safe
Your the best man
Who came from neon man. 👇
14:22 deep inside I want them to keep the colour that way it looks awesome
Ah yes we finally got our trophy for 8 years of work...lets cut it with a lightsaber
YouTube is crying when they send you that
Why tho
So you're basically building the Avengers base now. I'm so excited to see your company grow and I can't wait to buy those self-lacing shoes!
Soy el único español ????
I saw jack milking this from a mile away!
seeing this hurt a lot, congratulations hacksmith for the 10M!!!
Beautiful, i am following you from last 3yrs 😊 I seen every video and at age of 40+ you give me motivation for do something different from regular life... thanks Buddy ❤️❤️❤️
Only the people Who Came From JacksEpicYoutubeChannelFullOfFunTimesHiRickX Are Worthy Of Liking This Comment😃
Can you guys re-make the Kylo Ren lightsaber but with this design and concept? But it's not like i'm forcing you guys to make it.
the dislikes are exclusively people who work for youtube.
Don,t talk
Subscribe to my channel electro Playing World
Who are from india
Who needs Tony Stark we have hacksmith industry's
I'm new but I didnt go to 12:22 at the beginning cause this is cool (also if you want to take a break you can)
It was cooler
Can you trim your hair and beard
You do so much of hard work
Yo when I become old enough imma try to get into Hacksmith team
We all love your videos and hope you keep making new one love your subscribers
I'm so late I know but I just want to out this here for the odd chance that someone gets to it, your content really shouldn't have to produce 1 video a week you have the most enjoyable and entertaining content I've ever come across, I've been following your evolution since 2016, I've seen your great improvement, and changes to the world already and I don't understand why certain people think they are the all powerful and say that you did it wrong, you do your best and push it to be better, do what you need to do to be happy and successful, don't make yourself feel like you have to always have a deadline, you put way to much stress on you and your team, I see that you all enjoy it but over time it will take a toll and you all will stop enjoying what you do, love you and your whole team, a loving fan, deadbot
Lots of diss about cutting The Button in half, but I actually think YT would recognise and love this as genius.  I heard the genuine emotion in your voice and couldn't help but feel it too. I've been following your channel for quite some time now and can't help but be inspired. If ever you want to start something up over my way, then you have one budding Hacksmith UK cell right here.  Alanicus. Oxfordshire, UK.
This man outdid pewdiepie with the works first proto-saber
You guys should really consider making a double-sided lightsaber. Not just because it's cool but it might give you just enough room to make a full lightsaber and not a proto-saber. It would probably only burn for a minute or less but hey, proof of concept. Congrats on 10 mil!
14:16 imagin if he stopped there and just kept it like that
It would be amazing to have a video where James and Adam Savage make a costume for comic conventions
Best of luck with your master-plan.
I remember when I first watched this guy modifying an affordable Honda Civic. From humble beginnings. 🔥💪
2:22
Keep up the good videos
Congrats for 10 million subscribers
Love you guys so much 😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰             🐖💨   🌪
You inspire me everyday. It’s because of you I want to be a engineer. I wish I could work for you. But even if that may not come true, I’ll keep fighting for my goal. Your story will go down in history. Thank you James.
Hi I’m a 12 year old your channel has been such an inspiration to me and I want you to know that and I want to be a mechanical engineer when I grow up I’ve already started some research thank you 👍
I really enjoy your videos! Keep it up! You can do it!!
But why, why would you do that?
Why
I somehow felt hungry while watching a diamond play button being seasoned lmao
What metal is the Dimon play button made out of?
Your the best I watch you all the time and forget about the haters there just jealous
They should've stopped when the play button turned blue so they could have an actual blue diamond playbutton
12:22
love you bro
Its amazing to see how far he's truly come, been watching him for years and is still the #1 you tube channel
12:22
Couldve sold it an fed Africa
Haters: complain on videos   Hack smith: Let’s cut out 10 mil sub play button  YouTube:  Okay then
He going to start a school I'm going to be the first student
This is amazing
The ultimate collab, The Hacksmith and Mr. Beast  “...” -society intensifies-
I think it's really cool that he reads as many comments as he can. Nice job connecting with your community!
The diamond play button will look awesome in that blue and reddish colour
Its funny how he says that regularly getting set on fire is a good thing
Your videos are littt, i swear Btw, i started you watching you when yo made that super dope mini sized cyber truck, and than i subbed to you when  you turned it into a tank. That was AWSOME
I am from Russia and despite this you are my favorite youtuber.  I dream of someday becoming the same as you
He Made from diamond damascus he is a real gamer lol

10:13 Hacksmith and The Food Theorist Collab?
You are in inspiration, but don't carry that as a burden, carry it with pride. I absolutely believe in you. Grant inspired me too, when I heard about his death I almost cried. Do what makes you happy, there is only so much time on this Earth. I want to learn engineering and make the world a better place. To better humanity!
I’ve been a subscriber since the original exoskeleton
I need to say this: this is awesome
Make a 4 way treadmill
I’ve been here since last year
You have inspired me to take a nap now I’m joking you have actually inspired me to take up coding
💪🏽👏🏽 👈🏽All i can say
Hey! where's the lamb sauce?
Thanks Hacksmith, you helped a lot in my kitchen.
Welp that’s 10 mil subs gone

Your video of you wearing jets strapped to your arms and wearing a flying suit, flying over a lake has obviously made a difference because here in the UK tests were conducted in Scotland using either technology you created or reverse engineered technology, to aid the emergency services to be able to get to people stranded on hillsides, and the conclusion was that instead of taking over an hour to reach the target by walking, by using jets on the arms took less than 10 minutes to get to the person that needed medical assistance.
Omg I can remember you you made the sledge hammer. Oh men I cried when I saw it was you. That was 2 years ago time flies past us and we don’t Even expect things to happen so fast
Why

You don't even know how much I would like to work for Hacksmith Industries, but I'm only 15 years old and I still live in Europe so .... Probably when I grow up and be able to achieve it, you James and your team will work on a workin Death Star  or conquer other dimensions. I admire your work and you inspire me a lot. Thank you
Omg I loved the cooking with The Hacksmith, it was so epic
I need to say you dont want to take a break you wanna punch the planet with an iron man gauntlet but in a good way you wanna make something like spongebob but for amazing inventions i support that keep up the great work and please dont stop until Hacksmith Industries is like apple or google dont stop  and youll be the most well known person in the world i mean you and your team built a lightsaber a plasma based 1970 smoke looking lighsaber

I've only tuned in to your teams videos a few times but as a recent mechanical technologist I appreciate everything you do. I think it's very important to push the boundaries of what we perceive we can do and I think your channel helps achieve that. keep up the good work guys!
They could make a portal gun from portal 2
This makes my soul happy
Keep being yourself man and work to your goal

Thank you, you have inspired me. Trust what I go through every day is most times are hard, tiresome  so bloody tiresome. If not for my wife I would have gave up yrs ago. Watching you, how your mind works, how beautiful it is and the people around you brings me a light in a world that seems so dark.
You probably know that CTV was talking about your lightsaber. Congrats guys

Fan since the beginning
Let's hope YouTube sends you a ruby button when you reach 50 million so you can cut it too.

Everyone stop complaining , do something with your life and try to make better things if you think he could do "better" before saying something like that you try something hard
I like your channel please shave otherwise you are handsome
I’ve been here since the cod exoskeleton and tbh yes there was a point that this channel hit the dirt, but this channel has got me through some seriously bad times, when I found out I actually had depression and a medical problem with anxiety because of my ADHD, but here is like home this YouTube channel is where I live in my heart I’ve fantasied about becoming a member of the actual team working on things with James, Bogdan, Ean, Dan, and everyone else. It’s a family here, and the channel isn’t what matters it’s Hacksmith industry’s, if they made a video app for my phone I would download it, if they made their own internet kind of think where creators can share their own creations with everyone and with Hacksmith industry’s, I’m so glad that I’ve been here since the beginning, I’m so glad that I got to see this channel grow like James’s beard, I’m so glad that I have the know how that I already had even as a little kid I know things a college student is learning and I’m 16 I can’t do anything on paper but in practice yes, I know I’m not going anywhere because I’m not getting any fancy degree, but I am happy with the life I am living and every Hacksmith video let’s me learn something new so I can look at my own possibilities for inventions and new tech, Thank you Hacksmith industry’s, thank you for just existing and being you, thank you you have helped so many like me as a side note if you have been able to agree with ANYTHING in this comment please leave a like and show your support.

Hi hacksmith
Hacksmith, I Appreciate every one of your videos, each one is entertaining, scientific, and perfectly brilliantly it’s own way!! No matter the upload schedule or project... you always make it real but most importantly, you make it great... thank you!!
The first part made me cry, who else?
You should make Ryuko Matoi scissor blade its just a request
where is the power loader update
You heated chrome and not everyone was wearing graded respiratory ppe... I suggest everyone look up what vapors they were just exposed to.
Pretty scary how a real lightsaber is 270,000,000 degrees.  It would’ve cut right through that like paper.
I’ve been here since 400,000 subs and it’s crazy that he’s at 10 mill now 😱😱good job 👍👍👍
yeah at leats its look cool for me
Omg I dint really expected he will really destroyed it 😰

Is it possible to create a magnet or something of the sort to pick up something like the lightsaber in order to mimic the force?

This channel inspired me pursue my mechanical engineering course back in 2016, and now I am one year away from getting my degree and another half more to get my license. Thank you for your ideas and projects, it gave me ideas that propelled my understanding of engineering which also helped in my college projects.
_"Ohh I forget to turn on the Recorder"_

Do you think you can make a portal gun that works?
You should make real steel bot
Melt the excess metal from the play button into rings fr your team with the hacksmith logo on it to remnd everyone that its a team effort to get that playbutton
Why you have done this. It is very expensive. And youtube community worked hard to make this for you. Not for to destroy it. It is for your success
Nobody: ...  Literally nobody: ...  Hacksmith: *Casually cooks all of Sweden*
Shave man
But what would happen if 2 lightsabers hit each other they would go through each other like gas or bounce off
who is after neonman??
O keep in mind don't sell wepons like tony...
Dang how often do you hit  the gym?
❤️
is there anyway we could get the dimensions of the Play button so I can make a 3D Model stand for it. Thank you and you keep doing you
Am I the only one to catch the avengers quote
I always pray for YouTubers like you.
I've been watching you for like 2 years now and i love what you do i hope one day that i can build things like you i'm only 11 years old (almost 12) but i hop one day i can do things like this. Thank you for inspiring people and keep doing what your doing. :)
@ 14:13 the playbutton looks so cool
You look like jesus
I love how Youtubers destroy their play buttons to spit on Youtube's face.
I have a question is it possible to make a double sided lightsaber just like Darth Maul's
Youtube: ... WTF BRO
Listen to my song
Imagine if he made a chidori😂🥶
Hello Jeff Bezos? Yeah this man can change the world. He is worthy of funding.

Diamond Play Button | Case Hardened
Why did I watch the cooking show
Can you find a way to make the lighsaber longer
When this company goes public I’m investing straight away. I love ur plane and I think u have a lot of potential!!!!!!
I only just started watching this channel but y'all should attempt achieving cold fusion because all this other stuff has been groundbreaking why not shoot for the stars
You've mad almost 1 mill in less than a week
Some day this man is going to solve global warming and mass produced light sabers
I haven't been here since the start. But I've watched you since like a year or two back and I have to say it's really cool to see your YouTube account grow and get the recognition it deserves!  Congratulations for 10 million subscribers! Sincerely, a Swedish subscriber
who's from neon man's video??
Why would you do that
i thinks IM GOING TO CRY
ok... So ho is the real Tony Stark? Elon Musk or James?
Find a way to make it all smaller and put it on the lightsaber handle somewhere
In all seriousness Who dislikes a video like this WHO WHO!
This channel is dope and one of the most interesting channels on YouTube
You are insane! In the best way!  :)
I heard that purposely harming a Play button from youtube will blacklist you in their search algorithm.   Your youtube woulda have grown faster and bigger if you didn’t do this...
You should make the full body armor of Mando in The Mandalorian
What's inside a 10 million Playbutton
Hey bro I'm from Tamilnadu , India 🇮🇳, you are doing a great job, I am your subscriber since u have 1 million subscribers in youtube..,now it's more than 1 crore ,I love you and your teammates especially the tall guy so much...❤️❤️,you are rocking guys...
You it’s stupid! :-€
in 5 to 10 years he will be a multi millionaire ceo and every will know his name i can’t wait
I think this is realy cool but I’m a bit confused how do you not burn up when you activate the lightsaber. You would need it at a few thousand degrees. How do you protect yourself.
They kill a Mandalorian to make that button?
What happened to the spy car
Love from India

What is a diamond play button made of?
Almost started tearing up during my lunch break, Love all you guys over there very inspirational. Can’t wait to see what happens in the coming years.
Who is here after neon man
Diamond Play Button just became Sapphire Play Button. and then a Bismuth Play Button.
You inspired me a rlly long time ago to go to school for engineering, I’m in highschool now and still plan on going to college you’re videos have helped keep my Motivation up and work towards that goal I love what y’all are doing
I am from India and I love watching your videos
In 5 days he already got 0,9 mil subs plus 😳

I love how every you tuber has to do something to their playbutton

Very touching speech
He is a great man as he reads many comments   I knew because because  I saw the number of hearts he had given
thats hot
honestly in the middle it looked way cooler than before (or way hotter)
The whole video before 12:22 .... His voice was almost breaking up. He was emotional. Or atleast I think. AND THAT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS WHY JAMES has and always be a legend. 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 HATS OFF SIR!!!!!!! I wish you all the best for the future.
lightsaber v baby
Love❤️ From India🇮🇳

You can tell YouTube that someone plasma lightsabered your play button and get another one
You should make a badass knight armor that is really complex but more lightweight and mobile than most. Like so they can make it happen!!!!!
Who came from neon mam news
Show the top
Hey Hacksmith I have watched you for a long time and have enjoyed every single one of your builds from your batman grappling hook up to your new steampunk style light Saber and I was thinking that you can maybe try to make the Z-6 rotary cannon from star wars the clone wars that would fit your Star Wars builds well.
Oh wow really a nice video, indeed keep going, love your videos. You made it real
I heard about transparent aluminum or something..so is it possible to use that to make a cool light saber?
That’s amazing and you do you man your not tony stark or any other person you are you and it is better that way your channel is awesome and your a great role model forme
Well Done Sir
Yo hacksmith yo I should make Atom form real steel
You were welding it to the table XD
Make an irl transformer.
13:34            here is what you want
I'm a new fan of the channel (joined right around the 10,000,000 mark) and can already tell that you're a genuinely good man. You're going about things in the right & honest way, and are setting a great example for other YouTube creators as far as how to act (being humble, appreciative, and hard working), and making the world a better place as you go. Major respect to you & your team/family/work family! I'd love to see you & your channel start a Grant Program for inventors that are either new, old, young, well seasoned, or just have a great idea that could help people but they aren't serious inventors. That would be amazing! Who knows how much better this world could become if we all invest in ideas that are meant to make the world a better place and aren't solely "for profit" ideas. I'll chuck in some $'s for that any day! Thank you, all of you, for making high quality, amazing content that wows us every time & teaches us a few things along the way. Take care, & keep up the great work!
What the hell you has been done here bro,  it's feel like  our world is different from studio
Neon man❤️

I can't believe you just wasting cutting the play button god!!
You know, I hope when this channel hits 100M subscribers YouTube will send a titanium play button with those cool colors and a orange YT logo just like you guys did with that awesome lightsaber of you guys! I am not really a Star Wars fan but I like the idea behind a lightsaber! Making dreams come true!

Next he needs to make it solid so you can duel.
You should just instead of making things from movies make stuff that you imaging
Hello there! I want to make a request, Can you build the Hidden Blade from the Assassin's Creed games? I'm sure it would be awesome considering you LITERALLY built a real plasma light saber! I'm sure the Hidden Blade will be easy for you considering you and your team have that much talent.
3.7k people dislike something they don’t even know how to create
Enjoy my video 👇👇
You are best and very hardworking content creater I have ever seen👍👍 The hard work you put in making stuff is way more compared to what we see in the 10 minutes video👍👍 Best of luck and love from India

I trust that you always read your comments, and I have been subscribed since 2012, and I want to congratulate you. Not just you though. All of you.

James would definitely be called to Tomorrowland
This man, Is the future of the world. He created things which NO ONE can create. And the movies people make, He gadgets could be cool and you will wish to be real. And Hacksmith makes your dream come true.

Mr beast should give you some money for more upgrades
Who is here after neon man 😀
You are awesome
Will you get a new play button
Hey there, I am really impressed by what you have accomplished so far and something you said caught my attention, I'm paraphrasing but basically you would like to make inventions to help people, such as exoskeletons and the like. I am a burn survivor, not a victim. But at age 16, due to a horrific car accident, I was burned very badly from head to toe. Before the accident, I was like you. I loved to build things, make inventions and work with my hands... The fire took all that away from me. As such, I don't have any fingers in my left hand and the right hand is useless. It would be great if you were able to make some sort of robotic hand that would go over the hand with no fingers because the Drs won't amputate the hand off because even though I don't have fingers, just nubs. I have part of my thumb left which gives me about an inch of space in which to grab stuff. The science & tech is not there yet to make a "Luke Skywalker" type hand, that is as functional as a real one. So, I am wondering if you and your team would be capable of making something that goes over my hand & can give me something that would allow me to throw a football or catch a ball or simply to wave at someone. You can look me up on FB, I'm the one with the scars 😉. Anyway, I wish you all the best and it seems like you're well on your way to making your plans into reality!
I have been here for 2 years

Dude you guys are seriously the best. I love how you inspire so many people around the world and continue to produce spectacular content all the time. You deserve every single bit of success, all the subscribers, all the views and everything else. Also tell the editors they're doing an amazing job as you can really see how much time and effort went into producing the vids and the editors often go unnoticed! I really wish I could get a Hacksmith Internship as I would love to learn and expand my knowledge whilst sharing it with like-minded people. Keep up the great work as always and I'm super excited for what the future of the channel holds
Whynot build Greenhouses that feed billions of people for free?
Make a non cannon spear version so you don’t have to make a backpack
Great work man
Hello The Hacksmith. I have an idea for a video I’d like to see you do. You should make a real mandalorian helmet! Keep up the awesome videos.
He almost sounds like a droid with the mask on lol
Do an experiment to see how long it'll take this saber to cut through flesh. Use a ballistic gel dummy, or a pig corpse.

TIP: stop reading comments
I am the new Justin y Last time I saw I don’t remember him doing the speech

I’ve been watching this channel for 4 years and it’s honestly amazing. Every video amazes me with your creativity and ingenuity. Thank you so much for all the happiness you have given me and I wish you all luck for the future -C
This is such a amazing video hacksmith you have really inspired me to think more about the world you are such a great dude don't let anyone break you down trust me take it from a guy who had a few bullies and just want to say (personally your iron man series was awesome!) Just keep moving forward I've been here since the beginning and I'm not going anywhere
Wish YouTube would have recommended this channel sooner instead of just popping up for the lightsaber
Remember when he was making Wolverine claws in a garage. Its so cool to see how far someone can come. Thank u so much for the hard work u and  your team put into making all of our dreams into realities! Lightsabers, so cool!
you are the best keep it up
make the iron man infinity gauntlet next
10:40 you almost do
The Hacksmith 70 years old: "So today we are building the DMC Delorian from Back to the Future that can fly!"
As much as everyone wants a real life superhero we just don’t need one. We don’t have giant Titans dropping down from space to wipe the planet, instead we would have powerful humans saving a cat from a tree
You are my inspiration,originally i wanted to be en engineer,and then a programmer,i am good at both,so i merged the two,and i am working on 3D models and developing software,you are a huuuuuuuuge inspiration,hope you can expand

Let's see who is come from neon man ❤️
Is that a real play button
You guys should get a junk car and cut it in half or make it a movie car
Star wars
I'm gonna hunt the 3k people who disliked the video
I'm actually trying to become an engineer and you are defiantly an inspiration! Thank you for all your hard work.
Only sad thing about this is that YT would send you diamond play button immediately after getting 10M and to some content creators, they wouldn't send it at all because they don't want to promote them... Shameful YT, shameful. Good on you to get one and it got what it deserves. Cheers
The part where the glass started getting super bright reminded me of that scene from iron man two where Tony has to make the new iron man core
*Gets a diamond play button*  Normal people: hang it on the wall. Hacksmith: Cut it in half...with a lightsaber.
The playbutton at 13:46 actually looks very nice with that yellow/ orange play symbol
Chutiya😂
You guys should make real giant Glados robot from Portal 2 game.
When the Hacksmit campus opens I wanna work there. Right now I am studying electrical engineering and this channel keeps me motivated to get through some of the more difficult classes I'm taking and I wanna give back to the people that have helped keep me motivated.
Neon man viewers mark your attendence here... 😂😂😂
I gotta say that don't mind of the critics. Most of them are ready to run their mouth but aren't ready to do anything. You have created something unique and have build your dream and it has been awesome to watch since I found your channel through LTT. I'm still excited to see Power lifter ready some day! ;) You have been and are an example of positivity and it is always awesome to see your enthusiasm and positive energy you give out on your channel with all of your co-hacksmithers! Keep it up and I hope to see your Hacksmith campus in the future!

yoyoyo gotta sick and possible idea, try making a bat suit from batman arkham series with some different mats obviously cuz they are expensive, try using graphene (not graphite)for the under suit. then tiny pieces of kevlar, tungsten, titanium sandwitched for the abdominal muscles and chest shoulders and fore arms and lower legs, then some kind of tear resistant and shock absorbant material (make sure that the mat is composite),  then do the amazing work you did with ironmans helmet on the cowl (include  the mask- take off taser) also make the belt coded as well, last but not least try making the suit insulated
hey I have a project for you guys make the preator suit of the doom slayer from doom eternal  [with the shoulder mounted grenade launcher and the retractable blade and all that stuff]

Hi may i please work if you?, I just graduated in university in engineering and coding. My dream is to one day work with you all and be part of the team
I can see that same spark as Grant had in everything you do, that's probably why I was drawn to the channel in the first place. Keep up the good work
make spidey web shooter... ..
Pls stop saying the Worlds First plasma ligt Saber becuse a YouTube Bay the name of alle lab he mate One 5 months ago you online 1 Month ago.  Sorry for exsposing you
I bet 7 years later probably less Hacksmith university will be exist.
He sounded like a battle droid with that mask on
But some stuff you invented comes with consequences that may cause harm to everyone so be responsible for what you’re making
Who else is trying to grow their YT channel during this quarantine. Let’s help one another, Much love
I heard you read all comments so how hard is engenering because I am still trying to figure out what I Wana do with my life i wanted to be a cop but i am intrested in other paths currently I am learning how to code and try to make video games next I Wana earn engenering so what is the fist step and how hard is it on a scale of 1 to 10

คนไทยครับ
Noooooo people work so hard to get a play button only to be sawn in half by something like that for a video...
That's a tough button...
The hack smith is real innovation. Not apple 😂
Bruh, THAT’S IRREPLACEABLE!
everybody: congrats hacksmith for 10 million subs  me:why is no one talking about the burnt diamond play button
We can all agree that James is by definition a mad scientist
So you created a lightsaber a captian america sheild and a wakanda sheild and other stuff you guys have done more than enough
U are crazy who melts their dimond play buton
12:22
This man just sacrificed his only physical achievement of 10 million subs on yt to a light saber. Nice
Make the assasins creed Valhalla hidden blade
diamond award is 10m or 1m?
You should forge a sword with the melted part and put the glass in the hilt
Youtube when they saw this video: Are we a joke to you?
I LOVE YOU
I would want one of the team to make projects custom for their children
Make an we shooter that works
I like the team doing their own projects because it has a different perspective
Jacksucksatlife would be mad
this sounds like a long sales pitch  haha
The first Jedi in real life:
Requiescat in pace Hacksmith's good friend, I'd just suffered a great loss in my family as well, a beloved one here for 20 years ever since my birth, I understand your pain Hacksmith. ALbeit the anguish, remember to take some quality rest from sadness and grief my friend, your lips are pale white it seems, know that all departures are temporary, even it may seem like forever. Its not goodbye, its see you around^^, Im a new sub but I do appreciate what you and your channel stands for!! Thank you!
Bruh who be disliking this like come on
Real life iron man = hack smith
Insane and I’ve beeen watching since ur captain America shield build where it was magneted to ur arm
Did you read this comment?
Some YouTubers use gloves when handling this trophy     This mans does not care at all that just shows how much he loves his subscribers. He would rather use his diamond play button for content than as a trophy
Cooking with the hacksmith.  Amazing
Jangan nangis bang...
13:33 that looks like an amazing play button
Can you guys please make the chain sword from Warhammer 40k
Hey, james. I know you'll see this by statistics alone. One thing I can understand is how you feel. I love what you have done. While I do miss seeing you being more hands on with projects, I want you to be happy too and I'm liking where hacksmith industries is heading. I wish I had the skills to help and join. I'd love to be the tech guy.   Anyway, emotional stuff aside, I'm moved by your feelings and how the first bit was. I could hear you. I know you were about to cry. I know how that feels. You are an awesome person and I'm glad you are where you are in life. Just remember to take care of yourself and you'll achieve what you're striving for. I wish I could talk to you, at least in text but I'll accept this. Anyway I'll let you keep reading.  Have fun
Whatever happened to the Lords Mobile contest announcement?
Hey brother... Its a request to you and your team .. please make blades of chaos from god of war 🥺
I didn't know Keanu Reeves knew how to make a light saber.  ps. your channel is extraordinary- from production quality to actually making badass stuff!
Im getting the little play button for b-day. even if its worth money i dont think i would sell it tho it would be like a family heirloom
Can I study at Hacksmith Campus? That would be awesome like the best campus in the world.
If he reads all comments, is he reading this one?
Hi hacksmith  I am big fan of you which engineer are you I want to be engineer like you when I will be big
Ur sooo rich hmm
You burnt your progress
Thank you for doing all of this for us. Your story is inspiring. Just plz remember that 99% are positive and that is insanely amazing.
Look at your play button, now back to me, now back to your play button - your play button is now molten! Anything is possible at Hacksmith Industries. I'm on a Hacksmith Binge.
12:22
I am so proud!
I love your vids,and just to let you know I appreciate you and a lot do so keep doing what you are and in some ways we are all the hacksmith by working hard, we love you hacksmith and thank you for your hard work for us.❤️❤️
Engineering Jesus ❤️❤️
When you actually make a lightsaber
why
Worlds first plasma bass lightsaber Versus unbreakable box
So proud of you man, it's amazingly inspiring to see how far you have come and so so exciting to see what you have planned for the future. You are basically who I want to be and because of that you are the only person I have ever allowed myself  to look up to. I wish I had the business skills to be up there with you.
next you should try to do The flash and try to make really fast boots 🥾 if you can’t that’s OK You are the best keep making awesome videos
Ok, at first I was skeptical about watching him cut the Play Button, but after seeing the end result, my god that is cool! You are one hell of an inspiration, Hacksmith! And who knows, maybe one day I'll be able to record videos for you. Once I get into college and study videography, anyways.  On a side note, I think your work is amazing! I had only recently heard about you when Contest of Champions annouced your first collab with them when you did Civil Warrior's shield. But now that I've found your channel, I am so glad I did! Keep doing what you're doing, dude! And I hope you achieve your dream!👍
The heart to heart was so amazing. I love you're positive outlook regardless of the negative feedback
Can you make real hulk buster ?
*Diamond Play Button is evolving!*     Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dunnnnn dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dunnnnnnn dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dunnnnn                          *.....into Rainbow Play Button!*  Dun dun dun da da da da da daaaaaaa
I just love ur videos , they are just awesome , it makes me happy, i want be a engineer like u sir
You said that you wanted a future where superheroes exist, paramedics exists cops, firefighters superheroes do exist
I know you don't want to be Tony Stark and that this is a group effort but dude you created the avengers
Hey can u get a website where you sell some of your stuff? I understand not selling the weapons but what about stuff like the Batman rappelling device
hey i live in Utah come visit
You one of the most nice and caring people on YouTube, my dude you deserve to go on a vacation and chill for a while and I hope you can accomplish that dream of yours. But that cooking is a bit triggering to watch.
Bro whoever doesn’t appreciate the work he does just screw off and leave him the hell alone. APPRECIATE HIM HE IS THE NERD GOD
They should totally have stopped at blue and orange.
You are so cool can you follow me on tiktok plz at tyler oliver
Youtube watching this like "👁️👄👁️ dafaq"
Make the mandolorian blaster
We’re a couple of steps closer to the age of superheroes
I'm so grad you said that!
I wonder if it would cut stuff much faster if the fuel was changed to oxygen-hydrogen.
you should be the first person to go mine asteroids that'll be a worth a lot of money and it'll help you grow your business even bigger
Mad respect for this guy and its sick to see what he did just sounds like he is gonna cry rather then be proud of himself and how far he has come. Your sick dude honestly and smart as all hell talk with a little gusto and sound like the stud you are... so much respect I hope you really read all these comments
12:40 bye.
He always talks like he’s a bad actor reading a script
To show how powerful the light saber is I cut the Diamond Playbutton in half
You guys are doing amazing work here on youtube. Keep up the good work!!
I’ve recently began a project to make full ODST armor from halo made of metal , watching your videos inspired me to try and do something like this. Your predator helmet with the thermal vision is what really got me started and you’re making an impact on me at least.
The diamond play button be like: I WON'T BE CUT, I WON'T BE CUT, I... AAAAAHHH!!!!
Can you make a storm blast with a working Shockwave that blasts everything back?
mans just created the rainbow play button
You should make the mandolin sniper blaster
If you make the BTTF delorean into lego I will give you 30% of my sales when i become CEO of lego.
R/madlads
U guys are very smart creative and the best u make my dreams come true 😊😊
Since christmas is coming up you should make a self moving sled please and I am subed
You inspire me your vids are really cool I wish I was as smart as you
Normal you tubers:we got a diomand play button let's frame it. Hacksmith let's break it. Me:✌️😑
12:22
I'm waiting for the day u open hacksmith school which I'd sign up for
There's no way he's gonna actually cut the diamond play button  edit: he actually did it...
who else started to tear up when he talked about Grant I still miss him
If you think what he does is not good enough then leave or show me that you can do better than him prove that’s it’s not good enough I’ll wait
you can hear the pain in his voice when he says that he cut it in half.
Yo imagine him making the dark Sabre
YouTube must have watched this saying: what the hell are they doing? we spent so much money on that!
Love the addition of 'Industries' to the name! Awesome seeing this become much larger from where it started and realistically does take a team to make exponential growth possible. Not to mention, much more enjoyable by sharing the experience with others. Congrats on the milestone, Hacksmith Industries!! Love you y'all! Here's to the next step 😁
youtube here a light saber vs a playbutton   2million people   INTERESTING
i wanted to skip to 12:00 but i wanted to hear what this dude was saying
He is a mad man i tell you! A MAD MAN!!!
Does it really make the lightsaber sound??
Like the protosaber
Anyone think he should make ready player one stuff such as haptics ( I know he did the ready player one video already but I mean like actually making the haptics if not then ok) also great job on the 10 million subs love your videos
He’s already close to 11 mill now
Super cool, but if I ever reach 10M subs, I think I'll keep my play button in one piece. 😂 Congrats on 10M, almost 11M!
Iv been a subber 8 years know (it won't show the accuracy of when I subbed because I made this account a few years ago this is not my first account)
You guys should make a speeder bike
a chroma play button
I was gonna cry
Did you get another one?
You should team up with Mark Rober
Yo that speach touch my heart 😭 man you are really good at what you do and don't let anyone tell you differently 🤧
love you man
15:00 - 15:30  kinda reminds me of Tony Stark's arc reactor within his chest when he first created a new element.
your awsome
play baseball with the lightsaber
The glowing diamond reminded me of when Tony Stark made the triangle arc reactor
Another video whoo hoo

utlra
work on the blade and make the plasma saber v2 that can get up to a higher temp using a new gas combo or something like that
famous yet still underrated somehow
1 like = 1 like
make a tv show
Collab with somebody and do something really cool
No matter what people say, keep going, you control what you do, not them.
my tooth hurts     By the way, Hacksmith, you're super inspiring to me! While I'm definitely no engineer, I love all of your videos and some of the projects you do give me a rush of nerdrenaline (yes I just said nerdrenaline). Anyway, I've been a struggling YouTuber for two years now, and your talk about all that has really helped me out :D stay epic and much love from Michigan!   and don't run from your inner Tony Stark my guy it is meant to be
next up: lightsaber v children in basement
Lightsaber v human
Make Mando's rifle or something from the Mandalorian!!!
You are insane
I have so much respect for the beard.
You should make a 10 mill sword from the internal metal
I have been watching you for a long time and I just noticed that I wasn’t subscribed for so long . -.

This guy is going from Tony Stark to Elon Musk      Or the other way around
YOUR GOING TO MAKE ME CRY
12:22
Nice the diamond play button is its weakness
When did they change the channel name to Hacksmith Industries
Hey I'm wondering when I graduate to get a welding degree can I work for you
Me on the inside you like why you do this
very proud of you guys! And it has been amazing watching you guys for years and seeing all the upgrades to your equipment and projects. been an amazing ride so far.

Titanium play button (50,000,000 subs)
Can he shave his beard
The history of your channel sent me back four years and almost made me cry. Then YouTube puts in an advertisement about cooking with the navy.
Lightsaber is the best invention yet.
I teared up watching the beginning what a great guy he deserves all of things he wants
im 11 and i made a theme song for you on guitar reply if you wanna check it out
Bro people try so hard to get that and you destroy it

I love u and all of your videos I started watching in 2016 it’s fun to watch your videos
Cut ur hair g
YOUTUBE watching this- Well nice...
People who don't have any results in theirs life complain about others rather than work,so they spend their time complaining,for sure man you deserve many accolades and compliments, it's a great job I'm watching since 2016 or something. Let's be cheerful for what we're done,your crew done a great job since then,use the negative energy to create positive boost.
I will be happy if you make a lord of the ring ring you dont have too though
make the play button into a sword
Hello 👋 Do you think you can maybe make the flash ring with the Suit  coming out
Alternative title: Tony stark cuts a diamond play button
You could cast the playbutton in the MK1 Iron man visor-
Is it normal to destroy, deface, and ruin the Diamond play button?
Poor jack sucksatlife
why would you cut your 1000000 subs in half
Please MAKE A MANDOLRIAN VIBRO BLADE
WHY DİD YOU DO THAT
Hacksmith : we're gonna slice the play button we got from youtube Youtube :👁️👄👁️
He was trying to hit the ten minutes mark.
Video starts at 10:15
He still has no white hair tho
Dude I was so scared during his talk that he was gonna say he was gonna leave Hacksmith Industries. I'm so glad he isn't, and I'm still waiting for that next Alien Power Loader video, its bean awhile so it should be a good one :)
Omg love your videos
When you don't realize you clicked on a Hacksmith Industries video until he mentioned it.
I can't financially support you with money and visit the industry for events, so I'm going to strive to intern for you. When it happens, I will cry tears if joy infront of your team when I get there.
Aruan 2.0

I've been here since the beginning... your emotion is coming right out of the screen and touching my soul.   I've always dreamed of doing what you have accomplished so far.   I don't know how to say this but you instill hope.    If I ever find a way to help change the world,  I will do so.     Keep being awesome hacksmith, keep inspiring, and keep instilling hope.
Everyone: He's real life Tony Stark Me: He's all of the OG Avengers. The mind of Stark, the body of Cap, the strength of Hulk, and the beard of Thor

If we will be able to buy products from Hacksmith Industries, I would be hyped af. I think making this a corporation is neat.
James with goggles sounds like a clone ears battle droid
I'm glad I know diddly squat about engineering and whatnot, this way James and the team can teach me! Cheers!
He was a great guy, so are you, all of you are an amazing hacksmith, the team holds the legacy beautifully, keep on doing what your doing.
TO SHOW YOU THE POWER OF PLASMA *lightsaber activation noise* I MELTED THIS PLAY BUTTON IN HALF

They should make the Master Cycle Zero from the Legend of Zelda out of a motorbike!!!
If that playbutton had a mind: why was i sent here to them?why me? why am i being burned right now? What did i do to deserve this?
Hacksmith: We want to make products that improve life. Me: I need a lightsaber to help with...stuff.

Thanks for the cooking experience
I wanted to buy the play bottom but Jesus fuck it got snatched up quickly I went to buy it when it came out but I had a dispute with my bank
What about a arcreactor made out of the metal? Like when the armor is complete
Y'all are amazing and really inspiring and I admire what you guys do.
This video is the entirety of youtube summed up into one video
HackSmith if you use a light sabre a shaze in a vid I will sibscribe
Why do you even do that
Loved this video
Aruan Felix liked
I hope youtube gives you another one just cuz you deserve it!!!
When I was young I thought building this stuff only took a few days but I know people that, dont build this type of things, but they still build things similar and it takes months and sometimes even years
10:13 This channel is officially better than Tasty lol
Me:"project we want to see in 2040 hacksmith building the gigantic robot from Pacific realm"
Most you tubers: hang it on the wall     Hacksmith: cuts it in half
6 years later and the content just keeps getting better.
please tell me you're making something from kingsman 3
Dude created the lightsaber and a bunch of other stuff that people can only dream of! James is one of the nicest, honest, and genuinely good people in the world I've ever seen! He cares about people and not the money.  He's the first real life superhero, the Jedi and the legend, and nobody can tell me otherwise!
have you guys ever thought of making Spiderman's web shooters, that seems like an incredibly hard project
INDESTRUCTIBLE SUIT FOR TESTING PROJECTS!!! OR A FIRE RESISTANT SUIT  (Like to make it happen!!)
Man, I’m crying
Good job man your awesome
Doesn't YouTube feel disrespected by cutting their gift to you?
Dude your vids are awsome!!! Keep up the good work, by the way your 1 day build challenges are soo cool
I m confirm that he is mad
Youtube: gives the hacksmith the diamond playbutton Hacksmith: LETS DESTROY IT
Hay hacksmith i love your videos and i have woched all of your videos and all I have to say is keep doing what you're doing and people that are complaining just don't understand all the stuff that you've been doing but I'm appreciative for all the stuff you do you make me laugh and make me morning make stuff so in the future I'm going to start my own business hopefully on creating stuff so I have to say is thank you so much for inspiring me and keep up the amazing work
🤩
12:22
Who watched the entire video and didnt just skip it?     I did,because these people are so amazing and inspiring. Keep up the good work! 😁

This will probably get Weaponized in the future
damascus play button👍
Every video well into the millions now, you're definitely sitting pretty. :-)
is it just me or with the mask does he sound like a b1 battle droid?         just me? alright.
12:22
Jev title: I unlocked the DeMascus play button. But I lost my diamond one.
You only get 1 life. You can't live trying to make everyone happy   Whether you work in the oil fields of Texas, or a inventor on YouTube
10 million subs.  10 added inches to the biceps. Not bad
Here from 60k subscribers and I love your channel keep it going
It looks so cool when it is purple the play button
Man, I actually was excited for "Cooking with The Hacksmith" I'm disappointed...
An diamond is made out of many pure carbon particles. If you break it. Then you need to sell it to the government
There needs to be a Hacksmith Museum. Definitely would be a dope thing to have when this pandemic is over of course and if all the other company logistics allow for it.
Please have Cuba in mind for your international plans! I'd love to know that at some point there's an internship option or any other collaboration between Hacksmith Industries and the University I studied  :)  Ref: "Universidad Tecnológica de la Habana José Antonio Echeverría"   Keep up and good luck!
Dear James, you are a true hardworking legend who inspires all of us with all of your amazing work and projects, please don't let some stupid people in the comment section tell you any less.
Men you’re crazy 😝👍
I just finished a game called Anthem.  It would be insane if you made a Javelin from that game, just a suggestion, obviously it would be so much work though
Hi

Ngl it lookes sick  while being heated!!!
It’s crazy how he used to live in a garage and now owns huge warehouses and builds actual lightsabers, I bet in a few years he’s gonna have a huge HQ with private avenger  jets and Star Wars ships
He went from looking like Robert Downey Jr. to Chris Evans to Chris Hemsworth. LOL

1:44 Palpatine: Ok, less talky talky and more figthy figthy!

Im your number 1 asian fan.  I made a youtube channel to fund my studies, I'm planning to take an engineering course by using the money that I'll earn (i wish) and hoping to work with you soon.

Bruh u r my y yr old dreams incarcerated Love what u do
10M subs? Wow, I think it's time for Hacksmith Industries to have it's own theme song. Sure, it's not on theme with super heroes or comics, but that shouldn't stop "The HacksmithS<--" from making it real, right?
Obi One : don’t try it  Hacksmith : I tried it
Make attack on titan 3d maneuver gear One more time plsss

Hello there Hacksmith, I would like to say I have been watching your videos for a long time now and I’m really impressed with what you have done. I appreciate you and your team and the impact you are having on me. For a the longest time I have been fascinated by mechanics, and you have taught me a lot. I just wanted to say thank you so much for the learning opportunity you have provided. Thank you and keep up the amazing work!
Hey hacksmith i will stay on your channel no matter what 🙂

can you do a youtube sword usng the playbutton metal
its just a flame thrower imo
James and Grant Thompson were the youtubers that helped me push foreword during tough years in middle school and high school. Almost every day after school I would watch new or old videos from these two youtubers. I even started a club at school where we would make Grant's projects such as the matchbox rockets and even the mini metal foundry which we used to inspire the school to recycle their cans.  Thanks to these two amazing people I was able to start my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering this year.  Thanks so much James and your team, and thanks Grant, I miss you. JLDJ
Dude I hope you get asked to build stuff for movies
you sir are a certified wackjob
5:02 im i only one who thinks he kinda looks like john wick

I really hope that you do not take in the negativity (like one of my previous comments) to heart but rather a piece of idea as you go forward towards the future. All the best to you and your team and stay safe.

Despite the fact that play button cost 3 grand he still did it
I do love having "the Hacksmith" work on the projects, but I totally believe you guys wouldn't be where y'all are without growing the team and business. I'll always take weekly uploads, bigger projects, and long-term success over having you die off within a few years. Keep on working. I can't wait to see the cool stuff y'all make in the upcoming years
You've got a subscription from me after those first ten minutes.
Bro please turn into the old style of you face

This was very inspirational for my YouTube channel. I'm only now starting and have gained a ton of inspiration from you guys, LTT, Colin Furze, etc on the types of videos that I will post. Thank you.
Okay so now we need an energy sword from Halo. How that would be possible I’m not sure.
so if u hit someone with that really quick like a light saber would they instantly die? jw XD
Hack smith in 2050: I made a suit that makes you live forever
Your speech in the beginning of the video was breathtaking
Loved hearing about your future plans, it was inspirational to hear (especially for me on a personal note as I'm contemplating what's next in my career). Also, you should totally give the table a raise =8-)

Could you hypothetically create a Lamborghini or Ferrari exactly how the manufactures do it?
You can buy a replacement play button for like 3k
Is tgat is real Diamond
I wish I still had my old YouTube account. I subscribed at about 30k on that account. I remember one specific comment I made about how one day you would have a million subs. I’m sorry James but 6th grade me was lying and didn’t really think you would go that far 😭 I’m in 10th grade now and your channel is still my favorite thing ever!
Hello there
One day I say this to day but one day he will discover something that will save us all ill come back when
These videos are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
Your Iooking like Iion
Hacksmith is out future  Also you should make a five nights at freddy's animtronic
Hacksmith industries . I got an idea to male the glasses of scott from x men . U can use the same tech used for iron man guantlets but widen the glass usedn fit it into  The glass and place a switch near the ears part of the helmet to switch it on so that it would be like how scott places his hand on to shoot laser beams
I’m a very long fan I love your vids
This is a great video keep it up american thor
This made me sad
I was a subscriber since the first exoskeleton although I did see some of your earlier stuff before that. I honstley was so impressed and inspired by just that i had know clue this channel would grow to be so big and influential. Every one there inspires and motivates me to be better and learn more. When you where giving your 5 year plan I could tell just how much it ment to you and hosntly even tho I'm not there doing the work this channel has grown to mean so much to me too and so it made me so happy to see where your going and how much your planning on doing. To adress the issues with unrealistic expectations tho I dont really have the words to help but I do want you to know that you've not only inspired so many people who've help us not feel alone. You've givin everyone who watches your chanle the child like amazement we all used to have every time we watch your videos. So just know just becouse there are a few mean and jealous people out there theres many times that who support you and love what you've done. You inspired me and so many others to want to learn and make a difference too. So on behalf of all your subscribers thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
Double bladed lightsaber
Aww. :( I'm sorry you get all of this negative stuff on your videos. Make less content if you need to, to make higher quality videos. You and your team are AMAZING and I love everything you do. Good luck on your master plan!

You’re such an inspiration to us all
My mans lookin like Rhett

Awesome!
I have been a huge fan of Hacksmith ever since the Elysium exo suit video years ago and I am blown away at the progress Hacksmith industries has achieved! When I heard you were getting the facility you have now i was amazed! I look forward to your videos every Thursday! Best of luck to Hacksmith Industries!!

If people just made a blast door out of Diamond Play Button, no Jedi would have the patience to cut through it
:O
they should make a turret from portal
I'm so excited to see where this channel goes. I've been a fan for a long time and while I'm not going into STEM, I am following my dreams. I can't wait to watch you follow yours and I'll definitely be a fan for a long time
I rarely comment on the videos, but a video of this nature at this momentous occasion to me earns the highest honor I can bestow as one of the greatest updates, reviews, and planning videos I have ever seen. This video makes me happy enough to carry through the school week. I am very limited on funds myself but if I do become financially stable and independent, this will be one of the channels that earns my monetary support. But always keep in mind you have my absolute cheering support because this is a plan I can really get behind. Love y'all and all you have done and what you do in the future!
15:35 i almost fainted
Hacksmith does something   Elon musk write that down write that down
these guys can rob a bank with no problem
I remember I used to watch u when I had a faze of wanting to be a superhero
Only if the lightsaber was longer it would be perfect still really cool though
Hacksmith gets diamond play button Me had under 100 subs him destroys it Me: 😤

New Video idea: Slicing human in HALF with REAL LIFE Lightsaber
F in chat for Jacksucksatlife
This is amazing! Keep doing what your doing! I love you hack smith industries!!! You guys are awesome!!
Dude real super heroes exist! They don't have any particular super power but they can have a huge influence in people's lives with simple actions. They can be encouraging people to do great stuff, telling them you believe they can do it or even teaching what you know and spending time with them. Some celebrities become heroes and don't even notice it.
This was an amazing video... But.... Your left bicep is slightly smaller than you right so I'll sadly have to dislike for lack of perfection.
4:30 I love how he used the same line as Happy in SM-FFH. Idk if that was unintentional but Everyone Liked That
You guys should build a replica of an Ultron Sentry and see how hard it is to destroy... as much as I love the movie, those boys wouldn’t actually crumble to being punched and shot the way they did.
Yo James! We support you dude! Keep doing good things with your team!
Thank you for everything
You should make something from warhammer 40k Bolter would be nice challenge
Sounds to scripted
That masterplan sounds like heaven on earth. Can't wait to see it become reality. And of course congratulations from germany 😄
Does anyone else think James looks kind of like Opie from sons of anarchy right now?
All haters... just shut up!!
What is that made of?
oh man you are the best <3<3<3
If you talk bad about this YouTube channel then just stop watching the videos because all this man and his team does is work hard and break their backs to make content for us(the people who actually like and doesn’t complain about the videos)and I know that it is a struggle. Just keep working hard because HACKSMITH will make it far and will be know by all👍🏼😁 All love❤️
Been watching since 600k
I feel bad for you
I JUST LOVE WATCHING PEOPLE BE DUMB WITH DANGEROUS TOOLS :D
Man you scared me! I 100% thought you were done, btw that may  have been on of the best speeches I've ever heard. You will always be relevant... always
I can't wait to see them mount the discarded ashes of the play button on their wall. It'll be like Anakin at the end of ROTS with a lot less high ground.
BUT Y THO
Someone should show this to jacksucksatlife
Bro you can get banned from yt be careful and have a good week
This is the start of the future
Can it cut through 12 foot thick metal (like qui gon did)
Instead of James,burning it I’ll take it
me being honest this is prob one of their best videos, I've said that over 50 times probably but you guys keep impressing me. thank you.
WoAh We got a reward for 10 mil subs! Let's incinerate it! YeAh!
Who tf would unlike this video
i am buying 10 mini dimond play thing

New name and I love it long live team hacksmith
i watched this video, and at near the end of the first part, i thought that you would be one of the people that make the world better, and since i have lots of life ahead, i decided that you would make my life better, alon with millions of other people. also, i hope that you reach your goals and improve this planet.
No man you do great f*** those haters seriously they ain't got no 2.2 million subscribers YouTube channel so don't think so much about what they say you do you on the real great job by the way I love what you did with the lightsaber
When r u gonna be done the power-loader
I have a feeling your Elon Musk’s cousin or something... but better
You know I would actually love to see a hacksmith cooking show where you cook with your inventions
"We got a very coveted piece of youtube History. So we are going to cut it with our lightsaber!" This is why you and your team are awesome to me. Your speech and plan for the future will most definitely inspire more people to work like you and your team do. I look forward to more amazing invention ideas wether the work or not. You only fail when you stop trying.
This sound fictional but can u make a odm gear from attack on titan?
*YouTube: дарит кнопку на 10 млн* *Hacksmith: режет её световым мечом* *YouTube: Я для тебя какая-то шутка ?🗿*
Coolest channel on YouTube period. Love what you all do and I’m so happy to see what this channel has become
Why aren't they verified
Cut the beard
The avengers aren't real but if they were. They would be people like you guys
I don't normally leave comments on videos, but I have been subbed for many years and seeing the company evolve to where it is today has been such an amazing growth and I hope that all goes well in the future for the company and I am so excited to see all the new amazing content that will be coming along with it
Why the F***k  would you burn the Diamond play button that YouTube oh so gratefully gave you.
You should start a twitch for when you are working on things like the light saber
Hey Hacksmith  Can you make your self fire bending like in avatar the last air bender
This is the end of you my master
bro you got the play button and then just cut it to pieces, almost seems disrespectful to me not gonna dislike it but I'm sorry I can't like the video either
After a while the diamond play button had the collor of a diamond lol
I love yall but why.
I think it was super cool and very inspiring how you made a REAL life full metal iron man helmet and you have even made a gauntlet for it.  here is a cool idea You should make the iron spider suit made of metal.
It’s gonna be so sick when he gets the land to build his big industry 🔥 🔥

I love the channel and the history. Having started my channel a year or go, this video gives me a lot of hope in my projects and where I am taking the channel.  Really appreciate your diligence and perseverance.

12:22
12:22
Make it real any tehnology of Marvel agent of shield
It's your dream, take your pace. I'd advice you to change how often you upload videos, it must be quite time consuming having to build an incredible awesome machine each week. I'd advice you to turn it into a two week update channel, or even a month.  And not only for that, but In general, when people are used to constantly receive an input of AWESOME videos and awesome projects, expectations just grow higher. On a two week basis or even a monthly basis, each video would be much more appreciated and waited upon.  I just love your vision, and I wish you all the success you deserve.
Le bruh

Ummmm.....your getting a new one right?.....
Youtube: *sends hacksmith the diamond play button* Hacksmith: *decides to cut it with the lightsaber* Youtube to hacksmith: *That wasn't very cash money of you*
How about y'all try to make a hoverboard
melt the play button into like a play button sword or something lol
Imagine if when he starts selling a bunch of the things he makes and one of them is the prototype lightsaber, that would be so cool
I love your guys' channel it's amazing and you're right about everything
Bruh Why
YouTube: you’ve done well here’s your reward. Hacksmith: Does it break?
4:55 to 5:02 this is so true! I respect you for what and how You do it guys. Don't worry about the negatives, keep going, but also make time for yourself to rest, mental health is also very important.
If anyone was to change the world I would believe in the Hacksmith team
TRIGGERD
at the start of the vid it was 10.8m subs at the end it was 10.9m ...
ik how you feel and it's ok do you, buddy, we are here for you and this is youtube welcome to the inernet.
Tbh when it was blue it looked so cool
You should partner with ADHD’S world on YouTube
I wonder what would happen if y’all took one of your old designs and did it with a peice of it
Pls make a actual fnaf anamatronic pls pls (i think im asking to much)
‘Well that’s my plan, if you don’t like it, that’s fine, it’s my plan not yours.” 😂
Sou o único brasileiro que gosta desse cara?
I would love to see a second part of the cooking with hack smith episode
You guys are amazing!!!! I can't wait to see where you go.
They should've used this as the last shields in star wars
Its like Aruan, the guy that cut the 100M bottom
I think that it would be so cool if you guys could do some stuff with space and you are doing exactly what I’m planning on doing!
y tho
I recently got a google account so I just subbed to you. You r a rlly cool yt I love ur content
I can see the Youtube play button makers working on a pure tungsten 100M subscriber play button. Time to build the death star laser cannon to splatter a room with the 100M play button.
Do Lightsaber vs aerogel!
Mas if this is the real playbutton, it makes me kinda sad destroy it like that... it's the symbol of your work and dedication all of this years. Destroying it like that... very sad... But you do what you want, it's yours
still half way through the video and i must say this is just one of those really great videos you see in a long time.
the 1st person to cut a diamond play button
General Grievous has escaped
Does YouTube pay you I heard there was a partnership program and you get paid every month depending on how much sub you have ( you would probably be a billionaire
* abgry jacksucks at life noises*
I realy lowe your content and every Time i watch your videos they make me happy😃😃😃
WHY THE FART WOULD YOU DO THIS????
Images he cuts his head of because the saber reflects the beam back at him
it turned blue
You should do a collaboration with mark rover
Congrats dude, you've done incredible things and I look forward to the incredible things to come from Hacksmith Industries.
You have the hair of han solo and the beard of fat Thor
Can you create an improvised RB-79 Ball from gundam series that can maybe even hover a few centimeters above ground??
your channel is beyond inspiring and i cannot thank you enough for being such a great voice of ambition and possibility! i truly cannot wait to follow this journey and watch the amazing things you guys will achieve!
It’s funny how Hacksmith worked so hard for 10 thousand, congrats by the way and then goes and tries to cut it with a his lightsaber. I’m laughing so much I’m liking this video for that
It’s a good channel you don’t need to explain to the losers that can’t get that ! You followed your dreams and made them reality
2 days later 10.9 million subscribers
James you are the best, you make amazing stuff and your videos always spark my imagination and make me happy, you will always have my love and support
Who the hell are the 3.2k people disliking this video!?
This is one of my top career choices right now
Who else here who has bad anxiety saw the name of this video then clicked on the video and watched it and then at the very and got such bad anxiety
I've been watching since I was 9 years old. Back then it was only because of the cool proyects and comic realities. I'm now 14 and I'm watching for the ability behind them and the intelligence it takes to do them. I really look after James and all of the crew at Hacksmith Industries. We will watch your career with great interest through the next years and who knows maybe someday I can become a Hacksmith too or at least get to know y'all in person. You are an inspiration to me and I thank u for that
Congrats on the 10 Million, and I'm so glad to hear that you plan to keep pushing and to use your platform to try and bring more good into the world. You mentioned a comment about how there are always naysayers about the projects just done for "the luls" or that doesn't have a direct benefit. But a comment from Neil DeGrasse Tyson always rings in my head when people bring this up. He mentions that his Grad School Supervisor, also an Astro-physicist, published a now well known article about using magnetism in the study of space and Astro-Physics applications. This paper had no overt benefit, and in fact to this day the research itself isn't extremely beneficial beyond the study of space. However, someone read this article, and using the principals in the article he invented the MRI or Magnetic Resonance Imaging system, which is one of the most significant Medical tools used today. In short, any step forward, no matter how inconsequential it may seem is a step forward that may lead someone else to take even greater leaps. thus, all research and exploration is important, not just that which we see a direct benefit to us before hand. I hope that you continue to inspire people and grow as you currently hope to, I will stay here, eagerly awaiting each advancement, and hope for the day when I can have my own lightsaber at my side XD. Stay well, and take care of yourself.
Youtube: Video was posted 2 days ago  Also Youtube: A comment was posted 3 days ago  Me: viewer.exe has stopped working

I wonder what the Hacksmith Industries could make if they partner with Elon musk (yes i know so original haha) but really, it'd be cool to see them working together on something.
Who else thought he sounded like a droid from the clone wars
I love this idea so much, I was here at 2 million and I still really wanna see you guys grow and make more amazing things
Make fnaf real
But its only a big welder
2 years in the future there will be some notification like we build drones that can build a bridge, or some kind of even more super accurate lightsaber
12:22
Youtube should start making bullet proof vest using the material of the diamond play button

12:22
Hello Hack-smith Industries. I’m a kid who likes marvel and I’m wondering if you can make me a caps shield. A suggestion is you could make black widows weapons?
You should build a door that closes on you instead of opens
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😔😔😔😔😔😔🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
I really want to be here someday!
I have an idea why don't you melt the 3 play buttons into one weird play button 💡
It's official in the next 10 years there will me avengers irl
i was born in 2006 :)
Out of the metal make a GODLY looking sword And call it the Hacksmith Smite for a vid
You can re order the play button for around 3 grand USD, just in case you'd actually like to hang it up somewhere
He announces that they shifted to industry and building a campus. What I hear: lightsabers with an integrated power source incoming...
If u ever need an almost anti lightsaber door use play buttons
Please do a collab with frankly built it would be a great collab and u could help him grow and grow and grow please everyone wants to see this
How do you like the idea of the 10M mini Play-Button saying YOU one of over 10 million Supporter, i'd like that
Hey James, I looked on your site for how to get a job with Hacksmith Industries, for future reference, and it says that I would need a valid work permit to apply, but to get a work permit I would need a job offer. How would this work?
this shows how durable those play buttons are
Very nice and inspiring video!! Go on like so👍🏼😃 Best YouTuber !!!!!
For 2/3rd of the whole video I was thinking "did I click on the wrong video?"
Nobody:  Me: 14:27 THATS A BLUE GEM CASE HARDENED!
you guys are awsome
YOU HAVE TO VUYA NEW ONE NOW
Did you know that diamond melts at 3547 degrees
Hack smith in 2069: building a real star destroyer
Imagine hating on someone who’s making real life lightsabers
Aruan fez isso, só que na versão de pobre...
this makes my outside nerd expand
You really look like tony stark in the avengers game
Hmm you seem to want to make Jack mad? Nah JK that's very cool
Beautiful.
Diamond Play Button: Case Hardened
You inspired me 2 years ago. Love you
Hacksmits do something from cocolonized of anime for example naruto or boruto or arc of the anime
The blue play button looks SICK
Does anyone know what he uses on computer to build the projects
Don't let jack see this, or he will cry
That makes the inner nerd so happy
The mass looks to help resist the heat. It is good to see you have built something that will last for the foreseen future.
The play button was made form nokias
"you can tell this one is fresh because we don't have 11 million subscribers yet." 5 days later: 10.9M Subscribers
Imagine him accidentally cutting his head off with the lightsaber
The Hacksmith and all at Hacksmith industries r legends, inspiring generations of engineers to greater things. Most people on my apprenticeship course know who the Hacksmith is and know all of u r awesome!
I’ve seen people FRAME their DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON I’ve seen people WORSHIP their DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON  And now I can say.....I’ve seen someone DESTROY their DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON
its been about a month and I still cant believe that its possible to make a working protosaber
Woe this got deep
H
If anyone could it wold be u take us to space.
Man fuck the haters. I love what you and your team produces and try to watch every episode that i can. Keep up the amazing work 👏🏻
Damn this is heartwarming 🥺 your awesome
ngl i almost cried during the Grant Thompson part
You are awesome!
Congrats on the mile stone.  I’ve been watching you since the start.   Keep it up.  👍👍👍.
After finishing the video.. I have one thing to say..  now here me out...   Imagine.. hacksmith space station
Thank you 🥲
Isn't there a chart that shows the times when people don't watch videos, for example the number would be lower at the outro of the videos and higher at the start. It would be interesting to see how many people skipped to 12:22
Dude it’s okay your doing great if you want take a month break or longer we appreciate you and what you’ve done thank you
My most favorite video of all from the hacksmith
I feel like this would be a mission in a stupid game...defend the saber so I can melt through the the play button!
This dude can beat haumea without pyrokinetics
Guys stop commenting so that he doesnt have to read 20k comments every week
Youtube:We are not going to give you any more buttons.
why ?
No one:  Me:Adding more 2x in the 2x speed.
When he has the mask on he sounds like a battle droid
you ever heard of FIRST I am a part of FRC Team 4561, The TerrorBytes from RTP (Durham) North Carolina USA
Was labert der mich hier voll?
mr Hacksmith I'm sorry that you have to deal with negative comments I really feel like people shouldn't be treating you badly since you work your ass of to make subscribers happy.You've made a difference in my life.
Only 3 people are capable to be iron man.... 1. RDJ 2. Elon Musk 3. Hacksmith
You legend
Thank you so much and I appreciate what u do and u are amazing
Aruan da gringa
I think we all know that we know that we need the double bladed version
This video is so wholesome, this dude cares about everyone but himself, take a break my man you deserve it

How to I buy your since in Bangladesh
The molten play button
U r a very talented man and i hope you achieve your goals very soon :)
People call me tony stark he says am tryin to assemble a team defo avenger movie 2.0
if we ever get as futuristic as we do in the movies set to the year 2050 its cuz of hacksmith
I know you won't see this most likely, but I just want to say, in regards to the negative comments and the criticism: I know it's hard, but just take the good and leave the bad. Understand what they are actually trying to tell you, and separate that from their emotion. There's a lot of broken, underdeveloped, messed up people, that are not in a good place. It's not like those nasty comments are coming from someone like you. It's just messed up people punching up because they don't feel like what they say matters anyways. So when you understand how broken someone is, it's a lot harder to take their criticism personally. So that's my advice, keep that wider perspective, it will help you to both understand people and to not be hurt by what they say.
You should make a mandalorian helmet where the antenna is an infred camera
This is by far the most emotional video on this channel 😭
Well... That was one tough son of a button
You should make some sort of flying machine for your next big project!!!!
ɦɛʟʟօ
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I love this channel and all the content you put out. I’m a machinist from the twin islands of Trinidad & Tobago, which is a pair of small islands north of Venezuela. Your videos inspire me and I look forward to them every week. ✌🏾✊🏾
I have followed your channel a long time and until recently I did not have the knowledge or ability to start experimenting on project i have wanted to. Growing up i always wanted to be a great inventor and even came up with brilliant ideas but had no one to share them with or a way to make them true. When I saw your channel years ago i thought this is cool stuff i want to do this. I dont have the personality to do YouTube videos but i love seeing that there are others in this world that want to create, do, and teach. You have given knowledge and hope to many people like yourself who want to become inventors and succeed. I want to say thank you from not only myself but all those of like minds that love these sort of things and say keep up the amazing work you are all doing at Hacksmith Industries and do not give up on the dream of being a real life Tony Stark, just remember he had help when he needed it at times too.  I also hope that the research center blooms into an awesome establishment and can help millions.
Most youtubers: Hang the play button up on their wall Hacksmith Industries: Puts seasonings on and cooks their play button, then cuts it in half.
Don’t listen to all the haters and nay Sayers. It’s easy to complain when you haven’t tried anything remotely as impressive. Keep up the amazing work. Can’t wait to see what you accomplish in the next 5 years.
Keep up the good work all your videos are gold
Do you still have the old garage
I’ve been here since 100 k I really love your videos and I’m really exited about future content
Why did you do that?!
That baked play button actually looks delicious
Love ❤ from India brother
make a big focusable flashlight
make a big focusable flashlight
Damn, your amazing speach brought tears to my eyes, I hope you get what you need to change the world. Good luck hacksmith Industries 😉
You should make doctor octopuses tentacles
2 days later and you’re at 10.9M
For y'all 1% posting them crappy comments, just leave. Its not like you could even do what he does so go back to living in your mom's basement and leave amazing channels like Hacksmith Industries alone. Any haters aren't wanted here so you can just leave.
Do u sell this plasma light sabers
So, Aruan Felix did nothing wrong all along?
I supported you from the beginning, not the very beginning, but I know you didn’t have any where near a million when I found you.   I hope you get even bigger in the future and make even more huge projects like these.
Love u bro
Yet still shops at my local princess auto lmao👍
Please costruction asterisk ser veresta
CONGRATS GUYS
This speech inspired me to continue my research on something that has been imagined but hasn't been created. I am still in high school (I am a senior) but I started years ago. I sometimes think it is impossible because of how difficult it is, but the speech really told me to continue on.
3:44 I wasn’t ready for you to bring up Grant and my heart sank at the mention of his name and I nearly started tearing up the instance I saw his face 😢
Meet me in La
I can feel the emotion in your voice. And who wouldn't, you're reaching your dreams and then some. Yo shoot for the moon but aim for the stars
Your a beast
He looks regret doing this..
you are a real master dude! i follow you since the exoskeletok mk2 days, and always this channel is a good place to be and take a tea or a coffe after a hard day of study and work, a true referent of the media and a real life hero, greeting from Chile and keep going high! <3
This hurt my heart
Jack is somewhere in a corner shaking and crying right now.
Brother u r a future scientist came to present best of luck soon u will get the ruby button wait have patience and invent new things once best of luck love from india😍😍😍🥰🥰
Man that shirt makes your arms look big
Hi iam brazil
YouTube: sends play button Hacksmith: a fine addition to my collection  Hacksmith: *puts it with other play buttons*
I have to say, I love everything you've done and I hope that your master plan comes to fruition. Although I have to say, I don't really see you as Tony Stark anymore. If anything you are definitely Howard Stark! Think about it! You are limited by the technology of your time yet you have come so far, and your team has made so many advancements in the world of sci-fi tech. Now you are expanding for a better future. Surely whoever you pass this industry onto will be more of a Tony Stark. As in he will have rough prototypes and blueprints of your work to majorly and drastically improve with his knowledge and skills in the future!
Nooooo don't do it
Damn, I'm crying
James: Today were going to cut our diamo-   Me: But WHY?!?!?!?!
Good video keep making more and I believe in u to keep growing
make a weapon out of the metal
At this point 14:57 its looks like iron man creating the new element
Who would dislike this video and why
Doesn’t he already have everything to be a superhero I mean In technical terms
Dude i love all of your stuff im sorry that i havnt subed till now but what would really be awesome is if you made a bicycle car that could travel at speeds of 70mph without the use of a motor
A wonderful upgrade from diamond to psychedelic!
you and your team is doing a very great great great job there.  You and your team inspiring many people around the globe. You guys are blessed. No need to hearing any negative comments.
You should make the stop axe from fortnite
That's as awesome as making miniature arc reactor love you tons huge fan and lots of Love from India
I would totally work for hacksmith industries once I'm done college
Small youtubers like me “you didn’t have to KILL it” 🤣🤣🤣
Him: the channel grew. Me: so did your beard
An Absolute Legend.
I’m gonna be able to say “I followed them when they were only at 10million subscribers”
Eyeryone : surprised to get a DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON.   Hacksmith : Burns and destroys his own DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON.

You should turn that metal in to a lightsaber hilt, it seems like it would be more stable to hold heat.
Don't care about what they say do what you know is great
Bro you are amazing, your a guy I look up to when it comes to creating anything and pushing my limits
This is the best that exists in the world, thank you, you really are the example that society needs
Bruh i like how he destroyed that lemon
How much to buy a lightsaber?
Hacksmith I challenge you to make a real hover-board! And not the drone looking board i mean a real hoverboard that can go all terrain and decent speed.
Can you make Doctor Octopus’s tentacles from the Spider-Man PS4 game?
Can someone please send this video to Jack
All 3k+ people who disliked this video, y’all are some real life haters. Hacksmith I appreciate your videos, what you do is truly amazing and most people couldn’t even do half the things you all do. Keep up the great work!
So I'm guessing the blast doors in Star Wars are composed of diamond play buttons. :-)
14:20 that's beautiful 😯 15:01 and this is amazing 💪 15:16 cool af🔥
I am from India but I like to see your video. Thank You 🙏🙏🙏 James for making this video for us,

I think the colour produced  at 14:15 was quite good than original
I love this
Holy Shit your speach and your plans are inspiring. I'm a 24 year old IT-guy who tries to figure out what he wants from life. You just made me realize that I probably should sit down and really think about a plan for my future and start working on it.  Thank you for your awesome and inspiring videos. I just found your channel, but I'm really excited to see  the fantastic work you and your team do and what you and your channel will grow into in the future.
Thank you Hacksmith for everything
This is what play buttons were built for
I guess thats what youtube wantet by sending this button
Elon Musk shuld totally hire those guys. Change my mind
That's crazy, but that is what I like about you, you go big😋😋
melt the play button and make a 10 mil sword
Was the center actually diamond? Or was it just really strong glass? Because if it didn’t melt or break at the same temperature as the metal, then it must have been insanely strong.
The people who dislike maybe saying Dis-I-Like   stay positive ☺️
Me trying to listen to his history and future. Lag be like. diiiie
Wait...  10M Subscribers =Diamond Playbutton?
E O ARUAN DO BRASIL
I am trying to make that one percent zero
Hacksmith: Cuts diamond play button. Me, who doesn’t even have one subscriber: Noooooooooooooooooooo!
Keep doing wat ur doing ur amazing person and ur team don’t let other bad comments put u down keep pushing forward 🔥🙏💪🏻
New tittle dumbest way to make a diamond play button burn!
Here’s a slogan for Hacksmith Industries: Sheer awesomeness. Pure destruction.
BEST VIDEO EVER, especially the first part. This should be watched in its entirety as your future plans is what makes the channel so inspiring.

Call the play button the “oil spill” play button
this channel is sick as hell how could u complain.
It is cool, but why? hahahaha
This is so awesome!!! Would love to see an Australian/Oceania Hacksmith facility opened in the future so those of us on the other side of the world can come together and be apart of this amazing journey with you! As someone who studied a Mechatronics Engineering degree, I live for the awesome projects that you guys create. Would love to be apart of it all!
u know those cost like 3k
A madlad who destroyed a diamond play button just for content
I really miss grant tombson
Have u ever tried doing this with titanium the most heat resilient metal there is
I like how channels like this get given a diamond play button as a way for YouTube to say, “congratulations. Have an exclusive item that’s somewhat difficult to get” and they just destroy it 😂
You guys use to make police chase videos how did you guys become this?
This is the paralel universe where Captain America is smart
Invite Letterkenny to your channel
Life hack to make your diamond play button prettier: melt it in half
Who were the three thousand idots who disliked this vides
One day, he will put a nuclear power plant in that lightsaber so that it can cut though anything like a real one. Or so i hope.
Been watching ur vids for years now
Could you make a clone commando armor with working vibro blade?
The first part made me tear ( the part when u talked abt people complaining)
A scientist of the Star Wars universe asking to his colleague:  “Hey, do you what is the hardest material in the Galaxy” “Isn’t it Quantum Crysta...” “DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON”
So you read these? PROVE IT
It seems this was very hard for you. Thank you
James. We understand thank you . Grant helped me make my first HhO generator.
When the playbutton turned orange, you just achieved a 100 mil playbutton button but its beta version
Youtube watching this be like bruh

Memento Mori James. Life is not about the end, it's about the journey, just like Unus Annus.
you best have a sewing kit so that diamond play button can be patched up
And that’s how you destroy a playbutton
Cant believe you did that but congratulations for achieving this place and goal of youtube. Thank you for inspiring content!
What a legend
the 50 million hacksmith custom playbutton will probably be made of pure titanium....
LETS CUT THE DIAMOND BUTTON THEN: LETS BUY A REAL DIAMOND
I just want to say you guys are great and I love everything you do. You guys have inspired me to want to get into school for mechanical engineering next year. Keep up the great work
Sad jacksucksatlife. Noises
I follow Hacksmith since 1st million
15th November 2030, first landing of a Starship on mars :  the starship land and the crew find a replica of the millenium falcon the team of the hacksmith get out of the falcon and congratulate the spaceX team
You're such a nice guy , from a backyard Linkin park fan , backflipper to a leader of an industry , ❤️ if you're reading my comment thank you very much from such kinda inspiration ❤️
I bet you tube be like 🤨 our dimond play button
Okay but I’d like to see more videos about one project, more videos that are more detailed. Most of the time I watch the videos in the background so just watching clips of every little bit would be interesting.
*gets an award that only a few people have.*  **Melts it.**
I want to be smart as you. Too sad my head is smaller than a pea
Its awsome all the things that you have acomplished, Every new video i see im sure about the idea that you are the real Tony Stark, a real mental hero
Seems normal to get set on fire everyday
Aruan felix 2.0
hey hacksmith, you are my greatest role model! I myself live in Germany and am 16 years old, I experiment a lot and like to build crazy things, you inspire me so much and you give me the strength and the thought that I can achieve everything in my life.   I wish you would read this .  keep doing your great stuff. I would like a video idea that you do something that you could do yourself at home, even without a lot of money and machines, you are the best youtube channel i have ever seen.
You can buy a new one from the YouTube email that they sent when you got that one. Just in case you want one
Been a sub since 1.5million. Your an inspiration to me for a while.
A diamond play button to A gold play button
I see your industry in 10 years becoming like Oscorp in spideman
I was literally crying
You are a legend! Your core beliefs on making a difference on a large scale, developing a real world plan to achieve that and achieving it, is really inspiring. If you ever need an Aussie Problem Solver/ Data Analytics Specialist, hit me up and I'll give you as much time and heart as I can spare. Keep up the good work Hacksmith and congrats on Hacksmith Industries, well done.

Hacksmith: Cuts diamond play button in half  YouTube: But why? Why would you do that?
Woooow. I got some major tears man. 🤧😭. Heartwarming stuff. Keep aspiring and your determination creates determination in others as well in all aspects of life.
only one thing I am doing and will do for you is always support you at any cost or problem because there is only one person in the world like you and you are a person what I wanted to be but I can't because I can't afford anything I wanted to make  love you 3001  our Very own Tony stark
hacksmith: casualy hits 10 milion subscribers  also blacksmith:lets destroy playbutton
So... The Hacksmith is basically telling a story about how to not give up with your goals but keep going for them? I'M IN!    began doing so myself not that long ago. Goals are there to be reached, and not to be tracked and then ignored
When the diamond triangle was glowing it reminded me of the iron man suit with the triangle thingy on his chest
I've been watching your videos for a long time and I just wanted to tell you that you're just a genius. For many years I knew I wanted to be an engineer or at least work in a technical field but I was always afraid that after school I would have to settle for an office job that I do not like and every time I see a video or project you do it encourages me a lot and makes me want to stay in engineering. I am now 26 years old and studying engineering and can’t wait to graduate and start creating and developing cool things that will help a lot of people. So thank you so much for all the hard work you put in and lots of success in the future I hope our paths cross and we can work together in the future
Other : OMG! I will keep my Diamond play button sooo safely!!!!! Hacksmith: Lets burn the fu#@ out of that Diamond play button with our light saber! :3
Wow! so cool. I cant wait until like 20 years when its possible to get it to over 20000 degrees or something
Ur beard tho ive been watching since u jumped in the air with the captain America shield
I’ve been watching since about 5 million subscribers so no I am not the worlds biggest fan who’s been watching since forever but oh my god I love this channel and how awesome the hacksmith industries is
YouTube:"sends him a diamond play button" Hacksmith:"cuts the play button" YouTube:-_-
Umm... Please do a monthly upload YouTube Channel "Cooking with the Hacksmith", where you actually do make food.   Your style is quite unique!
12:42 TF2 pyro be like:
Yeahhhh innovation signn me up
Idk if I was emagining but I swair I could hear him get emotional as he was talking about his plan and the group he's made.   I agree that what they're doing is amazing, he's made a company from the ground up and he's still making it grow, while he alone isn't "the real life Tony Stark" his team together shure as hell is.  I respect this man for the absolutely insane this they've done, literally settings themselves on fire just for a video, and how they've made stuff only thought possible in CGI or comics.  What more could you want? They're literally making fiction into reality
I watched full
Um... Sorry to interrupt, but I really do want "Cooking with the Hacksmith!" I mean, looks so cool!
Cut your beard
I have been sub since 2009
I would even watch every video if there was only one a month
All love from INDIA👍👍
So sad I cannot join you now
You are the best .I would love to team up with you in future .But I am still 14
Lesson : don't give anything to Hacksmith.
With the next lightsaber make the blade able to extend much further
You might as well split all your other play buttons in half
You are such an inspiration,I believe you will lead the next stage of technology

I WANT A LIGHTSABER
This is the true gamer nerd
Jacksuckatlife viewer: this is painful
حرق مشتركينه هههههههههه ما يفهمو صح
My only complain I ever had was that he dosn't appear much on this channel anymore. I know he has other things on his head right now but we see him for like 5s if we lucky.  Like think about Mythbusters or Tested.  They also had a big team but the main crew was always in focus, they were the host. They were the reason people watched them and subscribed.   When people complain about it, they just want to see more of you on this channel. There's nothing wrong or negative about it.
What is common between hacksmith's channel and hair/beard? Both grew and grew and grew and greww!!!
When the button was half melted, dark and damaged, it was looking like a Sith Button 😅 I would buy it 😂
Make a User sizeable infinity gauntlet
With love christian Perez

You should make a Spider-Man suit with electromagnets in the gloves and maybe even a working spider sense using sensors. Like if you want hacksmith to see my idea!
This is what every YouTube dose with the Dimond play button
YOU CHANGE THE DATE... DAMNIT WAS GOING TO SETTING MY DATE AND TIME ON MY PHONE

Where is Ian now a days??
(He’s doing some wholesome messages for us) Me: He’s a sweet guy and all but those muscles...
you destroyed the diamonb play button!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love your videos
IDEA: THORS HAMMER THAT RETURNS TO U
Those people who dislike are ugly change my mind
How did he decode what the 1000 mill subs play button would look like it even looks better that it
Video starts at 12:25
Are you going to buy a 10m play button
What metal is the play button made from if you had to guess?
I think that you guys should try to make a real life fully functioning R.I.G from Dead Space
Diamond Play Button "Why are still here,Just to suffer"
By the way I love iron man he’s my favorite superhero so I am so excited for the future
Wolverines clause
It’s was awesome seeing it blue twice
Jacksucksatlife would be so sad right now.
Make retractable clause
14:19 csgo case hardened
I think you should do Hagrids umbrella from Harry Potter
love the plan and make sure you make it reality.
Jacksucksatlife is crying right now
You should try and make a nerve gear like the one in the anime Sao(Sword Art Online) you could probably use the technology of a vr and make it like the nerve gear it is almost there but just try to make it like a nerve gear .
This is the same mentality I wish more of the world would adopt. Imagine what the world could be with more people like this guy. I genuinely feel it’s the next step in human evolution.. if you believe in that kind of stuff. Elevate our mind to work together to achieve feats we once thought impossible. Well done for creating something that the majority of the world doesn’t realise they need. Can’t wait to see what this group of people create in the future.
Thank you so much for everything you do!!! You're one of the reasons I've decided to become an Engineer. Maybe someday I'll be able to create things as cool and amazing as you guys do!!!
James with a lightsaber:- i can cut you Playbutton:- wai ~ what
BUT WHYYYYYY..........???
I don't know if this is possible. But what if you put a rod or something in the lightsaber that's resitiant to the heat so that the lightsaber is sort of solid. That would be cool to use in a duel of some sort. Don't think it'll be possible though. Love the content.
BEST VID EVER❤
Next video idea:  Recreating our diamond play button
Good shit man!
So all we need is a diamond play button to survive a light saber
12:40

the government should finance your projects
Love your videos😍💚
Jesús christ you actually exists

My armpits smell. Great video tho
If you're giving away those cards, you should take some of the metal from the play button and turn it into ingots then place ingots in the cards.
14:42 wow Now you have gold playbutton si you have ONLY 1 mil subs
A fan from Philippines🇵🇭❤️
I want to work there.

Aruan Felix LOLBrazil references
Is no one gonna talk about how strong that play button is? Like, damn that thing is the strongest award I think I've ever heard of!
You have grown alot I was here from the arc reactor.❤️
"They're still coming through... this is impossible!"
I’ve been subscribed almost from the beginning of the channel and I’ve watched 90 percent of your awesome videos
Time well spent lol. Ngl if you would have stopped when you made the button blue, I wouldn't have argued
I have a idea holding fire in your hand by using ethyl alcohol and a make shift lighter on your rist you could hold fire in your hand and a a fire prof glove in case;)
Got a great idea why don't you take the same mechanism from the light saver and put it in a glove you might be able to fly like iron man or make his  hand repolsuor
Why does he look like he is about to do a video on building an ark?? hehe
For burning this for us we should subscribe
Hey I rlly think he should make the axe that that big dude from avengers infinity war had that went up against spider man and iron man at the beginning of the movie
Will youtube ship you an another one?
I like how he said he wasn’t tony stark and then 10 seconds later he quoted him
Who actually watched the whole vid 👇 👇 👇 👇 👇
Damn bruh they made a case hardened play button given only to cs channels that hit 10m

Keep up the good work guys. What you do is completely crazy and inspire lots of people to do the same. You are an awesome team. 😁👍
12:22
Make flaming fist from game free fire
This is a good man and if you disagree you’re wrong

Hey hacksmith i am a very big naruto fan and i have a video/build idea maybe you should try to build a kunai with paper bomb if possible or other naruto weapons   like this comment if ur interested in my idea  👇
I am both a longtime fan and I want you to cut the play button in half

You guys should definitely do something from either destiny or destiny 2
That lasted longer than I expected. There must be a low thermal mass(?) in the Saber flame even though it's around 4k°C. If memory serves, the safe didn't hold up as long.
The-they made a lightsaber
Diamand play button 😭😭😭😭😭
That’s one way to make your play button cooler😅
You deserve this because I wouldn't be doing what your doing I would be making videos like a gave my highschool bully the biggest wedgie ever

I’ve only been watching since 4mil but to those real ogs you the realist
Okay so, just What was that thing made-of that it took the heat almost like it was nothing? Like cmon, that alone was pretty great to see.
Try it with Xenon or Krypton, you could hire a particle physics intern you could offer a reward if they can achieve it, might need like a halfnium-tungsten handle or some shit. Really slice and give the saber sound. Idk why its really even necessary idk sorry. Awesome saber bro.
Youtube is like wtf why is he melting his new button
que bieeeen  soy sus faan
Bird
Normal youtubers: lest hydro dip out 10 mil award Hacksmith: let’s used a lightsaber to cut it in half

I had a idea make Beyblade
Guys it’s ok they can just buy a new one from you tube
Oh yeah and S+P choice for me
Just imagine making the first flying car with huge electromagnetic wheels repealing off the earth
I haven't been subscribed for very long but have watched quite a few videos. And I can say I love and appreciate the content you guys do... partly because it's things I enjoy and the other part is because my kids love it... and that helps me encourage them to enjoy working with their own hands.
E pensar que toda essa idéia começou com o Aruan Felix...
The brain of stark, the heart of rogers. Congrats!!
I feel so happy/sad at the same time
Dont compare yourself to tony stark you have changed the world in a way that no fictional character ever can
Just so you know you can buy copies of play buttons on a website as long as  your channel meets the requirements for it I don’t know what website Specifically but just to let you know (I all so think that the one at the end were it’s purple and all that is very cool)
Oque é o aruan perto desse cara
Man you are a fantastic engineer and project manager. Business manager at that. As a ChemE student, I aspire to be half of the worker and scientist that you are dude. If they ain’t hatin, you ain’t doin it right bro. If you ever want someone new on the team let me know lol
For a cool idea U should try to build the wunderwaffe dg2 irl
He went from captain america to thor
Yall really need to invite Mark Hamill to try this out.
Congratulations 🎊🎉🎊🎊  I always waiting for your new videos 😊. Love from India.  Can I work with you. I'll be an honor 😌.
So happy you reached this milestone. Since 2018
You should make a double bladed lightsaber
Ohhh myyyyy goooooooood 😮😮😮 Why did you do that 😥😥😥
Lets think of this as a symbol of the hacksmith for their love of creating beautiful things and using it to destroy the hell out of another thing
YouTube watching this is like we just sent that to you
One Day Elon musk Will Give Your Example
I kinda wonder how YouTube feels seeing all their play buttons treated like this
If He’s the chosen one then he will be evil  Better not be the chosen one
12:12
You become a real Tony Stark soon i swear
JackSucksatLife is quaking

LIGHTSABER vs bullet proof glass
If anyone on Hacksmith sees this please make the techno trousers from Wallace and Gromit.  It is around the 25th anniversary of the Close Shave and I would love for you guys to make at least something from Wallace and Gromit.
Burning the diamond play was the best thing I EVER SAW IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!
Loved the emotion - it was pure and real. Please ignore the trolls. That's all they are, and probably exists in this world to push people like you forward to greater heights. I am sure you are already turning their negatives into a powerful positive impact in the world through you and your team's work. Great job!
Idea assassin's creed hidden blade and phantom blade
Almost 11 million subscribers!    Edit: I literally almost 😅 cracked up, not like laughing.
Youtube: congratulations on 10 million subs. We present to you a expencive diamond play button. hacksmith: we're gonna break it in half.
Hey I just want  you to know that you THE HACKSMITH you are in my prayers, you will always be in my prayers. You have done what most people couldn't imagine of doing. You have a big impact in people lives. Just 2 years ago my little brother was diagnosed with cancer. The thing that's keeps him waking up, keeping energy and happiness inside of him isn't just me and my family, it's you and I really thank you for what you have done for everyone. You aren't a normal person, your a miracle. I don't know how I will ever thank you, I don't think there is anything big enough to thank you. Keep doing what your doing for people.
lol
we need more iron man
Ur wasting it wtf
This dish looks good
12:22 is when it starts just for u to time stamp
For a minute there it looked cooler.. except, not, really. Actually molten.  It was jade and then purple and gold, iridescent. Pretty sick dude.  I wonder how YouTube feels about this.
If anybody is going to dis this guy something is wrong with you  I love your vids HackSmith Industry’s you are a great team
I’m 13 and I want to be an engineer of some sort or inventor or you know billionaire playboy philanthropist and working here when I grow up would just be my dream job
Worry not about the spectator or their opinions, opinions in the long run mean nothing, facts are the only thing that matters, for it is only those who strive & endeavor to create and thrive that have meaning.
Yo try that light savor on a real diamond

I dont honestly care if it take him a week or two weeks to make a video, every video reminds me who I am. So all the people who are hating on him, yall need to get off yalls a** and actually do something with you life. He loves the hack Smith. This is his way of doing it, this is his way of making his mark in life, so let him DO IT

Hacksmith: gets a diamond play button everyone: congratulations Hacksmith: I'm gonna cut it in half with a lightsaber! everyone: what😅
10 year old me: I'm gonna work there someday.  17 year old me getting ready to go to college: still gonna work there someday.
Gets one of YouTube’s greatests treasure hmmmmm I think I will cut it with a light saver🤣😭
The bright glow that came from the center when you finally got through was amazing. Congratulations on everything you’ve accomplished and what you’ll continue to accomplish in the future.
..after 14:00 of abuse in this video, I’m guessing it really was made of diamond..
That was AWESOME
Would it be plainly to makev the blade biter if so plz do
Make a ps5 please
Imagine forging a sword from the metal inside the play button, call it the sword of 10,000,000 followers
Noooooooooo
thanks for making vids.And also not goanna lie but Rick is a great editor. And I'm soooo glad that you made vids  because I want to be like you when I grow up.

i have one question,and its ''why''
Because We don’t have 11m subs yet   10.9m: *nervous sweating*
Congratulations. It’s been amazing watch your channel grow. Thank you
Go for it all man ur gonna go far
I feel happy cuz he wants his master plan to come true which I'm all for, but also feel a bit sad cuz legit I JUST came to know this channel existed when they did the lightsaber recently. Hacksmith obviously has bigger plans as he told us so I can't wait for the future while I look to the past for some dope ass content PS he also got a fuckin dope humor and personality fuckin rocks. Love u bro and keep up the incredible work. Also fuck the haters!
I hope one day we can all come back to this video when hacksmith has a huge business and knowing it all started right here
Cooking was the best part
enquanto o aruan pega mais de 100k de deslike o hacksmith pega mais de 100k d elikes kakaka
You know if the apocalypse ever happens this channel would be a diy channel
i love your videos
**YouTube is typing...*
Man you speach made me cry it's very motivational Keep you the good work and I hope you have fun and enjoy your self and enjoy Thanksgiving and Christmas bro I wanna make a difference in the world thanks too you :)
Hey hack smith my name is Chris I’m an 8th grader in Colorado Springs I think your content makes people they can believe that they can be more than who they are my goals are get a PHD in electrical engineering and hopefully be like you making fictional ideas and make them real to help humanity I wrote a poem and the last line says “ life is what you make it out to be.” So do you think that is true and I hope your inspiring more people like my self to help humanity so we can shape the world of tomorrow.
*youtube* : lets give the hacksmith a diamond playbutton. *Hacksith* : lets burn it!!>
Ah yes the good old hack smith we know
I cried for 40 minutes when I found out Grant was gone
Wow what a plan i can't wait to see this in 5 years.
You guys inspired me so much to make things so thank you
You guys can get a new one for 3k from the society awards official website
Ok I love your vids but y would you distroy something you have strived to achieve and plus I woched a vid on how these things are made and it's not cheep $$$😎😍
Amazing Avengers reference
THEY’RE STILL COMING THROUGH!!!
This channel, among others, is the driving force behind many young creatives. It inspires me and many others to do the same as the Hacksmith: create, innovate and better Mankind. I am grateful that channels like this exist. Your work inspires me to start my own YouTube channel. Not for the money, for the passion.
Good luck man
It still baffles me that people dislike videos like this. This video is so wholesome and well put together and transparent it’s amazing! As well as videos like TKO talking about grand how do people hit the thumbs down video? I don’t get it.
alien powerloader
I want to see a video where y’all make a full mandolorian suit

Start in 12:45
The world certainly needs more students getting into STEM subjects and careers, there is such a massive untouched pool of new ideas, talent and potential yet to be tapped.
The reason ur all here 12:39
You should make the metal that pooled out into throwing knives
Who would do this I would cry if it got a scratch
You are truly just a good guy, hope you get to live out your dreams
The funniest part is with that mask he sounds like a droid.
I hope you accomplish all you set out to do, you have the vision and drive to make it happen. Good luck, we’re rooting for you.

No entendí nada, pero estuvo bastante interesante el vídeo
Deam, the first 10 minutes are so tuching

Keep doing what your doing bro! Reach for the stars!
Now make a actual jet pack
is it just me or does it kinda look like an iron man chest piece
You guys should make the medi gun from tf2 lol
If only 1% of the audience is making lame complaints about your content I'd say you're killing it. Disregard those few entitled from the peanut gallery.  The needs, interest and gratitude of the many out weight those of the few.

Jack just polished his diamond play button

Could you imagine if he had the play button implanted in his chest
Is there any way to stabilise the blade and made make it longer
Once I get the opportunity to intern I would attempt to intern with you
...and your almost to eleven million
I've been watching since the first civil war magnetic shield video and I know that's nowhere near as long as some other people but hacksmith has really inspired me to make and create things of my own.
"1000 degree knifesaber vs playbutton"
YouTubers when get diamond play button*  other YouTubers: wow, it's looking good  hacksmith : ok, let's burning it with my light saber
12:22
Dude I didn't know grant died... he was awesome!!
Thank you
Ok ngl that deserves a like if your willing to take your achievments and saw them in 1/2. I would not be able to do the same
Do you offer summer jobs?
Imagine someone breaks into his house and he pulls out a damn lightsaber
When I saw Grant Thompson i teared up reminding me of how much of an inspiration he was to so many people
It hurts
This might just be my favorite video. I wish good luck to you on the next part of your journey and I can not wait to see phase two of you plan come true.

Hacksmith I'll always love your videos and your creativity, when I was still highschool which was actually last year I always wanted to make a hologram keyboard or hologram phones that they use in star trek and how Tony stark uses, and I believe that your creation's will help change the world, and btw I have been subscribed to you guy's for like one and a half maybe two years now. And each and everyone of you team I believe in you. I'm happy that you are trying to help the world change for the better of Humankind.
Why would u destroy ur diamond playbutton
Good luck with everything! You are doing a great job!!!
Hacksmiths manly beard gives me life
ARUAN ???
This has to be my favorite hacksmith video. Getting to know The work/time that go into making the videos. Talking about the importance of his team and a team in general was kind of refreshing.
Front flip out of tree If ykyk
Even though I've been watching since the first few videos that story still brought a tear to my eye
There are people who have been fans longer than I am, but the fact that I've been subbed since 5 mil makes me feel good
This could have been a 2 minute video
THAT THING is durable
I love how other you tubers love there play buttons and James just cut in half with a lightsaber
Your not tony a Jedi or anything like that you are just a man with a team and a dream that is what makes you my idle
Oh I just found you on my recommended and I remembered when you had 300 k and I would watch you every day after school
1:12 if you get this reference i give you all of my respect
So many people probably skipped the amazing song that he created all on his own at 1:13
Love your videos and everything you do.  If you ever need a machinist I’m your guy
Keep it up!! I enjoy the team you’ve put together.
💇‍♂️🦱✂️
soon comming up fusion powered mech suit
YouTube be like "maybe we shouldn't have sent these guys the play button"
Youtube watching every ten million sub channel destroy their play button
copiando os brasileiros kkkkkkkkkkkk
I wonder what YouTube thought when they saw this.
That costs 3000 dollars
My teacher gave an assignment about who our favorite online influence is, but also says it has to be an informational text, unless their your friend, so can we be friends?
James is the only person on earth that can say that he has cut a diamond play button in half with a lightsaber
12:22
This guy is like if Jesus was an engineer
Hi hacksmith i like ur videos. your team and you are amazing don't stop making videos 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Good job james and Thanks for mentioning grant may he rest in peace 👍
Been here since before 10k

Infernus play button
I hope you guys succeed on your plan with changing the world. It would be a better place with your ideas and inventions.
I wonder what Gordon Ramsey would say about the cooking part 😂😂😂😂😂
I cannot wait for this plan to fruition! I too want to create inventions to better mankind when I am an adult. I'm starting small right now by working on my motorized shoes project to potentially help older folks get around easier. I'm very excited to see what happens next for Hacksmith Industries.
Make this man a good life
That goal you all have is awesome and I truly believe that you all can make it real
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Think that will increase the worth of the playbutton a lot! 🤑
When it is half burned(not cut) It looks like a whole new play button u can say an emerald diamond play button
You could start a Netflix series
Thank you and your team very much and keep on going.
It seems the play button is made of Beskar.
If that was a steak I would inhale the whole thing and ps great speech😉
YouTube be like: :(
My last name is blacksmith and this channel is for me
This is the start of a main super villain and i support all of this  Jk i think your ideas are really good and id love to be apart of that physically and help make a difference
Bhai diamond play button nai chahiye toh hume dedo

Nooo diamond play baten you Cha
It’s amazing, when you’re just a viewer it really does seem like creators should be able to put out a lot of content at a constant rate. It’s only when you delve into video making that you realise what an incredible ball ache it is
I like to think that he's keeps that small play button in his pocket at all times
It was cool but u literally just destroyed a 10 million subs play button 👏👏👏👏👏
I'm from iran and I love your vids❤❤
I don't get why people are complaining. Your inventions are amazing.
Your so boring now
"you can tell it's fresh because we haven't hit 11 million subscribers yet"  Me whose there at 10.9 mill: damn it I almost had a golden comment
Awesome 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Get a haircut
Hacksmith industries in 50 years: real portable universe-splitter (MAKE IT REAL)
Btw light saber should be able to slash fast this one is so so slow in coming pls upgrade
Cool
First I felt a bit unhappy about the "destruction" of the play button. But when I saw it on the wall I really liked it. It's unique now, a piece of art.
Excellent speech great team
Been an avid fan for years. Almost since the start of the YouTube channel. Always been a promoted and spread the channel. Absolutely love what you do, how you do it and the attitude you bring it with. Please keep pushing forward and enjoy it and take those breaks. Gotta keep your head level. Thanks for what you do and the message your spread. And congratulations to you and the entire team for your accolades, you all deserve it.
😌❤️✌🏻
Way to go brother.Keep this awesome work going 👍🏻❤️
not trying sound negative but why does the campus thing sound like he's gonna retire and find a worthy person to take over the business. (like stark when he basically gives Parker the avengers) XD
You look like Jesus
YouTube HQ seeing this 👁👄👁
James, your Make It Real videos are platinum! :D I can't wait to see what you'll build next! :D
Wow that’s a really moving intro . I’ll hold my hands up, I gave you a hard time about the power loader tracks , you’re right , viewers come to expect so much . I guess we forget how hard these things are because you make them look so easy . Thank you for humbling me and giving me a reality check . I wish you all the best for your future plans . I’m sure you will achieve anything you put your mind to
yes U guys also push me back to learning as well  I admire u guys and luv u guys <3  luv from Myanmar
I'm not a big crier but you actually made me shed a tear good job and I hope you don't stop making vides

Aruan: Partiu cortar a placa de 100k.  Hacksmith:
Nobody else think this is disrespectful asf?
He changed the name!!!!
Am I the only one who thinks they should keep the play button and sell that million dollar diamond?
What do ya feel when u know that even cubans like me follow ya?🤔
the people who disliked are mad because they don't own their own lightsaber to do this type of stuff
Now he needs a new diamond play button well YouTube hopefully YouTube will give them it
Nooo poor playbutton
It looked so epic when it turned blue
Am I the only one that wants a Mark Rober Hacksmith collab?
Oh a live in Sweden
CONGRATULATIONS GUYS!!! This makes me so happy, you guys are the reason humanity did not lose hope!
Love the video. You should try to fill the cuts and cracks with something to make it look like molten lava
Make a real buster sword
it would be absurd if the 10 million members in the future became employees of hacksmith industries
Hey i just want to say that i’m french and you are the first Englich Chanel i follow. You doing a great job👍
11 million soon
Just HAD to give a thumbs up to this for the sheer pair of brass ones to destroy a YouTube award for tHe sake of your fans. 👏👏👍👍
I swear hacksmith in 10 years will make a light saber that can cut a diamond playbutton in mere seconds
Your cool ✌🏼
YouTube will delete your channel for this 😂
This was awesome. I have a question though, what do you concider the beam from your sword to be? Is it far from plasma?
Youtube be like: The f---k they doin' ova there
Doesn’t want to be tony stark but names his company hacksmith industries
That is technically a Protosaber. But still incredibly cool!
Congratulations, but what is the problem! We people can’t even start a YouTube channel, you people are destroying a plaque! Weird flex but okay.
13:10 Sounds like a B-1 clanker D:
Jacksuckatlife is so mad right now
Hey Hacksmith Industries, can you please make Titan's Sword from Shadow Fight 2 in the next video
This makes me so angry 😠 why it’s a memory why are you destroing a memory!

You and grant are one of the biggest part why I want to be a mechanical engineer
can you make a real working dragon eye from how to train your dragon pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase
In the future this man will have become the real iron man and kids see this video in school
You don't have to do this
Who is the winner of the iron man helmet
I am sorry for all the negativity you keep it up and your team you all are doing great work
This guy is Tony Stark
I've seen many comment about how the Hacksmith "SHoUlDn't HaVe cUt iN HaLf AlL TheIr hArD wOrK!!". Well, I disagree. This cut in half play button symbolizes the hacksmith channel, from their creative builds to their impossible projects. The hacksmith was known for their science and extremeness, and I see all that in this diamond play button. The fact the they used their best and most dangerous project on this diamond play buttons expresses how extreme they coudl take things. They made many projects and all these years led up to this. Also, the cut in half play button is a piece of work that only the hacksmith would make. All the other youtubers would just hang their play button on the wall and forget about it (I'm not against this). The Hacksmith has a unique channel full of unique things, making this perfect for youtube.
This video was amazing, responding to the sentimental part of the video, what you re trying to do is amazing and you have already inspired tons of people (I am studying to be a physicist and a friend of mine to be an engineer, we both were inspired by the phenomenal work you guys do)
no please why
Since beginning in watching almost every video I'm so glad this channel it's place on youtube and for you too 🤩🤟. You have done great things already . Stay strong 💪
Why won't you work with Gravity
Looks better blue
That touched my heart
This is the closest to a real life kamehameha
Those who like this video like my comment
I can tell that he was trying so hard not to cry 😢 good job man keep it up
So proud of you, Hacksmith Industries.
Feel proud of what you've achieved and the hell with the haters. You're still blessed with youth so go on and good luck buddy
Props to YouTube for making this thing tuff as hell
I’m so sorry for you loss. grant was a great guy I’m sorry he’s gone yet you have still persevered on and look where you are now 10 million great respect and thanks for listening 🙏
Why am I annoyed by the beard Edit : man it was a beautiful speech man you've been working so hard to impact to inspire
You do you obi-wan, don’t think about those trolls who are to afraid to step out into the light and do something useful
🤧😪😭😢😨
What he said about 5 minuts in that working together is how u move forward as a society is so true. That's how the work etics is in Norway as well, that’s why its so funny and wierd seeing british and american team work, hierarki is everything there, there is no team work, just bosses pissing downwards, and its so innefective. A skilled worked May have 10 times as good of an idea as an boss, and if he is free to work across different diciplins and such without having to ask the boss about every single thing, then things get way better and effective, also if there is a open dialugue between people wethever ur on the top or the bottom things just gets so much better.
Why would you do this I’m disliking idc if you’re dedicated.
LOVE THE MEANING YOU SAID IN THIS VIDEO AND LOVE EVERYTHING THE HACKSMITH INDUSTRIE AS DONE. i would love to join u in doing this but i dont have any skills like u all have and i will just be one to try and support your dreams and keep supporting you guys and cant wait to see the amazing things you make and make the limits. love everything you stand for and what you have done with this business, keep up the great work and wish i could stand with u guys and be part of your team.
You guys should totally do a 10 million sub spacial about the whole crew an do q&a from the fans about everything in the channel. I have a question for a long time: do you have health insurance for all the crazy stuff you're doing??!!??
14:29 it’s so beautiful
He looks like keanu reeves/john wick
Why did you destroy the only diamond play button youll ever get
You can du it I believe in you

I honestly enjoyed hearing you speak about your plans for the future so much. You can notice that firey passion when someone speaks about what they truly love in life and their dreams and goals is something irreplaceable and genuine. I can't wait to see what Hacksmith Industries has in store for the Future and I'm just glad I'm here for the journey
Hoje acaba de nascer o novo Aruan da internet

Congratulations James! I've been watching your videos ever since you made the first exoskeleton suit and watching you grow is an inspiration :) good luck for the future!
Could you make a floating back to the future board when to magnets hit each other if the both negative magnet so it floats
I have been watching you for not forever but a long time and I have all ways wanted to make the stuff you make but I’m to young
Y tho
Case hardened diamond play button blue gem
Thank you so much for what you do.  This channel has shown me that I really like engineering, so I wish to get into that subject and like what you did,  Change. The. World. Love your videos by the way
you can do this till the flying cars THAT YOU build  and win  a noble prize  KEEP IT UP DONT STOP  GO HACK SMITH!!!!! you will also be better than gordon ramsay
YouTube is like halp me pls
Dude a mandolorian jetpack with rocket launcher
Best YouTubed Ive ever subscribed to Watched this channel since you made the wolverine claws Hacksmith you inspired me thanks man.
I hope mrbeast partners up with him.
thats not smart lol
I don't mean to be one of those haters in the comments that you talked about, but like most of the video was your life story lol. I did actually love it though.
15:4 this acctually looks good
Youtube: *Gives Diamond Play button*  *Hacksmith cuts it in half*  Youtube: YOU WHAT?!
You are grate
Wow
I would not cook my diamond play button. much less cut it in half with a lightsaber. nice cooking tho
Such a amazing vid
You are awesome
Here is a nice comment. Keep going man!!
Trump our Biden
I am so glad you are gonna make and sell products in the future.
It was mad....
We gotta respect how he sacrificed his play button for a vid
Your story/biography inspire me a lot. I also want to make such an industries/centre in INDIA. I am currently in STD-12 , i first made my project when i was in STD-9 . As the all project and prototype maker knows that for making such thing the bigger hindrance is BUDGET.  I have to lot compromise my project due to budget . I use my whole year pocket money for my projects during my summer vacation. But one day i will definitely make something bigger and achive my dreams and one of the dream is to visit your HACKSMITH INDUSTRIES...
This is actually really cool. The color schemes on the play button created by the heat are unreal and looked better than the original thing
NO GOD PLEASE NO!
But why thought why
❤️❤️❤️
Wouldn't you be disrespecting what youtube spent their time too make for you
This takes hot knife videos to a whole new level
You guys should make the new mandalorian armor with the leftover play button material lol
You are making the future
I remember when when you were 300k. I cant believe you're finally at a ten million! I can't wait until you have twenty million! Me and my brother sometimes create cool mechanisms inspired by yours! Your amazing thank you for all your videos!
Yay we got a play button so before we hang this on the wall let's risk melting the table to cut it in half!
Lets nokia 3100 vs diamond play button:/
I ordered 10 of mini diamond play buttons because I love them.
This vid was awesome. And for those who watched the entire vid your are a big fan and for those who skip, try to watch from 0.30 to 12.22 because it is the most important part. Braking the diamond play button is just having fun.
Dude you do cool stuff !! Big Fan.  Somebody ask me what I want to be when I grow up I want to be like the Hacksmith.
10:57 That special way of sprinkling salt 😂
Hahaha he starts singing the will smith intro
Aruan 2.0
Hack smith you mostly cut out the Diamond right
You need to do Harry Potter wand!
the people who think YOU need to do every project do not understand how demanding this stuff is keep it up I have been watchin since you strapped the legal limit of rockets to your arm trying to fly like ironman (July 2016), since then there are only a handful of videos I have not seen. Since then  I have moved 1200 miles away to go to college for engineering. Hacksmith Industries helped me make this decision. Thank you so much. whether you post once a week or once a quarter I will still watch. Maybe one day I'll be an intern. You've got this
He said that they didn’t have 11 million yet but only needs 100 thousand
Next idea : Build a time machine
Don’t listen to those bad comments don’t let all the people who really are just mad at themselves bring you down
That’s sick! And I’m talking about the WHOLE video. Also u forgot the fact that you workout. We can tell!
Do we wanna talk about how much of a legend this guy is for literally giving us the time at when he cuts it (edit I subbed because of this and you should too)
Am i the only on who couldnt look at anything else except his biceps
This whole video was a lead up to kicking YouTube in the balls by destroying the play button. Ahhh amazing vid mate. Congrats on 10 Mill
Hi like if you read this pleas
cool
A huge congratulations on hitting 10M subs. You are all incredible and have worked tirelessly to keep changing the world and bring fiction into reality. If anyone tries to deny this, they have probably had a recent bang on the head. You have inspired me over the past two years that I have watched your videos and inspired me more than anyone else. Basically, thank you.
Kto od konopskiego like :D
Blyat, he want to be Elon Musk V2
14:26 now its a sapphire play button
who has been a subscriber since 2014. I have been a Hacksmith subscriber for over 6 years. That's when i was in grade 1. Thank you for inspiring me and other 10 million people.
Urology Shields

14:16 the play button low-key looks cool
You’re plan is crazy, make it real.
Beauty fighting robots fight monster
O cara tá copiando o aruan vey kjk
The next step would be to make the lightsaber longer and more compact.
I watched a lot of your vid of course being as dumb as I am I forgot to sub 😂😂
Bill hulkbuster
Make it helicopter
Why noooo
Make a play button sword
I know u can make a single bladed light saber but what about a  double bladed light saber ?
Youtube: Congrats u got diamond  play button for 10m subs. Hacksmith: Burn it down..Burn it down..
I have always wanted to do the stuff you do but I am to young and don’t have the money to do it or the skill
You should start a cooking channel
Cast something out of the outer pieces of metal
This is how you create a great thing in our world this really is cool and your plan is a great idea!
Youtube after seeing this video.  Am I a joke to you.
so inspiring dont give up bro
The action brought about by the response of self-preservation, which is natural intelligence, is instantaneous and it is also cultivated unconsciously or consciously. Similarly, we have recorded psychological preservation, the fear of not recording and the knowledge of that gives a central feeling that you must preserve yourself and from that you act.
I'm so proud and happy to be able to see you grow and you inspire me every day. I looking forward to your expansion, and I will be here forever. what ever it takes
hey u should try making Spiderman miles Morales venom gloves
Lmao video but a very real video to look up for
Thx
When are you gonna shave? You look like Captain America that hasn’t been shaved for years 😂😂     Edit: sorry if I’m being mean or not
Do you hv any software developers on your team? I am thinking about becoming a developer
when youtube dosent give u a custom playbutton
Who knew the diamond play button material was so durable?
3:55 rest in peace Grant...
He sounds like a droid from clone wars wearing that mask
Is it just me or does this guy look like thor?
Yoo complaints are normal make money
Your on a bright path, buddy. You guys will find what you guys are looking for, just keep on looking. You can do it.
Maaaaan the heart to heart was awesome and touching. I hope you guys all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing where Hacksmith industries will go ❤️
New name for the channel!!! I like it👍
I cried, I'll be completely honest, such a good speach ❤❤😭

Mind explosion
The lemon was an orange😂
You didn't skip, right?           No, I didn't  +Respect
I Love your projects man. You are just awesome. Keep going man, hats off to you man.
Commit *like*
Great Video Boss Let Them Talk All They Want You And The Team Are Great Put Out Great Content My Boy Is So Impressed By Your Videos,  Wow 10 Million What A Great Accomplishment Congratulations. 💪👏👏 BLASTERS NEXT BOSSMAN!!!
love your grit for success sir!
Hey in next video roast a chicken from the light saber
Good luck. If you're ambitious enough to have a Vision, you're dangerous enough to create an Ultron.   Over 5 years I know that you want to make the world a better place, not worse. You don't look like someone who's going to quit or be afraid.   Ok. Then you will need not only everything else you can plan and chase and *get*. You will need what can't be guaranteed. You will need more *luck* than many in history have had with the same dreams.   May nothing blow up in your face that you do not have a fire extinguisher for.   I appreciate the brazen will to boldly go where no-one has gone before anyway, despite the danger, danger you *know* of.   It might turn out okay.   And wouldn't THAT be something to see. :o
Us living in 2020 Hacksmith living in 2077
You tell them man
Steam punk themed play button ??
He is damn true about us
You are my favorite tony start
When i first saw your channel i thought you were russian
All of this means so much and I love it . I also love the beard . Keep doing what your doing and make sure what you do makes you happy other why’s you’ll get burnt out . Love you and all your stuff . Keep going the distance
Hacksmith:"Finally after all this time, we finally got our diamond play button!!!"  Also hacksmith:"all right let's destroy it"
You have no haters to look at when you have us; lovers and followers
So when will this guy be a lightsaber wielding iron man    Wait, he already is???
Wow your diamond play button is more cooler than before
JackSucksAtLife would like to know your location.
I love your vido
THE NEXT ULTIMATE PROJECT      THE DEATH STAR
You should make the chest plate for the iron man suit! 🤔😀
Jack is punching his fists in the air right now 😂
You go bro keep making! And being the hacksmith!
you do great
😭😭😭😭😭 so sad
I love you
U can tell when he started talking about Grant he held in the tears well Hacksmith Industries we all held them in.
Me sees the intro thinking “why would you do that” Hacksmith “ because the gmae has just startedor because that’s what heroes do” Cannot decide which one to do reply which is better
14:06 the play button looks so cool
Youtube: gives diamond button Hacksmith industries: burnes it Youtube: bruh
But grant Thompson unfortunately died last year I also see king of random
My life is full of happiness
Thank you for everythink
Hey don't scroll down ..   Are you serious    stop reading this     I'm not joking      Stop    Don't you dare read my name    I mean it
hi
What is that thing made of? According to wikipedia it's supposed to be made of silver plated metal, but silver wouldn't be able to hold up to those temperatures for anywhere near that long. What kind of metal is the silver plating covering? Anyway, awesome video. Love that lightsaber.
you know it costs $3000 to buy a new one of thies
Day by Day he looks more like a blacksmith
Ok, the hacksmith has finally lost it, I knew this day would come, he is now insane
just ask YouTube for the link to buy another one
Are you gana get a new 1
This makes my inner nerd so happy.  I'm cying , im literally busy so ngayon ko lang napanuodan to huhu we love u mennnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!
Can you make a double lightsaber?
Imagine if there was a zombie apocalypse and u were at the hack smith u would get to use all of there weapons to kill zombies
youtube: spend money on playbuttons everyone who gets one: lets desroy it
What if the STAR WARS actually start using his lightsaber for the movies?
Now Susan knows how it feels to be destroyed by 1 rule
ive been here since the garage
I've been wachting for a long time now and can't believe people complain about your chanel. It's crazy people thing you can do these things in less time. I'm super acited for the future of Hacksmith and know you guys will keep to inspire people like me over the whole world.
Your gona eventualy crate a real working iron man suit with edith in it
We all love you and supports you ,keep doing ur amazing videos because without you we wouldn't know how alot of fun things we know since childhood from movies and ...
nice
Plot twist: Diamond play button had a invisible light saber fighting they're lightsaber
Keep It Up Man!!!
You are so stupid to melt your own diamond play button.
Holy shyt that's thing is tough. Space X should be interested in that play button metal wow! Love Godlike yea ya ya :D
I get that it sounds cool and everything but it’d be really nice to hear the blade cutting without lightsaber sounds dubbed over it, I don’t think we’ve heard it at all so far, even if it doesn’t make any noise I think it’d make it feel a lot more real and less clickbaity. That aside this is dope my guy you guys deserve all the attention and new subscribers!
Why would u destroy it
Why must you destroy the things you worked for anikin
Hey Hacksmith can you make batcar
I didn't realized you changed the name until now
Jacksucksatlife.... Welll hahaha
12:22
Make the mandalorian armor
I feel like I am an Avenger everytime I watch your videos😁😁
3:44 made me tear up ngl ( ⚈̥̥̥̥̥́⌢⚈̥̥̥̥̥̀)
Theres a website, where you can check when you subscribed to people, i subscribed to the hacksmith 3 years ago,   and, im still here. Keep going😀
Have you done a double light saber
You should make Hacksmith Indistries outside of YouTube and sell stuff like a business.
@Jacksucks at life
⁹000⁰0
You should make a cooking with the hacksmith with all of  your projects
We cant wait to get ours definitely going to shoot it lol
How to i start a channel
one day, i will become one of them.
I'm glad I didn't skip to 12:22
*We cant loose you*    Let this message sit and wait till this makes more sense
James : has a lightsaber Youtube : hold my play button
You distroied it
This is 👏
Its not a lightsaber, so stop calling it one ffs.
Hacksmith cuts diamond playbutton   White girls: playbuttons have rights too
Cool video
I really want to see an assassins creed wrist blade build! I think that would be right up Hacksmith’s alley.
Memento mori my deer Friends memento mori also is the diamond play button made of titanium
I love it how he just got it and already tries to break it.
I had chills while hearing your speech. Keep continue pls
Why cant i have the playbutton
Why hacksmith  ?! Why You  destroy  your  playbutton   , Diamond  playbutton !?
👎
Keep going I am 13 and I want to be a engineer 👩‍💻 Thanks for inspiring me this my first video that I watched Thank you  Don’t give up
Congratulations!!! Your speech has inspired me to look at my channel differently. I look forward to seeing your master plan come to life
Why would you do that u just got it😅😅
Hacksmith: its 10mil subs. YouTube: ight here is a gift. *sends diamond play button* Hacksmith: next video, light saber vs diamond play button  YouTube: na niiii!! 😱🤦‍♂️
I'm sorry for what happened to Grant Thompson and I wish I could do what you do
You and your team can make MILLIONS by finding out an easier way to produce the lightsaber
We could use your engineering talent to mass produce low-cost, fast and ready production of disaster technologies anybody and everybody can do.
-_-
Hi! Say it back!!
Youtube: Here take this as a award for hitting 10 mil be careful with it James: Ha ha lightsaber go brrrrrrr
I love what you do but can you tone down the sound effects? I honestly want to gear what these things sound like without other sounds edited over it
Wow so cool
YouTube: Nooooooo! You can’t just cut the diamond play button, it’s an award for hitting 10 million subscri-   James: haha lightsaber go brrrrrrrrr
hi can u make bucks arm
Man you crazy xD
Destroying  play button is crazy Specially  Diamond  playbutton Stupid  idea

God bless you all and everyone in this world❤️🙏 Amen❤️🙏
YouTube mods watching this:😢
That comment is only written to support the algorythm.
😧 that play button so beautiful until..
YouTube: You won fight, but not the war...
I remember the first hacksmith video i watched. It was the batman grapple hook 4 years ago and I've watched every video since. Always been great to see the channel grow and seeing where it is today is astonishing.
I'm in 10 class And im learning physics in science. My science teacher use your video to help us for exam. And I think that video was when you build that bionic arm 😂😂
I have been watching you 2016 or even before and I can say that you have come a long way good luck with your future projects.
Bruh i've been a fan for about 2-3 years maybe even 4 years. Love the vids. Your the best❤
they should try polish is but keep all the colours
I have a challenge for hacksmith  Make a plasma torrent  Make a lightsaber which is freezing cool not hot

This gives me pain

*How To Basic Hacksmith Edition*
Your organization has impressed me and my friends and were crazy first responders so keep up the good work and I look forward to see what you come out with just ignore them negative comments and let them go back to the troll cave they belong in
Soooo they get a new one right?
What is it, dragons?
Great intro 👏....well done on 10 million 👏
The Midle Is Unbrakable... ._.
*_NICE!_* Do *_netherite_* next!:)
People today have so much to complain about online because they don't know what it's like. They just sit behind their screen doing nothing complaining about everything they find wrong with you just because it's so easy for them. I appreciate so much you did in these years and it's amazing what youtube can do. Don't let the negativity influence you because it's everywhere. You just do what you do best and you'll get there. Congratz on the 10 mill
Not a lightsaber
Try to cut a bulletproof vest
Donate to him with caution he might take over the world one day
Sooo youre telling me is that lightsaber is what made you reach 10 mill and your cutting the diamond play button with the only thing that made your channel even more popular...     How ironic...and i LIKE IT
If a robber comes they will steal this or if there is a war the goverment will call these guys
How do we know diamond play button is fresh? Because we don't have 11 million subs yet. Me: **Looks at subs count** Subs count: **10.9 million** Me: **Calming Exhales**
Sapphire play button lol
They should try to make the lightsaber as long as possible
Are you guys mad....  I don't think that YouTube will give a one more playbutton for you guys....
It's real life Hephaestus guys
You are awesome! All of you at Hacksmith industries! Live what you do, keep up the great work you are doing!
dooopee
Damascus on play button unlocked
I wish i could be an intern😊
aruan felix americano
When the diamond play button went blue I was like 🤯🤯 It looked better then the original button 14:25
👍👍👍👍👍
1:14 i thought you were gonna sing lol
This will probably end up on the Jacksucksatlife reddit
*bruh*
Hacksmith :Soooo what's the next thing to melt?
10:05, I was like oh yeaaaa!!!!!!!!!
Hey you can u tell me what happened at 8:22  Didnt think so your gonna fail
Love from india 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
@jacksucksatlife
having a lightsaber hooked up to a backpack is much cooler than having it hooked up to a wall , its like a proton pack lol
Why did you break the diamond play button? It was a reward and an achievement
Long Live Grant Thompson 🙏
This video was amazing, been following your channel for some time now and just love what you do. You and tour crew are just amazing!
I love the last part lol ☺️ I love you guys
Is it just me who thought it would like just go straight through the button
Normal youtubers after getting the diamond playbutton: thanks to all of you Hacksmith: Nah lets just burn it
hi, I love ur vids, especially the marvel ones lol, I am blown away by ur achievments, and I remember the first day of lockdown in march i was bored, so i went outube and looked up marvel. i watched ur captain america wakandan shield and i subscribed within 30 secs. I luv ur vids so much! really well done!
Youtube has left Youtube
YouTube:wastes a TON of money to make diamond then shape it it like a play button  This guy: LIGHTSABER GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
4:15 - That's a nice watchtime growth
wow u made a couston diamond play button🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
This was cool, but bought be great pain 🤣🤣
Its so weird to see a real lightsaber
Could you please shave
Literally he just destroy the diamond play button for us" hats off to you "
He made a big sacrifice
hacksmith Industries , you are my set of  favorite youtubers don't care about the haters , they do not know the hard work behind these videos
😿😿
Okay but 15 years ago I'd youtube "real lightsaber" and the only thing id get is vfx. I hoped in 15 years someone would make a close to real life one but tbh i wasn't expecting it to be a bunch of youtube crafters
"In the years 2050, hacksmith industries, teamed up with space x to redefine the space force for a greater threat. Corporate war"
you are very cool and so nice
He’s definitely the chosen one !
You deserve more than this love you 3000✌️✌️(you know this Singh)
If I do that im gonna be depression
You should make a book on your designs and leave room for others hacksmith lovers to put there notes in
the 2.6k dislikes are from youtube employees
Me years ago: it’s just a heated metal bar? That’s lame Me now: Omg they actually made it
2:29 plot twist: all the new videos are also cgi
I think 2020 gonna be start of next-level technology even tho a pandemic occured. I kinda wish there is a core destabilizer, magnetic  compressor, and a dark matter ionizer.         Yeh I dunno what I'm thinking and typing on this comment.
The diamond looked like when Tony Stark put energy in the triangle arc reactor core
@Aruan felix   Vai ter que superar kkkkkk
Pls make a hidden blase from assasins creed
Has everybody ignored the fact that he just destroyed the lemon
You're starting to be more like the person form the  first jumanji
Swede: We are 11 million now...
And maybe u should try and find crystals like the ones in star wars for a more smaller lightsaber. Y'know u could buy mines and shi loke dat idk
12:00
Oh and once u really create a bio destructive weapon pls no military giving
Hey hack smith I’m a 13 year old and I’ve always want to see movie props come to life and you were the first to do it at some point in my life I would like to meet you and build a crazy project with you. You’ve inspired me to believe that nothing is impossible.
I loved the into the song made me laugh and I love the vids
Even though the 1% is bad I am with you on everything m
Powerloader update
Now we just need a start destroyer and star fighters
😔           👍
When he had the mask on he sounded like the battle droids from starwars 😂 12:42
When I'm down I watch a Hacksmith and it brightens my day Thank for being you
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is brilliant. And I'm not at tje lightsaber bit yet.
I can say that this guy is seriously MAD!!!! WHO BURNS THEIR PLAYBUTTON?
That thing has some good heat resistance on it
The content is funny and making super great inventions
When I grow up I want to work for you🥰
why does it sound like he is on the verge of tears
Well..... That gave me goosebumps
I like your thinking
Who cried during the story?
Give this man a medal!!!!
Ur the best inventer in the history
The best type of armor in starwars is diamond playbutton
Can you do the real infinite stones out of the rest of the melted playboten, that would be really cool!
YouTube: the diamond playbutton is a symbol of your accomplishments throughout the years the hard work you’ve put ino your channel. Hacksmith: lets cut our diamond playbutton in half with a lightsaber! YouTube: am I a joke to you?
I can tell he’s quite emotional which is quite inspiring as he has been trying to do this stuff since 2013 and just wanted to make a difference. That is nice 👍 great job hack smith keep up the great hard work 🤗🥰
Absolute legend, I hope you achieve all your dreams :)
Niiiiiiiiiiice)
I was here since 2 mil
im so annoyed with myself for stopping watching you but I was there at 500k
I am happy that u got 10mln but sad that u flippn melted a diamond playbutton
Have u tried making the lasso of truth????
It's amazing,  the quality the design the way it works, everything about it is a master piece. But I can't be the only person thinking, if you can't have a sword fight with it, Its not a lightsaber 🤣 Imagine two ppl with 1 each swinging towards each other lol. No 1 wins 🤪
The first time I read it as ‘ lightsaber vs diamond play butt’ because the full thing didn’t come
You should try cook something with the lightsaber and see if that’s possible
He said will it shatter into 10 million
I really love your videos, but I want to point out that it costs $3000 when you buy it. JackMessayWelsh learned me that.
Waduhhh
This is not how your power is meant to be used Anakin 🤨
12:22
When James becomes another great person who made something great remember he used to make stuff in a garage
More extreme cosplay than new technology or inventing new things. Still cool. Just a bit too much hype.
your crazy in a cool way you destroyed your play button for a vid and you have made a ton of lightsabers don’t take this offensive
damn your deeptalk really hit me hard
Are those lightsaber sounds what it actually sounds like? Or are they just sampled? I love them either way.
Aww  diamond play button
YouTube disliked this video
That Play Button is indestructible
Melt somebody on the high ground
He sounds very emotional....... No matter what you do.... We love you 💞
The first half us so heartfelt, you can hear it in your voice. Truly incredible how far you have come! Only writing this in the hope you see it. Keep it up my friend.
Hacksmith is as the best as i have known you unbelievably make anything real to show us humans that almost everything could be real you bring courage, hardwork, knowledge, entertain our hearts you make your videos with good quality as much as possible you have a heart that even thanos can snap it of existence so keep up courage people and be yourself . From my heart to you we love you
You build cool things, just hard to watch the hype train.
Finally we have reached the era when videos with titles like this have a chance to be genuine
Those clips reminded me he didnt always look homeless 🤣 needs a trim.
11:18  Kids in Africa feeling their mouths water...     Yes, I’m going to hell lol.
Ive been  here longer than most of ur teammates lol
Your channel is so awesome. I love everything that you do. My dream is to build stuff that will change the world and you are doing just that. I'm only 15 and I have 4 more years of school left but. Someday I want to do the same stuff that you are doing. I have a dream and I know that I can make it true. Keep doing what your doing and I hope to be apart of your great plan someday.
I love tour cooking show but i love it even more then that you named sweden. Becamuse i live in sweden
Now Its Time To Built A Real Mellenuim Falcon With A Ion Engine
*Mad jacksucksatlife noises*
Great video mate , been watching this for a long long time
You are my favorite YOUTUBER
Make the light saber hottterr
You'll have everything one day. We are with you. Always.❤️
12:22
Is it just me or does the cobalt blue look a lot better than the diamond?
I usually don't wanna curse online.... But Fuck those 2.4K dislikes!!!!!! U inspired a whole generation to belive in crazy dreams, as dedication, hard work and a bunch of great teammates and bring ur dreams into reality 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 I love you 3000!!!!
You should get real diamond and hit with the light saber
Hey hacksmith you gotta worry bout the non fans . I really liked your 18 min lightsaber video . And I can understand the 8 months of hard work you put into it.. its tough, but I think your doing a freaking great job man keep it up!
Hacksmith you are awesome !!!
I aspire to have that mans beard
YouTube must be mad😂
Look man, I don’t know if you will ever see this.... However, if you do I just hope you have a great day, because every upload you post brightens up my day a little bit. I know the negative comments can hurt, but please don’t take them too close to your heart. YOU are amazing, what you have built – starting small with only a tiny garage and a dream – and the community and business you have grown... It’s truly inspiring, and your spirit has encouraged hundreds, if not thousands of others to pursue their dreams.  Don’t let the negativity dissuade you, because look at all what you have achieved and brought together. I know no one knows exactly what that means, and what it’s like to be you but lions don’t lose sleep over the opinions of sheep, right?  Please just keep being the amazing person you are; the person who sees and creates things that we could only imagine as fiction, innovative tech and ideas, and a dream. It all begins with a dream. Keep daring to explore and grow, I know your fans will be happy to watch and enjoy your progress and development in your future endeavours. Whatever that might be! Just look at Jojo! You can be anything, I truly believe that :)
It's nice getting this level of insight into the business side of youtube content creation. It's really a good motivator for me, and hopefully a lot of other people. Good job guys!
You know what would be cool if you make a full suit of mandolorian armour not the jet pack or maybe but just the suit with its flamethrower and grapple and its knife that would be cool

You should make a playbutton dagger

No way there is actually people complaining about you having a team and not doing stuff yourself
stupid
Kayappu allathenth👩‍🦼
Hacksmith industries inspires me
👍
He only put this video out yesterday and now he's nearly at 11mil
That blue color that the play button turned was super cool.
Sir you should not have ruined your achievement's mark😅 But you will achieve more but next I would suggest not to break it But it was much more pretty before and  it's pretty now too😅😅
😠😠😠😡
I show my friend your ghost rider video and they freak out cause they thought your head burning
Transforming a Diamond Play Button into a Case Hardened Play Button
Now to test if u can cut someone in half with

Why tho like why
your 14 years work reward has gone 😭😭😭
You do what everyone dreams off: Improving the world by making science fiction stuff real! I have a lot of respect for you! Keep it up!
Blue Diamond play button :D
Keep making new upgraded versions of the lightsaber
i am form the future 10 years from now They will fly with a FULL iron man suit With a 10000 Digree C light saber that dose not have a back pack and will cut an outdated mech in half
0:15 Let's find oot
Not cool Playbuttons doesn't deserve that
Someone start a petition to remove dislikes
Always filmed in such a way that you cant tell it's only two feet long and looks nothing like a lightsaber.
Hacksmith industries, more like The Avengers.
I've watched you for many years and you have indeed made me more interested in becoming an engineer. And take a break when you feel like it.
You should try to make som climate change evolutonary inventions. Really good vid!
It’s cool to see the transformation since 100k I Think I started watching when the Hacksmith had around 90K.
Next video: WE FU#*ING CHOPED OFF OUR OWN ARMS AND REPLACED THEM WITH BUCKYS METAL ONE
YouTube : This guy are so cool let send them some trophy  Hack Smith : This trophy so cool let cut it down with light saber.
Hacksmith:GUYS LETS DESTROY THE PLAY BUTTON Subscribers:yayayayyayayayayayayyayayayayayayya people who care:no don’t do it it cost 1T
4:43 ah of course the line from avengers or somethin i forgot XD but still keep up the good work!
I bet a play button would survive Reentry
i wish you acheive your goals
shoutout to Grant, Thanks man
12:22
This is so inspiring
To be honest, when I thought about it for a second, this just shows how low people can go. The play button is given as a gift, a token of achievement, something to appreciate and reward the creators for their work. And then it is taken and destroyed so that you can get views.
youtube gonna be like: bruh
you make me so happy every time
I want to join your team when I’m old enough I’m 14 years old and am really interested in your creations and try to create my own as a hobby
Hey try to install your light saber in to your iron man gauntlet it work pretty awesome and the epic project of yours.❤️
Regretting after broke those shi*
Congrats on 10 mil glad I was a part of it
Cutting the play button in half did not disappoint. You guys are living my specific childhood dream of making things from video games and movies real. My goal is to make a power armor suit from fallout someday so I got dibs on that. You can take the exosuits but power armor’s mine!
<3
Next video: sacrificing children with a lightsaber
14:16 what a colour man...you could have kept a Blue playbutton...looks awesome xD
Bruh
Omg whyyyyy??????
I have a question y the heck did the play button start changing color
iam subscribe this channel when he was alone, and just have 50k subscriber, and then now, he can make the entire iron man custome We love that
So excited to see the next steps of Hacksmith Industries put into action
Hack smith, you should live stream builds that take a long time to build because that would be very enjoyable to watch.
Nooooooo
It's so crazy
Gordon Ramsay should cook a roasted diamond play button
POWERLOADER
Just be you and don't worry about the 1% i love your content and just keep doing what you love
I wanna see ur friends cut something with ur lightsaber
I started off mad that you would destroy something that symbolises the success that so many are working hard to achieve. Then you helped me understand the story of yourself and your team. Now I’m left with all the excuses that i made to myself, the reasons why i haven’t tried myself yet.  Make the plan happen, we need that future. Make. It. Real.
I WANT YOU TO MACK A SPIDER MAN  SUIT
The action starts at 12:50 and you're welcome. like damn it's annoying when people make vids like these 30 minutes and then don't get to the point until 28 minutes in 😩
I Want Ruhe Play Button
I got recommended this.
Jacksucksatlife RN 🤣🤣

You are Insane Hacksmith, but we all love you that I will surely pursue my career by keeping you as my Inspiration and a goal to achieve in my Short but Impactful Life
Youtube be like: BRUH
12:22
YouTube needs to give them another play button.
Who's here after unus aunnus...  Momento mori
I wonder who dislikes it...
People who skipped to 12:22 are impatient losers.
How do I be a part of hacksmith industries
Jacksucksatlife wouldn't be happy 😂
Well done guys. Wishing you all the best on the next 5 years
Germany supports you 🥰
It’s cool how it turned blue so it’s like an actual diamond play button
I have been seeing you since you made your first exoskeleton
The year 2030 - the Hacksmith is able to recreate Warp Drive from Star Trek. The year 2050 - the Hacksmith make a breakthrough. They test Spore Drive successfully.
I love this channel but you cant expect everyone like your videos just because you worked hard on it some didnt like a part of the video, they feel like It is borring or they are simply idiots. Dont think I am a hater because i am not<3
Don't ever stop, Grant may be gone but a pieces of what he started continues with you and what you have done is go above and beyond can't wait to see where you go in these next 5 years
I feel so sad abt ur diamd playbutton better not do that with red diamond play button u will get in future.
Memento Mori
He sounded like a battle droid from the clone wars show with that mask on
Turn it in to a shield with the diamond in the center!!!!!
Why would someone do this???????
They could've jus made their own Diamond Play Button...
I am crying it was so good
Ciekawe kto od konopskiego

When you realize your watching a great industry evolve slowly by the week and soon it will expand into a well known brand around the world
Do you guys really read these comments?
U need to do a sentry form tf2
I understood that reference.
@jacksucksatlife
It's so cool! 😂🙏
It's always those who make the less that criticise the most so ignore those idiots and keep on doing those marvels you're doing 😁
Man dont mind bad feedbacks what you are doing is awsome and keep doing that
i dont think that was the real diamond play button because you can't get a fresh one back
Congrats on 10 million subscribers
Your work is brilliant people who say there's something wrong about one of your projects they don't know how hard it is to create something amazing like you keep up the good work your one of my favourite youtubers
The Cooking Show was super 👍🤣
Those haters are kinda sus ,I am gonna vote em out
I love you guys, I cant wait to see this master plan come through!!
Could you cut all of your facial hair at the 100M please
yourcool@hacksmith
I don't cry at anything but this hit different. James keep doing what you're doing.
You get 100000 a day
Like the comment if you remember when the channel was called The Hacksmith
Wha-
I was waching you since the start
I am an industrial designer student in Indonesia and your videos has been such a HUGE inspiration for me since years ago. Your channel is why I decided to major on Industrial Design. I'm not good at math, I'm not good at physics, but I can certainly help making products with other people that excels in their own skills. You are right, we can't do it alone. at some point, we have to do it together, as a social human being we are. Thank you and I hope you and your team can make it to the biggest goal of Hacksmith Industries ❤️
I can only imagine YouTube HQ watching this with a surprised Pikachu face.
A family heirloom
If only storm troopers made their armor out of 10 million subscriber play buttons
The lemon part is such a flex I love it
can you do falcon wings next
Aruan Félix be like
Remember, there are always people going through worse than you
Good speech bro
Fantastic!!!!
❤️
Wish I could even have a silver play button...
This is incredible... Your plans really amaze me, you've inspired so many people, and shown the real versitality of engineering. I look forward to seeing hacksmith industries grow.  On a side note, did not expect you to melt the play button with a lightsaber. Well, actually, that's exactly what I would have expected. 😂
People should do the stuff themselves that they want you to do. U r amazing
I wish YouTube had a play button for over 20 million subs
You guys are crazy🤣🤣🤣, I does seems that is looks better than usual.   I hope you grow so big that there will be a hacksmith in the Netherlands, but please do it within 2.5 years because then I am going to the university.   Kind regards,
I can only imagine if Hacksmith somehow collabs with Mr.Beast
Hello
I love how the play button changes color and the diamond starts glowing. This is downright awesome
My man i don't know if you're going to read this but i'v been subscribed to this channel for several years and i swear that opening statement made me tear up........
I zoned out then snapped out of it when he said he set himself on fire and went wait wut this channel is super dope and I subscribed
Ill be real here.... I found this channel by accident because of a typo about a year ago, and have watched every upload since i have no talent and no experience but this inspired me to maybe not even do this but to do something more important then chase clout and money and all of the meaning less stuff in the world and do something that actually deserves a "well done". Thank you! I think youtube needs more people like u who do it for something bogger instead of clout
Y’all should build another lightsaber and duel
Idk man don’t think Gordon would approve of this dish
Haha all of the dislikes are from the YouTube employees that made the play button.
ive watched your vids for 2 years
Why
YouTube must be angry 🤣🤣😂😂 on seeing his play button fate
your projects are amazing plasma lightsaber was amazing and all your other
You deserves 10 million subscribers. Can you make the blaster from mandalorien?
Poor diamond play button
And the new name is good to
Minecraft youtuber jelly has more subs than you
New Dubs: The Cooksmith
When the diamond playbutton turned blue it was so satisfying and looked way more cooler then how it suppose to look!
This made me extremely emotional made me wanna cry just a little. You guys are the best and I love what you’re doing and pay no attention to the haters cuz they’ll always be there and they are nothing but ppl who are jealous of what u are doing. Keep up the work can’t wait to see what u do next and in the next 5-10 years.
The hacksmith is basically Tony stark  He even has an iron man suit
Youtube: WTH Man?! Actually that makes sense...
I love the idea of melting the play button it shows that you don’t want to be like everyone else and it shows that it doesn’t represent the channel
Just waiting for the new Weapon you will cast out of the Playbutton
:) you guys are the best
Why buth why 😂😂😂😂
I thought you always had 10 mil
Do a video on you background story
Hey Hacksmith! Why don’t you use the play buttons remaining metal to build a Mandalorian helmet.
Keep doing what you  do love the content. I believe that you are a true path of the real tony stark and those that complain have nothing better to do. Always have my attention and prayers.
Thx for giving some of ur personal life, it really let's me as a fan see that ur not just awesome in ur videos but u r in real life. Thx for being real and hope u continue. Love ur content, always know that you'll have me as a fan. Thax for being you.

In all honesty watching this i appreciate the content. Keep it going and dont stop
Diamond play button: I am the most precious thing a youtuber could have.  Hacksmith: haha lightsaber go bzzzzz
God bless you and your team
You are cool
Now do lightsaber vs unbreakable box
2050 news headline. Hacksmith industries complete first step towards permanent colonisation of the moon.
Hey man I don't know if you'll ever see this comment. But to give you a bit of clarity and story, in star wars lore before the jedi and sith there were the je'daii. Practitioners in both sides of the force they used ordinary weapons embedded with the power of the foce. It wasn't until later in their history they would discover the lightsaber, but oddly enough the first one was actually hooked up with a set very similar to what you and your team have built. Just thought you would like to know that
Wiseman once said Diamond is unbreakable
Best video on this channel or even 99% of all channels tbh, an no not talking about the play button cutting part of the video, love the ideas the effort an the goals, cant wait to see where hacksmith goes in the world as a whole!
We want a video where you cut silver and diamond play button and one day you can cut ruby play button
Stay safe stay happy stay blessed👏🏻

The idea was to bring a remarkable group of people together......   To me it sounds like the Hacksmith avengers are assembled
You should make a gravity hammer from halo
1:06 I JUST WANTED HIM TO SAY THAT I AM "IRON MAN"
You sir are not only an inspiration to creators. You are an inspiration to the world and a bloody amazing example of a how everyone should be.  That was such a nice video and it in some way allowed me to understand and get to know you better. Keep chasing your dreams.  You sir. Are a true legend.

2,400 people disliked because they wanted “tO sEe A REaL LiGhtSaBer”
I first saw this channel when I'm browsing and finding good content video then I see this beautiful inventions or prototype that I only see on scifi movies or comics and it really makes me think on what can a human achieve if we just work together. I always watch your videos and wish I could create my own invention someday and contribute to the society to make a difference. Your channel gives me inspiration hope you continue to make more cool inventions and other scifi stuff and it make it real hope I could visit your campus someday.
You're my favorite youtuber! I'm so sorry you have to deal with some negative comments that you don't deserve. Great work on 10 mil!!!!!
Hacksmit your the future of teahconlogi
years from now he is gonna make one without a battery pack
He’s almost at 11mill
Now make a new one
I love how they are just like hey wanna possibly destroy the award for our biggest subscriber accomplishment
You really inspire everyone. You inspired my inner engineer to come out and today what ever I do is because of seeing your video and getting inspired. Thank you
I was here at the beginning my favorite videos were making it real Iron Man suit. I love your content man. I hope you have a great day.
Thank you so much for making videos for us!
Congrats on 10 million subscribers Also a cooking show sounds great.

“opal play button “
5 years later: Breaking news! Real life iron man creates campus to educate more aspiring creators! Will they invent things like a fully retractable lightsaber? Yes! Will there be an increase in the amount of people that join? Yes! Will the hacksmith team retire? No, they dont think they will!
When your living that life that you can melt one of the greatest milestones of your career
Its a prize how can u do that?
"Wow, a massive diamond! Let's blow it up with a lightsaber!"
Amazing !
Doest anyone else just stare at his muscles while he talks?
Jealousy Inducer... umm I meant "INSPIRING”!
I love your videos man don’t stress to hard
No not the play button 😧
I've been watching this channel since I was little. This channel has really inspired me as much or even more than grant thompson. I used to make cool and random stuff because I wanted to be like the Hacksmith when I grow up, but unfortunately due to school and lack of money, I stopped making inventions of my own. But because of the coronavirus I got more time to do more fun stuff than ever, and since we've moved out of the city to the countryside this year I've got plenty of space that I can work on. I know it's a long shot but if you're Reading this, I just want to say thank you for inspiring me and others for many years and for the many years to come. Maybe I'll even Open a channel and follow your path, hehe. Anyway this has gotten too long than I intended it to be. From your biggest fan in the Philippines 🇵🇭
is the diamond play button actually made from diamonds?
Play button turned into dark side...
Doing everything by yourself and posting once every week? Meanwhile some people are just struggling to turn in school projects in a week? Yeah... that doesn't sound very realistic to do everything by yourself in a week without going crazy.
12:22
Can you destroy hey clay are they with a light saber
Indian Hacksmith fans🤩
12:43 you’re welcome. My services cost 1 like.
Build a dominator from psycho pass
Keep it up bro
When you realise a diamond play button -not made from real diamonds, is more effective at blocking a lightsaber then stormtrooper armor.
Good luck on your master plan and remember that we will always be there to support you :)
I love your content
Are you going to do another episode with gravity industry it's been awhile are you still going through your training
Who cry 😢 😭

I’m sorry about that 1 percent and I hope you know I appreciate you and the team the patron thank you who else makes light sabers!!!!!! I hope you know that that 1 percent are probably going through something and are sad or mad or just not raised right so I hope you know that
Don't change man ur so cool one day when I grow up I'm gonna build something cool like you do
Please tell me that they bought a new one

They not destroyed it, but they make it unique with their style. Just like customizing play button of other youtubers
Yooo u should create your own super car with your own design that would be awesome!!!!
What is that made of? Some titanium alloy? It took like 4 minutes to start melting it, and that flame is capable of cutting steel like butter.

You guys should build a set of Mandalorian armor.
Well this is probably ª first
Youtube: *Sends them something nice for getting so far up* This guy: *Cuts in half* Youtube: *Two eyed Mike Wazowski meme*
This Is Probably A Stupid Idea But The Orange diamond Playbutton  if you  Made It Glow Blue It Would Look like Tony starks Arc Reactor
The haters are don't decided what you became in future
I love this channel and I can’t wait to see the amazing things you guys make in the future .
I love this. Keep it up!
I don't know who skipped to the lightsaber part but they missed out 🔥🔥🔥
lightsaber vs captain america shield please bro
I love the avengers reference
Your the best bro .
Holy shit I found Jesus
congratulations on ten million subscribers to the hack smith
Omg that plasma light saber is so cool 😍
You have another right
"Hacksmith university" id go there if that were a uni
I love how he makes a very important award and treats it like it doesn't matter
Well to be honest you guys are the reason I developed a love for engineering
Send this to JackSucksAtLife
EDC items made by hacksmith industries is something I am interested in. I will be a customer of yours as I believe in you and your company.
I love your video
That you make
I like dumb but entertaining and fun things
I almost died watching this
I think it's kind of suspicious that it has become a diamond color once it was heated by the light saber
Hi
Heyy i can help you make a real hover board pin this if you see this
Anybody who complains about what these people do know nothing about engineering.
At the start i was thinking that sounds like the theme to fresh prince of bel air
You are cool thank you for that
12:53 he is speaking like Squidward
Your success is well earned and well deserved. Big respect to you and your team for everything you have given us.
Diamond play button receipe is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Congrats on your current sucess and more to come. This is an idea for you guys  Can you make kamen rider faiz gear but the weapons actually do damage? For those who dont know what kamen rider is it’s basically like power rangers but only one main character and there is always a new season/ version of kamen rider every year and is  popular in japan. The one im talking about in particular is faiz or 555.
It’s cool to see that you’re actually a really awesome dude and are compassionate
12:23
We will support you in all situations love from India ♥️💕
He did it for the boys and with the boys💯
May grant rest in peace
Just gonna say I ordered a piece before you even cut through the button! Some part of me was thinking that they were all already gone 😂Super excited!
Im a newer fan and I just gotta say, you’re inspiring man. I can’t wait to see how you impact the world. It’s great to see people like you actually out there, doing and not just talking. Keep up the amazing work.
I remember back when they were worried about setting his barn on fire, and now he's setting himself on fire on a daily basis. Congrats Hacksmith team <3
Suscribete
to demonstrate the power of flex tape i cut this diamond play button in half
Poroto saber*
Love from India
“You where the chosen one, you were supposed to destroy the sith not join them”  I got a strong vibe from this video that he is the chosen one
YouTube🎉👻📷 Is typing...
Congrats man
Skip to 12:24 to get to the content
I like how streamers complain about how hard it is to turn on a camera and just talk while collecting donations from simps and meanwhile all of the you tubers are hard at work on their projects and editing and scripts and making excellent content that takes month’s and even years to produce
You’re the best thank you for being here One day I wish to work with you guys
that is a lot of damage lets see if we can repair it with flex tape
Black panther
man its been so long and ive been here since the first iron man project when you were using the little model rockets on your arms to try and fly l
Just another 10 years billionaires will be able to have their own real lightsaber. In 20, everyone will be able to own one
You should set up a university for engineering and stem in your campus. If you did I would study there when I graduate in a year and a bit
This is making me sad you literally destroyed a great milestone why James why
Dang dude, your burning 10mil diamond button, and i can barely 50subs, but im happy with my 43 subs, ok i go watch other vids, bye
Hacksmith: *remakes fresh prince of Bella air intro*  YouTube demonetization: hello there
Youtube:am I a joke to you?
Congratulations sir you just found the arc reactor
Cutting starts at 12:45
You dropped this 👑👑👑
Could you make a channel sharing your subscribers inventions?
Irl Star Wars, here we come!
you know what would be cool in the future you could build a whole working iron man suit that can like fly. that would be really cool. love your vids
Why wood you do that?
For Americans the mini play button is $19.00 USD and for Canadians it’s $24.99 CAD
Man I should’ve been given a cry warning and just skipped to 12:22😭 amazing video and amazing work. Congratulations to everyone at Hacksmith Industry. You guys are the best
What the hell is that play button made out of?
Youtube: Congrats on 10mil subs! Here is a DIAMOND play button to celebrate!  Hacksmith: *Melts it*  Youtube: ಠ_ಠ
I love you guys at Hacksmith Industries, and it would make me really happy to see you make Mario Sunshine's FLUDD with the squirt nozzle
todo el mundo aqui habla ingles y soy el unico, (pienso yo)que habla español, por cierto, i think you are a real tony stark, but in a scale too little
Can the next video be. Lightsaber VS Hacksmiths beard.
(Note: Call me crazy) Is it just me, or are we living in a Star Wars universe before the war?
Hacksmith: explains his history and thanks us  Me: aww thats sweet,now cut the hekkin thing
Sir please take me in ur team I have a great plan please
Who really liked the fresh prince references
Basically just 1000 degree knife
Heart warming and amazing! keep doing amazing stuff and make a difference like your already doing!
I love  You're speech
The 2.4k frags who dislike this vid is heartless and wouldn’t succeed in life. They is literally no point disliking anyone video
He put too much lemon and salt on the play button!!!!
I started this video when he had 10.8m then left for about 2 hours and now he has 10.9 😮😮😮
I love everything that you doing  I want to do the same thing As you
I'll always remember Grant Thompson.
you put your own spin on your diamond play button. I truly hope you influence the world with your science and innovation, who knows maybe I can be a super hero with your technology.
Youtube: Gives 10mil play button Hacksmith: LETS CUT IT IN HALF Youtube: Wait you werent suppose to do that
How many of you skip to the main part?😂😂
Thanks a lot for sharing your story. It was very inspirational how you managed everything in your life. Also, yes, Grant was, is, and will continue to be amazing, even though he is not among us.  BTW, I love the amazing team and the amazing work they do. And while I actually noticed you weren't doing many projects by yourself anymore, I realized you were tackling the far more challenging task of management. I really love what this channel has grown to be. Keep it up!
But why 😭😭😭 that poor button
Hey I love you keep doing ur thing
13:00
Atleast I know what to build my armor out of now
Why bro why why
People say that u need to handle the criticism but sometimes it’s just too much fans need to learn to respect their idols choices sometimes I wonder if I’m in the right
The stupid person cut the diamond play Botton
That was not the real thing was it he worked so hard to get it
YouTubers: Thank you for 10 million subscribers *hangs diamond play button on wall* -The Hacksmith- HackSmith Industries: Thank you  for 10  million subscribers *Roasts diamond play button then proceed to cut in half with a lightsaber before hanging on wall*
I still can’t believe that there is a real lightsaber. And how long has it been like almost two months right. Maybe longer?
I swear if I see somebody say, Well now you don't have a play buttom. You do know that you can buy them right
Biggest Question here is will youtube give them another diamond play button.
send this man another one
Next up: real life portal gun please!
Imagine disliking this video after him becoming extremely successful he achieved his dream im glad to see this man keep going
But why why would you do that
I can imagine a future where exoskeletons and other sci fi tech are interested into our every day life and Hacksmith Industries is on top of it all, also keep the hair, you look good Chief 👍
Just you wait tell my man makes a light saber with no back pack
This is were the fun begins  Cant wait for other projects james
Grant Thomson was my favorite YouTuber I was devastated when I heard that he had passed im glad that another YouTuber that I look up to looked up to the same person I did
Youtube be like: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT. THE DISRESPECT.
What a journey. My favorite builds are; the retractable Captain America shield, the Predator helmet with different vision types, and Reinhardt's hammer from Overwatch.
Hi hacks miah I watched the whole video and I also wish that people would stop hating and help you out.  (Almost 11 million!!!)
I truly enjoy your content and the projects you and your team build. I hope all goes great with the Master Plan and May the Force Be with You.
Yoooo, wanna come to America? We would welcome you with open arms, firearms, welcomed with smiles, you could stay for a while, and a lot less taxes, and maybe build self correcting throwing axes... I kinda like that Idea actually...
You should make the mandolorian rocket backpack
was there an actual diamond in it?
@youtube rn 😱😱😱
To the 2.4 thousand people who disliked this video, you have been stripped of your rights
but why doe
the thought of cooking all of sweeden
Some adults might want to learn the things you do as well. They just might feel it's too late.
Pls cut ur hair
Dang bro, that whole vid just hit different
Sir love from INDIA. Keep going like that 😊😍🙂☺️ we are with you 🙏🙏👍👍
I guest the Millennium Falcon is next hahahahaha😁😁😁
Please cut your hair at 11 mil
Keep up the good work man! I’m 15 and I’ve been watching your channel since I was nine you have truly inspired me. I would be blessed if I become even half the engineer you are.
Bro can u make or built a hover board
15:04 the play button of sauron
but who said you can make tony stark and be him
Is it just me or does the 14:30 play button look better then the normal diamond play button
It looks so cool when it turned into a blueish colur
That looked glorious. Shame it didn't stay that nice shade of blue
Skip to 13:00 for video content described in title
Happy Noises*
I think that's actually a beskar steel play button from the look of things.
lol at the time of watching the video u had 10.9 milli subs XD
Hi
New challenge for you guys making real life Mandalorian armor that not even the lightsaber can cut through
Watching this made me cry inside.
Esse cara é um gênio, é fantástico. Eu queria ter o intelecto dele mano 👏🏾
Your true fans appreciate your work and a great thank you for you to entertain and inspire us.
I am talking to everyone at Hacksmith Industries you guys are awesome you have inspired me to do some creative stuff even though it is simple. I didn’t write this for likes, I wrote this to say congratulations to your success guys keep doing what you do and keep making it real. Also I imagine you guys are working hard on it and like you said it takes months but I hope you are still working on the power loader :3
Hey Hacksmith u guys are great the fact that u made a lightsaber AWESOME! I have a suggestion for a future video try making the lightsaber blade longger
In my head ur team and u are the best engineer keep it up ur history
can i work for you when im 21 yrs old
You a G for giving us the timestamp
I’m 13 I wanna be on the team  You inspire me
LITerally the only people that would do this since they are the only people to own a lightsaber. (Sorry for the pun)
Man I was watching your content from the beginning it’s crazy that we are already here
Was going to just watch the cutting of a diamond play button, watched all the way through for the great messages in the video. Thanks for all you do.
Reddit said it would happen! All hail Reddit hivemind!
In this episode of the hacksmith James shows you how to customize your diamond play button!!!     Disclaimer: DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME
Take a break all of yals
Vlog?
Hey Mr. Hacksmith. I would just like to say that I and tens of millions are amazed by what you have done. I think it’s really important for you to know that the only people that put up these unrealistic expectations are children. And obviously it’s not their fault. Their sense of reality hasn’t caught up to their imagination and so they expect things like an iron man suit to happen just like in the movies. Just keep this in mind as you read comments here. But people like me, teenagers and adults alike, are blown away. After years of being subscribed, I jumped out of my bed and showed everyone in my house your lightsaber video. That’s the same way that most of us admire to Hacksmith Industries’ work. So take negative feedback with a grain of salt because many 4 year olds that can type and have seen a bunch of movies have access to this website
Dude you do an awesome job, I'ts so great that you're Canadian and im so proud of that. Lotta support and love from Alberta. Cheers.
When he quoted the MCU i immediately switched the video to the TV
Dude those jerks are just dumb, they mad that there is someone that can make the chromosomes coware in fear
Congreats for the Channel and your achiviments
Honestly your videos are really good and I know its hard dealing with people judging and I don't understand why people do it keep up 👍
Fun starts at 12:40
U did the cgi light saber when I was born
y’all ever seen those “superheroes in the future” magazines in elementary school? these guys are the beginning.
I loved watching this channel grow and will try to see if there is a spot open once i finish collage
Can you make a hacksmith jr
DISCLAIMER: all saber noises are real. No editing
10:38 you're getting there !!! Love your videos man.. The people you work with are the best !!! And you guys will succeed in you milestones...😀😀!!
sorry im late but your awasome don't let the negitive get to you
Why.
We love you
You've done great work. I hope your plan works out, but please; don't follow the other tech giants by going over to the "dark side."  Be different; be for individual freedom and opportunity like you have enjoyed, not for suppression and oppression straight out of George Orwell.
Your making our nerd dreams come true
Your channel is the best thing in YouTube!
The balls of this guy!
Noooooooo yt plzzzz send another one 🙏
Fun fact: There are chapters in YouTube videos and if you click the name of the chapter you can pick where to watch to skip the stuff you don't want to watch
Bruh
hacksmith :wow we just got a super expinse diamond play button hmm LETS CUT IT WITH A LIGHTSABER   everyone else: what 0.0
YouTube: *"I give you this, and you do WHAT to it?"*
I just wanna say as a normal consumer  of your content I dont want to see you guys burn yourself out I'm happier with a video everyone and a while rather than none at all because you get burnt out much live for you guys
You should collaborate with Jerryrigeverthing.
"Hey YouTube, can I get a second play button?" "...why?" "I cut the first one in half with a lightsaber for a video." "That's the content we pay you for, fuck yeah!"
For all you robbers out there, don't try and rob this place. unless you want to go against a jedi
That's a perfectly-altered button for this channel! I still have an invention to give you. I've come pretty far on it.
What ever you do I'll watch it man! Great work!
For some reason, I thought I already subscribed, but didn’t...    *boop*   NOW I’m subscribed!
Astop adding sound effects it makes less realistic
JackSucksAtLife is crying right now.
Beautiful absolutely amazing 😗👌 delicious
I have been watching since 2k subs
Congrats on ten million
How stupid are people to think that they face zero stress.... They, our ideals, when share such things, inspire us... (Me, at least). You have achieved something that is just a dream or a stupid idea for most people, and you will,... No.... You HAVE TO ACHIEVE MORE! WISH YOU BEST, Mr. HACKSMITH ❤️❤️
I can’t wait to see this grow and am excited to see what the future holds
Hi hacksmith love your vids
12:22
Did you get copyrighted for the Fresh Prince song?
Ita okay man, you yourself, are a change for this world, your single existance helps many people feel encouraged and strive harder to work harder everyday, its alright if there is something holding you back, we, your fans, your family, are here for you. Much love man
This is such a heart warming Intro I love it keep going man ur really good at this stuff
Wait, y'all have a real light saber?  You just got 10,000,001 subscribers.
Scientist: it’s impossible to create a lightsaber   Hacksmith: are you sure about that
make it into mini play buttons
Wait no melt it all and make a sword
He has a point
I would have stopped about half way through it would have looked so cool
Thank You
I was a old viewer! I'm impressed how this channel has grown!! 2006-2020  It's just amazing. Can't believe that this channel has improved by A LOT  Well, that's all I have to say. Stay safe!
Stop that play bottom shows u where u are now so stop and be thankful, and look at it and say wow I got here instead!!!!!!!
Content Creators do not do this to your diamond play button..... endless you have a lightsaber
It’s only a matter a time until The governments in the world seek out a lightsaber
When are you going to announce the winner in the         giveaway
That was amazing man !!! keep it up!! 🤘🏻
People just don’t understand how many people it takes to make something beyond belief like the lightsaber
I cook playbuttons in the oven aswell
Here at 20k
Nobody- Literally nobody- Hacksmith- cutting my one and only diamond play button and ruining it Me- but why
Thank you for all you and your team do thank you
Noooooooooo0o0o0o0000000ooooooo0o0o0o
This sounds expensive
*Hacksmith gets diamond play button* *hacksmith uses the play button to get more subs and views for a better one* Sometimes, even my genius scares me
Beskar play button
Man this guy is my whole inspiration he’s why I’m in 7 grade and doing senior high school work in math and science becuase I wan to be an engineer and somebody like him Man thanks you so much
0:16 let’s find “oat”.
Why do you do that I would’ve kept that but instead you want to destroy it no offense
I feel bad for u man im sory theires so many mean peaple out their I think its realy amazing how u can just ignore all thoese mean comments please reaply to my comment
Lo que lograste fue increíble te quiero mucho haces contenido entretenido y se que este tipo de contenido es difícil de hacer tardas meses en hacer un vídeo de 18 minutos y aunque esto no esté en ingles te agradezco el. Contenido que generaste para nosotros y yo también quiero lograr lo que tú has logrado esa es mi meta
Congrats! You, your channel are awesome! Keep the good work!  Ps. Shave that homeless Captain America beard.
Youtube- now we got a 20 mil play button. Just lightsaber the 10 mil one
I was so tempted to skip to the cutting but I resisted the urge and watched the whole thing. Thanks for all the great content
Yinz should make a Mandolorian jetpack.
Plot twist:That diamond play button was a prototype they build
Lol
Wow play button is a tank!!!!!!
Ive been a fan for 1 year and a half i think or more
I enjoyed all your videos and I’m glade that your master plan is almost complete and Congratulations on reaching 10 mil like this is good I’ve been here back when you were making rail gun with batteries been my favorite go to nerd channel and I love that ur speech almost put me in my feels
Thanks for the speech men.well done😊😊😊
Yo I know the feeling life changes things not everyone can live the way they feel don't worry about the negative you are making a difference  anyone against that has no life at all and is jealous just keep doing what you're doing have fun life is short
Having a mentor is way better than having the teacher people like you that have mentors are the ones who succeed more because you're not paying to learn your being taught to learn it and to advance on the teachings
who would do this to a diamond play button?
I love how at 11:22 he just walks in the opposite direction of the oven
Damn, that one to one part hit hard. Good job! 🙂
It be cool if you melted all the metal in the play button, and then casted your own custom play button
Wonder if ya'll can even improve upon it anymore
You got to give YouTube some credit, that play button was pretty damn well made if it took a light saber to cut through it.
Would be cool if hacksmith industry made nano bots
One of these days, someone is going to burn their beards off...
This guy is cool and needs a break
you got 100k subs in a week
You and your team are all awesome. Keep up the amazing work.
cut your hair plz
Here is the thing dose he get a new one
Honestly you inspired me to be a mechanical engineer I was thinking about it before but when I saw what amazing projects you were doing I knew it was the job for me thank you for being amazing
So now that you have a lightsaber, are you gonna revolutionize the world or what.
Did the give away for the iron man helmet go yet
I hope this master plan works out for you. :)
i almost cry hehehe i really love your vids TY
I know this isn’t much but I’m in 7th grade and my grade in science is 100
Bro your the bets keep the hard work,  And am sorry for your lost, the thigs you do are incredible it doesn't  matter what people say. By proud of your work and do the impossible. : )
ur sooooooooo good!
I’ve been here for 3 years
I  subscribed
Bro thats so wholesome but honestly you put hours and hours into this channel you didn't have to destroy your play button
I’ve got an idea. If you make a small wrist battery., for the light savers.
Y'all haters don't type of it's not positive or constructive criticism
Seriously, anyone who skipped to the lightsaber part, you need to go back and listen to what James has to say. It bought a tear to my inner engineer's eye.   James, if you're reading this, thank you. You've bought a light to the life of millions and the fact that your only planning on going further makes me so happy for you, Ian, Bogdan, and the entire Hacksmith Industries team. I'm so glad to've supported you throughout these last 4 years. THANK YOU, AND GOOD LUCK!
I'm curious to find out what your next big project will be. Do you plan on making something big? Maybe something cool that we can buy?
Hacksmith
Oh I want a mini play button
A James to a James this was not the smallest thing to do 😂but keep up the good work
My mind went to Tony Stark and Iron Man and his destruction, i dont know why.
You did make a big impact
I don’t know why people complain you rule every thing you do Is amazing
Oh no
I love what your doing
But the actual crystal in middle resisted :o . Well one thought vibranium is strong, didn't have armor from youtube diamond buttons.
Now, make a beskar steel ingot out of it
Next make bay max
why
12:30 Learned this when I was about 10 watching 1,000 ways to day on spike tv 😎
WHY I AM CRYING SO MUCH?
I would love to have an exoskeleten arm I hope u can   MAKE IT REAL
Hacksmith has actually inspired me to start my own YT channel with the goal of doing something that advances humanity. Thanks for making such amazing content for the past 14 yrs!
Is it just me or does he sound like a droid when he is cutting
why does the dislike button exist like how can you dislike something so heartfelt
Ok but can you imagine what this lightsaber will be like in 20 years it’s crazy to think that in a few decades we could have actual light sabers like in the movies
Cooking a diamond play button 😂😂
I would like to work for Hacksmith Industries someday. I’ve been on a personal journey to learn as much about the world and the creation process as much as I can so that I can make anything myself. And you guys seem like an amazing way for me to not only learn what I want but for me to bring skills that I have already gotten to better the species through you guys
Your smart man
Cool! We have only been watching your channel for a handful of years now,  but whenever you have a new video all my boys have to see it. I have 6 boys who love seeing what you all do in your shop, and will definitely be inspired in great ways because of you and your team. Thank you for all your hard work! (Sorry for all the haters/unappreciative ones out there)
Youtube: Yeah we aint giving him shit anymore
You should design an ice cube tray can make a little mini play button
The god thing is that you can buy it if you want a second play button
Imagine Gordon Ramsey watch how you cooked 😂
Cool
Wow you say like captain America  I want to cry 😞😞
Well, the cooking show was canceled, so I guess the age-old saying applies: If you can't handle the heat...    Melt your diamond play button in half with a lightsaber
For all the new-comers, this has got to be one of the top 3 best YouTube channels ever, if not the best. I’ve been here for a while and I love this channel. Thanks for everything.
Make bay max in bighero 6
The light saber is just a flamethrower
Your voice trembling speak for you, you are really amazing and the love you show towards your team is priceless. Keep doing that, you are a fantastic family and your videos are pure love! Thanks for these years spent.
U guys inspired me to buy some nicrome and make a version of your first lightsabers
If you actually skipped then you're not a fan
I loved the cooking show bit right before he chopped it
Good Luck on you and your team's plans and goals going forward. Thank you for your inspiring content and content that we can learn from.
I was crying after watching this I love you and your builds
Other youtubers when they get a diamond play button: omg thank you guys soo much ill keep this safe   Hacksmith: aigh how can we mess this up
You should make a full suit of power armor from fallout 4
Next video transforming diamond play button into .............
Os caras transcenderam o Aruan
Think about this you did it you did what most of  humans dream of making a lightsaber and you did it your fans love you and you get the black card keep living for you and doing what makes you happy
Omg hacksmith are you crazy
Is their some way you can make Optimus primes Energon blades from the live action movies
Wow I remember subscribing to the HackSmith late 2015 and now 2020 here HackSmith industry’s is here with over 10Million subscribers and still continuing to make great and amazing content what an inspiration.
I don’t know why but seeing someone destroy a diamond button makes me a lil upset. Although it is his property, so he can do what he wants with it.  Keep up the good work, guys!
Wow Darth Vader cutting a play button. Love it.
You guys need more subs
Welp there goes their award.
YouTube is SO mad
Try making a boots or something that can make u faster maybe?
If only you could release the 3 minute section i care about and make the rest of it a separate video
Mr. Hacksmith: let's cook this diamond play button, and then let's cut it in halve! Me, I micro-sized youtuber: **MASSIVE CRING**
I’m Like 10 minutes into this and I just realised this is a 10 million sub special

12:22
I'm sorry WHAT? how many of those you have??
YouTube watching this: 🥲

Hey,don’t give up, I feel like if you keep building you’re brand, you could really become a real world iron man. But better
Dude you're awesome and have good team! Lets go to new heights!!
Love from Norway
Really cool I loved the way the gem in the center turned orange then the entire thing turned a pretty purple. Is it weird to say I liked it more after you cut it in half?
I'd work for you, im super interested in everything your doing. I'm a stagehand who knows rigging, electrics and welding so i'm kinda obsessed with getting a job like this! even just working there a week i feel like id learn so friggin much!
This was genuinely moving
If you get 10 million views can we cut his beard
Make a bat mobile
This made me cry with happiness
I will admit I did come to see you cut your play button but I'm glad I stayed to watch the planning your future part. I feel like you should do what you have to for the future. And try not to let those people who doubt you try to stop you. You have created many great and cool things. I hope your future is as bright as the awesome plasma from your Light Saber
Make retractable bone claws
Wth is that plate made of!? Steel was nothing to the plasma saber, yet this plate is so heat-resistant.
Holy crap man. I’ve been watching your videos since before you tried strapping mini jet engines on your hands, in your garage 🤣😂. I’m so glad to see this channel so large
You should make a phone
Hi are you still in Canada or have you moved to the us

Thousand degree sword vs Diamond Play Button
Please, do the real Darth Vader
I please ask of you to make the armor or at least the helmet, the Mandalorian wears, in the Mandalorian show on disney +
I remember when I saw him making the batman hook and I just went holy **** he made the batman hook
I love it
Keep up the good work. Thank you for everything you do
I was planning to enjoy diamonds being cut in half by plasma, but what i also found was something really inspiring. That first section was giving me a fuzzy feeling inside
No:  Not even you tubers:  The hack smith: cuts diamond play button in half
Why don’t you make a school out of your master plan
Bruh why didn’t u just put the light saber on a stand
This man is amazing

This is awesome but gotta say why would you destroy the diamond play button?!
How did PewDiePie break his if it took that long to destroy it with a lightsaber
Why do successful YouTubers always f*** up their Play Buttons?
Hacksmith School For Gifted Youngsters
Dude, your awesome. To be honest, when I'm old enough to travel I kind if want to get some engineering skills to mabey work for you guys. This channel has the stuff I dream I could make.
That was awesome

Is your business publicly traded? Im sure youd find plenty of support and investors like me!
14:32 diamond play button case hardened
Delegating work its one of the most important things you have to learn to do anything on a big scale. It is imposible to do all the work yourself.  One of the better advices i ever heard is "find people that can do their work better than you can" Because if you don't then you will end up stopping wathever you are doing to "help" (take over what is doing) the other person.  So James is right, you need experts and people capable to help you if you want to succed. The "self made man" it's a lie.
hi hacksmith! i just wanted to let u know ive been watching ur channel for a few years now and really enjoy ur content. uve inspired me, and now im trying to make my own toy lightsaber. thank u hacksmith!
Why is everyone abusing their play buttons? What have they done wrong to deserve this treatment to be cut in half? D:
Awesome
12:40 when it starts
I think you can take a break. You dont have to make one video a week. Take a break! Your Community will take it easy.
You just destroyed all of your hard work for a video respect
I can't be the only one who facepalmed when James busted into the Fresh Prince theme?  Seriously though James, your videos are great, some of the most entertaining content on YouTube, it shows what someone can do if they really apply themselves. Keep up the great work James!
the play button is rly solid
HEY... HEEEEYYYY MAKE THE MOBIUS CHAIR
You are my most amazing youtuber
You get an award that a lot of people would love to have then you destroy it
I love this video it’s so good and I can’t wait to see what you do with your future it will be amazing!!!
After all of this is ends the virus I hope to go to your industry but sadly I live in Texas
The force is strong within this channel
Holy shit
hahaha, the cooking show was so out of the blue
If you ever get rid of the diamond playbutton you should give it to JackSucksAtLife he collects youtube awards. (Or you could give half of it)
I remember finding this guy at 3am like 3 or 4 years ago maybe it was 2
1:20 was not expected that but it made me laugh so much 😂
Wow...
Kinda sounds like you trying to not be responsible for people to build plasma swords™.........
Hi
Not gonna lie the blue version looks really good

The hacksmith cooking show nearly competes with Gordon Ramsay
When I’m older I want to be on the team
Absolutely amazing, too bad there is no travel allowed, but keep building amazing projects!
I wonder if it may be possible to learn engineering/apprenticeships from hacksmith industries as well? I would love if that would be possible, learn how to make super cool projects like that?
2040: HacksSmith industry museum
Custom play button
I love your channel
Petition to get him a custom diamond play button that is a lightsaber (Cause he cut the other one in half) or just get him another. Please YouTube give him one more!
Hey hacksmith I was just curious on if you have given away the iron man helmet already
I love this show I've been watching since I was 4
i rarely comment and i know hundreds of other have complemented you guys, but i still want to say that you guys are great you and your team inspire thousands of people around the world.  what makes you guys great is that you have alwase promoted the sharing of information and ideas, and have created and embodied the inventors mantra and are the true embodiment of "make it real"
Congratulations!! I still remember your meet-up in London, you’ve been a huge inspiration to me and my inner maker.
Nice work guys
i love your videos so much you help me when im sad and when im bored you have changed my life and my friends life and for that i am grateful
The OG's that watched the full video -------------->
😡 JackSucksAtLife 😡is typing...
I wannna be on the team but I gotta get smarter.
This channel made me want to be an engineer
Why would you do that
So many storm troopers missed the Like button... typical
12:22
Cant wait to have this in WW3
I feel for you I will always sub and watch you no matter what
I know this comment isnt relevant but i need to tell you that your team is amzing and with some time you will get too far. I love what you do because you do it because it makes you happy and you make that people around you. i am only a boy but you make more ,you demostrate me that i can do watever i want if i love it thank you all you change a little bit my lífe, love from chile 🇨🇱
Skip to 12:34
I mean that's one way to get a blue or yellow 10 mil play button
The play button looked great mid heating that should be 10l mil award
salt bae😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
You can't tell me that dose t look cooler than the original
why ur biceps are of different size      steriods....????🤨🤨🤨🤨
Me personal me personally I would stop around when it got a little bit less blue but a little bit more blue and make it really look like a diamond and and make it really look like a diamond and more pretty
I just wanted to say thank you for congratulating the graduates of Conestoga collage !
I would buy EDC stuff!
Stop the cap
What is a master plan
I clicked off the video... to like it.... back to it now.
Make diamond play button out of a diamond play button next
i can feel u
Love the channel. I bet there are a lot of other comments like this.
keep it up bro 🔥🔥
I’m a big fan I watch wen 1mill
Well sir, you might have took away my words for a proper crongratulations comment but you surely took my "like" as well. Congratulations.  Edit: about the international expansion, I'd like to support somehow, even if it is saying something you already know. The biggest latin-american technology company is Totvs, and one of it's programs include start ups and angel investors, therefore, they just MIGHT be willing to make a deal.
Gordon Ramsay would be so proud
:OO
this my fav channel you guys are so cool and fun i like to watch your videos because i cant do this stuff my self and its really cool Best Channel on youtube
great work James,also how do i get hired?
U are my inspiration and my goal
Next time like in 2030 probobly he make like a real light saber like you can cut that diamond button in just a swing
why would you destroy it tho
I am sorry but why abuse your domain play button like so
don’t listen to those ppl who say that you “do nothing.” You have made AMAZING things, and making fiction into reality is something that everyone likes. You HAVE made a difference. You’ve shown us what’s possible. Well done.
So...     The diamond play button is actually made out of diamond?
Love your vids
I bet you in 2023 he's going to be building a full sized death star
I´m wondering why James goes to the right, when the oven is on the left ??? 11:22 Is this kitchen even real ?
Even though he said he’s not trying to make this a sob story I can see him getting a bit teary at the same exited for the new plan I really love your vids and I wish you good luck and keep doing what you’re doing @ hacksmith industries
Well this was awesome sooo good i cried when i saw grant when i started watching YouTube he was my favorite then i found the HACKSMITH cool name by the way then you guys collabed and i was sooo happy but i need to ask a question i love making/creating things i want to go into the engineering field but i just don't know which one these are my options 1.Mechanical engineering 2.Electrical engineering 3.Robotic engineering  Please which one you advise me too do
Bru I wish I can join them but the videos are good so keep it going
Love you man
YouTube is like 😐😑😭
wait is there a real diamond in the diamond play button
Where did the spy car go
Hei guys we got a 10 M PLAY BUTTON,  lets burn it down.
Jacksucksatlife: :(
But why, why would you do that?
Now it just needs to cut at the speed if a lightsaber
i thought it would just slice in half.
Anybody else get emotional while watching this in their bedroom while making a protective arm exoskeleton out of cardboard? No just me? ok
The play button looked liked iron mans chest piece in iron man 2
Youtube watching be like
I don’t know what to say I just feel like I should comment that Hacksmith Industries is top 3 best you tubers
The button was bluee
That was amazing and heartfelt my friend! Your work is inspiring! I'd love to work for you =D
I came here to see a play button get sliced, but instead, I heard the most inspirational thing in my whole life, and subscribed without another blink.  Your vision for the future is incredible, and I wholeheartedly believe you can achieve it.
What must YouTube think when they give out play buttons and 90% of the YouTubers who get it break it lol
every other youtuber: cherishes the play button hacksmith:
I love your work, work ethic, and the team that you have brought together!! You are an inspiration to all “garage inventors” and I know you will continue to bring the world great things and inspire even greater ideas!! I am glad that I have been a small part of this!! Hacksmith Industries is a model all growing businesses should be taking notes about.
I'm kinda confused that he literally screwed his diamond Playbutton
Damn I miss Grant
Love the videos Hacksmith, keep it up. Hopefully one day I can take a trip from Australia and come visit the campus. And the lightsaber is like a dream come true for me. Thanks for all the great vids!
First half of the video is bitching and the other half a sales pitch
Hack smith every time you read those terrible comments just remember you are making a difference, inspiring People and making greats me true, honestly man you are a great guy with only good intentions.
I know this do be kinda cliche, but that first part of the video is really inspiring
Wait the guy who did The King of random died????
“We want to go bigger” said after creating a light saber jk awesome stuff we all love you guys keep crankin out the awesomeness but do it because you want to👍
Wait what if you guys started the Star Wars lore
After the lightsaber project is over, you should replicate the iron spider suit!
ngl the play button at 14:08 actually looks awesome. If I had one I would definitely do that but just keep it at that then
I would admit this was really cool but personally I don’t think you should’ve destroyed it
Love this channel congrats with 10 mil subs I home i get a miniture play button
Why does he look like old hiccup from how to train your dragon
This was interesting but i got to know why?
Next thing u know he builds a fully functional infinity gauntlet
I was here ever sinse you where 1m
He is the best engineer ever!
What is that thing made of? Can’t be actual diamonds right
You  deserve to have more subscribers than PewDiePie
Make mandos suit
I have been wondering what was going on in Lot 42 lol
Shut up with the sap story begging for money and do the stunt. You want the attention so why should we pay you?
it’s okay man don’t worry about the negative comments they’re just hating because they’re jealous
Hacksmith: cuts their diamond play button 2 seconds after getting it  YouTube: 👁👄👁
"Beautful finally some good f****ing food"
You guys should totaly cut some steaks with the lasersword and see if you can smoothly chop some meat of like in the star Wars movies
The guy who build the Dimond youtube play button👁👄👁 (Guys its a joke)
My favorite part is the cooking 😂😂😂
the whole swerden has subd to you lol 🤣🤣🤣
I just realized- did you jump nearly 1 mil subs since the lightsaber video?! That’s impressive
Do u know what I love u and ur team as a fan. 😊
I’m surprised I haven’t subbed yet because I’ve been watching this channel for so long
Smooshes lemon with bare hand Me:
Awesome job coming this far -- excited to see how far you go!  Working in education for over 20 years I am also stoked to hear your passion for education!  Keep up the amazing work and thank you for the countless hours of education and entertainment ;)
One day I want to join the hacksmith industry, the sooner the better maybe I'll join in 4 or so years
This man will save us all
14:29 i would have left it like that!
Damn that one kid had a long neck
Aruan Félix 2.0
My mind is blown
Brown hair, red beard? The heck
@jacksucksatlife isnt gonna like this
Man, why you gotta make me cry
Keep up the good work man
So theoretically, how much would this lightsaber cost???
Are you gonna become Santa?)
U did not just do that
I think he should build something Mandolorian related like a helmet or pulse rifle or something
Youtube shouldn't have given that to you.
We would love to work with you in the future your content is absolutely amazing
I have so much respect for them for cutting it in half and then putting it up lol
i wish i could be a part of the team but im kinda 2 young and im kinda on the wrong side of the planet. it has always ben my dream 2 make stuff from the marvel region and stuff.
This is where the fun begins
Youtube: Sends hacksmith a diamond play button Hacksmith: Destroyes it Youtube: >:o
When the middle part of the play button was lighting up it reminded me of the triangular arc reactor from iron man 2
Was thinking how frickin cool..... takes 15 minutes+ to get through 0,1 cm chrome.  Yeah so it's a fancy lighter, like that british rocket powered gokart. Fun one or two times.. Probably why the industry has plasma cutters.  Well it got some views on YouTube
Love your vids bro just try not to sell your tech to any evil mastermind lol
You should make mando's rifle.
12:22
Why would you do that like it is pretty but why you worked so hard for it🦑
Your almost at 11 mill
You plus jeff bezos could most likely beat tnoy stark and batman
You should make The Mandalorians Helmet with all the gadgets and make it Han Solos blaster proof
imagine a fight between this man and pewds
Subscribe
He was right when he said it looks better than a regular play button.
nothing but utmost love and respect for what you have built in these past years and how far you have come..... i really really hope i can visit you guys once i am in canada in jan 2021..... Its and honor to be your subscriber sir... and will surely enroll my future kid if you decide to open up a school or college . congratulations
Hi! Im new here, and i subbed and turned on notifications!
Thank you soooo much for doing this I look forward to your video's evey week Love your work

Congrats on 10 million
Hi
Other youtubers:Guys thank you so much for my diamond play button i love it Blacksmith:lets melt this piece of shit
Do mandalorain stuff
This channel made me go for a dual degree in mechanical engineering, he'll be the first Hacksmith not the next anything else
This is the best YouTube channel in the world. Disney and Lucasfilm should pay him
Okay now turn that  Light saber into a fully fledged flame thrower using laminar flow
didn't skip. joined in here not that far ago, but still: keep going as you doo. It's great content & freaking hard work
Przyznać się kto od Konopka?
This man is amazing, all of them are
You almost have 11 million already!
Seeing your expansion plans, seeing you grow and watching my life dream to work for you become a feasible goal, I couldn’t be happier😊
I am 12 year old but i am learning  so much  just waching your videos
The day the hacksmith University becomes a thing is the day im truly happy
0:12     More subs.         More pieces
Congratulations on 10 million subs your one of the best YouTuber keep going and stay positive
the play button looks like it was cover for someone in a star wars battle now
Your are my opinion of iron man
you are like the pocket edition of elon musk
Maybe do: Lightsaber vs other Hacksmith creations
Hacksmith: it is only the population of Sweden  Sweden: yeah only our population
How to do blue button
i may have missed it in the video, whats this button made of?
Us when I read the negitive comments to the hacksmith: 11:15  Them: ...
I always get so excited to see your new videos. Awesome to see you have big plans for the future
Make the remains into a gauntlet and placed the diamond in the middle
WHY       But I love it
Plot twist: the YouTube Play Button is made out of Beskar.
Your amazing you really wanna make me do the best I want and create amazing things!!
O aruan felix ta diferente
Around seven minutes I started crying it was so emotional
The next elon musk
Innovator and entrepreneur that deserves to be supported! Go hacksmith industries and improve the world we live in. Right people will come. Keep inspiring
Anyone gets diamond play: oh my god thank you for your support Hacksmith: lets cut it with a plasma light saber
Absolut legend
13:00 to skip rant lol

When WW3 breaks out we finna be fighting with lightsabers
I see that you are going “Full Viking” with the long hair and beard combo there.
every other youtuber: my precious diamond playbutton youtube sent it for 10mil Hacksmith:hey so youtube sent us a diamond playbutton LETS CUT IT IN HALF!
Love the avenger quote 😂
Congratulations on 10mil and hope u vet more and more success in the future of ur business.!
I'm sorry about your friend passing away
Congratulations man love the content keep it up all love❤️❤️
With the mask on he sounds like a droid... roger roger
Told you on Instagram not to do it, I am not disappointed
Who didn't skip ?????
Damn He Really is Going to Turn into Tony Stark!!! He is probably the reason we will have Flying Cars and Shit!
I would cry if my play button of 10 mill was destroyed
Wow, how long did it take to cut through? Was it slower compared to the safe?
13:07 ur welcome
This makes me soo sad because it’s so good
I loved your videos and keep on doing the good stuff and you can accomplish anything you want
I'm 14 and this is deep lol
Always supported you and this channle!
Does your beard and haircut have any common points with Thor or Oliver Queen when he was rescued from Lian Yu ?
Hacksmith can u get a new hair cut
A: Campus = AMAZING B: Cutting the button = AMAZING C: Casting the button metal into a project: EXTRA AMAZING  But you know what would be SUPER AMAZING? Casting the button metal into a Hacksmith Industries Button and sending it to Youtube :p
How did he post this 23 hours ago and got 1 mil subs in that amount of time???
We love you 3000 Mr Hacksmith.  You are the closet to living up to Tony stark
If you want to make hacksmith go further make a robot that will battle at battlebots and the battlebots is a show that you can make robots that fight other robots and I takes place in California San Diego
Gods your words made me cry. Looking at this you remind me of my grandfather who puts his heart in the projects he makes, you gave me a chance to build things with my grandfather thank you for that! I hope you have a bright future for Hacksmith industries
12:22
Anybody who writes those comments about how he isn’t good enough for them, come back when you have 10 million subscribers and a huge business. Love your content btw keep up the great work
Follow your dreams hacksmith
Me, hoping that this is the first of many lightsabers
Do u recon u could build a better railgun? I watched a video earlier about how they were destroying themselves and I would love to see like an alian rifle
Thank you for the free content and I wanted to say don’t let the haters affect you and that your doing a absolute amazing job and we see your hard work and we appreciate it. Thank you.
imagine hacksmith being the person that builds the first flying car in like 10 years xD with his upgraded buisness
👍👍👍👍💪🤝💣 I like that you made a lifesaver I like everything you made
So you wanted to make it real?
Wtf why u destroy your play button
I realy enjoied The speech part but I have a question for you Are you going to continiu The Power loader????
Mr smith mr smith I don’t Fell so good lol
I think you should go from were you started, forge the button into wolverine claws.
f in chat for the play button
A new YouTube playbotten😂
I’m actually going to go to school for CNC operating and programming next spring bc of you
Ya ever see a comment a be like:    Man, I wish I wrote that.
love you bro keep up the work!!
video starts at 12:40
I actually started watching you because of grant I watched him all the time I made a few of his projects for either school community service or at parties I was so sad when he passed but you are the next best thing
I've been here since his original exo-skeleton... This makes me so happy to watch.
The cooking part was so funny xD, and the cut button looks so cool and so hacksmith, keep up the great work!!
Great video! Very inspiring! Keep doing what you do. You guys are great!
I know what hes doing, hes growing his beard out and creating a real Santa Clause factory
Yo hack smith can u PLZ DO NARUTO’S rasengan plz
"Why don't you build more stuff."  I mean, he can't exactly do much. He's said this before, but he's a mechanical engineer. Some projects require an electrical engineer, like Bogden.
Can you try to make play button 👍 in biggest size or play button car it's looks cool👍
People hating on Hacksmith?  Are you dumb? He has a Lightsaber you know?
YouTube: *sends diamond playbutton*  Hacksmith: *cuts it in half*  Youtube: What have I done?!
Congradz on the 10,000,000 subs and keep up the amazing work, as you say you need a team to make the best effort, everyone bouncing ideas off each other to come up with projects and the way around them, you guys do some seriously cool shit, and if i have ant negative comments its generally about descriptions of things not the actuality of the things.
This video was awesome 😎👍 I hope i get to join you're crew someday.
Hack smith Industries do you have any idea what the eta is for the campus in your master plan?
Bruh, how'd you get that wide? Give the workout
HACKSMITH AVENGERSS!!!!! assemble!
You guys ARE GREAT Don't let people get you down!
This might be a long shot, but I think I have an idea. Let's all share THIS VIDEO, to ALL the famous Youtubers out there, PewdiePie, Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, etc... On their video comments, their subreddit pages, discord, EVERYWHERE. If the Bigger Youtubers will shout him out, he will get an even GREATER following, allowing him to achieve his FINAL GOAL Faster. LIKE IF YOU AGREE!! I am posting this on PewDiePie latest upload right now.!
Since you are selling a limited supply of the mini play buttons, how about embed a sliver of the original button using the slag that dripped off the molten metal?  That might make it more memorable.  Question is how to embed the metal sliver into each button.
Waiting on the hacksmith and smartereveryfay collab!!
So, the ligthsaber can cut through pretty much anything, albeit slowly.   But can it actually slice things?
Hacer eso por un vídeo en el que solo vi dos minutos valla buena idea viejo
You are so inspiring to all of us thank you so much
I would love to see Hacksmith Industries do a project with 'Stuff Made Here". I think James can help him to take his explosive bat project to a whole new level.
It's been such a trip and it was all worth it, he is really a superhero
WTF does YouTube make those Play buttons out of? Adamantium? I didnt expect those things to be tough af against insane heat.
You should mold the playbutton metal into your logo with the diamond in the middle
Man, why’d you have to go and make my eyes sweat..? 😭😭😭 I love your content and I miss grant every time I see “The King of Random” videos.
Me waiting for Gordon to duet this like  👁👄👁
Man imma a proud Canadian, you're an absolute legend
bro James is the literal definition of hard work and making dreams come true.
Bro why your head have so many hair are you lock down 😋😁🤔
Congratulations Daniel Bryan 🎉
Soooo like where do I apply?
so cool to see how far you’ve come, big congrats from a long time fan. i’m excited to see the future of hacksmith industries.
I have been with this channel for a year now but it feels like an eternity.  Thank you Hacksmith
WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU WRECK A YOUTUBE PLAY BUTTON (there probably cheap as hell)
When you order your new play button, you should hang some of the melted stuff with it
Hacksmith I have an invention but I need your help to make it
12:22
As a final project of this channel I think a tie fighter or x wing a mini one of course
If your team builds an iorn man suit you are as powerful as iorn man
Skepticism
I was hoping you'd open up a Jedi Academy
Make a diamond playbutton sword
People work so hard to earn a Diamond Play Buttom Hacksmith- Let's melt it using the lightsaber😂😂
I love ur vids ive being watching since the kings man umbrella video
Dude you've done what top engineers failed to do with limited money and few people. That's crazy and anyone complaining is just jealous that they aren't as smart as you. Don't let those idiots get to your head. You can change the world
A much bigger flex than eating off of a platinum plaque
I LOVE YOUR VIDEO!!!! I WISH I COULD BUILD STUFF LIKE THAT!
Gah I wish I could partner with you haha
Next Video: Making a second Lightsaber out of the Diamond Play Button
it looked really cool until it started melting
Grant makes me have the big sad
it is really bad when people do not appreciate your hard work. It feels so discouraging, but all your true fans (including me) will support you until the end. Thank you for what you are doing and thank you for inspiring me to do projects like you.
Two things that we can only wish for lol
Those are HATERS. Having Anger Towards Everyone Reaching for Success. Live to work. Don’t work to live. I wish I had something that I could wake up to every morning and love.
Is it a real Diamond?
If I could do this but I'm only 10
Hacksmith Industries: Cuts Diamond Play Button in half with lightsaber YouTube: **Let's unverify them**
oh man this guy is having too much fun with his warfare-changing weapon
I love your channel and some times  I pretend I am in your videos
what will the admission requirements and tuition fee be of hacksmith university?
Me: starts the vid to see the play button cut in half. Hacksmith: skip to 12:22 if you don't wanna know the history. Me: no I ll see the whole shit. Must be inspiring and fun. Hacksmith: *starts singing taco bell* Me: ight imma head out
I love this channel I would still watch even if u were irrelevant
Congrats on the diamond play button
just amazing lol! congratulation
Hacksmith: lets saw this daimond YT play button in half  Youtube HQ: ARE U F***ING KIDDING ME?!?!!?!?
Hacksmith: I think this looks better than the original play button.  YouTube: WANT US TO START CUTTING PLAY BUTTONS IN HALF WITH A LIGHTSABER AND GIVING THEM TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY HIT TEN MIL?!?
When I first showed my mom ur channel, she loved it, by the way I am  subscribed
Hacksmith Industries: reaches 10mil and gets diamond play button ( btw congrats 😁🎉 )   Diamond play button : no you cant cut me up , diamonds are unbreakable!   Hacksmith: HaHa lightsaber go brrrr
We will miss the king of random
You can hear the emotion in your voice, You and your team should be very proud of what you've created, you have done an amazing job. please keep up the great work.
Seeing your goals made me reconsider thinking. What I am doing and what I dream!
I love everything you do, the masterplan youve come up with sounds great!, If you ever need a meteorologist for whatever reason, let me know, Im currently an undergrad Junior with 3 more semesters till I achieve a bachelors, but I also plan to continue to a PHD. The thing about meteorologists is that were basically an engineer, but with a focus on the atmosphere.
😪😔😔yup if people work together the word will be great
I have the best idea ever. You should take the metal from the play button and cast it like the metal from the mandalorian and make a furnace like the one from the show
James this is amazing, you and the team have done so much and so many amazing projects. I think I first saw your electromagnetic captain America shield and ever since then I’ve been a fan and have watched every video. I know Hacksmith Industries is going to go even further and you guys will do great work.
You are nice
The haters are jealous that they arent that smart and think they can do everything better
Wanna meet the Hacksmith soooo bad one day.
Now i feel so happy that i went on a photo with him at brightday haha
You were speaking from all your heart, the emotional side of yours. I wanna give you a hug & thank you for working sooo hard, sacrificing your mental & physical peace. You didn't stop making videos even during the lockdown. And now after hitting 10 million subs, you deserve a break, but you're still planning on working harder! Huge respect!! I really hope i get to work for you one day. All the best for all your future projects & plans!
Congratulations one 10,000,000 subs.  The work you have done on YouTube has  helped me think about what I want to do in my future.  Your the best and keep working hard.
Dude you and your team are awesome. I look forward to you guys having the first real warp drive. When you do go public and on the stock market let us know. Diversify into Australia. We love your stuff.
This man's trying to be the next Elon and honestly I love that
Demonetized for ripping off of Fresh Price of Bel Air.
The Jesus of Engineers.
Dude everyone that makes you feel like crap and are rude and say anything about your prototypes/products aren't worth your time. I'm saying sorry for them. Everything you do is perfect and couldn't be better with what you do and have. Don't ever stop. You've made me want to be an engineer or electrician. You all do everything so perfectly and the whole channel is the best at what it does. Thank you for the content
Create a stock. I want to invest.
I’m not a nerd but I respect u a lot sry of nerd afends as u can c my spelling is horrible
I am gonna take mechatronics next year wish me luck
They just built the first actual lightsaber ever,  it's only a matter of time before we're all in the *USS Enterprise*
Why oh why!?
Hey bro
Why!
dont think about the negative comment i want to get an internship at hacksmith when i grow up the negative comments are from jealous people who couldnt work as hard as you managed they couldnt wake up and say "i want to make a motorized surfboard"
him destroying reward he is proud just shows how much dedication he has for his content.
Youtube makes and sends you a diamond play button and you destroy it...youtube: *sad annoyed face *annoyed pakistani cricket fan XD

It’s looks more cooler wen is burned

Wow this one hell of a goal and I'm sure you can achieve it
you are awesome love your vids
It is hard to tell did your lightsaber cut through the diamond and not just the metal around it
I probs have been around for a year and a half, and I've got to admit what you do is astonishing and breathtaking. Like seeing fiction come to life from you and your team is such an amazing thing, and love every vid. You have educated me, in a way, as I'm a aeronautical engineer student and have learned a few things by watch your vids. So got to say thanks for bringing this much joy and entertainment. Keep this madness up👌👌
Your beard is distracting         When you talk its hard not to look at
Beard with a full face?
IDK about others but in my opinion u nd ur team r legends nd I also wish that all ur wishes come true
I mean it’s not a competition or anything, but I’ve been subscribed since less then 3 million subs. I’d love to buy a mini diamond play button to support the channel, but I don’t have any money so, sorry.
Classic YouTuber video, thanking viewers for subscribing and complaining about comment haters lol
you are such an incredible inspiration to anyone who sees your videos, thank you so much for all you have done for this amazing community i hope you and your outstanding team continue on this incredible journey and continue to share your ever growing experience with us for long time to come
I can’t believe people still disliked this video. Why can’t they just leave well enough alone?!
Next vid idea  Remake the play button
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The goals you have are just amazing.  I know u can do it and thann to you I am now taking as much of engineering classes I can in high school. Thank you for pushing me to be my best self. Cant wait to see where life takes you guys❤
Hey Hacksmith for a possible future build you should build a interceptor javelin suit from anthem I know that would be pretty hard right now because of the pandemic but hey you built a have scale cyber truck so you know like anything is possible if you try and it would be a great video as well. But you know just an idea that is all it would be cool to see you in one of those.
Dude, don't let haters get you down, how hard that may be. You are on a great path, otherwise you wouldn't have earned all those millions of people deciding to support your work by clicking the subscribe button!
The playbutton is so cool no
You are the best ever I love your vids
Does anyone else think that when he has the mask on he kind of sounds like plo loon
You all do amazing work. Its been so fun watching over the years watching you grow as a person and as a fabricator and your crew is amazing. Keep on creating dont let anyone stop you
Good work on the channel very nice
Youtube Play Button: Statrak: Factory New
*It was an Idea* (Thee Avangers)😂 LoL
starks button
Have you thought of mandolorian armour or helmet?  I think that would be cool
I love you ,,, Sir,,, Someday if I get a lot of money and if I had my children girl or boy doesn't matter I will send them to your campus. and someday my country will shine like you expectations, I pray ALLAH(GOD) to blessing you and your team and The Hacksmith Industries.
damn, great video great job.
The only channel that make fiction reality Gotta love it
Heres where the best part begind 12:22
Whyyyyyy am i just now seeing this?!?!?! 😳dude built a fuckin light saber while i struggle w legos 😑
It turned Blueee
What if u do a collab with elon musk that would be funny
It looks great on the wall! I was worried, but that Play Button now shows the blood, sweat, tears and molten metal that made this channel possible!
Who remembers the old shed
I like this parody on Gordon Ramzy
This channel has changed my view on the world and has made me realise that really, the sky is the limit!
You have millions of fans! We love your content! Don’t let the few bring you down! We love your videos and I will always love your channel!
Imagine going to the comments to see if youtube commented
You are chench the world
Hey did you know that?            Jesus Christ is The Son of the Living GOD, who has come in the flesh, died for our sins, was buried and was raised on the third day.  Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. John 14:6  JESUS LOVES YOU💖
Why you worked so hard for it
I am new to your channel but 1 question who is grant thompson
This is amazing content you are a fantastic YouTuber
Cmon he can just build 100s of diamond play buttons (maybe even like a robot)
Cut your hair u look like a prehistorical creature
Sir I am not kidding you are my role model, I want to be just like you.  Love your viddid alot
Kids of 22nd century will read about him in their books as one of the greatest inventors.😂  Love your videos man, lots of love 😊
Nice video you deserve more subcriber
you know what, maybe ill take business in school...
James you're an inspiration, love your channel and all you continue to do. I have an idea in line with your goals. Make some spin off channels that help your brand but are run by fellow hacksmithers. Then promote them ONCE on this channel and suspend uploads for one year (on this channel). Schedule a Live Stream or Premier Content at the end of that year. This will give you a chance to focus 1 WHOLE year on the brand and remove the YouTube cloud that is ever present.  Just imagine how many people will tune into this channel after 1 year sabbatical!
if they make a sword made with the melted button ???? :)
I love your videos
Good work i was Here from 2 mil (still best late) you diserve it all
You deserve it so much and you're doing it already international because I'm from Belgium ( sorry for my bad English)
Hacksmith Industries, you're my MARVEL :) .             love ya
Im sory.☹️😣
Hey, big fan I have a few ideas that I think everybody would enjoy but most importantly you
Love it❤️❤️❤️
I'm gonna start learning how to make stuff. I may only be 13 but in a few years it would be very awesome to have an internship at hacksmith industries.
make hawkeye's bow
I know of no other YouTuber that will voluntarily give you a time stamp so you can skip to it. Thank you.
Hey, I'm a fan for a while now and really enjoy your videos. Because these type of projects take long to make, and viewers want new videos as fast as possible, it's hard. Maybe you could make progress videos on the vlogs channel! With multiple episodes untill the project is done, I'm sure many people would enjoy it as would I.  I wish the best for you all
Your channel is as good as the quality of that play button. (that thing was tough! )
I like  your vids
If u stop u die
You are really good at what ur doing... I like all of your vedios/work..ignore those dislikers and negative comments...!!
Everyone stop being haters
So in Star Wars lore, they usually use certain materials that are like connected to them or sacred to them to make a lightsaber, so why not save the inner parts of the play button to cast into future saber parts
Do you think it’s possible to make Roman Torchwick’s cane from RWBY?
This is a great high quality channel and one of my favourites keep up the amazing work
to make my comment short love u guys and keep it up no matter whatever people say
I love that he Sas wath he really finks
but why? why would you do that?
Dude that play button actually looks delicious
Congres i  so happy for hacksmith industries its butiful toon see thi Chanel grow from the garage to the amizing workshop
Can you guys literally create diamonds like heat up a chunk of coal and then put in a hydraulic hammer or something????
Mate shave your beard and hair in the shape of wokverin
I know this isn't really appropriate but does it snow on Christmas in Canada because in Tennessee you would be lucky if it frosts.
I don’t believe for one second he reads all the comments
U did build a business, a business that’s constantly pushing the boundaries and changing the world
God you made a grown man cry .
Everybody: NO YOU CANT BURN YOUR HARD WORK!!!  Hacksmith: Haha Play button go BRRR
yo may god bless you  in the future i am going to visit you all and help out if i can because i love since
Is it real diamond? I always thought the buttons were just glass
Just to let you know a Diamond Play Button cost $3,000, and you can buy new ones from the society awards website. Sorce: "I tricked Youtube into giving me a DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON" by JackSucksAtLife.
Please make a donatelo self spinning staff
Please make Mandalorian’s gear
Your videos are soo inspiring life changing and awesome! Keep it up! Bu...But why'd u do that to ur precious play button with a diamond?
over a million views in a day
The man sounds like he’s about to cry, and it makes me want to cry too. I may be a newbie to this channel, but I already love this dude. I support and respect everything you’re doing, keep going. 👏👏🥳👏👏❤️❤️❤️
This idea was so good that you've a worker in another country (Alex), that shows how big will this be in the future 🌌
What a true friend and compassionate Hacksmith is.

Bru you’re doing great 👍🏼 just stay doing this😉
When you made that lightsaber, i was afraid about the possibility of a new Jedi order... because IM SUPPOSED TO BE RETIRED, now, I'm actually terrified about the incoming order...
Why don't you make a plasma sword  using acetylene
I want to be a YouTube and be a engineer when I grow up

The fact that this man has the audacity to burn that 10 million subscriber plaque for his fans...  he deserves a costume made plaque for his channel 🎉
Is that his real one
You've inspired me to get a GCSE in combined science so I can study to be an engineer!
This video genuinely gives me hope for humanity.
Hi Guys.. I'm the dumbass who "accidently" touches that table, (15 minutes after they are done and tell me not to because it's really hot)- and ends up giving myself third degree burns. -  *I just wanted to introduce myself.*
Your team is incredible and you deserve all the support to accomplish your dreams! So excited for the future of Hacksmith Indistries
These guys are crazy!!!
Diamond play button's are made from real diamonds, it takes a lot of time to melt it jaja
I just want you to know I don't expect weekly videos, I just need you guys to keep being awesome and making cool things. Take vacations if you need them but please don't forget the power loader.
imagine a real-life yondu udonta arrow from guardians of the galaxy
Congratilations for the 10 millions! You deserve it!
This man is gonna be a billionaire
I luv ur videos keep making cool projects

What was the central play button made of?
You should see if you can melt tungsten with the lightsaber.
Got to be the worst video ive watched, skipped the vid to see no lightsaber
All I can say is please don't sell light sabers to people or else we might have Sith lords running around
You're a generaly good guy dude keep it up, maybe my comment wont do much but i hope it makes your day
Am I the only one who thinks that the saber is just really hot fire
I felt all your pain journey and gain in first 10 mins of ur video bro trust u have miles to travel millions more to teach love ❤ to the core brother
Take a break go out with friends some people can be jerks flush them out and take some time meditating spending time with family is the best thing you can do. Stay happy do what you want every month don't flim just spend time with your self
He went from Hawkeye to Tony Stark to the new Steve Rogers and now the old thor hair...👍
Just don't let the YouTube CEO see it
I wanna buy the tiny play button but my mom probably won’t let me
So cool, when superman comes for his kyrptonian tech, who's gonna tell him how it got cut in half?
Take a break, have a kitkat

Matt Stonie with his Diamond Play Button: Let's eat it !  HackSmith with his Diamond Play Button: Let's destroy it with FIRE and LIGHT SABER !
I'm not a long time subscriber but I had to watch the history of the channel. Keep it up and I hope you fine happiness within.

You should feel ashamed of your self people that make bad comments
The table is the real MVP! but damn... Youtube makes a solid award!
I'm so exited to see how Hacksmith Industries Looks Like in 5 yeara
You should make the Apple Of Eden from Assassins Creed
And f you people that aren’t great full
congrats on 10M I've been around since the magnetic captain American shield. it has been amazing to see the channel grow. I truly see the Hacksmith as the new mythbusters. you both do awesome projects as well as inspire so many such as myself in to the world of science and engineering. thank you!
I am happy where this channel is going
Incase you read this, thank you for making such epic content.

I don’t know why people give u silly advices, but in my opinion you are the best engineer I have ever seen
There was an idea, to bring together a group of remarkable people, so that when we needed them, they could fight the battles we couldn't. The Hacksmiths

For your friend
Imagine being promoted to diamond and then literally cutting ur trophy in half this is proof that there trophy’s r the stuff they build 🔥💎
You should come to Guyana, we might not be a big country but it's catching up. And besides we could use someone like you to inspire more people.
You should use it to cut your damn hair.
Don’t feel you have to upload every week. We love you and everyone on the team.
I’m sorry 😔😣😖😭😥😢
Im from Sweden man
“We’re not at 11 million yet” Hacksmith industries with 10.9 million

if anakin was a youtube play button
Go on 12:43 thank me later
Sick
😭😭😭😭this is good and sad
This video reminds me of how I set my goals in life. I read the book "The Big Five for Life" by John Strelecky. A rather short book with a very big impact on the rest of my life. I can see some of those elements in the "Hacksmith way". I'm really happy that there are such great personalities out there on Youtube that can also have a big impact on the way you're looking at life. Wintergatan is another great example. Honestly every member at Hacksmith Industries is doing a great job and I'm happy that I can be a part of you by being a subscriber and Patreon. Take some breaks if you need to and don't overwork yourself, the last thing I want would be for you to crack under pressure one day. Thank you very much for everything you've done for the people!
😭😭😭😭😭😭
10:33 love how you can see the space behind the green screen on the right
Can you please make a ghostbuster build
Maybe make a new playbuton made from all the old ones with the new one.
the play button changed to 7 different colors but the rainbow one looked cool
By now at least 2000 idiots tapped to watch the video
Man i really love your vids keep going.  Your the best
The good cancels out the bad I like your optimism we need more of it. Your awesome
james i todaly understand where ur coming from
I'm not an original subscriber my any means. In fact I'm quite new. But your genuine passion for what you do and your plan for the future is very inspiring. At the very least, I hope to be around long enough to see you accomplish all your goals! Congratulations!
I wonder who won the helmet
I was here since the wolverine claws, now look at you. Really proud
Great job o the lightsaber  I know this may not be as impressive as that but can you possibly make the doomblade from doom eternal real?
Hacksmith your the best 🤩
the cooksmith
You are so inspiring and I like the new channel name. 👍👍👍
I haven't skipped a single second of this video...and it was worth it !!!
I am so happy for you and your company.
We need less venture capitalists and more Social co-ops.
Ho love hackmith  vids like here
I LOVE THIS CHAN—... I mean COMPANY!!!!!

Just wanted to say that you and your team are the reason why I chose MECHATRONICS ❤️❤️❤️
Hacksmith I’m 14 and I’ve been a big fan for over 4 years and I’m such a big fan you deserve everything you have and created I hope you continue to thrive and create more stuff and only wish fr the best keep it up man
Next project, reforging the play button with a lightsaber!
I remember the first video I watched (not even that long ago) was a self kickflipping skateboard. I’ve been watching every single video you’ve uploaded since then.
I've been watching since the original Exosuit build all those years ago.. Really happy for all of you with what you've accomplished so far and excited for the future of Hacksmith Industries. Congratulations :)
You are changing the world one step at a time man
make a red diamond play button
You know what man, you're honestly a great person and what aspire to be. I've been watching you since 2017 and seen everything you've put out. If anyone has watched you for more than 5 minutes, it's obvious you care about other people. If anyone says otherwise or doesn't like what you do and how you do it, they can go fuck themselves. You have done so much for so many people, from giving people actual sustainable jobs that are truly dreams to have, too giving people hope and child like wonder through rough times, especially now during this pandemic. Thank you James, and keep making this amazing content that has always inspired me to become better.
I’m sorry @JackSucksAtLife
QQ. Cry me a river.
should i go to collage in canada? and how would I become an intern
SWEDEN GANG WHERE YOU AT????!!!!
Youtube award creators be like:
How can there be dislikes on this video. The hacksmith industries literally is a selfless motive to benefit everyone. In todays world there very few people who think in benefit of others. I hope hacksmith industries grows beyond expectations and kudos for all the great work you and your team are doing.  Love from India🙏🏻✌🏻
LIPSTICK TAZER!!!!!!!!!!
If any youtube channel deserves this it's you guys. I am an OG Hacksmith fan. I love you guys, the videos you do. You guys are amazing and I love every project you guys do. Keep up the great work even when the jealous haters say otherwise.
I’ve been here for 4 years
Dude, I am spechless. I hope you reach all your goals and go even further.
This is proof the hack smith has a heart u r iron man

Imagine being so excited about the diamond play button that you want to cut it in half

Your videos are always incredible, and if you need to take a week or two off, everyone who loves your content would definitely understand
This guy is so chill about destroying his 10mil play button
Pause video at 15:04 🔥🔥
Hacksmith in 20 years: I created a spaceship that will take humanity to a new planet
Bro you almost make me cry. I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WATCHING SINCE 500K..
YouTube : *sent diamond play button* Hacksmith: destroy it with lightsaber  YouTube: *surprised Pikachu face*

Just wanted to let you know you were my inspiration for getting in shape, love your biceps 💪
Hackshith: I have a diamond play button, let’s cut it in half  YouTube: Your going to do what?
Expanding the internship program? LOVE IT! I’m still in high school but you can be to see me there in a couple years.
15:36 This is why you always wear gloves
Dude you just evolved to jesus🙃
but the lightsaber's length is in half
😂😂😂
Omg this is sad 😢
Rn this vid has 1.3 million views imagine if 1.2 million ppl aren’t subbed so just imagine if all of them subbed that would be awesome btw 12:22 is the cutting but I recommend watching cause its cool
DONT BREAK IT AH
Who all didn't skip when he said like the video No offence james.       Here is a idea of mine i do not know is it usefull for you or no  You have the capability of installing the iron man hud which some students created a couple of years ago  And loved your speech i just cried And we all liked your plan   I edited this comment because of some spelling mistakes
lets find oout
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
can you make it longer? short is aaah
i miss the old hair :(
We all love you. Most people who say negative things just don't know you personally, neither do I but I know the work behind what you show on this channel and I have great ambitions myself.  If you just see this fancy youtube channel which over time gets more and more professional making it into a brand people will see it as that, a brand not seeing most of the work and the people behind all of it. If you read all the thousands of comments and find this one between all the others then know that you do amazing work and that there are people really really getting hyped for all of your projects.
This made me cry
And I just subscribed to help you guys do more amazing projects.
Your a legend and so are your team. Keep doing wot you do my dood
Everyone sub to him he’s an inspiration
ican do with a video every two weeks, stop working 80 hours a week! I work 80 hours a week and I am in high school! It isnt fun!

I love your vids
Cooking with the hacksmith where me engeneer robitic arms to mix eggs for us! jkjkjkjk i love ur plan and i love the hacksmith theyv'e inspired me in so many ways and cant be more exited about what is to come.

U r my biggest inspiration now and I will remember all the things u spoke in this vid and by your voice it didn't sound fun it sounded really sad which melted my heart and I can understand your problems hope u see this comment
I love your videos much and they always make my day
What if they deadass just built a college based around engineering and other STEM fields.
Don't Be Shammed Universes are more than Stars (Only Hacksmith And ŁEGENDS Can Understand this)

Yo mad 8dean I think bit melt them into mini play buttons
Youtubers when they get the diamond play button: "Lets hang it up on a wall"   Hacksmith Industries: Lets cut it in half
stonks.
Damn, i wish i had one tenth the motivation and planning skills that they do. Holy shit they are smart as hell.
*Everyone who gets a play button just hangs it up*  James: Let's Incenerate my hard work!
I wanted the mini 10 mil diamond play button but i don't have the money😢
Nice Video
We love you hacksmith the future is literally in ur hands 💜😭I’m proud to have been subbed since 2016
Stopping at the cooking part to say your work is awe inspiring.  Your goals will help make this world a better place with tools to help people/environment/world, but most importantly with helping and inspiring STEM in so many people.  What you make is so cool and like a simple radio invention years ago, will evolve into even more amazing devices beyond anyone's dreams.  Thank you!
That's all ok but get your beard shaved it looks disgusting 😝
I love the content keep it up I’ve been watching you since I was 7
Next Projekt: Build the Death Star 😅
Amaaazinggg
youtubes offended now
Disney would like to know your location
Congratulations on 10m subscribers! I’m so happy for you, I’ve been subscribed for about 8 years, been with you all the way.
honestly, i'd be really okay and happy with only 1 video a month or a video whenever they can. I know a few channels that do about an episode a month, but they are 30-45min films, with insane editing and even more insane content. I would love to see them put out less videos if it meant them being happier and less stressed out. Also, what if they streamed them working on their projects instead of putting out a video once a week? this would keep them relevant and keep the content up to date while also giving us a view into their life as Hacksmith Industries.
Use me as the I watched the hacksmith pour is heart out button 👇🏼
I love the idea of the future of hacksmith industries gosh i wish i could work a long side people like you who doesn't let fantasies be just a fantasy, literally what i mean when i always say to my friends there's nothing impossible. I still remember that your channel was called make it real and thats where i first saw your videos and it inspired me to take a college course that is literally the brain and foundation of our technology. sorry if this is all nonsense but by chance you've read this i just want to say you guys are amazing, these guys are amazing they've worked so hard physically and mentally to get where they are, and its not simple making projects like this, not to mention the risk they put in making such amazing projects. I hope you guys push on to the future and continue to innovate our lives :). "Tagay para sa magandang kinabukasan" or in english "cheers for a better future".
Make the master sword from legend of zelda
Wow. It is so amazing how much can be accomplished if one person has a dream.

Hacksmith ironman armour with the play button as  an ark reactor possibly with miniaturized versions of past builds as an equivalent of tony's repulser
Patrolling the Mojave makes you wish for a nuclear winter.

YouTube: *sends diamond playbutton*  Hacksmith: *cuts it in half*  YouTube: 👁👄👁
Well I’m crying now. Lol
"Develop Site -2 " ... That sent goosebumps down the spine. As an Electrical engineer myself, I can't begin to thank you more for the work you've done and are doing.🙏
13:00 u don’t wanna mess around with that scene
Can you make something from Avatar the last Airbender or its sequel show The Legend of Korra, mabye you could make a retractable airbender staff, or Sokka’s boomerang or mabye even an equalist glove.
Hacksmith I got a question is there a way you can make a black light saber and happy 10 mil my guy
Weird flex but ok
You should challenge people to build robots and host it !!!
Im glad i live in a time where you guys are creating so much wonderful stuff. While living where everything is already made would be nice, seeing how you make it and hopefully getting to see and maybe use some of your work down the road would definitely be nice too
Let's  just try and then make the world a better place:)
What will happen if he cut real diamond with light saber
That’s so cool!!!!
Good luck wit your plans❤️
Cool a gas torches producing 1,000° F + to melt any metal
I’m learning coding because of you!!!
You guys are amazing
Can u do blades of chaos of god of war
You should make a playbutton sword
...         This is what you did to the play button YouTube sent you?!!
Hey hacksmith crew I've been watching your vids for 4 years and loved every one of them. Enough to inspire me to try to make my own. But since I heard you were looking to expand your group I was wondering where I can submit my resume to possibly become one of the group members?
To demonstrate the power of flex tape i cut this button in half
I like your new beard
Cast the leftover metal into a play button
Hacksmith: Reaches 50 million subscribers after a building the death star Youtube: don't even think about it
I can’t wait to see the lightsaber you make in 10 years.
There is clearly a lot of work in all of the projects and videos. Good job on the milestone and I look forward to what you guys do later!
Wow man  I didnt realize you are so much more than awesome you sir are the thing people should aspire to be  Keep up the good work

Ok you say you read a lot of comments, well I just want to say you and your team are making the impossible possible. and I really want to get a internship, but I probably cant because I live in the USA. i am very skilled at building and engineering and would love to join you team, even if I cant can you plz just reply to this...
I miss the og king of random
That light saber is  D O P E aF
10:49 I live in Sweden
Everything you and your team does is truly inspirational. I started watching your channel 5 years ago. I remember your 100,000 subscriber video, and now you have 10 million. Congrats, can't wait to see your next project.
As Albus Dumbledore once wisely said, "If you hold our for universal popularity, you're going to be in this hut for a very long time"  Not everyone will like you and your content, but you sub count alone should point out that quite a few of us support you , and hope to see you succeed.
I love this video I love your backstory to
This guy is better than tony heck better than bat man maybe even Elon musk. Oh yeah and you are a leader you inspire so many people I love how you keep going and going and going it’s amazing I need you to keep up the work and make you’re point on the world.
Don’t listen to the damn foolish haters, you and you’re team are the best! 🤜🏻🤛🏻
what if hes hephaestus and hes in disguise.
Who support my channel
it hard to watch
12:40 here is what you were here for thank me later
POZDRO ID KONOPA
ur channel has been some of the best i have seen in recent years you helped me thu some hard times wit ur vids inspired me thankyou
You guys are doing amazing work
the beginning of the video had me in tear i was watching you from less then a 100k subs and to now i watched practically all of your videos and i was too a fan of the grant Thompsons and i was devastated he had passed and couldn't believe it but stay safe and keep making the best content cause all them haters or people who dislike the videos should go stub there toes lol but ignore haters and be you

And the channel grew. And grew. AND GREW.   As did the hacksmith's hair.   Congrats on reaching one more huge milestone! I'm looking forward to seeing lots of crazy stuff in the future!
Use this diamond play botton to make a shield of this lightsaber please
You should make a hover board
i actually wanna join this team but i need to be either a good designer or a good engineer. i wanna become an engineer but i dont have the knowledge and i dont know how or where to start
Keep building and innovating, this channel is for me the most inspirational out of all ive seen on youtube. As well as making awesome projects you are also educational and thought provoking, its interesting to see all the different ways that problems can be solved. There will always be people who will criticise what you do or complain that you arent doing it right but the question is, could they do it?  I am very interested in the future of this channel and I look forward to seeing what more you accomplish.
Yeah the best content on YouTube but you can ALWAYS do better and better and that's why I think your great
After reading the poem to his gym class, Patrick eats it. The gym teacher then tells Patrick how many times he has to tell him that he is in gym class and blows his whistle, which gets Patrick subsequently hit by dodgeballs.  Roses are blue Violets are red I have to go to the bathroom.  -Patrick Star
Maybe a Hacksmith Technical Institute private college on the same grounds as the research and development facility? :P
Seriously... ruining your diamond play button is kinda disrespectful, dislike
You are probably one of the most talented and smartest person on this planet. Well done for every thing you guys have achieved. Congrats. Carry on doing what you love. You have inspired me since I started watching you around 2 years ago. Thanks for every thing you’ve done for everyone.👏👏
Only the hack smith has a play button this cool
Dont let negative comments get you down you could just see them as an area for improvement and good luck out there  I ca see in the future them making some lightspeed drive with elon
More cooking!
I’ve got an idea for make it real due to the new spider man game you can try to make a shock venom suit
anime opening be like (no offence)
Everybody in this comments loves you the hacksmith nobody hates you :)
I’m sorry I’m not done yet I can’t believe how long we all been here it’s amazing this man is awesome and just amazing bro done stop grinding
Doat a hidden blade

Damn who know dimond play buttons are made of Beskar?
Stay safe man...dont do risky things like with that rocket batarang.....we don't want another star leaving this world like Grant Thompson.......I want to see everything u will build

I came for lightsaber and got this guys whole life story
YouTube: *spends hundreds of hours making this diamond play button* Also youtube: finally! There gonna like this so much! YouTube’s imagination:  Hack smith: Yay! I got a diamond play button this is so cool!. Reality:  Hacksmith: ima cut this in half boi YouTube: ._____________.
The 2000 people who disliked this Video are just stupid!!!

You should shoot a bullet at the light saber
They already have almost 11mil subs and this was 19 hours ago 😂
Bro this almost made me cry man holy shit
Why
More then half the video was talking
Mans playing cookie clicker in real life... 1. Get more subscribers 2. Use money for resources 3. Use resources for subscribers
Bro I keep believe how long u been here like dam I been here since 3 or 4 years
God, they should make blast doors out of Diamond Play Button if it took a lightsaber this long to melt it
Mann I appriciate u since i have subbed u  6 years ago... Thanks for the support u gave me whenever i was down
A dash of lemon... squeezes the whole damn lemon out
all that for a drop of clout
I love your videos, inventions, and testing!!! Keep it up man!
Ok, this is gonna seem like nuts but can you use the leftover play button scrap that’s not being displayed to make a new lightsaber hilt.
I'm a fan since 2018
Good video
The hacksmiths tower hahahahahahahha James in 2030  avengers asemble
This should be named as: How to make a Rainbow play button.   Step 1: Reach 10 million subscribers You: ok done (costed me 10 years but anyway...) Step 2: Host a Diamond play button cooking show You: ok Step 3: Find a plasma based lightsaber You: yep, found one in my grandma's shed Step 4: Heat the play button to 330 degrees You: ok (owww! i burnt myself but do carry on..) Final step: Heat until rainbow You: had to cut my hand off as it was non-existent (it was kinda charred ngl) step 5.5: for extra taste, heat until the button has split.  You: ok done (my house is on fire btw) Hacksmith: voila You: mmm... not bad... it was worth it.
Hacksmith ....please do Kaneda's bike from Akira.
Wow. This has been a journey. I remember the first video I watched was of a real life Batman Grappling hook. After that, I was completely invested in this channel. If I'm being honest, I would love to work with you in the future. But I'm still really young, 16. But either way, you are an incredible individual and I'm glad to have found this channel. I wish you luck and I hope to be able to study hard enough and maybe work at hacksmith industries when I'm older. Thank you and Good Luck!
12:22 to go to the action
Do more cooking with hacksmith that almost looks like a real dish use the melted play button to create a sword with one of your mini play buttons on the handle
you are awesome bro but still crazy too. I want to become software engineer so can you tell which programming language i should began and master.
Suggestion: can you make an Invisible Man suit
Part of the next lightsaber hilt made out of 10 million play button metal?
It's so rudiculous
You are an absolute legend James!!
Only asking but if u where going to sell the lightsaver wha would the starting price be 🤙🏻
That's $3000 shipping excluded that..
keep it up you guys you doing good
Skip to 12:24 to skip the dumb monologue

I have a question hacksmith Industries and i hope you can answer. If someone gets member of your YouTube channel and he/she is living in Germany or some other place in World but not in America , do you make video chat vor these special events ? I thought about that because you are a technical person.
Stop playing with that lightsaber I want a real web shooter
Congratulations on making 10 million, I’ve been here since the Electromagnetic Captain America Shield and you’ve inspired me to creat things, although I haven’t been so good at that your videos gave me a sense for adventure. Thanks for doing what you do because we love to see you do it, and thank the rest of the team for me, you’re all hard working people and I can’t wait to see where your channel goes.
YouTube watching this video: 👁👄👁

The odd 2nd out
I’m not crying your crying...
Is the Dimond a real one? Just curious
It is very impressive that he compresses a very long hardwork into a small video and posts it in every week.......it inspires many persons like me and others......
*such an inspirational video bro !!*  *also....ever thought of shaving that beard ???💀😅*
The monologue is almost better than the diamond playbutton part
I love you hair
YO I LOVE THIS ROAST TO THE HATERS
You look like Jesus
I can't imagine reading all the comments
5:15 RESPECT +
You are the best
Thx for inspiring so many ppl <3 Love your videos
Dang I kinda hope he was going to rap the entire thing But I still love their content
May I suggest a lightsaber fight with it, now this is just an idea but what if you make a cyber punk version of it and have a battle, I know it coasts a lot though, really great video 👍
Why
YouTube: Awards them with diamond play button James: turns it into a Yellow Diamond Play Button YouTube: take my money 0.0
The only person I would ever see destroying their diamond play button
The play button still looks cool doee
WOW! That was a great video! I like the dedication you had about what you want to do with this! And the cutting of the diamond-play-button  was amazing!
Bro I am your big fan and congrats to your sucess.but please shave the beard it looks ugly. I am from INDIA
5:50 I started my channel because I had nothing to do
Me watching the blade edge towards the play button  Distant palpatine: *dew it*
Before I didn't know what I wanted to become but thanks to you I now know I want to be a mechanical engineer thanks hacksmith industries may GOD help you to fufil your dreams
Okay you actually have to attach the diamond onto the light saber somewhere like maybe the bottom
Inventing a lightsaber is still something we dream of but u made it real and I know u would do expand Hacksmith Industries. My hope and votes are with u bro !!!!
I only have 4 subs this makes my heart brake
What an awesome video congratulations on all your hard work and success.
Sins wen are you a cook
But why????
Hey youtube gave us something really cool that we should save, nah let's cut it in half and sell little ones to people that didn't do shit but watch the videos
I've been watching this channel for a very long time and this video made me decide to get out of my comfort zone and make this channel the first and only channel I'm subscribed to. Thank you for all of the amazing content!
Other Title: how to play with diamonds and technology
Proof that hard work pays off
Challenge build a table that doesn't go bye bye from a light saber  You might even fit something interesting in it You don't have to do it tho
If you see this say hi to me and hart this comment
Im no happy but i like it
this man is what is guna make flying cars lighters and light speed travel
I really enjoyed the heart to heart. Alot of people forget that your just a person with goals and dreams. You have kept your charm over these years and not let the grooling task of consistent uploads get to you. This is very admirable. We all can learn from you, especially with forming teams or even building things with your friends. Your work truly is inspiring
Receives a great reward and what is the first thing you do? Destroy it lmfao. You sir are a king.
Congrats man!  I love all the videos and you have inspired me a lot. I’m currently in secondary school but soon going into collage then university to study engineering. Love the vids keep it up 👍
12:22

Its amazing that i subscribed when you had like 500K maybe less subs and now you guys are at 10 million! You guys deserve it so much, congrats!
YT - here's your playbu—.........

Pewdiepie throws his diamond play button away. Hack smith melts his. I feel bad for the diamond play button
I would also like it if you would upload a video every 2 weeks ;)
Wow this speech is pretty deep Respect man 👍
Cast the molten metal into a diamond Playbutton sword

"sometimes we make things for sh*ts and giggles"
Sweden for life
My only 2 points of feedback: 1. I love what you do! Keep it up! 2. What's up with the beard Hacksmith Jesus? :)
Why would you do that !
His speech almost made me cry
The hacksmith is one of the best youtube channels? i think thats  completly true,lol
12:22
I'm from Brazil. While i don't know build stuff, i love to watch your videos. I used to watch Grant Thompson videos as well and to be honest, only today i found out about his death (sad). Keep up the good work! Congratulations now and always.
This was a very thoughtful episode that I'm certain was insightful to many of your viewers. Please continue to make excellent content and expand on you business. You all are doing a great service to the young and old inventors and makers of the world. Thank you.
dude i like your team. each and every one of them is unique and his own way of doing things and i am not only talking about the designers and engineers but also the camera man and editors. I am from Egypt and I is a  dream for me to have an internship in The Hacksmith industries.  That's a big deal having such an impact and i'm only in high school. Just keep doing what you do. hacksmith isn't you any more its the whole team.
Can i reques
heck yeah from engineer to tech god ive watched for over 3 years i love what your doing
People, in general, are ungrateful and assholes. You guys are doing great and keep up the good work!
i can see some avengers and among us elements keep up the good work  ihad the dream to become an engineer but after i think about how hard it actually is i wanna give up that ambition but after watching your video i can see how fun is it to be an engineer building projects and more, you help to persue my dream thanks
When are you guys gonna cut through some younglings with that thing! I can't be the only one who wants to see that!
You Deserve a Guiness award you worked hard for something and when you got it you destroyed it and you share it with other people
This was one of the saddest and most beautiful thing I've seen in a while.
Try using the lightsaber on a dead pig or something to see how i works on flesh XD
4:40 Avengers Assemble!
It over Youtube   I have a high temperature
E aí rapaziada ? Vai cancelar ele não ? É só com aruan ?
Bro if you do The Animatronic Freddy From Five nights at freddy it will be so coll
The final form is so uniquely hack smith it suit you guys keep up the great work

Sen daha iyisini hak ediyorsun bu kadar boş kanallar varken siz ve ekibiniz altın gibisiniz çeviriden çevirisiyseniz yorumumu ciddiye aldığınız için teşekkürler
EVERY FCKING SECOND!
Can I like maybe like it multiple times 🤔 👍🏼❤
James - i sawed this diamond play button in half
Question Ybarra u burning ur life’s work
My man already at 11 mil
I'm always going to be subscribed to you
Do you realize what you've done you've built an actual proto-saber it is only a matter of time now before we discover the secrets of lithium crystals and Propel our civilization into the Stars
That is what I would do too  no question 😂 naturally🤣🤣
There was a video on the news about your lightsaber???
You should build an all electric motorcycle kinda like the Harley Davidson live wire
Ephesians3:20 Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine according to his power that is at work within us.
So you read everyone’s comments? Heart mine
Yo you made me cry when you brought up Grant and this made me happy inside.
Only up to 5:32 and feel like giving you a hug, both for all the awesome stuff you and the team have given us but also you've clearly put your heart into this and having strong emotions as you talked about the pros and cons.  Didn't notice the channel name change till you mentioned it, but feel it's a great move.  You started this, you're still the face of the channel and you're still doing tons of stuff if not always in front of the camera, but the whole team is what's making this so it fits.  Looking forward to the next decade of great vids and builds
Your guna need a new button
Covid-19 😱😱😱😨😨😰😰😥😥😓😓🤒🤒😷
I'm just surprised at how durable the diamond play button is.
I wish I could do this but wishes don't come true and it's the will that does . So i will do this some day as a profession
*JackSucksAtLife dying inside*
Being entirely honest. I wasn't really a naysayer but I honestly didn't care much about this channel before. I dismissed it thought it was mostly a bunch a slightly more dangerous toys made some people who didn't care _how _*_incredibly_* far off the technologies they were trying to replicate.    However, I didn't realize _how _*_awesome_* the inventions themselves were. It's not simply the technology that matters here, but the innovation behind it. I respect you guy's mission to make  the world a better place for scientific achievement and exploration, and look forward to the day I can help you more than simply being a humble viewer!
When you get enough money modify a helicopter to shoot lightning or something
Great Job we did it your so so awesome and helps me and all of us and just bring happiness and a whole flood of emotions, you deserve this and you have made the impossible possible . Thanks for being you
HIT THE LIKE BUTTON IF YOU WANT THE HACKSMITH TO CONTINUE THE COOKING SHOW
I respect the speech you gave, I really do, to learn to let go, to learn to grin and bear it, to learn to survive, inspiring, you had goals, and you reached them, even if some have not been reached, be they small or large, reach for them, if thats what makes you happy, I love your videos as they inspire me, alas, im just a mere highschool student! Keep reaching for your goals, and maybe one day you will see your dreams come true
This. Is. Gonna . Be. Epic
its funny how the closer you get to the real thing the more you start looking like thor
Hello how are you?😎
Imagine if the camera went off, while he cuts the Button.
Try recreating a real Diamond play button for your next video, I think it'll do really well.
Do you think you could make something like a Ray gun from black ops zombies. Thank you
That would be nuts if you swiped the lot 42 building
How would do that
YouTube is not sending button anymore
Come on, ignore the haters you’ve hit 10000000000 subscribers and built the worlds first working lightsaber and you’ve got all of us fans. If you don’t like what this man does then go away, thinks those things in your head not out load because if you go out of your way to make someone’s day bad on purpose just think, why. Alas we love u James.
thirs is no happy
Other YouTubers: put their play button on the wall in a special case  Hacksmith: *burn*
I wanted the next iron man development video but this is cool still
On the contrary  I think that the diamond play button has a bitter taste
This is the way   Sorry i just watched the new mando episode it was amazing
I would be interested to see what a Hacksmith Mr. Beast colab would look like.
NOT THE PLAY BUTTON!
Thank you for all you do! You have truly inspired millions of people, including me, to be an engineer/innovator!
Rest in piece Grant ! ✊🏼 He was truly an inspiration, so are you Hacksmith!
Melt it like in wolverine as animantium
.__.
fudge tony starks this guy is like jesus
You should turn the molten metals into sword or something!
°__°
I know that oranges grow on tree but now I wonder if that is true
Now you can actually make it diamond with pure heat.
Thank you hack smith for putting weekly vids and love the vids
Dang bro, whatever your doing your doing it right, dont listen to the haters. Keep up the great work. You are frickin amazing, we love you.
I fricking love that plan, im ready for the future, cant wait till your a billionaire
I don’t know about anyone else but, I fully support the hacksmith’s decision. It’s his channel and most of us are just here for the ride.
Nobody: Hacksmith: ADAMANTIUM BLADE VS VIBRANIUM SHIELD
James: we aren’t even at 11 million subscribers yet 18 hours later: 10.9 million subscribers
Dude your an awesome person for everything your doing.  just a joke but you kind of sound like hammer industries, not tony stark.  Also not a joke but tony may not be physically real, but so many people know exactly who you're talking about at the mere mention of him, aspire to be better than tony, don't make him an impossible goal to reach.
I loved the old King of Random videos with Grant they were always fun to watch and try doing it myself but what happened to him is sad.
If you go to the society awards website and enter the code for the diamond play button... you can buy another one and it will get shipped to you. Credit:JackSucksAtLife
I don't think being set on fire regularly is a perk
hey Hacksmith i just wanted to tell you that you make great content and if you don't mind if you would make the Ridllers cane or doctor octupus 4 robotic arms and cungrats on the ten million subs. : D
I love your plan
TATS IT IM HAPPY FOR YOU CONGRATULATIONS
I’ve got a good suggestion of a product. You could help make a special leg or arms for people who have lost that kinda limb
"You can tell its fresh because we dont have 11 million subs" *currently sitting at 10.9 mil at 18 hours after posting*
I love hack smith and everything they do and tbh they should see how many of there projects  they can fit on themselves lol
This company is going to be one of the foundations for the future if this plan goes right.
Spired me to be an engineer
I watch your videos from last 2 years I like your videos very much I think that you should take break
You are really good I am your old subscriber and old Friend🙂
People back then: lightsabers aren't real This channel: are you sure about that
You are amazing
YouTube: *Sends Hacksmith a reward for their amazing milestone* Hacksmiths: *Shoves a lightsaber through the play button* YouTube: Are we a joke to you?
12.34 you're welcome
I'm doing the best I can do if some people can accept that in the closet we asking were then maybe it's just them you and your team are doing an amazing job and I'm glad I could support you through all of it
hey don't let the 1% get you down, they're just not satisfied with their lives themselves
15:17 you should make a rock band and this should be the album cover
Why did you do it
James, the people who don't like what you do insult you are jealous, your a well know youtuber and very well respected. You inspire people to build and invent you are amazing. Remember, we are always here for you. Keep up the hard work! Love your videos. 😊
its a darth vader button xD  Hacksmith: I have more than 10M  The Button: Nooooooooooo!!!!
I always knew that this channel Will get 10 mil subs when I discoverd it 3 years ago
Recent subscriber here! Really loving your content so far. Thanks for everything!
I saw that Big Guy. He is not totally made of stone. I saw it, I saw it all. Relax dude. We love you. I love you. I wanna be in that frame of the Hacksmiths one day. ❤.
bro you made a difference by inspiring me to make a difference. Your road is full of making difference which you may not notice now. Keep it up but dont forget enjoying life brother
Imagine if they used this play button material in star wars space ship and took the Jedis ages to break through
Oh man I messed up you said 450 not 550
I love you hacksmith keep up the great and fantastic videos you make and don’t worry about those silly haters
I have been suscribed for over four years
If hacksmith gets to 100m subs he’s play button Will probably awesome
I mean, the negative comments wouldn't exist if you didn't so think about it, even though it may seem like these people who are writing the equivalent of full length novels of hateful bashing of you and your channel, they wouldn't be here at this channel if you didnt make it, so really, imo, theyre more of a positive negative. Ignore it, do what you will, but feel good that you exist and you should. Happy smithing, happy hacking.
lol when I started to watch the video the sub counter wa sat 10.8 now its 10.9 nice vid btw
Congrats on coming so far. I started to train to be an engineer a while ago and maybe I could have made something more of myself if I had the same ambition as you.
Wait... are you from Sweden??? I’m just asking... cuz i am!!!
For the 1.9 thousand people who disliked, I have no respect for you people
For some reason the diamond play button is better because it was blueee
that play button in tanky
I honestly thought he was going to show his history by the intro of fresh prince of bel air but it’s still funny  Also congrats on that amazing 10 mil goal yay
13:10
Best Chanel ever
That’s enough lightsaber videos... make something new...
I think my favorite old project is the two hour sleep one because of the thumbnail your eyes
I didn’t know these 1000 degree knife videos were still a thing
Well done!
Ah yes..... Master Jedi Jezus
😢😢😢😢😥😥😥😥why....
Wow we have gon so far i was here since 900k on my old yt account
This is so great, James is such a humble man. 10 mil!😍
dman. really brought up grant from TKOR. );
Good luck to everyone at Hacksmith Industries, can’t wait to see your future videos
Bu.. b...b-ut why :D
4:40 he just randomly brings up a marvel quote I hope I’m not the only one who noticed that
Thank you for this, thank you for all you do.
I could just them asking youtube for another diamond play button
Imagine youtube deleting this video because of offensive content.
You have made great videos.  You also seem like a good person!
Why did the playbutton actually look nice
I love your channel and your Messages is so deep
Shoot for the stars Mr. Smith. Keep the main campus in Canada, I want to at least come visit.
its dumb they already do it with safe so what people expect with playbutton.... not even sure if some people curious who gonna win
I smell Elon Musk II
Why does the Hacksmith remind me of Jesus
Hacksmith, I really do appreciate your videos. There so cool and just entertaining to watch your team build awsome projects. I've been a fan for many years and I hope you can find another complex to expand. I'm not in it for just seeing new lifelike lightsabers, I'm in it to see your crazy mind and team create things. Yes all your inventions are cool as hell. Basically what I'm saying is I really do appreciate everything you do for us. Hopefully sometime we'll see each other some day.
Do you think he’ll by another diamond play button because he is able to.  Edit: he’ll probably build a new one :)
I love hacksmith his project are really great your 10 year plan is very good but wouldn't become too old after 10 years but I say you are successful in your previous plan it really inspired  me I will keep waiting for your videos  every week
Your content has inspired me to create a goal for myself and reach it. Even though I am not in the same industry as you, I have learned a lot and have been empowered to make a difference to the world and continue the development of our skill and abilities to make a better life for all.
.
you do so much I've been watching you since day one love your content
Why 😭😭😭😭😭
do doctors have a place in hacksmth industries:?
bro you be yourself screw all those people that talk crap.u be you :)
They just reach 10 mil and their almost at 11 mil

i love your videos. i make my own inventions at home.i sooooooo want to work for you
Who would imaging that the diamond play button would be so tough versus the light saber hahahahah
Next step from the masterplan: how to become imortal to make content forever
maaan, you inspiring so much, and the things that you and your team are building are awesome
You should make your own playbutton from the 10mil one  That would be cool
hi i love your videos and you inspire me i might not have any thing like the tools you have but i manege using card bored i hope you can have your master plan a successes
Hey all of you people who are leaving negative comments keep it to your self
YouTube better give you another one or your done for
But it’s so precious😩😩
Own a piece of history but buy it? Wow. Talking about milking the subscribers dry.
You earned the 10 million playbutton
Keep doing what you doing man :)👍
11:00 The Chef Smith
What are you doing? Destroying the diamond button from the YouTube?!?
I really hope that YouTube doesn't charge you or ban your channel for this. This was so awesome as well as a bit sad. :3
call phil swift and repair it with flex tape
I’ve been here for a long time
you guys are amazing
Hey i want to ask you that this plasma based light saber idea came from anime know as fire fore ?? And your projects are really something else 🔥🔥
How much gas did you use in total?
Probably the most hard working channel on YouTube
I love the lightsaber but cutting a play button with it is so triggering
I still can't fully comprehend that Grant is no longer with us.
Love you
I do not understand is that guy dead or is he just moved away
WoW
people who really love 'hacksmith'' and saw the whole vid and appreciate his master plans, smash the like button!
👏🏻
Im from Sweden

For those people who skipped  why tho I mean cmon whats wrong with you
😭
you're a gift for humanity c=

I came here to see him cut a play button. I learnt his plan to take over the world. I like it.
Poor playbutton
This make me so happy ...
Jacksucksatlife is crying rn
bro get a haircut xd! But awesome video! Really inspirational. Started watching you just before you tried making a functional Iron Man and it’s crazy to witness your channel evolving into a global brand.
I see your Industry in the future working with Elon musk
I see your Industry in the future working with Elon musk
I hope you are successful! Keep up your videos, they all ways cheer me up.
so proud of yall
I am studying mechanical engineering only because of you. You are my inspiration ❤
Imagine if Gordon Ramsay sees this
that was so durable. Maybe try the laser.
I am commenting this so I can be on the Hacksmith history book.
What you do is amazing!! What people say is just their opinion, you have to do what YOU want!
Hey there is more of us with u then against u love ur videos and been here for quite some time now love them man
First we wanna innovate and inspire  Me: I am inspired by you and your the innovating person i know
Du dümmer Hanss
F
who the hell clicks the dislike button if you do on his amazing videos you are the clown and the loser
Omg its the first video when someone cut a 10million playbutton bravoo👏👏
normal YouTubers when they get the diamond play button: I will keep it as a showcase and keep it safe hacksmith:
omg i just last week you where 4m now 10m gg
so stupid
Hey I think something you can make the captan América sheld with the matirial of the button sorry if i am Bad writing in inglish is because i am forma mexico
10:46 we are a actually 10.3 miljon ppl in sweden (i know its just 300k ppl more)
this hurts
shave your beard with the lightsaber
wow yeah its fresh but right now you have 10.9 million subscribers lol
I just want to share this with  everyone Case hardened - Diamond Play Button FN = 50000$
Next step is figure out how to make a small magnetic field to go inside the saber so it can retain its shape even when swung around like the real thing
i can not subscribe if i could i would😄
I just sub, to support
I love how they’re almost at 11 million
I made a reaction on your video but i got lot of dislikes..🤣🤣🤣 so i removed it but it gave me a bit subs
This moment, when watching the video in 13th of november, when the account has 10.9 million subs, and he sais "you see we have a fresh diamond play button bc we havnt yet reached 11 mil subs" i think he has 11mil in the next few days though
Why?
Me: wow finally the diamond button Hacksmith: is burnable
12:22
😭👍😭👍😭👍👏👏👏
I’m a subscriber and I’m Swedish sooooo I’m one of 10 millions. ;)
Don’t stress the negative comments dude. Take as long as you want to make videos.
Note to future Jedi fighting armies, use diamond play buttons as armor
Why in the world would you guys melt a Diamond Play Button 😂
And all of this started from a guy in his garage
I love how the diamond playbutton is so so so goddamn strong and high quality
that's one way to get a blue diamond play button
I love this episode so much. In fact, this is my favourite and most touching one even there is no new invention. Maybe it’s just me, but I felt James’ voice was shaky and going to cry. I deeply feel the burden and pressure you have been through. And I tremendously appreciate the inspiration and joy you brought us from the start. When I heard your master plan “research facility”. I can already vision The HACKSMITH Industry having its own research building, having many scientists, making money and contributing to the world! And James’ easygoingness and approachable characteristics are the best, and I hope you won t loss that when that day comes.
FIRE A BULLET THROUGH THE LIGHTSABER
viewer 2016-2???
You dumb Me one year later: I regret saying this lol
YouTube: gives Hacksmith Industries diamond play button James: melts the button YouTube: (⓿_⓿)
anyone that insults the hacksmith will face the wrath of my internet skills
YAY! he is not retireing!
WHY??????
He also made a Ruby play button
I’ve always understood that what you do is stressful but it is so inspiring. You inspired me to make a flamethrower, a gun and now I’m working on a taser gun. Thank you for doing what you do
How about collabing with Mark Rober and make the light saber more energy efficient and make it burn hotter?
Can you make Apex ledgends stuff like Bloodhounds Mask or Crypto's drone and  mabey Lifeline's shock sticks
james and team! the people who say that only james should make stuff, screw them i watch for the projects i dont care who makes them. you guys are awsome!
yo wut if u guys get sponsored by Elon...
Next video: lightsaber vs. Beard.
when youtube watches this:oh ok
I will pray for u james
U are the closest person to Howard stark. Ik u will be our Tony Stark
Can't believe that that's the first thing he thought of when he got it😂
Selling products to improve our quality of life?       Sell lightsabers...
You can do the imposible
We think in a very similar ways. I don’t know if I will ever be at your level, but think our mission in life are insanely similar. aye
Heres the thing you came for 👉12:22
Dude jesus christ take a break for two seconds I know hear it all the time but just because we are people behind screens does not mean we do care about you even though we don't actually know you fully. Don't listen to the people that think your not doing enough because they just feed of your suffering
it make me cry in the story
why his right biceps bigger than the other one
In so glad I didn’t skip to you cutting the play button, every thing was so touching. I am subscribed to Hacksmith Industries forever.
The hair is only getting better
Me seeing this viedeo: noooooooooooooo
Y'all are doing great I hope you achieve your future goals!!
Yooo 4 videos a week in 5-10 years?????
Make a sword out of a diamond play button
I really like your video's glad to be a subscriber!

As a biomed computer engineering student THANK YOU GUYS please keep being yourself
The emotion, jeez, he pours his soul into this channel.
We need more engineers like you! This world would be a better, and more interesting, place. I hope you succeed and grow!
It was your hard work for 5 years why did u did this
Video starts at 12:24
James I’ve been around since your first captain America sheild it was the coolest thing I had ever seen and still one of the coolest things I will ever see I like you as a youtuber for your dedication and you’re big brainess thank you so much man
That lightsaber and tesla truck is awesome
It makes me so happy to see this Channel and hacksmith industries growing. A few years ago I watched your video about the kingsman umbrella and thougt "wow that's really awesome" and since than I was a big fan. I really likey your goals of expanding hacksmith industries in the way you explained. Can't wait to see that happen :))
Can you guys make a dragon ball battle suit? So its elastic and actually protective pleaseee
You destroied what only few can get. I approve
I hope YouTube forgives you... lol
Well, currently at 12 subscribers...be at 10 million sometime in my dreams...so much for being YouTube famous 😁
The diamond play button looked like a real diamond when it was bluish
Is james trying to cosplay a wookie?
I do hope Hacksmith one day becomes international. Expanding technology and carreer opportunites, and for most possible their dream. You guys rock, keep up the awesome work.
I watched him at 1 million
If anyone didn't like this video, you are the end of existence.
16:02 I was hoping you would say that
Cooking the play button doesent bother me  Putting a dash of lemon puts half a lemon why u bolli me?
This is real diamond bottom?
Whoever skipped          get out of here
On and off follower. Always love watching your videos, obviously for the fun content and seeing my childhood brought to real life. This one was great to see YOU and your dream and where you want to take everything you're doing. Keep up the great work.
Awwwww Dont cry
Nice idea but it so painfull to see that 10M playButton 😅😂😭
Came out 1 day ago and he already 11 million
This is amazing!!! Your team and plan sound amazing thank you!!!! Mini play button ordered!!!
14:25 it looks like a play button with a Damascus camp lol
Ik this has nothing to do with hacksmith, but ASHOKA IS CONFIRMED IN MANDO CHAPTER 12
You deserve 68mil sub+
1000 degree knife!
We need mr beast to give 1 milion dolars to Hacksmith
Whou! Its cool! So cool lighr saber! (sorry my english is very bad)
We could all use more Thyme in our life.
I only have one thing to say   Unbelievable
*Vlogger*:*Get's 10 Million Subriber*  Woow Thanks guys this Is the best day of my Life  *Him*: * Imma Destroyed it with My light saber* *AmaewaoMushinderiu* *N@Ni*
Can you please make a second channel on which you do some stuff which the community build too
Man you are more than the hacksmith ❤️
Oh yeah I have a diamond play button lets melt it 😬😂🤪
Damm you are like a mix of iron man and captain America dude, you really inspire
I saw this play button in half
How do you cut it and still have a 10 000 000 diamond play button? Or do you just... Dont have one now?
You guys are so smart and dumb at the same time, it baffles me.
"The problem is in this day n age you need to be a big business to make that difference"  welp, that went the same for America's founding fathers. Thomas Jefferson said that he NEEDED to own slaves in order to be wealthy in order to make a difference, despite being against slavery.  it was just what everyone was doing at the time and he had to keep up with it in order to do the amazing things he did!!!!
Omg heart stuff then that loved it
Who else would literally be happy with just one or two videos a month from this great channel?  Because I would be.
Man, you are like Howard Stark! And your son will be Tony Stark! You build and amplify the brand that creates something that was only a dream! Build your dream!
IS THAT YOUR REAL PLAY BUTTON "OMG"!!!!!!.......
Does the lightsaber make those sounds or are they added in post?
this guy is the reason why i think engineering is fun
When he started to talk about grant you could see the sadness in his eyes and voice
sigan asi
You are the best
The next Elon Musk
I always support this channel the best channel ever... Watch you create and support other and everthing you do... Dont give up... That 1% just dont think bout them.. Do good still people think bad that is life.... Just do it... I love you guys
Grow that business! I want you to spark something great and keep building what you do! Become that collective for minds also we need people to think great and challenge their minds and use it in everyday life. I have always wanted to work with you and the industry of R and D. One day we will cross paths!🤘🏼
he's gone such a long way from where he was. I remember when i was 11 years old and started watching his vids. 5 years later he makes the very first proto-saber and nabs 10 million subs. Thanks for 5 years of inspiration and fascination:>.
this is next level awesome
Loved the video. I’ve been watching since you built the exo-skeleton. It’s amazing to see how far you’ve come. Keep up the good work.
Congratulations on reaching this milestone. Obviously, you’re aware of how big an achievement this is so I’ll just say that this channel is awesome and has given me countless hours of fun
What u do, is amazing. Dont let people be mean to u. Your great the way u are.
Dude you are all just amzing and do amazing work. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Love  you all and stay safe :)
You are a real inspiration
youtube: *the diamond play button* _a legendary item that has been forged in the sacred diamond mines of the youtube company. only those who have achieved 1 and 9 million subscribers will not perish in its shining reflection of pure light._ *I give thou this mythical item* hacksmith: light saber go cut cut
How hot is that it must be 10000 degrees or even hotter vise a 3000 degrees knife can’t even cub throw it only do a scratch to it but that lightsaber wow that hottt
This is how you make art from a diamond play button. I love this channel.
he's getting a hanger for a GUNDAM build ❤💙💚💛💜
And he raps! Is there anything the hacksmith can't do?
Im stopping watching these until he cuts his hair
Hack smith gets diamond play button..........                   A few Hours later breaks diamond play button
10 million?  Its 10.9 million within the second day
I love you and I have been watching you for years
Use the diamond and have a hand coming out of it
12:22
I have bin subscribed since one million. love your videos
NOW DO A BLASTER
Can you try to do a double blade lightsaber
This hit in the feels.
If he really says he sees every comment then i hope he will heart this comment
Ow they had the new version of the diamond one but they also had the old design
Always have loved watching your videos and learning from them. Negative feedback will always be there, but with this platform you have created, it’s amazing how many people would choose to be there for you. Thank you for all of these entertaining videos and helping me want to pursue a career in engineering.   Thank you.
Best speech ever gave me goosebumps 👏👏👏 you are going to be great so good luck.change the world ❤
Who else has been here before 1 mil?
Wow it looks so beautiful mounted on the wall like that!!! Awesome video, wishing you the best in your journey to greatness!
youtube: hey hack smith how’s the play button we sent you .....YOU DID WHAT
He reminds me of Burger King…
EPIC PLAN!
Hacksmith:gets a diamond play button Also hacksmith: lets destroyit Damn best video ever
Can you make the power rangers 2017 power sorwd
this was sooooooooooo exspiering (do you think you will be hireing in 10 to 20 years im 12 this year so i still have a long way to go)
This guy talks too much
Ok Ik he has 11 mil, but he’s still underrated
What are these made of?!  That thing lasted a goddam long time...
Love the plan!
Ive always thought that hacksmith industries should build something that  involves  biology and technology.... that will be something cool
I can't wait to buy a mark 45 from a hacksmith store, good luck with your master plan m8
If it was like actual Lazer. And u out it through a diamond. It would suffer total internal reflection and spread in all directions. And can come back at you.
Your  the best keep doing what you're doing
Wow amazing
Serious question though, with the way that beard is heading, are you trying to become "Lebowski Thor" from the Avengers Endgame movie? lol
James and the Hacksmith Team, continue doing what you love, there will ALWAYS be negative commentaries, but for the most part we love what you do and what you aim for! On a side note, James, I have a really good idea (I think), I'm a Project Manager and in order to make your dreams come true (economically speaking) you could create a new department focused on re-doing old projects and selling them to fans, making fans happier and obtaining profit out of it. If you're interested I'd love to take part of it. Cheers!
You are an amazing human being that brings so much good to the world!
Yo you killed it ❤️❤️❤️❤️ damn good narration uncle.. (uncle is how you we respect people here soooo)
I love ur vids
I don't remember seeing a Viking in this channel
It looks like iron mans reactor charging up
Did anyone else got a feeling of a "Hacksmith's School of future Engineering" That would be extremely cool. Final projects design and build your own superhero item.
Go by Hacksmith:1,2 Millionen Clicks in 17h.
12:22
YouTube: Awards them with diamond play button James: So naturally, we're gonna cut it in half. Youtube:  .__.
the first part is so moving
It looks like a galaxy play button
so beautiful ;A;
Wow ossum
OMG I was at that skate park!!!!
The part about Grant (king of random) made me cry
You guys created a new trend for play buttons
the hackvengers
Seriously, just what is this play button made of?
Love how it creates that kind of gold ish color for the center triangle at around 13:35, it looks actually really awesome, almost like it belongs like that!  Edit: just saw it go blue at 14:35. So amazing.
youtube after watching this video= where is my hockey stick
Next epeisode u should remake the diamond play button
I hoped that you would have been made another one and cut that one not the one that youtube has sent you
Guys with the play melted plabutton make the play button sword with the diamond in the middle.
dye your hair and beard blond and you will look like Thor
HACKSMITH, forget the 1% of people that aren’t satisfied, because I sure as hell am satisfied!
Dude’s got vision AND heart.
Absolutely love your plan and the heart to heart at the beginning of the video
Hacksmith, please give this comment a heart cuz gordon ramsey's gonna taste the 10M worth diamond food play button
But how did u control the length of the saber didnt the lazer
Bruh you scared me by saying "effective immediately". I hope u achieve all those goals. Love you guys.

"cute penguin sounds"

I have a great idea !! What if you make an animatronic dinosaur From Jurassic park love the vid
Thank you for inspiring me to go to college for engineering. This channel has helped me through a lot and I appreciate you. Thank you
"The idea was to bring a group of remarkable people to see if we could become something more" Avengers Quote at Fullest James, Really touch
wait grant is dead?
Only #40 place on trends?! Make #1 real!
Congratulation on 10 million subs may you get the chance to destroy ruby play button  😂😂
you are the best youtuber
To show you the power of Lightsabers I sawed this button in half. Congratulations for 10 million.
I came to see how they cut the play button, and ended up crying before 7 minutes
Big fan of your  from God's own country
So basically you can make a shield out of a play button
Rest in peace Grant. I'm really happy thats his channel still thrives even after his absence. if you want to check it out search TKOR on youtube.
Normal people: OMG! We got a diamond button!  Hacksmith: lets try to cut it!   You are amazing!
Dude, this made me so fricking happy seeing you do this! I’m so happy we can all be there for you!
Why did you guys do that?like it is your choice
congrats man keep it up and remember we all need some me time
4:42 was that Marvel reference on purpose? I watched your channel since magnetic captain america shield and the wolverine claws. So congratulations Hacksmith :D
you are the one ho inspire me to work hard at school and go to MIT
Hands off to your team Hacksmith this video was ossum and hacksmith good luck to your next video
Why
5 years later hacksmith  crosses 100 million hurray🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
Bro what you are doing is amazing, giving job opportunities and internship is not easy in today's world. I personally can feel this, because in my country  unemployment is very high, and a student is the one who face the most competiton. Don't listen to these people who try to bring you down, they will always bark at your achievements.
When is the next episode of the power loader coming out
man you guy are insane
Hi I like your videos this is not the first Video I have watched by you you are doing a grate job
youtupe is going to close ur channel
Are you kidding me. Cook a diamond.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The dash of lemon bit reminded me of the "two shots of vodka"
Yo you should make go go’s bike from Big Hero 6. That would be a challenge and if you guys can pull it off, then you guys are truly worthy of way more than 10 million. (Not that y’all weren’t already)
The cooking part was amazing!
Masterplan #2  Take over the world.
Youtube: What were we expecting sending them the Diamond Playbutton?
Hacksmith channel introduced me to see mechanical engineering in a new way...👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That was cool
It's just a god damn flame nothing more
James, my hat is off to you and the Hacksmith team!  Well done!  You are an inspiration to so many. Looking forward to the future and all the innovation that it holds. All the best.
I CANT MAKE YOUR SAMLLIST AND EASY THANG U HAVE AND U R THE BEST OF THEM ALL.

Hacksmith after this video: Ey... Can we get another one?
Yo Elon Musk, pls employ this guy and his team
You're giving me big 6 vibe i wish that this project grows
Madman
You really inspire me and my family, Sir Hacksmith, I really love your videos, and I actually do think you should take a short sabbatical, But I want you to do what your comfortable with but also keep your mind healthy and calm.
I would imagine that the exoskeleton  woul be popular in industry when it comes to heavy lifting and limiting work injuries
Ahh I can make that I only need 10 million subscribers easily done!
YouTube: Am I a Joke to you Hacksmith Industries?
Está va pa un poco de todo
I was goin to cry
Honestly, I love this team and can’t wait for their future
youre amazing!
Nice
Is it possible to make the sword from doom eternal
waaaiit a minute what happened to the check mark ?
Great job Hacksmith Industries team. You are an inspiration to young engineers all over to world. Love from Nigeria, Africa
I'm so impresed that you can upload evry single week with all of those AWSOME progects. The people who are conplaning that its to much time between videos, probably watch a lot of unrealistic sci-fi.
I Miss him
JackSucksAtLive cry’s 😂
They should make a another diamond play button since the original one was burnt to pieces 😃
Hacksmith Industries, it just sounds so damn good! I’m proud of you and your Journey, you will always have people supporting you and having your back!!! Keep it going my man!!
THE HACKSMITH INDUSTRIES  GLAD IM ONE OF THE ONES WHO SUBSCRIBED BEFORE ALL THIS  GOODLUCK AND EXCEED OUR EXPECTATIONS

No Matter What I will be your forever fan!
Y would someone do this
It is an absolute disgrace  that there are channels out there with more subs than this one that offer nothing more than lame "comedy". Your dedication to pushing the limits of your craft is astonishing. Thank you for the amazing content.
"That *only* the entire popultarion of Sweden"  I feel called out.
To be honest.. i do get goosebumps.. I can feel his tears and sadness when he started talking about his channel.. it’s something many don’t see having a youtube channel, it’s not easy for sure
Aruan Felix 1.9
This was insane! Not just the lightsaber part but for your history and future for Hacksmith Industries! I have been a fan for a little while now and I can't wait until you guys start to grow even more and accomplish your plans. When I grow up I want to do something that you guys are doing! Keep up the AMAZING content!
12:22
Good thing I’m a long time watcher I can tell people that hack smith industry used to be a simple YouTube channel
y does this mans not have 60million subs but 5 min crafts does the most stupid things ever and they get million of subs what the flip
the real reason hacksmith industries wants to expand is to make an actual working infinity gauntlet to take over the world
Ok hack smith just shrug those comments off and say how about you build it from scratch not trying to be rude but you should just shrug it off
I luv your vids
Youtube: congrats hacksmith! Its good to have you on youtube! And now we presenting to you, the magnificent diamond play button!!👍❤️ Hacksmith: ayo let's burn it and make it in a half! Youtube: the *FUC-*
normal youtubers when they get their diamond play button: *hangs on wall* hacksmith:"let's cut it in half!"
For all of you saying OmG wHy WoUlD yOu DeStRoY tHaT tHaTs A dIaMoNd PlAyBuTtOn PeOpLe WoUlD KiLl FoR oNe Of ThEm    You can buy playbuttons from YouTube if ur playbutton is damaged
Make it real ep1343 real working infinity gauntlet destroys everything
I luv your vids
The Hacksmith in 1 year: Im cutting my emerald playbutton for 100 mio subs in half
Poor YouTube they made this diamond playbutton just for you. You : I dont care let us just destroy it.
I talk about how the Hacksmith inspired me to become an engineer in my collage essay
Where’s the real ones
I love your plans, your big picture
Am I the only who has noticed that he has changed their channel name
Goodbye play button!  Welcome viewers and commenters!
What is this 10mio play button made of? Would've expected some coated hardened plastic or something like that.
Here before he's in a history book
When the playbutton turnd blue it looked.....nice,You could say it???
IMPORTANT PLEASE READ !!!!!!!!!!!  i know your making hard things but sometimes your materials or things are dangerous to give to people so can you make a brand new suit for cops that contains amazing tools that cops need in thier missions or a one for firefighters or even give the dangerous projects to cops to use them like wolverine bone claws cops use it to break walls and get people out of burning building or upgrade some of your projects to help them or you can make projects that can like stop global warming like electric cars and by making factories that dont produce steam but please the world neeeds help and you have a super things that can destroy thanos so can you use them to help the world even me i need to or get make something that can help the world with my classmates for school and i thought of you and you inspired me for great ideas and                                                          PLS IF YOU READ THIS MESSAGE GIVE IT A HEART SO I WILL KNOW
You must Curt your hair
Dude you don't look good with long beard and hair
Am i the only one who didn't notice the change in the channel name until he said🤨
Your the best you tuber
I Ben her from 50 ,00

Keep doing you 🐐
I don’t know how anyone could be satisfied with what you guys do, keep doing what you’re doing and just know you guys at The Hacksmith Industries are awesome
I just noticed something. As I am writing this you have more subscribers than Colinfurze! Its not a competition but it really shows how much you and your team have accomplished!
who else watched the whole video
Fazem um disco voador kkk
I know this is very hard to do, but could you guys make another channel where you teach people stuff about electronics, mechanical, etc
I love you guys man!!
Youtube: Here is your reward for you hard work, *a diamond play button.*  Hacksmith: *Funny lightsaber go zzzzzz.*
Now let’s make a Death Star
This is a really good plan congrats to 10 mil

I have to say, this is the best video yet, it's so touching, and a great way to reach out to viewers. Thank you Hacksmith INDUSTRIES.

Play button: "turns orange"  Also playbutton:  *THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL FORM*
YouTube: Congratulations on 10M subs here is a play button  Hacksmith: let’s cut it with a lightsaber  YouTube: 🤦‍♂️

Oh. That looks delicious. What would Jamie Oliver say?
some people hang their play buttons up but he destroys it😂
Yeah, that's cool, but can you cut a real diamond?
He is building up S.H.I.E.L.D academy, so cool
I like the look of the burned playbutton
in future i think you will make a time machine or portal gun or jetpack or anything like that
Actually its cool when you heat the button
Why you destroy the playbutoon.
Jag kommer ifrån Sverige
you are my favourite guy  in the world
Make a play button sword
Awesome
Just got it and already gonna destroy it lol
hey on 3:19 in the backround , make that red go kart to offroad electric go kart and call it hack kart
So inspirational 😢😔
Normal YouTubers- get diamond play button keeps it safe   Hacksmith- let’s cut it in half
How about a big Lightsaber Model and the Play Button Part is in the Lightsaber Model?
thats the rarest oceano case hardened pattern!
why the hell are you doing that to your 10millon 😂
Hacksmith is now looking like Daniel Bryan from WWE 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Jokes Apart  Lots of Love from INDIA   ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wy you do that
Sci-fi aruan.
I’m happy this man doesn’t let people have to wait 12 mins to see where it starts instead of just not showing the time stamp
It made me so happy to see y’all grow and you popped off with this lightsaber man good job and god bless
Any content you make is fine I love everything you make is amazing you inspire children and even grown people thank you for everything through all these years sometimes i would come home angry sad and  I would watch one of these videos thank you and the hacksmith team through the years
Nooo. Not the Play Button
That was so heartwarming
Just seeing a hack smith video makes me feel smarter and happier I hope his master plan comes true
Dude why
You are like a lion man because of your hair and beard. Hahaha
Youtube: *gives hacksmith a precious award as a gift* Hacksmith: ”What if i destroy it?”
I loved watching the colors start to slowly creep and take over
Who knew there was such a hardwork behind this happy face...Hats off 👏
Bro I agree with you at the time when you were telling your story.
thx
This is a really really good video
Congrats hacksmith  for 10 mil
You guys really deserve it keep up the good work
i can relate with it hard posting once a week, you gotta edit, record, not fuck it up, it can be quite hard but fun
it is so nice and good what you are doing :')
to the 1.7k thad hit the donw vote ,,,,, just y
I've only been watching your videos for 3 years but it's unbelievable what you've achieved together in these 3 years. Keep it up! PS. I come from Germany and my english skills are not the best.
You guys totally should collab with Mark Rober if you ever have the opportunity! Thanks for the awesome video, as well as the inspiration.  Love you <3
Dude omg that’s so cool that he put the time stamp for what we wanted to see
But... Do you get a new one?
That was really cool! Was not expecting all the color changes!
A FAN FROM PHILIPPINES 😍🤩
YouTube diamond sword
Wait so you took a few years finally getting the diamond play button then you cut it in half?!?
Последний раз моим глазам было так больно , когда lego-сурерразрушитель теранил lego-звезду смерти
hey nice job getting the diamond play button! I have an idea that might work for a Spiderman suit. Find out what webs are made of, then make it stronger and turn it into a more concentrated amount.
It only took like a month to cut that in half
The blue play button looks so cool
14:24 sapphire play button, available on 10.8 mill subs
People here in sweden, we go like were not small :c
This guy is the best, my respects from Spain
Hi your amazing
But the play button tho I and now I want to kno what happens
Product development is a big step up from prototypes.. maybe 25% of it is actual engineering. The rest is project management, market research, regulatory compliance, sales, marketing, documentation, verification/validation, business development, supplier contracts etc etc.  I do hope you get there and it works out for you :-) probably the most important thing to remember is that not everyone might think your invention is as useful as you do. The hardest part of being an innovator/inventor is knowing which idea to put your effort into.. and its often not the coolest or most interesting one.  Anyway, I've enjoyed your videos for many years, so I'd like to give something back.. if you ever need help/advice on the product design front let me know, I'll drop you a contact email on your website. I've spent nearly 25 years developing Electronics for optical devices, robotic systems, sensors, medical, as well as founding a successful start-up company.  Best of luck James & Co :-)  Malc
Now i dont want this to be a sob story... The first 1/3 of the video:
To everyone below, please watch the whole video. it is worth it
make a diamond play botton sword but a lazer is shooting out of the tip
next project idea: instant-non-hair-inator
I must commend your beard your looking more like a lumberjack
The rap tho is 🔥🔥🔥!!!
Make tesla coil
Make the mandalorian armor, or just something from the mandalorian
the botton reactor
4:47 a group of remarkable people - goosebumps, just goosebumps
I'm a fan for 2-1 years and didn't it used the name be "make it real"
Sac religions
I’ve been here ever since the blitz shield and when I saw the lightsaber I freaked out thank you for making all these projects for us to enjoy and I believe that you guys could be the first people to make a fully functional iron man suit that would be awesome
well, you won't be getting a replacement for that play button haha..
14:15 is titanium buttons
I appreciate so much that you do you do so much amazing things and I thank you for giving me something to look forward to I want to be like you when I grow up
I prefer the new channel name much more than the old one
GG videos, gratuelitions ( I cant speak English lol The one thing I want to know is:  Do Hacksmith will read this comment?
Please tell me that it was not your 1st real diamond play button :(
Your Masterplan 2 is impressive. Seeing on how Masterplan 1 is almost complete I am confident that your next opportunity for another big jump will come.   You and your team, I hope and wish you all will reach the dream, of Hacksmith Industries being a international influence on the world.
YouTube is asking why did we gave him the play Boton
JackSucksAtLife would cry
I watch your Videos since 2017
와
a surprise to be sure but a welcome one
.
I've seen lots of people mention the "hidden" Nick fury quote but not many talking about the Google x reference.... you keep going for moonshots hacksmith industries.... and we'll be here with you....
i think you make the coolest things ever lol
Enesbaturun bu adamdan fazla abonesi var inanamıyorum aradaki devasa farka bi bakın
Hi
The history and future of Hacksmith Industries part wasn't why I came here... but what hit me the most.
Hey, I think there's no way you could make better videos, thanks for that.
Sweden is actually 11 millions 😳
This is probably the best video you've ever made.Your future plans are so inspiring for me.
He sounds like Charles Xavier, in a good way.
i love your vids hope 0% of feedback is mean
Now you need to build the prosthetics from full metal alchemist
shout out
the clip of grant made me cry
congratulations on reaching such a huge milestone! See you when you're at 100 000 000 subscribers! You got this!
Aruan Felix, O Retorno
The diamond play button:
How does this vid got 1.7k dislikes
You can order a new one if it breaks
Bro at you dump that is worth  less
Thank you for creating incredible content for years you are a true inspiration and an incredible person and thank you to the rest of the hacksmith team who have helped James for a long time
Hoooooooo
Mabi you guys gonna maik the worlds først flying car?🙂
i admire the spirit of this channel. no one should complain about the products of this channel. the stuff here are cool and free, and building a project for 8 months to make a 10 minute video for the people is the most amazing and inspiring thing someone can do
The fact that it’s color is constantly changing looks so cool.
This is just torture
That was epic bro
I am very sorry for the bad comments it touched my heart ❤️ 😐
I haven’t been a hack smith viewer/subscriber for that long, I came in about 6 months ago but these project are super cool, James has talent and I can’t wait to see what he builds next. Oh yeah I forgot to mention, if the government calls asking to make this a public business that is owned by the government, don’t have a civil war.
Amen Brother
I just started watching Hacksmith and the talk about team and the future and it hit me hard, am really glad about this and am happy for every single in Hacksmith team. Keep doing what you are doing and good luck
U are good keep working hard
I wish you good luck for hacksmith investors
I heard the pain in your voice, it's hard to talk about people who aren't there anymore. But even if something like this happens, you can't give up and that is the exact thing you did, you won't give up. You are a man more respectable then Tony stark. You did it!
Wow very deep.   Thats inspiring
love you so much i rememeber when i first subbed you were at like 4 mill or smth. its just insane from where you started and you are now always will love your vids
Congrats 👏🎊 for 10 mil subs I hope u will get more 😃
You are by far my favorite creator. You are a true inspiration to everyone who watches your content. Finally you are one of the few channels that I will let my son watch (11 months). All I can say is thank you.
THAT IS A SAPHIRE PLAYBUTTON :D
Epic gamer moment
who else was here since the will it laser series and the exoskeleton ones
can you build a proton pack from "Ghostbusters"
It looked cool when it turned blue I preferred that.
This man is god of creativity , patience and determination
When you gonna do a time machine
Marvel created the unrealistic expectation that you have to do everything by yourself
Just ignore those negative people. I choose engineering just by being inspired by you channel .
First time to comment I always watch your videos but this video will be an inspiration to me And I'll always remeber your heart to heart inspiration💘
"Its turning orange" You mean... like the demonetized icon?
*11:14** and finally a dash of lemon* squeezes the whole lemon   *yes, a dash.*  edit: oops i scrolled down to find just the same comment
You are one of my favorite Youtubers, and you have no idea how much this made me cry... I really want to thank you for being apart of my life, even if you aren't in it.. thank you for inspiring me and alot of others
1:13 fresh prince of bell air
can you build a gun that shoots electricity
I have been watching since you were at 4 mil
Is that your actual diamond play button
My physics teacher mentioned this lightsaber on a lesson today. You can be sure that I, a big fan and regular watcher, was positively surprised!
Mate you have done so much for this World and lots of people would agree with me. You make think  look impossible possible and that inspires lots of people to make great think for this world that you imagine are possible so keep what you doing and duck the haters
i ve been following you since 5 mill subs i think
Other Youtubers: Imma go and put this play button somewhere. The Hacksmith: Imma cook and melt this prized possession for a youtube vid.
I love your channel and you inspired me to do things like this
Hey Hacksmith  I am from India a very big fan of your idealogy I wish I can do some internship with you 🙁😞 please help me
don't listen to the haters you have been a big inspiration keep up the good work
the fbi: can you work for us?  james: no  The fbi: *can we work for you instead?*
Where is the comment from Youtube itself .I think they are not happy that you breaking thr button.
I am truly inspired by you. I absolutely love what you do and I've been inspired by you as old as this profile pic is. Lol "2013" by the way. I fell in love with your channel watching your exo suit videos and have always wanted to build my own. 5 years later I did. My ability to make it along with watching your videos inspired me to go further and explore the world of engineering. You have inspired me to put my brain to help the world and have fun however I can and maintain my imagination as I feel you do with all your projects which is what I love about your team so much. 10 million subscribers and you're still building unbelievable imaginative inventions that I know inspire so many. I truly hope to meet you someday and work with you even just for a day would blow my mind. To pick your brain is a goal of mine lol my plan not yours maybe but I'm excited for that day to come if it ever does. Continue to inspire and motivate!! Grow your team and business. I'm so excited to see what you bring to us in the future!!
Dude u just have great ambitions  I love the way u do stuff stay the way u are ❤️❤️
Love from India ❤️ 🇮🇳
I came to this channel for the light-saber, which is freaking amazing and you should all be so damn proud of yourselves! I must watch more of your videos. You guys put in so much hard work, its inspiring me as a product design student. This is what i want to do with my life! You guys remind me of weta workshop. Sorry for rambling on a bit XD wishing you all the best!!!
O Aruan Félix evoluiu...
Every YouTube : my diamond Playbutton is holy Hacksmith : Let’s cut it in half
Maybe you may do something from the anime RWBY
Why did you do this
You told a camp for kids
Whoever told him that he wasn’t doing good enough you should feel ashamed of yourself because you know good and well that you probably arent an engineer and that you probably don’t have a mind as creative as this team of people
You deserve everything coming your way and muchhhh moreee Mann.......... Great going  GBU
You and your team are so amazing
Please cut your hear and bread
All in all, don't sweat it, work as you see fit and relax. you only get stress and bad vibes from over working yourself and not relaxing when you deserve it. and i doubt many people deserve as much as you and your crew
Don’t listen to anyone you are the best I have bin watching you for year’s
what a honest video!!! you and your team is awesome! every minute watching your projects is joyful! thank you!
You look like Tony stark from the Marvel game
Yes! Coking whit the Hacksmith is back!!
The blue orange Playbutton looks even better 😂😂
Wow man. Really exciting and you know you're amazing and you're doing the best content I've seen on youtube and you and everyone else are investing in each and every one of your videos and you really deserve those 10 million followers and we're here to stay with you.
I'm just waiting for JackSucksAtLife's reaction to this
You guys deserve all the recognition you get!
destroying the hard earned play buttom was too far man
Cut off my arm and take my money

You deserve more appreciation man love everyone.
The play button looked so cool when it went blue and the diamond was orange
Do you work for Disney?
“And to show you the power of engineering I lightsabered this Diamond play button in half!”
Hi i like your videos I saw all of them
I,m crying rite now
15:35 - “I LIGHTSABERED THIS DIAMOND PLAYBUTTON IN HALF”                                                         and                               “NOW THATS A LOT OF DAMAGE”
I’m sorry for you’re loss but how did he pass pass?
I wonder if you could get George Lucas in one of these lightsaber videos and see his reaction to what you've built. Maybe he could cut through a door with the first real lightsaber
His voice was weighing down when he was talking about his history. Like he was crying on the inside. He is talking about his history and stuff so... Yeah
He risked his whole life play button to just let us see what happens.THATS THE MAN HE IS FEARLESS
Ive been here since you've made Sledge's sledgehammer and I love the content. Keep it up
Make the diamond play button in to a hilt if your gonna make another one
You should build a gravity hammer from Halo
Türk olanlar 👇

Novo aruan
Why do people criticize you, you do what YOU AND YOUR TEAM can I personally don’t care if you take a break because you are a person like me Daniel geene here in the comments, without you I and other wouldn’t have crazy and cool things, so if you need a break it doesn’t matter YOU ARE HUMAN.
I miss Grant Thompson too. Great guy. Love watching your videos hack smith. Keep wowing us like you always do 😎
Grats on 10M guys, as a fellow KWian YouTuber (albeit a very small one) it's great to see people from the area doing GREAT work and having a great time doing it. YouTube is not easy work, even for channels under 300 subs like mine. But I love doing it. Cannot wait to see what the future holds!
Why you ruined that?
I have Been watching you for years good luck on phase two
see its not a lightsaber its a portable burner
How
Youtube: spends days in making a perfect play button  Hacksmith: "LETS BURN IT DOWN"
I am a kid 🧒   And your videos inspire me so much 😀 and I love 💖 your videos
Okay u talk way to much thats why u grow all want to see and u talk and talk to get watch minutes ...
awesome job guys, that was beautiful :D and i love your goals, good luck in reaching them ^^
YouTube watching this vid being like 😐
Oh god u really look like a Viking. Wow a new idea make Viking equipment from httyd it would be great 👍🏻👍🏻😁.
What if you bought another one and heated it enough just to change its colour, having the worlds first multi colour legitimate 10M play button. I say legitimate because i mean sent by YouTube not one made to look the same.
I loved this video so mush we like to see you succeed keep doing the great work you have my respect and support
Oh my god, you actually went and cut the button. Here's hoping they maybe send you a replacement or another one when you hit the next milestone of subscribers'.  Good luck with thinking about how to use that melted metal. Maybe you'll use it for casting for a Mandalorian related project or something.
bro this is not cool  buying that hacksmith play button is not at all a good idea
Youtubers get a diamond play button: keep it safe and locked away  Hacksmith: with a little of pepper before cutting it
The most amazing part is that when I'm 50 or 60(currently 18) hacksmith industries will actually be the stark industries of the real world. Which actually has me more interested in this journey we have embarked on.
He temporarily made his diamond play button into a blue gem play button 😂
Other people: I'm gonna keep it in my safe! This CH: Cut it out.
You are my motivation to create and you showed me anything was possible keep the great content up and don’t care what others say you and your team are amazing people keep the great content up
Good job man good job
This is beautiful
I gotta say your master plan is honestly great, it's clearly very well thought out and practical, and fully understands that research requires funding (which you already worked out the means to do so), all I can say is well done and wish the best for you and your future :-)
this guys wear STARLAB in the Flash Movir series 2:23
It kinda looks like a case hardened skin from CS
ur the best
its like aruan, but with a lightsaber, wath make this even better
Soooooooo why would you ruin the play button

You should start an international College/ University plzzzzz

Is the research campus going to be a school?

Bro stop swearing Bruh Bruh Bruh stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop please please please
blah blah blah blah ... 12:23 JK, love you man. =P
I'm usually one of those negative comment guys, but not on this channel. This channel is incredible.
Imagine a collab with the hack-smith industries and mehdi from electroboom
Wow h
Honestly I think it would be cool if you would teach us how to make those little play buttons kind of like with the silver chocolate play buttons so I can feel like we're part of the Channel
Man you are really shooting for the moon. I hope you make your shot. 😁
i do think you need to see a barber
Mad lad
how tf is that button so stronk
you guys are a legend
Wow I was a bit away and you look now like Jesus🤣
It's certainly going to be one of the more distinctive diamond play buttons out there. :-) And those blues on the face of it at 14:20 are gorgeous!
Dude.  You're mistaken - you aren't just building Stark Industries - you're also building S.H.I.E.L.D Academy.
Can you please do Kratos’s leviathan axe And you make me quite happy as my dog passed away yesterday. You made me really happy thank you
have you played assassin creed valhalla? or god of war? try making  viking  things.or blades of chaos.
YouTube: am i a joke to you?
This video is not what we deserve, but what we needed! Keep up the good work!
Bro this first part almost made me cry. My first comment from a long time following you, i know bad comments might be hard to handle but just dont listen to them and do what you heart says. Everyone love you here.
prince of belhair/ candaire
JackSucksAtLife is gonna love this one
Nice
Nooooo u cant just burn the diamond playbutton you worked over a decade to get  Hacksmith:haha playbutton go brrrrr
Me:Nice you got a diamond play button, you know its so hard to get one of tho- James: *cuts it in half and ruins it*
Make a hacksmith play button out of the diamond play button parts
Nooo, don't destroy it!!!!
I ve always been told you can't make it and your videos always inspired me going thru every insult and now I created a cart with a boost of a methane gas compressor
Youtube:. Sends an award to remember Hacksmith's achievement. Hacksmith: FREE TESTING METERIAL!!!!!
it breaks my heart to see that beautiful play button die lol
Destroy unbreakable box with lightsaber
Im locked out of my house hacksmiths litle hellp
This is why we love you and all of your crew so much
Wow
Cooking with the hacksmith is a violation
Can ya get that fixed tho?
My Favourite part of the process of melting the play button was when it was blue and the diamond was orange
A day after this upload hes almost 11 mil
Teamwork truly makes the Dreamwork. Congrats Hacksmith Industries Team! Also, oven-roasted diamond play button on a lightsaber skewer looks tasty... XD
O_O
i relly love this idea, maybe in like 10 years i woud like to work with/for u. u seem like a very nice man love ur vids
This is video make me cry
Viking beard-
Couldn't help but notice how carefully the saber is being held in the video, not revealing the fact that the saber is not long enough to be saber Good job on build standards.
Why did you do that YouTube won’t send you another one
New super hero
At the end he should’ve shaved his head :o
You should make a robot Pokémon please
Hello! You are a very cool dude, I always watch your videos. I have an idea for a lightsaber, as I remember you said, you can control it with an electromagnetic field and then the beam will be inside the box at all, but what if this electromagnetic field is inside? Create a retractable "stick" with the required field strength and let the plasma through it, which will become its shell.
And hero
You guys work so hard and I love your videos they really inspire me you guys are awesome!!!!
A new villan
He diamond play button is not diamond it is iron if it was it would be the 1B sub and heavy
in future their will be a villan
Oh my god is he complaining about a couple hundred negative comments and is now explaining why he shouldn’t get criticism? Also that grant Thompson thing was just a beg for sympathy. I always enjoy his videos but this shit ain’t it
Can you make a titanfall titan with 3 week 's
The inner me is crying right now
Bruh we subscribe you and you got the playbutten only from us, why are you do this..
:)
Good job
The World and the whole Humanity needs more people like you guys.
I love to work
14:33 at this point this play button looks LEGENDARY looks even better than how it was initially LOL
Other youtubers when they get the diamond play button: lets keep it and cherish it and take care of it! Hacksmith: haha lightsaber go brr
I am mike i have always been a nerd dare i say a MARVEL nerd! But im also adopted. I love your videos and am amazed i cant stop watching ur videos and i have been inspired by you recently it was my dads birthday I accidentally ruined it made every one feel bad my dad is my hero. All i ask is if u can plz make hawk eye bow and arrow he loves ant man and hawk eye. God bless you and hour channel i cant stop watching.

I have been a fan for 2 yeard
Hacksmith:*Burning the YouTube diamond play button   YouTube:We made a mistake
before i discovered this channel 4 years ago. i was a random no-idea engineering student and i had no idea what i was doing i only choosed to become an engineer beacuse my family wanted me to be. after i discovered hacksmith i learned what can i do to change things around me and the ways to change it. i always wanted to become you maybe not in a way creating fictional gears but i can still do things that can envelope technology and technic therefore i can call myself an inventor of something all thanks to you Hacksmith. bad comments will always be there because of internet's toxicity but i know there are a lot like me who have been inspired by the job you have done thanks for all !
One of the few youtubers to not lie and actually destroys there play button. You've earned a sub
Congrats James buddy , for 10M subs. keep growing and make people surprise.
who else didnt skip to 12:33
I think all your videos are amazing don't let anyone tell you different you made the impossible possible just the day before you made the video my dad said making a real lightsaber was impossible for multiple reasons but you made it real thank you Love logan
I love ya man you need a vacation
PLS Make a Poltergust
I wonder what would happen if you run an electric current through the blade...
The hacksmith will most definitely help the military win battles.
No one: Not even Hacksmith Industries: Bots:don't lie who has been watching Hacksmith Industries for over a month now
Holy... you really destroyed it.. YOU ARE AWESOME MAN!✌🙏👍👍👍
Why?
10mill it’s amazing
Mando armor vs the lightsaber ?!
Why are they destroying it though
I wont lie this makes my day, just seeing someone happy during this insane year. I honestly hope hacksmith industry's stays for all of us. Whether we understand what you guys are going through or dont. We all want this place to grow, into something beautiful.
YouTube watching this video like: 👁 👄 👁
Mans gotta shave
Actually it was more epic than the endgame
I have been a subscriber for a long time now and I would like to say that everything you are doing is right
Congratulations, comrade!
umm.... (Should i say something about cooking "The Hardest Job" Reward?)
This is a great video dont listen to people who say you dont do anything anymore you a hard working man and we are all here
@Hacksmith btw you can buy replacement play buttons, but buying a Diamond one ive heard costs about $3000
I like how the molten part cooled and solidified on the table.
Youtube: AM I A JOKE TO YOU?
Who would wanna skip that part? i love your videos and i hope that the 10mil loves too.
Amazing achievement guys, and I'm really excited to see what you have coming up as part of your master plan!! If you ever need an educator hit me up!!
What is the procedure to join your industry?
I don't know how to feel about this
James, I dunno if you will catch this comment in the thousands here. But I wanna know that you, by far, are one of my favorite channels to watch. I come on and see that I've got a new Hacksmith video to watch, and while I personally may not be interested in some, I love to see them all. I personally like how you've added members to your team, and some of their personal projects have added a lot to the channel. You've achieved and created so many amazing things over the years, and I'm glad to have been on this journey with you so far, and I'm beyond excited to see what you bring to us, both your YouTube community and the world. Thank you for continuing to push on, continue to create awesome content and develop such an amazing business and team
You could hear in his voice he was so sad and on the erg of crying and it made me so sad
I love you youtube channel you have inspired me to make my own projects I am 12 years old and I am learning C++ and using an arduino to make my own inventions that will help other people. Thank you.
I just hope that your industry becomes an internationally recognized industry and gets support from different countries to increase quality of life and the quality of the planet
is this real?
can u make electric whip please
The start of the video really changed my perspective on you and I feel that negative people will think twice now before really commenting something bad.
in the end he made a really cool diamond play button the color are pretty
Its gone from make it real, to real Its really inspiring to see where hacksmith is today and where is was struggling getting more then 100k views and getting almost recognition. Good job keep on going please!
Ik so random BUT i like your beard LOL
The Smith of Youtube-Air 😂😂
Youtube: Oh you reached 10mil Subscribers? Here's a diamond play button that's specially given to creators that get 10 million subscribers! Hacksmith: *looks at lightsaber* Ferb I know what we're gonna do today
Hacksmith : getting a diamond Playbutton  Also hacksmith : *Lets destroy it*    Me : Dude ..... 10 mill.... Te.... wha?
Congratulations on the Ten Million subscribers. I believe 311 said it best, "F**k the naysayers 'cause they don't mean a thing."
you know it is sad when you know that someone this good will die
You are going far Good luck on your journey 🙏
Pensei que essa mania tinha parado com o Aruan Felix.
I came here looking for copper but damm i found diamonds
I love all of your videos bro
Thank you hack smith and you have my full support
Not gonna lie I think the diamond play button looks really cool 14:28
Skip to 12:40.
YouTube ain’t giving u an other 1 so lol lamo
Aruan Felix 2.0
do what u think is correct ... there is always ppl thinking like wise ...  chinese saying: 人在做，天在看。 ignore all the ignorance ... keep it up 加油。
Imagine how youtube feels about this video
Why, why would, nvm it's was cool asf 😁👍
Dude I just wanna congratulations your videos inspire me I wish you all the best ❤
This guy is like tony stark
*Do Not Try This At Home*    **Ya , We all Have Play Button and in our Laundrys**
I love you plan it’s great and you diserve all your  Success
Have you heard the tragedy of Aruan the not wise? I thought not, it's not a story the brazilians would tell you
I think the new name makes a lot more sense and is a welcome change, can’t wait to see what the future holds
"You can tell it's fresh since we don't have 11M subscribers."  *Laughs in Deji*
I'm wondering why the gas isn't ended yet
Fuck I love this channel
I have just no words. Firstly I am a really big fan but I too had a thought once that 'why the Hacksmith ain't getting more into the building of projects himself' but now after listening too you I have understood the importance of the team and not a single person can become the change in reality he needs to take and respect people along with him. Thank you for inspiring me and millions of people around the world Hacksmith.😄
u r insane
Damn! After this motivation I wanna work with this guy
Why did you burn it
Thanks
Thanks
Why did you burn the play button
Maybe you can play the game assassins creed
Good job. Keep up the good work. Please stay in the K-W area for your new place. Its great that this channel is local.
People can only dream of what you achieved with the Hacksmiths and now extending that idea shows true character and idealism
I always wanted to help the world using inventions and am thinking of going to engeiering and you've been a great motivation for a long time. I had a though life till now. Just writing this to say thank you for being the only person that has made me realise what I want to do.
The thumbs up button isn't enough to show our love for you!
I guess part of the mission statement of Hacksmith Industries is “Make it Real”.
*this channel in 50 yrs* building a literal planet
Ok wen you get to old for the job well some won cover you
He turned in to jesus
Congratulations on the milestone 🎉🎉
How Many smal play buttons did you make?

Make a Pokèball  Make a Goddamn Working Pokèball
if you dislike this video you are jeliss
God amigo, you've made me almost cry with pride, I've been watching your channel for a good 2-3 years now and I can't believe we've got this far, Boyo, you and your team are INCREDIBLE, and so are your plans for the future, you got my backing, and I'm pretty sure I speak for most of the UK when I say, you go out there, expand, and rock it like no tomorrow boyo. We'll sure as hell back you anyday.
I like the fact that the channel's name now is Hacksmith *Industries*
imagine 500years later you research for the first lightsaber builds and find out its made in haksmith industires
Wow .....if I get a chance u see u work with my own eyes ...It will be the happiest moment of my life❤️❤️❤️❤️
You should make your own custom thing with the metal from the play button maby something that has a little of like every project that you’ve done, and also congrats on everything you’ve accomplished on this channel.
Is James a good boss?
Hacksmith: I don't want to make this into a sob story or anything     Me: *sobbing*
Well I have a feeling in the future we will see this guy having the first kyber crystal
Why though?, I'm just typing this for the algorithm.
*Cooking a diamond play button Chefs: Interesting! 😂
Imma hunt down the 1.6k people that disliked
The speach about grand
Tony stark invention is coming, thanks to you hacksmith industries

When you have the Hacksmith Campus, you're gonna need a chef on property to help keep everyone going. I'm offering my services for that if you get there!!!
chupa aruan felix
I love the hidden avengers quote in there "The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if we could become something more"- Nick Fury.
i bet u cant do ghost rider fire motorcycle
Do not mind those few negative comments. 90% of that 1% are trolls and people who do not know what they are talking about. The remaining people who are complaining about your role and the evolution of the channel just do not like the changes and will be telling everyone how good was everything "back in their days".  You are doing a great job and we are all excited to follow along with your journey!
Alternate Title :Laser Sword Vs An item Worth 1million or more subs
I totally respect your honesty and feel exactly the same on my, so far, relatively short YouTube journey. What you said regarding the 1% is very true and can stop creators from creating, I too work very hard on my content, although the final quality is not how I would like it just yet. With your honesty here you are helping creators like me understanding that the 1% will always be there, but keep going regardless, mainly because 99% is a positive majority. Awesome video's by the way, I'm in your 99% 😁👍
Plz don't cook 😂 any more.
you made me cry whit you story
Man I love this guys, theyre a real family and theyve created the channel that is an inspiration of a lot of people, including myself, thanks a lot!
Hack I want to ask a question pls ... Aren't light bulbs hot ? well maybe make a hotter bulb longer then it could be easier pls reply
Wow the ehing looks awesome at 14:14
12:12
I didn't skipped to 12:22, but i saw the previous part on 1.5x speed 😅😅😅😅
What I have learned is that his sub count grows with his hair
Sir you are my inspiration . You always makes that things that we imagine could have in real.
One thing I wish I could help with is to build a better  exoskeleton assistants  device  to help people with back injury to return to work with reduced pain... I had to get a spinal fusion when I 27 and I have been in pain since... technology has helped  me to have mobility  and some quality of life.....
I think you hold a world record. The first person to bake a YouTube play button. First person to ‘protosaber’ a YouTube play button
Please tell me that you have a back up playbuton
Alright guys so who’s leaving negative comments cause when we find out who we got some kneecaps to break
YouTube company be watching like:              👁👄👁
You little smart genius
Wow congratulations on over 10 million, I’ve been watching you guys do awesome stuff for like years wow congratulations
More lightsaber cutting things videos please
14:20 Congratulations you have made your diamond play button a minecraft diamond play button.
When you get bored of anything:
You're a great motivation. Salute from India
Love your channel and creations but I feel bad for the play button, it represents all of us subscribers and now it's destroyed.
I thought you wanted to do case hardened playbutton((
You are one of the reasons why I made it through highschool. It was you inspiring me all along. It was you that kept me going when I was sad and wanted to sob at in my bed. I’m not the only one I’m sure. Just another kid who grew up watching his hero. Like how my elon musk grew up watching Armstrong and buzz Aldrin( his heroes). Thank you.
Go to barber and finish your Iron Man suit (maybe not in that order) :)
Fun fact you inspired me to I've made a few shields based on your Blitz Shield design and it got me to step up in that category and make way better heater shields keep up the good work
You just smithed the hack out of that diamond play button! Congratulations on the new mile stone. I'm very curious what projects are in store for us in the future and how your business will impact the world. Keep up the good work!
Who are the people who disliked the video like y y would u do that
9:25 you are already an internationally Viewed YouTuber
your work is amazing and it has inspired me so much keep up the great work
Keep it up buddy....we are always with you
Don't listen to the haters, man. You and your team do amazing work! You've inspired me, and based on the rest of the comments, thousands of other people around the world. Watching your videos made this hell of a year a lot better. Can't wait to see what you do next!!!
Can you make vibroblade from mandalorian.
You are crazy man but i like your ambitious goal
I love you, your content and dream.
Hack smith Industries till the end❤️
I really miss grant thomson(random happens)
15:09 low key looks better than the original
Thumbs up for your vision, dedication and continuing zeal. I envy you for your goals (accomplished or still developing) and wish you and yor team all the best and may Clank have mercy on y'all.
Bruh that was really really ..... Crazy   And I also have a idea .a little out of the track to what u do normaly.  But can u try and make a fully identical functioning HIDDEN BLADE from assassins creed II
I can imagine in ten years hacksmith industry’s will be the biggest company even bigger that google
No matter what the other viewers think you are my favourite character and I like how you are so happy and now that we are at 10 million thank you
Youtube: *sends the diamond play button that 10 million people subscribed for the hacksmith to have* Hacksmith: *Cuts it in half with a badass light saber* Youtube: Am I a joke to you?  Been subbed for a while it's great to see youtubers having so much growth over time I love you guys, Congratulations and good luck in the future. <3
You talk too much
It would be very cool if you people recreate all the light saber scenes from star wars.
Respect to you man
this man destroyed his own prize, not to get more viewers, but for the ones who dislike this channel... this man have huge balls, not like you, dislikers
Damn, I have been following you from 2012 from 5 different accounts... and MAN! I feel your feelings when you talk about all those bad comments. Whoever these people are, WE ARE ALWAYS WITH YOU@
It's new name is just... amazing...
dude holy shit.. don't throw this all away by wasting everyone's time, talking about your channel. Don't talk about your channel, be a channel
U should try to do terminator genesis bike
10 million is a great number and what I am but a single anonymous commentator using an alt account bearing zero importance? I don't know if my comment will be read, but do know that you always have a fan in me, since 4 years ago, and for the foreseeable future. I sort of predicted that you'd open a campus, taking account that you always talk about pushing the edges of technology advancements. While yes, it does concern me with the fact that you don't show up as often, I get where the haters come from, I see their points, but, as you referenced, even Tony can't live up to Tony's expectation. These people want to see their ideal version of Ironman in you, but Ironman is fictional, while the Hacksmith is real.  For some fresh idea tidbit; The madlad over at "The Thought Emporium" channel actually cultivated a real artificial spider silk with yeast. With the spider silk's ultimate tensile strength absolutely overpowering any other known material, I'm thrilled to see you guys creating an artificial muscle using it.
Hello sir I  am a fan almost from 4 years and I have seen how you and your channel have grown and today as I saw 10million subs it was a emotional thing to me because I feel myself as a part of hacksmith industries in future some how if I got a chance I would love to be a part of your team as well you have really Inspired me also many inventors  you are my idol Thankyou if you read this please like also react back ❤️❤️❤️
Dude, I'm ok with waiting for videos. I personally get that all of your projects are not easy to make and need time, u need some time off to just relax and live a normal life as well. So please, don't read those mean comments, they're either not fans or just too stupid to understand that this is not an easy content to make. Been here since 2017 and seen your channel and yourself grow and you earn every single one of those 10mil. Keep it up and don't be too hard on yourself. Peace
Ashish chanchalani chutiye ke 21 million subs hai or itte bade talent Ku sirf 10 million 🤔,  Abe America sudharjao laudo....
I still love you
12:22
Congrats for 10M subs

What material is that diamond play button?
This is how many People think James should get rid of the beard 👇
This is wrong

Khylo:- I am going to kill you     Hacksmith :-look at my play button  🙄🙄🙄👍👍👍👍
I pity anyone who skipped straight to 12:22, you've missed so much.   To all the Hacksmith Industries team a massive well done. I've been watching your content for years and I've loved how you've evolved. True team work.   Keep up the great work guys.   p.s. I know there's a pandemic etc but if you could get that power loader finished it would be great 🤣
Other YouTubers : diamond play button?? I'll keep its save and clean it up every day!!   The hacksmith : hmm what should i do with this diamond play button? AH I KNOW, we should cut it into 2 part!
So innovative ideas
Good luck with your plan!!
Thanks, Capt. I'm more than happy I stumble into channels like this, not with those channels with rubbish contents. I learned a lot, entertained a lot with this channel. THANKSS !
Nice heart to heart. You rock, support you all the way.

Pool.o,luimkkum
WHY DID YA DO THIS MAN BUT YOU ARE THE BEST
Please pray to god to achieve your dream
god if i had a play button i would keep it in a very very high security forget cutting it into half.
YouTube after watching this " We need stronger diamond play button for this channel! "
you should make 'nano-tech' clothing like iron-man and black panther like holographic images but 3D. Use a suit of one way glass shapes or something with similar properties over clothing
Very humble
GOD blesss
We appreciate your dedication and your work. Thank you
I wish to be like you 😊👍
I was so sure the playbutton would melt like butter against the lightsaber. Anyway hearing your words touched me deeply, hope you can continue pursuing your dream!
Hacksmith: *gets play button Light saber: 🥺👉👈 is for me?
I love u
who didn't skip?🙋‍♂️
🇬🇷 Hacksmith.. You are officially a man equal to a Greek...
Can i get heart ❤️
Don't lie 90 % of people skipped to 12:22.  Thanks hacksmith for not pushing people to watch the full vids
Hey don't break that precious stuff
The dislikes were from the creators of the Diamond Play Button
this is what you do when you dont have anywhere to put the diamond play button
If only Youtube put the same effort into their censorship as they do in their quality control of play buttons.
You are so good i just wanna meet you 😔😔 And watch you making projects in front of me😔😔
The future kn the line boys You should named it  HLC (Hacksmith learning center)
Can I send my CV after I go though uni and become a mechatronic engineer... Also your videos have inspired me along with other amazing creators.
If you need lecturers for your campus contact me. I can lecture all basic applied math courses.
Bro, I really wanna work in Hacksmith Industries 100%
This was so heart warming.
Love what you are doing, keep up the great stuff. Your plan sounds amazing and I know that you will come through. Your team is amazing and you deserve more recognition than you have. You always brighten my week no matter the circumstances and wish you the best for the future. :)
I love your videos mate you give a sight of joy whenever you upload, thanks Hacksmith Industries
Have you said who the winner was for the mark 5 iron man helmet
Bro do hair cut
Shit!
I am crying
14:18 ngl that play button is so cool (200m play button)
Can I ask  question don't  you get hurt by doing these dangerous projects specially the light saber
Get another 1 and then heat ir from all sides to the same degree and heat it to the degree when it turns blue......that would be dope
Congratulations on your success and wish you many more year of fun and enjoyment in the art of innovation.
Love everything you do 😍🤩🤯 Question what are you going to do when the government wants to buy you lightsaber 🤔
U should make a new button with the melted button
I love your videos keep it up.

WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT!!!!??? I’ve wanted the diamond play button for months and you just destroy yours.
Like my comment
Loved the speech 😊
I am proud to be your viewer
Ohh hack smith I’m sorry take a break and you build  everything now take a break and enjoy life
Not like 10mil is 3 times the population of Ireland where I live!
İ swear to god this guy will be the one who will build the first real iron man suit.
YouTube taking them hundred of hours to make a play button and just to get  destroyed in seconds
Watching the glass centerpiece glow vivid orange reminds me of the quote "the strongest stars have the heart of kyber!" Thank you for your insight and sharing your dreams with us, James! Though there have been countless ups and downs, I hope only the best for the future for you; regardless of how screwed up the world can be. And like Grant said, please do take breaks when you can! It's an Industry now, you owe yourself some R&R.
Cooking show
bro u can do it,we the subscribers are with u
WTF, WHY? It's not pretty...6:31- It looks like someone threw away this award and ruined it, and you found it and hung it on the wall...
Hey James don't forget pakistan in your international plan.

Don't worry about the negative just do you🎉🎉

Today is world kindness day so don't leave negative comments nor any dislikes ☺️☺️( just for this video afterwards you may )
When you cut a diamond play button with the world's first lightsaber you deserve those subs and likes
These guys make the coolest videos
I do be flexing my Dimand play button 😎😎😎😎
I live in Sweden and your 10 million subscriber joke was hilarious👍😂😂
You have a good head on your shoulders and a great heart. Trust me when I say that hearing people sitting back and critiquing you can be difficult. But, these people are not attacking you and it’s not personal, tho it may feel that way. I went into my career to better my community and know what it’s like. However, you do you and keep your vision alive. I’m fairly new to the channel but love the content. Keep being a great roll model and yourself. Cheers!!
10 minutes of talking, 4 minutes of content
please cut my head but dont touch the diakond play button :'(
I have an project idea that I think would be awesome. It would be cool if you build an AT-RT from Star Wars.
I can't believe he would do this for fun
:( grant
NO JUST NO
I really miss Grant Thompson
Hey can you make a darksaber
You're not just a youtuber, James, you're an inspiration. You aren't Tony Stark, you're the Hacksmith. And that's amazing.
Gordon Ramsey do be loving this
Believe me, youtube is gonna piss off
You are awesome
With great power comes great responsibility🕷🕷🕷. Great work keep working the way you do. The team must grow for the world to discover newfound technologies .Keep working like that 🙂🙂🙂
that whole "master plan" talk made me want to change direction in college to engineering, just to apply to hacksmith industries later on in life to help innovate, as we need more people who innovate for the sake of innovation rather than profits. congrats man, you've made a goal that was so damn admirable, you almost made me change my choice in dream career!
15:11 the REAL TONY STARK ARC REACTOR!!!!

Please cut a diamond in to half
Claim your "here before a million" views prize
History and future of Hacksmith Industries Me: 😢😢😢😭
Dude i got really emotional, i love you James don't ever stop
Initially: Just YouTube Play button, Finally: Hacksmith style button.
Here's another positive comment to push that ratio to 99,9%! Congratulations to your (and your teams) success! Good fortunes for the future!
12:22

Surely YouTube will send a replacement button
You do hard work i like your project ps it’s hard

James, You are awesome.
your voice is wavering. i hear tears
One of my Dreams is to be like you!
I love you and your work. ❤️❤️
Hacksmith Industries   The Industry that can turn fiction to facts
Hack smith can u like this u can be my first YouTuber that made a video I commented and they liked it
Wow what a beautiful speech it really touched my heart.
I wonder how long till he builds a weapon to destroy the lightsaber
"You were supposed to enjoy the diamond play button, not dostroy them".  Awsome video by the way :')
Imagine if all the cientific youtubers come together and work in a huge thing
i am  a big fan i really like ur creation
dude, i cryed jajaja
That is so great!!!!
That thing was much more resilient than I expected jesus.
Jacksucksatlife wants to know your location.

12:22
I'm sorry for this stupid comment but at 5:05 you looked like Keanu Reeves.
Plese cut your hair and be jentel man
U inspired me and i just started crying and i just cant belive how you and your team pushed the whole world and you are the best youtuber ever and also you said that marvel scene
Why?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
I wanna meet James...u inspired me to study science
Rest In peace Youtube
my first thought was, "But why, Why would you do that"
Can we get a hint to why you're growing your hair so much
:( the first 6 minutes made me cry :(
Love you guys! You're videos are amazing and keep up the good work!
I'd love to see an arc reactor play button. Maybe for 20mil
Inspiring story. I really hope you achieve all your goals…. Now with a ware house that big I think you need a 1988 ED-209 to guard it. :-) good luck with everything
You keep doing what your doing and dont worry about all the negative people in this world
Hearing the trembling in his voice really shows his emotional and human side. Don't listen to the negative comments, what you do is absolutely mind-boggling! I talk about your videos all the time and just seeing a real lightsaber is so amazing that it leaves me speechless. I honestly cant think of anything to say besides YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dont mind the haters , just keep working hard !😄😄The haters can’t do what you can.
2:00 maybe hacksmith are going to be company that sells futuristic kind of stuff in the next 5 or 10 years..
Hacksmith > Elon Musk.
I saw this guy from being captain America to Tony stark to finally an endgame thor
That guy reached 10 million subs and the first thing he did was to melt his prize
youtube just staring in the back and regretting giving you the play button:
12:22

Where is the maple syrup ??
Maybe just use a little of the molten play button in each project if possible

Love everything you do all the builds are amazing and you are 100% right even in daily life people can't always make it on their own sometimes you need a team to move forward and to keep pushing each other to push the limits of what you can do the more minds you have everyone can have a different perspective and catch something that the others missed keep up the work you do. Your fans have your back and will be here to see the amazing content you and your team have to show

Why did you do it!what’s inside did it for you😱😭
Are you mad
You are guys are inspiring and I tuly thank you for that, you give me hope on what people can acpmplish. I would be honored to someday work with you to make this planet a better place. Thank You,
Hacksmith is the modern-day  Tony stark
Hacksmith: I don't want to make this into a sob story also Hacksmith: talks about Grant Thompson  me: *sobs*
JackSucksAtLife needs to react to this
I hope this inspires youtube for new coloured playbuttons cus that looks epic
when it is really bright it should be the youtube logo
Hacksmith: a future with exoskeleton  Me:what about cyborg
I'm glad I didn't skip to the destruction and you have earned my sub. Wish as a poor aero eng student i can do more
Diamond play button turning blue is satisfying. Also looks hot.

You keep inspiring me, I've already found a way to make web fluid
Hacksmith sees: Dimond play button  Hacksmith sees: general griveves (idk if I spelled right) Hacksmith: hello there 🗡
Gordon Ramsey should check out your diamond meal
that is funny you cut your 10m play button now you don't have 10m play button
0:55 About today's sponsor lol
Hacksmith love you from india😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️ Come to India it's an amazing place I am a old subscriber
İm a old fan 3 years im watching you
Now 100k subscribers for making teleporting device
Future of Hacksmith Industry will be beyond imagination....Best of luck...boys... By the by....R.I.P to 10 M play  button..😜
I love how real this it is
Maaan, that speech really touched me. I've been a subscriber since the very first project and it's wonderful to see how you've stayed humble and greatful on each of your projects and achievements. You really are an inspiration for all of us, keep moving forward. Greetings from Mexico🇲🇽
No, no, no. You should make your mini buttons with a pieces or metal coat made from real button. Then it would be more like sharing a piece of history.
anyone else's mouth start watering when he cooked the diamond playbutton?
your and your team is just like our Stark Industries and you are its Tony Stark .                  love u sir
Congratulations for the diamond button
Did he actually destroy a FUCKIN PLAYBUTTON!! I was excepting for like a reveal or something at the end being like ha gotcha bitch😵
You hacked your button
Why did u do that 🙄😓
12:22
U will accomplish ur goals. I BELIEVE IN U👍
what a terrible video, no respect.
BRO LOVE VIDS
Why are people being fuckwits there is no need to be like that keep doing the good work like this
I wished he stopped when it became blue and orange
Hairstyle and beard looks so good.
One of the most wholesome and amazing groups of people out there. Your team and you are fricking amazing and have inspired me several times in my writing. The 1% of negative nancies are not your true audience (for the most part),  I'm not saying to ignore the 1% here since I know that's impossible, I will however say that you all are widely renowned as an innovators and all round awesome group of people.  From one of your huge UK audience, keep doing what you're good at, and as always I look forward to what you can achieve next.  Peace out.
Went from anakin to vader real quick.
New 1990 sow
Thanks Hacksmith
"and finally, a dash of lemon" *proceeds squirting an entire lemon over the play button and the table*
PEOPLE! DONT COMPLAIN. JUST DONT WATCH
I'm pretty sure that you're crying inside were proud of all of you
Legend💪🏽!
Wtf man, this is awesome
Thank you Just Thank you, for everything you've been sharing with us. Thank you for inspiring people. Thank you for showing us that the world can be some much more. Thank you for showing us for giving us a reason to Research. Thank you ☺️
I can hear real and pure emotions in his voice  ❤
Bro you should contact Elon Musk! The two of you can make everything!
wow i remember  when the captain emerica shield just came out
*Most YouTubers upon getting the diamond play button:* "Lets put this on display somewhere." *Hacksmith upon getting the diamond play button:* "Meet my lightsaber." (Ok, that sounded better in my head.)
jacksucksatlife is going to cry when he sees this
Such a shame of the play button But personally I think you should cast those molten pieces into the hacksmith logo, that would be very cool  Ps. Didn't skip ahead
Go you. Please continue to expand. I can't wait to see what the world will looked like when your industries dominates the world.  And yeah, maybe make your own cooling show, don't cancel it, it can give you millions. I guess
You monster, why would you cut your success???!!!!??
This was an amazing video and such an eye opener
They can order the diamond button in youtube site. No problem for them to break it.
Please shave like old days
That is beautiful. You have the most unique diamond play button on earth. Unless someone esle has tried  the same thing(I guess not ).
the first lightsaber was the first video of yours i watched btw doesnt it hurt burning the play button
Diamond Play Button | Case Hardened
Why did you do that
you should take a break man you really deserved it more than anyone.and come back stronger than ever 💪👍
Bro i  ame to this channel after like 3 months and dude what happened to your hair you look like big foot
Oops?

Grateful for you have rightttt
Incredible.
Hacksmith Industries will now not become just like Stark Industries.........but even better😎

Im feel sorry and yet mad at thosw people that gave 1 percent negative comments
I found you guys this year. Please keep going. You guys are amazing and so talented. I hope to one day buy a lightsaber because of you guys
Oh man Why did he do that...  by the way will you da a give away for the small play button that you guys made..
Guys, you are crazy! ;-) Please keep it up
It's fascinating that the diamond play button took so much time to be cut in half. Really shows the amount of money youtube spends on those.
Ive been watching since that iron man rocket from arm video. 8 did not know how to subscribe then. SO you are welcome
why
all jokes aside he literally just squished an entire lemon on the play button
I've been  watching you for 2 or 3 months and our professions and roads are different so i won't be able to understand the basis and all the work at the background of those projects. But i can precisely say something that really affects and inspires me all the time: Your love, perseverance and patience against your work and your dreams can be seen even from your eyes.  People who have these qualifies always reach to the top and succeed their dreams even if they're hardship no matter how long does it takes. I deeply hope from my heart that may you succeed everything you wish and may your road always be clear to proceed. Because you so hardworking that even as a foreigner i feel satisfied to see you working.  Really appreciate  to what you are doing for the world. Have a nice day sir
You spoiled man
You make good contant plz make more but rest to because you need it and don't worry we will deal with the haters
Love you from india
Thank you for making our child dreams come true..
My face hurts now, from smiling so much thru this video! Love you Hacksmith team! ❤️
It was getting so serious and then he quotes Avengers. This man is a legend, sending ripples through the universe
Many many congratulations  May you reach 20M also very soon I am very grateful to you for always keeping us entertained also you showed us that nothing can be impossible thx a lot. Keep growing
Was anyone else just staring at his huge biceps, that’s my goal.
Noice
I love this channel, it’s future tech in a fun way, it’s a vision of what can be :)   I hope to see more cool things, and don’t worry to much to show a new lightsaber every month, we are all human and a break/vacation can be well deserved and needed. Small things can also be nice in between.   I can really hear the passion in your voice in this video, almost trembling.   Keep up the good work :3 Now go make some cool things with your team.
What why did i do that
After watching this channel for 5 years by now i still get amazed by your creations. Keep up the good work
I thought that thing was mostly aluminium or something, but I guess I was wrong
Dude your my hero I look up to Stan Lee, elon musk, and you keep going man love you dude.
When I heard about your cooking show, I got somewhat excited lol
You company is growing very quickly .I wish your company becomes like telsa and you bieng the elon musk
I was with you for more than 3 years and I am still going to be james
10:35 almost
Make ghost rider set please
It's rather easy to pass through an engineering degree and not actually get your hands dirty with personal projects where you sit down and actually make things from all the theory - thank you for inspiring this maker side.
Why does he looks like Shakespeare
Who disliked tf??
Who else realize he changed the name from "The Hacksmith" to "Hacksmith Industries
Big F for the play button
Now id like to take a minute just sit right there imma tell you now to give respect to that mans hair   That was my atempt at being funny. And i apologize
Thousand degree knife challenge EXTREME++++++
He really looks like captain america that just got found
Ya know what I don't think you hear this enough  Thank you for inspiring me to become a maker
Plasma lightsaber is the best project ever!
The channel grows proportionally to your beard

He sounds like a droid with the mask on😂
My favourite all time invention is the electromagnetic shield one day I hope to build it myslef well when I can afford it 😅
Why is the playbutton coloured now? Could it be some transparent oxide layer interfering with light just like bubbles do?
Keep up making awesome vids and imagine 20M+ subs
The lightsaber is a big step to a good future
I am not subscribed but i still watched the Hole video;)
WOW
Why did he do this? 😪
Yo listen Tom.btw is ur name Tom? Anyways people gonna have their opinion on some things anyways. Just make sure u do what u wanna do not what people are telling u to do — pewdiepie
Pleas build noisy boy
I guess the clicking the subscribe button at the end, should also be updated to Hacksmith Industries and that it changes to 10 mil once it is clicked on !
I love your videos.

You sir are amazing! Keep up the great work I'm fairly new here but I've watched your videos all the way through and I can not wait to see you do this!!
Oh shit, Jesus has a light saber.

This is a big achievement for you
hi i love you vids ( : and will sell iron man stuff ?
Everyone after you make a giant company less based on YouTube would probably mention quite often how you started as a YouTuber.
Why do youtube recommend this to me-
You inspire me to become an engineer when I grow up, ever since i saw your first thors 300V capacitor hammer i realize what i wanted to do
HE JUST GOT A DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON AND BODIED IT FOR US!!!!!!
A play button for views
hacksmith just melt his 10,000000 sub dimond
I hope part of Phase 3 is a life size full functional Mechagodzilla.
I will support the hack smith in every way I can I will like every video I watch from you guys I’m going to give positive feedback all the time.
You should make: the diamond play button into a shield
This is so awesome. Even I have a plan to help humanity grow. It would be a dream come true to work with you some day. Keep up the good work and the master plan. All the best hacksmith. 😁
12:30 OMG He isn't Tony Stark He is the Winter solider 😱
You could make a video about saving a million baby's lives, and still people would complain and give you a thumbs down. From the wise words of Homer Simpson, "It's because they're stupid. That's why everyone does everything, because they're stupid." Not to mention the words of Coco Chanel. "I don't care what you think of me, because I don't think of you at all."
The hacksmith : I have a new religion Us : What is it ? The hacksmith : Hacksmith Industries Research Campus Us : IM INTERESTED  Also, you should contact Dassault Systèmes. They really are into collaborations for innovations and Im pretty sure you would be able to get something out of it
case hardened play button (blue gem)
And some time I dream of doing collaboration on discord or a game known as Rec room and my user name is Galaxy fox 999
15:42 Lightsaber Wins.
This channel is amazing it has inspired me. I'm actually in the process of making a exoskeleton for my engineering Major project.

Thanks for inspiring me all these years. When I have my own channel up and running, you and Grant will be part of the reason I got there.
The likes are deserved
YouTube didn’t put this on trending because of him destroying his play button lol 😂
The channel is like your facial and head hair, it grew... and grew.... and grew

As long as you are not retiring, iam happy 😀❤️🔥👍
Ha A powerful lightsaber could have have choped it in half in just 1 second
Your grand plan makes me happy
Jedi be like: OMG, he is holding the diamond play button shield in his arm! We can't defeat him in under 30 minutes and by that time his reinforcements will arrive!
Please cantenu the cooking with Hacksmet
Dear hacksmith industries. If you really do want to change the world one step at a time then i have an idea. Im not sure if this is a thing or not but make a special blow up cast that can support broken limbs or stop blood flow in wounds.
I haven't been watching your channel for that long but it's been a great ride over these last three years watching your team's channel. The first time I saw you was the first gen Exo suit, curling the four cinderblocks, on that old science channel with 20 great inventions (I'm sorry the name is failing me). Colin Furze has been on it probably three times now?
You know we Will all keep helping you to make your and other dream real keep the good work
14:20 how many kill did you got that to unlock that playbutton skin?
He is the chosen one he will bring balance
If your house ever burns down at least your diamond play button will remain intact...
Spiderman 2( 2004). Alfred Molina,  Doctor octopus.  That's all i have to say! Do it!
I love your videos James I hope you can do even more in the future it blows my mind how you can do these amazing videos keep it up James

I've been watching your channel for almost 3 years now and looking back at your videos, I already watched every single uploads hehe. Don't mind the negativity as long as you enjoy what your doing, keep on pushing! Your projects back then were small-scale but now, the projects are insane!!! Seeing you and Ian looking for a new site got me excited for your future projects! Few years ago, I can name all the members of the team but now I haven't had the chance to know all of them lol but still, It's a good thing because it simply means that the team grew! Keep up the good work James, Ian, Bogdan, and the whole Hacksmith Industries!
can you please ban that person that is trying to link porn?
12:40 is what your looking for
should definitely display it with an orange LED in the center to replicate the heat
I love your videos

“to show you the power of flex tape, i cut this play button in half”
the blue one looks so dope
But that beard tho
i love you i hope for the best
youtube better give you another play button
Is he dead? Sorry 😔
His tech will revolutionary for the world
James dont fu**ing care about negative  comments they are just jealous because of you being successful and sorry because of f word I was a little bite angry
end project : the first time a person almost melted theyre table by trying to cut a play button that is now the coolest thing ive ever seen
Whatever Hacksmith does. Whatever Hacksmith says.    There's not a single moment when I do not think of him as:    Jesus.
The MasterPlan phase 2 sounds incredible, and I am really excited to see where it goes!   Not sure if you are aware, but in the UK we have a number of "catapult" centres where businesses that are working at the forefront of technology can collaborate and seek funding (such as the Advanced Material Research Centre, Offshore Renewable Catapult, and a few others). It may be worth exploring them as part of your international ambitions?
You shud make a play Button with your logo and the play Button needs to be made out of tunxston
I love watching your videos, it inspires me to build so many things.
You are a living legend. Stuff those haters, they're just jealous zealots.
I assume you bought another diamond play button
In a way I think that the hacksmith will find a way to make life size holograms first maybe
Jacksucksatlife:  OH GOD NO PLEASE STOP
YouTube : Oh congrats you have tons of subs :D Hacksmith : let's cut it in half :D YouTube : May I introduce, the T-800 :)   Me : Comment YouTube : Terminate my comment
And this has taught me the only diamond part of the diamond play button is actually the play icon
12:22
You always amaze me with every project you do WELL DONEE
Can u give a small diamond one to @jacksucksatlife
you should recreate naryas particle cannon with plasma in stead of a lazer
So is it possible to get the blade even hotter so it would slice things like they do in the movies?
You inspired me all the way from germany
Hi,  The Hacksmith. I've got a challenge for you. I want you to make REAL Doctor Octopus or Iron Spider arms. Make It Real.
You are  so mach deserv this playbutton
YouTube gives diamond play button   Hacksmith -- Let's LightSaber it     YouTube -- *bald man meme*
Well said James and good on you for stepping up and wanting to make your mark on the world.  Have considered the Hacksmith to be a team for a while now and thats a positive. Keep up the good work, take a break every now and then and enjoy life. Its all a journey that we are happy to share. Respect.
Youtube's Gonna kill u for that James

When your like button is glitched on a Hacksmith Industries video
for next video you should make thrusters of iron man
Screw the trolls. What you do / have done is nothing short of inspirational. You and people like you and your team are pushing boundaries forward. We love you.
But this, this puts a smile on my face.
👏

Moral of the story: If someone is coming at you with a lightsaber hide behind a diamond play button
It's been amazing seeing your journey. Thank you for sharing your vision for the channel and your future
Jacksucksatlife is very sad now
Imagine being told what to do by a guy who looks like steve rogers and owns around 4 lightsabers.

I really love your plan and is really interesting what you are doing. I hope you can achieve that and more good luck
Hacksmith: Sees a diamond playbutton Also hacksmith: He's too dangerous to be left alive!

Dude we need another cooking show episode
There will always be people in the comments complaining  & Thats called bullshitting   You don't have to  prove anything  to them or even listen to them  just do what, feel right to you
I swear this guys entire life is like one of those afk mobile games   Gather resources, build bigger, repeat
have you thought of making smaller projects like Adam's one day builds but make it Hacksmith?
I love your videos and Plz make a love   weapon love you guy’s
please trim ur beard
"you can see this play button is fresh, because we are not at 11 million yet"   Me: checks and sees Hacksmith is at 10.8 already..
Yayaay another video. :D
You are so bad man
You should totally turn the left over metal into a diamond sword from minecraft.
I'm pretty impressed with how resilient that thing was. I expected it to melt within 30 seconds
I could not love this channel more. They should just keep doing what they’re doing because it’s perfect. It’s amazing what they’ve built and how many people they’ve inspired. They shouldn’t change anything.
Youtube punching the air right now
Will YouTube give u another playbotton for this
I want to be a enjerner
Does anyone see a mandalorian on his logo
4:18 69% perter griffin laugh
15 years later: Building an irl helicarrier

you areas insane and amazing
IVE WATCHED ALL HIS VIDEOS FROM WHEN HE WAS IN HIS HOUSE GARAGE AND HE STILL HAD GREAT CONTENT
Me on my way to find the person who hated!
love the plan and what you are doing, but damm cutting that pains me
You should make the electric wipes form iron man 2
Okay..... I know many people like destruction But the gases from that molten metal, could be toxic It was good that James wore that mask, but the others were at great risk like Ian and cameraman And also the gases were released in the atmosphere So u should take some steps for that
lets give him the support
Reply if u read ps BensterTV is a great YouTuber
I bet if he continues like this he is gonna have 100s of labours working for him and he is gonna be like a CEO. so yeah he is gonna be a millionaire or something more
In 20 years the title of the videos are gonna be tera forming mars with elon musk
Amazing ideas ❤
Yu are souv cool love yu so mač
why u so funny
14:50 red diomand play button lol
But why...
Damn they make those playbuttons strong
12:42  do not mention it
Been watching this channel for years. I love the message in this video, you are one of the rare youtubers, you want to help people, not for personal gain, but because you want to inspire people.   Congrats on 10 million
I dont care what anyone says. I havnt been a fan long but the crazy things you and your team come up with are mfantastic and deserve recignition around the world. You defy modern science and its some of the coolest things ive ever seen. Keep at the greatness you do!!
A leave joe
I love this so channel so much it is soooo inspiring to see. I remember watching the first captain America shield video and it blow me away and as I grow this channel grow with me and so proud of the hacksmith channel good job guys
this so exciting
You absolutely smashed that inspiration goal dude. You are one of the main reasons that I want to take up engineering, and I'm pretty sure that will be my career In the future. You have showed me that making and creating things is awesome, so thanks for the inspiration. I just hope that my grades are decent enough to make the job tho lol.
12:22
Ive been here since 4.3k i suported the channel and ive beem proud ofnit for this hole time and felt someny of the projects in the channel it was amazing i was proud of u guys for the button but no i cant just watch this happend and let it slide ok i know ur meanings but i feel offended by it this was wrong good bye hacksmith ive been here for a long time but this is were i have  to cut my line bye
Is it me or am I the only one who  thinks that after it's started turning organge it looked better then the "default" one
I think the only YouTuber thats similar to you guys may be colinfurze. However hacksmith industries is pretty advanced.
This video was posted 10m      No but what the hell? Gg on 10m
After YouTube seeing this YouTube: WHAT THE F***
am i the only one who thinks james sounds like a droid from the clone wars in that mask, at least a little
Why do they seem like they dont really care about the diamond play button
In ten years the title is gonna be make a real death star
Maybe jeff Bezos can help you w this
Why would you do this?!
My brain is so happy seeing that
make an actual rocket and launch it to space with a go pro
why
If you are seeing this              great job
Your ambition and determination is unmatched. Keep going. Hacksmith industries will change the world
JediWay>FengShui. That is actually a pretty dope/inadvertently visually appealing result, definitely alot better than most who decide to use their channels main focus to mess with the awards
Tell me who else can say that they sawed their diamond play button in half with a light saber
yay i managed to get a mini play button before they went out of stock
Imagine Hacksmith Industries sells military weapons in the future for example lightsabers and 4 winged jets 🤔
10:05  ....so yeah that's the plan ,I hope you like it if not that's okay , it's my plan not yours... Me:Are YOu Kidding me? I like every single thing you do and that's the result of being inspired  for life by you
But the playbutton stood a lot better than the blastshield
You may have done it already but it’d be really cool to see the retractable blade from assassins creed
Hacksmith: to bring a group of remarkable people   Me: I see what went for there nice
Youtube anticipated that this might happen, so they made Hacksmith's Play Button more durable the others so that it wouldn't be that easy to break and boring
Please tell me you bought a new one to destroy.
"Will shatter into a million pieces? Will it melt? Lets find oout"
:P I love your videos for real
I like to eat my diamond play button 👩‍🍳
Great vid, love the plans to come
should of gone threw the core of the play button. would of been so cool
May i suggest something dor your next project? I recomend something from 40k, like a Chainsword, or a bolter
Average youtuber: I will keep my playbutton reward on a shelf as a part of interior Hacksmith: What if I cut it in half???
This shit got deep
Your lightsaber was truly very cool and I was very excited to see one u are the best man 😁😉
honestly you would make an amazing school principal.
guess the lumberjack personal trainer industry dont pay too well? ;)
YouTube should make a blue play button because it looked so cool
thats a 1000 degre knife but hoter ı love it
Awesome!!!
Ayyy will smith
I love you guys! Keep creating🤘
You know what you should make real that cooking show lol.
The history part made me cry
Fu©k yeah James!!!!
Hacksmith at 2050. Ok let's go mars
I'm no maker.  And I lack engineering skill.  But wish I could make a hovercraft street legal car.  And an ultralight airplane.  Maybe Hacksmith Industries can make the car?
Awesome
Stay bold Hacksmith! People will always have things to say but what really matters is what you feel about what you do, not about what they have to say. Hope to meet a legend one day that's always been within you.
Whoever down voted has no soul
“I get to be set on fire regularly” So casual
No pls I don't wanna see more yt break thier diamond play button ;-;
I was about to ask you if you could make the slinger from monster hunter... But hell nah imma make it by myself, because you and your team is an infinite source of inspiration
You realy made me cry behind my screen that was the most beautiful motivation I've ever heard
Now.. touch it
Wonder if YT will give another Diamond playbutton
Why all the YouTuber want to break that
I live in Sweden 👍
am I the only one that cried with this ?
Giving away a BURNED mace windu lightsaber, selling a piece of scrap, what was cutted out with the first lightsaber, and now destroying the bigest youtube award? I dont know man, but i think, its just a little bit too far...
Dude it sounds like you want to cry, but i feel that shows your blood sweat and tears and effort you put into your industry, I love it and you better love yourself
just thinking about a coop with you and Adam Savage... :) have a good day and btw great Video
Good job dude
YouTube should make it an option to have the play button be pre-burned. Because that looked fricken awesome.
great shef
People always get angry at everything if you wanna take a break from work, we very much support you
I am happy for you James and don't pay attention to the people hating we all know how dedicated you are though  I think you were trying to do a ritual or something  and the sacrifice was the diamond playbutton
Hacksmith i know you are not going to read these comments loke this but when i first knew about youtube you are first youtuber i saw and i loved your vids and started watching your videos for 5 years and one day tried make something like you make but i dont know anything about this but anyways you really inspired me to do stuff.and thanks for that

We love you please don’t let the haters get to you there are more of us
I swear when he showed the scene in the past He looks now like a lion roar XD And for all those who complain Do it like me be quit and click away if the video doesn't wake up your interest
Why you destorys the play button???
That playbutton looked like the gates to hell
I love the idia of superhero fiutere i no jou can make superheros and can i bi one 😁😁😁😁
Please use the lightsaber on a unbreakable box it will melt so easily😂
What people disliked this video   shame
I have a question what are peoples problems with the stuff you do just because you put your employees in danger every once in a while doesn't mean you do bad videos I love your videos and the projects you work on and I wish I could work for you but I'm 15 and I live the U.S. so not feasible for me but I hope you and your team could do even more awesome projects and I am curious on how the power loader is doing and peace
Made me tear up😢 I love your vids!!!
Who is grant Thompson?

greatest spetch👑
Youtube: sends diamond play button...  Hacksmith: Thanks!! Now let's cut our diamond play button!!  Youtube: 👁️👄👁️
Dont do that nooo
You know most of your projects can destroy mankind
I liket
Considering so much of this channels popularity came from Iron man related stuff, it might be nice to repurpose some of that play button melt-off into something for the suit you're building out piece by piece. Just so a piece of this is forever part of that suit.
Cooking a diamond play button that's crazy awesome
If Iron Man isn't real why do you make gadgets to be like him?
Why cut you life time achievement
Will support you always!
Hacksmith: burning the play button is a good idea for a video  Youtube: you can only get another one if you get  another 1000000 subscribers  Fans: no problem
You inspierd me to build a captian america shield and a thor hammer
As much as I love this guy I am raising a vote : Trim back to the early days of your channel
There will always be naysayers and those who'll say you're wrong about something, they're just the ones who want to hold you down and say 'it's impossible'. You and your team just have to keep pushing on and making things; let nothing stop you!
why did you do that was a beautiful DIMOND  play button :(
Year 2035 exist you made a stark tower made mark 85 made super soldier serum etc
Why ???
I thought it was already called Hacksmith Industries
But why why would you do that
Your Next model needs to have a retractable tungsten rod in the middle of the plasma stream to give it a physical cutting edge
These videos makes me do more experiments!!! Really cool though!!!😀👍🏻
James it's your life! Don't mind all the haters or "smart" nagging comments, everybody is an expert in the comment section, everywhere. To be honest I did not expect this heart to heart but thanks for sharing, glad that I watched it. If you ever build a branch of HI in Slovakia I'll join hehe.  The play button changing the colors looked amazing I though ok stop now don't cut it in half it looks great for display :D
doesn't melting chrome plating release mercury vapour into the air which can kill you almost instantly???
Man I loooove this also they are making great stuff who knows maybe in the future there will be ironman suits protecting the world I have a good idea it feels like they are going to be the Wayne industries of Gotham for the Stark industries of New York. I feel good about the hack Smith and feel like it's gonna be the top industry of the world keep up the good work  I will subscribe now
Haksmith is like the avangers

YouTube: Congrats Hacksmith  Hacksmith: Lets break it  YouTube: Wait what.... This is why we cant have nice things
Hacksmith, I don't usually comment on videos, but I want you to know that I've been on this journey with you for very long time and I had always been amazed by your work. You deserve to have break once in a while. You are awsome, I'd love to be like you. Keep it up please!

I love this ❤️
you are the most hardworking youtuber i have ever seen good luck for more 1000 years of hacksmith industries love from INDIA
I would love to see a collab with Alex Lab. But damn it made me sad when he brought up Grant, and still made an inspirational video❤
It's turning blue like a real diamond
You should take the metal and make one or two small playbuttons out of that.
YouTube be like  Why the fuck did we give him  The button
Make it stronger like x2 of the amount
Someone should send this to jacksucksatlife
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Good job dude
I love you hacksmit we love you
You are crazy I like that
You are awesome
You have a nice kitchen...
This channel has made me the best and even like James thank you hack smith for all that you do
Bro try and partner with Marvel. Don't get me wrong. You will not have to pay any money, you will just have to make something which you always do. You will get free advertisement and your subscribers will multiply.
Love the videos, love your plan, love your content, keep it up guys and gals at Hacksmith Industries! Also don't listen to the haters and trolls out there because there just  jelly. Not even the good kind either.
I wanna see youtube response to this? can anyone tag them?
Can you make docter octo your videos are amazing
You just are the best   You inspired me forever    I hope I can meet you  someday   I know exactly how you feel about wanting to change the world(this very vulnerable blue one , it needs you)and I know you will
This Chanel is bigger than Colin furze's now
After watching this video i am expecting more awesome projects from your channel 💙 i love all your videos. Keep working and don't bother about negativity..😁
Reply with f for the play button

here for the lazy people 12:22
Imagine Elon Musk and the Hacksmith working together
This is so weird! I swear that this was my master plan too for when I would have a company!!!!! I'm so haaappyy for you the Hacksmith and the Hacksmith team!!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I love your plan, I cant believe how much this channel has evolved. I know you most probably won't read this but I am actually studying to be an engineer, your inspiring goals are what engineering and making life better for people is all about and I was wondering if in a few years I could work with you? This was my dream since my 10 year old self first discovered this channel
“What about the droid attack on the wookies?
I don't usually buy YouTuber merch, but for you, I'll make an exception.
Wow !
you have been one of my favourite youtuber and probably the only one.
4:47 DAM THATS A THICC ASS BEARD
James sounded like a droid from Star Wars when melting the play button.
"Mandatory Algorithm Comment" for Qwazar-kun
You starting to look like the oliver queen when he was on the island
These people inspire me every day to try and make anything possible
Starts at 12:40
im a pretty new subscriber (2018) but i still like to support  you
14:03 you should’ve just let it that way that looks super cool
YouTube: 😰😰😭😠😠😡😤👿🤬
That can melt the heart of a devil
Massive Biceps

Or the whole armor and the guns.
We love you man. You do what we dream of
Fan from Nepal
Why do you cut that it was a medal 🏅 for your hardwork 🤔 but it was fun
YouTube is doing the Mike Wazowski face swap right now.
Do HellBoy's gun from movies
I'm feeling bad now for the last videos's comment. Good job Hacksmith Industries, you guys are deserved that play button!
I love your plans. We support you man. Just follow your dreams
I a geek happy
All you people who write complaining comments, or rude ones at that, I can't believe any of you. This guys has been here for more than a decade, creating items that only existed in movies, or comics, or even cartoons! He created an actual Stormbreaker Axe, a Civil Warrior shield, even a mini-sized cybertruck! Not all of us Human beings can do what he can. None of us have his special skill and abilitiy to make us feel amazing, or to show us that almost everything is possible. He is special in his own unique way, and that way is that he tells us that doing this lightsaber, or shield, or the axe, it's not one man working alone. Even the richest and smartest man in the world could not do this by himself. So please stop writing negative comments and appreciate what The hacksmith has done. I love this channel and I always will. It has accomplished 10.8 million subs, a thing only a quarter of the people in this world can do. He worked hard and look what he accomplished.
gratz on getting  0.8M more subs :D
Make hulk buster
i just wanted to skip the first part but just could not do it.
F for diamond play button

Hacks smith: The playbutton turned blue..  YouTube: That's the 500 million subscriber plaque
Love the speech
Yeah man you got it
I have a question does your small scale tesla cyber truck have gears or does it work on acceleration
I'm still thinking.        Y?!?!?
Oh boi,  you made me sick 😂, love your vids
For those who like to complain just shut up haters
What these guys do is great and I love watching how they do these things, but why does every piece to camera have to sound so rehearsed instead of just speaking to the camera naturally
Hack smith been hittin the gym 💪🏽💪🏽
Awesome man, you should be so proud. I admire what you do and you have inspired me to look into engineering. After Covid, I think you would take a break because you deserve it.
Hacksmith: **burns the diamond play button** Youtube: * you weren't supposed to do that*
U are a legend
Arent u happy with the playbutton?????
"I think this is better than a regular playbutton."  - The Hacksmith 2020

I loved the cooking bit, I hope to see more. Congrats on the success and I wish you the best of luck with your future plan
Howtobasic: *Saves Diamond Playbutton* Hacksmith: *Cooks it with pepper and salt*

4:18 wow nice dude 69% more watch time!
This is what happens when you love your work more than achievments. And your plan is great.
😭😭
As emotional as this video went i wanted to write something emotional but i have nothing much to say  I've been watching this channel for years (im deff not  the early subscriber) I had a dream to become a mechanical engineer because i love machines but i ended up taking computer science and had to adjust for that and move on with them. Since i found this channel it made me live that dream of machine nerd  And i loved every single creation of yours. Thank you
I’ve been watching almost since you first started, so this was amazing to me. I can’t wait to watch more videos and to think one day you could start this huge international business and be there since the start is amazing! I love your videos!!
In the future they build yets without wings and not a rocket
Noo DON’T DO IT
What you have done.
Nobody The Hacksmith after making a lightsaber : haha destroying things go brrrrrrr     Tho ngl I would probably do the same
I didn't think he would really cut the real play button
Love your content. Would be great to show your team the ultimate respect and offer them all ownership opportunity in Hacksmith Industries. You can't do it without them, so they deserve equal representation inside the company.
Hacksmith.... al i have to say is, good job. Just, good job. Continue and grow as you go and i'll follow you.
I believe that there will be SUPERHEROES  and im sure that they will wear your own made suits
when actually watching the history and future of hacksmith industries I realized that hacksmith industries will probably still exist when I am an adult
12:22
This gonna be on jacksucksatlife subreddit
James, bro please have a nice haircut asap
The world lost an awesome and inspiring man when we lost Grant Thomson of TKOR
This really inspired me thank you keep doing the good that you do. ive been watching sence 750,000 subs so you got this

14:16 My man made the Damascus Camo play button
Hacksmith Industries buys more space. Does this mean that there will be new job offers over the next year?
theres a reason hes growing out his beard i just know it.
Came for the lightsaber. Stayed for the story.
You guys are a amazing set of people who inspire people everyday stay awesome.
I can't stop laughing at the CGI kitchen in the background of the cooking segment 🤣
Nononono
This thing is *STURDY*
I definitely see u changing the world bro 💯
Here are some ideas: Real The Mandalorian Helmet Sithlightning-Glove Magna-Guard(?)-Fighting-Stick
There is no way you can't tell me that this is just like a scene from Iron man 2 when he trys to make the new element
I’ve been here since the exoskeleton build  or the fire sword, idk what was first, great to see this Chanel grow
I am one of the people who watched your beautiful speech. I can't just stop crying, I wish you best.
This... this is so wholesome.
Hack Smith: The fresh Prince of real destroying
I was at bright Day and i still have the picture with you was a dream comming out to meet you
I think it’s really cool what you’re doing. Promise you won’t end up making another ultron like tony?
Almost 11 million
Thats a lot of propane
Congrats!
Looks like YouTube doesn’t skimp on those play buttons
Yo
Hey Hacksmith love your vids been watching for a few years now keep up the good work. Much love man. You and your team are an always will be awesome.
Poor button   I watched from start to finish
it turning orange is it bleeding lot like in star wars where you bleed the crystals to make them red
I didn’t skip to 12:22 I stayed because I wanted to bro...
I am gonna pursue engineering and join u one day I promise
One day we'll tell our kids we help support that man and we new him before all of this
I hope your inventions do not get into the wrong hand.
So dimb
Damn this hits hard, watched since 2015ish, barely anything but crazy to see what you have accomplished...
To be honest , I had just watched a few of your videos earlier , but today , SALUTE!! . This was amazing , how did you manage to decide to cut the play button ? That would have been a scary decision . But amazing ..... loved the content   Keep turning fiction to reality!!  It inspires many young minds such as myself . Thank you
I dont mean yo be mean but does it make sound? If so what kind of sound?
Why be tony stark when u can be better?
I literally got tears...😭😭 All the best And keep inspiring
He looks like the cool uncle that is good at everything
Nice job dude on your work keep up the good work hope you get to 20mil
tank you so much for making these videos you really have changed my life just by making this content
It will be cool if you could make a lightsaber keeping the fuel bottle attached to your hand using a belt instead of a bag
Good luck
This inspires me lol
Why did you do that it is apart of your channel's history! Not complaining just worried.
Was it only me who heard that there was happy crying in his voice
Just curious. Are those real lightsaber sounds or is it just edited it?
You should make a Jet-Pack like Boba Fett's.
You've come a long way and the videos are always so interesting
Hey, can you make a human robot???
0:55 RAID SHADOW LEGENDS

Normal People receive diamond play button = Keep it and treasure it Hacksmith = lets cut it in half!
We all are always with you james ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dam thats 3 000$ you just broken thats so cool
So when can I apply to Hacksmith University?
12:29 You remind me of the Winter Soldier😂
I rekon youtube made this button extra durable because they knew you would do this.
14:30 I wish that's what the diamond play button looked like
U guys are crazy 😂😂😱😱😵. You inspired us all and deserve more than ten million subs. I hope that this channel grows bigger because the world needs people like you. 😉🗺️😇👍🏾
YouTube : waits it's all roasted diamond botton  Hacksmith (with light saber ) : Always has been
12:22 🙂
He made a damascus play button
Normal Youtuber: hang their playbutton up on the wall  Hacksmith: I saw this playbutton in half
Am I the only one who wants to see a lightsaber fight even though I’m pretty sure that’s not possible
This is prob one of the best 10 mill appreciation posts of all time
I'm tearing up rn, what a great speech.
The light saber vid must be in the rewind
12:22
In Avengers Infinity War,   Thanos: *"You have my respect James."*
You work really hard and I appreciate that
u wot?
This video do be kind of 😔
Maybe YouTube has tried cutting a play button with a lightsaber  before, so they know what to do to prevent it from being easy to burn with a lightsaber
Bro, I f u want to help the world become a super. It's not like I don't have the equipment
love the cooking show
we love you James. You're doing amazing man wow
Don't feel bad and bring yourself down about the negative comments, especially on youtube as I've seen the most heartwarming videos get hundreds of dislikes, some people really have nothing better to do than be that critic nobody likes. You're doing amazing things most people could only dream of and jealousy is one of humanity's most caustic traits. Like Elon, you're bridging what people once thought impossible and sharing it on youtube for everyone to see weekly,  that takes determination and courage.
You I’ve been watching this ever since the kings-man video of the umbrella, true og
Rest in peace Grant
I remember the old shop
Побрейся
Make Thor's hammer using electromagnet please 🤗🤗
Javksucksatlife is currently in tears
Dude.... Did they really cut a diamond play button😳
No plzz no
Commenting on something is easy but doing it is hard
It looks like more of a rainbow play button now, like if u agree
Whatever it takes
Next update to the lightsaber, somehow make it duelable
Watch. Hacksmith industries is going to make some battery that can power the lightsaber yet will fit in your pocket. That is sorta what I can imigine seeing this company doing in the field of science and engineering.
The Hacksmith asserts dominance over youtube by slicing the diamond play button in half
THE PRINCE SONGGGGGG.(The remake)
if you skipped the story you are evil, that was beautiful.
yayaya Hacksmith reached 10 Million subscribers!!!!!!!
Wow I didn’t even realize how big this channel is and I have massive respect for you guys and the true king of random, thank you for trying hard and making a difference and I would join that university and I love your plan and your outlook on society
I remember when he was at only a couple thousands of subs and it was just as good as it is today. Love your vids and they are very inspiring!
well done on 10,000,000 subs, you absolutely deserve it! btw, love the pop culture references
this made a grown man cry
Don't listen to the haters focus on what you want to do and try to enjoy it and like you said in the video that's their opinion even those standards can go away as long as you think what you're doing is right do what makes you happy
Love you Hacksmith❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Long-time fan here! ❤💯
Hacksmith Industries      *[SUBSCRIBED]* 10,8M subscriber
This makes a real life howard stark
Thanks for sharing your story, you are an inspiration. And great motivator. Keep up the great work!!
I think you are the father of the future. Who with me?
I'm impressed that thing lasted so long
I nearly cried wtf You're inspiring beyond measure, James!
YouTube: spends a lot of Time to make a diamond play button Hack smith:Burns it with a saber YouTube :imma end this man’s whole career      Just kidding
Your videos are just *"amazing."*
I have a feeling you and your team will make it I  the history books
YouTube watching this be like: 👁💧👄💧👁
Youtube after this video: Make sure that this guys doesn't get another prize..     Just kidding :p Btw, will hacksmith Industries start outsourcing in India in the next 4 years? I will be completing my bachelor's degree in cse by then and of course, I want an oppurtunity to work with James. I would be the most remarkable moment in my life if I get to work with him someday....
Can u make a glove with retractable wolverine claws an assassin creed s retractable blade with captain America s retractable shield on it will be soo cool
I love your vids keep going and keep inspiring everyone and me
Do a draw my life!!!
You are the best person in the world
you have a crazy plan for the future......Looking forward to it
Jacksucksatlife gonna be pissed
this is a wonderful situation
Damn this got emotional, you can see in his eyes how important Grant was for him
Yep,Im inspired by Bogden .👍👍
Damn, for a few seconds he had a sapphire play button
i watched the whole playlist and enjoyed it a whole lot since i'm a much more recent subscriber all i didnt get was the last video, that one was weird to me somehow
Haaaaaaaaaaa
hey tell us what you do when you run out of ideas.
haters heck off
I think this channel is the most of hard working channel. The most important is his team
Imagine his mom realizing that when her son told her he was going to be a super hero when he grows up, it was for real
I don’t think YouTube expected you to do this when they sent it to you...
Hey Hacksmith Team, thanks for doing the amazing work that you do to not only entertain but inspire the creativity and ingenuity of minds around the world. I dont comment on videos very often, even for YouTube channels that I've been following for years like "Hacksmith Industries", but the speech in this video hit me hard. I used to want to be a mechanical engineer, and after lots of hard decision making, I made my way into medicine. I'm now half way through medical school and also starting my own clinical research trial on mindfulness. The passion that the Hacksmith team has for all of its projects is something that inspires me to keep asking hard questions and to learn as much as I can about the body and how to help others improve their lives through healthy living. Thank you for your contributions to the world and to the creators that inhabit it. Im eager to see what comes next :)
Jesus Christ is hack smith
12:22
You do an awesome job, so keep doing what you do.
Youtube is watching and saying, "WHAT THE HELL! Did we give that to you for this!"
Why?
You are probably gonna get these a lot but in the off chance you see this comment  GG hacksmith and crew  I hope you manage to achieve all of your goals, business ideas and projects.  Until then keep up the AMAZING work, I'm rooting for you.👍👍👍
james make a liquid nitrogen thrower
U can take superchat from us
Hacksmith i have a question. Since you said you wanted to help society ans make it easier for us humans to live. Would u be considered into combining your tech with medicine and help cure or prevent diseases in the future?
Holy shit James your heart to heart made me tear up a bit.
Your work is really inspiring. You are the real Iron Man bro but I have to point out one thing, you kinda look like Daniel Bryan 😅🤣
12:22
Now this is a story all about how, my life just turned upside down 😂 nice
I would love to work for you one day.... your truly inspirational
I’m so down. Been following for years, I’m so proud of you. All of you. Great mind, great guy. Keep it real, man!
The success u know the struggle u don't kno
YouTube Watching the play button being destroyed: 👁👄👁🧍🏿‍♂️
Making green goblin jet glider
* 50 years later * we built a dyson sphere around Beatle juice!
for the algorythm
In this video we sowed this Boat in half
Imagine getting the diamond play button and then immediately trying to melt it in half
You are the best
I'm a subscriber for 4 years now your content it's amazing everything you do is amazing i love every video make
Me : when gets the play button: I am gonna frame it!  Hacksmith: let's cut it in half for some stupid reason
Youtube: Congrats on 10 million subs here is your diamond playbutton  the hacksmiths: yeah, lets cook it and slice it with a lightsaber
at 14:22 i wish i had one but in that color
This is quite the one up from Pewdiepie accidentally breaking his diamond play button.
D:
That cooking Show was awesome😂
Love you
I'm in the middle of the video now, I hope I didn't watch anyone crying in this video 😅 james seems emotional now, hehe
I like how you turned the channel into a buisiness. You are not only making your hobby profitable, you are also passing your skills off to other people.
Take a break for yourself sometimes 👍🏻 take care
James y would u do that
The 1st n only roasted diamond cooking show.yet
Why would you destroy that?? 😩😩
Your words are coming straight out of your heart ❤️
You shuld make your own 10 mil play button out of the destroyed one
Might have just been my hearing but James your voice sounded a little wobbly Almost like you where gonna shed a tear or two might have been mishearing but if ya where let it out next time will probably feel better for doing it (or might not I don’t know your opinion on crying)
BRO WHATEVER U DO WE WOULD WATCH IT........ GO AHEAD DO WHAT YOU WISH...WE WILL BACK UP
You can do everything with you and your team. your the best
Spending years to get 10 mil subs then just burning the play button
"We don't have 11 million subscribers yet."  That was a close call.
You can call a pen a sword but it doesn't make it a sword.
Crazy
Bro every one say do best but you do your greatest
I can’t wait for them to do Mandolin armor with gadgets.
This warmed my heart
Feeled like he was going to 😭
"we don't have 11 million subscribers yet" give it a couple more hours
Is it just me, or does he sold like a B1 battledroid with that gas mask on? 😂
That play button took way longer to cut than I thought it would.
I can’t wait for them to do Mandolin armor with gadgets.
I AM DOWN TO TEARSS..........*clap clap *1/0*
I made a sling shot yesterday!
He is definitely growing his hair out for something. Like a costume for a build their doing. Or something like that
Wow
Other youtubers when they finally get a diamond play button: uses gloves in order not to get even their fingerprints on it The hacksmith: lets cut it in half!
Your team and you are great
It was really nice to know about your hardwork  Keep growing and keep inspiring people around the globe   Congratulations for 10million   All the best for you, your team and hacksmith industries.BTW loved your cyber truck build
Love from Germany
When he was talking about Grant you can really hear the sadness in his voice, and I know a lot of used to watch his videos all the time and miss them a lot but I have no idea how it is to loose someone your so close to and has taught you so much. I don't know where I'm going with this but I guess don't let the haters get to you.
You are amazing and a true inspiration
Your plan is admirable
loves your all projects bro.keep  it up..who knows maybe one day i join your team..!!
I have really loved your work almost since the beginning and also amazed by your goals and happy that you are not going to stop making these amazing awesome jaw dropping videos. Hope one day you will reach your goals and we get a chance to work with you. Sending best wishes and very productive years ahead friends👍👍🤟🤘🤟🤟
Hacksmith, is really great, been a fan since years, and what you are doing is the peak of creativity, thanks for all the great moments.
Make a small anvil out of the playbutton. The hacks smith, if you will.
Im a fan since 200k subs!!!!  more power hacksmith. greetings from the philippines
Listening to your speech, I could hear the pain but importantly the passion. We love you, and the rest of the Hacksmiths. Please, keep doing what your doing. You inspire me and the world to build, experiment, and engineer with our world. Trust me, and your subscribers, we've got your back. For every 1 hater, you have 1000 fans. We love you guys.
This whole video gave me chills. Keep innovating, and keep inspiring, Hacksmith Industries!
I wonder how long can u make it to
Good luck!! Bro for the future
Hacksmith: "see's a play button" Also Hacksmith: NOW THIS IS AN AVENGERS LEVEL THREAT
This lightsaber is what they will use in a live action Star Wars movie
Congrats bro on the Diamond play button! You totally deserve it! I could feel that emotion in your speech! :)
I can't remember when I found this channel but it was definitely before infinity war and I loved it, seeing you hitting 10 million subs and seeing your plan for the future makes me very excited to see what's going to happen
SPOILER!!!     I haven't watched the video yet.
Just to let you know that people might bring you down but you really do give those 99% a hope to go and try to do something you love. People who see these videos and say negative things cannot even think of doing something like this. Keep up this good work, and always know this that irrespective of fields of someone's work, you just prove that if you are willing and hardworking, anything is possible. Thanks for making me believe in myself.   I always had a question that why are you not making products for commercial use or do companies come to get something made from you? or DIY products that teach people what you do but at a smaller scale? or it's just Youtube?
2025:This is hack smith And I made a IRON MAN SUIT!!!
Other Youtubers: Hey guys we got diamond play button. Gonna frame it on the set. Hacksmith: Lets cut it with a Lightsaber.
You have a big heart 😁
Upload your first YouTube video
XD. Casually cooks a diamond play button.
I watched the hackesmith when it just had its 100k subscribers from then i picked an interest in watching every SINGLE video he posted. It was like a dream come true, from a light saber to Captain America's shield even ironman's helmet, the hacksmith created everything and thats why i and my sister watch your vids the moment they are posted. I really hope the hacksmith see this and keep on doing what your doing my g your the best😀😀

Hacksmith: destroying play button Youtube: terminate his channel
I’ve been a fan for years now, and I want to say how your channel has really helped me grow as a person. You guys inspired me to become passionate in engineering. Thank you for all of your amazing videos.

While I'm not a entrepreneur or a business tycoon or anything like that I would like to give you one piece of advice. Don't take out any loans or anything that would be considered borrowing money. When times get slow not having any debt will help you push further

Hacksmith Industries is an amazing place and it should earn all of our respect.
You have to make a breather kylo wren mask for when you use the lightsaber. Use the salts for the colours too!
Dang! I came for a light vid during online class and u just went deeeeep.............................. NICELY DONE. I'm truly touched and I wish that I could work/study in your Research Lab someday! :)
I loved this video 🤩👍👍 !  This video is amazing 👍🤩
they just got the diamond playbutton, and they chopped it in half  Edits: "you can tell it's fresh because we don't have 11 million subscribers yet."  this made me laugh so hard
Hacksmith you guys have big dreams near impossible, that’s what inspires me
Hey hacksmith are u a Christian?
U are wasting ur life's work bruh u r dumb
Damn congratulations I can believe you hit 10 million I’ve been watching since like 50k
WAIT YOU POST A VIDEO A WEEK YOU GUYS ARE GREAT
This past year has definitely been a walk through hell for everybody, but thanks to you and your teams amazing energy in every video and that drive to inspire, it has inspired me to make a channel of my own! I deeply appreciate the amount of effort that you guys put into each video! From one Canadian to another, Thank you for being an inspiration to so many people!!! You guys are an absolutely amazing group of people
The man the legend James
For me it's like Arthur's plasma sword in fireforce
The hacksmith is the only guy who can buy a building and then about a year later buy another XD But in all seriousness James and the entire hacksmith team have brought me places just by inspiring me. I still remember the first video I ever watched from the hacksmith (his 1st epic compilation video) and just by that alone I saw alk the things he created and what inspired me the most was after that entire video of all those projects and it said "and were just getting started" that is what got to me and made me the engineer I am today (I have Covid unfortunately but I am pulling through it with all my strength) and when I get better I will come back stronger and all this time I used to think of my channel and where I want it to go and this video inspired me to get back on the engineering train so I thank you james and the entire Hacksmith Industries I wish all of you the best of luck with phase 2!
you guys are amazing. Always providing quality content.  Love your idea and future plan. Best of luck to all of you at Hacksmith Industries.
I get really inspired to make science projects just because of this channel!!!!!!!
I must say dat is kinda like burning youre subs
Spoilers        It went from diamonds to obsidian
Congratulations James, love your content! But PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get a haircut and shave your face!
Один из немногих кто реально это заслуживает
Video starts at 12:40
*JackSucksAtLife sweating*

Watching your videos since 5 years bro. Your hard work has paid off👍🖖. Hats off to you sir.🙏
Imagine saying bad things and complaining like he is so smart and is so cool he has an amazing team and is an amazing engineer, be grateful that he does anything, he didn’t finish some things or upload as much as I wish but that is what makes it better, it makes you anticipate the video
Disney: I want a real lightsaber! Disney workers: We can't make it sir with our billions of dollars and technology Disney: HACKSMITH WAS ABLE TO BUILD THIS IN A CAVE WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!!!
You must soon reach your goal don't consider the negative concider the positive and keep on going further . And u must soon reach 100M subscribers .
Makes me satisfied and unsatisfied 😂
Please give me free ps4
Of all your amazing videos, this is by far the most interesting
He squeezed the life out of that lemon XD
Hmm mandalorian rifle ? I am not a big fan but that is a pretty interesting gun.
16:30 look at the diamond play button 😅
This makes me happy to see how far he came and watching this and seeing just how far he did and watching this and seeing how emotional he is talking about it shows how real he is and I hope it gets better and better like ik it will keep up the good work and no matter what we will all support u no matter what

Pro tip: every time you watch a hacksmith video just click straight to 3/4 of the way through and you'll see everything you actually clicked on the title to see.
nonononononoononoononononoonnoonononon dont do t
YouTube: theHacksmith, here's 100,000,000 dollars! Hacksmth: Let's burn them with the light saber! 😆 lol
I'm very sad because of grant thompson passed away. Im happy how he helped you out it's just not everyone can understand.
Hacksmith when 2021 :  Cut half of earth  with a giant light saber
I have been watching your vedios since you made the Capitan America's shield😍😍
I feel like Hacksmith Industries is the real life equivalent of B.N.L from Pixar. They start off as a small business but over time they are the ONLY thing you see.            And I'm not mad about that
I love your beds
@JackSucksAtLife is not going to be to happy...
Now YouTube has to make that button LIGHTSABER RESISTANT LMFAO
People at Youtube are saying: Why did you destroy/melted our expensive button you gotta pay for that XD
Mr.hacksmith ....  My inspiration is Elon musk and so do u , I too want to change the world in some way or another . I am in my 1st year of college and I am kinda confused how I will start that change ,otherwise I will have to do job and live a simple life which I dont want . By seeing u ,I feel even more inspired.  u are encouraging people to choose this amazing subject called science , and I love ur future plans too . I hope we all change  the world someday and make our lives contributing . Hats off to hacksmith and hacksmith industries for achieving their 1st goal and I can already see u achieving all of your goals and fulfilling ur dream.  Keep doing the good work and we will keep supporting you. 👏👏
I think that the mini play button must be more cheaper as I am from Singapore
YouTube if you see this comment send them a nother on they are the best
I love your videos. At my school we war pleyng your video i follow you sence 7m i think
The Hacksmith literally described my dream job with this video. I hope to one day be an innovator like him, and maybe even get to work with him and his incredible team to help create new inventions to shape the course of and improve humanity.
We need a q and a for the lightsaber!!!!! (-: my question is ( is it actually making those noises? If yes why?)
Y does this video hav 1.2k dislikes. Y’all people who disliked r stupid
Put the light saber up for auction.  Then build a mark 2...
Also make play-button ninja stars.
Hacksmith: *Gets a Prestigious Award for gaining 10,000,000 on YouTube* Also Hacksmith: I'm gonna wreck it!
there you go, a custom play button
I know I can't do anything but from  position comments you might cheer up (love you bro)
Nooo. Not the play button
YouTube : am I a joke to u
Nice Fresh Prince vibes bro
Rest in peace grant,  the loss of his outgoing free spirited but also knowledge based content was a tremendous loss to YouTube.  And i am now a subscriber to the hacksmith industries, i see nothing buy greatness and success coming from you and your team i can't wait to watch you all make history!
10 million subs really you guys deserve it
Hey can you make the rotating gun from tom cruise's minority report?
U just lost your playbutton man
This is how tony stark arc reactor beam invented (I mean about play button turn yellow in the middle  like it  want to beam)
I love the genuine emotion on his voice
Make a nazgul suit or sword
I love that you guys made a real lightsaber! Speaking of Star Wars in your mask you sounded like a battle droid😂 Keep up the great work!
Dang dude... I was totally about to skip to the lightsaber.  Mad respect for your industrial goals, and to the team for grinding against the youtube algorithm.
I can remember your first video. You have really come a long way
When are you cutting your beard
I think at 50mil subs, YouTube will just send the materials with challenge to make the strongest play button
I wish you have meet and greet in the Philippines soon...and make projects in our country
Hey man, if you’re feeling down or worn out, it’s ok to take a break. You deserve it :)
nusr-ET is workşng with hacksmith
This is the definition of a true Jedi.
Next Video: Making Rocket League a physical sport
Grant really meant a lot him, beacause he was getting emotional when talking about him, and after the grant he talk about his hard works and gets more emotional, i will wish you all the best always, for you, for your team, for your youtube, for your friends and families
This will get lost in the comment section but I just want to say that you are an awesome content creator and I enjoy your videos a lot even though I don't understand half of what you say
stupid youtouber       jk
We support you until the end hacksmith
Aight gimme some time imma find the 1.2k that disliked

🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭
This video just makes me so happy
I really love Hacksmith Industies projects and I would love to be able to make stuff like them someday so, someone knows which career would be good to study to be able to make this kind of stuff?
this is really touching
He got really emotional when he started talking about his friend you can hear it in his voice
Hacksmith don't worry u will meet SCPs
Make some smaller play buttons like the ones ur selling with the molten play button
T.E.A.M. TOGETHER EVERYONE ACHEAVES  MORE
Nice man
You just blued the steel lol If Star Wars doors were made of YouTube diamond buttons it would have been almost Jedi-proof
My friend I have one question to ask you what the hell were you thinking when you made this video The Diamond play button is not meant to be destroyed it is meant to be displayed right next to your other play buttons
damn the first half of this video hit way harder than I expected.
13:55 aAAaAaAAAAaaa Das hot
The thing is when will you cut this beard
As cool as it is having the closet thing to a real lightsaber and cutting through stuff....man, that was a DIAMOND reward for ten million people following you, you couldn't have tried it on anything else..?
been watching since 2018 love our vids and keep up the work for making it real
I love your videos but can u make something marvel I am just asking u don't have to if u don't want
Did you buy Lot 42?
You should use the diamond as the heart for an iron man suit
It won't be a surprise for me if in 5-10 years one of your crazy commercially inviable ideas turns to be a big science breakthrough. Pure science sometimes is make crazy stuff that seems to be useless
U are crazy... Crazily amazing!!!
Good job on reaching your goals
Move onto the next comment, there’s still many more
Now please spend $3000 and buy a replacement play button
The new melted play button looks amazing.
Man love it Glad you can get past the ignorance of some folks. Keep up amazing work man perfect authentic!
F*ck the naysayers, keep doing you!
The Hacksmith is truly one of the greatest channels on this platform and the step that they've taken to rename it just goes to show how much they have grown and how far they've come, it's not just one person anymore.
Welp i think you cant get another diamond play button
Hacksmith please don't care about negative comments, what you are doing is beyond amazing, those people posting negative comments about you are simply jealous of you and what you do, your videos are not only entertaining but very inspiring so keep up the good work nobody can stop you
I always like your videos.I have learnt more via your videos keep it up👍👍👍
Dabs he seems so nice to give a time stamp for the light saber, no wonder why he’s Canadian
IS​ rinbow play​ button now​ .wow
I was really moved by the first part of this video, even though I'm a pretty recent follower. Just know that we all support you, and don't be bogged down by those negative comments. We all can't wait to see what you do in the future!
Don’t worry about haters they can’t even do nothing.
The first time i watch your chanel was 4 years ago and your chanel grew preaty well im impresd
I am big fan of you sir, loved your videos and inventions
Dude, you and your team are legends. You are all all such an insanely impressive group of people. What y’all do is a lot of work, and hard work at that. Mad respect
Timestamp here so you don’t need to manually go to there: 12:22  Thank me later
Other Youtubers when they get to 10 Million subs: Omg guys thanks so muc- Hacksmith: hehe lightsaber go woosh   Btw love the vids man, you guys are great
Dudes heart is bigger than his biceps. Love you guys, thanks for all the amazing content over the years.
I just had subscribed
Anyone notice that he changed his name to "Hacksmith Industries" from "The Hacksmith".
Love from India
Ur videos are absolutely amazing. Every video is very inspiring. Pls continue the amazing work ^△^
Just remember that all the haters are just free views
Youtube needs a sapphire play button that looks blue like this one at around 14:27
Love how we can tell at what point a Hacksmith Ind. video is in time based off the beard... waiting until you're at Gandalf level
Love the reference in the beginning
Aren't you sad for your diamond Play button
Beautiful video. Smashed that subscribe button so hard. Love this channel and what it stands for. Keep up the work and good luck in whatever your future holds.
Hacksmith: "you can tell its fresh because we don't have 11M yet"  Me: Looks at subscriber count.... at 10.8M  Me: YET, yet is good
12:44 is what you came for
*Mr. Beast*  where are you?
______ vs 1000 degree knife content is resurging
I was thinking it was such a shame to be doing that. But after seeing how it got framed up and put together. Yea, it's a'ight.
Is it just me or is he the greatest chef ever
CR7 Told that Hater Make you Unstoppable, So keep going!! 🤩
I don't remember when I first started watching you, but every video you make gets me so excited. I love seeing what you and your team are capable of and i am incredibly proud of all of you. I don't know how much that means coming from a random fan, but you all deserve the best in life.
Who ever down voted this dose not have a sole.  This almost made me cry and if I had the money I would donate to the Hacksmith Industries and should I win the lottery I will.
You guys really have come along way ive been watching since the zarya particle cannon build
James should  really start cooking with hacksmith it will be damn awesome
Keep up the hard work!
Partner up with Mr. Beast!!
Hey man love this content and you’re doing an amazing job. Congrats and God Bless You
Hacksmith: melts diamond play button YouTube:ok! We are not sending ruby play button now 😂😂
Your mind is very great james (the hacksmith i so your story 👍)
I'd like to know more info about his friend please.
Is that a real diamond? No? Lol..
It's not a light saber it's a firefun
Iy started glowing in the center, looked very fuckin cool!  Congratulations hacksmith, I hope you achieve greater things than what you have planned in this video. I am sorry for that one percentage of people who still complain, but they are allowed to have oppinons, as you said.    Put the play button on the chest plate of the power loader?? I also have video idea, make the world's most advanced gaming headset. Or a tactical gaming chair will all sorts of tools hidden inside it like one of those multi-tools that fit in you're pocket. Tactical cup, maybe even a pair of tactical shoes! Instead of the ironman suit, get the tactical suit.
Congratulations hacksmith you deserved it
This guy is an irl hero keep living man you deserve every great thing that happens to you
Do what ever you want I am always here to support you I have been watching u since 2 years😊
Why
Tony Stark has  nothing on you James
Keep up the good work Hacksmith
11:56 Did he just say “CEWPON?”It’s COOPON.😂😂
You should make iron man gloves that shoot plasma beams
I just wanna say that this is the most wholesome video I’ve ever seen and that I know he’s going to make a difference in the world no matter what happens
Gordon Ramsay wants to know your location
The diamond play button was looking cool while melting..
HackSmith: "i saw this PlayButton in half" HackSmith: "with the power of flex tape, we can fix this PlayButton"
Normal big youtubers: Hang this on there wall. Hacksmith industries: Cuts it in half then hangs it on there wall.
So many things are possible but very few people do the research for those things, we need more people like this.
I’m 12 and love your videos when I grow up i really wanna be like you do you have any other tips that can help me fulfil my dreams 🙂
hello, mr .hacksmith . i am your  big fan,i am 11yeras old, i have an idea to make a real web shooter,how  can i discuss it with u, sir ?
YOUTUBE DOONT GIVE THIS GUYS PLAY BATTONS IF HE GETS THE RUBY HE WILL TRY TO NUKE IT.
James/the hacksmith: burning diamond play button Youtube: what the he*l
You guys are really awesome
Respect
Congrats for the rebranding from Hack Smith to hack Smith industries.
Did no one else notice he quoted Nick Fury? Just me? Ok.  "The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more"
who is Aruan Félix near these guys
You and the team are an inspiration for me to keep pursuing my field in Mechatronics Engineering here in the Philippines. Maybe even one day I might apply to work with yall. But until then I will keep watching and supporting you all the best way I can and continue to pursue my degree and keep being a maker. Thank you James and Hacksmith Industries, you all have inspired makers everywhere.
Love the fresh prince joke
Forget about the haters
Please in a future video can you make the Mandalorian armor? BTW congrats on 10 million subs!

youtube when hacksmith crosses 100m subs: no more play buttons for you!
Your working is always inspiration for me
I hope to one day go to that campus
YouTube was hurt and did not comment on this one...poor YouTube
2020 and 2006 have same lightsaber and hair

Why care what others say... you are real life tony stark he didnt care neither u should. Love the videos and the things u invent, wish i could invent too
Hacksmith don't care about the haters they are just sad that they cannot make the things you can, we all love you and your content keep up the good work! :D
Long live the hacksmith! Showing the world that literally anything is possible with only an idea and a small garage to start
You created a new play button the rainbow play button 😀
Ok so this is what we should make mandalorian armor out of. Cause lighsabers do not cut it
This is it. He and his team will create the order of the Siths and he will be Palpatine.
He got emotional, what an amazaing man 👍👍👍
Congrats Hacksmith industries, you've inspired me and many others to create their own builds. Too many more life threatening videos!
im so excited that you have the need to create!!! keep that goin.
Amazing video. Been subbed since about 1 million. Great to see another succeed this well! Keep grinding
Ayo this man made a tear come out
Imagine somebody tried to rob this guy then he just pulls out a lightsaber. Oof, looking at comments, looks like somebody already made a comment like this, so, credit to Coulter Trickshots or who they might have stole it from, hopefully not.
Man I still remember the first Hacksmith video I sow, the electrocuted wolverine claws, can't believe we whent from wolverine claws to real light sabers
How does a steel door take less time to go through
Recently??? Bru that was 3 weeks ago
welp looks like you found a new lightsaber resistant material...
I live in Armenia and i watch you for 4 years
Great video as always And I'm not crying you are crying
12:40 is when video starts
Wow you are actually using YouTube as a way to change the world. Most people just make money and retire. You actually did all of this for others.... Respect!
Congratulations on hitting 10 million subscribers!
you have convenes me to do a stem class in middle school and plan on being a car engineer but i have a long way to plan im 14 and have besically have 6 years
You made me cry damn it
❤️
Have you ever been reached out to by the army or government. Because this kind of weaponry could win wars easily.
Youtube: *gives Hacksmith diamond play button* Hacksmith: let's burn it!
You ain’t a real one unless you watched beginning to end. I been here since the beginning man I’m so excited to see where your industry goes. Congrats on the 10 mil
James is elon musk,  Hacksmith industry's is space x.
If you had a son, i would not be surprised that he would follow in your footsteps, the next generation will always be better than the last, and dont ever stop believing the impossible is impossible, ‘cause if he follows, he will surpass, but he will have huge steps to fill.
Уже почти 11 миллионов
I’ve been around since the flying like iron man series started, I’ve made new accounts since then considering it was like 4 years ago but I love this channel and the content you all make. Everyone on the team’s work ethic is amazing and it inspires me. Keep it up :)
Hack smith your thr best u keep going and don’t let any one steel your channel🤗🤗🤗
I love your content and what you do keep up the good work and make sure to take time for yourself. What about more star wars buildd? Mandalorion suit possibly?
I have been watching him since 2014 and he's really been inspiring me for all my life and I say all my life because I'm just 13
I don't know, hearing him saying these thing.......I felt something sad and and something was in his voice. It just felt me in my heart. Hearing MY mentor saying how difficult life is....it touchy. I love u real 3000
I just completed Mechanical Engineering along with Solidworks and Autocad Professional course. I want to work with hacksmith industries but I am not in Canada 🇨🇦
I remember seeing ypur channel so long ago that i dont even remember the first video I saw... i think it was called batman rappelling or something like that. You were so different back then, especially your hair, like why are you growing it out. Knowing you you are probably trying to be thor😂 Anyways ik im one in 10.8 million people, but i love your channel and vids
If I’m the only small Youtuber that’s pissed off that he just does this to his play button when some of us don’t even have 100
If you had a son, i would not be surprised that he would follow in your footsteps, the next generation will always be better than the last, and dont ever stop believing the impossible is impossible, ‘cause if he follows, he will surpass, but he will have huge steps to fill.
2021: We had a lightsaber duel with 15 lightsabers
creo que una de las mayores inspiraciones que ha hecho han sido con alexlab
The Hacksmith improving things with Lightsabers
Your beter than PewDiePie
Wow man, you are the best. I have been following you from 2017. HACKSMITH is the best and has the best team. Love from India..❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Your channel hand his was my first time watching real experiments it was a great experience from The Hacksmith to Hacksmith Industries. And Rest In Peace Grant....

That’s not how you should treat a trophie lol
Good job

Well done mate, I couldn't be happier for you and your team! Please keep up the amazing work!
*says lightsaber in title* Me: say less
This pisses me off because I am a small YouTube without even 15 subs and just to see him do this to his diamond play button
Him tell his big future masterplan 99% of the comments :  DiSnEy WaNtS tHat SaBer
Thanks for all the content my son and i enjoy watching your show together  every week congratulations to you and the team for reaching 10 million subscribers
But why ?
Did you know: A country legalised Lightsaber dueling as a legal sport so he would win everytime
so uh, The Prowler from Miles Morales' Spider-verse?
10M subscribe celebration💪💪
Did you ever Identify what type of metal it was?
Others: skips to the lightsaber part Others: stayed to listen about Hacksmith history me: TheRE's A cOokinG sHow??
Disney: that lightsaber it belongs to me Hacksmith: ignites light saber  Disney:💀
What is the play button made of
I know this is a heart to heart vid but I can't stop looking at his beautiful glorious beard
You guys are so awesome. I watched the lightsaber video and I've gone back in time throughall your posts since. You inspire me to be better. As a huge Iron Man fan, I say you surpass Tony Stark immeasurably. Thank you for everything you've done.
Love you
Oh god I really wanna work at hacksmith industries
Thanks for everything that you are doing
Your probably not going to see this comment since as of writing there are 11k comments. But until I started watching your videos I was all computers and it was fun but you and the "og" team taught me that instead of playing video games and doing just computer stuff I can use that knowledge to make stuff with computer and that's also the same time I got super into cars and from there I have been wanting to become a automotive engineer all because you inspired me to go out and make something using what little in forms of making stuff to make something
🙏🏻
Yeah you show that play button who's boss.
Meet the new Ironman The haksmith
I live in Utah slc been here for four years can u reply plz
I've been watching your channel for about 1 year now, and it's amazing to see how far you and your team have gone, keep up the great work and content!
Keep it goin!!!!!!!!!!!!
LOVE FROM INDIA🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
This is pretty much the scene where tony makes a new element
Weird flex but okay
Hey I’m a huge fan and I have a suggestion for a future project if your up to it but I don’t want to push this but could you possibly make a double bladed lightsaber in the future
I wanna know what YouTube thinks bout it...
Wtf did I witness
Hey will you make a video on you hitting 1b views? Your sooo close. Anyways, keep up the good work 👍
Very brave
14:18 play button case hardened oceano
To show you the power of Hacksmith, I sawed this play button in half
when did he become gandalf
Man I knew you guys would make millions of subscribers when this first started
I'm really shock with the sudden skit of cooking show hahahahaha ＼(°o°)／
7,29,932 views 85 k likes 11k comments Love you bro ❤️❤️❤️ but I am late 😔😔😔😔😔😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
maybe one day technology is able to do magic ;) what a bizarre imagination
Ok why did he do that that was stupid
What the hell is that made of!? XD
5:57 truth be told even it is sad.
Youtube:gives all their creators who hit 10 million subscribers a diamond play button to congratulate them. Youtubers:What will happen if I drop my diamond play button from 500ft What will happen if i saw my diamond play button with a saw
I respect you about what you just said. I hope you manage to reach your goal In life. Keep up the good work  But why would you melt you play button?
i like how the background is greenscreen
"My city raised this man" SamuraisEpic; Kitchener, Ontario
Thank you for all the amazing content yall have made over the years. watching your channel brings a smile to my face and makes me think of new things I can work on. keep up the good work.
Time for some Mandalorian armor! :)
4:43 who else thought he was saying the first line of the Avengers Endgame trailer??
Would Hacksmith Industries find people willing to be a part of an electrical engineering team with no experience?  I am looking to go to school to get my Bachelor of Engineering, but don't have the money or support for it.
I think you should collab with Mark Rober
May I pleas have one I have been a subscriber for 7 years of not that is okay
yeah I really miss Grant to ☹️
If he paint his beard white he would look like Santa clause
Inspirational
You low-key looks like captain america
Imagine if he makes a stand arrow
What are the chances I will work her in 12 years
I wholeheartedly hope you reach your goal. Big fan of the channel.
This video does show how what is important in life and he just not a YouTuber just for views he love to invent and make thing reality from just a vision to him and everyone love you man keep it up
This make me feel emotional
Comes for the lightsaber and play button, Stay for the history of this channel.
I would kill to have a job like this
Cut the beard
When u accidentally discover the real life version of beskar
I’m crying!
you guys are the best in the history of internet, making dreams literally become true.
Just one question WHY????????????? Anyway was cool
lol
And finally, a dash of lemon, (starts squeezing the whole lemon onto the button, as violently as possible) 😂
You should at least do one thing on each build
Wow hacksmith we are now on ten million sub
That beard be lookin fire
you guys remind me of mythbusters 😭 but a bit cooler 😊   Goodluck with your dreams!
Watching amazing people, make amazing things for years, you are a huge inspiration for me. Thank you for rockin the internet!!!
U r awsome. plz make the BFG 9K from doom etarnal
how can somebody dislike
My goal is to do something eventually do something like you in the future and just have fun at work all the time but idk how good my marks have to be to get into college for engineering. Awesome vid btw were both ontarians lol
Forget the haters you are great work and we all miss Grant Thompson
Congratulations on the milestone. I'm really hype you got 10mil now. I'm really curious why you don't have so many subs before but nonetheless You all are the best!!! (≧(ｴ)≦ ) Thanks for all your hard work ♥️♥️♥️
I joined the subscriber gang when you had the old warehouse
take out your beard and hair it disturbs
This will be in our recommendations soon.
I am making a pretty much replica of the cyber truck project that you guys did but I am building it from a dune buggy
Food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You should rebuild the diamond play button in a future video
OMG THE SONG WAS EPIC😂😂
Hey maybe can you try to make a police armor that completely covers everything but that will protect you and flexibility
Hacksmith : melting the play button  YouTube : I think we shouldn't send this guy a ruby play button ..
Do a meet the hack smith team please
Hacksmith : melting the play button  YouTube : I think we shouldn't send this guy a ruby play button ..
Hey I appreciate your work, and future masterplans, Love from India ❤️😀   And yeah I can work for you for the Indian division as you told 🙏🏼👍🏼
Your work is really awesome
This vide mad me cry I am sore fore you lose
Hacksmith: Just attract the entire population of Sweden. That's easy, been there done that
12:22

Dang Disney should sponsor him
Now, send google a hacksmith paly button
WHY THE HELL IS THERE 1.2K DISLIKEs
12:22
u can get 100m sub if u use that light saber to urself dude
That emotional voice made me emotional too
Will there one day be a plasma based saber that will work as well like movie lightsabers? I wonder how strong and how much danger it would be
YOU ARE SUPER COOL DO NOT LET NO ONETEL YOU BAD STUFF
Dude your a legend The best YouTuber so far❤️❤️
i love the HACKSMITE
Are you really giving away the Mk 5 Iron man helmet. I am waiting for results. I love all your videos and I am hoping that I will join u one day. Like if you are also waiting.
Your goals are amazing!!!!! LET'S MAKE IT REAL!!!!!
Ok bro your litterly the best ever you make the best content and I really like you as a person so keep up the good work
👏🏻
Day 1 of asking them to make big hero 6 microbot.
Now that I know how hard it is for you guys I appreciate you 100.34 times more, thank you so much and I have no idea why people get mad at others just trying to do their best and giving content for free
Grant was a great personality he helped relentlessly everyone who is starting and finding to grow here on Youtube am so happy u mentioned him through this video and also in the future i will be to Canada and Hope I will see u guys!!
As an aspiring Mechanical Engineer, I'd love to be apart of the hacksmith team some day to be guided with my idea's
I like the way he uses marvel lines .
*Hacksmith cuts diamond play button  Meawhile YouTube machines which built the playbutton :- I want to know his location
Keep going and don’t stop one a day we will reach 100 million
Your the best cook I have ever seen
I'm expecting a thoreum nuclear powered light saber for 100 million subscribers. lol
The blue makes it even cooler
it’s so exciting to see you guys starting to really ramp it up and push harder to create an industry that can change the world. i thought you were going places before but this sets it in stone now. i’m glad to have been a part of this
This video was the best
No one really thinks this channel started off in a garage with one person and now is a giant warehouse and a team of about 20 or so people
I was born a 🤓 nerd
The first thing you want to achieve is that you have to cut your hair plz because you will look like the MCU tony stark or the tony stark in the later parts of the avengers game. Just saying
I honestly don't know why you care at all about the jelous idiots\1%.. H8r's gonna h8.. You are a ledgend! end of
He destroyed play button, but he knews they will send new to him only for this video. :-D
Bro you are the best
11:15 weird flex but ok
Lightsaber vs a human!
Now no one ever has to watch cutting my diamond play button 100 degree knife 🔪
I wish I could give you a big hug right now. You’re an inspiration to us all!
Hey! I am Ur gr8 fan from India 🇮🇳and following u from the series of "MAKE IT REAL" LOL❤️ KEEP GOING 👍🔥
Keep up the good work, man
Thank you hack smith... So many people with this power and money try to change the world for them selves not the better of the people and it's good to know that someones actively trying to make the world easier for the people that don't have it easy
But why. I'm not sure if you get another one
I love your video a lot   I saw every vidio you posted in YouTube
He is litteraly crying inside
if u need another assistant in 10 years count me in
I’m only 14 and you’ve inspired me for the last like 2 years to build things and I’ve been taking some of my ideas and trying to make them and that’s all because of you and I thank you for giving me an inspiration to be myself ❤️
“Even tony stark can’t live up to tony stark”  The hacksmith  -2020
Great video love your work
You are doing good dude don’t take all this negativity
A video a week is an AMAZING upload schedule!
But you just got that
What an amazing plan. I have been a long time subscriber and love this channels content and ambitions. When the Hacksmith says he reads all the comments I believe him!
Hacksmith: gets something worth value him let’s cut it with a lightsaber
powerful move
10 MIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I want to see him making bayblade
Daniel  brain lookin ass
MR. BEAST COLLAB HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
Uh wth... that was a frickin diamond play button... was that a replica or something holy crap
You have such an inspiring personality and make me want to keep pursuing my degree in mechanical engineering through this really rough spot I am in right now with school
I legit don't understand how can youtube be so bad like how can people comment such stuff like it hurts my heart to see all this
Hacksmith assemble!!!!!
Good on you man. I’m a middle school technology and engineering teacher and I’ve used your videos many times.
If you make a lightsaber casing the goes on the current one and changes it look using the play button metal that might be interesting
Why do people have to dislike, just why. He's doing all of this for us and this is what you give him.  Hack smith is the best. He inspires us every video. He deserves a lot more than what he has.
CEO of YouTube: lets see what this guy is up to Hacksmith: alright i am gonna split my diamond play button with my lightsaber CEO of YouTube: Michael make sure next time to not send him another play button
Congrats on the ten mil can’t wait to see what you do in the future
Someone else said this before but hoping spreading it might make it more noticed: Mandalorian armor cast with some of the play button metal!
YT:what in the world?!?!
We love you hacksmith industries ,   You have a perfect future plan , I am with you
Dude did u see that giant warehouse they were looking at! Man that would be insane going from garage to giant building like that
What if you guys figure out how to make the most effective hammer?   Ps. How much does the lightsaber weigh
At first I'm so mad and then be like "oh cool"
Get a shave dude
I think you guys became what’s inside
You have changed my life forever, thank you.
Thank you for existing
The real "hacksmith button"
Go......SURPASS YOUR LIMITS!!!!
Only hacksmith can do it
EARLIEST IVE EVER BEEN
Big beard
Yo bro r u crying...ur voice changed i wanna cry too
Why why did you cut it it’s a symbol of how far you went
You cut your diamond Play button are you freaking kidding are you serious and you are happy too
Hi I'm a long time subscriber
hey hacksmith, your beard is getting too long lol
Don't worry about the comments you are doing your level best👍👍👍
The play button actually looked good when it was burning 🧨
Lightsaber go brrr
I don't get how people could criticize you for the stuff you do, its not like they could do anything remotely close to your amazing work
Ur right bicep is significantly bigger than the left one.. I do think u need a girlfriend beside youtube. Jk great video's keep it up!
👍
When is iron man helmet give away
U literally burn the play button 🤦‍♂️
I'm just sayin' Elon Musk's Nuerolink with exoskeleton = Master Chief suit?
It's my dream to work for you, I'm in first year of studying Mechanical Engineering here in the Philippines. Since I was young I really like to make and assemble stuff; first, my inspiration of being an engineer is ironman, he is close to my traits, he is rich, and he is a gifted engineer, last, a very passionate and hardworking youtuber engineer, started small, both with youtube and his body, slowly getting big and big every year that pass through, and now he is one of the most successful youtubers and I think for me, is the only one inspiring aspiring future engineers, now this youtuber has come a long way and will continue to grow bigger - James Hobson - CEO of Hacksmith Entertainment, Ltd. continues to grow bigger as time goes by. Bigger projects, bigger body; heavier projects together with your growing experiences as you've said on an old video, like Hercules (if I'm not mistaken).
Yo guys cmon. He does crazy stuff why cant we just leave it alone. I lov  his videos so much and. If you dont then why dont just leave why do you have to be mean abiut it? James i love all your videos and you do great suff, keep it up. (Still waiting on the mando tazer blaster!!)
I love you videos and your vids are the best vids in the world
How many of those special play buttons did you make is the question. Hahah, geez.
I bet he won’t respond to me
Youtube: he got 10 million (12 days later Hacksmith gets it) Hacksmith: LET'S CUT IT IN HALF!!!! youtube:we work hard on that
Almost teared up during that intro ngl, it certainly has been an adventure my friends
This video got me excited for the future of Hacksmith Industries
The colors were so cool
this is epic i love it
🤌🤌🤌
Every other Youtuber: *Sets Diamond Play Button On Display*   The Hacksmith: "Let's melt it!"
Respect man to cut diamond play button for subscribers
YouTube's like well we arent sending them another play button
Hacksmith Please make Russian subtitles for Russian-language aultoria Сделайте пожалуйста субтитры для ручкой аудитории
I love the coloration of that. You officially have the most unique diamond play button in the world. The team has worked so hard to get here. I hope to be able to continue watching for many more years to come. Congratulations on your milestone!
The hacksmith is the reason I am were I am today. I learned how to weld and make things for fun because of him. I hope I'm able to thank him personally one day. He truly inspired me and I appreciate him for it. Congratulations for hitting 10 million
Hi I am from India and i love to see all your inventions I have seen all and what I loved the most was captain America shield and thor's storm breaker
Just checking if you are reading the comments..
Hey hack this made me cry like this comment goal is 10k likes i love your vids  👇🏻
I'm holding back tears
I’ve been a subscriber for a few years. I love the direction your channel has taken. Seeing the genius in each member of the team amazes me. Love you guys and I can’t wait to see what happens in the future.
You have our support  I love your videos
I DONT KNOW IF YOU WILL READ THIS OR NOT......BUT MANN YOU ARE GREAT......And  you have our support....
I am a huge fan of your team.... How I wish every species has the persona like all of you...
Hey man please let me know an email to get ahold of you with .
I miss Grant 😔😔😔
Yeah if he didn't have a team he would've been like how mark Rober posts 12 videos a year PS please do a collabe with mark rober that would be awesome
James, I think if you want to become an international business you should as well as as just saying how to build this stuff maybe try selling it that would make you more famous than all of these movies comics and video games
Only a drop of lemon   Juices the whole thing.
Congo bro
But why........  I am going to un subscribe you
Idea: galactus helmet, it is a galactus helmet but the "horns" on  both sides of the helmet are blades and you can headbutt something and slice through it
Great content, keep up the good work.
Me comes to see a youtube button destroyed for fun instead I get a very long video
People like you made me go into engineering.
Love from India
Man u make me cry😢 I appreciate u always U can feel the chance in his voice
I am happy to have watched you grow and evolve as a creator and company. You send the ripple through the universe and thank you for the years of video and inspiring tens of thousands
I really wanna see yt's reaction to seeing this
Sir you have a great support from your team 👍👍
Just wait in 20 years there gonna be the biggest company every
You can still buy a replacement play button
Combine the extendable sword from how to train your dragon and the light saber so you can sword fight
Youtube: Wh- why- w... why would yo- *ah whatever*
Your videos make me happy when i'm stressed and wash away the stress, Thank You.
You have increased my engineering knowledge by ~25% Now I ask you to increase my cooking knowledge by 100% (I very bad at cooking btw.)
Please make a video about “ day at hacksmith industries “ with the entire team at full work. The community will love it!!
You should make an artificial intelligence system
Why did that diamond play button actually look good?
why that is hardwork why just why
To be honest, though I’m sure I’m considered new subscriber, I wanna say hearing your story and the way you deliver it, made me respect and value you so much. I admit I had some assumptions about you at start, but I just waited for me to see how I’ll dive in into your channel. But no need to wait for that, hearing your journey, your goals, your ideas, your perspective on the world, your passion, I’m so happy we have you on the planet. Keep the hard work, stay strong from the inside (and out yea), you inspire me and I’m gonna support you ❤️ thank you for being you
I am really sorry about all negative comments i have followed this channel l for about year and I loved the railgun I recently subs to the clog channel I also loved watching grant I am very great full for both of you and you have inspired me for the rest of my life
James: Gets a reward that less than 1% of the population can get Also James: *Lets use the lightsaber on it*
If the guy who made this saw this video, He would go insane
12:22
Keep up the good work  You are one of the best engineers I have ever seen  ## THE HACKSMITH FOREVER
Wow you are now actually Hacksmith Industries!
Did he just melt his whole lifes work just like that u r crazy bro love u 😍
Hacksmith , if you had the choice to build a fully functioning lightsaber, fully contained in the hilt, or create a fully functional iron man suit (let’s say end of iron man 1) which would it be?
Congrats
On the internet I have seen a lot of people smash their diamond plate with a hammer or something like that, but split the plate in half with a lightsaber? it's crazy
Two words:     Thank you
WHY WOULD YOU CUT YOUR DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON I MEANT YOUR HARD WORK FOR?? PLEASE YOU DESERVE A HOT SUBSCRIBE BUTTON FOR ME THAT WAS AWESOME but also why
U r nearly 11 million
Bruh... I thought you were retiring and almost had a heart attack 😅
Ur vids are so good and awesome keep it up
Use the lightsaber to get a new hair/beard cut
Damascus play button??
Ooooh can I win pls
Step 1: Work Hard Step 2: Earn Reward Step 3: Put a Lightsaber through reward   Ps. 14:28 U made it look better
The fact is that after he showed that grew video we could notice some tear drops and after that whenever he talked we could understand he was crying and his voice was shaky. How on earth did he not breakdown.  All those Haters-
This video is so inspirational and it makes me happy.
What is wrong with this guy
James it is okay all you should do is ignore them you are the the best   You inspired me to engineer
Phonecall: Hey Youtube, we have a problem here. You know the 10million sub play button you sent us?? yeeah it broke so we need a new one
Iam so happy for him i hope he keeps growing the chanel😭😭
Mr hacksmith why don't you make a pizza cannon, pizza gun, pizza knife and pizza sword.
i knew that this guy works hard but a video a week is just incredible
This just looks painful 😖
I can’t wait till a partnership with Elon musk or something occurs
He risk it for us
A soul for a soul
Hacksmith should colab with Mr beast .
the dislikers are just fools. what is bad in every single thing they make??
YouTube give diamond playbutton Hacker Smith : let's burn it YouTube: 🤔🤔
don’t let these fools make you feel bad. They don’t see how hard you work. You’re the only reason that we have so many YouTube memories. Hacksmith Industries isn’t anything without you. Thank you for all the amazing content..
Scratch the lightsaber am waiting for some high tech dim gear😼
Congratulations for 10 million Subscribers.  I watched all yours videos and I need to heart ❤
No joke, James you inspire me each day.  I joined the family 3 years ago and each day when i feel low and demotivated, i remind the amount of hardwork and dedication you put into your work. BAMM.. It helps.
Playbutton take it like a champ
This is the coolest thing ever you guys are the best 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Next on hacksmith industries: Blowing up our 100 million sub play button using death star!!!!  And I am pretty sure this will happen!!😊❤❤
You should try to make lukes blue lightsaber  with the same tech
Something else that grew is James beard
Noooooooo.
Omg u r insane bro I have seen very less people doing what you are doing  i give you all the support from India
Your an inspiration to so many. I only wish i was canadian or american so i  coumd have a chance at the internship but im going for chemical and nuclear so unless you want your own reactor i dont think id be much help.
That reminds me about an Brazilian youtuber that cuts his own 100.000 YouTube subscribers sign, good times ha.
Omg you burned the precious play button for showing us 😭.  So everyone subscribe Hacksmith.
I have be fan of channel for three years .U have always given great content , and also congrats for 10M subs.
will you ever build a doctor octipus 8 arms suit??
But why you have to cut it man
Nothing worth having comes easy. You  got it man I look forward to the next five years of amazing content
Keep doing what you do
James started his amazing journey from a garage and now he has a team and the coolest ever workshop ..... 🙏🙏
shit do you know how much that is worth
Wait you went to Utah to hangout with your mentor? Dude that’s so cool that you came to the same state that I live in to hangout with him. I wish I could have meet you guys. I don’t know a lot about engineering and stem but you have made me want to study that for fun. I have made a few small things like a wrist mounted flamethrower and I fix a lot of things. I hope I get to meet you someday
You are so great
You are my inspiration and the best person I have ever know 💞💞
What a beautiful speech................ 😢😢😢😢
Wow your Amazing Hacksmith😇😇😇🥰🥰🥰
Use it to shave your beard
Plz make blade of chaos
Well you keep going hacksmith you keep up the good work live you vids :)
Can someone explain why the metal thing turned rainbow ?
You will always be one of my favorite channels, and COMPANY! Thank you to you Mr Hacksmith, and to your entire team.  You have brought me joy for years.
Go Canadians!
He basically made his own custom play button
This video.  It's like eating in front of 10 million hungry people!
Next stop making a real like grievous with 4 arms  Side not- your channel honestly secured my interest in engineering because I always love seeing how things work and make new things and when I saw the iron man suit and I subscribed ever since and watched every video I can and hopefully I’ll be able to go and work with all of u and meet the team that inspired people all over the world and just over all love all u guys the team that’s there now and before and I hope u see this comment
I love the plan. I can’t wait for you to achieve your dream
Wow. This is incredible. I wish you good luck on your journey of growing your business. It's been awesome to watch this channel grow! =D
Youtube watching this video like
I am electronic student, and every content in hacksmith channel always inspired me to be a better electronic student among my class.. I hope, I could join you soon.
If you skipped to the diamond cutting you are gay
Hey hacksmith industries, since the new monster hunter movie is coming out in a year can you make the flaming dual blades from the teaser?
you content makes me smile
Hits 10m gets play button  "Hacksmith let's brake it "
This is so incredibly inspiring
Love the plan and you were a big inspiration to us all
Dislikes are from the who were not able  To make a lightsaber
Wow I sub in 50k subs look at you now
The best part of the video is until 10:13, not from 10:13!     I like what you are doing! I respect what you are doing! Keep it up!
Might I suggest a "meet the team" video?
U guys are just crazy for destroying a momento
This is my favorite video on YouTube EVER!!!
12:12
Your my inspiration sir
Grant lead me to your channel. I’m so happy he did. We miss you buddy. Tkor, Rest In Peace legend.
I’ve been watching for a long time and lowkey almost started crying 😖
Next video will be:- Time to make new dimand play button.
nice work .............love from India
You have made me who I am 😄
Light sabers are kinda solid in the middle but honestly I’m still proud
Hey Hacksmith: you’re crazy
You're amazing! Keep up the good work!!
I have a keen interest in science and wanna help but ...   Am just 13 years old and don't know much about science 😭 but i promise when i will get a chance i will definitely do it
Оби-Ван таблетки потерял , кнопки режит
Should cast into another play button
Hacksmith industries is the real stark industries
Hey Hacksmith ! Is there going to be  a  cutted Diamond Play button give away   ;)
You are so inspirational!!!
Why cut it in half
Absolute madman
DISLIKE
Rest in peace Grant
We all know the hacksmith is gonna invent space travel and get the first ever kyber crystal, making the first first lightsaber
What would a Hacksmith EDC be?
This man looks like Jesus in 2020
Hope they realize that this is a one time thing. They won’t get another one
I’m so proud of you guys, keep up the great work, stay strong y’all are amazing
Keep doing what you are doing. So many people love and enjoy your videos and I watch a lot of them. Most of these people hating on the channel couldn’t make half the things that you and your team create. You are inspiring everyone to reach greatness
By star wars lore technicality, that is not a lightsaber, it is a protosaber since it has an external power back
Do it in your own way because that wil show the creativity of you. Thumbs up for that 😆👍
I told you not to cut the diamond play button!
Hacksmith: gets diamond play button  Hacksmith: cuts it in half with LIGHTSABER   RAINBOW PLAY BUTTON!!!
❤️
Are you mad you had melt your diomand play butten
YouTube b like: 😑 shouldn't hav given him the play button
You only need a diamond play button and you can block 1000 light saber slash of Darth Vaders
WTF!?!??
Don't worry bro we all love u and ur vids ☺️
Good job on the video 👍
I honestly don’t know the melting points or any scientific validation for this idea. But could the plasma come out around a metal rod/saber so when you cut through something it looks more like a cut rather than a melt. Obviously it’ll look less like a real lightsaber but it would act more like a saber for this type of video. Just an idea and have no idea how plausible it actually is. Great work and you’re making my childhood dreams a little more real ✌🏼🙌🏼
Good job
16:03 WOAHHHH!!! A 10 million subscriber diamond play button! Looks like YouTube sent us some free scrap metal! 😂
well you dont see things like this everyday lol!
lets make a iron man helmet out of playbutton metal😎😎😀😀😂😂😭😭❤️❤️🔥🔥🎉🎉🙏🙏👍👍
I am so happy, hope complete your master plan 😊.
F the people that disliked
I cried while watching this video because I was there when he made his first wolverine claws and moving hay with them so I think back to that and it makes me realize where he started and how he got here so please hacksmith don't stop being the tony stark of this world.
You have the coolest job in the world
He should make weapons for armies and countries. We would let our military win with lightsabers and arc reactor lasers.
Honestly I love your stuff, it inspires a certain ping of creativity in my friends. You make this interesting and fun. You deserve every subscriber you got.
2030 Hacksmith 50 mil subs Hacsmith : haha sabers go Brrrrr
That was awesome. And I love your future plans. May you and your team succeed.
The play button now actully looks like it's made for The Hacksmith Industries!!! But you could have asked youtube to give you a dummy play button.
You guys should expand to more areas ex. A campus in California, Arizona etc. That way you can include more internship opportunities and employment  in different areas or even investing into community colleges and universities. (Can you open one in rocklin or roseville C.A. like near the colleges I would love to help design and engineer new innovations and technologies for your company.)
Nice avengers quote
I have an idea you could do in the future try and make iron mans shoulder Missiles or maybe iron mans boot thrusters or a bulletproof Deadpool suit
BEST 2020 SPEECH EVER
You should pick up the pieces and make a new play button
this is the true definition of humble
10:26 you look like Jesus
So glad to see you guys taking the next big step in your career. I can’t wait to see how much you progress.
Next up, at one billion subs you cut it in half with a real light saber
I must say, as a schemer I like your plan, it's a good one.
Yeah guys, you all dont know what goes on behind the scenes, so be nice.
You could send that piece of molten play button to someone like Alec steel to possibly make a really pretty knife out of it.
I know it's just experiments but why, why would you cut the diamond playbutton in half or even melt it
Now that's... ... ...I'M not crying.. YOU are!...
JackSucksAtLife is probably going to be in so much pain when he watches this
You are like an inspiration for me. I want to join the science community like with mark rover and you. I got the Texan accent and the calm demeanor, now I need the smarts (Referencing tf2 engineer)
My question is why would you do this
I cried 😭😹 I am soooooooooooo happy that I found you I love this chanel and love all the invection you make
This path is rough one
Can u make a Drone which can fly and become a submarine and move in water
Ten million pieces for Ten million subscribers ?👀
Nerd
why would you destroy that?
He should cast his play button into a weapon as the hacksmiths own weapon creation
it is hard to grow and get better but your doing what is hard for lots of people go for it
When I saw a video from him I was so hooked and I loved every single one of his videos.
When the Hacksmith wields a legit lightsaber yet sounds like a Battle Droid due to the mask. Oh the Irony...
I'm convinced that one day there will be real life superheroes, hero's like iron man or spiderman  seem possible, I'm nowhere near smart enough to help make any of this happen but i hope that someone will (probably hacksmith industry's) The more advanced technology gets the faster it'll advance and sooner then later people are probably gonna use that technology for some bad things, that's why we need people to use it for good, anyway I just realised that I've been typing for a while so pretty much I want superheroes to be real
This makes me want to learn engineering  and other things so I could work here
I always knew you would go places from the moment I watched you lift a car with an exoskeleton and build thors hammer. Be well Hacksmith and Hacksmith crew. You will reach your goal in time.
Why would you mess up your play button
Good job for 10mill
Thank you for everything yes there may be hard times for you but remeber me and your other subscribers will be always here to love you and support keep dreaming big, thank you for inspiring me to help the world
As a Canadian kid who grew up watching Discover Channel and Myth Busters, I can confidently say, you are the inspiration for a whole new generation of children to not only explore STEM fields, but lead in them. Thank you for being, objectively, uncontestably, awesome!
Aruan 2th
Meanwhile 7 year old me is screaming right now after seeing this
Poor play button, what did it ever do to you?
That was grate I have been Watching Your videos for 14 years
Hey your face is like sushant singh rajput bro
Susan Wojcicki: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THE PLAYBUTTON
You seem like a genuinely good dude. I don’t know/understand a lot of stuff that you do but I watch because you’re a breath of fresh air in a negative world. Keep doing you man.
Ye the sabers cool but....... wats with the beard lol hahah
Congratulations for 10 mil subs!!!!
I got choked up when he started to get choked up. I have 2 young cousins who are into the engineering and fabricating fields.  I've encouraged them to apply for the internship, but the rest is on them.  I absolutely love this channel, and I can't wait to be a part of it as a viewer; if you ever need a leather crafter just call! lol.
Awesome but painful to watch
LEGENDS!!!!!
RE: the first part of the video, your amazing, I believe in you! I would loved it if you expanded into creating maker spacers. There are none near me and I would love to be able to work on stuff. I've had this idea for a type of VR gloves for the last couple years but I've not had the chance prototype or even talk to anyone. Anyway, keep going, I'm looking forward to you guys producing a new super strong phone case for me 😉
"Collaboration Breeds Innovation" - Hacksmith 2020
When I saw you cutting that Diamond Play Button, I wanted to cry. I was just thinking," Why would you do that?" When I saw it afterwards, though, it looked so cool.
That got me in the feels
Do you think YouTube will give them another one now because they destroyed this one for scientific purposes
I know, just start the video
basically its a mini unbreakable box
Bro the history almost made me cry when you said grant Thompson I cried a bit
he legit has a damascus playbutton
Wait, what will happen when you “pass on”? Will one of your workers take over?
I feel you, you really make me 😊  plus  you  make me feel like I can do better
You guys inspire my inner inventor daily. Keep going, your guys work is changing the lives of so many in a positive way
Keep up the good work work dear Hacksmith and please be safe. We do care for you. Thank you for your amazing projects.
James, ive been a nearly day one subscriber and viewer and it is astonishing to see how far you've come and how much this channel has grown. I cannot wait to see what else you have in store for us in the future, the best of luck to you and your team!
Sir I am from andhra pradesh a south state of INDIA sir  Here You have many fans for your hard work and intelligence  I love all your creations.
Cooking with diamond play button was funny
I’ve been watching  your videos since almost 7 or 6 years ago before I had my YouTube account and I’m so happy to see how far you have come
These people have litterly changed my life. I didnt know what to do with my life, and now I push and try to be something. I spend my free time creating and making things. Could you imagine learning from these guys?
good video, maybe think about employing more diversity though??? that lineup of hacksmith employees was all white males l o l
He is legend 🙌, they are legendary.
Legends:Watched the whole video     Noobs:Just watched from 12:22       Ultra legends:Watched the 12:22 part first then watched the whole video!
Honestly creating a lightsaber in only a couple months is insane, I mean star wars has been out for years and still no one has built a lightsaber until you guys. I live your Chanel and I hope your plan works.
I discovered your channel some years ago in a bad moment on my life, and I really feel I grow up like u and your projects and I love it. Thanks for your videos and your amazing projects.  (Sry 4 my bad English 😂)
Bro your awesome you’ve built and done things I always thought would be fiction
My respect for Hacksmith industries was immense before. Now I consider it immeasurable.   Maybe one day we'll all have a chance to work with The Hacksmith.
12:22
That's not beautiful that's a damn disgrace YouTube gave that to you for an achievement and then you go and ruin it
I'll always love the Hacksmith Team, all of you are doing amazing work. Grant would be proud of you brov.
Please give us tour of your hacksmith industry
Hacksmith industries X Spacex What if this happens ?
You got 800K subs in 6 hours think about how many people sub every minute and some YouTubers that have one M took years that how many people like watching something that they can’t do it it’s possible with your team
Yo man... My eyes watered a lot when you mentioned Grant..
He now has a truly one of a kind play button
play button looking crisper than Anakin on Mustafar
Thanks to you guys my favorite heroes comes to life thank you  HACKSMITH INDUSTRIES  !!!!!
I'm currently only 17 but I plan on going to college and getting a degree in engineering and I hope to one day work and enjoy working with people like you. Tbh id absolutely love to work as part of hacksmith industries.
He can just buy a new one for about 500 dollars or something I don’t remember
Your the man who save the future of earth from aliens
shave your beard
You want to change the world?  Well you've already changed our world!   Lots of love from a guy from the Philippines.
whyyyyyy
he just showed that material is not everything thankyou
I just can’t get over Nile redaking diamond water even though that’s kinda old
Gets diamond play button. Hacksmith: "Oh its cool and all you sent us this but what if we destroyed it."
James: talks about his history of YouTube  Me: haha diamond play button go brrrrrr
awesome
Make A FallOut Power Suit          Jk But It Would Be Cool  U Don’t Have To Tho

I love how you absolutely DESTROYED that lemon when you squeezed it, with ONE hand
Congrats Mr hacksmith
Awesome
Great vid
Btw pls make an real life iron man suit🥺😖🙏🏾
Yo imagine The Hacksmith Industries hiring ALEX LAB  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
In the future if you make something revolutionary keep it off the net and away from the gov cause they will steal it I promise you!!
Love your vidss
So proud of you are the team, James! I can not wait to see what you all do in the future!
The first half of this video made me cry
Whyyyyyyyyyyy
3:18 that 1% of people hating don’t even deserve to watch these awesome videos  they talk bout spending months to create a crazy invention isn't  good enough? They tripping love y’all hack Smith 🙌🏾
My goal is to gather every Spider-man fan willing to work together to create every bit of spidey tech possible. Hopefully, this can be a Hacksmith Industry branch of sorts. I do plan on making videos soon.
Youtube after watching this “either we challenge him and his team to make it indestructible or, no more play buttons for you” .
Can you help me build stuff I want to make stuff
You and you're team are a gift from God! If I ever end up in Canada I will make sure I end up at your shop!
I love this channel so much and you and your team is amazing. It makes me happy to see you and your team grow. The chemistry is fun to watch and I think it’s so wise the way you run it like a business. I’ve been watching your videos for a long time and I appreciate the direction you are going. Keep on growing and taking care of yourself!
Makes me feel like ive done nothin 😂  He made an industrial company in 6 years and managed to do it lookin like wolverine   And im still stugglin to get paid 😂
Keep it on dude 😀😀
This is my first video of yours and I watched it all the way thru. I really appreciate how raw you were and how you were honest and involved your subscribers and watchers of the channel. As a stem student in college, it excited me to see people like you making your dream a reality. Keep up the good work and I hope you read this so you can see that you are making a difference in the world by supporting the community. I love to see this carried out in the real world. Have a blessed week and keep up the good work
Youtube should do titanium playbutton
Wow congrats man I’ve been here for so long
Haksmith love your videos you do great work.  Would love to see you tackle some warhammer 40k wargear.
YOUR SPEECH ALMOST MADE ME CRY
Omg nooo why ohh no u made me feel uncomfortable :(
If you ever get attacked by a Jedi than grab your Dimond play button and use it as a shield
Inspiring 🥺
I can't believe they only have 10 million subscribers they deserve at least 50 million.
If you want to skip to the cutting here is the time stamp 12:22
damascus play button confirmed
very epic hacksmith industries, keep it up, have fun build, and do what you can, thanks for everything and hope all works well, i wanna do engineering like you, but schools teaching math scares me
Congrats on 10 million sub
im only 11 but in 15 years how could i make the team
He should of maid the play button diamond in to an iron man arc reactor
alright thats it ....whoever gives this vid a thumbs down IM COMING FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
your videos was so inspiring which makes me intrested in engineering hope you keep up the good work and ignore the haters.
Im like legit proud of this dude
This person is incredible
Don't listen to the haters! You guys are incredible and always have been! Don't try to be Tony Stark bro. If Tony were real, he'd want to build a business like the one you guys are running. You all are doing incredible work, and I can say that you have left your mark, because you have changed my life.
Thank you for your service to society and to help others when you have wealth you have truly inspired me and the world
Why would I want to skip any part of this?
this dude is the elon musk of pop culture
You are not tony start you are my ironman
YOUTUBE: wtf dude thats hard to make, ur not getting a new one u knoe
Yo that's fresh H
Don’t listen to the haters, they jus jealous
NEXT TIME CUT THE CUSTOM PLAY BUTTON
Youtube: aww nice they got to 10 mil subs! i guss that means they get this $10,000 playbutton hacksmith: lets cut this thing into 2 and then throw it away. youtube: frik. but also good content
Dudee you need to trim that beard 😂
Who else was looking forward to the Fresh Prince of YouTube Air, XD.
If anyone will change the world, it’s you, hacksmith industries. You guys are awesome at what you do. Also you should do cooking with hacksmith
You’re literally being Tony Stark here... You’re trying to make stark industries real FFS. Cheers from Argentina 🇦🇷
Aruan apenas
He put a lot of thyme in that recipe
Man that hit home I gotta get back to building
I'm watching you since I was six, now I'm 13                            & I'm your biggest fan from Pakistan. And when I come to Canada first place I visit is the hacksmith industry.
It almost makes me feel bad for leaving negative comments. Lol
I am just waiting for the day that the Hacksmith makes a real Mjolnir Mark VI armor from Halo. And a plasma Based energy sword to go along with it. Its gonna be awesome. I've been with the Hacksmith for almost 4 years now. The first episode of theirs I watched was the exo-skeleton lifts the DeLorean. Since then I've been getting in trouble for watching your videos in class. I love you guys and James, I hope your dream comes true. 👊😎
Can you make full iron man suit
Hey James! Just want to say that I’m really impressed by all you’ve done as even if some people doesn’t agree about what you do I hope you will make a way troughs those negative comments. I’m excited to see you in 5 years to see all you will have done! Sharing some love from Québec
Oh man please let the future have accessible lightsabers
you  do more than enough and anyone that doesn't agree is asking more of you than they are themselves, and if you ask me your also head of our civiliztion
This manz is such a POG champ!
You are the only reason why now I want to be an mech engineer
I didn’t even know grant died I honestly can’t even believe it
I still don’t understand the beard, I know that the video isn’t about it but I can’t stop looking at it, I think it’s because it’s so pushed back
I want to buy one lol
FVCKING LOVE YOU BRO!!! YOU ARE CHANGING THE WORLD MORE THAN YOU KNOW. 😤❤️
The beginning is enough to make a grown man cry and me 😭 oh btw I would like to join your company in the future
This is sad really because the diamond play button is worth alot of money when you think about it and just melting it, disappoints me but still the video was VERY satisfying.  Sorry if that's offensive
Seriously brother
That heart to heart though man :)
Rest in peace Grant Thompson, with all the strength and curiosity that you displayed every chance you could. You have planted the seeds of brilliance and wisdom in the minds and hearts of the community, and you changed the lives of us, too. Even beyond the grave, you inspire, have inspired, will inspire many people in our day and age. <3 We love you Grant
Can you like this  comment
People: let's frame the diamond play button Hacksmith: let's burn it
Nice
Is it me or does a small portion of his speech felt like it was inspired from Marvel?
Dislike are from youtube employees and other
The Exclusive Hacksmith Diamond Play Button, its the only one to fall victim to a lightsaber. If anyone else commented anything close to this, I haven’t read any comments yet
Not gonna lie the blue play button looked quite awesome too.
Fresh hacksmith
The team making drawdropping builds that take months or even years. Highly advanced alien societies. >_> <_<
The play button legit looked so dope as it was burning
Imagine disliking this video. Man I love you bro fuck those haters
Okay, that play button has to be made of vibranium or something!
Star wars: diamond is unbreakable
BEEN HERE SINCE EXO SUIT, MAN LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH
Conclusion: nasa should've used youtube play buttons as a heat shield on the space shuttle
Love from India Big fan  👍👍👍👍👍
Looking at his beard i think there is something huge vid coming related to aqua man🤔🤔
Honestly to whoever complains screw you you couldn't do even close to as good as he/they do better than you could ever do so go complete somewhere else.
The brute strength that went into the lemon
Try to Cast a new play button  using the old ones material by the way u are my favourite youtuber so keep making us feel better don't think about the one percent they exist everywhere
I’m relatively new but honestly I cannot think of anything wrong with this channel and community. Over the month I have been watching you have grown to be one of my favorite channels. You are prolly one of the most creative people I’ve ever seen
If hacksmith gets there own college or trade school for welding, wiring, and everything seen on this channel even, I'm going to there. I will move from the U.S. just to go to the Hacksmith school
Imagine if they build a real life hulkbuster one day😮
That is one tasty play button
See im 14 and I wish I was in Canada 🇨🇦 and help hacksmith with his goals but I can't because im in southern California and im probably to young
You should make a fully upgraded version of Russel’s pistol from half life alyx
I swear if James made a school I'd pay all my money.  What a guy... Congrats on 10milly man!!
To the hacksmiths you were made for this
What the heck is that play button made of?
I watched every second of this video awesome video🌟
Nice recipe 😋
Thank you so much for what you have made and the path you have been on.
For some reason, this video made me think the channel was gonna end
You should do “Light saber vs Xbox series x or ps5”
Damn this was emotional
His beard is big but unnoticed
I feel like who ever doesn’t like the way he is doing stuff they should just leave or deal with it and stay quiet  Like if you agree
Love your videos love what you do and love what your going to do hope you can find a facility that fits your plan and the play button looks sick
Nice vid :)
You are so cool HACKSMITH
Man what i would give to join yall in making anything.. Love your content.. Love everything yall do..
The Jedies should weare sun glasses and gass masks
Is anyone going to give you another one?
14:29 the play button looks so cool like this
Cool
What if you casted the extra metal from the play button into your logo?
Even my cat loved this video. Very interesting! He stared at it the entire time  Wow, now he has hit the subscribe button
(Before destroying the diamond play button) Youtube:- Congrats Hacksmith Industries very well done. (After cutting the Play button in half) Youtube:- Thats why he got 10 million subs   (Thinking of Diamond Play button)  Why did you get 10 million subs   I love his imaginations
Hey. Sorry for my comment on the ghost rider vid. I didn't mean to say that it wasn't good. It was awesome that you even did it. You keep on goin man
Hacksmith you are awesome 👍
Why the f*** would you do that
12:12 for the people who didn't want to watch and give me a like for the help
Dude, the best thing you can do is to ignore the haters. There will always be people that aren't happy about what you do. I'm sure that there were some people that hated Stan Lee, which is just ridiculous. You are not Iron Man, you are the Hacksmith, the best superhero we can possibly have.
Tbh I kinda feel bad for the play button
I loved this.  I see the comments (especially on IG), and so, so many of them are... bewilderingly out of touch. But I want you to know that I'm one of many people who genuinely appreciate that your ability to grow a team is actually MORE impressive to me than your significant engineering skills.  I was actually on the board of Allen Pan's makerspace, and during that year Hacksmith Industries was the template I was trying to model. Which further taught me how difficult what you've done is to replicate.   I was actually pretty disappointed I didn't get to meet you when you visited, because I really admire the personal growth your channel has demonstrated. The application of teamwork, your sense of humility (which, like Tony Stark, took some time to develop!), and the sense of humor has been a real blast to watch. Good luck with phase 2.
I love your channal
You`re the best man, better than mythbusters by far!
You guys HAVE to do some back to the future stuff!!!
What’s inside: uses a high tech tool Hacksmith: let’s just use that lightsaber we made
Your the best!👍👍
What did it cost???   Hacksmith: everything...
no diamond play button was harmed
What about hacksmith university
Dude you and you team are legends and have inspired me to become a mechanical engineer and try to do this kind of stuff! Wanted to say thanks for the motivation and ideas!
Ur video makes me happy and motivates me to build stuff to   Thank you hack Smith and ur team
Why would you want to destroy a diamond playbutton. Wasn't there something else???
James looks like a ohbo
12:12
Ive been watching this channel for so long im happy to see how much they’ve grown
From the 99% we appreciate the constant entertainment for free 🙏
You shouldn't do it
this message got really deep in like 2 minutes
Full support from techno labs and india. Always so excited to see your new and old video. You have a very good luck.
If you disliked this video why just not mad just confused would you be alright if I judged your life goals
I legit got teary-eyed watching this, I've been this channel for a few years now and you and your team inspired me to study engineering once I get into uni. Thank you for all the great content, you guys are awesome.
U inspired me alot and i also make real life projects
When he says sell stuff. Me lightsaber? Me when I see him say no selling inventions sadness
You're a role model. Thank you for changing my childhood. I'm going to college next year and I got through high school because of you.
man trim your beard it feels like stone age
Im an aspiring builder too and you guys are my inspiring mentors, thing is im still a 4th year highschool and graduating this year,do you have any advices pn what strand I should take and what course? Thank you for being my inspiration and congratulations!
WHO THE HELL IS ATTACKING HACKSMITH?! This dude is busting his ass to build the things we have only dreamed of! Love the channel and anyone who doesn’t has not watched this channel enough.
Copiando o Aruan Félix
12:07 ooh what this?
you guys should ivite mark hamil to try it
My first year of welding
It looked so cool at 14:25
I really REALLY want to build all assassins creed weapons but i dont have all the materials and the smart, but i will try and will make u proud
my engineering lecturer wouldve beaten me for destroying those wedges
Doesn’t that new warehouse look like the one from the Mark Hamill and Patrick Stewart grub hub commercial?
Jeez that thing took ages to cut, bravo on 10 mill too 😁
He’s in the future with his lightsaber
I do still miss Grant Thompson as he is the one that taught me some great things.
YouTube: have this amazing reward for reaching 10 million subscribers  Hack smith: Cut it YouTube: this is an amazing reward and achievem... Hack smith: C U T   I T   I N   H A  L F
Omg blue gem button
People say that the things he make isn’t good enough or that they aren’t like the real thing like god damn lemme see that haters build it they would put a toy lightsaber and say they done they don’t know how hard they work and what there going through off camera
12:22
go for your goals u can definitely do it your smart enough as well as inspiring thanku for the vids to u and the team
we love you James, and we appreciate all the work you and your team have done, making all this amazing content, i am sooooo excited to see what you do for Hacksmith Industries!! i have been watching since you made your wolverine claws and i have been watching Hacksmith industries grow so much, and i am so happy you are achieving your dreams of having an amazing company that helps people and probably the world, i honestly don't doubt hacksmith industries could end up making something that could change the world, i have always had a large intrest in the crazy mechanical and electrical work, and seeing you grow this industry makes me think i really need to reevaluate my life, get my High school equivalency deploma and do something to better myself, i hope to change myself and make myself better just like you did with your company, much love man, i hope to hear a lot in the news about Hacksmith Industries ❤❤❤❤❤
TO SHOW YOU THE POWER OF HUMAN INNOVATION, I SAWED THIS DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON IN HALF!
Are you guys still working on the power loader ?
Who else realized that he was trying not to cry 😭😭😭😭 I love you
I like his honesty, you know this due to is light voice breaks... Hacksmith Industries, you guys are too cool! Good job in what you are doing
Also if I wanted to join or help you guys what kind of career should I look into?
Is it just me or sometimes his voice sounds like- Trembles?
anyone notice how he snuck in a tony stark reference a quote
NYAM NYAM NYAM. THE CRAB HAS COME! NYAAAAAAAAAAM.
Dude, that heart to heart was actually really impactful and inspiring. Congratulations! I hope you make more of your dreams come true!
You guys are already at 10.8m
The Hacksmith: hits an amazing milestone as a YouTuber by getting the diamond play button Also The Hacksmith: “Let’s cut it in half with a plasma lightsaber “
Destroying something so unique makes me angry
1000 KNIVE VS. DIAMOND PLAYBUTTON.
Hey congrats on the 10.8m allmost at 11m
That 1% doesn't have to watch your videos, you have a really great fan base and there are so any nerds who are bullied for being smart but you show us that being smart is cool and can have some sweet outcomes in the future
The galaxy blue color looks amazing on that play button
Dear Hacksmith,                   I have been watching your videos for years now and like many other enjoy them so much.  You have voting me into robotics and engineering. I am only in the 7th Grade but because of your inspiration and my learning from you I am working with juniors and seniors on our school robotics team and I have found my newest and greatest passion.  Thank you for helping me and making incredible videos.  Congratulations on 10 mil subs going on 11.  Thank you.
Think if YouTube placed a arc reactor in the diamond button it would have been epic. Maybe hacksmith can do that
Yaaadeeeedaaa get on with the video... enough whining about people making you cry..
You are the bext Elon musk of our world
You spent your entire  youtube life earning the play button and then burn it
Good thing you built your sleep machine
Damn just realized you changed the name when you said it in the video
Yo! I dont want to force you to do anything,but it make my ENTIRE YEAR! if you made a proton pack from ghostbusters!
If you watch jacksucksatlife you would know his pain
This is amazing. I currently build wooden projects and simple circuits in my garage and I am just a kid. I hope someday I can be like you and the team.
Amazing work 😀 I will also do something to make change a good one u have started 🔥🔥🔥 in my heart I am gonna make a clean energy source and when completed mail the test vedio to u🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Youtube still posting this in trending after the melting into half  This shows that if we have determination no one can stop us..... Kudos to James  😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😋😋
Behold, the netherite play button!!!
I want to become an engineer and I was wondering what type are you, if you are one.
I like your stuff so please keep doing vids
Ah yes, the endgame Play Button
Creating the mind stone
Well said brother, well said!
This video is amazing anyone who dislikes doesn't know quality content
I can't wait to be able to buy a brand new exoskeleton in the future when you guys are changing the world
Corrupting diamond play button
I've watched ever since I discovered your channel it's been an amazing thing to see
The Bismuth Playbutton
For a second  there it looked like he unlocked demascus camo for his play button
THIS IS WHERE EVERYONE CRIED❤️
When can we buy your projects
Noooo
Bruh, could you make wrench mask from watchdogs 2?
Are you able to make a full iron man suit
I want a small play button
LIGHTSABER  vs PS5 and XBOX!!!
Hey could you make a Cyclops visor with the laser thing
To be honest with all of you I really want to see a cooking show with these guys. Episode 1: How to cook a delicious steak with A mini version of Elon Musk's flamethrower. XD
Anyone else mortified by watching him “cook” the playbutton?
This is a supportive comment
I've only been a subscriber for about a month and I already watched a ton of your videos and even tho I wasn't here during all your development as a channel, I really felt that heart to heart, love hacksmith industries and all your goals, it's actually helped me to keep on learning new things and starting a business on 3d printing. Keep inspiring people, we all need a push now and then
Loved this video! Your channel inspired my love of engineering, and I can’t wait to see what you guys come up with in the future!
Interesting business plan. Nice video of the plasma light saber cutting the button.
This is gonna have a billion views in 2027.
Hacksmith Industrues: *literally makes a real life lightsaber* The haters: “well uh...  it’s still has a back pack and your not posting enough...”
Dreamers like you, move this world.. Thank you!
Love u guys HS long term fayne this is my 2 channel sub 2 u u guys are amazing ceap up the good work
I’m jealous, you steel my dream. Love your work and ideas for the future.
Personaly i cant wait till you guys can mass produce things like the iron man helmet and sell it at an afordable price
Careful, a lot of people have gotten slammed for destroying playbuttons.
Who else was here before 600k
To show you the power of my lightsaber, I cut this play button in half! I loved maki this comment lol.
Even with negative feed back before I found your channel this was the dream channel I would watch it to cool it take things I love like mcu things and makes them real it’s amazing thank you
And your hair grow to
Other youtuber when they get diamond play button they keep in their room and hack Smith be like lets just cut it in half with a light saber
Aruan versao gringo ;-;
I love your videos and ideas but this was just a little too long why would you destroy something that youtube puts alot of work into. Ive heard those are hand made but not confirmed. I guess its worth the view count though. Lol
I haven't been a sub for very long, but I've been watching this channel for awhile. Just gotta say, I love your videos, and I love all the different builds you guys do. You'll always be the face, but as long as these videos keep coming out, I'll keep watching.
Better for the world don't let anyone dismiss the ideas you have
I want to be you when I grow up.
Damn this made me feel weird and idk why but this felt personal to all the people that always supported them im just wow this is amazing and I hope that in the future that they can make more tech most likely in the near future they can make a even more realistic iron man suit it may happen this was an amazing video
I can only say that keep up this awesome work! You all are great
... i am underrated even though i only have one video and three subscribers and however many playlists
nice vids buttttttt u should cut ur beard
frick all them dudes who disliked this vid
Dear Hacksmith industries   I’m going to work there it’s a life goal for me ever since what...2015 even on my channel I tried to build some smaller things although I didn’t have enough duct tape(not a joke) im still building just couldn’t make weekly vids with my lack of supplies but the m going to work I’ve looked into it and I want to major in mechanical engineers and minor in business and electrical engineering at either Pitt or Carnegie Melon ( local schools) dude there is no way I can thank you enough for literally changing and shaping my own future. I love you and your team so much thank all of you guys see you in around 11 years ( I’m 13)
Ur a true chad man a true ass chad keep it up because it’s awesome
At the beginning of the video I was crying 😭
Let people say whatever they want to say ... negative comment comes from people who just dream to be where you are today... and at the end u said that ITS YOUR PLAN so keep ur head high and contribute to the society as u have envisioned... good luck man
What was the play button made of?
Have you considered partnering with existing universities for funding?  I work on an engineering design team and we do some crazy stuff as undergrads and this kind of thing sounds perfect for inspired students to help make content and study design!
I think you dropped this king 👑
I felt kinda bad for the button
You guys give me hope everyday that what I'm doing and studying it's worth it, thank you 🙌🙌
Why would he do this?!
You inspire me so much
Dear hachsmith,  you are the best . Unlike other youtubers who just chatter in front of the vedio with little work or just sitting and playing games, you really deserve your play button You are as creative as your crazy Ignore all those bad comments People do admire you and is inspired by you keep inspiring(and also destroying,lol)
You have touched my heart you are a big part in my life and I was wondering if you can make the mandlorian rifle grime Star Wars
💜
That play button must be tasty, Gordon Ramsay should approve.
Hacksmith at 12:43 : ahlight lesh she was hafen
When you tell people to just get more subs, how hard van it be
build a wake field accelerator cannon
Heh they have 10.8 million already
I have to shower but this is more important
I just want to say you are the reason that I want to become an Engineer you are my idol  Love you hacksmith industries ❤️❤️
When I was in middle school I dreamed of creating my business that is super similar to the master plan, which is crazy. Can't wait to see that dream come to fruition!
Youtube be like:really man!!!??!
Thank you for doing this for the world! And for making this channel to inspire us to create and live
Hacksmith (or crew)- have you watched the clone wars?
Wow jame you just look like tonystark
U look like thor tony stark and a lil bit of captain america yeah                 RANDOM!!!!!! Coment
I honestly can’t wait for just ur future project, but to see the team grow along with this channel. I hope ur dream will come true     Also, Hacksmith Industries, the only YouTube channel that will cut their diamond play button in half.
Drag Lightsaber crackle SFX to timeline. CMD+C, CMD+V, CMD+V, CMD+V, CMD+V, CMD+V, CMD+V, CMD+V, CMD+V, CMD+V, CMD+V, CMD+V, CMD+V, CMD+V
The people at youtube watching this video :|
When hacksmith reaches 100 million subscribers they should send them a blue play button as a reminder of this milestone
Forge the playbutton remains into a medieval sword. That would be awesome!
!!! Go hacksmith!!! I can't wait to see the results of your new property. I absolutely love how you don't just stop at YouTube, you are continuing to grow your franchise for the better. Don't stop!
Ok someone probably already did this but why not so here a short cut for his time stamp if you really want 12:22
You look like jesus🤣
I wanna be that guy in the future who says ".....And my biggest thanks go to the Hacksmith..." Thanks for all you have done the fact that you do it to inspire others, not for money is a great thing which very few do. I'm proud to be one of Ur subscribers. You inspire lots of people, including me. I ask God to help you in your journey and give you a successful life.
Well you have a unique play button now  Diamond button more like rainbow button
You guys really have destroyed your goals on YouTube, literally
Hey guys I want to be one of the people to say thank you for everything you do. You give me daily content and I take it for granted. Your projects are amazing and your content is astonishing beyond belief. Thank you for what you do
Hey Hacksmith Industries, I have a idea for you, maybe you guys should make one of these characters from the FNAF series if your interested in of choosing the following, Funtime Freddy and Bon-bon, Funtime Foxy, Ballora, Toy Bonnie, or Funtime Chica. I do love your creativity by turning fantasies into reality, Amazing work you do, Awesome.
I have an idea: melt the diamond and make that into a hacksmith project :D
You’re next project should be making a Tesla semi but 5:10 th scale or something
who else didn't skip and respected this youtube channel
Keep up the good work
12:39 is when it begins
The real life Avengers
Please Try creating a tron bike with lasers used in Han solo"s blaster or a batmobile with nerfguns or a batpod with some weapons not to kill anyone only target practice pleeeeeeeeeeeease
This is by far the best hacksmith industries video to date, not because of the cutting of the play button but because of the pure honest emotional content. Keep doing what you are doing.
Diamond armor durability confirmed in minecraft
I am actually already working on starting up a business and this was so inspiring
There is always going to be that one person that complains about you complaining lol
YouTube: Here ya go, a diamond play button, you've earned it!" HSI: Thanks, it's an honor YouTube: You should cherish this ach- HSI:I'ma lightsaber it! YouTube:....😓
Thank u Hacksmith lndustries for making awesome content and inspiring millions. Love from India
Make a real life Tie Fighter haha
Good for you hacksmith I've walked you for a long time I think it would be cool if you melted the play button down and made like a sword or an axe
why are people disliking this this is amazingly wholesome and awesome
Keep making the world a better place 👍😀
When you become a world famous global industry we can say that it all started from a garage
What ever happened to flying like Ironman?
Love you from India ❤️
Congrats,  you're one of my favourite channels.  You guys are truly amazing.
I’d buy a HI EDC pocket knife!  Try that for a retail product.
Glad I could be here for this moment and moments like this in the past
._. Why you destroy that ._.
other common YouTubers:- Diamond Play BuTtOn....😨😨, it's a great accomplishment, I should keep it safe on display.  Hacksmith:- Diamond Play BuTtOn, Hmmmm.........................this shiny thing seems a lot of content......
We support you guys and you always blow my mind. Please keep doing what you do and congrats on 10 mil
The beginning was really well spoken. That's it that's all I got. I haven't finished the episode but well done. P.s. I'm super dangerously depressed, but in all honesty this video has given me a little inspiration and optimistic thanks it's been awhile
Seriously? When he cooked the play button, my mouth started to water.
I don' think I've ever seen a youtuber who strives to be this big, keep it up I hope you accomplish all of your dreams.
Big big inspiration, setting a goal and moving in that direction with such focus, is just remarkable. You guys are extraordinary.
I have loved to follow your progress and I will forever follow you, Grant will be missed and I can hear it in your voice. I know it’s difficult but we are here to support you.
Hacksmith you are my inspiration as a engineer to me please don't get effected by negative heads of this society . The positive in this world is always powerful than the negative
Can you make a suit out off magnet 🧲? That would be cool 🤯
I wonder how many people watched the middle part of the video or how many people always watch the whole videos. I know I do.
I love these vids man they make me want to start studying mechanical and electrical engineering. I really love to knowledge you share bro I support your ideas all the way through.
Your a hard working man and your team too and I respect that really
10:19
Its your play button , why did u do that
You nailed it, it's your plan not anyone elses. You do you. All of us are only here because we like what you do.
Jerry rig- scared to cut his own gold              play button Hacksmith- melting diamond play button
Truth, I figured it was going to melt since it was a mineral, but the fact that the table melted too was pretty surprising. Also, the possibility of it shattering was pretty exciting.
Hey hacksmith love your videos could we see an raw footage completion of the  lightsaber build from the first protosaber
U looked much good in ur old hairstyle
Year is 2076: hack smith industries releases the first mass production lightsaber  making Hack Smith the creator of the channel the largest weapons manufacturer in the UFE
Love the new title you are great and so is your team
To all the people that disliked: what the heck this man had created a lightsaber, broke a diamond play button, and has been making amazing things for forever. Uhh it just makes me so upset on how people don’t appreciate what amazing stuff you have created. You deserve this 10 million play button and can’t wait to see what’s next. 🙂
YouTube please send him another one so he can have one in good condition
You guys deserve 100,000,000 SUBSCRIBER...
The best you tube channel ever  You all are my inspiration
14:34 I like the blue👌
I really love this channel I’m Hispanic and I’m learning English from then 📝
Oh my lurd on with the video already! Rants should be separate please!
I joined stem for middle school because of him
Anyone else check the name of his channel the second he said he changed the name to Hacksmith Industries?
what once was a thought has now turn into a real working industry with a group of people that enjoy there work. I (that part of 99%) am really looking forward to see what hack-smith industry has to show the world. Best of luck.
Aruan felix be like
your doing great!!
So cool
If hacksmith looks for another hobby job except making fantasy real ...... I would put my money on singing  🎵🎵🎵🎵🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶 Ok if hacksmith does not agree with it I would advice him to go to master chef  👨‍🍳👨‍🍳👨‍🍳👨‍🍳👨‍🍳
Maraplier: accidently pops his diamond out of his play button Hacksmith:it time to destroy
Who was their hand on their forehead🤦‍♂️
i am a🤓
😢😢😢😢wow so sad
Most people frame play buttons.  The Hacksmith 10 mil play button? Fuck it lets destroy it!
Most beautiful was your story part
Most beautiful was your story part
Keep up the good fight brother. Saskatchewan has plenty of large and inexpensive properties and a need for practical jobs. Many people here are quite mechanically adept, but we need a push to the STEM fields and something to show the next generation that positive change is possible.  Keep up the good work, let the criticism flow on by, because you are on the right track.
Build an indestructible table for future projects if you can
Bruh I hope I can live to see u guys achieve global success and lay the foundation for superheroes
I have an idea the sonic cannon Rhodey used in civil war maybe some sorta Sonic cannon device I wanna see if that’s possible to be real
Pls make a currser that fly's and controld with a mouse
Hacksmith industries next year: I made a real stand!!!
When did Jesus Christ get a lightsaber?
Hacksmith team, You're all awesome. The projects are awe inspiring and so much fun! I often feel jealous that I can't help. I'll be checking out the merch store, maybe buy another hoodie or t-shirts. Thank you for the hours of fun.
Your the best youtuber and next crazy to mr beast
You talk and act more and more like Will Wheaton
Hahaaa he was sounding like squidward in that mask...BTW congratulations on your journey and good luck ahead!
Dude my heart doesn’t exist any more
Its not a light saber its fire saber
If you see this I hope you know you are allowed to take your time. Even if people challenge and don't appreciate your work, you will succeed. We love your work and will always support you
Thank you Team Hacksmith
I thought his name was hacksmith
Somebody link this video 2 jacksucksatlife Reddit
Your positivity about projects helped me stay happy
i just want to  meet you brother..i am  from india and you are  really inspiring...maybe someday i get a chance to meet you
I don't understand how people can complain about a video not being what they want. Like how this video has 1k dislikes right now. It happens to all videos though. I don't know how someone could just go to someones video and dislike it for (most of the time) no reason.
Watch Disney copyright his lightsaber
Oooooo 15:20
you do your best bro don't let anybody tell you nothing
Love the vids keep it up 👍
Damn bro your beard grows so fastv
❤️💜🌟JUST TRY YOUR BEST, YOU ARE OUR HERO🌟💜❤️
2020: Destroying 10 mill subs Diamond playbutton with a Lightsaber  2030: Destroying 50 mill subs Ruby playbutton with Life size Hulkbuster
Congratulations! And best of luck with your band, I'm always interested with EDC stuff!
James don't do it brother
wut about the iron man helmet

i love this channel and have since 2017 love your vids keep it up
At one point it was a cyan play button (14:30)
You are amazing and I’ve been watching for awhile now and I can say your projects always know how to make me happy so I thank you good sir
:) this is why i love this channel
90 percent of people  just skip to 12:22 just to watch the diamond playbutton cut in half
Gordon Ramsay being quiet since you startet cooking.     ( You only get the joke if you watched the full video like i did )
It looked so cool when it was blue etc from the heat
Notice meeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Im glad Grant is still in people's lives.. Hopefully it stays.
ppl R gonna try to but the fragments of the playbutton probably
"Will it shatter into 10 million pieces?" 10 million subscriber play button. SURE IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE!
Why did you melt our play button 😡😡😡😡😡😡
Build a hover board
I live in India. 3 - 4 years ago I randomly found your channel. And now I am so much fond of your videos. I am very much inspired from your videos. I have made a lightsaber of LPG and it work but like a flame thrower..
I started watching in the iron man series when he was just jumping on a pulley system and jet engines strapped to his wrist.
Gordon ramsey of diamond play button Tony start of youtube
Your a real og if you find his channel by his anvengers making videos
sooo that diamond play button is actually diamond?
I love this guy, even tho there is no way i can ever do wat u do, but u have legit made interested in this stuff, and thank you.  You have created whats fictional, and made it a reality You are awesome man. Respect
This guy is so cool
Any of you legends in here that have been watching this channel ever since they had 200k subs?
Poggg
12:22
As an international fan, I’d say hacksmith had truely acheived the goal. Im so glad to see the success!
Why you just got that like 2 weeks ago
There goes Diamond Play Button
imagine when he gets to 100 mil
I think you made the play button better 😂 now it looks like Vader after his visit to Mustafar
3D printing has changed my life forever in a good way. The things I have done for people by printing something  for them seeing there faces is pricesless. I recently 3D printed builder plates of two steam locomotives for a 96 year old man. He used run those two engines of which plates I printed for him. I did them for free, I do not know him but when I seen his picture of him running the engines I knew at that moment that I wanted to make those plates for him. I received a picture of him holding the plates I made for him with a huge smile. That felt so good to do that for him. It's not about the money, becoming famous or any of that. It's what a person can do something that they love to do and change peoples life. And don't listen to what people say, I learned that quickly. Your videos do inspire me.
That shirt lookin a liiiiiittle tight
I love the Hacksmith
Ayy my man singin the the prince of bel air intr,o i like that cut g
Susan watching this: 👁👄👁
Bro you are the best version of the reincarnation of the great greek god Hephaïstus
12:22
Looks like it’s gonna blow up
NOOOOOO GOD NOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOD PLZ NOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOO......!!!
Play button sword?
Man, I'm sorry you've been getting flack. I remember watching your videos when I was younger and getting really interested in engineering and stuff like that. You're the reason I'm taking engendering in college and why I've taken metal shop throughout high school. I love your content and I'm excited to see what you do next.
So, you read every comment? I believe you. But I would love a "Hello!"
Hacksmith: Give me the money I earned  YouTube: Credit Card Declines Hacksmith :(Triggered)
Play button ......no no no dont do it
Copied what’s inside 😂😂😂
Hacksmith should most defined make an appearance on ted talk they can reach the world with there ideas and maybe even save it
you inspired me to make my channel where i do similar content . thanks james
Ok but I bet you would want to like this comment
20 years from now- dude! Did you get the new hacksmith exoskeleton?
He is going to change that world and can fix’s everything that is on earth
You can change the world with your videos.
Other youtubers: I'm going to treasure this forever!  Hacksmith: Let's cut it in half
I remember when you were making wolverines claws
you should remake one of your first projects with the molten playbutton
This channel is the first channel that inspired me to go into engineering and I kept researching and I found out that’s what I wanna do and it all started with this man and showing the whole team working on projects makes me so excited to be an engineer and meet people who love engineering and want to do it as a job
So good love this team
Imagine if there was a play button that shifted through colors as Hacksmith Industries’ did (I like the new name by the way)
Love this video
Imagine 20 years in the future, Hacksmith Industries is the leading technology brand. They are making exoskeletons that become the new norm, and new futuristic tech. That would be great. Seeing this channel change over the years is great. I cant wait for what is in store.
I miss grant I loved him he was the best no offense Nate and kali
I don't remember what my first video of yours was, nor do I remember when I first sub to this channel.  But whenever that was, I did recognize the passion and love behind every project you did.  As someone who grew up watching and reading fantasy, sci-fi, and everything beyond and in between, I always felt amazed with every project you guys made.  That fantasy could one day be reality.  And that lightsaber.  I saw the first video about the first protosaber back when it first came out, and needless to say.  I was awestruck.  It honestly took a while for it to sink in.  And now with the latest version, I cant believe that it all started with that version where the firefighters literally came by.  Screw the haters.  Screw the critics.  You and your team deserve the 10 million subs.  Congratulations to all of you.  And here's to your next projects, whatever they may be...no world ending lazers tho.
Every time I look at a hard challenge that has instructions I think this guy builds insane things without instructions then I can do it
James sounds like a battle droid in that mask
I love how this channel has grown very beginning I was a part of the channel at 1 million subscribers
I love your vids there so fun to watch.
Jacksucksatlife would be mad
He will be the next elon musk      Or even better
Dude when he almost started crying while talking about grant, that shit hit different
Pls stick to Star Wars theme and make mando armor with the scraps from the play button
I cant keep my tears when you mention of grant.
11:30 Gordon Ramsay : Hey you done it wrong way!!  Also thanks for quallity content i watched this chanell since i was young
Hey Hacksmith, Just know that we appreciate you and we will always be here for you. I know it may be hard to block out the haters but try. You got this. you are about to make me tear up
Thank you for making this amazing YouTube channel. On multiple occasions I have come home from a bad day of school and have had a Hacksmith video to come home to and watched the video and built with legos and this channel has turned me into the person I am today. I thank you for making this all of your hard work is appreciated and I just wanted to say thank you for everything I love this channel 3,000;)
NOOOO Not the play button!!!!
Hacksmith can you make a voice controlled R2D2 that has a retractable multi tool and possibly a small shock stick? I know it’s probably not as advanced as some of the other things that you do but I think it would be really cool
I’ve been watching y’all’s channel for along time I really enjoy y’all’s content please keep creating these amazing videos love you bro
Youtube watching this: he knows he’s not getting another one right
What hacksmith has done over the years has made me so happy and it brought me to realize that i want to study in the sciences and has impacted me personally with everything you all have done
I watched the whole video and it made my heart stop hurting from crappy people
You sound like android with the mask and googles on during the cut lol
It would have been cool if you made the play button into an arc reactor
"A future where superheroes exist" I call dibs on the wolverine claws.  Also sorry for your loss, I didn't hear about grant till now
Dude don't listen to that 1persent
Why you cut half your play button you make video so hard to get the Diamond play button .why!!??!
Your Projects are so amazing 🙂🙂, You have arised interest for me in this subject, I am following your footsteps I have become so innovative, You have made my dreams come true by making the MCU in real life. You are a combination of all the heros in One Person
who is Grant
Not the button!!
Congrats on reaching 10 mill
its kinda sad but now mater how mutch the channel changed over the years i going be hear. i love your videos and your slogan should be dont stop creating
I have been here since 3 Million
You guys ROCK!!!😎
Why would you do this just why that 10 million Subscribers to waist
Its official im working for you  when I'm older
Imagine getting a heart from hacksmith
Imagine disliking this video how evil could u be he’s just an engineer
Hack smith: im going to use my lightsaber on my play button Me: why YouTube: you dumb ass

I remember first subscribing when I saw the Batman grappling hook video and now guys have literally made history. Keep it up you guys are amazing
Love From India ❤️
Now THIS is epic
12:44 is what u clicked the vid for thank me with a like
There were many points where I was sure James was going to break down into tears. Maybe they were hidden in the cuts between perspectives. Best of fortune to you Hacksmith Industries. If anyone has earned their dream, it's absolutely you.
.
1:14 LOL BEST PART OD THE VID
but why would you break something like this?
Thanks for this great video. Can’t wait for the future of this channel.
been here since 500,000. Watched you grow and improve, but I always worried about your mental health, since day 1 cos I have seen so many YouTubers have a breakdown. hold on king, Hacksmith industries won't become the next tony stark industries, but rather the first james hobbson(i think that's the least name lol) industry
YESS!!!!!! I love your videos and you are a great inspiration to me! Keep on making the awesome videos and don't listen to the haters. Like, who the heck can say that they cut their diamond play button in half with a fricking LIGHTSABER!!
I remember coming to that pumpkin video liking it and staying
Almost 11m now
shooot i didn't know about TKOR 😲
I love your videos
bro your inspiring keep up the good work.
even though he doesn't make them he still tests them and its awesome
dont worry, he just took the kyber cristal of it to get more power.
Diamond play button perfect shield
Btw hacksmith if you reply to this comment you will make my century
Been subscribed since he had 300,000
this is the best talk you have ever have
Please remake diamond play button
Bet u want read this one
ladies and gentleman this man is a madlad what a legend
HATERS: THIS IS DANGURIS  ME: EPIC!
Well it’s cool and all. But what is the table made of??
Hey hack smith I just wanted to congratulate you forgetting 10 mil oh and that fresh prince part made me laugh my head off and u have inspired me i many ways so just wanted to say thank you
I love your plan.
Damn he is going big with his plans
why oh why
No matter how down you get there is always someone there to get you up
Hello People of Hacksmith industries thankjs for you videos i really love them they are so interesting and thanks for your investions it inspries us the teens thank you very much
I love when he talks about the future for Hacksmith industries
Can you please make a Assassin’s Creed Hidden Blade pls
Wat have u done
I love your vids and I think you and your team are doing great
All of the colors from cutting the play button was really cool  You guys do really cool projects. I really hope you achieve your goals and make hacksmith industries a booming business. I’m sorry you feel that you have to read every single comment. That’s almost impossible and I recommend you don’t do it. Some people can really say some mean stuff. After I’m done with jr high, high school, and college (I want a masters in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering) I would like to join the hacksmith team. But that will be far down the road from now. I have only one thing that bugs me a little bit. I know sometime I’m going to have to except this but, please try to keep the language clean. You don’t have to. Most of your vids don’t have foul language (my thoughts of foul language is swearing or dirty jokes). I really enjoyed your videos and look forward to a future with you guys (if it’s possible). I might be able to speed up math by taking it over the summer. You an make your vids anyway you want. I wish you all happy days and many more to come!
When i was born on 2006 and you build projects hates off to hacksmith an inspirring to me and i am from india and from many country watch  you we are always with you      Love you hacksmit ;  )
I didnt know he died
i had no idea how hard it was to be that famous i think you guys are awesome been subscribed since 200k keep making these awesome videos!!!
Just wanted to say, the video made me happy i pressed the follow button back when you had a couple hundres thousand!
Can u use ur saber to slice a pizza
What if you made another one and dual-wielded
The Hacksmith: We want to make real products My mind: You made lightsabers real so...
Every man has that little pyro child living inside of him. If I had that lightsaber I’d be melting everything too!!🔥🔥
So happy for you guys to get to 10 Million subs, it’s been awesome to join you along your journey of growth in projects and a full on engineering company and I can’t wait to see what you are going to do next! I think the ultimate project would be a fully functioning Heli-carrrier, but that will probably be when you have 1 Billion subscribers, funding from multiple countries and doing it as collab with Elon Musk!
Hacksmith got his transformation from Tony Stark to Jesus Christ
KEEP GOING MAN WE ALL LOVE YOU!!!!!
Who df disliked this?
He : SPEED IS 2X Me : watching it at 2x from youtube player🤣
Great cook I have seen ever 😅 I like the recipe 🤤🤤
Ah anyone else miss ol'garage
Where ever you go your loyal army is with you. From the gas station to the moon. You have 10 million people who got your back.
i am somewhat surprised, that Youtube did not ban the Channel for a few days for that one.
Aruam from Brazil
I would also like to join you but I am only 13
I want to buy the play button, but I am 16 and the play button is too costly for me. Looking forward to your amazing plans of future.  Edit: When the play buttons starts melting, the glass starts to look like arc reactor
I feel like so many youtubers destroy their play buttons that its probably harder to find a normal one than a broken one
Other youtubers:puts diamond play button on wall and see it as a trophy of glory and success Hacksmith: *haha saber go brrr*
This is awesome I have been subbed for four years
Use the rest of the multan play button to make a small sword and use the diamond as the hilt
Thank you for all the videos they really are the most amazing things ive ever seen.
I like Apple slices
Okay... We know the only way to stop James and his lightsaber is chrome. He'll try to cut it, it'll take a while, so we can try to use mortal weapons against him.
Plz make a blueprint of it is i can make it
How are there hater's 😬
This makes me cry
He just reached 10 mil, now he’s almost at 11 mil
hi am i long time fan
This is how I'ma pass my engineering class I think😅

You should make the Mandalorian armor
Congrats on 10M subs Im happy for you
yt: "look how they massacred my boy"
What is this man going to be making in a facility a teleportation system   Btw love the videos
The campus is actually a sick idea damn
You’re gonna regret that.  Or not, because you can just replace it.
Everything is hard ok
Is it just me or is anybody else starting to cry?
Congratulations, Hacksmith team. You all deserve this. I have a recommendation for your 11-million video: Darth Maul’s Double-Bladed Lightsaber, using the metal from the play button to craft the handle.
Its enough to make a grown man cry, and thats okay 🥺❤
10:54 gave me HowToBasic vibes 😂
I’ve been watching for a long time and it makes me happy seeing how the channel has grown and I hope you guys keep up the good work
Congratulation @Hacksmith Industries  i am very happy to be connected with you since many years you really inspired for such diy projects.
why does he look so threatening wearing  the gasmask
You inspire me and kids around the world you are important. I look forward to see your content every week and to see what limits you pass. What kid doesn't want to see a real lightsaber, ironman suit, thor hammer. You make fiction real not only is it innovative it's unbelievable.
12:44 the video you came for starts here thank me later :)
Nobody knows who I am and nobody will find this comment or sub to me
"Not even Tony can live up to Tony" sound familiar Marvel friends

WE LOVE YOU JAMES NO MATTER WHAT, EVERY YOU HAVE INFLUENCED SO MANY YOUNG ENGINEERING MINDS INCLUDING MINE, IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU THAT I HAVE PUSHED MYSELF AND MAY BE ATTENDING MIT NEXT YEAR, YOU HAVE INFLUENCED SO MANY LIVES FOR THE BETTER AND I WANT YOU K_TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED AND THAT MY PATH WOULD NOT BE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF MY LOVE IN ENGINEERING WERE IT NOT FOR YOU. THANK YOU
Beautiful bro
I want to see Lightsaber vs bullet video ))))) You are awesome!!!!!!
I just want to say thank you for inspiring me to build more stuff p.s me and my dad are building a captain america shield
Bro I’m 18 and just started my own small business which I will do my best to create a whole industry and change the world. Watching this video really inspires me to keep going because everything is posible with dedication and passion👏🏽. Really hope everything your aspire to do comes true and everything goes even better than you planned🙌🏽
I challenge Hacksmith industry to make hamster ball thing like in juristic park
Bro ur videos are long try to make them short
Other views watching to cut a diamond play button with using a real light Saber  Me:OMG that's so cool  Diamond play button: *my time has come*
15:35 did you put your glove in the path for a moment lol
Play button sword
That cooking show bit was amazing.
Skip to 12:44
12:22 your welcome
I’m a 17 year old who’s gonna finish high school in New York it would be awesome if you helped me work my way up to the knowledge you all have and the skills and let me do an internship at the workshop because building things is something I have a passion for
Stop you're making me sad that I can't go back to college for my degree. Don't stop tho I have been watching since before 1 mill subs and hope one day I will get to work with you guys
No great engineer or scientist did it on their own. We didn’t get to the moon with one person, or get a rover on Mars. It’s been so great seeing you grow since your first “power loader/exo suit” and you’ve really come so far. I’m so excited to see where you take this and watching the team grow. I have full faith in you ability to grow and accomplish all you goals and am so excited to be along for the ride. From someone who’s really been effected by your videos and always enjoys them, thank you.
wh..... why?
In my opinion, you are not Tony Stark. Although you are both smart and influential, he hasn't convinced me to start using my brain to do great things like you have. Keep doing what you are doing and great things will come to you and you team!👍👍
Legend says you'll pin this
Love the cooking show 😍
You are sooooooooo crazy
I believe you can order additional diamond play buttons if you find additional recipes you want to try.
I wanna be a part to hacksmith industries! Love from India.
Imagine not watching the hacksmith could not be me Thank you for your hard work!
Dude this video low-key made me cry. I love you guys and your content so much, you actually inspired me to get into metalworking and engineering more. Woodworking is always great, but you made me want to learn more and improve my skills. Thank you so much 🥺💜
14:05 the play button looks really cool with that blue colour and orange play crystal and even at 15:17
They don't have but they destroyed it
HA. Even the haters' comments are helping the channel in an algorithmic way; way to contribute :D Godspeed in your noble endeavours Hacksmith Industries! Perhaps I will join you guys one day :)
Thank you for all you do. you and your are PHENOMENAL
How to survive a lightsaber attack:    : create a YouTube channel : get 10 million subscribers  : use diamond play to deflect lightsaber attack
Its a REAL light saber. Don't Deny it.
I love your videos
r u crying we r with u
Good job... you almost made me cry
That bit on Grant made me cry.
“Even Tony couldn’t live up to Tony”. Well said....
They probably won’t see this but you should make a Chewbacca crossbow
Your great and polite words at the time of saying the history made me cry. 😢Now onwards i will be your subscriber until my deadth and i will meet you when i am big
Hi   Hi... Hewo
Damn this is so deep in the beginning I hope your happy with your crew and I feel you on changing the world
i'v been sens  3m
Q: if someone offered you a couple million dollars to buy hacksmith and you got to become the ceo and keep your your og team would you take it?
Congrats Hacksmith Industries keep doing what you're doing.
Bro I’m already crying at 3:50
Make a flying car
12:22
I haven’t been a hacksmith watcher for a long time, but long enough to see the growth of your “company” growing. I can’t wait to see what Hacksmith Industries will look like in 5 years. Keep up the great work, Hacksmith Industries!!
Wow, that was awesome, but I feel sorry for the play button 😕 don't you think you will miss it?
Watched the whole video and had to like, my view, subscription and likes help build all this innovation, God bless all of you guys and I wish you the best! 💙
I DONT THINK  YOUTUBE LIKE THIS VIDEO
please keep doing these amazing engineering videos because you inspire me and your the best
I wish you good luck in your evolution, I do like the idea of using your knowledge into making more useful things that would benefit the average citizen and I do think that you would make a significant difference if you do so :)
can u make eye of agamoto?
Man, before this video, I didn’t have the normal famous person amount of huge respect towards him, but now, he seems many times more 3D, he and his team are seriously amazing!
love the video
You should sell some industrial products such as the circuit board or    casting using your cnc or make a production line. It is really big to do all this but thats my thoughts
Or you can make a Mandalorian helmet
I got an idea for something what about u make a thors hammer BUT it can fire real lightning bolts.
I feel like you're going to make it. When you become a big company, remember me please.
Play button sword
You should cast that metal into a tiny Captain America shield because it’s one of your most iconic projects.
That's really a great journey. When you are started your are a single man and, now it's an industry .that's really cool
I LOVE the new channel name and love the video today
I miss Grant
Why would you Dow this
While he was melting the play button his voice reminded me of the droids during the clone wars, just made the experience that much better
At the end when he melts it I would keep it like that
Hi I am about to be 13 and when I am old enough I want to work for you build cool stuff with you and be a great engineer like you I am hoping one day when I’m old enough I can work with you thank you please reply
I’m an OG fan and I want to say is you should take a break if you want. And you have done so much for us the community and y’all work so hard and you are amazing and if y’all want to take a break you should. Also I watched grant to may he Rest In Peace. Thank you
This video makes my heart 500000 times bigger
No technology is impossible. Just matter of time.🙏🏻
I mEaN pEwDiPiE dId It On HiS oWn So YoU sHoUlD bE aBlE tO dO iT tOo  But seriously, thank you. You work incredibly hard in order to give us 20 minutes of entertainment. If you need a break, or want one, then you should take it. Sure, some content gremlins will get angry, but i'm sure that anyone who has a heart would understand.
*We are Hacksmith*
You are amazing and I have been here since 10k also what will happen to the alien mech
Me some Mandalorian weapons here's a good idea for a Mandalorian weapon the whistling Birds
Bro u are awesome don’t let nobody tell u different
Don't wiry we have your back well I do.

Now u need a new play button.
🇨🇦 STAND UP!

Yay blue diamond play button 14:25
Hell yeah man

Other Youtubers:.  Showcasing their Play buttons safely..  Hacksmith:   We don't do that here
මේ මොන පොන්න වැඩක්ද 😅
The hack smith: a pinch of salt In actuality: dumps the whole bowl of salt Me: ???? Also at the end of the video the diamond play button looked 1000 years old.
Your videos are always unique and inspires me to do something crazy like you. But I don't have much resources and knowledge. I am just a 15 years old kid. But I hope I will be able to make something crazy stuff like you one day.
only these guys get a diamond award and say this is my greatist acomplishment just to cut it in half with a lightsaber
I love the blue colour of the button before it was cut
I have been here since the lead hammer, and I have loved every project since. You guys have inspired me to get into the engineering field, and I absolutely love what I get to do. Congrats on 10 Million!
Aruan Felix 2.0
Honestly he should’ve just stopped when it tuned blue that thing looked sick
The cut down diamond play button really encapsulates the Hacksmith industries essense. If you are a long time subscriber like me you can actually stare at it and go down the memory lane. Hopefully one day I'll get a chance to personally visit the Hacksmith industries 😀
Why u did it
This has been the best channel of the decade. There is almost no channel like it.
I hope you get billion subscribers
I’ve always loved your videos and this one just makes me love them more you have inspired me to create an idea with two things I love and combine then so thanks for that
I AMMMMM DARRRRTTTHHH MAAAUUL
Let's blow his mined and get him to 20 million subs by 2021
build a silver surfer board that so fast in the water
Play Button went from Lightside to Darkside Reminds me of a certain Sith Lord.🤔

Can you make a captain Rex armor from clone wars and cut it through with the lightsaber
Love your vids
Ha! When he has the gas mask on it sounded like a B1 battle droid!
Im from indonesian and i hope this channel have indonesia subtitle   Thank you
Next thing you know he is building the star destroyer
DON'T do this with the red diamond award!
Bruh it’s a diamond plated button and u want to see what happens when u burn with your lightsaber
copied the aruan felix
The Stan lee of our generation
was that lot 42
when it was blue it looked better than the notmal button
Dis shows he doesn't care bout some freakin box or money. He only cares bout his inventions....
YOUTUBE: good job Hacksmith.  Hacksmith: destroying diamond play button.  YOUTUBE: Why?
Epic, I love seeing these things that most people don’t own get cut in half!
Hey Hacksmith you da best
Yay
SMH didn't anyone tell the hacksmith haters are a indicator that your on that next level shit
You can achieve your goals even if no one supports you .Peace!
This is insane to see after years of supporting you. I've been here since idk like 80k if not before and I remember when you guys were struggling to get enough money to buy fans for the flying like iron man project, now your talking about a 12 building multi acre property for developing a large scale industry leading business. I have no clue how u got here or how your going to get where you want to be but given it's you at the helm of this insane team I trust that you'll get there
Copiou o aruan
This could’ve been a 10 seconds
Cut your hair and beard
Man, I didn’t know that you were getting that many negative comments. I couldn’t believe that with how amazing this content is, I’ll be honest I just subscribed after the lightsaber video but I went and watched all the superhero make it reals they are phenomenal. Keep up the hard work I’ll be here through whatever you do in the future.
You are amazing, I have been watching your videos for a few years now and I love them. I remember when I saw one of your videos for the first time, I was very impressed and showed it to my cousin. Since then, whenever we see each other, we talk about the new video you uploaded. i am so happy that your business has grow up that much, and i now that it will still growing.   Greetings from Chile   Sorry for my english by the way, I don't have a very good language management xd
It's called Hacksmith Industries for a reason haters. He is THE HACKSMITH. But he is just one Hacksmith of many. <3  much love.
In the future Hacksmith Industry’s will definitely become one of the biggest companies in the world. Trust
This is amazing i love this channel
Dude, you guys could build a Play Button Metal Dagger or something like that.
Who here is an  original subscriber
I want to see this lightsaber against NightHawkInLight’s Starlite. It would be the ultimate heat resistance test and make for a great title
I think that YouTube is both both very impressed and very offended by them sending a diamond play button and him doing that with a lightsaber, still pretty cool though.
Why has nobody else said congratulations on 10 mil
I’m not crying I swear
What is the play button made out of
I'm still wondering how large can you make the light saber blade?
Sometimes later if I give a negative comment too you just gotta ignore(though i wont)you rock!
Love from india❤️
Why????
As a fan since as long as I can remember I can say you have made such an impact on many young and old and now you and your team influence so many people its unimaginable.... keep it up I'll forever watch a genuinely good team of people
This is a great breath of fresh air. You can tell that he cares about everything he’s made and everyone he’s inspired and hired. I cried when he mentioned Grant Thompson, the king of random. This is truly so inspiring and I can’t wait to see how the master plan part 2 comes to fruition. Love you guys.
You are the best!!! Inspire - er IN the wide wild world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope this comment finds its way to you but aside from the entertainment, I am personally inspired by you guys! the fact that you have haters/naysayers means you're doing something right. Please know that for each negative comment there are 1,000's that support you. So keep pushing forward and inspire those to chase their dreams and interests rather than thinking its too difficult or not "realistic". Thank you for all that you do!
are you sure about that
I cried when he brought up Grant.
You are my Favorite YouTuber
I don't understand people who are in some form against Hacksmith Industries nor do I feel the need to. you guys have inspired a generation of humans to become a new wave of engineers who will advance our species forever forward. Keep doing as the whole team does, you guys are definatley on the right track and I hope to see hacksmith industries blossm into what you all want it to be. Thanks to you and the team even I have been inspired to start learning engineering (I'm 21 so not too late but not as early as I would of liked). hope that one day i'll be able to visit hacksmith industries be it as just a visitor or somehow an international student. You guys do you, keep moving forward!!!!
Saludos desde argentina, son los mejores.
Light sabers are a quality of life improvement :)
Perfect for minecraft to create a obsidian play button

Hey all of those negative things just know that they're just haters and they're also watching your video so don't think anything of negative feedback I get negative feedback all the time I'm 13 and in school and I can't tell you when the last time someone came up to me and said hey Dan you're looking very nice or you smell great today
I seen what that thing can do WHAT THE F IS THAT THING MADE OUT OF???!!!
Why the diamond plate button
You are the best at what you do. 😊  keep up the good work 😊👍❤
Bro if i get diamond play button i will strore i will not cut into half like u🤣😢
Hearing you talk about Grant brought tears to my eyes. Then seeing the tears in your eyes really got me. I remember when he passed how it affected the science and engineering side of YouTube. I don't watch King of Random as much as I used to but I haven't stopped watching your channel regularly. The energy you bring to your videos, the fun energy you bring to these videos about technology that is going to work towards helping people, it's amazing. Not only are you a great businessman and content creator, but you are also a great person. I love what you guys at Hacksmith Industries are doing. I'm so glad you've put together this amazing group and channel and inspiring millions. I have gained an interest in mechanical engineering because of your channel. So thank you.
Hey man I like your video cuz it makes me happy to see you make something became a reality, don't let anybody stop you...because you have a dream, a creativity and a high imagination! If you're happy with this job, we are also happy to see more of your amazing contents :)!!
that was amazing you really touched my heart I will see if my dad can donate 3.5million dollars for u guys hope that is enough
Hay hacksmith can you make xcaleber the legendary sword from from the stone or make the gyro shere from jurassic Park
Love from sri Lanka

Make a functional batsuit with exoskeleton rig so that you can have an arm mounted grappling hook? Similar to how The batman has gun parts from his parents killing on his suit you could use the play button intestinal remains??
I LOVE YOU!!!!!
"maybe, just maybe a future where superheroes exist" Me after watching The boys having flashbacks. Love what you do tho, I'll always be with you..
Don’t let JackSucksAtLife see this...
Grant would be proud!
He sacrificed is time and effort to get it and slices it in half with a lights Aber just for us, wow.
I know it is yours, but it is so painful to see you ruin it 😭😭😭
hey you got a magazine here in finland when you built a lightsaber 😃
Hewo jack Smith I would say I am a long time fan if you see this can you lie or comment
Thank you hacksmith industry! I always thought about your success rate and not the effort or the sacrifice! I’m sorry for that. You guys taught me to work on myself and learn to see the most difficult parts of every task and face them! Thankyou!!! I promise you that one day I’ll join your campus and I’ll be one of the hack smiths and I will not disappoint you!
Who knew diamond play buttons were more durable than blast doors? That took forever lol
Joining  the channel is the big thing
Big fan
Love this channel! Cheers from Mexico. Keep on the good work (and keep pushing the Lightsaber concept, ALMOST THERE MAN!!!!)
So apparently grant thomson died? I literally had no idea, I guess that explains why there where no more vids.
Bruh when he said eventually superheroes I got so hype
The color washed away when it gets heated for a while wich is quite good info since i am looking forward into building a diamond armor with washed away colors. Thx
It'd be very funny if this turned into a gaming channel like hey guys welcome back to Minecraft we're going to be making a lightsaber in Minecraft
Can you pls do the doom eternal cruicable
*No action is too large or small, but you will always leave a huge positive impact in my life with your videos* Thank you! 👍

I love you hacksmit  💖💖
I was choking up when you were talking about Grant. The world is poorer for his loss. I was amazed by how the YouTube community honored him after he passed. You do his legacy proud with your channel and mission.
Roger Roger
You are one of THE most hardworking youtubers out there. I've seen you grow from the start at your garage and I've been following ever since. Try not to let the haters get to you, everyone who ever lives, have lived, and will live will have haters. It's inevitable. Don't listen to them because they're usually just jealous and mad. Keep doing what YOU wanna do! I'll be here to support you and so will all your other true fans! Peace, love and positivity baby! ✌️❤️➕
I’ve loved you channel for so long and I can’t wait for what you are going to do in the future. I’ve loved watching you grow and expand your resources throughout the years. And I’m so excited for your MASTER PLAN! Keep up the amazing work and don’t stress yourself out too much!😆
I think Susan is sad after watching this
Your vids are amazing
12:22
I love where the industry is headed.  Keep it up, as long as you post I will watch, you are so inspiring
You know what this video was motivation to me as i love science and his talkings about it
I wish i was 18 and liver in canada to work for this company

3:40 while he was talking about grant you could hear him choke up a bit and that almost made me cry WE LOVE YOU!!!!!
How exactly does one go about getting an internship here

Okay can we get to the point of the video like
How many peopl felt pure pain. When he started cutting the play button.
Aruan Felix, é você???
But the real question is     Will youtube get them a new one?
U have a great plan for the future I would support you all the way
When he started talking about Grant Thompson i got sad
Amongst all the youtubers, all that I am subscribed to, you guys are my favorite.
Madlad. Absolute legend! Destroying a life-time milestone award with one of their 50 creations! This channel deserves a new diamond play button.
I won’t one
I hope you stay young and invent forever
The beginning nearly made me cry
Ive been watching this channel since day one.  I got lock out of my original account and when starting a new one this channel was one of the first 3 channels I resubscribed to. I wish I could join the team but I settle for inspiration. I'll continue to watch for videos from hacksmith industries. You guys make dreams real,
jacksucksatlife is really sad from this
who is always blown away when they make these awesome creations its just a reminder of how technologically advanced human society has become
God I miss grant.... he was the person I looked up to and is the reason I’ve done what I did in school..
Essa coisa aí de ficar cortando presente do YouTube me deu memórias.
Thank you to all the Hacksmith Industries's team, you're awesome. And to the Hacksmith himself, we support you in anything you want to do :D
"And maybe, just maybe, a future where superheroes exist"  i can't help but think that it's possible for them to actually *make it real*
U should make it into a hacksmithlogo
Grow your team. Make your own Avengers, your own Justice League. Give James a box of scraps or an entire warehouse filled with advanced tech, you'll still find a way to amaze us with your inventions
Love your future plans! Not sure why I can't seen your channel before this year, but I'm so excited to see where this leads!  Keep being awesome! <3
i have ben here since 2017
You have a true flame in your soul that of a true forge men i wish you luck and hope you achieve your and your alleys dream good luck and have fun reaching for the Star's.👆
Is the diamond play button actually made of actual diamond?
Make a bigger plasma light saber
Sad to see you disrespect such a prestigious icon that any of us would be so lucky to have. Whatever though, it's yours. You earned my like anyways. Keep up the amazing work 😁
So cool
We love ur vids keep up the good work
You guys are awesome I've been watching your videos on and off for the past 8 years. I haven't seen all but I've seen most and every video was super entertaining keep on doing what your doing your killing it 🙂

WOAH
Please trim that beard

Oh how are u, oh I’m good ya know... just made a f****cking lightsaber
Loved the video and love the plan.  Is it just me or does masked James sound like a droid from the prequel trilogy?

"With this light saber I sawed this play button in half" -The Hacksmith
It didn't let me like the video so 👍
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST, YOU WORK SO HARD AND ITS PAYING OFF!
20 years later: so guys we built a wireless plasma lightsaber
Come visit Utah
Bro big fan of you and your invitations
Why does he look like a Viking
I feel like the people at YouTube that sent him this are watching this and yelling because he's doing this 🤣😂
I love your channel it inspires me to do engendering I'm doing engineering in high school but most of the inspiration came from you and I think it inspires alot of other people
Bro I can’t believe this I started watching when YOU WHERE AT LIKE 1Mil this is amazing and your such a big influence for becoming a engineer and I hope when I’m older I can work for hack smith industrys😄😁
This makes me happy for them, but sad as well.
you should build your own pc with modified parts to make an ultimate pc!
You have made a difference in my life you inspired me to love engineering
You guys are an incredible channel and I anxiously await each upload. I’ve been subscribed for a couple years and I love what you guys do. You bring magic to life. You’ve made me see the impossible is possible and I love how the channel has grown to what it is now. Good luck on all your future endeavors and know I support you guys all the way! Thank you so much for your incredible content and for all the enjoyment you’ve given.
The next elon
my respect and lots of love
please do a car demolition withonly ligfhtsaber

Yassssss
You should buy a new Diamond Play button and anodize it with the lightsaber.
I still can't believe that the guy who made the first ever lightsaber... happens to also be a youtuber. mad respect
ok, you are literally my favorite YouTube and you've motivated me to do so many amazing thing like putting a lawn mower engine on a peddle bike and im only 14 and I think what you're doing with the channel is awesome ind I will continue doing my part and supporting the channel, Thank You!
Cut tour hair plz
U should try to make Jarvis from marvel
I thought this was lightsaber vs dimend play butten
You are my inner child hero, thanks for well, everything you ever done, that's really inspiring to try to make things so thanks for that and hope you the best (Sorry for my bad english)
Obi-Wan vs YouTube
You are my inner child hero, thanks for well, everything you ever done, that's really inspiring to try to make things so thanks for that and hope you the best (Sorry for my bad english)
I have been here since the first proto saber
I'd love to hear what the protosaber sounds like without the SFX overlay
Hack Smith I got an idea for ur next video u should build gloves that give off enough cold that u can freeze water in a matter of seconds can u heart this comment if u will think about it pls
Ok I'm not hating but let me rant  YOU GOT 10 MILLION PEOPLE TO SUB TO YOUR CHANNEL AND YOU GOT THIS AWSOME AWARD THAT ONLY FEW PEOPLE HAVE AND YOU CHOSE TO BURN IT  Ok now that I ranted HACKSMITH your sooo inspirational thank you for the awsome videos and have a good day
the play button was stronk as hecc
Imagine youtube actually comment on this channel.
I think you should start a real cooking show. like for real
This is awesome!
You should cast the play button metal into a sword
Wtf why would u do that dude
That diamond play button must have been real strong to last so long without getting a hole through it.
I could feel his voice vibrates differently this time in this video. Stay strong Hacksmith!
I remember the good old days when you were at 800k and getting excited for 1m
Pls make a baby play button with the molten big one
This video says he hates his subs
How he grew from 10 to 10 million is insane!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Balancing out a "kick" with pepper? Hmm, sus.   Master plan sounds good though. I'd stick to that instead of the cooking show guys.
only on an engineering and nerd channel would you have the creativity and audacity to cut your DIAMOND play button in half. fits your style very well and looks good on your wall. nice touch.   also, hey @hacksmith, you are one of the people that gave me good role models to push to become an engineer. i am not a mechanical engineering student. thank you so much for your drive and your creativity. congrat!
I have been here since 3 Million c:
Wow what a way to destroy a present you just got like how I feel like destroying my gifts when I didn’t get the correct one 😠
Ur the best
Cooking with The Hacksmith? More like Cooking With Konner
THE PAIN! SO MUCH PAIN!
Through destruction it became refined and beautiful.
I literally watch all of the videos and they have been such a massive inspiration to my engineering career.
Who the hell dislikes a video like this video? Is there any actually reason to dislike it in the first place?
That cook show tho 😂😂
If someone can't appricate you and your team putting in the work, sometimes not even sleeping at night then dint even bother trying to make them happy. You guys are the reason I am able to make thinks and let my creativity soar. I just Wanted to say thank you to The Hacksmith and his team. You guys are the reason I am not afraid of what people think of me and even though I have only been watching your videos for 5 years you guys have made a huge impact on my life. I am now A freshman in high school and without you guys I would not be where i am today, A kid who is ready to face the world head on with any problems it throws at me. Thank you guys.
Hacksmith, I'm truly touched by your appreciation to your fans. I have had a similar objective for myself because I want to help my dad. I want to become an engineer to make the exoskeleton for medical purposes. To know that I'm not the only person to think about helping, is making me try harder than before.
You made me cry 😭😭😭😭😭
Your ambitious goals and community minded motivations behind them are really inspiring and extremely comforting. I wish more creators had their focus on improving lives rather than simply making a profit for themselves and investors. Sure, enjoy the dividends of your work, but re-investing and growing something with meaningful contributions to the world means giving up some pure avarice. I can't wait to see what you can do in the next few years.
Sir can you tell us science behind arc reactor
why is chris evans using a lightsaber....
The diamond play button looked so much cooler when it was blue.      Btw love ur vids man you make my day when ever I click on your videos.
The Hacksmith: "And these are our YouTube play buttons." New Guy: "Woah, what happened to that one." The Hacksmith: "The diamond one? We used our propane lightsaber on it because we thought it would be cool... it was."
You should build snow troupers in the winter
All you need to know is that I love you
Those play buttons are surprisingly durable
This is why I love the hacksmith.
Can you make a hacksmith school for young engineers like me? I would absolute love that and I’d give everything to attend
I dont know what i can even say to properly show my utter respect for this man and his team. Keep it up Hacksmith Industries!
Hey i am your great fan  You are amazing
Cuuuuuttttttt yourrrrrrr hairs. You look like a 🐻. 😕be like tony.
You guys should see if you can make the Deathslingers gun from Dead by Daylight.
This is so good
Great story.
Honestly keep the hair
The way he grows up from just a parkour master to a 10.8Ml.SUB youtuber is a....     IDK how to describe it... Keep up the good work.  =)
YOU ARE CRAYZY MAN!!!
Thank you for these awesome videos

Hear me out....Plasma Play Button. For when you reach 20M subs
Are you a robot? You don't blink
people are lucky to even get a play button dude
I'm your subscriber since 2015  Love form Bangladesh
Hey I absolutely love your work and everything you've done but now I want to give you an idea that may sound a bit crazy but if anyone could do it it would have to be you, so my idea for you is to make a engine for a car and doesn't use fossil fuels that will last very long
I am 14 right now and I hope to work with u one day hack smith industry
“Its only impossible until someone makes it possible.”  Thanks for turning fiction into reality and being such an amazing source of inspiration. However awesome you are, at the end of the day, you’re still a guy(who also happens to have garage full of epic tech). People need to do what makes them happy. If you’re happy doing this, I’m happy to be here.        Hearing someone talk about Grant and what he did with business, entertainment, good old fashion  awesome science always strikes an emotional cord for me. Building his projects myself helped put some science back into my life when I needed it most.
Play button arrives  Bogden: awsome we finally did  James: so what to do next Ian: I’ll get the lightsaber James: good idea
You people are monsters
Hacksmith:Today we will destroy the 10 millions subs button  Youtube:⊙_⊙  I will ban you
Mr. Hobson, I think you and your team have created something wonderful. Thank y'all for that.
You are awesome keep doing what you’re doing your changing peoples lives keep at it
look like iron man chest armor is broken lol
Well, now we just have to make our armor put of diamond play buttons
Good job that makes me happy when I watch this
Do you have any stocks available to purchase for your business?
I can just *FEEL* JackSucksAtLife cringing at this
The speach at the start has made me wonder... Where will humanity go in the future with people like him helping people innovate while letting them develop their ideas for their futures
Hats of to you guys!, this speech was really emotional!, Thankyou 'Hacksmith Industries'.
been here since 500k. im so happy 4 you James
They're definitely gonna use those left over metals to make another play button
I’m so happy that you are set on your dream and how you are taking your business
You are crazy. This is why i like this chanel.
No need to post every week, we can wait a few months. Go on a brake lol      Edit: what the hell inspired you to do this you mad amazing genius!      Edit pt. 2: I love your vids
Why did you do that but I still subbed
Holographic play button. Pretty cool
If a zombie invasion happens, im going to hacksmith house
Please build a spaceship or a plasma engine or something like a warp drive engine but it just fun for you! Keep up the good work!!
Can YouTube replace the play button?
Why does the play button look cooler when changing colour
YouTube’s like “look how they massacred my boy”
Very pog
This is why he’s my favourite Youtuber. He’s so honest, nice and genuinely a good guy. 😊
You do you, man. We're all right here with you, every step of the way.
You know what else grew? Your awesome hair!
I miss Grant
Yeah, I like seeing you in the videos, James, because you're the original, but everything you said is exactly right. Seeing the whole team together is awesome and everyone brings their own unique flair. Keep on rocking it. Do I have thoughts on maybe doing some things different? Yeah. But if I want to see it different, then I should do it different. I don't see anything to complain about personally. You all are amazing and every week I can't wait to see what's next.
Am I the only one impressed with how freakin durable and well made that play button was??
back in the day when he had less muscle and way shorter hair and beard
Hey James, you should play some rugby for fun. You are a great build for it.
i love the video , i love this channel its amazing and crazy  KEEP IT UP GUYSSSS!!!!!!! <3
Gordon Ramsay would be proud of your cooking skills
Yo that blue color at 14:20 That's dope, wish that was the actual design
Can’t wait to meet you when I become my own weapons smith maybe we could make some real real iron man type suit like mark 85 ya know 😁
You are awesome I follow u even on social media
Most youtubers: wow a diamond play button! Time to display it on my wall or something  Hacksmith: wow a diamond play button let's burn it with a lightsaber   Srsly tho congrats on 10 mil. Really looking forward to the future of this channel and company!
Why
Yesterday, my diy airplane took off, thank you guys for inspiring me
Hacksmith, I hope you see this message:  I have always wanted to be an engineer, but soon, that dream kinda died. But when I found your channel, that dream has been bigger than ever! I have been trying to make a small grappling hook that can open doors etc. I would just like to thank you for bringing my dream back.
I've loved this channel for as long as i can remember and been subscribed as long as I've had a google account. you are awesome and deserve all the good that comes your way. thank you for everything you've done
Who remembers when the hacksmith had 4.3 million subs?  I'm an og btw.   LOVE THE HACKSMITH!!   LIKE IF YOU AG!!!!REE
Congrats on 10 mil
Congrats on 10 mil
Yoo can you guys build mysterio's helmet..
Really had to go emotional on me didn't you😭😭
I love this channel and I love how everyone comes together to work on a big project. Even if some think these projects are dumb and useless these projects and its not just to prove them wrong but also to show us how working as a team is better then working alone and we can do anything if we put are minds together and work together. Keep up the good work Hacksmith Industries and we fans will do our part and support you all.  I'm also sorry for the lost of Grant Thompson. May he rest in peace. Have a nice day everyone.
Am I the only one that notices he is fricken ripped like gawd damn
Did anyone else kinda wanna see the Diamond play button shatter?
make iron spider if you want to but its just a request
Thank you so much for your awesome content! I've been watching your videos for 2 years now and became a subscriber about 3 months ago and I all ready feel the thankfulness and welcoming of the whole community. I really enjoyed the heart-to-heart section of the video (btw a real tear jerker 🤣) and the true personal history behind the industry. I do love s.t.e.m and want to become a doctor leaning towards that carrer field. I just wanted to show my gratitude for this channel and encourage you guys to keep up with the amazing work. Thank you!😁
Next episode: Melting my friends car
What happens if you touch the light saber
Now a days who wants to be Tony Stark when you can be one of the HACKSMITH
11:14     “And only a dash of lemon”    Uses the whole thing
I think the playbutton is made out of beskar
Site - 02                                :O
your greater than elon musk
Thank you for sharing such a passionate video about your life and team. It's obvious how much you care about your company and your goals.
If you want to reach out to young engineers, look into First Robotics. Amazing program and way to reach out to young engineers world wide!
Btw, how much was the diamond play button that you burnt worth???
First of all, sorry for the bad English. You know what? I have a same dream. The dream to make a youtube channel and make money by that and be able to change the world by innovating new technologies. Especially the Armor like Tony stark. But the problem is I am olny 17 and don't have any money to even start my channel 😭. IDK whether you will see this comment or not. I really like to join you and your team. So I can fulfill my dream. A dream to be like you and Elon Musk ❤️
you're the smartest youtuber out there now that you showed your plan... i guarantee you're thinking 10 years ahead when all of these other people are riding the fame train for their 15 minutes in the spotlight
12:22
Hacksmiths, since you’re not longer the hacksmith, you could find superheroes with all of the intense creations you’re making
Make a play button dagger, or a sword.
Love the plan
This is why I love HackSmith Industries and all these other great youtubers, keep up all the good work and take breaks from time to time. We care about you and don't want you to tire yourself just to satisfy us, so please don't push it on yourself.
Congratulations on 10 million subscribers love from india
Don't worry, you can buy a new one.
OMG flfhdbfvjs
So, the diamond play button is stronger than a blast door, got it
Bro as a subscriber and viewer I think I speak for all when we say that your one of the most hardworking people the Industry has seen.Your a legend man,and thanks for inspiring so many people!
i wanna cry, and thats okay
U have inspired me to take engineering at my career center and my dream is to someday work for u at jack smith industries
This hurts to watch
Hacksmith:MELTS A YOUTUBE PLAY BUTTON   Youtube: We spent a lot of time on that you know?
I love the plan. I can't wait to see where the team goes!
Adam looks like a caveman...shave the beard adam
Every one help me make 10 million comments
Ive been watching for 2 years  (Edit) i love your channel
I like your projects and dedication .Anyways you will achieve your dreams one day 😇😇
He turned his diamond play button into a Damascus play button
Wow, this why I absolutely love this channel.
If you post bad comments go and try to build your own hacksmith project so stop hating on the hacksmith
Good job getting 10 million!
U should make a white or yellow saber if u can?
The cooking thing was hilarious
This mans turned platinum into damascus
Thank you for what you and your team do ! Such inspiring content and so fun!  We believe in your vision
you began to cry
12:43
Cooking with the hacksmiths gives me binging with babish vibes
Ahh james you always find a way to flex your muscles
Don’t worry about the master plan thing...you can have it. ; )
Yah I dont know why with those people
Love everything yall do!! Skynet and T-800 next!!
bold oh yeaaa
So basically he's the one who's going to make the "future" possible
I am new to this channel but this was really inspiring. Do great things, have a great life.   My final message: Change da world
Ive watched you grow for the longest time and i still remember the old shop and the first video ive seen of you and you made my childhood great Edit: the first video ive seen of you was your 3d printer pen video from 5 or 6 years ago and can you still do a wall spin of a car?
Dang man that speech at the beginning really hit my feels, but you really do need a break for a minute.
NOO DONT CUT IT
Anyone who dislikes the hacksmith's videos don't appreciate hard working people.
You rule
Why. Who hurt you?
im afraid of this guy being the first jedi
First he wanted to be Tony stark and then Gordon ramsay
Who dares hit the dislike after that beauty speech of how some people dare disrespect him or his team when to be honest most likely everybody on his team is smarter than any of his subs love you and your team
Tbh the play button looks pretty cool at 14:15
Hacksmiths earns a diamond play button...  Also Hacksmiths: L E T S  C U T  I T  I N  H A L F !
I want him to start a school teaching all of this
12:22 thank me later
Very awesome
The dedication to create and inspire is honestly God tier and I've been uploading everyday for 4 days and its really hard I get depressed and feel like I'm not going anywhere with my channel to getting 80 views max and since there's so many channels like mine its so hard to grow a community to where I can entertain, but you've been doing it for 5 years and upload once a week which is insane to me thank you
dont worry you're the best bro!
Hey Hacksmith I’ve been watching your for some time now and I really enjoy your videos  Seriously your the best I love your videos you make really good content your awesome  Yo make everyone’s day better😔👌 You inspire a lot of people thank you hacksmith 😌
Love everything you do
A placa a placa QUEBROU
Jacksucksatlife did not like this
LETS GO HACKSMITH
I personally think the new play button looks cooler than the original.
15:25 Hey Youtube, for demonatizing my video I cut your diamond playbuton in half
Thank you for sharing this and your story. Been watching for so long now and it was nice to see you get real before cutting it in half. People forget there’s a human at the other end of a comment, and they have nothing better to do than talk shit because they’re jealous and contribute nothing to society. Keep up the amazing work, keep inspiring, and keep loving what you do!
Now make a lightsaber out of the play button 🙂
What are the credentials you need to be able to work at your industry
Wow this was posted 4 hours ago and he's already nearly at 11 mil
Cast the play button slag into batarangs
Bro many people cant achieve what you are doing and they are still talking.  The logic of these haters are more retarded then themselves.
I'm so proud of this channel, I've been here for awhile and I've seen how it went from a group having fun making fictional things real, to the same thing, but this time waaaay more professional.
Dude, well fuckin said. Too many people and too few ears to appreciate what you said which is quite sad but that's their downfall. You all have done more than people comprehend. Keep it up.
DAMN these guys are committed! They earned a diamond play button, and now they are going to use that diamond play button to make a video like the one that they made to get be able to achieve the play button in the first place. Confusing stuff. :/
Other YouTubers: I’m going to cherish this forever, ten mil special coming soon!  The Hacksmith: our ten million special is cutting the play button in half
yay
Hey man awesome video an awesome outreach idea would be to sponsor some FIRST teams in the area
Not to be mean just I prefer you old hair cut
This made me happy, as Stan lee would say, Excelsior!!!
15:14 oouch my heart is breaking.😂
YouTube: sends hacksmith *diamond* play button  HackSmith: let’s destroy it!
Beautiful speech, love the channel, love the idea, love your passion
10:20 gordan ramsey - being jelouse
You got this man, you’re videos are amazing, i know its hard to see that 1 bad comment out of the 100 and i know it can be a kick in the face, but you are amazing. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. I have been watching your channel since you just started getting Machines for your shop, keep up the good work. We love you.
Can I know when the next cooking episode is 🤣🤣🤣
14:18 it's sad they had to go through with it because it looks beautiful there.
JackSucksAtLife will be sad with this video.
can you next do the hoverboard from back to the future
did not realize the channel name switch till he mentioned it
I wanna eat that diamond play button
No te entendí ni berga no se ingles
I have been here for over 2 years I’m such a huge fan I aspire to be an engineer like you some day.
Hey hacksmith,           Nice beard
did you regret it
DO A MINECRAFT DIAMOND SWORD WITH THE DIAMOND FROM THE PLAYBUTTON! That sounds so cool
Honestly I’m so glad I watched the history of Hacksmith industries, I learned so much more about everything you guys do and it’s amazing!
I don't think insurance will cover my lightsaber went though my diamond play button
You are awesome and don't let anything the youtube haters say get to you. Keep up the good work and know that we all want you to succeed. :D
I feel bad for for you you just ruined your play button!
The only Youtuber who has guts to destroy his own diamond play button😱😱
make the play button into a sword
Youtube is going to kill you
That bed thing they made would be great for literally everyone now. 😂
2:43 but will you read this comment...
8,901 comment
and thats what u should do after u reach 10M subs
Some tuber: Breaks play button  fans: dislike  Hacksmith: does it with a lightsaber!  Fans: It is... Acceptable
Just purchased the play button thanks for letting us have a part of history!
You should make a Ark Survival Evolved Tek Suit. That would be so cool!!
MY OPINION IS THAT YOU DESERVE 20M SUBS 👍👍💪💪👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
WHY DID U DESTROY THE PLAY BUTTON 😭😭😭
You can see the hurt in his voice in the end........
oh no James sounds like he's about to cry
First off let me say I can't wait to see the future of Hacksmith industries! Second,  this is quite possibly the coolest thing I've ever seen!!!
love u i started a channel cause of u guys ❤️. u inspire me a lot❤️
The people that skipped to the end and missed cooking with the hacksmith
I'm always excited to see a new video from you guys! Keep up the amazing work! You guys are so much more than what any hater will say!
How dare u people dislike this video. YOU MONSTERS!!!!
At 14:18 the play button looked so cool.
Ive been watching your channel for years now and you are doing great
One all of use
I've been supporting your channel for years now and I truly do respect your goals, and I hope that all of your aspirations come to fruition. I'm glad you shared the "master plan" with us so that now we, (your supporters) can help you as much as possible.
are you actually gonna destroy thz diamond play button  NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO WHY WOULD YOU DO THATTTTT Your crazyyyyy you literally melted it
No diamond play buttons were hurt in the making of this video
This is an amazing video just really brings the heart warming vibe about life
Don't worry about that 1% man they're just haters
You are so awesome
Plz make your own iron math themed 10mil play button
Wow that’s a speech
I love you hacksmith I will watch your vids until the end of your channel if that ever happens
Hey I know the reason why people dislike your video  "If someone's mind is closed they cannot see with there eyes"
Youtube: * sends diamond play button*  HackSmith: thanks, imma cut it with my light saber now  Youtube: Am I a joke to you?
When you joked a little about having a heart to heart, I wasn't prepared for those 2 minutes of your voice quavering, thanks for all you've done, I'm hoping to get around to build few huge projects of my own some day. I was a UAV maintainer in the army so I'm hoping to build some UAV's of my own, as well as an exo-suit. Also obligatory power loader when comment.
the edge of the table look's like luffy's gear second
Next make civil warrior Helmet
Building your self diamond play button
The play button looks kinda cool when it’s blue and orange
So this is what happen between the unstoppable spear and the unbreakable shield...wait what?
8:13 best quote ever!:)
You should take your melted play button and turn it into a mini Thor’s hammer. Or one of your first Hacksmith projects.
I still dont understand why people complain and dislike your videos.I like this history of your youtube and i lke your vids but why do they complain tho
Idk why but seeing the hacksmith cook and season a diamond play button was the happiest moment of my quarantine
Hello! is this HowToBasic? Yeah, i found your impostor, he cooked a diamond play button
I may not understand the whole being famous and negative comments thing, but in my mind the solution is simple. Ignore the BS people are saying and listen to the positive stuff. It's "just" YouTube. There are lots of trolls and assholes here (I sometimes fit into one of those categories). So just do what I do when people are insulting you: Simple don't give a flying f***. However: If you were talking about feedback (the useful kind), then just listen, think about it and see if they are correct or not. There is a famous german YouTuber who is also worried about what people might say about what he does. I simply do not understand why. It just doesn't matter and one shouldn't listen if that is such a big problem. <asshole mode> Just grow a pair. People aren't nice. Deal with it. </asshole mode>
Thank you for the videos they have always made me happy.
Yo for your next video you should improve one of your really older creations
To all the people who give him negative feedback about his channel, you try doing all the stuff he does.  You build your own youtube channel from the ground up, go head do it, i'll be waiting.  But The Hacksmith won't, he has amaing projects to build and millions of fans to create content for.  He isn't your average youtuber, he is built different.  I don't know how long I have been watching him but what he does is amazing.  He is one of the coolest channels out there.   I love all that you do Hacksmith!!!!!
Other youtubers: alright guys let's take a look at the diamond play button that we all worked so hard... The hack smith: hold my drink
I don't even know someone on earth rather then you telling people that movies are not friction they can be real you just have to start......  I really appreciate your work. Keep doing it......
Most of us koi eat you
Imagine if you used oxyacetylene
Like a gas mask
that's why you trolls must stop because its not easy to think and make something
Holy shit.
Make a mask that both looks cool, and protective
No way i could do that, not sure what's wrong with you guys for destroying a very precious and rare thing like that
Can you make a real kylo ten lightsaber with the plasma pls it’s my birthday
I was shocked when I saw the thumbnail cause that's new 🤦
You should finish flying like iron man its what got me to sub to you way back then and it was a rlly good series
I love the plan for the Chanel
I love you bro
Actual chefs looking at the cooking show: *no*
We all miss you Grant 💔
this video makes me cry ( you my favorite youtuber)
James' facial hair and head hair are different colours lol
don't mind the haters they wouldn't know how much you guys go through  to make great content
Who knew he would be cutting a 10M play button with a lightsaber in 5 years?
If there was heart button as well as the like button, I'd give a million. Love ya James, make videos however you want to, and take as long as possible. We can wait
"so naturally we going to cut it in half"
makes me sad they ruined the button
This dude on the verge of breaking down shatters my heart. Keep your chin up king and dont let people drag you down
Hacksmith: 10.8 million subs and diamond play button  Some YouTubers: 11 million subs and no playbutton.
In my school we watch you videos
The dish look delicious ngl
Youtube be like: 👁👄👁                              🕳👄🕳                              👁👄👁
I have been your subscriber and fan for a very long time and i always watch your every video i didn't skip the video 1 bit
your hair is so long
So, are you saying you plan to sell lightsabers?
damn lovin the beard tho
Normal Youtubers: Diamond play button's so dope  Hacksmith: I think it's better than normal play button
Make the Mandalorian costume and blaster the one that shot the Jawas and disintegrated them you don't have to make it disintegrate though
i like your plan
This guy is the awakening to our furture
He’s not the real Tony it’s that his team is the real iron legion
He tried to make red diamond
90% of us would KILL to have a diamond play button Yet he casually cuts one in half
All the geek stuff that I use to escape from the real world, I get to see all the stuff in the real world. Thank you.
I watched the entire video and.... 😭
Idea   Plasma gun  Thats all i have
I started tearing up when you talked about Grant I can't believe it's been over a year already 😢
No cap, the play button with the gold in the middle looks dope
Youtube CEO cry in corner .
You just receive the diamond play button and the you melt it......cool!!!
🐐🐐🐐🐐
wow, this person really is the real and way better tony stark i love you :D
When it whole turned blue it was looking better then the actual one     Thanks for 1 like which is also done by me!
Se o Aruan já se "ferrou" por cortar uma de 100 mil...

Dont lesson to all the people that dont agree with how yall do your projects am ok with one a week just bc of how advanced your projects and your team is and your leading the team with out you the team wouldn't exist thank you for yourube channel you have inspired me and encouraged my ideas
I love your Channel
You should melt the play button down into a mini play button and give them out to only members
Jesus Christ i cried.....
Your work is great, and honestly I don't think I'd be that interested in engineering, and electronics if it weren't for you. Thanks.
Thank you so much y’all are so smart and creative I think you will do great things in your life you inspire me and other people that’s inspiring that’s great keep on doing great things hacksmith
YouTube: no more play button for you
Hey James and all of Hacksmith Industries. I’m a long time subscriber and I am always thrilled to see your videos. I am studying ME in college and I just want to thank you for all you do. I am an engineer because of people like you. You are truly inspiring and keep it up. Maybe I could be on your team some day!
i cried when you talked about your plan
haven't watched yet and guessing it just burns up b/c Dimond is just really compact coal  edit: ok i was wrong
Hacksmith your starting to look more and more like a Viking  as the weeks go by
Aruan 2.0
I'm honestly not sure how so many other channels have reached 10 mil before this one.
They grow up so fast :')
Been here since the exoskeleton man
I am such a big fan and you are inspiring me to take the path im taking in school and in life ive been watching since you just started and were still a smaller youtube channel I stumbled apon that no one knew about so i shared with all my friends and we all love your videos and i would do anything to meet you and the amazing team behind this channel and the industry and see all the amzing projects i know you wont see this but i hope you do keep it up:)-alexander
I remember back in the day I mocked you and called you the HacksMeth. I apologized and James accepted my apology...
I like your vids
👏
My heart was transformed back to my 12 year old nerd self
You are legend man
Thank you for inspiring me to pursue my goal and love for science, I've always loved this stuff since I was 5. I saw one of your first videos on building the lightsaber. I clicked on it and expected to see something like Luke Skywalker's lightsaber to be held in your hands. As I grew older and more mature, I started to understand how challenging and unrealistic these things can be. But I just keep watching your videos and I just want to say thank you James and everyone else at the Hacksmith Industries for inspiring me to become and engineer. Thank you.
Build idea a working yu-gi-oh duel disk with build in hologram projector like the anime
I want to see you and your business grow worldwide in the near future.
👍👍
Good luck with your plan
Uh oh don't tell JackSucksAtLife 😂
Ideas:Limb enhancers from Steven Universe with the complete feature: •Ability to lift large weight •Retractable screen in your left palm •Electric/plasma ball launcher •Taser Finger •Ability to run fast
Did anyone get the reference at the beginning? I mean cmon your aiming that at your generation.
I really miss Grant. I find it hard to understand change so it was really hard for me but even now, I still forget... Grant really is missed
My this video hit me hard when he mentioned Grant
Thank you for these amazing 14 years filled with innovative creations! Congrats on 10 mil, may you achieve your goals :)
Why man why the playbutton😂😂
👋🏻 hi
I always have and always will love your videos James. Your videos make up 85% of why I aspire to be a great engineer someday like you, the other 15% is because of fast and furious.  When you were talking about your journey, it hit hard,  real hard. Not gonna lie, I got emotional during that part. Being here on the other side of the screen, watching your amazing journey since day 1. Keep up the amazing work bro, I totally understand if you need a break from YouTube. I’ll always do what I can to support this amazing channel. If you need a shoulder to lean on, I’ll be there for you....    My mouth started salivating when you were cooking the play button.
I watch you like 6 yeryes
Ummm, the disliker dislike the vid coz there jealous or coz they fail doing it, so chill
Heart💜❤
Make a kuiber crystal
Is there a way I can privately chat with you?
Is a case hardened playbutton
The one thing that almost no one ever gets destroyed by a lightsaber
I came to this video to see a lightsaber cut through a Dimond play button but I got so much more. That was very inspiring and I thank you for that.
You guys should make ichigo swords from bleach
Hacksmith: finnaly gets their diamond playbutton    Also hacksmith: ah yes, L E T S C U T I T I N H A L F !
Hey Hack, you think you could refine a ship design I have for one of your more tame episodes? Would like to see your take on my near-future logistics vessel.
The video starts at 12:22 ...the last 4 minutes of a 16 minutes video
Is this how you make that new element for the Iron Man core? Jokes aside, really looking forward to seeing everything you guys can accomplish! Keep it up!
Well done sir!
hacksmith: I used the thing that got me the play button to destroy the play button
is it just me or is that play button built stronger then the safe they cut open?
Thanks to the Hack Smith industries they inspire people all around the world
wow I almost cried when he mentioned grant
"Close the Blast-Doors! That will hold them!"
Awesome video not sure what to say past that you are just a super smart person that is sharing your talent with others. Thanks for sharing.
Damn can we just get the button blue like that? It looks so much cooler
❤️
Bruh
He should melt down the entire play button and make something cool
Dude u have my 100%support 💯💯💯💯💯💯
the one thing that grew more than the Hacksmith's channel is he's beard
Can you mass produce an affordable EV for customers?
The Hacksmith has certainly lived up to The Hacksmith
Play button: literally cut in half and half of it melted off with 5 different colors  Hacksmith: I think this is better then a regular play button
I love your videos and these lightsaber ones are great but Youtube is probably out for vengeance after this
love your vids keep it up
Ccb
I love ur vids Hacksmith! Your creations are probably the best I’ve seen! Keep up the good work! And tell your team they are the best!
I love how many mcu and other references were in that speech😂😂
Can’t wait to see what you do in the future. The plan sounds great. Can’t wait to see all the great things you make. Congrats on ten million 🥳
The moment he mentioned Grant I started crying a little
i've come to realise that this man actually inspired me to make my own machines, in video games of course.  he didn't just inspire future mechanics, but future coders, game developers, even possibly artists. so i think that as a community we can say thank you back to this man who has inspired so many of us.
I love your video and I hope you keep on uploading them I have learned so much from your videos than you so much.
Lightsaber vs play button jacksucksatlike:sad noises*
THAS MA BOY MANNNN 😭😭😭
dont worry about the haters bruh
Legend
Hacksmith Industries: Gets a Nobel Peace Prize  Also Hacksmith Industries: chops it in half with a lightsaber
You know those are 3000$
The all you been waiting for 16:37 thank me on like 👇
Im sorry u officaly ran out of ideas.
You should try more cooking shows ur really funny!
I have watched your vids since I was seven and I have always loved watching and I love how creative and intelligent you are all keep up the good job ✌️
Whoever dislikes, are the truest scrubs of all
Hacksmith I just want to say I agree with you and I love all of your video's. You make me want to work hard and learn more about science. I know that one day you will get to your goals someday and i will help you as much as I can.
Through all that hair and beard I can still see the guy who built awesome shit in his backyard
bro you can hear in his voice he wants cry i just got a lot of respect for him
thats so cool
Try a Ruby play button.
Bro that cooking part broke my brain 🤣
Hi
Congrats on 10mil subs, I wish the best to you
This Chanel is a nerds Dream  I am happy my dream is real
I was a fan since pre million but I still just want to watch it get cut in half
Only you tubers with a lightsaber can get the obsidian play button
I love your stuff! You bring out my inner child and that alone makes my day! Keep up the good work!
Thank you for everything u have done I’ve watched you since 3 years ago if it wasn’t for you my imagination wouldn’t be so big
I dont even know why tour doing this if i where you i would not do it
I'm tearing up, Grant was one of my favorite YouTubers and when James started I just couldn't hold it back. I'm so glad James has detected part of his video to Grant. You guys need to continue doing what your doing, you are a motivation to so many people.
Mann yoou need yo buy  a diamond play button
this is the most wholesome thing I’ll ever see and I know it for a fact
Your back story is amazing and some parts are sad😭so inspiring!
You are so awesome and I wish u could meet you
We love u
The whole beginning made me cry I love you man we all appreciate what you do for us 🥰
Gonna click that subscribe so fast             When they make the next-gen lightsaber.
Hell yeah!!! Buying hacksmith prototypes, that's awesome
This channel is amazing thanks for your content oh and 1 more thing can you make the blade more longer plz but  you don't have to do that. By the way you lightsabers are awesome.
Why do we need an hour long sob story
I'd love to purchase some stock in Hacksmith industries
11:15 he do be flexin on us
I really like ur content good job
Loved your plan. Love you ❤️
What you do is incredible!!! I wouldn’t of thought in a million years that someday lightsabers, iron man suits etc could even exist! Congratulations to the hack smith industries team!
You need to collaborate with the YouTube channel (What’s Inside?) And then cut a bunch of things open with all your inventions!
Nooooo why u do thatttt
YouTube: "Am I a joke to you?"
Honestly I would of stopped when it turned blue and hopes it stayed that way it looked sick
skip the first 12:24 if you just want to see the play button!!
the era of superhero its begin, iam so excited  🤗🤗🤗
I was hesitant to click on this video as a og of this channel 😂😂poor play button
We support u
You are one of those many few youtuber who is actually going beyond the idea of being responsible to your subscribers.
Absolute madlads, destroying the the thing that a very small percent of skilled people get.
looks actualy cool
if only you clould make it 1 million times hotter and make it solid
Hacksmith just say f**k u haters
Your IQ is 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 man that's so huge!
Really proud of y’all great job
Aruan lvl HARD
He really just burnt one of the most hard things there is to get
Could you teach me how to do things like you, you inspire me a lot
I was really getting hit in the feels.      I'm not crying you are.
In the middle of your speech I was kinda tearing up congratulations your a inspiration to everyone
the damage to the play button represents the hard journey to get to wher there at now
Keychain merch would be cool
Change the world you can do it you have change people life like mine I was super lazy till I watched your videos then I started to make things so change the world you can do it
Cast the melted play button into a Hacksmith logo.
The best thing about these videos is i can watch with my kids
You're the best man! Keep it up!! 🔨
I'll be honest, it makes me sad that you destroyed the fruit of all our subscriptions
I know that this industry will go far. When I get more subscribers on my channel (not this channel, my gaming channel) I will give you an insane shoutout. My channel is called KStream - Minecraft. Look out for a shoutout video!
Thank you for your amazing technology that has changed the world
That is a beautiful beard, but it made  it hard for me to actually focus on anything else XD
Love you
One day i hope to join the hacksmith team and help engineer all sorts of stuff. Keep up the amazing work you guys inspired me to start studying programming and I hope you guys stay safe this quarantine
The " master plan " is Elon Musk sized brain.    *So very very very very large brain*
whe are you going to actually strike with the saber?
Why would u do such an awful thing
You guys have come a long way, and I’m glad I have been watching throughout the process :,)
Well done! Congratulations!
They should make a sword out of the play button
JackSucksAtLife needs to see this, if you don’t know him he collects play buttons
why
Sure, lots of youtubers have a diamond play button, but how many of them have one cut in half by a lightsaber?
James is an amazing speaker, you could tell it was from the heart it just wasn’t generic yknow.
The blue was beautiful.💙
Love the plan love your vids
Im now looking for the angry comments
Jack smith should get a refund on his diamond play button. He should say that his play button spontaneously melted in half
PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PLAEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GOT 12 SUBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i almost cryed
I still love your contact
So pewdiepie has 10x more subs than this channel. Somehow. And people are still asking why world is, let's say, not particularly good. But enough of negativity, great job, Hacksmith! 👍👍
Jedi
Why did you have to bring grant's memory back you made me cry  But your right life is short you should go on a vacation like grant said😭👍
Can u be a iron man jdi
You just made me tear up..... I miss watching grant......
You may want to rebrand your professional image to just smith industries, hacksmith sounds like your botching everything (which you're not) and while you have an active YouTube community the general publics first impression is invaluable, look at Dyson for god sake, all they make is shitty Hoover's and one hair dryer that doesn't look normal yet if you ask the general public they think their engineering god's.
He’s like the mad scientist Jesus
I love your Channel
8:50 --Does anyone else think this looks like Tom Hanks?
I am proud of this man it would be great if you help me achieve big lightsaber for soviet union military arsenal
Gordon Ramsey jelly of this new and upcoming Chef
Bro why he cut the 10 million play button tho
Keep going man!!! We need you! You are a living legend.
I am so proud of what you’ve done
Im telling you we will look back at this video in 15 years into the future while hacksmith industries is a multinational company,love these videos and lots of luck :)
RRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I sawed my play button in half...Go buy some flex tape
Hey everyone at hack smith I know that I’m just one small person in a vast ocean of millions but I appreciate everything you do for your community and the rest of the world. Thank you
Merch 😄
You should make a school for engineering  I would go
I feel you bro
Let’s get The Hacksmith to 50 mil subscribers
Love every video man you and your team do amazing things and I'm always in for a good time when I open a Hacksmith video. I already wanted to go into the engineering/design field and your videos really show me this is something I want to do, keep it up!
Try to build a railgun with a vacuum tube with ionized gas inside
12:48 thank me later😄
Paused at 14:19 THAT PLAY BUTTON LOOKS AWESOME If I ever get one of them thats what I will do XD
This is PAINFUL TO WATCH (the cooking) because i dont even have 100 subs lol
you guys are incredible
0:44 just like your beard XD And hopefully they'll both keep doing that! Your adventure is awesome and inspiring! Thanks for sharing it with us all :)
I just love the fact that hacksmith industries treats his play button as shit but everyone else treats they're like a baby
You should try to make a firework that shoots out of a backpack just a suggestion sorry if this comment offends you
12:22
Well said... keep up the amazing work. I can only dream of doing what you do.
When he said a dash of lemon, it reminded me of the two shots of vodka meme
Mark rober and hacksmith shuold work together
Why would you do that???
U just made it better
Tbh, I didn't care much for cutting the button.  I did care about your speech though.  We all know how hard you try.  And it's awesome to see what you create.  You've inspired so many to get into engineering and inventing.  I joined the Navy and I'm going in for Aviation Electronics because I couldn't understand any of the electronic terms you guys talk about.  I want to minor in mechanical engineering because I was inspired by the stuff you do.  Like I was floored by the lightsaber and the A.I.  You, and all the people at Hacksmith Industries, are amazing.  Good luck in your Master Plan.  You've gotten this far.  Just keep doing what you're doing.
Make a suitcase gun like from the kingsmen
Only legends watched to the end of the history
Anyone else think that this made his diamond play button unique for him? I think this is actually really cool! Thanks Hacksmith
I have been subbed since 700k
You are a Jedi master
Can I please intern
Half of mw is like why the play button the others like "HELL YEAH BROTHA"
I’ve been watching the Hacksmith for a very long time and I really appreciate what the Hacksmith and his crew have done to give free entertainment to everybody that is curious.
Boi caveman beard I love it
This channel makes the phrase "you're nerd!" A complement
2035 Hacksmith: I MADE A HYPERDRIVE!
I also would destroy my button if i ever got one but has anyone not destroyed/cut yhe buttons
So glad this was in my recommended videos
YES JAMES, YOU’RE THE BEST. LOVED THE VIDEO. KEEP IT GOING, AND MAKE THAT INTERNATIONAL BUISNESS THINGY❤️😂😂
Hacksmith is little bit emotional
In my opinion you are the best youtuber that I have ever seen and I've seen A LOT of youtubers
You can clearly hear the emotional in his voice.. Awww..
was it a real play button or a prop
If i had any engineering knowledge then id apply to work with Hacksmith Industries.
I wouldn't be surprised if in the future they would make a Photon Hidden Blade. Or that Laser like gun from Quake.
Indeed you have been one of my inspirations for keep trying to make better and better prototypes for trainers and knives
I hope he knows he can buy a replacement button
You must be a stupid
Leave it to the hacksmith to make a better diamond play button than YT at least before it completely melted
great video I, love  your inventions!
Cool
A real lightsaber WOW I’m amazed
Grant's part hit me🥺
this is making me excited that in the future i can tell my grandkids that i was there when hacksmith industries first started
I love you <3
The smith of YouTube air yeah🤗
Hy
You look like you're homeless right now
Hacksmith: *Gets an award for a lifetime achievement* Hacksmith ten seconds later: Let's see if we can cut this puppy in half with a lightsaber
I love your chanle you inspired me to make a youtube chanle
Congrats James! I always love when a new upload comes out, and I've been around since the Siege hammer and shield builds. keep up the great work guys! You guys are all amazing, and got me even more interested in engineering. Enjoy the added fame, and good luck on the expansion!
*Gets diamond play button* Youtuber: Let's try to destroy it
And I love your videos and with me watching this I Kind of want to do the same plan,And I have for a while.
In 20 years they're gonna have a whole business and probably selling things like cars
Make a the hawkeye's bow and arrow
I wish hacksmith industries the best of luck 😇😇😇
he went from captain america to kaveman
Question:do you watch anime?
Hello there
8:38 Just build guns bro
James do u still accept co op students
how much for the play button??
Nice 👍
Wish I could even be close to the James with a YouTube career
hacksmith: gets diamond thing...then lets burn it!
I don't usually comment a whole lot but listen up the hacksmith does have lots of fun and he makes it look simple sometimes but it really isn't I've known that for a while which is why when I make a comment I don't really expect it to be read and that's fine but I want to say that it's not his responsibility to make every one of you happy there will always be a video that some like more than others so if you have critisism make sure he knows it's not a complaint or being disrespectful he works so hard and even though he does seeing someone make a mean comment can make all of them feel unanticipated  this channel was born the same year as me being n 2006 so unfortunately I wasn't there from the beginning but I still LOVE the hacksmith channel and no offense james but I'm a bogdan fan and I'm sorry if I butchered that name but still. Anyways I'm not sure where I was going with this but this is how it ended.
The people who dislike are people who arent worthy of leading scotland like you
I hope mr beast helps you
KEEP ON CREATING NEW THINGS AND VIDEOS, WE WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU GUYS!!
just bought the button. I want to say thank you ever so much man. You and grant have brought me a lot of entertainment over the years, and even inspired me to start working on more practical stuff in my life, especially DIY type stuff. I’m sure you’ve had this effect on a lot of young folks, and i’m so overjoyed at this thought. Thank you for the years of smiles, awe, and intrigue.
It’s a PROTOSABER! stop saying it’s a lightsaber in the dam video title. I like you guys but come on
I remember watching this channel shortly before 1 million subscribers and I haven't stopped so far
Congratulations
the speech he gave was touching
I hope YouTube gives you a new play button because you deserve after everything
Limited edit to hack smith himself....          The Lava play button!
Why did you wast a peice of history
You made a holo play button lol
you know something is quality when it can survive a lightsaber for several minutes
Who else noticed the name changed 'The Hacksmith' into 'hacksmith industries'? 👇
Buddy's gotta hit some more hammer curls
Can't wait what are they gonna doing with red diamond play button
I from Indonesian

Lol Antscanada made an ant farm out of a play button, this dude... just destroys his
You have a dope channel dude,
you should cast the molten play button into your next lightsaber.
Been her since the captain America shield from 4 years ago
Can you make a video with Bobby Duke arts he makes super cool stuff like you that is my I think you should make a video with him
You should cast a custom hacksmith play button
Sorry
you should try and make an irl droid.  idea inspired by what it sounds like with that gas mask on
At this point you are one of those 1000 degree knife people
You’re the big boi! We fkn love you man! Keep up the gud work, those who say bad things...they sus asf
But it was still good
Your a fantastic man doing fantastic things with an incredible team. Keep on changing the world. Love your videos and can’t wait to see what else you guys accomplish.
I will use diamond play button armor😀
Plot twist: That was just a replica and the real plate is still on its way.
I love you guys so much!! Been here since 300k, and I love seeing this order side of the channel!! So excited for the future of the business especially being a business student from Ottawa CA.
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
He bled his diamond play button and it turned dark?
We love you..😍😍😍
Great business plan, not even lying. All achieved
My friend, from engineer to engineer, I understand what your doing, and have nothing but respect for you. You inspired me to start engineering. Keep up all of your amazing work! I hope you reach 50 million and above.
This inspired me so much
Now I don’t know how hard it is but a cool idea would be to make a particular accelerator
Just witnessing such an intense and emotional evolution brings tears to my eyes.
Sometimes I wonder if I ever see a YouTube video we’re you make a iron man suit that flys
15:05 "Congratulations sir, you've created a new element"
Hey you're awesome ! Did you know about that ?
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
14:27. It looks cooler like that
You are the Tony Stark of the real world
Super heroes already exist and there all the good people in the world that are making a big or small difference
When you scrolled through one of your videos I saw Grant Thompson and I got so sad that he died
The fact that it isn’t until 13 minutes into the video is stupid. Won’t watch another video of theirs.
Thank you for being here when other couldn’t Eric JAMES Reiner
Don’t get me wrong I absolutely love this video but u didn’t actually cut through the diamond, just the metal part😄😕
How Many people didnt skip? I,m one of those people😁
Here before 11mil
So his plan is to go from a Youtube channel to another Elon Musk? Alright, may the best Elon Musk win.
I hope one day I can do a co-op there🤩
I’ve been here since the original wolverine claws video! Love your content and will be here always!
Imagine trying to rob this guy
I'am do proud of you! I remember watching you while you have 500k subs now you have 10 mill!!!❤ congrats!!
I am Indian but I am very happy to see you
It doesn't matter if you are in every video or not, if you help on every project or not, what matters is what you choose to do. and since you are doing that and if you are happy, then I think that we should all be happy with you. You are my favorite person on here, and always will be.
Why.
i fr watch a cooking show if he made one
You guys should make a play button axe
You guys should do that on the engine it was in my semi that blew up
You're welcome.
I don't mean to be mean but I would keep that instead of cutting it
Next you should try and do real durable bullet proof clone armour
You should stretch out your vids more so then there will be a little more content and I would like to see more constructing
You are really inspiring. I found your channel about a year ago when my friend got me into marvel movies. I thought the channel was cool back then but what really made me a huge fan was when I saw the city of Kitchener,  WLU, and U of W stickers on the wall I could not believe that such a amazing channel was located in the city where I was born, raised and currently studying in. I'm currently in my final semester at WLU for computer science. Next year I will be doing  my post-grad at U of W, after that I would love to join the team if an opportunity presents itself at the time! Best wishes from right here in Kitchener!
I e,m 12
12.22
I swear to god the entire internet would watch if you made just video after video of cutting things with it
I don’t understand WHY DID YOU DETSTORY YOUR BUTTION
I came here to see a lightsaber, not to cry😪
Feel the beard
YouTube: send a  DIAMOND Button   hack smith: “meeeeeeeee destroy!!!!” Destroys it
I Watch all those videos when I was 9 years old I watched my first one
When you take time out of your life to complain on how a person made a freaking realistic lightsaber I feel bad for you cuz thats stupid.
Big dreamer much. Lol. Honestly though, you just got the dimond freaking play button. How
Do you think it would be at all possible to create a gravity chamber( increases the weight of gravity in a specific area). Just wanted to know as I am a huge fan of Dragon Ball Z, especially Vegeta, I just love his whole character and training routine
Damn I remember when the channel was at 400k 🤯
Nice video
HELL YEAH HACKSMITH INDUSTRIES. You've done so much and inspired me to design my own projects. Keep going strong, buddy!
A little off topic, but are you still friends with Eli from ZNA Productions?
I only been watching your channel for a few months. I think you have an awesome vision in moving forward in your business. Good luck in your future endeavors. I'll  keep wathing, I love your channel and your team.
Turn the molten metal into tiny play buttons as well
The diamond play button, it brokey
👍🏻👍🏻🙏🏼👍🏻👍🏻 we are with you
Aruan e seus multiversos. Um deveria ter alertado ao outro que isso pode da muita merda.
This is like the “what’s inside”
Respect to your bit about Grant Thompson..... 😔
YouTube: I hope he enjoys the play button we worked hard to make! Hacksmith: *I CUT MY DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON IN HALF WITH A LIGHTSABER!!!* YouTube: W-what
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a cooler channel in my life
turn the metal in the play button into a sword, that’d be dope as hell
Everyone send this to jacksucksatlife
p.s. all great pioneers and genius' start somewhere, that's where engineers like you come in
You should totally make the blaster backpack from season 1 ep 6 of the mandalorian
Superb
Mad respect!
Hacksmith intustries: You can tell this one is fresh because we dont have 11 million subscrbers yet.  Me but you will soon! :)
Why youtube made only one like button
Thank you for all the great,  no I mean awesome, videos you guys have done for us.
YouTube: I feel a disturbance in the force
❤️❤️
tbh if anyone is gonna find a way to make superheros real, its gonna be one of you guys
Putains mais va chez le coiffeur et passe faire aussi un tour chez le barbier !!! T'es revues sont vraiment de plus en plus nuls !!! Ça en devient vraiment lassant et exaspérant !! Et de surcroît tu te fous complètement de ceux qui te font vivre tes délires skysomaniaco dépressif !!! C'est vraiment dommage d'en avoir autant trimmer pour finir comme ça !!! Tu me fais trop penser au film de scare face !!! Tu te fume toi même !!!! Continue comme ça va, profite autant que tu peux !!! Mais rien n'est éternel !!! C'est dommage !!! Pour moi tu avais du talent !! Mais aujourd'hui il ne te reste que t'as grande gueule et surtout ton égaux super développé !!!! Tu m'as saoulé !!! Tchuss
Thanks for the amazing content.  Hope you projects are made safe and amazing.  Thank you hope for another long history of this channel.
I know I need to learn but when you explain how you make it I just go right asleep....btw I love your channel I think you’ve been showed on the news
The problem with this video is that if you reach another milestone you get a kind of ruby thing that fits in the middle
Hey YouTube, WHAT THE HECK IS THAT THING MADE OF!?!?!
Im still waiting how to built Death star
the button glowed because he pressed it, WITH A FLAME OF 10 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!!!
Bruh light saber is 3feet long but yours is short and light saber ia 20.000 degress
Well done dude, and to all of the negative people in the comments can you chill out
Maybe you and I Pop should be friends
"And just a dash of lemon" proceeds to squeeze the life out of a whole lemon. Also the hacksmith team makes the best projects ever!
Look james your a spectacular inventer a great man i love seeing every single crazy invention that comes out of this channel and trust me its well worth the wait ive been here for about a year and i cant tell you how many times you inspired me and made me belive that the impossible is just waiting to be solved that the extraordinary takes work but it can happen to anyone YOU MADE A DAM MECH FOR CHRIST SAKE how many people on this planet can say they made a lightsaber mech a spy car a laser cannon a preditor helmet ONLY ONE MAN and thats you your an inspiration and i dont care if you upload once a week once a month or once a year!! Id still be subscribed your truly amazing
I think the future is on you
Thank you for all the entertainment you have gave us and all the inspiring things you have gave us. I love your brand and what you stand for. I have been Subscribe for a long time now and I can’t get enough. I hope you go far!❤️❤️😊
Am I the only one who thought that play button was looking kinda tasty when he was placing the seasoning?
15:09 pause and look at it
Is it aluminum?
You have done well and it's been a good journey
Fast forward to 12:29. You're welcome.
Congratulations James, you have truly made an empire and you (and your team) deserve everything you have worked so hard for.
Today we smoked a diamond play button, then ate it.
Hey man you look good shaved.
So inspired by this. Keep it going
I'm just going saber this moment.
"... And when everyone's super, no one will be." - Syndrone
I’ve loved your channel from when I started watching
You’re not a Tony Stark, you’re Xavier, an inspiration....
He about cried. If anyone complains or makes a negative comment they are gay.
man, that play button is Sturdy! congrats guys you totally deserve/earned all the support (also apologies for any past, present & future unpleasant comment)  you know... i actually dig the burnt colors more, also having the Play actually glow? Youtube take notes =p
WHY WOULD U BURN THIS. YOU WAITED 10 YEARS FOR THIS
Y u had to melt the play button? You could give it colours but like y u break it?
Make hulkbuster with aall your gates i am not complanting just sujesting
When was the channel’s name changed to Hacksmith Industries?
How many of you guys actually watched his life story?
If you thing he is the best at what he does give a thumbs up  👇
Jacksucksatlife be here like: :O
i watched this guy along time ago good job blowing up keep up the good job
grant Thompson lived in my grandma's neighborhood
I've been watching ever since the original Wolverine Claws video. It's incredible how far you've come since then. You truly have a working industry now and I'm 100% looking forward to seeing you expand further! I was wondering how you could top the lightsaber, but your master plan is just what I was hoping you were planning.
I feel you man, trying to entertain everyone can be hard because there is a number of people who's criteria to them that you don't meet or they just complain because they try to put others down to make them seem like they are on top, don't let them put you down, even if they try, just know that there are massively greater numbers of people who have the patience and give you what you deserve because if you put the effort to entertain you're viewers and subscribers, they give back either through patronage or other means. when i starting watching your channel about 3 or 4 years back i thought your channel would burnout due to the costs of the projects that are awesome in theory but costly in reality, but your channel grew both in size of facilities, crew, and projects, giving others a dream to pursue what they want to do in life if they put forth the effort. keep on inspiring hacksmith and keep growing.
cooking episode😂🤣
Love your videos
who else wants cooking with the hacksmith to be a full on series...
What has this turned into
Petition to make The Hacksmith a National Geographic show. Sign here ⬇️
Congrats Hacksmith you guys are all the best thank for all you have done and don’t forget you guys are appreciated.
I want to work with you HACKSMITH
4:50, if you want to cry just cry, it will release all the sorrow
When I was at university computer aided design was still quite new and basic, you would watch Star Trek TNG, see flat handheld computers and think how futuristic. Compared to what you can actually get and do now, that all seems outdated, with things like the capabilities of mobile phones, computers, 3D printing etc. But one thing that is still required is human imagination, what you do and others like you is inspire people, spark that imagination and the whole process, who knows where that will lead in the future.
!BEST! !DIAMOND! !PLAY! !BUTTON! !EVER!  Seriously though you guys have inspired so many people including me. I would say you guys are incredible but that doesn't even come close to what you and your team has and will achieve! Thank you!
11:10 *matt stonie who already ate his play button* : “nothing but a joke to me”
12:22
"Stark industries" I guess it's starting
Coming from a subscriber before 100k, well done! This play button was very well deserved
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not the diamond play button☹️
dude if you see those people who are rude and give you bad feedback, think that they just are jealous that you are so cool and awesome and can do all of this
Whoever disliked must of skipped to cutting with a lichtsaber, also, we will all support you the fans
Normal people guard play button withvther life  Hacksmith lets destroy it.
my moms brother would love to work for you but not sure if he would want  to go to canada would you eveer open a shop in america

Your goal is amazing! I really hope it works out, but with your skills I'm sure you'll be able to do anything you want! Thank you for inspiring me to do my best at everything!
this is like cleaning a stain with money
Spiders have something like a web fluid to create their webs, it would be great if the team does something with it, create their own web or something like it :3 it’s actually hard to explain but.. I tried ;-;
What if you melt the button and make a sword with it?
"Da Smith"
The world's first sapphire play button.
me looks at thumbnail: THERE IS NO WAY IT HAPPENED ITS A PRANK  after the video: 😳
He sounds like he’s a sith droid who happened to find a lightsaber lol
Can't wait to see my great grandchildren go off to Hacksmith University. But honestly we'll done and I hope there will be a long lasting legacy for the Hacksmith name and the innovation behind it.
Taking the 1000 degree knife to the extreme
tkor: the diamond cracked YouTube will send us a new one  hacksmith: lets burn a hole through it

me writing this while i'm starting to cry while watching the history and future of hacksmith industries
As a youth in the STEM fields, you are such a huge inspiration to me. I've been doing this kind of thing since 4th grade. Hope when I get older I'll find a job in Hacksmith Industries
this is very inspiring i need more vids like this
I thought that he was literally going to slice it in half like a cake
"So what do I want to achieve?"  Commercial break.  Darn you YouTube!  In all seriousness great video. Love your dedication and love for the job.
You should make  lawnmower and trick it up
Hey can you make something from my hero academia?
The hacksmith getting to 10mill is somehow one of the best things I've experienced, and this was just the cherry on top
Robber breaks in the hack smith hello are you ready to get sliced

Let’s test it on the Xbox Series X
It sounded like the mentor died
youtube be like "but why, why would you do that"
This man inspires me he is just amazing keep going man some people just don’t understand how much work you and the entire great hacksmith team do you are all amazing love the videos peace ✌️
Why won’t you just join Elon musk both of you will changes the future

Surprise Twist: Google knew what they were going to do with it, so they sent them a play button made from Titanium and Quartz.  :-P
I’m so happy to see James succeed I have been  watching for ages! Love you!
Plz plz plz plz Don’t listen to the haters. They’re just dumb people writing a YouTube comment. This is my favourite channel on YouTube of all time. My dream is to someday work for Hacksmith industries. No doubt that you will accomplish your master plan.
You guys at hack smith rock and you put some much time into it to
I just realized james kinda looks like @PewDiePie
Good thing I subbed around 7 million
So proud of you and everyone in Hacksmith Industries. Can’t wait for what the future holds.
You should make a new spy car out of a Datsun  240z
13:18 he has 100 mil play button
10:20 this isn't the first cooking with the hacksmith
I've watched your videos for years, I hope you get to accomplish all the goals you set out for yourself and help other with theirs.
Make mikeys rocket board
😇😭😱😨😰😥😢👨‍🔧
You guys should do a collab video with Adam savage....
Anyone else cried wile the big speech 😭
12:40 is when it starts
Dude ur soo talented
Part of me wanted to dislike just for audacity of cutting a diamond play button in half, but you can't NOT like it after you hear his incredibly heartwarming plan.
I'm only asking one thing what will happen if he work at project when he is basically a old man ??
You are my mentor and I love what you are doing with the channel and you should know that 10202020.202 that leave the good comments are there and they are real and they support you and the other one hundredth of a million  that leave those novels of bad comments are still there. But there are more supporting you than there is hating on you so keep up the good work because your videos are some times the one thing in someone's day that makes them smile and I would love if you could show this comment to the people around the industry and maby the fan base because this needs to be seen. Keep the good work going . P.S grant is a favorite YouTube and Romemodel. Thanks for the great videos
They're a good examples of human ingenuity.
The play button is mine hehehehehe
YouTube: we should stop putting real diamonds in those....
12:22
You’ve been growing for so so long keep up the good work and keep posting!

Hacksmith Industries 2030, well guys they said it was impossible, but here we have it, an actual real life light sabre.
Superheroes do exist, you are one of them, inspiring millions into stem and improving the future
if you can be partners with nasa, i wonder what youll do first?
guys imma need to replace the moose memes with the hacksmith on my 50 reasons to move to Canada
Normal youtubers: *Put the diamond button in a neat spot to show it off* The Hacksmith: What if we cut it with a lightsaber?
That was so much cooler than I expected...
Dude dont stress your self out and you are a real super hero and your videos are great and dont let the haters bring you down
Cocielo...
I love your work keep doing what your doing it makes me happy
Miss Grant😪
E
Don't worry about us hacksmith
In regards to the plan that you were talking about, when I get old enough, I want to be part of the expanding team as an engineer.
Sorry but when is the giveaway ending???
Y r u cutting the diamond play button u worked hard to get that
is he died
Do you have the warranty tho?
why are you still putting lightsaber sound effects over it? cool for the demo but now it's just annoying to listen to constantly
Youtube: Congratulations on 10 million!  Hacksmith:
is he died
btw to anyone wondering you can buy up to 10 extras for 3k each so he dident risk hi splay button
This made me cry I smash like :)
"From nothing , to something to everything " From your bedroom , then your garage  and then this ... congratulations !
Dang your cool
Did u know u can buy play buttons
When the play button turned blue it looked like demascus from Modern Warfare (im probably butchering the name)
This man progressively looks more and more like a Viking as the videos go on.
You guys should try Time Travel🤔
Congratulations Mr. Stark. You discovered a new element.
JackSucksAtLife will be devastated..
Wow
Collab with jlaser
Me the nerd in me its just happy to see all your amazing project
Conscientiousness = 99.999th percentile
Correct me if I’m wrong. But did it take longer to punch a hole through the button than the safe?
hell yeah a plan for the future that doesnt involded war
I don’t know if you’ll ever see this comment but I just wanted to say that your videos have inspired me and some kids in my STEM class at school to make a working Iron Man helmet with Jarvis in it and it’ll be able to come apart and be put together like in the movies. Keep up the good work you’re doing something truly amazing and I wish that there were even more people in the world like you!!
You grew more than a team you grew a family full of amazing people and subscribers keep up your amazing work
WOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IS VERY CRAZY
I feel like this indirectly inspired me, and I hope I can reach your level and one day turn my plastic tube with a ribbon glued on it as a handle into a real life lightsaber like you one day.
Ya know tony stark may not be real but u make a more of a tony then ever because uve planned so much and u made so much uve pulled through tuffed out and made a team
If you read all the comments, can you respond to this?
3 hours ago!
My father helps build the maker spaces
Just told them to do the project that you build in the way of them

maybe the hacksmith will be the one that can solve all world problem and that's not all they will be the first that made the human evolution possible
Try to make something like a ray gun that it can shoot at a speed of 750 mph and it can destroy a hard metal
I can’t believe you’ve done that!!!..... just kidding. I’m a big fan of the channel and have been here for a long time. Hope you are able to accomplish your goals quickly. We’re all rooting for you

It looks better on the wall after it has been cut in half by a lightsaber.
Hey wjdp ovo why are you hating on this
I’m actually really surprised he did this😮
Hacksmith: Ima cut this play button in half!  Phil Swift: Allow me to introduce my self
hey hacksmith, you made a half scale cybertruck, now can you make a half scale Bugatti Chiron
God Bless You, You Are A Mentor! To  Me
I luv u bro
Hope you reach what you want ,and I believe in you ❤️💯🔥
Been a loyal fan since 2016 and I am proud of everything you and your team have achieved. Keep doing amazing stuff!!
You can buy a replacement if you guys want from youtube
I didn’t even know about grants loss, when I looked it up I was surprised to see what I saw. I feel bad for the struggle that his family would have to go through
Ur a goat
I'm so sorry that u r being insulted I am not being sarcastic ur videos genuinely make me happy and personally I would like to see you make a Cyclops lazer from X men
I want to be an engineer in 3 years and you have inspired me
I think you guy's are great

We need more cooking with the hacksmith
It would be cool to see a devil may cry make it real episode
Dude.. You are great!!!
I am proud of you man.
The first guy with big enough balls to cut his diomond play button
THe moment you get it you see if it is strong enough to beat a lightsaber
Man I can hear the emotion in your voice, I think grant's advice was very sound. He was a very very wise man.
9:58 Is it supposed to be upside-down?
Why... why destroy the most beautiful thing, or gift given to you!!!!??? Why????????
I find it really emotional how the glowing play botton crystal with the lightsaber behind it reminds me of Ironman's power source turning on for the first time, sort of symbolic. lol
You guys always amaze me with everything you build
You can make the best for the world for everyone
I'm surprised the military hasn't asked this guy to work for them or asked him to borrow some of his and his teams ideas
Aruan Felix liked that
I miss grant :(
Your training is now complete.
Reeee
Why do I feel like him and his team are going to end up creating Halo armour suits with Elon Musk? Idk it could be possible :p
Bloop
Hacksmith: "LIGHTSABER vs DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON!"  YouTube:   *Girl I-*
Damn to know that i watched this “man” who made gadgets for a living and saw that “man” built his channel all the way to 1 mil and hopefully i can see how you and you’re team change the world. Keep up the good work man
Are you able too make the light saver longer because it a little bit short it is still so cool ether way though
diamond play button not diamond?
This actually hurts jacksucksatlife
Honestly, i came here for the play button but the inspirational speech was worth it
Pewds has the ruby play button and James has the molten play button
Space x 2.0 confirmed
Can you please make Mario's Cart
At the end the diamond play button kinda looks like it was made for the iron man MK1 suit the one he made in the cave
Hacksmith: Hey guys! Today, I'm going to cut my Diamond Play Button in half. Doesn't that sound fun? *sound of me facepalming Me: Why God? WHY?!?
I still remember the old garage and your first lightsaber
Im new here, just wanted to say that love what you do and I'm excited for the future of this channel. Also you seem super genuine and nice. Wish you all the best :D Greetings from Norway.
This guy is gonna be the next mr. Beast.
The Hacksmith: 1% Say were doing things wrong Lil Yachty: Man... Fuck them kids bro   congrats Hacksmith industries that really is better than a normal play button
Ok that’s it Who the hell disliked this video

You're the best youtuber💪
I’ve seen this raw strength only once before. It didn’t scare me then, it does now.
I love what you do at what's now Hacksmith Industries, especially when it involves Star Wars or Marvel. And as for those 0.1% of people who say negative things,they can be the next thing you slice in half
You are amazing dude. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
You should cast the left-over play button blobs into rings for the team :D
why? Why? WHY? WHY DO YOU CUT UP YOUR FNFINDSFHSDUFH DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON JEEZUZ
I have been a fan for so long. You are honestly amazing and inspiring.
I’m counting on the hack smith to make my childhood dreams become reality
You guys are exposed to a lot of stress during these projects, once I finish my career as a psychologist, can I help you guys with it?
Imagine YouTube sent them another play button?
Also I would hardcore watch cooking with the hack smith if it was a real thing. Using some cool gadgets to make some interesting things no one else can make
y would u destoy ur playbotun
Hacksmith i love ir videos and followed for a while and I love ur videos and ur goals and I do hope u meet them and more and to be honest u are captain America, Tony stark combined but on real life and keep working hard and pushing man

Thank you for sharing. Great video!
You are one of the greatest inventors in the world and I love every project you have ever made!!!
Hacksmith: I'm gonna destroy a Dimond Play Button with a Lightsaber  Youtube: God Dammit Hacksmith but I'll allow it  please relpy
Now he as two play buttons
@jacksuckesatlife needs to see this it will break his heart
So, not sure if this is the place to put it, but I had an idea for a "Make it real." How about a working "Clutch Claw" from Monster Hunter? Wrist strapped grappling hook with spikes or serration to keep it hooked onto anything, even flesh.  Other than that, Congratulations on the 10 mil subs.
Permission to put two lightsabers on a battlebot?
You should make boba fetts flame thrower, jet pack and gun from the game Battlefront 2
Elon musk stole "master plan" from chancellor williams
Such a great story. We all appreciate what you and your team do.
Love you
I mean they shouldn't have break the thing I mean getting that icon is a true honor among YouTubers you know
The real thing we all look for through his history is the growth of his magnificent beard.
I don’t wanna be that guy but you should stop reading the comments. The thoughts of a vocal minority shouldn’t matter when it comes to your own work.
Congrats on 10 million keep doing great work and keep making amazing videos
Congrats and good luck in all future endeavours:) good old KW is blessed to have you around :)
I love you you too a lot You know I'm a 9 year-old kid I have a year-old man I understand

Thanks for providing such awesome and inspiring content. Looking forward to what comes next!!
For the people that complain about the videos, you dont have to watch the videos, and if you do and dont like it just leave.
You are literaly great, I just got my degree on Mechanical Engineering and I've always wanted to combine all the branches of knowledge of my career, everything from Fluid mechanics, to control systems and some electronics. I think you just achieved the dreams of many Mechanical engineers who really love this beautiful career. Hope one day be at least half as good as you.
11:15  That's what I call a dash of lemon.
12:22
10 mill give away
All I Gotta say is don’t listen to the haters do what you do best and have fun, by the way I love the video
12:22
Imagine a collab with MrBeast
The Hacksmith is an amazing person who has inspired me and is continuing to inspire me. I think his plans are great and I would love to work for you one day. Thank you James.
What did the play button for to you
Dont worry, he can just order an other one for like 500 bucks he just has to call YT
Congrats for 10 mil subs I’ve been watching your videos for 5 years and I hope you the best for the future
YOU GUYS SHOULD MAKE A PHONE BRAND!!! THAT WOULD BE AMAZING

I felt something in my heart....
We’re seeing the makings of a millionaire
I just want you to know that I’ve been watching since like 1,000,000 and I’ve always said you make it big and I think your channel in the future will be more than a channel and, and will be a HUGE business know across the world as HACKSMITH INDUSTRIES
This was a super emotional video.
I love your videos you’re are the one thing I love to look at when I get home from school I have watched you for years you can do it HackSmith Industry is on it’s way
Can't imagine how long you read comments per. Video
is it me or did the playbutton look like Iron Man's chest peice
Hes the new tech god
Normal YouTube’s: Thanks so much for the play button Hack smith: Imma cut it in half
12:43 you’re welcome
I've Benn a fan for a long time I know I joined this year but on my old Channel I was here sence 2009
I like the tall guy
Just one word... Bravo!!!
Hello there
I love your  YouTube video  you are the best
"we managed to cut our 10mil subscriber play button in half with a lightsaber" most legendary quote of all time.
Damn your intro was deeply moving
I wanna see Robbert downy Jr react of their man made Ironman helmet
yes to all 16:37 of this video
Idk if you read these comments but this YouTube channel has motivated me to work on engineering and other stuff and I thank you for that.:)
The colors it turned throughout the process were beautiful! At 13:32 it was black and gold, and I think that was my favorite, but also at 14:25 it was mostly blue with a hint of black, and I loved that, too. Then it turned all different colors at once, and looked amazing.
Is it a real diamond
Why would anyone say something bad about him
❤️much love my man
it took him atleast 3 minute to do that
Finish your power lowder
Is that a real diamond?? Probably not but idk
soy de mexico y aun asi me gustan mucho tus videos aunque no hable ingles
I'm 13 but I really think it would amazing to do the stuff you do. Also I keep thinking if you cut off you're bearded you'd look like John wick, dunno why
Make a real life LAAT? Or maybe a real life robot like Detroit becomes human?
the play button looked so cool when it was blue
Oh, I get it, he isn't the real life Tony Stark, he's the reincarnation of Stan Lee
Ah yes the diamond play button. Something that all YouTubers want. And look at these guys trying to cut it in half.
I love hacksmith he is such a good person
Lol y have 10.8m when im watching this  Keep up the good work ill be around for the years to come
Can I please work there when Im older if this is still runnning
"You can tell it's a fresh play button because we don't have 11 million subscribers yet". sub count at the time of this comment: 10.8M. just barely James, Love the video keep up the great work.
Youtube: creates and gifts diamond play button Hacksmith: melts play button Youtube: ...
Well I know where I want to work for a living
Thera a cooking video but Whers the gaming video Start gaming pls 😭😭😭😭
keep it up man and remember this ''work hard to achieve your dreams'' :) AND CANADA FOR EVER
i am proud to say that i was here at 5 mil
me: why have you done this  Them: Yay its in half now
Man I miss Grant
Hacksmith if you ever get to this message, I need you to know that I’m 10 right now. That would mean I’ll be 20 when your plans start to settle in, so I just want you to know that I’m gonna try my hardest to become like you, because me and my friends have already started on our first project, which is done, it’s basically a card board robot suit, took us 2 months. Besides all my ranting just know that you inspire me greatly 😁
👌
i like the proto saber better
I like where this is going but you say you would like to "better mankind" I don't mean for this to sound brutally honest and more to just be honest but when you make inventions is there any way for them to be eco-friendly? I really don't mean to sound like I am crapping on any invention or project that H.I. has made I really like all of them and have been a fan for a long time now but stuff like the lightsaber is literally burning gases, so it would be nice to see maybe just maybe that is taken into account as much as all the other things at H.I. other than this please keep making the world a better place.
Honestly I have no idea what they even do in these videos, my brain is just out of it all the time, but damn, if it isn’t entertaining!!
Insanely awesome content!
I bet 10,000$ that after 5-10years Hacksmith will be one of the best (or the only best)industry in our Solar System not the World
I'm having an intense nerdgasm right now and it is glorious.
Youtube: Here ya go! a Diamond Play Button! Hacksmith Industries: Let's cut it in half! Youtube: this is not how you play the game
i like how the saber became smaller if it didnt came through
Your channel has been up longer than I’ve been alive
Light saber in black pahoe shiled
You are awesome!
A dash of Mellon squeezes the soul and the life force out of  the poor Mellon
I remember your channel back when it was at 300k now it at 10,000,00!!!!!! Keep up the amazing content!! this channel will forever be one of my favorites
Hey James, love your videos. This nearly made me cry man, youre a beautiful human being I hope you get to see this and I wish you all the best in life.
aruan felix
Why would you do that
Over the months and year or two his hair is so long
Bruh when I get older ima work there as a editor
He sounded really emotional
It was so hard to get a diamond play button and you destroid it in minutes   Do you feel happy or sad 😭😭😭
Is YouTube going to send you guys a replacement for that play button
When he started talking about grant 🥺
James, Ik you hear this often but you are really a light in my life. You’ve inspired me to be hands on and honestly if it weren’t for you inspiring me, I might’ve taken my life, before I started watching you I had several attempts and now that I’m working I have meaning. You got me out of a tough spot keep it up and don’t let the negativity get to you.
I'm so proud of you and your team, way to go! I'm not crying, I'm bawling.
keep doing what you are and remember each awesome thing you make yore inspiring millions!!!!!
Could we get a video where the lightsaber sounds and other effects aren't added? I want to know what it actually sounds like
Youtube here's a diamond playbutton  Hackshimth let me break it
Been here before Pandora’s box
*HOW. ARE. YOU. NOT. VERIFIED.*
You guys are the reason I'm loving engineering. I'm 17 now.will u take me as your intern after my studies at 25?
When gonna post about a power loader
I don't know how people can disklike this video.
You're insane and I love it.
That 10 mill subscriber PlayButton is No Joke !! I also want to wish you and your team the Best on any endeavours you all decide to pursue as you all deserve it and I know only Great things will come of it !! 👊👍✌️
I don't care what people say but you are are tony stark to me even do you say no because I haven't seen such a smart person as you. And one more thing i know you made a iron man repulse and i wanna see f it is possible if humans can build a Iron man suit and I understand if say no or you cant it will take a lot of time. But their is something I want you to know you are the best YouTuber ever in my opinion. And I like your plan to :)
Congrats for the road you have walked, I wish you the best for the road ahead.
What is your quantity on the mini playbuttons
dude u da man
Heat it back together it would look so cool
I love this channel so much and the work you guys put In is amazing, this is what inspired me to want to be an engineer (I’m still a teenager) thank you so much
Omg I want to join the team
60,000 likes to 847 dislikes  Thats when you know people like you
I swear this guy is gonna be on Jupiter in 3 years
These guys are going to change the entire world for the better. I can feel it!
love you vid continue crating
Jacksucksatlife: Spends 3k and his relationship with YouTube for a Diamond Playbutton  Hacksmith: Cuts one in half
Here is the time stamp for the cutting: 12:22 thank me later
Hacksmith I was wondering if you can make the Mandalorian Armor. Love your vids, keep up the amazing work.
The blade is smaller hmm
Yes James well said keep it up can’t wait to see where you guys end up
Now that's a quality beskar steel you have
Are you gonna get a new 10 million button?
People:keep diamond play button Hacksmith:melt diamond play button
YouTube : ........
That is amazing what you and your team does and that makes me so happy
I wanted to cry when he mentioned grants death, I loved his videos and miss him. I’ve been watching him since  2014
When he said he had a master plan, all I could think of was Technoblade yelling, "IT'S ALL PARTA THA MASTA PLAN"
This is why prototyping exists because we are only human. Life is a living experiment and there is more things to learn. You have done a lot of incredible things for this channel. Grant would definitely be proud of what have you done. You are an inspiration to many and I just want to say thank you for making amazing inventions. I’ll be here when you reach another subscriber milestone. Always to remember to live life at your own pace while having fun.
Youtube sees this and flips table in rage
This guy can easyly run a TV program, but in youtube is more accessible for everyone i love your channel, it inspires me to do things. i am not like you that bend metal and cut wires, i'm just a programmer, but it still has very much in common in about motivation on our things!
I completely agree with this message, but ya need a haircut.
*_E P I C_*
The real question is what % of the comments were asking about the next power loader video.
You have a AWESOME team i am very honored to have subbed to you and team  keep up the EPIC hacks  proud of you and the team  you all have taught me many new creating items very very proud of each of you and team
Hey anyone else think he kinda looks like Steve Rogers from infinity war or is it just me
Your channel is older than me that is sad
If you need a Chef for Hacksmith Industries Campus, hit me up 😎   Also, who the hell is downvoting this
I'm so impressed by what you guys have accomplished. There are no words to describe how insane this whole channel is. You've inspired so many people (including me) to make the most of our lives and enjoy each moment. Not to mention you've made some dope af inventions! Thank you for everything you've done for this community! <3
Congrats on 10000000
I know your videos won’t be here forever so I decided to say this now you inspire me to do bigger things in my life and make my imagination grow to unimaginable sizes so you deserve a long life and to prosper thanks for your content that’s all I have to say
The title should be “Selling a diamond button”
I’ve been watching your videos since I was 12. I’ve wanted to be an engineer for years bc of u. Congrats on the 10mil
For all who disliked the vid you guys need help😒 Like if you agree
"Keep doing what you're doing man you're doing great
The diamond play button turned to Damcas
I could totally see the government hiring them to build weapons
I think your doing great!
YouTube: we give this man a 10 mill diamond play button and he cuts it in half.... YouTube: you thinkin what I’m thinkin YouTube: yes...LETS SEND HIM ANOTHER
Hey James, I’m a senior at a high school and I want to be a engineer like you and your crew and maybe work for a industry who has inspired me to be an engineer which is Hacksmith Industry, but I’m am lost cause I don’t know what first step I should take to make that dream a reality, so can you make a video on step of how to become and engineer so it may point us to the first step? I’m sure it will help out thousands of people with this same dream thank you
epic
Is it me or does James look like Jesus?
Everyone thought Elon was gonna be Tony Stark. No... it’s this guy.
Who else is wishing they joined the intern program
We think in a very similar ways. I don’t know if I will ever be at your level, but think our mission in life are insanely similar.
Gg I hope you can go further with your dream and goals
I honestly thaught that James, out if all people would know that metal usually expands when there is heat near it
Think about it there big brain is kinda dangerous 😂
i really like the steam punk look of the lightsaber
No all of your videos are of the best
All I got to say man is your are amazing I love u
You guys are crazy - but the kind of crazy we need. Congrats on the 10M subscribers. That cut/molten button took some pretty colors.  People criticizing your projects or productivity have no sense of reality.
i love your channel but.... bro... you need to shave that beard
The beginning of the video almost made me cry. I miss Grant too and you are a great guy. Don’t ever let anyone talk down to you or make you feel bad about what you are doing. Your job is not easy and you and your team do it so well. God bless you guys and keep changing the world.
I have been with this Chanel since 2014 and holy it Shit it has been one hell of a journey keep doing what your are doing and making things we love and I think you can go to the top man thank you for six years of entertainment
I don't get y elon musk doesn't know hack Smith, I bet if he knew hack Smith he would try and hire him
Hacksmith when I go to college I'm going to come work for you and get a scholarship you're amazing keep doing what you do!
Its ok man, we all love you and appreciate you, and all the work you put in <333
Grant thompsons forehead is shiny I just realised that
Isn't that the first custom play button =P, 4w3s0m3! Light saber RuL3z!
.
16:03 Diamond play button sword shall be a reality!
Everyone like, this was a big sacrifice.
It’s funny that people with a gaming channel have more subs than this guy
Can you please make a cross guard lightsaber
Hacksmith 2050 building a death star
I love your content, I showed it to my dad and mom and my dad did the most face palm thing ever when he said when he watched ur light saber making video, he said propane is flammable and I was like bruh, you think he don’t know that lol,
"Proof that James Hobson had 10 Million subscirbers"
When I grow up I hope I can work with you
Who tf  unliked😑
Can you make the sword pen from Percy Jackson plz
How do i tag a YouTuber in a video?
HOW COULD YOU, THATS LIKE LIGHTSABERFYING YOUR CHILD 😭
❤️
You now started looking like chewbacca
you can hear him holding back tears and it’s really touching
Just why
When do you hire and at what age
It's funny how not many youtubers are able to obtain the Diamond Play Button, but when the Hacksmith gets it, they be like "another thing for us to cut with lightsaber!"
12:22
is it just me or does the playbutton looks better when its burned
Build idea: the mandalorians wrist weapon, with a flamethrower, with maybe even whistling birds?   You could also disguise the fuel source as the jetpack
SO WICH OF U GREEDY TERDS CRITICISED HACKSMITH AND MADE HIM SAD?   WHO     WHO?!!?!
Keep up the good work
I have high hopes for our future. Even though I don't know whether I have the ability to change anything, but I really want to be an innovator like everyone in the community here :)
I don’t know if he wanted to but he sounded like a Star Wars droid
I feel bad that u destroyed your Diamond play button for a YouTube video idk you are feeling Rn
Nice, prince of bel air reference
And with the money of this video you can buy a new one
Aruan tá diferente kkkkkk
This is the most beautiful announcement I have ever heard, I have been watching your videos since the very first video
Hacksmith are you guys going to make a school just for future hacksmith employees?
I want you guys to know just how muc i love and appreciate everything you do. Keep it up Hacksmith Industries. Yall have my full support
5:10 looks like the scene from naruto
4 hours half a million views 🤩
He sounds like a battle droid when he is cutting the play button lol.
Damn I wish he did the fresh prince parody
Ya really inspires me so thats a check as well Thank you for making the Youtube as extension of your knowledge as well as humor Cheer up always Thank you and God bless
You all are amazing people. The things you make creates a huge difference in the world and not only pushes, but redefines the word possible. You guys have and will make a difference. You all are fantastic. EXCELSIOR!!
Does this count as art? It is kinda pretty. Also, I've only watched your guys' adventures for a few years now, but from what I can tell you guys have come a long way. I love the "master plan". It's very wholesome. Keep it up.
i think that you should do a  project simimiler to others like making a warframe from the game warframe that has double jump and laser guns ya know
This video is so wholesome you can really tell how much James cares for his team and the name Hacksmith
Thungsten Carbide playbutton?
In a couple decades I truly believe that hacksmith industry’s will be up there with google or amazon
You sound like a Clone Wars droid with that mask on
Love your vid. Progegt idie make a titan from titan fall
"a dash of lemon"   proceeds to murder the lemon with his bare hands
You know it’s fresh cuz we don’t have 11mil yet...  HES ALREADY 10.8 MILLION!
Hey so I'm fine with the lightsaber effects, but could we hear it without that once?😅
Wow, just wow, you guys are unbelievably  amazing, just everything is amazing
I wonder what material it was made from that it switched colour like that. Anyone with more knowledge about metal alloys?
you are doing all you can to keep us happy your doing good have fun
If every subscriber gave you $5, you would have 58 million dude. We need to be supporting this man. Even just a dollar each is an insane amount when we all contribute
12:20
Yesterday is history; while tomorrow, well it's a mistory; but today its a gift, and thats why it is called the present! Sometimes taking a brake and focusing on yourself in the now is what is most important! But I see your goals & your motivation and I'm just in awe. You and your team are well crazy! Crazy amazing, so keeping on doing you and I hope these good vibes make you feel good about all that you and your team have accomplished 😊 love your videos keep on being you, all of you!
i just want to say that this feels like a sefe space for me and you and your wonderful team have made me relize that i love this and i started taking a engineering class at my high school and maybe one day i can try to get a internship with you guys but who knows great job with everything and hope your master plan goes well
youtube is like   BRUH  it took so much money to give u that button
I want to work with you guys. Things that you do are the things that i want to do
If I wanted to hear this much talking I would just wacth a documentary even one about how chairs are made would be more interesting
Colin Furze is probably happy to see other peoples make science fiction into science
The ending look like TKOR last time ending of a short vid
“YouTube will remember that.”
I love your goals and how you set them. I plan on showing this to my grade 4 class (minus the s**ts and giggles part) because they are all convinced that being a Youtuber is effortless. Thanks for striving to always grow and learn.
If you are disliking the videos why are you here just give the guy respect
I think it would be awesome for anyone to work at hacksmith industries
Congrats keep the good work,  hope you achieve your goal good luck
Loved! This video, and the whole channel. Great job.
Who's here before 500k views
_"Great Scott..!"_ Now THAT is what I call a Master Plan! This is absolutely huge!  I discovered the channel literally a month ago with the lightsaber videos, and I'm only realizing now the extent of what you've accomplished at Hacksmith Industries. By the way, not all Youtubers talk so honestly about their team in "milestone videos", and I think reminding the importance of all the people behind the "icon" is really a good thing to do. May the Force be with you, Mr. Hacksmith, with your team, and with all your inspiring projects!
This is how many people who did not skip to 12:22 👇
Do you think you can make that dream makers space in the us? Please.
Try cutting through an inch thick steel wall just like obIwan and qui-gon did to the blast door
Will you get another dimand play button if you get another 10 mil subs? If you will they that will be cool
Well if you want to stop a light saber for a while you know what you need you need a wall of 100's of millions of people for that many buttons
You can do anything you are someone.
This was nice bro. Also nice beard :D
only karens would dslike dis vid
Best videos ever. NOT a waist of time, but a amazing way to learn about stuff and learn to dream on your own about what you want to do and try to make it accomplished.
Jesus Christ, its Jesus Christ in the flesh🤣
JackSucksAtLife: 😐
i dont think i ever dedicated this much time towards a youtube channel. most people change, yet you somehow remained the same. amazing work you been doing and continued to do the past years, and i know for a fact that hacksmith industries will become something monumental in the future.
Rest in peace Grant the true king of youtube science.
Damn that was deep. Good work
imagine if they used this lightsaber in the phantom menace when trying to get to thedroid commanders. they would have been like. hey no worries. its gonna take a looong time to get here. UR AMAZING HACKSMITH
I love you’re videos you should do something with aerogel
If i knock on ur door on christmas i want that
2006??? I WAS 2 YEARS OLD HOLY
Just wondering are yall getting a new one or no
Just give it to jacksucksatlife
Masterplan= E P I C O👍 Except take breaks when u need them
When jack well see this
What an absolute legend 🌠
You have truly mastered the art of making a milestone video. You have made something and split it into parts that will appeal to every part of your audience.
Go do gravitymotor
I saw the name and I literally screamed nooooooooo
Why is he talking like Belle Delphine while hes cooking the play botton 10:28
All I got to say is keeping going forward and keep pushing hard, don't let the negative energy bring you down, but use it as motivation to do better things in the future. Your doing great hacksmith and I love your content.
U should make a sword
I want to buy but i dont have Money
ur the boss sir
I watched since your hair was short xd.
You should make a delorian car that makes a fire trail
I can imagine in like 10 years from now you might make a lightsaber just like in the movies. Your progress is insane!
who’s here before he takes over the world🖐
This is the coolest thing I've seen a creator do with their play button ever
your the one who inspired me to work for Microsoft
The 825 ppl who disliked the video are psychopaths
You all deserve a break. Not saying I want you to go on one. You guys are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
whyd you have to disrespect youtube like that lol...
I loved the heart to heart part. You will change the world because a lot of people all round the world want to hello you to change the world as you want.
The fire box in the beginning. YEET.
This guy is badass why are ppl hating he LITERALLY MADE A LIGHTSABER AND IRON MAN GAUNLETS
Hey I know I’m late but I appreciate everything you do and you can take as long as you need to make videos. All of your real fans will stick with you no matter how long it takes. We support you fully. I might only be 14 but I’ll do what I can. Love your vids bro
He isn't hacksmith they are hacksmith
.
I need chores to buy stuff        So I guess I’m doin 20 chores I guesss
This is a question and only a question. When are you going to build the next iron man piece to build the iron man suit?
hey Hacksmith please make Netflix original daredevil sticks. You're the best!!!
bro not every youtuber gets 10mil and your just going to destory it bro no like why
heart to heart then a good ol cooking show. Theres no words
You should try taking the idea of the lightsaber and try to make a Halo sword
I'm so happy you kept going. You're an inspiration every day. Keep pushing, you're making a difference.
Basicamente, um Aruan Evoluído
It will deflect the light saber
Hey guys just wanted to say that I love your videos and I hope you continue the work. I love you guys and wish for the best of your future. I will hopfully get the playbutton thing soon.
.
*gets diamond play button* Most youtubers: let’s display this  Hacksmith: let’s cut it in half
Yo the play button at 14:00 looks pretty sick
His voice when he had the mask on makes him sound like a battle droid lol
make a Plasma Playbutton
I can here his voice shaking when he's doing his speech almost made me cry
Easily the best Hacksmith Industries video so far.
i'm a fan for long time but i  would like to see hacksmith industries do a collab with mark rober...it;s must be a an most epic video in my entire life
LMAO Wonder how YouTube feels seeing youtubers destroy play buttons.
Crhome playbutton 500 Million subscribers lol
Next let's replace it with a real gemstone!
[ Note to self ]... and Ig for everyone else who reads this   “Screen record this and come back to it after 50 years from now to reflect how far he’s come, Hey from the pass 👋🏼 “
You should install a bipod on that saber lol
The tip of this "light saber" is like the heads of adults in kids shows.
2030 Hacksmith Industries is a global army weapon inventor
I loved watching this video and like and I’m going to share this video
Why do people dis like the videos
For all of you that are to autistic to watch the full video heres the scene in which they cut it   12:40
The king of random just isn't the same without Grant
Honestly, the speech you just did was soooo inspiring!! It really brings home the Effort and heart you guys put into every single project and how dreams really do come true!  I love this channel, can’t wait to see what you guys have planned for the future!!!
Plz tell me it can be other colors and plz make the black saber
Why do I feel smart when I watch these videos
hey i get what your saying but i wsh your team could attempt to mack a reall free energy genrater althou its not really free energy it would have to be loos energy likr kunetic or protinchal for example but thats the main issu in todays time and i doint have enoph nolige to do it but maybe you can lol just a thout.also missed dpelled words are to to a laggey tablet.
Man u are the best ❤️❤️
Hacksmith...imagine a car windshield but a hologram type sun blocker
This is the first youtuber that I have ever seen to break his diamond playbutton
next  project should be making a plasma forcefield like in Star Wars
Whos the guys who are saying your not good enough i just want to talk to them (loads shotgun)
Hey James, if I start a YouTube channel, and get to 10 million subs, would you heat-color my diamond play button with your light saber for me please?
Ngl I felt bad for the man, he puts countless time into projects to entertain us and then some people give him crap we need to let the man relax and give him some free time
Mini play buttons for the community is such a cool idea.
Hacksmith industries inspired me to be brave and take chances in life and to do what I want with the time I have on earth, so therefore I'll begin training as a fireman in one and a halv years, thank you for everything and I look forward to all your creations and inventions in the future
Hey man, just wanted to say you and your team are pretty amazing! I wish I could do half of this stuff. I'm a beginner engineer myself, just havin fun with circuitry. I hope to be able to make the biggest project ever: The RX-75 Guntank Thunderbolt edition! I know making something of that size and scale is a ways off for me, but, one day, I Wanna see it done. Maybe you guys will get to it before I do!
Gotta turn the play button into a sword or something
Did you just say a Nick Fury quote, his quote about the Avengers?
I feel kinda bad because you only get one playbutton
I doubt my post will affect anything, but previous one was reacted to, so who knows. As you explained in this video, you are victims of your own success, and need to make regular new content. And, quite obviously, stuff like lightsaber and cybertruck can't be pumped out at needed rate. This leads to frankly bottom of the barrel stuff like "silver surfer" and "ghost rider", that seem like you needed to plug a hole in schedule and did not had anything else in time. Not that it's bad - year ago it be quite a good video. But you raised a plank so high, that now it seems weak in comparison. Therefore, a suggestion -  diversify a bit from "make it real".  Remember Mythbusters? Yeah. You have engineering capacity and filming to make videos at least at level of early episodes. I'm sure all of you have stuff that you wanted to test or think was not tested enough. From top of my head - i think proper (if in scale) test of "plane on conveyer" will make decent video at cost of buying model plane.  ****  And while we at it. I'm shocked that after lightsaber there is no (public) plans to make chainsword from scratch. No repurposed chainsaw nonsense. In proper human scale, not oversized miniature one. It will obliviously need external power source,  but other than that - should be awesome.
For Halloween (or whenever) you guys should make the proton pack from ghostbusters. I’m thinking that a Tesla coil would work, but I don’t know how that would work.
There’s no way that’s his only diamond playbutton
I loved when it turned into a burnt titanium button! Congrats on 10 mil!
Woooooooooooooooooooo you got it
I’m my opinion your the first Jedi
Flame saber
I am so sorry for your nagative comment
This made the play button 100x more badass
Will you ever do halo related stuff and your videos are awesome
i love what you do! No matter if it takes 10 years to make a video or 1 day ill be here to watch.
WHY YOU HAVE TO CUT THAT PLAY BUTTOM IN HALF
My question is how did this man not already have 10,000,000 subs
And to prove the power of flex tape I cut this diamond play button in half
Infinity gauntlet with lasers???
Bro I love u but why
Whoever be hating on the hacksmith is a loser
12:30 you're welcome. Rest of the video is worth a watch though
I don’t ever comment on YT videos but this one is worth it. Iv been a subscriber since the exoskeleton project and it’s fascinating to see how far Hacksmith industries has come! I’m not an engineer but I click to watch your videos faster than any others. Your goals and approach towards achieving them is inspiring and I hope to take that forward in my own career. Thank you for all the hours of entertainment and I look forward to seeing the master plan part two over the next decade!
*Cuts 10 mill subs plat in half and a day later loses 5 mill subs*
if you guys do end up creating a world with superheroes then I volunteer as being the very first test subjects
🤧😔 so emotional so happy for this guy
Brings a happy tear to my eye I am a true subscriber even if I can't spend money on youtube I created an email just for subscribing to him and to. Prove I'm a true subscriber I listen to the Future and History matter a fact if I was old enough and smart enough I would want to apply for the Hacksmith Industries :D
Congrats on 10mil I have been a fan for a while now but I appreciate the grind keep it going
You helped me decide I wanted to go into electrical engineering
he didn't tell us what he does spend his time doing
You the best
Keep it up bro, ur doing good stuff. Im currently studying to be a mechanical engineer and its honestly partly because of watching ur videos!
Next project make the fastest car
Mehn, his voice breaking brought tears to my eyes, also if you skipped to him cutting the button make a U turn and see the whole video it's worth your time
You are really stupid to cut your own diamond play button
A fresher Bel air
You and your great team has inspired me to keep pushing forward in what i do. I hope yall become more and more known to the world.
a team is the supports to a great place, one that creates many things and throws itself into the unknown, screw the haters, you did an amazing thing and are still doing said amazing things
14:25 why does the half melted play button look better than the normal one
For those worrying about the play button, They can just buy a new one.
Don’t let him down and say he could have done something else he is who he is and a really good person and a really good content creator. Like for everyone to see this and let’s stand strong with this YouTuber 🥳
your goals are very admirable and are similar to the sort of goals ive wanted for years which is to inspire people and also allow them to do or create things they might not be able to normally because of education, environment, or financial reasons. i have always felt people shouldnt be limited to what they can learn and experience just because of their lack of education or money, or because they live in a place that is not as advanced or open to advancement as others are. good luck on continuing your goals and may hacksmith industries truly make great change (and create cool things).  also if an idea is ever needed for a creation it could be interesting to Shadow the hedgehogs hover skate shoes be created, im sure there are ways to do it but im unsure how
U guys are awesome, keep up the good work
dude you made a fricking real life lightsaber. that alone is a gigantic acomplishment... lol gg on the 10 mil subs you guys seriously deserve it :P
Damn im 3 hours late
“A dash of lemon” 11:17
I forgot, dude is like 5'5 💀 love you though.
Me
now its 1080 million subs
Time stamp 1249
Yeah just the usual day for the hacksmith industries, cutting a DIAMOND play button in half with a lightsaber. Cause everyone gets a diamond play button.
Who talks bad about them! Can YOU  guys DO it better?? Unless its something gramatic or shit or you can do it better than this guys...
You are AWESOME! The hacksmith industries deserves it all
I love everything you do on your channel if you are in them or not, I know you put a lot of time n effort into all of it for you, your team and us. (Can't forget Grant either, Rest In Peace) please don't let the negative comments hinder you, as long as you n everyone else who have been here from the beginning knows how much blood sweat n tears you have n still put into the projects to entertain us. Just remember you and the Hacksmith Industries crew are loved and please keep the great videos coming!
i wish to see you using saber to burn hacksmith too :D
i love you man keep doin what your doin
James is the coolest dude on the planet
Hacksmith: We're Going to cut it in half Regular youtuber: NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not gonna lie he’s kinda turning into chewbaka
You da best. Neva forget.
Is it only me but does he sound like a battle droid with that mask 👁👄👁
Youtube:I've created a monster
10:07 I feel attacked...

Gordon Ramsey is sweating profoundly.
I love your videos you inspire spired me so much your  the best YouTube or ever
I gave this video a thumbs down for 2 reasons.  #1 he dropped the glass part of the play button #2 they did not give us any decent views of the melted play button #3 he called the proto sabre a light sabre
Oof that was sad 😢❤️🇬🇧
i just imagine youtube watching and they are speechless
The style of your videos, reminds the anime "Dr. Stone", I don't know why, lol!Your channel is awesome keep doing this incredible job man.  I'm from Brazil
POWWWWWAAAAA
I looked at the title and thought pain....
This is awesome! It's great that you're expanding your channel into a much larger business.
Have a good day
you meet the aruan
People are getting mad cause u happy LAME YALL MAD PPL NEED TO GROW UP
Love this!!
Hacksmith: cuts diamond 0lay button in half  YouTube: wait, this isn't how your supposed to play the game
2:50 OOF
I love your vides
I wanted to make a serious comment and congratulate you for the 10mil; however all I can say is haha lightsaber go burrrrrrrrrrrr
Bro imagine hating on one of these videos
Yo hacksmith I just want to say you inspired me to do robotics and pursue engineering. Thank you so much.
12:22 i when they actually cut it.  *your welcome*
At 10 million subscribers on YouTube, you are living the new American Dream
What the hell is that thing made out of?!
This is so cool, you are amazing man!
My first vid that i watched was 3 yrs ago, kingsman umbrella gun, pretty cool
Amazing stuff, guys. I love to hear big plans from capable people.
I'd take the spicy play button over the normal one any day
The world will look back one day and identify this man as the one who started everything. For good or for bad the Hacksmith just has this atamosphere about him, that makes you think "This man will do something great, something amazing. I don't know what it is yet, but I want to be there following him when it happens".
here before 1 million
I’ve been subscribed since you were messing around in your garage with hydraulics
Hi
In a few years:  - Hey mom! I got accepted to the Hacksmith University!
Let’s hope he can make his business bigger I love your vids keep up the good work
Ayyyyy here before 1 million
I wander what youtube is going to make the 200 million sub play button out of.
I have been watching your videos for a long time, not since the beginning, but I still think I have been a long time fan, I hope your plans go swimmingly     Edit: and you bet your ass I am buying one of those little buttons
i make a tiny boat out of coffee sticks lol
It's kind of ironic, he is using a light saber, yet he sounds like a Roger Roger droid.
This is like the 1000 degree knife thing, but way more dangerous
By by
I have been watching your channel for almost 4 years now! I started when I found your flying like iron man series. I’m now in my second year of school for Aerospace engineering. I love what you do it always inspires me to design ideas I have even if they are not pratical. I don’t have the tools to build that much but I slowly working my way to a small starter garage shop. I would love to come do what you guys do or even start my own thing maybe. Keep doing what you want to do James, you will always have my support in the direction you want take Hacksmith industry.       ~Ian
You see this man people THIS is a man who can lead! Not interested in the power that fame and wealth secure, but a creator of dreams into the real world.  Three of this kind of human could push us to the stars and beyond. One who has known loss, has empathy and is willing to sacrifice for others. I hope sir one day to see your name upon an election ballot I truly do for if you remain who you are today you WILL not just be a note in history you will write it with your hands.  Good luck sir push the boundaries until they burst.
So there’s a silver play button a gold play button and now a chrome button???
Everybody gansta till da hacksmiths tern there dimond play button to gold
make a f1 wagen 1/2
It wasnt really cut.. you just sorta burned it.
You guys are the reason why people believe that humanity can become something more, love your work 👍
This kinda made me tear up.  Not the cutting the diamond play button.
Y he sound like a droid from star wars when he's cutting the button😂but on all seriousness I barely become a fan like a month ago but I'm sure everyone really appreciates what u do thank u for being u and inspiring multiple people hope to see more amazing projects like this congratulations on hitting 10 million subs
Hi, Hacksmith, I imagine you've already received every compliment possible, as long as it comes to your plans, your skills and your personality, but I couldn't find a single comment stating that you're hot, so if you ever come across my comment in this sea of "you're amazing" "you're inspiring" "good luck" and "you have my support", I want you to know that your beard looks stunning ^^
Bro you really touched my heart with that speech
Love your vids!
Brings a tear to my eye
Damn this made me cry as an og fan
Oh gosh this is honestly so nice i hope everything goes well for you, stay amazing!
im sorry about my comment on the ghost ridder video i didnt mean to criticize what you guys made really epic as well and it always amazes me what cool stuff you guys make.. tbh you were my inspiration for engineering i even applied to some universities in Canada so i could work with you as an intern ..unfortunately i didnt get accepted xD anyways imma a big time supporter of you guys and i wanted to apologize
My bro loves your channel and i recently subscribed. And i always found it amazing how you uploaded every week especially with the things you make, i wouldnt get mad or annoyed if you took longer to make them, after all i believe quality is better than quantity. All in all you're doing great and i cant wait to see what things you come up with next. 👍
So how long until I can buy a lightsaber lol
Next project for you: make star platinum lol        Ok if you actually do youre gonna be my religion
🙌🙌🙌
James is crazy but thats good
12:22
14:23 i love the colors change
Tons of people build stuff by them Selves it’s what u do that separates u
You should make a laser eyes
He does realize playbuttons are irreplaceable
YouTube: Here’s the coveted diamond play button you can keep as a trophy for many years! The Hacksmith: Yeah, it’s gotta go
So heartwarming
To the ones who disliked this video Why are you gay
James:I’ve put together a team of exstrodinary people to help he make these videos. Me:sooo it’s the hacksmith initiative???
Lol the cooking show tho...
I personally think you do have very good plan and pushing technology is normally always a good thing. There is always bound to be people complaining, but for each one complaining you have x amount of happy people, dont forget that :) I wish you best of luck for your projects and the future. Maybe you could build the first real affordable and most ambitious electric vehicle? This would really help i guess ^^ (Maybe even take inspiration from fan favorite cars, like the delorean from back to the future? :D ) I myself are quite far away from this problematic, as i only have 4 subscribers XD
I had watched the videos here for a while but didn't realize until recently hacksmith was also from Kitchener.
I love your vids and i think there great.
Because I only have like four or five subscribers
“Because were not at 11 mil yet” 200,000 potential subs: we’ll see about that...
This man went to a motivational speech to cooking a diamond play button then cutting it
It's just like they teach us in engineering school. You can't do a project alone because you're not an expert at everything, only your own field. Continue with the excellent work!
It looked better when it turned blue lol
The next project is to make the air filter mask into a Darth Vader helmet???
You are the real life Tony stark in time you'll be ase good as his farther
Sigo pensando que este señor seria el indicado para hacer una nueva version de wolverine o de thor...
blue gem play button
Make a real hologram yu-gi-oh dueling disk 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Make Genji overwatch flaming sword for next build
Lol I legit just clicked onto youtube to look for a older hacksmith video and i find a new one 🤣🤣
I still remember the firetruck incident like it was yesterday
Thank you hacksmith you inspired me to do my best and made me get a engineering degree. I can't thank you enough, thanks hacksmith :)
the fact that he destroyed his diamond play button for a video is just-
Meka a video:getting girls whith my projects
How much for the iron man repulsors?
Just a little bit of lemon *proceeds to turn the lemon into a raisin*
Amazing! I'm hopping that I can get your merch from Mexico! I love your work, you have really inspired me. Regards from Mexico!
What an inspiring and inspirational speech I love the video and think your plan is amazing I hope one day when I’m older I can share a part in something like hacksmith, your awesome
He really is the real iron man
Has anyone else noticed the name change?
How do you join Hacksmith Industries?
I appreciate your guy’s effort and time. Thanks for the Great content
This is gonna be the guys that creates time travel
*Susan will remember that*
Hey man, I've been watching for a couple years now, and I just wanna say, I have no doubt that you have created one of the greatest things the world has ever seen, keep doing the great things you do!
Sorry if I spell it rong
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO THIS SPECIFIC OBJECT?!?!??!!???!!?
1:13 Is that a Fresh Prince of Rap Reference??     Good video, I love it
Hello there
Can you make a unepeam
Well done man, I’ve been watching for a few years now and really enjoy every video you put out so keep doing you and whatever makes you happy and exited do that and just know that the people trying to shut you down are a very small amount and are either taking a problem they have out on you or just simply want a reaction so just keep doing you and I with many many others will support you is what I guess I’m tryna say!!
No one: Absolutely no one: Not a single soul:  *I SAWED THIS PLAY BUTTON IN HALF*
Can you make a bullet proof mandolorian armor?
I'm more excited about your future plans, and expansion of your business, than I am about seeing lightsabres cut things in half, and that's saying a lot!   Great Work!
Absolutely spot on video.
Hacksmith lowkey could becomes this generation’s tony stark
"Idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people" HACKSMITH INDUSTRIES IS THE WORLDS AVENGERS CONFIRMED!
:0
Good job on all the content I hope you can take a break to relax soon
4:47 I feel something in his voice. It's making me sad 😥😥     PS I'm subbing
I love u man, ur a champ. Doing an amazing job and setting an example on multiple levels. Big respect!
Love you bro from India 💗💗💗💗
This reminds me of the 2 phase of marvel studios for movies
I started uploading 3 months ago and I’ve got 31 subscribers I’m actually pretty proud that’s 50% of my viewers :)
That’s a record if you got your diamond play button THAT quick
Life isn’t short, it’s the longest thing we experience
Hacksmith im 12 and you have inspired me to be an engineer or a youtuber
When Hacksmith squeezes lemon without crying and a bunch of juice comes out  HaCKsMiTh STRONG
When I'm older I want to join your team
Glad I clicked on this video! I am super excited to see what you guys do!
I wasn't expecting the mention of Grant Thompson...got a little emotional there for a little bit. I love your videos Congrats on 10 Mil.
12:22
is this a diamond or beskar play button?
I’m so proud of you man, its been 3 years  since I watched you, and wow, you changed and got better, keep up the great work.
This man, this man is the best cook I’ve ever seen
Playbutton without diamond: I'm superior i will survive the lightsaber Diamond:well we will see who survives 5 minutes later Diamond:HAH WHO'S THE SUPERIOR NOW
Diamond Play Button - Case Hardened FN
You can’t please everyone. If you feel like you made a good video, understand the criticism, but don’t let it diminish your work
So will Hacksmith Industries be a workers co-operative?  Because not stealing the surplus value of labor from employees is a great start to making the world a better place.
IV been watching u for ever love ur content
Egg
Pov: you are going thru the comments to find the assholes who discourages him.
Rather touching fact, if you look up the diamond play button on the Youtube Wikitubia page, they list every creator who has ever gotten one, and the entry just after the Hacksmith is the one from the King of Random .... that's kinda beautiful I think
james is so wholesome i sware. this makes me happy keep up the good work dude its amazing.
This video is beautiful.
O Aruan vai ficar com inveja kkkkk
Wow its the first time i see him speak genuine
You have inspired me to be something, something else other then myself I respect you and your channel thank you James.
You can use that melted stuff to make the first real clanker droids. *Roger Roger*
Now we know diamond play buttons are better at defending against lightsabers than actual steel
Like the new name
You should try to make Boba Fett’s rangefinder from the Mandalorian Season 2 episode 1
And the channel grew and grew and grew                              His hair
I still remember the first video i saw: the batman grapnel gun. So glad to see that you guys have grown while keeping those great morals at heart. This is just the beginning im sure of it
What a legend getting diamond play button and instantly destroys it
Bro thank you always for entertaining us in here the Philippines, been here since the old HQ God bless the team
It’s so pure 🥺  O loooooook he cuuut dat ply buton gooood *edit* (I hope you reach you’re goal I’m really happy for you)
I came here for an exoskeleton something like 5 years ago thinking "wow that's really cool" and now I'm here watching a 10 million subscribers button being cut in half. Since the beginning that was a great journey but I can tell that it's just the beginning of something even more amazing and I'm very proud of being part of this community. You are making a great job and I can't believe that those years flew so fast and I hope that there will be many more. So thanks for the amazing content and may the force be with you!
Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Hey I do no reading this but I  hope you try to make a hoverbaord
This is a actually pretty insane 😂
it is sad the table is melting before the play button is what ever company used that metal should be sad that a youtuber play button was stronger than a work table that is METAL
is it ok if i use a lime instead of a lemon?? if yes how much?
I can't wait for you to help push the future of technology. (and build a legit iron man suit (or hacksmith suit))
My question is can James actually cook?
Can you plz make a time Machine so I can back in time where Covid didn’t exist.
Wow i worked so hard to get 10 mil subs and now i have a shinny playbutton  Lets CUT IT IN HALF
i love you
Are those lightsaber sfx or is that the actual sound
when you run out of ideas
YouTube: hears a very valuable Dimond play button  The hacksmiths: burn it
Okay ive been  fan for so long and its great seeing how this channel actually stayed true to their original self i hope that maybe one day hacksmith industries will be all around the globe and teaching people stuff giving people the internships and a chance to create whatever with the newest tech    I wisb you all the best!!!!!
Don’t let that get that 1 percent get to you, keep it up!
Skinniest forearms!
I still remember seeing you with omar isuf you had like 7k subs haha honored to be able to see your journey first hand
I personal love watch the team interaction and the different expertise of each working together and making something the was previously thought impossible. The working prototypes you guys make are not feasibly possible. Humans are social creatures we can only do so much by ourselves Albert Einstein theories would have not been proven if not for the help of his wife who was a very good mathematician.  There is a saying "Roman was not build in a day" what it should also say is that Roman was not build by one person in one generation. Things take time and cultivation. It's hard to deal with people saying anything mean or over criticizing. You are interaction with 10 million people when human can only properly deal with there imidate 150. So focus on that 150 because those are the people with the most impacted on you and there is nothing wrong with taking a break or doing something small and silly because if it makes you happy that at the end of the day is all that matters.
JSAL watching this like 👁👄👁
I miss Grant
Why?
Youtube watching this 👁💧👄💧👁
Just some engineer from Kitchener, good job and thanks for the content.
14:19 the diamond play button looks SO COOL
Looks like high grade aluminium.
that really got heart
l am 100% sure that you are gona be fist real life ironman in like 2 years becouse you are first real life jeday
Poger is our word. You can say pogga.
Bruh they took the diamond play button and put it through the colour spectrum.
I love this channel.
You guys r here for 12:26  Your welcome
Your getting paid what do you mean your give us free content like if you didn’t get paid.
I really like this steampunk light saber (even though it ain't light but fire)
JackSucksAtLife viewers: YOU WHAT?!?!
4:36 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
why just why
Im not crying you are (Visible crying)
This video has made me so grateful for a creator like you. I almost cried watching lol. I hope you make it to the very top. If that campus gets built I will for sure stop by.
Can I be a part of your team
make this a netflix original
I was watching your vids since I was a Stem Student and It inspired me to be A Mechanical engineering student Right even with the hardship and struggles you still always make me smile through your vids and ideas thank you...
I would help. But I don't live in Canada.
Damn I cried when you brought up grant. I learned so much from his videos when I was younger and I learned a lot about what I like as a person. I love your videos and everything you do I’ve learned a lot and laughed a ton. I still just stare in aww and am just amazed by the things you and your team do. Thank you for being you and building hacksmith to what it is.
A play button with those colors (blue and orange in the center) would be cool ngl
The fresh prince of bel-air cover is better than the actual song xd
First and only video that I’ve ever given a like! Thanks James for what you do! Been with you since the electromagnetic shield.
I don’t know about y’all but if I ever got a diamond play button I would treat it with so much care
Youtube: Heres your diamond playbutton. Youtube: Its all yours James: So I can do anything with it? Youtube: Yea of course. Youtube: Why'd you ask though James: Nothing. :) A few weeks later. James: *posts a video of destroying the playbutton. Youtube: -| _ -|
it kinda looks like a lightsaber from startwars
why do i want a cooking with hacksmith to be a real thing
I have a idea for the spare parts of the play button, what if you made a shield that resembles the *Mobile Suit Gundam* ? The first one because is well known Congrats on the *subs*
Meet Elon  pls
"A group of remarkable people" Sure sounds like Tony to me. 👑
It starts now. From 5 to ten years later he will be famous for making great inventions. Now I finally realize this.
This man is like the howard stark, just wait for his son to fly around in an iron man suit
Im so glad i stumbled onto this channel a few years ago keep up the great work guys
fr tho, your projects are the most amazing things i have ever seen. how does someone say what you do isn’t good enough
great work for all those years, you have my support from france. and don't be too sad about complains it's human nature to think that the way we think is better you do your best, you work hard, and you bring us inspiration, happyness and joy, believing that our dreams and fantasy can become real  thank you very much for what you and your team did, i'm where i am thanks to you. keep it up i wait for you crazy projects
12:22 when it starts ...
This is a historical build for us nerds, first plasma based lightsaber. One step closer
you guys should turn the play button into Mandalorian armor for you know where that would be soooooo good
I would love to see a hacksmith industry’s here in Sydney.
Love you dude soooo coooooool
🙂
He HAS made a difference in the world and in our lives!
that was the best speech ever I heard, you are the best person ever good luck.
"And a dash of lemon"  *Proceeds to utterly destroy the lemon*
14:16 Tham thats look great. If ever have one of those i will certanly burn it whit a ligthsaber. It looks so good
Keep up the good work hacksmith
Hi
10mil ? wtf I just remember the time when I sub you and you were like 700k ...  it wasn't a long time ago! GJ I love your content
Look time is valuable and I know you guys work so hard and I'm sure everyone who watches you is thankfull for the hard work you guys put in and can't thank you guys enough especially through lock down. I live in England and and am currently doing my level 3 carpentry course and watching your guys videos make me rethink my projects and how to make the process more efficient. Watching you guys has helped me with my dislexia ever since e I was young I've had issues with overthinking and my reading skills and seeing your guys amazing work has helped me simplify things. And I thank you guys so much for this entertainment and wish you guys the best of luck and hopefully to continue your amazing projects
The video is dope
Everyone who works on this channel is amazing and I love your videos and think what you've done is incredible
aruan sentiu essa
You really just spent 12 minutes not doing what we came for and 4 minutes doing what we came here for.
congrats on the 10 million guys you deserve it keep up the amazing work and content
Hacksmith you should turn your melted pieces of play button into a new lightsaber hilt
Just know that grant is proud of you james. Love you man
Yes! A true entrepreneur! (Nice job on ten million btw) also you actually did things I thought would happen in about 1,000 years
Yo this is the cheapest way to make a 10.plaque
Jack wouldnt be happy
But can it cut a Nokia 3310
You don't have to feel bad about what People say, i'm an engineering student, and i think you do one of the most funny and enriching videos for the engineering community and for anyone. You make a great job by showing that science and Hard Work can make everything possible, my respects for you and your Work, i am a great fan
Cool Restoration channel will soon get a diamond play button 🛠🛠🛠 . . . . . *Maybe in 1m years
you’re a really good person and I appreciate you
All you gotta do Hacksmith is "Make it real"
Honestly, this guy will one day be making weapons for his country i mean imagine someone attacks you and you are like WABUSSH
Fantastic video, it's really great what you are doing 💪🏼
Video idea, lightsaber vs tungsten.
You should melt down the play button into a sword, or shield, or anything and use the actual diamond as a centerpiece.
It the HACK SMITH PLAY BUTTON
Making a lightsaber CAN'T be legal
Stop adding in light saber sounds
Probably the coolest channel yet
You guys are amazing and i really hope you achieve your goals. Keep it up, and God bless! btw great cooking!
You need waaay more subscribers for the best quality content
Damascus play button
YouTube: you have made it so far in YouTube, and for that, you have earned the diamond play button, very free people have reached this milestone, so make sure to handle it with c-  Hacksmith: ImMa CuT tHiS wItH a ReAl LiFe LiGhTsAbEr
Yep they're gonna make mandalorian armour using the playbutton
What if YouTube does not give you another one if you break it you are so dumb
I saw in an older video that you were apart of FRC and I was wondering what team number you were on.  And by the way thank you for the motivational video. 😀
i will continue to watch this for the rest of my life. im exited for the future
I got an idea to make a hacksmith chest piece and put the diamond from the play button in the chest and then brand it with your logo
when gordon ramsay becomes a engineer
me seeying this also my brain: you been a choosen one
Thank you
Masterchef got nothing on this cooking show🌯🌯🌯
Man, I remember when you were in a tiny garage. Now you are in a big warehouse with an even bigger one coming. I remember when you made your Captain America shields and the rocket hammer. Now you have full-on lightsabers and mechs. Keep up the good work man and just know that you are doing the right thing for the world and I hope you become one of the biggest YouTubers. And thank you for the great videos and projects over the years.
You guys surely deserved it. I love watching your content, and maybe if I was actually smart, I would get interested in engineering as well. I wish you everything good from now on!
New play button has sequels darth Vader helmet vibe goin’
This is amazing I've been here for a long time and I am happy to say that the world is better with the hacksmith scratch that hacksmith industries😄😄😄
every single video of yours ive enjoyed from start to finish. and i get really excited at the thought of havong some kind of hacksmith-industry in my neighbourhood! greetings from germany!
As an aspiring member of the scientific community (I'm majoring physics in college) and a fan of your work besides, congratulations, thank you for all the awesome videos and I wish you all the best of luck in your future plans!
CONGRATULATIONS!!!🥳🎉🎉🇨🇦
This channel has such good content :)
Didn’t even realize the channel name had changed until he said it. It’s a good change.
Congrats for being the first YOUTUBERS to cut a diamond play button
Your diamond play button looks so cool!
I hope your planes come true !
congrats!!! :)
Other YouTubers: I’d better wear gloves so I don’t get any fingerprints on my play button  Hacksmith: Ima melt it
Honestly in my opinion u r better than Mr. Beast
Respect ++ man cause I know it was hard saying he ye but ,keep growing ,keep making and if you need a break, you make 1 every single so often so don't be afraid to   We love you all at hacksmith industries keep it up♥️♥️
Teamwork makes the dream work
How cool would it be to have commercially available lightsabers
14:09    case hardened blue jem button
He is the person I want to be when I grow up. Not just because he is inspirational, but because he makes so many super cool designs that I have been wanting to make myself. I hope that I could be like him someday.
Grant Thompson will all ways  be the king of randomness. A mighty bloke gone to soon
Blah blah blah all i heard is that you want to make more money, i get it.
Just keep working and you'll succeed
This must be the only channel breaking the prize of 10 million subscribers...... So cool!!!!! XD
Men... I'm always fan of this guy since he was started
Could you make a blaster Plasma ?
Yall notice he did the salt bae 10:55
Is it a real diamond? Jesus took awhile didn’t it.
From 10k to 10 mil now it will be 100 mil
Been following you guys for a while but I don't usually post comments. I really enjoy your guys accomplishments and look forward to what you guys complete in the future. I am very intrigued with your masterplan and look forward to seeing how you guys implement it.
Just wanted to say that it is amazing what you and your team have been able to achive in the recent years. Just keep doing what you have been doing and enjoy the process.   PS: Loved Grant appearance, he was such a great person and youtuber. He is and will continue to be missed
Dear hacksmith hater  If you dont know yet he have a real lightsaber so be careful   Sincerely, Hacksmith fan
Hey, YouTube....uh can we get another play button? We lost ours to "unforeseen circumstances"
Congrats for your 10M subs !
All y'all who say that he should do more y'all can GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!!!
Click this you won't regret it 1:15
Are you related to Andy Samberg?
you guys are the best thing in my life I always have a smile when I see the video and  I'm glad that I found you guys even if you don't see this I don't care I just wonted to say this.

What a way to "ruin" a diamond play button
This man deserves a Nobel Prize, ngl.
Jac if ur watching this, I pity for u lol
Man your videos are amazing u inspired me to go into mechanical engineering
i would just use the lightsaber to get that cool cobalt blue color
Thanks for being awesome I want to be a part of hacksmith when I’m older
Hack smith gets 10 mil subscribers let’s cook it a cut it oh and I love your master plan and I’ve been a plan for a long time
I love what you are doing
I wish i could work with you... Its kind of my dream
You guys didn’t come for the lightsaber vs play button you came for the cooking show ofc
Keep on going
Imagine how much better Star Wars would have been if it took Darth Vader 4 minutes to cut through Obi-Wan.  They missed out on some real drama!
15:35 I think there was a easyer way to remove the glass, sorry i forgot to tell you earlyer.          (just a joke)
I almost cried when he talked about grant thompson
Do what you want, we love you James
Jacksucksatlife is sad
Like this video RIGHT NOW!
Build  mandalorian  armor!
I didn’t actually think he would destroy it!😦
The cooking show was funny. :)
Youtube when they see this: ight lets make them a new one
Oh shoot i didnt know i was this early
Nice you can hear the emotion in his voice when reading out the list
Hey hacksmith! Keep going and keep up the great work! You are my most fav YouTuber!
Just do what you want we always support you
I really hope to someday work on one of your amazing proyects
Back a few years ago, when i found this channel, i wondered how it could only have a few 100k subscribers with this great content. Now we are here, at almost 11 million. Thats a number that fits this channel way better. Congratulations!
Woooooow!!! Amaziiiiiinnnggg
He sounds so funny 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Only started watching recent love the content

Fan from all the world will always support you
He sounds like a drone from Star Wars 13:53
Hey, uhh a message to anyone who actually complains about this man and his and his teams projects, and people who give him these gold like standards to live up to, I will slap the ever living crap outta you.
Don't worry he can get a replacement
Juat what i was waiting for
Things are about to get real The Hacksmith Master plan 2 starts now. And I think we're ready to do that, I'm really excited.
I swear this business will go on to make one of the greatest schools and or baking school.  Edit: I now just realized one of the greatest bakery class got canceled
Since my mom won't let me buy merches online, can you guys just sell the screaming gun to cambodia
That lemon squeeze was too big of a flex ngl
No The 💎
Try to cook food with the lightsaber
Who ever disliked this video ur a scrub
At first I was like "why would he cut such a award in half?" But then i realise, compared to inventing the lightsaber, a youtube button isnt much of an acheivement 🤔
I was born on a highway and people say that's action what should I do
The guy who made it be like: bruh
😢😭
I like how this is the first thing they think of when they get a diamond play button.
Well put sir, the passion and drive you and your team put into everything is definitely noticed by those of us that have been following you for years.  I can tell just by your voice in the first several minutes how much you really have invested, and I'm not talking about money, and how much you really care about everything you do.  Keep creating, keep breaking the barriers of impossibility, and don't let the haters bring you down.  Hope this helps encourage you to keep on keeping on.  Thanks for what all of you do!
Hey Hacksmith, as a Canadian that lives in Ontario I am extremely proud of the work you guys do and love all your videos! You guys are a world leader in creativity which couldn't possibly be a better asset! As a former heavy equipment mechanic and a current steel worker in Sault Ste Marie I would love to work with you guys one day if only to see just for a day how you guys work! Keep up the good work and honesty, you're one of a kind!
Man I left for 3 months and this happens
Amazing
Well done,man. I'm a fairly new subscriber and I've been enjoying your content. Keep it up.
When I subbed waaayy back at the first exo skeleton build I did not expect this channel to come this far. Can't wait to see where yall go next!
You are one of the reasons that my dream job is to be a aerospace engineer thanks
The play button looks cool when he is burning it
@JackSucksAtLife
Don't listen to the morons who can't understand the concept of money time and resources
The work you and your team have done over the past several years has inspired me in part to pursue a career in Engineering. Keep up the good work, keep making a difference!
I'm 12 years old and I've always been into science in this type of stuff I've been a subscriber for a long time keep making these amazing videos
All ur inventions are amazing and I cant wait to see the end of the power loader and tbh its good to see how everyone else on your team does things differently. Keep doing what you do and you will be able to become the #1 tech channel in the world
YouTube:diamond play button  Me seeing hackmpsmith video:no it’s not it’s all types of colors
I like how it took 14 minutes to get to the actual video.
I like it better now than it did before it was cut in half with a light saber
It would be cool to see the hacksmith as a big company in the future, helping the world.
Woh man chill chill
💝
I don't know if Youtube is gonna send you another one XD
Jacksucksatlife come see this
So using your definition of an old diamond play button it's very possible that it will be old in the next 2-4 days being your already at 10.8 million subs I believe in 1 day.
Dudes using the wrong ingredients wtf.
You put a lot of work in your channel and company and not enough time in your self take a break don't wear yourself out
The question is. Did youtube prepare before sending this to you haha.
This was the best 10 million subscribers response ever
Just invasion a 84 your old hacksmith holding a chainsaw vroom vroom
I almost cried after your video I am a fan of your for almost 3 years I remember when you use to make caps shield and spider man thing and Batman's grappler and batarg sorry for the spelling mistake  Love from Pakistan
Dude, I genuinely hope they continue to grow. They’re gonna be bigger than what they are already
Now his play buttons are like the Fortnite upper-level skin variants: Silver, Gold, and Holo. It looks better than diamond, imo.
I can’t imagine what would happen if Hack Smith industries teamed up with Mark Rober
Can I buy some stocks?
Video starts at 12:40  Sorry I was put on community service
I could really feel the emotions when going through the "how we got here and where we're going" section. I'm so glad I'm along for this ride, everyone at Hacksmith Industries is amazing
I think all these videos are fun to watch for entertainment, and for inspiration, if you didnt do youtube, I dont think I would either!
He sounded like a droid in the maska XD nice one man
Am I the only one hearing his voice shaking a bit? Somehow, him feeling hurt, hurts you as much
Awesome video! Always fun to see the lightsaber being used. I watched the first half of the video too. Thanks for all the hard work you put in to make dreams into reality. I love seeing these ideas come to life. I'm not interested in the science/physics aspect of it enough to make this sort of thing a career goal. But watching your videos has inspired me to use the limited knowledge I have, to try and attempt my own projects instead of just letting them sit in my mind cause I don't have the education and skills to make something amazing. So thank you for that. Hopefully my first build will be finished soon and I can start doing this stuff as a hobby. I'm excited to see where your channel goes from here. You and the team are awesome! Keep it up!
I've been watching hacksmith since the first captain america shield that the hacksmith made
They ain’t gonna be in YouTube rewind
so happy been subed since 2017
You have truly been an inspiration for many aspiring engineers, myself included. I just want to thank you, and your excellent team, for all that you have done. You have earned every single one of those 10 million subscribers through your creativity, hard work, and fantastic personality.   To The Hacksmith, Hacksmith Industries, Hacksmith Industries Research Campus, and all future Hacksmith endeavors, good luck, God bless, may every dream you achieve drive you to dream further.
You guys are awesome. I love this channel and good luck getting to 11 million and beyond.
Congratulations team!!
If you make a building in near Michigan I’ll work there
I bet you a dollar that YouTube will demonetize this video
Yo the man keep it up
I just want to touch his beard. Lol. I enjoyed watching you make it real for some time now
I love the new name.  It is inspiring and will remind me of your beginning
I'd like this video multiple times if I could. It's been great see the team grow with time.
With the way he sounds with the mask on it sounds like he should say roger roger
Your like Elon musk but without those millions on top👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼💯💯💯💯👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼💯💯💯
you should take a vacation
Grant Thompson, 😭😭
Me seeing the tiny diamond play button: *investing intensifies
I love you guys so much, you bring dreams to life for those of us who could only ever dream. Thank you!
When me and my friends play with sticks imagining that they are lightsabre but someone already made a real one o_o
Real plasma saber don’t slice me in half oh well must have been a ghost then
Or the Thorn from Destiny 1 or 2
I just remember watching the captain America shield video so many times
Keep it up, you make the impossible, possible and we always love watching you make your projects
Bro I will watch your videos until you stop you make quality content
"that's only the entire population of Sweden"  Oohh that's a flex
*Diamond Play Button* When you need to keep the Jedi outside

Why did you change the name
glad i’m here now for what will be one of the biggest company’s in the future
Can u make fulldive system from sao
Technically this is a protosaber as it requires a power pack connected externally
You guys should make the Baby Yoda Cradle on a drone that will follow you.
I enjoyed the story. Ignore the negative comment. Glad you got 10 mil! You made a difference. There are many people you have inspired including me.
Dear hacksmith, I have a idea can you make a *TOASTER CANNON*
Yourtud be like bru
Jedi's worst enemy: a 10 million youtube play button
Man..... Mentioning Grant Thompson like that hit me in the gut, I mis him
Not going to lie u make me happy with the stuff u make
Anyone need a prayer?
"Sometimes we make things for sh*ts and giggles" ~ the Hacksmith   Love your projects, congrats on this crazy achievement!
Youtube:  ...          .______.        ...
great vid
Your videos inspire me about the future
Hey Hacksmith. You are doing so cool stuff and still your mind messes with you. I would really like you to look up Mr Ekhart Tolle in order to clear your mind. It's very energy consuming to pay attention to haters I think. And it's unnecessary.  Regardless of your doing it or not. I appreciate all of what you have done so far.
I've been watching you from the beginning.  love the content keep it going. ❤❤
I love this channel, and to be honest it doesn't matter the way you do it, or how long it takes, because the important thing is that you did it,  you are protagonists, and I'll ways stick to your side and be sure that every single video that you uploaded since 2017, i was there and I'll aways be. Keep up the good job man! 👍
I love y’all’s goals! This is the same stuff I’ve been saying I want to do. I want to make the world better through Engineering. If y’all ever need a new nerdy engineer, I should be graduating next summer with my BS in Mechanical Engineering and would love to help y’all expand!  On another note, thank you for doing these videos and showing what can be done with engineering, science, and imagination! It’s been helping me get through a rough Senior year, and I appreciate y’all so much. So thank you to James and the whole of Hacksmith Industries! Thank you!
Are you going to attempt cutting off the beard with the lightsaber after No Shave November is over?
Poop🤣🤣🤣🤣
Idea to try: A new ark reactor that is actually a plasma accelerator that harnesses the energy output, more like the movies?  But thanks for all you do, I really enjoy your videos every upload, and you have inspired me to learn how to build things like it!
This begs the question though, does the value of it decrease because damage, or increase cuz said damage counts as an autogarph, personally I'd melt it down and make play button blade, lol
Couldn’t be even happier with this idea go hack smith!!!!!!!
Congrats on ten million
Tony in iron man 2 my diamond play reactor
lightsaber vs playbutton at 12:43
Y'all need tooooo work for the government🤖👾
i came for the lightsaber and stayed for the cookingshow XDDDD
can you make the rifel and helmet from star wars madalorian
Me: thinking I’m getting a cool video of the hacksmith cutting a diamond play button   What really happened: Hacksmith got deep and made me love him and his videos even more
Grant Thompson is the reason I found this channel
Wow i think I found this channel when it only had 2 million subscribers which is still a lot
I hope YT gets them a new one
Omg the master James video for 2006 omg I forgot about that
Hack smith 2006 - They inspired everyone - by cooking iron man
Wooooooooooooooow
The Hacksmith just made me cry!
So in ten years can I buy a lightsaber?
Obi Wan: Don’t try it
my heart just stopped
I’m crying. So emotional
Ive said many times on many platforms how much you inspire me and how much i want to work for you, and i had this inner dread that youd retire and i wouldnt be able to work for you, but that first half of the video gave me hope and made me a lil teary eyed when you talked about the haters. I dont really know what to tell you that you havent already heard, but just know that must of them are people that dont understand what youre doing. Youre the one with the team, youre the one who built a lightsaber, and youre the one who inspired millions to do other great things. I cant wait until i can move up there and help you with your dream, because not only do i want to engineer i want to work for you and you alone, because you are an inspiration, because i can trust that youd be a good boss, because i know that id be inclined to do my best not just to keep mt job butnto help you. Anyways this was a longer comment than i expected it to be but TL;DR, what you do is amazing, and id love to one day be at your side
Congrats.🎉
well your “inspire people” plan worked, the railgun video inspired me, a kid, once im in engineering school, then i hope i can make my own hacksmith
الي مايعرف انقليزي 12:22 فاعل خير
all i have to say 4:20 it says 69%
You make people feel like every thing is possible
The diamond play button is worth $3K
happy Phil Swift noices
Whoever are negative to them are sh*t heads
Congrats on 10 mil
He needs 100 mill
You are amazing
This physically hurts you can't get another one of those diamond play buttons
So happy to see that other Poeple share the same Dreame like me. But instead of me, you and your teame are on the way to fullfill this dream. Love your videos and hope you can acomplish everthing you planed. Keep it on^^
The 10 mil hidden dagger 😂
From Captain America, to Obi Wan. We truly have come a long way 🗿
I have very much enjoyed your videos. I can't say I like each project, but I don't have to. I love your passion and your teams passion. I learned about your channel this year and I watched past videos. I've seen the growth. I hope you continue to grow. I don't doubt you'll achieve all of your goals.
You definitely need to make a larger more powerful version with a smaller more concentrated blade.
Bro this is impairing
Dude how come you don't have the 100 subs play button? I have it, it's basically a pebble with a youtube logo on it
Phase 1 close to being done? Btw love the video continue what your doing
You guys are awesome for giving such a large part of your life to provide us with free and quality entertainment and taking ideas we could only dream of previously and make them real. Incredible work from you and your team. 👍👍
When you finish your master plan you should put your products into mass production because I bet a lot of people would buy your stuff
Take some time off
Love these guys
Jamie: Will it break into ten million pieces?  Me: I see what you did there. 😉😉👉👉

10:24 is that linus's kitchen?
"That's a lot of damage! let's have a litlle more"      JACK TAKE HIS OWN ORBITAL CANON.   Orbital canons from jack workshop™
If you haven’t already done this please make a ray gun from cod zombies
No!
That looks sick I'd love to see this "broken" one beside a new one
Just a few people with a dream, the world couldnt keep you down if it tried.
I feel that I've seen this video before
12:22
What are u seriously guys thinking
All love brother, it's ok to be successful, and people will bitch and mone no matter what. You and Grant have inspired me to do more in the real world rather than be reclusive and stay playing videogames.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
You are amazing Hack Smith
It your not getting that back
Still say, it's more of a Gundam Plasma sword!
Don't listen to the haters man you make great content. Longtime fan since I was 8.
Oh that explaining you made me cry I love you hack Smith soon one day you’ll build iron man’s armor 😁😁😁😁😁😁
Who else remembers when he had 1 mill
Dude really had me in tears into the video. I love your channel and love what you do with it in love the fact the you push your best to put out the best videos you can. Much love man keep doing what your doing.
Skip to 12 minutes in to see the title of the video happen
Im so happy of the progress of Hacksmith i was a fan and critic of the chanel from long ago and cant wait to see the New inovative projects coming to our way
Cast a few super special play buttons to sell out of the melted leftovers?
Me at the start of the emotional monologue: Oh great another emotional monologue. Me 1 minute into the the emotional monologue: I"M NOT CRYING YOUR CRYING!
Now I can say I was here before 10 mil
We need more people in power like you man. I wish y'all the best and may your dreams come true!!!
12:22
He changed the Kyber crystal to go to red and blue sometimes both dang
I’m surprised it didn’t go through faster. Clearly this weapon isn’t as deadly as the movie version.
Who thinks this should be the real diamond play button.     14:29
I don't understand how someone could find negative things to say about these videos
I hope someday the government ask me to take a test that will give spider powers so I can become Spider-Man and I will definitely ask the hacksmith indursies to be my hQ to help make my webshooter
I always wondered why Grant Thompson was no longer on youtube. It's very sad, since he was one of the best on youtube.
this guy is probably the nicest and smartest on YouTube.
Been here since 500,000. So cool to see you guys here!!
Whoever shows negativity on this video should try making a plasma light saber.
Remember when his channel was called make it real uhh those memories 😢😢
You're very nice and good person I love watching your projects and I watch for 4 years I i wish you lots of Successes and Remember you are Great person
He just keeps talking he’s like my grandpa
That 1% I hope you see isn't the majority. We all love you and the team. Aswell as the stuff you create that brings things in fav games and movies into reality so we can see it. Absolute amazing content and we all love you guys!
@Elon Musk please help this man out 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Can't wait to see this cool industry grow up
I've been watching for almost 2 years I'm super proud of you for reaching 10 mil ane and also 3:50 that little remembrance thing almost made me cry
Damn what was that play button made of beskar?
Congrats on achieved 10M subscribers.  Dom't know what YouTube HQ will react  after seeing this.
Negative feed back coming from me is that I’m not smart enough to do stuff like u guys lol
As a nerd (I’m good with all subjects. But my favs are math, STEM and science) THIS IS SO EPIC
"This is where the fun begins!"  Congrats on the 10,000,000! keep up the great work!!
Rainbow play button, given to youtubers with lightsabers
Your amazing and don’t worry about the comments your perfect.
Thanks to you guys you got me into engineering even though I still don't understand it. I just want to say thanks
This guy did what no one else dares to do.
Hacksmith industries is by far one of my favorite channel. From a fellow canadian, keep the awesome work!
You create so much amazing stuff your youtube channel is awesome
I like the fat Thor look mate keep up the great work I love all your videos.
when your channel grew So did your hair XD
Your vids have litrelly inspired me to start trying to become a engineer when im older i have started to pay attention in my design tech so u have inspired me
It reminds me of Iron Man so cool!!!(the glowing button i mean😂👍
Just invent my family love and is praying for you
Love u G
“NOW THATS ALOT OF DAMAGE BUT WE CAN FIX IT WITH FLEX TAPE*
YouTube is not going to be happy
So if I say your crazy this won’t work you will become better then you all ready are ;)
YES make something of molten play button
I love you guys and have been watching since you started. also congratulations!!!!!!
I wish I had a 3D printer I would make sumthing rilly cool
Will you stop YouTubing in the next 20 years? (Hope not
Man I was not ready for that. I've been watching your channel for around 5 years now. All of the really cool stuff you've built (especially the sleep pod, that's still the coolest thing you've built imo) think is what made me want to pursue a career in STEM. Thank you, and I really mean that. Thank you for the hours of entertainment, none of which felt forced or boring at any point. Thank you for the inspiration. And most of all, thanks for the destruction.
"It's not about the button it's about sending a message "
Nothing surprising sweeter than saving great rates with State Farm
What is that thing made of ????
You could hear the pain in his voice when he talked about Grant.    Imma go cry now
Aight who are those haters? They don’t appreciate hard/good/smart work
Hi there, it would be cool if u made dark night blade gauntlets that have electable blades
Nobody has done this, you are the first     To build a lightsaber and destroy a hard worked achievement
Everyone: Nooooo You can't just melt Diamond Play Button wih Lightsaber  Hacksmith: Haha Lightsaber goes BURN BURN BURN
So inspirational so keep doing what you are doing!
keep it going.    love what you do.
U r basically the smartest YouTuber I've ever seen
You should make a new series called Make it up (like Make it Real), where you make your own pieces of technology that are inspired form your own team members.
Hmm the fact that you didnt build every project i had to get used to it but i understand that you cant build everithing and i enjoy it now.
dear hacksmith, i have a question. what are you gonna do when your gone? this is amazing. i love it. but mortality is very real. plz respond with what your gonna do when your gone. i have seen your video
I’m here for y’all’s journey.
I love your channel... your personality is absolutely amazing! Keep it up, I will love your channel no matter how much u post)
That melting was a very lengthy process.
Haha! The diamond button makes swoosh!. Good job!
He's gonna be the second tony stark
Good job on the 10 mill
Why is the lightsaber so short?
4:39 *When did Captain America Grow Out such a good Beard*
Literally almost at 11 Million subs already. I love seeing the channel grow even more, can't wait to see what the future holds!
You can tell how emotional he is about his business and I respect that so much. Thank you for making fiction reality, bringing joy to everyone who watches the projects and for inspiring me further to pursue a degree in engineering!!!!! Mad respect for you , your Team and the legacy you've created👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Thank you so much to the crew  But the whole cooking show came out of left field NOT THAT ITS BAD OR ANYTHING
Hey love your work and I can tell you really like Star Wars just like me I think you should try and make general grievous’ bike from revenge of the sixth called the tsmeu-6 I think it would be awesome  Btw keep up the good work you guys are honestly amazing👍
I can’t believe people moan because you aren’t directly creating projects anymore. As any organisation grows, or as someone moves up its hierarchy, they’re ‘on the ground’ work is reduced as their management and behind the scenes work increases. It’s not that you are doing less work, it’s that you are doing more behind the scenes work, that is more significant and useful for your time that directly engineering.  Keep up the good work, I hope to buy one of your projects one day when that store opens!
I love the vid it is very motivational God has blessed you.
I like the purple and blue color a lot more XD
You are really inspiring
this is amazing
love the sincerity in the begining of the video you could generaly see it in his eyes, then back to normal business as usual, wish all the best to you guys a very talented bunch
Awww
Case hardened play button.
You are an incredible example of a true leader. Much to learn from you.
Are you going to order a new one?
I have been a long time fan of the channel & what it is that you guys do.. I'm glad to see that your end goal isn't just YouTube. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for the channel and Hacksmith Industries.
*Jacksucksatlife would like to know your location*
Can you make an song
*sad jacksucksatlife noises* Cause he collects playbuttons
Bruh grant making an apearance in here almost made me tear up
Can you try making a lazer play button it's fine if it's imposible
He got the one chance only ogs would know
I can't believe you've done this...
682 people missed the like button through a blur of nostalgia and tears
LOT 42 WOULD BE AMAZING!!!!!
Why would you do that
My guess is it catches on fire
You and tkor are my favorite YouTubers and I’m still so sad about Gand’s death :(
I’m not going to lies you given me a lot of hope for a better world.
Super heros!? yes
you are so inspiring and also nice lion mane
I don't think u should care about how people say the way u are doing things ur try ur best and so do so try ur best and keep ur work up and stay positive
Your legend do you know you have fan from iran ?
Why hacksmith out here looking like jesus lol
Ive been here since the 1st power strength suit
Your so cool
I have an idea for a project, rectractable Wolverine claws! P.s I love your channel
You should make a real hidden blade
Man that history made me tear up a little bit...   Congratulations man you got to 10 mil, there are so many people here that are long time fans and we only ever get recognized from the dozens of new viewers but I’m here to step in and say: thank you for inspiring all of us one by one
Hello, I'm from Indonesia
I don’t know if you’ve seen the videos by Dr. Michio Kaku about his take on building a lightsaber, but it might be something you’d find interesting. He talks about honing the plasma blade with magnets and other cool concepts like ceramics.
He would survive a zombie apocalypse
Your only a true fan if you watched the entire video
Hacksmith I'm not complaining but half of the video is a dialogue
I am so sorry but i can buy it or support you but i wish you the best...
Are you whats in side
After all of that people still dislikes like why would you dislike this it's "inspirational"
Me :treasures playbutton Hacksmith: where's the saber!
Wow this is so inspiring I'mma cry but also proud even someday I want to be just like him he is my hero 💗💖❤️♥️ love you bro
I just got accepted into college today and watching this video shows me that we've all come a long way today.
Why would u cut that? It’s almost priceless.
Very nice
Wow that emotion is so real, you can feel that in his voice he’s holding back :,(
Congrats on 10million subs, I love your YouTube channel, and please if you ever need a break, just take one.  Your real fans will understand if you ever go on a break.
Came for the play button, left with more respect for this channel
So stupid!!!
Honestly I would love to apply for a job there when I graduate college in a few years. Honestly just such an inspiring channel and your future goals are something that I seek to one day see myself doing!
Dear hacksmith please make a chidori hand
Where the been here since 100,000 k squad at
Omg i loved your heart to heart ❤  it was amazing 👏  and i really love your plan and it made me fall in love with your channel and with Hacksmith industries
I think I subbed at the first Proto-saber build. I've enjoyed every video both before and after. While I may not have the means to achieve my dreams at the moment, it is oddly therapeutic to see you guys bring things I grew up with into the real world.
Legend real humble guy doing amazing things 😁 let me know when you build the fly teleporter without the side effects 😂
been here since before the sleeping bed, congrats
Don’t worry Hacksmith, we all love you
I just don't know what to say i was with you for a very long time and i couldn't imagine you would get so far congrats on 10mil and i wish you luck with the plan i will be amazed if you end up finishing this. That was amazing thanks for this talk <3 love you all !!!
May want to think about a batmobile...
WHY WOULD YOU DESTROY THE DIMOND PLAY BUTTEN
I still remember the first upload of the exoskeleton and you being on the news. Can't wait for more of you guys!
Ah, Grant Thompson, I haven't heard that name in years. He was the true king.
Nvr seen someone so excited and happy to destroy a diamond play button
Bro can I seriously be your apprentice, I'm twelve now so maybe in like a few years, please tell me because I want to be an engineer when I grow up and I think that would be awesome if you did like a school for engineering and the classes were like, ok class make a plasma based whip, and like do something I don't know but do you think that's a good idea or not? Pls respond
I just like see cutting or breaking something with something different
Hi can u plz make the levitan axe from god of war?
Wow how incredible you put the song of the prince of rap and I'm just watching the prince of rap on netflix
No joke, i just cry im 16 but i i have been following this chanel 6 years or so bc i was a little kid in Mexico just being fascinated by this man and omfg this inspirated me from do my own proyect since i was a kid and i love this inspiration (srry if i misspell something but im kinda stupid 🥺)
You are really inspiring
Alternative title: turning my diamond play button to a gold play button
12:22
Where can I buy stocks for Hacksmith Industries!? You'll be just as big or bigger than Musk easily within the next 5-10 years, and I want a piece of your pie!
You have 100% earned a sub
Also congratulations it didn't pick that up in the first comment
this is one of the best youtube videos I have ever seen.
no you didn’t you crazy
You should make a sword or something out of the play button
Why was I crying
15:35 casually puts hand in front of lightsaber   oops
Can you cook for me pls.😂
Thank God he said he ain't retireing not going lie but almost cry
Dude, don’t forget to focus on the 99% positive comments!!! This is one of them. Congratulations on the milestone, you guys rock! I’ve followed your channel for years now and you keep on upping the game. If I was younger I would’ve packed up and come work with you guys. Keep it going but don’t forget to enjoy life. Hugs and kisses.
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOM!!  You have inpired a ton of people including myself. Keep it up. I think it would be amazing to inturn under you but I am nowhere near smart enough in circuitry and that sort of stuff. Plus I live in the mid west USA. I can build things pretty well though, and I am a problem solver. Anyway love you guys and your content!
Dude you are so awesome keep doing what you are doing!
“This is the playbutton I’ve been waiting for!” *Proceeds to cut it in half*
sooooooooo you like memes?
Imagine in the future his channel will become a company and he will be able to give people real lightsabers
I'm crying owo
This dude is the real life Tony stark
Awesome
Can you make The Hulk buster
Good speech
I would sub but they swear so please if possible stop swearing
You should really try and team up with bill gates and or elon musk. Don't let anyone try and control your vision though
YouTube seeing this video 👁👄👁
you are a great person
Hacksmith in goggles sounds like a droid in Star Wars.
I wish I could do half the stuff you do it’s really amazing
Hes becoming noah and builds an ark
Vid starts at 12:18
you are the best of all time
hey man, you should know anyone posting negative comments about you or this channel, likely doesn't know a damn thing. you do amazing work and if you need to sublet projects (or even the channel) from time to time it's completely understandable.
Light saber vs your bear
Everyone : wow look at the play button it’s orange    James: look the table is completely warped
Hey James, I just wanted to say thank you.  Thanks to you I have been trying to become a better maker and learn new skills.  I completely support you your videos are both amazing, and educational.  So thank you! ❤️
if YouTube's logo was blue 14:00
Melt the play button and turn it into a sword
Congratulations I have been subscribed since 2015 and it was not a mistake your videos are amazing and provide me entertainment and knowledge. I am now thinking about becoming some sort of engineer. I love tinkering with parts to create stuff and you totally deserve 10million subscribers. Thank you!
Poor innocent play button
He better figure out a way to live forever this world needs him (and the team of course)
Anyone else realize that the lightsaber is really dangerous because some random fan can just be a bank robber and melt a bank door
been watching for five years, you've done great and will continue to do greater. love ya.
awesome job dude, u inspire me
I love you ceep  the great vids going like I now you can I wout to de just like you make a difference in the world
Very inspiring. I love your videos. I love your plan.
Awesome video! Congrats on the success and keep up the drive! 💪
I have no idea if this is to way to unrealistic for you guys or if it’s way to basic but I think it would be cool if y’all could make real cyclops visors from x men that actually somehow shoots a beam. also I fully support your ideas to expand hacksmith industries
dont u only get one of these
I remember when this guy had 900k now he’s at ten mill congratulations
why do people do these things?
I saw you at 9.8m and you gained 10.8
When will the helmet giveaway winner be announced
James really just became a real Tony stark, no one can be like James and not even James, you're an amazing inspiration James, and hacksmith I got inspired and I loved every video you put out, I can't wait to see what you do in the future and I hope you really do what some of wanted to but gave up, make a difference, go hacksmith
Why did you do that ?
Rest in piece grant. We will all miss you
Next fricking level.
You guys rock! Don’t ever let those bad comments do anything accept help you grow from criticism. You have created an amazing team of guys and done nothing but good and healthy things for other to have a chance in that field and also enjoy their work and have fun. You guys rock don’t ever stop what you love doing.

No cap, when it started turning blue it was SICK! (14:00)
i love your vids
but first you should go outside and get some sunlight :D  looks kinda pale
the broken play button does indeed look sick
I'm a junior in computer engineering at the university of Kentucky, how should a student go about applying for one of your internships? I love your videos and think the projects you guys work on are amazing !
8:19 James, you absolutely are crazy, and I love it.
i approve gonk
that color blue that the play button turned at 14:31 was just beautiful
"I've been looking forward for this"
If you see this comment Hacksmith, I want you to know…         I love your vids :)
YES FINALLY A DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON! let’s destroy it....
Who else here watched the whole entire thing
Don't show jacksucksatlife this video
I like how the play button turned every single color befor it melted
Bro we got the exact same beard what the hell😂
You should try casting an ant's nest in aluminum
i remember when he had 10 k. now my little boy grew 100x bigger.
You could really hear the pain in his voice when talking about grant and the negative comments. Don’t worry about those mate, your content is amazing, as a student in elektromechanics i can only dream of doing what you do! You’re amazing!
Your vids are lit and I like them
I love your videos and hearing your story and every video you have ever created but.  nonono no but your just great
Super excited for the future of their channel
you were the first true Jedi, may the force be with you. This will be the age of the old republic. How old do i have to be to join Hacksmith Industries?
your awesome I have watch you for 4 years I am inspired by you
Who are the originals that have been since one Mill
James please cut your hair and beard you look like tarzan not toni stark
Pretty sure I've been subbed since the elysium exoskeleton some 6 years ago? Could be longer, my memory's pretty ass ngl.
James, you are the best. Ty for your vids. They make my day.
Bro that was the best speech I’ve ever heard
And thats todays episode of cooking with the hacksmith tune in tommorow
Leave a like if you agree with what hack smith is saying and hack smith I believe you can change the in tire world
I really want to see a hovercraft like Colin furze’s  but with ligit controls. This channel is awesome!!
My heart
James   you and your team are awesome   don't listen to negativity  I know it's hard  but I believe in you :) greetings from Sweden 😊
could you make a muller sky car of your own design controlled with a xbox controller from the cockpit and flight controls just like the banshee from halo.
How do you not have a tv show
He makes the play button look yummy.
Anyone know whst metal or material the play button is made of?
The year is 2085, James has successfully transferred his consciousness into an android and hacksmith industries is the largest corporation in the solar system.
If you are working on the Iron Man suit project, you can put the diamond in the middle instead of the circular shape. I am an Arab and I do not know if the Google translation is correct or not
You guys are amazing i thank you all for this work your doing
I love your channel So much because it inspires me to just get off my bed and just work. I really love your work and what your doing for society and I really hope that one day I get to meet you.
I’m so inspired to be like them and I would love to one day join them
Og subscribe were you at
Most inspiring video I’ve seen in a while
make a youtube sword with the diamond part like at the grip
An episode of cooking with the hacksmith would be awesome.  But it wouldn't be a hacksmith video if he didn't cook with flamethrowers.
Wow that was so touching.....
I love this
One of the most important reasons that i started to study computer science is because of this channel and who knows some day work with you guys. Thanks for being great.
So what’s the play button made of ?
Hacksmith: get diamond play button  Hacksmith 0.0000000000000000000000000000001 secs later: Let’s destroy it
Nigahiga cooked an egg on his diamond play button. You just straight up cooked yours!
Who the hell is disliking this video
I have a challenge for you. I use a visual aid called eSoght 3 currently testing eSight 4 it would be cool if you could make a better version of eSight.
I WILL be here for 500 years
Y U CUT DAT BEAUTIFUL THING UP?!?!?
I am so sorry for you I don't understand those people.
Ignore them ur stuff is great and class instead of just listening to 1 percent listen to ur fans we love u

I thought the noises were real at first lol
I would have cutted all the other playbuttons but not this beauty😢
James sir I love the channel, the business, the people and the projects but trim the beard pls I cant focus on your content.😭😭
It takes 10 nice comments to make up for a bad comment
Your master plan is unbelivable cool, I can't wait to see spots for international internship all over the world! If you couldn't become a real Tony Stark, you always can become Howard Stark (who was founder of Stark industries)
🥺🥺  (Has anyone realized that he’s been growing out his beard? 🤔🤔🤔) what’s he planning next?
I am a relatively new subscriber but if you see this then I want you to know that I have always been entertained by what you and your team does. There will always be critics but you have brought our imagination into reality. Keep up the good work.
Isso me lembra o aruan...
Hacksmith: **spends 10 years to get diamond play button**   Also Hacksmith: **has it for 3 weeks** Alright, time to destroy it! I've only been working for this for 10 years.
What if there was a bomb in the button 😳
14:08 You made a diamond button a neo chrome button. Achievement accomplished
You are very cool I subscribe you ❤️
12:02
Most people when they get a playbutton: Im gonna take care of this! Hacksmith: lets see if we can cut it in half :D
I absaloutley loved the marvel quotes in the history of the channel speech he did
I was dying at the cooking skit part😂😂🤣
I got the marvel reference
YOU ARE AMAZING BRO YOU BRING THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN ONLY IMAGINE OF MAKING
lol, you should sell a piece of molten diamond play button
hey! Dear Hacksmith: I like you 😊
I still remember the car lifting stream with the exoskeleton :D Who remembers "The beanie guy"?. Where are the streams "beanie guy"??? Anyways, I enjoyed every step of the way towards 10 mil, and I hope to be here to see you guys reach 20 and 30 and beyond!
MELT THE PLAYBUTTON INTO A HACKSMITH LOGO!
You should start your own store selling cool stuff and Hire other workers in the building where you stay at yours with your
Whyd you have to make me cry ive done that too many times this week i love you guys and wont stop supporting you❤❤❤
Why ? Just why ?
I was watching the grant part. I got sad and skipped. YEA LIGHTSABER! WOO!
Next video: using my lightsaber to cut my hair and shave my beard
Why
I'm hoping that you guys will still pursue lightsaber tech because I really want to see what you guys could come up with, with even more time. Keep up the good work!
Most people when they get a diamond play button: Awesome! I gotta take care of this, Hacksmith: LETS CUT IT IN HALF
Thank You
You seem like a really geniune person. Not many like you. Cheers from Denmark! :)
He reminds me of the winter solider with the hair lol. Which not gonna lie. If he builds the metal arm. That would be so cool.
Cool vid
Love your vids been watching your vids for a while
12:56
YouTube: we're going to give you one of the greatest most exclusive awards in the whole of YouTube. Hacksmith: I'm going to cut it in half

I'm so happy to have been a part of your journey. This channel inspired me to look into engineering. Not to mention you made a REAL LIGHTSABER!!
Make your best but don't do your jobs and passion like a hell life Love you
this hurt me
I’m sorry, I just have to address James’ majestic beard.
Sub to Charles the savage
hacksmith: (cuts through diamond playbutton) jacksucksatlife: (visible pain)
The dislikes are from the people who made the Diamond Playbutton
14:28  CS:GO Players be like: CASE HARDENED SKIN ALL BLUE PATTERN SUPER RARE
Have you tried using a hotter burning gas than propane?  Like map or acetylene?
I love your channel and iv been subbed for 2 or 3 years now, but when I think that eventually you will pass and this channel might be gone forever brings a tear to my eye
You guys are the best you should make green arrow’s bow and arrow
You are gonna change the world !  just wait for me, im a 16yo french guy. I'm gonna do an engineering scools and go work for you in hacksmith industry beacaus i want to be part of this changment !
I remember watching this channel back when they built an arc reactor over 3 years ago and thought man I wish I could something cool like this 6 months later I started building combat robots, and recently started to make smaller scale projects with the whole goal of proving you don't need to be an engineer to build these types of projects and hopfully one day get a chance to develop some equipment for retirement homes to help woth mobility or memory issues they might have and help the nhs hospitals with there patients recover from injuries and illnesses
@jacksucksatlife
You guys are awesome!! I'm so glad I found your channel! I'm sorry to hear about your friend, God has him in his hands. Jesus loves you! John 3:16
I love you all !!!<3

Ready player one
Hacksmith Industries in 2067: "Hey Guys! Today we're gonna start with the building of the world's first real life flying car!"
Obiwan cutting through the blast doors: "Here we goao, Oh my Gaud!"
You should use the melted play button to cast into something. (Just a suggestion)

I love you plans and since the start of your channel I knew you would grow beyond YouTube. I support you completely and I hope you succeed!   I will be here to support with my finger on the like button.
Definitely as a growing YouTube I understand the struggle of YouTube. Being legally blind and trying to create content can be tough.
Gilla om du är svensk
You have inspired me to make wooden stuff for a while 😪
What is a diamond play button made out of to be this strong
Why. You are a great enough channel! Please don’t do this! Uggh you don’t need to do this for views anymore!
It’s funny how people aren’t talking about this backstory of the hack smith and just talking about the lightsaber. You are amazing man, I’ve enjoyed watching your videos since I was 13.   I loved how much you wanted to make things real, it’s like I could see my fantasies come true through you. You’ve done so much for many people wether you realize it or not. You are the extraordinary and you’ve made a huge impact on so many people.  I hope to keep seeing you grow. Make dreams come true!
If you want a diamond play button that isn’t in half you can buy extra ones from society awards for replacement or if you want multiple. The only problem is that they the diamond ones cost a couple thousand dollars
Youtube: congrats, here's your play button!  James: S E E K  A N D  D E S T R O Y
do a other power loader vid
"Peacekeepers" with deadly sabers, GOOD IDEA.            I have a bad feeling about this.
you and your team are incredibly inspiring.  Amazing stuff, love seeing what you come up with.
Love you hack smith! Your a great dude and you do so much cool stuff I love to watch! Thanks bro! Happy to help with getting you to 10 mill!
The people that dislike have no life
To be honest it looked better burned than all chrome
Wow they got sent the play button fast lol
You have an incredible vision. It makes me sad to see how many unrealistic expectations people have of you, and I hope it doesn't bring you down; keep making great things.
JackSucksAtLife wants ur location
The diamond play button looked cool in blue
I love the masterplan, so inspiring!
"that's only the whole population of sweden"  Yup, seems do able
The play button is the only thing strong enough to withstand the lightsaber for a solid long time. You must make armor
❤️❤️
ive been here since 250k subs im so proud
This hit me right in the feels.
Who else cant wait til the new star wars comes out with him being a main character
Do you offer internships??
But why
I love what you do especially when you make something really cool from stuff like Star Wars
Hey man don't let those negative comments get to you your doing great keep up the good work
All hail the Hacksmith!
i like what you did and if your runing low on ideas try to make a new electisity generator
It honestly looked cooler while you were blasting it
OG Hacksmith fans wya?
Pls make it better
é o aruan do Canadá pqp
Hacksmith isn’t a real life tony stark ...  Tony stark wishes he was a real life hack smith
Can you give my cousin a shout out his YouTube channel is doggyboy
Real-life Tony Stark
Whoever disliked you are cold blooded
Our best chances at being able to get to Mars or other places in our galaxy would be made up of a group from Elon musk, NASA, and the Hacksmith Team!
I was lmao at 11:13 bruh😭😭😭😭
Legit bought a play button 'cause you got emotional. Also 'cause they *are* gonna be worth a bunch someday, 'cause you're probably crack economical fusion power or magnetic monopoles or something. You're a greater inspiration than Tony or Elon by some stretch.
This mans ambition is so inspiring
4:40 "The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if we could become something more." Oh so you're not Tony Stark you're Nick Fury.
12:43 that's the part you are looking for. you are welcome
You are a great man. Your dedication is outstanding and your team is amazing
make the forse using sonic waves
You all deserve this 10mil, congrats dudes. you guys got this
You don’t have 11 million yet, but you’re pretty darn close
I can tell how much he cares and loves us and this channel.
It ended up looking so much cooler than I imagined it would!!
I think I just cried on the speech on grant Thompson.
Jacksucksatlife is cringing at the second half of this video.
Fresh prince hell yeah
To show you the power of my lightsaber I cut my diamond play button in half
You’re so just human and thus insecure. Love it. Keep on doing the things you love most. Even if it means closing the channel and retire, walking the dog.
I dont care if people are mean but all I care about is you posting great videos I love you videos the HackSmith
other youtuber: video about new diamond play button *celebrates* Hacksmith: video about new diamond play button cut in half *celebrates* Me: wait a minute
This video is really inspiring. Ive loved your channel for years and Im so happy to see how far everything has come. I hope one day I can work beside you in changing the world. Im going to get a masters degree in AeroSpace Engineering. Its always been my dream to change the world. And you have Heavily inspired me over the years. Thank you so much for being such a beacon of inspiration in my life.
I wonder if one day, if hacksmith comes to the uk, if I can work for them 🤔
For anyone wondering... Yes he really does read comments, he replies too, he even replied to my comment. (He might've replied to my other account though)
I love your vids remember the Captain America sheld that one was cool
Oof
This is so disrespectful to those who worked so hard to get that damn button 🤣🤣🤣                     Edit:I thought it was damn cool,now all they need to do is make a dooku and Maul saber.
Normal youtubers: sees getting a diamond play button a great achievement in their life   Hacksmith: *lightsaber asmr intensives*
14:20 case hardened play button lol
I saw this and instantly liked!!!
You are one of the best creators I've ever seen in the world, you inspire me
So many things to burn and you burn your prize, that's at least disrespectful 😟
People dislike this FYI. Somehow
i love this channel so much
Seeing the notification when a new video gets posted it makes my day
I wish I was this brilliant...☹️
Know that's alot of damage
In 5 years i will be calling you boss.
Why would you cut it did YouTube send you another play button to cut?
my prediction before i watch them do it: the crystal in the middle might shatter, and the rest will most likely melt since its made of aluminum
Wtf, already 11milion subs???
The dislikes are from youtubers who place their diamond play button on their wall
Creating a school??? It’s gonna be like Hogwarts for engineers, but better! Your awesome!!!
Love the work you guys do its always fun seeing what crazy thing you'll build so please keep up the amazing work i'll do my best to keep watching and supporting
You know the extendable toy lightsaber blades? Would it be possible to make one of those out of a metal that could withstand the heat and put it inside the plasma lightsaber? then they would collide like a real lightsaber.
meanwhile my brother wasn't even sent his silver play button lol
Been following for 2 or 3 years
Giving the diamond play button a new color
By far this channel is the best and most underrated on YouTube. The amount of things you’ve created and not gotten attention for is unreal. I always say if you inspired or save one person then you’ve done well. This channel has inspired me to become an engineer and given the motivation to not give up. Thank you all so much!
this channel was made before I was born I was born in 2009
Thank you for all you do. GOD bless guys. And when someone says why, ask why not and go play!
You should make Batman’s cape that can actually glide like in the Arkham games. Also I love the channel keep it up
"This is where the fun begins!"  Congrats on the 10,000,000! keep up the great work!!
Other YouTubers: my play button is on my wall Hacksmith: hmm, tasty
It was perfect at 14:14
This is really wholesome and makes me want to learn more things, and join the hacksmith idustries when i grow up
Nooo....not the play button
Dude, you will LITERALLY change the world. Like stuff (literally) out of the world!!! Love you! I have for nearly 8 years now!😁
This kids who 👎 their just jealous about you... #1 HackSmith !!
I swear he is gonna invent the time machine.
please tell me he payed for a new one to do this on lol
Since you read all the comments: by the time I finish college I'll find out how I'm going to use my engineering degree and if involves working for you. I really admire what you do as an engineer and your videos inspired me to commit to becoming one. This is my scuffed potential job application.
Please tell me you bought another one
Jacksucksatlife is fuming right now
Makes a lava play button
Bro you latterly destroyed your YouTube play button
He is now hack smith the jedi
JackSuckAtLife is mad.
13:14 look at the table warp and bend!
Jacksucksatlife: c r y
Gotta invest in a lightsaber proof diamond play button now
Y-YOU MONSTERS
What would theoretically happen if you touched the lightsaber without gloves on
Didn't get a notifacation :((
"A dash of lemo" *Crushes and entire lemon out of existence to extract its essence*
Yur the best
can u build a spider man web shooter
Inagine what youtube has to say to this
Great job on hitting 10m
How tf can u dislike this video? WHERE ARE UR MORALS?
me: sees title  also me: you didn't
But Why Tho
I love your plan
jacksucksatlife is crying. *lets not talk about minimuka tho.*
Hacksmiths "we are gonna cut our diamond button in half"  me "of course u r  :) this will be interesting"  Hacksmiths start cutting 12:30   me "this will not take long......."  14:50 still going  me "WHAT IS THIS THING MADE OF?"   15:37  me "finally, that was awsome :) "
When the play button got really cooked and the glass part started glowing red and there was the purple hot part next to u thought that actually looked a lot better then normally
You need to increase the plasma's intensities to make it soo condense it cuts through objects without showing it's flame
im really upset that people tell you that your projects arent good enough there amazing  Edit: I belive in your dream and hope you and your teams dream comes true i really do hope one day i can see products by you guys.
This is so heart warming
Now wield it back together like kylo rens helmet
Wait Grant has passed away? I thought he just retired
And the military should take notes on your cybertruck
🤘 yall rock
This is cool and all but I have one big question,... Why
Me actually wanting cooking with the hacksmith
I don't know how to comment, but I want to:  You are absolutely awesome. I don't know exactly how I discovered you, I think Mjölnir with the real Lightning was one of the first videos I watched. It was just one random video at the time, but I found myself more and more drawn to your channel until I finally subscribed (I always take my time until I am sure I enjoy the majority of the content, not just a fee vids here and there). When your channel suddenly exploded over the Lightsaber and I saw some other people talking about it I felt ... I think the word could be _proud_? Of you. I was thinking like: I knew this guy before and this is not the first awesome thing he did, so it was quite cool that now all the other people who now just discover you can see all this and enjoy it as well as I.   TL;DR: You are awesome and absolutely deserve every single subscription. The amount of work you put into your projects is amazing and you are just inspiring. Thank you
I wonder how YouTube feels about this :)
Don’t worry about other people, you were doing great thanks for the content
Great future plan, I hope it reaches full completion! The crystal play buttons look crazy cool.  Also: Wow, the diamond play button was sturdier than I thought it'd be against the saber.
This is one of the best channels on youtube, if someone hates on it then thats their problem. So many people, me included, have been inspired by everything that you do. Thanks for being amazing
Wow 10 mil I’ve been here since 1.5 k
Im literary crying  Im 13 but i fell my boy has grown up ;v;
No llore mi cabron se le kiere acá en Linares viejo
That speech brings me joy and happiness! 💛
Elon should take notes
You invented a real light saber how the hell is this not on every news channel!!!
I'm not sure why you would do that to your diamond play button
My mans gonna be selling exo skellys makin irl cod
Dude a college or research campus I think would be awsome hope I can see it when it's done btw love your vids
I've been here a long time, it's good to see you still going strong
At the start of the video he sounded like he hates us
Do u hire 12 year olds
For the Algorithm.
THE DIAMOND!!!!! NO!!!!! So weird how it turns orange, it looked like amber toward the end of its life, just like Donald Rump.
the only thing i wanna know is wtf does the table made of?
A diamond play button well use
When you need a quick video and you don’t care about your plybuttons
Amazing plan
I love you so much❤️❤️ from Egypt 🇪🇬🇪🇬
This is like the last episode  of your favorite show. Sad but worm and happy
Hey Hack Smith Industries, ever thought about selling the sleeping pods you made to the public. Customizability, international distribution and more could really take the business places and further moves us into the future where sleep docent take up so much time of our day/lives. With some market research and some public census, you will easily be able to identify the target market for sleeping pods. You can count me as 1 data point towards wanting to buy one. Sleeping pods have only ever been a thing of fiction in videogames, movies and books, well; now you can make that a reality.   P.S. Love the channel, keep up the good work.
Those 636 people who disliked this, what's wrong with you?
That's very emotional
They are literally the only people that can do this and it’s crazy. I love it! Congrats on 10 mil and love you vids
Super proud of your accomplishments, you've made some of the best content on YouTube over the years! Keep it up fellow Canuck, you're truly an inspiration!
He sounds like a battle droid with the mask on
I am I have been here since Batman grappling hook
I’m becoming an engineer when I become old enough and it’s case of you you are a giant impact of my life I started watching you in 2016 and I still watch and gusse what if you like hacke smith give me a hell yea me:HELLLLLLL YEAAAAAAAAA
I am pretty sure @JackSucksAtLife will love this video.
Please don't become a tyrant super-tech corporation that enslaves people through their tosters in the future.
I'll still be watching the channel by the time you create a fully working iron man suit that can fly.
Pog for Jesus Christ.::
Is it ok that I didn’t watch star wars and Im 14
I wish I was u you are such a nice YouTuber you actually want to make a difference unlike other youtubers
YouTube now be like: is my button a joke to you?
You should call or text Elon Musk so he could check out your creations
It looks like an arc reactor😂
One pray for that diamond play button
You have inspired me to become a maker, and I know that I'm not the only one. I may be very young, but that doesn't change the fact that I wouldn't be the person I was today if you hadn't shown up in my YouTube feed one day, and let me say, I'm so glad I clicked the video. I'd just like to say thank you, and thank you to your team that you spent years creating. Let me just say, you did good James, you did good.
If you want,you can cooperate with another man,who created cool lightsaber too on the Hydrogen,but without big backpack. His name is Alex Burkan and he has channel on YouTube.
NOO WHY DID U DO THAT
That’s a really bad gas mask and also wearing glasses with a gas mask compromises the seal making it useless
Thanks to you I literally know rocket science. I don't remember the class that much but hey, at least it is a good one up.
Please trim your beard!!! You will look much better i promise
Ok am I the only one who cried when he was talking about the channel
I’m checking the description for a broken diamond play button giveaway
watching this made me want to cry by how much His youtube channel has grown since the begining.
I am not really good with English and I don't know if you read this but if you do I really wanna tell you that the work that you do here inspire me to do a lot of things demonstrating that reality surpasses fiction and also push me to be more I and my friends really enjoy see you and love your projects THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING
Hey have u thought of making a second YouTube channel dedicated to showcasing your inventions
This is a proto saber. Unlucky 🤷🏼‍♂️
Yo the heart to heart mad me cry I have to call my friend
Is there an actual diamond? (The internal part i mean)
i can't wait to see buy some useful stuff from you guys :D
Lastly I just wanna say I can’t wait till master plan part 2.... lets see where you are in a few years
people how have jump to 12:22 ... you have miss the best part  of the video
The speech really hit hard
I remember the king of random respect to the guy wish he was still around
Congrats for the 10M subscribers!
You rock also sorry I hope my predator video comment wasn’t negative you are da best
Namechange?
no joke i swear for the past wee while its been industries
You wanna make a difference, well excuse me, Mr. Hacksmith, sir: you already have.
So Diamond isn’t unbreakable
U do know that those are worth $50,000 right?
OG FANS!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️ Your so inspiring  I look up to you your my mentor and I now want to be a technical and mechanical engineer I love marvel and video games that's what attracted me to your channel years ago but now I realize it's much more than a few cool ideas it's almost a legacy.  Thanks for being someone I look up to
i am so unimpressed by this. not by the lightsaber's  performance, but why do this?
Is it just me or does the blade look short
Man I wish I could be a part of a team like that It looks like fun. Plus I could get to lear new things.  I might be the only one to say this but, I love learning new things
Dude there are 600+ idiots
4:39 that avengers quote and just this video itself just made my entire day
how long can you run the blade before having to refill the gas canisters????
let me send this to jacksucksatlife real quick-
Why is the play button so durable
With his mask in he sounds like a droid from star wars
Am I the only one who feels like this still isnt really a lightsaber? I mean, I get true lightsabers arent really possible and this is as clise as it gets, but when I see this im still just like, meh....  Blah blah, fun at parties, idc..
Since you just reached 10 mil you should cut your hair
374,000th
The play button looked like the future gift for youtubers who will be reaching 100 Millions subs
Shorten all your hair.
I hope the best for you. Belgium
What happens if u get 2 and colid into each other
DAMN BOI
Take a two week vacation so you can have more time to do other things
Hacksmith after completely butchering a milestone trophy: oh, I might have to frame that now 😂😂😂
Your a good person
Glad to be a part of the Hacksmith Cinematic Universe
I have a big brain idea make the flying DeLorean
Hey a Brazilian youtuber already did that
I've only been subscribed for a few months now, but I absolutely love your content.  I'm not much of an engineering person myself but I've always loved all kinds of science fiction, and your channel brings those things to life in the coolest ways possible.  Cheers on 10 million, and I can't wait to see what crazy creations you guys make next!
This is what every kid who watched phineas and ferb wanted to do
“Simply start a YouTube channel and get 10 million subscribers” SIMPLY
My guy, you do great work but don't burn yourself out. Take a brake at some point, you deserve it. P.s. we all love you guys!
you tube shuld send u another one bec u had the balls to do that
Why must all youtubers destroy their buttons lol (it looks real dope tho)
I love your inventions your personality, and ik people can be negative but just don't view it as negativity. But I hope you grow to a international business and everything.
Inner nerd : 63 iQ  After video inner nerd : 6,300000 IQ
After Covid I am going to take the tour!!  You and your channel are amazing.
14:22 that looks so much cooler than a regular play button.
Nice hair do.
Him talking about comments, me just reflecting on my comment where I implied he tested the lightsaber on younglings
Only Hacksmith Industries would destroy their diamond play button, with a lightsaber
Why did you do that to your diamond Play button?
I still can’t believe that these boom addicted gremlins actually built a goddamn functional plasma based protosaber
Great video! Lots of hard work put into this. Also please make Montagne sheild
That's a perfectly cooked playbutton, soft inside with a  nice crust on the outside. Just *chef kiss*
YouTube: you did wha-  Hacksmith: yes
Ok everyone better like this video and if you dislike go dump yourself and stop watching.
Todos los que somos de habla hispana reportense
Excellent speech, thanks for all the great vids and good times.
yt: gives a diamond play button hacksmith: why i don't cut it in 2 whit a lightsaber
14:07 Looks kinda sick I I were you I would keep that one and do it with another
I saw that talking about grant got you shakey dude. We all miss him and love him. Congratulations on 10 million james. I'm proud of you and I've been here since the wolverine claws. I love you dude. You and your team is amazing and I believe you can get 50 million and maybe even 100 million subs.
Well done
The saber play button
Youtube: cingrats on ten mil! Take thids diamond play button as a reward   Hacksmith:BURN BURN BUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRNNNNNNNNNNN
10 mil and they still deserve more subs for there hard work
You guys have inspired me and I know you’ve inspired us all to push ourselves to our limits and follow in your footsteps, thank you from all of us
Please make the ace of spades hand cannon from destiny2
Bro I've been watching you for a while and you have being impressed me and my kids with the things you build. Keep up all the good work and keep doing the amazing possible and real
I would have stopped at 14:16 it just looks to good to keep going
This made me cry and is the king of random dead. Also i love your video. Im still crying tho.
YouTube has left the chat
I have this on all notifications but why the heck did I just not get it
duuuuude I feel so bad but you're still smarter than Elon musk or (gasp) tony stark. keep up the incredible work. I have 3 subscribers, (all family) and you have 10 million you r my favorite youtube thank youuuuuuu. u r the greatest!
This feels like history class, but I love history class
I can hear Jacksucksatlife screaming in the distance.
I wanna make a an A.R. Mandalorian helmet
Well I can happily say I watched your whole video and not skip for the satisfying bit. I really enjoy your content and remember subscribing to your channel in 2017. Keep going hacksmith industries. People are always going to think differently and criticise but push through as you know. I'm happy to say I'm a fan
Dude you are awesome screw the haters
Here 12:22
I just realize that the channel has grown alone side James’ facial hair
I love this Chanel and your team is inspiring and this is one of the best Chanel and those bad commenters can stop because your Chanel is great
I’m sold where do I sign up I’m so glad I came across this channel when I did
I am making madalorian gauntlets and you inspire me to be a engineer thank you
This made me subscribe
Been subbed since the beginning
What other nerd got his endgame reference 😂
Gordon Ramsay: WHERE IS THE LAMB SAUCE FOR THAT PLAYBUTTON
People saying they have a lightsaber just sticking in acrylic tube over blue laser hacksmith right now and then builds a plasma sword now that's a lightsaber
The first 10ish minutes were worth sitting through.
STOP!!!
This is peak quality content
If you ever decide to take the lightsaber to the next level i suggest using laser power. I've followed you're lightsaber quest pretty much from the beginning and tbh I've always thought a laser with the right focal lenses could accomplish this but with unlimited power. As a builder and a career laser operator i'd be honored to work on something like that!
I really appreciate your hard work for these past 5 years... I truly do.......congrats on 10 million
Man I would love to attend that research campus.
Imagine robbing a bank with a lightsaber.
I think it's really important to sometimes just do things to explore the limits of what's possible, without a concrete use. That's sometimes difficult as a business, but as a YouTube Channel you're in a good position. Keep up the great work, congratulations, and good luck with that fundamental research.
Ive been watching hacksmith for years i dont even remember when i started but its been really cool to see the new projects become more and more incredible and seeing how the channel grows!
This must have been hard for hacksmith to do but damn im trully blown away.
12:22
Congratulations on 10m subscribers and I also wanted to say that whoever thinks ur projects aren't good enough or u can do something better let them try it and see how hard it is to make stuff like that and make it as close to scale as you do your really good at what you do and dont let anyone or anything stop you or slow you down tou r videos are amazing and so is every thing you do
I've been subed since 1.5 mill subs love ur vids.
I want to cry it's like seeing your kid grow 😭😭
JackSucksAtLife Will be very dissapointed Someone Should post to his Subreddit
Buff boi
You should save for the culture
Other people sing they have a lightsaber just just a laser with a tube
Bruh
love your work good luck have fun, and cut the haters in half (in your brain of course...maybe)
He is a sci-if king
You stink
since he tries to read all comments I absolutely want to say that you have an amazing channel and you guys have worked hard and made so many people happy with the cool stuff you do
That just makes me happy
That message was really moving, thanks Hacksmith
Imagine using a lightsaber to cook foods.
Bruh why do people complain about having a large team pumping out entertaining and well-produced engineering content? This channel is genuinely amazing and the only thing that slows me down from watching every single one of your videos as soon as they come out is that you guys have put out so much amazing content in the past that I'm desensitized to the less fantastical stuff. You guys have literally set the bar for engineering-focused content on YouTube.
This needs to be in the rewind 2020
The Geico Caveman destroys stuff!
I love this plan and only hope the best for the Hacksmith industry👍
Interviewer: So what records have you set? James: I made a dozen working lightsabers, etc. etc. Oh and also I made the worlds first 10,000,000 subscriber meal
Get this video 1 trending
are you working on chewbacka cosplay
You changed your YouTube channel name
More power loader
Whatever people say, just remember you are amazing and can accomplish anything
Youtube : Sends 10M Diamond play button The hacksmith : Cooks it Youtube : Am I a joke to you
hacksmith tape commercial "i sawed a youtube play button in half"
Diamond play button actually made from beskar 😂
People like you are an inspiration to creators big and small, I can only dream of some doing the stuff you do.... maybe, one day ...  Hacksmith Industries: one of the best things to have happened in 2020! Wonder what crazy stuff you will be doing in 2030 or even 2040! I miss Grant too 😢, thanks to the Mini Metal Foundry I stumbled my way into metal casting and onto YouTube.
I finished collage after i got done i was gonna study for a job that would make me alot of money, thaugh i wouldnt like that. You inspired me to start studying electrical engeneering, thanx :)
I've been subscribed sics before he hit 1 million and now to see him so successful and making bigger and better projects just makes me so happy. keep up the incredible work
Take the melted play button and make a half scale play button? Or a lot of tiny ones for a giveaway?
What I wouldn't do to achieve what The Hacksmith has achieved
I love your work, attitude and dream so much! It's inspiring! Good luck! I really look forward to the future of Hacksmith!
To sum up the first part     Apes together strong
Plasma play button
The blue playbutton looks sick
People complaining about James not doing every project... Me, actually happy to see all the members and what they do for Hacksmith
Nerd time also  *me accidentaly chokes someno
aruan felix got jealous
Don’t worry, no mater what I will support and stick by you as much as I can.
He sounded like a battle droid in the mask
Stop with the stupid sound effects Also amazing video i love you
The negative comments show you what to do better
Please tell me your getting another play button 😂
aruan ficou com injeva
✅
How many Diamond play buttons did you buy because you can buy those now
This is the main reason we should study and not drop out in school.
I love you guy's. Thanks for everything you guys make me happy every time
youtube what did you think
So hard to read that you’re faced with negativity from some toxic idiots. Pleas don’t let this pull you down.
This man is a genius
This dude just got his button and he is already trying to destroy it...
When he said "this cannel has grown beyond me, which is why effective immediately" I thought he was gonna leave youtube or something.
Man this was a great video, those colors that appeared after you burned the diamond play button are so cool!
I just thought of a really good idea      Swiss army anvil
Why you only get one
I am watching you from first captain america shield i really love it you are so cool I just want say keep going and sending greet from Czechia 🇨🇿
Nothing Go’s wrong life is better Tegetter
He almost evaporated his hand
For the people who skipped go back it's a really amazing speech I loved listing it to it and it really shows that anything is possible if you put your mind to it and I dont just love you James I love all the people at hacksmith industry you all do amazing work cant wait to see more videos in the future and if your taking suggestions how about some more batman stuff but hey it's just a suggestion so I wont be mad if you dont do any I will always come back no matter what your making
Honestly this is just a proto saber. (look it up) Since protosabers were the first generation of lightsabers we’re on the up and up
I'm a fan and I wanted to see you cut diamond play button in half XD
That made me cry that was so beautiful
The dislikes are stormtroopers that missed the like button
The name is awesome
Master plan part 3 should be shaving and getting a haircut
I think i wanna be a nerd now. James so inspiring and have a way with words,he has come a long way. Keep up the good work James and company.
Oh my god i can’t understand how the people can talk bad of this channel. I follow you from 2017 ,i need your videos in need them NOW. Im kidding take your time
It looked awesome when the button was blue
Keep up the good work my man , we all love your work for all the passion you pour into it
I understand you and I really think you are amazing and same with your team.
Where's the next powerloader video?
You got dis :D
Think dollar shave club needs to sponsor you 👀
What a G
14:15 looks like holofoil Ironman
I bet youtube is regretting sending you that play button
Why was there only men and no women in that picture of like that time-lapse thingy?  Not really a time lapse, just you showing how your crew expanded. Like, I am a male, but like, did they not want to be in it, or do you only have men on your team because I am pretty sure I saw women on your crew before. Just saying.
That blue looks nicer than the original thing
So Inspirational love it 😉😉 :Let's get this to 100 likes so hacksmith can see how much he inspires us
Sorry wish I could join patreon
Jacksucksatlife has to see this
THIS IS A LENGEND THAT BUILT ITSELF
Bro what this entire time I was watching a future business man O_o
you're epic
have you noticed the new name "Hacksmith Industries" if yes like this comment
I love my country. (My country is Canada.)
This guy went from doind random shits on his chanel to building a worldchanging industry. Speaking of character development.
Why
Love your content alot and look forward to what part 2 of the master plan will bring
James forget about what other people say, you do whatever you want to do, is your channel. you do you and you do w.e you want!
You should use the metal to create your next lightsaber.
Hack Smith in 2040 we made a superhero that has an exoskeleton for a skeleton shoots lasers from its eyes and has retractable lightsabers from his arms can fly
You should build your own stark tower... But like hacksmith tower
357k views in 1 hour
Your the future
Is the diamond an actual diamond? I don't think so but I'm not sure.
That is so stupid (in a good way) yet so funny I appreciate
I am speechless about this. I know you are going to achieve everything you want
I think that the first video of yours that I watched, was one with you and your Laser cutter. Specifically, the one where you used it to 'tattoo' a design on a bloke's arm or leg. I think you were putting out videos under the aegis of 'Will It Laser?' You've done some literally jaw dropping stuff since then. I do like videos made by genius madmen - You, Colin Furze, Peter Sripol, and of course, the sadly missed, and gone way before his time, Grant Thompson. Your Ten Million Subscribers are well deserved. Thank you so much for sharing. Nice one.
You guys should remake the wolverine claws out of the playbutton metal
I don’t know man So much effort and time gets put into the manufacturing of the playbuttons (at least the diamond and above)
you rock I love all your ideas and your crew is awesome to
For 10 million you should drop another power loader video
Just guys i'll be honest i'm french and i am watching u since something like 2 or 3 years !! I love this channel, i love the team ❤🔥🤘 (and the Hacksmith xD) no matter what people are going to say or said just u build some amazing stuff that i am so proud to have seen ( and see ) ur invention (in real life) guys do u realize what u've done ! It's freacking awesome !!!so much good projects wow ! And now 10millions (i was here for the 1million :p) gj to all the team to the Hacksmith kiss from France and love from all over the world ❤
Wow
Houly shit the start of the video made me so pumped
How will they get another play button I am still trying to figure it out
Hacksmith industries 10yrs later would be the most successful superhero company.
This comment will probably be overlooked, and I promise, I'm not trying to take away from what you said in your video, but your master plan, is very similar to what I want to do. I've been into Computers and electronics ever since I was in diapers (I have videos of me playing Medal Of Honor on PC when I was a toddler). I'm currently 21, and majoring in computer science in college. I run my own business on campus called "Campus Repairs" doing cheap, affordable phone repairs.  Anyways, my plan, is to graduate, work in the CS field for a few years, save up my own money, and open my own business. I want to do something very similar to what Elon Musk does, having multiple businesses doing many things. I'm terrified of death, and would love to come up with the "cure to death". I want to develop silicon, SOCs, medical technologies, go to space, and overall help the human race as a whole. I honestly don't think it'll happen, but I always go to sleep and wake up thinking about it, and I need it to happen one day. Obviously this is all very summed up so I don't take up too much of people's day, but yea :)
Make the 2012 kuro kabuto
To bad you joined the stupid people that breakes nice things for likes. I did love your content up to now but I can not support this.  Thanks for many years of entertainment. Bye.
Rest In peace diamond play button. 11/12/20 - Now
Please tell me you have an extra play button
That masterplan is amazing
Youtube watching this video: bruh
When you get the fabled Diamond play button.... so you cut it in half with a lightsaber
I am working to have just the 100k one... and this guy is destroying the 10 000 000... Life.
Nobody: Hacksmith: *casually squeezes the holy life out of a lemon*
Let me test it out on your head please
If it’s real diamond, it turns into carbon dioxide when heated, doesn’t it?
YouTube seeing that:  👁👄💧👁
Youre our superhero man! You're an inspiration, you're The best
You should make a school for people like Riri Williams (Iron heart, the 15 year old girl who replicated an iron man suit, she is fictional), what you can be Tony Stark but we can't be Riri? It should be for people 15 and up and the classes are sorted by age groups. The requirements should be a certain thing in school and to enter you have to participate in like a contest or something. I would be the first person on your list if you make that idea alive. You have inspired me so much and I want to learn your ways. I love you guys and your vids! I have been here from the start just from across different accounts which are all subscribed to you! You deserve that play button! Not when it is melted tho ._.
That came out really cool. Great video. Keep it up can’t wait to see what’s next!
Dang, that was emotional
Dan and Lincoln from what's inside are not going to be happy
I am so early :O
I get it xD
Boss: good job, your promoted! James: pulls out lightsaber
JacksSucksAtLife is having an aneurism
Dude don’t listen to those ignorant people ur awesome many people can’t do what you are doing right now why would you break your self if they can’t do any better you focus on your self and do the amazing content your doing your awesome stay awesome
Early
James you just made me cry from your speech.
Yoooo if u ever goin to do somthing in switzerland i wanna work for u like thats what i am currently learning and thats what i wanna do in the future 🤯🤯
It would be cool if you made a mini lightsaber that uses mini containers to fuel it for a little bit. Love the vid Cant wait to see more
Wait what’ll happen if it breaks will u tube send a new one
Diamond playbutton is actually nokia 3310
Congratulations!   P.S. Your life plan might be a plan to take over the world using superhero weapons. I'm not entirely sure yet.
The question I have had through all the time I’ve watched YouTube is why would people comment rude thing’s? To me it makes no sense, if you don’t like the video don’t watch it and don’t say bad things about the creator or the video. The only person you here is yourself and those around you when your negative. Just be happy and have good vibes and comment nice things.
I don’t feel happy about this
If they make exoskeletons like the ones in CoD AW that would actually be really badass NGL so long as they don’t look like the obvious joke versions, it’s a difficult achievement but possible and so far these guys have found ways to make things that many seem to be unable to touch, the plasma based proto saber being one of the main examples of what I’m talking about
I Believe in you guys , you can do it !! in a near futur you're gonna become what all human needs
Hey Hacksmith! I’ve been watching the channel for years and you and the team have inspired me to become an engineer. I’m now a freshman at the University of Michigan studying engineering and who knows if I’d even be here without you. Keep changing the world bro!
Why
im sorry but id watch an acrual cooking show hosted by him tho
ARUAN FELIX 2.0
bro, do not feel bad about the haters, you literally have a lightsaber, you're the coolest guy on earth
Keep up the vids love them :)
James pls for you Next project do the covid cure
You are one of my favorite creators on YouTube.  And here’s a project idea a real life pip boy.
So cool. Can't even describe in words.
Honestly what you guys do blows my mind and it’s amazing what you have achieved
Small hydrogen fuel cells for cars
I hope you all the best for the future of Hacksmith Industries. The journey has been insane so far and I believe you can achieve all of the goals you have set yourself.
its maybe a idee to make some time but its Just that i thinks i would be cool and that is a dc-15a or dc-15 (im a big starwars fan)
I love your guys stuff and I enjoy all tour innovative ideas
WHY!!!!
Weird flex
R u going to buy a new one?
when it went blue it looked so awesome
James is amazing
look i know you were going to cut it in half too but for some reason the cooking skit felt more destructive than that
Awesome
I am so happy where they have gotten and I cant wait until they make something that makes the power loader and the half-scale cybertruck look like children's toys
The middle of the play button looked like an arc reactor.... really awesome
There are three types of people here: People that skip to 12:22 People that pretend to be an old fan People that watch coz they genuinely care
*hugs*
You have done so much for so long and we are all grateful for the work ye do ye are genuine hardworking good people
Amazing
It petity tough
Did you really make the blade of the lightsaber or did you just make the handle and the backpack. Just wondering because it really seems like you just took some goals making thing. Good luck :D
I get that a lot of people will skip ahead just to see the Diamond Play Button get cut in half but the 1st half of the video is seriously worth the watch
*When he was a kid he didn’t ask questions to a teacher. Teachers ask him question*
Iron man helmat give away?   Loved the vid.
I am eleven and I have been watching since I was 7 and you have inspired me so much and now I want to be an engineer
YouTube: NOOOOO U CANT JUST CUT OUR DIAMOND PLAYBUTTON IN HALF Hacksmith: Haha, lightsaber go brrrrr
Real content respect that u did this
I am quoting the heck out of this for my graduation speech
There is no way u actually cooked the play button
I thought that was cool, but weird how Youtube gave them a gift and the first thing they did was cut it in half with a lightsaber. But that probably meant to happen. Whatever.
It's okay to cry. Don't hold back.
Hi
James. Do you take out of country interns. I was wondering
I need mini diamond play button
The hardness of the play button represents how hard it is to get to 10 million subscribers. So congratulations on achieving this monumental occasion
You guys are amazing and living the dream of millions of people. I'm very surprised that you guys have kept up with a video a week. You all are truly amazing and have changed the world.
Hacksmith is so cool I wish I could be just like him
It turned into a minecraft diamond for a sec
He looks like the high-school jock who has a crush on the nerd but acts like he doesn’t so he’s still cool
So great do what ever makes you happy because life is only going to be enjoyable if you do you and don’t let others stop you
You made diamond into aquamarine
Don’t let anyone bring you down you are always amazing and teach and surprise me everyday
Manyak Çucuk :)
At first sight I thought no don’t destroy your new play button but as I watched I just saw starting to look cooler and cooler until finally you made the coolest looking play button on YouTube.
Congrats on making it to this checkpoint. I hope you reach the next one soon! :)
Keep doing what you're doing take a dump on other dipships
I love you man keep it up you have inspired me and set me straight
Why on earth would you do that?
Why      Why the play button         It makes no sense          THATS WHAT THW HACKSMITH IA ABOUT THEY JUST MAKE UP RANDOM STUFF
If you do read these in like this
Ok how is shipping 15 dollars. I live in canada so its not even international.
But... oh yeah replacement play buttons.
14:03 diamond play button - case hardened (factory new)
This is the story all about how  My life got flipped upside down Why don't you just take a minute a sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
anyone els very inspired?
The more people you hire the more epic and cool things you can make. Keep going and keep the smiles!
15:03 that looked like a damascus play button from cod
I can't believe they haven't invented time travel yet. smh sometimes people are just dissapointing.
Wow the play button took a long time to melt
James we don't care if you can make a video ever week we look up to no mature what.
YOU SHOULD TRY DOING A RWBY WEAPON
I love this channel
I am so happy for you and I hope you succeed . Do they sell the mini tesla
Shame the Play Button had to get destroyed, it's an honor to just witness it. And a privilege to have one in your house.
Why would you do this this is something you worked your but off for years and you are just burning it
Most 10 million subs youtubers ”im going to crush my play button   Hacksmith ”mmh yes, burn”
Wish I could work for you, im so tired of being an Aircraft Tech its not appreciated at all.
I knew u would reach 10 million one day keep up the work go for 15 million
plot twist: he has 4 more diamond play buttons
You turned a diamond play button into a Minecraft diamond
that went to my heart
Who are the 584 who disliked this?
Poor grant. I miss him so much.
*I’m Hurting :(*
You dudes are killin it! Love the channel. Also, any updates on the Alien Loader?
I love your vids. I've been watching since 5M subs I made my account in July I think
That poor table...
Everytime someone destroys something, I think to myself, "You could've given it to me.. "..
This is the great Ferrari Master plan... Oh wait. 😂
Hey hack smith you have inspired me to become and engineer and I already came up with i deign of a suit that is a thermal insilater fire proof and bullet proof in one small layer also I came up with I jet pack idea sadly it won’t fly but it will make you hover down slowly i think so one day ima build that and hopefully use it to help people in trouble
snif we're jsut a stepping stone
“Customized”
Hacksmith is playing a real life kingdom building game.
Wow that's sad 587+ dislikes wow
No one absolutely no one:   Hack smith Industries: let’s melt our 10 mill play button
The hell was thaf button even made of.  Obv not diamond. Maybe dungsten? Other than glass?
Man, I'd love to do what you guys do, but it would be hard to give up my cushy job.  If you grow to the point where you can afford a 6 figure know-it-all, give me a shout. I have 20 years experience of Engineering, CNC, Software Development, IT Administration and much more.  I know you probably get solicited 100 times a day, but I think I check all the boxes, and can help you move to the next level.
YouTube: here’s a diamond play button Hacksmith: thanks Also hacksmith: ima cut dis in half wid a light saber 😁 Youtube: are you mad? Hacksmith: welllll.......
I've been around since around 600 thousand. I'm so happy to see you make it to 10 million. Congratulations!!!
You have more subs then Mr beast gaming
I must have the button that hes sailing but im 10 sp how:(
Getting set on fire... Perk or disadvantage. I have no idea.
Are they going to get another one?
I think the diamond playbutton metal is titanium because burnt titanium makes that wonderful combination of colors
Rainbow play button
Copiou o aruan felix aiai
Other youtubers: put their buttons on the wall Hacksmith: “Let’s cut in half”
Diamond is in fact breakable
is this a star wars reference or something?
Other Youtubers:- here is my diamond play button we gonna decorate it on the wall Hacksmith:-  fuck it lets see if it melts😂
Youtube: hey here's your diamond play button! It's a really cool trophy to show how far you've grown! Hacksmith: Youtube: what are you doing with that.. Hacksmith: lightsaber go *BRRR*
you did it, you crazy son of a B you did it.
You did not to flex that hard with your cooking
i knew you were gonna destroy your play button...
Society: only diamonds can break diamond. Hacksmith: OH YEAH
Momento mori
The vidéo 👍👍👍👍 good
Please try to cut aerogel with the lightsaber!!
I haven’t seen much hacksmith videos lately, for a long time I’ve been watching this channel for a long time now and knowing about the other teams I think would be a cool 3 minutes of the team showing how it was their experience.  But have to say that is crazy how the proyects have been getting better and bigger
so when are you going to cut darth maul in half??
Epix
i am a subscriber from 386k  i just wanted to say that you r amazing keep going💙💙💙
Sorry 🥺🥺😞
Awesome video
Imagine what this guys will make in ten years
That was awesome!! You're so insipiring, I've already studied computer science but if i had met you before, i think you had inspired me to be an engineer
Why the Diamond play button and not like the silver just why
Oh! A youtube high-honor!   Hacksmith: hAHa liGHtSaBOR gO brRrRrrrR
when you started talking about grant i was gonna cry  P.S your the best
Because of you
I love your future ideas for Hacksmith Industrys
Petition to get Star Wars to comment on this
That is truly amazing congrats
That Grant Thompson part really hit hard
Wait what will happen to the diamond play button? Will yt give you a new one?
Hacksmith industries the future starts with you
how revenge if the sith actually ended
I’ve been a fan since you were at 900k and y’all have inspired me so much and you guys are the main reason I want to be a engineer and I think you are amazing and wanted to tell you this to say your doing something
I live in Utah! Also love the content.
You won’t see this but if you do PLEASE DONT BECOME ONE OF THOSE CELEBRITIES WHO ARE STUCK UP. You hear those stories of celebs that people meet and they’re up their own arse. I don’t want you to become like that because you’re one of my favourite youtubers
I have decided to become a mechanical engineer
Wow I am early on this vid
The bit about Grant Thompson brought a tear in my eye ngl.
your not the first who ha made a light saber.  edit: maby your are the first.
Dude like why i mean WHY?!?!?
Holy! Isso foi muito legal.
I’ve been watching your channel for about 4 years now and you and your team have made me so happy throughout every project keep up the good work
People will always complain keep on doing, what you have created is awesome
Whaaaaaaaat theeeeeee fooooock :0
Once he gets the 100 mil milestone oh boy that will be so cool
12:22
Bro when he’s making his 10 mil video he’s almost at 11 mil
I know it's hard, but you gotta ignore that 1% of people that just like to piss people off, I can already tell in about 15-20 years I'll probably have a hacksmith industries near me and a rocket powered bus to get there.
You should make another channel to teach people how to do the same stuff you do
Wait,there's haters?  Edit:why 550 dislikes?
Congratulations on 10m man!  That’s awesome.   Video was deep brother.   The end tho was amazing!!!
Love your channel, just wanted to tell that thanks for your inspiration and for making me laugh with every video
Listen bro don't you start crying cause then I'll start crying and it'll just be a big mess!
Bro how does this video already have 555 dislikes, what is not to like about this vid! Btw Hacksmith you are amazing, do what you are comfortable with❤️🔥
I'd just like to say congratulations to the Hacksmith and the Hacksmith industries! It warms my heart to see you take such a long journey and reap what you sowed. I wish you the best and a future full of success!
Petition for MrBeast to "Sponsor" the next big project where he gives you like 100K for a viral video
Hell yeah, I get warm and fuzzy vibes from him now!
at 14:20 that the way the play button should look.
plz tell me that´s an duplication
They are in love with this lightsaber
This is sooo emotional but I respect this so much family is forever mate
Congratulations on getting 10 million subscribers Hacksmith Industries! Good luck accomplishing your goal and keep up the awesome work :)
2:30 it took you my whole life (currently) to make a real lightsaber
You have made a difference in so many lives and have inspired people all over the world.
It's been a dream of mine to work at hacksmith industries ever since the concept of "hacksmith industries" was first established. Sadly i have none of the skills required to join such an amazing team of engineers/designers/coders/etc. So i am reduced to watching this amazing channel and wishing i could be a part of it.  Furthermore this channel is amazing and i love everything about it.
I am recently starting a business in London and I am infected with Your spirit. Thank You!
Your dream/plan is amazing, and I can't wait until your dream/plan comes to life.
why tho
The Hacksmith wouldn’t be the same without all of the other wonderful members
After watching this I’ve realised that maybe nothing’s impossible
I like cucumbers
I really wanna be an inventor when I grow up
That was the most insane thing ever
I love your vids, they're so inspiring, fun, inovating... Resuming, they're awesome. All the team, all the projects, all of that. I'm brazilian, and since I've became a fan of you all, I dream of travelling to Canada and pay a visit to the Hacksmith Industries. Love you all and keep improving the awesome job you're doing!
You know it's a great channel when there willing to risk the thing they've been working years to achieve
This channel is amazing
i love you"re content and i think you guys should attempt a home made roller coaster
I don't know about you guys, but the hacksmith's beard is looking awesome. I have absolutely no idea how to pull of something like that
Play button do be lookin yummy
Other youtubers reactions to getting their diamond play button: Oh cool, let’s hang it up on the wall. The Hacksmith: Let’s melt it with the Lightsaber!  Perfectly logical. I can’t wait to see what you do with the second one James!
Can you pleas Make torbjoren wepon from overwatch maby new content
hacksmith industries in 2069: Sending the Unobtanium play button to Pluto

The master plan sounds amazing, i think a second site would be amazing
You should also make a iron man helmet that has a holographic display
This guy is a legend. He is not selfish and the fact that his voice was cracking, that means a lot. This guy ought to get a noble peace prize
❤️
We all love you man
loved watching yall growing up man
3:44 got emotional
I wonder how many people said "Daddy" out lout when he squeezed that lemon.
Plz don’t tell me it was the actual play button :/
Try to make the light saber longer. How long do u think u can make it
Love you bro 🤍 your the goat, and keep going up! 🙏
I have only recently started watching your companies videos, and it's honestly amazing what you have done and continue to do. Keep up the amazing work. And if you have a chance, your company has the potential to change this world and help many people. If you would consider developing products that can help people who have experienced natural disasters, I think that would be amazing.
I just wanted to say that I find all your content amazing and that everything you've done in all the time is brilliant and so inspiring. I hope you continue to enjoy your work and that you inspire more people and grow more in  the future
Try making a invention only using left over items, for one it  will save you money and it will be an awesome challenge.
“Collaboration breeds innovation” Hacksmith 2020
This is officially my favorite channel
Great video, James. Love the way you told everything you wanted to do. I'm not sure if you know anyone with app or game programming experience, but simulation games where you use tools to build and fix items, are very popular (Car Mechanic and the like). Maybe even be able to digitally build something. Just an idea.
The hacksmith is just built different  🥶
If there is one thing I know it’s that you can make better jokes and do better things with friends, and maybe dumber things
You and Grant have inspired me to pursue my degree in Mechanical Engineering. It is truly amazing how far you have come since I started watching in 2015. Thank you both for everything you've done, I wish Grant were here for me to thank him too.
And henceforth this lightsaber shall be called "stumpy".
Hey james. I am a 16 year old guy living in the netherlands. I am currently in my 5th year of highschool and i am on my way to study electrical engineering at TU delft. I have only recently found out about your channel and everything you are doing. But i am already in love with it. I this video you said that you are working on a studies program for people to join. I have no idea how long that is going to take, but i am willing to wait for it. Because it would litaraly be a dream comming true for me. If any progress is made please let me know. I hope with all my heart that you are reading this. It would mean a lot to me. Thanks in advance, Me
When is the Powerloader series continuing?
James you are amazing you have a great Channel and don’t listen to what other people say they are just jealous, and that is for everyone don’t listen to what other people say they are just jealous. Everyone have a great day
MELT THE PLAY BUTTON AND MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF IT!!!!! PLSSS!!!
you look like Chewbacca
When YouTube ceo sees this:dude that cost me 50k
How long have you grew that beard?
You should cast the play button wits into tinier play buttons
12:25 min of getting off topic if you were here to see when he started talking now you know
I love your videos go on like this
Wait you got rid off your 10m Milestone wow
12:22
ps you guys rock thank for all you do
there are no accidents. just science.
but... why would you do that?
man, you inspired me, along with iron man, to study automation engeeniring and hope to one day work along with you
It’s kinda cool cause I live in Saskatchewan Canada
The dislikes better be misclicks
Hack smith cooking show would be awesome
His hair grew as well
So happy to see how far you and your team have gotten. Keep at it, you guys are awesome.
So proud of you guys here’s to another 10 million
Note to self the give him a play button
you, and your team are amazaing
You should turn your silver play button into a captain America shield
Bro time for a haircut and a shave but congratulations on the growth of your channel!!! And I wish you a lot of success
14:27 damn my mans got a FN bluegem playbutton

YouTube after watching this: You did what with our diamonds
I just couldn’t stop looking into his eyes when he was telling his story
All the luck to you hope your master plan comes true we believe in you -Ontario Canada 🇨🇦
You probably wont see this but i just wanted to tell you how much i love all of you videos! I started watching you on my moms phone when you did the wolverine claws videos. I'm now 13 and i have watched you since 2013! My mom used to put on you videos even id i didn't understand (because im from sweden) i still loved to watch the videos you made! You have really made my dark days bright! Thank You for getting me through all hard times iv'e had in shool becasue of adhd end axeity. Thank you for everything!   Best regards/ Gustaf        :)
Jacksuckatlife: *watch’s this crying*
You should make an iron man repulour with a explosive shockwave
Tbh i think itll go up in price if sold cuz it was exclusivley cut but by a real lightsaber
We love ya!
Is that the really sound of the lightsaber🤔
Let’s be honest we are living is 2020 but hacksmith is living in 2080
The 500 dislikes are all of Jacksucksatlifes many channels all screaming in pain
This is just an idea but what if you made a Tesla coil Mjolnir. Doesn’t have to be soon or anything but that would be cool to see! (I have no clue how dangerous it would be)
12:11
Hola hola hola cómo están yo solo español
Can't wait for your robot to deposit your Unobtainium Play button on Europa and seed the planet.  With a Canadian flag of course and some terraforming probes. :)  Ambitious, sure, but all the other big engineering firms started small too. :)
Well said! Congrats on all your success! 👍.... and wishing you the best for all your future success !! What you do and what you work on was always one of my dreams as well. Thanks for all you and your team do ☺️☺️😁😁
I have no idea why you guys don't have TV show or something. You made LIGHTSABER! I remember how i argued with friends about how impossible it is. It's amazing
Congrats
Diamond play Notton batarang
Who is the winner of the iron man helmet
James should be the new host for mythbusters
Keep doing you!
YouTube headquarters: “why do we even send these”
This is how a arc reactor is making
Honestly haven’t seen what happened yet, but feel like it’s dumb that he would cut the trophy
*Please build Sonny from iRobot and collab with Boston Dynamics!*
I love you Hack Smith you’re the best you made every single project that I wondered that you would make
I have like the hacksmith for quite a few years now and it's the fact that he's unique in his projects that keeps me watching mainly because he thinks for himself him and his team he said something in this video that struck a chord with me about people complaining instead of complaining about it if you think you can do it better why don't you get off your butt and do it maybe you'll be the next hacksmith Innovations are made not only building on your own stuff but building on the stuff the people before you who came up with
oh no ;-;
aruan 2.0
Hacksmith: And finally, a dash of lemon Also the Hacksmith: Squeezes Entire lemon onto DPB
AMAZING
Did Youtube make something Hacksmith can't destroy easily?
Nice
Do Lightsaber Vs PS5 or Xbox whatever  Oh its gonna hurt if you actually do it
Hey! Dont listen to the haters the real onces will always support yoou!
I love all your videos ❤️
14:21 - the play button genuinely looks gorgeous there. 😍
god bless you
JackSuckAtLife is crying right now 🤣
What's with youtubers and destroying their Play Buttons?!
Golden play button right now: *chuckles* im in trouble
Love how his logo looks like a clone trooper
When you saw the thumbnail:oh no, oh noooo
All them haters can beat it keep going bro company looks dope
Haha
When he started talking about grant I started tearing up
I follow this channel for a long time now, this is WELL DESERVED !!!! Love the work <3
Whatever you decide to do in the future, we (your real fans) will have your back. Thank you for always making my day when you upload or when I rewatch old videos. I am looking forward to seeing what projects are up your sleeve.
Star wars is asking for their lightsabre back Sir.
I'm not here for every invention, but man, I first came into contact with channel while you started working on the Iron Flight suit, and on and off watching some of your inventions. But then I saw your work on the Captain America Shield (the Electromagnetic one) and your thor's hammer(s), and saw that this was at the same time more than some one making things to make things, while at the same time being the most positive  representation of that idea: you make stuff for its own sake (see Thanos-copter)  but even your silliest ideas are underlined by this genuine excitement to show people that fantastical doesn't necessarily mean impossible.     The Hacksmith has proven to me just how much one man can do, and that was before he had all of these amazing people that we get to see in these videos, because at this point, in mind at least, the Hacksmith isn't just James anymore: It's James, Ian, Owen, Bogdan and so many  others on this incredible team that has been, hopefully will continue, growing over these past few years. To those who think that that Hacksmith Industries is less because one man isn't always the face we see in these videos, than you need catch up, 'cause that quote from the Avengers about what they are, about bring people together for something bigger themselves, isn't just a token sentiment: its the history of the whole dang World! People coming together to do something that one person, heck , a group of people can't do on their own. The fact "The Hacksmith" (a title that implies singular person) has now become "Hacksmith Industries" is awesome because now its not just James (still adore you) anymore.   TLDR; Expand your horizons, stop thinking of the "Hacksmith" has one person but several  talented people, and James? I wish you good luck on your journey to completing Phase II,  cause you deserve it, and I can't wait to see what comes next.
Very good! U Will archive pewdiepie
Fresh smith of YouTube 😍😍😍
Boys we are entering the golden age of YouTube once more
you have such good vid i love them to

Darth Vader says ..Nice trick but the Playbutton does not strike back.
love your show
I'd like to see you fellas make Kane's helmet from Titanfall 2 And if you are that good, make some connection to a robot.'  14:00 also I just realized that is a remixed version of Director Krennic's theme.
3 mill sub gang
Yeaaaa cook show so cool
2045: we built a real life tie fighter!
The Star Wars song you had while melting the button(imperial suite), I’m playing that in my mates HSC(like the final high school test) and now I feel pressured to do it amazing in honour of this video. Oh, and also for the HSC, that too.
Your dumb for doing this actually nvm your the hack smith you don’t care you could sell that for A million dollars
They should make a video fixing the play button and making better than the original showing their true colors just an idea
This makes me happy
Susan be like "Let's send hacksmith a diamond play Button" This video comes out
I’ve watched for a few years now. I really hope you achieve everything you set out to. And I truly believe that if you carry on working and improving the technology you use eg. The lightsaber. You will achieve great things. There aren’t many people doing what your doing so carry on and keep being the best. Your creating the early groundwork for future technology and something very special, you’ll change the world. Keep up the good work. The world is counting on you.
yo its turning bluish rainbow
This video inspired to keep Going on my little channel its tough doing youtube.. my its a family channel and not be like other be real.. thank you hacksmith for inspiring me to keep pushing .. 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Do you think youtube sees people destroying their play buttons and gets sad
I liked how the button looked right before it started melting
Should make wolverine claws with the play button
I love this channel and I’ve been watching it for 2 years and it’s crazy how far you made it.
Your story with Grant made me think of the phrase Memento Mori, remember death.
They do realize they are not getting another one...right?
I don't have any knowledge or at least very little knowledge of engineering or anything you and your team do though I'd honestly love to learn them if I could and I'd definitely try to join y'all out there
If you get a new base that will be cool
Yaaaaaaaa but wheres the Alien power loader
All I have to say is grant thompson would be so proud of you!
4:20 nice.  And yes, it’s the double funny number.
You light up the diamond with the light saber and make iron man’s Uni beam. 👍
Star wars lightsaber and star wars voice is the perfect combo
This makes me want to go and smash some mason jars just because
I really laughed my ass of when you said: „I.. always wanted to start a cooking show“
suiss watchmakers seeing that heat blue be like O.o
Guys, this guy is going HIGH places. I’m calling it he’s changing the whole world 100x
you guys are awesome!!☺️
The hack smith is the best channel ever, he works so hard for you guys and you guys are mean. Hack smith is awesome.
You were the reason I started building stuff and made a YouTube about it! Thanks!
Keep it up!  I am subscriber and a fan from Mexico and what you do is so incredible.  Dont let nothing stop you and let the envious people keep talking.  You are the new Tony Stark and I hope you can make it happen!  Be that Iron Man we need in the world!  Congratulations! Keep going.
I know it's hard to do, but push those people and crappy thoughts aside. You are truly inspirational! Keep up the amazing work as one of the most amazing teams I've seen!
Now this will make Jack mad lol
I love cooking with Hacksmith 😂
Make a gaming channel. Youll get tons of views
When it started to change color, I would of just stopped because it looks cool
Here’s is part of the good 99% of comments: I love you. I want to eat your lightsaber.
*What's Inside has entered the chat*
Melt all the play buttons and make the ultimate play button. Better then pewdipies one lol
Really good video out of curiosity what was the real time for the play button until it started to melt or your closest guesstimate
More like a protosaber but still impressive
You are a real inspiration to this world. Keep up the good work and thank you for all this content 😀
15:15 diamond play button more like the beskar play button
Love everything you upload♥️✌🏻
I fully support HackSmith Industries
I have but a few words after watching this video, it really did bring some tears to my eyes. I didn't start watching the channel from the very beginning, but I still did watch it for a few years, I'm happy that I started watching when I did so I could enjoy what you have created, I can't believe the channel grew this much. I promise to stay with this channel until the end. Thank you.
Congrats bros❣
Do you respond to people who are (sorta) early
So if you are not the real life Tony Stark then what should we call you Hakcsmith   oh i almost forgot could you try an invention from halo like a weapon or some of the armour?
I've been watching you for a very long time and I'm glad I did, I too miss Grand Thomson ♡
You can see him tearing up😥  Love you hacksmith    Your amazing and ignore the haters   You and your team are amazing and huge congrats on 10 mil!!!!
Big Canadian Vibes
And thats how you get the platinum play button
Why does it looks that is beginning to cry :(
Congrats on the 10mil but you have to stop milking the light saber but you are a great channel
From Sweden 😁
you will cry and me dramatic
You really are an inspiration for many. I knew this city had some great minds, but I wasn't prepared to find such talent in my backyard, through a viral video. Keep up the awesome work, and I look forward to your master plan as it evolves.  And to everyone who skipped to the light saber, you missed out; go back and re-watch the whole thing. You owe it to yourself and to the channel.
Me when seeing the title: I can't believe you've done this.
I hope you are able to do everything  you set out to do. I really enjoy your video. Make the work a better place
Here before 27 million views
Opinions are like assholes. Everyone’s got one. Keep it up man!
1:13 lol
I think that is cool but isn’t it just a long flame,
I love the little rap he did... that was dope
I'm so proud of you please don't feel pressured by the community I love you so much your so cool don't listen to the haters just do what you want and love you're so smart and cool and inspiring
"a dash of lemon" * squeezes all the juice out of the lemon *
♥️♥️♥️you are the best YouTuber in the goddam world
It took me 15 minutes of reading all the comments thoroughly to find one negative comment... honestly, for channels as big as you guys that is absolutely phenomenal and comes to show that you guys are as wholesome and generous as people see you as. As for the people who dislike and spread negativity... its not like they made an actual fcking lightsaber   Rock on guys
YouTube: gives £3000 award to YouTuber The Hacksmith: **cuts it in half** YouTube: and I took that personally.
The hacksmith if you are reading this you are the best youtuber I have ever seen and the moment I saw one of your videos I subscribed keep up the good work you are amazing. Also I try to watch every one of your videos as soon as they come out.
To all those complainers out there: Shut Up! James works really hard...
You are awesome men, keep the good work and thanks for making so many of us smile with your projects
You've done amazing mate you've got me through some tough stuff in the past your a through and through legend
Turn the playbutton into a sword :3
My dream for a couple years now has been to become an intern at Hacksmith Industries. I'm only fourteen so I have a long way to go, but its because of you and your team to keep pushing me towards this goal. You guys are awesome!
Ok now I’m waiting on them sending something to space
Madness....
this is a sin
What a view-maker
It maddens me that I know that some.... people, skipped through the speech. I swear gotta love this channel for what it is, will be and all of its workers. Keep dreaming big James. You and all from Hacksmith. Best wishes mate
I want a hack Smith plushie
You sounded like a droid from the clone wars with that mask on
14:14 Damascus Play Button 😳😳

Diamond play button: *exists* Hacksmith Industries: "And I took that personally"

I remember watching this channel years ago for the first time thinking, this is going to become big. Thank you so much for bringing me the joy that you have so far, and I'm sure you'll bring me so much more. Thank you Hacksmith Industries!
I love your content, I look forward to each and every weekly video. I've been watching since the beginning of the fly like ironman project. I just want to say congratulations on the 10 million subscribers and keep inspiring people like me who have grandiose ideas to MAKE IT REAL. I can only hope to one day do the amazing things that you do on a daily basis.  -sincerely A Fan
YouTube  Hi congrats on ten mil  Hack smith  Im GoNNA mElT IT
Your so inspirational thanks for the awesome channel and content.
Are you ever going to get a haircut
Iam from Iraq 🇮🇶 and I have watched all of your videos. The are so fun to watch. Thank you for doing this.😇
God I remember finding this channel years ago when yall were just at a few thousands subscriber I can't belive yall are already at 10 million
you inspire me to push the limits of what I can do, thank you so much for everything! I love your master plan, a learning campus would really make a change in the world!
You're awesome just wanted to say.
Do people think that these play buttons are actually diamond cause if I got one I would frame it and protect it with my life
jacksucksatlife is crying right now
Wow 10 million that’s more people then the population of nyc, congrats!!
Now obi-ani spin it  while active
You are gonna be something really big one day. I just know it.
I was expecting that life story intro I just knew he would try to pull that lmao
The hacksmith: You can see this one is fresh because we dont have 11 million subscribers. Me: We should try to end this man's career. (Obviously I mean we should get the hacksmith to more subscribers.)
How much for that go kart in the background?
lol
If you reinforce the tanks and massively up the psi you might be able to make it much hotter and longer too
Me an intellectual: let's play the 2x speed melting the play button 2x speed in youtube :D
Hacksmith Industries is one of the very few places where the border between the possible and the impossible fades away, where anything can happen.
You're going to regret this
I don't understand why there are people out there that dislike this kind of stuff.
Great stuff sir
Any other youtuber: i will protect this play button with my life  Hacksmith: lets slice it in half
Don't burn it
hack smith, i love ur videos and content, but, a DIAMOND play button? Idk man you acting kinda sus
You guy should try to build a Darth maul lightsaber?? Be cool
That button sure can take a beating.
Do u og’s remember the old garage and the exoskeleton suit 😢
Thanks for giving Direction  to 12:22
Jesus my mans actually gonna be the indie Elon musk that everyone likes more
IDK if the cooking part is a joke or actually happening xD
Do you really read every comment  If you mention this this in your next video then I will believe you. But I am not a hater I enjoy watching your stuff I remember when you first moved into that small workshop keep it up bro you are doing great
I am so proud of where you’ve come I’ve been here for years watching your channel grow but I was just wondering if and if so when you were planning on getting back to the alien power loader.?   That was a really sick project snd you haven’t uploaded it in two months snd I was just wondering if you dropped the idea or not (which is completely fine I get it’s hard and it’s your choice I don’t wanna sound like I’m complaining I was jw lol)
YouTube must be touched, but tweaked as well
I would like to make a difference in peoples days and just make people happy. But ive had more haters than id like to say and i really dont know about youtube anymore
Make a giveaway
YouTube: heres ur thing, bye  Hacksmith: LETS BURN IT BOYS!  YouTube: wtf?
i love your vids good job with everything you have brought us. thankyou
YouTube: *sends diamond play button* HackSmith: "We're gonna cut through it" YouTube: "Am I a joke to you?"
I've been here since I saw James on the news, loved every moment of the way. You guys are the reason so many young adults are aspiring to be engineers now
I would have stopped when it turned blue that looks so sick
U have been making me happy every week for almost 4 years now  So thank you for it
Don't discourage criticism and complaints. They can help you see things you may not have if you were in an echo chamber of praises. They can help you grow. That said, I'm a new subscriber and new discoverer of this channel, and yes, I found it because of the lightsaber. Awesome stuff! I look forward to future vids and have a backlog of stuff to watch, too. And the cool, bigger plans beyond the vids as well.
This makes my inner nerd so happy!
i have been from 5m
(Happy nerd noises)
And finally, a dash of lemon *completely tear apart the lemon* Perfect!
Amazing, getting a diamond playbutton  and then, let's cut it in half
I mean they could always buy another one for 5k
Wow
he deservs all of our suport, no more negative comments
keep going, you got this.
Gordon Ramsay is going to have a heart attack when he sees this
Starts at 12:40
Great job guys!! I’ve been watching since I was like 7! Love I guys keep making great videos!
He wants everyone to be a hero, then nobody will be a hero
James, you've been such a big inspiration for me, i cant thank you enough for the endless hours of entertainment and inspiration that you have given me, i have been, and will always be a lifelong fan and supporter of your channel, if i had the money i would help your patreon
Youtube be like: BRUHHH WHAT THE HECK DID YOU DO!?
Gordon Ramsay is going to have a heart attack when he sees this
You articulated your beliefs beautiful. I couldn’t believe it when I heard Grant Thompson died and I was so sad and I know I can’t begin to fathom how you felt as someone who didn’t just know him in person but viewed him as a mentor too. Keep creating and enjoying what you do and don’t let others rush or hold you back.  Edit: also I appreciate the change of channel name because it sends a great message. I have watched you for years and I am not going to stop any time soon.
You killed me with that fresh prince reference😂
*Ah, a diamond in the rough.*
Dear hacksmith indeustries I have a potential video idea melt about another 2 play buttons and combine it to make a super play button and please let me know if you read this and have a brilliant day
So this is why the people start customing their diamond buttons.     This really might get popular   Like if u were here in 2020.⬇️
Man, you really are a real life superhero. So much amazing work. thanks to you and your team for all your efforts
You have changed my life I use to not want to build any thing and now I can make myself remember that I can build any thing you are the reason that I want to work with my family and make stuff with my family. Thank you for making your vids thank you dude.
I want to be a Hack smith when I get older
Clause
How dare you 505 people who disliked this! Just how dare you.
I love your videos don't give me wrong but a diamond play button takes years to get it is the best thing you could ever get and you just saw it in a half or burned it why
Yeah everyone has an opinion so here's mine. You're amazing!
Lol a cooking show. Your plan sounds cool. Imagine if you actually change the future like that. And I would go to Hacksmith University
He can get a replacement one.... right?...
You should really start a cooking show
Hacksmith you all are the best team of builders in the world, you all give people hope to do great things. Keep being breathtaking.
Bro your not tony stark , tony stark is you
No james is not tony stark well at least no comicbook tony but for the Marvel Cinematic Universe tony sure he is still different but he has understudys to take his place even when he's gone like Peter for tony and his whole team for James but what im saying is the james might be similar to Tony but he's his own person and can be what he wants and just want to entertain people and make a difference so dont compare him to tony stark compare him to him not to someone like a comicbook character compare him to someone thats real or just compare him to him. Thats all i wanted to say  Also i just want to say James finally got a diamond play button and then immediately destroys it
Love your videos ever since since I discovered them about 2/3 years ago. And you guys have a huge part in me wanting to study engineering next fall after I graduate. Keep up the good work an stay so creative.
I hole this wasn't his real one😳😳
Some one send this jack
Bro you are a fuckin LEGEND! Love hearing you talk about the master plan and i wish you the best of luck. Don't worry about the negative nancy's out there who are just jealous of what you are capable of. Keep going strong!!
4:43 : ) I hope this channel is still around in 20 years for my kids to see
I wish they would stop covering up the actual sounds of the lightsaber with movie sound effects
This is the best thing I have ever heard they should quote this
It's crazy what you have done just know all 10 million of us support you
Thanks for everything you do and thanks for taking a moment to be James and not just The Hacksmith! That vulnerability takes as much guts as being lit on fire. I've been a fan of the channel and the real for a long time and it's cool to see where the company is going. Thanks for making science fiction science reality!
Okay I don't want to be negative or anything...  But am I the only one who sees the lightsaber getting shorter and shorter each video?
Should frame the parts that melted out with the play button itself as well!
Do you have any special plans for the diamond in the middle or will it be framed with the rest of the button Just curious
you have my upmost respect
I’d love to welcome your international expansion to Germany. All the best for your future plans!
He isn't real-life Tony Stark, Tony Stark is fictitious Hacksmith
did someone say  PLAY BUTTON SWORD?!?!?!
can you imagine this guy creating a huge company that makes exoskeletons for firefighters, construction workers, and other public workers? he would completely make the effectiveness of these groups shoot through the roof. hed have that ripple through the universe that he wants.
These videos make me feel like a true nerd
I really love your videos and your creativity inspires me so much for my personal future.  Thank you for this. :)  And well done on 10 mill!!!
YouTube is probably mad it him for make  better playbutten
The more I watch the more I realize he isn’t those type of people who only do this for money but that he does it because he enjoys it
F
If you skipped you missed out on the best speech I’ve heard, at least from a YouTuber, no offense, sorry :)
I like cookies
16:11 diamond play button fist
The title made me start sweating and made me die inside 😂 I was so scared
10:08 Hacksmith: “it’s my plan, not yours.” Haters got roasted
Love ya James
2year sub enjoying every second of content
I know you whrn yo how 3000 subs
You realy inspire me maybe a iam just a 14 years old but  my goals are beyond your imagination I want to do something no one ever heard about i realy want to support the channel so please keep one doing what you do 😁
I was born 2006 but I still have watched this channel for about 2 1/2 years
I love this channel, I'm sorry about the bad feedback, I'm hoping this comment goes towards making 99% of good into 100%. Go hacksmith !
Mais uma vez o brasileiro cria e o gringo cópia
Even though space is my main interest you have inspired me to work on engineering as a side project. I have already started on studying how to engineer and I want you to know that you are the inspiration behind it.
Dude, don’t worry about people complaining. They don’t know what they are talking about. You already changed the world when you gave so many people jobs and helped entertain during the pandemic. Keep on doing YouTube and keep going.
I can’t wait to work with you when I am older and just out of the marines and for then I will make an iron man suit so can’t wait until then
Why just whyyou should've stopped when it turned orange and blue
I know you may get these comments all the time but im a senior in highschool and im sending out my college applications trying to get a degree in mechanical engineering. I just want you to know that you are one of the big reasons why i wanna do that. Seeing what you guys creat and love doing as helped me and inspired me to go to college to get a degree. Thank you all so much for the great content and congratulations for hitting such a huge milestone! Love you guys and keep it up!
Speech has increased to 100
Noone: Hacksmith industries:what if we melt all of our hardship in the form of a diamond playbutton. Me: hm..... idk if ive ever heard anyone say those words in the same sentence before
The Golden Diamond play button.
Are you what's inside??
Can o have one ironman helmet plsss 🥺
whoever dislikes this video is the worst person on earth. And WHY DO YOU EVAN DISLIKE THERE IS NOTHING BAD IN THIS . IT IS SO AWESOME!!!!!!!   !      like if you agree! If you don't your the worst!
You inspired me to become a welder
Phil Swift is proud.
I love this channel
Super stoked for yall!
yo that master plan is amazing! like I watched you create superhero items I the old shop and thought that was super cool and got excited every time I saw you upload and I still do. so that master plan makes me even more excited and I really wanna see the future rn. bruh I tried to write a hella long thing about how cool your chanle is and that's the best I could come up with. just keep going and don`t think about those haters cuz they don`t matter and probably still wants what you have
Who ever dislikes is a actual nonce
If you ready my comment James plz heart  😊
it really looks like a great plan for the future!  you can make the difference
The cooking tho 😂
congrats on 10 mil!!! will we be getting a power loader update soon?
The Hack-smith is the best YouTuber ever, I would be surprised if someone posted negative comments. I enjoy the hack-smith so much. Like this if you agree.
Your master plan is awesome! I absolutely believe in Elon Musk and I most certainly believe that y'all will bring wonderful things in this world! Thankyou for sharing y'all's incredible inspiration.
I didnt expect to you have a big master plan but its great that u do and i think that it works, i mean u and your team made real life plasma based light saber which is just wow! So i just wanna say great content and hope your plan will work.
Love the plan
@jacksucksatlife
We love u bro
alternative title= The Hacksmith recreates Linus' retirement video followed by a Battledriod using a lightsaber. Way too long though lol
IM ABOUT TO CRY 😭😭
Love you man been here since 100k
My mom: Ugh, you want to be a YouTuber? You mean living in my basement when your twenty?  hacksmith: BURNING THE TEN MILLION DIMOND PLAY BUTTON WITH A REAL LIGHTSABER!!!!
This is amazing!!!!!!
Improve the light saber. Replace the lng by acetylene. It burns much much hotter. Give even more oompfh
By the way you can't get another 10 mil play button
Why?
Hi
you should do a Netflix show.  I'm for real!
Man, you’ve come so far. Hope your journey to the end goal will be smooth.
Even though I discovered the channel thanks to the last lightsaber video, I've been checking a lot of the videos out, even the really old ones, and I cant imagine someone disliking any video, you guys as a whole make an awesome team and do some pretty amazing stuff. Thanks for all the laughs and mind blowing counting I've seen for the last days.  You guys are a huge inspiration and I can't wait for what you guys are going to do next :D
You are the best ❤ i love your projects. you make me become more and more of the little child I have inside every time i see you do something
I was expecting a meme vid and got a wall of inspirational words and emotion.  To you and everyone at HI, thank you for doing what you are doing and I hope you guys will continue showing the word that the impossible is possible.
If it shatters into 10 million pieces, can we each have a piece??
I don’t think youtube will be very happy about this
I love this chanel hes the best
You can hear him about to cry in some parts
Sweden gang🇸🇪
The fact that i live in a world where lightsabers exist is amazing
helo im from mexico
Make the next saber out of the play button metal
This was hard to watch
You deserve is so much!
Everybody gangsta till you realise this guy has a millennium and 2 centuries worth of watch time 11M hours = 1254 years
@jacksucksatlife you might want to avert your eyes for this one mate
You should now record a video where you use the Old diamond button parts to reforge the button. That would be kinda cool.
Nice vid
imagine if that was real diamond....
I can’t believe It’s been 4 years since  I seen his first video he grew so much since then
12:33 easy tap
All his hard work and effort just to turn it into entertainment he is a true hero
YouTube: -____-
This video really made me cry. Im soo happy you got so far and you will get much bigger in future. You will reach your goals easily. By the way i love your videos😀👍
This is one of the big inspirations for me to go into a career of mechanics and engineering
Hacksmith industries wakanda
NO JAMES DO NOT HARM THE PLAY BUTTON
I'm so happy and inspired
Thank u for all u and your team do
I have been watching your videos for a long time and it is really cool to see you better and cooler projects that you can do over the years.
So inspiring. Came for a lightsaber cutting a diamond play button, left inspired by the goals of Hacksmith Industries. Thanks for everything you do.
that play button didn't want to melt, Congrats on the 10+ mil Subscribers. Thanks for destroying the play button. seeing i melt made my day :) are you on floatplane yet ?
Loads of Love from India Bro We understand any individual cant got too far you need your team you all are awesome you team even the person holding the camera yes He also stand on a great value in your team 💕💕💕 keep getting stronger  and yes I will love your channel always
This Video Almost made me Cry
Dude turned from captain america from captain jesus
This guy is really cool like he's been doing this for 5 years that's tiring and doing this with the ups and downs of YouTube it's hard and he still pushing forward and all the people who've been putting him down are evil it takes a lot for him and his team to make a lot of stuff he explained that he does not want to do it him self
I think it’s safe to say you’re the first channel to cook their diamond play button.
Wtf man, this is so cool, I'll be praying for yall
Cool
Petition to let him take a break for a month or two because they definitely deserve it
I am crying with you, it’s funny how you trying to not cry  but you want to, this journey was awesome so far  but you have so much more to do, and I love what your doing so I respect you
I've have a YouTube channel (not this one) where I make videos working on cars, but I want to expand my videos to making my invention ideas. My biggest thing is I have to make money to spend money. I completely understand the challenges. Long time fan, keep up the vids, however long it takes!
I’ve been a fan for so long and I love your channel it’s amazing
You should make the F.L.U.D.D from Super Mario Sunshine
So what yer saying is... This play button beats GameBoy armor? o_O
Hack smith don’t worry lad you and your team are amazing 🤩 I’d love to work for you and if anyone says anything I’ll knock them out for you 😉✊🏻🦾
Hey hacksmith why don't you take the paces of the diamond play bottom and melt it down then you customize it and then b
14:32 the blue though damn
Congrats, Hacksmith Industries!!!!! 😌 the name feels right
I’m over here trying to pass 200 subs and he is melting the diamond play button.   Mad lad I’ll give you respect.
Darth Vader would be proud. You released all of your anger into this play button.
We love you guys!
Now for some lemon: proceeds to demolish lemon with hand
it was great see how it smelts and change of color
Bro this vid made me even more emotional when he bringed up grant thompson
I am not sure youtube is going to be happpy about what u did with the gift they sent.
Hack smith you are my favorite YouTuber
Remember a dude on the last video saying “I hope he doesn’t use the lightsaber on the diamond play button”
I love the content so much and the channel but like tbh he looks like fat thor
Youtube sends a rare and coveted award. Hacksmith destroys it with science.  Youtube: we expected this, but we were hoping to be wrong.
Hack smith: cuts the play button in half Guy who made it: My dissappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
You go bro go beyond this world. You got this let your creative side build more bro. I want to be a invent when I was young and still want to now. I got your back bro let's change the world together . even though I'm black your my brother. Respect ✊✊✊✊
I will stay with you!
hey great job on the content i love it
How does this guy only have 10m subs for making incredible inventions but a girl who dances has 100m followers?🧐
hell yeah brother keep up the great work and positive energy. thank you to the team that makes it possible as well!
Like why
Hey can you like my comment have a great day ☺️☺️✌️
I just know Jacksucksatlife isnt gonna be happy about this one
Incredible
what if u guys build a school or a place of learning where u can teach people stuff and to help u improve the world
my gf broke up...
Aruan not aprouves
I watch it all, sharp mind with a great vision.
Well I know where I’d wanna work after college
a journey of 10 million subs has its first steps and yours were cool
That was such a Nice Video i Think you should make a real cooking because it is just amazing and the Name Bro 10/10
We’re not at 11M subs yet *is at 10.8M*
This is cool I love his awesome
I absolutely love what you're doing, keep it up.
You and your team are such an inspiration!! I'm 23, I dropped out of school when I was young because my family needed the money and I had no idea what to do with my life. I've always been obsessed with knowing how things work. Your team has inspired me to become an engineer. I've gone back to school and am now 10 credits(started at 2) away from my ossd and will hopefully be attending Waterloo in 2022. What you guys do is truly amazing! I would like to extend a big thank you from everyone who has seen what dedication is capable of thanks to you and your team!
Real talk. When can I work for you.
i love your content
Hacksmith industries the next T-Series
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It’s crazy that hat you are at 10.8 million subs. I am definitely not an og but I have been watch for 2ish years and I love ur vids. It’s so fun to see all the amazing things that you and your team make. Even the things that seemed impossible just last year! I love how you push on and I hope you push for as long as possible although I will understand if u don’t want to.
He is mad  A mad lad, mad awesome, with mad sexy hair
I started watching his videos 5 years ago and now I'm taking engineering classes, you inspired me to be an engineer
14:33 the ultimate playbutton
Get this man a shaving kit
Video idea: Making a roller coaster
u made me YOU MADE MEEE start LOVING  engineering I have been watching u about 2 years and I learned a lot .....thank you 🥺
Don't dis James reason why? You might get a man wielding a light saber/ironman helmet/power loader at your door
13:20 should of stopped there with the yellow diamond 😀😃
You legend
Hell yes just joined the channel member. Been watching ur videos for such a long time you’ve grown to be part of my childhood idols. I’m 19 now and still watch every video the second I get the notification. You always kept it 100% genuine with the fans and personally motivated me to want to find out everything I can about engineering. Keep it up man. Stay happy doing what you love to do.
Why dose that actually would kinda good
this was wholesome af! gratz!
Your health and happiness is more important to your fans than a video a week, take a break if you want it bro, you earned it!
feels like the beginning to a supervillian origin story
This is beautiful. Please do what makes you happy. I want you to know that you have at least one happy fan.
Who here remembers the first fly like iron man video 😢😢😢
James please do me a favour and get a haircut and a shave.
Hi
@jacksucksatlife
You should cast the leftover playbutton metal into another playbutton!
this is heartbreaking
Youre such a legend keep going throuh sorry for my broken english cus I am from belgium. I love your conten
3:26 playbutton's real strong tho...
I'm trying to be a rapper but this is definitely gonna be a hobby I'm gonna make some small things but dream big
Can’t believe who would complain about his content it’s amazing and this team is absolutely brilliant. My guy has helped me through so much and I’m in a better place now due to it
Hispanohablantes manifiestense!
goodshit bro
We miss you Grant!!😭😭😭
Whyyy
I think you could pull of the john wick look, but with lighter hair
Dude, I respect that. And don't sweat the haters. Perfection is 99%. There will always be that 1% of people who are completely unreasonable. Success is being the best you, you can be. And I think you're crushing that. Congratulations on getting here, and the best of luck with your plans.
Trying a diamond button with a lightsaber is like erasing a strongest weapon in a RPG after a years of grinding for it... O_O
What a cool vid but PLEASE tell me that you will get another dimand play button
You guys are amazing! Keep going!
Alternative video title: how to turn a diamond play button into a gold play button
When he was talking about grant he looked like he was going to cry. Rest in peace grant.
“What happened to your play button?” “Oh, I cut it in half with a lightsaber.”
Your doing amazing
YouTube if your reading this please send him a new play button. He deserves this more than anybody even though he lightsabered this one
You all are great and smart people hacksmith industries
It has been a long time watching now. Remember the first wolverine claws, the wire stunt rig and the first exo suit series. When looking back at the upload dates it has been about 7 years. And I’m also one of those 10,23 million population of Sweden 🇸🇪
Hacksmith: Destroys Diamond Play Button with a Lightsaber  JackSucksAtLife: How could you do this to me?
I just love all your vids
New way to cut a diamond; with a laser sword. (Little reference)
Love your videos man!!! Keep up the great work and keep making cool fictional things.
Please make a Mandalorian helmet
👍
I haven’t even watched the entire video I I would be glad to give this one a like. All of your inventions are super awesome! I hope that you and everyone at Hacksmith industries go very very far with whatever you want to do! You guys are absolutely awesome and I hope the best for you today, tomorrow and forever!😃
The grant Thompson part made me shed a tear
How does this even habe more than 0 dislikes
When you mentioned Grant I nearly cried... I used to watch his channel all the time and I still do but, its not the same without him
Obi wan: you were supposed to save the play button, not destroy it.
First half almost got me crying, respect.
Hacksmith: cuts diamond play button Youtube who spent so much money and time making it: *cat with thumbs up meme*
If you're just reading this I'm hoping you have a great day ♥️
Hacksmith industries is very inspiring to me and is really helping me get through school, and pushing me to do my own projects, thank you hacksmith.
Good luck!
He has a state of the art protosaber, still needs spark thing to activate. Love your videos
This was a great video, thank you Hacksmith. I think you’re awesome and want to be you when I grow up
this man is a legend we will definitely build the future i wouldn't be surprised if he made a flying cart content i was a sub for 5 years :)
I was here when you guys were still at 1mil
Youtube isn't going to replace that u know
Hacksmith:2006 I: campioni del mondo
great stuff mate, you have an awesome team and do some great stuff. love the team work and thinking together makes projects better.
can i have a mini buton
"you can tell it's fresh because we're not at 10 million yet".   *Checks sub count*     Mfw he's at 10.8mil already
I'm so glad that you reach 10 million subscribers I remember watching the exoskeleton like a year after was released but I think the first video I watched was the airsoft umbrella I also used to talk with my technology teacher about the stuff you're making every bonded over that
Man your the most kind man i selute you🙋 you yeah you can make things to help man kind Forever
Ooh early squad
Can't believe I've been subbed for almost 3 years now...
man that hangar was thicc (07:42)
My goodness, you with the mask on sounds like a slightly muted Battle Droid
That table is a simple fix, just get a wire wheel, scratch off the paint, get a c clamp or something and just put a                                                __                                       ——>   |           _5/8 |\___4-8__/             5/8 |/     4-8 On it
mine to
grant was my favorite :(
Sorry man I feel bad for you being doing stuff everyday you're the real one we believe in you
it faults a Little of oregon and pepperoni!
His very first video was bad guy chase scene... now it’s making the world’s first lightsaber. What a journey.
Make The follout power armor please  : )
This is so sad his best friend died 😥😢😭😓☹🥺I could tell hacksmith was about to cry whene he sed life is short whene he sed the last text of his best friend that is just like 😥🥺😓😭🤧 sad
Did they made this button Hacksmith proof?
I love ur video have been watching for for years u r amazing your videos helped me get through a really tough time do thank you for the amazing content
Not gonna lie, this seems like Aruan Felix with extra steps...
Its like he speaks his purpose so purely that his voice shakes! Respect man ! 🙌🏽❤️💛✨
Me: watches the whole video and wants to like it two times Youtube: "U know what, yeah this one time..."
I sawed this play button in half!
I’m now 17 and my goal is to work in Hacksmith industries. If not, doing an intership there. Such a inspiring and awesome team. I have my goal and I hope I’d be able to check it like you did with yours. Lot of love and admiration
15:09 why does this remind me of the second iron man movie when tony makes a new element for the arc reactor...dont worry james i watched the whole video and i fully support ur “MASTER PLAAAAN”, i wish u the best
His next milestone should be “making iron man  armor out of diamond play buttons”
Why!?!?
Youtube: *sends a 10 million play button* Hacksmith: "Lets melt it with the lightsaber." Youtube: "Am I a joke to you."
I found your channel when you made your first wolverine claws and I've been subscribed ever since. Hopefully you'll be able to work with Elon Musk soon. Keep up the great work.
Next vid: lightsaber vs haters
I hope your plan, and dream comes true!
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BEARD IT LOOKS SO MUCH BIGGER
So you're telling me, that's this thing can break through a vault door faster than it can go through a play button
I Love you  Your Videos  And your Plan  Thank you
Youtube wants to know you're location
Big beard
I allways thinking about something.... CAN U MAKE A WORKING DUEL DISK FROM YU-GI-OH?
We all gotta admit though, Google puts a lot of robustness and high quality into those Diamond Play Buttons. And I'm glad I've been along for the ride for the past few years, I almost can't believe I've been a subscriber since before even a million subs. If memory serves, one of the first videos I watched was the Augmented Reality HUD, but I only became a subscriber when you picked up that Mini with the Exo. So by that, I can say the last 4 to 5 years have been a fun ride, and the next 10 to 20 more will be epic :D  Edit: I looked into the Wayback Machine and I've actually been here since before even 500k. Wow, I feel old, but theses are happy memories to look back upon fondly :)
The history and future plans part of the video was great and touching you couldn't litterally hear the emotions in james' voice <3
11:08 Because everyone knows that the main ingredient to having a Diamond Play Button? _Thyme._ Lots and lots of thyme...
why is the hacksmith so cut!!!!
Who was here before 10 million subscribers?
I remember watching you in the 7th grade, I’m a junior in high school now and it’s crazy to see how much you’ve grown. Love this vids and all the work that goes into it!
Please make a Youtube playbutton sword
Why dont you try somthing whith adam savage i think both would make somthing big and cool because you both think a like you should try it
I like fresh prince of bel air and when i heard that intro i smiled 😀
Are we just going to ignore the "The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more" quote
The people who disliked do not have a soul
I wonder if he’ll keep going and building when he’s a elderly man
What is the play button made of? It tool much longer than I thought to melt
Hey what part of Canada are y'all in Im planing to move there.
You’re soo cool ah 😩❤️💛🔥✨
what do you think is harder to make the WHOLE iron man suit or the robot suit from Infinite Stratos (Anime)
I honestly think people that dislike only do it just because they want to be one of the few to do it, because I can’t comprehend not liking this enough to dislike it.
Even after so much of explanation 20 dislikes....man those guys are something
For real the hack smith has been a great influence he makes things only I could imagine  Thank you
Elon musk who
Good luck to you in the future, your business is one of a kind👍
For what you actually clicked on this video for, skip well over half the video aaaallllll the way to 12:40
You guys should use an osmium pole to make the lightsaber able to clash
Yo I remember grant he was awesome
How could ANYONE have any negative feedback. He is so awesome.
Good luck
I found my dream job anybody else?
Can a future project be an ecological project that helps the environment i think global warming is a big problem i think a big youtuber like you can make an impact. And thank you for always inspiring me to make my own inventions thank you.👍👍👍
Youtube: let's send the Hacksmith a diamond play button The Hacksmith: C  U  T   I  T
Like try making Big hero 6’s  magnetic robot he moves with his mind or the other small magnetic robot. It will be kinda sick
Can you and you’re  Team make a Pause that’s to much work pls do a holiday.
14:17 leaked image of the 150 million Saphire button
12:22 4 u Internet
You probably have heard this 1millon times but you actually expired me to do engineering  One of the amsomes youtubers to be a subscribed to  Just awesome, you are
of course its a better play button, its the worlds first diamond play button cut in half by a lightsaber, and that is one hell of a milestone
Nice
I haven't even made it to the 5 minute mark yet and I'm already really really enjoying this. Congratulations on 10 million!
My heart hurts seeing this play button split open
Your nuter than nuts
How much propane did this take
...i feel like I wanted this to happen yet wanted them to just buy one instead of destroying the OG
you should make more anime weapons
I so glad to have been here on the channel for so long. It feels so good to have watched you and you're team grow over these years and I can't wait to see what you guys do! I wish I was able to support the channel in the past, and now there are so many other people supporting the team. Like many people have said before, I hope to see you all grow bigger and better!  Sorry for the paragraph.
Whyyyyyyy
Honestly? You are the only one that can do something BIG like it. I live in Italy and I hope to see your campus soon guys
I’ve been watching for a minute and this is what really pulled me to engineer
i love how in the youtube store you can just buy them if you got one already so atleast he int damaging his pride and joys
I can't believe you've come this far I'm so happy for you good luck with the industry
This does put a smile on my face.
he isn't hacksmith         the team is
Everyone wants to be famous until they are! Thank you for all you do and put up with man I love this channel!
I think this was kinda crappy of him. Most of us could only dream of getting that play button and he kinda shit all over it. Just my opinion. I don't expect anyone to agree
Huuh, i dunno what to say guys,      YOU MADE IT
I feel like more YouTubers destroy their play buttons than actually keep them
This is nice but you’re starting to sound like a mad man with the “a future with more exoskeletons” thing
Your voice at ~3:30 where you were breaking up a bit really got me. You're doing a great job - no a fantastic job. Don't let the fckin haters get you down. You can't do everything alone ... and I know you know that. Keep it real .. or make it real. Thank you for all you've done.
Helo
That 1 percent who complained about your videos are probably Karen’s and idiots... wait that’s the same thing
You should make a scyth
To all of the will smith fans out there: he should of done the whole fresh prince song
My cat just died and your channel let me get new ideas and some of them I have built
You guys should make your own Mandalorian armor it would be so cool
Gets Diamond Play Button No one:  Absolutely no one: Hacksmith: ima cut it
James is the chosen one
Youtube should send u another button lol
Thank you hacksmith for everything you have inspired me to become and engineer myself and it would be cool to work with y’all and learn from y’all after I graduated college
Youtube watching this: 👁️👄👁️
I can imagine the future... Hacksmith Industries with a complete production line for lightsabers, mechsuits and other awesome stuff that anyone can buy! It could become a billion dollar company if they even sell to the army and so! Selling mechsuits like it's a sportscar! Tesla and SpaceX is awesome but we NEED lightsabers and flying iron man/mechsuits!
Happy 10 million sub you worked so hard
Man you are probably the one person alot of us wanting to go into these fields inspires me everyday. I know I'm not gonna be building proto sabers and thor hammers and civil warriors shield. But, with you doing this you make my water droplet in a rainstorm feel like a rock into a quiet pond. Keep it up and forget the haters they can't hurt the guy equipped with real life super hero equipment.
@jacksucksatlife
dear hacksmith can i make a suggestion, take the negative comments you get print them out and burn them because you are doing an amazing job and i would just like to say thank you, you have created a company and incredible team and inspired lots of young creates and for that i want to say thank you but not just you to the team stud next to you as you may have started this but it has grown beyond one man so don't let the negative comment affect you keep working hard you deserve the play button.
Wait they still give you play buttons?         I thought all you got was a dinky plaque
I love this video, 10/10. You've got my support, Hacksmith. Thank you for making videos like this for viewers like us.
Nooooooo plsssss
I’ve been watching since your first Batman video I’m a huge fan your one of my idols I want to grow up to be like u all u do is have fun
Youtube be like Congrats on your diamond play butto- and your already cutting it with a lightsaber
Early but nof before anyone who is a member Respect
I came to watch destruction, but I got inspiration. Hope you get to your goals. I know one more comment isn't much but I'm personally inspired by you and your team. You guys keep inspiring me to try to learn  a lot of stuff
Good Wishes from Germany
I going to make sure to cook the play button if my channel even gets to that much subs
Tony stark may not be pheasable,but you and the team are the damn closest thing we're probably ever gonna get-and I'm pretty happy with that
This blue color looks so good  Is it just me? (14:34)
I have an idea. Have you heard of core games? They are simple. Control reactor simulator. You can try to make this plasma very strong, make 7 next lightsabers and then all of them initiate and try to direct all of the lasers into one point. I prefer to make huge chamber in case if plasma will create a star.
Didn't even realize the account *wasn't* called "Hacksmith Industries" already
I wish I could work with him
Literally every one with 10 mill button :background.       Hacksmith ;lets cut it in half
*angry JackSucksAtLife noises*
I have been watching scene 1 million subscribers
Hey the hack smith I have been watching your channel for 3 years now and am so excited with your future plan and want to thank you for inspiring me to build my own robots and projects. Super excited for the coming years for hacksmith industries
12:36 What you come for ☜ (↼_↼)
Me: GO BACK I WANT TO BE MONKE
I've hit skip ahead so many times and he's still talking. GET TO THE BIT I CAME TO WATCH
you should talk to markiplier
The play button is barely fresh lol you have 10.8 mil subs
I think that this is James Hobbs talking to us not the Hacksmith.
Everybody put on the lightsaber making video and watch it as many times as you can, you can even play loops in the background, this will become  hacksmith industries's most watched video🔥🔥🔥
ulan asla hiç bir bok anlamdığım bi videodan bu kadar etkileneceğimi tahmin etmezdim neyse zaten sizde bu yorumdan hiç bir bok anlamıyacaksınız başarılar
Damm bro anyone else get soo sad, keep going james 👍
Bro look at his old videos he has barely a beard
Keep going and you will make it
”That’s only the entire population of Sweden”
Sort of feels a bit rude to YouTube?
I think your channel already improves quality of life, at least for those who are still in lockdown!
2020 has been an awful year , but when i seen some one made a lightsaber it made me really happy , finally some good news . tony hawk once said if you love something give back to it and watch it grow , you might not be able to live up to being the tony stark of real life but you are on you are on you're well on your way to becoming the tony hawk of engineering
Its basically a flamethrower gone too far lol
Glad I didn't skip it. That was really inspiring. If you were ever about to expand to other country like you said, please think about Poland/Germany or at least Europe
Look at hacksmith man so inspirational   If you know you know
Omg you basically have your own business and a head quarters good luck with your stress
why is the light saber so short
Keep up the good work
His lightsaber was just a money make and I ain’t complainint
the name change.....
You are such a nice guy. So many people are so proud of you. You cant satisfy everyone so just try to satisfy the majority. I can tell you im satisfied and as long as you are satisfying at least one person, thats enough of a reason to go on.
Dear Hacksmith, your content inspires all those who wish to be inspired, entertains tose who require entertainment and informs those who want to be informed. Ones who don´t see that, don´t want to see the greatness you release into the world, the innovation and inventions you and your amazing team come up with is always something i look forward to see in my feed.  It is obvious that the walls in your way are endless, but after all you have a lightsaber, so go for it!  Keep it coming when ever you feel like it, we will be here and wait for you to greet us with a new world of innovation. Your fanbase ; )
Hacksmith: Long have I waited for this moment
Brother I LOVE Your team and your videos are AMAZING and if I could I would donate to your station but alas I am collecting unemployment due to the covid-19 epidemic. But keep up all that you do and for those that complain about what you and the team does well that doesn't really matter to those of us that your videos make smile and find some joy in these hard times. And after all of that I just want to say thank you for your efforts and creation's. And know I send LOVE and LIGHT to you and yours and may the GRAND ARCHITECT shine his light on you and your team's path
Using YouTube as a stepping stone to creating a real international industry (Hacksmith Industries) is actually a great idea and you have done that well.  I can't wait to see you and the company grow to become something that can make an even bigger difference in the world (Which does not mean you guys haven't made an impact.  You definitely did!).  Great dreams should not be dreams.  They should be reality.
Damn, that diamond button looks delicious
I love your videos, and hopefully someday I can intern for you!
Your plan is how the spartan program is going to exist in real life
7:44 He doesn't plan on retiring so that a long way to go I one day hope to work at hacksmith industries
I have one complaint... the feels man! All jokes aside, I've watched this channel for almost 9 years and I plan to keep watching, keep of the Amazing work!
YOU ARE CRAZY
Seriously the smith of Youtube-Air. This was the best part.
I will tell some day to my non existing yet kids that I watched this guy even before he was known. Love You, keep Your work.

Haters just make it harder for creators
Pls visit a hairdresser ;)
The 500 people that disliked...    I’m sO oFfEnDeD tHaT yOu sAiD I cOmPlAiN!
Very cool.
Can you make the overboard from back to the future one day?
Elon Musk: I need a spaceship a few scientists to show me how we could live on mars... and someone get this man some funding. Hacksmith: *Happy Hacksmith noises*
I'm a student and I would love to volunteer at your work place. If that's cleaning or sortings things for you I would love to do it.
I have been here since 5.1k and love you're content
You are not the real life tony stark i think tony is based on you
Yutube is crying now HAAHAHAH sorry yutube
Still not verified lol.
Somebody needs to send this to Jacksucksatlife soon
WHY MUST YOU DO THIS TO A VERY VALUABLE ITEM!!! I'M CRINGING!!!!
I was about to skip straight to minute 11, I'm glad I didn't <3
your good bro those people that wright negative comments are just stupid and there will always mean people in the world just live life to the fullest.
hey bro i love your channel I am from north bay Ontario and I am proud to live in Ontario because of you
Why do these guy’s have only 10mil they should be at 80mil they deserve i.
So you are basically Emperor of the man kind (Warhammer40k )
Keep on making your family bigger hacks Smith industry
Hell yeah good for you
Hack Smith you are perfect you don't need to change anything 👍
Wow wow wow James! You have come such a long way with this channel, I remember watching it when you were just in your garage, what you have created now is truly amazing. I have so much respect for you and your team, everyone at Hacksmith Industries is the next best thing to superhero! I'm sure that your plan to upscale, whilst ambitious, will undoubtedly succeed and you will continue to bring joy to so many people. I have been so inspired by your work and hope that one day I can do an internship with you. Thank you so much for being such an inspiration and source of happiness to the engineering community. Here's to another 10 million!
i remember watching the will it laser videos all those years ago, and now here we are, it has been wonderful to see this channel grow into what it is now
How long did it take to cut?
See if you can find a way to make a double bladed lightsaber
Ha! Take that youtube! Wait can that lightsaber cut through a NORMAL diamond. The unbreakable types...
To show you the power of flex tape, I sawed this diamond play button in half!
14:15 can you do that to ma bike? Haha Woow look soo cool! Like jet fuel or something
Jeez what is this play button made of!
i hope your dreams come true
How many mini play buttons are there total?
That’s so cool. I love all the colors the play button turned.
How about every member of the team has one video a week you know giving yourself a break for a bit and giving us even more original content
Grevious wants to know your location
Damn. He got emotional and I felt that. Hope you the best for the future and im all here for it
You and your team amaze me each week ! You guys are really inspiring <3 full support from France
I hoe a YouTube executive sees this and just starts thinking y they sent this to him in the first place.
Hey dude, that message was really moving and I think you should continue chasing your dream. One day you’ll make it and I’m so thankfull that you’ve shared your journey with us and I’m looking forward to see you succeed! If you have to slow down on youtube I think people will understand that obviously a real buisness has a better future than a youtube channel, whatever the amount of subscribers. I’ve been following you for years even before I had a youtube account and even as an under 10yo kid and its incredible to see what you’ve become! We love you guys! Keep it up!
Next project: I MADE MY OWN DEATHSTAR AND BLEW UP A PLANET.
Your so awesome man, you do all kinds of crazy stuff and it’s so cool love watching all of your video’s.Your such a great genuine guy who cars about his fans. Huge fan, good luck with you master plan pt. 2!
This is the start!
Everyone: "he is Tony starks" Me a intellectual: He's clearly "Obi One"
😅
14:28 it looks beautiful
WHY WOULD YOU TRY THAT
I want to work with you when I grow up, I want to study bionic engineering
You could *sell HACKSMITH Flamethrowers* on your store like Elon did with the Boring Company
Now why would u do that
Bro I'm still surprised that he and his crew made a lightsaber that's basically rocket science!
Keep up the good work on the channel also you should try and make a runner or hunter from a game called generation zero
You know its the hacksmith when his example of an EDC item is an exoskeleton. Keep doing what you do and don't stop!
You make me cry i love you i wach you sins you stardid you make me you made me  want to build stuff like you
Don't listen to the complainers, keep doing what you do. Your group will revolutionize the world.
keep up the good works that can make our scifi dreams come true
I watch you sind 2016
İts damn 01:16 a.m in turkey and im the only turkish person watching this
why why would you do this
Aruan 2.0
I love your vids thanks for looking at comments
Seeing that part about Grant almost made me cry
If Dave Grohl was a crazy scientist/engineer
He is slowly becoming a Viking
Like of your an og 👇👇👇
Your now my dad no exceptions
Man people are that mean that they dislike a video
Your not as good as tony stark bexause he isint reel but you are the closesed we got to tony stank❤🙂
Good job you have made great achievements over the years thank you for entertaining me  Edit: you inspired me to do more
I started rying because this was so emotional, i didn't know he wasn't gonna cry lol.
“That is only the entire population of Sweden” I was dying when I heard that 😂😂
This video is an emotional roller coaster. Your team is just soo inspiring
I have a lot more respect for you now, that’s saying a lot because who could disrespect someone who made a real lightsaber
That so cool
"1% of negative comments" *A great deal of disturbance in the force, I felt...*
So ur telling me that he was talking how important getting 10 mill is for 12 minutes for him to just destroy the thing he was going in about for 12 minutes 😫🤔😂
Bro Rick rn like 😱😭
Screw the negativity - you built a great TEAM. Lots of talented people in the Hacksmith shop.  Think of how many people you got excited about developing usable skills. The Bill Nye of engineering? Inspiring others is a GIFT. Thank you.
If I’m being completely honest I would like to see more of your team, because I see someone doing something in the background and I always want to know who are they, what do they do, what are they doing right now?
For all those people who are worried about the play button he will get 10million more subscribers by tomorrow
You are awesome! Good job!
I got a challenge try make a iron man nano sword
Twomad be like ARE YOU CHALLENGING ME???!!
You should make a retractable wolverine
i am a long time subscriber and i love you vids since 2016
Can we just appreciate this great presentation, led literally only with his voice and body language? Good job
Is this man almost at 11mil already
Now that's a lot of damage
Man Hacksmith don't let haters get to you and if I'm being honest your imagination of making movie and game items real that itself is amazing you are awesome and you a have flipping lightsaber who won't want to work with you and be like you I would do anything to accomplish what you have you truly are amazing and one of the best keep up the good work and my inner nerd self would do anything to meet you. :)
Why did you melt a piece of history
You aint Tony Stark....... you are far better than Tony Stark because 1) you are real and 2) you are literally so cool.
Don't let whatever those negative hateful people say. It is men like you that push the bounds of society forward into the future and the fact you are doing all this for humanitarian purposes is amazing. Thank you for everything you have an will do.
if there's a zombie apocalypse im coming to this guys house
I know your going to be like "dont go in comments and be mean to those people" but im doing it anyways. Whats your problem and why are you the way that you are you jealous pathetic excuse of a human being. Also you are amazing James and glad you do this!
You inspired me so much, I wish one day I could be like you
The best of many great episodes. Your plans are great and I'm looking forward to see how "Hacksmith Industries" grow and flourish. P.S. can you try to make any gadget from "Mission Impossible", that would be awesome
If you are Cyber Bullying him just stop, he works so hard and and it’s just mean.
I feel like hacksmith industries is gonna be like Boeing except robots instead of airplanes
Jacksucksatlife wants an explanation
everyone liked that🙂
You maybe know this already but you can buy replacement rewards on the site: society rewards. It is the official company who makes the awards for youtube.
This makes me so sad bc I have always wanted a playbutton so yea :(
Absolutley love the plan
Inspirational 1000/10
Love your comment and one time you actually replied to my comment and that made me sooo happy and I loon forward to your videos every week and still surprised at the stuff you do
you know i would honestly love a "cooking with hacksmith" id watch every episode
You are amazing I’m a long time fan I’m
Can you make a video with Mark Rober?
Wow he just ruined the fresh prince for me
bobby can make you a new one
I guess they wont send you a new one, right? xD
im just waiting for the hacksmith industries make new technology
That poor diamond play button what did it do to you I’m still a fan though
So boring video
"That's ONLY the entire population of sweden" -The Hacksmith
I like how he is trying not to cry
if covid was not a thing i would give you a hug
14:20 Case hardened blue gem
Man I cried during this video
I remember when I stumbled upon this channel when it was only at 4M subscribers. Thank you Hacksmith, you’ve inspired me to work more on myself and persevere through anything.  You guys create what people would call impossible, and even if it seems that way you keep persevering and finding a way to make it real.
Thats kinda stupid idea
12:35 is when he starts cutting diamond play button
why did you do this
Yea, I may be just one of the 10.8 million subscribers, but I think I can speak for everybody here - Thank u guys for making our lives a little bit nicer this past 7 years! :) U the best!
make star lord blaster
Hearing his voice break at 4:10 talking just talking about his mentor really shows how close he was with him. Hack if you’re reading this he’s looking down on you with a huge smile.
for the 377 people who disliked, wtf, we lost the one person who like a mentor to him, he works hard to make these devices. 8 months of work just for this light saber. Why do you think it is cool just to dislike the video. He tries too make us happy and change the world. I love you Hacksmith,  keep doing what you do.
No joke that play button at the end looks sick with the rainbow design!!
Hacksmith industries is going to be that worldleading company that rules the world with robots and stuff like that in the future😂 Nah but seriously, you are going to create the next very big company, promises! 💪
I'm a Biomedical Engineering Student and have handled some really sophisticated bionic limbs in my time but I would love to see what you could come up with!
The Holy Magic Dorito!
New sub
Maybe the rest of the button u will melt and put into yours future big project? i mean it would be something amazing if in your own "iron-man suit" took place elements of the button even if it was there only for fun. Big love from Poland, and cant wait for your next videos boss Tony!
I mean this to the bottom of my heart when I say I can't wait to see Hacksmith Industries become a large business that becomes global and helps people. It is so amazing to see all of your and your team's dedication week after week.  I know you are making Grant proud everyday.  I can't wait to watch you guys grow.
9:58 He was holding it upside down. Btw love your videos keep it up
I swear one day this dude is gonna make the world's first working portal gun. And probably before portal 3 comes out too. Like if he can make an actual lightsaber then he can probably make a portal gun one day.
Why didnt you just use real kyber crystals cmon
hi! you helped me develop an interest in STEM. i saw what youve done with the lightsabers, iron man gear ect. and i started to think of math and science classes as something COOL, not a necessary evil. thank you so much!
But why...
Thank you for inspiring all of us future stem creators. Thank you for fueling the future.
Not a real life iron man, the man as pure as gold, gold man
You gotta have a giant pair of balls to cut your diamond play button
If grant was watching this he would be so proud of you and glad to see that he had a good friend.
Stark industries bro your tony stark dog stop denying
Hi hacksmith   Thank you for your channel 😃
imagine if it took this much time to a jedi to cut a door in star wars
Thats a lot of damage
please continue the power loader project
Please ignore all the negative comments, I've been watching you for 7 years now (mind you I am only 15 so that is nearly half of my time here on earth to this point), and throughout those 7 years you just kept amazing me more and more with every new video, I appreciate all the work, time and effort you put into these videos and I'm sure every one of your nearly 11 million fans does as well. My father and I used to watch Grant a lot and we would make all of his simple fun projects, We both were devastated when he was gone but it is very safe to say you give a lot of honor to his name. I'm sure he is very proud of the work you've done. keep it up dude. and enjoy yourself, you've earned it.                 :)
i love u videos,and you and your team are awesome.i have a question is it possible to create a portal gun like in rick and morty
Please say you ordered a second one and that is what you cut in half
You are so inspiring .after I watched your wolverine video I made wood wolverine claws.
They are just jealous my man. Look forward don't let them haters stop you.
It's amazing how much of an impact bad comments have on content creators. As someone who's experienced something similar, let me tell you it seriously drains you of your energy. Imagine what innovators like Hacksmith and friends could achieve if naysayers decided to STFU.
Frsh prince of bel aur is my number 2 favv show
Man i was dying at the cooking show.....................we are always here for you its ok to take a break sometimes but not a long one jk you can take a year and i will still support the channel
The beard it’s legendary
You guys are gonna be HUGE one day I know it🌎. And yes you definitely must use the molten parts for later inventions🔨🔩🔧. Keep being awesome✌💪
Youtube: gives hacksmith diamond play button  Hacksmith: burns it  YouTube:        :(
I just want to say how much you have inspired me. You and a few others really inspired me to use my imagination and make my own things. And that’s why I have been making inventions that I really love. You make a difference for me  and I love watching you’re videos thank you for everything.
I love your videos and always will, Ive been a fan for a while and want you to keep up the great work. <3 Also I think you should try and do a collab with Mark Rober. That would be amazing.
When Hacksmith Industries will be the biggest enterprise ever, i think we'll all say "We where here at the start".
Been here since ‘Flying Like Iron Man #2’ awesome content and congratulations!
Let's have a short minute of silence in remembrance of Grant. He was a huge inspiration for me and even though I didn't know the guy his passing touched me deeply. Rest in peace King.
That looks like something straight outta marvel
Hey man... I really appreciate your work andi love your videos👌👌❤ keep going and I know that you will reach your goals... Say thanks to your awesome team and I really would like to learn on ur campus xD I build PCs and ill start to study electronic engenearing soon xD  so keep goin and be that awesome for ever ❤
I love the fact that he sounds like a Droid
Man I almost cried I look up to you btw I love ur beard it's bootiful
10:40 eazy. no problem at all
I joined you at four mil...
NICE!!!
How can you complain about this guy!! He's a genius!!!
Other youtubers getting the play button: I will treasure the play button for ever The Hacksmith a few weeks after getting the play button: Lets cut it in half!
I am really impressed, I have been following you since the first exoscheleton suite and seeing what you achieved and what you want ti achieve (and im sure you will), i really love you channell keep it up (btw Im an Italian computer science sutudent if you wanna hit me up for your team ;-)
If u skipped dont like this comment

Imagine not liking this beautiful video
Cast a sword from the button!👍👍👍
why do they keep adding cheesy lightsaber sound fx continuously?
Your vids are amazing
Love your vids keep it up
Also side note. Why is it in the past week. I have seen 3 videos with exactly 385 dislikes. HOW AND WHY!?!?! Also. How dare they dislike this video
Tack a break every now and then..not telling you wot to do bit your amazimg....❤
Now we know why you started this YouTube channel... ... ... No, not the giving something back part. You did it because you wanted to cut through the diamond play button!
I remember when y’all were in the garage
This is, incredible. Great job guy's!
Its so stupid to cut it in half you wont get another one
The diamond play button is built different
Damn whoever put bad comments really has no life and cannot see the true genius of Hacksmith Industries.
I was a lazy person before I saw your vids now  I have made remote Door locks for my whole family since they can’t afford new locks remember there’s waaaay more people that love you and your content then people that don’t it also take a real man to pour there heart to millions of people😁
Me:*sees mini buttons for sale* Also Me: "I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK!"
the "history and future of hacksmith industries" part almost made my cry
is it just me or is he starting to look like jesus
14:12 The Damascus Play Button
Keep up the amazing work guys this channel will always light up my day. From the first batman hook video till now it's been amazing to watch the channel grow.
your speech literally made me cry
I love these vids
Love your vids man. I really wish you the best of luck with every future project you have.
build worlds first 10m play button sword?
Hacksmith finally uploaded
Why would you destroy your 10 million subscriber diamond play button
Who else cried while watching this?
Sometimes I think people forget what time man is doing. He’s making our childhood dreams come true... so let’s keep giving him the love he deserves! Keep it up Hacksmith Industries
Noooooooo  why did you do that
We need Boboa Fett
Jack's not going to be happy about this one.
I love your vids and have been watching for 5 years
I’m not crying you’re crying
Go hacksmith 20 million soon hopefully  you are my favorite youtuber
I just realized what people mean when they say '' I've just had an nerdgasm''
This is awsome
Normal youtubers: frame their diamond play button  Hacksmith:hehe
I can't wait to see what things you guys make, keep it up
Wow dude that was a great video. I can't wait to see you complete you're plan
Nice beard
Poor jacksucksatlife
You are a really creative man I Wish to see a full Iron man armor
With the extra playbotton metal you can make a play boutton sord
NGL your love and compassion for what you do and your team and your serious intelligence really gets me going to do what ever I need to or want to every single day. People telling you that you're not good enough will forever be shit. You and your team is fantastic, and you've brought a lot of joy into my life and I assume many others as well. Thank you so much for everything you've done. I hope to see you continue and make your brand and business skyrocket and change our world forever. Much love!
You have done an amazing job.
I hope you achieve all of your goals I really respect you and the Team. You and your team really have changed the youtube world in my opinion keep going that way and I appreciate all of the work of the team. BIG THANKS FROM A GERMAN DUDE.❤❤❤🖖
You’re gonna be the new Elon musk and Apple
May you Rest In Peace grant
Who else is a nerd for star wars
Omg i didnt even know that Grant Thompson passed away. I use to watch his channel all the time. Almost made me cry. Hacksmith industries is literally SOOO COOL. Im so proud of yall.
I don't want to be like Tony I'd rather be like the hacksmith
This is definitely gonna become a trend
Hi Hack Smith I’ve been watching you for ages and if you hear this and you deserve all the support you get
GOOD JOB BRO !!!!! 😂👌👌👍👍🎉🎉👏👏 GOOD JOB FOR 10M
you should melt down all of your play buttons for one big-ish project
Bro you made a piece of SCIENCE FANTASY INTO REALITY. Anyone that has expectations beyond that may as well be ignored
Over the last 2 years, i just wanted to let you know that you have inspired me to be a mechanic. Thank you!
Yum toasty
A joined *hura* for the Hacksmith!
Does anyone else notice from a distance the hacksmith logo looks like captain rex's helmet from star wars? Or is it just me?
Youtube right now: 😐
Is it just me or did anyone else feel bad for the play button?😂 On a serious note,I love what  you guys do and am so proud of what you’ve done so far. I just completed my engineering in computer science and I wish I could be part of this team ♥️ Can’t wait for more epic projects
I watch a LOT of YouTube (probably more than I should), and so many of the channels I watch struggle to stay afloat in this day and age (granted most of them are reviewers, which might explain something). This guy's channel is so successful he could just sit back, upload every once in a while, and just enjoy his success. Instead, what's his mindset? "What else can I do to inspire and help others?" Really admirable man. You are definitely NOT Tony Stark (he took way to long to not be an asshole) your much better than him because you're a real guy who wants to help/inspire others just because you can (A rare thing to find these days). HUGE Thanks to each and every member (past and present) of the Hacksmith team. Can't wait to see what you guys do next.
A blue gem case hardened play button
I only recently discovered the channel and for me it was the "look at that cool lightsaber wow"-reaction, but this made me respect your plans and ambitions to a great degree... No one man has ever done anything extraordinary, from Edison to Einstein, Kennedy to Churchill, Phelps to Messi - they have all been credited by name for their achievements, but every single one of them has become great within their fields because of their work with other people.  On a personal note, that's why I want to work on implementing Agile mindsets in organizations outside Software, since I believe that Agile processes serve to allow people to become their best version, rather than conventional corporate strategies that focus on forcing productivity and only serves to beat workers into some mistaken form of status quo...   I'm glad that people have started seeing opportunities in the world and choose to engage in Innovation and exciting new ways of doing things. Really gives you hope that the world can become a brighter place to live in :)
Case hardened play button
It’s like they improved it, beautiful
plz try to make a auto crossbow and try your best!
Now make a real life death star.
ive watxhed gim fore aeound 3 yeara.....im 12 and his xhanil is amazing
I honestly thought they would make a robot out of it.      But this is better
Yessir 1 billion subs..... One day
What do you mean with maybe wanna create the fact for heroes, you are one your self. Be proud of your self and i always wil be proud of you
man i rally like ur videos i have been watching ur videos dont lesten to other people the are proablably just goelose of u infact make that as a motivation keep going
I cant tell you how long ive been watching this channel and its amazing to see how far hacksmith has come and even crazier of where they will be in 5 to 10 years I love all of you and keep on Making it Real
If your lightsaber cant take on a play button then you are not ready to run into battle with the republic and take down the clankers!
I hope your master plan reaches it's full potential!
WoW 😲 I don’t know what that I hear Woow We will support you so you can make more video. By watching your video I like it
Can you make the proton pack from ghostbusters
when they were burning the play button at one point it turned blue like Minecraft diamonds
YouTube: Congratulations, you just hit 10millon subs heres your diamonds play button.  TheHackSmith: well its free soooo,  Lets destroy it
James, thank you for being honest with all of us. Youtube always seemed like it would dominate the life of any successful creator, and I'm proud of you for thinking beyond that in such a way that you can continue to contribute to those who watch your videos.
12:33 is the lightsaber cutting the play button. Thank me later
I have followed you guys since before 500k. I love your account and the heart to heart was really sweet. Your account is crazy with the stuff you do and your innovation is beyond me. I am so excited I was able to get one of the play buttons! I hope I can stay keep watching for years.
He sounds like he's crying
Hi
Congrats!
But why? why would you do that?
bruh seriously
we need more people like you in the world, people who, are not afraid of being crazy, who are willing to try to go to go further than yourself (I don't know if that makes sense, but I don't know how else to put it), you challenge the world around, you hear is impossible, and you take it for a challenge, you don't let anyone stand in your way, I say to you, continue to be yourself, continue to be bold, and change the world, as we know it, I don't have the money to help you in this, but if I did, I would help, also love your videos
10 million subscribers just got burnt alive 😂
Jesus christ, how long does it take to cut a hole in that thing?!?! The table melted before the playbutton.
283 heartless people disliked this :(
Your Videos are great
Imagine going to galaxies edge and the kids try to fight you
Awesome!!!!!!! 🥳
3 weeks ago he has 10 mil. Now he almost has 11 million. He is big grow
correct me if I'm wrong, but its a bummer that 9.5 million people can't actually buy the milestone limited play button thingy
Hi I'm am 16 years old in December and I've been watching this channel for we'll over 2 years now and you have inspired me to become a builder my first project was a model car I took it apart and made it kind of my own car thank you for the amazing content and for inspiring
the only man to use a lightsaber to cut his diamond playbutton
it has been a long and amazing journey of development and adventure i remember the first video i ever saw,the Iron Man double rockets on each hand,it truly has been a nice journey
Bro this guy is gonna win the lottery and then cut all the money I half with a light saber
Amazing!
Playbuttonium?
E
:( sad playbutton noises
When you realize that the weapons From the Hacksmith are powerfuller then Thema weapons from The U.S Army
Why did you do that
ah yes hacksmith gone nutz. love it though
@jacksucksatlife
Love you’re story mate and you’re Chanel good luck to all of you
i cant believe 378 people have disliked this
Bro i willi like your content
I like your guy's channel because you do everything in your ability to make things as close as possible to the "real one". Some people just dont know how hard you and your team work to make more tech that can help with everyday life and entertainment. I certainly don't know how much you guys work, because I can't do it!  but however much it is, I am very thankful.
So it should be save to say that star wars was speed up by 128 times in order to make the lightsaber cut quick enough, mad respect for acting that slow :0
NOW THATS A LOT OF DAMAGE. FIX IT WITH FLEX TAPE!!!!!
Well done, love this channel. Its like all those silly ideas we had as children but actually making it come true. Well done to you and the team you've built. Surround yourself with good people and you'll only get better ❤️. Keep it real and make sure to take time out for yourselves.
I'm impressed how well the sabre handle is holding up to the constant heat.
Your cool
YouTube: makes and gives this to the hacksmith for a reward  Hacksmith: melts it  YouTube: am I a joke to you?
plz heart this comment
Thank you for every thing you people are doing, keep on the good work !
I really enjoyed all you guys do for us and appreciate it, but make sure not to overwork. With your 80h you work double what I work.
gg good job hacksmith
Awesome as always !!!
Hey I am sorry for a couple years ago and how I handled that. Just wanted to say sorry
The Diamond Play Button actually looks amazing in blue.
That was really cool and encouraging.    Thanks for these awesome videos!!
hey what kind of qualifications would you need to go to this campus?
There will always be haters. There's no one like you guys in the world, don't take them personally
Aruan Felix flashbacks
Your goals are toataly amazing and you will be all that you want to be it just takes hard work, dedication,  and time
Thank you for being so cool and makeing me and others happy thanks
Yooo make the metal from the play button into a Mando helmet it'll be like in the show
What you have achieved and what you succeed for is great. Im excited to see where the channel goes. You should try to do a video with Collin fuze. Hes cool and i think it be great to see a video with you guys and just watch the minds go.
Wait at this part it looks like the arc reactor arc reactor  at 15:15
P.S. I love this channel
You can really tell that he is serious about this plan and it makes me happy that he is and that he isn’t in this for the money or fame
lmao. a brazilian youtuber did it once with his yt button and got SO MUCH backlash. But I guess the lightsaber will prevent that with you guys :v
This video was really heartfelt.  It really sort of shows how unfeeling some of the comments can be.  And how hard it is to manage all of this.  You’ve grown 8 mil since I’ve subbed.  And I’m sure you’ll get more
Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air  In west Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'  I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.  First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmmmmm this might be alright.  But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air  Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared  I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, home to Bel Air'  I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home smell ya later' I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
That blue color is really nice 🤩
Someone could literally write a book with All the spam comments that have been posted  Paraphrased - the Hacksmith
Ok lightsabers are cool but we want those cat girls
Opinions are like assholes, every body has one and they're usually shitty 🙃
YouTube sends the hacksmith 10 Million playbutten   Instant regret
I've been here sense I think before 1 mill
Kill the table
YOU KIDDING ME
But will it cut a human?
2030:  FULL NANOBOT IRONMAN SUIT WITH FLIGHT  But seriously, I have been a long time fan and can’t wait for your future plans!
Wow
Was this the real button???? I couldn’t even fathom doing this if I had a channel with 10 million subs
My manz has a whole life plan and I don’t even have a daily plan
You make everything about being a inventor, mechanic,electrician, etc. amazing I have so much respect for you and your team like Aristotle once said “No great mind has ever existed without a touch of madness”
The college I’m gonna go to: Hacksmith University for Science, Robotics and Engineering
It hurt to see but it felt amazing.
Hey I have been a long time subscriber and I was wondering if I could have the play button part of the play button please
Your company is amazing. Keep going! 😁
My melon died helps me
Hacksmith: gets diamond play button  Also Hacksmith: “LETS CUT IT IN HALF!!”
Thank you 🙏 from everyone 😊
James: you underestimate my power The play button: don’t try it
I hope you will have a good luck in your plan . Thanks for the video!
Actualy we (the world) someday maybe going to talk about Hacksmith industries as we talk about Tesla or Elon Musk at theese days.
you shoul make power armor from fallout 4
he was 'Ent kidding when he said he saw youtube as a stepping stone he literally just burnt one of the greatest  achievements you can get on the internet if not in the world to a crisp
Hacksmith, cut your hair 😂😂
Iv Ben here for 3years
16:04 Diamond playbutton sword??
A man with a big vision, nice
You do you, stop listening to that 1% and start being happy from what the other 99% think of you. You make the world better for a lot of people...some of these things are our childhood dreams that we always wanted and seeing them being built by you just makes me happy. Hope you can make your last step true, good luck Hacksmith!
I hope this makes you feal like your making peoples lifes change it has inspired me to build big projects by myself im getting my freinds to help and i have been building heeps of things but my favorout thing is a idea i kinda getting it from u renember your tazzer pottato well im making a tazzer football . Well i may not have a youtube chanel yet im thinking of making it a hobby and slowly grow it but im waiting till i get a job so i can afford the things i need if you would like can you plz give me an idea for my next project any one thank you.😁🙂😊
The literal nerve that people have to have to watch your videos, looking at all of your hard work and progress, and comment how the lightsaber hilt is too long
I've been a fan for  like 4 years
I’ve been a viewer for about 5 months now and the stuff you do is revolutionary the lightsaber is easily the coolest representation of a lightsaber ever.
Cheers to you guys !!!!
Cooking with hacksmith was hilarious!
This is neat watching him from becoming a small YouTuber making stuff in his Garage to becoming a big industrie.
Me ENCANTAN los videos y todos los proyectos. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Gracias Hacksmith Industries   Saludos desde Colombia 🇨🇴 (:
Your video are always so amazing
Man I love this channel... congrats 10 million subs
Why
You are going to be a legend dude. I will meet you one day and discuss ideas because we are men of science and that's what we do 💡
Youtube: We want to sent you a play button to congrats on you reaching 10 million milestone  Hacksmith: Haha button goes brrrrrr
Tony would be proud
The pepole that skip are pepole that not care about the channel they care only about that you cut the diamond play botton   Good video
may Grant rest in peace i didnt know until u mentioned it and i googled it a few minutes ago. grant was a great man. may he rest in peace
jacksucksatlife is sad rn
ARUAN FELIX AMERICAN
The play button looked so cool when it was getting cut, I love the purple and orange and especially the blue.
Hey keep it up man, I’m glad you and your team keep us happy with all your creativity, thank you:)!!
Can you make the blaster of Optimus Prime
Question, can you get an additional button from Youtube? I feel like there could be more chances with new projects to destroy the button XD
Hacksmith: melts diamond play button  Gold play button: I'm in danger
I watched your videos for a long time and it was really cool to see a story here in Brazil telling what you did to me it was amazing that you became famous even in other countries XD
Lot of love from Ethiopia
Hacksmith is not a place Its of people
Hop to you the best for your master plan .😁
This is just “breathtaking”
Get this man a medal for his his hard work  Edit: his medal was the play button
I love how both you and my engineering teacher say: "I think this will be kinda cool".
Jacksucksatlife is typing
11:10 beautiful
This is a very cool video and I want to beable to make all of this sweet stuff
Imagine this guys electric bill
You should shave LOL
Belive it or not  but he still hearts comments theses day. Which means he truly loves his fans. That is why I subcribed to him and like almost all of his videos. Keep up the good work James. Also I like you new channel name (HACKSMITH INDUSTRIES ).
Hey man I don’t really have a lot to say but I just wanted to say thank you for all you do man thank you
The question is why ??? you had to do this to the play button  i don't understand why to get the play button cutted ????
I watched the whole video all of it is so true I have been watching your videos for two  years and you inspire me I make a lot of cardboard stuff and homemade Nerf guns thank you for all the work you do
Congrats on 10 million subs btw
The amazing business behind Hacksmith Industries. ( not the hacksmith anymore )
you like cheese
You have a real kyber crys5al
I actually have fate that the hacksmith will grow higher then elon musk
God this channel is so dope
Bro I love the videos but pleeeeease get a trim
Me in 2050: goes to Walmart, sees fully functional iron man flight suit     Damn. They made it, they achieved their life goal.
So 4 years from now when I graduate from university... Wanna help me start an electric sports car and pickup truck company? 😂
These guys have nothing to do with their lives
I’m so happy for you and what you have achieved. Amazing job and keep up the amazing content.
We all miss grant. We feel your sadness when it comes to him
bro u guys are insane this is like a groundbreaking human history milestone much love keep it up bro
The madman did it...
Hey man, great test! You can try making a plasma based iron man repulsors, like, a plasma blast that can travel, you can try it!  Plus: COME ON MAN, IF THERE IS SOMEONE DESERVING OF PRIDE, ITS YOU! I love your videos, and im one of those many people you have inspired, and want to grow up to be an engineer like you, and to be a cricketer, and you have given me hope, by telling the troubles you went through, nothing comes without hard work, and you have worked a lot to get here, amazing job! P.s: When I'm older, im coming to meet ya!! ROAD TO VICTORY, JAMES!!!!!
@HacksmithIndustries could you maybe try make a beyblade that real move where you want if you think or move to the left the bey go to the left that would be awesome
Sweden gang
If I could move to Canada my dream would be to design and build stuff with you guys.
Tears... literal tears. dont take those comments who dont have anything good to say. you. are. amazing.
I'm not sure if they have ever been able to collaborate with ILM or not, but could you imagine if they eventually use this technology for practical effect lightsabers? Obviously it would only work in certain cases, with some visual editing. But imagine what would be possible with these guys and ILM together.
Porque choras, Aruan??
When he started to talk about grant i fr started tearing upp
Why would you not destroy the golden play button with it?
JackSucksAtLife is mad
Hacksmith: justs gets diamond play button Also Hacksmith: lests cut it in half with a lightsaber Me: but you can only get 1 per channel and they are rare
You do the right things the right way. That's what makes you admireable
my favorite video was zarias gun from overwatch and i have to say i love all of your vids
What happened to the king of random
You made me a maker mad lad and its in the good way everything i look at i see something i can make with that can help achieve victory  So i think i can say from anybody you guys are the best and thank you for everything ♡
Wanting to build cool shit like this is the only thing keeping me motivated to get my bachelors in mechanical engineering.
DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON DAGGER OOR SWORD THAT WOULD BE EPIC
I’ve been with this channel since you first attempted the Exo. You are a gods bless with technology and even if that 1% talks badly about you then just remember that for that one person being negative, there are millions more that are positive.
13:39 is it just me or does this look cooler than pewds 100mil play button
Love you and the team, keep doing what you’re doing man🤩🤩
I feel like if you really want to take a break you deserve it, cause you deserve it!
Yo oh are my favorite YouTubeer and I think that you deserve this
Youtube: CONGRATULATIONS!! YOU HIT 10.000.000 SUBSCRIBERS!! 😁 (We wonder what you are gonna do with it. Maybe safe it, or maybe show it every video in the background) Hacksmith:
You Look like jesus
50 years from now your gonna be selling. Iron man suits, Captain Americas shields and every movie prop in the world. Can't wait to see it!
I'm loving it! ❤
If I had one wish... it would be to make the doom guys grapple shotgun but well done guys it’s a great effort to get to 10mil and the videos you guys you don’t need to keep it up you’ve made a lot of great work and I’m sure your old videos would keep you in business keep it up 👍you guys are awsome.
Just to let you guys know, every type of play button is able to buy as many times as you want, so don’t worry lol.
The hacksmith: I've been waiting for MONTHS to get this diamond play button  Also the hacksmith: lightsaber vs. diamond play button, who will win?
I won’t be one of the people who try and claim they have been watching your videos since day one. I’ve only been watching for a few years, and considering how long you’ve been at it that’s not a very long time. But even in this short time I’ve been a fan of your channel you have expanded your company and fan base so much. You and your accomplices have done so much together already ,and I know that Hacksmith Industries is destined to do even more.
F for the play botton!
2050: “I partnered with Elon Musk to create the first transformer”
W-why why would you do such a thing
the playbutton recipe is just perfect
They're still getting through!!
Me: I feel you bro I took weekly video classes for communications. Hacksmith: I know Everyone: Make daily vlogs!
Petition for them to make another on of their own but with an arc reactor at the centre
Love you man. We all miss Grant. Take the lessons he gave you seriously. Take your time and do you man.
Next project real lazer blaster Then ai robots Boom clone wars
Congratulations!
I’m 1 hour early
You should combine the lite saber with the Iron man sute and btw keep up the good work and don’t let people get you down
I’ve been watching for nearly 5years and to see your growth is amazing and were came from congrats!
7:44 I can’t wait to see all of the people at Hacksmith Industries in 60 years testing the first ever hyperdrive    Edit: time stamp error
If they made a engineering school, I would definitely go to their school
When you make a business, can I buy a lightsaber? 🤣
James is THE Hacksmith.  But his team are Hacksmiths too.   And these videos are inspiring the next generation of Hacksmiths.   No Man Rules Alone. An invention dynasty has it's leader, and that's him. Then he has his team, the group of people he's cultivated around himself that work so well together.   And then there is us, the community, the people. We watch and get inspired, some of us to take our own path and sometimes dream of working in his team. No matter what the basics is inspiration. Inspiring the next generation of engineers.   And if not, just entertaining the fans to make their day a little bit brighter.   We all wish to see your plan successful. Here's to you and your team's success 🥂
Love how he says “Dash of lemon” so non-chalant..
I honestly see Hacksmith industries as one of the worlds big names in 10 years. You guys are awsome! Love to see what you're going to acomplish during my lifetime.
I watch since a mill love ur vids man
Mandalorian armor ?
Cast the melted play button metal into another play button
Don't read the comments. But if you read this one, thank you for the cool videos <3

Awesome I enjoy your videos don't worry about the negative side do your own thing
13:47
Hacksmith r u ok?
I cried when I saw Grant
You are a inspiration. If you work with elon  musk  you guys could  change the world for the better.
Keep going man you are the best person on YouTube and I think it is stupid for anyone to criticise you and your videos👌😜
He justed made a diamond orange thats siiiiiiick
Have you guys ever thought about building a BattleBot and compete on the tv series Battlebots? I know you guys got alot going on but it'd be cool to see you guys on tv.
I guess that’s your custom Playbutton
Why do people leave negative comments to destroy a YouTube people love
Did you get a new one
A moment of silence for the playbutton
I love ur videos, I hope after I finish my mechatronic engineering course, or during the course, I can be part of the internship as you have inspired me to strive for the future and my passion, so thanks
I’ve been a subscriber for a longe time, the first video I saw of yours was the  one with the Batman grappling rope. I come from Luxembourg, and I just finished ordering the mini play button, I know it isn’t much but I hope it helps, I fully support your projects, and your teams and I love how we can clearly see how much you love your team ! I really hope that all your projects and wishes become reality !🙏🏼
May someday try to make Nero arm from Devil May Cry 4 🤩
The table broke before the play button!
Next Idea, Metal Mandalorian Armor
The Hacksmith sounds a lot like Captain America
Don't Compare your self to fictional characters like tony stark, for you are better, you are real.
i cried during this
I subbed in 2014 and its been a hell of a six years keep up the great content
Your the best youtuber
Awsome video guys!
MAKE DOUBLE SIDED ONE
This was actually super awesome
Do you think the lightsaber would work underwater?
James, you need a haircut.
Well done  and nice video
I nominate you to be Canada's Tony Stark!
your welcome
Im so happy for you  Also can you do black panter claws
You're the best you're videos are awesome 👍, and te video was pretty fun ❤️
Thanks for everything man and your team love your video
I'm a 38 year old man on the east coast of the United States with a background in high stress customer service, social media and some editing both audio and visual. If you ever want to put someone at the front door who loves what you do. I'm your guy. Just point me in the direction.
Hacksmith industries could change the world by what they do like working together as a community. and anyone reading this can do the same. That’s why we are here on Earth to make a difference. # love you hack smith industries
Woah... that’s deep
Don’t worry, just fix it up with some flex tape.
hacksmith is probably the only person I would watch talk about their master plan
I mean is the play buttons value doubled or halved?
I can tell by his beard he is doing another marvel character for make it real
Going to Sweden, brb!
When you were talking about your team it nearly made me cry, I'm so proud of how far you've come I can't wait for what's in store for Hacksmith Industries. Thanks for everything you've done for your community.
Right when I was bored :)
I think you've managed to accomplish something amazing with this channel, and I have no doubt you'll continue to make an impact on the world! And can I just say, the imagery of a diamond play button lightsabered in half made my day lmao
Is that thing made of real diamond or something???
I love your shit man. Keep doing what you're doing!
Pls Don’t change into Youtubers like dude perfect and ignore their fans  Actually scratch that I know you won’t
Do you use any steroids ?
You can hear the pain in his voice when talking about his friend :(
make a hover tank from star wars   like so the hacksmith  sees also the hack smith is going to make reality starwars in a couple years
Congrats on 10 millions🥳🥳 We’re going for 50 mil next!
Ill always support you
I challenge you to make a plasma based blaster
I support you 100% of the way. Life is short, enjoy it
Your melted playbutton needs a plaque that reads "Proof that the real Tony Stark has a Lightsaber."
dude this made me shed a tear
I am so sorry that you’re friend passed away.
what is that play button really made it from  how it can stand against that lightsaber so long?
Hacksmith: gets anything from anybody Also Hacksmith: Alright, let's cut it in half with our lightsaber
You Guys Are Amazing Dude you and your team is one of the best youtubers just ignore the 1% Haters  you guys made movie sci fi into reality and more mind blowing stuff The Future we See in movies Starts from people like you and your team  Thankyou For all the hard work and giving nerds like me dreams for a better future
I my soul is like happy but my mind is like just just why
More subs than deji
I've only seen 3 of his video but this make feel like I've been a fan for years
Now i am sad bc now u dont have an Diamond play bottom 😭:(
You buy a butten and do to him this or its your really one?
The way the play button turned to like this blue case-hardened color looked sick!
When the Hacksmith said he was going to start a cooking show, I was ready lolololololol.
Youtube: sends Diamond Play Button.  The Hacksmith: Lets melt it!  Youtube: :|
What is the school thing you mentioned I'm interested?
Somewere on some hacksmith industrys computer there is a file that only has lightsaber noises
This is so inspiring 🥺 i wish i could come work for you. Learn from you. 🥺 Hit me up i am really ready to work my ass off 🥺 I'll do anything to learn and explore.  More power to you king 👑
amazing, been subbed since around 400k and seeing you at your deserved 10mil is insane.
Keep it up, no matter what the trolls say.
Hi, im 15 from israel, I love your videos, you inspire people to do goog things and in my opinion changing the world, you are funny, nice and smart, I really think that you’re a great men. Anyway, thank you for creating this YouTube channel. Keep doing what you do.
Just met ricky berwick at the mall your next LOL.  one day.  keep up the good work and don't worry about that 1% that would complain if you gave them a million dollars
Are you going to do this till 100 years old
massive respect bro
respect James
I can hear it in his voice and it makes me even sadder watching this 😭😭😭 what a journey...
Someone send this to JackSucksAtLife
I challenge you to make one of does really professional microscopes that you could buy on Amazon
If we can get more contained heat it could possibly be a solid blade. If it is contained we could also get more heat.
wow nice vid :D!!!!!! btw did he sacrifice his diamond play button?????????????????????
You guys are a very inspiring team and have opened a new door to technology and most of all, you guys create the best content on youtube. Thank You So Much!
You are a great Youtuber
I honestly like your beard
I have always wished to be able to get a play button as a artist & you just sliced yours
I miss Grant so much.
chłopie ogolił byś się
Hi
Well done guys, keep it coming. And I guess a meager 75h a week or so would be enough as well.
This comment proves I was part of his fanbase before he becomes a remarkable
You should shave some of your beard with the lightsaber
make black panthers claws
even if you didn't upload every week, I'd still watch
GOD BLESS YOU
Bro you have inspired me so much to start taking machining classes at me school and I’m really enjoying them. One day I hope I can come and have an internship with with you guys once I turn 18. Love what you guys do hope y’all have a blessed day!
I wish hack smith was a college

"A Goal without a plan is just a wish" - Love your long term planning and your determination. Hope you will achieve all your achievable goals, learn from your non-achievable ones and entertain us while finding out which is which.
You know have u ever thought  cooking with binging with babish
I don’t normally like Star Wars but even I can say that this is so cool!!!
youtube who sent him the play button: BRUH
You are now aware of how things work on youtube. I strongly recommend that you start branching out to alternative social medias. Rumble, bitchute, LBRY, Brighteon. I'm hacksmith for life. You guys are insane and i would love to see more indepth stuff. You're a self made man. You're changing the world.
YouTube when it sees this video: 😮🤭
I can't "Like" this enough. Team-building is extremely important, especially if you want to meet even a small fraction of the expectations from your viewers. I have watched Hacksmith Industries grow pretty much from the beginning, and I am extremely impressed with how far it's come, and how it's grown. You guys are a true inspiration. Keep up the awesome work (at your own pace)!
Wait the reel king of random died
Excited for the Alex lab colab
You guys are just so talented. A couple years ago I stumbled upon your channel and have been watching every video since then. And lately I’ve been thinking about my career and because of you guys, I want to become a mechanical engineer and maybe do the things that you do.
but why? why would you do that?
You are an amazing person you deserve all that you have. keep it up ✌
This was amazing
I am crying inside that he cut something that is so hard to get
Make a school
14:27 now that's a Blue Gem diamond play button for all your subs that play CSGO
It's not a lightsaber It's not even a blade
Do you think your team would ever look to create medical technology? I really admire your master plan
Your amazing, all of your projects seem to wor amazingly smooth and thats because of you! You are behind all of this and I really hope all of us know that.
respect.
Love for grant!
Hey mmm you know when you hit 10 mil Subs you Can buy extra play buttuns
Wow amazing and IT is not good destroyer the YouTube daimond buton
“I JUST SAWED THIS BUTTON IN HALF”

thank god you can buy a replacement plaqe
How to transfer energy to a diamond by Tony Stark
I'm 18 and a senior in a private medical academy which I'll graduate as a pharmacy technician. Hacksmith has given me the inspiration to pursue a career in engineering, regardless of my med degree. Mark my words Hacksmith, I'll be a major in mechanical engineering and start my own company. Life is too short too not do the things you love. Thx Hacksmith for making fictional props into a reality.for me to enjoy watching!
great goals, incredibly impressive
Been here since 10k baby  I remember when y’all were makin the Batman grappling hook gun
You should melt the play button down, and make a sword with the glass piece in the hilt, and in the blade( made from the play button metal) etch your name into it and 10mil, I think that would be a cool project
Love your content! Try and make two videos a month. One for an update and the results.
If the hacksmith becomes an international business I'd want to work there
Damascus playbutton
12:22
The wait just makes it better ngl and this is just amazing that you expanded and just grew this channel! Making these gadgets and inventions were considered impossible but then you guys just made the CGI into reality like, Holy cow! It’s just really amazing and I congratulate you for getting 10 Mil and you deserve more, but hey, I ain’t more than 10 million people anyways, this is just really amazing and I hope you will get even better in the future! And thank you for aspiring me to become an engineer at least, that is what I hope to become. Thank you
Ur so inspiring and I hope ur vision gets fufilled
Who is a og and remembers when he was in a small garage I love your videos and your content so please be making more
JackSucksAtLife is crying right now
too much pepper
I don’t regret not skipping forward (:
Congratulations Hacksmith Industries on 10 million subscribers! You earned that Diamond Play Button (and the privileges of attempting to lightsaber it...)
Dont stop!  It might seem ridiculous, but I actually think you guys can make a LIGHT lightsaber if you dont end this series.
Hacksmith: finally get their well deserved play button Also the Hacksmith: LETS BURN IT
Matt Stonie wants to know your location.
I live in Sweden and we’re just 10 million dam
Hi
I think you dont see this comment. But i think 10 years later you can do a real star fighter
I can’t believe you actually cut it in half!   Try making dearth maul’s lightsaber keep up the good work
It would be a dream to work with someone like you cause my goal has been to make a real life mjolnir armor (from halo) the talos armor was closest too it. I have no paper saying I can do it but I've been working on manufacturing and doing mechanic work since I was 7. Anyway keep up the inspirational work guys
Stattrack Gamma Doppler Diamond Play Buttom
Also so a diamond play button is stronger than titanium
We all love and appreciate you, and everyone else on the channel, and are so excited to see all of the amazing things you’ll do in the future!!!
You can use tiny bit of the button i every future projekt
Watching this video got me choked up. I can feel the passion in your words. My daughter (6) and I watch every video you upload and even got the kiwi crate last year because of your suggestions. We love the bonding and fun of it. Thank you so much for putting out such awesome Content.
Youtuber: hits massive landmark  Also youtuber: yesssss finally The Hacksmith: lets cut it in half.
Was that the real play button, I beg that it wasn’t 😂
They be milking this thing for a while.
I couldn’t concentrate during the serious bits because of his glorious beard and hair
I you cool
You truly are the greatest channel on YouTube and I hope u make it to number 1 someday!!!
Whatever you do, we will always be behind you :)
You Can Buy a new oringinal from creator awards!
if you're going to use the melted metal for a future project, I recommend looking into the mandalorian. so you can use the precious metal like he did
Why why
I am so glad that you have gotten to 10,000,000 sub's and I am very glad that you have these great goal's. Hacksmith Industries, you have my respect, and I can't wait to see what you guys accomplish in the future.
Man I almost cried when you started talking about Grant and how he escaped from the pressure. Please feel free to take a break James! You may build super hero gadgets but I guess we can all agree that you are still human ;)
I've always loved seeing your vids its so inspiring and as a kid who loves cosplay I love these make it real videos  And so to put it simple I've always wanted to do things but I can't right now but you make me want to try thank you
Congratulation 👏👏👏
He’s the real life iron man even if he says he isnt
That took way longer to melt and break than I expected, whats that thing made of?
I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😘
Same
Dude you have a straight lions mane and i love it
If you combine the 2 light saber Technologies using a colapsable hollow rod that is only heat resistant, the outward force pushing out of the plasma based saber should (theoretically) extend the rod so that it had something to hit with, like an extendable cane for blind people,                    Tl;DR drag from the plasma  saber   Can extend a stick hidden by the outward push from the flames, no controlls needed. *hint hint*
You should melt the hole play button and make a 10mill light saber or something along those lines
Epic
This is inspirational AF I love this channel and everything y’all done I’ve been a fan for a while good job on everything you’ve done! Love the channel great job and we appreciate all the commitment and turning all our favorite child hood fiction gadgets and weapons into reality love it love y’all! Great job!
Congratulations guys on this big milestone. Hope to see all the great things you guys come up with in the future.
Love your videos
<3
Hey does Hack industries sell something rn
This channel is going to become Wakanda, except everyone knows about it. This channel is impacting millions of people's lives and has inspired so many. Thank you for being a great channel, Hacksmith Industries. You are by far, the best channel I've ever been on and I'm glad I'm a part of the community
wow
Suggestion use that for captain's sheild or iron man
NOT COOL at all destroying that play button. Whats the point. You dont respect utube or what?
I’m so glad that you make videos and if you want to take a brake I will be here when you want to come back and that speech was beautiful that you had at the start of the video
Omg, I love this so much <3. I watched you guys since the captain America project and all I can say it's that I hope one day I can work at HACKSMITH Industries.
You guys are so amazing. You started with those little projects and look how big it became!
Flex Tape
My grandson in 2080: look! I got a lightsaber for Christmas! All the cool kids at school have them! Me: no way! Where is it from? Him: Hacksmith Industries of course
Bro.  Lightsaber looks sick.  I was wandering tho if you made the exit place for the blade thinner would the blade be longer? Just asking
Anyways, that being said, only 33% of you guys are subscribed so I would really appreciate it if you guys would SMASH that subscribe button!
Oh my God, your beard is crazy xD
James I applaud both your vision and your ambition, and most of all for your humility and self-awareness to know that you can't (and shouldn't) try to do everything yourself and that any truly worthwhile project takes a group of people working together.  I can't wait to see what you and your team accomplish.
This is butiful u did it u crazy hero u did it 🥲🥲🥲
Mr beast played games and got 10mil you made crazy vids and  you got 10mil so that's not fair
What was it made out of?
I watch all your vids as soon as possible and is always the best part of my week!
I love this channel at it got me thinking about going in to engineering
I don't think that you will ever see this but i am an old subscriber there where some projects that i wanted to see them go further or that i would do them otherwise but you have inspired me, changed the way i see my future,changed what i want to do for a leaving i used to be a kid that was fulling him self that he would become a famous footballer but you helped me see the fun exiting part of science right now i am doing parkour and studying so that i have the opportunity to doy studies in a good college hope we one day work together on a project
If you’re here for the lightsaber cutting the play button here 10:14
I hope that the Hacksmith stays so I can join the Hacksmith and work there
We will always support you guys ❤️
James’s plans are literally what I am planning lmao 😂
Imagine if the video was just the first 20 secs, and the moment he touched the button, it explodes?
If this video doesn't deserve an like Idk what does.
Maybe Youtube sent you a special diamond button with a Kyber cristal to complete your lightsaber
Thank you very much for inspiring me to achieve more. I am thinking about aerospace engineering or planetary science as a career. And you’re helping me believe that it is possible and inspiring me to work hard. Thank you so much.
"So I wanna do a little heart to heart" and tell you about todays sponsor RAID SHADOW LEGENDS.  Man it is so amazing how far you have come. Thanks for all the amazing videos. I cant wait for what's to come.
i am with you hacksmith

Missed opportunity to call the channel 'The Hacksmithy'
how do people not like this? how are there negative comments?
Hi hacksmith  I want your opinion on my build that was inspired by you and is it a servo controlled exoskeleton triggered by muscles sensors for me, do you think it is a good idea?
Like om ni är svenne för han mobbade vårt land typ

Hey James, just remember it’s a leap of faith remember that. Love you man
I am his old fan I have watched all his video. His project are great bruh

Only Channel With Balls of Steel
Hacksmith industries, you guys are just AMAZING keep going, keep creating, we will keep loving you guys
I am his old fan I have watched all his video. His project are great bruh
My Tip to the 1% which says you can do this better if you do this and that   Just ignore this idiots because they wouldn’t even get close to that what you and your team do.  This kinda people it would give ever on the World   I don’t know this Channel for to long but just don’t Care about them and make what you wanted to do.  Nobody is perfect  (I hope there where not to much spelling mistakes)
you're the best
Finally,  I get to say" I watched this 10m subscribers channel before it even got to the first million, yes I know it all😎" man I feel like it is an achievement that I am a subscriber and a fan of this channel since pretty much ever. Maybe one day I will be part of it🤔?
He is a true super hero of today's world
Love your vision for the company, love the Master Plan, love the team, love Hacksmith Industries
I wish I had the motivation that you have to work towards a goal like this. Furthermore, I wish I had your knowledge and expertise. I'd love to inspire the world in the same way that you do through all these projects!
YouTube ;<
We like your videos Hacksmith @Hacksmith Industries
Am late yes no
Wow what a speech touching
He IS the real-life Tony Stark: he started out alone, but after realizing he couldn't do it at on his own, he built a team that would complement eachother... The Hacksmith Industries IS our Avengers
Maybe melt the whole play bouton and make a new one.
2080: Hacksmith: I have made my own portal gun
man, this future sounds like something I wanna work to help build.
You guys are amazing and each new video gets better and better and each video I get more and more inspired by you guys, you've done so much for the community and for the world of YouTube I hope one day I could create something amazing just like you guys. Thank you so much for everything you guys have done
Those of you who don’t want to hear him talk for 12 mins. You can fast forward to 12:32
It does looks much more like the hacksmith now 😂
If superheroes exist in the future dont that mean superVILANS will too
If someone did this to my SILVER play button, i would litterally cry for days
Only those who didnt skip to 12:22 and watched the whole vid are worthy of liking this
You know what the heck with the haters and do the things you want no have to do make what you want to make but you know what you should do 1year long protect and to keep the income alive with playing with your "toys" and do a grand revival and I doubt you will ever read this but I really respect you.
Steve: i fear no man, but that thing Hacksmith:*cutting diamond in half* Steve: it scares me
13:10 I can smell that
Jacksucksatlife knows he can just buy another :)
Congratulations on     10  million
WAIT WHAT????
YouTube be like are you serious!!!!!
YouTube: 10 million subscribers play button Hack smith: let’s cut it in half The guy who made the play button : My dissappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
Give away
This is great don’t care about what those mean people say they just want to be mean and have nothing else to do
10 MILL BOIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Id like to place a 100 dollar bid on the molten pieces of the play button if you don't mind.
I is love how he painted being known by tons of people. I like how he didn’t make it seem like all sunshine and rainbows.  James you are my role model!
If you want a replacement diamond playbutton you can buy one now that you have 10 million subscribers, it also hurts me and amazes me at the same time to see you melt an award that I wish I had in half
Not what I expected at all. I thought that play button would be plastic or hollow thin metal. I can't believe you got through that thick chunk of metal!
Yay! Good job at ten million!
I love you so much you’re my favorite YouTube
YouTube: Let’s give the hacksmith the diamond play button. The Hacksmith: let’s cut it in half with a lightsaber.
Won’t consider it a lightsaber till you don’t need a cord
who else watched the whole video?
Aruan is proud of you. Only the brazilians will know about this one
No offense guys but your insane this might destroy the diamond 💎 play button
I hope one day i can be part of the Hacksmith team.
I’ve been watching since you were on the Daily Planet and love your vids
Really are it free? Because i dont have money and i like engerine stuff
You are ordering a new one to have a mint condition one right.. hahaha oooohhhh
You guys should make multiple channels based on your inventions. Like, hacksmith cooking where you making inventions that help cooking. Hacksmith furniture, where you make cool pieces of furniture. You get the idea
It's crazy how u read all the comments  Lots of respect for what u do
Omg ur such a great content creator
he isn’t the real life tony stark. He is The Hacksmith
YouTube now regrets giving them that 😂😂😂😂
Engineering with ❤️, many thanks, friends!
Why would people give you negative comments when you are like the best youtuber?
what a good dude
the plating be like the evolution of a silver iron man to holo foil
Man I wish I could get one of those mini Diamond playbutton but I can’t afford it
Hacksmith Industries is like the BoringCompany, but less boring 😜
I hope at some point in the future you guys make an even better lightsaber
Where are the Jacksuscksatlife fans
jacksucksatlife would love this
Make thors hammer out of the playbutten metal
If Jack Massy Welsh saw this he would cry
Coking whit hacksmith :D!!!!!!!!!!!!!

One day when I'm a adult I'm going to show my kids this video and say "this is the way u do thing this is how you become successful
Shout out to every single person in hacksmith industries, all of you are making dreams become a reality. Thank you and keep up the incredible work :)

To proove the power of flaxtape, I melted this play button in half!
the hacksmith is literally sacrificing the diamond playbutton for us. LEGEND!
Why?
15:18 it kind of looks like a burning soul stone
Damascus Play button!
Hi
One day the hacksmith will be hired by elon musk

This is a truly incredible video.

♥️
So inspiring 🤩🤩🤩
: )
You should use the part inside of the play button as a tony stark heart
I've always loved your videos it's cool to see this crazy cool stuff real 👍😁
Wish I had a diamond play button to melt
It hurts so much to see you ruin it
You know what really , really , really sets the Hacksmith's destruction apart from other Youtubers ? They cherish and honour the damage.  You make us Canadians so proud.
you guys are the best people in the world and i look up to you guys
watching your videos has helped me out a lot, thank you
Will u buy a new one?
I’m happy I found your channel with the original exoskeleton video. So much quality entertainment over the past couple years!
Jó, de azért elmehetnél fodrászhoz.

Sooo you telling me you kidnapped evan kale to work with you??? It's just a theory... yeah since he appeared here there are no videos

Love you James

Awesome........ nothing else to say except wow
hacksmith aka James Ramsey
I wont stop watching hacksmith industries until I'm dead the real youtubers I've been watching my whole life will stay with me and I wait for a video to come out so I can whatch it immediately
Double blades lightsaber next?
other YouTubers not even touching their diamond ay button.               Hacksmith Industries:
Can someone hire this guy for the AdMech on Mars?. I challenge you to make a functioning Bolter or/and a Power Armour.
But lowkey...this dude might launch the world into the sci fi age of existence
STILL cant believe how far you have come, the light-saber is amazing
All your videos have inspired me to be a more creative person. I don't understand anyone that could ever dislike your videos. When you started talking about grant, I saw your lips quiver, and then it started happening to me. I think that what your doing for the community is an awesome thing that you do. I will always watch your channel no matter how traversal it gets. Stay frosty.🥺
man when he mentioned Grant Thompson...😥
Know if you open a museum that play button will be called the first lightsaber cut play button
Ok no need to make me cry like that...
YouTube: 10 million subscriber play button Hack smith: let’s burn it
I miss Grant and when you mentioned him it made me sad and happy at the same time
All’s I need to know is how much can I buy that button for?
Did anyone else almost start crying when he talked about Grant😭😭😭
I just noticed after he said that, that he changed the channel name to hacksmith industries
It looks like he has a lion mane
Don’t tell JacksSucksAtLife about this
That Diamond play bitton it's damn hard
Wow incroyable je te soutiens à fond !
I’m just waiting for the day hacksmith industries become a team of superheroes
the people that disliked this video why what the f### man

Someone needs to send this video to jacksucksatlife
Fits you
You guys are great and I hope you’ll continue making videos! Also, is the powerloader getting lonely?
The world is changing faster than the speed of light
What happened to the james bond car?
Hell no
😟 ... Tbh the grant Thompson part got me I've been his fan for years and he's the reason i got into science 😔R.I.P grant  You could feel he was being honest in this video. you could hear the sincerity in his voice .. i definitely loved it
I love your videos 😍♥️
i was here when you build the exo skeleton and now i am here watching a video of you guys destroying a diamond play button ..............how time flies
If I am honest that bleu play button should be a thing
osum:)

You're a awesome dude, keep going!
Lightsaber vs Diamond Play Button!
Hello from germany, u deserve all of that and i wish u just the best to reach ur goals ur a great person with a great team
The mask made him sound like a Battle Droid
He is like the son of Hephaestus
I’ve been a fan before 1 m
Probably my favorite thing about hack smith industries is that normal engineering company’s could make this stuff but the hack smith makes suff to also look cool witch can be hard cause fantasy isn’t bound by normal physics  but they pull it off
You should make a molten play button metal hilt for the lightsaber
Soon the lightsabers will be militarized
if anyone speaks shit about you i will melt them
Nice

Only your team would do this.  Congrats on your milestone.  You should make a tiny play button or batarang out of the molten metal. 😆
This is one of the best videos I have ever seen on youtube. You build with passion and fun, and the products made from them are so exciting and incredible, which is very unique on this website. I love it! Keep it up, Hacksmith!
I love how he went from doc strange to off brand (avengers game) tony stark
Finished my degree in mechanical engineering, I hope one day to work with you! :)
We’re here for u bud

Dude you awesome
My dude lookin like a lumberjack
Hi!
Love your master plan i would love to learn how you got your first master plan done
Hey, I know you probably won't read this, and that I'll get lost in the mass. But I wanted to tell you that you're a great human. You're one of my heroes, someone who I aspire to be like.  You've made my dreams come true, you've made me realize that I can push further and further. But this video, it's very important. I know a lot of YouTubers get a lot of negative comments and I personally know they hit way harder than positive stuff. But I know that everyone in this community will stand beside me when I say that we love what you, what your company does. We enjoy every single video, every single employee. You all are great people, not just James. We love you guys and feel free to take a break whenever you feel like it ❤️
2:16 classic Canadian
This channel has helped me choose what I wanted for my electives for highschool and made me select one and wanna do even more and work to be as great as them in my own way and hell even hopefully work their some day like internship and just do something where even if it has been done before, it sounds cheesy but im surr lots of people especially people here have the same kdeas as me and can't wait to for videos of him at 80 years old cutting his moon rock playbutton in half with a even more real lightsaber
This video makes me mad but only because your destroy a DIAMOND YOUTUBE PLAY BUTTON. the video is overall really good but like, why destroy that?😂
This is why you can't give them something nice
Bro, wat u r doing is only the beginning
I think you are one of the greatest people to ever exist. You will always be remembered (don't take this badly) you took me through some of my darkest times, keep up the good work 😃
Its just so sad that I can go to learn engineering in this campus
Every day he looks more and more homeless
This got me in the feels
Thank you for all those years of inovation and I love your plans for the future. In 2 years I want to start studying engineering, because of your Channel and when I am done it would be just so cool to could work in the Hacksmith Industries Campus. I hope you can build it, but please also take breaks to recover. I'm a bit worried, because you look a bit tired and not really okay, so please, please watch your health :)
What is that thing made of?
My dream is to work at hacksmith industries
yall 1% are mean i think he is amazing
The haters are really sucking my narss
I love this Chantal
dam i wish i skipped to him cutting the diamond this white dude made me cry
Lol
youtube laughing because there not sending another one.
he is making me cry. keep up the good work.
Wait- so your telling me you got a diamond play button and one of your first thoughts was to try to cut it in half? Your insane in the best way possible. Edit: Jokes aside, it’s a very noble goal to use YouTube as a stepping stone to try and help people all over the world, starting with the common worker. I think you’ll make a big difference, so thank you for that.
Hacksmith 10 years later We built the infinity gauntlet and now can shift reality
You should make spider man web shooter and you can swing part 2
I doesnt Matter If there is a Video a week or Not. It doesnt Matter If you dont Work in every single Project. You Always build insane Projects, No Matter If they Work or Not. Its interesting to See you and your Team  building them. Its inspiration for a Lot people. What i wanna say is, Thank you for the awesome Videos you make and Entertainment you give to us. You do what is fun for you and that is what counts. I Hope you Always have fun on what you are doing.
I almost cried during that talk I love you James 😄
This is amazing🤩 would be awesome to see if you could melt thw whole playbutton and make it into one of the future projects or weapons🤩🤩
Wait on the spider man ps4 trailer he said no pressure right
Now this is what I call Lazarbeam’s ‘dum sh-t science’
DEAR GOD MAN! YOUR INSANE!!!!!
Damn I miss Grant. Made me cry when I saw him in this vid. 😭😭
The old bell labs building over the US, the places are huge try shopping for those
I wish I had the money to support this channel, and to bring it further
Cutsnto my self feeling like shiz because I asked for something in the lighsaber video
Well now you have the most unique diamond play button ever
Cool
Lately i’ve been thinking this channel has gotten a little worse in some ways than it was one or two years ago. I have changed my mind. You have just gotten better, all of you.
YouTube: Here you go, you've earned it. 👈😎  Hacksmith: Thanks! *Lightsaber Noise*  YouTube: NOoOOOoOoOo
Where is the patreon link
Thank you. Everyone at Hacksmith Industries. You guys are the best. You guys are a huge inspiration to me and everyone who watches. Keep up the great work! Love you guys.
The holo playbutton
Next up I cut my house in half with a lightsaber
Im glad to know you and you guys think about the future. It's good knowing you have a great plan for a potentially greater future
I bet James will still be making videos when he is dead.
Beautiful
Hacksmith’s final video:    Creates full Iron Man Suit
(First of all this comment is positive so no one get mad) I have one problem wit you plan      I wish it could be completed sooner
The Play button looked kinda cool when it turned blue ngl
"bring a group of remarkable people together to see if we can be something more" sounds like the avengers to me, plot twist he is Nick Fury
Once you said you read every comment that made me realize you care more then most, so let me take a few seconds of time to say thank you, bringing joy and fun into a platform is something you do so well. You inspire people around the world and you've even become a household name! Thank you for doing all the things that make you an amazing person. I'll stay tuned to the future, I'm looking forward to seeing your plans help many people.
I love everything you and your team have put out can't wait to see more
case hardened playbutton
With that mask on you totally sound like those droids from Star Wars that say “Roger roger”
Love u boo <3
You my friend are one of the few people who helped me out of my depression. You are my and lots of people's idol an inspiration. You went from nothing to so much and were always humble positive and so God damn entertaining. Fuck the people who criticize you you are a genius they are jealous simple. Please don't you ever let them drag your or your team down. I' ve been here for years and I honestly haven't wished for anybody else to get the diamond than you. Remember you are doing so much good so much for me and everybody watching. Don't let them drag you down the real fans will understand and stand behind you no matter what.
You are truelly an amazing person are you are not like other you tubers as you not out for the money you are expecting and employing others I respect that and keep going
The hacksmith 2034: building the atat from Star Wars
I think James' voice kinda kinda became shaky there lots of love man u r literally becoming my real life superhero day by day year by year its almost like a dream come true love frm India nd I gotta say tht glass glowing nd the button is looking soo beautiful nd I don't think everybody gets to melt and cut a diamond play button in hslf man only happens in hacksmith industries
took what we gave him and destroyed it....
hacksmith industries im waiting for mandolorian gear
Bruh i just realised halo uses plasma guns for the aliens, i always wondered if anybody would make like a plasma rifle
He can be the next captain America
James, thank you so much for that. You have inspired me to think of cool things to make and build and I look forward to your vidoes every week. God has good things in store for you guys and good luck in the future.
Hacksmith, if you see this         That will be cool
If you gonna reuse the metal make a diamond sword out of a diamond playbutton lmao
Was it just me or did hacksmith industries’ channel icon look like a deformed clone trooper 😂
“Watched the whole history lesson” gang
So what you are saying is that we should make all our walls out of play buttons?
this video made JackSucksAtLife cry
Facts about the comment thing. Was not expecting a reply on an 11 year old video lmao. Amazing connection to the community, glad I could be apart of it for almost half my life at this point
Why are you destroying this bro🙄😪
In 50 years time I am going to look back at this channel and see what a massive journey it has gone on. To a wacky, weird and exiting future.
Are you going to cut your beard down a little
It truly does look better than a regular play button, I'll give you that.
If you guys provide local maker spaces you could literally be the next geek group. I think Chris Boden will be absolutely smitten. :D I love the concept and I hope you succeed in your mission.
youtube: sends diamond play button 🙂  hacksmith: let's cut it with a lightsaber! 😁  youtube: 😐
It's not a lightsaber, because it's got a cord it's a protosaber
And then Charli damilio is over here dancing and this man worked hard for YEARS to get where he is.
I am only one of 10.8M subscribers, but I'd just like to say how much I love this channel. I love James, Ian and the rest of the team, the projects, the editing, the channels honesty and ethics. I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this.  I'll no doubt enjoy commenting on the inevitable video when your phase two business plan is complete and you're changing lives, and no doubt I'll still be chilling on the sofa x
We not only love you but love your whole team please try to ignore those haters ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I don't think Youtube will send a 15 million button after seeing this video
The people complaining are just jealous little kids just ignore them
What do you mean stark isn't real😮 isn't Elon Musk stark😂😞  Seriously , love your videos and I can't complain about anything and the stuff I think you "may" do different I do different cause you're the inspiration for my project 😊 as other youtubers I watch.
Clicked for the lightsaber. Stayed for that incredible speech. Well done Hacksmith industries.
Can I join the channel
If you dislike the vid, you a simp
His kid will be him BUT 10 TIMES BETER
James you can you try to make Oliver Queens bow I think that would be Dope
Youtube clearly isn't messing around with these play buttons.
I’m still having trouble knowing that lightsabers are real now it’s crazy to think so good job
Youtube employees rn: 👁 👄 👁
Great video loved the plan to take over the world        Did anyone else think he looks like a secret love child of iron man and wolverine? It’s cool
i love that this channel has more subs than new zealands population
jack would be so mad
15:02 Electric Play Button for 500M subs be like
This video is a bit cluckbait
Hiiiii big fan
Iron man glove and helmet... genius in technology and inventing... hacksmith industries... nailed it mr.stark...
youtube is gonna stop sending play buttons cause people just do this
10 year old me hitting my mums plates
12:40 -> 15:44 Wow, and i thought that the Playbuttons are made of the worst plastic, that thing is more heat resistent than the frickin tungsten!
The part where he is explaining the company is more interesting than the cutting of the play button. You got some good writers 👌👌
Your videos are amazing and your builds are amazing
This is awesome i have been watching since the start.
Good man. Respect✊🏼
I’m happy for you and I hope you don’t turn to the Sith
This video is deep, I really liked man thanks for your amazing content
YouTube: congratulations on your hard work! Here’s a diamond play button  Hacksmith: *melts it*  YouTube: I- god damnit those things are expensive
That cooking with Hacksmith was Hilarious
I’m more concerned for the play button.. will he get sent another?
Hey I know is not a super hero but can you do Wall-E I think is a good project because he can do many things and is a robot for cleaning the world so I like a super hero 😊
I started watching you when you had 1 mill subs, and I have to say, i am am so proud of you and what you and your team has achived. I love watching you guys and i really do apprichiate what you have done for us. Thank you!
gg
I think it would be super cool if you made a working 3d Maneuver gear from attack on titan.
💚 this channel so much. I remember that 100k sub video. I can't wait to see the 100M video. 🤘
YouTube: Here is a play button for your hard work! Hacksmith: Thanks, we are going to cut it in half YouTube: *soft weeping*
don't worry I got it  love will smith
are you crazy hack smith burning all you work right in front of your eye

12:69 WHYD U PLAY THE GRAND MOFF TARKIN THEME edit i meant 12:59
I loved Grant so much, smart, funny and made us discover a lot of funnier things. You do good too ! Keep on the good work, you rock !
True supporters of your channel know how much work you put into it and, I'm almost certain that they also don't need you to justify any of your choice. You and your team are doing such an amazing and inspiring work ! Bringing dreams and ideas to reality is only what we see but what we can't see is that everything is possible when you work hard and believe in yourself
What would happen if you clashed 2 lightsabers together?
Please make a full iron man suit
The feeling in the explanation is fantastic.
I really enjoyed this video and I think you can make a difference in the world and I hope to do things like you do when im older
Everyone else: let's sell this diamond for billions of dollars that couldn't be made in a century  HackSmith: let's cut in this billion dollar diamond than half for a video
Don't you wanna make a(n) RC starfighter from star wars? :D
Playbutton sword
But why?
Jacksucksatlife: cries in the corner
Hey Guys, Im from Germany and im following you for over 2 Years now. I think you're the most inspiring person in the World. Keep on doing your great projects and do more Star Wars Stuff, I am a great Star Wars Fan. Greatings from Germany and best wishes for your next Plans! The Janski
I am so relieved!! I thought you would destroy the Play button completely😨🤪. But it looks so much cooler now😎
You need a hair cut 😂😂(I'm not roasting you)
Honestly u deserve more subscribers and support than u earn
I honestly feel like you're beards representative of your power, and I'm afraid it's becoming too powerful, especially when you regularly set yourself on fire. I mean, what happens when you become fire proof, that's not exactly something you could hide in this channel, and then what, does the Canadian government do experiments? Well regardless, congratulations on 10 million!
I did not expect that to look so cool. Really symbolic that you took this already amazing thing and made it your own
you are crazy - that won't work !!!  ;) keep on making things work that "won't work"
The Hacksmith: That's why the channel is now called "Hacksmith Industries".  Me: *Scrolls down 👁👄👁
so in a wayy..... your master plan is basically phases like the mcu
You guys made me want to start making stuff for the military
Make another lightsaber to duel
5:15 🧍‍♂️
No
Can someone explain to me how people still disliked this video? How? How can you not like one of the best channels on the entire platform? What is going through your head when you acknowledge the thousands of hours him and his team put into these videos and STLL go out of your way to show everyone that you don't like the video?
14:34 Sapphire Play button for 150M subs be like
Yo that blue looks so nice
Storm trooper blaster next?
Don't you think it will be awsome if he make is on iron man flying suit with the gravity jet pack
The first time you told us I thought you were kidding us, WHY THE HACK. I. DO THIS, you just cut through my eyes with a lightsaber!!!
Youtube be like BRUH
I would love to see the play button used in future projects! Keep up the awesome work!
🥱
I wanna see a realistic bulletproof Iron Man suit and especially a working jetpack or like a way to fly. Yeah I know they exist atm, but those are funded by themselves. I feel like with all your supporters you can make a flying suit possible decades from now.
You are not afraid that for such experiments YouTube will not send you any button
Omg this is amazing wish I could have internship but I only in year 10
This man and his team are insane! I don't care b if he isn't doing all the work
doh!
my man got a blue gem case hardened playbutton
Hacksmith Industries you should make your own play button out of all your play buttons (mind go BOOM)  ps- or just out of the diamond one
Man mentioning grant made me tear up but my guy thank you for your content and glad to ba a part of it
Good on you mate
Ill be honest, this made me tear up a bit
3:44 you Can hear the pain in his voice when he mentions Grant.
Keep going on what you want guys!! Your are awesome as tema!!
Hi. Your haters didn't release how hard is make even simple metal thing. I love your content. Keep being awesome!!!
How much money would you say hacksmith industries costs now?
"A Dash of lemon!"  *Squeezes all the juices from a lemon with 1 hand*   "Perfect!"
Hacksmith: History and roasting their play button Me: Sweden has a population of 10 mil?
Who won the giveaway?
As a small business owner who is about to begin building a content creation path in his business and realizing I may have to start handing off my passion to others, a team,  thank you. And I greatly respect this video and its message. The lightsaber brought me in, this message will make me stay. Forget the haters, I know what it takes to do what you're doing, its harder than most of those people could even comprehend. You are evolving. Oh and, seriously, take breaks! Work to live, don't live to work.
Thanks dude! This video made my day/week/month/year/decade/century/millenium/billionenium(?) so much better. Looking foreward to seeing the research campus and all the wonderful stuff to come. 🌞
Congrats on 10 mil subscribers. You deserve it. love your stuff. keep doing what you're doing.
"We spent 8 months building that thing and destilled it then into one 18 minute video... And we need to do this every week!!!" - Godzilla had a stroke hearing that
You did really inspire me hacksmith I want to be just like you when I grow up
Jacksucksatlife has entered the chat
Such a awesome speech
Thank you for inspiring me to start building things such as mountain bikes and forts and I made a cardboard iron man suit thanks to you👍
I love you hacksmith this is so cool and crazy
The Hacksmith Industries  Wow unbelievable man good job
Much love you can do anything you put your mind to.
It would be so cool if you used something like what you used for the kick flip board to stop roll over accidents 🤷
Love your and your teams vids!<3
You got rid of you diamond button wow
The "heat treated" diamond playbutton LOOKS SICK
Beautiful speech. Thats really all I have to say. Go one like this, Hacksmith Industries
Me: normal brain  Hacksmith: brain level GALAXY
So does that mean I'll get to buy a real lightsaber soon
Amazing video
What I wouldn’t give to work at hacksmith industries
its one of my childhood dreams come to life it is so heartwarming to see the lightsaber in action  it brought a small tear to my eye
blue case hardened play button
Should be lightsaber vs another lightsaber!
Evacuate the city, engage all defences and get this man a play button
How do I become good on youtube
(-_-) noice
Love your vids, keep it up
Youtube isn't gonna give out fiamond play buttons after seeing this
I love your video
Hacksmith is gonna be the real life version of Buy N Large from Wall-e
You are just amazing! I really hope your dreams will come true!
Why just *WHY*
Don't listen to that 1% focus on the 99% we speak just as loud. It's just how the internet is. When you get too successful people will start hating on you because you made it big. People like that just can't accept change. Keep up the good work regardless <3
Hi from Spain :-)
I am one of the ten million from Sweden 🇸🇪👍
how do you stay so fit?? if you have time only for us and the awesome vidoes you make
You should try combining this light saber and the old one but make the old one retractable so you can colour the flame
well... you guys definitely have the most unique diamond play button now
Jacksucksatlife wants to know your location
Nobody  YouTube: Look how they massacred my boy
Your job is my dream job, wish i could and had the money to do stuff like you :)
*happy noises*
He should melt down the play button and make a diamond play button sword or something
Im honestly exicted in how big Hacksmith Indostries gona become in 20 years
I love you
why??
When I saw this title all I could think was why would you destroy your accomplishments.
the play button is very hacksmith
this was very cool
Hacksmith = best YouTuber
you do good man
would you guys stop editing lightsaber sounds over the lightsaber i want to know what it sounds like in person
Other YouTubers: Yes my play button! I sure hope it doesn't get scratched.   The Hacksmith: Ok time to try and destroy this thing
Is it just me or does the lighsabered diamond play button cooler than a regular one?
Who elso doesn't want to cut his 10 million playbutton in half. But I have to say it looks pretty nice
11:15 HE REALLY JUST SQUEEZED THE LEMON WITH HIS BARE HANDS AND DIDN'T EVEN CUT IT JUST POPPED IT LIKE A WATER BALLOON  JESUS
YouTube watching 👁💧👄💧👁
Hacksmith is the new what's inside
The glowing button reminds me of the scene where Tony makes the new element
we love you james!
Rest in peace Grant...   A very heart warming video, good job James.
Will the hacksmith become oden at the end ? He grew out his beard he is almost there
Yo
Look all those people that complain about all of the amazing work your doing don't let it put you down just know your doing a good thing
That’s the great thing about inventions… You take whatever everyone says it will not work and find a way to do it against all odds. :)
n-n-n-n-n-NOOO wait that's actually quite cool
Spoken like a true entrepreneur
I know your really into making things from comics movies and videos games but you and your team could make actual useful stuff think about it
been here for 3 years 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
That was amazing! Keep it up dude
Someone said he will cut it lol.
Youtube: we gotta make the play button stronger
It’s weird hearing James say “sometimes we do things just for shits and giggles” with such a sincere tone
*Cant wait for the ruby play button*
hacksmith if you reading this men go to sleep or something
Or maybe a play button samurai sword. Maybe a side project?
Play button strong lightsaber stronger
The idea for a reasearch campus is fucken dope,  keep going
It still amazes me that this is a thing
Welcome back to hack inside. I’m James, this is Bogdan. Today we’re gonna be hacking inside the diamond play button.
You can hear in his voice that he put soo much efort into makeing it this far, and the idea to make the world a better place, its so inspireing... sorry for bad english😂 You are gonna make ur dreams come true!
:)
What the hell is that thing made of?
dang, I can't believe your already at 10 mil subs! that is so cool, I remember when I first subscribed and you only had just over 1 million. Awesome job keep it up
So bloody proud of you and the team James, you've collectively introduced multiple generations to STEM... I am 45 years old and it's only through watching your videos that I have come to want to learn about engineering, electronics and design.  I'm 45 and the last 2 years I have for the first time in my life owned power tools, not just a drill (but yes my first drill in 45 years!) but a belt sander, 3d printer, soldering iron, even a heat gun for wire shrink tubing.   I now own an Arduino, am working in CAD programs and am doing building projects... that is because of YOU and your team.   I'm just one of millions that you and your channel have reached, educated and motivated to explore STEM.  Keep doing you, bringing this wonderful world to the masses, but also BE you, rest when you need to, you have a great team, if you need a rest, we are more than happy for them to lead a video or three, they're all talented and entertaining.  Here's to 25M subs!!!!
Thousand degree play button
This company about save us from human extinction
How to get views do anything with diamond play button, ans also you can order a new play button if you want to have one that looks normal
Aruan felix from usa
"So yeah, that's the plan. I hope you like it.  If not that's okay: it's my plan, not yours." - that was awesome
I don’t know how many people will get this, but tech you tubers like the hack smith, Collin furze, and such always make me thing the WoD society of ether is real, and when he mentioned wanting to send a ripple through the world about what’s possible I got chills.
Love ur vid
Hacksmith, You have made my days bright and cheerful. Don't listen to them. You are doing awesome and you set me to tears with that story about your friend. May he rest in peace. Thank you for making my day bright and cheerful.
Jack's so not gonna like this
this is wholesome
Video idea you should make a Percy Jackson retractable shield
You figured it out. You have ascended - congratulations!  _Not sarcasm, very happy for you and your team!_
That is a really tuff play button
Guys, remember that they're just some guys duking around in a garage. Imagine if they had proper resources and Bill Gate's budget.
HackSmith 2024
Don’t tell jack
This by far has been your best speech. I like your plan and can’t wait to purchase a functional iron man mask.
Me skipping to 12 minutes. "I'm so sorry man"
saving you 12 minutes: 12:40
Don't let the haters there just jealous you an amazing person
Show this to JackSucksAtLife.
Wow! I figured those play buttons were just symbolic & made out of plastic & glass. That thing was tough 🤔
Damn... The Grant Thompson eulogy still gets to me, he would’ve been proud of you James, and of course of HackSmith industries, congratulations brother💪🏻
Some of the best words I've ever heard It really pulled at my heart strings and very inspiring too
Hello
Long story short he wants to rule the world
But it didn't cut it in half within a split second...  Keep up work, James and team, you may yet get there.
B)
Why the heck would you cut one of the most monumental items you can ever get     Great video tho
Your speech was pretty heart touching. Good to see this side of you and your team as well. Wish you the best in the upcoming years!
I love you guys so much and just want to say you guys are doing a amazing job keep going

James: "we actually managed to cut our play button in half!" Phil Swift's voice from the distance: "THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE!"
Dude keep yo head up. I love your channel and it’s sad to see people complain about your channel. You have done so much for me to start looking at the smaller but now I guess bigger creators.   Stay golden
Best video of 2020
Funnily enough, I wasn't looking forward to the cutting it in half part!   This makes me so happy. You worked so hard and deserved it! You have inspired me and so many other people do do things we now love! Thank you for everything you have done for us and will do for us. Freeplay

Ah nah mate, I think you're doing great. I am just hyped with the light saber improving ngl I enjoyed it ever since then I subbed like way back because I know one day you will create a light saber that's actually retractable with a push of a button.   Thanks hack smith for making real content that no other youtuber can, thanks hacksmith for a big wild rollercoaster and your welcome for the awards that we helped you earn by subscribing and supporting you. <3
nooooooo my lifetime goal and dream
Everyone: I’m gonna save my diamond button like a trophy  Hacksmith: I’m gonna destroy it
Good job, be strong👊🏻
BBro, I relly like ur videos. Im ur bigest fan from Romania ;)))) Pls like my comment 🙃😉
This has made me so excited for the future of hack smith industries
Hacksmith,  In case you’re reading this (and I have faith you are) I have a few things.  1) Do come to Utah more often 😎  2) When you do make superheroes a reality, note that I call dibs on Spider-Man  3) if you’re reading this far, your videos are super awesome and my sibling and I all rush to the computer to watch it waaayyy too many times. Thank you for everything ✌️
James: Got the legendary play button James: Destroys it a week later.
That's so good that you pushed 10 mill!!!! I hope ya grow even MORE!!!!!! Love your channel!!!
I can hear the pain in your voice. And that is totally fine. I know how it feels. Just continue with the things that make you happy. If you need a break, do it! You're a human! Even if the break is gonna be longer for some of us, the real fans are going to understand you. Don't live a life with a lot of years. Live those years with a lot of life! Thank you and goodnight.
I probably commented once saying that you are so huge now that you don't even work on projects but now that I see what its like I understand. you also responded to me saying you work even more than you ever did that moment I completely understood. im grateful to be able to watch this channel and for you and the whole team to be in it.
This is why we cant have good things. But great job, really enjoy your content.
Hacksmith: TEN million subs! Me: looks at the sub count Actually no 10.8 subs
I would watch cooking with the Jack Smith all the time
You are the reason I started building when I was 7
Also good idea, with exoskeleton thing if you make one or enough and sell it to emergency services like fire fighters could make rescues a lot faster. 🤔 for real though all these projects could make some decent money with emergency services.
How are people gonna criticize your projects when they can’t even build it themselves😂👎🏾 stay in your lane and don’t be criticizing my mans hacksmith smh.
Mr Smith. Pls remember 10million people love u all the ogs always watch your vids even if u dont make what we want. Tell that 1% to leave u alone if they dislike u. Making someone feelbad does not drive them any further. 😘😘😘😘😘😁😁😁😁😁😎😎😎
hacksmith you should make the pen sword(the sword is called riptide it is an expandable sword that comes out of a pen) from percy jackson the lightning thief
Love your vids
"And maybe just maybe a future where superheroes exist" well james look in a mirror coz u are my and a lot of other people's hero we love you James
14:58 How to make an infinity stone
You are definitely the most supportive person on the whole internet. You truely are a HERO!!!
I think you should try to build the last prism from terraria
YouTube: sends hack smith a diamond play button  Hacksmith: "Today, Were going to try to cut our play button in half!"
or like making a unbreakable box and breaking it with the hacksmith weapons
ligit
*yet to finish* Wait, who complains that you don't feel the need to push yourself into everything? That seems silly. What's the point of having an entire team of talented people if you then hog the spotlight and don't let them do their job? I can't readily name a single person that's spearheaded a project and its videos that wasn't fun in some way. Hopefully I can just be a part of the feedback that we do actually enjoy the fact that we see you work as a team, not as a celebrity and the people that do all the job for no recognition.
Did u buy another one from YouTube?
when i started watching you i didnt want to do anything with math but you inspired me to want to become an engineer i am 16 and i am already taking AP physics 2 thank you so much
Imagine a Hacksmith Comunity Channel for everyone, who wants to share their Ideas and projekts

Congratulations, please make a functional Rorchach mask, that would be epic, keep the good work
Press f for the diamond play button
who says you not being involved in every build is a bad thing?? exploring creativity of everyone is how you'll grow the most. Clearly some people don't think ahead or realistically.
Make a baby yoda or the fire blaster on the mandalorian arm
u should shave
blast
"So naturally, we're gonna see what happens when we try to cut it in half." Naturally. I love this channel.
8:14 this guys about to get age restricted
Ok when you said you changed the channel name I checked ..... I don't know why  Edit: you should make a play button that can have an orange button in the centre ... It look cool
I like that rainbow roasted play button. But also let have a moment of silence for the diamond play button and pray that it will have a good life🙏🏻
Im so happy you are a greatest youtuber your videos inspired me to build stuff like your projects and you inspired me to become an engener
Youtube after seeing this vid: ... We were going to ask for a picture of it compared to the others but nevermind.
Just incradeable work! I remember when I foud your chanel and was totally amazed. Back the just 100k subscribes.

Ommmgf
Arua2.0
Is it just me or did he sound like a droid with that mask on?
Is it me or does James beard look like a lion’s mane? He’s the Hacksmithing King.
I guess we now know what to make Lightsaber resistant armor out of.  Congratulations on being the first youtubers to get the rainbow playbutton.
This is so epic. You inspired me to start at Engineering, and choosing my current school.  💪🇳🇱
He man Mybe you can start a serie that while teach engineering
You know what, my dudes...there is nothing wrong with taking things at your own pace. You guys are human, and you deserve to live a human life. In the great words of Charlie Chaplin:  Don't give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men!
Last video cut's safe in have to obtain play button is careful not to damage this video: LETS CUT THE PLAY BUTTON IN HALF!
Still waiting for that gundam
This is the saddest coolest video ever
No mather what you will do or how much you will try there will be always some ppl hating🤷🏻‍♂️
Forget what the nay sayers are worried about man. You've been great since the beginning. Keep being you and doing what makes you YOU and keep growing at your pace.
get mark rober if that is how to spell his name. but he is very smart and he has his own youtube channel so ask him he mite except your invitation he also worked on a rover. from 11 year old Rylen : )
I really belive you guys
i wasnt here from the very start but i have been here for a while ive u guys progress through the years ive enjoyed seeing u have fun i will continue to watch and wish u good luck in the futures god speed hacksmith industries
First rainbow play button
I’ve recently taken engineering and computing as an option (England) because I e always liked technology over people you inspire me to keep going with my dream just like you did I want to help society by finding an escape from earth that we have killed off. Then I want destabilise the earth I know it’s a very big dream but I will try because why tf not
Honestly, it sounds like he’s on the verge of tears, I am too
Honestly, all that I can give to the channel is respect, you guys are amazing, and I hope that dream you all have it's not so far. Thank you for all your videos
bruh why did he slice it!?
Don't give up I support you.
The only thing i can say is WTF
YouTube be like: what the hell is going on????
Next time make the doctor octopus arms from spiderman
Ever one how skipped ahead “to short not good”
It looked like an arc reactor when the button was lightning up 15:10
We support you!
When Hasksmith industries goes public         INVEST! $$$
One big fu to youtube lol
Noice
This is literally my favorite channel on YouTube
all the amazing things u made on this channel and countless hundreds of hours u put into this u should be cutting a ruby play btton in half
James: is about to cut though  Grammarly: I THINK NOT!
Honestly, I only found your channel 2 weeks ago. But I write stories in my free time. Photon beam project helped me to find a realistic way to write a futuristic rifle using a photon beam rather than the much more unrealistic particle beam. I love watching your videos because it shows just how far science has come from the beginning of time.
Looking forward to the future.
This is deep the part where you are saying your plan
That play button looked so cool! Thank you for making all of this amazing content!! So does this mean you plan to build a trade school? That would be awesome!
You were always my inspiration bcs im as creative as you so i wish we could change the world creators are big creators willl probably save the world and also i love your every single video every single project and as soon i am going to bee 20 i will apply for a job in hacksmith industries and come to canada from europe-slovene Thanks for making me hapy whenever you post😃 good job and have a nice and long life🙃👍 everyone be happy

Diamond PlayButton From Minecraft Bro
Bruh i am from sweden
Hacksmith Industries, the ones who will eventually make skynet on accident 🤣❤️. Great shit though. Ever think you would maybe make a thing where people would be able to come tryout or see projects in person? That would be cool and could also help the business. Thats after all this covid stuff.
Aye take a break mate it’s no prob
Im Swedish and you have as many subscribers as we have people in our country. Thats insane!
Yes! You did it !!!!!!!!! )))))))))
Lol but i think of it some times that like pewdiepie have sweden 10 times
people who dislike have no life
im not trying to be mean but you guy are kinda dumb doing this but its still cool
Change title to how to make a Red Diamond Play Button
14:14 Is that the red diamond play button
Damascus camo
Does anyone else like how the play button looks with the brown gold in the middle?
So question.  Would using a better fuel increase the heat of the lightsaber?  Such as using jet engine fuel?
what does the diamond play button look no cap good?!!
When your such a good YouTuber you can to experiments on a diamond play button
Oh boy am I glad i didnt skip forward!
Bro, When The Diamond Play Button was blue. IT WAS SO COOL
HACKSMITH UNIVERSITY????
This took a lot longer time than a real lightsaber would but I guess you need mediclorians for that
Is it possible to make a swiss army knife but for a mechanic/ engineering with a screwdriver, hammer, adjustable spanner and more but looks like a normal swiss army knife?
Bonjour du Manitoba
when you rule the world I can tell my grandchildren about how I used to watch you on youtube.
I'm an oh subscriber  love your videos
That was actually so cool but WHY WOULD YOU RUIN THAT MASTER PIECE
10:47 SWEDÄÄÄN
Very touching. You guys are great. You make us proud every video and i hope you guys keep on growing.
Im not joking when eh said upside down my phone made thw screen upside down😂
Your plan is so crazy .... and so brilliant. Keep it up!
You deserve everything you have got. You inspired me to make things and you inspire over 10 million people around the world.  Thank you for what you do
YouTube: StOp HaCkSmItH yOu CaNt JuSt MeLt OuR dIaMoNd...  HackSmith: Ha ha plasma lightsaber go melty melty
my man gonna look like old luke soon, really worthy of wielding that saber.
Hi ik your busy but could you make a stormtrooper blaster
"The plasma lightsaber video pushed the channel over 10 million subscribers"  *checks sub count* Over 10.8 million now, probably be within touching distance of 11 million soon...
You should do something with FIRST Robotics
Absolutely beautiful
I dont remember but i am a subscriber from a long long timee.
Hi Hacksmith, keep doing what you're doing an inspiring the new generation to be like you! From an astrophysicist fan in the UK!
why
dude upload monthly we love you enough that we wont mind
You will be the first person I visit if I win the lotto. I'm currently doing metalwork in school and when Im out, if your looking for someone to help with projects, I'm available
hacksmith, i have a idea! you guys should try making a prostetics like arms and legs to be able to help more people!
Could you make a video were you doing things that everybody does daily, but than with hacksmith projects (slicing bread with the fortnite slicer, opening doors with a lightsaber, etc)
No....not the diamond play button
I love your channel and I want to work for you!!! Can I have an internship?
keep it up. I have ben watching since 2010. keep it up
Coolest Channel on youtube!!!! Definitely the most work per video compared to others! I hope you will do something else cool with the Mini cyber truck, That was such an awesome and well-designed project.
Is this how to bacic?
2045: Making a full Transformer that transformers with you inside if it. And wonderful video my man, I have been watching your content for a long time and it is AMAZING. This video made me tear up a little...
i"ve bin sub tile the first woverine claws

I was gonna go play Mc but I saw this and i was like, na mc can wait. This is something I cant wait for  I also liked how the play button looked like when it was cut
what 10 year old's think working at a gas station really is like:
i wonder what will happen when hack-smith builds every pop culture related machine and weapon, do they sell them?
Dude your almost at 11M already 😂😁
I honestly loved your videos and I have been watching a long time and have been inspired by your amazing skills at building these amazing products and I just wanted to say I'm very happy you are liking what you are doing and willing to continue doing it! Love from Australia 🇦🇺
This video made me so happy can't wait to see where you are in 5 years y'all have inspired a lot of people 👍
I always love when you hack smith it up with a cooking show
That was deep
That was a very moving speech man! So how can I come work with you guys? Need any electrician's
You guys remember when he just hit 1 mil? Those were the days.
When you realise the diamond play button is actually made of diamonds
WAIT GRANT DIED?! WHAT HAPPENED I HAD NO IDEA I LOVE HIS VIDEOS ;-; rest in piece
7:36 ayee this looks like the warehouse that mythbusters used sometimes :) for example their starwars special, but with allot less structural equipment, and updated.  i could be very wrong though
Tony stark making starkium
Damm i wished i had a job in hacksmith industries
Looked like a corrupted play button or something near the middle there
This is so interesting
I love watching your videos and I hope you can achieve your team's and your dreams, and I know you can change this world. And I want you guys to keep up the good work, and one of these days take a week off cause you guys need it for all the hard work.
I appriciate you and your team for the good work you are doing
You shouldnt listen to those haters let them just cry they are just jelous that they cant do what you can. They think they can get everything  in a snap. Stay possitive and happy 10 mil subs. <3 :)
#12:22

Gey

good Video
"It isn't all sunshine and robots" quote of the decade!
_“Wow, we got a Diamond Play-Button! This is the height of YouTubing-achievements!”_ _“Yeah!”_ _“...”_ _“...”_ _“We’re gonna chop it in half, aren’t we?”_ _“Absolutely.”_
I almost cried. Thank's
Make a Proton Pack from Ghostbusters!
bet you 25$ hacksmith wont say my name "AntiGucci"
James aka hacksmith industry ceo I’ve been a fan for a good 4 years and I’ve been inspired a lot by the inventions you do I’m 16 and am already looking into the future and share many of the same goals you wanna use to help better the world I’m looking forward to a good college for stem and maybe find a way to build prosthetics and make others lives better thank you for so much that you do not for just us as the hacksmith community but as a plantation to want to grow and do more...you’ve been a good inspiration and I pray and know you always will I believe in your goal and I know if anyone can achieve it you can...so go about your master plan and hopefully one day in the future I may be able to help make the dream you had a reality for the better future yours truly C.J
Are people really out here expecting 1 dude to be so prodigal as an engineer and work so much faster with tech week on week that he doesn't need a team? 1 person cannot be expected to know everything, not even Einstein, Newton, Da Vinci, etc, not even all the famous genius' and polymaths in history could know all this. The fact he understands he's limited as a human and needs more people with other expertese should be embraced and supported! He and his team have done things many of us thought fiction, stop chastising him because his amazing items weren't done alone. Hell, not even Tony Stark does his best work alone.
Just remember the 99% :)
Oooooo 38 minutes after upload without being subscribed
The stuff about Grant made me kinda start to tear-up.
Im sorry but pls shave and get a haircut miss thr old u
Why are you happy
Make a snitch from harry potter that can Identify you using artificial intelligence.

Did graned tombstone die 🥺
very cool
14:16  Advertisment: New Rainbow Diamond Play Button At 1B Subscribers  *With EXOTIC Flames*  Pewdiepie and Tseries: new race?
I remember whem he had 1 mil
you are doing good. love watching your vids. you made my day with that speech.
Wouldn't it be funny if YouTube knew he would try this and sent him one made of out something he couldn't melt lol
10/10 I would totally join you/work for you for free or at least a small wage and help you however I could. I would love to help you however I can (but I am still a kid(kinda)). I love your work so much as your the person who is making new things to change the world. I would love to see you guys make a more compact battery/taking the tesla car battery and minimize it. If you can do that, you can get all the money you want. And then,  come the spaceships :D  I think the only downside to this is that I'm not Canadian which means I can't really work for you as I'm not local.
Why he crying like a bitch can’t take insults???
you're designs are genius and i can tell this channel has a bright future I know you guys will succeed
Plz keep the cooking segment
Me: i bet you can't eat you diamond playbutton The hacksmith: 10:24
Congrat for 10 mill
youtube watching this : 😑
This is the best Chanel ever
You guys should definitely make a play button sword with the metal from the inside. But only if it’s legal in Canada
As an aspring Physicist, what you guys do encourages me to seek out and do the impossible. Thanks so very much.
Only people who didn’t skip the first part of the the video can like
That is way cooler than what I thought it will be
You forgot mustard on the play button it takes out the gameness of it
James, could you build electromagnetic hover shoes that could make you hover? Also If you were to make a ferrofluid engine would be nonresistant and work faster than a normal engine with normal oil? Last, could you make a plasma sword? But wait for one more thing. is there any way to manipulate a magnetic field so when you making a lightsaber you won't need to use laminar flow this time?
You're not Tony Stark, you're Charles Xavier. You've assembled a group of extraordinary people with extraordinary abilities to achieve great things. There are so many projects you have made that have inspired the child in me. I've been following since your collab with Grant, I hope you keep on creating and designing to bring the future closer one day at a time.
try making plastic models and keep them. it kinda helps
Stay strong fam. You're amazing. 👍  Ignore the haters. They're just bitter people.
Why are there 180 dislikes???
12:22
R u gonna get another play button from youtube
if anybody is an a$$hole to people like the hacksmith, then you'l be sorry when they build a real life lightsaber... oh wait they already did? interesting
If you ever have stocks I’ll buy them
can i get a hoooo yeaaah
❤️❤️❤️
You forgot the parsley and sage with that rosemary and thyme.
what happened to last week's video??? I'm not saying you did anything wrong, I'm just wondering. I love your content and you are so inspiring!
Pleeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaasssssssseeeeee make the Doom Eternal Crucible. It would be super cool and all my engineering buddies would love to see it become a real thing
Diamond play button mjonir (Question mark)
YouTube be like: 👁👄👁
The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do! The Hacksmith wouldn't be The Hacksmith  without having people their to make it into an industry!  You can be afraid of losing people but be more afraid of losing yourseld by trying to please everyone around you!!!
hi mr hacksmith I really enjoy all of your videos and I am also canadian I do a small stop motion channel would you be interested in subscribing? oh and also what can i do to get more subs i neeeeeeeed to know!
Hope he makes some big laser cannon... Also congrats! Man, I was shocked to see the lightsaber being actually looking real!
I am a huge fan of the channel and have been here for 3+ years dont let the negative comments get you down, I think a Tony Stark hair cut would suit u great
Why
Im not crying ur crying. Shut up😭
Can't wait to see what you guys end up doing with the new location and new plans in these next few years! Super cool!
Next thing to build= pulse rifle from alien???
thats sick
Next project for once you get a even more gigantic place: A freaking whole star destroyer from Star Wars
you have a great plan!
I always liked this channel but now I think it's my favorite
1000 degree knife challenge Mk2
Congratulations for 10M subscribers dude
anybody else realize that the diamond was red and  the color of 100 milion subs
Wow, I just spent 5 years trying to get this. Let’s destroy it! That is some serious dedication, keep doing what you do.
I love how he takes time to make content instead of working on his life one of the best you tubers ever.👍👍
You should take a vacation you carried the channel, now rest
I just can't tell how much i loved this video!  Great work you all did the last years! Great to see your dreams comming true!
Was not expecting the cooking show!🤣
Hacksmith: gets diamond play button* Hacksmith: tries to destroy it for views* Hacksmith: a small price to pay for salvation
I would definitely buy a lightsaber if you put them up for sale
JackSucksAtLife despises you now. you have made an enemy xD
I subbed ate 800k
NOOOOO DONT DO IIIIIIIIIIT!!!
dont think flex tape can fix that
I hope YouTube gives you another play button
You the best,,do not care what people say.....
So emotional...🥺
@JackSucksAtLife
I LOVE ALL OF YOU HACKSMITH ❤️
Hacksmith used avengers quotes:to bring a group of remarkable people to see if they can become something more.  Me: that’s what he said
He looks like a hobo he needs to shave
I've been here since you had 500k subscribers your projects are amazing !!!
Been here since it was just Ian and James. Congrats on 10 mil. 💪💪💪❤️
"My god. He's gone mad with power!" -JonTron
When im 18 and get an engineering degree im definatley going to do my best to work at hacksmith industries
When will the giveaway winner be announced? Also loved the vid!
Make the play botton medal a watch for yourself (:
12:20
12:25 thank me  later
This man is beyond my understanding he has created something monumental for people to learn and to be inspired worldwide I know he will not see this but I've been watching for years and from all of us we support you and appreciate the enormous amount of effort you put into this god-tier channel, as I want to become an engineer in the future and you help me believe that will be possible. So from all of us, thank you
This guy is speaking the language of the gods
😢😖😭😭😭😭
Me and my dad love your vids😄
The 201 dislikes on the video are karens
" If you dont have a 10 mil diamond play button simply start a youtube channel and get 10 mil subs" Me : what an idea why didn't i think of that!
I know it’s hard but there is and will always be haters out there usually because they suffer from severe jealousy so just try not to worry about them. Also sadly there are plenty of people who get off on being a “troll”.  You have to just develop a way to push past those dicks and keep on powering. I suggest as soon as you see that a comment is nasty just delete it or move past it. Do not read it and get sucked into their crap as that is what they want!! Good luck and keep up the good work
Yeet
When/if you retire, you guys should make a "Hacksmith Industries Museum"
As of 35 minutes after this video was posted the channel already has 10.8M subscribers. Here comes the 11M diamond play button!
Tip playbuten
you could hear his sad voice :(
I wish your hair is shorter
When you get to 15 million subscribers you should make a 10 foot tall iron giant
Mans made it on the news
YOU MURDERED THE PLAY BUTTONNDK<HASKDYULWABGDWB>KLI>N
When you get a diamond play button and all you do is destroying it.
The main thing about people is, you can’t please everyone, some people are just malicious and don’t care how hard you’re trying to keep all of us people, who get to enjoy what you do for free, happy with what you’re showing us and showing us what’s possible.  The main point is. Do what YOU want to do. Do what YOUR TEAM wants to do. You are all working so hard even for the people who don’t appreciate. Those of us who do love your content and your innovations. We all support you. Keep it up Hacksmith industries, you’re all amazing.
I love how you absolutely shat on all the haters
I’ve been watching for so long almost since the very beginning and you guys finally got to the 10 million subs you all deserve
You are the coolest guy ever you made a like people you are a genius
James, I only expect the best from you and if you need a couple of days to do that build or need to take a break then I understand completely and hell why don’t you post some failed builds, I’m always interested in seeing what you are trying to create and if it didn’t work, then hey new skills learned and new experience gained
Honestly bro ,they didn't expect this 💀 with Diamond playbutton,,keep doing this bro 👏
That was sick, love it.
You k hope you are
I don’t understand why there’s dislikes
it is cool that the glass bit did not break
Go Hacksmith Industries!
Hi James, I always look forward to Thursday coz of your videos! You have always inspired me to be innovative and hardworking. I hope I could work for you one day! Keep on inspiring me as well as millions of people!
He in end game now
Is hackSmith industries an engineer bc what he is I wanna do that I really wish I could make things like the real black panther suit
dude your crazy, and i love it you are probably the only one to use a diamond playbutton!  :-)
well that's one way to give your playbutton a paintjob
you're well on the path to success, and I'm eager to see each step of your plan take shape, but my question is how will you ensure that the business will stay in business long after you're gone, and how would you ensure it is always used to better humanity, and not become just a money cow? people like you and your team are 1 in a million, and I just want to know how you plan to make sure that when the time comes for you to pass on the mantle of "the hacksmith", you're passing it on to a group who shares the same mindset.
”Simply start a youtube channel and attract 10 million subscribers; that’s only the entire population of Sweden”  Me who is from Sweden: Bruh..
I didn’t think a play button could be so tough.
Those colors were phenomenal
An now you got me sad. I miss Grant 🥲🥲
Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
And you did Chang a lot of people’s life
Man this dude got me in the first half
This guy is literally going to make the Avengers compound a reality and I love it!
Being an intern sounds amazing, but I'm in America and not old enough to have an internship in Canada
hay there, big fan here all the way from Ethiopia just wanted to let you know that you are an amazing person and a great leader and don't let nobody tell you differently. and I am a late subscriber I wasn't here when u started the channel but I wish I was there through the hacksmiths ups and downs because I know I would have pursued the passion I had for your work. even tho I couldn't follow this road you and your team's passion for what you do still push me to be better at what I do. and I know not hope I know your plans will come true, hay u made it this far.
hacksmith u are great at what u do and dont let the haters win they just want to be as cool as u.
Why u destroy it u dumb dumbs...
Damn You can hear his voice wobble that's how you know he really cares 😊 keep it up
Crying noise
At any time now I fully expect James to see a future version of himself whose built a functioning delorean time machine and used it to travel back in time to tell him about the future
youtube is like I NEW IT
Dang, Hacksmith has gone so far. Been watching since 2016, so I can't claim to be an og fan, but I love their work
My english isn't the best but I just wanted to say that you're all amezing, you helped me trou a rouph time, and i really appriciate alle the things you've done for us, your community you deserve the 10 millon subscribers on youtube, hacksmith indisties is the best, and probbably even beter then Stark industries, keep up the amezing work and i will watch tour videos, whatever you'll make Greetings Jono
Hacksmith can you make the Mandolorian weapon that make people evaporate. But instead make the weapon shoots the things that the Han blaster shot.
After that  there goes your subscription
The fact that his voice starts breaking is just 😔
As a reasonably long time viewer. I got goose bumps when you said you changed the name and I looked immediately and it was changed.
Thank you so much you and your team are truly remarkable and honestly you have already made such an impact on this world and I cant wait to see where y'all are in 5 more years
Thank you. For everything. You've inspired millions, and are truly amazing!
I get a diamond play button in his head keep it as a YouTube reward for try to cut it in half with a light saber which one🤔
Since Hacksimth Industries is a business, why don't you make it stock so everyone who interested in your company and wants to support it can buy them? Plus, if you announce it in your channel most of your subscribers will buy a lot of stocks.
This is a smart plan and realistically plausible. I also agree with the youtube part
If you want to watch a great part of the video start at 0:00 an watch till the end
Imagine being the best motivator
Lovely speech 👍👏👏👏👏
I wish the best for you Hacksmith and may your business becomes the best of the best
that speech was very inspiring
I guarantee than in 5-10 years, you will overtake Elon Musk, and become the richest person in the world.
Make the lightsabre a staff ☝🏼
Been subscribed since you were only at around 300k or so, it's crazy to see how much you've grown with your channel and the amazing team you've developed along the way. I just want to say congratulations truly because you deserve it more than anything. Hope to see you keep going and have an awesome day!!!
this making me happy but WHY?😱
I’m sorry for the haters I would like to see them do it better than you.
Hacksmith should be in a movie it would be lit look at the stuff he makes
I swear, it would be a decent movie idea if there's like a zombie apocalypse or ai robots taking over the world and hacksmith using his stuff to go against them and survive
Even if you uploaded every month i would still say wow to every video you upload!
Nice work man , you're the best  Love from France
This man is literally another elon musk  Or elon musk is another james.....    Anyways, keep up the amazing content man. we all love it
You're planning to make Hacksimith Idustries even bigger??? What the hack's going on with you guys?? 😳😳😂👍
You are the best your the best take your time on your videos dont be rushing yourself I love your videos
BRUH you just destroyed your 10M subscriber plack
James, I think I can speak for all of us when I say thank you for inspiring and looking after our future. You are a great mentor and someone who everyone should look up to. Thank you for your entertainment and joy you’ve given all of us for so many years. Keep doing what makes YOU happy.
I just realized I wasn’t subscribed 😬
James should make a cooking show
Can you do something fortnite related

I don't get the people, disliking your videos...
Ive been watching your videos since i was young - you pushed me to get into welding professionally and are pushing me to go further.  I can think of no one more deserving of a diamond play button.  I honestly wish there was a possibility to work under you guys.
Luv u guy's...TROLLZ NEED TO SHUT IT...makes my SUPER HUGE INNER NERD ECSTATIC....
14:20 is basically a obsidian-play-button. And also I want to thank you for the awesome last month. I found your channel through the plasma-based-lightsaber video. After enjoying that I binged the Make it Real playlist and really really love your work. So hang on guys, your doing great!
This really makes me think how time flies by when i just discovered this channel from the first exoskeleton arm probably roughly about 1million subs? But yeah watching this channel grow has been a pleasure and Im not planning on stopping Congrats to you guys🥂🍻🍾🎉
This guy is a legend
I have wanted to join you guys since day one just in a different countries lol
Ur doing good man keep up the great work,!
I wonder if he'll read this
I can't belive you have done this😅
This is what i call quality content
At least you know that if your wareshop decides to blow up, the play button will probably survive
At least they got 2 play buttons now
Ur videos r awesome and inspire me to make thinks and to look into engineering keep doing what u do! 😃
Dude, please don't pressure yourself, just let you and your time enjoy your lives, watching you guys getting pressured is very terrible to see, take care of yourselves
Dont Worry James, The Other 99% Of Us Believe In You and Will always Be Here. We Will Be Patient and Watch You and The Company Grow.
thank you so much for all the work, we love you c:
This thing cuts better than my parents cut their marriage in half
What an awesome and heartwarming video man, Good luck to you and the team for everything going forward and i'll still be watching for the next 5 years and beyond
Way to go
A youtuber prefering to melt a trophy like that rather than keeping it really shows it's a good youtuber. Loved this channel for 4 years now!!!
yes
just why
lmao
Hear before 34 minutes
I was with this chanel from the start and i am so happy that it got so far
He was keeping his tears so hard❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I had always felt like I was watching TKOR whenever I watch you guys, now i know why
Do you ever plan on running a placement scheme in the UK ?
Thanks for the subs, wow we destroyed the button
Concats you are inspiring me to invent and make things I've been with you guys for a while cant wait to see the future of hack Smith industrys love yall 💖
Nobody: spamming comments  James:I'm going to cast a custom diamond play button using the play button Thanos:I used the play button to make a play button
If your really read all the comments then . . . Well . . . Hi
Isnt it like disrespectful to us subscribers that ur cutting ur play buttons?, Ur cutting the thing that is proof of our support for u.
Very nice video, I don't really remember when I started watching this channel, but it has been sometime around the Kingsman video. I personally don't have the capability to support you guys by more than just watching your videos and sharing them but I really like your style of videos and you vision.
What if im stupid and lazy but i like to work on projects and learn :D
woah, didn't even realize the new name.Keep up the good work!
Insane intro. Fresh Prince of Bel-air
Lightsaber? More like a Plasmasaber because isn't hard and if you have two "lightsabers" you can't make a duel with these sabers :)
Das ist eine sehr schöne Danksagung 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 bin seit kurz vor 10 Millionen Zuschauern dabei, macht weiter so.   This is a very nice thanking 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 im actually before 10 Million watchers here, keep going
Hacksmith: Are they gone? Me: no.

Wow 10 million congrats Kell up the great work
Is the play button heavy
Jacksucksatlife: *cries in corner*
Many people have, together, written enough bad comments to fill up several novels. So what should the people who leave the good comments do?  Write enough good comments to fill up book trilogies!
I apreciate the work and the time spended making ihis ptojects  You need more than 10 mil subscribers (when I sez You i refere the entire te-am ) good job !!!!!!!
I’m just waiting for the inevitable Elon Musk partnership.
they call you tony stark but now you look like thor
He has a beautiful youtube botton its blue then yellow jeuse¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Are you guys still going on on the Ironman suit project? Btw u guys did a crazy job with what u did so far like making the iron man repulsers.
Hacksmith just saying that you are going to have comments that may not be positive, but let me just tell you that you make AMAZING content and that you should feel good about what you've produced. There are millions, and millions of people out there, so there's bound to be a few haters. I just wanted to let you know that don't let a handful of people ruin your day. You've still got millions of people who love and enjoy your content. So in all I just wanted to say that we all appreciate your effort into producing these awesome videos! Keep up the great content, and don't let those haters stop you from happiness and ruin your day! Thanks and stay safe!
Dear Hacksmith Industries i knew your'e Channel since 5 years and always you found knew ways to inspire me. Im literrally from germany so your Videos anrent huge inspiring me only also i learn english much quicker go on Hacksmith Team your'e the best
Your my favorite YouTuber! Great work
This is emotional. When he mentioned THE KING OF RANDOM he was about to cry. That says how much he meant for him.
Was it just me are did the play button look like iron man Arc reactor
You make the best content. Nobody should take you for granted.
You did NOT BRUH😭
I think youtube is going to stop commenting on your videos now
Was it worth it tho
jacksuksatlife be like
Damn, man, Rest in Peace Grant, taken too soon, I remember watching his videos since the Mini Metal Foundry, its heartbreaking to see such a great man's journey be so short
What kind of soulless monster would dislike this?
14m 39s       STOP.   STOP.    STOP.     STOP.   STOP
I really cried watching this it made me emotional
The first 4min of the video made me cry and I respect you hack Smith if you can't do this are that you can do it if your see this keep going don't lits some cyberbullies lit you down keep going
If this isnt in youtube rewind then I....... I dont know what I'd do
I love you guys. You are actually living my fantasies. Keep it up!
It's nice knowing that there's one group of people out there who are not doing their inventions for the money, but instead to advance technology and make the fantasy of fiction a reality. It's honestly somewhat comforting, knowing that there's actually a pathway towards the wonderful world every generation before us dreamed of, and that people out there are carving the path towards it  Anyways, HECK YEAH CUTTING SH*T OPEN WITH A LIGHTSABER
I Love your videos
I like science now thanks is the litsaver a solid or liquid
Youtube just be watching this be like :O  .................
Hacksmith miniacal overload
I have so mush respect for this channel but most importantly for the crew.. keep it up!
I love the lightsaber, but i want it to be bigger. I just feel like it should be longer
I'd buy a little glass play button if shipping to germany wasn't like 20 bucks or something like this
Man that beard is amazing  now, how do I get one of those
Please can we have more videos like this
YouTube: WTF man
Amazing your the reason I love engineering

Bro, all the things you say and the way you think is trully inspiring, you are the best, I always thought that what you're doing here was just to entertain, but now i realize it's something much much bigger, in fact it's HUGEE , I hope you and your team can achieve everything your master plan involves, High hopes broooo!!! Love from México.
I love how youtubers dream of getting one of those and these dudes just melt theirs😂😂😂
what happens if you photoshop the molten glass of play button into a picture with the play button that is untouched?
What the Star Wars movies don’t tell you about is that they are actually attached to flamethrowers
Kind of early gang

YouTube: This is why we can’t have nice things...
Gordon Ramsay has been real quiet since hacksmith posted this video.
I have no clue how long ive watched you, a bit i know that much, 4?? Years, idk, buts its been great and i hope you at the very least get a college named after you
This is such a good video not just because of the lightsaber but to show us what it's like to do what The hacksmith does.
Someone should send these guys a lightsaber proof playbutton
You and your team are just crazy and amazing continue on this way because, guys your incredible
Grant from TKOR would be really proud.
I'm not in that 1%
I want to work in hacksmith industries
You can make Mando's armor out of the play button
YouTube watching this like why the f did I give that to them
You made me cry, yo are a real hero
Why would u do this u idiots
Just wanted to say thank you for you and your teams hard work in making the wonderful content we enjoy and for giving back to the students here in Kitchener waterloo, as a resident of the kw region its wonderful to see you guys giving back to the community and looking for expand your horizons. Although I cant speak for everyone I can say that we here in Kitchener Waterloo are proud of you guys and look forward to your wonderful projects you are looking to create.
The history section of this video was probably the most important part of this video, the mention of grant thompson really gave me shivers, great video
ive been watching this channel for over 2 years but all i can think about is what absolute pieces of shit that disliked this video
Anyone who skipped that heart to heart missed out on some inspiring stuff
Next lightsaber vs ballistic dummy
He’s cutting something everyone wants on Earth with something everyone wants in Star Wars
12:22 So you don’t have to skip you could just quick this
damn, hope u ll reae this. this really is one of the most sincere and motivational video i ve seen. i love what hacksmith is evolving and i love where all of this is going. u guys really deserve ur subs, first cause the vids are great and so entertaining, but also bc you push technology further every video, and you share it with everyone on yt.  wish you the best for future 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Petition for hacksmith to make a Darth maul style proto saber

The people that disliked this video should be on the other side of that lightsaber
Did he study that speech cause it's epic!:)
Your vision is great you literally had planned it for life. Respect man. I just hope you get attention of someone with big money, someone who has a greed for innovation, someone who would be happy to fund you without any corporate bullshit. Hope Hacksmith Industries Grows

Dont worry we love your videos! Your like the real life Tony stark
This is truly an inspiring, thank you for all you do :)
I have been watching the Hacksmith or should I say Hacksmith industries for a long time now and I am so excited about what they have to come. I am an aspiring engineer because of you, and people like you.

I wonder what this guy is going to build after 5 years you make really cool stuff
Somone make this story a podcast
Why is not the backflip tutorial on the playlist?
TO SHOW YOU THE POWER OF FLEXTAPE...
You guys are inspirational. You show what happens when hard work pays off and that you can have fun and do the things you love. It’s been a long road and you guys deserve to be where you are right now
I’m. New. To your channel but love it, do it the way you want it’s yours ❤️💕
What the

When you make the iron man chestplate, use the “diamond” that you took out of the play button as the arc reactor😂
What is there to dislike
Jacksucksatlife:noooooo plz not the diamond play button  Hacksmith:haha play button go burn
Okay legit though if you collabbed with Binging with Babish I would watch and love it
We are actually making a Star Wars fan film soon. I absolutely love all your creations! It crazy how far you've gone. What also crazy its that I'm about 100 km down south from you lol.

Honestly this was one of the best videos I’ve ever watched, he really shows his care about the community and everything around him; he truly is a role model.He is not the average YouTuber, him and his team are using many hours and it clearly shows. Be more like Hacksmith industries, Keep being you!

0:15 I see what you did there  Edit: He said shatter into 10 million pieces, for ten million subscribers.
Hey Hacksmith, I only just subbed recently. But I just want to tell you that I really like your content and that what you do is awesome! Keep up the great work man :)
Who else has a feeling that Jack is going to want to buy this..
Was I the only one who wanted him to say Roger Roger with the mask on?
In the year 2030 I will be glad to know that all of humanity is where it's at because of you I made over 60+ accounts to sub to you and got over 1000 of my friends on social media to sub and I love that I have loved your videos since I was little well that young I'm 18 now and have been watching since you were hacksmith instead of hacksmit industries and god bless you james
I always love it when people talk about doing stuff like this is hard and it is, making a difference is hard. It's not always fun and games and it shouldn't need to be, making a difference should be making a sacrifice. That's what you do James, you make a sacrifice for others giving them the aspiration to be better, to learn more, thank you.

Thank you for being a release from everyday life when your videos come out; a place people can come to just forget about their troubles and watch geniuses at work and show us what we are capable if we just put our differences aside and work together. Thank you so much and I hope you don't feel too pressured to roll out a video evry week consistently, after all as you said it's a lot of work to design and fabricate these projects and produce the videos. So thank you Hacksmith and team
04:00 don't cry , cause then I'll cry .
That was cruel what you said about tony he helps people. But i would not expect you to know about how many people he helps
Frame it dude. It not only shows that you accomplished with your channel but also how
That part about Grant really hit me in the feels, I miss him man.
Why? Just why would you do that?
Holy shit. People expect you to run this amazing channel by yourself?? Thats absolutely unreasonable. You're amazing, dont let anyone tell you different.
1:10 ok i feel bad im gonna watch the whole video
Tbh i didn't expect to cry
LES GOOOO
this is such an amazing channel i love watching these guys make stuff from my imagination
Hi hack smith me and my brother watches your vids everyday and we really love your creativity and we want to be like you someday so keep doing you and I have a request  can you create a glowing cosmic cube like Loki has
I just now realized that you guys changed your Youtube name to Hacksmith Industries.
Hi
Neat
Such an awesome treat to see how you guys have grown over the years I've been subscribed!
10:15 hahaha a cooking channel from you guys would be epic, I would SO watch that!  😂😂👍
That one person who made sure it was as perfect as possible for Hacksmith Industries.
I feel so sad
This is the best channel on YouTube.
Hey hacksmith i am a long time fan and i realy love your vids. I look up to you and you have inspired me to persue a career as engineer. Please always stay awesome and keep inventing awesome projects. I hope your plan works out. Good luck👍👍👍
Why his voice is cracking? Am I the only one hearing this?
i love your vids and i live in kw
I love you
POV: you haven’t watched the whole video yet
I love your vids
times like this i wish there was a salute emoji
I've watched your videos since your first protosaber, maybe event earlier. Idk
Good video, very heart warming and deep. I think you guys and Mark Rober could make something amazing
Read my comment. :) :) :) :)
I personally would leave it at that blue color it was so cool.
The people that disliked this are the bullies. You are a inspiration man
This is so dumb
This is why you guys are already almost at 11mil
Imagine making a lightsaber out of the play button. Now that would cool.
Noch nie jemanden so eine Zitrone ausdrücken gesehen. Amazing Video!!
You're an inspiration to myself and so many other people. Keep up what you're doing, I can't wait to see what the future holds. Don't ever change man your intentions are more pure than most. Good luck man
You are the best at what you do and there's those of us who actually appreciate what you do you care so very much about Hacksmith industries you are the heart and we are the blood we are your fans
I had put the playback speed at 2x and i could barely hear anything especially during when 2x areas
If i would be a patreon and a youtube member i would get 2x 50% of, so 100% of?
Congratulations on 10Mil you guys deserve it and more excited to see what Hacksmith Industries becomes in the next coming year if it like you said it would it's going to be Amazing🐺💙
Happy for you guys! Can’t wait to see what the team brings in the future!!
You inspire me thank you
Well, there goes $3,000 right through a light saber blade.
Wow! You are the best YouTuber ever.  But I would keep my play buttons ha ha 😁
tuna fish
GG
😂 Beautiful your speech is beautiful
This is the best thing I have ever seen.
me sees title: this is some wizardry
Woah
A great plan and belated congratulations on the 10,000,000.
Early
2025 We just made a real working iron man suit, with pym particles, and test it against our black panther nanotech suit!
Can't wait to see what you have built by the next ten years. Probably an actual flyable iron man suit
hacksmith is my greatest influence
I love what you do and I want you to keep working
Your doing very well and i think this has hit us all go so on!!!!
Who dislike this video? I'll  you give diamond play button too
I bet Jacksucksatlife would have paid money for a orange diamond play button.
Just saying when the triangle part was turning orange it reminded me of when tony was making the are reactor chest pce
Here from 200k 😄
Literally every other youtuber: Hangs play button on wall Hacksmith Industries: Lets cut it in half  😂😂😂😂😂😂
who ended crying with that speech because i was
11:10 can’t watch these vids in silence ;) lol
No one asked for this    But it is the greatest thing in the world
Diamond play button: **Exists** The Hacksmith: I'm gonna end his whole career
To work hard to push the boundaries you need  a team every great discovery had a group of people behind it may your future be prosperous as your past has been glorious
14:04 Diamond Play Button | Case Hardend
He went from working in his garage to now having his own facilities and about to buy a research facility.
Do you have a death wish because susan will come after you
this guy is one of those youtubers who dont flex
When I watch the videos.  I can see the other projects in the background.  It is fun to see that in the videos for me.
I really appreciate  this its always been so interesting and funny thank you man
You are the best YouTuber I’ve ever seen
do you need a college degree in engineering for the intern program?
Hey I love the stuff that you make
You’re the best
Cutting start 12:30
Others YouTube: Seriously  Me YouTube: Pay up Clark, told you they will try to lightsaber it.  P.S. I first got into your channel on the lightsaber or marvel item. Glad to watching your videos. My favorite it the Thanos sword spinning of death. Also I see Hacksmith  Industries becoming home of any sort of science fiction weapons or vehicle that will help us reach for the stars. Who knows, with your help and crazy personalities we may even come across a real Jedi.
Quando o Aruan fez isso todo mundo reclamou...
🥠🥮🍡🍢🍧🍥🍚🍙🍤
The subscriber count grows with his beard
Yep, this is great
Bro make a new thing, lightsaber  getting boring
:')
Nashe (?
It actually looks pretty cool at 14:38
I dint Think takt i speak for all but fore the most i Can say that Grant will and always have had a enormous pace in ours heart and may he Rest In Peace
Props to whatever company YouTube pays to make those play buttons, they are pretty resilient.
People who give you crap about your videos should burn the things youve done are amazing
Be grateful everyone hacksmith is are doing what they can and they are doing a great job at it!!!
Who knew burning a diamond play button would result in it changing colors so many times?
Hacksmith u people are amazing 🤩
Well it’s good to know now that if I want to make a lightsaber proof wall, just make it out of diamond playbuttons because it takes so long to burn through one.
Don't make sad this man, guys. He is our childhood hero. He probably made more sacrifices than your age. So, enjoy the video and stay grateful because of we have this heroes, the Hacksmith :)
😕🧐🤩😚🙃😆
Im gonna comment here just so i could prove that i was here for a few years rn
No one: Hacksmith: Let’s destroy a diamond play-button
people who complain about your videos clearly aren't aware of the time and effort it takes. i love your videos and i'm always so fascinated and amazed, truly awesome people doing basically... god's work.    and that bit about grant almost made me cry. i miss watching him so much and he looked like an awesome person.
James, your heartfelt message in this video is moving and beautiful. You and every single person on your team have produced so much fun and exciting content that has brought joy to so many people, and made so many amazing things--it's impossible to even quantify it. Your hopes and plans for the future are visionary and exciting. Wishing you all the best, and looking forward to all the great things that all of you are going to accomplish. Please tell everyone on the team that each and every one of them is an inspiration!
Yep
Wow
Who else is wondering why the lightsaber is shorter than the first video
Yes i love your plan. I'm a huge fan and because of you i started studying for mechanical engineer. I wanted to do a coop with you but there was on the website that you will not plan far in the future. So now i hope that that will change because I'll have to get a visa. Love you bro
But why, why would you do that?
James
I kind of see your lightsaber more as ironmans plasma cutter
This is so wholesome
I didn’t know he died 😢
Deep, that was amazing
Legend. That's all that needs to be said.
This video made me cry I dont know why. I remember how small this channel was. I think I subscribed when you were at 100k. This channel just continues to amaze me. Thanks!
The playbutton is literally the equivalent to the Mandalorians beskar armour
Also great job with your Chanel keep up the awesome work.
I hope George Lucas sees this channel's contents and see how his lightsaber is coming out of science fiction and slowly becoming reality xD
NO DONT DO IT
Happy for you
That play button made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of entertainment.
I really can't believe you guys made a fricking lightsaber
You know if you replace the play button with fish I think that would be delicious 😄
This man made a rainbow play button
Screw the haters
Ya
Keep up the amazing job i will allways watch and support you and this channel
Cheese 🧀
24 minutes I barely ever watch this
I know I'm just s random youtube commenter, but if you're planning to make products that actually improve people's quality of life I would suggest that you look into disability tech. Disability tech from mobility aids to accessible video game controllers are usually incredibly expensive, and a lot of people would benefit from more affordable/accessable options.
Other youtubers:Omg I reached 10mil subs I'll try not to break the play button  James:Let's obliterate this thing Btw congrats man. I've been a fan since 2014. Keep up the amazing work!!!
My good sir I love your work   I wish I can do something like this
I cant believe he don it like wierd flex but ok
Ahhhhhhhhh noooooo
I love the cooking show
Soooo.......time for a power loader update???
What happened to the aliens mech and by the way keep up the   good work
I can only imagine how grant would have reacted to where you have gotten he wold be very proud and we all are too .
Forbidden Dorito
Its 1:24 and this vid was 24 mins ago, what a coincidence
“Build a team of remarkable people to see if we can become something more” 😂
James its time for a haircut
We all have the same question "why"
I’m totally nerding out right now!!! 🤓🤓🤓 I’ve been following make it real for four out of the five years it’s existence and each and every video has been inspiring! I love watches big videos you and your team bringing fictional things to life. And every day I think to myself I wanna be able to do that some day. I love hack smith  Industries and I love make it real! I wish you and your team the best of luck and pray that you continue to be successful 😃😃😃   God bless The HackSmith
listen to his voice, when he finally cut that youtube play button.
Video Starts at 10:15
It wasn't always Hacksmith Industries? Honestly thought it was
Hacksmith can you please do all the jurassic park movie series
This is so cool, I love your videos and have followed the lightsaber project closely! I cant wait to see what you and your team do next!
Amazing 🤩👌
james need to shave his bread. it is geting big.
In five years the Avengers are going to be real
You are an inspiration. Your the reason why I started to make stuff like you
I love how he is being Corona safe with his face mask but dont u think he is being a bit paranoid
Keep doing what you do best.  Lobe your videos.
Hi love the vids keep it up👍
Hey hacksmith you should make an arena war car from gta 5
Amazing
Atleast now we know that the way to defend ourselves is to make diamond play button doors.
One of the hardest working YouTubers out there. Man I can see and feel what you go through, keep it up.
I think he accidentally put in a avengers infinity war quote
That was the real reason behind the Jesus look: Changing the world
Hey I need a good how to make channel name
Mr.Smith, keep going bro.Don’t listen to the haters.I hope that your plans get real.I’Il be the fist who is going to Studie in your school.Lake we German say: Hau einfach auf die Kake
Imagine Hacksmith Industries with the resources of i don't know Elon Musk, fuck yeah
Keep going and get to success you know no other people did nothing like you did so you are very awesome 😎 🤩
Man rest in peace Grant Thompson, I could hear that shakiness in your voice when you were talking about him. I can only imagine how difficult it would be to have known him personally. I am absolutely positive that if he is looking down on us he would be proud of you. You have sent a ripple through all of us. We love you James, and everyone at Hacksmith Industries. You guys have inspired myself and many others to see just how cool engineering is, and that is such an amazing thing to have accomplished, and we're so excited for the future of Hacksmith Industries. Congratulations on 10 Million, and here's to 10 more. ❤
Get your "here before one million" tickets right now!!!
The colours that button went through were beautfiul! Could you post a timelapse of the complete cut?
One person will cry at this video and it's gonna be Jacksucksatlife.
Damn, YouTube probably getting pissed when watching this video
You should try to make a helicopter.
Imagine all your subscribers were form sweden🤣
*I THINK HE CAN HELP ELON MUST GOVE US CAT GIRLS FASTER*
First 12 minutes were the best minutes of this entire channel
i just wanna say your hair looks amazing, and it fits the theme of star wars perfectly! the reason why is you look like Chewbacca! lol anyways i love the vids man keep up the great work!
did he rly do this?   cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
They heard you were gonna melt it so they sent you one made of a metal with a really high melting point.
Breed me
You said in the video you read the comments. You did promise it so you know what you have to do😊😊😊😉
I had now I know what to do just make a full set of Iron Man armor with that show that lightsaber like actually if you made what ever the stuff is that made the diamond play button into Iron Man armor they would actually be pretty cool like maybe you could use the stuff to make a mini Iron Man Shield because did you see how long it took to just Bernal that with a Shield versus that I think Iron Man would win
Starglow Indeigogo too
Yay 24 mins in
Feel Sad For The Diamond
Don
I like your beard
10:48 People from sweden be like: OMG he mentioned our contry!!!    (I'm swede and that was my reaction)
"Are they gone?" "Yes, sir."
Anyone who disliked and it’s at 16 minutes since the publish and at 96 likes you are the problem this man puts his heart and soul into his company’s videos. Thankyou hacksmith industries
"He is the god of destruction". Hey James huge fan of Star Wars and wow this is amazing you push forward on your dreams that's what inspired my channel check it out love you guys so much and your videos .
Love this guy. He definitely has the smarts and nads to be as big as Elon. Also sounds like the negative comments really get to him you have to remember a lot of ppl are idiots so if only 1% are negative you're killing it.
I remember, when I first heard of you in a German TV Show, where you presented your exoskeleton-legs and lifted a car with them... It was a great inspiration for me to see what one man can do by using his brain and knowledge, to create something so mighty and powerful. Man, you changed my life!  And look at you now! 10.000.000 subscribers on YouTube and it still goes on! Better than ever before! Love your Chanel and your ideas! Great greetings to your team and good luck for your future projects!  So in Germany you got a great Hacksmith fan! Thanks for reading
All of your videos have inspired me to do my best in school and in work. You are so cool to fans and it looks like you would be the best boss ever. Keep on building
Great vision! Keep pursuing the Master Plan 2.0  Two years ago, my now 6 year old told me that he wants to build a robot to help mom around the house and help me fix stuff.  :)
You are the best. Your content is amazing, and I am so excited every time I see a new hacksmith video in my subscriptions feed. We are always supportive for you and congrats on 10 million!
Partner with Mark Rober to improve people's lives through science AND hacksmithing?
Bro, you really are awesome. You and your team are awesome. We appreciate all your hard work. Speaking for myself I wish I had half the talent and skill you guys possess. I take every video you post as an opportunity to learn something myself.  You guys deserve all the accolades you receive 🤘✌
Could you make an assassin creed hidden blade
Your the only yutuber I each every day
Big fan from India
Tong time fan squad!!
Cant wait to see a full lightsaber
That looks awesome, very you!
most youtubers: puts play button on wall Hacksmith industries: "lets cut it in half" this is why i love this channel
12:22
Hacksmith I just enjoy your videos, because when I watch your videos its just so awesome to watch. Because of you and Grant are the reason why I wanted to start Youtube in the first place, so I just want to say thank you so much for all that you do.
Wow, the first Youtuber to not care about his play button
if you dont see this then you lie
JackSucksAtLife is in shambles
Thank you for all of your work. Watching these videos is one of the highlights of my week and why I want to keep with engineerin.
Hi
Why. Why would you do this. Whyyyyyyyyyy
YouTube: Here is your diamond play button. You can do anything you want with it.  YouTube after this: Except that.
Did he make anybody else shed tears and feel happiness during his pep talk at the beginning that went till 12 minutes of the video, cause I did, he is a real inspiration and I hope I could do something like him in the future!
imposible
YouTube watching this vid 😳😳
Really nice Video! And I think your future plan sounds great too, hopefully it'll work out  as planned.  But man, you really need to shave or we'll have a lightsabre swinging chewbacca taking over Canada...
Than looks yummy
wait does the light saver make sounds or is it effects
Would it be possible to build Shawn's electro-tazer hidden blade from Assassin's Creed Origins?
ooh
You know how in the movie "Hot Fuzz" the chief of police says "A big bushie beard!"? Just wanted to leave you with that thought
600th comment
Guess we're not gonna talk about how James sounded like a battle droid in the mask for cutting the play button. Future project maybe???
Here before 100,000 views😬🤟🤟🤟🤙🤙🤙🤙
Play button sword
The five year olds who don't understand how a business model works need to stay out of comment section of these kinds of channels. Unfortunately there are not enough positivity on the internet as a whole, that if you have anything less than a tank for self esteem, success is next  to impossible to achieve. Long story short if you're posting your opinion and it's negative, don't post it.
Keep up your awesome
Youtube be like: we are not giving you a new one!
Youtube be like: ... BRuh
NOOO, sorry YEAHHHHH!!!
Hack smith: I'm going to cut my diamond with my light saber youtube: A jedi should respect it's wepon better.
Someone tweet this at Jacksucksatlife or post it on his redit
Great job and awesome master plan!  I cant wait to see what you do in the future!  Keep living your dreams and making me hella jealous!
just why you finally get 10 mil. what do you do you destroy it?! why did you not just use 3000 on a diamond play button so you did not have to destroy the first one.
I absolutely love the lightsaber videos! I also like your profile picture. I see it as a derpy clone trooper! Lol
The Hacksmith has honestly inspired me to become and engineer
50 years down the line we'll look back and be like we were there when hacksmith industries conquered the world :P I'm looking forward to see what you can do within my lifetime
Worse part is for some reason there are 108 dislikes. Come on people
Hack smith: hey guys nice job on the play button  LETS DESTROY IT 😈
I don't understand I got the notification just an hour ago but literally every comment is from 20 hours ago
Can’t believe he destroyed it
Why did you have to destroy it?
I love you you the best ❤️
I love ur videos I respect u man 👍
Reminds me of darth vader's destroyed helmet.
Did u hear about the sale at the maul everything is half off
I love you videos next video can you do a avatar last air bender themed device
This guy is one of the reasons I still watch YouTube ❤️❤️
Commenting for first time . Hope I become like u  U r inspiration
You should also make objects to make food like to have a second channel called basically Cooking with hacksmith I think it would be cool.
SO you read my comment ha, then give this a hart ❤️
litterily destroying his diamond play button for more views, this man deserves much more subs then 10 mill although that is a lot
I love it
14:27 Titanium play button (It’s completely blue)
There is nothing what they wouldn't try to destroy
I love the new name
Your content just warms my heart this is the most amazing channel I have ever seen
you are the best i am a subscriber
This sacrifice for a video😐
Next we create antimatter! After lastweeks episode your personal black hole in a bottle
That’s really 😎
YouTube be like  Bruh
Love all your vids i am 12 years old and i love your vids keep up the good work.
bruh idk why tf ppl would dislike this its great
Cast the play button in resin.
I know diamonds the hardest substance but how hot does it need to be to melt diamond
Gets a diamond play button Nobody: Actually nobody: Not even the Hacksmith: The Hacksmith: LeTs CoOk It  Sick idea tho
Love your work haksmith keep going at it and there's are people who could use your invention like real life super heroes I have them in my city
The new rainbow play button!
Congrats, and I have an idea for the extra metal. Maybe you cast them into tiny playbuttons and do a giveaway for them to give back to the community.
Love the vids and you’ve inspired me to do what I love
Looks like one of Tony starks arc reactors
Do you guys still sell the batarangs
imagine if some huge investor saw this and just invested in hacksmith research center and made it into reality sooner than the expected date, i would love to go there since i am kind of a geek about these things and i hope his dream comes to a reality
You guys watch mythical movies and make them real and its extraordinary and awesome
TODAY WE CUT OUR DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON. NEXT, WE WILL MAKE A LIGHTSABER OUT OF THE DIAMOND PLAY BUTTON.
Wow guys. That was, as James often says: 'freakin awesome'. Why cut Captain America's shield when you can cut a diamond play button?
I wish I could like this more than once :(
Hey M8 I love you're content and I think you deserve a brake
James, thank you so much for all the videos and inspiration--we can tell that you put your heart and soul into everything you do,  and it show throughout all your videos. Thank you!
the oils slick loos sick
After that: WE MADE A 10 MILLION PLAY BUTTON
Congratulations on 10 mil , I've been watching since 1 million
Can’t wait until you hit 100 million and Cooking with Hacksmith Ep. 2 comes out
A true engineer, also love the Will Smith(Fresh Prince) Parody ^_^ Also you're technically using the lightsaber as a knife to eat the diamond play button
Amazing
When will you do another iron man themed video? You don’t have to but I’m just asking
Why not use oxy acetylene for more heat?
Cutting ur sub count in half
Prince of bell air? OH YEAH! Also, anyone seen mandolorian?
So cool 👍🏻👍🏻
so this guy rlly  destroyed something millions of ppl would have paid 100,00K dollars fore just when he got it.......
Hey
Wow, I was not expecting this amount of seriousness and emotion in this video when I read the title. You just cemented why I love this channel and what you and your team are doing. Awesome job and just thank you!
As long as you don’t pay your workers less than minimum wage like Elon Musk does with his Chinese workers I support your project
Youtube : We send you a play button to celebrate your achievement  Haksmith : It's light sabre time 😂  Seriously though, amazing journey. Congratulations on the success. ❤️
You created a blue gem play button. Do you know how much they go for?
James makes lighsaber/James breaks stuff/James made me happy
Normal ppl getting the 10million play button: let me but it up so everyone can see Hacksmith: let me just burn it up
Hacksmith is becoming fat Thor 😳 It looks really cool (The hair and beard not the fat part lol)
Cool video but what costs
Btw YouTube channels can buy replacement play buttons
No just no
Dude don't listen to all the bad comments what you do is awesome and you should keep it up
somehow almost had me in tears. Keep going you got this just don't give up.
Some YouTubers: I don’t wanna get my finger prints on it Hacksmith: Lightsaber
Are the light up noises for the lightsaber added in post processing or does it actually sound like that?
I may be a late subscriber but I’m also a believer
Congratulations on 10 million! I have been here since 2015-16 I believe from a different account though
Bro make videos with mister beast or one video
Your videos always make ny day there funny and they benefit my goal to become a aerospace engineer keep doing the great work
Best youtuber
Very proud of you guys! Congrats!
Keep on grinding man, and the rest of hacksmit industries too!  Some people just don’t understand how hard somebody works..
“As YouTube watched in horror”
❤❤
Where do you buy your captain america shields?
Your amazing Hacksmith
Whoever actually skipped to 12:22 I don’t appreciate that
Make a fallout suit
12:43 is when Eihe actually starts cutting it
OK, not gonna lie: up until you mentioned it 5 minutes in I didn't even notice your channel name had changed - like, it's so obvious and I just skipped straight over it...
The 107 dislikes will come around
If he likes my comment you have to subscribe.
Ahhhhh I love you guys so much, this was so cool!! I’ve been watching you guys for a couple years now and I’ve noticed James has gone through every phase of Thor with his hair and beard (even if they’re in the wrong order)
widebody the mini tesla truck, slam the truck, and then go and take it to some track and test it out at somepoint      the succ sqeez boom blow bois really would like that i think even though there isnt the rumble boi of an engine
Algum BR se recorda de um youtuber brasileiro que fez algo parecido??
Ääämmmh..why is ur right arm bigger than the other one?😅
¿¿¿ACASO ENLOQUESISTE??? ○□○
You have to retire so day tho... nvm ur vids r to good u must keep making congrats on 10 mil subs
Yo that was a really nice intro, you hace been a nice inspiration for me, LOVE FROM MEXICO
I do wonder if the old one would do better though
Can u make ethier a air bender glove or a water bending glove like the ones in last air bender
My goal is to learn the ways of the Hacksmith and learn to be an engineer like him and literally become a part of Hacksmith Industries
12:00
So THIS is what burnet play button looks like
James should make a service where he turns your Diamond play button a different color from the lightsaber heat
This is the most inspiring video I’ve ever seen on youtube I love you vids❤️
Some people just want to see the world burn, and they do that by disliking ur videos. Keep doin what u doin, ur great!
This is crazy, this is the only youtube channel that makes me happy about Solid Works and Engineering
Big brain move
Why did you do that😢 you destroyed such an award for ONE Video😶😶 kinda sad
Will it shatter in 10 million pieces --- underrated
Yo I’ve been here for so long you have come a long way I and so proud 😢
20 minutes later, you've  almost got 11 million subs already
That cool        Sorry 😅that hot
What about the power loader
Keep being awesome you are the best
I would like to help in anyway I can. Your innovation has lead me to think of ways to help Canada.I am American but I think that I know a way to help ice truckers.Let me knowing you want to here it
PLEASE MAKE A SWORD OUT OF THE MELTED PLAY BUTTON
Why do YOU Wang to distroye your Diamond premiu?
Honestly even if you retire I will still remember your videos, because I don't wanna work in engeeniring in the future (i say future because i'm 15) but honestly even then I love those videos because the things that you make are just awesome, and working for months for just a video deserve respect and you have mine. Honestly i'm not going to work in engeeniring because that's not what interested me but honestly by watching your videos and your determination what i realized i that with enough will (and your friends) we can do the things that we want. From a French fan 👍
READ MY COMMENT PLZ
I cannot wait for what comes next for you!!!
WOW just WOW james i just want you to know you are one of the MOST inspirational people i have EVER met and that i will always be with you. so thank you
I Remeber watching you first videos  years ago. Happy 10 million
I love how you're turning more and more into a real life Tony Stark
I dont know if you'll see this, but, you're the reason I'm trying to build an indie multimedia publisher. if you'd like, I'd be happy to help set up a hacksmith industries book series. Superheroes arent real yet, but I could make it real even if just in the pages of a book for you.
I gotta say I felt that man
i remember subing at 5mil
Hacksmith in a mask is a droid
We're with you, Hacksmith. I can't wait until faze 2 is over with. We will watch your career with great interest.
This is where the fun begins..
I love everything you do James. I myself am slowly getting in inventing/ improving in things in my everyday life. Also when you were wearing the mask you sounded like a battle droid from star wars the clones wars.
Honestly, after using so much of are time for us I really would not mind having to listen to 3 1 hr vids about he wants to make us happy
Claim your “here before 10 million views here” ⬇️
I almost cryed about that story about your history
Youtube melts down metal and makes a play button to sends to Hacksmith Industries then Hacksmith thinks you this is cool but I think it would be better if we melted this down and made it into something else.
WHY DID HE CUT THE PLAY BUTTON!?!?!?!?
Its incredible how much he values the community I ones posted a comment and it got no likes but he still replied so cool
James just know that the 1% is only 1% and you have the 99% of fans who don’t care if it’s not perfect we all love what you can do cause someday if you keep trying you can make anything impossible to possible
love the new channel name
Don’t worry James we all understand. The haters are the ones that don’t care. They come and go. But leave a mark behind and they don’t realise that.
I respect you hacksmith your amazing and inspired me to start doing mechanics.
Oh aaa noo aaa
Bin here since 1 mill
I think it would be cool if you could come to my school, liberty university, our engineering program here is not quite big yet, but I am sure that the students, including me would love to have you.
10:46 SWEDEN GANG!
Imagine if Youtube blocked you for melting their precious button.
Goodbye the Hacksmith  Say Hello to Hacksmith Industries
Just wait for JackSucksAtLife to see this LOL
You are my inspiration
Awe, 17 mins late. Subscribe and turn on notifications to not be 17 mins late.
I really love this channel and  I loved watching it grow. It's inspired me a lot! You guys are the future!
I had another acount that was deleted but I watched you since 2018 or 2017 I’m not that go but I still give u support ❤️
great video can't wait to see phase 2 to come into place
Shit I didn’t expect to be crying today
Hi!!!! I want to buy the lightsaber ;-; ok no I didn't am going to buy it xd
James I'm gonna be honest  I joined your channel because I love engineering and I hope that I can take my degree course. So you made a difference in the world. If you can affect and give dreams to teens like me, you have succeeded.  Thank you HackSmith
You should try and make Mandos armour from Mandalorian
Seeing Grant in those videos really hit me. He was such a genuine and caring guy that was taken right after he started to enjoy his life and his family. It's unfortunate that we lost such a amazing person way too soon.
James with the gas mask on sounds a little like a B1 battle droid
If you read mine can u like it?👍👍
You're the first person in history to cut through a YouTube diamond playbutton using a plasma based lightsaber
You should make a camp ti teach kids how to make stuff like what you make.
My fellow nerds out there will love this so much. ♥️🧠
Mais alguem do Brasil?
It will be cool if he built a real life metal mandolorian armor
I wish I'm able to come up with stuff like this but that's not gonna happen
Cool....🔥
Ok... to skew the proportions of nice/evil comments for the good. This is a positive comment. lets make it 0.1%
Live your channel, been here for so long can’t wait to see what you do next!!!
Plz make this video trending this is crazy ❤️
Man I dont care if u upload once a week(which btw is awesome well done) or if u upload once a month, I'll see it and watch it immediately no matter what it is. Your accually a true inspiration. U have changed the way I look at science. Keep going
best heart to heart episode ever
You were right about one thing. The negotiations were short
When I saw your speech in the history and the future of hacksmith I almost bursted into tears 😭.
I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL
This was amazing to watch. Also really excited to see how hacksmith industries will evolve.
I hope one day i can work like this guys.
Aruan tá diferente 🤔
The lemon skipped No Nut November! There came so less juce out!
Great video, honestly can't wait to see where you take your chanel and business in the future. Best of luck to all of you

We love all of you at hacksmith industries go team
Youtube after watching this video 🙄😤🤧
I cry 😢. Keep going. Your such a good person. Thank you for everything. I look forward to more amazing content.
It's no surprise that Hacksmith is going to be the next biggest tech industry, on the other hand, cool melty play button
Best diamond play button yet.
Hacksmith Industries thank you for all the amazing videos that I have watched during lockdown here in the UK when restrictions are over I would love to come to hacksmith industries for one of your tours
Imagine when hacksmite is international
i love the videos have you ever thought of making a lightsaber pike
Melt the whole diamond play button down and turn into another lightsaber
Now we know how YouTube is making colurs to buttons
When the glass turned yellow on the play button it looked so cool
We love you!! thank you!!
The absolute madlad
Alright This might be my first comment and i would apologize for that I have been watching your videos for a long time now. Your video of making rocket launcher glove from Iron Man was the first one i saw. I love the channel. How can people from aboard apply or work with you.??
You are the Avengers of earth
Hey, shave your self
Don't you always say part of why you do all this is to inspire people to go into stem fields I mean you did that with a couple members of your team and you sure as hell inspired them to make science fiction in science fact  and even from personal experience you sure as hell inspired me to try engineering and while I hold a LV.1 BTEC out of it and sadly didn't enjoy it as much as i expected/hoped I still tried  and hell I may not know what I wanna do yet a crazy ass hacksmith project is always one of the first things I try to get out of a bad moment  cause if theres guy's gal's and everything inbetween out there who can make a freking lightsaber I can get up and do just anything rather then feel bad  keep doing what your doing its awesome always a good time and if I acctualy had a drink on hand i'd offer some chears
Man I heard you get choked up and I wanna hug you
Good thing that the play button did not activate the self-defence mirror.
Who else was here from the beginning?
Please continue the make it real series, it's one of my favourite series and can't wait to see what you will make next
why tho
I hope that one day I can work for hacksmith industries and watch them grow as a company and a business and see all the great things they bring to the world
I dare u to make ganindorfs sord from zelda or hulks armor in thor ragnorock
Im hoping that you some day make a laser/plasma rifle in fallout style.    BTW great video
Marvel have stark industrie we have the Hack Smith Industrie
Noooooooo not the play button
Its great that all of you be doing this for people!!!! I love all you´re videos since I discovered this channel
Wouldn’t be cool if you guys could make something from power rangers
I have been watching you for 5 years and you have rilly grown.
Hacksmith in 2050: REAL PLASMA  BASED LIGHTSABER VS. *THE F*CKING MOON!*
It’s so good to see such a hard worker get so far
would if this channel just wanted to get to 10 million subscribers to do this
Kitchener represent! Woot woot!
During my last year as an undergrad and first year Masc. student I kind of lost my passion for engineering and lost track of why I wanted to be an engineer in the first place... you're videos reignited the spark, I've been following you ever since you maid the civil war shield and I've had an amazing time watching how you've grown the channel from there From the bottom of my heart, thank you!!! Can't wait to see you put your next master plan in action!!!
Hard work pays off!  💪💪💪
That plasma-flame at the bottom was pretty sick
how long did that take
Wait do you guys still work in the old garage sometimes
imagine waiting years for 10m subs to get the playbutton and end up using it with a lightsaber
Noooo
You guys are crazy those are so rare
I watch king of random too😢😢😢
I like watching the Hacksmith get constantly more ripped as time goes on
I can’t wait to see YouTube’s reaction. “You did WHAT?!”
Im new im suscribe i wang to be un your video comments
Congratulation, guys. Yours work is so inspiring. When I see your work I want to do the same thing. Keep doing new projects I would like to be part of your team. 👍👍🔥🔥🔥🤩
One of the best YouTubers ever
Seeing Grant Thompson hit hard. Please watch your health and sanity. 💛
U ruined it!
OMG CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE KILO RENS LIGHT SABER OMG PLEASE.I love your vids there so AMAZING
He started from making cgi to making simple non-technogicl projects to advance projects and finally to build a WHOLE industries filled with subscribers. Hope that you build something new and creative! Build something that could help the whole earth!🌍❤  you are a real superhero!
Is that okey if I'm almost cryed? I hope u will get a comfortable place to create ur grand goals Thank you for this video
One vid a month that’s enough
destroying a diamond play button for views is like destroying a treasured possession or priceless artifact to look cool
James your  beard game is very strong. Love the beard
youtube be like
Thank hacksmith industries you have been an inspiration to me
In true hacksmith fashion
This is awesome :)
Now this can be my dream job other than being a part time animator
He is jesus . . .
Ahhhhhh    Another great video from my favorite you tuber
Love your content dude, can’t believe your finally here
Oh...... my......... god
But this is your JOB everyone has a job and everyone has to work no one is special, if you choose to make this or anything else a full time job you have to expect negative feedback, everyone who has a job gets it, even bankers get it, no one is special, deal with it, you chose that as your JOB everyone has to work on a daily basis to LIVE, everyone works everyone gets negative feedback.
soooo....is he gonna get another one ......no  ok
Gg this is Really cool man
When Im older and maybe become a Scientist I want to be on your Hacksmith Team. P.S love the videos and progress your making on the channel.
Your an amazing person and have a great team
Almost at 11 million
My engineering learning practically just started and I guess this is also a beginning for The Hacksmith Industries
Here is an easier way to get to the cutting: 12:22
Less than 20 min ago and already 2k comments
HAY QUE TENELOS GRANDES PARA ROMPER UNA PLACA DE DIAMANTE
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS  congratulations on 10 million subscribers dude!!!!! P.S video idea you should make a fallout 4 T-45 Power armor helmet you don't have to its just an idea LOVE YOUR VIDS Keep up the good work!
That’s awesome, but may I suggest a court of owls project from Batman? They’re really cool, and there’s a ton of different versions and tools they use, so you wouldn’t be boxed in to any one design.
Hello I'm french and i love your videos. Sometimes it's difficult to understand you but you're a model for a lot of people. Keep innovating and make us dreaming 🇨🇵😁💪🏼
love ya hacksmith keep up the amazing work
Hacksmith Industries are great and you are great. Keep on creating this amazing content.
You guys are doing great! I love your vids and so do so many people. I hope your industry/company keeps going because you guys inspire others and have a great set of skills!
just keep doing you i don't care if your a single person or a company it's still mind blowing what you guys are creating.
Even though youre the GOAT... you ruined the Fresh prince song for me 😭😭😭  Keep up the good work😎
Grant would be proud of you
YOU GO MAN!!
Im kinda curious how this "business" makes its money. I know they get sponsorships and okay views, but they have a full team they gotta pay. Equipment and so much more
for wht's worth, I really like what you guys are doing. I'm just a small guy entering a big world of adult, and what you are doing is very important to me : you keep me in touch with the side of me that still dreams, that is sometimes childlish but who sees the world as full of possibilities. thank you for that, really. You don't have to be tony stark, you are already better than him
What’s inside the Diamond Play-button, but cooler 😎
As a viewer who watched you grow, I'm feeling proud
You inspire me to be more then a beginer to be a more good  inginer and a more good men . I have the same drem to Chang someting for the Word.  Thank you  I am apreciate your Chanel
Those 23 dislikes , They are evils from hell 🤦🏽 We appreciate and love your Work.We love you James❤️
15:05 THATS a cool playbutton design
CONGRATS on 10 mil James! can't believe I've been here since 200k and watching this channel grow was so awesome to watch!
Lol
Please. PLEASE do a Lightsaber Hilt from the Playbutton Metal!!! It would be so Amazing!
can you guys make an actual sonic screwdriver?
Im shredding tears
I had no idea you wanted to have your own Hacksmith Industries campus and become such a large brand, that's *really* cool.  I wish to see the day too when that happens...
Keep up the amazing work cuz at the end of the day no one pays attention to the haters we all love  the content
Amagin being mean to him bro he has a lightsabre what's not to love
James sounded like a droid in star wars clone wars
Love you James

Diamond Play Button with Original Signature of Hacksmith.

Watching that play button get destroyed is both horrifying and incredibly satisfying at the same time 😆
Who all skipped 😂
The only YouTuber that is willing to destroy their play button for good content and their personal enjoyment James is a legend
Hacksmith Industries is what is getting us to cyberpunk in real life

Respect CONGRATS ON 11 MILL
It´s nice to follow a true professional and leader. Keep up the work man. The idea is bigger then one man.. not everyone gets that. When one work for the bigger goals, sucess comes with it :)
Imagine complaining about a Hacksmith video
Well said, I remember the time you and Ian worked alone in the old garage and look at you now!

From wolverine claws, to real life protosaber. I've been a subscriber from back then, and dang you've come a loooong long way and I'm very happy for you guys.
Not gonna lie. I love Star wars and i love everything you have done. But i don't think melting something you guys earned is doing the lightsaber any justice.
Wow
If you were doing all this by yourself it would take more than months to make all these projects you wouldn’t be able to post weekly, keep up the hard work and your team
Hey Hacksmith team, just wanted to let you guys know that I really appreciate the content you make. Ignore all the negative comments you guys get because you really create some great stuff! I am always looking forward to what amazing project you guys are gonna do next. You inspire me to also create some cool things and keep me motivated.

What about a lightsaber vs tungsten thor’s hammer?
the 80 dislikes are just jealous...
omg
HA! u WONT LIKE THIS COM3NT HAHAHAHA
I love you no homo
Not many would be willing to destroy their play button let alone a diamond play button. The fact you destroyed it in such a unique way is exactly why I watch ur content
Teamwork makes the dreamwork
"You can tell this is fresh because we don't have 11million subs yet" You have 10.8 at the time of posting, it's certainly past it's best before date!
this is...
Mmmmmm give this recipe to YouTube they'll love it
My heart hurts
I love your videos guys cause you make fiction reality!
Jacksucksatlife: silently crying
Well now that diamond play button is a 1 of 1 from the first ever lightsaber
Who else didn’t skip to 12:22?
Dude YouTube gave you the Diamond Play Putton the  ultimate show of respect YouTube has to offer. And your first thought is "hey let's cut it in half with a lightsaber".?.?.?
No one man can hold all the world's expectations on there shoulder so they do what the can for the world. And thats what you did and I respect you for that fact.
Hacksmith:I get a lot of negativity and critique  Me:You’re literally one of the only people that really shouldn’t get any negativity and or critique   Hacksmith please keep it up ur great
HackSmith: *Publish this video 1 day ago*  Subscribers Counter: 10mil  Now after only 1 day  Subscribers Counter: 10,9 mil  +900.000 subscribers in one day  Me:  *Publish a video* Subscribers Counter: 27   Always me after one year: Subscribers Counter: 28 *me* Whooo ohhhh!
“We all die. The goal isn’t to live forever, the goal is to create something that will.”
Man this is really amazing since i am an Old fan so it really warms my heart ❤️

People who lets him to say his inspiring speech: so nice Me:SO INSPIRING AND I WANT TO GROW UP TO BE LIKE YOU!
I was really looking forward to an arc reactor play button Guess I can’t have a cake and eat it...
I have just started watching the "fresh prince of bel-er" and when this parody of the show's intro was launched, I laughed my '" of. 🤣
If you want to make ur own merch store ask Linus from linus tech tips he made his own merch store from scratch
Bro, that beginning speech had me tearing the f up. Have been watching since I was a lil boy and it's really inspiring to see my role models evolve and grow. Keep at it James, your impact has reached many places in the world, even here in Puerto Rico! Blessings to all your future endeavors brother.
Is he the first toutuber to get a diamond playbutton?
Thank you for all of the uploads :)
the fresh prince intro hit different
EVERY ONE WHO IS RUDE TO THIS GUY SHOULD STOP
Why didn't you change the name of the other channels?
I definitely recommend everyone to watch the whole video, it’s more than worth it-
So nice hearing a bit of story, i have been following for a few years and cant wait for the next video. because of you I'm now trying to study to get as good as you. I Love the videos.. Keep it up <3
Are you a caveman now?

Hey dude, you made an amazing channel, things that haven’t been made, started a business where you make whatever you want, and much more. The things you’ve done only deserve respect and anyone who doesn’t see that is either blind or just trying to put you down. We love you and your team and all that matters is that you do what you want to do. Congratulations
Congrats for every thing

bro this is crazy ive been watching your videos since your batman grappling hook video its cool to see how much you have grown.
Hacksmith: I just got the diamond play button!!!   *3 weeks later*  Ok time to destroy it
Model of whats supposed to happen: "We're just gonna slice it in half in two seconds! Like a warm knife through butter!"  Reality: "When the hell is this gonna cut through"
This is the most humble message I’ve ever heard. Thank you for showing the world that needing help is not weakness
I can’t believe people actually give u flak this is the coolest channel on youtube
Congrats on 10 mil subs
Prime society
I miss grant so much 🥺🥺🥺🥺
This first 12 minutes kinda made me cry, and I could tell James was a little bit too, how can anybody dislike you. Love you.
Dude.... you rock. Seriously, you just rock. I love the fact that you're working to take your youtube celebrity to try and improve the world. For that alone you deserve to be called an inspiration to others.
When are u going to finish the power loader
You know James you are amazing and wonderful giving us amazing content that inspires us you and your industry is amazing and beautiful.

The Hacksmith : Mua ha ha ha Youtube:                        :(
Only old people and teen nerds like me just like now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down
I love all you guys
Wow plan 2 is soooo coollll
tony stark if he was the entire x-man team working together( nice beard beast)
Only when he said that the he changed the name of his channel, i realised it. Who else? By the way, I always thought about why The Hacksmith doesn't do as much projects, but I also thought, oh at least the videos are better and bigger. Congrats on 10 mil. Good luck continuing the wonderful videos. Love from Israel 💙🇮🇱
Congrats man you deserve this and ten million more
Can you make a unbreakable YouTube Play Button?👀
I’d be fine if he didn’t make a video every week and did every 2 weeks just so it wasn’t so stressful to have to do it every week when they do stuff this amazing
Congratulations to you and your team
James get emotional❤
*Your lightsaber would truly be the finest addition in General Grievous’s collection*
Only the real ones will watch the whole video and not skip to the time of the cutting

i’ve been watching you since i was in 5th grade and now i’m a sophomore. you’ve given me countless of hours of entertainment and on top of that a mindset of you can doing anything
When do you plan on opening the research facility. I need to start saving up for plane tickets.
It is hart to tell you how you've made me feel it is impossible to say (thank you so much)
Experiment with a pig
Here before 1000 comments
This is so unsafe.	              I love it
Are you guys gonna continue to work on the proto-saber to make it into a lightsaber that fans know and love?
In 30 years  Hacksmith: We built the first fully functional planet! MrBeast: Last to leave fully functioning planet keeps it!

It's almost like he doesn't care about his personal possesions
To the 43 people who disliked this video you have no life and no one loves you

Youtube: who decided to give them the diamond play button when they are still hyped on their new light saber?
Love the fresh prince reference!!!! You guys rock!!!! been here since the wakanda shield video!!
You should make IRL Galaga using drones, lights and lasers
Dear hacksmith industries,  I know you prob won’t see this but I jest want you to know that I have been here from the start, so this vid was emotional for me. You will go down as one of the greatest you tubers and engineer in history.  Love, MC memes

If anybody deserved the diamond button it would be you, Congrats!
Wow! <3 Great video, thanks for everything so far!!!

This is how many people listened to him and didn’t skip to the lightsaber
why
Give us power loader!
It was thanks to this man and his channel that i found a love for tinkering and fixing thi gs and finding out how they work, so in all thank you for inspiring the future generations of inventors and thinkers.
Are you gonna buy a new one of society awards or just leave it like that?
Wait, you are going to destroy your own playbutton
me having not watched the video yet: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DONT!!!!!
Im sorry James you feel this way. I wish people could be nicer. Your content is awesome and you inspire me to build things. When I see your videos I watch them twice seeing if I could try to build them. So, thank you James!
I would love that you comment back thank you and I was a long time supporter for a long time
Dude, we can all agree we really miss Grant.
I love you bro when i get in highschool im going to be a engineer and im going to be in robotics you inspire me so dont listen to those haters so it alright bro love you i hope to work with u when i get older
James: 2x speed Me: 0.5x speed James: So you have chosen death

Hi big fan
How many youtubers worked so hard for their play button and you just said screw it lets cut it in half 🤣
Am I the only one that's not happy😐
What happens if any military had a light saber how would that play out
we need to send this to jacksucksatlife
Been here since you made the first iron man item
I love your videos u inspire me
Electricity bill must be bigger than big ed
When are you going to sell it lol
Love your videos man keep at it !!!
❤️. We love you James.
This kinda reminds me of Iron Man 2 when he is creating a “new element” (Vibranium).
Your stupet hacksmith but osem to
اكو عرب غيري يتابعون Hacksmith Industries لو لا؟؟؟؟؟👍👍👍
Your work schedule is fricking mental.
Bruh, this is like seeing if you can burn 1 million dollars with a magnifying glass and sunlight
I’m dead
Dude min 14:14 the play button looked dope in the blue color
I am scared of hacksmith now
James, I am a long time fan, keep up the awesome stuff.  (If you replied to this  it would make my day)
Super great story and vision for the brand.
Hola creo que soy el único que escribe en español pero me pareció súper divertido el vídeo  y me caen super bien me dan corazoncito plis😊🙂👍👍❤️ y aunque no entiendo casi nada me encantan sus vídeos siempre me hacen reír 😂
Thank you for everything you do♥️
Hey Hacksmith, if by some chance you’re reading this, I just wanna say how much I love this channel and I wanna congratulate you on your accomplishments and hard work. Don’t let these snobby internet trolls ruin your day. Keep up the good work man!
By 20 million subs he will resemble cousin IT from the Addams family lol  (This is a joke not shade)
A part of me wants to see nothing more then destruction. And another part says, please don't destroy it! I mean, what is if you go under 10 million? Do you send the Playbutton back in two seperate boxes?
i feel like your going to end up becoming tony stark on accident
Typically you like... frame it or something... uh... you know what nevermind
Hi
Stuff the negativity. I’ve just started an engineering course at college back here in British-land, and I’m more awed at what you do than ever before
Did i just watched the hole video or there is somebody else with me ?
Here before 1 mil views button
I just got a diamond play button hmmm let's destroy it!
This makes me sad
Hello Hacksmith. I built a mini 1.4 kg magnetic Thor’s hammer after I watched the worlds heaviest Thor’s hammer
This guy and his team legit made a fictional blade of light a reality and people are still hating on him🤣
hacksmith got heart u guys are awesome
If i could do one thing right now is give James a big hug
10:46 when you and you’re 10 million human siblings are mentioned by a intelligent non European: Du gamma du fria intensifies
12:31 SAVED 12 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE
Proud to be 1 in 10,000,000
YouTube: We just sent you that button your not getting another one
and this is u have to make with a present
Bro you made me literally cry.  Keep it up brother.  Your incredible.  You are some one that I look up too.  Thank you for being you and thank you to your team as well for creating amazing content and making a difference in the world. You guys are just incredible.  I'm here to stay and watch you grow.  Love always, bring us together and keep moving forward.
I can tell he's almost crying :((((
and i not saying i subscribed cause of this vid tho
I’m confused? Did his friend die??? Please let me know without being mean
the best youtuber
Tried to see if putting the video on 2x speed would make it look like it was melting faster but it still took forever 😂     These play buttons are very thick and strong
Cool/sad  You broke a trophy that took a long time
Shoot that got emotional really quick     Great video!
how can u cut thru such a piece of memories and archivements
But why, why would you do that?
Keep your head up man. I can hear the crack in your voice. You care and it means a lot to you. Now is the time to do you and stay out of the comments. Your brand will live strong.
1:48 TKOR!!
Love you’re videos but If you want to leave or expand and stop uploading we all support you!
Only youtuber to destroy their playbutton for real Respekt
Dude you guys pulled me out of a derk point in my life and i thank you and your team for the content you guys make and hope the negative comments of people dont discourage you guys love yall and have a good one:)
I think people don't realize how mutch work went into projects when they complain about things and how it comes over to the creator
You really cut this too... 🤣🤣
Screw those 19 people who disliked the video
FiRsT
The play button looks pretty cool like that 😂 A surprise to be sure but a welcome one
How has the Video alredy 633 comments, only like 8 minutes
Wow that’s kinda sad the more I watch

How much you wanna bet after melting it hes holding back tears lol
Cool Video
Man James I’ve been watching you since like 7th grade and I have been obsessed with your videos over the years. You’re amazing and an inspiration. Don’t let anyone tell you differently.
10:45 I’m proud because I’m Swedish
Bro, you are really cool man, but your beard style is bad. Try to shave it with lightsaber
You are an amazing person
Your my inspiration for wanting to become an engineer
I'd just like to say hi
1:22 ok that was cool  Love the reference
I think he should find some type of material that is melt and shatter resistant and then he can shape it like a light saber and put it on top of the flame so they can see the color and see the shape of the light saber. also the heat would pass through the material so it can melt stuff
Love your videos man don't think about the haters! I want you to know that you motivated me to be a engineer!
People who don’t understand how hard he and his team are working are low lifes this guy is amazing he deserves to go down in history as an amazing person
Cool
I am very new to your channel and I have binged all your videos you are amazing and your team is amazing keep up the good work

So this episode we got heart to heart James and kiddy James hyping up about the play button being melted
kinda wanna see hacksmith make something without machines, with metal.
Best YouTube channel ever... ps your shop is amazing
Hewwwwo
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS
BRO WHAT
I’m gonna order mine right now, I am so happy that you hit 10 mil, I’ve been watching you before your captain America shield came out, you inspire me and now that you have over 10 mil, you will surely inspire more people like myself, I can’t wait for your next build.
Who can dislike any of your projects
I ordered mine and I’m so excited
Now all you have to do is make your own flex tape to put it back together  XD
shave time?
"Best Custom YouTube Diamond Playbuttons"
James, you did well, you have a great team now and you have your plan to follow. You did well and will continue to do well. You inspire people to go into science and engineering, there is nothing more amazing that a person can do. Honestly, the people that bitch about you not building everything yourself, they either have no idea on how a business like yours works or just like to take people down to their level. You do you and don't let them pull you down. Kudos to you for wanting to educate and inspire. I hope you do read this one as well and that it gives you some incentive to take the 1% with a grain (or a kilo) of salt.
Love it James, it's great to hear what your plan is. Keep up the good work.
This is the most inspiring thing I have ever heard
All the best recipes have fresh spices and look shiny!!
If the button was sentient and survived the lightsaber, it would probably consider itself lucky, as only the greatest of playbuttons have the honor of destruction by hacksmith
I wanted to wish You luck, but You don't need luck, guys. You have something more important, skills and vision. Keep going, keep be awesome, and be You.
Thanks for what you do!
I have my signed Hacksmith batarang above my computer desk to inspire me - not in engineering, but for YouTube content creation. Congrats on the hard earned and well deserved 10 million subs!
Congrats guys love the content keep it coming! P.S let me know when the research facility is ready I wanna be first in line :)
<3
You are great! Ypu already are inspiring people all around the globe, congrat's on the 10 million subscribers. From Argentina, the lighthous of the end of the world
It's hurt so much that you guys just cut it into half. Otherwise it's typically for this channel
Your team are a group I'd love to learn from. Like if I had the chance I would fly out to you for the chance to learn first hand
Always love your videos!!!!
I love the content keep it up. Watching your videos has made me realize how much I want to be an engineer and how much I love building things.
congratulations on hitting 10 millions! been following you for quite some time and hum you always amaze me lmao so yeah next step: 100 millions!
You guys are amazing well done on 10 million subscribers 😁
Thank you all in this time for your videos
