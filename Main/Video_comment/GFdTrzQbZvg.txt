I'm glad memes prevented me from ever buying anything on wish.

The antifa, antivirus, and Chinese XL shirt jokes are class 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Imma keep it real with you "Mark".  Filling the YouTube Comment section with political bots is not going to cover up your "pdf file" 🚔 records in Florida.
We did get a president in the last election from Wish, Biden
LMFAO.... I sure do miss you guys....where you been???
Hits 1 Mil Subscribers then disappears and is never heard from. =(
consider yourself lucky if you receive some kind of textile when you order a T-Shirt on Wish.
Order a big bed frame. Got a 25 cent necklace
Antifa and BLM are radical communist and terrorist organisations.
Need to do more YouTube content
This is comforting l wanted to order something but didn't have the funds now l feel.like lm not missing out Lol
"Wish is like having Ted Kaczynski as your secret Santa".  Best line ever!
Cure💴Libtardism
The Ted Kaczynski part 😂😂😂
it's the first online ordering site where you have to wish that you get the right product
'if we get 1 million subscribers, we'll abandon this channel for good' mission accomplished
Wish these guys would come back
“Wish. That’s not what I ordered”
You can get a boombox for $20 (or less). Visit a thrift store
I didn’t think he’d mention ANTIFA in any of his videos
“Looks like a Ruth Bader Ginsberg voodoo doll…” Too soon.
Child abuse is not funny!
Nobody talking about that china joke 😂😂😂😂😂
I need a remix so I can bump it anywhere I go, " 🎵 can't poop ha ha🎶"
"Better watch your mouth before I sell you on Wayfair". ****Hollywood and politicians enter the chat****
You better watch your mouth before I sell you  on wayfair 😂
'wish is like having ted kasyniksi as your secret santa'
Sudden F-word is a bummer with kids around.
I'm sorry, was that cheese just a mug full of jazz
I fucking lost my shit with the Nintendo Switch lmfao!!!!!
🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂
The company is called Wish because by the end you'll wish you made better choices with your 3 dollars.
1:14
I love these videos!!!!
lol, funny and well made. But based on my personal experience, the video reflects how much improvement WISH has done in the past year. Long way to go but it is getting there.
You are a liar and a deceiver, there is not a single real deal in your video, you are probably gambling on the stock exchange?
I WISH I was dead.
I actually own that same baby Yoda doll too, it’s a big hit, anywhere I take it people love it
Lol
Nice
“Better watch yourself before I sell you on wayfair...” that was cold lol
I would say it's crazy that wish sponsors the Lakers, but you know... LeBron
*This is the actually product we received* 😂😂😂👏🏼
Lol (holds up mini shirt) “ this is probably an XL in China”
I ordered chick fila from wish and got Burger King
“Where ever Brady goes I go”
Probably an XL in China. Lol
Everyone now knows that wishes don't come true.
"Wish is like having Ted Kazinski as your secret santa" F'ing lost!
I've had so many disappointments with buying things online.
I ordered a Ford F-150 from wish and I got a chevy Silverado.
I ordered condoms on wish and they sent me ballons
Baby Yoda had my dieing
idk if I just got really lucky but man, 90% of the stuff I got off wish was better than what I got through box stores n shit.
These comments are like ordering a well written joke from Wish.
Wayfair joke haha
This is funny as hell!
🤣 “Wish is like Ted Kazinsky as your secret Santa.”
wishing is good, recieving is not, or whatever the saying was.
The way fair joke was on point!
When I was younger and way more stupid I ordered colored contacts from Wish. My mom intercepted it first, thank God, and the liquid it came in burned her finger.
Id wish to believe that you actually ordered off wish
This junk stuff.
Ngl watching this made me actually feel bad for the costumers
Wish - "You can Wish for it, doesn't mean you're gonna get it"
$20 for Mike Evans Jersey.. that still is a sweet deal!!!
🤷🏼‍♂️💫😛🤫🤫😛💫🤷🏼‍♂️
I’ve honestly got a couple of decent products from Wish. Also some stuff I flat out threw away tho. It’a a gamble but not bad I’m my experience.
Antifa and nice don't go together, they are unironic fascist.
The antifa joke is underrated.
Wish are scum.
The joke about the Mentally challenged Criminals of Antifa was funny and so unrealistic because well they are mentally ill.
Probably the be irl lol ive had. Fucking Wish...
Idk even know ehat Wish is but this is hilarious
You havent posted in 8 months! are you okay?
to be fair, it only said XL; that could mean extra little
✊😂👍this is some funny sh*t!😆👍
I legit seen someone order a couch on wish then 3 weeks later post on their IG that it was a couch for fucking dolls 😂
You better watch your mouth before I sell you on wayfair 😂😂😂
I ordered a superman ring from wish, but I got a vibrator
You're the worst stepdad!! LMAO
"Finally, my new Tom Brady jersey got here" 💀
My buddy ordered a terabyte flash drive from Wish. It was actually a 16 megabyte drive that was modified to fake windows into showing a terabyte of storage. They even engraved a bunch of X marks on the chip to cover their tracks. He still orders from Wish to this day.
Brought 15lbs dumbbells and got big bottle dumb bell middle very flat look like it was squeeze
0:42 🤣🤣🤣
Has anybody ever had a good experience with wish?
I ordered a Chevy Malibu from Wish, and I got a 1960 Chevy Corvair with an original 1971 Ford Pinto rear bumper and gas tank.
I once ordered a lamp as a Christmas present for the girl i was dating and it took so long to arrive the relationship had ended a month before
"Wish is like having Ted Kaczynski as your secret santa" lmao
They should get the JD powah awawd for 90 day initial quality, since you only realize it isnt what you wanted when it finally gets there after 3 months
“Before I sell you on wayfare” lol
lmao 1:01 based
Mahk wishes upon a star to become Bradys son.

Mans a pure genius

The yoda voice 😂🤣😭
the odell joke was hilarious 😂
My dad bought an electric blender from Wish. He just got a cheap, plastic, hand cranked salad mixer.  I either buy my stuff in store or from the company's website itself.
I cannot stress enough. *DO NOT EVER BUY FROM WISH* They stole my information and used my personal phone number as their customer support line for a month. All the while charging me extreme amounts of money.... and all I bought was a few phone chargers.
i really really wonder why people use wish or buy from inatagram ads they all BS
Nintendo switch💡
he made that Ruth Bader ginsburg joke a week before she died lol
I sold  both my kids on wayfair and bought a Chevy
MY WISH: Go on a date with Mahk!!!

0:24 I thought my dog was being attacked
I'm from China and I'm missing a shirt... hmm.
I actually skipped the vid 10 seconds cause i thought it was an ad hah
“I ordered a lava lamp not Odell Beckhams toothpick” LMAO
I ordered a Lamborghini from wish and I ended up getting a Chevy Malibu.
"This is probably an XL in China.." I don't even know what to say-
The judge's voodoo doll... I can't She had to ruin the joke!
Is there any  truth to  this?
0:44 OMFG I ALMOST SCREAMED
Ha that antifa joke
How is Wish not out of business? For their false advertising
When you order a Chevy on Wish, they send you poop emoji stuffed pillow.
WISH is a total scam.  They advertise something for a certain price, and when you choose your color/size the price goes up astronomically.  The prices always change, often not until you put the item in your cart, so you really have to watch. My worst experience was when I ordered something and had a $5 off promo code.  It accepted the $5 off and a new total appeared on the screen.  I entered my payment information and hit the "pay" button.  When the page confirming my order came up, the promo code had not been applied.  I tried contacting them online, which was a joke.  There were pre-made questions and answers.  The computerized customer service "person" would ask what you needed and give you 2 choices.  If your issue was not one of them, the only other option was to click on "nevermind".  Somehow I was able to get through after multiple tries over more than an hour, and was told they would email me.  They actually did, but when I explained my issue, they first told me that I had not checked out in a "timely manner" and that my promo code had expired.  Not surprising, considering their prices change within seconds.  I disputed that, and again after multiple tries received another email telling me that my order could not be changed once processed.  Next they told me that there would be more promo codes in the future that I could apply to orders.  Then they told me my order was already out for delivery and could not be modified (funny, since nothing ever came for over 2 months).  I persisted, and finally caught them when they said the magic words, "...we realize you did not authorize these charges, but your product is already out..." .  BINGO!!!  That was the statement I needed to prove that I did not in fact authorize them to bill me that $5 extra.  While they still refused to refund my $5, I had what was needed to have PayPal intervene and get it back for me.  When my item did arrive, it was not as expected, but at that point I was done with them.  I will never order from them again and caution anyone else not to do so!!!
A friend sent me one of your videos and now I can't stahp... You guys ah wicked awesome 😉 😂😂
That's why they call it wish. Because you always end up wishing you weren't an idiot.
RBG joke aged perfectly. She went into a box, didn't she?
The Baby Yoda doll seems like a legit product from Wish. Good thing I didn't invest in that website!
meanwhile they show pictures of the whitehouse  *ON SALE! $4.95*
Looks like a RBG voodoo doll 😂
This predicted RBG’s death only 6 days before she died.
lol the muthfuken lols
I had to look up to see why they're still allowed to be in business, ofc its from china.
1,000,001. Not a million. Bring on the poop jokes.
I got a fucjing chevy ad
I absolutely cannot believe the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission hasn't shut this company out of the US.  How is it possible that we haven't stopped these lying, cheating, scamming fucks?
Kenny kainz be trappin
Sex toys are about the only thing worth getting from wish as long as your not going for legit handcuffs or anything with chains, nylon products are pretty on point.  Also don't trust the sex swings, your welcome.
The fact the baby yoda doll was the real thing that they got from wish is hilarious
I’m too scared to drink during your videos cuz I’m too scared of choking of laughing
The motto of wish should be you wish u got the real thing
398 dislikes all antifa members
I'm surprised you guys didn't pull the easy joke of oil filters (look up wish oil filters) don't order them unless you want atf banging on your door XD
they denied me a refund 2 weeks after i "got" a portable harddrive and they sent it across the country best customer service ever "oh but it was delivered"
“To be fair this is probably an XL in China” had me rolling
Lmaoooo be kind or I’ll sell you on wayfair LMAOOOOO
That's not a brick, that's the new Antifa credit card.
I want to subscribe for the poop.
It's an XL in China... HAAAHAAAA!!
I ordered a lava lamp not Odell’s jr toothpick  Me 😂😂😂 that’s a plunger
The sad thing is, this isn't even a parody.
More 💩💩💩 jokes.
Amazing that a literal scam can get commercials on tv
First time in zebra corner history that hey made a place seem beer than i actually is
So wish told him to do it like that because they know them self what kind of crap they give to the community.
The norovirus joke is sooo underrated 😂
"or ANTIFA is alot nicer about how theyre getting these things into your house" 🤣
"I wish this is what I ordered"
THE VIDEO STARTED WITH A WISH AD 🤣🤣🤣
Wish ads will show a mansion, sports car, and a gaming pc with a little $1 in the corner
Ruth Bader Ginsburg voodoo doll, daaaaamn
“It looks like a voodoo doll Ruth badger Ginsburg”   That didn’t age well
“Antifa a getting a lot nicer at how they are getting these into your house”    That was very clever.
here is a slogan for Wish - 'Keep wishing, cos you aren't getting it!'
What does he mean "Antifas getting a lot nicer about getting these things into house?"
Either this is the wrong product or antifa found a lot nicer way
The online retailer Wish used the FIFA World Cup in Russia specifically to increase brand awareness. Wish is a gateway to counterfeit and non-compliant products that violate the law around the world. Wish is the world's largest attack on legal merchants.
It’s like asking for coke and they give you Pepsi.
Mahk is the male version of Matt Damon.
You better watch your mouth before I sell you on wayfair lmao 🤣 got his boston accent is key 🔑 reminds me of home
Wish probably has earned like 50 jd power awards because they can just give it to themselves like chevy does
I hope this dude has a long nice life, top tier comedian
"Either this is the wrong product or antifa's getting a lot nicer about how they get these things into your house"  LMAO
That's not the worst part. When I used wish, I had my account used for an expensive purchase.
That antifa rock joke was hilarious
I got a winter jacket from wish 😔. Now I’m thinking I won’t get what I ordered
If you remember what video that was from your an og
Can o get an invisible trailer off wish?
“You’d better shut up before I sell you on Wayfair” 😱😂😂
this guy is in a lot of commercials.
Mahk just made my day
Plus it always takes like 6 Months
why is this 100% true hahaha flipping Wish
Mahk wahlberg is voting trump all the way just like mark wahlberg
“Quote from the video WE ALL WATCHED. YOU IMBECILES.”
If I get a male dog I'm gonna name it mahk
they need to give this guy his own show where he just reviews products on comedy central
If this gets top comment I will destroy my neighbors Chevy and video it.
Mahk do the new Burger King commercial with the ps5
OBJ's TOOTHPICK OMG IM DEAD
I love coming back to this channel after like a year and get to watch all these funny ass videos

Probably shouldn’t have made that Ruth Ginsberg joke
Need a new post mahk
Waiting for a new video. Y'all slacking.
I bought a ford F-150 and got a Silverado 1500. Off Wish.com ofcourse
That ANTIFA one got me
I love that they probably bought a Mike Evans jersey for this, that shit is expensive
I ORDERD a laptop. I got a lap on top of a table
GMs new super truck Hummer is out.  Mahk needs a review!
A Chevy commercial was my ad for this video.  I almost spit out my beer laughing...
Tis vifeo won the jd power award For shittiest video ever
You guys are going to make fun of that all electric GMC hummer commercial right ?
I wish you guys could get videos out faster
You aren’t normalising the audio between clips. This is so hard to hear on headphones with really quite one second blasting loud the next. Do you understand?
1 month later they have yet to upload
Ironically, I've never had a problem with wish, and always got what I ordered lmao. Maybe I'm just lucky, or maybe its because I only ever order stupid things.
I died when he said Obj's tooth pick
I ordered kn95 masks on there and it took two months to receive them.
Do a Sunoco ad next time
Well he left my hometown Boston 🌃😡😄 ah
Was sitting’ in a Chevy and I felt something’ heavy.’ Diarrhea . . . Diarrhea.
Hello Mark I think you should check out the video for Volvo VNL I think there is a great lot lizard parody skit potential waiting. Keep up the great work
Wow that RBG joke was like 6th days from being really fucking offensive😂
Ginsberg died just 6 days later.  Damn
Dude I laughed on the floor with the rock joke about ANTIFA they threw a brick threw my car window a few months back it's one of those relatable jokes lol
Surprize , over a million subs 👏👏👏
that antifa line had me cracking up
At least you got something in the mail. Wish orders never complete for me.
Only buy cheap jewelry from Wish and nothing else, their cheap jewelry is surprisingly good and that's where jewelry sellers buy in bulk and resell for $30 a piece. Their cheap $1 jewelry is actually worth the $4 shipping and one month wait.  Everything else is trash and NEVER buy clothes unless you're an anorexic dwarf born without a ribcage (xxxxxxxxl is a US size S)
Did you see the new snl skit? Totally reminds me of your videos
0:30  RIP
I laugh whenever I hear someone unironically orders from Wish.
lol
I ordered a custom hockey Jersey from a shady Chinese company once. When I opened the box a waft of shrimp smell filled the house. The Jersey was made of something akin to tissue paper. I swear half of it dissolved when I spilled Keystone Light on myself either that or I got into another wrestling match with my roommate that neither of us remember (3rd party told us the next day)
You need to do the amazon van. https://youtu.be/rJJNTVy62PU
Looks Mahk got a Toyota 0:30
Oi mark Wahlberg
Wish is a joke lol 😂 I’d never order anything off that
The antivirus thingy... LMAO
I actually got all my orders correctly except for one, the one didn't even arrive at my house
"We lied" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was great 😂👍🏽

I ordered a bit of reform last election. got Trump. gonna try and return it.
"either this is the wrong item or ANTIFA is getting alot nicer about getting these things into your house" lmao
I just ordered a whopper. No tomatoe, actually got no tomatoes
He threw the Ruth Bader Ginsburg voodoo doll into a box, then Ruther Bader Ginsburg died.  Coincidence?
This commercial deserves the JD Powah Aword...
You need a tik tok
Yo.. so what yall been doing with that Ruth voodoo doll lately?  🤔
Can't wait for the pooptacular! The movantik moment vids are some of my favorites
That's great! Do this one next! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoi92mLZPFM&ab_channel=UsWeekly
The fact that the baby yoda doll was something that they actually got scammed on is hilarious
0:45  Fucking hilarious  : )
RBG joke did not age well
i like how the wish letters are just colored pencil scribbles on paper scotch taped to the box
Yikes, bad timing? 0:30
This video teaches you a lesson: Don't order any product from Chinese company.
Well we know what happened to that yoda voodoo doll now😅
Let’s not forget that the LA Lakers are sponsored by this garbage company.
The RBG joke happened just in time 😂
The worst thing I got from Wish was a "mini cactus terrarium"...except I just got a dead, brown cactus glued into a plastic dome. Thanks, Wish.
purple mattress won 3 j.d. power awards. tell me if its good.
RBG yoda reference 😒 can you see the future?
congrats on one million subs Mahk,  guess no more poop videos huh? lol
Rip Ruth gingsbirg I guess lmao yoda
Defund the NFL

When I drink, I drink from my Makers Mahk glass.
This is a fucking good one
I know y'all said "no morh makin poop jokes afta 1mil subs"... But I don't mind pretending that I didn't hear it.. Just sayin Drops some turtles in the box and UPeX it back to WISH.
OMFG that RBG joke.. she died not long after this video
have to say this seems like  theyre usin ur idea  https://youtu.be/I2BDf-JDUIk
That RBG joke was poorly timed
Damn man ruthless
He said that Yoda looked like ruth bader gindsburg a couple days before she died.
“I wish this is what I ordered” hahahaha.
Congrats on 1 mill
Zebra Conner you should do one asking questions to trump and Biden as a reporter for the up coming elections
The irony of ordering a Tom Brady Jersey and getting cheated. 🏈
Plz do a really good Chevy one for 1 mil subs :D
The wayfair joke was funny but that subject is no joke
The RBG joke was interestingly timed.  😀
Keep doing poop jokes!
I guess when mahk names someone they die.
This aged like milk
Wish is a good concept, it’s just filled with scammers
That Ruth Bader Ginsburg joke aged nicely
Hey so you know theirs a new Chevy commercial
Who was the one millionth subscriber?
Wish not only takes forever, gives you a bad order but also on their website a lot of things they sale are marked up. You can buy a candle set on wish for $75... or you can buy the same set on Amazon for $19.99 with free shipping. I don’t shop wish anymore.
“Better watch your mouth before I sell you on Wayfair”. Lol. Epstein didn’t kill himself.
You didn’t happen to hurt that RBG doll, did you?
Ooh that Ginsburg joke aged like milk
you sound like the shamwow guy
Pleeeease bro you gotta do the ask delta commercial
Well the RGB joke aged poorly
The only commercials I won’t skip
That RBG joke, oof, bad timing lol
Wow 1M I was here since 769k
"Mmm, melted face, I have!"
This was stupid!
"I ordered a lava lamp not Odell Beckhams toothpick"
Chevy ordered a Toyota Tundra on Wish and got a Silverado.
That Odell joke is spot on
That RBG joke hits different
Did you use that voodoo doll or....?
You are hilarious! Just stumbled across you and now I'm binging. Love your videos and subscribed
0:30 well that aged well...
its been a long road think i was subbed around 13k subs or something finally 1 million!

Damn RBG just died, the timing
RBG vodu doll..... Conscience I think not.
That Ruth Badger Ginsburg joke was poor timed.... 😂
Well, the joke at 0:30 sure aged quick
Bruh, I think you killed Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Crappy Handling, Every Valve Rattles, Oil Loss, Eventually Totaled.
That Ruth Ginsberg joke didn’t age well
"this looks like a Ruth bader Ginsburg voodoo doll" that came surprisingly relevant surprisingly quickly
It might be a Ruth Bader Ginsburg voodoo doll. He threw it back in the box. Mahk is confirmed the reason she died.
Damn good timing on the Ruth bader joke😂🤣😂🤣
0:30 ooh didn't age well .
That Ruth Bator Ginsberg joke did not age well.......just like her apparently
0:29 This statement aged well
Oof, bad timing on the Ruth Bader Ginsburg joke
Ruth Bader Ginsburg voodoo doll... uff da. 😏
:30  Big yikes now
Too soon on the RBG joke...
Even the background music sounds like it’s from wish
The RBG yoda doll joke is funnier than ever now
RBG joke didn’t age well...😂
RIP The Notorious R.B.G.
I’m literally dying! I ordered a Brady jersey, size small, and it came in legit the size of a horse.
The Ruth Bader Ginsburg joke didn’t age to well 😅
1.01m......+1  :D
The RBG comments strangely prophetic
0:29 aged poorly. RIP
1:14 Hey!!! 😠
This video didn't even age well for 6 days 🤣
RBG voodoo doll. I guess mahk threw it away.
R.I.P RBG
when he makes this right before ruth bader ginsberg dies
U guys are so good with these real life commercials 😂
Did anyone catch that wayfair joke?
0:31 that didn't age well
0:29 RIP Ruth
That Ruth Bader Ginsburg joke hits hard now
Thumbs up for the timing on the Ruth Bader Gainsborough joke!
Way too soon to make a Ruth Bader Ginsburg joke.....
That Ruth Bader Ginsberg joke just hit harder all of a sudden. Lmfao
Oof Ruth Bader Ginsburg joke and now she's dead
Not a single joke misses with this guy. Comedic legend for sure
do a purple mattress commercial
How True always seems to be a scam out there.
0:19 my favorite
what i ordered that 12 years ago?
yess continue the poop jokes
Looks like antifa getting nicer about getting these rocks in the house..omg..lol
It's called wish for a reason, you wish you had ordered from someplace else.
Once I ordered a tv from wish and I got a broken tv that was smashed into pieces
Wow I guess the Chinese are very small people
In here pull it that’s what he said 0:00
I order stuff on Wish and don't have to wait long. Mind you I live in Canada and we have trade agreements with China and more so maybe we're becoming China 2.0?
You're the worst step-dad! You'd better watch your mouth before I sell you on Wayfair. HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
Not sure I want to know what that white goo in the mug was........
Mahk, does Sam Adams pay you royalties for their "Cousin from Boston" ad?  It looks totally based on you.
Im so tired of that smart watch ad
I’ve personally never had a problem with wish except for delayed shipping even then it comes within a week after the expected date. Sometimes came earlier than expected. But I never received the wrong product or wrong size for clothing.
Probably an XL in China lol
Odell's toothpick 💀💀
Honestly at this point, if you still shop at Wish, you deserve to get scammed on their site.
When you realize that the baby yoda is 25 dollars
The OBJ tooth pick 😂😂💀💀
You know why it’s called “Wish”? Because it’s a wish that we can get great products at a great price. Not reality
What? No more poop jokes? But a poop joke is the lowest common denominator and therefore funny across all cultures, genders and age groups. Can we at least have some fart jokes?
Watching a bunch of your videos today I saw references to Stay Tuned, Arena and Repo man! Fuck dude. Love it.
I heard a friend ordered a swedish girlfriend and got some blond dude in ponytails.
“I ordered a lava lamp, not Odell Beckham Jr’s toothbrush”
I’m almost sure this is the same guy who plays Kripke on the Big Bang Theory
As a formal Wish  customer, this video hits home. It's true af
I love how he keeps up with the trend like the wayfair thing or obj thing
What if we want more frank can't poop jokes.
I ordered McDonald's on wish and I got burger king
He has more subscribers than the road had GM cars driving on it
@0:43 I lost it! 😂🤣😂🤣
Odel beckem tooth pick 💀💀💀💀
The Wayfair and Antifa comments killed me 🤣
This is my favorite video so far.
Ruth Ginsburg voodoo doll, lol
Wish is alright as long as you buy inexpensive stuff where you re like that sounds about how much it should cost. Like the interior led for cars are about $7-10. If you try buying it elsewhere like in the U.S. they sell for $20-30. The only catch is you have to wait a month or so since you re basically buying directly from China and cutting the middleman. As oppose to the middleman having them in stock same day.
Mahk how about a video on CPAP you know full of snot in the morning.  You want to burn it not clean it.
Did you know that Wish won the JD Power award for highest non-customer satisfaction rate for 3 years in a row?
I ordered a knife on Wish. 8 months later some guy stabbed me.
I used wayfair and ordered a cabinet set, was very surprised when it got delivered
I remember these guys
You nailed this one. I am still waiting for five items I ordered 8 months ago. Good humor. Thanks for sharing.
I paid for a date night with Aaron Eckhart on Wish and Potsch showed up.........
I bet mark would have to switch his team over to the Tampa Bay buccaneers
Everything china is cheep and crappy. Like its governemt. Fake
yo this guy kills me😹
I've never gotten a bad item from wish because I can read
Wish upon a star and patiently waiting for your wish to come to be.... Jiminy Cricket was full of crap!
“Ruth Bader Ginsburg voodoo doll” had me ROLLING
Hahahaha sell him on wayfair! 🤣🤣
That antifa joke was next level
I got a lava lamp not a obj toothpic 😂😂💩
0:39 "I ordered a Lava Lamp, not Odell Beckhams Toothpick" Lmaoo I wasn't expecting that
0:55 had me dying
I orderd a lambo and instead got a bugatti
He needs a jd power award for not making a poop joke its as true as chevys JDP he said that he was done then did it any way so He needs to get him a chevy JDP Jd power       How many time did i say JDP
The shirt one got me with China
0:44 LOL made my day
1M lets fucking go
Ngl everything I got from Wish was pretty good
Does it really take 90 days to receive stuff from Wish? I've never ordered anything from them or Wayfair
No way I got a Chevy add in this video😂 and I live in Aus we don’t even have them?
We did it
I ordered a load moaner, instead I got a huge sweater, sigh.

If you made fun of the Sam Adams commercials, we couldn't tell the difference because of the voice.
Who gave this man a green screen??!?
Lmfao wish is like having ted kasinski as your secret Santa. Lol
Are you still a pats fan?
Effin Baby Yoda. Grudge match, who would win? Baby Yoda vs. Baby Groot
Lol I don't think enough people got the OBJ joke.
Do the Domino commercials where they come to people's houses and make good on a crappy product.
TRUMP 2020
I'm gonna sell you on wafair hahahahaha
Don't make promises you can never keep. Poop just has to be joked about
I award u the JD POWER poop joke award
225 wish executives disliked the video
Yesss I too have been a #wishvictim, that's why I don't order electronics and clothes from them
Only Chinese that work for Wish dislike this video! 😂
Wish is some garbage! Get what ya pay for
You better incorporate your plaque that’s gonna come in into your pooptacular!! 😅
I ordered a phone case from Wish. It took over 5 months and came in a small grey bag covered with Chinese writing.
LETS GO 1 MIL
no poop jokes
Wish. We charged you. Good luck.
When they said that the baby YODA doll was what they actually got why am I inclined to believe them on how bad it is?
"Wish is like having Ted kaziinski as your secret santa"  ☠
Funny , but sadly SO TRUE !
...ordered a lavalamp, not odell beckhams toothpick.  Damn, not even a week old and you already KO'd him.
Its honestly a crime you only have 1 mil. Not down playing the accomplishment. I'm just saying you deserve way more.
Very accurate
Ya my ex bf ordered Bluetooth earbuds & an external hard drive & got one earbud & an empty metal box with no parts inside it. Glad I never ordered anything from them LOL I was lucky enough to see how hard they suck while watching the ex get a little karma! 😏
Yeah for real fuck wish. I have a 90$ metal detector lost in china somewhere.
I ordered Mark Wahlberg from wish and I got Mahk
I ordered the George Floyd memorial bust and got a plastic bag instead.  I can't breathe.
I like it better when my orders from wish don’t show up Then I can pretend I didn’t get something really good
I died at 1:10
Though I love the video and humor, WISH isn't as bad as claimed.  Granted, you might get the wrong size in a shirt (I have, forgetting that a large is actually medium due to Asian sizes), but I've never gotten the wrong product.  Poorly made ones at times, sure, but what can you expect when it costs below $5 or $10?
The bit about Antifa had be dying.
Congrats on the 1m
0:45 wow they are a lot nicer.
Hello I am kiriakos , check my new songs they are lit! thanks for the support <3
Hilarious
We were so disappointed I’d be turning 18 in quarantine, so my mom bought me a jigsaw puzzle of theater posters over Instagram.   It was a scam. And now we can’t return it. So thank you, whoever made this.
Can’t wait for the Pooptacular!!
the experience. anytime. you shop wish.
Let's be honest you look like you'd buy your shirts that many sizes too small. Lol
Congrats on 1mil♥️
That jab at antifa hahahahaha
You lied?          Good.
I know if you order a flashlight they send you a baffled suppressor. Not Cool Wish!!!
Who laughed at the thumbnail first 🤣🤣🤣

Congrats on 1 million guys!
“You better watch your mouth before I sell you on Wayfair.” Omg noooo😭😭🤣
This one made me laugh my @$$ off lol
No ones gonna even talk about the Odell Beckham jr joke? 😂😂😂
Mahk played a role of stupid that watches fox. and real stupids are hearing dogwhistle from it
Good stuff
Literally 99% wont see this but if you do, god bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day ❤🥺✝️
Congrats on 1 million!!! JD Power!!!
I fucking dare a bot to reply to my comment.
The antifa joke was lowkey fire though 😂
“Frank Can’t Poop”
I know a lady who's bank told her if she continued to order from wish, they would not pay her transactions because of identity theft.   Ama-zon..please stay safe https://tinyurl.com/y4wp79x3
THE OBJ JOKE WAS UNCALLED FOR 😂
I can relate cause i bought a decepticon symbol from wish and they gave me an autobot symbol instead. It took them 2 months to get my order to me and they messed it up to badly
I ordered a PS5 from wish and got the new Xbox instead.
Had to watch Brie Larson pitch me a Nissan just to watch it this.   Least you could do is turn that pile of shit commercial into some kind of skit.
Odell beckham jrs toothpick.... Damn that's cold man. We don't kink shame in 2020.
The poopening...
Odell Beckham Jrs toothpick 💀
I want the yoda
I confirm this is so true with wish ordered a few car signs for my man cave and get my dad his father's day gift and nope false advertising they looked like something for a prototype of the sign. Last thing I bought from them was back when coronavirus 1st hit never again because it came 3 months later. Would have been quicker to go an auto parts store or buy from Amazon for man cave car signs.
Lol

100% Bought all my computer parts from "Wish" as a kinda joke, thinking it's from China how can it hurt?, And most of it were stickers lol with little to none refunds because of Covid-19... Wish is a joke.
I’m mad brady was traded ;(
I was wondering how you get about Brady leaving the pats
Why is this on trending, did you actually pay money to get this on trending?
I ordered stuff from wish since January and it still hasn't came yet fuck wish.
Why the heck is this on trending
Well now I was baby RBG
0:39 I'm dead 💀
"before i sell you on wayfair" omg... 🤣
Wish is probably how Coronavirus got here in the first place
I've been ordering from Wish for years... and it's always a mystery on what I will actually get.  They show a cell phone, high end specs, no other things, it's like $3  WOW, order it, 3 months later, I get a phone STAND, I looked over the whole page again, NOTHING about a stand... Wish can be a joke sometimes, I have other things that ordered and is awesome.. but, that is maybe 5% of my orders...  Something to be  learned... NEVER order USB drives... WOW 2tb, till you put a few GB on and it will get corrupt... Junk, complete junk
I came here for poop jokes and bubblegum. There is no bubblegum.
Love (HATE) the sound the black kid makes on that Wish commercial; “SMART WATCH” “waHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH” 😂😂😂😂
Jesus is alive!!
That Antifa line had me rolling xD
Say you're sorry say you're pooping!
I wish Mahk wasn't a Wahlberg
I wish Mahk wasn't a Wahlberg

Those WISH prices are obviously fake! They allways have FREE* stuff.  *Only pay shipping (99$)
In TEXAS we have Texas Fender butter on Antifa Toast. Only a leftard would play Red Rover Come Over with a motor vehicle.
0:57 i mean it's another way to call it
"you better watch your mouth before I sell you on wayfair"
"I'll sell you on wayfair." Holy crap
Gotta love the Amazon surprise boxes with a "free" something useless. I give the guys at work eyeliner, kitty litter scoops and anything else that will get a reaction in a crowded break room.
Antifa
Never received one accurate order from Burger King, miss the Whopper “my way”. Luv your content brother!
JWish
Embarrassing that the Lakers have Wish on their jerseys.  Pornhub would be more respectable.
Can't wait for the pooptacular!!
Sort of the same reason why I stopped buying from Amazon and pretty much anywhere that’s not a store brand. Too many Chinese knockoffs out there now a days. I’m good...
Superbowl should play all your videos as Superbowl ads
Congrats on the million guys
It's alright. Tom Brady sucks.
I bought a Wendy's baconator from wish and got a whopper
I remember using wish 4 years ago, buying stuff online was something new to me so waiting 2 weeks to a month for a product didn't really bother me. Lowest quality of products I've ever encountered. How do they even sponsor sport teams?
The Wayfair joke😬😅😂😂
The sad part is that’s accurate
The antifa line was gold
BROOO WHAT IS THIS LINK OMG WTF https://youtu.be/PYA66kpc6mA
Liers.
i got bamboozled by wish! learned my lesson.
He shoulda added a joke about how your order will come in 4  months.The few times I used that shit app before I found out about them I noticed the delivery date is always like 3 or 4 months from the day I order the stuff. That shoulda been their first joke.
No fkn way!!! I have ordered TONS of stuff off of WISH and NEVER had this problem.  EVER. Someone is obviously not paying attention when they order. Lame. Lies.
If you are reading this comment:  BE BLESSED!!!  🏵BE BLESSED!!!  🏵BE BLESSED!!!  🏵BE BLESSED!!!  🏵
The OBJ joke 😂 ewww
I think I would order something from wish!
The antifa joke was great
1M good job!!

Forgot to mention it takes like 5 months to arrive.
*This is simple, just order the small shirt to get the big one*
Being honest: exists    Ads: *we don’t do that here*
More like "You WISH you had that Sh!t"
Odell Beckham Jr toothpick 🤣 ahhh
Hey! Congratulations on 1M!  You won me over at "What's a computer?" Lol. Keep it up! You guys are great!
Probably an XL in China😂😂😂
Pooptacular is gonna be just a montage of Chevy commercials
At this point, companies are paying MAHK to not roast them LOL 🤣
Ha! Not far from the truth, but still love Wish! Yeah it’s like the worst secret Santa anytime of the year. You never know what you’re gonna get : )
Wherever there is psychological time that divides, there must be conflict. Is it possible for thought to realize it’s own place in the world of technique and has no place psychologically?

Wait... are there actually commercials for Wish n TV???
I will kill and destroy my neighbors Chevy for a like
I ordered 60$ worth of stuff from wish and never got it, not a refund
I wish you guys would do a commercial for the litter robot for cats. 500us for a cat toilet that just still have to clean up afterwards.
F*ck yea 1 million subscribers 🍻🍻🍻🍻   been subscribed since 2016 the page has grown so much. Best channel hands down
I’m glad you were lying about the poop jokes. I was just about to unsub
Thank god you lied about stopping poop jokes.
Lol. Funny
But we like the poop jokes
90 to 120 days to get a Concealed Carry permit in Nevada. Should have ordered it from Wish.
Follow the Ten Commandments
Colossians 3:8 But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth.
Exodus 21:16 “Whoever steals a man and sells him, and anyone found in possession of him, shall be put to death.
DANG IT!, POOP IN A BOX AGAIN! SO MUCH FOR WISHING FOR SOMETHING AMAZING!!!
Chevy?
Chevy?
Wish must have screwed Mark in some way
Hey Mahk. Your over 1 million subscribers!!!!!! Congratulations!
Literally my last 4 or 5 ebay purchases... wish, ebay is same
Congrats on the 1 mil, guys.  Been subscribed since the first Chevy parody.  Much better value for $0 than that Yoda doll.
"Watch your mouth before I sell you on Wayfair"!  Genius.
what's wrong with poop jokes?
1 million subs!
Arent u coming down too easy on wish? Ive heard some worse horror stories of them messing with accounts and all around just screwing people over financially too...
Lol. You got it just right
As soon as you order something from Wish, Cancel it on your credit card. They provide a no cancel on order policy which violates the credit card merchant service requirements. Wish won't cancel the shipping, however, so you get items for free.
😩wish lol Yoda look the the old Judge lady who falls errday but still wont give up her seat...😂😂😂
Maybe Wish is secretly run Chevy and Pautch?
1 MIL SUBS! NO MORE POOP JOKES :D
Congrats on 1 million subscribers!
Man, I hope Frank can poop. Feeling bad for him.

If you stopped the poop jokes I would have unsubscribed.
How dare Wish... I ordered a Chevy from them 23 years ago and I finally got it today, but it was just a newer shittier Chevy! DAFUQ!?
Bruh YouTube gave me the notification late 🙁
Don't know about you all, but the 'Ted Kazinsky for Secret Santa' had me dead XD XD exploded with laughter! 😆😆😆😆
I just ordered a Chevy from Wish....boy, I hope they mess up my order and send me a Toyota!
RIP poop jokes
I'm still not used to these new looks for Zebra Corner. 😂 Mahk needs to shave and Ali needs to grow the beard back.
Creep it coming mahk
idn't fully understand how morals and morality worked till I read "Juliette" by de Sade. Certain folks just do and be; other folks have to abide by strict morals that are foisted upon them. For a modern day example of what the Marquise was getting into, think about one DuPont murdering an Olympic athlete and not spending a moment behind bars; then remember that another DuPont brother molested a three year old and a seven year old; he, too, did not spend a moment behind bars. Certain people arrange that Great Depressions come about (by repealing the Glass-Steagall act in 1998, a set of laws written to avoid another Great Depression), and these depressions trigger world wars to begin, wherein lots of working class men go off to foreign countries and murder other workers and middle class people. But then when it suits the immoral ones, we work together in our factories and offices. We team up when they want us to, and we murder each other when they want us to, and when they murder and molest children they spend zero moments cooped up.    Read "Juliette" to find out what morals are really all about. If there are no morals for the Clintons and the Bushes and the Bezos and Melany and Bill Gateses, then there are no morals for anyone. Believing in morality is part of the trap.
Insulting chYNA is more funny this year.
“I’ll sell you on Wayfair” LMAO!
Bring on the pooptacular
I just ordered a windows 10 on wish but I got a stupid MacBook pro.
Shit in one hand and Wish in the other.  You’ll get exactly what you expect in one.
Purple mattress made a commercial similar to Chevy showing off their jd power award
The ANTIFA joke tho 👌🏼  #SilentMajority 🤘
I just saw a wish ad a little while ago and all I could think was it should just have people unboxing weird sextoys like from the Facebook ads.
Isn't wish that scam "auction" website that has changed named over the years? Basically you have to prepay into the app to "bet" on stuff and HOPE it ends cheap?
Congrats on 1 mil
Wish is like the autistic cousin of amazon....
Switch Nintendo.
69 downvotes.
A fat like for that antifa joke.
I’ve been with you since the beginning
The RBG and antifa joke was on point hahahahahaha
1:15 I dont think he was acting.
152 HAHAHAAAAA!   Good Comedic Timing 101
congrats on 1M 🕳🔥🔥
The Odell one outta pocket 😭
Is it me or is Tampa Bays football team like a shittier version of Th Expendables
This ain't realistic, it came.
I come for the burgerking jokes
Spot on with everything being a knockoff, or smaller than promised. At some point I had what I can only describe as an existential crisis when I allowed the nature of Wish only ever delivering smaller things wash over me.   It's hard to describe but a sort of terror developed in my mind as I imagined ordering about a dozen items and every one of them somehow being smaller than it should be. Even things that make no sense coming smaller, like a can opener, or a toothbrush.
Pls moar poop jokes
I love all the funny jokes and reactions to the vid's quotes in the comments, but are we all just gonna ignore the "Odell's toothpick is a plunger" quip?
We got the large dog pool and that is literally what arrived.   Funny cuz it’s true Sad cuz it’s true
There's a reason it's called wish
I'm glad you lied about the poop jokes, I was getting worried.
Congrats on one million subs!!!
Everything you showed is totally believable.  Wish is the worst.
They call it “Wish” for a reason ;)
bruh
Lol
Holy shit you did it! Congrats on 1M subs. Well earned Mahk!
Probably a XL in China 🤣🤣🤣
"this is probably a xl in China" bruh 😂
Omg that antifa joke had me dieing
I order a shooting star but got a wish instead. One star
Wish because you wish you never ordered it.  Next those meals you order by mail. With portions that are never wasted. So small you order a pizza afterwards.
I got my JD Power award from Wish. Very satisfied.
Better than a Pelosi video.
I ordered AirPods for 15 bucks they came with wires
Holy shit he posted! Finally!
Yes your back
1 Million congratulations!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wish that this commercials could just stop playing. 🛑 ✋
Aww shit
Yeeeeeehawwwww
You better watch your mouth before I sell you on Wayfair
There's some hot crap on Wish, but I do have to say the fake Razer Deathadder mouse I bought was absolutely fantastic. It was only 15 bucks or so and virtually identical to the original. If you can avoid the crap there's some decent stuff underneath.
Congrats on 1million! Now maybe you can afford some classier material. Just kidding, this ain’t SNL. The old material.
I ordered something from wish 2 years ago and I'm still waiting for it too come, I can't get a refund on it because it's past date so I'm still waiting for it too come and I also got a refund it's also been 2 years since I got that refund
Congratulations on a million
He was tying up loose ends.
Congrats on the 1mil guys!
Odel's tooth pick 😂😂😂
The Wayfair comment 😂😂😂
I just ordered a ford off wish, somehow got a chevy.
Try buying a "fuel element" or "oil filter cartridge" on their and time how fast it takes for the ATF to knock on your door
I mean am I the only one who hasn't had a bad experience with wish lmao I've only ordered a few small things but I have no complaints lol
Wish's lawyers could probably have you get away with stabbing the president in broad daylight. I mean, how the fuck aren't they taken down yet?
I ordered a Chevy from Wish and they connected me to the suicide prevention hotline.
Never get enough. You guys rock.
Either this is the wrong product or antifa is a lot nicer about how they get these things into your house
Since most sellers on Wish is in China, they sell their product with Chinese standards in mind, but charge American prices.
To be honest Mark isn't even taller than average Chinese guy.
You deserve a oscar for that OBJ joke...
Why would you order anything that has the nfl on it?
Yeahhhhhhhhhhh a pooptacular
“I didn’t order OBJ’s toothpick” 😂💀
Wow
This is so true
You should do a wayfair one and when you open the box a kid comes out.
I don’t think ANTIFA could afford the box to put that brick in
Speaking of Chevy. When is the next video coming out?? Are you banned from dissing GM?
Frank can't poop: The second not-coming-out
Thank god for amazon prime
“I ordered a lava lamp, not Odell Beckham Jr’s tooth pick!” I’m crying 😂😂

i ordered a winter sweater in 1st wk of Feb on wish and 5xl just to make sure it would fit, and it showed up july 20th and its skin-tight looks nothing like the picture and cost 42 with after $15 express shipping. and could never get a response about it or money back
If it takes that long to ship 99.99% it’s a fake. Especially jerseys. You go to any sporting event and you can spot the fakes everywhere.
YAY MORE POOP JOKES!!!!!!
Congratulations on 1 million subscribers
I ordered a lava lamp, not Odell Beckham jrs toothpick. *shows a plunger* that joke flew over so many peoples heads
Wish app really is dog shit lmao it shouldn’t even b allowed

“Wish is like having Ted Kaczynski as your secret santa” I lost it at that part😂
where ever Brady goes you go? C'mon man!
What's wrong with the baby yoda doll tho?
Congrats on 1 millions subs! More Wish videos these are hilarious lmao

Damn, all the roasts in this vid 😂

MARK PLEASE DO A VIDEO OF THESE GEICO ADS!!! You know the new ones where the voice over guy start talking to the person? Those are creepy AF!!! WHO LET YOU INTO MY HOUSE???
Wayfair needs to be next

I died at the Odell joke 😂
Because of the antifa comment, I unsubscribed, and resubscribed just to get the satisfaction of doing it again.
Poop jokes are just what I wished for!!!
AHAHHA
I ordered a girlfriend from wish....i got Caitlin jenner instead....
My family is from China and that XL is pretty accurate lol
Someone hacked my credit card and made over $900 in WISH purchases. I sincerely hoped this is what happened to them.
Poop joke reveal as I was pooping. Nice.
I was wondering whether Internet Comment Etiquette or Zebra Corner would make it to one million first.
Either I got the wrong product or antifa is getting a lot nicer in how they get these in to your house 😂😂😂😂
At least it's not like Let Go. Where the guy you are buying survival knives from wants to meet in a Dollar General parking lot at 11 at night.
Never in my life have I been happier that I got lied to.
c'mon wish is just a website for knockoff goods. Getting what you actually paid for is like winning the lottery.
Congrats on the 1 mil
Are you a Tampa fan now?!?!? the Brady love is strong.
I love human you are
I never even recognize the commercials these are making fun of, but they're still fucking hilarious.
You guys have your 1M subscribers. Now can you get off your A$$e$ and crank out at least one of these a week? During the presidential campaign that should be easy - don't pick sides!

The “Wish - That’s Not What I Ordered” slogan lmao!
Mahk you need to do a Sam Adams video
One of these days Mahk should do a video where he goes to a chevy dealership and trolls them
What do you get when you have two pieces of bread ? a wish sandwich, cause I wish I had some meat.
i could watch 1 hour long videos with him
Love the poop jokes.
I ordered a Chevy from wish... I got a my pillow.

Wish needs a *JD Power* award next.

That's why I never order good things off of wish just things like fountain pens and stuff Amazon wont send to my neighborhood
Please never change.    Oh yeah and Frank can't poop.
Congrats on 1 mill

Thanks for giving me another reason to never order from Wish.
Ever see that commercial with the smart watches and the 3 kids acting like anxiety ridden idiots? I hate that commercial, listen to the end, theres a baby laughing at the end too.
Ordered a large shirt on wish they sent me a large bucket of shit
Who else is here from the chevy videos
Did anyone just randomly watch this and now they're addicted
I think that Wayfair joke might go over a lot of people's heads but it was amazing.
0:46 Holy fuck, that’s spicy.
What do we get when you guys reach 2 million subscribers?
You're alright for a Yankee. Keep it up, you filthy animal.
This is the best channel ever. Thank you Mahk!
Holy fuck the rock and antifa comment made me burst out laughing lol peaceful rock throwing
I wish people would open their eyes and see that Wish is the black market and a total scam selling counterfeits to gullible idiots.
Oooo damn. Antifa joke. Nice
Congratulations on 1 million! You guys deserve it!
I ordered a Chevy off wish and they actually sent me one.
Do "If Biden commercials were real life"!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
That shirt is an XXXL in CHINE UH!
Wish is for Chevy owners
After I saw the last part of the video, I scrolled down, and you ARE over 1 million subscribers! Congratulations! (12:13PM ET, Saturday, September 12, 2020)
I keep getting ads for Purple Matress or sheets or something and it has a group of people and a made up JD Power award. It's a real annoying ad and I think it'd be perfect for you
XL in china 😂😂
This is great
Congrats on 1 million subscribers
Wow, if Wish commercials were like this I'd actually buy something from there.
A random comment
I don't get this.        I'm old, or out of touch.     Reach out and touch someone when you have the chance.      Seriously. I don't get this.
This ones good man haha
Be careful about antifa, otherwise you will have blm, lgbqt, djdk, skeortbe, and the binary gang on your case about you being racist and a nazi 😥
Sell you on Wayfair. LMAO!
I ordered Lilly from AT&T on wish and 4 months later ponch rolled up to my house taking about initial quality and making threatening gestures with a blood stained JD power award
0:44 had me dying     no seriously that was the brick they threw at me at the "peaceful protest"   jk🤣
Ordering anything over $15 you get what you get....should also be considered borderline treason since you’re mostly just undermining the US economy to China’s benefit....
HES BACK HES BACK HES BACK HES BACK
Nintendo switch 😂
Good on ya Mahk, screw Antifa!
You better watch your mouth before I sell you on wayfare
>If we get to one million subscribers, we'll never do another poop joke. >We lied  Well aren't they just full of shit.
now do peloton
Ok imma watch this 3 more times now
Congrats on the million subs! You definitely deserve it. Should get a jd powah award
I'm so glad only my friends and coworkers got ripped off by Wish. Say what you want about the Bezos slave industry, but I've never gotten something shitty from their Warehouses of Death & Despair.
I WISH you'd guys would follow us on social media- IG: @im_Mahk & @Ali_ZebraCorner / Twitter: @im_Mahk & @Ali_ZebraCorner / Snapchat: @comedian_ali Merch: https://represent.com/store/zebra-corner
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Love all your videos ❤️❤️❤️❤️
LMAOOO
You forgot the part where nothing shows up.
I saw a motorbike helmet for 50p. (60 cents)  I don't think I need to say any more
Eitherway if you lied or not; I'm Proud I just subscribed about a few weeks ago, keep up the great work
Congrats on 1 mill man
You should the Experian commercial next
lmao
Congrats on the 1 million  subs!!  You fricken deserve way more!!
How is it possible 11 downvotes in first 15 minutes of this upload?  Who are these people???  Love your videos!  And congrats on 1 million subscribers, you deserve it!  Keep it going!
0:55 why in the world would anyone buy Norton on Wish??? its such an intrusive system resource hog application. not to mention it as bad as win10 in selling your history/info to merchants (data mining)
Never heard of Wish
You know Wish is bad when it doesn’t receive a JD Powah ahword!
Finally, wish!!!
about time you guys made some new vids :P
Please **** Right Down Thier Throats
"Antifa is getting a lot nicer how they get these in your house" lol
Way to accurate
Good I’m glad that your back Mahk
I don't recommend Geek either. Not as bad as Wish but still.
haha i like the part where their is a man
I go where Brady goes. Shows how fair weather most Pats fans really are.
I do like Wish but you really need to read the product description and measurements. LOL 🤣 The doggie pool! Super small 😂 Typical Wish.
This is the earliest I've ever been to a video
I’m surprised he’s a bucs fan now 😤
1M subs. unreal.  And JD pawwer is still in business. ha ha.
“To be fair this is probably a XL in China”
It’s good to see you back
Wish.com promotes the selling of garbage and copied merchandise...
The antifa joke was dead on! I hear they also sell flamethrowers.
But Wish still delivers better than mainstream media....
ROTFLMMFAO!! Oh my hell. Dude....this is the best one yet. My entire office was busting up over this

A pooptacular huh? I know just the place:     *TO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP*

We got a legit drone from wish lmao
Congrats on 1 Million subscribers Mahk!!!
Congrats on 1 mil man keep up the good work
This receives the JD powah award for quality.
So, what would happen if you ordered a Chevy on Wish?    What cah could you possibly get that would be worse?
Congrats on the 1Mil!
Hey, Potsch!
I wished for this video.  You're welcome.
Wish: Military grade body armor $50 Criminal: Dang thats a great deal Criminal robs bank Good samaritan shoots criminal with .22 lr    Criminal dies.
anyone that buys something on wish other than knowing they are being scammed and doing it for a video or the memes is a moron.
He called the shit poop lol
Cool
I ordered a lava lamp not obj’s toothpick      😂
"One million subscribah pooptaculah!" -- Mahk
this was too short for me. I want to watch 4 more other videos
Its true
Hell ya keep em comin guys!
Hell yeah guys 1 mil finally! Been watching since 100k love you're stuff, keep it up
The wish executives disliked this video
The poop jokes are great
I have a feeling this whole vid was started as an OBJ toothpick joke
the ted kaczynski line was the best
That Odell joke was shitty
¨Oh I guess that would be fair this is probably an XL in china"
"You better watch your mouth before I sell you on Wayfair"!!! 🤣🤣🤣
POOP IN BOXES!

Congrats on 1million subs! Stay healthy and blessed!
I'm the third person to watch this video I love this channel
I’m surprised there was something in those boxes
