Heard the villain was barely in this movie. I'm disappointed.
Oh look, another personality of Elliot
007 rocks.
He have so cute face to be bad guy
He can play the joker
My name is safin
I think the whole point of the writers not adding more screen time had to do with the character arc. He explained himself as an “invisible god”. That’s what he was. He was a creeping black canvass in the background. Could the movie have pulled it off better? Yes. But that kind of subtlety is difficult to pull off. Especially for a bond movie.
Villan enter home baground song name pls..
this whole bond movie, together with Rami Malek was terrible. Honestly one of the worst. Whats up with the ending, bond has become a weak p*ssy?
I will be a James Bond Villain one day
he did a great job
he just like me fr
Amir mounibI think Rami Malik looks close to Amir Mounib 🤔  https://youtu.be/nap-O4aArEI?si=GjCCweWALB6nb5tc
I think Ramy Malek's face specially in this film is reminding me with the music of X-Files series 😂  00:49 The way of no return😂.. Loose urself😂😂😂.. The tunnel with one openning😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.. My way or noway😂😂😂😂😂😂😂... Do u dare?  Ramy's new film
Rami * Astrid
But how?
We should do a remake where safin is older and retired
Watched Craig's James Bond movies just because Rami Melek's in the last part of Craig's Bond
Rami malek is so gorgeous,   i loved safin very unsettling but so cute
thus movie is shameful part of bondiana saga just like spectre and quantium of solace they can make cool bond villain with rami malek but hes performance was trash
They didnt let him shine
Safin Mercury    Me: That's good name. 😂
Rami Malek is a great actor. It was so freaky when he said that he just wanted to be tidier, almost like “You understand, don’t you?”
Nice one
Rami Malek played an outstanding and demonic Bond villain, very creepy and spooky, probably one of the best, too bad he didn't get more screen time. 👏
Safin be like: put a gun against his head pulled my trigger now he's dead
By far the worst villain for Craigs bond. Most overrated actor ever and worst casting choice ever. Not creepy or scary in the slightest
To those saying he needed more screen time: he had more scenes but they were cut
Best bond villian ever. And the creepiest.
He has the most punchable face in this movie because of those LIPS
I'm not scared of a lot of things, but that first scene with Safin genuinely scared me. He's so unsettling. I couldn't imagine how much scarier it would be if he was actually in my house trying to kill me
Omg, Kenny!!
James Bond is the FarCry of movies.
Love how contrast Bond's behavior when he encounter Safin and Blofeld.   With Blofeld, they both still gloating each other like a child and brothers considering Blofeld's sibling grudge.   While with Safin, we can see Bond's fear since Safin is pure homicidal psychopath who wants to unleashed hell to the world.
the sun come tomorow!
0:40 to 0:52  I am wondering what the name of the theme is I got legit chills hearing it
they rarely showed him and Ana I was pissed
Elliot becomes the head of the dark army
Worst bond villan
I really liked Safin, the way he spoke, his dressing style, but I think they could've fleshed him out more. They should've made his parents more innocent, like if they were forced to make poison. And his goals should've been better outlined, something like Light in Death Note maybe: not satisfied with annihilating Spectre, Safin wanted to kill every single criminal  with the nanovirus. This would've made him a more morally grey character. I mean he let the girl go after she bit him, he wasn't completly evil.
When did Freddie Mercury became a villain?
Criminal the limited screen time he had
I think, another one just bites the dust here
He was great but I would have loved to see more of him on screen. I love that he had the Japanese fetish With  the Noh mask and zen garden. Every Bond villain needs a bit of Ralph Fiennes in schindlers list. That idea of looking into the face of death. That he could put a bullet in your head any minute. A character like that is truly frightening because you don’t know what horrible thing he is going to make you see next.
Sh it film
If Jeremiah Valeska was a Bond villain.
Safin in the 1st Scene was Fire!  It was quiet and he was ruthless. I remember the audience was completely quiet!!
Safin's the most underrated and best Bond villain, he was Madelines arch nemesis as much as he was Bond's and kind of won in the end when he poisoned Bond!
Safin is Ivan Karamazov, seeking to exalt mankind and reject Fyodor Pavlovich's brutishness.  Safin's final speech is a synthesis of the Grand Inquisitor speech.  Dostoevsky understands evil and Rami Malik seems to grasp that the worst evil derives from the pretension of virtue.
Hello there, Friend
Most boring Bond villain ever.
Plot twist: Bond was hired by Whiterose and he was the actual villain.
Safin is just beyond my expectations Tbh I underestimated Rami Malik as Bond villain at first time, but he prove me wrong  He's absolutely great actor  Incredible
Man he was a funny guy at need for speed 2013
I still think like blofelds reveal in spectre satfin is dr No
"Formidable".
🤩🤩love rami malek
Rami Malek is an excellent actor. But as far as his performance as Safin goes, I'm not going to say that he was a good villain. He was just an okay villain, but was ultimately forgettable altogether.  To quote comrade Dyatlov from HBO's Chernobyl: Safin was "not great, not terrible".
I would go to a movie that is all about Safrin!  I was absolutely fascinated by him and I hope we haven't seen Safrin for the last time
Same as Christoph Waltz, very little on screen time.
Great actor great guys   his romantic love story between him and british actress lucy boynton   is a symbol today a predict  a futur politician
Good movie terrible villain his motives are crap
I was laughing at everything he said. The creepiness was fire for me
Post this full movie on this channel as soon as possible
Dang what’s Freddie Mercury doing in a James Bond movie?
I wished that they gave Safin more screen time, because Malek's performance was dangerously and hauntingly beautiful when my Mom and I went and saw it three days ago in theaters 😭
just saw the movie tonight he was phenomenal  and he definenetly made his character unsettling.
Rami Malek for Safin: - terrific - theatrical inhale when    face to face with 007    sitting in Japanese style - Japanese mask - horribly artistic Greaattt ...
Safin scared the sh** out of me...lol..cold, calculating, and he didn't need a ton of screen time because villains can always do their machinations behind the scenes...a testament to Ramy's fantastic acting skills...
Love how the biggest criticism is that he didn’t get enough screentime
he was amazing but I felt that Bond and Safin's fight scene was very anticlimactic and that ending ugh..
He reminds me of Dr No
LOL i prefer him as Freddie Mercury
This reminded allot of the phantom of the Opera at some scenes
Ngl the movie was average. The villian was even more average. Could have done much better job with 25th edition. My disappointment was in measurable after watching it.
Weak bad guy
0:37 squid game
freddie ? lol
Safin is probably the best negative so far. A Blofeld is digging in 😀
wish he kept the mask on until the end
😱💖💖💖💖
Did anyone else see that Dr. No Bust (with needles in its head) in the background of the meeting between Bond and Safin ? Or am I totally wrong...?
Unpopular opinion : Paloma and him were the best characters and Safin shouldn't have died  (Because I love him so much)
I felt his character in, "The Pacific" was more creepy and scary than this.
my Haloween costume right here
Bland villain !
Lyutsifer- Lucifer  Plot- Dna nanotech that affects person its infected with   HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT  LET THOSE WITH EYES TO SEE
Such a shitty movie
Rami did a good job. He was so unsettling, I can’t look at Rami and his characters the same again.   That is a good thing. I was a huge fan of Rami when I first saw him in the Night at the Museum Series.
It would have been so funny if they played Bohemian Rhapsody when Safin died, the "I don't wanna die" part 😂
Idk man, just watched the movie and they nailed his presentation and presence, but the motives and plans were very Dr. Evil-y
Yeah ok I get he’s a villain…. But yeesh he’s a babe
rami's always been an amazing actor loved him since he was in Untill dawn
Spoilers!     I really like his scenes but he was underused.
I'm so proud that billie ellish got a chance to make title song for this movie. She could've done it better
Way too little screen time for Safin
I actually have an idea for a Bond film called Love On Ice but I might change that title instead of what I originally thought of I'm thinking of something new something called love and time oo7. This one involves somebody very close to James Bond and we're going to change it up a little by making it more into a science fiction spy film. But before we make it into a film we have to make it into a story first and it's actually a series of short stories made by a comic artist I hope to meet one day so it will be based on a graphic novel first before it becomes a movie. And when it becomes a movie I don't know if we're going to make it into an animated or live action
In my opinion safin was just Ernst Stavro blofeld reincarnated and in order to remain reincarnated you have to destroy the original.
People don't like him, but in reality, he's safin the day
Half of the film he is not in the movie when he enters he just speaks bs all the time. there is no reason why he does what he does and he contraticts himself multiple times
This video is actually the exact amount of screentime he has in the film
He creeped tf out of me
My skin looks like that. I used to have really bad acne when I was a teenager. Not something I generally think about but geeze it looks bad.
Honeslty I'd watch this movie just because if rami malek
Bohemian Rhapsody 2nd ending
shitty ending.
the next Joker?
Meh
The biggest problem is his lack of screen time…
He had an amazing introduction but was really underwhelming as a final villain, pretty disappointing in my opinion
A boring and long winded villain that only added drag to a slow film. Malek needs another Freddie type to play because otherwise he just sits there like a freeze-dried poodle.
Safin doesn't have enough screentime
After hearing bad things about him from reviews, hear what I thought about Safin.     He was fantastic honestly, as good as Le Chiffre and Silva and better than Greene and Blofeld.
oh man, hacksaw ridge..
Great film, terrible villain. Sorry.
1:12 Safin: *''I made you redundant.''* Bond: *''No. Not as long as there people like you in the world.''* Safin: *🤨 Lmao.*
Could’ve given him more screen time in my opinion, though he’s still a pretty good villain.
I loved this dude's performance everytime his character appeared you could feel his intimidating presence and he legit was a terrifying adversary he lived up to all the hype placed on  him in  the trailers, teasers and previews he did a very good job and his now infamous line " we both eradicate people to make the world a better place I just want to be a little.... tidier" gives me the chills due to what his intentions are the only negative thing is his very few screentime as the movie's villain  he should've had more screentime
Best Bond villain of all time fight me
Best villain ever.
I think, he played in game Until Dawn as Josh... did He Is?
There is a lot of reason to find this man, you've just given me a reason to kill him
For me Safin seems the most dangerous when he got the Bond's daughter (oops, spoilers)... it's really a tense moment in the movie. But he is attractive like a good villain in this moment too.
deserved way more screen time, Bond movies have developed a habit of just giving their villains extended cameos. First Chris Waltz and now Rami Malek, 2 brilliant actors criminally underused
It was better to have used Blofeld as a villain in this movie. He wants to spread the virus around the world and kills all "undesirables" for spectre.
Elliot's hacking continues to say FSociety
worst bond villian ever lol
sunilmotwanibond jamesbond
Fuck him he killed one of the best bonds of our generation!!!
So it is not Freddy Mercury ?
Le Chiffre: *The Poker Player* Greene: *The Bad* Silva: *Joker* Blofeld: *The Cruel* Safin: The *''Invisible''*
Loved this film!! 💜
To me, he was the creepiest and most unsettling of the Craig villains. But I would've loved him more if he had more characterization and screen time to flesh him out better like Le Chiffre and Silva.
Safin was such a forgettable and unformidable villain, I just remember him showing up in the beginning and end. The stakes, though global, didnt feel high at all. Skyfall was far more intense than this film. Such a disappointing ending to the Craig era.
Small kid as villain 😇
Like malek, but he was a trash villain
Rami killed it every scene he's featured in. But the unfortunate part was that if felt really lack of the "villain" of a Bond movie.
Safin is easily the weakest point of this movie. Even Rami Malek's acting couldn't conceal how poorly written this character is. After he gets his revenge, his motives fall apart and stop making any sense. I loved the first half of the movie, but when Safin began to get more screen time later on, I just started looking at my watch.
In my opinion, the worst villain of the Craig-era.  Le Chiffre was interesting because he was a bad guy, but he wasn't a fighter. He was simply a banker who overplayed his hand and got himself into a dangerous situation. We mostly see him on the run from his own people, desperately trying to get back the money he lost, which is why he was a great villain to kick of the Craig-era as it shows how dangerous their world is and how powerful Spectre is.  Silva is another example of how twisted the world of secret agents can be. He used to work for M, but when one of his missions ended badly, he got screwed up. He was angry with M because he felt like she betrayed him and set out on personal revenge. He got on the wrong path while James remained on the right one, showing how much they're alike but also so very different, without it feeling forced like with Safin.  Blofeld was perfectly built up by the events that happened in the previous movies as well as how mr. White described how hopeless James' attempts to defeat him were. He wants world domination, but he also has a personal vendetta against James. The story manages to make him do both these things without it feeling confusing. Also, the way Blofeld puts psychological stress on James was done masterfully.  Greene is in a tier below the other three. He wasn't super memorable but he was a good villain, simply trying to increase his organization's power and influence by corrupt and criminal means. Though basic, he gives you all you want and need in a Bond villain. Safin is just all over the place. The 'we're alike but also different' thing with James felt super-forced. I understand Safin's hate towards Spectre and Blofeld, but then the love he felt for Madeleine was a bit more questionable. While all of that isn't so bad, his goals are. He sees himself as a god but wants to kill millions of people for no reason and his actions never have any form of justification to them.
he was an enchanting villian
The hacking skill of elliot cannot surpasses the MI6 tech guy (Q)
Thank god I didn't saw this scene coz I just watched it last week open minded and by god did I loved it so much. Probably the best bond movie and best bond Daniel Craig is way better than Sean connery
*Dude... after Jaws, he's the Bond villain who really freaked me out. His psychotic look and that he has nothing left to lose to get revenge is tense. Rami Malek's incredible performance. I expect more villain roles with him.*
1 minute 26 seconds, huh? So about the same than his actual screentime in the film. Got it.
Ive got to say I was so intrigued by Safin great villain
He was underutilized in this movie.
Rami have a kind face for a villan but it could be a psychopathic personality developed after certain life disaster , trailer not enough to judge
Really wasn't a fan of the movie, just did not make sense. I feel like it was almost rushed.
Weak villan unfortunately, not Rami's fault.
Frightening, or affected?
he needed more time on screen
Snafu becomes Safin
this red suit after money heist caught all villains eyes.. no time to die , squid game…
I literally cried after watching  NO TIME TO DIE.  THE BEST BOND MOVIE HIGHLY  EMOTIONAL.  WILL BE MISSING YOU CRAIG...
Marat Safin.
Can anyone explain why Safin let Mathilde go? It was a good scene, but it confused me.
shit villain . underwhelming
freddie Mercury played as a Bond villain.
Rami Malek has been cast in some cool roles.  He plays the Bond villain so well.
Rami Malek was not the typical villain but oh my god he was brilliant. He was as he says ‘unsettling’ the way he spoke and moved made you think what is he going to do next. Great to see him go from Night at the Museum, To Freddy and now to this! Epic.
Rami will always remind me of his character "Mr. Robot" Just how Daniel Radcliffe will always remind me of "Harry Potter" No matter how different they are being portrayed in other movies.
This villain  was no threat at all. He only poisons bond with nanobots lol wth is this G.I joe or something ,  easily the worst bond film since quantum of solace
He wasn't in the movie enough
«Mamaaa…Just killed a Bond”
I like Rami Malek but this was not a good villain, he was barely in the movie
Safin also known at the sailfin lizard
Sounds Iranian
I’m excited for rami Maleks performance but I think they should have done another film with Christopher waltz because they squandered his performance in the last movie and he seems like he was born yo play the role of a Bond villain.
Safin was more like a Horror Villain, he was really creepy. Good Job 👍
Safin is one of the weakest and most laughable "villains" in the entire franchise.
I can listen to Safin talking for hours. Love his voice. (edit: and accent)
one of the worst bond villians
God I love rami
Freddie Mercury wants revenge.
The first time I saw Rami Malek like this. I was genuinely terrified.
Prettt craap villian in my opinion. Not much screen time.
Want he want? He only want to ride his Bicycle!
Worst Bond villain ever
It adds to discrimination when the only time you see people portayed in movies as burn victims they are crasy/murderers/criminals...
Malek's voice does different this time around as the villain. Must be his accent.
0:12 Revenge? Hmm. I wonder what for.
Safin looks like Eli Mills from Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom
is that it?? the bad guy is Freddie Mercury?? this movie is soooo british
LOVE YOU MAN SO HANDSOME LOV MYSSELF IM ANTIGOD LIL BAD VERSION ME DR EVIL XOXO
hello wose side me god destruction new kind ASSASIN S[ECTRA KNIVE LUCIFHER SAFFIN GOD ANTIGOD ANTIME END BEGIN GOD SPECTRE DAMN LOOK MIRROR  HELLO LE PHANTOM TIME OPERA BURN faster BOND INTELIGent killing perfect assasin LUCYFTER SAFIN TIME CRUCIFY BOND XOXO BLOFELD LOVE YOU MY ANTISON WIND DEATH SAFIN XOXO
This is why Rami Malek would a great Riddler or Lex Luthor
I absolutely love rami malek and it's nice to see him as a villain especially in james bond my favourite he's gonna be a great villain can't wait to see this
Looks like Elliot Alderson is doing pretty well after taking down the Dark Army.
Craig will always Rule  as the most  Realistic Bond Period !
and another shitty james bond villain
OMG My name is also SAFIN
Mr. Bad Guy.
Le Chiffre: *Wealth* Greene: *Power* Silva: *Revenge* Blofeld: *Torment* Safin: *WE WILL WE WILL ROCK YOU*
Out of all the villains we need a villain to push bond to breaking point and safin is his match
Lyutsifer Safin, not a very subtle form of Lucifer Satan, is it? Something tells me the name is supposed to suggest he's evil.
Safin is Dr. No
Mr. Quimper
how do you know what works with safin why he wants to kill bond why he wants to do his safin has he received orders from madeleine or bolfeld so that safin wants to kill bond
Hello, Elliot.
I feel a thanos whiping half of the world plot coming
his full name is Lyutsifer Safin like really....?
"He's going to kill millions" - oh, so not an anarchist at all then.
Safin attempted to kill mr silver
I certainly hope he's more complex than just  "My daddy loved you more than me, so i've been the author of all your pain."
Finally playing God without permission, I see
my name is safin
Rami Malek! 😃🙌
Safin is the good bond is the bad
#ReleaseMinamataInTheUS
I love the trailer soundtrack it so good and faced paced
I.think Safin is Dr NO
Craig is a hard case.  He could be a real assassin.
there is a thing with bond villains having scars and skin disorders lol
It is completely deplorable of MGM/AMAZON to file a copyright complaint over the Goldeneye levels on the Far Cry 5 arcade. They should know better. It's a quick way to piss off paying customers who they NEED in order to keep their studio afloat. They would do well to remember that we have all the power and they have none. Without us wanting to see their films to they are out of . Greedy Jeff Bezos needs a swift kick in the ass.
:44  Safety-suited technicians working among glowing rods in a large pool of water. Also, there is a large circle on the floor of his lair.   He’s playing Doctor No.
Rami should have played the next bond
Yeah, this is Dr. No
Safin is the guy who visited Swann's father when she was upstairs and then she used the Magnum from under kitchen sink and blew half his face. Thats why she hates guns.   Theory
bruh after watching casino royale, Daniel Craig's voice really aged, kinda missed it since he's kinda old now with a croaky voice

Hello friend
Remi Malek is such an awesome villain. Can't wait to see this.
I would like to see James Bond go up against Thanos.
the indian variant will cause another delay
its gonna be delayed again just wait
When exactly are we going to see this movie !?¿!?

I can't be the only one that totally forgot this movie hasn't released yet lol. This video released in Septermber teasing April 2021 as the release, here it is May 2021 and STILL nothing lol
Can't wait see this film
THIS MOVIE GONNA SUCK BECUASE I HAVE NO TIME TO CRY!
Unsettling, Yes! I'm just hoping he gets to an actual challenge.
Remember when he was the Pharoah from the Night at the Museum films?   Yeah, he's really come a long long way since then, hasn't he? 👍
Safin is creating a virus  in order to slow the effects climate change and to reduce population he is doing that... "To make the world a better place"    So he is basically Bill G....tes  lol

So I guess this would be the last good bond film before the redundant female version comes up
The next movie looks like a good place to go back to the less "serious" nature of old 007 films.
April 2021?
Will it be in cinemas this April? Or is it further delayed. I’m dying to see this.
yo, any other homies commenting in 2023 waiting for this to come out in a few weeks?
No time to die. The movie that never comes out.
Plot twist Swann sends safin to kill bond.  0:26 -0:32
Booooooooooooooooooooring omg. I'm sorry I suggested the guy.
Bruh, theres always a new bad guy, and bond always wins. Make something original ffs
He seems weak and lacks charisma. The last villains of the Craig era haven't lived up to the brilliance of Mikkelsen and Bardem.. K Waltz was very disappointing, even Amalric was more compelling in Quantum of S.
Remember when this was gonna come out?
I love, villainy..my true hearts desire. With in it, "Hate Anger Destruction Malicious intentions" all the true ingredients to make a full grown Psychological killer.. With no Remorse,
Looking forward to 2023 when this movies comes out
Blofeld, Goldfinger, Scaramanga, Le Chiffre, Mercury
S T R I C T L Y here for daddy Rami
He should be challenged to A.I half man half A.I..
Hi! I won't be watching this movie. Have a nice day. 😊
I wonder if we will be able to see this film.  Ever.
ewwwwwwwwwwww. This looks terrible. What is it supposed to be, kingsman 3?
I think he might be one of the best villains or the best. He was great in until dawn, what an actor.
27 / Mar. / ‘21 - _Just release this already._
Hello Elliot
公開が楽しみです♥
Even though this might be the best bond movie in a while, I still feel like Rami Malek's career is just getting started. I am so excited for what he does next.
Looks like eliot became white rose
I'm very hopeful that it will be better than the gigantic piece of shit that was Spectre.  Such a huge disappointment after the crowning achievement that was Skyfall.
He gives me   the creeps
Saffin is Dr.No

Jesus loves you❤️
..meh.. TOO MANY "super villains" in past 3 films
So when is this movie going to be released? Come on, coronavirus, get the hell out of our way.
Rami as Safin looks like it's easily going to be the best part of this movie. James Bond, yet again, just seems more like a perpetually angry and miserable Russian henchman or a grizzled Norwegian fisherman with a nark on.   And this whole thing of the Double O section being some sort of SAS special forces assault teams again... eugh. That's NOT what Bond's meant to be! The Double O section is not even specifically about being "assassins" as everyone seems to think now. Most of the time James Bond was a SPY... sent to investigate things. The fact he becomes embroiled in something bigger than expected and ends up forced into a situation where he is the only one who can stop something etc, is all part of the fun. He isn't just straight up sent anywhere to take on armies of armed men kitted out like a special forces soldier and using military assault techniques like that. The whole point of Bond is that he always ends up way over his head and out of his jurisdiction, but as he's trapped by the villains in certain situations, he's forced to destroy their operation himself.
no time to release
Can’t wait to see this in 2027!
I can only see him as josh from until dawn 🤣
I’m not a fan of him as a villain tbh

This movie is going to be fucking crazy!
Next Bond movie titles 1. "Time to not die" 2. "Die another time" 3. "Can you just die already"
Bond: Safin, i am not your-  Safin: MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
He Wants To Break Free!
Josh? I guess he's still not over Hannah and Beth...
Many comment that they believe that safin is a relative or fiance of the blonde girl (madeleine) but i dont think it is her husband or brother since there is a video behind the scenes where safin chases madeleine when she was a child, and safin was an adult at the time, so the question really it would be is , what is the age of safin at the moment of the movie?
Anyone know the meaning of the name Safin - no?  Here you go  https://www.kidpaw.com/names/safin
I wish i can see this in cinema i havent seen any bond movie I n big screen
Looks like a good villain but I could really do without that accent...
I just know this guy from need for speed 😑

Secondo me sarà molto epico!
🚫Is there anyone suspect Vesper Lynd still alive ?  The movie, Casino Royale As for Vesper betrayal, I have been thought this once, but haven't responded it yet. So, i am currently riding a bond fan fiction with a friend of mine where Vesper will be alive, faked her death (her doubled was the one who died in the elevator , a lesbian who would have done anything for her) So the real Vesper escapes with Mr.White , as he leaves with the money, going downstairs to meet with her.  Why do you think Gettler pulled Vesper inside the building, why s she was bleeding? Because she wasn't the one who was bleeding.

Alternate Reality when Roger Taylor and Brian May did not accept Freddie Mercury into Smile (Queen, starting 1971) due to his teeth and facial features. He wanted to break free so bad he made his own organization to prove that he is a hero, in his "own way" for himself.   Just something that came in my mind!

Hype a manetta, dai daii💗
Aprile tanta robaa
So is Safin borrowing Thanos' idea?
While I'm sure the actor is talented, I'm kinda bored with the whole "saving the world through sacrificing others" shtick. It was an interesting concept in Watchmen, it was new, the villain did actually end up saving the world. Now, that's just every other villain, Thanos, Kacellius, Valentine, Brixton, and so on.

Looks like a great movie, and a good way to end the 007 franchise
I think he's the best villain of all the time
Don't stop him now
Ok im soo excited to see this movie. But this film is much much inspired from mission impossible movies and doesn't have these elements of james bond moments
Double O *Safin* anyone? Hmm... Is it just me or does his name seem more like a play on with ‘007’— aka, seven/Safin)?

I do appreciate the archetypal evil aesthetic of deformity, the handsome knight vs. the evil ugly and deformed sorcerer. But James Bond films lean so heavily on that and I think it may have actually hurt some people who have the same qualities.

Is it just me or Safin looks like one of the characters of Until Dawn
Yes I finaly got to see a bond I wanted ,since the best movie die another day bond went to shit thank you for the super villian and the world in danger plot that's bond not that straight shit from Russia with  love and sky fall sucks ,and those two Dalton disasters ,bond needs to get back to over the top like moon raker ,spy who loved me and probably the best bond movie of all ohms.
Well the movie got pushed backed.
I already see him being in my favorite Bond villain list
Is this the real life......
Safin is Dr No, and madeleine maybe has change her name to can escape from him, and her real name is Teresa “tracy” bond’s wife in the books. So probably this become a mix between Dr no and at her majestic secret service
Movie plot: Freddie is pissed that James didn't come to his tea party so he is out for revenge. He also has a room full of cats he will pet as he waits for Bond to break into his secret lair
Not as long as there are people like you in this world - 007

Spoiler: He will turn into a vampire
Rami is awesome. Guy made it
They should have made more of Daniel Craig's depictions similar to the first depiction in casino royal. I think rest were a bit tame. We need more in depth storylines, substance and mystery not just action, stunts and nostalgia.
Potenza di fuocooooooo
Grandi emozioni quii

I won't kiss ass like the most do, i think this James Bond is going to be disappointing and bland. Daniel Craig is considered best bond because Bond he played had edge was imperfect and even tho he wanted to save the world he didn't care about others, this shows him differently like a one dimensional character, also when someone is explaining you why the character is frightening you know he isn't going to be.
only going to watch it for rami, tbh.
et c'est quoi le sujet

Freddie mercury should just stick to music imo
Good luck besting Javier Bardem. Skyfall is one of the most remarkable bond films I've ever seen. The cinematography in this one does look good I'll give it that, but can Silva's story be matched, that's the question.
Spoiler: Safin dies at the end. (My guess will be correct cause James Bond story is predictable af.)
When you see that your name is olaying the villan role😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/BhxkPm3LmjE
Rami malek will win the Oscar for this. This will be the best bond villain we've seen in a long long time
Meraviglioso!!
He came long way since 24 series.

No mater what his plan is, I am sure Bond will fail it. I have confidence on Bond.
Looks like a barf bag movie -Bond has outlived the stories and become a computer generated, ridiculous storied, laughable piece of crap. Juvenile minds will love it, adults not so much.

Yassss  Rami !!!!
After watching this guy in Mr. Robot, I'm very curious to see what type of energy he'll bring to a more  antagonistic role.
Elliot alderson after beaten dark army
It seems from since a few movies ago, Bond is always up against men under 30 with bad skin and an odd accent. Add not very attractive women to make nonsensical statements in a overly dramatic tone.   What happened to brilliant stories and babes? Now it’s just a run-of-the-mill action movie.
Meet *Dr No
Music director: Hans Zimmer
Worst casting 🤮🤮
I hope the pacing of this movie is slow 🔥
Bond, just killed a man. Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he's dead
idk if any leaks or spoilers have happened one way or the other but for some reason i feel like Safin is Dr No, for the Craig era's bow out. full circle etc
Tennis fans were probably so confused
I am sorry but I can't unsee Freeddie.
love 007
Actually my friend and I got to see the film. He worked as an extra.. and the movie is EPIC MASTERWORK. The biggest film in the franchise ,darkest as well..  Oh yeah he is Dr. No

You keep on teasing! I might have to risk COVID!!! It looks just that good 👏🏽
:O
100% he is Dr.No. The Noh mask is the biggest clue to this. I reckon Dr.No will be his nickname given to him by one of the characters or other Spectre members, perhaps even Blofeld himself. "they call him Dr.No because he always wears a Japanese Noh mask". It's more than a little cheesy but I am fine with that. In a way I would prefer them not to reference Dr.No at all. But hey, that's just me. If you are hoping the opposite, that's okay too.
you guys realize this is the same guy that directed every episode of season 1 of true detective.
Should of used bill gates as the bond villain. Biochemical terrorist at large.
Àaaaaaaaaa..... Ramiiiiì 😍😍😍😍
Bond, Don't stop him now.
Does he make anyone else think of Dr. No or is it just me?
https://youtu.be/lpSGIGw6Z0Y
Rami malek playing rami malek
I hope movie theaters are open in November or James Bond next movies is going to be "NO SCREEN TO WATCH"🧐
Somehow I didn’t realise Fukunaga had directed this. That, at least, is in its favor.
Oh elliot... You've become like white rose
Give this man another Oscar
*Okay, Finally James Bond talks!!!!*
He want some adderoll :D
Marat Safin?
Hope by the time of its release date movie theatre here in the philippines is open so that i could watch it in a big screen

I'm pretty excited for this. In the past couple of weeks I rewatched all of the Daniel Craig "Bonds" as well as some of the Brosnan ones as a warm up.
Bro pink panther was my childhood make more!!!! Please
https://youtu.be/QeO-AnPsxWw
Jesus, are we still at this "I wanted this villain to think he's a hero" trope? Thank God Tenet didn't go into that route and just stuck to the old Bond rule: villains are assholes, the end.
Rami❤️
Wack
Sarà epico!
Che hype assurdoooo
I dunno he looks a bit too boyish. Like if you tidied him up a bit he would be boy band material.
This is not Bohemian Rhapsody, but James Bond.....
just bring it to streaming already.  NTTD is DOA anyway and belongs straight to video/bluray/streaming.
"Did he take the Pills"
Always new Marat was a bit of a hot head but he really seems to have lost it after his retirement from tennis.
Dr. No
Another revenge story? So creative.
Safin just wanted to rock you..  He will he will rock it
Very flattering to have the same name as a bond villain
JAY-Z is God in the book of Apocalypse / Revelation. I know this because I have the name “Jesus” on my thigh. Read Revelation 19:16
Hope we see some bond gadgets 😍😍
I guess to be a BOND villain you must have some kind of facial anomaly?
Imagine : suddenly  mr.robot  awakens in the middle  of the movie  All : doomed for many reasons
Villain is comingggggg
Basically a Scaramanga reboot. "Come, come mister Bond, you enjoy killing just as much as I do".
Hello, Elliot
This movie looks awful.
Davvero inquietante e terribile!!😏😏😏♥️
Sarà un grande villain!!🔥🔥💣
Now freddie mercury become evil
Meet Safin, the Russian former World No. 1 singles tennis player. Oh wait... that's Marat Safin!
I was thinking is Dr No being reanimated this Safin has a real Dr No feel to him
tell safin to upload this movie for all to watch
Make the world a better place 💪🏼 NO TIME TO DIE #filmmakingismypassion
0:03The name of the mask that safin wears is "Okame" in Japanese. It ’s a dancer ’s mask
Wow life outside of tennis has really caught up with Safin 🤷‍♂️
I hope Safin ends up being a great villain. There is potential. Rami Malek is a talented actor. The first time I ever saw him was as a guest star on Alcatraz, a very underrated show. Several guest stars on that show have had successful movie careers afterward.
Ля , Тоня точно оценит
Safin is 100% Dr. No
Safin first word in the movie :  "Hello Friend"
Can’t wait to see this movie
castle on the hill
Safin...is a Russian
Seeing Safin is just like Josh Washington aka The Psycho from Until Dawn due to both characters who wear a mask and play by Rami Malek. I will see more about Safin's story, past and personality on film as an explanation. I feel intriguing and exciting about it.
Stand User: Safin Stand Name: Under Pressure Stand Ability: Automatically performs counter-espionage against lecherous superspies of a British nature.
My is safin
dude rami malwk is amazing and i bet he's gonna be an AMAZING bond villain
its hard for bond to beat safin because bond can never go up against the queen
Safin seems to share interests with Billy the Gates.
Новый злодей - татарин? Обязательно пойду 😎😎😎
It's above my expectations 😍
From what I see, I think the secret weapon is a damn gas bomb. You can see the scene where Bond is surrounded by people, they fall one by one
I think he’s plotting a global purge, and creating clones of himself
Rami is an amazing actor! Very intrigued to see him as the villain!
Ou yehahaha sisisi gododidi
Che hype terribile.. manna miaaaa
My name is also Safin
His villain looks rather weak in characterization.
think ill pass, the new bond films havent been doing it for me. This teaser and the trailer further confirmed its not for me. Looks like it was shot good though
It's SNAFU
Year, still remember how he beat federer in 2005 on Australian open
I'm so hyped for this I pray this is not another film that ends up on a streaming service theres no question this HAS to release at Cinema
These shot are just incredible
Safin is madeleines half brother bc in spectre bond asks Mr.white who he needs to protect. Bond asks his wife, son, and then daughter. Could Safin be Mr.White’s son and possibly be Dr.No
We need another movie after no time to die 😭
Safin`s evil plan is to flood the world market with expensive Koi Carp.
He is part of Evil Corps now. That's where he ended up at the end of the show.
this film is gonna suck ass
Reminds me of bardems villain. Talks so calmly and seems quiet but also feels like a old friend of bond who is very dangerous and smart like bond himself
U mean Dr.NO
Maybe Safin is Dr No lol
Tanos: Another copy cat...
His name is Safin. What does he want? Revenge.  Really? Bond villains don't care about world domination anymore? Craig villains are all about revenge all the time.
i miss sam mendes practical effects, it seems to be so much digital vfx in no time to die
Sarà davvero potente!!
Pazzesco eheheheheh!
Mi aspetto tantissimo da lui!!!
Last bond villains are all great actors but unfortunately don’t deliver I hope this time Craig goes out with a bang!
Woke     Time       To           Die
È il marketing ceeee
Ottimo attore!!
If you get hurt, hurt em back     If you die, walk it off 😂
I can't wait!
Hey Elliot, how's your sister? Take care of her
Volo.vass
Io volo nella caccassa
Che grande hype!!
12 novembre 😍
Man how does Remi make those scars look seexxyy
Hype disumano!! Anfiamo xue aviene!!
Woooowwwwww, First tym I saw a movie trailer for a villain....
Do you expect me to talk? No Mr Bond I expect you to Ayyy ohhhh
L'hype è veramente colossale!!
Why all these plot lines and villains always predictable and corny 🙄😫
As frightening as a kitten
Hype da vendere al mar marrixo!
I think Madeleine is going to die
It's really unfortunate that movies like TENET & NTTD and many more has to struggle to earn billion $'s which they are rightfully deserves due to pandemic.
Ждём !  ! !
How is Safin NOT Dr. No? The suits, the lair, the worker’s in hazmat suits, the accent. It’s all screaming Dr. No to me.
Shit movie, James Bond is not a soldier, he is a spy/detective/assassin not a bloody SOLDIER
They better let my boy Rami malek win!
007 IN THE LAST 20 YRS WERE JUST TOTALLY SUCKY! BROSAN WAS A JOKE  THIS ONE I DONT KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!! CRAIG NOT TOO BAD WHEN HE STARTED BUT........................................ YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE
Another Billion Dollars in the Box office ? 🤞
Nice. But he’s no Kanaga....
Come on, he is just Joshing him ;)
As far as hoping and so wanting this movie to work and be great, I have a feeling that this is going to be a disappointment in one way or another. I think a more grounded way is the best way for this and the franchise.
Bond : No Time to Die Safin : No time for Losers
Plot twist: Safin is in fact another of Elliott's personalities.
I do believe he is Dr. No
ohhh mr robot are you again high?
I want a bad guy Bond can fist fight. I’m over these super smart nerdy bad guys. One thing that could have made spectre more interesting is if we got the reveal that Dave Bautista was Blofeld instead. How bad ass would that have been!?
I just want to be a little tidier
I'm excited to see a Craig-era villain that's a little unsettling and scary. I've loved all the previous villains, and as dangerous as they were, they always managed to laugh and joke around a bit. Satfin doesn't seem to mess around! Looking forward to this! Seems like a fitting swan song for Craig!
You mean the guy that is almost definitely the reboot version of Dr. No?
Puro hype disumano!! Svengo proprio!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Eiaculo dal sercios
Micidiale nuovo villain!!🔥
Waiting for mission impossible ❤️❤️❤️
Il mio Endgame...
Well this is gonna be shit. Make them like the old days
Oooh  siiiihhhh

Tanta diva intensa, adoroooo
Puro hype al cioccolato!! Io svengo qua....
Panino hype, non riesco più, scoppip nella grande attesa infernale!!
Mr Robot vs James Bond
Marat Safin
I will watch this movie cuz of rami malek
Mission Impossible Fallout ascended to the tippy top of the spy movie genre' mountain, and it appears the Bond folks took great exception to that. Look for No Time To Die to make other spy movies seem anemic and uninteresting.
Epico è dir nulla!
Veramente pazzesco!! Sarà grandioso!!!
Fotografia bellissima!! Sandgren un vero mito!!!
Evil man with scar face
Adoro tremendamente!! Sarà un film pazzesco!!!!
Svengo malissimo.....

I want to see Bond as soon as possible.
he reminds me of pattinson, pattinson reminds me of him.
L'hype sta esplodendo!!!!😏
Hype monumentale!! Dai che ce la facciamo!!!!
Questo novembre godrò come non mai!!...
Mega hype Puppato!!
After Rami Malek's spectacular acting in Bohemian Rhapsody, I really cannot wait to see him acting as the bad guy in James Bond. Really cannot wait for this movie!
Il più grande film di 007 della storia! ♥️💣🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
Great villain!!💣
12 novembre !!
Hype mostruoso!!
Davvero un cattivone! Non vedo l'ora di vederlo in sala!! Mi aspetto uno scontro epico!!!!💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hype epico!!
Epicc!!
Jaws was bond's most terrifying adversary cause that man was unkillable and his steel teeth could bite into anything.
Safin looks like an immortal villain creepy
Do we think Safin will die ??
He has all the makings of a classic style Bond Villain, as good as Craig's outings were i must say he had some rather dull Bond villains. Even the guy they cast for the modern take on Blofeld (which everyone saw coming long before Spectre came out), he was a great choice but seemed to be lacking something i just take think what that was. But Rami Malek has it.
Bond's lines do not sound like James Bond.
И целого Бонда мало...
Meet the Spy
Rami Malek as a new Deadpool? 🌝
We nearly saw entire film through the trailers 😳
25일🇰🇷 개봉 이정권 언젠가는 컬러시대에 텔레비젼으로 이곳에서  접함  스카이 라이프 (위성안테나)  진화 컬러텔레비젼 ~ 지금에 명칭 바뀜?
i thought it's a part of the movie when rami describes his character!
Wow, this actually looks like a pretty scary Bond villain for once!
I do not owe anybody anymore thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Was he the fully naked guy on Need For Speed movie?

Until dawn?!
Seems like he's some kind of evil genius, mastermind kind of type
BETTER MARC ANTHONY JAJAJA JAJAJA
tbh he doesn't really look scary or have that natural "villain" look even with all the makeup. however, I'm open to being surprised.
Theory: Lashana Lynch's character is the twist villain, spy vs spy
Last chapter of James bond and I love all the parts of it huge block buster movie James's bond
Super can’t wait 😊!
Claim your “Before Million Views Here”
Dr. No
I saw the thumbnail and thought he was a youtuber in a movie and then I realized “oh yeah this is a light good actor”.
You said that you won't let Daniel Craig get an easy ride on this. Make his final ride the hardest. Mr. Malek.
Rami malek is my bae
rami malek is too handsome to be a  bad guy.lol
Nothing like production commentary to remind you that they are all just actors reading out on set.
Stunning visuals!
"History isn't kind to men who like to play god."
what is Mr.robot doing here?
Ooh oh getting interesting in here
Now mr robot evolved , as a villain !!!
Bond vs Freddie Mercury
What I like about villains is that they think big & have big plans.  Heroes typically have no plan apart from stopping the villain.
NO TIME TO DIE RELEASES IN THEATERS IN USA NOVEMBER 20th 2020  & AUSTRALIA with UK SUNDAY NOVEMBER 12th 2020
I stopped my job because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Yeah that's Dr. NO
Looks like Dr no smells like Dr no.... Are just another diabolical mad man that James Bond will put in the cemetery
okay so is he the Golden Gun
I wonder if he's really Dr. No.
This is SO GOOD.
Mr. Robot ?
This Bond movie is gonna be awesome.
Jeee Freddy Mercury ...
Im getting a Prince vibe from Rami, love it
I am so ready for this! Rami is going to be an amazing villain & I’m already in love 🥵😍🥰🤤😈😁
The worry of this movie having unnecessary politics/ideologies/agendas forced into it aside, it does look well shot. The action scenes look like they'll be fun, the theme song is pretty Bond esq, Daniel Craig seems to be at his a-game in the trailers and Rami Malek looks intriguing as a villain.  As long as the writing is actually good and they don't ruin Bond's character like other movies seem to do with male leads then it should be grand. At least let the writing be on par with Casino Royale or Skyfall.
He sounds a little bit like Dominic Greene
The visuals look appalling.
Giving James Bond an dangerous adversary makes great for an actual storyline plot with twists and turns that keep Bond fans on the edge of their seats  !!  🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥👍👍👍👍👍
Bond Against the Covid 19 Maker
Can’t wait looking forward to seeing this
My boy Elliott...
It will best acting of rami malek after javier raul silva
Just because his hands are now visible and looking realistic, I´m still convinced Safin is Dr No.
Bonsoir Elliott
Mr. Robot 007
Connery best bond ever
It feels like Bond will die in this one.
I’m just glad Daniel Craig is getting another one
I'm so proud of rami with how far he's got with his acting career. Such a humble, kind and genuine guy like him actually deserves all of this. Well done Rami!! ❤️
Bad acting from Rami 👎
Hey Josh
Will miss you Daniel ❤️   RAW
Is it me, or did Daniel Craig's spoken delivery sound a lot like Timothy Dalton's here?
I can see Lingard be the new Mr. Champions League when he hits his peak in 10 years time Hala Lingardinho el legenda
plis sombody tell me what he sed in 1:12
Why is Freddie Mercury a Bond villan.
So basically he’s bond-level thanos?
Voice of Safin = Voice of Gaara from Naruto :3
What if, 007 return to the roots in the next film ?
The two movies which we should not miss this November is no time to die & black widow
https://youtu.be/rjvYRiZvm3M
I think Javier Bardem is the most terrifying as Silva
But I'm now need to watch mr.robot
If safin isn’t Dr No I would be shocked.
I stopped my 9-5 with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Am I the only one who came here by watching the description box of total gaming😊😊
He remind me of trevelyan
Plot twist: Safin is one of Elliot's alter egos
Aspettative sempre più alte!!
He's gotta be Dr No.
In the end he will die
Mr robot loved you
I can't believe Raimi Malek be play main villain in James bond that awesome can't wait 🙌👏👏👍⚡💯 Rami Malek is great Actor
Spoiler Alert James Bond My Sweetheart  He is my Hero ♥️
Is this a horror movie?
Rami Malek has had my heart since the motion capture in Until Dawn
NOVEMBRE ♥️🇮🇹
I’ll catch it on Netflix eventually.
Best bond movie ever 007
Sounds kinda preachy. I hope Rami can work that accent.
*hello friend*
Safin 😏
Tanta roba!!
I would not mind spending $30 to see this 😂😂😂
Is it November yet???
Le Chiffre- bloody tears, Silva- dental teeth, Blofeld- scarred face, Safin- skin condition, Dominic Greene- bug-eyed Frenchman.
Please cast Rami Malek as Doctor Doom.
Safin looks to be the best villain since the likes of Alec Trevelyan and Max Zorin.
safin : hello friend
Bond has No Time To Die! Rami Malek looks great in this role
Rami Malkek is already an unsettling person; this is just cosplay for him at this point. lol
Iam Fleming wrote James Bond as being 007... just saying! I will not be watching this movie. The producers should be ashamed of themselves!!
Is safin Multiple personality ?
End of the film, Bond says 'No, (as in Dr. No) Time to die'
Safin is Dr.no
DONT CARE THAT HE IS A VILLAIN  JUST WATCH TWO LEGENDARY ACTORS  RAMI MALEK AND DANIEL CRAIG
Scarface
1:01 want that jacket! 🤩
When I look at safin, it’s remind me twilight movie. That’s why he the most dangerous person in James Bond coz he is vampire 🤣
Safin is Dr No
Is there a james bond movie without nuclear weapons?
James Bond: Double O Safin
I guarantee he will be revealed as Dr. No by the end
Omg cooooool
AAAAAAAAAYO,...O7
Sator, Safin..
I have a belief, that this will be the best Bond movie ever created!
oh no not another enemy after revenge...so lame
Bro I am so pumped for this movie I can’t put it into words
won't be in cinames this november
The best Bond villain’s (I think) are the villains that are mere images of bond.
Rami malik not that intimidating. Le chief was scarier.
Yea, I really think he is Dr. No. So many callbacks and hints to the original Dr. No movie in the trailers and title we have seen so far. And Rami Malek looks like the original actor. I also like how they are focused more on developing the villain. I don't need more back story on Bond. Bond movies should really focus more on the villain and their evil plots and how Bond stops it. It would be easy to bring back the original Dr. No storyline into modern day as he is trying to disrupt rocket launches to take control of space.  Le Chiffre and Blofeld were all brought back to the screen from the original novels with Daniel Craig's Bond run. Why not Dr. No? As a longtime Bond fan, I wouldn't mind seeing old villains come back and mixed in different stories. The original Fleming novels and characters were the best ones. If James Bond can be recast so many times, why not the villains too? Bring back Oddjob and Jaws...in the same movie so we can relive our N64 Goldeneye multiplayer days.
Freddie Mercury vs James Bond
The last shot of Rami Malek/Safin. He looks so Bad guy :D
Relise eppo
I am sure that this Saffin is actually Dr No, would be so amazing if they went in that direction
Is it just me, Or does everyone believe that Daniel Craig is the most Elegant Bond of all??
Mr robot against James Bond. This will be cool
SNAFU!
Elliot's 3rd personality
And finally Daniel Craig speaking some dialogues loudly in James Bond franchise...😁
oh no... barbara broccolli(in the credits).  so many stage names in the biz but nobody told her to change hers.
I'm a simple girl I see rami malek I click
The reader eraser is stalking me, I'll get it first he really dangerous but I'm may be more dangerous than him winks
Note how the marketing team states 'in theatres November' with no indication of the year, not only here but in all the publicity material post lockdown,  thats clever (even though its clearly implied to be 2020), it leaves room for a further delay of at least a year. If a major market like the UK goes into a second nationwide lockdown anytime soon then no time to die won't be coming to theaters in november 2020.
Love this
What's sunny delight ?
I’m starting to think Safin is the guy that Madeleine was talking to Bond about on the train in ‘Spectre’
Ay-Oh!
why does it need to have the modern day fast and furious feel to it? It's not necessary!!!
Jesus, can't stand Bond's pompous words and exalted tone. This is ridiculous to me!
Okay I think it is time to stop watching any tidbits of this film until I watch the full film
Bond: History isn't kind to the men who play God.
hello friend
SoB some times calling it safin sometimes. Go figure
With that look as Safin, I think Malek would be also menacing enough to play a Batman or DCEU villain
Very (the world is not enough) vibes
Bond vs Mercury
These themes seem a little cliche for  a movie in 2020
He looks like a Bond villain. It must be a Bond villain... and stuff.
I think this is the NEW WORLD ORDER   And Safin wants to do that with his "misterious technology"😨
Isn’t it messed up how we identify villains with facial deformity, and isn’t it disgusting that Hollywood is allowing this gross stereotype to exist
Mega hype!!!
Bond is Bond.. No one Spy movie Can't beat it.
I born in November.
“Not as long as there are people like you in the world” Damn, I’m so hyped for this!
Rami Malek is a very talented actor and I'm sure he will do a good job, but when are we going to see the end of Bond villains with facial deformities? There are real people in the world who look like that without prosthetics or make-up and they shouldn't have to put up with this in almost every single Bond film.
Gonna call it right now: Christopher Waltz will still be the main villain regardless.
Plot twist : he is the Bond's son...
this already looks far better than Spectre.  Craig could easily do one or two more films.  maybe this run of no time to die will leave him wanting more after finishing spectre.
This villain is even more evil than the previous ones. The next one will be more evil than this one, and the one after that will be even more evil, and yadda yadda yadda. Bond films are so fucking stale good god.
Madeleine: I've already lost everyone I ever loved.  Bond: wtf?
His evil plan is to spill Sunny Delight on everyone’s James Bond videotapes
Oscar for cinematography is sure
This character is going to be just like Sylva and blowfeld some sort of soft spoken weird looking guy. these modern bond movies are basically the same and always disappoint. They're cashing in on nostalgia. Guarantee you the plot will be incoherent. I miss the old days of the Connery bond where it was a straightforward spy film with good humor and imaginative action sequences that didn't take away from the overall plot and make bonds seem like  some kind of Star wars hero.
How sure are you on November release ?
The top 1% of the top 1% better watch their backs
The fact that we already know who the antagonist is before seeing the film is bad enough let alone a full character run-down.  Keeping the 'bad guy' secret is far more mysterious and intriguing.
is madeleine will die?
So looking forward to seeing the Bond film. Looks more action  packed...
how to meet ?
No Time To Die but Tomorrow Never Dies so just Die Another Day.
I screamed so loud after clic to watch It!
Glad to see the marketing is leaning away from wokeness. We don't want these messages shoved down our throats in escapism fantasy.
Why does he wear the mask?
O mio Diooo😍
Yeaaa.. like the last James Bond movie ,he kills 100 people and doesn’t even get hit by one shot !realistic? Of course!
This is going to be the most James Bond film of Daniel Craig's series
It would be kind of cool if Bond was a spy again, not a superhero.
The odds of Idris Elba taking on the 007 mantle have increased with the Star Trek Beyond actor now having a 10/1 shot in the betting to play the next James Bond. ... Discussing the matter last year Elba said, "James Bond is a hugely coveted, iconic, beloved character, that takes audiences on this massive escapism journey.  Time has come to make a change.🤔
I want to love bond but the trailer felt so generic- I’m tired of the same disfigured villains, bland love interests that pine for Bond and are wanted by the villains in some way. James Bond is getting old, he’s nearly retired, he’s retired, he’s called back from retirement. I’m just not convinced even with the changes made to modernise bond with PWB involvement and new female roles that it’s enough. For me, mission impossible is what I wish Bond could be, each film although part of the same family of films feels fresh inventive and fun. On the plus side, no one does music, action and cinematography like Bond - I just wish the bond films themselves were more worthy of those elements.
I think james bond dies and they replace him with the new girl which is not going to work and we wont have any bond movie for a long time then it ends with daniel craig returning acting as uf he'd faked his death   Ur WeLcOmE
didn't know freddie mecury would be in this
TODAY'S JAMES BOND MOVIES ARE WITHOUT IT'S REAL CHARM, INSPIRATION AND REALITIES.  ONLY SEAN CONNERY AND LATE SIR ROGER MOORE STANDS MOST WONDERFUL AND TIMOTHY DALTON IS ALSO OKAY, AFTERWARDS DEAD, HOPELESS ONLY
Safin is the older son of Mr. White. From another mother. I know that because my brother works with the editors
Oh damn
👍🏻
The villain keeps getting smaller with every new movie
safin 0:44 Bond: History is not kind to men who play God!
Tough task for Rami Malek. He has to compete with Mads Mikkelsen & Javier Bardem as the scariest Bond villain.
Is it true this received a poor test screenings?
Amazing👏👏👏👏👏
Rami is incredible. Absolutely pleased with this casting choice.
Please be a great film. PLEASE BE A GREAT FILM!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0inQSKaUocI
Awesome actor  Mr.Robot ❤️
The reason why Safin is the most dangerous adversary of 007, its because he is going to give him a real Bohemian Rhapsody with the most powerful weapon: an eooooooo.
Love u bond!!
I'm calling it, he's Doctor No.
I thought Spectre was a huge disappointment, but that's also due to having misaligned expectations, not fully comprehending that Bond was taking a change in tone and style after Skyfall. No Time To Die is already going to benefit from this as I'm no longer expecting it to be the gritty and grounded movie that Casino Royale was praised for.
"and what does he want?" "HE WANTS TO BREAK FREE!"
Hi Safin
Rami malek is too good..
After 2 movies now its time to saving world again.
Music at the end:    Dada!..... Dada! Me: Baradarada!   Music: Dada! .............oh!
Safin is..... Dr No.
Kudos to Rami
Freddie Mercury meets Bond.
The name is bond, James bond  Fans hit like pls
Of all the birds that Bond could have porked, he had to pick the blonde that has connections to every super terrorist on the planet. Oh James ,  your choice in women sucks.
Mr Robot... turned into Rose...
I wanted to meet him in april. But the good luck i'm gonna meet him in my birthday 12 november
Can't wait for the movie in the cinema
am i the only one still hoping and wishing that he is Dr No, i mean i wont be hugely disappointed if hes not, but if he is, oh boy are we going to another level.
when rami malek spoke i thought michael jackson was speaking😅
Being RIGHT never secures POWER.  MIGHT IS RIGHT.  CHOOSE POWER.
Low T Doctor No
I don't like his acting style
Director: Safin is wearing a No mask. Wow, he's so random.
Don't worry Rami, you ARE unsettling.
I can't un-see Elliot Alderson!
So this is what Elliot did next
i notice that the franchise has quietly swept the "wokeness" under the carpet after the broadside of backlash they got the last time...
Safin is definitely Dr. No. The room at 0:06 appears to be inspired by the room with the tarantula from Dr. No (the film)
He looks intense, can’t wait
SPOILER:   He dies of AIDS at the end.
It seems like Craig’s acting in this one is better than Spectre already.
Bond will not die in this one for sure
God, I hope he’s not her brother or something...
Just my opinion and acknowledging that  Malek is a good actor. For me, based purely on what I see in these clips, Rami is kinda terrible in the part. Not every actor is right for every role is one of the fundamentals of casting. The accent he decided to go with certainly isn't helping.  Anyway, hope the film proves me wrong and it turns out great. Very long time fan of the series.
Cary Fukunaga is a Genius
I am excited about this character and this film. Roll on November 2020 for No Time To Die :D
I AM SO READY AND HYPED FOR THIS!!
NO TIME TO DIE, I Meet Safin.
Why is he oozing the vibes of Timothy Olyphant's character from Die Hard 4.
Safin is covid.
I still wait for Marton Csokas as Bond's villain
btw dear bond writers: next Bond: Corporate espionage & traditional mission (no more retirement stuff for at least 10 years)
Damn Mr robot got outta hand quick.
That wide angle shot of him shooting into the ice 🤩🤩
Okay, this movie's cinematography alone is building to be some of the best Bond I have ever seen.
I saw Drax.
"James Bond has to adapt to that" meaning he has to look younger than 62
This is the thing I wanted, James Bond saving the world, the classic trademark of Roger Moore and pearce Brosnan films, now finally adapted by the very own Daniel Craig....
Dr robot arc wherein Elliot is bond villain
Can't wait to see this iconic movie at the same time will miss forever daniel C
Plz upload all movie in Telugu
At the end, Safin is defeated and Bond wins. Sorry for the spoiler.
This James Bond feels more like "I'm an Avenger, I'll stop you for the greater good" than the one we were used to.
Everyone's speculating Safin is really Dr. No. You're all in for a shock when he takes off his shirt to reveal a third nipple, and it turns out he was Scaramanga all along.
I am ready to se James Bond kick Safin butt and win
I was worried he would become another annoying bad guy like Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther.
Bond's first Arab villain. I think.
Not sure if this movie will be good... but Rami is an excellent actor so hopefully
Zzzzzzzzz
Yes, I can't wait until it comes out
this has got to be better than spectre. damn, that film was a boring disappointment.
Too excited for this Bond film because I'm 110% convinced that Safin is Dr.No. "Dr.No, Time to Die!"
glad to see you again, Eliot
Too many stunts spoil the broth.
Dr.no?
Guess Mr. Craig changed his mind.I vividly recall him being done playing Bond.Quote:Not at all. That’s fine. I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on.  Great.So we get to see this drab, depressing take on Bond again.Why, again? Is it truly THAT difficult to find someone new who might actually, y'know...WANT to play Bond? Fucks sake.
Looking forward to NO TIME TO DIE...
I've nearly finished binge watching Mr Robot so this just looks like Elliot's having another episode... witch acne.
Plot twist: Freddie Mercury is Safin...
how many bond films will have the word die in the titel ?
Dr No
November? Ummmmmm ok
Is safin C or something
Well he’s no blofeld
I think we will get the full movie in pieces before the movie releases.
All these trailers and content has someone not edited them together to get some sort of scenes and a some of the movie???
00:54 is that Mr. Fukutu from Casino Royale on the left?
ELLIOT WAKE UP
Can we please please get a good Bond game with this movie?
Please, bring John travolta as next bond villain, he even asked for it... i dont know why you guys waste that oportunity.
I have a feeling that he will be one of the best antagonists in the series. And he kinda reminds me of Dr. No. Maybe he is him? 🤔
Calling it right now. Safin will be the best Bond villain thus far.

HOLY COW! HE....IS....CREEPY AND AMAZING!!
The feeling of Nostalgia is so strong here... waiting for this film
His full name is Lyutsifer Safin guys! Trust me, reliable source. Taschen confirm it with the pre-oder of the brand new edition for The James Bond Archives.
This is increasing looking like an actual Bond film.
but is he Dr No?
Everytime I see Rami Malek, I remembered him as Akmenrah from the "Night at the Museum" series and Freddie from BH. I can't wait to see him as an amazing villain in the movie.
Joss💥🔥
I’m ready for 007 to kick Safin butt and win
Long overdue
Continuing the marketing when the film wont release in November
அருமை👍
Safin is already scary.
Tzeims mpont for ever

Hi Safin, selam Rami :)
He's likely to get under Bond's skin.....
I'm so hyped for this!!!
Biological warfare it is. Inspired by Drax from Moonraker no doubt
