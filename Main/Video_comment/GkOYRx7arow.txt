I use to live in North Dallas and Oklahoma City until I decided to leave the place. We moved south east amd ended up North of Tampa. We have been through a lot of hurricanes. Both tornado and hurricanes are descructive. The thing that really scares me is not the weather itself but people panicking over supplies. Our recent hurricane here in Tampa is feels like the end of the world. The shelves were empty. There is really no safe place to go.
Man i remember working at mcondalds here and when the tornado hit i closed the window immediately. Such a crazy moment, and the front door windows broke while everyone was panicking,crying.  😅 thought i was gonna die
dude.
Very good 👍
wow video
i went to round rock it was the same bank and walmart
Did anyone find any money blowing around?

This is going to be more and more common as there is less land that is not urban,thus higher odds of something getting hit.
I e been there before and we are going this weekend😳
Bien x malditos
i know it may sound unrealistic, but a tornado came through my home :(
Another catastrophe and you're still going to have to pay taxes covid-19 the most evil thing done in the history of our lifetime you think this should be considered a major catastrophe cuz I do and what does it take to consider something as a major catastrophe so we could be exempt from these BS taxes
my apartment is right behind these buildings and my job is on the other side of the highway. it was terrifying
While someone just casually stole a TV
All these storms have been prophesied.  Storms have been happening all over the world.  Almighty GOD is getting ready to make his move in exposing the corruption from the demonic political elites lucifer clan  in trying to control the world.  Almighty GOD is powerful.  Tsunami, earthquake,  tornados, fires will continue to happen.  Listen to the Prophets on YouTube.  Keep a watch in New York Statue of Liberty, & some monuments in Washington DC will be destroyed.  Keep praying 🙏🙏🙏.  The enormity of what's coming is Biblical.
"global warming is not a real thing"....only lived in Round rock since 2007 and we have never had one...we have messed up this planet
Looks like God with drew his account.  in God we trust he is extremely 😠
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others.  But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted".  YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them, or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents, up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me, and keep my commandments.  If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land. AND WHEN YOU PRAY DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. BUT WHEN YOU PRAY, GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need, before you ask him.  This, then, is how you should pray:  Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.  For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.  "Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway", we can use google search. These are the teachings, The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God. REPENT, and start doing what is right. If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.  Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. GOD IS SPIRIT, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.  In the New Heaven and the New Earth, only Righteousness dwells. May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all.
Alot of people are trying to figure out whats going on. Really. Im sure they know a storm came by
Still no Twin Peaks report BAH
How do Texans think Jesus favours their state when they get all the disasterous ‘acts of god’ that nature can throw at them?
We live less than 5 miles from This area We are very blessed to have our home and we are praying for everyone who is displaced from the storm.  This storm/ tornado was the worst weather that we have ever been in, in central Texas since 1997. Prayers to all
Please God take care of us.
Black mirror vibes seeing all those people with their phones out recording
Thoughts and prayers ! Global warming isn’t a joke
Ask in Jesus' name, and God will answer, your prayers only took me 47 years to get it right, oh, and you might want to make sure your heart is Wright, with God, 😉 may God bless us all

Thanks for keeping us posted 😉👍

Live about an hour away. So so scary waking up from a nap hearing a tornado siren and my phone blaring. We were so blessed to have the storm just barely miss us to the east.
