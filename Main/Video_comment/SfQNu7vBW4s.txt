As someone who study's anthropology (human history) the pyramids where built with a mix of well paid laborers and slaves that the laborers instructed
I accidentally missheard when daz said "i love incense"
That wasn't a window cleaner they were installing a an ac unit 😅 but still don't get paid enough
Clams need to breath as well, so by pulling the dirt to create a seal you can see where the clams are because a breathing hole will appear in the sand.
you should see me at mine
11:28 also straighter than me
2:11 my dad worked at a Libby Glass outlet!!! I think he was just moving the glass onto trucks though I don’t know if he worked with the machinery.

Ask her how long someone has to dead before it becomes archeology instead of grave robbery lmfao
I love it. Caption: "Installing an AC unit in an apartment building can come with complications..." Daz: "The windows look like s**t!"
Fatty
1:08 *me doing things not really paying attention to the video* "what if you messed one up?" "What is new on Disney plus?" *wait hold up, oh it's an add*
Bro my girl loves you I’m sad
5:47 "HI IM A SHOUTY MAN"
Love me some daz heard you were sick hope your feeling better never get tired of watching daz watches or daz games go daz go daz go daz
The most frustrating thing is being the only one who gives a shit. The rest of them waddle about collecting a paycheck. I just feel like if everyone put in a little more effort into their work. No matter what it is. It'll have a domino effect and things will improve over time for everyone.
daz daz daz baz baz baz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry, but the first video is a no go, they missed spots.
The server carrying like 37 plates of food at once . . . Can you imagine being the last person to get your food? "Um, excuse me, I think there was a mix-up. I ordered a burger, not a salad?" "No, that's your burger. It was just underneath tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 23."
😅😂 lmao Help Help in that calm quiet voice lol
(6:15) watching Daz feels like being on FaceTime w your friend 💀
.
Daz  love you man! What’s your best adventure ps4 game ? The best graphics ? Someone said enchanted and assassins creed as well as red dead redemption and lastly hitman trilogy what’s your views ? Also the most scary game to play? I saw you play a game called mourge I think it was lol
Jesus loves yall and want a relationship with you guys, just wanted to say this, have an awesome day!!❤️😁
You know not to be mean, but bro. This is a really good background video.
Can you cook me a craip
Daz quote of the day!!  “I love incense!!”   😂😂
DAZ you are not useless you make my day, day after day, after day, after day
The waither was carying 33 disces persisly
Just me sitting here agreeing with Daz on the fact that it’s possible Aliens built the pyramids 😂😂😂
Men & Elephants built the pyramids
10:29 Inspector?
3:00 yep 😂 that’s what working in glass production is like 😂 you get cut, you deal with it and you do not get blood near others work areas 😂 (from own experience)
when daz mimicked the seller people on teleshopping it made me think of shouty man from horrible histories, it sounded exactly the same i swear
Daz: Some people are just worth the money aren’t they? If he turned up on sight, I’d be like I’m paying more, have an extended lunch break! Marry, MY WIFE!!
I wish they had shown a decent hand nailer for the roofing one. The nailguns are a little faster but its crazy how fast some of the hammer users can go. While I was inspecting one this guy legit did four or five shingles in the span of 20 seconds. There was another crew walking (no rope, harness, or ridge ladder) a 14/12 pitch, which is about 50 degrees in angel and mental.
Why wasn’t daz on the list I need to speak to the person that made this video
-nice vid-
The way the nails missed him 3 times is some hard core final destination shit💀
0:40 asmr which I personally hate  😭😭😭😭
Whats that on his shirt
Daz. Jesus loves you so much and wants you to turn to him . He died for your sins and rose. He is alive.
Dazdazdazdazdazdazdazdazdazdazdazdazdazdazdazdazdazdaz
6:57 ngl same daz lol
Dude when I was like 13 I chopped the top of my pinky off in woodshop and the instructor told me that my bleeding was unsanitary and gave me a deduction in points. AS IF THE DEDUCTION OF FINGER WERENT ENOUGH
😂6:54 😮8:14 8:47
6:13 😂😂😂
I really wanted you to say and that's how I learnt how Windows were really made with a 1 + 1 = window
Daz, you should make us a crepe!  Btw, if anyone’s had one, what should you put in one? And what do they taste like?
I always watch these videos when I’ve had a rough day and they always seem to make me laugh or smile
5:27 i got a sky Vegas casino add and it’s the best timing add I’ve ever seen
You can see clamp air bubbles because they are breathing. lol looks like little holes opening up real quick before closing.
Aliens did build them tho. It’s like… duhhh 85% of the world won’t acknowledge that but yes. Duhh
Three times he mist me, all of this DAZ!!

Intro ends at 1:06 👏
1:51 HAHAHA 😮
This man did NOT just say he thinks aliens built the pyramids... -_- I love Daz so much, but I honestly lost a bit of respect cause of that.
hearing people say my name when saying ferrero rochers is never something ill be used to
the line on that car is so straight its about to call the cops on some gay people for breathing :(
My definition of try not to laugh is daz
6:29 Daz, that's called a mandolin, my grandma has one from the 1940s and uses it to cut cucumbers.....
I love how Daz talks to us and tells story’s to his camera like we are for real sitting right in front of him 😂
Meeeeee ppppooo
whos gonna tell him that, that man is not cleaning a window
HA! TIME FOR A SIDE RANT!
Daz please make a series full of side rants
Daz a true professional at cutting onions
I worked at hostess doing the cupcakes
I’m a Greenkeeper so change holes often and yes it is really satisfying doing it 😂👍
33 plates btw
I’ve only just realised he has a vine logo tattoo after 3 years of watching him and 10 months after this was posted 😅😅❤
I PREDICTEDDAZ WOULD SAY HE WAS AT THE END OF THE CONVER BELT

God I love Daz watches!
*waves finger in the air* “help.  help.   it is raining” -Daz Black
I love when daz said ITS HES IONING AN  OMELETTE got me dying for 3 minutes 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I agree with your wife, aliens didn’t build the pyramids… It was dinosaurs
Daz that wasn't a window cleaner he was installing an a,c unit.
You reminded me of an accident that I had working in a forfars bakery/factory. We had finished making the cakes pies and sausage rolls for the morning and I was tasked with cleaning the fan belt. I had never done this before and I had only been working there for just over a week. I was 16 and just left school. Anyway I'm cleaning the belt and accidentally my tummy had leant on the side button to start the belt. My fingers were trapped and it was getting close to the point where the belt turns. My hand was facing palm side upwards . My entire arm probably could have been twisted and snapped but luckily from my screaming and crying for help someone finally came over just on time to hit the main power off button. I was taken to the hospital and luckily I had no broken fingers. After several weeks I only lost one finger nail which had turned black because it had got damaged. I never cleaned that belt again. Actually I was put on a different part of the work place because I was scared to go near the belt.
Yoo that server is buggin, he is deadass not allowed to do that ☠️
Three times "all of this daz he missed."😂😂😂😂
"I was talking about onions"
"Oohhhhhhhhhhhh shit" 😂
"Give me breakfast on a convayorbelt"-daz
"Nah mate, Aliens"
ILL JUST STOP BLEEDING 🩸
i am eating a cheese and ham jacket potato while watching this
When u n dave made it to that island I cried was so glad u both made it and proved everyone wrong only practice u had was raft video game x
I wish Daz was like- my uncle or smthn that would be so effin cool. He’d totally be the cool uncle who’d tell you stories n shiz ;3;
😂😂😂love you
Historians: Isn't it amazing how Egyptians built the pyramids! Daz: Nah mate it was aliens!

1:49 people who watch daz for a long time knew as soon as they saw the conveyor belt, that daz was about to make the joke of having his mouth at the end of the conveyor belt 😂😂😂
I cant draw a straight line with a ruler
“hello phone😐”
So, my dude's job is to cut all the sunflower heads and shorten the stems to make it easier for the combine harvester to cut them, how does that make any sense, what's the point of cutting the sunflowers again with the harvester, just have the guy dump the heads in a basket!
I always love the end stay dazzling HAUH
you were doing what now😀
Is it just me who thought Daz said "i love inc*st"?
5:09 Who kisses their kid on the lips? I feel like it would be a bit gross in my opinion
NOOT NOOT
Daz i think you just offended the entire french community 😂 bye pronouncing crêpe as crape 😂😂😂
daz please do a side rant series
it's funny you mention them cause i have ferrero rochers with me right now while im watching
Damn daz the camera quality!!
Noice camera quality
The bestest part is that Daz doesn’t see the captions “installing ac unit, might come with…” not washing windows etc. 😂 Anyways Daz is 👑
"How's it going dazzlers, welcome back to Daz games and we're back with another Daz watches/ Horror game." Legendary words
Love daz too much
fr
Why DAZ be on this list?
Normal people satisfaction - Daz SaTisFactioN
I believe he sees them because he's making the sand flat and as he does that they need to make new air holes to breathe and when he sees bubbles he snagged them up
No it's just them figuring out you work smarter not harder
Oh yeah something like that happened to me too I was on vacation and Galveston and we are on one of those rentable tricycles or whatever and I flipped it going downhill my hands and legs was all tore up and I went to a gas station to use the restroom to try and clean up and they said no because they didn't want me bleeding in there and they kick me out

This is a bit late but daz that window cleaner wasn't a window cleaner he was installing an ac 💀
I read somewhere that apparently mammoths were alive during the time that the pyramids were built. If that is true, and if they were able to be like domesticated or trained, I can see how the pyramids could have been built, using this giganto mammals with their great strength. lol
You did a great job man love the vids brought me back to your channel made me find Dave and made me fall back in love with one of my long lost YouTube favorites thks man for what you two do and keep it up
Why does he look so shiny in this video
5:34 when you said casino I had a casino add straight after 😂

3:22 "what in the magneto is this?" 😂😂

The person who was getting those calms got them by the bubbles maybe I'm wrong
Hello daz you’ll problay never see this comment, but it’s worth a shot! I love your videos I’ve been watching them for about 3 years now. You’re my favorite and funniest YouTuber I’ve ever seen. Also your videos really help me when I need a laugh or I’m in a bad place. Thank you DAZ ❤
Were you required to be transparent
I loved watching your trailer on Daz and Dave's survival to the point where I had actually cried watching both videos. I love watching your videos Daz, you're super funny. And I watch your videos on a daily basis.
Aliens did build the pyramids. Truly believe that with you Dax 😂

Daz is the whole reason taht I’m happy today
His ended tho lol
You're good at your job too Daz, you not only entertain your audience but you make us laugh, smile and feel better about the shitty days we've had, and make the good ones even better. Plus from what we have all witnessed through your vids, you're a great dad, a wonderful friend and an affectionate, caring gentleman with a good heart...maybe not all the ladies you've fallen for saw that, but I am sure more than a few of us Dazzlers have.
11:05 he's using his other finger as a guide
Hello phone

icl on the crepe vid i would be able to completely smash that in like 10 mins 😅😂

I don’t know why but I somehow just want Daz to make a crepe and just ship it to me randomly because I believe he makes the best crepes
went from a video 6 years ago to this, he's getting old but the camera quality makes up for it, its such a difference
33
I love your videos x
Luv u daz so much ❤
It’s not a lawsuit where he’s at mate. They’ll just replace him and he’ll go hungry lol😅
How would that happen if you were standing on the floor and the person was drilling scrues through the roof. If you were on the floor how would it get your feet

fu*king CRAPE nononono couldent be c r e p
“And he’s just like and that one and that one and that one and 2 at a time and that one.”😂😂
BRO HUNGRY WITH THAT STROKEY LOkEY DAMN...
Daz told us that he used to work at a window factory and got fired when he got fed up with his former manager's disdain for him in an Anazing Ways That People Get Fired video. Then the factory got bankrupt for any unknown reason.
Man I love Daz he's bloody amazing with these jokes
The commercial impression got me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
All of this Daz he missed 😂😂😂

Welcome back to Daz's games he says and then welcome back to another Daz's watches
im so mad and upset that daz wasn’t on that list.
I understand you with the stop bleeding when you cut your finger I was in a wheelchair and the nurse told me are you ok to walk back to class-
Here comes the A frame
I relate to him with the bleeding on the work bench because I got into a fight and was spitting out blood and this teacher said “can you please stop spitting you’re getting it on my shoes” I was so mad like step back or I’ll choke on my own blood.
The 2nd one is just POV: ur guardians telling u what they're gonna do if u don't stop growing
Nah bro daz is the only youtuber that makes me laugh so hard my family is concerned af, I love you daz keep making content and be who you are!!
Woo
I’d love to see a Daz cooks video, he seems to love the subject of cooking. He talks a lot about being able to cook, I’d love to see what I could learn from him.
this hole video I was so distracted by the thing on his shirt
Who else is drunk and in a laying in a paddock while watching
daz is by far the best youtuber
"3 times he missed all of this daz"
Hi
6:25 woah
This was brilliant. 😂
Daz would not have survived my accident that required my finger to be put back on😂😂
hi Daz i got your white tea party beanie for my birthday and it is amazing and really comfortable and i have been watching your videos for so long and my day is lit up when i watch your videos so can i just say thank you!
MOVE. YOUR. MOUSE. AWAY. FROM. THE. PLAY BUTTON.
It’s pronounced crep not craipe btw
Daz, after watching your survival series I just wanted to say you are incredible. Sacrificing your life for the sake of entertainment, big kudos to you.
Don't worry daz I believe that aliens built the permanent to I meen how elts did that get a rock the size of a bath up all the to the top
Speaking about your factory story my dad worked in a car rim factory for 15 years and they have a big furnace to melt the metal etc. There's a big steel door to the furnace they have to open and close when they want to reach in with a rod and grab the metal out of the furnace. One day he was reaching in with his rod and the steel door failed and slammed down onto his hands. He broke both his thumbs and was squirting blood everywhere. His coworkers ran be that because they were scared or to get help. One of the men helping him down the corridor passed out from looking at him. He recovered well and has both his thumbs still that work fine. The only visible thing from the accident is his right thumb nail is kind of squashed. They would have removed it except they used it to fuse his right thumb back together again. So you can see 3 lines that lead to his squashed nail where the skin would have been split if it wasn't held together by his nail. Often when I'm doing my nails he will come into my room and make the joke "will you do my nail next" while showing me his bad thumb 😂 I'm glad were able to laugh about it today and that he recovered well
He could tell where the clams were because of small air pockets that get revealed only for a moment. Watch close enough and you may see the pockets too!
Daz I saw you crying and hugging Dave I honestly started crying seriously Daz I'm your biggest fan
Remember folks..don't click on any links if you love your computer and your bank account.
Daz anytime he sees trade works: you know one time 😂
My parrot kept on telling u to shut up 😂😂😂
alians made pyrimids 100% theres even pictures of them in them xD
Can you make a video of you making crepes and show the recipe?
I just imagine daz at the end of the conveyor belt chomping on that finger *daz* “WHAT THE FU….”

What if we humans are aliens
True fact if he messed up on the paint he’d have to get the car re painted and start over process on repeat
What’s hooked onto his shirt?
🙂 ρяσмσѕм
Why is the quality of this video soo good
Daz telling us about every job he’s ever done
Trying to hide all your drama huh
Is It just me or is the quality so good?

Daz: "I believe alien built the pyramids" Me who is in school to be an Archaeologist 👁👄👁 🤣🤣🤣

"What in the magneto"  I need to use that in real life.
did you get a new camera? the quality look GOOD.
Daz is like Google when u look up a word in the intro
10:28 Agreed! Why do I keep meeting people who are mindless in that fashion? I can tell when I'm in a doomed relationship if I find out the person likes golf...ALWAYS, be they friends or otherwise.
IT'S RAINING BLOOD 🌧️✨🎶 HALLELUJA🙏✨ IT'S RAINING BLOOD🌧️✨🎶
If any was wondering they cut the sun flowers that way so that they die and the sun dries the seed for eating
Love you Daz! What you do for us is amazing, not to mention risking your life!!! Stay awesome Daz and I’m so proud to be a Dazzler!!! 😊
"Nah mate.... Aliens"🤣🤣🤣

I swear when he said some casino hire this person a casino ad popped up lmfao

10:20 daz that’s not a window cleaner they’re installing ac, it says at the bottom
0:30 said no gta 6 developer ever
Why is one side of his headphones always up on his cheeks more than the other one? Am I the only one who is going crazy because of that? My OCD ass cant
2:05 what if you get your finger caught in it like ooohhhh shit XD, the way daz followed his finger saying it

Daz your tatoo of vine is awesome
Is normal in my country to sharpen knives etc in public. Its a job dey walk around sharpening for people.
We are the aliens👽🤫
Did you know mammoths were around during the time the pyramids were built… that’s how they must’ve moved those big bricks
if vine daz met this daz, he wouldn't believe that he film a survival show
During my hospital admissions I would always watch Daz Watches. It lightened up a rather darkened world. Thank you for making me smile when I believed my world was over <3
Daz Alien hunt
Hey Daz! A bit of an interesting fact for you: those guys that sharpen knifes in their bicycles, here in Portugal they are called "amoladores" and it was, and still in some places, usual for them to go around town playing a very specific song (like the ice cream truck song) and the people of the town would pay them to sharpen their knifes. 'Cause back in the day there weren't knife sharpening tools at everyone's disposal. #newfactoftheday :)
surely you make us all crepes now... please and thank you
Hi daz
come to think of it Daz seems to either almost or gets hurt a lot
"Help help its raining"😂
Glad to see you back in good health
New mic?
Daz his anybuddy Ever said Daz nuts
I forgot Daz liked cooking.... I am now requesting Daz and Sarah cooking content
Basically on the ‘clam picking’ they’re not actually clams they’re just sea bugs used for bait and what they do they don’t actually see them they just pick up the sand hoping there are some there and the sand falls out the holes in the ‘bait box’ so all that’s left is the bugs!
WHERE DOES IT SAY SATASFYING IT DOESN'T IT SAYS PEOPLE TOO GOOD AT THERE JOB........
Did you get a new camera? Everything looks so crisp & nicely contrasted! Also I’d hope to see you on this list after the Dave & Daz adventure 😌
The guy painting the line on the car is one of the only people qualified to paint the lines on the rolls Royce! They use squirrel hair brushes to get the clean crisp line!😊
I WANNA DO WHAT DAZ DID
Daz do u like football(soccer)
Me to Daz, me to, ALIENS ARE REAL!!! 👽👾
Definitely aliens!
You still trying to convince people you have a gf 😂
Glad you’re back Daz, you made my childhood with your vines and I’m glad you’re back and getting better
I swear Daz is useing 4k in this video
Good to see you back daz
That wasn't a HAAAUUUH that was a hhhh-
His camera is amazing in this video!! ❤️
Oh I love crêpes I make the best crêpes be pov DaZ is giving you a crêpe
the guy who did the straight line on cars gets hired by diff car companys like bentley to do the fine details
Daz better be on the top
That's a safety hazard.
You haven't played cooking simulator for 10 months and promise you would Play it again, Please play it again.🥺                                                                                                                                                                                                     🙏
I am so happy Daz is ok
Daz play death in the water 2 its a under water horror
the fact that hes double tasking, making new videos while editing the survival one i amazing, love u daz!
At the end when you said I like this I said to myself I like you daz (love your content!)
Ur camera is clearer than my vision
Just goes to show Daz , the amount of times you've almost died and got away scratch free , just shows you were meant to be here to make us all laugh hiserically and give us joy and happiness without you I wouldn't be here so im glad your still here daz🥰
Hi daz great that ur feeling better there is a new open world horror game coming out on the 9th of December called Choo-Choo Charles please play it looks good for only having one programmer
No my mum makes the best crapes with ice-cream strawberry’s and Nutella so that’s why my mum makes the best crapes
I must ask wat is the black square think on Daz’s t-shirt
Daz is the best if u still don’t love him after one video then there is something wrong with you
You seem different since your trip to the island
What in the magneto!? 😂 😂 😂
my sister showed me a picture of her meeting daz at alton Towers (she had glasses)❤
By dazzling daz 🎉
So glad you are back and not dead. My Daz Youtooz arrived while you were away and I'm happy it's not going to be an  in memorial type figure thing 😀
2:02 ive worked in a factory with a line like that. It’s impossible to get a finger stuck because it’s designed that way. Plus the machine would immediately stop if it sensed something tugging
Daz its ok, I can’t draw a straight line with a ruler
Eww
Daz your so tan🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
DAZ PLEASE PLAY ROBLOX WITH YOUR DAUGHTER AGAIN I LOVE YOU GUYS ❤❤
Hey Daz you need to check out the Resident Evil Village DLC after the main game was so good.
Hey Daz ... glad your feeling better. If u get time would you please play Bramble. It's alot like Little Nightmares which I believe you enjoyed... Give it a try mate... your the best. 🙂
I have a casette deck in mine. But i can also go to luxurious peaceful spots in the woods connected to a pond. Your bmw cant do that.
My jeep has a casette deck. Pretty luxurious but it also goes places pretty luxurious like the pond in the woods. Free swimming pool and peaceful in the woods.
you never fail to make me laugh! love u daz 💜
the tan is coming in
I’m sorry but 11:35😂😂
onion chopper: aka a mandolin
I TOO believe that pyramids where built by aliens.
Great video today Daz 🔥💜
Clam fishing is fun. You can’t see them but in the sand when there’s bubbles on tops you know they’re there
talking about massages look up turkish hammam they wash you and all sorts and actually slide you and slap you about. im an avid watcher of people getting massages and ive seen some diffrent stuff
YESS DAZ ALIENS DID BUILD THE PYRAMIDS
The amount of times he almost died, probably why he is a YouTuber, safest job he has ever had🤣🤣😂😂
Please please please react to trinity and maddison please
Daz I remembered the time you said you can’t mess up a burger while I was making burgers and my burger lit on fire
Can you not bleed on my work bench. haaaaa, love it. followed you since vine and still love your video's mate. Hands down click bait the best. keep them coming and keep the masses laughing.
Does anyone really like daz black I mean he’s so perfect that it’s getting old
I honestly can't wait for the survival video ❤️ u daz

OMG CAN U PLS PLAY ONE OF THE SLENDARINA GAMES
Well I’m just not comfortable with other plates touching my food.
Daz - FINAL NIGHTS 4 PLS PLAY☺
who doesn’t love daz?? i love him so so much, 8 years watching my hero❤️
The sad thing about this is that I bet these people get paid 0.001p per thing they do, so they *have* to be quick otherwise they wouldn't earn enough money to live, not that they probably do anyway
Daddy daz experienced ?
The A frame the A train 😎
you talk too much.
What an amazing new camera quality?? and amazing video daz
i also love crepes.
Your camera looks better
daz. i think i caught your low disk space thing.. i now know how you feel ☠💀
Stop i thought he said i love insest
I survive on an island and lived 🤣
WAIT WHAT!? I HAVE BEEN GROUNDED BECAUSE I SNUCK OUT TOO A PARTY, BUT WHEN DID DAZ ALMOST DIE!
Daz, you were in a dream of mine. It was so weird and funny lol. We were in Kentucky and hopping on to a charter plane along with someone else and trying to fly you to London, UK. It was funny because you were wearing your black wig when you impersonate a woman and getting into the pilot seat. You said you could fly, but took off with the door open (which scared the absolute s**t out of me) and you started screaming the way you would wearing that black wig when the plane went straight up, but then back down on the ground… needless to say, I’m sure we didn’t make it to the UK.. pretty sure we all crashed and died lol. .. then I woke up 🤷🏻‍♂️
Ah yes “installing AC can come with complications” “and the window still looks like shit!” He’s not a window cleaner
Hi daz I remember in on off your vids you said that you dont respond to people saying I love you daz your vids are so good witch there are but how about if we said something before like a secret code just for us so when we say that your vids are soooooo good you will know it's not a bot just an idea
Liked before it's even started.
❤️❤️
That man on the bike sharpening knives is known as a Sharpener, they usually carry some type of whistle to alert people he's nearby and neighbors come down with all their knives to be sharpened, they're still a thing in Spain!! I don't know in wich countries too, but it's a known profession
Had to pause and go make sum tacos for This
daz should go on i am a celebrity get me out of here
Pls stop saying the word jesus pls
You know the island survival was real when daz is two shades darker! 😆
Daz's camera got me daised very nice to look at :3
Daz should react to cringe POVS  😌
Oh my gosh, talented. “IRonINg aN OmlET” made my day,
Hey dad I don’t know if u’ll remember me but you took a selfie with me and my friends when you where on the train to Eastbourne about 1 or 2 years ago I was the one without glasses with the purple lanyard.I just wanted to say I love your vids.whenever I’m feeling sad or lonely I just watch one of ur vids.I’m an out homosexual and with that comes allot of homophobia.but I just like watching u as it makes me smile after a long day.so thank u

Hey Daz! I'm not sure if you'll see this or not but either way I wanted to comment this. I just want you to know the impact you yourself, and your videos have done on me. And many more I'm sure. It's crazy how someone over a screen can just make your whole day better. I look up to you so much and I'm others do as well! Thank you for all your hard work and dedication. :)
When my father was younger, he worked in a factory as well. His hand got caught in the belt,the heat melted his watch to his wrist.
Hey Daz! I don't think you'll see this. I am currently sick but your voice is so comforting and soothing that I think I'll be able to actually sleep lol. Thank you for all you have done! We all really appreciate you. You are doing such a great job with everything! Take care
Watch the fastest tree planter in the world. That's cool.
I actually want to see Daz first ever video to see how hes uograded and bettered his content over the years

Clams make air bubbles in sand and that’s how the person getting them could see them 😊
Can someone please tell me what that 'device' is on Daz's shirt please? I'm so curious.
Thank you for surviving!! :) PS. When you said you believe Aliens built the pyramids, it reminded me of SG1 Stargate. Please tell me you are also obsessed with the show :)
2:50 should've sued for child endangerment

You should watch the mandela catalog its very good
The camera quality is amazing 😍
daz i saw you at bluewater today i think it wad you looked like you
So glad I'm not the only one that hates asmr
I need to know the archeologist girlfriend’s take on the discovery of the pyramid of Queen Neith. Also glad you’re back and feeling better Daz ❤
Daz, you have such a nice tanned glow now! And none of that fake ass tanning bed or tanning spray shit! You look so healthy, and your skin is glowing. ❤‍🔥
looking forward to the specials daz mate
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
6:34 - I think, occasionally, a bubble pops up?
HE MADE IT! HE'S HERE! 😲 OH YAY! 😊
I have the best YouTube channel for you Daz, it’s called KLR and they are super funny!😂
okay why is no one talking about the quality of the camera rn. the 4K quality is just wow
i heard from a little birdy, if you say Daz is #1 3 times, you get pinned  Daz Is #1 Daz Is #1 Daz Is #1
are we not gonna talk about the tattoo of vine ?? ( btw i am happy that he is back !! get some rest !!
Okay daz hear me out. SHAPESHIFTING ALIENS THAT SHAPESHIFTED INTO THE EGYPTIONS
The waiter with all the dishes bothers me, the food underneath will be squashed, cold and I don't want the bottom of another plate touching my food
hey daz what microphone are u using?
E
Daz you are looking mighty dazzling the camera quality is WONDERFUL
https://youtu.be/NipayCVRw7c    Is this that incident?
5:55 what am I buying, when can I buy it and where can I buy it 😶
Can you do another cooking sim vid
Dude I’m so pumped for your survival series. But also I’m so glad you’re home and safe and fed and I know your family is too.
Last
just to clarify Daz ur not useless you just have a very specific set of skills that are pretty much pointless in any other IRL /NON-YOUTUBE  based situation😂😂let me also say thats not a bad thing at all because you still bring a ridiculous amount of joy to millions almost on a weekly basis( minus when uve stranded urself on an island😂)but regardless keep it up and fingers crossed maybe you could put some of ur new found survival skills
hi daz! daughter of a clam digger here. that one guy can probably see the clams cause clams make little bubbly holes in the top of the sand which give away where they are. love your videos!
I thought the incents were spaghetti sticks and the were dying them
Daz it’s coming out a new version of poppy playtime. It’s called project playtime it’s a co op survival game inside the toy factory. It’s coming out on 6 December. It would be fun if you’d play it with Dave. Keep up the good work Daz, love your videos.
DAZ YOU HAVE A LOVELY TAN
We love u daz
Nobody nobody   Daz: is it worth dieng for well YEA hahah
I love this man way to much I’m obsessed 😂
Hey Daz i have watched your videos for 5 years...So theres a game and i think you didnt play THE MAN FROM THE WINDOW so i have been wondering if you can play it
I wonder when is coming the cooking simulator vr part 2... I guess never anymore...
What’s the little clip on daz’s shirt. Is it a microphone?
Why wasn’t Daz on this list?
have not watch him in awhile but his views went down alot...i grew up watching him..man he needs more views then this T-T I LOVE his videos, i remember watching the granny simulator game when she kicks daz out the window and how she glitched and went on the wall, made me laugh anytime i was sad.. I LOVEEE EVERYTHING this man does for us and his fans, truly a king and amazing. (edit cuz i forgot to say, i started to watch daz around when vine was still a thing :)
Try the new update of baby in yellow
Daz mate you are too funny 🤣
The backround looks green screened and makes you look kinda cool but I do t know what you’ve done with the lighting/backround but it’s good
I wonder if he would do something like that again
DAZZZZ can u pls play the new bendy and the ink machine pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!
Am i the only one who loves Daz's window factory stories?
Daz are you using a different mic and camera?
petition to try daz's crepes                  sign here

Ain’t no way he already back💀
Ssssssuuuuuuuuurrrrrrreeeeee ur talking about onions
Daz: 9:00 "when I think of all the times I've nearly died Also Daz: "me and Dave are gonna go survive in the wilderness with nothing..."
My dad knew a guy that’d freehand car stuff like those stripes and he said he was awesome
i love the camera quality but i miss the big mic 😥
being a server i can carry 90 plates at once its literally so easy
Daz-oh and by the way I’ve worked every job ever😂
new camera????
We love u daz always have always will❤
My mate cut the top of my finger off with scissors  ,then the teacher knocked his  thumb off Im woodwork.all In one day 🤢
Love crapes!❤️

My mom wants to see more reactions to bad food videos she loves you and loves them of everything you do
At 9:18 Daz said "I love incest"
Omg I missed you so much I’m so so so so glad you are okay and here with us god bless you ! ❤️
Am I the only one who noticed the camera quality got brighter 😂 but anyways DAZ, your amazing like MY FAV YOUTUBER ❤

You good
Daz I love your tan
I DONT KNOW HOW SOME PEOPLE CAN HATE DAZ LIKE WHAT ???
I’m so happy you guys made it back home safely ❤
I also hate asmr
omg i just realised u have 8 million subs, ive been a fan for about 5 years i think? im pretty sure u had around 4 mil before, youve done so well, well done and ur amazing
Don’t you dare say you feel useless!!!! 😡 you make so many people happy (including me) just by being you!!! And that is amazing! And something you can’t put a price on.  You are legit my favourite YouTuber out of all of them. Keep doing what you do Daz. You’re awesome!
I think we have learned from this video is that daz isn't made for construction labour
Satisfaction comes in many forms he says little did he know he's the most satisfying thing there is
cant wait to watch the vid from your adventure would also like to see the unedited version as i bet its so entertaining
Seeing daz with a tan looks a bit off ngl
Yes we all call a crepe a crape
ima guess Daz survival video will release on the 14th of December
I don’t want to watch the trailer because I want to be completely surprised. Sorry for not watching it😂
Daz. You are by far my favorite content creators and I always love to settle down and watch some daz. I cannot wait for your survival series to drop. Thank you for doing what you do best. It is always a pleasure watching your content
hey daz hope you get better from filming I bet its going to be fire
Oh my god I sell the scissors Daz is talking about the ones that cut penny's 🤣🤣
You make 8 million people laugh, smile and feel happy everyday. You are NOT useless good Sir!
nah mate, aliens
I just found Daz and he seems like Ali A but 999999999999999999x better and less annoying
He got the new DJI mic
Hey Daz, i was like wtf he has a girlfriend?!?!?! so your cheating on LINNNDAAA? but lmao no but she better not take you from us, lol
L daz
Daz you are the best you are better then all the other YouTubers put together whenever I’m sad and I watch your videos you never fail to make me and other people laugh
just an observation, no gate at all, but is the saturation up on this video or is it my eyes or laptop going bad😂
PLAY SNED HELP
Daz ur the best
THE QUALITY DAZ OMGGGGG
Can you please react to BTS - Black Swan MV? 😊
What’s clipped to his shirt??
aliens built the pyramids is a nazi theory btw
5:47 damn was hoping this was a real invention 😂😂😂😂😂THEY DO HAVE SANDWICH BOXES THOUGH
Ik a lot of people hate the "can we appreciate" posts (don't worry this isn't one, I don't think lol) but I really love them when they aren't robotic of course. But I love the hype up and love spreading 😂❤️❤️
6:54 they kinda pop up like tiny air bubbles i love looking for them when I go to the beach since I don’t go into the water
Hey daz- this might be the last time I watch your videos- I’m glad I got to watch your videos for years but unfortunately it must end- thank you!
Anyone else genuinely believe he makes the best crepes 👀
Ye uh-oh hello phone   I know he dodent say yea uh
✨✨✨✨✨✨THE QUALITY✨✨✨✨✨
I LOVE YOU
Daz you are GLOWING
Glad your back Daz! You look tanned 😆
I swear you always know how to make my day better
What a dazzling video
Fun fact daz, they used mammoths to build the pyramids
Daz plz do a kitchen tour 😌
Omg daz, you look so much better! Especially that tan 😂
Has your ANUS ever been SODOMIZED before
Daz we need a collab with Mr.Beast asap. I can tell y’all would make amazing content together
Anyone noticed that the Camara quality has increased 😎😎
Oh my god! I missed the nail gun story, I haven’t heard Daz tell it in so long!
Can’t you play the videos and talk about them while they play instead of showing us 2-3 seconds of each clip? Literally unwatchable.
As a person who plays golf, Daz, it takes good precision, strategy and good eyes in order to get a hole-in-one from a distance. So no. I am not mindless when I play it. Funny video though! ❤
"*click* ah yes done ILL JUST STOP BLEEDING"
Daz, he wasn't cleaning the windows he was fixing the AC units 🤣
Daz’ side rants are the best😂
I absolutely died when daz said that he would be at the end of that potato factory line with his mouth wide open 😂😂😂😂😅😂❤❤❤ I love you daz!!!
I cannot freaking wait to see it ❤❤❤❤
the way he said crepe killed me
DAZZZZ I MISSED YOU! This has made my day even though I saw your last post. Keep posting and happy 8 million!
I can’t believe how sexy I am
you are using a new camera..... interesting... u look amazing
So glad you feel better and are safe. Us Dazzlers love you very much! 🥰
does the video quality look rlly good this vid. or just me?
E
I kind of liked the goatee bro it looked good
No 👽 😂😂😂
Nah mate..aliens😻👽
🥺😂
what’s on his chest?
Who wants a dad cooking video where he teaches us how he does his famously good crepe !!??
Glad to hear you're better 😊😊😊😊😊
it's the way he's just like "hello phone" lmao
Him just freehanding the car: … Me: got a ruler? wait they are useless to me because I STILL CANT DRAW A STRAIGHT LINE WITH ONE
hello dazzlers
i agree with the aliens daz 😆😆
WE LOVE YOU DAZ
Daz: you have to be mindless to play golf Scotland: hold my kilt 😂
the fact that I get bullied at school every day and I could watch daz and still laugh so hard I could cry and get hiccups #daz games
ay isn't it Ironic that the tip of all 3 major Pyrmids are in Line completely with Orion's Belt. for people who had no technology and certainly no way of reaching space back then... It can't be a coincidence.
What camera do you use
Daz play luto it's about a hyper realistic ghost using unreal engine 5
The unusual lack of views, after Daz been gone for over two weeks, tells me that people prefer to watch people fuck up, not to be good at their job!  🤔 😂😅
“ILL JUST STOP BLEEDING THEN WILL I” me on my period when my teacher tells me to “just wait”
Teenage daz just being very calm about the blood:  Help i need help its raining blood
4:30 ayo 😳
I'm pretty sure it was aliens too lol
Does he have a new camera? The intro looks very smooth
Hi Daz, I have a game you could play it is called (war of the words) I don't know to much of the game but it's kinda creepy and you have to run away from things
Not even two weeks after you’ve come back, you’re already posting videos. Shows determination, well done
Intelligente savior 54
Where’s the trailer
nice camra
Thank you for the entertainment Daz we love you and US LATINOS Y LATINAS NOSOTROS TE AMAMOS!!!.💯❤️you’re the best bro
Plz react to kays cooking again plzzzzzzzzzzz
Out of this whole video my take a way is when I visit the Uk im going to ask Daz for a Crêpe never had one. So why not my fave person don’t have a lot of those 😹😹
https://youtu.be/Yep6GVM0IYs
I also lost track of how many times i almost died too daz. The nail one would have been quite a bad way to go
lol he downloaded  X-Ray texture pack
what camera is that, the quality is so good why is no one talking about it.
The trailer came out the day after my horse went over the top of me giving me a concussion
We need a SIDE RANT series where daz just tells us random stories 🤣
does daz like incense or incest? 🤔
I love your videos. I feel you on cutting your finger. About 14 years ago I was working at a grocery store deli and cut my finger on the meat slicer while it was moving. I screamed so loud they heard me at the front of the store. Do not recommend.
Nooo YouTube isn't notifying me when you post! I have the bell icon on and everything
You should react to commercials
Please don't make us wait till next month lol we have been waiting for it too long but happy Thanksgiving from the US it was yesterday
YOU ARE GLOWING
I got my other half into Daz Black a few weeks back,  and he even said omg cant believe iv never watched him before he is so so funny 😎  so yay! another Dazzler to the mix 🥰🥰
DAZ please play the devil in me it’s another multiple ending horror game
"I make the best Crepes." 🤔  I don't know Daz, we've still NEVER seen you cook. So I guess until you do a Daz Cooks, I don't think I can believe you. 🤷🏼‍♀️ (I'm not bashing you my man. I just really want you to do a Daz Cooks, okay? Please don't come at me lol.)
I have recently been told I am to good for my job I am now an area resource and get shipped around the uk and soon to be Europe to train new people
Daz be like “I am the boy.. WHO LIVED”
I love you Daz but I wish you would read the sentence(s) at the bottom
6:20 💀💀
I can’t wait to see it!!
You should play inside the backrooms, its available on steam, and its coop.
Daz like my comment
onions.....right LOL!!!!
Is Daz funny are what 😂😂 Btw I'll not be able to do that you did Daz I'll literally die great job 👏❤️
Pls watch Jacob sartorius again😂it's been a while
I'm with you on the aliens and the pyramids, either that or they was given the information how to
Oop, someone upgraded some of their equipment
Hello Daz, just would like to give back some feedback, your editing jumpcuts are a bit too sharp at the start (lighting changes makes cuts stand out) your sentence starting point works but try to make the clip longer so that it is smoother visually and audibly.
We need a full video of Daz telling us stories from his old jobs 😂
Daz always makes me laugh! I recently watched “Daz watches poppy” I think you should watch her again! It would be so fun
Nah, mate. Aliens.
where is daz on this list ?
i love it when i see a new post from daz! it means that today I'll have a laugh and enjoy the time when I'm watching his videos :)  also... Daz- please don't tell me you really believe that *aliens* built the pyramids.. Please tell me that's a lie- :')
did he get a new camera?????
Glad for you to be back!!
based on your past stories Daz, i'm scared to think who else we've lost and could not grace the world with their presence like you have. that was MORTIFYING to hear about, especially "please don't bleed on my work statio-"  "Bitch, please die and or help me!" xD
Daz Challenge!!!! Replicate the barrel!! Please!! Begging you right now !! 😂 😂😂
Glad you ok after your Ireland adventure.
I honestly have no words for how hard he works for us. He really is most DAZZLING youtuber i’ve ever seen. All of your fans love  you Daz and im very proud to be a dazzler! 💕❤️‍🔥✨
Hi Daz you funny as hell. If i have a of day. I just watch your channel. Lol.
DAZ GAMES BELIEVES IN ALIENS YAYYY
I’m hoping these videos are pre-recorded. He needs to rest, but I respect his hard working behavior it’s amazing
Who was with sarah while you and Dave were at the jungle??
Is it just me, or are Daz's eyes more dazzaling hehe and more prominent. What lovely eyes you have ♥
The hard work you put in is unreal! You’re without a doubt the most genuine & committed person on this platform and it’s really, really appreciated. Thankyou ❤
Can we talk about his nail story… now I see why you gotta wear one there
daz im gonna be honest you look like you havent slept at all
Aaayyyyy yo what is up with dads camera
When he was talked about onions, my first thought was “looks  Like he’s playing a violin”
Hi daz, my name is Krystal (do pardon for the internet name change here) but speaking of massages.......I'm not one of those females who do soft massage.....I can actually massage muscles, hell I could even use my elbow if u wanted me to
Aliens had to have built them

Daz you have helped my mental health so much i love you, you always make my day you deserve the world
My dad is a carpenter and one of his work friends always tells the story of how my dad very nearly killed him with a nail gun. They were using it on a big sheet of wood (idky), my dad was the one holding the nail gun. The nail gun had a malfunction and fired twice and almost got the other guy in the head but the flat part of the nail got caught on the edge of the wood
3:18 this line is just great
I commented earlier say9ng shout a game and it's actually called the devil in me
Yaay im not the only one that believes  Aliens helped built the pyramids😁..
Daz, your videos are always satisfying to me which shows how great you are at your job
why dose this comment have so many likes
Your not useless Daz, you are incredible at your job! I love watching your videos and u never fail to make me laugh.
anybody notice the camera and mic change? i can’t tell if it’s better or worse, i think it may be better.
Damn he came back tan.
Daz is the best - I’ve only really started watching his stuff for a few months - I’m a bit of a dinosaur for youtubers not gonna lie but I think he’s amazing! all his daz watches videos makes my day and keeps me going - so daz if your reading this respect to ya and thankyou for the amazing videos! Keep being you - keep creating!
I continue to convince my mom that I believe the Capitol of the country is in Washington state. Idk why. But it’s funny.
Did u get a new camera?
I’ve just got to the end of the video, and I’ve rewinded the “nah m8, aliens” at least 10 times 😂
What can I watch your movie on
8 million subscribers?? i was watching you since you first started posting..i remember the first video of yours i watched and i’ve been watching you for years and years..your my all time favorite youtuber and my comfort thank you for all the memories
"nah mate aliens" i love daz
DAZ!! PLEASE PLAY YANDERE SIMULATOR AGAIN! there has been updates and i feel it has gotten more fun and interesting, there is a 1980's mode now in the game, please play it!
DAZZZ <3
Negative
Bro only ogs know Steve was the worst boss
every time i watch your video i try to do the HA at the end and i always launch my headset across the room in the process so i need a tutorial on how to not launch a headset
Please, please, PLEASE react to "primitive jungle lifeskills" !
The late night shopping channel voice impression TICKLED ME!
i think aliens gave people the tools to do the job way easier then they could of
the camera quality of this vid is wild dude
Believe in aliens 💯 I believe we made some of it but the extraterrestrials gave us the knowledge to build these amazing land marks  because years and years ago we was cave men eating rocks it’s like how could we possibly learn  how to lift heavy polders with out any help 👽👽👽
Daz he wasn't cleaning the windows, he was putting in an ac unit in the apartment building lol but I can agree with you
He's shaving onions
What is that thing on his shirt?
“Was it worth dying for?”    “Yes, yes it was.” - DazGames 2022
Yeah the roofer thing wasn't all that impressive. I was a framer there for a bit, and I've seen way faster people with a nail gun. Satisfying sure.
❤😂❤🎉😂😂🎉😢😢😢🎉😂🎉😢😮😮🎉😂😂😢🎉😂 hi daz🎉 im 6 I like your video👍
daz PLS make a cooking video!
Idk if anyone noticed but..dazes new lighting is just..DAMN.
When you said “ I make the best crepes” I LOST IT💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂

6:24 WOAH

The finger click and done is what I do when my mum asks me to do a five minute job -quickly- 🙃 😅
I did a traineeship at a window joint and actually sliced my finger , actually did it a couple of times but it was really fun
Love u daz ur my inspiration still funny

Dazzzzzzzzz I love crapes to can I eat some?

4:55 MY BOYFRIENDS NAME IS ALLAN AND HIS FAMILY ARE BLACKSMITHS OMG
Am I the only one that noticed Daz's camera quality? How good it is?
God bless!! 🤍🙏🏼
One time in high school, my nose started bleeding and the teacher told me not to get blood on the carpet 😂
Jeesus tap dancing christ. The quality in this footage, and the mic quality is incredible. What did you do Daz?! I'm surprised more people aren't talking about it. Man your lighting must be incredible to get such incredible detail on your face, and everything- this footage looks literally perfect!
Missed ya Daz, you look so different but amazing!!!
I fell so bad because I have not been able to watch you in a while and Im happy that iv came back
Oh btw daz you should react to uncle Roger
Is this a new camera?
I have a 2 day road trip to California and I’ve been rewatching all of your videos to pass time 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
It’s always a great day when Daz posts!
Thank you for this video Daz. I was having a tough thanksgiving and this helped. ❤
3:16 Do a Barrel Roll
I do flooring installation for a living and Daz's reaction to watching someone spread glue on the floor made me so happy :)
daz you burnt to fuck carnt wate to see daz and dave suvaval glad to see you not ded
Brave snow 38
I was so happy to get the notification as I thought a break would be justified bless him, saying that I could so have watched loads more with his reactions, I love this human!
6:17 out of context 💀
Says installing ac unit, Daz says window cleaner lmao 😊
You’re definitely not useless. I mean, you are one of my main sources of entertainment!
Reaction content is theft
GIGA DAZ
you got yourself a tan daz
oh I'm so glad daz is back and survived 😁❤️
I want a video about all the different jobs Daz has done
love love love LOVE u daz! hope u and ur daughter are doing great <3
I'm sorry but when you said "aliens" it reminded me of the pigeon from bolt😑🤣
That tan is chefs kiss
you should really do more of these videos i have been watching for a long time just not on this account my other got banned.
your camera looks great daz, looks new no?
When you do a repetitive job you become so focused on it you become "savant" about it. I was a baker until I was 25 and still to this day I automatically a able to do the tasks - tried it in a friends bakery some time ago - at a pro level after a quick warm up, the " body" just remembers the movements...
"nah mate...✨aliens✨" 🤣
I missed daz chatting to us🥹
New camera? Looking nice
This is crazy. I was subscribed to him while he was still in the closet and I'm so proud to see how far he come. And the fact that his subscribers nearly doubled in the past couple of months is crazy to me. Go daz go.
Bto what happened to your arm
Is anyone not going to talk about the tan he has gotten
How did your girlfriend react to your survival series? Also can we see the burns/injuries you sustained?
Do a daz watches on police impersonator Jeremy dewitte. He is worth a few daz watches
i’ve noticed the lighting and colouring in this video is really saturated but it looks so cool
Still waiting on that cooking channel Daz
Loving the new camera & mic setup, it’s absolutely dazzling 👌🏻
I once was making a meme of the “it’s corn!” song and I had an extra picture of butter and decided, “Hey, why not?” and sent the picture to Daz’s snapchat.  Just realised that he opened it 8 weeks ago 😂
The video quality is absolutely amazing ! New camera daz ?
I love your Videos!
Hey daz, wondering if I could recommend a game, I’d love to see you play the painscreek killings, it’s a little bit of an older game but it’s great
good camraaa
new mic and camera who dis
So glad you are back daz keep up the good work
I just cut a penny in half, come at me government
I honor daz more than my self
Your
I got tour merch
It wasn’t aliens that built the pyramids they were too busy in what is now Area 51. Slaves built the pyramids in the ancient Egypt civilization. I feel like a nerd rn
there is one person you forgot on this list, it's you.
Daz you are absolutely amazing! Keep on doing your job so well 👍
It was lovely to chat to daz at my work earlier today I love watching his videos especially daz watches lol
Daz yes aliens build the pyramids you are correct
Where have you been on holiday you are a gorgeous tan colour 😂
Aliens built the pyramids my arse. Ancient Egypt was smarter than we give them credit for; plus like a gazillion slave's help .
Daz yes or no did you get a new camera because I can literally see every single pour on your nose
Has anyone else noticed dazs face is a bit more tanned it's probably from the past 2 weeks on the island
Daz- I love crepes!  Will Ferrell in teladaga nights- No I will never say I love crepes!
Daz i beg of you please never give us a heart attack like that ever again...excited for it tho
I'm so incredibly happy that he's back to blessing us with content🥰💖  ....  but the second he mentioned aliens and pyramids my archeologist brain went: NO! 👀
Is it me or something looks different about daz or the lighting idk it seems brighter and also what’s that on his shirt?
Happy Thanksgiving Daz Black
Why don’t u play a games with some of your subs ?
1:19 so that's why I'm short
"so uh, i nearly cut my finger off" "i was nearly killed by a twat on the roof"
Daz I love u daz but more horro games
daz i have always wanted one of your hat, i think this year im finally going to get on im so happy.
Thanks mr daz
GEEEEZ DAZ CAMERA HAS BETTER QUALITY THAN MY EYES
That sunburn looks like it's healing pretty well, Daz. 👍🏻
Let’s just say how he risked his life just for content for us he she should be 1st son every amazing worker lidt
Yo the camera quality
happy thanksgiving
Is no-one talking about the video quality effect?
Woooo Dazzlers let's go
11:40 "marry my wife!" 🤣
We’re all proud of you Daz. I’m thankful for you, honestly.
10:10 he is installing an AC, not cleaning window
Is that a new camera?? The image is so crisp
The earliest I’ve ever been on a Daz games video
Your girlfriend is studying to be an archaeologist? She must be so excited about the recent findings in Egypt!
Daz is amazing, I love his videos so much
I see your using a clip on microphone today. I prefer the regular microphone as the clip on one just doesnt sound nice in my ears
Jewish slaves built the pyramids 100%.
New camera??
When is Daz gonna do a cooking vid??
Daz is way too good at his
Why do you hate asmr they did nothing to you ROFL
Hey Daz I used to clam dig all the time and what he’s seeing there is the air holes they make on the surface of the sand! That’s how we know there’s clams in there c:
why aint Daz on this list ?🤨
These comments are everything! At least every single one is true well don’t daz-love you! :) x
Daz your the best lmao your on my main playlist
Your my favorite YouTuber
Glad your doing well I can't wait to watch it
Does anybody else see how good his camera quality is now
Did you turn up the saturation it looks a lot better
New camera @dazgames ?
Never heard anyone call It a “crape” 😂
I'm guessing that the sunflowers were placed like that,  so they can feed the birds
HAPPY THANKSGIVING ❤
dazzzzzz bro i saw the new trailer that looked innntense glad youre better cant wait to see the series keep up the good work
he is replacing parts of the dead grass with healthy grass to help heal the patch
Wel jel of Daz’s winter tan!!!! Wearing it well girlfriend!!
Had to comment the comments were on 999
Daz I can 100% picture you on I'm a celebrity get me out of here.
Daz is a top geezer
I love you daz but you look a bit baked..
"She's ironing an omelette!!!!!" Best quote ever
2:40 I've done something similar but I was on my palm, got a every deep cut it from running with a pencil in the front pocket with the pointy side up. I don't know why my kid brain thought it was a good idea to do that, the pointy side was very sharp and to this day I'm wondering how I was not bleeding and how the heck it healed cause there's still a dent there
Bro I was got wallbang buy a nail gun😅😆
Hello daz, I am a big fan and I'm just wondering what that is on your chest? The comments seem to have not even noticed it 😃
congratssssss for surviving Daz
I feel jelouse bruh
Hey
Love you Daz!
Daz definitely got a new camera recently, everything is so crystal clear and high def compared to his older videos. I’m loving this new format, keep up the great work Daz!
Can you play God of war regnarok???
Would awesome if you came here to Australia and do a survival here ❤❤❤
plot twist: they are uploading daz pre recorded videos because he didnt survive
Love your videos Daz. I realised that in today’s video that the quality was like really good did you get a new camera.
Daz talking about crepes while I’m watching eating one
That's "aliens built the pyramids" thing better have been a joke because I will lose all respect I have for this man if it's true
is it just me or did the quality change? (in a good way)
Daz I've git a theory avouth the pyramids. So most poeple think it's slaves, others aliens... but what about alien slaves?? Maybe they build it
Is that a new microphone I see on your shirt?
Where is the trailer?
Random people doing their job flawlessly while Daz is also doing his job flawlessly 😊
the camera quality though
Glad you’re feeling better, I’m excited for the series
how is this 1080p? its like im watching in 8k, nice camera
I gotta say the video quality is amazing, don't want to sound like a  creep lol but daz's face is so clear
Are we going to talk ab the camera quality day is getting???
You look great
Wow new web camera
"I just survived on an island... and LIVED."
Love it when Daz posts!!! 💕
Is it just me or is the clarity of the camera much better? I guess he finally got a new camera that won't freeze. I only check YouTube to see if he posted something
Your arms are so orange
Is there still a trending page on YouTube? Damn I'm surprised, thought they removed it entirely 🤣. Cool Daz was on trending tho he deserves it
Awesome Daz, Love, and Hugs!
I can’t wait well done it’s a big accomplishment 🎉
I love the new face cam! 😁
Daz is one of the few things I look forward to in the week. 💖🖤
When I was a teenager, I was assisting my father with shingling the roof of our house we were building. I’d stand up with an armload of shingles and begin to walk across the roof… And I’d then hear that exact same sound of an air driven nail gun. He found it quite humorous to shoot nails at my feet if I wasn’t moving as fast as he wanted me to move. So, needless to say, I have a crippling fear of heights to this day.
When you're less than 3 minutes in and Daz has already begun a side rant, you know it's gonna be a good video
I want him to cook for us and call it Daz Cooks🥰😔
the only person they forgot to put in this complilation was daz <3
Who else thinks 90% of the comments are bots  👇
Daz I love u. U allwas cher mi upp when i hav had a bad day. Can u plzzzzzz riact to family gay ❤❤❤plzzzz
Happy thanks giving Daz
K but is no one gonna say a word about the food literally touching that dudes neck?! Yeah cool he can carry that many plates, but I don't want any of the ones that have his nasty neck sweat.
Where’s the trailer ?
☀️❤️🐣❤️☀️
It’s gonna be a good day when we see this handsome devil himself! I can’t help but laugh when Daz looses it! Sending cold Canadian love to y’all. ❤️🤍❤️
what happened to the blue yeti mic? :( It is has been an icon on your channel for years :(
My mum thinks aliens built the pyramids too she even has a compelling argument and it makes sense 😂
Is it just me or dose the colors in the video look very saturated,cause just now am I relising that his eyes are really yellow,and im a bit jealous
New Daz Watches hell ya

DO A BLOOPERS VIDEO AFTER THE 4 EPISODES 💖💖💖

"crape"
Day 1 of asking Daz to react to gibis bee movie Asmr
7:02 thats one fucked up glove
Nice vid
😅😅🤣🤣
We love you Daz! Glad to see your recovering. ❤️
Why does daz come back and he’s got a new impeccable camera
Why arent U on the List?❤
That finger story has me feeling ill bleugh
Actually, in my city (Ourense, in Spain) it's still common for the knife-grinder to drive his bike through the suburbs to sharpen people's tools. You can still hear his very distinctive flute sound announcing him followed by him yelling "afilador!" so loud you can hear him from several streets away. There's even a statue to honor the profession in one of the traffic circles near the university campus
I love you daz so I really need you to be on this list
Daz I'm glad ur back
Why is daz so saturated
It’s so good to see your face Daz.
I made a Christmas list with the number 1 as daz black merchant 🎉😂
Happy Thanksgiving Daz😊
Your tan is Dazzling Daz
Hehe I got a new phone and now I get to watch this on it weeeee
I’m glad you’re dazzling again
Daz I gotta say the quality and coloring in this video is 💋🤌🏼
Daz ur amazing! All the hard work you do to make amazing content! Love ur videos!
You should react to Nick accardo avocado
Daz watches immediately brightens up my day 🥰🥰🥰
Is it just me or does it look like Daz got a new camera? Or does he always look so good?
Love this guy
I love how casually daz speaks into the camera like he’s genuinely speaking to you personally.
"pissing blood everywhere" ✨aMaZiNGLy fLicKs hiS FInGeR uP nD DoWn✨ "help,its raining!" old man-"can u just stop bleeding" daz:looks annoyed "oh ok" ✨FlICkS fiNGerS AmAzINglY✨"ok done ive stopped bleeding"
I'm a second year archaeology student, aliens didn't build the pyramids, good to know more people are becoming archaeologists.

IM SOOOOOO EXITED TO SEE DAZ AND DAVES SURVIVAL 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
8:59😂😂😂
i cant wait to watch the survival series!!!
Imagine all those part for the new series is gonna be in total 1 minute long 😂.      Let's tell Daz to make all parts at least 1 hour per part
Let's appreciate for the loss of the microphone :( That mic had been through a lot and now it's gone... :(((
Love you

Happy thanksgiving dazz!!

W Dazli
okay daz with the lil tan
I worked in the office of a factory. My manager was one of the first aiders (there were two). The other first aider was helping with a machine and severely injured his finger. So he has to come up to the office to get sorted out. He was so casual about it lol making jokes with my manager as she was sorting him out
❤
I love your videos so much I was so worried that you weren’t gonna make it through the two weeks, how did Sara take it when you told her? That’s been my biggest question since I heard
Liking the new camera daz

saturation:📈 zooms: 📈mic: 📈
we are glad you recoverd
My dad also worked at a factory and he sliced his pinky off but it wasn't his fault it apparently was the factory's fault
Yo is that a new camera looks so sick damn
So happy your feeling 100 percent again Daz. Totally WAS worth nearly dying knowing you would fight through it
Omg a Daz watches on my Birthday? Fuck yeah!
If Daz says that he makes the best crepes, then we need a "Daz Cook's" series!
OK BUT IS IT JUST ME OR IS HIS CAMERA REALLY GOOD- LIKE WTF Y IS IT SO HIGH QUALITY LMAFO
Daz:feed me with a convier belt! My add: how to get fit!!
He knows what I was gonna say
The camera quality is so sharp or is it just the saturation
@Daz.  You have more than 8mill peeps that think your good at your job so don’t go changing careers .. Also I’m with you on the Aliens. 😊
Daz your videos absolutely slap what are you on about your are not useless in one way shape or form honestly x
New camera and different mic?
Daz got a new camera
if you make the best crêpes, then I think its time for a recipe and how to vid 👀👀
Congratulation on 8 million subscribers
Daz surviving for 2 weeks on a deserted island is proof that he'd be amazing at I'm a celebrity
New camera?
Hey dazzz
Love you Daz glad you are back and better it's always a good day when you upload also I LOVE ferrero rochers
6:54 I think there’s little air bubbles coming up. Or there’s holes in the sand
Daz? 🤨 that hand motion is quite suspicious
ferrero rochers honestly slap so hard
I would like to see Daz do a video series called Daz's story times where he talked about  Bad Weird and funny stories that happened to him in the past
You should watch Australia borderline security next
Love the comment about aliens and the pyramids at the end lmao. I’m in a classics class and my prof goes absolutely insane whenever someone mentions aliens creating ancient architecture
This video reminds me of the women who work in those german beer halls who carry all those jugs at once,  the defo do not get paid enough to shift all of those at once, holy sh** :P
can we just appreciate how daz quite literally risked his life for us omfg
I think those were matches, not incense
umm daz perhaps stupid question but what is that on your chest?
Can we just appreciate DAZ's tan 😂
Have u got a new camera ?
notice meee lol😅😅😅
what i thought of: A random boy in class not understand human anatomy: "Can't you just stop bleeding?" Me: "Alright *pop* ill just stop bleeding then!"  i hope someone finds this funny
Daz, we beg of you. Watch Dhar Mann!
Dude... "survived" on an island? Come on man...   I look forward to seeing your "survival" video nonetheless though!👍
Im so hyped for the new series!!! Hate survivor "reality" series but this looks sick!!!! Side note, u can tell which videos were prior to the "adventure" cuz of that intense tan XD
heyy bsf we missed uuuu
"Nah mate, aliens" 🤣🤣🤣
I studied to be an anthropologist and archeologist.  I still think the aliens did the pyramids sometimes. Lol. It’s all good daz.
9:15 am I the only that heard “incest”? When I thought he said “omg I love incest!” I died of laughter, I was like whaaat??😂
that camera quality though.
love the new camera daz!
The colour shocked me at the start fr some reason
is that a new camera? or is it the tan LMAO
In Kenya 🇰🇪 we have a ton of these n u give the guy like let's say $1 and he sharpens all ur and even ur neighbours knives for free so now he will come once a week to that spot n get a tip from everyone
MY BDAY IS THE 19TH OF DECEMBER AND ID LOVE TO SIT WITH MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO WATCH DAZ AND DAVE SURVIVAL!!! WE ALL LOVE AND SUPPORT YOU DAZ!!
Idk
is it just me or the camera looks way better?
Hey daz can we get the second part of the ghost hunt live stream plz ❤
Daz let me tell you this: I'll be disappointed If we're not getting a ''I HAVE MADE FIREEE'' and a ''WILSOOOOOOON'' moment in the Survival episodes 😂
You can tell how tired he is. Are you ok Daz?
6:18  Me: "WHEEZE"
Bro the trailer was SO FRICKING GOOOOOOD UGH
me - casually enjoying a food and drink  Daz- INFOMERCIAL VOICE /THINGSTHAT I ALWAYS MAKE FUN OF   ME- food and drink now everywhere xD
Daz can jou please do more videos of grounded please and keep up the fabulous work DAZ
Let's raise the minimum wage and pass universal healthcare!
Omfg I just thought Daz said 'I love insest' and it scared me lol
LOVE your content, you make me feel joy everyday and love your new mic and camera
First thing to note, has Daz got a new camera or recalibrate his webcam? All the colours are really warm and vivid. I like. 😁
More please : )
Wait, did I just hear Daz say he has a girlfriend?
perfectly I feel that my life was death line till I saw this jobs...🏴‍☠️🤡
How do i view the trailer for the survival? I cant find it
LOVE YOU DAZ!! So happy you guys are alright! Can’t wait to see more of the tropical island vids
I really want to see how you make crepes now lol
With the pyramids yes they could've shaped the rock sure, but how would they stack the millions of tons of stone used lol
Hi daz
Why is he not in the too good at their job?
what’s that little thing on his chest
i used to work in a deli, and at clean up I was cleaning one of the slicers.. thankfully the slicer was unplugged but I got my thumb caught and almost lost my right thumb
I love these videos I watch them all the time
yes
Soo cool :D
Subtitles please Daz .. Love from Malaysia ❤️
Yo been I’ll all day and just seeing your butifull face has made my day ☺️
daz you are invinsible <3
The camera quality in this vid is really nice
Not first
Me a server who can take 2 plates watching the guy with 30:  Move. Show me the mash isn’t on the bottom of a plate. Please I need to know. I need to comprehend the skill.
*Every workplace daz ever attended:* ”safe work-enviroment? I barely know her!”
So glad you‘re back healthy 😊 can‘t wait for the series! Love you Daz thanks for everything.
Daz needs glasses it clearly said air conditioner installation , and hes going on about window cleaning ??
I dont understand why daz was not on this list he is absolutely amazing and fabulous
Commenting before and after (before)
jesus christ the camera quality is looking extra crisp today. Love you Daz <3
1 HR DAZ! also im so happy ur alive, im sure everyone else is as well. u make me smile!!!!!!!!!!!!
The guy drawing the line on the car is actually one in 8 billion. Hes the only person in the world that is allowed to draw the coachline on rolls royce models, thats why he is so good in doing it. If he messes up, the whole car needs to be repainted.
Is it just me or is the camera quality amazing !!
Daz and Dave survival looks great!
I sold knives years ago and could make a corkscrew with a penny with the kitchen scissors that came with the set. At least 20yrs old and still work great.   It’s called a mandolin, onion slicer.   The claims bubble and you can see them.
Oi
Is it just me or daz’s camera quality is like way better than the other videos
Dude i saw a tikotk clip of u just casually eating ur boogers during a game. And omg dude…..
love you daz!! 💙💙
is it me or is dazs camera quality is more *crisp?*
My dog had puppies and one of them didn’t make it
I still have my scar
I cant wait until december man
Daz comes back from DEATH! And first vid is a Daz Watches. Best day ever! Also Happy Thanksgiving to anyone who celebrates 😊
Gaaaaay
Or you could bleed somewhere other than the workbench
Quantum is such a good channel!!
The sunflowers are put like that so a machine can come by and separate the seeds from the steams/head of the flower
Daren Black you are looking FABULOUS!! keep it up king 👑
Daz: talking about a traumatic event in his life about nearly cutting off his finger and having the cursed paper cut Also Daz: oh, hello phone.
Good thing I opened YouTube this early coz I didn’t get bloody notified for this post 😭 it came up on my recommended and I thought wait but I don’t have notifications tho
You are so cute and funny Daz🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😊😊
I don’t know why but I pictured that some how Daz and Dave picked a haunted island. I’m just waiting for the moment he yells for Dave because of a demonic squirrel or something moved too fast.
Why are there so many npcs 💀
Is it just me or did he get a new camera?❤
Nice camera!🎉
is it just me or do you have a better camera? because you look like you have better camera quality
Also nice tan daz in GORGEOUS
Just saying Daz is always too good at his job. Like damn he always makes me laugh the most. Truly the best entertainer alive.
My lines are more bent and wobble then James Charles
DAZ Aliens didn't build the pyramids. Humans with the accumulated knowledge of centuries of stonework built the pyramids. Also the supposed Perfection of the pyramids is a load of shit.
Honestly i didn’t expect Daz to release a vid soo quickly, literally made my day. Thanks Daz!!
He's back
Daz if ur not on this list it’s rigged
So excited for your survival video series
crisp camera
early
Daz is sorta livin proof that anyone can do anythin
I did the exact same window job got 9 years that’s awesome
After the pyramid comment, we need Daz watches ancient aliens 😂
Well done on your adventure 2 weeks daz were all glad your ok
bro daz has more jobs than jonny sins🤣
Love the new lighting
new camera?
So tanned 😂
Happy Thanksgiving Daz! Glad your okay!!!
The lighting on this vid: 👨‍🍳💋
shiiii I don't get paid enough either ahaha
Is there a filter on the video???
Um! Can I just say the camera detail in the video is mwa
is that a new camera?
We did build the pyramids thousands of years ago
BUT ALIANS DID BUILD THE PYRAMIDS THERE SO MUCH THAT PROVES IT
Did daz get a new camera ? or change the angle because he looks a lot more fabulous than he already
slay daz
Bring back the old mic.
That guy wasn't washing windows daz 😂
(in case Daz see's this) I'm a new creator do you have any tips?
You tanned a lot during this survival 😃😍
make sure at least one scene from the trailer is missing from the entire series. Something that will completely leave people hanging because of context loss. Always keep them wanting to know more.
new camera i see
(in case Daz see's this) I'm a new creator do you have any tips?
I am so grateful to know some one would risk there life for my entertainment. Thank you daz cary on with the great videose
I want daz to be my father
only chads watch till 13:14
is it just me or the quality of the camera is way better? But anyways thank you so much for these amazing videos daz!
AYYYEE DAZ IS BACK CURRENT DAY!!
Hey Daz did you get a new camera because you look great in this video like the colors are more vibrant than usual.
Anyone else noticing that he using a different mic?
Might be stupid but I would love to see daz with a beard he just seems like he would suit a beard so well fsr
Excuse u daz but I play golf and I have a badass imagination and mind
Look at that amazing camera quality

Hold up... Daz is a gamer, a great dad, *and* makes good crepes? .... The perfect man does exist 🥺
Love ya daz
Yes, my cure to depression has uploaded 😂
You are an icon of YouTube Daz, that’s why you are my favourite YouTuber of all time.
There is a new poppy’s playtime game coming out and this time it’s like multiplayer or something the trailer is scary
Hi
needed this
daz do you have a new camera??????????
Daz I think that “onion” was a little large 💀
We love you daz, we all love you.
I like your island face. 😂
thank you Daz for always keeping a positive attitude on these things
bruh don't do it again
Did Daz really cut of the video right before his signature move? 😢😨
Funny story we were moving and I was at school my mum was at work so is my stepdad the only person there was the landlord but he was downstairs and we lived upstairs and my brother was busy packing away knives and we had one of those wooden knife holders and my brother decided it would be a good idea 2 pick the whole thing up and all the knives Fell and the one serrated bread knife went through my brother's thumb and only one thread was holding my brother's thumb and he went downstairs calmly to our landlord bleeding out with blood all over the walls everywhere and knocked on landlord  door and said help I've cut off my finger they start freaking out they go to the emergency room long story short he still has his finger so let this be a lesson to kids don't play with Knives especially the serrated bread knives🤣🤣🤣
love you so much x
Aliens huh? I see Daz learned all of his history from the History channel.
So glad to see your doing better!! We all appreciate you so much for all that you do! Love you, you amazing British marvel!!!❤❤❤
I thought it was a joke when i first heard it but do Americans really pronounce crépes like that??? Y'all say it like you say grapes but we say it more like crap
How wanna play cod
The quality of daz's camera today is just 😘🤌
anybody but me realise how tanned he is?
Imagine being the guy who told Daz to just stop bleeding 🤡
i wish i was as strong as he is. Daz is literally my idol and i quite honestly see him as a genuine father figure to the world- ily daz keep doing what youre doing because there is no one as Dazzling as you <333333333333333333333333  *edit:* 3:28-3:30 slay dr suess
Ur great at ur job, making us laugh and giving people lifelust 🥰
oh i swear who doesn't love daz  after TWO WEEKS of almost DYING he still posts and doesn't just try to relax feels good to have him back LOVE YOU DAZ
IM SO EARLY OMG YAAAAAAS
What's black think with green light on his t shirt
Lets gooo >:D
As someone who gas worked with 200litre barrels, yes they are bloody heavy.. and I'm finding it hard to believe those barrels are full... if they are full they should sign for marvel🤣
Daz is my spirit animal
The quality on this video is scratching my brain
The fact that daz almost died 3 times because of some twat with a nail gun 💀
9:25 Yea when your a single dad with a daughter you feel like that sometimes
is it just me or does anyone watch him when u needing cure
nice video
my man is TANNED to perfection
Daz looks so tanned. Just shows how long he was outsidr
HA!
Maybe you should listen to your wife who is literally becoming an archaeologist instead of conspiracy theorists…
“Babe wake up, Daz uploaded! 😎💪🏼”  Edit: Love you Daz, always the best moment ever to see that you’ve uploaded. :)
Well ever Read….. The Root Races? There supposed theories.   Atlanteans we’re so advanced Humanity today still can’t figure out some of there secrets & knowledge. If they want to believe WE all came from Monkeys we’ll go ahead👋 But I Am 0 Negative (-0) so that theory is shot to hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm just happy you didn't eat each other 😊
Hi

I learned more stuff from Daz than my school
IN EARLY ❤❤❤
I would write a meaningful comment but I’m eating a pan au chocolate and it’s too much effort
did you do something different with the camera because it looks SICK
You are right, the aliens helped with the pyramids lol. I can't believe those 3 nails missed you! Im so glad you feel better, love you Daz!
Daz videos can always make the worst day so mutch better
Daz what about u and a 13 year old I’ve been hearing all about it please don’t tell me it’s true
he posted on thanksgiving! i dont have any family to go see. my friends and i might eat together. but they all have family so idk. i love that he posts. i missed daz.
Excited for Daz and Dave survival! Any thing with you in it is always amazing!
Oh nooooo the pyramids 😭😭😂😂
Clams have a tongue type thing that stick up and it makes a hole in the sand it will squirt water out that that’s how you know where the clams are

Day 25 of asking to watch ASMR pennywise does your makeup.
Omg Daz your back! Thank you so much for posting and you look a lot tanner 😳
Happy Thanksgiving Daz, WE LOVE YOU <3
Good quality webcam
B*tch be like Jedi with the pink barrel
Is it just me or did his camera get better
Hope to meet you one day! ❤
Ok but the camera quality 👐
11:47   NO PLEASE NO If I see this I’m leaving the restaurant! He has his FACE on the top plates and he’s breathing right onto the food 😭 😭
I have worked with a ton of older working men, my grandfather being one of them. The thing about them is, they know you’re bleeding, they know you’re hurt, but they also have shit to do. They want you to get help but they also want to be able to do their job and if you’re bleeding all over their shit, they can’t work. Then there are some who just don’t give a shit at all. I’m hoping he was one of them my grandfather a type of working old man, crabby, wanting to get shit done but at the end of it, asking if you’re OK. I am a visually impaired woman who works with trees and wood splitting and lifting heavy logs. That’s how we keep our house warm and there is tons of room for injury with that, very little room for halting progress. If I get hurt, I just have to go in and fix my injury and come back out and finish helping them, that’s how it works… You stop the bleeding and dress the wound and get back to work. It’s actually really funny because me as a visually impaired person, the more serious injuries happened to the sighted people. Even me working with the wood splitter, I didn’t cut myself at once but I go to work at a re-factory and I end up cutting myself on the first day? I mean I guess I didn’t know you were supposed to wear gloves while cutting the pine… I don’t know.
Day5 of asking to please play a Days Gone gaming series
So glad your feeling better, can't wait to watch 😀
Hello!!!👋😁✨
Nice camera upgrade ;)
Hi daz I hope your ok
Can not wait for more Daz Ghost Hunt LIVE. I loved the one on Halloween.
Anyone got the number of the guy cutting plantation. I got weeds on my garden that need his attention
Is this a new camera? The quality is really good❤
I love these videos when one thing leads to Daz talking about past experiences and it just ends upbeing so interesting
Loved that
I love how people genuinely believe that burning a smelly stick can get rid of "negative energy". Literally, energy just powers things - it isn't positive or negative lol.
" daz watches people almost as skilled as him"
new camera?
YouTube ads getting more frequent and annoying while we approach Christmas. Is it just me or is anyone else noticing this S*IT?
All these people getting fired immediately after their bosses see this video. 🤣 And the guys wrapping those boxes are doing it manually when there's an actual machine that does that for you. 🤦🏻‍♂️ They probably don't have one, but there's a way to do that without getting fired. 🤣
U make me laugh i love u
i love the new camera daz
finally im early btw daz on your vr headset you need to play into the radius its a post apocalyptic vr survival game but its really good and id love to see you play it
Great video as always Daz, can't wait for Daz and Dave survival!!
I like how 4,000 people are already here when the vid came out 30 mins ago
can't wait for the survival series, Daz is a true legend
I actually have a job making the things that help open and close the windows. Also, we make the locks for your windows too, depending.
Hay daz can you please react to NICKACADO AVOCADO
YESSS DAZ
New Camera? Or just Daz shining again... Looking good mate!
And we will still never figure out what was the whole story with the kids and why they are building our solar systems in that music video.

I've been watching you for sooo long n love your content! I'm so excited for the Daz and Dave survival :DD
He is backkkkkk😀😀😀
In Argentina we have three types of street workers that are half legend half the best. The men in a "is working because I need to work otherwise is trash" type of truck with a megaphobe that either sells veggies and fruit stupidly cheap or buys scrap and old electrodomestics to repair/sell their parts. And the third one, the sharpener, they go around with their bicycles door to door ringing to ask you if you need scissors knives or your sight sharpened. With a mechanism he locks the front door and powers the stone. And let me tell you if it is a good sharpener that thing would cut diamonds. Just wanted to share the most beautiful, old and traditional urban street jobs in Argentina.
This is awesome! Happy thanksgiving if it is for you! Hi Daz btw!
Ooh earlyish
Carrying that much as a server we are told not to be it can cause so many issues. And lawsuits!

Can I come over for a crape plz daz 😂❤
Daz better be on the list
Always love watching Daz he always manages to make me laugh 😂
Hey daz how are you today? Good to see you looking 'hell yes gorgeous!' Happy Thursday 🤘 P.S it's nice to see you perky and back to yourself. No rush because you are bound to be exhausted. But I did miss you.... We all missed you.... Glad your doing good.  I can't wait for December.  Kind regard's, Lawton, UK 🇬🇧
Happy Thanksgiving Daz 🎉❤
