a bit late on this, but one day I hope the boys consider trying a fender-roller with the stock suspension first, as I'm almost certain they are designed to be used before you slam it to the ground with aftermarket suspension...could be wrong idk man just a thought
Proportion valve  type?  40/40 30/30? Model?
5000 usd and you did not put spoon caliphers in the back what a massive rip off..
Does that eg have ABS?
$4500* since they already did the suspension. So now its 9500
Fire video
I would rather have the ugly donut civic $500 edition over the brand new civic!
Do you have videos on brakepads for cheap vs expensive on stock caliper and stock brake discs?
This was NOT a year ago
I have problem with my brakes (not spoon)... I did 282 swap on my eg paired with stock drum brakes on the rear. Everything is brand new on the front and drum brakes are fairly okay. Everything was bled out but when I start the car, brake pedal sinks... I replaced the bmc with bigger one (7/8 to 13/16) and same thing. Changed the brake booster and still nothing. Can someone help me figure this out cause it's driving me mad
But what car is the knuckle  from? my car is 2000 Honda civic so what higher model would I need for a big brake kit ?
Do you still need to use anti seize on the rotors?
i think it's a super great idea to use the middle option with the upgrades.   yeah,  you can go super cheap/lo, but the risks to using the super cheap parts were pretty obvious with the lo car(s).
All that work for pedestrian brake fluid? These guys are goofy
honda with RPF... looks very honda😅
Civic brakes are already good  Need to upgrade prelude 4th generation
8:50 Brill! Thee Accuracy tho *chef’s kiss 🙌🏾💯
3:52 I’m not going to hold y’all... 😏😈💯
Bedding in brakes noobs much? You're are meant to bed in new brakes in short pulses, not just burying your foot and holding them on. Doing that glazes the pads and can "blue" the disks, which gives you a worse surface than if you bed them in the correct way. You start by little pushes, then more. You do that until they feel good (once the pad & rotor surfaces have made love) THEN you can just hold them on. Noobs....
Can't believe you guys don't have a vacuum pot you attach to an air compressor, to suck brake fluid through. It's so much faster, and them you just do a couple of peddle down, squirt, nip up the nipple- things, rather than heaps. So much better for sucking through fluid on new brake gear.
Question: why didn’t you lose the brake booster? You get much better brake feel, even if you lose a little brake efficiency.
Did you replace the lines on the back brakes? If they’re rubber and they swelled, they’ll let fluid in but not back out again. Could lock up a caliper
drop a K20 in it
Why didn’t they put drilled and slotted rotors on the front but just did it on the back?
Can y’all donate this setup for my Ek? lol
Are there two seperate brakes for the front and rear tires, which is the spoon and  stock? Does this go for all cars? (I'm a beginner)
Im digging these videos.  Love when yall focus on one car and add to it. could do a better job of organizng the videos. I want to watch one particular car and the vidoes about it in order and dont see an option. could be that youtube is just a difficult operating system to post up on.
I’m only 7.5 mins in but are the rear brakes larger, drilled and slotted and the fronts are smaller and solid plain disks?
Its no way near 5k. Maybe 2.5k
What civic did he get the knuckles from, to be able to put the spoon calipers??
phone book technique imo
Stay strong Jimmy. 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Spoon is good.. i like to spoon
MOAR CAR BUILD CONTENT PLS
How do you let that go 😮 Scared to drive that death machine with the one wheel locking up
Which Honda rotor is that?
Calipers are sometimes sticky when you first put them on. May take some time for things to loosen. But woah, never knew about brake bedding. Thanks Zack
Just picked up my eg hatch this weekend and im loving the series ‼️
“Ooooh yeaahhh, gettin all hawt and bothered😏😩” - Zach
2 spoon calipers and lines were $5000, wtf man lol
Could we get a "Pumprey Up2speed" where he learns to be a mechanic along with his role as YouTube presenter? Get James UP2SPEED! On turning wrenches?
Honda power!!!!
I got big brake kit for my mk7 gti yesterday, they said the first 100 miles TRY to not brake aggresive.. ??
People think to go faster on a track its all about more bhp, but this is gonna improve the average speed on this car by A LOT. I love to go on track days and i remember when i upgraded the brakes on my old golf gti, i was able to reduce like 3 second seconds off my pb, and im not even a great pilot. One of the best upgrades you can do
What is the fitment on the wheels?
I have a question because I am not a gearhead. But why aluminum rotors and not ceramic? Don't ceramic rotors displace heat better? Do forgive my ignorance.
I bet money it was the ebrake setup that was binding. Sometimes when you put it back the caliper squeezes the rotor at an angle because there's no wheel to hold it aligned. That can cause the e-brake system to catch and lock up the pad. I've had it happen twice and both times reinstalling the rotor has fixed it with no issues
Is it okay if the rear and front have different rotor sizes and calipers? Doesn't that create a permanent brake balance percentage?
Watching these Honda videos, I definitely have more respect for 90s Hondas. They were built well, super simple and they look better than pretty much all modern civics
Why would you do all this work and put crap brake fluid in. At least put some Motul 600 or equivalent in it.
Shout out to Toyota for finally getting rid of rear drum brakes on the Tacoma with the 2024 4th gen. Its about damn time.
what rotors and calipers were used on the rear?
YESSS MO MONEY PIT!!!!!
Eg the SiR killer.
More power=k20
Keep this going 🎉
No ABS? You guys need to do some sit ups and get some abs on that thing
Civic came a long way in a short period of time👀🔥🔥
What is the wheel and tire spec?
Hi Low VW golf
Hi Low Ford Focus
Hi Low Hyundai Genesis
Hi Low Hyundai Tiburon
Do Hi &Low 2010 thru 2013 Kia Forte Koup SX 2.4L. That's a car that's gonna give anyone a challenge.   Limited aftermarket parts.😂🤣😂🤣
@donut can you make a civic Playlist please?
why not replace the rear toe arms and RTA bushings??? THEN get an alignment.
Should install a Honed Development brake booster delete kit next!!
Love it. I have a 97 EK4 Si and just putting it together. We have a Honda club and this is inspiring!!!
spoon calipers are not $5000, let alone the whole knuckle, rear disc, prop valve conversion. especially still being 4 lug, AND 32mm lol.
Your channel was barely recommended to me and I love the content already. I have new videos to watch to relax🤝🏽
Dude I would love for you guys to work on my car.
Stop putting Jimmy on camera. Literally no one wants this other than Jimmy.
You should have cleaned and painted everything while you were at it
Respect for always explaining how things work.
I like these little civic, they are compact and useful
When is the next part
Been 1 month. we're waiting for the next mod
Low-key got me motivated to touch my eg again watching this video
When is next time
neeeed moar of this civic build!
Update,?
yea... the back wheel didnt stop spinning at the end.
500? Ain’t no way everyone wants 3-7 k for theirs
We’re waiting for the follow up video!!
where d hell you bought that eg body for $500??? Thats the most surprising part
drop an ALH in there
Lucky you guys can get cheap egs in Indonesia it costs like crazy
Love this series! More of these please!❤
Stops onna dime n gives you 9 cents change...😂
Where is part 2??
That $50K Civic Type R is looking better and better.
put a k20 and add a rotrex :))
Put that freaking jz engine in that car and start flying
Swap the engine please
k20 swap
Bro jus bought a eg hatch for $500 and i’m struggling to find any clean ones in fl for under 5k🤣
😢where’s the new episode
My xrs 2009 Toyota matrix came factory with some half ass drilled Rotors/brakes. I bought it used w/ 40k and basic rotors, but put upgrades pads on it. I still was being pushed into intersections. I finally found American made rotors drilled/slotted and galvanized nrs brake pads. What a difference !!! I will never buy any other type of pad / rotor combo I just learned from this vid how important brake lines are tho
This was my first donut video now here i am watching all their older videos as well
"Sometimes you take it apart, you put it back together, and it's all better."  Yeah, being a computer tech, that also applies. There are cases where something seems to be completely bricked, then you just take it apart to look inside, then put it back together without actually fixing anything....And it just works. Not complaining, tho.
jimmy cringing at the hammer job cracked me up.
I really hope they do the civic justice with a turbo and a roll cage I’m talking for racing parts in the motor nice exhaust out of the hood like all ricers have. “The dream”
I wanted to see actual stopping distance measured...
No stopping distance test? damn
Its a waste to put spoon in this civic
When's the next episode?
K24 not K20. Awd turbo or NA fwd with revs and maybe nos.
What a GOAT car
I used to "bed brakes" that way and then read that they should be used gently until the pads wear into the new disc. Which is it????
@3:54 What year integra is the brake master cylinder from? Don't you have to use the integra brake booster to make that fit????
I love civic's
Hector is going to be running 3 Honda Civics with spoon engines. And on top of that he just came into Harry's and he ordered 3 T66 turbos, with NOS, and a Motec system exhaust. He probably needs some good brakes.
dayum, they took a $500.75 civic and turned it into a $500.99 civic
Don't think I ever really cared to invest in an EG til watching this series
Why is this taking a month between episodes?? This is the content we come to see. Not watching “the cheapest lambo” contest
did the rear started to rotate freely? it did not look good at all, since you installed it at 5:42.
Why would you use universal hub spacers behind the discs surely that will make the wheel balance even worse 😢
Bro hurry up and give us more of this Civic build
Make it more power
You gotta k20a swap
Do a b series build with a turbo charged
Can you guys please find a 2013 Megane RS 265 2.0T to work on. Would love to see something like that being worked on. Since I have one.
More civic videos
Yo what kind of shop is this I’m looking to upgrade my car
this is a grreat video my 1998 150k mile family 4 door non hatch honda civic with a D16Y17 MOTOR  has drums breaks and i was wondering what to do if my drum breaks give out so thank you!
Must be getting ready for race wars
my dads got a vte swapped civic
I’d be fine without that music. 🤢🤮
3:36 IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING BOCA JUNIORS REFERENCE???
We need motor work on it now
Is this new Money Pit?
Do a K swap
Wrao it a color
$ 500 !!!!!  that would be around $20000 at min in my country :(
Everyone bedding their breaks here in California at the same time all day
why is a 1991 civic worth 3,000$ in my fucking country😡
K swap it
Why can’t you guys get an air tank and air tools?
does that car have ABS? if not that will explain the front brakes locking
Integra front end
Go B Series
More power mean engine swap baby..😅
Anyone know which knuckle I need? I have an eg si Ty!
@Donut why won’t we get an performance exhaust?
Bro $500 on that civic is a steal. Inflation should have this banger at $5000
@donutmedia the next project will be the engine k24a vtec, need some vtec 😊.. cant event wait for the engine episode
Donut should do an Evo or Supra Hi-Lo
Moe powa babeh
Please please PLEASE consider wrapping it to look like the red EG from initial d
I hope I see a kswap in the next episode
Listen guys. I hardly ever comment on any type of YouTube video at all. However, I have absolutely loved the Hilow series for all three different vehicles. And I am asking, Nay, begging for you to complete this build and give this car all the glory she deserves! The Honda civic kickstarted my love for hatchbacks! Give her all the late 90’s early mid 2000’s love, adoration, and styling she deserves! But most of all, make it kick the ass of the modern atrocity that is the new civic! Love you guys!   Sincerely, a guy who was born in the late 80’s, raised in the 90’s and in high school in the mid 2000’s ❤
Slap  a little Mitsubishi turbo on it . Please
please do an all motor build. I am so sick of turbo builds. Hell I'll take a supercharger build if you really need boost.
When is the next video!!!!????? 😢
Coating on the brakes 😆🤔
Guys! I love yas but man. There comes a time where you gotta add things up. You said bought the car for "$500" ok fairy tail scenario not gonna count the amount of money it took get it running but at this point this car already had a 4k suspension setup. So you're putting 5k brakes on a 4.5k car. 😅 you were to sell that car and add a Donut sticker with a picture of yall and some signature as is I'd be easy 10/15k car guesstimate
What you guys can’t afford MUGEN? Lol
Not only will it not be worth a money, without upgrading the tires, you're not going to accomplish anything much at all.
Build a kit car!!!
love this civic hope they do it justice and make it sickk
This car would look good with a face lift, ya know; tint, hood vents, spoiler, carbon fiber wrap, etc...
I came here because of Forza Horizon 5's latest stories, stayed for the education on brakes.  Been playing Car Mechanic Sim on Xbox as well so I feel like I'm using two resources
Don't come to a complete stop when you do the brake bedding or you can leave an imprint on a single spot on the rotors. After you get good brake fade, then drive for a few min without hitting the brakes so both surfaces cool separately. It's tricky so find a wide open road. Great vid!
Drop a k24 inside would be IN FKING SAINE
I really love the start of this series, just bought my own 95 Civic EX a few weeks ago so its perfect. WOULD LOVE TO SEE A COLD AIR INTAKE VID SOON!!
Upgrade the mugs and engine.
Low car, high car civics?
That's a sick hoodie
Its so crazy, when I got my miata you guys made a miata series, and now I just bought a hatchback and yall are making a series on the civic.
When k swap
if you plan on getting this thing more power i would reccomend getting a brake booster delete, it makes the feeling of the brakes a lot better on cornering and give u more of a feel for how hard ur pressing the brakes negates a lot of chance for understeer from braking too much before a turn
I love the color of the car for some reason
i hope you guys throw a integra type r b18c into it!!!!
My favorite gen, I miss my 95 EG6 & 9.
Yes, I love it! Spoon it sooo hard! Big, little, soup, tsp, little babe toddler spoon… all the spoons !
It's gotta have a spoon engine
That beat goes hard. Who’s the artist?
Guys hear me out tune this civic with a laptop and boyyy will it be fast
I love how every Honda video is just like yeah we’re pretty much just trying to make it an Acura but with Honda swag
Zero knowledge on cars in general. This video had me invested all the way through.
brakes are for p*ssies
B16 b20 Frankenstein would be dope
Forge the engine a put a turbo
Hey where’s the new video?! We’re waiting
Fully built all motor single cam D
Nice front calipers everything else is just upgraded stock stuff. So with the used suspension parts and brakes what was the real price?  $1500?
Ls swap
"We Put $5000 Brakes on our $500 Civic" That's literally every honda civic owner lol
Raffle that civic ❤❤❤
🧢 on the $500 civic claim. NO 1 would never sell a running hatch that cheap. Can't ev n find a clean shell for 500.... -____-
Where are you finding a $500.00 Civic!!!! lol
Why is this series not called "High ON Low"?
Paint it red
Put k24 on it baby
You gotta do a v tec just kicked in you video, so...2.0 dual OH?
More!!! We want this to continue!!!
I thought I knew what bedding brakes was.. thanks for learning me proper.
This channel is the best. Entertaining and teaches you as well. im getting into the car culture and this was extremely helpful
You should turbo and put a body kit on it
you ve done it all backwards. First is more power, then more power, then more power and then you can worry about brakes
If I buy a new vehicle do breaks need to be bedded.?
How about tuning up an old Volvo 240?
Anti row bar
was kinda hoping this was gonna be a new season of high low lol
You should do a engine swap
Supercharger! Let's break 100 WHP!
zach jobe is the love of my life
I just learn ,amazing from cars.thank you to donut.☺☺
crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a room, a concrete room. A concrete room full of men hammering a honda civic. The men hammering a honda civic made me crazy. crazy? I was crazy once.

you put the rear rotors on the wrong direction?
Can you do the same thing to my $500 civic but instead of breaks fix the AC
I see you got yourself a little Seiko5 GMT on Jubilee. Not a bad change from G-Shocks.
B18 or B16 or gonna go crazy with a k20
Boost that SOHC engine till it blows up! Then swap a K20 in there.
I am so along for this series, however many more episodes you guys plan to do. It's super fun to see a car improve as you go along.
Definitely want to see more on this. Should upgrade the engine next..v8 Hayabusa radical motor sports plz
Need more money pit !!
I miss my eg
We need for z350
i love how effortless these videos always look LOL. took me over 2 days of work to replace wishbone+shocks+tie rods and all that bang on a 2001 car LOL
In Italiy the average classic Civic costs around 8k euros, while the ugly last gen Civic costs even 4k 🤙 Europe is love.
Man... High-Low's on a bit of a rebound i'n't it?
K20a swap
I'm drooling thinking of all the potential of this project 🍿🍿🍿
Now it's worth 5500 bucks
This shop is located near Arbor Vita and Sepulveda
How much were the parts ?
Why not use a baseball bat to roll the fenders?
Put 50k into this than do built vs bought type r
They should super charge this one and talk about the differences between turbos and Supers
K swap.....
add maybe A new intake from K & N and maybe some new fuel injectors
Swap in the K24 please! Thanks!!!
YouTube is threatening me
$500 for this civic? in denver, mfs would ask 3-4k in this condition, before you changed anything to it... lol
This is my dream car I wish I could get it 😞
“These are drum brakes which were common until not that long ago” yeah the 2023 Toyota Tacoma has them…
if you do wantt to roll a fender without hammering it just get a handle from a jack and put it between the wheel and the quarter panel or fender and have a friend reverse the car and the handle will roll with the wheel and then roll the fender.
Where do you get these parts from?
We need more videos of this car
its just a car jimmy it can be replaced.
wash it 😂
PLEASE CAN WE GET MORE SCREWDRIVER REVIEWS. PUT THIS DYING HORSE DOWN ALREADY
this is the kind of content I followed donut for
You paid $5,000 for used parts, Honda discs, a proportioning valve, a master cylinder, brake lines, and 2 calipers? You guys got ripped off badly. Where the hell did the majority of that go?  You could have bought the calipers and discs from a Porsche (or most other performance cars), paid someone to make custom adapter brackets, and still had well over $1,000 left over. That setup would be a significant upgrade from the $5,000 setup. And I only included the custom brackets to maximize the counterexample - the brackets to put Porsche brakes on a Civic already exist, and cost less than $300.  6 piston Wilwood front brakes (calipers, rotors, lines, adapters) for a Civic are $1100.   I understand the money pit idea, but this was either just burning money unnecessarily for mediocre parts at best, or this video was purely an advertisement for Spoon.  Also, have you guys never heard of a baseball bat? Hammering the fenders was totally the wrong way to do this.
K swap this bad boy 😩
Waiting for part 3
Dam where can I buy a $500 civic
More power baby!
That eg needs a jdm spoiler plz
What you should do next with that Civic is fill it with tannerite and have Adam Savage blow it up because it's a Civic..
Zach has such a great way of explaining what he does. Loving this series as a EP2 Civic owner. Was gonna sell up but kinda want to throw money at it to get it up to scratch
K Swap it
Low car high car 2011 Honda civic si🙏!!!!
This is gonna be a $80,000 Civic by the time he's finished 😂😂😂
Y'all know what type of Honda that is?
big spoiler, but put it on the front, because fwd!
ZL1 swap ez pz
I'd love to see a k swap and a good paint job 👌🏼
K swap it you already have the engine
now that it has good brakes they need to put the k20 in it
K24a or hellcat motor
It may of come a long way in a short time but it took lots of money.
Weldone Brooo good work.
Yall are putting that k20 in it aren't ya? Hell yes.
Dose anyone know what knuckle that other car belongs too,I wanna do a break swap too but I don’t know what car that’s from
This is In Inglewood lol I recognize the streets
What engine is going in?
They definitely using a K&N filter for more powwaa baaaby
This is a valley kids dream Honda lol not clean at all, but clean enough. Good as suspension and brake setup
Bro how do we have the same coilovers 😂, i love it ❤ great Vid  🇲🇿
*Insert some F&F quotes* this Civic is begging for a Spoon engine 🤪 Hector would be proud 😬
Disappointed there’s no comment about hector coming into Harry’s and ordering 3 spoon engines
Why not drilled/slotted on fronts
You should do a weight reduction video on the car. Which includes removing all the sound deadening material with dry ice to make it super easy.
Phonk music at the end was crazy
thought there would be some comparison...
I would guess a b20 or b18 with vtec head
Had no idea discs needed to be seasoned like a cast iron skillet.
Turbo!!!
If the rest of the brake fluid is the same color as what was in that bottle, I know why you were getting fade. 🙂  The first thing to do with fading brakes is to completely flush the brake system with fresh, high temp fluid.  I do love your channel though :-)
I can tell your new to the car scene, you drive and Elantra 😂
That’s a 5k Honda In ny lol
Nice nice
AWD and K swap it 👀
Bigger is better until it doesn’t fit 🙈
k24 swap please then run it on the track, it be a track monster
Personally I love the idea, someone, somewhere. IS actually looking at this video.. so that they can actually go out and install $5000 brakes on their rusted out $500 civic
You’re sponsored by spoon now? Awesome
Instructions unclear, my Civic started talking to me through the car stereo.
LETS GOOOOO MORE CIVICCCCC
thats literally one of my favourite Cars, pls get me one for 500 plsss lol
eBay turbo
@0:15 seconds in and the blue-green volvo xc90 in the shot lol thats my moms old vehicle !!!!!!!!
Need to drop that k series in it
Engine swap.?
Sell me that civic place
It appears that you don't need the brake bias, your front wheels locked up and your rear wheels didn't shown around 11:39 of the video.  So ahead and remove the bias.
K swap. Did someone say k swap?
Those brakes are so much nicer than the car
7:30 true panel beaters
Hector would be really proud
just do engine upgrades, itb's, intake, straight pipes, keep it na.
disappointed at the lack of shouting MOAR POWAAAA BABAAAAAAAAAAAY!
In EU, we put brakes from the VTI MB civic and 280mm front 260mm back is quite the track setup. Also the EP3 300mm front brakes fit with a custom bracket. So plenty of stopping power upgrades for pretty cheap. MB front and rear brakes + sway bars are I think similar/the same on the Integra.
Don't do the b18 swap. You better drop a k20 in that B!$@&
This build look so sexy ❤❤
can you make it faster as cheap as possible? :D that would be fun
I'll never understand these guys
Mfs finna start bedding brakes in the fn highway 😂
Love this series you guys should do another civic like a em2
B18 swap
In malaysia they sell civic eg6 for 60k ringgit or more..about 13k usd….😢😢😢
Just how did you manage to buy an EG for just 500$ !? I mean if were about to buy a clean stock EG in my country (iran🇮🇷) you'd have to easily pay like 10k for it. And then you'd hit the parts problem cuz there's no parts for it here whatsoever😢😬
I would of went with a company like brembo a company thats a brake company not just a flex high dollar japanese only tuner company
All it needs left is refurbished engine, paintjob and interior
jobe! jobe! jobe!
my guess is a b16 swap. maybe a k20 swap but b16 feels right for this car
k swap!!!
zach wearin a classy seiko gmt 👌
Money Pit 3.0?
god pop
Let's do a AWD conversion for the civic
K Swap
more russiаn phonk music pleassseaaseee
Exhaust is next
A lot of guys on the track say spoons are not worth the money. Go with stoptech and never wolwood
Now do an f1 engine swap
You missed the big bushings on the rear control arms when you did suspension, now you had them disassembled from the car and missed them again...
Oh my GOD! I NEED A 500$ EG6 😭😭 they cost on average 5k€ in Europe 😭 haven't seen a cheap one in years
That’s actually a 12,000$ civic these days.
K swap that thing man! Make some MO POWER BABY 😤
You should do an episode devoted to all the Hot Boy Civics out there. Excessive Neon, Ridiculous poor fitting body kits, and the Folgers can tail pipe out back 😂
So if your getting trailing arms why not just get crv trailing arms? Leaves the option to go awd open.
we need more content on this civic
Love seeing older cars get the attention and upgrades they need
WHEN YOU HAVE 15 TO 25K TO DUMP INTO A PROJECT CAR
No spoon brakes for the rear?
LOL YEAH A BIT MORE OF AN UPGRAGE THAN JUST BRAKE CALIPERS AND ROTORS ON A BASE CIVIC
Not many people even know about bedding brakes, so shoutout to you guys for fully explaining that!
putting the spacer behind the rotor is at nono ;)
Having a big brake kit doesn’t mean you can 100% trust your always going to brake. I have a front big brake kit now on my Scirocco cost me about €2000.   I don’t get brake fade but on night while some spirited driving was happening my tired bumped up from uneven road surface. This happend right before a corner when I wanted to brake however abs kicked in and I wasn’t slowing down immediately. It did finally make contact and brake but I went faster trough that corner than I would’ve liked.  Me and car both are okay and nothing happened but this shows me the importants of a good suspension which will be my next mod(KW V3). However first I need to save more money.
❤ Toyota Corolla GR❤ What is Barrett from down under!?!
make this civic fastest civic in region
This should have a "There were no Integra's harmed in creation of this video" disclaimer
Always called it braking in the breaks but tomato tomato
overall spoon swap
K swap next
It seems they're "a bit overpowered" 4 that car..?😂
hondaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
That Batman GMT tho, hot damn!
I love this series so much. Taking an old car, and making it drive beautifully with brand new, upgraded parts. MONEY PIT NUMBER TWO!! I learn so much from them, never knew such a thing as a proportion valve existed
Day 368:Of Asking Donut Media to Build a Ford Thunder (you can call it the Ford Lightning Lightning if you want
Raise your hand if your first Donut Video was the 240sx UP TO SPEED from 7 years ago!
Spoiler alert they're k-swapping it
Fwd sr20 swap
Anything German
I AM A SURGEON! I AM A SURGEON! I AM A SURGEON!
Mo' power baby! There are so many DOHC options for power. Your engine will give you the most out of your aftermarket options as well😅.  But you gotta start with an engine swap, and work your way to turbo + waste gate + manifold + intake setup. Then new rims so you can get your old ones back to the Miata.
supercharged civic next episode?
It needs a bigggg tudbskkiii
whats next a new catback exhaust?? or  the k20a
There's no $500 civic ya lying dawg
Motor swap!!!! 😂😂😂
cant wait for the civic to be fully upgraded just like the e Hi/Lo series
I challenge you to put a turbo on the Civic next video, if not, you're all pussies. :))
this is civic is the new money pit right? right?
I could use 2-3 more "money pit" style videos like this at a time. 💸🕳
B series please
People always talk about calibers but no one ever really talks about master cylinders i have a 97 tahoe k1500 with stock calibers (i rebuilt them) ,steel braided lines and the ppv master cylinder,stock rotors and all new fluid and its now the best stopping truck I've owned im glad they covered all of your brakes
This is like high car money pit. Cool hybrid. This civic will be sick when you guys are done with it.
Mo POWA Babeh!!!!
Zack I hope you are going to put a bigger engine in that Civic?
time attack honda inc
if u have a cheap paint job video that’s be dope imma look for one after but i love these videos
BRING UP TO SPEED BACK
its a 10,000 dollar civic now lol
LS swap! LS swap!
I miss my si I sold it because we had kids but watching this make me miss my car 😂
Oh yea! So satisfying . Cant wait for MO POWA!!
How is this not 'Money Pit'???
Man I love how this guy treat their cars, I would love to see you putting the  racing seats Noland said in the 50,000 vs 500 video ! Love the videos keep up the great work !
So when I weighed my DX trailing arms they were 7lbs less than the EX ones. Anyone who does drag racing can confirm the drums weigh less than the discs, that's why the CX and DX can make such killer cars, they weigh so little.
Soo no comparison?? This is a little wierd.
Of course I learn about brake burning on land vehicles (I’m an aircraft mechanic) about a month after changing the brakes on my truck and not doing so
Top tip:  find a close backroad to bed the brakes, that way you can avoid traffic, and stop lights. It's ideal to keep moving,  if you have to stop, slow way down and creep until that light turns green,  then after bedding try to drive for like 5 minutes without using the brakes, to allow them to cool down.  I live in the country so this is easy for me,  but, if not,  try to plan an ideal route if you can
Yeah, I’ll have a 2j in the civic please. Thank you 🙏
it would be cool if you transform that civic into a drag race civic or do a low and hi car but for drag race!
Why spoon solid rotors up front, but undersized powerstop drilled and slotted out back?
hammer on the castle nut 😭😭
Clean EG hatch is EASY 4-5k these days.
I've been wanting to change my drum breaks for disks but I can't find a kit anywhere. I have a 2011 Nissan Cube.
why put a $5000 brake in a slow stock motor car if you cant us it when going slow…. 😂
new track toy would be awesome. throw in a K24 and go crazy
New name for the series "Unshitting the box"
335i
B18
Make it awd?
So they put "$5000" brakes and used basic rotors instead of drilled and slotted?
I love old school 90’s civics. I’d love to see a B series swap for more power but keep it NA. Just let it rev
K AWD
Exhaust next? That's what I'm most keen to see - the series is inspiring me to modify my Corolla but in a rally style (roads aren't flat enough for lowering around here).
Keep in mind for you all playing along at home. A powerstop z23 kit works wonders for cheap on a civic. I had fade issues too, only took till they were so faded I had no option but to run from someone *wink wink* doing 100km/h with only the e brake to slow down 🤣
Forged internals and turbo??????
Buys extremely overpriced calipers, massages fender with a hammer, and puts eBay lookin rotors in the rear...yup, this is why real car enthusiast don't like Donut and the lowest common denominator rush towards it like it's the McDonald's of car content.
He’s running 3 Honda civics, spoon engines
K swap it!
I like this because this concept is what I do to get to know a car on a video game, start with stock, first upgrade is brakes, then suspension. And I'll play with that for a while before power upgrades!
$5,000 brakes with a horrible $5 spacer behind the disc 🤮
Put a turbo on the honda
2006 nissan sentra se-r spec v
Super charged f series swap for more power 🤯🔥💪🏾🙏🏽✌🏽
I work in IT and every time I watch these videos I wish I had studied to become a mechanic. Work actually looks fun and interesting.
turboeeeeeeeee baebi😈
Coff dot 5.1?...that is all
This series makes me miss doing autox. I sold my car for a truck because I missed having a truck and I like going overlanding, but I still would like to do some autox again one of these days. Also that wheel fitment looks absolutely perfect for that civic
Can you guys please do a series with the civic like the money pit miata. Please 😊
Spoon engine
5000.00 and not even drilled and slotted?
Where did u even find a civic for 500$ 😭😭😭
Can I buy this civic off you guys once it’s done?
Do a Hi low with integras!
Put the K24 from the previous episode in it
Zac seems miserable.
Do a raw NA k series swap make the exhaust roudy too
It’s weird how the whole point of spending $5000 dollars on brakes was to eliminate brake fade…. and they put DOT 4 brake fluid in it 🤪
the music was scary in this video🥺
D16z6 turbo for more power 🙌
K swap!!!
All these series are fun and all, but where is old stuff? Where is OG? The wheelhouse, B2B and Up to speed on cars? this is just I don't know. I feel like I can find these build everyewhere, it's not special
B20 swap
❤❤❤❤❤😊
Roll the fenders with hammers. That Honda needs to just die. I hated rice burners in highschool and entire adulthood.  Now 39 :(.
God that civic re.inds me if highschool after fast and furious hit. (class of 02) and these rice burners were screaming all over the roads with their entire 80hp. Lmao..  let's paint and put graphics on it and new rims and a loud exhaust. Now I is race car.
Y'all need a harbor freight ball joint separator. like $17 no hammers needed or just a lil tapparoo. That rear sounds like it's clearancing itself.
Drum brakes are much better for braking in city driving. The surface area is much more than disk pads. They are a HUGE pain to work on though. Drum brakes are NOT good for performance driving as they hold on to heat like a kid with candy.
I love these *not* money pit honda civic videos
Bring back Science Garage!! 100% bet it would bring more people.
You should make it AWD, either B- or K-series motor swap with some forced induction.
boltons?
money pit civic!!
Jobe is a Donut staple at this point
zach does a great job at teaching the audience
Do a K swap
Come to Brazil again soon
All that money and still riding on trash ass R888R’s. Smdh lol
Get a vtec from a  Honda Odyssey mini van!
kswap it!
anyone else notice the supercross game menu music playing in the background 😅
How the hell did the miata wheels make the civic look cheaper 😂
No shot that civic is 500
K swap the world!!!!!!!
Love this series
Next video, putting a 5k turbo in our 500$ civic
Still hoping to see more of that changli chinese truck 🛻 🙏
Could you guys do a b series all motor car? There is plenty of k series and boosted b series content on the YouTube’s lol.
Any car is project car when bought for 500
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Hector is gonna be running 3 Civics with Spoon calipers
Engine swap 😂
Bro please do the tyres next, This is a golden opportunity to do some proof of concept modification's here. I would love to see way's of getting more power and performance that does not involve just dropping a bigger block in it or strapping a bigger turbo on it etc. so aero, ECU tuning (maybe, big depends as you guys know) Ride height, even piston head whittling or block boring. It's like the things you kind of should do really if you are tuning enthusiast. so yeah be super selective on what type of parts you upgrade and how  cause it's is actually really interesting.
For those swapping drums for disks, drums are (comparatively) a pain to work on, heavier, and fade faster (worse heat dissipation).  However, disks need more fluid (change proportioning valve) because they are not as strong, and need more juice for equivalent stopping power.  This didn't seem to be well spelled out.  Drums are strong brakes.  Biggest issue - heat and weight.
So cool!. Just like I would do to my 95 Corolla. No it doesn't need these mods but Damn would it be fun!
Now I feels like I want to buy same civic and mock him a bit
Honest question,  can you put a supercharger on any engine?  Would LOVE to make my AWD CX-5 hit as close to 250-300 HRSPWRS as possible
Please check the rubber stopper pad for the brake light switch on the brake pedal. It should be rubber. DO NOT replace it with a bolt/nut, this will cause massive problems with your new fancy brakes, replace with the OEM part from Honda. If there is a nut/bolt in there replace it, that could be the cause of your rears acting up.
I think it would be cool if you kept the exterior stock to make the civic a sleeper car.
Needs a paint job/wrap and detail for sure, but its a cute lil throwback car for sure! haha
In my country THAT civic costs at least 2500 euros. That's honestly the most impressive thing
Kswap
Depending on how much power you're going to add, I imagine upgraded seats and seatbelts aren't far behind.
I always thought you are not supposed to brake hard on new pads and rotors for the first hundred miles or so
I have never bedded brakes in by stomping on them. Have I been doing it wrong?
It’s hammer time! -STOP!! 😂 you can’t touch this civic.
Will you swap the engine? 😊
turbo and cherry bomb exhust
Alternate title: Putting Integra Brakes on the $500 Civic
The fact that you guys can’t properly keep an engine in a Subaru! & then proceed to pretend it was engines fault and not you guys doing your research & making yourselfs look bad Pains me see you guys with a Honda Civic especially the eg hatch!  Don’t blame the engine when you keep beating on it when I bet it still has the OEM Honda Timing belt 💀 Clowns Fr
Finally!! I've been waiting a lot for a video of the 500$ Civic
Better? Longer? Well you have my attention Jobi Wan Kenobi
What's up with the spacer behind the rotor? Is that part of the brake kit or a method for installing a small spacer?
Is this money pite
Mazda ✅️ BMW ✅️ Honda ⏯️
Turbo?
put a k24 with  forged components and put a new radiator i prefer you  put spoon parts on it and get a new trans and diff and straight pipe it
Please Please Please have a B or K next episode.  Lets get this thing to its true Initial D potential!
Keep everything oem ORIGINAL and do a single cam vtec frank build turbo/supercharged!!!!
Extended lugs ?? The spacer under the rotor seems to shorten the lug .. just for piece of mind I guess .
7:49 feel the same way 😅… say no to hammers 😂
please supercharge it
jimmy looks like that one kid from haggard garage if he didn’t rip a box mod and no new england accent
2jz swap
Im sad theyre not turboing the D series but im still excited for the eventual K20 swap.
Bodywork please🙏
Call this series un-ricing
Where are you finding a hatch in good condition for $500… phony content
Turbo or supercharger
iTB!!!
Sleeper hectic na b12 build.  Vtec-yo
I do love the eg almost as much as i love my own ITR swapped Si :D.6 Put a b18c5 in it, stay period correct! Itll sound better than a k and be easier to install!
The 60-0 time on this thing is insane...
It actually looks phat with the enkis
Theres this one car (same car in the video) and its entirely made with spoon. its super cool to live nearby a few performance cars
"Oh, come to a red light! Better stop!" 😂😂😂
rocketbunny EG kit
eg 🙌
I think it could use a new loud exhaust but that’s just me… 😮
i have a 94 si and i love it so much. Its very slow but driving it is such an awesome experience. I'm so glad this new little series is on a car I own lol. I can't wait for the civic merch.
Bro I’ve been wanting another car and now I think I know what I want to play with
RPF1 looks good on any vehicle!
Just make this money pit guys :(
God damn, I love these Civic upgrade videos.
Lower control arm bushing look a lil Sus 😬
B SERIES!!
Ep3 oem rear calipers and rotor straight bolt on and are bigger then the ef eg ek dc brakes
Can’t tell you how many times you take something apart and put it back together the same way and it starts working.
Throw the absolute biggest turbo you can find and throw it on and hope the engine doesnt blow up🤩
I mean you have to do a k swap right?
So its an integra now, cintegra
The real question is can you guys change my breaks on my car lol
Bro you guys have a fender roller why were banging on it 😂😂
Hello! New to the channel and subscribed! Happy to see you infected by the jeep bug lol. Theyre a ton of fun. Also, Premium fuel gives no benefit on these engines. Excited to see whats next!
Just your Average honda build
I put gsr brakes all around and its fkn overkill this has to be so sensitive
Couldn’t help but notice the rear hatch shock swinging
Is this gonna ba a k swap?
I love this style of video and would love to see another money pit type series
This guy looks like he slams poon and gives ladies chlamydia, and i mean the nicest way.
4:37 "Not very good at braking." Technically, they're far superior at braking. Just not at very hot braking. Heavy trucks, forklifts, heavy machines still use them for a reason. (and wet brakes by heavy machines)
I kinda want to see sequential transmission on this thing
Dahora saber que com 500 dólares da pra comprar um Civic, no Brasil vc paga uns 7000 em sucata
First time seeing spacers behind a rotor
i wonder how they work in the cold
I love the civic too! Eg hatch foreverrrrr
Love my k20a2 EG   Keep this series up!!! I have the same car haha
K24/20 AWD swap.  Yall wasted so much on them wrxs. Lol
Is it okay for the brake disc to look that rusty??
In my country I can find that kind of civic like for 3,000 dollars
Throw a k24a2 in that bad boy
A $500 Civic? $5000 brakes? WTH?
we need more civic videos 💯🔥🔥
Do t upgrade your brakes, upgrade your tires 😉😉
theyre gonna k sawp
I love you guys… in a gay way ❤
MORE POWER
You better be putting a Spoon engine in there F&F style!
Gosh I envy those who don’t live in places that don’t use road salt. Removing that knuckle would of required a flamethrower and a chemical concoction of a ton of fluids to free the bolts
I’m surprised they just didn't go for the 5 lug conversion at that point
Get a buddy club lower ball joint.
All motor Gsr swap for the power. Everyone does turbo d and b series it’s gross.
I want to see weight reduction.
I’d love to see larger injectors, ITBs, performance cam, and a full exhaust. High revving NA build!
Where in the hell do you guys find these deals I would also have no problem dropping that kind of money if I found a hatchback that clean for 500 bones
Put a turbo in it
Boost that old single cam and see how much you can get out of tuning alone
@Donut I call bs. There is no way you found a running car for 500. Let alone a good condition running car for 500. Show the receipt or stop lying.
Can't wait for the "We put a K-Series in our $500 Civic"
no way they'll keep the d-series. too expensive to make decent power.  b-series swap with an e-bay turbo is the way to go for moderate power at a reasonable cost
👑H⏱NDA CIVIC HATCH EG👑
only a matter of time until we see a hector spoon engine joke in the comments
Fun fact, drums actually have more braking power then pads. The only issue is heat dissipation
I love it
Ebay turbo kit and build a k20 for it so when the d15 blows up you can swap it
Someone correct me if I’m wrong. The “ spoon “ brake pads looks like floating caliper Brake pads
K SWAP IT
Waste of time video
I still want a civic
That egg needs a k24 swap
May just be my imagination… but have they ever made a good use of the fender roller? Didn’t work on the Miata either 😂😂😂
Damn finally building a civic I love it 😂 let’s show these haters what’s up with Honda power
Why not go with slotted and cross drilled on front as well?
That's why i love donut so much, you're doing stupid shit as much as me! Love you , Guys!
I can't imagine trying to bed in breaks on the streets of LA😂
This is the coolest clapped out Honda 😊
Part of me wish you'd do a B swap just because, but at the same time why not a K? How about an AWD conversion? Looking foward!
Hi Low Up to Speed Bumper 2 Bumper Money Pit
How would you fit brake rotors with 4 holes onto a car which came from stock with 5? Say if you wanted to fit RS Watanabe 8-spokes, or something.
I paid a grand for my non driving rust bucket eg, I guess being a YouTuber helps
K20 swap for the Civic and the Miata?
the braking doesn't seem proportionate enough
feels like they shoulda just gotten an integra at this point
k swap 🫣
Sleeper car?
$5k for some autozone rotors and OE rear calipers and discs, but they found a $500 hatch. OK.
It's more important to stop than how fast you can go
Bro they are build ing laptop civic!?!!?
Where the spoon engines for race wars
Put Some unequal headers in that thing :)
next episode how about a 5 thousand dollar engine
No 🥄's  for rear
K-Series !
Wouldn't be a True Donut money pit series if you didn't go with a nice k24. less you wanted to make things interesting and show us how you do with installing a H22. What ever the team decides I know you guys wont disappoint.
6:45 drums require more juice to work. it takes about 200psi before the drums even move. good video tho
Por favorrrrrrr DO AN UP TO SPEED ON THE MAZDA MX3, MX6, AND FORD PROBE, NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT THESE FRIGGIN GEMS
PLEASE DO AN UP TO SPEED ON THE MAZDA MX3, MX6, AND FORD PROBE, NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT THESE FRIGGIN GEMS
PLEASE DO AN UP TO SPEED ON THE MAZDA MX3, MX6, AND FORD PROBE, NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT THESE FRIGGIN GEMS
Kswap better be a kswap
Why is/was that kid so upset about them banging on the fenders???
Love this build, it’s like watching a big car build 👍
$500 for $5mil in content.
Need to put the best possible tires on it to also help with your braking ability
Seiko SSK003, in case anyone is wondering about his watch
Ayee thats in Inglewood, my city i get my tires around a shop by there called tonys tires
I’m interested to know why they went with blank discs in the front and drilled/slotted in the rear. Usually it’s the other way around.
Bruh spacers behind the rotor what the actual fuck.
This dude looks like Moist Critical and LA Beast somehow had a son.
Rear brake hose is bad. That's why it's sticking on lol
500 to 5500 done !🤣
dont cheap out on brakes. those who do not even sure they maintain their ebrake
I'm trying to do this on my 2021 honda civic, but is time consuming and a lot of money lol
engine swap is with an LS
You guys should review whislingdesils monster truck thing is crazy
Build a k series for it
LS swap confirmed.
Finally, Money Pit is back!
What I want to see you do next is clean that bird poop off the side of the car.
high vs low civics?
cant wait for that k swap 😈
I think you should do seats, rims and tyres, weight reduction, exhaust, intake, cams etc and then do engine a bit more in-depth with fancy spoon parts (or even a swap? 👀)
peaple who came from FH5 like this comment
kswap
Lets start off…no hate… But drums brakes actually brake really well due to the large brake shoes surface area, there problems come down to there enclosed design where heat gets trapped in the drum and cannot dissipate as fast a sa rotor which is open to the air flow of the vehicle driving. Another con of drums is the complexity of them and how they only pivot from one point (the wheel cylinder) (unless they are duo servo). Very educational video as always anyway 🙂
How tf did you find a relatively clean civic for 500? Around here a rusted out shitbox that runs still sells for like 3k
honestly straight pipe it mine is straight pipped and sounds decent
I love how this is basically moneypit "lite" and im 10000% here for it
Its just a honda kid, no need cry over the hammering
It would be cool to port the engine, & super-charge it.
That right rear caliper problem is a bad brake line. When it's locked up and you pop the bleeder it releases that means the caliper is working. The brake line is not letting the fluid to go back throw to release the caliper.
Wth would you put stock rotors on the front. Vented and ported! 😂😂
Valvoline the official motor oil of donut
seems like your TIRES could be better.... ( sorry if you upgraded them already  )
Hey, Jobe. Are you lookin'? Hi! 😄 We're all watching this tuner miracle of a $500 Civic. Where did you find a functioning (not rolling shell) car in LA for $500?? I think that's the answer we're all looking for.
I’d love to work for donut. Not a wrencher, but every company could benefit greatly from a corporate health manager
Sound effects Guy, you're doing a fantastic job 🥳👍🏽
More power, uh, baby
honestly I would have spent a little bit more and just got a Civic WITH a title, but I guess it'll work great as just a track car.
Zach is awesome!
mooore!!!
Man, bleeding doubled sided calipers with pistons on all sides in every corner. Speaking from experience bleed brakes on set ups like this turn from simple to rocket science fr.
Kswap it pls❤
Hoping the next upgrade is tha Spoon engine with motec exhaust 😂
How are those breaks worth 5k? Lol
These civics are sold for 3k here in Middle East, where cars are cheap as f.. and where usually people buy luxury cars.
This is wicked love a old honda getting more money than the car is worth spent on them 😂
What lighting are you using in the wheel well? I’m always looking out for better lighting.
Properly setup drum brakes actually have more stopping area and better heat disbursement. They are also a hell of a lot faster and easier to change and much more reliable. There is significantly more surface area between the shoes and the drums.  ***OMFG OVER HEATING BRAKE PADS LEADS TO GLAZING WHICH LEADS TO SLIPPING WHICH LEADS TO YOUR BRAKES NOT WORKING CORRECTLY AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT DOES***  ZACH JOBE, YOU ARE NOT A MECHANIC and PLEASE STOP MISSING INFO OR HAVE A REAL MECHANIC EXPLAIN THIS, YOU"RE GOING TO GET PEOPLE HURT OR KILLED.
they deffinitly want to swap it
$500??? 😂 that’s a $5000+ civic
Sooooo you did all of that baller brake stuff and still used dot 3? Or am I trippin and that was dot 4?
Mo powa baby mo powa baby mo powa baby mo powa baby
Where r u finding cats for 500$ in Columbus Ohio there are no 500$ cars
Mo powa baby
Next video idea : from FWD ->RWD
K20 best for that little beast.
I reccomend a b20b swapping, its a massive hp and torque gain, its the cheapest out of the b series, with the right transmission it bests vtec motors ALL day
$500 Civic? Lucy you. Love that car the looks are 👌🏼
Pretty sure willwood are cheaper with same quality
He flat spotted his tires by the end of the video lol
Learning a lot from this Honda. Starting to be a looker now.
Please don’t be late i love that car
Cool, ready for the turbo and/or k20 video 👍
in indonesia, that civic worth 20k dollars bro.
Got a new Tacoma in 2020 and came with rear drums. They'll last longer, but don't stop for crap. Swapping to rear discs should be enough. Better brakes should be in the rear. Otherwise it's like stopping a bike using only the front brakes. You're gonna have a bad time.
Would be really excited to see a project of this civic please do more staff on this!
Gonna need that spoon engine, a t66 turbo with NOS, and a motec system exhaust
This money pit for sure
Install a rocket bunny kit on ittt!!!!
Don't let this video distract ypu from the fact that hector has acquired 5 spoon engines for a honda civic
Title should’ve been “How to make your civic slower” 😂
Sort of hoping they don't just throw a K20 in it and call it a day for power. I think it would be cool for them to extract as much power as they can from the little D series and then once they've hit a limit they throw in a B, H, or F series.
please install on the honda a really big spoiler😂😮
TURBO! TURBO! TURBO!
I'd love to see a video about cars with 2 separate fuel tanks and why it was discontinued.
K24 time
If they are throwing this much money at this build i wonder if a 4wd conversion is on the cards
Do a H2b I have a h22 from a type sh runs great just smokes when hitting Vtec u can have it I’m in florida
this is the content i subscribed for, cant wait to see a turbo d16z6 destroy a canyon road
You didnt take it back down the mountain a few times to see the difference in the brakes??
LS swap
Break fade on curvy mountain roads esp on descending ones made my guts churn and my heart jump into my throat, after the shakes and palm sweat. EBC has a break in compound which works fantastically
As much money as Dontus spends modding cars, I kinda wish they would give Zach enough money to build his RB25 s14! That car is sick and would be awesome content for the channel 😅
K swap it
Why not just do a money pit Civic?
5k brakes? Could have absolutely went cheaper lol. But ay yall are rich apparently , also throw the motor from the Integra you showed on screen into this hatchy the b18b1 goes pretty good and it's a tank it handles a beating
B swap for next 🙏
I dig Donut. I really enjoy it. Only thing I've really been watching lately. My t.v watching has taken a hit because of this channel. Keep it up boys and girls. It'd be really cool if ya'll did what you do to a 2005 F-150 5.4 Triton that you do to these cars. You know engine, suspension, brakes, supercharge, turbo, headers, inner coolers, throttle body, cold air intake, lower it, and ect. It'd be different than the car work. It'd just be fun to see I think.
If you gentlemen ever do an EV conversion you should do a crossover with the brilliant young lady - Frances Pearl Farnam @ her channel "Tinker-geneering"!
LS swap? lol
B18c type r swapp
Definitely a flash tune
HEY ZACK!!! you guys should definitely do the auto/manual swap on this sucker, it would be a great opportunity to show everyone how it’s done plus I don’t think there are too many DIY videos on that procedure! Look forward to seeing it! Thanks guys! 🙏 oh Awesome work as always!! ❤
👍 love the new series
it's an amazing things to see my dream car little by little becoming more and more slick and cool.. i wish i can get my own EG some day
please throw a traction bar & a new front torque mount with a poly bushing.  That will help stiffen the front end, and really help the civic from nose diving under heavy braking
Nice brakes but why not put a top tier brake fluid in like amsoil or motul which have dot 5 level boiling points?
Lovin' this build.  It's like, hope for the average Joe!  If you can tune up a POS like this...any car can be tuned.
If you spend 5000 on brakes..you need a mental check up or you work for N.A.S.A
Wheel spacer before the brake disc?
Use this as a "Jobe is the most handsome man" button
Gives me real Gran Turismo starter car vibes 👍
Damn that’s things clean
More likely the turbocharger
For the last time, this was not $500 in LA.
I went from single piston calipers to a 4 piston brembo brake setup of a TLS.  Best thing I’ve done.  Saved me so many times to ngl lol
Money pit on the eg? Please!
If they make this into money pit series I’m here for it bro I have missed this
Would you experiment on the engine?
I hope they keep up with car and not let it fade out like the others(understandably with content creation) I just really wanna see this car get nasty for no reason lmao
Turbo it guys
Please, make more videos on this car
Donut vs me who finishes the eg first. 0-1
What was the fate of the turbo Miata?  Stopped watching after that.
next , put 6000 dollars turbo in it😏👍
Turbo F20C swap
this is the ONLY CAR that cost less than its modifications😭
Engine swap it, k24 engines cost around $900 to $1200
are those rpf1s 15x8? and what tire size are those? thanks donut!
This is! Money pit. But expensive
Didn’t realize spoon was still around. Brian would be freaking out right now. If he were still with us (RIP)
Does seem like the ABS isn’t working… did this car even have ABS
K24??  Love your guy’s stuff
This car needs to be in your Forza Horizon 5 part 2 add on!!!
Next step turbo and a v-tec
Can't wait this thing to be Rocket bunny'ed
Tires is what is stopping the car. You said it yourself, the stock brakes can lockup the tires, so they brake hard enough. Fade is something that can be addressed with ducting, which will cost a fraction of a big brake kit.
Put some anime girls on the side for Nolan
B series swap. Maybe stock b20 then add vtec head
Plzzzzzz keep modifying this car
After powerplant maybe a jdm interior?!
compound turbski setup on a 2j swap? i havent heard the word "budget" yet soooooooo GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT
I say keep it a poor man's civic and do your common intake and exhaust system and maybe a 75 wet shot with a tune to show how fun these civics can be for a low price!
What’s the spec on that wheel/tyre setup?
This feels like an armpit and I'm all here for it
Crazy how some wheels and tires change the whole look
Ey Zach, Seiko GMT?
I wanna see a hybrid upgrade!
Obviously a K swap next time.
B18c type r swap
These was my first car I had everything but the hatch tho i always wanted one love it
Brakes and good coilovers realllly have a way of making a 100hp civic into something you can scare all your friends in 😂
Doing money pit without calling it money pit lol
Put $6000 engine in $500 civic
Next, full interior mod
I bet you’s are going to B swap. B18C
Even guys with spoon brakes say don't buy spoon brakes just for show
When are you gonna do hilow dragsters
Do they actually pay the retail prices for this stuff???
yo the civic is absolutely sick with those wheels
SOHC TURBO please 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
carbon fiber body panels
Not only a sick money pit choice. But something I can follow along too 👏
This is what I love about 90s Hondas, everything is interchangeable. You should drop a b18 in it and start adding power to that. Those hatches have so much potential.
You sure that thing even has ABS?
So that K series you guys rebuilt is going in the civic right?
Dude that eg hatch is sick, it’s coming along really good. For power hmmm maybe k24 swap, I would love to own that beauty of a car
Zack is going to be running 3 Honda Civics with spoon brakes. And on top of that, he just went into Harry's, and he ordered 3 T66 turbos, with NOS. And a Motec exhaust.
WILL YALL PLEASE DO A PRELUDE
You should have done a before and after stopping distance.
HUGE potential for this series!!!! Amazing car choice with the goat host jobe
K swap time baby
I cant wait for the motor up grades. I have a civic and now I know what I want to do with it.
I can't wait till this $500 Honda becomes a $50,000 Honda.
Do another hi and lo car
Send me your unwanted parts 😅
You seriously need to have a talk with Dave Ramsey.
I call BS on the EG for $500. I love yalls content, and i am not a kevin. But i think everyone knows the value of those cars nowadays. Im in Alabama, and that would be a $3k car at least here.
Make sure to put a kill switch on that thing those things get stolen faster than Paris Hilton can get STDs
They should do a maintenance comparison from a rust zone car vs a southern car
K24a2 swap now please hybrid racing parts
I Just Got Hired From Jiffy Lube. And I’m very happy That I’m finally Get to Work under the hood of the cars. Checking the fluids and everything.
Brakes costing more than the car is crazy...
i needed this information and you post it a day after my report on braking systems for schooling, love the timing
Buy an ek hatch as well and compare them
Ads are getting out of control on Donut channel now
Would love to see a k20 in it but a b18 is great too
Could use the 2000 crv front brake grade
I've had shaking under light brake pressure since I upgraded the pads and rotors. After watching this video, I went and (safely) stomped on the brakes several times, turns out they weren't bedded in. Thanks Donut!
That's it, lottery build on my old Avalon is happening.
I’ll believe it when I see the bill of sale
I wish that was a 500$ civic
My dad has an '86 Honda VFR700 and it came with Nissin calipers. 👌🏼
I keep forgetting that donut takes place in my hometown so I was just shocked when I saw the background
Can I please get this hatchie when your done 😢 miss mine so much
they are gonna say its a filter, but damn them eyes are mesmerizing! 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫 i thought mine were blue but i have nothing on you sir!
MO POWA BABY
We need some sick wheels and tires next. And a new paint job.
Man I have a 8th gen civic under 100k miles & i blew my motor due to hydro locked a couple weeks ago :/
Plus all disk's are missing the little retaining screws they came with from factory 😒
Spacer behind the brake disk....... WHY?????!!!!!!! 😵😵😵😵😵
Thank you
Why???
Bring on the K20-A baby!!!!!
We call it the civteg6ra
Drum brakes actually create more braking force but can not dissipate the heat as well!
I feel like a series upgrading this car would be sick! Upgrades like new wheels, new paint, CarPlay, new interior, new engine/motor, etc. plssssss make it happen
kswap 😅
Diesel swap
Met Zach this week. Great representation for Donut!
kinda makes me wonder how shingo held up with takumi and vice versa..
I`m commited to the series, but this aint the way we bed the brakes in the UK as most of the OEM or OEM replacemnet  brakes are painted
just call it money pit please oh please
Eg6 civics as the New HiLow cars right now...I SAID RIGHT NOW!!😁
D16 turbo please
K20 with k24 head and a turbo, that's what I wanna see
Donut try not to use RPF1’s CHALLENGE! (HARD)
When you said drum brakes don't work too well, I disagree. They work just fine and actually potentially work better since you can have a lot more surface area rubbing at once. Their main problem is they're a lot more susceptible to brake fade than disc brakes. Their main advantage is that they're cheaper than disc brakes, so to help cut costs manufacturers would and/or still put them on the back and disc brakes on the front. It helps keep the cost down and you still for the most-part get the same amount of braking power in conventional setups.
i wish to see japanese super aero installed
No way this Honda way bought after COVID. I can't find a rust bucket for less than 2500 😐
No way thats a $500 civic. Put the old breaks on and sell it to me.
Do Intake, headers, out to new exhaust set up
I need a new civic vid NOW
I feel like there's a K swap in this car's future. With that on the docket, though, I think it needs a few more style points to get it to 100% - Maybe a duckbill spoiler and a CF hood
CAM next
Next: 50k dollar restauration
When you replace the break master do you need to bleed it or just the breaks and your good?
Turbo B series for sure
Been loving this
No mention of an alignment after all of that front end work. That should be the first trip after it is all back together for those of you who know little about cars.
Nice Seiko SKX, Jobe
I hope the 5 grand was ALL the parts for the rear, the new master cylinder and proportioning valve and all the rotors pads and spoon calipers. Still seems really expensive.  My cousin did his brake upgrade on his old 93 Civic for under $2000.
K 20 swap
Its a shame everyone goes with tiny uncomfortable civics(shopping cart/chic cars built for small jap women)   vs more comfy accords....altima vs maxima  /// corrola vs camary.......crampt death traps vs comfort.....idk...smh........5-11+ guys stuffed in these.......always made me laff.....same guys with tiny 3series bmw,s built for women vs 5,7 series  built for men.....those guys always look ridiculous getting in and out of one of these toys/tiny chic cars......hit a shopping cart = death,pickup truck atomized,no chance.....laff...just add more power if worried about wieght...idk..
This just reminds me how I take the stock equipment on my Integra for granted.
Everyone does kswap. Do an SI engine with turbo
You guys should just throw a new head on it, big valves, port & polish and new cams w/adjustable gears. Put it all back together with the stock intake/exhaust manifolds. Stock air box and stockish exhaust. See what it would make powerwise while breathing through all the oem crap
I love civic video
Getting that civic ready for a beefy K swap I see!! Lol 😜
Why you upgrade HiCar without LowCar...
The fact that they're putting a $5000 break system means, they're probably gonna put a high HP engine....1000hp K20 maybe?
Your issues with the rear brakes sticking could be the residual pressure valve, as drum brakes need residual pressure in them to activate easier, when u change them to disc brakes the disc brakes can stick (depending on how well the residual pressure valve works) disc brakes don’t need any residual pressure unlike drums, id recommend taking that out, sometimes they build it into the proportioning valve system, and I could be wrong as I don’t know much about civics but just a thought as to why that was happening to you guys
Shouldn't those back rotors be on the front??
The Animations are geting worchs and worchs. The part abaut beding in brakes is total bullshit
swap!! engine swap
WE NEED MORE DONUT IN FORZA!!!!
... my man explains all the easy stuff but skips over explaining brake bleeding. WACK
Lets get some MO POWA BEHBEE
This is could be a perfect project for hi low season.
K series supercharged!!
hola disculpen el perfil tan falso, pero no lo es, quiero tener nuevas experiencias por lo cual quiero ir a trabajar y vivir allá, tendran algun trabajo disponible para mi? el que sea, limpiar los autos o los sitios, lo que sea, soy Tec mecanico, pero haré lo que sea, espero que respondan de todas maneras, gracias!
No Civic on the planet IF it runs is worth ONLY $500 right now. LMAO!
My brakes prefer Dr. Seuss Green Eggs and Ham at bed time. Next morning they are good to go!
Drums are so bad at breaking they use them to stop 50 ton semi trucks.🤔
Turbo on stock internal and when the engine blow an engi e swap😬
I would like to see something where you use the same car's comparing turbo's and superchargers. Maybe some time trials between the two. Just a thought 🤷
Dont let that distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running 3 Honda Civics with $5000 spoon breaks. And on top of that, he just went into Harry's, and he ordered 3 T66 turbos, with NOS. And a Motec exhaust
K swap babyyyyy
Bleeders on the back ⏬
I hope they end up building a badass turbo B series or swapping a K series in and leaving the body look completely stock lmao.
I miss moneypit and i love that theyre doing it with a civic
drilled and slotted in the rear but solid in the front, why? Makes no sense as the front brakes handle majority of the braking therefore get hotter and need the heat dissipation more than the rear
Intake, cams, cam gear, cam gear cover,
I like the look of the civic already but please dont put those little ugly fenders like the Miata has on the civic
Maybe Mini-me swap next? :)
Zach is easily my favorite. I feel like I actually learn stuff here vs. Just seeing cool things
I would've liked to see you replace the trailing arm bushings - with a lowered suspension the old bushing will be clocked wrong and tear through pretty quickly. A popular thing is to just replace it with a center pivot bushing that way it doesn't have to be clocked perfectly whenever the ride height is adjusted. Otherwise fantastic upgrade and awesome video.
these are like 1800 new, title is misleading come on guys
Next try placing a brain in your head.
Personally.....H2B swap it with GS-R transmission. Yeeee!! But you guys will most likely GS-R swap it witch is dope and good enough too!!
I clicked to see if you meant what I thought you meant and you did. Now all I can ask is why?😂
K-twizzle!
Mo power baby
Finally 1month waiting for part 2
Pleaseeee make this money pit 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
IS NOBODY GOING TO MENTION THE SPACER BEHIND THE DISC/ROTOR 😳  IS THIS A THING? LIKE IF IT IS I'VE BEEN DOING SPACERS WRONG ALL ALONG 😂
16 years I drove one of those, never 1 single problem.  Now I am driving a younger version of the Civic. I havent had any car problems for about 21 years.
I always thought it was called embedding the brake pads not bedding. I guess I was wrong.
Actually fals information the proportsion thing (idk how its called,we say regulator) its to reduce ,or better say regulate rear break power when having disc so your car doesn't lock the rear wheels   actually really dangarous thing that led in many cars crashed because people think you need uphrading rear breaks you really good up to 300hrsprs with standard rear brakes it only breaks 20-30% max
I tried "bedding" my brakes,  they were smoking after several runs midday...   😅
Wish I could find a runing civic for 500$
Pointless test after swapping the wheels and tires
You have to slap a spinny boosty boi on it 👀
I’m way too excited for this car
J series swap when 👀
K swaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap!! 😅😂
When your brake is worth more than your car
K swapping it bet ya
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running three Honda civics with spoon engines.
Not worth it.😂 civic are lightweight, just upgrade the pads.
Man! love this civic series!
How is the $5000 broken down? Mostly Honda parts. I was expecting multi piston brakes all round with multi piece brake discs
Or f20b be nice too
whats the shim you put behind the Rotors @ 2:25?
Time for a spinny spooly boi, what you think i was gonna say?
Next is k swap
Just traumatizing jimmy
Bswap
K Swap
Exhaust, headers, and intake
Bro this EG Civic worth $2k-3k in our country
I have a 88 Civic Hatch, already have the suspension done but after watching this I see I will definitely need to change over to a full rotor setup. Then after that like you said, Mo Powah! Can't wait to see what you guys do with this gem
Waiting for that Kswap to go in
K swap duh 🙄
More of this 🙏
Love this content, CONTINUE THE HONDA UPGRADES
My brain tingled when Zach said "give this thing a little mo powa baby"
K24 swap?
No such thing as a $500 eg hatch in 2023 stop the cap
I'd love to see you swap a d16y8 from a 96-2000 civic ex. The VTEC motor would give you a bit more power and be fun in the light little hatch. Do it Jobe ❤ 👀
we need some huge spinny boi on that civic
Why do they still sell drilled rotors?
That hatch is gonna be nasty
This is cool  Keeping a car alive is pretty nice
Just bring back upto speed pleeeeeease
I had to sell my civic earlier this year and this series makes me miss  it a whole lot. Can't wait to see more!
He must be related to caleb pressley from barstool
Arms would be cool painted
I feel like he forgot the retaining springs on the front brakes.
I love Zac so much wish him the best.
Please do some safety!!!!
Good to see Jo-B recovered from the ickness and back in the shop💪💪🤘
why 2 different rotor types- wouldnt it have been most beneficial use either vented  all around or similar solid rotor as the front in the rear as drilled often crack after heat cycling and cant or often are not easily turned.
They need to swap that k20 into the civic then throw on a turbo, exhaust and a body kit
do all wheel drive civic plsss
money pit miata vs $500 civic?
Why didnt you replace the hub aseembly to a 5 stud assembly?!?!?
V8🤞
Whoops now you have a front left brake bias.
I want to see you guys do the baseball bat trick to fender roll one time.
FINALLY A CIVIC, VTEC BABY BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
My initial reaction, "Why would you do this" then I see the channel name, to be expected. I love it.
you shouldnt bed the brakes like this you are gouging when you do this you should just brake normally
Keep this type of content flowing!!
Would love to see a (high/low) of some sports bikes
An ESI with a K20 engine rather than a B16 for a unique look
please zack tell me your putting a turbo h22 in that thing. also this is the content we've been waiting for man! love this series!!!
Yeah gonna call BS on $500 civic that is that clean. Even if it was just a rolling shell.
K-swap!!!! 😁😁😁
this civic is already sweet and itll be sickkkk when you guys are done! Such great taste in your mods. Keep up the good work guys! Legit the only chanel i watch <3
I always liked the trusty baseball bat method for rolling fenders
It's amazing how nice tires can make a regular car look so much better. A little bit of soft rubber sticking out the side of the fender is 👌🏼
My boys dropping $5k on brakes, but reuse wheels Lmao love it
I can’t like this video enough ❤❤❤
Man being from the rust belt, this looks like a dream to work on
Eg looking real good! 😍
I dont have 500 so Hey guys today im using 20 dollars tires for 2 dollar hotwheels
The hammering 🫣
Turbo
B18C3 GSR is legal for registration. Also K20 by TSX too. Only 415 lbs. Great with weight balance.
Have you notice non of those modified car last more than 3 years at road!
Like using a car wash to do the dishes lollll I'm here for it.
Me: What kind of brakes for a Honda Civic would cost $5,000?  0:48  Me: Ahhh got it...
Drum brakes are perfectly adequate for street driving. They work well and last a long time. And they aren't hard to change if you take your time. The problem is, they get hot when used a lot. So if you're doing a lot of hard braking, upgrading to discs is a good idea. But if you never go on a track, or don't commonly drive a lot of curvy mountain roads. Factory drum brakes are just fine.  If you're drag racing. Drums are lighter and they will stop you just fine. Even 4 wheel drums are good for drag cars. 4 wheel drums are also okay for street cars. But upgrading the front to discs definitely has it's benefits in certain driving conditions
No hub centric for the rotors and a cheap @ss wheel spacer behind it? Not even Tik Tok could recommend.
MORE VIDS OF THIS CIVIC PLS I LOVE THIS SERIES
Next we’re gonna put on a 5000 dollars paintjob and some body work to
11:08 "WHAT A MACHINE!!" -Jeremy Clarkson everybody.
Ways to tell if someone is from Ohio, have them say spoon. 😂😂😂
Should have put a slotted and drilled rotor on the front to begin with.
The fender roller isn't too tall. You're just too fucking lazy to do the extra work extending the coils because it's not your car
This series popped out just at a great time in my life. I too have bought my self a Honda Civic, but its one of those FN4 models so you guys probably think its a girlish car, but you guys love miatas so i trust to tell you boys :)
What's the song at 08:38 ?
where can I find a $500 civic that is still running?
Money pit or not it makes more sense than a $5000 sound system in a $500 car
Mo powah bahbeh!!!
You are the Spoon brake caliper, Neo.
do all the bushings trailer arm  bushing, motor mount,  tie rods also  they are all bolt on
Do Hondas with rear drum and front disk have a proportioning valve? Did you guys switch to a block valve when he switched to rear disc?
paint it spoon yellow
What we waiting
Put some motor mounts in it
Would you consider making a youtube playlist for the current and future civic videos?
Nice 👍👍
Turbo?
As someone who owns a slow, cheap civic, these vids are perfect. Gives me motivation to modify mine !
Gotta try the phone book trick to help roll the fender see what you think, helped me save a few banged up fender jobs
Did they forget the spring that resets the pressure for the pads when you come off the pedal?
$500 civic with $30,000 of parts???? I’m so ready for this
Please put a crazy wrap on this junk car lol
I wanna know where you found a Civic for $500!!! I haven't seen a Civic that cheap since I got my 1984 Civic hatchback for $500 over 20 years ago If you get tired of the Civic, you can donate it to me😊. I don't know how I would get from Southern Ohio to pick it up. But I'll gladly find a way 😅
Yall gonna do the k swap I know it or turbo it and blow the stock motor then swap it
I can't wait for the LS swap
K24 swap incoming
Let me get that scrap metal! Hahahahaha
Yall should call this series death trap
That is not how you “seat” brakes. Donut is so cringe when it comes to their mechanical car knowledge 😂
Suggestion - a channel donut channel for newbies and one for enthusiasts. I enjoy you playing with crazy updates until you explain stuff I learned when I was 10
The RPF1 looks awesome on the Civic
Engine swap
Drums have more frictional stopping power. Rotors are better at heat dissipation
Please give this monster a bigass single turbo sticking out of the hood or lights
Who the hell is editing this   It's so bad 😂
Supercharge it
I love this new Civic  series :D
I would love to see how much just brakes effects lap times
Barra swap.
More power baby!
What happened to the Miata ???? You can’t keep getting away with jt
Pressure bleeder, best £40 I spent to bleed clutches after replacement. You can do it all by yourself and don't need to borrow someone to sit in the car.
K swap it
Wtf? Spacers behind the brake disc? 🤔🙄🙈
Loving this series but I would love to see some stats on how much the upgrades do like testing the braking distance before and after.
The hyundai tiburon and XG350 share the same front knuckles, but have larger calipers on the XG. So I took the two piston calipers and 12" rotors from an XG, slapped em on, and boom instant stopping power upgrade. Next will be 4 piston if I can find a company that still makes em
Jswap the civic 🫶🏽
Turbo
Spacer behind the rotor means that someone didn't design the system properly.
Better brakes does not shorten the brake stream so much, then wider tires do. Why you get bigger and better brakes is too keep them longer without losing power or of fatigue... when running long hours on example a track. Consequently wider tires you have, the bigger roller resistance = shorter braking distance.  And one's standard brakes run out ... so must be factory defects on them for them is thoroughly tested by the manufacturer of the vehicle's horsepower etc. And this is a big problem among young people who just sit and say, I will trim my car from 150hp to 300-400hp, and then the car owner cannot stop on the car itself because the original brakes cannot cope with the large increase in new horsepower. Nuts
Real ones know this is a re upload
Lol so spoon in the front power stop in the rear, not bashinng just saying I run power stop on my cars absolutely love em ❤
I just bought a project 1k EG Cx hatch
they should of just bought an integra
I’m hoping for a period-correct swap like a B18, but I’m guessing it gets a K-swap.
BABE, DONUT MEDIA UPLOADED ZACH CONTENT
kswap dat baby !!!!
happy to see zack again😎 and I love the civic! new engine please! (or a build maybe)
Let's get Moah Powah Babeh!!
try to put on some expensive air intake and exhaust set up in that car
You should do an Amazon or eBay car, where all of the parts are purchased from the sight. See how good of a car you can make
Compare stopping power to crappy tires and good tires
Love this series keep it up
Do a K20 swap
This series brings me right back to high school. A few buddies had Civic SI's and I had an Integra RS
I feel like they just mayyyyyybe leading up to a full Spoon engine swap and this is the unannounced Money Pit👌🏼
I love how you explain things so well, feel like I’m actually learning something about cars
It's time for an engine swap
KSWAP THE WORLD
In other country people willing to buy egs for 10-15k usd
Forget the haters I'm a apprentice mechanic and loving it. Its funny how when your knowledge grows you understand more keep up the awesome work
Next, K or B swap
just go ahead and start with a k-swap, anything else you'll just end up redoing when you eventually do anyway
😂 Turbo Time
That thing is gona break Yesterday!!
Mini me swap it, dont do a k or b
I love that the first mods are for putting the power to ground properly. I would love to see some proper wheels and leave these to the poor miata. Next step engine swap 🔥
i hope it gets a supercharger
All 20 year old cars need Brembos.
Nah fr
I’m with Jimmy. Zack be like “doesn’t fit? We’ll just pound it!”😂Donut style!
Great channel! Apologies in advance for the noob question, but since the back has been converted to disc brakes, any reason why those brake calipers aren't also from Spoon?
B18
I heard that putting fake hood and fender vents simulate an additional 30 horsepower per add-on. Please add some stick-on vents to test, thanks.
Engine bay livery/paint or clean up
you guys should make an electric drag car
Waiting for the k swap episode
I would love to see a hi low with s2000
MONEY PITTTTT! as car people, we know theyre money pits! But give it to us!  We need money pit!
Comment thrown
I love when they spend heaps of money on shit boxes
FK8 motor!!!
Spoon brakes just look 👌
Put a 5k turbo now
You know what this Civic needs? A Cummins Diesel Swap! The a crossover video of the Smokestang vs the SmokeTEC
Brake fluid and no gloves 😳
It's k20 on it
waiting for the K20 engine swap in the future episode and ready for SEMA😅😅
Please don't give it more power. If I've learnt anything from doughnut Media it's that everyone would be much happier with a project cars if they left the powertrain stock. How refreshing would it be to have a fantastic handling Canyon car that didn't blow up
Funny Nisin brakes are low endish in the bike world
No anti rattle clip?
Please never use a hammer on it again I’m not a civic guy but a lot better ways to do it like a price of steel tube and tyre so many dents not kills my ocd aha
I call bs on 500 civic unless it’s completely trash
Hi guys, are you guys sure that discs need more fluid than drums? Normally when you swap the drums for disc and do nothing you found the disks getting blocked, this would mean that they need less fluid than drums?
More eps.
They've put spoon brakes on, are they gonna hit up Hector and get a Spoon engine?
Waiting for the turbo kit
Manual transmission and a yoke
Supercharger?
Put in that k20 that u n Jeremiah tear down n rebuild
the first channel to add better brakes before more power :D
As a hot hatch enthusiast this is exciting. Hoping this becomes a series, tuning the EG 😍😍😍
Lol looks like ya shouldve just started on a integra… better platform
VTEC BABY
No before and after?? Lame. I wanted a test.
Drive and left foot brake :D
Helped do a swap like this on a b14 200sx. Worked really nice
The reason people love honda's so much and i've built a few myself is that so many parts from different honda's fit and its so easy to work on and make so sticky on the road and a lot of fun.
So Hector was actually running 3 Civic with spoon Brakes?
K20 swap next time put that breaks to some use
Throtl > Donut media
K swap this beauty for more power
Seriously, like i said in the last video.. id absolutely buy a $500 civic just to get the suspension and brakes to out in a better same year/chassis civic and brag how much i saved on those parts lmfao
Tune your Civic up to 300bhp
is this an unofficial money pit?
I wanna see yyou guys do a clutch job on that Civic! I am still pretty clueless as to how a transaxle works
100% a turbo on for more power
How come you guys fitted drilled, grooved and ventilated rotors to the rear but the fronts are standard OEM ventilated? Wouldn't grooved/drilled front discs help with heat dissipation, especially since the fronts do most of the work?
THISSSSSSS
How much is an Integra?
the brakes may be $5000 but you'll get much more than that from all the insurance claims when other drivers rear end you
K24 swap.... please please please please 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
could you put a pandem body kit, would look insanee
2jz whod be fire aint gone lie make dat happen
please clean the civic :( *Edit:* lol, at this stage, this is most expensive $500 civic in history— should get a guiness world record prize 🤣
500 for that civic? i one 3, where i can get that for 500?
i learned about break bedding
Put 500$ brakes into Bugatti 😊
HONDA!!!
I'm hoping they do a full exhaust system swap with ITBs. That's my guess for the power mods
Bro You guys should put a big HONKIN TURBO ON HERE TO REALLY MAKE IT A SPOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I would like to see you actually roll the fenders next time please 🤣😭😭😭😭😭😭
K swap?!?!?!?!?
Seems like a bad business plan.
I want to see the donut trackday. take all your projectcars on the track at the same time and have at it
Yeah 500$ for that civic hatch coupe is ez 4-5 k running stock like I might actually kms to try and get a better timeline where cars aren’t taxed everywhere
LS Swap
k20 turbo build...
When do you put a precision 64/66 on it with a laptop beside driver seat? Its a clapped out civic!
Not very good at breaking? Drum brakes are actually very good breaks, usually better than disk brakes with the same diameter. On top of all that, they last longer. But yes, they are very annoying to work on. But it's a Honda Civic. Just throw it away. They're disposable cars.
5k. I'd spend half on diet coke, buy a Honda ricer with 5k of mods  still have enough left for gas maccas  and at least a couple of beaches.
Better brake lines doesnt just give you more feel, thats often where most perceived brake fade comes from.
Headlights/tail lights
I'd argue you can add better wheels and tyres on it, some vented disks and you'll probably get better stopping power than the current upgrade.
I like these famous youtube assholes that get a deal on a car because they're famous. Now all of a sudden I got to pay 3k for their 500 dollar car. With the check engine light on....
Engine swap or a turbo? 👀
K series swap??🤷🏻‍♂️
Port it🐵
Jobe, is that a blue dial 5 GMT? Matches the calipers. Noice.
who asked
With that sticky caliper I would be tempted to just completely remove the bleeder valve and pump some fluid through then replace the bleeder
No twisty drive?
Put a V8 in it 😂
I love this consept. Car coming along nicely
Ls swap or turbo?
Nice hair
When he said throw up.. i threw up bout 30 seconds after
Might be a silly question, but when you replace the drums with discs, how do you connect the e-brake?
Do a crx!!
Cold air or exhaust
Would of been a fun high vs low!
OH STOP IT!😂
I love how interchangable Integra parts of the era were with the Civic. It makes for some great upgrades.
My neighbor traded a $100,000 Mercedes for a full blown 4 second drag civic of this model
Can y’all make a video breaking down how the position of the caliper affects the car feel, or purpose or however?
Anyone  else cringe when they saw how they were beding brakes in ?😬🤣
oh my god they are K swapping it
If disk brakes I’ll be so upset
kk
Dos poon brakes 😎
Cummins swapped civic?
Why is the rear break drilled and the front just smooth?
Nice Seiko 5 Zach ;)
Is anyone else fixated on how unreal Jobe's hair is!?!?  Donut really should give him a raise before he smartens up and takes off in the modeling/haircare field.
put an inline 6 in the back😍😍
With spoon brakes next thing you need is a spoon engine :D
Bad practice putting grease on back of yours pads
Electric supercharger!!!🤌
@7:11 that sick ass beat tho
I can see one problem with this. You now need a $ 50 000 motor.
$5k calipers on stock rotors 🫠🫠🫠
That's not a 500$ car lmfaoo
The moment when they realise that they've just finished building a Honda Integra.
Why no brake shims?
Can you wrap it ?
For all you DIY mechanics this tool at 1:41 can brake you ball joint rubber cover, so use right tool if want to keep it intact
throw that turbos babyyyy
Thank you for the surprise money pit video🤌🏿🤌🏿 There's a reason it's trending
One BIG turbo boy
This build is my new favorite series right now. Stuff my friends and I did back in the day just updated and having more money. LoL
I’m surprised you guys don’t have a Netflix show you should look into it your content already is way better then Netflix shows that cost millions
twin turbo
How can i get this eg hatch when y’all don’t want it anymore ???  Looking forward in a eg build  I’m in San Diego
But Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running three Honda civics with spoon engines, and on top of that, he just went into Harry’s and bought three t66 turbos with nos, and a motec exhaust system.
Admit it, this is just your excuse to build the best Honda you never could 20 years ago.
Looking forward to seeing a nice dohc vtec in-between them front wheels
How is it not a moneypit video
If y’all could ever find it, I’d love to see you guys work on a 1992 infinity m30 or Nissan leopard. Both are the same car
I wish I had money, time, and a lift 😢
Now put some expensive wheels and tire
I'm rarely disappointed in Donut or Zach.  This is one of those times.  When Zach said that drums weren't very good at braking, that is patently false.  For a given diameter, a drum brake is superior to a disk brake for braking.  For instance, a 14 inch drum has nearly twice the braking surface that a 14 inch disk has.  This is because it is using the circumference of the brake, or, the furthest part, so the largest part.  In addition, the brake shoes inside the drum have a larger contact area than the caliper on the outside.  Larger braking surface, and larger pad surface equals better braking.  What drum brakes are very, very bad at is shedding heat.  They also are worse than disk at drying themselves when wet, but it's the heat build up that is the bigger problem.  However, drums do provide better braking than disc always... once or twice...
Hope you guys put a supercharger in it or S2000 maybe Integra engine. Hope not opting in with Turbo, way too easy task for you guys 😳😳
finally BEEN WAITING
That hatch 5000+ in todays prices
Found it funny that it locked up a wheel in front of "Ben's Tires & Brakes" 😂
When the hammer came out to fold the inner lip, all I thought was “why didn’t they just jack up the rear control arm” 😂😂 Can’t say I haven’t done the same though lol
That K20A might go in this huh?
This is mighty car mods on steroids!
The brakes also cost more than a 2005 toyota corolla
as someone who only ever works on bikes(pedal, not motor), is touching the rotors and pads not bad for car brakes?
$500 civic? Where???
Most people: Boats are a money pit. Donut: Hold my Honda.
Miata rims in a Civic, sharp!
Love the civ got the dx
turbo!!!!!!!!!'
😂❤
Giving it 6 more episodes until something really bad happens to the Motor or it blows up
Can we all agree..donut is about to build a gnarly eg hatch..
K20 swap
Curious where the 5000 came from. Those calipers are only 1500 and the rest of the parts are maybe 1k at the very most.
Sheesh Jobe one upped me with spoon calipers 🤤. Anxiously waiting for the next video to see what you have in store for the engine.
I just realised spoon backwards is noods 10:36
I'm ase certified in brakes, in regards to your locked up wheel. It was most likely the pins not having enough lube on them or the piston seal in the caliper had a dry spot. It's also important to give the rotors a moment to cool off before going into the second and third burnishing, aka bedding. Seat belt is a good idea too. I usually would get up to 60 make sure nobody is behind me, brace, dynamite the pedal till you start hearing small amounts of chirping from the tires to 25-20 two or three times. Then drive around for a few minutes to let everything cool a bit before parking it. Warped rotors are caused by unequal cooling or extreme heat. If you don't let them cool a bit after burnishing you will have one spot that won't cool down for a significant amount of time due to the pads being in contact with the rotor.
It really sucks to hear you guys say a ($500) civic cuz in the Midwest you can't find a civic like thay for less than 2k
Why not something stupid like a twin charger setup? Then all the boost gatekeepers can be happy that you didn't skip their prefered boost method. I'd be fine with 1 big turbo if you have issues sourcing a pair. You guys usually make good calls with writing direction.
Love this series. Hope the cosmetics, interior and exterior gets an episode as well!
5 g’s and it’s a stock Honda rotor on the front assembly? 🧐
Y’all are gonna K swap it. You ain’t slick.
The most real episode ever.  Borrowing some fat wheels and hammering the fenders to fit them.  We've all been there.
K20 swap 🤌
Wow this gives the civic an extra value of about 150 on the market. All for just 5000$
show me where to find a civic that runs and drives, especially that clean, for 500; and ill show you a liar.
Whether this ends up a b swap or a k swap it better end up turbo with a colab from @boostedboiz
MORE CIVIC VIDEOS NOW
If bedding brakes try an industrial estate on the weekend
2:26, a spacer between the hub and rotor. What is the OD of the spacer? Does it come with the bbk kit? Thanks
I HATE to be that guy. But drums are just as good if not better than disk brakes for stopping. That's part of the reason they're still used on semis. What they aren't good at is getting rid of heat and the maintenance is a hassle. That's why they aren't on performance cars
If there’s Integra parts going on here, I hope that’s hinting at either a K or B series swap 😁
Does this count as a Money Pit series?
also for anyone wondering why they just kinda skimmed over the miata wheel temp swap....i bet the stock wheels whouldnt clear the calipers bkut the rpf1's do so quick fix just to get the video out
Put a Hayabusa engine in it 🙂
"The only way that entire car is worth $500 is if there's a $300 hooker sitting in it."
.18 seconds in and I got a peep of the rp1s👀. Niceeee🫡
Can’t wait till you guys throw that K in that EG!
Predator swap it
K swap. Or B series Frankenstein
I want a k swap.
Engine swap I see in the future
Not having ABS means you don't need bigger brakes, you cannot use the additional power even with race tires. Just a simple pad swap and higher temp fluid would be all you need for the fronts. The rear disks are probably better for heat dissipation.  If you are going to spend 5k on brakes (likely didn't actually) you want StopTech forged one piece calipers, and floating rotor setup. Still Less money than those Spoon crap 4 pots.
Turbo is done out on those types of eg’s where I’m from why not supercharge it 🤷🏽‍♂️
More Powa Baby!!
Can ABS be installed on it if it doesn't already have one?
B18c1 swap
Nice!
First twenty seconds: "Is five thousand dollars worth of brakes worth the money?" Well, no, not if you're driving that thing like a normal Civic, but I suspect shenanigans xD 1:20 edit: Oh yeah, those brakes are tiny, and drum brakes, oooh boy. Good plan to swap them over. 3:30: I'm never sure about double-sided pistons, do they work better than single-sided? The pressure in the brake line is the same so the pressure on the brake pads is the same, right? I dunno, can someone explain like I'm five? They sure do look nice though. 3:47 Oh they're so much bigger than I thought, not sure I like the way the Spoon caliper looks like it needs Spoon pads for those retention members to keep the pads from violently ejecting. 4:48 Holy cow that is one of the biggest things that could happen to this vehicle, dang! 6:10 I had wondered about the rotor for the front brakes, it looks pretty basic, will it's secret be revealed in the next bit? 7:00 Oh no, not Hammertime again...8:42 Oh no, this WILL come back again...11:55 Oh baby you know I love moar powah!
Fake not believable.  There is no such thing as a intact functional Honda being sold for  $500 in 2023 Joe Biden inflation economy,  let alone in California where Donut is filmed.
K swap incoming
This Civic may be my favorite thing to hit Donut since the Miata
put a turbo in it
1 letter, 2 numbers...   K20
dont know where yall got that ball joint but its wrong.
Not a civic anymore?
I wanna see Jerry do something with the bike he bought
Turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo turbo
What knuckle is it?
Just call it Money Pit
if its not a turbo idk what else lol
K swap ?
K20 baby
Idea, what if you do a Hi-Low but high car is a cheap car with expensive parts and low car is an expensive car with cheap parts. At the end of the season we see who’s faster, smoother, or cleaner!
stop telling people its $500....
road to making this civic run 400+ horse power!!
11:38 dude please tell me someone else noticed the fact that when he came to a stop so much weight was taken off the rear wheels that they spun even as the front drive wheels locked up 😧
im at like 7 minutes in the vid, but i really think you guys should've mentioned the fact that y'all are using slotted rotors in the rear but not the front, one is more impactful than the other thats for sure!
Drop that K20 into it.
More power? Please tell me that K20 you made a video on a few weeks ago is going in there with all 1,000hrsprs.
Blue and yellow ,Baby !!!!!🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Turbos baby!
Make it a proper civic build donut!
"it's gonna be okay." "is it?" "i don't know"  i'm fucking dead ahahahah
w all these oem acura parts you found,  you might as well have just built an integra. Lols
Now jz swap it
Poor guy 😢
Sand the stock side skirts and color match them, they'll look fresh and appealing
Now i want one! Love the civic
I can't see putting.5,000 dollar breaks on a 10,000-dollar car, ya know many many better Acura parts. Are interchangeable with Honda same company.
Now your 500$ car is a $1000 autocross champ
b-series i'm begging you, pls don't join the k dark side haha. a yonaka exhaust would be chefs kiss lol. loving the series, and glad to see the 'return' of these kinds of videos with jobe.
They might want to do a booster delete because when you throw big breaks and better stopping hardware it gets too easy to lock up but it wont compromise stopping power too much i have that on my civic
K swap
That strut on the rear window hanging was driving me crazy. please keep it a sleeper on the outside.
What makes me mad is I’ll watch undisputed and they will say something lebron had the most game winning ot tie shots with in 10 second and Kobe has like 4 but  there’s like 7 on here lol
we had a car guy here die because he had all new brakes and tires, didn't wait to bed or wear in the tread. skided over a cliffside doing 80, something he'd done in that spot regularly before.  wear stuff in before you hoon, and please hoon responsibly.
CUSTOM AERO KIT!
Heads up, proportioning valve isn’t working correctly because you locked up the front and the rears were still spinning during that last clip. Probably need an adjustable prop valve.
Keep killing the game ❤
This is the sickest build / series (?) yet. Keep it coming.
Cummins swap
So is Hector going to be running 3 of these to match the 3 spoon engines he has in his Honda Civics?
Wow and im searching for an affordable not damaged chassis, i dont need an engine dtill have my b18c1
supercharger 🤗💀
Kswap baby
I hate to be that guy, but I really feel like “bench bleeding” the master cylinder should have been discussed. You will never truly have an air free system without this step. Also, the proportioning valve is meant to reduce the brake pressure to the rear tires so that you don’t lose control while braking on a turn. Very very important details that could potentially save your life.
New intake, throttle body and ducting next. Let that thing breathe a little
Mr. Jobe is a f’n boss!!!!
Brakes.. damn, this ain't shit... *Old tires* just f*cling "unalive" me already!!!
Do an interior clean on that thing lmao
Cool to see they got the extended lower ball joint on the new knuckle even thought they didn't mention it
Lug centric rotors and wheels on stock studs,  How much thread engagement do you have? Better check before you hit the track.
I’m ready to see how this car turns out
Civc with a laptop
K24 swap
Love it! Let's see a k engine swap with turbo and have everyone take turns at an actual race event.
k20a swap, single turbo, 500 to the wheels
I put over 2k of C6 brakes on my 1999 s10 zr2 TODAY.  I see zero issues with upgrading Safety as much as you wanted
The reason your rear caliper might have locked up is because you may have not known to adjust the pushrod on the brake booster. When you install a different master cylinder, you have to measure the inside of the bore and ensure that when the brake pedal is fully released, that it will completely relieve pressure. Otherwise, you're effectively constantly building pressure every time you press the pedal. I just went through this on my Foxbody Mustang after doing a Cobra disk brake swap. Went for a drive after installing everything and 15 minutes later, my brakes just locked up after stopping at a light. The brake booster was not adjusted properly. Now it works fine. Check that brake booster or you risk running into serious trouble!
Those wider tires probably added more stopping power than the new brakes.
Don't you guys have that k20 in your last video slap that mf in there wit big turbos🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽
I cant wait till they finish upgrading this car, going to be sick little machine.
@jakeriffial3643 right bro 😂😂I’m so weak 7:43
Turbo the d15. Do it. $800 Ebay turbo kit and at least 10 psi of torqueless wonder
A honda civic moneypit would be great
Turbo kit  boost the single jingle
Can we make a money pit civic possibly?? I’d be more than interested
swap ls3
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Donut is the best! I recommend the whole world watches this video.
K swap???? Got the brakes to stop the car now and even grippy tires for it. Only can only hope
Do a money pit evo next time
Some of us already know your doing a k20 swap
nonsense , put 200$ brakes on a 100.000$ car ! ❤️👀
"stopping on a dime" proceeds to lockup and slide past the cameraman
Put $5000 worth of audio in it now
What was that piece you showed right before you threw on the rotor?
How are you going to get going fast enough to use the full potential of those brakes??? ¯\_(-_-)_/¯
Vtec head would be a great way to add power buuuuut putting a B20 with a Vtec head would be awesome!!!
B18 or K20 engine!
Im here to say what everyone is really thinking. LS swap it!😂
This car isnt secure as It seems... I do this same thing in a Citroen c3... And It didnt Go well
Why aren't the new front rotors drilled and/or slotted?
A few questions, why are the rear calipers and pads so much smaller than the front, and why did you go with vented rotors in the back but solid in the front? Heat dissipation for the tiny rear pads? Also, at 11:37 minutes in, your front brakes lock up completely while the rear tires are still rolling, something isn't right with your brake balance, that can lead to fishtailing as the rear of the car tries to catch up to and pass the front, which is really bad if it happens during winter with ice or snow(probably not an issue in California), or if you're trying to stop on loose gravel.
Turbo
Missed you jobe! You’re my favorite donut guy
New fav series
Spent 5k on bbk but not $80 on a fender roller 😅
yall should work on an integra
I love how this car is turning into money pit
Put h22 in it
How much more fun is that to drive now with the new suspension and brakes (and tires)? Should feel like a whole new car!
Engine swap!!!
Nice to watch n learn some of things cause I also planning to change my civic Brake...
B18c next!
Should be a pretty much stock dc5 itr swap for power
Nice wheres the 18psi turbo? on a k24?
My guess is we'll see them start on a K swap next episode. Unless they're turboing the D series in true money pit fashion 😮
Please more donut
PowerStop’s break in procedure is my go to! Perform 5 moderate to aggressive stops from 40 mph down to 10 mph in rapid succession without letting the brakes cool and do not come to a complete stop. If you’re forced to stop, either shift into neutral or give room in front so you can allow the vehicle to roll slightly while waiting for the light. The rotors will be very hot and holding down the brake pedal will allow the pad to create an imprint on the rotor. This is where the judder can originate from.  Then do 5 mod­erate stops from 35 mph to 5 mph in rapid succession without letting the brakes cool. You should expect to smell some resin as the brakes get hot.  After this is complete, drive around for as long as possible without excessively heating the brakes and without coming to a complete stop (Try for about 5 minutes at moderate speed).   This is the cooling stage. It allows the heated resin in the brake pads to cool and cure.  After the brakes have cooled to standard operating temperature, you may use the brakes normally.
Turbo kit then k or b swap
Still watching while typing... No extended studs with spacers? Plz put extended studs
The beauty of these cars is that it is easy to work on and looks great with just wheels and suspension.
roll a baseball bat to flare your fenders
i want a $500 civic to put thousands of dollars into
VTEC
4:37 Actually drum breaks are better when you watch only break force compared to disk break. But they huge drawback is fading.
Maybe turbo charge it
FINALLY MORE MONEY PIT STYLE VIDEOS AAAA
I speak for everyone when I say please keep these going.
love all your content Donut, but gotta say I love seeing when you guys work on cars. It motivates me to work on my car more too, thank you!
nothing about this video makes any sense to the average joe with a civic, 4 grand and above on calipers while using mismatched stock rotors while bedding on public roads.
KAY SCHWAP??
Please make this a full build and drag race it at Hoonigan This vs That
too much background music
Fresh coat of paint?
Shoulda just used an aluminum baseball bat since the roller wouldn’t fit.. 😩😩
"sometimes you take it apart and put it back together and its all better" 100% feel this as a diagnostics technician, almost as relatable as "every 20 minute job is 1 broken bolt away from being a 3 day ordeal"
Where did you find a 500$ civic and do you have any tips
I hope the power increase comes in the form of a B series or K series engine swap.
such a sick series, keep it up!
FINALLY CIVIC VIDEOS
My favorite videos are the ones where you guys just work on a car
It like 2000 doller for a  civic we're I live wish you guys could send one for me 😢
As a 96 accord owner I’m loving this series.
New money pit with the EG?
Awd set up.
Come on baby, it obvious. Unless you guys aren’t in boost creeps gang anymore 😂😂😂
K swap calling it right now lol
Hope your health is better now Zazh.
Owning a EG hatch watching them do all the mods ive been planning out is definitely some good insight, never would have thought to do the master cylinder and portion valve
Spoon is STILL HONDA, ok?
Instead of thinking as this as the moneypit miata, how bout cash hole honda a series that seems to follow moneypit formula but still its own. Just a thought
😮is this not like money pit?
Keep it up ZJ!
Finnaly ! I love this series ❤❤❤
Mechanic here, what your experiencing with the wheel locking up seems to be classic failing brake hose symptoms, the rubber brake hose on that axle is internally faulty and collapsing on itself which does not let fluid flow back through freely, as it is not being forced by hydraulic pressure. If it was the caliper sticking then releasing the pressure (opening the bleeder) would do nothing to help.
i really seen the channel grow over the years. love the work u guys put in
Put that "pit bike" nitro kit on this thing lol
8:55  "Sometimes you take it apart and put it back together and it's all better." Mechanic's equivalent of turning it off and back on again.
Hey guys, how about a video on how to find a $500 civic?!?!?
the ultimate touge car
Can you guys do a pro vs diy on ceramic coatings?
LS swap it you coward
Engine Swap...
Turbo on hondata lol
I didn't know you had to season your new rotors.  Always learn something new
Aero, like real try hard type time attack civic. Put a v10, just cause...
You have that k series in the back of some videos you can toads that in there 😬
S 14 Money Pit RB 25 Swap
No links for parts?
Can u guys try super charged or turbo it
Do the pads touch the brakes at rest or are they just off them?
Spoon brakes are sick, I had spoon parts on my gsr
Love this I got one of my own and doing great things with it.
please money pit this thing
more power eh? and trailing arms and brake setup off an Integra? Im thinking you fellas may throw a B Series in that badboy!
What makes this kit 5000 this shouldn’t have costed more than 1500
I’m guessing a K swap is what they’re gonna do
Turbo charge it
Hard to think of this as a money pit series because it's a civic hatchback lol
But no lie i almost cried when i seen what you was doin with the hammer. Poor civic 🫠😫😭
back in my day what you call "bedding breaks" was known as "You're warping the new disks you idiot"
It would be interesting see that engine swap from that engine boosted up
Y'all should just build and turbo a d series engine tbh. I know all the engine swaps but a turbo D is a ton of fun and more and more rare now days. Doesn't seem like y'all are aiming for a world speed record or nothing, something that light boosted is a ton of fun while still being dailyable
I'd love to see you guys do an OLD SCHOOL 2000's build on this thing. B18 swap, or a built b16a. Something cool. Just not a k swap
Drum brakes "they  do their job ok .... but they dont brake good "
$5000 engine in a $500 Civic, K20A swap when?!?
drum brakes have more stopping power than disc, it's just that drums heat so quickly
Drum brakes want to know what the inside of your thump looks like take them apart to replace a shoe
The new money pit is awesome ❤
That Civic like that is pretty attractive to dialy drive to many people LOL
Zach!!!! <3
Another way to clearance the fender is use a socket about the size of gap you want and slowly lower the jack and wratchet the socket between the tire and fender. The socket grips the tire and rolls forward and the other side of the socket flares out the lip.
Zach top g videos.
Where tf do you find a $500 civic in that kind of condition?
Honestly he got a good ass deal. Id die to find a eg for 500 even if it didnt have a motor
Did I watch you put grease on your brakes?
Love that car. The brakes are way over rated. A standard rear disc brake upgrade kit would have been plenty. However the upgrade to the entire knuckle explains a lot of the cost here.
My mom is rough on vehicles anyway i could send one to yall and y’all do something like this we have a 2000 ford contour that is a bit messed up and i feel that you have to see the paint job that was put on this thing, and we have a 08 dodge grand caravan se that suspension suck, it breaks down every month or two and just generally sucks.  I really feel y’all would enjoy shitting on the contour
It is a civic, just buy a laptop.
Do a touch screen radio upgrade.. a bigg oh pad
Skunk intake manifold
K swap
Upgraded money pit and im here for it
As Minnesotan watching people work on cars that don’t drive on salt is so satisfying.
I love how the additional "upgrades" on the side are just parts picked off a different Honda
Fender roller NOT working because of fitment, Part 2.
Zach Jobe Is the best  Donut has to offer. And I love what he does.
I’d like to see a new shifter/ clutch before the power. Make it more fun to drive
Turbo baybeeeeee
Car Jesus returns!
a hOnda moneypIt!?
Love the contact but since you're not putting the blue calipers on the back you can least paint the other ones blue in the back
Zack rules. Parts, price of parts + car still overrated 🤷🏻‍♂️
Just call it the money pit civic, make a Playlist, and run it! We missed this, we missed Zach. Thank you Donut
K swap
New money pit?
Please make this civic a sleeper build
please remove the music during dialogue next time. it doesnt feel like a video from donut anymore and its annoying
Add a new 5000 exhaust on the civic😂
OMFG.... I NEVER thought I'd see the day when they been "spooning" on Donut ;D
Just imagine buying a 200$ dollar car and using you  entire life savings upgrading it 💀
I want to see a b20z2 block and a b16b head
It says "Cars are pain" on the wall...lol
i wanna see how light they can make it
diggin the seiko Zach.
So is this a ABS?
wait why only spoon on the front?!
$5000 for that? Solid rotors and 2 4 piston calipers???
$5000 and they still had to use stock honda discs? What an absolute con lol
I'd like to see paint and what it takes to get it done when it come to picking the paint color and quality, and what you need to do if you plan on driving the vehicle on the streets when you paint it. What do you need to do when it comes to the title and changing the paint color and stuff, the cost and things like that
Definitely going to k swap it, or maybe I see an ls in it's future😂😂
The best series this channel has had to offer for a long time… all the satire just gets old after awhile, refreshing to finally see some good enthusiasts content again
k swap incoming....
They forgot to polish the brakes
still eligible to be a 24 hours of Lemons car  just sayin
honestly looks friggin schweet wiff demm innnnkaaaaayyyyyssss
Not a Donut video if something isnt working right.
They should have done a new hi low series with the civics
Waiting for this video to arrive thank god more of this video in this car please
Hmmm.. I remember there being a 2JZ at donut that needed a home...perhaps a civic???
Why didn’t you do a 60 to 0 stop test measurement before and after? Shame.
Lol here in the east coast thats a 5000 dollar civic. No joke. You find an eg hatch with a simple no vtec b18, 8-10 grand. Gsr or type r or k swap, add another 4-6 grand. Its crazy.
Just trusting that one brake
Why take too long for this episode finally you uploaded it
2006 HONDA CIVIC
Make it a sleeper
Ricer
k20a swap the civic
When my fender roller didnt fit my car, i took to the fenders with a hammer and pliers with a few rags to protect the paint (before i even decided to paint the car anyway). Sorry Jimmy, some things just have to be done.
Turbo??🤔
Does Donut media have a 401k?
Turbo time?
Take the upgrades to the track!
When the brakes are more expensive than the car😂
K SWAAAPPP🔥🔥🔥
Loving that civic! ❤️ Reminds me of my current '95 hatch. As for mopowa, I'm thinking motorswap. Thinking either a B-series or a fun K-swap. Look forward to whatever is next for this hatch
$5k is insane for brakes, thats twice what custom ceika's are with custom 3 piece rotors
It's important to tell people not to brake heavily in a way that endangers or impedes traffic. "I was testing my new *insert basic car part here*," is not an excuse when trying to explain a major accident.
Toyota be like: Drum brakes are fine for a Tacoma.
its nice seeing an old civic get some love. Honestly great little cars and can go very for pretty dang cheap if done correctly.
Mo Powah Babeh!! Turbo that baby! Cold air intake, port the head, lighter pistons, new valve profile :)
Vw TDI diesel swap???
Love this type of content!!!  Btw - worth getting some chrome molybdenum impact sockets.  I got a full set for about £100, better than shattering a chrome vanadium socket and risking getting impaled by flying metal lol
It looks so weird seeing those shiny expensive parts on what's practically a junker.
Wide body kit
K swap
I miss driving in the canyons in my little veloster that can. Too bad I parted ways with it and I drive a Prius LOL.......
Every time I watch this channel I always get more and more angry that I can't afford a lift so jealous
I'm glad an old Honda is getting love from donut, that's where a lot of us got started. [H]
Let’s not forget the $8000 in suspension they added 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ and this is not real. At all. There is not a single slightly intelligent person who would sell this for $500. Very educational but not realistic in any way.
I’ve always wanted a civic or Impreza to trick out. Now donut just makes me want it more
Swap in a Mountune 2.3 ecoboost.
I’m thrilled to see what the whole donut team decides on what’s next been watching this show for a minute now and definitely love everything about it.super stoked to see all you grow.
Put a K series in it, then spray over the body 😅
Definitely my favourite series at the moment, I’d like to see a bolt on turbo kit or for it to or painted/wrapped a nice colour
k20a swap
I just started subscribing and I gotta say I love your video man helps me a lot when I don't even know crap about cars. One day I hope to become good as y'all
I smell turbo civic
You won't believe how many people put slotted drilled rotors on backwards.  So offen I second guess my own. But I'm educated and know right from wrong
Must shop at the same place Hector does.
In Indonesia that civic in best condition worth almost 300 million rupiah equal to 20.000 USD
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Hector is gonna be running 3 Honda civics with spoon engine's.  On top of that he just came into Harry's and ordered 3 t66's turbos with NOS and a Motech Exhaust System
K24a turbo swap
So basically, just buy an Integra
500$ car my A$$
Yo Zach is toasted
Lessssgoooooo
A supercharger would be nice
New Nissan Jukes... sorry i mean Nissan Pukes, have drum brakes in the rear on the base model. For what reason I have no idea, just Juke things... uhh i mean just Puke things.
Civic Hatchback of this year, has always been my dream car.
Is that a Boca juniors reference?
This is what donut does best.
B18c swap it for next episode stay with the old itr build :D
Where the hell did you find a $500 civic
Yay, an American who put slotted rotors on the correct way around
Rotors that are not drilled or slotted make go???? Why?
I'll take the car for 550
Yeah it showed me you slam the brakes at intersections and stop signs.
Spoon? The same spoon that Hector is running in his 3 three Honda civics?
When is donut going to build a drag racing car?
Turbo it
EG here costs $20K 😢
Now I know why this car is the most stolen car in CA...
i was making a livery then found the spoon company, by coincidence.
Put hundred bucks on painting
pls make more vid abt the civic !!
I really hope that you put the k20a you rebuilt in an earlier video in this bad boy
that EG is nolan’s beybi
Kswap babyyyyyyy!!!!
Are you putting the K20 in it?
mo powa
I'm doing the same to a Pontiac G6 gt 09
We need more of this pocket rocket. Pleasssssse
Can y’all do paint and body work on one of the money pit cars?
MOTOR SWAP THAT HOEEEEEEe VTECCCCC preferably a B18C red top type R 197hp 133tq or H22A red top SiR 217 hp 163tq and do H to B trans plate with b16a trans
Imma still say... Take it to the upcoming 24hrs of Lemons with the crew with 4 drivers and make it fly. It's a 500 bucks car in the end which fits Lemon rules 100%.
this my favorite typo of series
for more power you will keep the shell and replace everything else with Acura parts like you did so far lol
Money Pit Civic?
For more power, obviously an engine swap, maybe a b16 or b18 if you're being period correct.
#1 fan
Please build a car that lasts long not just for demo, but bring in many episodes
What year is that civic
After power can u guys wide body that thing it is an awsome car
Why not use performance break fluid too?
where the hell have you been?
❤FABULOUS !!! ❤ I've got an EJ1 coupe, by far the nicest for me,  and I need to replace the whole suspension, I think it's the original! 😆 Can't wait to see the power upgrade... Not sure whether to turbo the my D16z VTEC to 250hp or swap a stock B18c to 197hp. My dream is to make the BEST JDM Civic Coupe possible, not the fastest. That means every upgrade possible from Honda.👌A shame we can't upload images here...
Yeeeeah money pit is back babyyy
Strange how the rear disks are slotted and drilled and yet the fronts aren't 🤔
Please no fart can
f honda civics...get a job and buy a real car.
its a great car model to do this series on, looks good, its cheap, and heavily modifiable
Maybe install a brake bias adjustment…
No bench bleeding the master cylinder? Disappointed 😢
Header, downpipe, intake, sparkplugs.....😅
I'm excited to watch clueless kids and their poor attempts at bedding the brakes after watching this video.
james < jerimiah, zach, or noland
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I have a 92 eg with a gsr swap. Never got the brakes and the swap was blowing clouds of oil after some vtec. It's been sitting for a year and a half now as a ton of thing starting going out. Finally going to rebuild it this summer and got the brakes and a Tom of new parts.
gosh who is this honda driver that keeps brake checking me today
This isn't helping me resist getting a Spoon brake set up for my ITR, Zach
Idk I feel like donut is running out of idead
Stop lying to us! This is not a $500 Civic, you are in Los Angeles, there is 0 chance you brought one in this condition running and driving.
👍
Let's be real, we all knew this was getting a K swap from day one.   Let's just make it happen already!  Love you guys!
B series swap? 👀
I’m predicting a Tanabe Racing Medallion with a gutted cat next! Just like the old days!! Oh also a Broadway mirror My Shaldan air freshener, some blue headlight bulbs by PIAA and a type R sticker some where. All that will net about 1000 horses if memory serves.
Now we know why they rebuild that honda engine🤔
You guys are definitely putting a big ole fart can on that thing 😂😂😂
is this a new MoneyPit series? 🤔
throw a budget turbo on so i can learn to tune with a turbo
Best money pit yet!😊
Algorithm
I need about 2-3 more “money pit” style videos like this going at a time.
K swap
More power? Here's how. Sink 6 grand into the head n cam, exhaust, and intake. "Stock bottom end" it. Or 2 gerbils and a mountain of crack.
Now K swap it
Swap it next
Get some steelies and a drag wing  and supercharge it 😎
That civic is gonna be awesome
So wait, do brake pads scrape on the brake discs all the time? They're like touching all the time and when you brake they touch some more? I didn't know that they're so close together
Just like roadkill putting way to nice of parts on a not to nice of a car😂
Get the sweet 1000hp K20 engine in there. You know you want to.
in love with this series
Are we going to ignore Zach’s Rolex now?
No 5 lug conversion? 🤦🏾‍♂️
I think you need to spend that kind of money on the Chang Li truck
Do a b series  swap
K24A swap
Shouts out to whoever edited this
Need a little more bias in the rear.
Y’all should have just bought 10 more civics honestly
Love this content! I feel like this thing is getting a k swap or a turbo… both? Maybe both
This Civic hatch build series got me feeling like I'm 19 all over again.
Traffic must be confused on why your filming a stock looking Honda.   Car guys: woah that’s the $500 honda from donut media
no brake test before and after? fail
Gonna laugh when all this shit breaks cars are pain for these guys.
Say it with me... B swap! B swap! B swap!
We need drag car high low, with new edge mustangs or 4th gen Camaros or something
K20C1 with a big ol turbo
This is my favourite generation of civic. There's only one thing to do when trying to add more power...a K20 swap!!!
Add that K20 bebe
if you really love the civic why don't you wash it
I guess my eyes are bad, cuz i dont see rust at all on that civic
Good to see Jobe back fully healthy. Super exited to see were this little hatch ends up down the road.  Full build🤞🏼! Us Honda fan boys need it!
You need the chassis stiffener installation kit!
Could have just adjusted the camber so it doesn't rub also would give you better grip in corners, but i guess hammer works too
4:53  sounded like army of me by bjork
crush it next bet you wont make all the honda kids cry
WHERE DID U FIND A 500 CIVIC
You used a mallet on the fender?  Should have used a wooden rolling pin.  That's what I did with my miata, worked a treat, just as much effort.
the one thing drum rears have over disc only rears is on a hill, you'll feel safer knowing you have the drum.
Toss an LS under the hood Zak. Mo powah babeh.
Yo. I like how you improved the break before engine performance. Well done.
Slap some ITBs on there, im bored of the big power builds
😁 You put these fantastic new brakes on to make you stop quicker, then you lock your wheels up, which doesn't stop you 😱! 😂 just joking, great vid
I hope it’s a k20 swap!
These videos take me back, I miss my 1989 CRX Si, I had 1 Spoon part on it, a lower tie bar. I also ran Enkei RPF1's on my Prelude. Those wheels were awesome, super strong and lightweight.
He is so good at explaining things to people who don't know a lot about cars. It's so good to introduce people to fixing their own stuff
I ordered a hoodie from y’all like 4 Months ago now and it never arrived. 💔
SUPERCHARGED CIVIC WHEEEEEEEEEE
Screw it! Go crazy and make it full electric. Give it Zeus buff horses.
k-swap
one of my favorite things about hondas.... damned lego cars!  "well, this isn't gonna work.... looks like imma need to find an aftermar- oh shit, there's the part i need leftover from the last honda job! how convenient!"  oh, and donut, if you guys are gonna turbo it, don't forget the strut and frame supports...... the torque steer on these things can be a little bit nuts..... though i think the coup might be worse? not sure.. we kept getting distracted and never finished the hatch. hahaha.
I want you to put in a high revving K engine with a 4 to 1 equal length header. Aggressive VTEC cams. Make a nasty naturally aspirated sleeper cat Fisher.
Drop in a v6 j engine from an accord!
Replace the brake booster with double diaphragm
For the engine I think k24 for sure to this eg
More power? So what, D16 swap with a nice turbski?
XD
More content please If this was a money pit video this would be the best one yet. Looking forward for more videos.
Kind surprised you didn’t go for the period correct 5 luck conversion. Also I’m with Jimmy. Don’t hammer the car use the baseball bat method
This is my favourite project so far. More powa baby? Intake - Header - Exhaust.
Man the Civic looks kinda mean on those RPF1s
Kb1 calipers = Spoon calipers?
still waiting on that engine swap, 😁
In electronics its... "Some times you take it apart and put it back together then it works.......wait what do these 3 screws and a spring go to?"
B17A1 Swap!!! Paired with the EM1 Si Trans ( TRUST )
Add a turbo
This car dating back to my time, I remember the  most important performance mod being a giant subwoofer
I just want to know whos their editor because these are great
Kinds seems like you tryna build a.............(toretto voice) Family
This "build" might be the dumbest thing you guys have done 😭
Air intake, exhaust and cams and better ecu . No Turbo!
Just call this money pit
Why?
$500 civic, $4000 suspension, $5000 brake system. And do a single jingle turbo setup jst to spice things up a bit.
Im with Jimmy here
So when you guys swapping in a Vtec Head 👀
Possibly a noob question, why drilled and slotted on the rear but not front? Wouldn't you want the performance of drilled and slotted on the front where the main braking is done?
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 -----> TWIN SCREW SUPER CHARGER! <---- 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Cause AMERICA!!!!! 👍👍
Get some headers on that little blue egg
Should have done the baseball bat or magazines method on the fenders.
We all know more stickers mean more power.
[sobs in midwest] WHERE IS THE RUST?
A fully aspirated car, no turbo. Let's see how much power you can extract of this engine without snails  😈
$500 eg hatch? Yeah ok can't even buy a COMPLETELY bare shell with no wheels and a salvage title for that much
hi-low budget car
We Put $5000 Brakes on our $500 Civic why cause we have unlimited power!!! I mean money🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I haven't seen one of these 90s Civics in years. Everyone wants one to mod.
Should have went 5 lug for that price
My 93 Ex 4 door sedan had 4 wheel disc brakes. Not sure if that info is helpful or not.
Idk if you guys said this in a previous video before but since yall bought the 500$ civic , i hope you guys turn it into a series where you guys basically transform it to look more modern and fixed and ofc add modifications.
put in an expensive exaust and blow off valves make herrr sound sexy for me PLEASE
Yes cause here in ohio where we actually Have the Largest honda manufacturing Plant in the u s For some reason that same car would at least be $2500 And that's if It was in worse condition with rust issues
This car might be a good candidate for nitrous... It's not turbo-charged, it's cheap... maybe?
2jz swap!!!!
I am a big fan of TAROX breaks. Instead of going the huge piston route, they go with multiple smaller pistons. For example a Subaru STI will have 4 pot front brakes and some people upgrade to large 6 pot. The TAROX brand will put 6 pot in the same form factor as a big brake 4 pot. And they can go up to 12 pots! for super large calipers. way better petal feel and less heat. They actually compared their STI upgrade kit vs the stock Brembo kit that comes on STI's and their kit could go longer on Nurburgring without brake fade.... which is a huge plus.  as far as bedding brakes goes, I used to do that just so customers wont come back complaining. I would take the car out and do 15-0 a few times in parking lot. 30-0 a few times in parking lot. then 60-0 a few times on the main road (we had back roads I could use with not much traffic). and by the time i was done their brakes were working perfectly. its more about applying heat and getting everything sitchiated (lmao). never once had customer complaints, if anything I get the "my brakes never felt this good" because most shops today don't waste time to bed brakes in. they just replace and let the customer go home so they can get onto the next vehicle....
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running 3 Honda Civics with spoon engines. And on top of that he just came into Harry's and he ordered 3 T66 turbos, with NOS, and a Motec system exhaust.
Never understood why it was called a “knuckle”. Plus there’s something about calling it a knuckle that feels dirty 😂
Should've painted those real calipers to match
Love the Civic, keep making it better, I'm working on my Olds Aurora, just keeps getting better.😎
Looks to me like they’re trying to build a toog car with this build but i could be wrong
5g for that. Wow!
Am with Jimmy 😭 stop stop he's already dead/rice.
me personally I like this cars I hope see more videos with the hatchback
this is why i watch donut, i never knew about bedding the brakes and now I wont forget either
Gotta add some tasteful aero mods. key word is Tasteful.
miatas suck. they have no power theyre not fun to drive. i dont know why anyone likes them. and yes i have driven one. not impressed, i prefer bought not built.
Go G23 with b series tranny. Everybody goes k series so I wanna see something different and maybe it’ll be a challenge🫡💯
Hims has the spoonie boi's
k20a with a little G30 surely
K24 go brrr
Spoon😮
B18 turbo 😮
Money put civic
AWD sawp it
Haha should of bought a ex like me .
Turbo baby 🎉
Did you guys sell the rights to the name ‘money pit’?
Are spoon brakes any different from just buying regular nissin 4 pot calipers or is it just that it says spoon on the side that's the only difference
I'm glad you explain here that bigger brakes aren't about stopping power, they're about heat dissipation. I've got big brakes front and rear on my MINI R50 and it stops the same as before, but it stops MORE.
The highest mileage Lexus isf is for sale. Buy it and make videos
Money pit season 3
Swap a k series into this bad boy!
J35 build
Next High Low should be two Integras cuz you guys mention them so often (totally not biased)
Someone please correct me if I am wrong, but when converting froms drums to discs. Shouldnt the proportional valve be replaced with a metering valve?  To prevent nose diving?
ME LOVE DONUT
That is gonna fly with the k20 engine you guys have in it!! Love a good k20 EG ❤ can't wait to see the end result.
PLEASE DO A 07 HONDA CR-V❤❤❤
man I haven't heard the word "steezy" in years  thx for bringing me back to 2010
I wish there was a 500 civic by me
What tires are on it?
Cold air intake should have been first mod lolol
you got the life, buying cool ass parts to put on cars then beat on them. thats the life at least for some one like me.
for any youngins watching you shouldn’t bed brakes on stock rotors and pads you run the risk of overheating because they’re not equipped to handle repetitive forceful braking like performance parts are.
K24z7 Swap and boost it!!!  🤩🤩🤩
K24a swap
Spoon breaks have a reputation for cracking 😬
k20a from the type R. mo powah baby
Hell yeah. Honda goooood.
swap in a b20 :) b series ftw
Are you guys going to k swap it
Music for this vid is on point
Differential > power
Soooo, 9k into wheels, tires, suspension and brakes.  9.5K into a EG. Haven’t touched power another 10K and orrrrrr interior safety ( seat, harness and roll bar/cage ) another 5K soooo by the time you’re done we are looking at 24.5 to 25k before paint and restoration of body parts. This is a 30 to 35K
my friends always gave my shit for putting on drilled/slotted rotors in that direction.... i thought the slots were supposed to not run parralel with brake pad, cross direction is better ? or no?
It'll be a k20 swap. They already did vid on one so (?) I hope :)
Better intake and cold air maybe turbo but that might be a different video later on
My first car was a 2000 Honda Accord with the 3.0 Vtec V6. I bought it for $500 in April of 2021. Now I have upgraded to a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix GT and have been doing loads of modifications to it. So yes people if you look hard enough you can find a car for $500, even in this economy. Took me literally months of searching and negotiating.
Bring back science garage
Is this money pit? Is it Hi/Low? Where's the Hi car?
Hi-Low Motorcycle builds?
Is this gonna be the new money pit
Never been a fan of spoon or their blue and yellow. I’m sure it’s great though
k24 turbo AWD setup let's go ! one of my most viewed video was a jdm eg6 k20 !!
Lol, put $5000 dollar breaks on a $500 dollar car making it still only worth $500 dollars.😂
Should have taken it to a shop for the fender roll..
Zach the man
No mather what you do, PLZ USE AN LSD!!! l saw another youtube chanel K swap a civic for the track, and not using LSD... Neglecting one of the most important aspect of a good built, TRACTION!!!!
k swap
Where can I get a civic that clean for $500? In Michigan that thing would be $4,000 😂
"If i learned anything....its that things fix themselves all the time" 💯👍🤣🤣🤣 Great attitude!!!
saw the title and thought this was going to be another high/low ngl
BRING BACK MONEY PIT MAN
Next time just do the pads.
Loving this series and learning a lot! Thanks dude!
I had a B16a swapped CRX DX with stock brakes. Definitely needed a brake upgrade :P
Did I miss it? why use drilled and slotted on the back but not the front?
Sorry you're not feeling so hot buddy
i wish i can get one with $500 in UK :(
I don't know if the front rotor vanes are straight or curved but they looked curved and backwards on the passenger corner to me during installation. Anyone else see that or was it just me??
Whats steezy?
Moar powa baby
We put a $5,000 engine on our $500 Civic
Don't be k swapping beef up that B series like the old days haha
Tuned propane or LNG swap
Drums have excellent braking force, its brake fade and adjusting you have to worry about
I love donut but the boys need a air hammer in the shop😂
Where’d they get $5k from? Those calipers are $1700. Everything else is cheap. Unless they’re including the cost of the Rpf1’s and Toyo’s.
Average civic owner mod
Hi-low integra 🤔
Make Jimmy cut it into a convertible 🤣 he was soooo heart broken when u started hammering at it! 🤣😂🤣
Next : putting 4000$ worth of turbo kit onto a 500$ civic.
Do an integgy next pls Donut, I have one but I need some advice to upgrade it.
How come the civic is like a peugeot 206/8 or opel corsa or ford fiesta or renault clio to both the Japanese and the Americans? I get the Japanese but is it just that the Americans don't build small cars?
Joke.. not a single bit of slip grease copper grease or nothing.. appalling show
Hello guys. Im here for some advise regarding a Honda Civic that i wanna buy. Its a Honda Civic EJ9 1998 , 1.4i S, 75 HP with 160k km, around 100k miles i think. The owner sells it for 800 but maybe i can negociate for 700 or even 600 at best. It has some rust and in dire need for repainting but the owner says everything else is good. Im gonna go and see about the car, drive, feel how it drives but i need help from honda owner or someone who knows the prices of these beauties to tell me if its worth its money. Btw its stock. :)
There gonna LS swap it
Engine swap
if your brake lines flex when pressing the pedal. theres something wrong
money pit civic?
Man you coulda used a phone book a metal bar or baseball bat for the fenders!! Lol
i love it honestly maybe increase as much hp and tq as u can with out adding a  turbo....definitely add a turbo....just not yet
Acura TL-S brembo is like the same for 10 times less ,but yeah 😏 👍
I'm proud of Donut for actually doing the eg rear disc swap correctly, what with swapping the p valve and master cylinder.
so does this mean i can add btter brakes before power?
Uh……..why? Good show on explaining how BREAKS WORK to those who do not understand the first thing about BRAKES👍👍
This was my 1st car 15 years ago. The front indicator light used to fly off when I get to high speeds on the freeway…. I used to carry spares in my boot…
DId you use the existing handbrake cable or change it for one to utilise the rear discs?
I thought you guys forget this car😂
Just a fun reminder, bedding your brakes in VA is considered wreckless driving and the cops will take your license... Even if you never exceed the speed limit.
That reminds me I remember when I was bedding my brakes a cop saw me in the distance and pulled me over and asked me if I was drunk 😂
Me: -"Why??" -clicks one the video -"Just why????" -watches the video -"Damn it." -finishes the video
i just saw that spoon civic, the older one on the highway coming home from moonlight beach
I like the tried and true method of rolling fenders by just setting the car down, and using a baseball bat while rolling on the tread. perfect clearance everytime :0
So where the heck did they find a new 40/40 prop valve from an RS Integra tho… Also why shelf brake fluid and not RBF or SRF?!
I get that someone may have sold them the civic for $500, but man, still feels kind of click-baity when you know the car is definitely worth a bit more than that lol
Donut after the Subaru Hi Lo series ends: We spent way too much money let's just buy a cheap Civic Donut after the Subaru Hi Lo and Civic videos bring in revenue: Now let's put brakes on the Civic that cost 10 times the car itself.  And that's why we love Donut.
High Low Tacoma rock crawlers please! Could do 1 ton swaps and external cages etc
4:46 damn, that thing is CLEAN 😍😍
Crazy the upgrades cost more than my car already
spacer behind the rotor is crazy... lol
Why do the rears get drilled and slotted but not the fronts? Also opinions on drilled and slotted versus blanks?
does anyone else find it hard to believe they got a not rusty civic hatch for 500
Don't forget to bench bleed your master cylinder before installing.
how about supercharging this civic? That would be extremely funny and cool at the same time
What was that stamped piece you put on before the rotor ?
K swap baby more power!
Yes! This is going to be new money pit! I am here for it!
why
Please do forged B18 w big a$$ turbo 🙏🏻
More power.. Do an EV swap ⚡️⚡️⚡️🍌🥖⚡️
Back in the day it was between that exact Integra trim or a gen 5 black Prelude. I picked the Prelude.
This build series is basically the same as my car. £600 civic getting the good parts
MO POWA
K20a swap 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Now I would like to see a crazy custom ABS system programmed for max braking power on that "thing" or just the feet of a pro racer, whatever comes cheaper 😁😎
That car is going to be sick!
Next video: $3000 headlights
I wish someone would do accord coupe v6 build
Just got a 2015 camaro ss 6 speed manual with long tube headers and a cold induction intake and a muffler delete I am gonna pull 0  baddys with it 🫡
JDM it. Collabrate with MCM
Should’ve done a before and after on the length!  From 145 ft to like 115 ft…🤔  We don’t know the actual benefits!!!
Time for that k swap now!
transform it with little bit wide fenders and k20 swap it!
I remember I bought a new project car. I bought it knowing it had no brakes according to the owner. He said all it took was to bleed them. He said he tried and tried and tried to bleed them but to no avail no brakes. He thought he mightve been bleeding them wrong. So I start to bleed them, I changed the hoses, master cylinder, and booster. Still no brakes. It wasnt until I changed the proportioning valve with a junk yard unit that my brakes finally bled properly.
we need more content on this it's amazing and fun!
Very dull video. 🥱
For sure they gotta supercharge it
Id love to see them just keep building this thing. Eventually do a lil b18 or b20 build
Where did you find a $500 civic?
honestly I was hoping for something nicer than spoon calipers for 5k. All they're really doing is what people have been doing to civics for at least 3 decades.
Zack Attack !
So what was the improvement?!? Where’s the numbers 😂
Yall shoudk build the civic, built motor, suspension, brakes, ect. A super money pit if you will
You could have gone with a double booster setup. It would have improved breaking more
I did that shit too lmao but I keep blowing my motor🥲
Is this donut pivoting to doing educational car builds and moving away from clickbait list bullshit?  If so, super on board.
$500 civic series is dope
Dont let this distract you fromthe fact Hector is gonna be running three Honda Civics with Spoon engines. On top of that, he just came into Harry’s and ordered three T66 turbos with NOS and a Motec system exhaust.  And now supposedly he has spoon brakes
Spoon? I heard Hector was running a couple of those, along with three T66 turbos with NOS and a Motec system exhaust!
Drums are better than disk for a single stop, but fade faster and harder.    In on the street driving drums will stop better.
11:10 the hair moving as he brakes
please maked this weekly instead of monthly
what about the ae86 from James, will be there a video about it in the future? or the s14
Possible k swap?
You gotta do an exhaust
More civic!
I’m with Jimmy. Stop hammering the poor car
Turbo kswap
2:42 Spoon makes parts for honda you said? i own a 5th gen prelude but they dont make parts for the prelude. Should i use the parts of the integra/civic? i mean i dont want to spend a lot of money on something that doesnt fit :)
Civic gets a vasectomy
Good series.
EBAYTURBOOOOO
Could've done it for much less than $5,000...
I’m excited to see this civics full transformation!
I love the car love Zack. Id love to see Big boy turbo go into and upgraded fuel injectors.
Them hammering the fenders just destroyed my heart. These boys are gonna fall apart from rust in the next year or two 😭
You bastards.  I want those ano blue spoons on my honda!
Always bench bleed a new master cylinder. They left that important part out
I will buy your honda civic 😅 cash 💸 😊
I don't like Hondas but this project kinda looks good and I can't wait to see how it ends.
K swap time
K24/20a2 Frankenstein
paint it purple
Finally building cars again ❤
I have no idea why you don't call this Money Pit.
Supercharge the civic!
spoon🩵💛 i want it!! 🩵💛🩵💛🩵
just a simple reminder... THE MIATA WHEELS YOU PUT ON THE CIVIC ARE BACKWARDS (the tyre thread goes backwards)
Those enkeis work perff with those calipers👌
I love these types of video's, never stop Zach, we love you.
8:55. Story of my life….. don’t know why just know its a thing
$5000 and you get factory rotors Seems normal
NO LS, NO K SWAP, grab a hayabusa or something that will rev to 10k as a power plant plz!!!
Can you all PLEASE do a video on "Very cool upgrades for your car" like... Fumoto valve for the oil pan and "Speed Bleeders" for your brake lines.  One makes oil changes a breeze because it's just a spigot. And the other one is a one way check valve so you can solo bleed brake lines!
This little Civic absolutely needs the K20 treatment
B20 swap it 😅
when oh hav you used that 2jz u built
Shoulda used Dot 5.1 fluid if you plan on tracking it.
Next time, intake and exhaust system upgrade, some good oil change and spark plugs. Should be cheap but give a good fun boost.  Love the show. Zach is a great host!
Special thanks the editor made the flow of watching easy to maintain while getting a quick tutorial who ever did today episode you rock man I see your skill!
so just buy a 2000 Honda S2000 - 105,845 mi - $12,995 vs wast money on a car that was never made to go fast.
1:28 song name? It's too good.
New money pit series, very nice! Can't wait to see the full transformation of this civic
Good to see Zach back on the show
I’ll buy that civic off of y’all for $500 minus the brakes
Put the k series engine that you built into the homda
11:06 Zach is turning into Jeremy Clarkson
why drilled rotors in the rear?
before and after????
You cant find these civics amywhere running for 500..i call bullshit
Put in a twin turbo in that baby 😎
Kinda feels like an unofficial money pit series and I think a lot of people have been waiting for this style of content again
Kinda feels like an unofficial money pit series and I think a lot of people have been waiting for this style of content again
Kinda feels like an unofficial money pit series and I think a lot of people have been waiting for this style of content again
drum break are actually capable of a much higher breaking force just really bad heat dissipation.
I want to see what $5000 door handles will do to the Civic :p
Things fix themselves all the time is 90% of IT. The other 10% is restarting.
wait so why did he put the wheel spacer behind the rotor?? thats a new one for me
Netto yo, GT28RS?
K swap aye
yall gatta swap that k20 into that civic
very cool car ;)
yall definitely gonna do an engine swap
I’m surprised you don’t have a brake bleeder tool for as often as you guys do brakes.
I Love it!
This is how you make a racecar.  No point in spending a lot of money on the purchase of the car when you're just gonna replace everything anyway.
K20 FTW!!
B series swap
I can smell this video…
This civic's videos ARE THE BEST.
K series anyone?
You guys should do a B series swap that would pretty cool!
Those headrests are dope! 8:42
Annoyed they messed with the Miata
Why does that 500$ car look good 🥲
❤❤❤❤❤I think will be nice to se a B Series All motor on this thing, there is a lot of K series turbo out there already. Nice video! Love the show!
Was that supposed to be a racing line?  Looked like my Aunt Sally coming around a curve
10:13 is such a funny 2 second clip *spins tires* Heheehehehehe
K swap AWD
omg it's coming niiiiiiiiice that civic maybe the next stew could be tires, that also could include new fenders but tires improve sooo much!
k swap incoming
False, drum brakes work fine, just as good as conventional brakes. And they are also still commonplace and can be found on brand new high end vehicles.
Pretty amusing the rears are slotted and drilled with stock style calipers and the fronts are just flat stock rotors with fancy calipers.
Spent $5,000 on new brakes but couldn’t get a proper brake bleeder setup?
You should had done the trail arm bushing while you were there blocks makes some solid ones and that make the car handle and feel a lot better
Do you have a name for this series yet ? How about lipstick on a pig or something love the civic 😍
Nobody going to mention the universal spacers? Hellooooo new steering wheel vibration
Power adder: ditch the non vtec sohc and K swap with CRV 2.4L bottom end, 2.0L rsx s cyl head and a tune
Do a B18
Careful, next thing she'll be sprayed black, green neons with Jimmy armed with a crossbow/harpoon in the passenger seat...
It would be dun if they Made it a kanjo build or make it kanjo style
You guys should do Hi/Low on a budget car like the civic
Nice
Can't wait till they drop a Spoon engine from Hector.
Bro I would die from laughter if they like engine swaped it with like a 2JZ or something😂
Spoonie Boyz... 🌞
Do a motor swap from a 2004 Si hatchback or from the same gen Si?
More Civic content 🎉
Do an engine swap on that thing😎
Please do more content for this civic im a civic user from malaysia love your content🥹🥹🫡
This is what we want, give us more. 😭
Next mod should should be a fully billet k20a swap and 62mm turbo kit from Precision
That's such a sexy looking Seiko
We put $500 brakes on our $5000 Civic*
Turbo
Zach seems less happy in this video. Everything ok man?
Let's see the upgrades!
I don't know how you missed the opportunity to say "please hammer don't hurt im!"
i just feel happy watching Jobe being happy
I would've done a 4 to 5 lug nut conversions. Great videos though! that EG is getting there!
Yeet
And it was still a peice of shit even after fancy expensive brakes
HoNDA BABY
Better tires
honestly, really excited if this is a new money pit. this could be very entertaining
My first car in gt3 was rhe spoon acura Integra gsr was a beast
My 2010 Aveo had drum brakes in the back. I was surprised. I thought drums left with the 90s.
Was it mentioned what kind of brake fluid went into those hoses? DOT 3, 3 Performance or maybe 4?
NYC STATIC TSX YOUTUBER  @k.saucy_ vlogs @k.saucy_ vlogs @k.saucy_ vlogs @k.saucy_ vlogs @k.saucy_ vlogs @k.saucy_ vlogs @k.saucy_ vlogs @k.saucy_ vlogs
YAY MORE CIVIC VIDEOS
Fact check ✔️ ....... The rear disc setup is actually HEAVIER than the rear drums! Back in the day you'd see drag race Integras running rear drum brakes from an EG civics strictly to save weight...
If your brakes lock your tires up then they work fine your tires and suspension should be bigger priority,
Drums are actually better at braking  because they have a much larger contact area. They're worse because they overheat really quickly. For sedate shopping trips, drums are actually better. For anything else, disks are best. If you're gonna fit bigger, more powerful, brakes, grippier tyres are a must, or you're just gonna lock up, or kick in the ABS every time you brake.
I love this series
If they k swap I'll be mad, let's see a bare bones boosted single cam. As cheap as possible
Do a Chevy Nomad Build
bruh, i'd drive that civic just like with RPf1s as my daily hahahha
Can’t wait for that K-Swap to come
engine swap with an SI or with a type R
My Datsun 510 has stock brakes and stops from 60mph in less than 70 feet, and it has never gotten brake fade no matter how hard I drive it.
I just bought a ‘96 accord for $300 and an kind of doing the same thing upgrading it until its a bad ass ride
Why not used aftermarket discs too? Might as well go the whole way.
Vtec for mo Power?
The show is entertaining. I wish they did a comparison like how they did in the suspension episode
Problem is when you go to sell the car, you’ll have guys offering $1000 shipped to their door. 😂
Should do a K24 swap with ITBs and full exhaust
K20 swap it
Maybe I missed a video that explains it, but... How the hell did you get a car for 5 hundred?
How long till the civic gets AWD and a laptop?
The video nobody wanted but was curious about
Let’s call this what it is; Money Pit 2.0 let’s bring the logo back!!
The concept of bedding the brakes is new to me. I have always thought when getting a new car/brakes you should go easy on the brakes.
Well... It is a Honda. So in my opinion, a upgrade without a turbo would be a great choice. Better fuel injection, ITB's, and lighter flywheel can handle the job pretty easily.
This makes me want a civic now lol
Better Brakes without better tires is pointless.
Mo' powah bebe
Buy my H23 for $50+shipping and build it up for Mo’ POWA Baby!
Is this the new money pit?
Its just infuriating how easy each bolt comes loose  No struggle with rust whatsoever
don't boil your brake fluid!
I'd take an EG on RPF1s every single day!!!
i hope they just toss a huge turbo on it blow it up, then k swap it. Rods through blocks never get old lol..
Now this is one way to destroy your brakes 5 minutes after installing them 🤣🤣🤣
500 I don't think so.
Hi Zack
American prices for car parts are retarded. A set of decent Brembo's (4 discs and pads) will cost about € 600 including tax and manhours.
You guys should do a build series kind of like Hi Low, only high car would be a top trim like a focus RS or civic type R, and low car is a lower base trim, then the price difference between the cars, is the budget to try and get the lower trim to out preform the top trim. We could see if “built not bought” is better…and the plus side is, you would only have to modify one car, so half the chance of replacing 176 motors like last time
D16y8 turbo or a J30 swap
11% better
It looks like things have changed a bit at Donut.  Looks like there are some people missing and some new people around.
500$ civic (+ an integra for all the parts)
I feel a K-swap coming
More powa❤baby
Honestly, I’d keep it pure and do a B swap, b20 long bottom end and vtec on top, alittle internal work if your trying to get alittle Spicy, and if you really do go with a bang vortex supercharger or your classic forced induction! ❤
I'm thinking for 5k they could have pretreated the rotors with brake pad material and still been able to make a profit
Ty to jest civic?!
Ctr swap , mini me head swap or boost ?
Is this interchangeable with an off the shelf Nissin part without the a special Spoon logo?
Dont alot of semi trucks use drum brakes? they last longer bro.
go big or go home. LS SWAP NOW!
Get a hold of Hector and get a spoon engine
I’ve been waiting for YEARS to become Honda guys. This is so cool
I love this little Civic! Genuinely fun to watch and learn a thing or two. Back in my undergrad days I wanted one of these big time, but even the base model was a bit beyond my budget. If I recall right, it didn't even come with A/C. You needed to bump up to an EX for that. I opted for a '92 Sentra XE instead, which came pretty nicely equipped and was even slightly cheaper than the base Civic!
"They work okay...." "...but they're not very good at braking."
Eat your heart out Hi Car.
Mo powa
Should have made Jimmy do everything, and title the series Jimmy's first car.
oh, they actually do mechanical stuff, neat!
You need an aluminum bay for rolling fenders no more hammers lol
2 stage turbo, power through the whole band
Tesla brake upgrade
bring back the donut license plate frame pls, also i love you
YOU DID WHAT
Spoon parts? Next, you need a Motec system exhaust! ;)
Ey donut. Civics can make 1000 + hursepurrs😂
Wider tires stops the car better, just saying, because you have a wider track path
won't be a next time
Go drive it and tell us how it drives
Hey, my brother's old ford explorer that he gave me had a check engine and that fixed itself as soon a s we brought it in for inspection.   "It just works👌"
once the brakes lock up its all about how good of a tire you have at that point.
Ecu for the next upgrade? Tune whats already there for optimal performance, and then just adjust the tuning as the engine is modified further.
What silly wast money if had huge horsepower then be ok
Love this series with the budget cars
Findlay hats collab?
Did you prime the master cylinder before putting it on?!
Would love to see him do this on the same car from the rust belt 😂
Those wheels better stay on ! The fitment is dam good !
We've already seen a lot of turbo builds on this channel, I really hope you guys want to supercharge the civic. That would be based as hell ngl.
soon this civic gonna be Donut's time attack car?
And now comes the money pit part...adding power to a turd of an engine. I smell an engine swap coming! 👃👃👃
I miss the bigger brake booster!
You could’ve  just swap the spindle over. Trailing arm the same. That’s what I did when I swap for rear calipers
money pit but no exterior changes, sleeper civic series
mo power and racing seats next
That civic ended up looking like the one from that video of thatdudeinblue
Ye
You need a brake proportioning valve. Your fronts lock up way before the rears
HatchAttack!🏁 EG MASTER RACE
Love the Teal Mobile!
can t wait to k20a swap 🥰🥰
I can't wait until they put that K-series in this rig.
PSA everyone. Bigger brakes won't help you stop faster (unless the oem are absolutely 💩) If you can lock the tires/activate abs, then the tire's grip are the limiting factor in terms of stopping distance.
10:13 that little burnout was enough for the local Sheriff to tow my car. Excuse? “Exhibition of Speed”. ACAB FTP
Ima guess y’all are about to do a K-swap. I WANT to doubt you guys would turbo the stock engine but we all know y’all better than that. Ima say y’all are planning K swap because of the K swapped hatch in the Civic videos you guys did.
Is bedding the brakes necessary if you only change out the pads?
need some brake kit spoon sell the kit? imma buy it.
Supercharger
basic bolt ons are next.  I cant imagine Zak jumping straight to a turbski
Bring back the Mo Powa Babeh shirts!
Naaah guys you want steel breaks, not aluminium, they have a much higher heat capacity
B18c
How to spoon: D*** hard on the butt, t**** in my hand, kiss ya neck, hell yeah
Cant wait for that k24 with a turbo
Next video is going to be something wild
Drop a turbo V6 in it.
Should've done a brake test before & after to show the difference in stopping power 😢
I'd love to see a turbo single cam build! Then when the motor blows go b series lol
einfach für das geld nen alten 3er holen😂
Glad to be here for a Honda money pit. The dream!
Hi lo series with 2 civic SI’s
The obvious move would be to do a k swap, then a turbo kit. You guys tend to be less predictable than that though. So maybe D series turbo kit with water meth injection 🤔👀😂🤣. It wouldn't be the first time you guys surprised me.
I vote a B16A2 swap
I need a clip really bad of just the exchange:  "It's going to be ok."  "Is it?" "I don't know."
I need to know where you found the car. I'm looking for a cheap manual car. People keep telling me I hate stick because all I know is the one from the Fox Mustang, which is apparently not good(?), so I'm looking for something better.
kswap,e85,spinny boy.
Y'all need to money pit the Honda!  DO IT!
I want add all this to my Civic 🥲
What are we doing? K20? K24? B18? B20 VTEC? H22? Check out my Euro R CB7 Accord :-)
K20 and or turbo
I wanna see a K swap on this, or maybe an ls4 swap👀
Miss the money pit intro, still top notch content
Shabo
THAT K20A!
Zach is Back!
Why the fancy rotors on the back & not the front also?
Since you're going ground up there must be some weight reducing
H2b swap it  h22 with B series trans it will rip
So glad to hear a bigger name say what so many people need to learn...that big brakes aren't about stopping faster...it's about stopping/slowing down over and over again for longer.
Just don't stop the upgrades. I want see you do some lap times, let's goooooo
Should have done the Porsche 986 brakes
Can I please have your miata
Please wash that dirty ass car, ya got bird shat on the side for pete sakes
K series= More power   Ik where y’all going with this
please detail it please detail it please detail it. ORIGINAL PAINT. You gotta keep the sleeper vibe i'm getting from this.
I had a lift in a Golf III 120km/h outside town with brakes needing the handbrake to compete with the forbidden high speed. I took another lift on the way back.
JV6 SWAP THAT BEACH!
The civic already starting to look good
Make the civic a new track project car with episodes
Dang with the fancy roll center ball joints too 😮😮😂
Next episode...K Series swap?! One can dream.
Donut media hmmmm. Why do I get addicted to watching every video that you guys put out and I’m talking every stinking video! Thank you guys for all that you do for the small car slash big car enthusiasts jobe for president!!!!
Brake upgrade would be much better if ABS worked
Donut media hmmmm. Why do I get addicted to watching every video that you guys put out and I’m talking every stinking video! Thank you guys for all that you do for the small car slash big car enthusiasts jobe for president!!!!
Why’d you got with drilled rotors in the rear?
Or why not have a canyon cruise with the community in the civic ?
Would love to see a turbo.
Canyon run the civic !
Do an Ohio car special
Soooo we’re not going to talk about drilled and slotted rotors in the rear and plain rotors in the front on a FWD car? 😂
Damn must be nice to be able to spend 5k on brakes and there are some ppl out  here that can't even pay rent God bless amaerica 😂....
Me when someones hurting a car 7:41
Make the interior donut-ish, kinda like the door cards on low car!!! PLZ i wants to see that!!
It`s time for a mo powa baby
keep on keepin on. love this shit!
Who needs brakes anyways
Is there a reason for not using slotted/drilled rotors on the front? Seems like you would want better heat management for track use.
This civic gonna cost 80k when they done modding 😂
I want this car the way it is… it’s perfect.
I smell.... I smell the glorious smell of  brake dust.....
8:14 also dads every morning
If donut decided to just make Zach working on cars their only focus I wouldn't even be mad
7:39: “Akira!”
The guy who sold you those is awesome.
'We put $15,000 of turbo parts on our $500 Civic'
seats, you need better front seats to hold you tight. some yellow Recaro's to match the brake pads would look killer  😋
He looks like the dude who kidnaps the kids in the 3 Ninjas movie from the 90’s
My first car was a 99 Civic, I still miss that car
Obviously it's gonna be a k-swap in the future.
I’m just really happy they’re working on a Civic 🥹
The episode title should be "we swapped an integra on our civic"
Little civic just keeps getting better
I actually machine those steering knuckles, but for subaru. Nice to see them fully explain and in motion. Esp how to work around it. We have a lot of problems with positioning, mostly due to the actual casting suppliers in Korea. They allow up to 1mm of variation. It totally throws our machines off. And we pay for it if subaru receives a no go piece. Absolutely our shop got set up. I'd go with toyota. Those parts were very streamlined and almost guaranteed to be fine after machining.
We know that build motor from the previous video is going in that bitch , can't wait!
You already know whats next, air intake and exhaust hahahaha. Then k20 swap that little EG, get those 10k revs!
Why not front  slotted  holed like the rears  vs basic  no holed fronts?
You should make it a drift build
I cant wait for the 1k hp k series engine to be installed
I'm sure they're gonna put the K20A in it next video !😍🔥
love this lil series
6:27 i would think now that you have disks instead of drums you would want less power going to the rear brakes since they are so much better and more efficient at stopping.
I wished you could have done a before and after test of the breaks and the affect of bedding them, would have been cool to see the difference. And also mention the difference in boiling point of the breaking fluid and how that contributes to break fade! Love the series :)
K swap. I think that’s what the easiest way to power is. XD
the most amazing part of this video is how easy it was to work on a $500 car.
One side note. Bed the brakes based on the manufacturer's recommended process.
so... its time for the cardinal sin of car guys... time to swap a chevy small block into a honda!
Do a mini me build.
Now it's worth $1000 with $10000 brake and suspension upgrades
Y U no spoon in the back?
Couldn't you have done the old baseball bat trick to roll the fenders?   Install wheels then roll the car with a pipe/bat/rod/whatever between the tire and fender so the lip folds in.
But guys….        Don’t forget that Hector’s going to be running 3 Honda Civics with spoon engines.  And on top of that, he just went into Harry’s and he ordered 3 T66 turbos with NOS.  And a Motec exhaust.
3:00 another major factor of less heat is the fact that they dont have to work as hard to stop the car, for various reasons.
a money pit with mitshubishi evo 7 or 8 or 9 pleaseee
I'm with Jimmy, just get tires that fit, don't F up that clean/vintage sheet metal.
Youre either putting a k series or a b series in it.
Is this undercover money pit?
You guys going to do a body kit or keep it like a sleeper build
Man Zach Jobe could run this channel by himself. And I'd be ok with it. Every time you have him on screen that ends up being the best content you make.
You're also going to notice the other cars honking at the jackass slamming on the breaks in the middle of the street.
I'm really enjoying this video series.  My Civic was stolen and ripped apart for parts. They even took the front half of the engine. It may have been a hail beaten purple monster, but it was fun to drive compared to many cars. I'm sad I won't get to drive it till it's end.
the sticky tires are making a bigger difference guys...
It would be super cool if they don't do a turbo and do a super charger or a procharger! Turbos are too standard.
This should become another money pit
I ❤ donut
I love this build! Miss my Hondas I recently picked up a clean 5 speed 00 accord not the best lookin Honda but can’t wait to blow the stock motor so I have a reason to swap it and build this thing
Here's a fact about hondas or any cars if u aggressively pump the pedal or go all the way down  you can damage the seal inside the master cylinder
I really hope they k20 swap it or something!!! Would be sick.
Car noob question. Do you always have to bed new brakes regardless of type and car? Wondering if this is why my relatively new brakes feel a bit wonky already
Roots supercharger please love the sound of them plus I think it would sound so dope on a civic
Because race car.
0:15 sweet bmw on the style 5
Why is the saturation ridiculously high in this video?
this channel has single handedly given me more information about cars than any drivers ed class
These are the kind of videos I miss from Donut. Keep em coming!!
Now find as many carbon Fibre body parts you can get for $5000 and this will be a savage build
So after the K swap can you raffle this off for me?  Also if you change the color I will be very disappointed.
This video highlights why Hondas are so popular to work on.
Honda fit at @2:41. Wen donut fit??
Did he just throw a wheel spacers behind the brake rotor? 🤣😂
Zach wouldn’t it be better to go with both front & rear spoon brakes or both front and rear drilled and slotted. Instead of two different type of rotors ?
I thought someone was actually pulling out in front of you lol
K20!
@0:28 That's not where antisieze goes.
Why do the roads in the USA look like they’re made front sticky tape and cardboard
This is a donut car yes it makes it a 5500$ car lol
Supercharger everyone always does turbos
Oh i cant wait for yall to turbo that bitch. Its gonna be a lil monster!!!
I love this in the uk you'll be lucky to find a old shape civic thats not rotten like a peach the ones that arnt are £5-10k min. Knuckel or hub assembly as honda call it and most technicians 😊
j swap, wattttt 😳
Beautiful civic love the series
Swapping a b18c would be insane  I want more and more and more of this it is addictive hahaha
PSA DO NOT rely on a proportioning valve to correct your poor brake specing. Desired braking force/split should be calculated beforehand and achieved with piston area. Proportioning valve is strictly for tuning after that is achieved.
b16 swap next😂
Electric turbo
K SWAP COMING NEXT!?!?
love this series
man .... we messed u
K swapppp
K swap the eg or do a mini me swap
First upgrade the d16 with a turbo. 400+hp then explode engine and fit a h22 but upgraded with sleeve and forge pistons. Make 1000+hp
Comment
Sleeper civic build 👀👀?
poor Miat :(
Civic are so easy to work on, that is so satisfying
500 bucks for a eg hatch HOW?!? Here In the uk they have now been commanding sometimes £2k+ in stock form. God i miss my ek coupe 😢
Please go big boy money pit and do an awd turbo K build on this and keep the RPFs on this as is.
I think you should run a full spoon engine a t66 turbo, nos, and a motec exhaust system.
I feel bad for Jimmy that he had to see the torture of the civic getting smashed by a hammer
5k and the front rotors aren't even cross drilled or sotted?
Finally!
Should of shown attaching the brake lines and go more in detail
there's a turbo, there's a k20 swap, there's a turbo k20 swap
Wish it was more of a step by step how to.
Living out my 16 year old selfs dream. Still cool.
The best part about a brake upgrade like this is how easy it makes changing the pads.  You can swap road pads with tracks pads in no time, making track days a breeze.
Tbh any build they do is so fun to watch! And whoever edited the sounds and music this vid is amazing
If you arnt throwing a k series in there I'm unsubscribing... not really but you get the point
This type of series is the best
Air intake, new fuel injectors, spark plugs and a tune.
What are the specs on the wheels
turbo
New money pit makes me wanna clap out a honda now...
How to kill new brakes, instruction from Donuts
Drum brakes do actually work very well. Just not ideal for racing because of the lack of heat dissipation. You can find many dump trucks with drums all the way around because with drums you get a much larger contact area with the shoes that are almost always bigger than disk brake pads.
can you guys work on a right sided driving vehicle. would be interested to know if there are any differences or how it feels driving something we in america are not used to
Steez over function every time
I always liked to believe that Zack drove the Miata My life is a lie
Lambo doors for more power
So money pit?!?
K swap please!
Please do a K20 swap!!
So many better cheap cars that would be better with expensive parts.
Next you guys should just dump like 10k on drivetrain stuff👍
not enough Zack lately
I love these kinds of videos. It's like the old money pit videos. Glad to see a return to the old format.
This videos timing is spot on! I wanted to do a larger brake upgrade (including a drum to disk conversion), so this is soo helpful!!
I love this. Money pit vibes right here
Is this money pit???
K24 swap. Cool.
So glad you used spoon parts
What a machineeee
This just proves that the integra is like the ultimate form of a civic.   Best car ever made, the integra.
From this I learned. Start with an integra cause it has a lot of the upgrades your gonna want in your civic already lol
Yo!  Whats the word on the RB25?!
Supercharger required.
B series
Even before the ‘brake upgrade’; this car here in Los Angeles, will easily go between 3 and 4K.
Man i love the new money pit. I missed this series real bad. Thanks dudes
Zach must never leave donut. Not that i dont like Nolan, James, and Justin but i feel that when you really want to learn and gain knowledge on parts/installation. Zach and Jeremiah are the ones to go. Love watching these little low budget cars get turned into track ready cars.
Happy Transformers Fridayyyy !!!!!!
Turbo it. Blow the stock motor, then k swap it
Got one with rotten floor for 800$ Putting 5k brakes sounds insane😮
Ya'll shouold just call this series, "Mega Money Pit" since it's basically just Money Pit but with extra steps (AKA higher dollar amounts).
why does that civic look elite what year and make is it
This build series is pointless without a MoTeC system exhaust.
Did I miss the brake rotor cleaning?
just upload the new video tomorrow. release them all lol
Need canyon driving footage
plz keep slowly adding expensive parts. next upgraded vtec
Supporting the rotors on the wheel studs.  Nope, dont like that.
Almost died cause brake fade
Put a K20 turbo in 🥳
Cant beleave they missed the fast and feirous edit the the spoon motors from Brian
You need a bump steer kit to go with those Extended ball joints.  When you do 1 without the other you geometry actually gets worse.
Total left field  Supercharger/pro charger Seems like a totally different approach and Donut thing to do...
Next mod is probably better plugs or cold air intake.
K swap it you cowards!!! MOOO POWAH!!!!!
The EG market is getting so popular.....Honda might have to start producing this model again...lol
I wonder how long can we keep calling it a 500$ Civic. How many parts need to be swapped to change the value?
here comes the k20
Finally Zach is back from the diarrhea
Money pit or not, who knows imma still watch ❤
Spoon swap the engine
2jz swap? Lol
Next episode: engine swap
Put an Sti motor in it lol
165 k views in 3 hours you guys are finally coming back!Felt so terrible when viewer counts fell off a little you guys deserve to keep growing .
Dem Upgrades!
B series?
K swap for sure !.. also wondering what happened to having '' shows '' instead of just " random posts '' better for the algorithm somehow ?
Instead of a turbo could you guys do an na build instead with cams and itbs it would sound awesome and be super fun
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running three Honda civics with spoon engines, and on top of that, he just went into Harry’s and bought three t66 turbos with nos, and a motec exhaust system.
wish list for this car: 1. interiorweight reduction, interior safety increase like cage and seat, ALONG with power adds like Stage 1->2 air and fuel.  2. Fuel tank delete / Fuel cell add. Then all the engine love parts like rods, pistons, bearings, cam upgrade, injectors (with that fuel system upgrade)  3. at this point i'd like to see a turbo and upgraded drive axles along with dash delete / holly kit
I heard you won't j swap it 👀
You should put a 50000 dollar engine in a 500 dollar civic
K20 swap
Wouldn’t u wanna do this on a back road and not on main roads and potentially get rear ended😂😂
Love this civic build.
SELF CLERANCE
Couldnt it be a problem to change from drums to discs that there is valve that holds pressure for the drums? Thats what learned by working on really old cars, that there is often a problem on disc conversions - but I only worked on cars that had no proportioning valve, only the brakemaster and t-pieces
when is the K20 swap coming
K swap? Is it a K swap? Maybe one of them juicy hybrid builds with TSX block and the head from the Civic type R?
Mo Powaaaa BABY!!!
keep this up and your civic might be worth 3500 in the end!
Have a 98 Civic DX that was my first car sitting at 65k miles. Great first car to practice DIY repairs on
😂😂😂😂 why!!! That car doesn't possess nowhere near the power for brakes like that!! Total waste of money!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
That weird caliper not releasing issue could have been a pinched hose
Are $5,000 dollar brakes worth it?....No :)
Prob my fav current series on donut right now, keep these videos coming!
Im wondering why if you're spending 5k on brakes opt for a 4  instead of 5 lug conversion. There were plenty of options i feel for the conversion and not that expensive in comparison.
Pure love for this kind of videos!
Needs some i-VTEC, babeeee!
LS swap it please !!!!! 6.0 🫣🫣🫣🫣
Dohc vtec of the highest order, b18 if not k20… on the tightest budget
Finally a working on a car video
Now put a vtac in it. Just consult with johnnyricer if you need assistance.  What yall know about that?
K swap this bad boy lmao
11:41 tune sounds like besch1er - no limits 🙂
10x the cost on the brakes, tuner economics babyy!!
SUPERCHARGE THE CIVIC, YOU FREAKING WONT CAUSE YOURE SCARED OF POWER
what is that wheel and tire setup?
Please keep it true to the era, and B-Swap it!
Crazy to transfer parts from an integra to a basic civic lol
I saw one of those with no engine selling for $1000. How do people find cars so cheap?
7:40 “the noises the fucking nooses”
Put a v8 in it
That little EG is ready for a K24!
Do an episode on whether stock/factory disc and pads are more effective than drum and shoe. I’ve been told by numerous oldies than drum and shoe will always be better because you have more “braking surface” with the shoes than pads. But I’d like to see an actual test between the two.
Jeez heat gun and baseball bat to roll the fenders guys.
I think you have a pretty cool rebuilt Honda engine lying around... 😮
Jobe is back
Good Video, learned how bedding the brakes.  Good to know@  thanks
Would have been neat if they did some the the CRV big brake kit tricks instead of the Spoon. Like normal people without 5k to spend. lol But can't wait. Just don't k swap it please!
They are gonna do a k swap, no doubt in my mind. The question is turbo, no turbo, or superchrger?
you can get spoon mono and twin blocks for less than 5k. straight from spoon the calipers are only 1200
civic may be basic but god is it fun to watch.
swap a b18c5 into it don’t go k🥲
Waiting on the turbo k swap
Civic and Spoon... is your second name Hector?
Hopefully they add a supercharger instead of a turbo
Please make a video on BMWs design downfall
I assume the more power video is probably gonna be a K-swap
Why  change the description from 5k brakes to 4k
Now doing the interior like racing seats, steering wheel and speedometer 😂
Love him rocking the seiko gmt looks amazing bro
GREAT SERIES
@Donut, if ya'll are interested and looking for more civics, I'm looking to sell my 2001 Honda Civic 4 door sedan for under $900. Even if you just used it for parts it'd be nice to know it's in good hands!
Shit turbo it before you build it so you can do a tear down and see what failed
VTEC SWAP!! 12:05
H22❤❤ Pleaseeeee❤❤❤
K swap?
Sticky tyres
Slap on a header, intake, clutch flywheel combo, exhaust, tune. That k will already be beast af. Great job dudes! 👏
spacer behind the brake disk?
Money pit? 🤔
Why is there not a playlist for this car? Project Civic could be called!
Did you really put a wheel spacer behind the front rotor? Bad things will happen.
Any $500 Civic in my area has some serious weight reduction included, and could never pass inspection.
I am begging you guys to put a sick livery on this thing once it's done, seriously this project is so cool it would be such a shame to just have 1 boring colour on it after all the work
This civic is gonna be crazy
They apparently had a donor Integra, so I'd guess the new motor will be from that.
Could be a bad brakeline/hose keeping the pressure. Or just schmuts in the line. :P
7:44 it’s okay every lowered Honda has this done to it 😂
wild you found a car for $500 cant even get a shitbox for much less than 5k unless its not even running
Yall should put an $8000 engine in this $500 civic.
YESS!! Ive been waiting for the next civic video
Better question who buys 5k brakes that still use 1 piece rotors.
When i had a 93 Del Sol Si, i had to find out how bad bad was only to find my front rotors burned. Dark blue front, black in the rear. The pads were fractured. Ever since brake upgrade is priority one on those cars.  I'm curious, with how weak and prone to bending the oem rear camber and toe arms are, why haven't you upgraded them?
"Does it run?"  "Most of the time.  ... but it stops really good."
Its only right to put a spoon engine in it
we need more honda cars here
Would have been nice to get a lap time from standard to now to see how much performance and handling you've gained. I'd like to take it for a lap before you add any power so we can see how much time you're gaining (or losing).
Me omw to put massive brakes on my car only to be bottle necked by my bald worn out tires.
Finally
👍👍
Cool! Now k swap it
Here's an idea: High Low Honda Edition  Low: Junkyard/eBay/Marketplace used OEM upgraded parts vs High: Brand new Skunk2/Ktuned/DC etc. "high end" parts  Honestly wouldn't be THAT expensive overall. Probably about 1 subie's worth of $$$. See which one drives/tracks better.
yall need to put on some rice on it one day
I would love to see y’all do another Gambler 500!
K swap with Fueltech for MO POWA
Im honestly kinda suprised $5000 brakes dont come with drilled or slotted rotors in the front.
100% I hate doing ball joints.
What do you recommend for a Subaru
B16 swap
No problem with an ex
this is just a nerdier version of putting 24 inch rims on a $500 car lol
Why are the fronts not slotted? Wouldn't thr front get more hot or is it cause the front gets more air compared to rear?
I drink 100 dollar scotch and pair it with hotdogs
Unfair comparison, shitty tires vs if I remember correctly track tires.
I wonder if they're gonna do a giveaway for this car.  I would want a sleeper honda ❤
ls swap it
so $5,000 on brakes alone.........no slotted rotors even.......why?
b20 swap
tyres will be the weak point
Buddy's get eyes bluer than the ocean
Prolly Ls7 or 2jz next just guessing though don't wanna do that k thing everybody else is doing. Dare to be different.
Nooooo do it know! More powah babe
4.90 final drive is what should be done to this car and a bunch of transmission part upgrades lsd clutch awd conversion ect then go all out on the engine b or k swap internal upgrade pistons rods forged crank cams springs retainers nitrous supercharged cause we seen a lot of turbo stuff from your builds and hit the drag track not the canyons goal is 10s or better lol LETS GET IT ZACH!! Tell jimmy to quit crying this is gonna be a race car not a show car!
Science Garage and Money Pit must returnnnn
Donut, You guys are just amazing and never fail to make my day better everyday and I have been watching since the start of the channel here such as hi lo: Subies, 350Z's and Tacomas and tool party and all the other ones.
I had performance brakes on my accord when I bought it. The wheels locked up easily because the tires couldn't keep up with the power of the brakes. The only accident I've ever been in. Long story short... Don't forget the tires.
Bruh my 2 cars I have aren't even worth 5k 💀
Seems like a waste of money to me.
You need to put a h22 in that car
What is the reason of this video?
More of these videos!
2JZ swap??
Track test before mo’ powa baby!
lol donut thinking spoon monoblocks are $5000. y'all have really gone downhill on actual car stuff.
Looks like those front wheels are about to fall off at 11:40.  I wouldn't personally put money into that bucket.
imagine stealing some shitty 500$ honda and finding out it's got 10k worth suspension and brakes installed
Bro has brakes more expensive than the whole car times 10 .  Bros Making a ultimate sleeper car
Thanks. I never heard of bedding. Just did all four corners on my Geo Metro. Now when Bambi jumps out in front of me........
500$ civic. Just cali vibes all over.
Wow spoon callipers cost 5k? Everything else being stock parts that's stupid money. But it's definitely good to see people do upgrade their brakes, with all these channels chasing power there's little focus on brakes etc
Why drilled and slotted rotors on the rear but not the front?
How they found the only civic that still has the head liner I'll never know
do a 1.9 tdi swap
Cannot wait to see what this junker turns into  Hopefully they turn it into a show stopper
Can't believe they didn't make a reference to 3 Honda Civics with Spoon engines.
Random question but what type or battery are you running? Xc6 or the Hd12?
Who else remembers spoon being orange and black?
swap the 2jz into the civic
just make a money pit out of this
can you clean the car?
Please supercharge it
Engine swap asap lol 😂
grabbing parts from one project for another project...  it is painful to watch...
K-swap for sure for sure. Mo powa baybay!
Love this series I miss my civic hatchback can’t wait for the power upgrade ❤❤🎉
MONEY PIT!!!
I would take this beautiful pig over high Z. And that’s even BEFORE the K Swap.
Can we talk about how the fitment with the Enkeis and Toyos was literally perfect and totally transformed the look of the car!
please keep pimping out your civic, helps me decide on potential upgrades for my 97 haha
Can you give me a quick rundown on how to bleed breaks please. Replacing brakes on my pug so may have to do the same
I'm a straight male, but damn, those eyes at 6:01
Which size tires did you fit?
GSR turbo make an easy 10 second car. Bc for those 10 seconds I’m free!!!
This thing is already looking sooo good
upgrading the brakes and suspension was always the first thing i do while playing Gran Turismo 4 lol
thats a nice watch to be working on that car
Man that is my absolute favorite model of civic! Takes me back to high-school! Thanks for the trip down memory lane guys!
Finally a civic finally
Jobe is running a full set of spoon brakes... I had to find out I just can't lose race wars
where on earth did you get a $500 civic
Can someone sponsor me a car work on like these 😢??
$500 civic, $5k brakes, $50k engine also rip up to speed, bumper to bumper, science garage,
K20A Powah 😏
hope they replace the  D Series Engine with a B Series
No way in hell those calipers are worth what they cost.   A set of wilwoods will do the job at a fraction of the price.
Welcome to another episode of “I can believe this isn’t Money Pit”.
Donut upload actual car videos challenge level: Possible
zack is back!
This build my little honda series is my fav
K20 w/ gsr tyranny 😂
My favorite episode of HiHi so far😊
Justin is so cool. Job is cool too.
That $500 care would be $2k at least in Ontario Canada...maybe more with a bidding war.
So the civic is worth what, $750 now??
19mm turbo!!!! Doooo it
Just switching to ceramic pads can drastically help with brake fade.
K SWAP!
Can u order some BBS wheels for the civic
Bring back the money pit intro
Poor Miata. RIP.
Now just throw a bucket seat in it and a half cage maybe a quick-release steering wheel
more power ad awd convertion
2JZ swap
Can someone explain why some brakes need to be bedded and others don't? I'm putting new brakes on a classic mustang and it says don't brake hard at first or you'll glaze the pads
This is the Donut content I most look forward to
Every video on this channel amounts to “we have too much money. Also, come buy our merch.”
Yea boyzzz the civic is starting to get interesting! I think y’all gonna swap that engine out to a K20 and go ALL-MOTOR… ain’t ya!!!???
"I put 10k in a $2000 car. It's worth 3 now"
Did you guys fix the misinfo in the electric car video yet?
Keep the wheels on the civic!
$5000 brakes and still one piece rotors? man, inflation hit you hard.
best series
Fuck need to find a civic for 500
We got what we've been crying for 😅 a new money pit series 😂
AWD swap when?
those wheels actually look pretty good!
kswap
Sooooo, why not just get an integra if you are going to replace everything with integra parts......
Next Up : FORK branded wheel axles
Zach, that was partially wrong information.  You said drum brakes don't work very well.  That's entirely false.  They work incredibly. They just are heavy and more prone to fade than disc.
V6 Supercharger Swap
Ur gonna add a turbo k24 or supercharged
i really wish i could do stuff like this, only thing stopping me is income
I feel your pain, Jimmy
So question... why not put drilled and slotted rotors up front? Why just the rear? I feel like I'd rather have it the other way around...
b swap it!
Everybody's said it already, but y'all niggas really should've made this Money Pit
@Boosted Boiz colab??? 🤔🙃
k20
You guys are working on a Honda now, especially the holy "affordable" grail [ I say that cause honda enthusiasts can't afford a nsx ] why would you out slotted rotors on the rear and not the front, that Eag is front wheel drive. You're gonna have a ton of eyes balls on these videos regarding the Honda
Does the ac work
Why wasn't this series called money pit?
I wonder if they put high temp brake fluid in
“Sometimes you take it apart put it back and its all better” story of my life
6:49 *Cannibalising
so is this a money pit or no
Beaute
Bedding in brakes on city streets with traffic is one way to do it. Personally I always end up doing it in a large parking lot after hours when it's empty. Possibly also because I often end up doing brake work in the same parking lot (stupid condo board not allowing wrenching in our lot).
Cant wait to see this Civic after few months.
"Hector is going to be running 3 Honda Civics with Spoon calipers"
With that little rust, in the rust belt where i live, that car would easily be 5000
No way thats a $500 car, maybe 15 years ago.
'just k swap it already
Yes, glad there's still progress on the car! Thought you guys had forgotten about this little Civic.
spacer behind the rotor, interesting
Had them same exact problem caliper on my 2012 civic, 3 mechanics couldn't figure out why and i shot through brakes and rotors because of it.
K20 baby
Have never bedded brakes 🔧🥸 , like debating doing now , since hasn’t been long since did brakes less few weeks
Wait. I just realised just how blue his eyes actually are. It's bluer than his shirt and the brake
If you buy a Civic for $500, and replace all the parts with better ones, is it still a $500 Civic?
It must be so nice to just have a better version of the car you’re working on to take parts off of to make your car better
this makes me miss my EG 😭
I love this type of content !!!!❤❤❤❤
I remember jobe talking to me about a civix build at postys concert backstage
Cant wait to see this thing beat a lambo
I hope they made more up to speed
please put  cheap k20 in it
One thing no one seems to mention is the large amount of homework you have to so you can pull off an upgrade like this.  The research that you must have done would just boggle most people's minds.
Engine swap or new wheels
where is the miata wrapping episode?
You guys should take HI-LO to a new level, and do New-Old.  Take an older favorite gen, or the first gen of a vehicle, and test it against the modern favorite gen, or most recent gen of that same make and model or offspring (i.e. Cavalier compared to a Cobalt).  Perfect example would be a Full Size American Truck.  Old School Square Body, compared to a newer Cateye Gen or Newer.  You could do equivelant upgrades on each, such as carburetor on one and injectors on another, forced induction, etc.
Please bring back old shows🙏
More power in a civic? Sounds like turbo time!
So they put $5000 breaks into a $500 civic. Bringing the civic’s resale value to $505. Sweet!
Where tf do you get a 500 dollar civic
that would be a perfect sleeper build with the stock rims
I wonder how difficult adding ABS would be?   Also, I try to bed in my brakes on country roads, not in town. Lol.
K20 swap
So they are using almost the same build specs as drew peacock weird
K20
Zack You need to do a car painting guide
When your car does 0-60 in under 5.4 minutes, you need good brakes.
A+ opening shot.  good job cameraman
All the people crying about money pit, just enjoy content.  There's only so far a show can go before it's stale.  Donut is great at maintaining quality.  If they are going to do another one they will have a full project set up and a full plan.
drum brakes actually have stronger braking force for their size compared to disks. the main issue they have is that they dont dissipate heat very well so you get fade quicker
Plz do more of these
B18C1.. GSR swap!
K20 swap next👀👀
Why isn't this money pit
so this is just low car to high car huh?
Is this the same Civic that got the $4,000 suspension system
Next POWAH!
Jimmy is my guy
I'd like to see this car stanced
Ka that shit
B series swap would be nice to see 😅
Just call it what it is: money pit civic 👑
I hope your gonna supercharge the honda
Did i hear K20?
Cummins swap!
Try to make it a reliable turbo build...
K swap time!!
I would be interested in knowing work hours when it come to part installation. That would cool to know how much time was spent putting the mods on.
Discs aren’t even drilled or slotted. Seems extremely expensive for $5k just to get 4 piston front brakes
For my personal fun.. can we call this series Money Pit 2? :)
So basically you just replacing this civic into integra part by part =)
the most OUTRAGEOUS part of this video is them smacking those fenders and NOT A SINGLE PEICE OF RUST coming off that car.  You lucky lucky SPOILED west coast bois.
Grear series, love seeing these old civics get the love they deserve! For power are you going to do a B18c engine swap?? That would be epic!
The civic looks so nice with those wheels
I'd love to see a supercharger over a turbo. Everyone always sticks a turbo in their car.
$5000 and not even at least slotted?
We need a an engine swap
sweet...but the Miata should not get those wheels back.
Turn this car in to a money out car
Civic: "Spoon me daddy Jobe!" 😩
But how much slower is it now with the big breaks?
Safety Glasses People!!
I smell B-series........
I’m thinking all motor k-swap or h22 swap
When you spend several months salary in your sh*t box - It ain't much, but its honest work
Put a 458 engine in it. Or an S54 BMW engine
kswap
Can’t wait for the next episode bro 😊
If anyone is doing a similar job, for the love of everything please bench bleed the master cylinder
B18c5 swap!
Yeas so happy to see civic getting more love
I wonder if labor is included in the $5000 brake job
Not a chance they picked up a running civic for 500$
Supercharge iiiiiit
I smell a KSwap😅
Yes please added in forza horizon 5 to civic eg
I am sorry but i think this is fake because alot of africans doesnt speak English and i dont think that pirates will drink gen
Take it to the track 👍👍👍
JIMMY!!! YAAAAAAAAAAY!!!! Poor Jimmy
These episodes are always my favorite, where its just some dude wrenchin on a car
Please make more videos with the civic!!!!!
The fitment on those Enkeis is so choice. 🧑‍🍳🤌✨
I'd have replaced the wheel bearings, too. Had to do it on my Mazda recently, and holy crap dudes, it makes a difference.
The chop shop that gets their hand on that car will be smiling to the bank😂😂
LS swap the civic.
drums are still use a lot today on lower end cars.
swap next?😏
solid disks in front?  and drilleds back? wtf yeah it makes no sense...
Hope to see a turbo kit on this eg soon!
Broo  Great video, I love this channel!! I once had a del sol and I loved it very much it is the only car I miss
LS Swap?
To be perfectly honest, the breaking system is probably the most important component of a vehicle.
I gotta say, I've never heard of SPOON breaks.
This gives me original money pit vibes, but just on a more expensive level
those little civics can handle a lot, thats why I want one but my dad wont let me get a japanese car
Please oh please let there be a K swap in this little guy's future 😁
Those are some small drum brakes, my older truck must have easily twice the diameter. doing a disk brake conversion soon I think it is something like 90lbs of weight savings.
That poor Integra... XD
More like $3000 brakes on a $3000 Civic, but that's not clickbaity enough
you can bet that the k20a might be put in to this civic
We need a turbo
I hope you're sourcing a B18C and hoping to hit 200 NA whp!!
Lets make this civic best in the world 😎🤙.. cant wait for change the rims maybe (spoon/regamaster evo) 😎
All that stopping power is gonna tweak the frame.😂
If all else fails just use a mallet lol
Dammit, Z, you’re making it look so easy!!
Spoon engine from Japan for power
3:37 when you hear “blue and yellow” you know it’s gonna be gooood   just like Ukraine 🇺🇦 💪👊
Appreciate you did breaks first! Stopping is important
..........H swap please
stop making me want an eg, but you should b swap it
Try a used supercharge and then do a b16 or 18 swap
I feel like an engine rebuild series is coming up next in preparation for more power (turbo). Please make it happen!
I’d like them k swap this and then slowly discover how this could be the fastest car they build.
Could someone explain what I'm missing? As it appears the better disks went onto the rear.. (drilled and grooved disks, smooth on the front)
I think this series is even better than Money Pit. Sure, I'm not putting in $5000 on my upgrade, but the principle is totally doable, I'm nearly a car novice but I just upgraded my brake pads and replaced the fluid to DOT 4, upgraded the wheels and tires, and got my first track day on my 2012 Mazda 3! Was a blast, highly recommend, I just wish it was emphasized that most of this gives great results even if you're not spending multiple thousands of dollars. It's pretty satisfying to do a bit of work and feel the difference driving around!
Waiting for that K20 to be put in this...
throw a twin turbo 2JZ in it. you guys better be doing this
Call it money pit already
idk if you've ever heard of Drew Peacock, but his Civic is almost the exact same XD Same colour green, RPF1s and a K20 swap, but with much cleaner paint and interior
The Honda Civic looks like a Toyota starlet in all the ways possible 😅
Those are not $5000 brakes, maybe $3000 at most. I just picked up a set of brand new Endless front calipers with endless rear pads for my 94 Prelude and they were about $3600
This series should be called money pit civic
its hyundai turn next?....but not the good stuff 😂😂...what about an i10 this would be fun 😂 😂
500$ my ass 😂
God damnit, now I’m scouring market place trying to find a clean civic shell as a project. My wallet is crying but I miss those 90’s Hondas. So much fun to drive and they love to be beat on.
I think this is gonna be a fun series to watch.
Next time is a k swap I’m sure .
Zach Jobe's inner Ohioan really came out when he said, "blue and yellow, " and caused his body to have an allergic reaction.
Exhaust
I was wondering why Jimmy was freaking out about the fenders, then I saw they didn’t have any heat guns out
I see EG content, I smile.
omg is this the new money pit!?!?!?!?
This car screams collab with the Boosted Boiz & PFI...
if you don't put that k20 you guys built in there we riot....well at least I riot.
My wife will never understand why I want an old POS Civic over our new Accord lol
B18C5 swap please. I mean, you’re already swapping in Integra parts.
I can’t wait for the k swap engine swap episode
i miss the money pit miata
Liberty walk!
No way that was 500
I love going on lunch from the shop I work at to see a donut video hits different
😅🤣😅🤣😅It's like spending $10 million on a missile  to destroy a rusted $300 Toyota  Technical with worn out brakes, busted CV joints, peeling paint and bottoming suspension. Oh! the .50 cal operator don't even have ammo for a 3 minutes firefight.😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣
The only thing I want to see on this build is turning a non VTEC motor into one that has one. And not a swap. Actually adding the head and tapping lines etc. The hard way to get VTEC lol 🤣
About to be putting WilWood brakes on my MKIV GTI. Nothing special just wanna stop fast on track and this video just made me even more excited to get them on. Awesome job guys. 🤘
Everybody loves a good turbo set up, but, hear me out, how about an old school NA build? Maybe some nitrous
The stock caliper would not over hear if u put quality pads and fluid in it don't do this people this is stupid
Those wheels actually fit the car
Best break in is when done lightly over hundreds of miles. Ive done several miles of hard break in on my honda and even though i did it right and it stops really good. I can see that the rear never really gets bed in as good as the front.
nobody:.... lowdward: "2006 HONDA CIVIC, 2006 HONDA CIVIC"
Favorite series
Not a brakes video. Basically a car repair video
Ey can't wait for the next upgrade.
Hatchback Civic for $500? H I L A R I O U S
Could you do like just, racing headers and exhaust?
There's no way you got that car for 500.
I wonder smh what will happen if you change the rear brake drum with disc brake and keep the stock front disc brakes?
GET OUT OF MY HEAD! I was just thinking about doing something like this to my Hyundai.  Brake checking like a boss!
Turbo time?
Great job, except on your save gas video, top tier gas means high detergent not just premium. It costs pennies, keeps engine clean.
SPOON was such a legend back in the 90's. 11,000 RPM from a civic 30 years ago!! 😅
I was just thinking.... "Where's Zack and that civic?"
I hope I speak for everyone when I say I really enjoy seeing the parts where you guys struggle a little. It makes it feel a lot more real and authentic. I feel like everyone just cuts up clips to make everything seem way easier then they actually are. Love you guys keep up the great vids❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼
Eventually I'd like to see a custom gear set in the transmission for those canyon drives and a LSD
We missed Zach Jobe
Does cross drilling and slotting rotors really make a difference
This is just money pit without calling it money pit
Looks  Great !! Q&A what honda knuckle and rotor you went with the year and model civic?
U frow 18 500 dollars Civic in only 1 500 dollars Civic. And it still looks like a 500 dollars Civic😅
Had the same civic. I miss that car if I could go back to 04 I wouldn't have traded it for a prelude. Mine only had a b16 w/ a turbo but was so fun to drive.
I can’t wait for this engine to blow up I need them to K-swap this sooooo bad
How long will it take until every piece of this car has been replaced with something from an Integra?
Waiting on that B16A2 swap
What i gained from this is that if i ever get an urge to buy an eg hatch, I should just get an integra instead.
anyone else notice the blown out control arms lol 😂
man i hope you do a b18 swap for this. vtec kicked in yo!
Easy way to bed the brakes. Come and drive the steepest road. 16% grade canyon
More power you say?!?!?!?!
Zach makes authentic donut videos and I love it. Also might as well make a series about upgrading cheap cars with expensive parts
We need more frequent videos on this❤
Drop a b16 in there
We've been waiting
They didn’t find a 500 civic they already knew someone who had it
Now it looks like drewpeacocks Honda civic
Isnt this money pit?
Next is k20 swap
Thank you for the videos. I'm really digging this build 👍 I'd like to see a supercharger on that little gem.
Not just brakes but tubes and everything else …lame video
next: spoon mags sw388 🛞❤
Zach is my favourite, he's so calm and chilled. He could have his own show.
K20A swap🤪
H SWAP
Why no before and after brake test???
That was creepy Zach getting hot n bothered lol
y
Man what is it about a perfectly flush civic hatch and bbks. 😍😍
Cant wait to see what you guys do this this awesome civic hatch
It was $1500 worth of brakes until a $3500 Spoon logo
Can we do an AWD swap on the build.
LETS GOO!!!
Watanabe wheels and Michelin pilot sport tires are a must
Definitely needs a swap!! ❤😎
once they started hammering the fenders I just knew this thing was going to be a shitbox and I am 100% here for it.
He said more power next time, hopefully it’s an H2B swap, that would be sick in that car
I want this civic so bad. This is my favorite gen
New money pit car? 🤞
I deem this the honorary MoneyPit Civic 😅
I have been looking at replacing the rear drums of my 2014 fiat punto. After looking online, asking in the Punto group, and advice from the garage. I know the pros and cons of swapping  -need to replace rear suspension parts -disks aren't that much better than drums for daily driving. Unless you go performance parts, which does cost more. -drums are a pain to work on, yes. But rarely ever need a replace, if at all. -as stated, disks are better for sport and race cars. Better cooling and brake capabilities when you go double disk.  In short, for just a daily driver, you don't need disks at the rear. They barely have any wear, since the front takes the blow anyway. They don't need much air cooling, because you wouldn't be racing on track. And replacing parts always costs more than replacing the drums if needed. Disks are replaced more often than drums. I know someone in this Punto group that has driven about 350k km (about 217k miles) and his rear drums are never replaced, and still going strong.
Super charger 😂
next project -> spoon engine swap with t66 turbo
Going light weight, but super sick, swapping in a 1.5 L turbo for acceptable MPG and mo' powah, baby?
Type r killer. See how much money it takes to beat a type r around a track
200 - 230 horse power will be fun on that one fore sure!
K20a swap 🤔
Positive that K is going in
I love how this is in a way a sort of continuation of money pit, that was my favorite show here on donut
Hopefully the k20 goes in it
You guys need to make some merch with the Civic. I would gladly buy a shirt or a poster of it.
So, what did we learn from this? Yes.
Love watching you guys, I get a lot of car information I didn’t know about and you guys have also interested me into cars and starting my own project so thank you Jobe, and everyone else on donut media. Jeremiah is it’s my favorite.
I wonder if you guys buy a base model used mini cooper to make it faster than Mini GP on a track. That would be epic. Money Pit?
What are the knuckle and rear arm from.?They said the knuckle was oem?
Im SO with Jimmy😂‐ roll it or use a buck/some kind of shaping guide- something!😆 Even if its just for feel-goods and doesn't really help.
Next video... kswap?
I am really enjoying seeing the progress on the civic. Also, you guys have that k series just lying around... so might as well just put it in the EG...
Hi
Can I get a 500$ civic?
You guys should’ve mashed suspension and brakes together, I feel like I’ve seen too many brake only videos from you guus
With a light car like this, I'm so curious what would happen if you just stripped it's interior as much as possible. Seats, roofliner, sound isolation, everything. How much weight would it save? Is it faster? Does it drive differently?  It's something that i'd like to try when building my own street legal racer
You guys always shit talked civics but when it came down to it. It was the car that treated you the best .
Jimmy looked like he was is in real pain when they took the hammer to the car
i wanna see this civic get more mods
I don’t think disk will do more stopping then a drum but fuck it u spent the 5 k alr
The second smokiest thing in North America right now is the Canadian forest. The first is Zach.
Best part that today I was working on my bicycle brakes lol😁
somebody murdered their dealer in this civic, and that’s why it’s so cheap
You put $5000 dollar brakes on and now you're broke.
money pit season 2
what was the blue gel that he put on the brake pads
h22 swap????
My Wish: a K24Z swap where you put in longer rods (reducing it to 2.0L) with high compression pistons and rev that thing to 10k+ with ITBs
moah powah bby!
Thai civic is gonna kick major ass when it’s done. Tbf this is the only series I care about anymore because the EG civic is my dream car
loving the civic built so far next is goona be a K24 swap obousely 🤟
Vitara build?
I have a feeling that by the end of this series only an modded integra will be left maybe with a honda badge.
lol why do this on a civic though
aaaaah Jobe is still alove nice^^
Y’all should put one of those super loud and super annoying exhausts on that thing.
That thing needs a baby stroller handle spoiler!
Those wheels look good on it!  😎
Excited for the K20A swap...
This series reminds me of my hooligan teenage years, thanks donut 😭
Spent 5 grand and didn't get back rotors and calipers just used factory Integra  parts , seems like you all got screwed, brembo probably would have been cheaper and better
Next episode: fix the rear hatch hydraulics 😢 +5HP
Budget basement k swap to match the paint/hammered fenders
I've been waiting for this...
Zach!!! You're alive!!! Hope you're in good health! 🍻
Mo power
either b16/18 or turbo for power
New segment  Over price stuff on low price car  😂
A 500 dollar civic.. yeah yeah..
You ain’t been scared till you’re haulin ass on a backroad and go to hit the brakes coming up to a sharp turn and they slow ya down maybe 3mph and you gotta pull the e brake to loop it around and gas it to keep from sliding backwards off a hill that was so steep I’d say it was a boarder line cliff
smack a big turbie on it
It's the tires that stop the car if you want better braking go wider tires
I didn’t know bedding was a thing and now I suspect it may be the cause of the uneven braking on one of my wheels, is there a way to fix uneven bedding without having to replace anything?
exost
When are you guys gonna K24 swap this thing?
WE WANT MORE CIVIC
Seems like hi car had a baby with money pit
K20aaa1 can’t wait to see them do it lol
K24 with a supercharger , 500bhp , Polybush it,  Cage it ,
Finally, no diarrhea
Putting a $500 Civic on our $5000 brakes
You should have done the 5 lug conversion while you were at it. $5k spoon brakes with 4x100 makes us sad 😢
I feel Jimmy’s pain
More power !!!
3:41 Ukraine colors... coincidence? I do not think so 😁 SLAVA UKRAINI!
For me, the most unbelievable part is to get an egg for 500 bucks with that nearly non existing amount of rust on the fenders. They hammered and it sounded freaking solid. For 500 bucks you get like a shell here 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why should we buy the gold disc, original and not the purple disc, DVD-R
I ran Miata spec CE28s on my EJ1 no problem. Dial in the camber. Also, master cylinder from a 91 Accord EX is direct bolt in without needing to bend lines - don't forget about doing that.
I still think 🧢 on the $500
I never had to "bed" my Toyota/ Lexus brakes, even after upgrading to a bigger brake package. I wonder why?
60-0 done twice as fast as 0-60 for sure
Stage 2 cams+tune😂
Such purtty eyes.
So what I learned from this video is just to buy an Integra
we need more of daddy jobe working on the honda please ??
I PHONK UR MOM
I volunteer my car as tribute  Lol
I thought Jimmy's anti hammering segment was going to lead into or was an advert for 3M ear plugs or another product as smoothly as they do the tie ins.
looks like powerstops in the rear?  have the tow version on my silverado for 35k mi now and they've been great.
Always remember: if your brakes don’t work, help yourself to others’.
You sure you want that much brake bias in the rear? Seems like it might unsettle the car. Rear brakes typically don’t do nearly as much as the fronts.
tell me money pit is back without telling me money pit is back
The music starting at 1:38 is fire. Love this honda gang stuff
They should keep it all motor
You really should have flushed all of the old fluid out of the lines before you put on all the nice new parts.  Brake fluid absorbs moisture over time and the moisture will decrease it's boiling point, making it fade sooner. Plus DOT 3 has a lower boiling point than DOT 4. When you were bleeding the brakes, you can see how dark the fluid was coming out.  All of that dark fluid was going in your new parts.  You need to keep pumping until it's coming out clear, like what you just put in the reservoir.
Am trying to see them building this 500 dollar civic into a decent car. Cause I have an EG which I got few days ago…….
All this video has told me is buy an integra
I love brake booster deletes on these cars too, especially with big brakes, the brake feel is amazing, the travel is WAY less than even with a big booster upgrade, and they are light enough it isnt that much pedal effort once you get used to it. Plus the master cylinder and brake booster have the same bolt spacing, so you can loosen the brake lines, pull forward the stock 13/16" master cylinder, remove the booster, push the master cylinder back against the firewall and run 2 good quality bolts and locking nuts through the firewall to attach the brake booster. You then cut apart the brake booster and remove the adjustable rod with the clevis pin that attaches the brake pedal to the booster, and it fits back right back in between the brake pedal and master cylinder. Tighten the lines, bleed everything, and boom, way better brake feel, super short brake travel, better brake modulation, and brakes that work perfectly even if the engine isnt running, all for the cost of a couple grade 8 bolts and locking nuts. There really is no comparison to the feel of a lightweight car with with manual brakes and a properly sized master cylinder.
missed opportunity for a "HALT!  HAMMERTIME!"
money pit miata 🤝 cash cow civic
I absolutely love how y'all are doing suspension and brakes before y'all do any performance mods
Turbski time!
Now k swap it
SAMIR, YOU'RE BRAKING THE CAR!
would have used the "baseball bat" rolling method rather than a hammer. rolls nicer
No alignment? That thing would pull hard in one direction.
I just want a civic now
You should do body parts, or engine, or gearbox with the Honda Civic for the next video!
4:06 smart upgrade with the master cylinder. This is a must for an all disc brake conversions, because drum brakes still have pressure in them when being used which means if you don’t upgrade your master…. The new disc brake conversion from the original drum  will hold the discs being pressurized causing drag and an unhappy vehicle. So it’s best to upgrade the entire system like you did and avoid the drag.
"We Put $5000 Brakes on our $500 Civic"  so, basically every civic owner out there
Ricer media
It’s wild how I start studying more about brake systems to prepare for my brake certification and then an in depth video like this pops up on my feed
Just gonna say, drum brakes are amazing for stopping, but not amazing for brake fade. If drum brakes weren't so good for stopping than big trucks would have discs. Also, you can get amazing results from using a wooden baseball bat, the wheel, and a jack for fender rolling.
Ebay turbo
Seems kinda silly to me to have the fancy drilled and vented rotors on the back.
I always tell folks that I keep my hot hatch for the big brakes, not the big turbo. Safety first!
I say yall should get some new rims and tires in the next vid. Important not just for looks but for grip and handling. But yall already knew that lol
Million dollar company, $5000 brakes, and can’t afford a vacuum brake bleeder.
bro those wheels are fire, turned that car up.  i think you will do exahust/intake or suspension next.   DIY wrap?
Engine swap ‼️‼️
How is this not considered Money Pit?
And I thought the $600 rotors I put on my truck were nice 😳
How about ABS?
I mean, I would love to see a B16A swap, and keep it NA. My Honda CRX had a B16A with a lot of goodies like Skunk2 intake manifold and power core headers. It also had shot peened rods and Eagle pistons running 11:1 compression. It put down 182HP to the front tires at 9,000RPM. Everyone did Turbo for big numbers but I could destroy them around a track. It all depends on what you want the car to do though and what you enjoy.
I hate it when my brakes get faded, smokin all my shit
I think you need my old school B16a for the next upgrade. It's just sittin' here.
im sure yall are gonna put the K motor that you built a while back  honestly im hoping for it tbh  and those rims and tyres really made it look like a way better civic
more eg vids
You guys teach me something new with every video. Thanks for all that yall do🤙
Where have you been man? Nice work on that civic! I would love to see ot k swapped 😂
Did they hoon this without an alignment, or just skip covering the alignment in the procedure?
I just bought a Coupe civic 94 for $3500, idk where you found a $500 civic!
Feels like the return of Money Pit, love it
Now THIS is science
that poor ENKEI is bent AF :( 9:08
Cozy civic build, I like how you were able to use some integra parts to upgrade the braking system. This build is looking good already :)
Glad to see Jobe got over his diarrhea
The very last brake on the video it looks like the rear is not braking at all
is there a reason they don't use the same brakes front and back?
Burnishing?
Was this a tutorial how to warp your brand new rotors? Feel like you were going a bit hard there.... I personally like to go on the brake while on the throttle
K24 hybrid
I plan on buying a civic hatchback in about a year and a half and doing some small stupid stuff like this to make it a sleeper
Dont let james drive the civic.....
You should do a seperate channel. Called putting brakes on cars. Wtf happened to Donut? Pure sh1te.
Man this made me miss my EG
MONEY PIT LIVES!!!!
This editing is awful
Generic comment
Lets goooooo, next episode
The Money Pit vibes are real!
I’m waiting to see it get a sick ass turbo k20
Add a Brake Master support bracket to prevent firewall flex and the brakes will feel 27.34867% better....  thats science.....yo
love this civic
It’s disgusting they’ve begun to use that weird dodododo music in their videos. Worst music trend ever
more!!!! MOOORRREEE!!!
That is not how you bed brakes. You know better than this?? Disappointed.
Damn. Suspension and brakes.
Instead of adding a power adder, maybe all wheel drive......?
Turbo, nos, nahhh good old street Blower 🤣
Can we take a moment and appreciate the sound design when they show how things work? Sound effects help us to understand what is happening during the little on screen visual and it's amazing.
Be honest, you got the car, the flannel, and the brake system to match those baby blue eyes LOL
Tickling the algorithm
K-Swap that beast
Love this series!
We all knew Spoon stuff was top notch thanks to Hector
The music in this episode was top notch.
Wondering when the K swap is coming
K SWAPPPPPPP
2:26 that spacer isn’t safe. I hope there is still space enough for the rim to rest on the hub and not the axle studs which could shear off while driving if you hit a big enough bump. 😅 be safe guys ❤ love your content.
That EG hatch is gonna be a beast by the end! Everyone who sees it and scoffs : beware!!
I'll put it in, but won't use it. 😏
I'm loving it
Lol they sell brackets for those calipers to fit the OEM knuckle
More power! Two turbine engines that sends power to 4 electric motors that turn each wheel individually!!! :P
K swap
I wish there was unlimited content like this on the channel. I could watch this all day.
I pity jimmy having to hear all the metal noises of Zack bullying the civic
Could easily get by with some second hand brembos, the spoon brakes are just to flex at this point.
S/O to your music department. I could be wrong, but I thought I heard something that referenced Björk and something else that references Fela Kuti. 👊🏿
So this is money pit?
I'd rather just buy the $32,000 car and get everything I want. LOL
Give the guy who bought those wheel well lights a raise.  Viewers can actually see what the hell you guys are doing!
Hell yeah engine swap!
$5k for two brake calipers? That’s just stupid. You can get a massive Wilwood brake setup for that much
Are they Making a spoon build
Just put Nokia 3310 brake caliper ez
LS swap
Here comes that Ka
money pit 3 but its just zach goofin
I can see that eventually the only thing left of Little Civic will be the Dashboard, Chassis, Bodywork and Glass, everything else will be RaceKorrr.
so excited for this series, i have a red eg hatch and already you guys are putting some of the dream parts on this thing
Cold air intake.
You might as well make this thing a race car
Hand on the rotor is cringe
What about upgrading an exhaust and engine on civics?
k24
Allright guys... put the money-pit intro in these videos and e we will all be happy
Finally, the cash hole honda series
Dang jobe I missed your face the EG is coming along nicely!
Don't let this dostract you from the fact that Hector is running 3 spoon engines with a motech exhaust!!!!
The people demand more 500 dollar civic vids.
HERE COMES THE K20 TURBO!!
What was it you used on the back of the brake pads?, I was always told to use copper slip, if there is somthing new that is better then I'd like to know :)
2jz swap
Spacer behind the brake rotor? For clearance or to center The caliper/rotor?? I have civics but I’m so confused at that one…
You guys should also switch to a Integra brake booster as well to match the bigger MC, I just did this on my EG and it makes the brake pedal feel much stiffer, otherwise great job.
🙏🏼 Please do more upgrades video on a civic🚗 and maybe in the future can you make a video of a Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V.
Donut are the kings of the 10$ saddle on a 2$ horse
😂😂😂 how do you get a $500 civic
Nice
Honda!
I was beginning to believe Jobe was lost in the wilderness somewhere
Those aren't even brakes though? They're clearly labeled "Spoon", not "Brakes".   Those are for cereal 🥣
This is Money Pit without calling it Money Pit.
I put 300 dollar front brakes on my accord… I thought that was excessive. The stop tech stainless steel brake lines are great!
$5000 brakes on a $500 civic? So now the car is worth $600.
Haven't been disappointed is this series yet!  Got an Accord I may be starting to play with very soon...
Do a k-series swap  Mo powah
vtec
Obviously you need to drop the v6 out of an Odyssey in there.  Although a 1.5 turbo from the newer SI or Accord would be good.  In the end i expect to see a small turbo that keeps with the more traditional power range of the car. 10 to 12 psi of boost but the small size will allow for power where a D series engine needs it
Love the expensive upgrades on the cheap car!
Please k swap it
This really should be the next money put car
I could watch car Jesus talk about brakes all day.
Didnt they have body roller in some episode back?
Can we just appreciate jobes beautiful blue eyes
Forge the engine 👍
Now I want a civic
Wouldn't it be better to just start with the Integra in the first place.
.....where did you get those wheels Jobe....WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THE MIATA?!?!?!!?!?
kswap
More civic videos❤
Turbo K22 is my guess
So cool do more
K20 swap coming soon
K swap bby. Than an aero kit
Put a k series motor in it
Sounds like you guys are transforming it into a integra
If you guys just say screw it and K-swap this thing next episode I'm going to lose my mind!!!!!!!
love these type of videos most. keep working on old cars
"Things fix themselves all the time. Yeah will go with that" haha
this Civic series will be awesome
This car will be awesome! So light and balanced! Plus is the classic glory days that brought the japanese tuning scene to mainstream.
If you have a highway with only a few people on it or access road where you don't have to stop at a light, that's a great place to bed in. City streets are actually a terrible place to do it because you cannot really get enough speed. Ideally, you want to be going 60-70mph or more, because the faster you're going to more heat you generate.
That’s like putting $10,000 boobs on a $10 woman
a K swap perhaps
Thank god Jobe wasn't sick with diarrhea today, we finally got a good video (money pit 2)
Look at Zach rocking the Seiko Batman GMT. Always got my eye on the boys wrist candy.
👍🏼
I don't think you're calipers (rear) are grabbing.  That's why you're fronts are grabbing so hard and skidding.
This series is such a stealth money pit
3:36 🟨🟦 -  blue and yellow baby! Glory to Ukraine
Love an EG hatch, especially in teal ❤ stoked on this series
❤The playlist today is fantastic, guys
Dude those civic worth 10.000$-20.000$ in here😵‍💫
Oh yeah money pit in disguise and I'm up for it 🔥🙌🏼
Wait, did you put a spacer behind the rotor?
Back in the day (which makes me feel old as shit) GSR knuckles calipers and rotors where the upgrade to have and full rear from any Integra (trailing arms and everything) to convert to rear disk.  throw in an LSVTEC (if you dont know look it up) and you had one sweet fart caned civic/ or in my case CRX HF.
Heeeessssssss baaaack!!!!!!
After a K Swap. Just some steering and transmission upgrades, then some tires and wheels to wrap up the performance areas.  Finish the project up with a wrap???   Ill keep watching
Yeahh... Mo PoW Baby
Definitely an air intake and some spoon stickers for a little extra power!
Money Pit is back. 💪💪
Let me guess, k20. Not bad, but something in the lines of a b16 or b18 would be natural for this car
Incoming K swap 😁
You should  give the car a new body job and but in  some power on it  , then   maybe the interior and change steering.
K24 is going in next...sweet build love these videos
why don't you guys have sick donut coveralls yet while you work on the cars?
K swap?
Money Pit Civic. Nice
On a car like this it's just waste of money.
next big turbo and a AWD swap
What will it be a B series swap? K series? Or they’ll just boost that D Series? 🤔 can’t wait for next episode
Glad to see Jobe back on camera 😊
more please.
Sure, if you got functional suspension and sticky tires.... nicer brakes can be nice.  (but for 5 grand?  I did a 4 wheel disc conversion on my civic for under 2k, and I got hawk HPS pads and brembo rotors)
I hope to see an engine swap in the next video
DONUT GOT PLUG PRICES!!! I’ll send you over $500 right now if you can get us one! 😍
as a honda boi 2 things 1)THIS IS SO GOOOD FOR MY SOUL 2) I really hope they do a crossover with boosted boiz it would be so good and I already know there gonna be doing a b or k series swap but i think they should do a j series swap because you never see it and the top of the motor sticking out just looks so fucking good\
I think the Eg Need some performance upgrades.
AHH Please D\don't make us wait as long for the next hondaboi video !!
ready for k20
No before and after brake test?
Beware of all the scam bots with explicit profile pictures!
😮
you should add a turbo next
Yall really need to fix up the body cause that dirt and those scratches just hurt to look at
When donut media gets ripped off with all these hype prices. Those calipers were worth 1k 5 years ago lol
So, is this moneypit or not?
I bought my EF hatch for $1,000 4 years ago and I've put like $5K in it so far but you guys are going above and beyond lol
Obviously to achieve more power you’re going to slap on a couple of tuner decals
k24 swap
Now needs the ABS stuff 😝😝
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Hector is going to be running three Honda civics with Spoon engines, and on top of that, he just went into Harry’s and bought three T66 turbos with NOS, and a Motec system exhaust.
Swap a 1.9TDI engine in that civic
You guys should fix up my truck for a video
Why is this not called money pit?
Finaly, a video without the IDIOT JAMES! Thank you!
Today we're going to do JUST the brakes. Proceeds to replace basically the whole axle, on Each corner of the vehicle. 🤦😂✌️
K20 or K24 swap it Donut!
I'm tired of explaining this to younger people, but here goes. Drum brakes provide superior braking power!  Their problem is they fade much faster and take longer to cool, making disks the better choice.
Just add the money pit intro at this point
Wait wait wait did you put the spacer behind the disk? Surely thats not right ?
The things I would do to have that Civic
Why would you not go 5 lug switching all those parts?
K20 swap nxt
Civics like this are why civics were ever great
“K Swap”!!
I really hope they Kswap this! 😉
Civics aren't worth the money outside reliability and gas mileage.
Engine swap! Engine swap! Engine swap!
That K20 baby!!!!!!
Also the manufacturers back then were still figuring out how to fully transition over to disc brakes while keeping the weight down.  The result was there were a lot of cars that had these undersized calipers and rotors like this one.
Just want to give a shout out to the graphic artists who do the illustrations and animations that are so clear, easy to understand and accurate. They don't get the love they deserve, I bet.
Why not drilled and slotted?
Why did you use hammer instead of pipe, using pipe carefully can do a very nice job.
Bedding your brakes? How come they don’t tell you that when you get new ones..? I hate auto shops. Thanks for keeping it real yall  😂🎉
Itps and header ?
Dude forgot this wasn’t high/low.  This is a fucking high car lol
I am liking the civic content. Please do a period correct, full OBX exhaust on that thing.
Soon enough the car parts will cost 5 time as much as the car
Who ever steals that Honda is gonna have some nice brakes
88mm turbo incoming
Pls put a overkill top of the line k20 engine in it that goes stututu
Omg could have done a 5 lug swap and used brembo calipers from an acura.
I put corvette brakes and braded steel hoses on my IROC for $2000
I love this format for videos, it has the same vibes as the money pit videos. Great content!
Reminds me of when I put $3,000 brakes on my $3,000 car 🥲
Nice video but I hate the clickbait title. It should be "We changed the whole breaking system on this 500$ Civic for over 5000$".
De-stroker 10k RPM K series. Do it, you won’t!
Man, this episode went by so fast.
I wish they'd had a time lapse of how long it actually took to pound that knuckle loose
DAY 1 OF ASKING FOR A DONUT VLOG CHANNEL
Honda content it always would be a thing
this civic will cost 50K SGD in singapore
Race car life now Jimmy 7:47
$5,000 worth of groceries would be better
how you just going to lie like that
Haha just put the money pit graphic on this and I would love it 1000% more
How did you buy an EG for $500? In Canada people are asking $7000 for an EG like that except that it is rusting to pieces...
FIRST CAN THIS BE PINED BC I WAS FIRST LOL
You had me at Spoon
I was hoping for Jimmy to do a 'STOP! Hammertime!' joke
Ready for that K swap. I saw one hanging out in the background of another video is it for this EG?
So this is the new unofficial Money Pit?
K swap?
The eg is looking clean!
I hope this new donut video I've been looking forward to (that isn't a list) isn't edited down to basically nothing.
Isn't this the channel that said you should just call a guy to roll your fenders?
I'm a little shocked at using stock rotors.
I love what it's capable.
If this series had a name, it'd definitely be called "Shitbox", and I'm 100% here for it
Ls swap for sure
Bring back Up to Speed
There is no way you can mess this up homeboy.
Yall are always doing turbos, I think it's time to whip out the Whipple for more power, baby😂 or any supercharger
You remind me of kurt russell lol
K swap!
Rally hi-low
no anti-seize on the rotor?
I really wanna see it make mo powa now :D
My 1999 Civic watched this and asked me why I wasn't doing this.
vtech SWAAAAAP
If Vault TEC made brakes. Blue and yellow
$500 for a civic with a clean body and full interior?? Where ??
It's Turbo Time!
Dry ice the chassis.. this thing is incredibly clean from what I can see.
What they didnt mention is that they bought the $500 civic 7 years ago when cars were cheap
good luck with the handbrake :D btw, one tip; in order to properly bled rear calipers, you need to disconnect handbrake cables while bleeding them
K24 with K20 head!!
0:25  really enjoy donut I’ve been i fan since 2019 when I found the everything you need to know series by pumpfrey
k swap
Turbo next 😂😂
k swap
'What a machineeeee' reminded me of the great orangutan.. 11:07
Does anyone know - Is it a bad idea to try to even out my brake rotors on a 2016 civic? They havent been changed in a long time, if ever of the car's ~90k miles, and the pads are also a little old. Under heavy braking it shudders but I cant tell if that's from worn pads or uneven disc coating.
Next video lets do a K swap
I don't know why but I love when people spend too much money making something that's considered worthless better than it could ever be. it's not the smartest decision but you're left with something good and a labor of love. You also end up with a sleeper apparently.
please supercharge it
Using a hammer??? Use a wooden baseball bat to roll the guards after reinstalling the steel wheel, in the US I'm sure they're not uncommon.
you gotta turbo 🫵💪
next, do all of this for a 2008 pathfinder 😎
Put a b series motor 😄
just dont k swap it.
My question, as I always been taught to avoid hard emergency braking with new brakes, is it really a myth? If someone with far more experience could answer I'll be very grateful😅
We need v-tec
Exhaust next time!
reminder that this Civic build is theoretically Moneypit season 4
But why though? You dont have enough car to utilize them
can we take a second to appreciate jobe's eyes? my god those dreamy blues
Frame retirement? Cage?
Man, I sure do want to be the guy selling them parts. The calipers are like 1500 and what maybe another 500 max on rotors and pads. Common Donut we don't need this click bait stuff.
Im stoking on this one already, some of the better content in a while in my opinion.
This is really making me miss my 98 dx, the drum to acura 9:00 disk swap was one of the best upgrades I did.
So this means that Money Pit is back?
We don’t see drag racing in your channel often, we want high and low. Drag cars edition. Buy an old camaro or mustang or challenger like 2013 and upgrade it to be fully drag race car
Great video guys I always enjoy watching you dudes have fun working on cars😂 seriously though where did y’all find a Honda for 500$ 👀
Spacers behind the rotors seem sketch
Doubt got Spoon brakes before Hector ever got his engines. 😂
Pleeeease do some Genesis coupe content 🙏🏽🙏🏽
I like MONEY !
Definitely an exhaust upgrade
need 2 more hondas and 3 spoon engines.
For more power. You should do air intake and exhaust
The wheel spacers does NOT go behind the brake rotor.
Can't wait for when they put a spoon engine and a t66 turbo in the civic
Honda bikes also use nissin brake
I am trying to do a full rebulid of my lada niva for 5000$😂😂 But the bigest thing is that they replaced those drum brakes with disc brakes, another awesome video!
This the type of content that could be on the “Real Mechanic Stuff” channel
Such a cool series 🔥
Nice to see Jobe finally conquered his intestinal issues enough to make another video.  :D
Yes
This thing def needs a boosted K20 or sumthn along those lines!
Thing thats crazy about this is there is a modified honda fit-
k20a swap
I'd love to see a money pit or hi-low with Ford/Mercury MN12'S 1989-1997 Thunderbird and Cougar   I've had both and love them. Currently have a '92 XR7 with the 5.0
This feels like money pit and I'm all here for it
If at the end of the build, this Civic is not running a spoon engine with T66 turbo, NOS, and a Motec system exhaust I'd be super disappointed.
he must be k20z1 swapped
KAY SWAP
Better brakes are one of the few upgrades that can be put on any car for any reason. It's just plain safer all around. Bigger rotors, bigger calipers with more pistons, steel braided brake lines leads to much, much more safety and performance no matter the application.
Please protect this Civic. Y'all modding it and I'd hate to see it go to thieves. Tracker/mods to prevent theft could be another vid though you've done plenty anti theft videos before.
It’s giving money pit vibes 💖
Go on with the k swap
JOBE BACK!!!!
Love the music!
Mo power Honda + turbo = winning
For me its the door closures. That sound is SOO 90's Honda. I Love this series
I think you'll need some proper seats to prevent sliding around like a wet noodle.
I want hatch now
Not so much a mod as an aesthetic fix - would be cool in the end to get to a shop like Robby Layton's to get a great looking paint job on it too.
I would of replaced that CV Axel while I had it out. Put in a beefier one. But thats my opinion. If I had a show where I could get a car I love and upgrade on the cost of the channel. Ever car guys dream lol
Make a video about preserving a car for years
Ques who dosen't have diarea now
More videos for the civic
Honda rotors always warp... Why would you use oem rotors?
So they turned the civic into an integra.
Air intake fosho
That is the exact model year and color I want for a project. Too bad I'm broke 😂
Next $6000 engine swap
Drop a gm 3.8 supercharged in there!!
🤨🔴..With ALL DUE RESPECT, I've heard what you have had to say in this "very well" put video BUT..  DON'T let this distract you from the FACT that Hector is going to be running three Honda Civics with  Spoon-engines, and on top of that!, he just went into Harry’s and bought three T66 turbos with NOS  and a Motec-Exhaust system!
I will say sometime arround 150hp to 250hp whit some itbs    and  short  gear ratio is okey for that car  dont need allot of pawa to get fun in a civic
I love how Donut actually got real Nissin Spoon calipers. You guys definitely have some real Hondaheads on staff lol
Very smart to upgrade suspension and brakes BEFORE power upgrades.
Engine swap😮
Way older and more reliable than the STIs.
I have the new Acura Integra, and by watching your videos, inspired me to put on mods all the way to stage two. Intake in a cooler downpipe from pipe. Lowering springs.(for now) and she’s also tuned up. When I can save up a little bit more money. I’m gonna rewatch your engine swap video. (To do the same to my car with the Type-R engine with transmission.) thank you guys for all you do. ❤️
How did you guys find a eg6 for 500 in socal in 2023?
Man, I love that little Civic. Want to get one before I bite the dust.
I spot the new Seiko 5 GMT. Dope
Drum brakes are one of those things that I am still surprised are still around. A lot of your big rigs still use air drum brakes but are finally starting to be replaced with air disc brakes and I know that a lot of trailers big and small still use drums for some reason.
This is amazing
More of this please thank you
hang on, drum brakes dont brake good? thats not true, theyre better then disk brakes with stopping power but they dont manage heat as good as disk brakes
Hi-Low and Money Pit did the Fusion dance to make this show
wheels possibly, perhaps mugen wheels?
Spoons up front and...random in the rear?
I wish i could put rotors on the rear of my Mirage.  Great car other than that and the CVT
Im pretty sure modern civics have drums on the back.
I love your videos man! Keep ‘em coming
best part of bedding brakes is explaining to a cop why you are suddenly having 50mph spurts in a 30 zone lol
Hmm, i wonder if it's going to get that K20A you guys put together a month ago
Can you guys do this with my 01 echo 5 speed
Cold air intake, headers and exhaust would be a good start. Turbo in the future and then a good tune maybe
Y’all are the kings
This is like me and My FC, but I haven't gotten to brakes yet!!! :(((((((((((((((((
“Stop… Stop… You’re hurting the car!“ Man that sent me.😂
500$ civic with no rust  is like 5000$ in Canada. Without an engine....
That's a lot of money for brakes that use stock rotors...
Should Have Used Spoons In The Back. 🤣🤣🤣🤘🤘
Next time try a pip that just barely fits in between the tire and and fender drive forward bam 💥 perfectly rolled fender .
"Sometimes things just fix themselves"  As an IT field tech, its hilarious how true this is.
if this thing doesnt get that K20 you guys re-built I'm gonna be pissed. I'll drive down there and show you. It better happen.
Just like Gran Turismo 🤣
Did someone say V12?
Guys, props. I honestly thought you guys were gonna skip the proportioning valve, everyone always does lol. Well played, well played. Btw you should only tighten suspension bushings with the suspension fully loaded. If not you're going to twist the bushing and will have premature wear.
K series baby possibly turbocharged
I love this series! Please keep ‘em coming
Jobe
Usually folks just add a $5000 head unit to their shitbox.
Had a 99 Integra like in the photo. Great car, great color.
crazy difference woww
Probably twisted the brake hose when you installed the rear caliper. Untwisted and all of a sudden it doesn’t hold unnecessary pressure. 🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂😂
Actually me with my 1991 Toyota Corolla wagon
u can tune the shit out of that civic
Weight Reduction
The video had me at $500 civic.  Where the heck can you find one for 5 bills?   Sheesh.  Lol
Nothing better than Spoon parts!  You guys should be painting the knuckle so things will look even better under there.
I want to see some Tim "the Tool Man" Taylor level power upgrades 😂
4500$ civic u have a 4k coilover set on 🤣
K swap it
LET'S GO CIVIC
Keep the civic videos coming!
i love this
May Jimmy have mercy
oh please upgrade this car to the hell and back, i love this!
I would ask why, but I guess the real question is, why not?
I'm calling it there going to K swap the civic
We need a Foxbody in the mix fellas! 🔥💯🎉
KEEP IT JUIICCCEEDD
brakes be like why am I going a car that’s worth 10x less then me lol 😂😂
Hi
brakes be like why am I going a car that’s worth 10x less then me lol 😂😂
when  k20 !!!
Spoon is the coolest name.
Please tell me this is the new season of Money Pit we have been waiting patiently for. 🥹
This channel has the most views and the wildest content out of any other channel on yt! Good Job!! 🔥💯🎉
????
What aftermarket company do y'all recommend for Toyota i have a project 2004 Toyota Corolla which i want to turn it in to a straight line speed demon but i only have just swapped out the old motor with 3 liter 2jzgte can't seem to find good company that makes drop in replacement brake parts.
Slowly gonna become a track car
Love Donut. This seems impractical though. Buy $500 civic. put 20K worth of parts on it to turn it into a stock 15K integra. Suprised how much stock integra parts are being used but it makes sense
0-60 in 3 business days, 60-0 in an instant
been waiting for this civic content for a while, looking forward with the k swap on this civic
Waiting for “converting our $500 civic to rwd”
k swap  this please!
Lmaooo "These parts are known to be really high quality 🤓as well as really STEEZY 🤙"
we need more of this series
My 1995 almost killed me… hit the breaks and slid 40 feet into the intersection!!! 😂😂😂😂
next video :- we put $10 brakes for our $100000 bugatti chiron
Let’s start off by saying breaks need tires
Hi
Notif gang
There’s better ways to roll your fenders cheaply 🫨😭
I hope next is some engine modifications
This is the kind of content I want. Like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like
Glorious
why didn't you guys just buy an integra
GUYS!! THEY ARE UPGRADING THE CIVIC!!!!❤
Brakes don't matter that much until you have good tires.  When you want to make your car awesome, especially if it's racing or sport, number 1 is tires, then pads and fluids, then brakes and suspension, and only then do you start to consider power or weight, since getting power often requires high cost and sacrificing reliability, and reducing weight is either expensive or cheap, but reduces comfort and day to day use ability.  Also, if you want to race, don't use expensive brakes. Stick to steel rotors because replacing them is so much cheaper. Carbon ceramics and carbon carbon brakes are only once you have sponsors paying the bills.
Also Toyota Taco owners please take note on the drum brake section😂😂😂😂
I used to be an avid watcher,  Wtf happened?! Y'all building civics now??  Building a van next I assume
Up to speed on Ken Block
YES YES YES THIS IS THE SERIES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
More important question - does $5K worth of brakes on a $500 car make it a $5500 car?
Love this type of content
7 minutes late
The non hubcentric rotors make me uncomfortable
Bro this is the epitome of money pit. A spiritual successor. Great video guys.
Im so excited for the civic build,its everything we needed
Next upgrade: Spoon engine 😏
finally more civic stuff
540th like
Heyyyy Zach is back

I'm a simple man. I see Zach working with older cars. I click.
Congrats to Everybody who is here in time to find this comment 🏅
First bitchs
Great video.
I wondering where up to speed went?
Bro you guys are literally building my car, Same color, wheels and a k series I love it! XD
yeyewooww
I fuckin LOVE this ratchet lil build.
My first question is "Why"
Do all the most expense Mods... but keep the Low HP motor in it
Get a spoon engine from Hector!!
Civic gang
That makes financial sense😊
Yesssss i love these videos
Ten times the price yet the Civic is still quicker than those brakes
This is a disgusting spacer. Never put that on your car, will induce vibration and is really bad. Install a spacer that is designed for your car
They cant keep getting away with it
Is this new season money pit?
Upgrading trash with cash. Sweet this new series really needs a name.
Let’s go always love a new donut video in the morning
Heyyy
woot new vid, I was bored!
how did you get a used car for $500? i call bs.
Why🗿
He touched the caliper and disc with his hands! In the bin buy new ones😆
Yeh thats cool and not, but are you gonna move?! 😂
Dropping everything for this Donut Civic
Jobe is back yayyyy!!!
The most unbelievable part of this video is the fact they found a 500 dollar civic in on this economy
1 min ago
This series is awesome!! Keep this up:)
Where did you find a running car for $500 in 2023? Lol I can't find a 90s camry for less than $1600

Bring back up to speed!
Glad to see our man jobe no longer has diarrhea 😂
YES
Get another civic and do a new high low series
What’s next?

But did you know that Hector is gonna be running three Honda Civics with Spoon engines. On top of that, he just came into Harry's and ordered three T66 turbos with NOS and a Motec system exhaust.
