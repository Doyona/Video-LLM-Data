*this guy makes more than linus with 5 employees* massive profits
They are expert developers became hackers.
They keep using the same video over and over again.  At this point they should just kill that stream as soon as the video starts playing.
You look well old dude 👴, time for a break?
Hacked due to session from server.
Comment bots are still active. I get it on almost every comment I make on any video.
The hacker made out with about 7000usd in crypto
Perhaps linus does not know what he’s doing when infact he has those multiple useless channels which could have been combined into one easily.
my analog emote.   ' , '
That has to be an inside job.
I hope these hackers keep attacking that fucking shill.
Never log in Windows or check email on Windoiws, always log in on macOS.  God bless.
Steve from gamers nexus was the first person to tell him. Got him out of bed. Those ads could have ran all night lol. Scammers make a million crypto bucks off of dumb people.
LTT is back, youtube should seriously clear their mess here.
is Lew ok? He seems really down in this video.
If they are Russian Based Hackers they will soon be in Body Bags as the Ukraine War is spreading into Russia.
I hope that you get your channels back in double quick time.
Anyone able to tell me what microphone arm he has?! :D and sorry LTT for this happening. :(
Channel's back up. Btw, who watches this guy's podcast lol? And this clips channel has like fricking 800k cubs but barely geta a few thousand views per clip with a few rare ones that have a lot more. Whatever, I do like that he's faded into irrelevancy.
Recently Linus had a clip from his channel where he was humble bragging about turning down over a hundred million dollars for his company. I wonder if that put a target on his back.
Damm..well channel is backup here in UK..❤😊I do watch Techtips daily so all Good Xx
Imagine this is actually Elon doing this as fake Elon 😮
When my favourite tech youtuber disappeared I actually crapped my pants
I'm sorry guys, but it will not ever stop, we are always one step behind those who do the hacking. That's how you plug the breaches most of the time by being reactive, unfortunately. Proactive approaches have lead to leaps and bounds in assisting us to catch up, but we are always chasing.
This channel has no more passion into it, it’s like listening to dead podcast.
Hate that shrimp anyways
is back channel
I think Elon Musk with crypto scam is a new age Rick Roll, only without all the cool music
Companies of his size needs to start hiring hackers to test their security measures.
LinusDropTips would have been a more appropriate channel handle change 😂😂😂😂😂
These hack are caused by social engineering, YouTube could add an easy solution, just make multiple account for multiple purpose...
I saw a notification of Tesla doing a live stream of bitcoin going 1 million. I was like what? Later got to know Linus's channels were hacked. 😲. Hopefully YT can help him restore his videos and ensure better security measures for all the content creators out there
His channel seems back to normal now
Hes back btw
😂 it’s like that big ugly dude that works for them 🤣.
But im here at his channel?what hacked?
I swear it happened to me, I checked uploaded videos in hacked account and there are some bunch of videos about hacking crypto
Inside job from youtube, so obvious.
I got subscribed to "Tesla" channel without my permission!
They're back up
They do the same on Instagram but no one talks about it.
U sus ASF bro 😂😂
MacAddress is fine tho XD XD XD
greedy for sponsor ship your channel soon to be hack
I'm a Youtuber, I'm so scared I get hacked. 😬
Why is Lew so slow, is he tired or something? I hope he's doing well man...
you seem really jaded man...  first time viewer though just trying to catch up with the sexy bearded lady
It happened here in the UK a few weeks ago to Paul Hibbert home tech, he got caught out by an email from a scammer pretending to be a potential sponsor
Meet girls from Ukraine ad?  What're y'all searching over there?😂
I'm kinda glad. I hope this teach him to not make clickbait on titles and thumbnails AND use more security methods to log in to his channel.
Happens to the best of us
I hate this video. The choice of thumbnail is tasteless and clickbait. It suggest 2 things: A) your on a video call with Linus or B) you have no respect for Linus to post that picture of him out of context, no one has seen his reaction!   Next your not even paying attention to the camera, your literally playing with a toy which shows you don’t care.  Lastly your just reading other peoples news articles, this video is literally the definition of a channel that has sold out.   I used to watch all your videos, I thought I could trust them hence why I watched yours first when it came to this topic.   Am I angry? No.   Am I disappointed and unsubscribed? Yes.
petabyte server about to finally come in handy.
How does someone hack an account with 2FA?
I think this happens when You talk about cheating in Tarkov! Hahahaha
why i am laughing
He forgot to enable NordVPN
Fuck Clickbait-Thumbnail!
They hacked LTT to upload tech scam🤦‍♂️probablyost of the one who subscribed to linus are tech savy and know about the scam
He's all about redundancy.  They'll re-upload and be fine.
Hilarious
Now I know what that weird channel that I decided to unsub to is now😅  But in all seriousness I am heart broken at the moment
My heart goes out to Linus and the Team, it is shocking! The channel's bring new tech info but always entertained at the same time!  Surely you have something better to do? Grow up!  Leave it be and STOP.
Watching this video was more painful than Linus getting hacked and his videos deleted.  Dude is so bored while making this video he's playing with blocks.
Linus keeps all of his own shit backed up (he made a video about it once upon a time)
Says he violated terms of service , oh but hack , ok
I'm sorry for Linus but yt doesn't delete the channels when they are terminated or something. Maybe Linus can work with yt to restore everything he has lost.
No one should be buying into crypto these days. Maybe this will spur Alphabet to take the problems on YouTube seriously and start to address them. ***Hahahahahahahaa***
I wish it was yours
Big company like that would be losing over 10k a day for sure when down.
The big boys don't care, they keep making money on a monumental scale and even Linus is not safe.   Ideally we need a reset of the whole internet with security at its core, instead we keep patching it due to legacy issues.  I also think GPU and Motherboard manufacturers need to come together and work out a chip set like the win bond chips of old which will prevent GPU's being used in Mining in the first place.   For example the GPU has half the chip on it built into the main GPU dye  and similarly the CPU, the system will then go online once up and running to remote verify and lock to graphics mode making crypto a thing of the past, literally the hand sake will be done every time you're online and it will be done at the backbone level of the internet to prevent spoofing.  Obviously if people have non networked devices and want to play games once downloaded so the last good mode would apply this would stop the hackers and scammers in their tracks.
Funny how Linus is blaming the platform and not taking any responsibility for his own actions because "it has to be youtube because FloatPlane is fine..."  Lol no one cares about FloatPlane... Youtube is the audience... without Youtube Linus is just some rando with a mediocre IT skill set.
same exact thing happened to my twitter account. they changed my profile to look like elon, and i got banned. it took forever to get it back.
Linus Cat Tips is still up and running
It’s not even about whether or not he’ll be OK, Linus works really hard for what he’s built. I imagine it’s someone or a company giving them the middle finger.
Is his account salvageable?
Lew "We're talking about it now" Sounds like he's had a rough day. Getting a bit annoyed there.
Crazy - I was confused because I was just watching an LTT vid last night that I couldn't find. At least we know it'll be back up before too long..!!
oh damn Lew it was not a micro dose :D
Nothing of value was lost.
I’ve been binging LTT for the past week too wtf lmaooo
Google is such trash.
Hacker made around 7k now the links are blocked by google
Linus needs tech tips
Need Jim Browning on the case.  Try and hunt these guys down.  Would make great content for a good cause.
I wonder what option LTT used for Multifactor?
@linustechtips
I hope YouTube has a feature where you can't just delete a video posted a week and older, make a 3 to 7 days allowance before getting deleted
yoo cantt  defeet hakcrz
what the heck did I just watch...
Why hasn't YouTube just pulled all links in the comments. Nobody ever has clicked a link in the comments ever.
Looks like Luke's first cpl weeks updating their security measures is going a little rough
Someone probably got mad because he was laughing at the hard R and thought it was a joke. Not funny bro
It's when their backup system fails and lose everything and blames it on a hack.
This is nuts
SHIIIIISHHH
how hard is it for youtube to detect that something is fishy? if someone tries to delete multiple videos or private them in a short period of time, it's obviously weird, so maybe have a validation for that, send an email or something to make sure that they are doing it on purpose and it wasn't someone else accessing their account
the scammer got roughly 7k USD worth in several different crypto currencies before youtube took the channel down and cloudflare flagged the website as malicious so that people get a warning now.
The next WAN Show will set standards.
wait, i've seen this Elon thumbnail! i'm just not interested in crypto and and all that stuff so i didn't watch it, didn't pay attention it was from LTT
Before temp they renamed the channel 'Tesla' and put the Tesla logo as the icon
It would be crazy if it turned out that the people that hacked the channel were the same people that scammed Linus of almost $100k
I’m sure looking at his bank account will make him feel better 👍🏼😂
Now I have to wait to finish that video on the 500fps build
at least they had all the videos saved, so they could upload them again
Seriously though, I blame this new A.i. technology.
This is not first hack of big channels. Videos are not deleted, but just unpublished.. don't worry
Huh, I was wondering where my daily LTT video was. I know YouTube still has everything so I hope it's back up soon.
this can easily be recovered and reverted by youtube, same thing happened to a popular german youtuber, everything went back to normal, like nothing happened, even subscribers etc.
A lot of people are saying the video they keep playing is fake and ai generated.
I was watching the 500 htz monitor video when it happen then I clicked ltts loco and it went to Tesla and I thought nothing of it then switch to short circuit being non the wiser
It is worrysome that a lot of his private videos got public. You never know what kind of things people could find in them, probably a lot of private information
Loads of channels got hacked, you'd think that YouTube would have alarms in place but keeps happening. Just like the comment spams with the "it's finally here" linking to a video
Videos are 100% not deleted, they are set as private. I've been through it.
Louis has gotten so braindead these days he can barely talk. sad  But hey.. he's a millionaire. He doesn't care. It's understandable. He's covering this because it's easy cash
Short Circuit, Mac Address, and most importantly ChannelSuperFun are still up!
Ow that's why I saw the Elon musk video in my subscription list I thought it was already strange
Shit.  We outsource development to India.  The 2nd leading scam country in the world, and every U.S. based company just GIVES them data..... we need to stop outsourcing tech work.  If companies want to hire Indian developers - BRING THEM HERE.
You’re telling me that they didn’t really have Elon on there pushing a crypto coin???
Scammers are dumb. It’s a channel full of tech nerds. Like anyone is falling for their crypto scam. If they are they should unsub from LTT.
I can sell him some anti hacking tools
Been a minute since I’ve watched the Lu.. what happened to all his energy did he have kids? Lol sleepy Lu
still waiting for my iPhone from the giveaway
lol how could u trust a tech channel if they themselves cant make sure not to be hacked? I mean if it was a car channel or something other then Tech tips channel
Well thank god for valt new valt new new valt aka petabyte project
Poor Linus 😭
Google saves ALL data including metadata like likes, comments etc. Linus has said it when he last got hacked.
Hope linus will take data security seriously now.
The main issue is that google doesn’t authenticate when changing passwords or YouTube channel names. The malware can grab a cookie and change everything that matters without actual authentication. It’s just not secure.
Meet girls from Ukraine :D
Elon vs Linus
Tesla had the same hack
Where is the hacker I WANNA FIGHT BACK, TAKE DOWN THE HACKERS ONE BY ONE NOW
This is shocking my favourite YouTuber gone
That explains why I got so many Elon notifications at work.
mac address too
That emoji means sigh basicly
Man this video was uninformative, slow as hell, and boring. No wonder I unsubbed years ago.
Linus just got content to make videos on…
Dead pan face
You could have messaged Linus. Would have made more interesting video.
It always has something to do with Elon Musk.
This is a big black eye for LTT. You’d thing a channel like that would have procedures in place and have employees savvy enough to prevent this. It’s not LastPass bad, but one has to wonder what level of scrutiny LTT give to things that come into their shop.  On the heels of their “breakup” with Anker over the cameras, they don’t look that good. The Anker thing was odd because that is the sort of claim that they should be verifying. If they are just reading glossy’s and telling you how to set it up, what are they doing?
I think I want to YouTube content creators need to get together and sue YouTube.  Because it's no longer really a safe place for anyone😑
Oh no.
they use different Emails
0:30 Meet Girls from Ukraine .... yeah good ads bro!
At least we don't have to hear his whiny voice for a while.
I haven’t watched ubt for a while but lew sounds a bit sick or sad idk why
i guess its one of dennis shenanigans
Gross you made it look like you were in a call with linus in the thumbnail, enjoy your sold out dying channel
Thanks to the internet, we have access to world history and knowledge.  We all need to learn from the past, prevent history from repeating itself.  This is the TECH AGE, and people of this planet can achieve real change. So, we can now make moves to make a better future.   Remember, the people are the ones who give power to any governing body.  And the people are also the ones who suffer the most. HUMANITY is the new way of the TECH AGE.  Governments need only the smartest people available able to run.  Then get voted in by the people and governed by the people.  My prayers go out to the people in Ukraine and around the world who are suffering.  Please consider donating  BTC : bc1q4020rfdsxzvkhd0ap6mm68arwckmtl7p0ze5ka Thank you Peace be with you 😊
Anyone else feel like Lew came into this completely unprepared? A bit like he was blind unboxing a phone from a company he's never heard of... I miss the old days of Unbox sitting in a white booth.
this happened to 91-tech not to long ago, with the same exact cypto scam and Elon videos.
i saw two "tesla " channels in my list going live clicked on them and instantly un subd as i have never sub'd to tesla thought it was weird at the time, as ltt is normally at the top of my subscribed list.
I would imagine a huge channel like that would be using a Google Titan Key to protect their account, but I guess not.
It's not backed up until you restore it
As a non-Premium YouTube viewer the platform is infested with scam video ads from forex traders, Amazon eBook selling BS and more. If I see one more ad from Greg Secker I'm going to lose my shizzle. It truly is a wretched hive of scum and villainy so it's unsurprising the scammers they tolerate on the platform for nnon-premium viewers have now moved on to taking out content popular creators 😕
Yeah, it's good that he has all video data backed up, however i think the channel was only terminated, and the videos were only made unlisted or private i think. At least i hope so
What are u on ?
Love the ads Gizmodo is serving you.
It would be very interesting if LTT used this to launch their own streaming/social media platform to combat this issue
No one found this funny? Hahaha
Why is 1000 people watching this live lol 😅
This happened recently to Neros Cinema and he explained how it happened
crazy i saw that humbnail in my sub box and was like wtf is this unsubscibe
Yeah I received a notification of some video featuring Elon claiming bitcoin and ETH will soar in 2023. Didn't watch it as it seemed fake and I recall another YT channel getting hacked and the hacker sending out videos like that before!
These scams are made obvious on purpose if they were actually good you need to deal with actually smarter people instead by making it obvious they make sure they only need to deal with the dumbest of people so they do not waste time on people they will not be able to scam.
9:33 Many channels have gone down for like 2 weeks to a month month and the videos came back so... *yeah they got it backed up* the data might be useful to em(YouTube) 😅   And of course Linus Media Group has their stuff backed up as well.
That's what he gets for supporting the Chinese
I think it's less effective in calls but still somewhat well in email
Poor "Hard R" Linus :D
Tech quickie was affected.... Not that hard to figure out😊
-_- i like it too... just shows how old we are LOL
No more socks and sandals?
Jar Jar Bink’s is literally a Jedi now, so the transformation is complete and LTT has served it’s purpose.
Isn’t this like a zeroing of income for that channel now?  I mean he can get it back but all this publicity is doing nothing for his channel right now.
I'm dreading the day when one of these hackers gets in, and uses a Deepfake of the Youtuber's identity
Saw The Live And Wanted To Report It
It doesn’t have access to money right?
If those hacked sessions just get suppressed by YouTube, they wouldn’t be able to scam anyone. Why can’t YouTube just suppress them? It’ll be almost impossible to prevent a hack, but why not focus on what happens after a hack happens? It’s always the same video so just block that video or any others asking for crypto.
Distribute this message: Crypto is shit and a hellscape of con artists.  Disavow crypto openly.
That is not a hack. That was a crack by a scammer selling crypto.
Linus has backups of backups on all videos on his servers. So he will still have the videos of the ones that have been deleted
YouTube does not actually ever delete videos, they always keep them. Corridor Crew had the same thing happen last year, and they got everything back, even videos that they themselves deleted. I think during one of the last few WAN shows, Linus' talked how YouTube does not delete any of your content. All these channels, big and small, get their stuff back, no need to worry.
What about having a completely separate second channel where you upload your videos privately so if you get hacked, you have an entirely separate channel to pull from? Google and YouTube probably won’t be happy about keeping all that data stored but 🤷‍♂️
He doesn't use MFA? You'd think he knew this.
😑 closed eyes, flat expression.  It's annoyed.
I checked the hacker's site and each of their wallet addresses on the blockchain explorer... they managed to steal from the gullible audience about 6-7k USD.
"hacked"..... Yeah... Sure... Seeing as those guys are complete idiots, it was probably a password leak.
Let’s hope it wasn’t Dennis that dropped the bomb.
If LTT can get hacked... what chance do we have?
This is so easy to fix..with control versioning and change locks. It's also solves the problem of scam channels acting good then only to change over to scam mode.
I have a feeling that this keeps happening a lot lately
Yo lew this has been happening to other YouTuber like panduh who plays destiny 2 had the same thing happen
They changed the handle and name so they could claim it with another account.
Plot twist: It's a marketing plot to get "Linus Tech Tips" on trending worldwide.
Dude. I was literally watching him this MORNING. (FYI: UK Time)  What the actual f*ck?
What if this was a float plane push? 😮
Actually they changed it to Tesla at first but idk the video backup auto upload back the name changed and then the channel is banned by youtube….other channel also affected except 3 or 4 channel..short circuit,lmg clip,mac,floatpland etc. survived…I saw this in real time while watching your video earlier….  P/S : many channel being hacked lately…typically through gmail LOL..something is going on with youtube security lately 💆🏻💆🏻💆🏻  I hope the culprit charged….hacker always get away easily🤬
Future hacks with deepfake videos that look like theyre made by creator....lot of potential for huge scams in the future
This is for their April Fools... For sure.
Linus has everything backed up - plus FloatPlane. He will be fine . It's just a shame this has happened in the first place.  As someone else has said - a new video about "How to handle having your YouTube channel deleted" should be forthcoming shortly!
Ok this makes sense now because I woke up to to elon talking about crypto so I though I accidentally subscribed to something on accident but I guess that wasn't the case, really sucks.
i saw this before school
I'm kinda happy about this. These techtubers are annoying as hell.
This is From his Floatplane   " Regarding the YouTube channel hack, we are on top of it with Google's team now. Everything should be locked down and we are getting to the bottom of the attack vector with the (hopeful) goal of hardening their security around YouTube accounts and preventing this sort of thing from happening to anyone in the future.    You can expect a more detailed update on WAN Show at some point in the future. Not sure if it'll happen this week since this is still a developing situation.    The good news is that you can expect to get your LTT fix on Floatplane as usual :p    Linus"
Sounds like a job for Anthony. Man is a Genius. Please save LTT!
Your next
Hackers brought back the Unus Honus video channel, which was quickly redeleted by youtube after that incident.
This makes me want to sub on floatplane
Same thing happened to Corridor Digital
"Are the other channels affected at all ?" Literaly have an expensive iPad and MacBook direct in front of him to check it but he don't.
-_-;;
That explains the Tesla crypto scam stream I got a notification for
I think this is linked in some way to that content id agency fullscreen. Linus talked about them some years ago...
No where will I get my quick bits. But I hope it all works out
That's the "I'm dead inside" emoji
At least the hacker didn't go on his social media and make Linus drop Hard Rs.
If Linus practices what he preaches, he's got all of that stuff backed up offline. He can handle it.
CloudFlare + Ironscales + PFsense or Fortigate..
Linus's audience i would think would have more of a technical knowledge of scams like this i dont understand why someone would try the scam part of this? Also im sure Linus has a data center full of redundant storage of this content so i have no doubt he will get most if not all of it back up but it will probably take some time. Talking Petabytes of data
Linus has the petabyte. I'm sure it's all backed up.
That's what I thought what was going on in his channel lol
Probably someone inside the company installed malware on their work pc. Pretty easy to fk up whole companies by letting your employees install anything on work computers, this is why they are usually locked down. Anthony might be trying to convince linus to move all company PCs to linux now ahah
This happened to another YouTuber I watch and the hacker just unlisted/privated all their videos. It’s just pain numbing annoying to repost 1000s of videos one by one.
Those videos have been appearing on my feed for over like 3months now, and whenever I block them they keep appearing
That's the second YouTube Rammstein hacked in the last.
I am pretty sure it’s not related to YouTube security. It’s hacker get into thier local network infrastructure and finds weak point there. That’s hacker also able to upload thier fake video as well. Some kind of backdoor access.
I'm sure linus got (almost) all of his video's saved on there pedabytes servers. The problems are the view and likes that will be gone if youtube doesn't have a backup
That expression is 'unamused' :)
You're next.
I just got pissed that this tesla crap appeared in my sub window. Never would have imagined that this was what became of LTT.
Almost same exact attack happened last year to the Corridor Crew.
lew trying so hard  not to laugh
Good thing Linus saves ALL raw video data
Inside job ?
now you know that no video is really deleted from youtube
I find it funny how Google's Ai cant recognise the gray sweater Elon image and the  block it automatically..
I hope YouTube will update their security for the platform too. To prevent this from happening again.
It's toooo early for April 1st.🎉
I am sure Linus has it all backed up
I toughs something was off when those hackers posted, didn’t also happen to tesla?
I just wonder how this happen? Big tech channel like Linus should has very tight security...this probably social engineering like someone open scam email
do they lose all the revenue from the videos if they delete them? that would suck
He’s “too” big to fail so my guess is a week of tlc and they will be back. I suspect a discord bot stole some info.
I feel they’re not going to hear the end of it. No doubt I respect them but it’s embarrassing for them of all people to get hacked.
Is sounds VERY much like this hacked channel, full explanation: https://youtu.be/0NdZrrzp7UE

first!!
😮😂wtf
