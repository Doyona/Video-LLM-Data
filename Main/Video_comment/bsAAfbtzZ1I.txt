This challenge was the hardest thing we’ve ever done, mainly because it some mistakes 😅 Smash liek & subscribe for gains

I think you should've tried swimming because it burns a lot more calories than anything
братан, сделай уже нормальную русскую озвучку, а не через ии

Captian America is such a great guy mann (the blue t shirt guy)

Can you redo this but with healthy food?
0:09 respect  He eats salad and not junk food
Nausea is dangerously common in food challenges, Thats what makes it a challenge is nausea-type symptoms. Some hunger can cause nasuea if you are water fasting, excess eating and excess exercise after causes it, some food intolerances or slight medical conditions like GERD come in the way. Thats what TRULY makes a food challenge and food challenge. Prove me wrong, becuase I am not.
so you burned 12500 aka losing 3/4 a pound of fat and gaining muscle good job
Try training obliques for 30 days: beginner, intermediate, and pro.
Breakfast cosisits of diabetes
1.	Hydration (water & electrolytes) 	2.	Proper warm-up & cool-down 	3.	Muscle conditioning 	4.	Stretching 	5.	Nutrition (magnesium, potassium, calcium) 	6.	Pacing during workouts 	7.	Immediate relief (massage, stretch, heat/cold) 💡 Extra tip: Pickle juice or tart cherry juice The most common reason why cramps happen is the lack of hydartion,the lack of oxygen in your muscles which causes a toxic acid to form,overwork,muscle fatigue(muscles that you dont usually train),i was really concerned for you so i did a lot of research to find solutions to it
Bro your voice in hindi is so cuite big fan ❤

3:57 can I get the recipe for that?
I love their friendship, a dream friendship for me 😢 😊
Bro did all this and yet his watch probably wasnt even tracking his calories burned properly ,so he didnt complete the challenge anyways
i know you guys know what you guys are doing but there is research that fitness trackers are very incorrect wean it comes to showing how many calories  you burned and it can cause eating disorders and can mess with your Mentele health so for instance it could say you burned 500 calories but you actually just burned 250 cals or even more inaccurate and im not trying to tell you how to live just trying to help you guys and ive been waching this Chaniel senice 2021 keep up the good work !!!!!!!!  @Browney
14:37 what the heck
Great work guys! That was awesome, but I don't think you are allowed to drink your calories, right?
I can’t wait to do this ima be doing this but a see how many calories I can eat in one day since I hit my goal weight then I want to see how much I can gain and how long it take me to lose it when they say they was about to play football I did not expect that
Arjen is the goat the way he helped Stan was wholesome
Btw Michael Phelps used to do this everyday and the only reason it was hard for these 2 to burn 10k calories cuz they used random exercises for losing calories unlike Phelps who was swimming (training) almost all day
Where's the helmet😢😢
is it healthy ? if anyone do it daily ?   W or L
Hey just letting yall know apple watch doesn't count burnt calories correctly
Bro wanted to die in the video, his eyes and face said it all. Well played though!

Cristiano Ronaldo’s cheat meal being salad is crazy
Amazing stuff, but what's most heart-warming is the camaraderie, the 2 of you are like real brothers
Browneys worst enemy: leg cramps
No way Ronaldo’s cheat meal is salad no wonder he is one of the best or the best player in the world.
Bro pushed through what he could Push through but still had to push through that.. he is genius!
I prefer to cheat on my girl than on my calories
He's friend is a true homie

Nooooooooooooooo😢 7:56

Why not do Boxing and Swimming for burning calories?
1:18  no crap bro
🔥
This challenge just can not be healthy. Is this considered 'pushing yourself'? Pushing yourself to get sick. 🙁🙁🙁
Military time is crazy
Make all of ur video in hindi pls it's my request to u I'm ur big fan ❤
How do you not throw up?
Upload a video workout with rock
So proud of you 🎉
This is not to disrespect your work, but seing how much exercise you did during the challenge it is safe to say that even though your watches may have said 10000 cals, you definitely did not actually burn that much imo. Watches are unfortunetely known for very bad estimates of energy expenditure.
This is like running 100 miles in a day and eating enough food to have not lost any fat.
Bro likes oreos
Bro at the end he looked depressed
‏‪10:16‬‏ 😢😢❤😂😂
Why did I smell the pancakes at that 1 point
I walked 27 km in a day in Paris
Im 128kg and i did this by accident this weekend.  Went cross country skiing for 5 hours, and that was enough according to my fitbit at least.
So happy you guys made it I would have never done this
Bro really breaking limits
your awesome
the bags under your eyes by the last 4 hours was insane haha. great job
I feel your pain I’ve been working out since I was six and now I am nine I have a happy work out I lift 15 pound weights over my head dumbbells to be exact holding just the bottom I left a 20 pound weight for squats and one of your videos you use your back to pick it up you use your squat to pick stuff up because I can’t really damage your back and how you do your workouts you probably want to back as strong as possible hope this last thing helps you
Gymshark link isnt working
Congrats on not dying
no way ronaldo’s cheat meal is salad 💀💀💀😭
Ronaldo cheat day:salad lol
bro plus stop dubbing in hindi , it hurts my ears
imo the challenge is doable! you’re racing against time here, so you have to straight chug oil for the 10k calories and immediately jump into the burning it off.  its not worth it at all HAHA
The camera guy who has to keep with them😂
Wow

Dude, one question, when having cramps, why are you wearing pants. Wouldn't shorts help relieve pressure of the quads and calves?
If you burn calories while sleeping what if you just set a diet and get a hole lot of sleep in for 30 days

Totalmente inspirador Ótimo conteúdo❤
Sábado pela manhā. coloque meio copo de água e adicione nele o número de grãos de arroz equivalente aos quilos que você deseja perder. Se deseja perder 5 quilos, por exemplo, adicione 5 grãos de arroz. A recomendação é não colocar mais grãos do que o peso que deseja perder, pois a simpatia seria irreversível, ou seja, os quilos não retornariam mais.  Sábado à noite: beba a água, deixando os grãos de arroz no fundo do copo. Depois, complete novamente o copo com meio de água.  Domingo de manhã (em jejum): beba a água, deixando novamente os grãos de arroz no copo, e complete com mais água até a metade.  Segunda-feira de manhã (em jejum): beba a água com os grãos de arroz juntos. Este é o momento crucial, onde o ritual se completa.

Jesus loves you guys no matter what
That's really hard work, spent part of my youth eating about 5000 a day and burning off similar, mountains with a heavy back pack, you end up in great condition - but used to eating mountains of food. Fats and carbohydrates are probably better than sugar.
I understand why I'm obese now 🫣 because that was not a lot of food for me lmao 🤣
Ronaldo’s cheat meal is a salad??? He’s the 🐐goat 🐐

Shoot yall ate and burned 10000 calories i could never… eat 10000 calories in a day….
this is absolutely bs. Cut scene bs
Based off how they included what their bodies naturally burn without doing exercise, I can say that I consistently burn 9100 calories/day for 4 days of the week. Takes me 9 hours to burn 6300 calories through exercise and then I burn 2800 calories just naturally over the span of 24 hours.
you guys did so awesome, if I did this, I’d probably do a lot of swimming
Arjen is a really good friend bro
2:36 why he is in linkvertise

He said that 1 piece of Oreo cake have 10 k calories
😊
Well done that's very impressive. I could not even with ages of training. Quick tip even though you probably know but if you had kept extra layers on you would have burned extra calories from the heat and sweating
Dancing burns a lot of calories and Zumba! Great job you two!  Very commendable and cool of you two to take on this kind of challenge! 👏

O kra andou uma maratona e nem suou 😂
Bro said sh*t a bunch of times😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eu sou o comentário brasileiro que você procura.😅 🇧🇷
I believe, do ironman and consume gels, energy drinks while doing. Then probably you would already burn 8000 - 10.000 calories just in morning afternoon site then eat eat eat if you still have to burn go for gym walking HIIT session.
Tô chocada em qnts calorias tem nessas comidas, inspirador , obrigada ❤
Proud of guyssss 🎉🎉❤❤

Guy in the blue shirt proved why he called Captain America 💪
i feel like if you ate fast food for breakfast you'd actually be more fueled instead of running on sugar
Kilograms😂 pounds
Isto só prova que existe a força de vontade, se eles não tivessem que comer 10.000kcal eles não iriam tirar um dia todo para queimar 10.000kcal só vão queimar por que proporam um desafio a eles mesmo, se desafie que tudo fica mais fácil.

Essa dublagem tá incrível!
Great job completing this challenge but if ya'll wanted to burn more calories, than ya'll should have played futbol around the whole pitch because then it would have took more force to pass and run and score and normally play the game but this is just a tip.
Play gtag I burned 3000 calories in 3 hours it is also super fun

At the start it SAIS Ronaldo’s cheat meal is salad which just showed how healthy he is
Instead of soccer/ football you should have played rugby because it is very high intensity and good for upper lower and cardio muscles. So for your next video can you do “the hardest / healthiest sports in the world”
Good job you didn’t give up on even when it was it was hard and your doing this just for content and I’m so happy for you🥹🥹🥹😃😃😃

Hey Stan, what tracker watch and mobile app you guys are using?
He broke his ankles in soccer😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro said nuts
I have tried to turn always on the calories tracker for a day, and it record about 4000 Calories have been burnt during that duration, although I did nothing unusual 😅
Any chance ur doin this again
What's the name of the app they are using to track calories?
o, if i burn 7000 calories ill be slim fit, and they did it in a day.
Blue shirt guy built different
WELL DONE😍❤️
Bro they are in the netherlands
What’s the app he’s using?
3:13 the transition 😮
Do you have any world records
😮
Today i did a 1 handed push up
You guys forgot one of the most efficient way to lose calories. Swimming. Phelps eats and swims a lot. But for real! KUDOS!! You guys are amazing
damn 🎉
I love this friendship and brotherhood
Did you count calories you burned digesting?
but they did it before time
you only burnt 10,000 calories based on a "estimation". Calorie estimation is not accurate at all.
You are lucky you didnt get Rhabdo. this shit is deadly serious.
David Goggins would burn this much everyday🔥
what is the background music @14:35 ??
Im 11 and this man is acyually my insparation
Why was Mark Zuckerberg on there? He’s just a fake.
These guys are great athletes man
You guys are so great I love the way you guys try keep the convenient up

Well done guys
Fact:  Playing badminton at an intermediate level burns 700~1000 calories per hour :)
Olive oil would have been a really easy way to slam a ton of calories
Bgm?
😢😢
browney is becoming my fav
4 🇵🇬🇵🇬,,
the way he said protein at the pizza
Respect🎉❤  👇
Whats that app yall are using?
How is Ronaldo's favorite cheat meal is salad
sup
This is crazy, excellent work!!!  I will never be able to do that.  Just one idea, if you guys video plan allows, when you take 5 in the studio, go take a cold shower, better with cold bath with ice, but 5 mins of cold shower will speed up the passive calorie burn so much.  And that would be interesting to see as well 😁👏
Incredible job guys 🎉🎉🎉
Man this is painful
Bro I was eating burger king while watching
Why does your vdo have so many ads 😭
10:16 💀
ronaldo only eats salad for cheat meals thats why he is the goat
Respect
Ronaldo cheat meal being salad is crazy
Shredded and fat at the same time   Shredded+fat= Shat 😂😂
Which Smartwatch?
Seeing you guys with that body is just making me jealous a little bit. I'm only 19 and overweight, I just wish that I could have a gym myself but didn't have one. I only did a workout on the up and down stairs. I always gave up working out, even though I'm trying not to. Is there anything I can do to lose weight faster and not giving up?
Ronaldo cheat meal salad 💀
browney took a shower that felt so good he turned into blue shirt guy
Wow is it salad cheat meal (ronaldo)😅 Anyway keep it up ❤😊 i like the video
Doctor: how did you break all your leg bone   Him:... 9:56

Good boy and your leg is it ok man

Does cycleing exercise your legs?
why? whats the need to eat 10k calories. 😂
For some reason, I felt like vomiting when I saw you guys eat all that sugar at the beginning. Period. Anyways, Nice challenge and congrats you completed it!💪
pls give recipe for the oreo cake thing
I think the proper planning and sleep burning calories was the biggest USP they utilized which no other youtuber thought of. Congratulations
You did you!! Hat's off
song at 8:58?
Who remembers electrolyte man?
The fat Ronaldo cheat meal is a salad bro

Blue T-shirt guy sounds like Chris Evans

Salad as a cheat meal?! Athletes are wild
3:16 poor delivery guy😅💀

swimming is the best way of burning calories
WAITTTTT!  Jullie zijn Nederlands?!?! Had echt geen idee

This amount of cardio is harmfol
The guy in the blue shirt is my favourite
Great video guys ❤❤
Socery
Keep this in mind guys, it is a lot easier to eat a lot of calories than it is to get rid of them, eat better and you wont need to work as hard to get ripped xd
Idea stolen from Sascha Huber
Imagine matt stonie consuming 10000calories in just 30 mins
He has hagelslag its dutch 😮
Did you just eat breakfast at 00:16?

The fact the Ronaldo's cheat meal is a salad🗿🐐
Bro Rickrolled us in the start
The dog was burning more calories lol😂
What's the name of the app he's using?
The fact they did not even pee um......funny?
Ronaldos cheat meal is salad???
Bro forgot to drink electrolytes
You should drink juice not the water
Hello, Stan do you know an app for calorie counting
U did not burn 10000 calories
For people that are having a hard time trying to lose weight or not being able to resist eating a lot, it is so much better to eat less because you don’t have to work so hard to burn those little calories you ate. You can eat a lot of food, but in moderation. You can even eat burgers or fries, pizza but only at least once per week. If you stick to a diet for at least 2 weeks, your body adapts to the diet and your stomach decreases meaning you’ll eat less. Of course if you wanna eat more calories, you have to work 10x harder which is something I woudn’t recommend. Stay healthy ❤
9:55 that was disrespectful
ronaldo favourite food on cheat day: “salad”
This was definitely the Most ambitious Video on YouTube on Fitness. You guys nailed it... While kicking adversity in the face.
Swim if would a been a good form of cardio that might have been more enjoyable
I've seen some people do that one of em'Brodie Falgoust (1.4m subs bw)
ya'll should rename the channel Bornwey and Blue. I bet it would open more opportunities
ronaldo: cheat meal salad 🫡
Is there any benefit to this or is it just a challenge?
I had cramps exactly like that during rugby practice after I did a leg workout
8:38 deeznuts?????
eat while on the treadmil
Shoutout Eric the electric who did this WITHOUT counting the resting calories
I was honestly doubtful whether they could finish the challenge when Stan got his cramps, but congrats on finishing the challenge, guys!
great job! one thing, did you also count arjien's calories? cause if not you could have eaten and burned 10000 calories ans he could have eaten 1100 calories and 9000 calories
I GOT JUMPSCARED with the exact recreation of the thumbnail on the intro
How is Ronaldos cheat meal salad 🥗?
Losing and Gaining 10,000 subs in 24 hours...

Sorry the challenge is for one person burning 10,000  two people combined can easily burn 10,000 calories
God Loves you! Get closer to Him and get more aknowledge about God! God Cares about you and God ACCEPTS YOU! Amen! ❤
Those faces at the end did not lie, good job guys wow
What is the app your scan the food to see the calories or the protein / what do you recommend for a fat beginner? I really want to lose weight but am not motivated to and I don’t know why
Ronaldo has a salad for a cheat meal😮
"but I did finish all my nuggets with sauce" This can fit for many situation

IK WIST HET JE BEN GWN NEDERLANDS
Next time, add some sparring (boxing/wrestling/...) it burns an insane amount of calories!
"i'm a calisthenics athlete"  "THEY DON'T DO LEGS" LMAOOOO Arjen is so funny
Bro just figured out that work outs are harder than eating
This was amazing!
Soooo proud of you guysss❤
Which app he used for tracking calories
You guys should have done a cold plunge at the start of the day. It helps to burn more calories throughout the day.
You should eat and burn 1000 calories in 30 minutes
I belive this situation must be soooooo bad for the heart! It may hate you after this day :(
I’ll never underestimate the importance of stretching again
just realized eating less calories than burning more is easier if u tryna lose fat
@saschahuber
Gotta appreciate the *blue shirt guy* for helping when you had cramps 🙏
Guys you should go to the doctor
Are you okay both with many foods in 1 day
love it
Cheat food : salad😂
I knew it! 4:22
Which app he use??
i can feel the pain i can feel it
Extreem stupid idea to do this guys. You are young, so fine, but it puts lots of damage on your body…
Cam’s TV
The problem with this challenge is that healthy food have such low calories so you probably can't eat 10,000 calories with healthy foods
J
Pls reply
Hey browney what what h do you have
why?…
15:00 There is nothing wrong with cheating 🤨, with calories ☺️
This is absolute dope bro great videooo
Why not eat while you’re on the treadmill?
Then burning 10000 calories in a day and I can't even pull off 10 in a year
Ronaldo cheat meal:  Salad 🗿🗿🗿🍷🍷🍷
Ronaldo’s is salad 0:08
ronaldos favorite cheat meal 🤣
This is the best video you've made
Since bodies naturally burn calories, they were technically in a calorie deficit
Who came from shorts 👇
You two guys are like a superheroes to me. You do stuff I never thought are possible. Huge respect!
Y’all don’t have diabetes after this?
Noice
This is absolutely insane 🔥🔥
@Andrej Pvlicevic did it
Yo Ronaldo’s favorite cheat meal is salad???? Like whaaa
I am happy that they are ok
smash liek.
Ronaldo’s favorite cheat meal ain’t even a cheat meal😂
Fun Fact: A can (10oz) of honey roasted mixed nuts from Publix is 1,600 calories.
real ones know he did this challenge before a while ago
What app did they use to track all that
Nice SPOILER Will.
Can I get the recipe on that cake?
once i had school until 10 in the morning and went out with my friends after. came back 12 and a half hours with 56 thousand steps.
If i did this I'll probably die mid workout, maybe at the 1500th calorie 🤔 . What about you guys?
8000calories?? Show me the recipe
Ronaldo's cheat meal - Salad 🥗💀
are you dutch? ben je nederlands want ik zag dat je in nederland bent
Did you check your Blood sugar ?
11:20 I can smell the food or it is gist the food in the hose
Ronaldo cheat meal: Salad 💀💀💀💀
they have mad chemistry in footy
This is so unhealthy. I think these ideas should not be propogated in the society of immediately working out after eating so much junk or even normal food. In Ayurveda there is a gap of 2-4 Hours between your meal and your  excercise.  A very poor display of content
Sascha huber from austria did and succed that challange long time ago
That pancake looked delicious
that ain’t holy
What smartwatch is he using?
Woahhh.... that' s really impressive 😍😍😍😍😍 congratulations 🎉🎉
Suiiiii
I bet David Goggins was the one that started this challenge
Goggins ryly showed us what's upp
Vreet for free
You could have just slept for 10hours and burn lots
When we have so much food on bigger calorie days and try to continue drinking water, how did you guys not feel bloated? If I have a couple sips after having a lot of food I'll just bloat straight away
0:08 ronaldo’s fav cheat meal being salad is that even cheat meal 💀
I love how ronaldo favourite cheat day food is salad
After eat we shouldn't do exercise because it cause apendex
Me eating 50k calories but still not getting fat 💀
Bro,what the...? I let you once,I let you twice,but you don't correct your wrong doings! Even if some dumb guys might dislike what I am saying,IT'S WRONG to say 10.000 calories! Average people needs daily 2.000.000 calories to survive! What to do with 10.000? Die next minute..? So,lets spell it properly,k-calories,ok? 10.000k calories,not only 10.000. If it was just a person doing this...but same mistake in almost all videos,all over the media.
Have 1ml amp
incredible job guys
One slice of just cheese pizza is like 450 calories
5:15 he gave the camera a middle finger lol
it's happened to me too, hope you fill good 😊
Other guys delicious things Cr7: salad💀🥗
Stay hydrated!!!💧💧💧
7:08 "they don't do legs"💀😂😂
Dutch accent it is
I am also a big fan
Nice video. I like it❤❤❤❤❤
Da dog
Now do that for weeks on end and you will be like a Protour rider: "The caloric cost of the Tour de France is massive. The average 150-pound rider will scorch between 5,000 and 8,000 calories a day while racing more than 2,100 miles around France in 21 days."  Freak athlete territory.
Arjen can even do flips damn!, is there something he can't do?
Good job guys ❤️🔥
No doubt your body didn't have time to digest all that food. Eating all that food and working out almost all day. Only going wreck the body and strain the heart.
Craaazy

This man was born to be a thumbnail
As an Indian I m thinking of what gaurav taneja while cycling suffering from cramps but still continuing cycle must have felt in his desh ka dhoni mission
you really do deserve the subscribe well done
Nice video guys, someone can give me the name of the watch that they use in the video? (thx a lot)
Burning 10k kcal would take a continuous effort at 486.11 W for 24 hours straight, so it's probably fair to say this is utter bullshit.
Oh no.. that's not how calories work
Imagine delivering a pizza at 3 and see a guy shirtless and wet 😂
@aradseyedin did it
Goated af
We can hop on our first cycle for about an hour. They're on steroids. I knew it😂😂
i tident know it existed a 10k caloris cahlenge hav only haerd of the 20k chalenge
I have one question... I am 60kg and my friend is 100 kg we go for 10km running so we burn same calories or different 😅
Hey

Yo browney kan je me helpen met een sixpack krijgen. Ik kan goed engels
one of your best ever video', i bet you could burn more calories if you play frizbe
Honestly I'd love to know what was in that food his gf made for him, cause 8k calories is crazy
“Holy shit! He’s burning more calories than us” is hilarious
These two are actually such awesome friends its heart warming
He rickrolled us
Amazingggg

Great excuse to eat 10000 calories
Ronaldo’s favorite cheat day meal being salad says a lot about his discipline 🐐🇵🇹

@SashaHuber thit this Challange bevore

Erik the electric tried twice and succeeded,  but man it wasn't easy.
How the heck did you add all of those calories and track the exact amount that you burned and ate
Do anyone know the name of the  watch and the app they are using?
GReat jo guys but the average american does half of this challenge every day lol.
What's that app called? I need it
bro took dirty bulking to the next level 💀💀
Isn’t it called soccer, do people still call in football in other countries
This is insane respect for both of you and cherry on cake is you complete 10000 calories burning and eating at same time   Hats offf to both of you 🎉🎉🎉🎉
They just had a avg American's breakfast
I thought they weren't allowed to eat and workout?
❤
Wouldn't have it  been easier if you ate the entire brownie-cake they got in the morning (4000 kcal each)? maybe you wanted the challenge to be "authentic" though... good video
Absolutely insane!
No way bro congrats
Congrats dude that was some amazing work
you gotta give this video a like man
bro is called browney and he is not even black
11:03 Okay lets settle this, if stans your favorite like this comment, if Arjens your favorite reply to this comment! come on team arjen!
Good experience boys 😁
Yea i agree ronaldos favourite cheat food is our diet food
Can you burn 10,000 calories and eat not for a day ?
what is the app that can count how much calories burn and how many calories gain. please tell me i wanna download it
The guy in the blue shirt is such a good friend
"There's nothing wrong with cheating sometimes... on your calories." 15:00
Okay, just like probably a stupid question. But they were playing soccer right?  Like I’m not that much of a girl, I know what football 🏈 < is that..  like am I just tripping ? 😅 or is that what people call soccer in the Netherlands?
I was literally eating Burger King when you were in the video
I did it.🥳 I hit the like button with my nose🤓
Netherlands ❤❤❤❤
They call soccor football ?? sad
You guys are Dutch! 😮 Wow
“All the time we are eating we can’t workout” eats nuggies on a treadmill

Arjern is such a good friend
eric the electric laughing in the corner

I cycled all around that beach and them roads you did I cycled from duinrell
What app is he using
First YouTuber that said football not soccer
Be a signa 😐
Could've just played some intense chess Smh.
bro tho he was olivia from baki
I feel I could eat 10k calories without problem but not burn off no way. Thats over 3 pounds of food.
You dont have the same body, and therefore you are not burning calories the same pace and way, the challenge cant be accurate😔
6:20 Dog: can I join your workout?
0:12 makes sense
why don’t you stretch out your legs when they start to cramp? it stops mine from cramping all the time. And take off those shorts in the shower 😊
You could swim, would be easier
Good work guys!!
There such good friends😎
Okay, but like why not eat nuts and do weightlifting, I think it woukd make it easier
Blue shirt guy kinda  looks like Ryan gosling
If i would ever do this challenge, i’d go with pesto. It has alot of calories for the smallest portions
Favorite cheat meal: salad made me LOL can't go wrong with reminding the world that Zuckerberg is the furthest thing from human
Bros did the Nikocado Avacado Diet and the Rocks workout routine
Just two bros having a sleep over 🥰
4 hours of sleep how did you didn't feel sleepy 🥱

Which app is this to track the calories burned?
Ronaldo is different  having a salad as his favourite cheat meal
Ronaldo always healthy
13:14 What is Walking?
Me hear ing football 🏈 but found out it was what we call soocor
You guys are just brilliant
Guys what is the app's name

How do you do cardio after eating, that's such a death trap😂
10,000
10,00
Holy shit these two men killed the challenge
I don't eat 😨
You should repeat but eat healthy food only
I love the part when they are doing the beach exercise and then the dog burned more calories then them, there reaction made me laugh: “ Holy sh#t the dogs burning more calories than us!”
Imagine if you had eaten good food throughout this, you would’ve eaten way less calories and probably felt better during the workouts so it’s safe to say you would’ve lost weight.
tell me one thing how the f does that browney have 8k calories.
Heel toffe en inspirerende video's. Maar waarom wordt het borsthaar steeds afgeschoren?
Brebe you ere l yas what fey reb y l yellow

Why don't do sauna? You won't feel cramps

The fact that Christian’s Ronaldo’s “cheat” day consists of salad is insane 😂
I am a chalistenic athelete and I train legs,am I a weirdo?🤣🤣Anyways good job guys on this one,I agree with you this challenge is so damn hard,I think this challenge is meant for a runner or a boxer tbh

whats the app called that he uses to track the calories burnt
Ronaldo favorite cheat meal: salad🐐🟥🟩
That cake was 8,000 calories!!! If they just ate 1 and 1/4 of that cake each over the 24 hours then that would be the end of the video.
What means cheat meal "salad"
8:37ayo what
Is that Apple Watch? 🍏⌚
ronaldo: salad is not a treat meal it healthy meal
lol i'm 12 and i almost weigh the same.
You know what...I'm going subscribe to you, you rally deserve it. Good job.:)
a muay thai and mma session would help you burn more calories easier, but i guess you guys did it on your own style which makes you, you, congrat on completing the challenge
8:38 diz nutz
You the best I support you❤
Atlas ki cycle foreign me 😂
this is insane
0:45  lol
45 kilometers is absolutely insane. Good work lads that is mad impressive
"holy sh!t he's burning more calaries then us"   caught me of gurad
Random mi yt tohle video nabídlo. Hodně hezký content na 19 subs. Jestli tě to baví, tak to toho klidně pushni, začni tvořit pravidelně. Vidím potenciál! 🎉
I thought it would take a screenshot
Ik denk dat ik jou mischien in de appie zag
Smart watch not show correct of calories count
Soooo pointless
I've walked 50k steps almost daily for a month but I only did that and a 100 pull ups
GReat content
Ronaldo's cheat meal being salad💀what does he eat on a normal day
it did damage
7:12 "they dont do legs"  real bro  💀💀
They motivate me so much to work out and to not give up
ik loop elk jaar de kennedymars van 80km dus doe burn 10000 kcal challenge 1x per jaar hahah
https://youtu.be/OnDEDfiFYJw he did it about 5 years ago😢
Look at the German Fitnessyoutuber Sascha Huber. He does it🎉
swim like 5 hous also burns a lot
I think if you eat bananas you don’t get cramps as much because of the potassium
Damn that’s so gnarly!
also no joke, i finished watching this video at exactly 23:46 creepy aint gonna lie
bro.. good job.
I was thinking that this challenge reminded me of some thing you have done earlyer and it was the 5 hour workout challenge from two years back. What do you think wich one was more difficult? Even tho with out a doubt this one was more painfull.
You two are some great people to look up to not because you're just shredded and you have really good habits but also because you have a good manners which not a lot of people  notice
❤🎉
Amazing
The  wiener dog
this is what my video game character goes through daily
what is the name of the watch
" Invisible calories " 😂😂😂
There's no way the app counts calories on beach correctly
You couls of just eaten 10,000 healthy calories
can we get recipe video for the EIGHT THOUSAND CALORIE CAKE
Bro ate breakfast at 1am 😂😂😂
It’s sad that there are ppl who do this without burning the calories
I love it bro haha amazing
The altimate bulk day
Arjan is a amazing guy and friend ❤
You guys should have jumped rope. It's a fun cardio that burns a lot of calories. I've burned 1k+ in 1h30 hours.
Stan and Arjen, you are both certifiable.....but absolute respect for completing this challenge and the many others. Great vlogs, thanks for the entertainment you both supply. Normally watch with my 500 calorie breakfast.
can anyone help me out? so i know that there is an average burned calories for both male and female without exercising, but i found that mine is lower. and im not sure if its because that the average is meant for like americans or anything, and im not sure if its because my phone doesnt track me properly or if its my metabolism and such. i tried to track myself as accurate as possible for 2-3 weeks, and i found that i burn about 1200-1300 calories when my calculated said i should be burning 1500 at rest. i know the difference isnt that much, but i think it would have helped me stay motivated if i saw results because i did calorie deficit and i exercised and also went for my training club for martial arts
Next try it again but eat 10,000 clean calories
1.5L of olive oil is 10,000 calories
haare
Are we not going to talk about him taking a shower with his underwear on 😂😂😂
Ronaldo eats salad in cheat days omh 💀
this would have been easier if u did swimming
What's the app they use to track their progress
These guys deserve at least one like..PLEASE 🥺🙏
Working out wouldn't be a problem for me, the problem would be eating. Man I can't even eat 1500 calories a day, I am pushing so much to eat 1500 calories but sometimes I end up with 1400. You guys did a great job. But don't ever forget to get your electrolytes again this kind of heavy cardio unless you really want to die.
You gained weight coz of the food that turned to to shit in your stomach when you poop them out you’ll lose that extra weight
0:08 wtf salad isnt a cheat meal huh?? i guess cristiano ronaldo dont take no cheat days always on the grind
I watched the video of will and the one of fazer, both were pretty close to completion but I'm glad u guys got it done
When they say they hop on the first cycle it sounds like something else
That shower relief was visible on his face😂❤
Waar is oma restaurant niet in Amsterdam
imagine a person's cheat day being a salad
Well done
Koos still looking shredded. Way2Go dude!
Lekker bezig boys
I think it would be awesome if you did a challenge where you intentionally gained weight/fat for two or three months so that you were overweight and then just worked it all off.
I don't think that food was 10000 calories
"I feel like i pushed through, what i could push through and now i have to push through it " 🔥
please train the legs you have to i know that you hate the legs but please
i know you are a calisthenics athelete but please train the legs i love you btw

This seems very dangerous. Glad its over. Love your videos but dont risk your health bro
blue shirt guy is an actual monster

This is the best Apple Watch add
Good job
Nice
How does eriktheelerctric feel after his challenges I wonder
as a girl, with your videos, you inspire me and motivate me to get the results i really want when it comes to my body <3 thank you!
You guys should try and complete 100,000 steps in a day or something similar. Another YouTuber tried this challenge and wasn’t able to complete it.
You have basically cheated through the day, cus you have to eat 10K and THEN burn 10K.
How is koos?
Make your brother do the 30 days transformation💪💥
You guys are motivational and i am doing my own transformation i am doing it a year and today is the 7th day so one week in

I am trying to make my skinny arms bigger with bodyweight but i can't because I can't go to gym because i am 14 year old please help
What time should you  do push up brownie
Arjen did not take a cold shower for the first time in your videos
Today (5/23/23) I tried to burn 10,000 calories in one day! I was so close to achieving it I was able to burn 9,050 total calories over 7,125 active calories   This challenge is no joke
That burger king probably came out the other very runny 😂💩
I think he mightve had a sugar crash **maybe**
You should do a cheap vs expensive dip bar
If you cycled at 40 km/ hour for 12.5 hours it would be approx 10,000 cals burned
michael phelps diet video plssss its 12000 calories
Hi Browney, great content as always. Every time I watch one of your videos in your gym, I fall in love with your Tunturi full Smith machine.  You have created a spectacular space over there.  All the best to you, and keep it up.
You people seriously think you burned thay much calories measured by a freaking wrist watch omggg
Please
Can you help me to get muscle
do you live at lelystad
Wil je een keer een Nederlandse video maken
Bro i traind fr 2years but i dont have any muscels what should i do plz tel me
It would be very  interesting to see this being done with mostly 'healthy' foods or at least taking macro's into account
what do you use to track the calories burned is that an apple watch or some other device and how accurate is it?
bet they puke
You guys are insane!! I am starting my workout journey any tips?
I think this video really shows how such good friends they are, good job guys 🎉
@ErikTheElectric
A good and fun "workout" would be to dance, just play Just Dance with your friends if youre feeling bored
Wait either my fit bit is stupid or this is easy one time I looked down and already burned 20k calories??? I didn’t eat that much tho
Browney you guys should do the super sayain  challenge
gg
Can you guys try one punch man workout routine in 30 days. Love from Denmark🇩🇰❤️
So that's how it is, even if you consume and burn the same amount of calories you would still end up gaining weight. Damn!
As a cyclist i truly know what you feel when your legs just completely cramped up, keep up the good work!
whats the app you used to track how many calories you lost.
Are you dutch
Respect guys
I have the same dumbbells at the beginning of the video. It comes in a big case with 2 bars, 4 3lb weights, 4 5lb weights and 4 gears to hold them in place but the case didn't come with at least something to tell us how much the bars weigh.
Respect ✊
Play some gorilla tag and burn calories easy
the cramps were caused by electrolyte imbalance from all the food. 😔
I hope I can meet for a long time and still want to meet you, cause every PT i worked with were careless and care just about money, but you would make me what I wanna be
Ronaldos cheat meal: SALAD
Browney where can I find that book that you made on bulk  and  cut
just amazing guys, an inspiration for all
zijn jullie nederlands
Stan gaining 1 pound makes sense since he had to drink tons of water to not cramp, but Arjen gaining 3 pounds? It makes me wonder how his body reacted. Maybe it held on to food because it thought he was fighting for his life. Maybe inflammation? The accuracy of the watches may be off possibly.
Why does everyone who does this eat shit food. There are high calorie low volume whole foods .
whats the app called that he used
Transformation Challenge me! a 36 year old with a dad bod haha...I can but dream!
First video watched after subscribing...really enjoyed it🙏🏾👍🏾🫡
Je woont in Nederland maar ben je ook Nederlands?
Does anyone know the app they were using to track the amount of calories they burned?
eril the electric did It hhhhhh
its funny that you guys have run a whole marathon and i get a suggest video of yours with a tumbnail that says: i will never run again 😅.
Can you do workout video about tennis
Hey browney, i really like your videos i have a challenge for you. Try to get better at planche or stradle planche for 30 or 90 days🔥🔥🔥. Do you accept the challenge?🤔🤔
What watch and app are you using for calorie count and is it close to accurate what other technical equipment do you use
dream breakfast 1:17 it says its 00:16 or 12:16 HMMM??
Bro amazing 🔞  How did you pull that off my man 😂  Teach me your way my warrior😅 How can I DM you to get some tips ❤
can u guys make a vid on how to make those browneys? or just a coment? Im a skinny guy trying to gain mass.

I’m gonna try this challenge, good job guys
2023 May 20
Sascha Huber did it
Nobody gonna talk on what ronaldo cheat day is ?
Be with Jesus
Damn the editing and filming is insane
I am a nurse in the USA. I hope you guys on the channel know about a condition called rhabdomyolysis. It can occur when you do repetitive and intense exercise. Basically your muscle tissue is damaged, goes into the bloodstream and travels to the kidneys. When the small bits of muscle hit the kidneys, they block the tubules in the kidneys and can cause long term kidney damage. Pretty rare but you're the population to get it. But I love your vids!
Good job with the challenge!!!! What app are you using for tracking the calories burned? Is it built in into the SmartWatch?
OK, so I'm only three minutes in and my first question is who is open for pizza at 3am?!
Cristiano cheat meal is litrelly salads💀
david goggins would be proud
7:10 that hit me outta nowhere 😂
Jesus Christ Loves You All So So Much!!!! <3333
14:10 ok you both ate 10000 cals each or 5k each😂
Got to like the commitment
You've got my respect! 🏆
you guys give me a lot of motivation to do excercise
How long do you think you could get a six pack  not using a training app  ❤ love your videos and you  made me workout ❤❤
when everything is broken, its important to "eat deez nuts"
bro the pic of him was so muscular until the video started
Some random guy who's wife is named calories "So it is okay to cheat eh"  This is a joke btw
I am 9 and I am 27kilos is that average¿
Try the David Goggins 4x4x48 challenge
your not right because sascha huber did it already
lol
What is app caled for counting calories and spending calories?
Go train with @William_le
Love you bro
Love you bro 💙💙💙💙
And do you think blue shirt guy will start a YouTube channel please let me know
Hi Stan just to let you know you inspired me to work out and thank you
nice
Are you a Christian
Ist misschien een leuk idee om mee te doen aan special forces?👀
did you count the calories your body waste to process all the food? it is probably around 1500 calorie to process 10000 calories
Mark Lewis did it easy, he had a different approach
You were feeling cramps in your legs bc you probably dont drive bike every day,and buy better buke like MTB bike and learn some tricks
I have same backpack as guy in blue
The play here is to drink calories 😮😮🧋🧋
4:22 i knew it, not natty anymore
What watch do you wear?? I need it...
Bro eatin what I eat in a whole day in an hour😭
the other guy did it like it was nothing... he is my role model now
It is funny how they started looking good and at the end they look like crap. Maybe it is not a good idea to do this challenge - you know crappy food and a ton of over exercise.
Amazing but wasn't it supposed to he 10000 calories each?
If you have cramps anywhere you should stretch
Eerste video die ik van jullie zie. Had al het gevoel dat jullie Nederlands waren in het begin. Maar dat gevoel klopt dus ook. Raar dat je dat zo snel door hebt haha.  Maar leuke video man! Goed gemaakt.
guess u dont know about ERIC THE ELECTRIC
Nice
very nice video
What app is that?
Try doing it every day for a month
Guys did you get those dayum Zits lol, what a insane mindset and great job guys .
Its crazy how calorie dense that junk food was, 1000 calories for 1 brownie??? When you look at the calorie content of real food 1000 calories is hard to eat, thats a full large meal that fills you up for half the day...don't eat junk food people, you'll feel a lot happier and more energetic.
- Sascha Huber joins the chat
When you started cramping up super badly the first thing I thought was "take some magnesium and down some electrolytes". Glad to see you knew what you were doing haha.
Eating 10k dirty calories is easy af. Now 10k active calories is a different story.
I cringed so hard every time u did the pendu celebration
I think this video really shows how such good friends they are, good job guys 🎉
Wer you cyceling on the veluwe
What’s your 4 favorite work out for the summer without a gym?
can i know what watch u wearing for checking calories burn
Just thinking about all these people that have done these challenges... I think Will Tennyson did a mixture of weight training and cardio, but most of the time your biggest calorie burns come from weight training since you are utilizing more muscle groups. If you did a weight training session for at least 10 hours with 800 calories per hour it can make it easier for you. Eating lettuce before the challenge starts can also help expand your stomach and consume more of the calories. Lastly, sleeping more would double the amount of calories burned since we burn roughly 800 calories per nights sleep... just some thoughts if anyone wants to try it that way
Arjen looks like captain America ❣️
Can u Collab with the calisthenic king Chris heria ...this video get the most views ....and the greatest ever...🎉
14:40 Yo it’s 1146 rn exactly the same time as when he said 1146 😮😮😮
This is stupid. Don't do it again. Don't hurt your bodies over this. Don't trust what influencers post online
This is awesome but what alot of nonendurance athletes don't realize is that you need sodium to do long endurance events like cycling. Carb/electrolyte drinks are crucial
Awesome
I started working out a few months ago and I have come to this channel for almost all the tips to get jacked!
Apalling
Broerrr respect
Shout out to mark lewis for completing this challenge
i've done it! 23 hours on the bike in thailand, 500km, stopping minimally just to buy food and drink, putting it on the bike, then keep cycling. 23 hours, was blacking out by the end almost lol. not the best, but lots of soft drink, sugar, bread, simple foods, no choice when you want to get so many calories in!
Amazing❤❤❤❤❤❤
omg more people really are  trying this this is gonna be interesting just hoping youtube actually recommends them like this one lol im surprised noones tried changing their sleeping schedule for this and just try to stay up 24 hours seems easier lol so many comments the they dont train legs joke was funny af xD  and this shit is proof fast food is better over their then americaa burgerking sells loaded fries????? wth lol
Massive respect to you to continue going through the pain , you didn’t have to but still did which shows your true discipline
Nah these 2 have to be on the wind up 😂😂😂
Who are these 2 buffoons 😂😂😂😂 what has YouTube brought up
you the tresor cereals of Kellogg in Italy are called Krave btw perfect video😅
Matematically lying
Wow damn guys you’re on fire!
Drinking water during your exercise or work out is it good?
really impressive but i though when will tenynyson did it he didnt count total calories and it was only active calories
Arjen is such a great ouen
I liked that shower transition
The other Youtubers did count only active calories! So you probably burned 7500 calories
Amazing work guys!
13:25 He really pulled out the depressed kid outfit bro, like look at his face from 1:25 to 13:00 is insane.
Try listening to some music 🎵🎶
Bit weak
Kan someone drop the recepi of the oreo cake from 3:56
The German YouTuber Sascha Huber has done it too
I eat less than a 1000 calories a day and walk over 5 hours a day and I gained weight. I'm very annoyed
I did a mini version of this with about 1500 calories without counting in RMR. Had to walk for 5 hours and roughly around 26 KMs around my town. Let's just say my upper glutes and calves hated me the next day. Also something about hydration; I drink roughly 4 litres of water every day but on that day I had to drink 7 litres of water, 3 in that 5 hours period and a glass of water with a pinch of salt before starting. Hydration is important folks.
Why not get your calories from healthier stuff?
There is nothing wrong with cheating sometimes...  (realises)  On your Calories.😂
What is the name if the app? 2:52
Has leg cramps -> goes to play football
Blue shirt guy and red shirt guy can do anything

Waar woon je in Nederland
Well done! Huge respect for you guys. Next time you could try swimming, that burns a lot of calories 🔥
Gamer
Epic
Woah
Cool
Football? That looks little more like soccer to me
Next day’s going to be the best rest day of their life
@Browney I want to get a 6 pack fast, how should I go about this, I already am strong and I’m not fat, do you have recommendations?
It’s so weird watching people eat stuff I eat on a day to day basis and be so scared ab what’s gon happen and I’m looking great
yall are absolute animals. amazing job!
Bros are gonna have a massive constipation after this...
Brian Shaw would easily burn and eat as much as both of them combined😂 Strongmen are machines powerd by food
I love cycling, but somehow I always manage to cycle against the wind both ways
4:23🤨🫵
Sasha Huber made this challenge
3:00 PLEASE! TELL ME the Man on the right is Polish ? XD coz the accent is suspicious
👍
lekker gedaan mannen
hopefully this is eye opening to everybody about how efficient the body is at burning calories and using energy…it’s nuts
I’m pretty sure all of Rihanna’s days are cheat days… especially after watching the Super Bowl…
Browney do you think I could ever be in a video with you?! I have been working out for the past 3 months and it would make me so happy you and my brother inspired me to workout PLEASE
Awesome workout
Sascha Huber has also completed this challange
ErikTheElectric did it!
When bro said u burn calories in ur sleep... 😴💤💤
I would love to see browney attempt to burn 10,000kcal again but this time having proper nutrition. And also just to keep having the challenge aspect, burn 10000kcal in 20 hours
bro do a 10 days weight loss and showcase the progress
Craziest challenge ever
Where is our boi Sten?
When you need to up your insulin sensitivity, alternate between  holding your breath and panting.  Holding breath- forcess your body to function with higher CO2 in the system. Both releases more oxygen from the blood, and trains your mitochondria(?) To be more efficient with it. So Fat is given priority for oxygen.  Panting removes all the CO2 from your system. With no CO2, your blood will not release the oxygen. Thus your cells will actively use their glycogen(sugar-carb) because it has oxygen, thus release CO2. And get you oxygen from the blood.  Alternating between these states, will make your cells very sensitive to insulin. Thus less heavy.
To be honest I have very much respect that you have been willing to face this troubles and eat the whole day and only train the whole day haha ❤ at browney what I have seen arjen is fine if the road goes long you need to train more for the long road king only then it’s creating health
Congratulations ❤
"There is nothing wrong with cheating sometimes" 💀 Nah no way bro said that
Wait, who tf delivers pizza at 3am???
Oh gasten. Wat zullen jullie je slecht hebben gevoeld😂😂. 10k calorieen als man van 80kg. Respect
Well done guys! Proud of you both 🔥🫡💪
When you have leg cramps press your thumb in your leg hard against the foor. Trust me I am saying this with expirience
This is crazy, at the end it even looked like Arjen was going to cry at any moment
next Challange, look like your profile pic. No offense but you have gained some skin.
hahaha je eet gewoon bij oma toos daar werk ik
Huh?
So what does it look like to burn 10.000 calories with 'normal/healthy' food intake
Rhabdomyolysis is prolly what you had bro with the cramps be careful that can be quite dangerous. Had a friend go to the ER for that during a wrestling camp.
I'm waiting for "I got my dog ripped in 30 days".
The guy in the blue shirt is a beast.
A good calorie burning sport is wrestling. You should try it sometime
I love how Cristiano Ronaldo's fav cheat meal is a salad
Good job Browney
Is anyone else wondering how they got pizza delivered at 3am?
This is one crazy challenge 🔥🔥🔥 we gotta do what we gotta do hahaha! Killing it bro!
Proud of Y’all all the way from North Carolina!  Also, I totally understand how much pain you guy’s felt with the cramps and feeling nauseous and like crap 😢  NEW VIDEO CHALLENGE: Period cramp simulator WHILE Working Out!  Thoughts? Plus, I think you guys might gain some understanding of what people with uteruses go through sometimes!:)  IDK just sharing my thoughts:)💪🏻👊🏻💥🤭
In the mast few years Ive developed a disgust for trash food like that. When you put the chocolate milk in the cereal I gagged so hard I almost vomited.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Just drink olive oil or somethin 🦧
as an Australian its crazy to see people riding bikes without a helmet lmao
so cool
I find cramps are best gotten rid of with a lot of sugar, calcium, and water
That’s crazy, good job
Its easy to calculate calorie intake, but calories out... well...
Shred your brother again
Sergio Peinado, Spanish Fitness Youtuber basically made it years before you guys
8:02 boob grab 😂
We'll summon @eric the electric ⚡
Poor Stan! When you were having cramps I was really afraid after seeing that British Youtuber who had crazy cramps after finishing the 10 000 kcal and thought he would die. But good job completing this challenge, so impressive!!!
I can't believe you two guys went through all this for the challenge! And Browney ,drink your water!
Huh. I know 52000 steps is alot but during hockey season I was training for like 6 hours a day and got like 40 000 steps
dont workout immediately after your meal..bro this is something bad for your stomach.dont promote shits for the views
I am new to fitness, what app can I use to count my calories?
Wow ronaldo "cheats" by eating salad this guy is the definition of professionalism
Congratulations guys 🎉
10k Challenge everyday? 😅 The eating part could be a little be easier if you would have drink soda. Some hidden liquid easy kcals Respect for completing the challenge!
These guys are insane but great video
it was looking impossible I can say... and Arjen looked like totally done at the end
What happen to listen to your body talk? 😅
Hafthor Björnsson calls this a normal day ^^
Respect man!👊 I did this challenge last year (Video on my Channel) and it was also one of the hardest challenges i´ve ever done!🥲 keep doing the great work!
Change the thumb background to probably some fast food stuff, maybe its just me but I wasn't too compelled to click the vid.
"there's nothing wrong with cheating sometimes.. on your calories" the long pause between that
Sascha Huber did it too
let matt stonie eat 10k calories in 35 minutes and then the rest of the day is his
I regularly enjoy your content, but this was just dumb😅 Like it's harmful, your body is obviously saying don't do it, and you know you got the mindset to do it, but come on, this is just wrong. You literally achieve nothing with this challenge. Not hating on it, just missing the point I guess
You don't have a 6 pack
Sascha Huber did this 3,5 years ago 😮 https://youtu.be/tBYqYJpTLS4
your whole channel is a motivation. Love watching yall
Omg your eyes were so buffy
The crazy brother 😊
Wow
Awsome. Crash it
AT THIS point you are risking your health over some stupoid challange, you are cramping and yet keep going?????? You should be smarter than that
this diet is me at 4 am from a night out
Its amazing how you do this
Are you from the nederlands?
Well done
Whatta video❤
Awww browney gets his first Charlie horse. All you really have to do is drink water, stretch it, and eat some potassium and you should be fine within a day
7:09 he kinda true tho
Sascha Huber completed the Challange
14:50 your face says it all
Holy s**t he’s burning more calories than us to the dog😂
i challenge you browney doing muscle up for 30days results are crazy 😮 so do mucle up for 30days
Erik the electric laughing in the corner
And this is why Leon edwards has the most aesthetic physique
this are in the netherlands lekker hoor
If u do cardio on a treadmill put an 15% incline. That’ll burn 2x the kcal
Thank god for the socks😂
I have played your game gains
zijn jullie Nederlands ?
WHY DID YOU PUT MAYONNAISE ON THE PIZZA?! ME CHE COSA STAI FACENDO DEFICENTE
I would’ve loved to see the weight in the morning after
left the video at 0:30 I just could be bothered.
"They don't do legs"😂
Mark Lewis burned the 10k, but failed to eat the 10k! He is one of the few to fail in this fashion.
I once cycled 543km in one day (in just under 23hours to be exact) and I burned around 14000 calories. Probably didn't eat all of them, but at least most of it.
Sascha Huber, a german fitness YouTubes has done this also, it‘s just the hardest thing!
did he put mayo on his pizza?
Such Commitment! Browney is able to maintain his body shape but there is noticeable fat gains while captain america seems to get more damage, it doesn't really help them...  Moral Lesson: Nothing can stop you if you give your hundred percent and Keep in mind that too much won't help and don't forget to stay hydrated...
Okay but can we just talk about what a supportive and caring friend Arjen was when Stan's legs cramped up?
An Austrian Youtuber with over 1 mil subs has completed the challenge a few years ago his name is Sascha Huber
Sascha huber did it man💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
zijn hun Nederlands
Browney I'm working
What app are you using?
sascha huber
Sasha Huber:,, Hold my beer“
What about ErikTheElectric 🤔?
I'm sorry, i'm just pausing to comment 9 seconds into the video HOW THE FUCK is salad a cheat meal?!?
Hats off to you guys who did the impossible
0:08 Favorite cheat meal...salad??? Someone teach this man how to splurge!
Damn, ive had that intense leg cramping happen to me before. Could not bend my legs at all for a good 5-10 minutes. Pro-tip, dont go snowboarding down a several hour route when youre a newb 😂 Also Gatorade is a life saver 🙌
You had to wat salt even cramping
Great superb boys u always smash the challenge 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
you are german, arent ya
Sascha huber did3 it
13:03 is pure meme template material
Never fails to entertain
Legends
also so much calories going right into a workout is really bad for your metabolism ask dietists
Joe Fazer was doing it for two days, one day eating next day burning
You counted the calories your body burns itself so technically you burned liked 8000 calories. Search for @Sascha Huber he did it without counting the calories his body burns itself.
Everyone doing only 100 pushups for 30 days.But what hapen if you do 100 situps 100 calfraises 100 pushups 100 crunches 50 pull ups evry day for 30 days?
Crazy challenge. But well done for getting it done!
|_o_|    |  |
smash liek
You actually did it that's insane
Ronaldo cheat day is salad 😮😮😮
Can we get the recipe for that Oreo brownie thing. Gonna put bulking in easy mode
0:45 What the fish?!
*You are what you eat* and this video is an example of it. 😊❤❤❤
Hop on on our first cycle🤨
@chriskogias
Nice challenge
5:37 you hopped on ur second cycle?
after this kind of challenge you should make a clip of how you fell the next day
Is it 10,000 kj or kcal? Always wonder this in these challenges
I think this is also a good video for showing the importance diet has on how much you enjoy working out. A lot of people hate working out, but it's probably because of how it makes them feel and how much they can do, and they're also probably eating not the best food though, this just goes to show that even super fit people will feel like crap even from half a day of eating trash.
❤❤
im 64kg and ive been trying to lose weight any tips
Bro How to lost water wiegth?
I am so happy at this part in the vid 9:37, Browney calls it football and not 'soccer'
Sascha huber
arjen is literally a legend.
Greg Doucette is filming a reaction video to this as we speak
If someone claims they eat 7000+ calories daily they are lying
You guys are absolute madlads! Go Browney Go Arjen!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
We will hop on our first cycle - for an hour 🤣
i'm barely 1800, sheehs i'm KING
Sascha Huber did it easily
And that’s why Leon Edwards has the most aesthetic physique
I think this challenge is fake or is there proof of it
Sascha Huber did this a few years ago, an Austrian Fitnessyoutuber
when you get traumatised cos you trained legs 😆
Honestly I liked the blue shirt guy in his old form lean and shredded. He looks so big now
💪🤘
guys, its incredible and so impressive. you did really hard work
for me its an easy challenge because i eat for breakfast 1000+ calories and for lunch like 3000 or something and for dinner like 2000 to 3000 and i burn them but not all of them i burn like 2000 calories of them and im only 14 so yeah and you guys are insane keep it up
Bro Captain America's Physique Is Insane😮
I want to see someone try this for a whole month alternating days
Sascha Huber did it 3 years ago
*Sascha Huber joins the chat*
Arjen in built Different-he can get shredded and fat on same time💀🗿🗿
How are you ppl doing exercise while wearing that thick full hand hoodie?
Sascha Huber did it but i hoped for you Guys to do it :) he runs a marathon and cycled hell a lot. have fun :) Hell Yeah you Did it !  Great Work. I will not even try this but Good Job Stan and Arjen.
What app were they using to track everything?
Oh wow, well done!
Well, @EricTheElectric did this challenge 2 yrs ago and finished is successfully, and he just calculated active calories.
you did itttttt man your physique is on another level i will support you guys
David goggins will be proud
smashed it
Next challenge, eat 10000 healthy calories 😜 and burn them in 24h
Some music would have definitely helped in my opinion, the music js hits diff
unreal
It is impossible on wholefoods though. No problem with carbs.  Burning 10 000 on the other hand...oh boy
So cool
Most mind blowing part of the vid is the pizza delivery thats still open at 3am
What has happend to you. You look Stronger then normal.
Wow, that was insane. The work, effort, and perseverance is absolutely crazy. Take a long needed rest my friend!😅
The comparison isn't fair since you were both exhausted and not feeling good and could tell from the posture as well.
What's the app that you are using to count your calories burned even through sleep?
get big
Browney starting new Vlog Channel?
where did his abs go agin
no abs
Crazy you did it guys
fat
Never skip leg days Browney 🦵
Bruh what NETHERLANDS 🇳🇱. I always thought you guys were RUSSIAN 🇷🇺. and I have been watching 👀  you guys from years.❤😂
U all consuming sweet all days just to achieve 10k calories  While indian people be like eat our curry  Try indian food it has a lottt of calories
actually, Erik the electric killed this challenged
I have done 4 marathons in a week with less than 1000 cals a day do that I HAD TOO while i was homeless went thru two pair of cheap shoes too
I new you two would get it done
I'm curious - did that yak escape from somewhere, or do they just run around wild in Holland?
They literally walked a marathon and ate a weeks worth of food in one day, massive respect!
🎉 that's awesome guys
#browneyisstrong.
What app do they use for this?
based on how you calculated your calories burnt, Will Tennyson also beat the challenge!
Stan and Arjen you completed this challenge. Proud of you guys. This shows us that you both can do any challenge in the world.  You both are epic bro. ❤❤
8:38 deez nuts😂
Established titles is a scam btw
That was crazy guys, so glad that you're back with your cool videos
Jumping rope skipped the chat👀
What app did they use for this video
What app are they using to monitor their calories?
When you think about it they did the challenge and did the 24 hour challange🎉
Drop the recipe for that 8000 calories brownie
it's a shame that Browney is dutch but doesn't seem like he rides bicycles very often
GEWELDIG!!! WELL DONE
great one
Browney your legs and lower body are tiny. You should work on them!
Is no one gonna talk abt the camera man staying with them night/day all day long
@erictheelectric has done it
🔥
Absolute dogs
first time not seeing him in a tight shirt lol
Absolutely beastly. Well done
Hey browney quick question what type of watch do you use
you guys should have done swimming that burns a lot of calories
is it 10000 total? as in 5000 each, or was it just browney’s 10000 and blue shirt was along for the ride
0:09 That’s an intense cheat meal
Bro the dedication but these guys is insane
Bro that transition from the thumbnail
Weather they win or lose they lose because of the sugar intake
Well the best thing is is that at least you tried so good job brother browney
Does everyone remember he said let's eat Dees nuts 😂😅😅
Burger King and working out two of my favorite things
What is the name of the app you are using for how many calories you have burned
Electrolytes, guys.
Amazing job! y’all are truly super human!
This is why u stretch
Not only did this guy get insane leg cramps, sick feeling, etc. He still managed to be one of the first people to complete this challenge! This is insane. Great job!
Well done Stan and Arjen! It's crazy you guys did it!!!
This doesn't count, you have to film the whole time you eat, don't you know the hamster rules?
I agree, sports are deifnitley the best calorie burners. Outdoor heat, exercise, and adrenaline which means higher heart rate, sweat, and fat burner for extra energy
No liquid calories, you guys drunk choclate milk with your cereal
Everybody does this challenge wrong, just go to sleep really early and start at midnight without having to go to sleep again until it ends, +8 hours to work out or eat.
wow
Ayeee wassupbruh
Hií
I knnow ErikTheElectric ate 100k calories and finished the impoosibke calorie challenge
Dude they looked sick at the end
how long did you sleep after?
12k next?
I challenge you to workout like an NFL athlete in the off-season for 30 days
The work he puts into these videos is crazy and look at his face near the end browny can through though he never disappoints 💪
Whats that app they are using to track thier calories?
Bro I’m goin’ to the ring of gluttony, but this for sure depends on your weight
That's why you should drink your water!
4:25 'Alright so now were gonna hop on our first cycle'  Browney exposed
just waiting for greg. Btw congrats you did great
4:23 Can already feel the greg doucette video coming
you guys are amazing🙌🙌
Try doing the death tour (dodentocht) in belgium this summer! It's a 100 km walk/run that you have to complete in 24 hours. Each year there are 13 000 contestants, you could see how fast you could make it (and if you could make it)
POV humming bird
Y’all should’ve just swam
4:23 Browney is no longer natural 🤣
“It’s okay cheating sometimes”           on your calories
3:30 is that MAYO ON PIZZA??
id love to see a collab with will tennyson
G O A T
sooo was this the hardest challenge yet or is it still in the making?
It's caled pickle juice my boy try it
Great vid browney :)
Big respect guys! You both wanted to but didn’t give up great job and keep it up but for now get some rest! Have a great fking week everyone!
This is quite literally the only acceptable mukbang
Legend is back ❤
I lost 10,000 calories by just watching this 😂
Wow. Y’all are absolutely insane. Congrats on this accomplishment!
I like to see the Rock now and then
Jesus Christ is lord and savior, repent of your sins, the end is near
Me: 6' 4"  at 240 lbs eating 2400 calories+ and somehow maintaining the same weight.......
Erik the Electric does this in his videos
Yeah Browney can you see if you can fly me out to get to see you and workout but I’m 11 years old but I’m in Virginia
Great job, by the way, I completed the challenge one week ago. It’s on my channel 🦾
Love you videos bro, keep going! ❤
U guys are insane keep pushing
Erik The Electric did it a while ago…
you needed a banana
52,000 steps in a day? Thats how much i did as a trolley boy. I dont have that job anymore lol.
i knew only these guys could complete this challenge and they did it
Sascha Huber did this challenge and completed it
I kinda want to do the burnung 10k calories in a day part of the challenge. Epic work, you smashed that 🔥
You have to make a video with Sascha Huber. He did. this challenge Dome years ago
Bro you gotta fix that sleeping on your back
Beer and sweet Cocktails could've made that challenge a lot easier
I have a hard time believing they ran 100 miles worth of calories in one day. Absolutely nuts they tried this. Proof is in the video
Sascha Huber did it
We actually eat 2100 on average...
what app did you use to track the calories (love your videos)
Siuuuuuuu
Amazing
this is a super cool video and I enjoyed watching it but please don't push your self's like this again I like happy browney and happy blue shirt guy :)
welke pizzazaak is er nu open om 3u
Absolute mad lads.
You shouldve played chess😂
Hagel is delicious
Congrats
Lol, the amount of calories burned shown on a watch device is not accurate at all. They always WAY overestimate.
OMG 😮 your perseverance and commitment is out of this world 👏 congratulations and thank you for the inspiration! [although I will NOT be doing this challenge 😅]
The old steroid guy is definitely gonna make a video on this calling it fake and stuff
Naaldwijker lekker bezig man💪💪💪💪🪙
bro you dont burn 2200 calories in a 4 hour sleep
Sascha Huber did the challenge as well
Kunnen jullie alsjeblieft meer posten ik vind jullie video's echt leuk ga zo door
so inspiring and motivating at the same time, i feel like i should also work out for a better physique & health when i watch you guys,great content as always
arien is indestructible
SMASH LIEK
how can you guys eat 1500-2000 calories in single sitting?? after some calories my stomach refuses to let in any food no matter how much i try
Am I the only one who is eating as healthy as possible all day but eating these chocolate cereal for breakfast and ruins it but I have a good body even though my breakfast is unhealthy is all about balance guys
Hey drink some pickle juice next time you start cramping
Lol once after like a year of not having coke i was at a party and my friend already bought me a coke before i arrived it tastes so weird  i didnt finish it (the coke was $5)
So pretty much they spent whole day eating oreo and working out
my man @Sascha Huber completed it 4 years ago🔥
What tf is 14:37
One of the best videos I have seen you make nice job !
But can you guys go 15000 calories? The eating part looks way to easy :D
@Sascha Huber did it too i think
Sascha Huber so😂😂
Zijn jullie Nederlands
3:07 can someone tell me that app name?
idk i think jow fazer did it in 2 days  on day +10000 second day -10000
I still remember the day when I walked 60k steps, worked out back and biceps that day and did jogging also for 30 minutes straight without stopping and burned 7.8k calories and ate 5k calories. I was so fed up that I didn't have a workout for atleast 3 days but after that I sticked towards my normal calorie intake and workout plan since then. Thank you browney for making me remember that struggling day🤝🗿
I can easily see this as possible. Get an adequate amount of sleep previously and wake up at midnight. Eat healthy foods that contain a lot of calories. Drink plenty of water. And helps if you are a bigger guy. I would definitely recommend training the stomach to be used to working out with being full of water or food
7:08 lol
I’d say if I got back into my peak aerobic shape I could manage this physically, not sure about mentally though. I’d definitely need someone to do it with to compete with so we keep each other honest.
These guys are incredible
That’s easy I’ve done 13,000 calories a day not gaining any fat but I have really high metabolism with 3% body fat when I was bulking I ate chanko nobe 5k calories per serving sumo wrestlers eat it
This is incredibly stupid (risk of injury) but also very impressive and entertaining. Well done guys 🎉
hop on our first cycle 💀💀💀
Ronaldo's favorite cheat meal: Salads 😂
Something that surprises me about these challenges, nobody ever tries walking backwards. I'm in FAR less shape than you guys and going just under 3 miles an hour for an hour burns nearly 1k off me.
stop killing animals for your pleasures
what was that for an app
I've never seen the guy in the blue shirt struggle this much before.
I love watching you guys!
Try walking 100.000 km
witch app are you yousing
for myself 5:20
Meanwhile me struggling to eat 2500 calories a day…
Mark lewis did this too
bro its pronounced risis
Let’s not forget Mark Lewis!
Massive props to you guys to do the near unthinkable
Proud of you two bro🦍
Ronaldo houd van salade haha
Sascha Huber a German Youtuber, did This Challagne for 3 Years and made it!  But, your Videos are the best of Youtube!
Nice video. Probably easier for ultra endurance athlete to complete this challenge.
Good job guys! As a rower, burning 10,000 according to my watch isn't too bad. Hit that a few times through heavy training weeks. Eating is always the hardest part. Maybe going for 15,000 burn and eat should be the next challenge 👀
Sascha huber made It LOL
what is he monitoring with his burned calories. Do you know guys? I am interested
great video, enjoyed it very much, coudn't wait for it
Congrats
Stan browney hops on his first cycle 😳
"hop on a cycle"
Hello brownie
This is superb man🔥..Btw our secret captain america needs to be bit shredded👀 30 day challenge for him?..Love u guys❤
So proud that you guys did it and especally you Browney with all the cramps!😎Keep up the good work! both of you!
I think i would die if i tried ro do this
2 worldrecords in the back ayooo
this is like unhealthy but still healthy
if someone is skinny he can do this challenge it will make him gain weight.
What was hareder for you guys, eating or losing calories?
no ones talking about how these guys found a pizza place to deliver at 3AM!  🤣
Oatly ? 🤮
Is Arjen vegan?
Is he dutch?
At the end you guys look dead inside, outside and dying every second... What a dedication to the challenge!
The guys that failed the challenge didn't take in consideration their resting metabolic rate like you guys did.
you and the blue shirt guy is so strong
How does one let 10000 calories exit their bodies unpainfully?
1 pak chocomelk is +/- 750cals met naast alle suikers best decent macro's, bulking cheatcode
Wish I could do something like this. Lol
Me eating 3 biscuits while watching this
VIDEO IDEA. "I worked out using only static movements for 30 days". So like only planks, front levers, dead-hangs, hand-stands and so on. Very curious to see what that might to do your physics :))
Saschahuber was first with the challenge
Proud of you bro love from India 🇮🇳❤️
Mad respect for the effort put in this vid 🫡
Lol max i burn in an hour is around 1000-1200cal. That means i have to workout for 8-10 hours just to burn 10000 calories. And you still have to eat on top of that.
I started watching your videos since May 2021 and I don't regret it.
I love that Ronaldo's cheat meal was salad😂
9:35 THE MATCH CUT !!!! 🤝
You convinced me to start my fitness journey and yesterday. Hit the 1 year mark and I can now do 5 muscle ups
POOSH!!! :D
Liquid calories aren’t allowed I thought?
Might have liked that breakfast as a kid , but sickening now
yes, junk food will give you cramps, and make you feel very tired. Better try to eat 10k healthy calories and then to spend them (should be easier), and do that between the two sleeps. Start early in the morning and finish late evening.
Love the transition at 3:11
But you burned 7 thousand calories 😂 Will burned ~9 thousand but in circle not in diagram below
Legends 🙌
Music name?
My toxic trait is thinking I could do this easily, when I know in reality I’d prob fail and throw up loads! 😂
I think that if the ate good food fore the whole da the 10 000 cal wold me easyer fore them but a challenge is a challenge
Koos in great form , more vid with him
Craziest challenge ever, as a swimmer i know the pain of quads being so stiff you cant bend your knees. Well done browney mate good effort
Do an ironman marathon next
You could also have tried swimming!
I fell sluggish just by watching them
Sacha huber did it!
Doe alsjeblief de 75 dagen challenge
I made 5.1K likes in this video!
No way that tiny ass pizza was 1500 calories lmao
ronaldo's favourite cheat meal is salad LMAO
I know one guy who could do it too. Its David Goggins
You ´re beasts! Excellent content.  NEVER SKIP LEGS DAY GUYS.
After discovering this channel getting in better shape than ever ! Thanks for the MOTIVATION man!!!
Explains how i feel immediately after my junk food cravings… I have switched processed sugars with fruits and homemade smoothies with honey. And trans fats and Omega 6 with Yogurt and Avocadoes and Peanut Butter. I feel much more active but my sleep has shown the highest improvement
Browney looks absolutely dead in 14:50 after full day of grinding 😂😂😂
GOATS!
Sasha Huber the legend did it 2 years ago ❤
"Let's eat Deez Nuts" ~ Stan 2023
Great video man, i would die. I really enjoy watching your videos, i also do calisthenics and live a healthy lifestyle, I'm only 13, but you really inspired me to start my own channel and make my first video. Although I'm still quite a beginner in calisthenics and it took me a long time to learn how to even do one pull up, I'm doing more now with much better technique than when i started. I'm a girl, so calisthenics is a bit harder for me, but i don't make excuses and continue to train and improve. Thanks for your videos, you're a big inspiration. 💪🙌
See americans? IT'S FOOTBALL!!!
At this point what CAN’T you do
A lot of people neglect one of the most high intensive burning workouts that are better on your muscles is swimming. And there are many variations which also work many different muscles. I was eating around 4-5k calories when I swam for my high school team.
That pizza delivery guy probably hates u guys...
<3
Worst bit is when you realise the calories burnt estimates are way over and probably only burnt like 5k total. Try on a bike with an accurate power meter would be 150watts for 20 hours straight. (less with NEET etc but you get the jist) Not to discredit still mega effort (and its in line with what others have done probs), just worth pointing out how easy it is to overeat.
cramping almost never happens if you stretch
NICE EDITED!!! :) 💪
hi
Absolutely smashed this challenge! Nice to see you guys push through the pain
is it just me, or does everyone gets 30 second to 60 second adds every 2 minutes?
massive respect for you and arjen
The camera guys were so cool with the fact that they were filming at 3am
Wow...
@Sascha Huber did it
Sascha Huber did this one as well
Oh man! Of all the people in the world to forget top ten reasons you should "Drink Your Water"
No way the oreo cake has  8000 calories
Sascha Huber lässt grüßen😂
5:42 Looks like its probably a highland cow (they do look similar), Yaks can't survive at such low altitudes. Still cool!
Good thing i identify as poptart cause i completed this 🎉
Browney swimming is the highest calorie-burning sport and it's low impact so no cramps. It could saved you
trow up tutorial
I just want to ask about your sister is she still 69kg ?
What about 30 day oneer
dadduyyyyyyyyyy
You're videos motivate me to actually train more. If I start training regularly again so it's thanks to you guys 🙏💪
ggs browney!
Hey! Keep up the great work from the netherlands!❤🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱
Don’t forget mark Lewis 🤣
did arjen gain 4 kilos of fat?
Ik wil je echt ooit ontmoeten maar dat kan niet maar ik woon wel in Nederland Rotterdam zuid
The next day leg painssss a lot , right?
Did you cuddle?
De cameramannen zijn echt de goats van de videos, tot 3 uur s nachts filmen en om 8 uur gereed staan met eten voor de deur
You burn 40 calories per hour while sleeping and they slept 4 hours how did it go up by 1000 calories burned...
I feel like with every one of these challenges I watch, even though you guys got it done, is that the food choices always kinda suck. Everyone seems to binge on sugar and like 2000 grams of carbs and just crash hard with the cramps etc. Congrats guys, wonder if you have any thoughts on that in hindsight? For me I think the 10k calories is the easy part, so choosing foods that'll give you more sustained energy for the 10k burn challenge is important?
Hagelslag Oreos wanneer op de Nederlandse markt? 😂
btw joe fazer
I love how he still keeps wearing blue shirts only haha
Arijan sorry I spelled that wrong is so nice love to see him help browny when he wasn’t feeling good
Remember to drink water
Sascha did it...💪
gg
why did you not swim>? swimming is excellent for burning calories and more fun
Epic bro you did it 🎉😍🔥🔥🔥
your voice sounds different
Sascha Huber did it to 🦾
Just down a bottle of olive oil like DougDoug
i challenge you to do it for a week
Respect
Now it is even on my fav creators doing this challenge Will Tennyson and Joe Fazer failed but You and Erik the Electric exceeded this challenge congrats Browney and Guy in the Blue Shirt you deserve the victory
Hi browney which app you were using to track your macros
Nobody: 😴🥱😞  *Browney oploads*  Everybody: LET'S GOOO!!!!🥳😈
browney and blue shirt guys are built different!!!
dude soo good editing and cinematography
you guys should have done swimming its great cardio
Arjen weighs less right? So does that mean that he did a little less then 10k cus we only saw the stats on Stan's watch
Hat's off u guys💪👍
Bro i was so scared for Browney , bro almost became Joe Swanson
He’s a good friend he brought you food, water, and electrolytes
WE NEED UPDATE ON THOSE CATS
It's just that it's really not good for the body, take care of your body ☺But a very good video, thank you very much
Incredible, you and Sascha Huber did it!
You made eating 10.000 kcal seem so easy 😅 I always feel I can easily do that as well, but most of the people who did it weren't able to!
Fake
when you skip legday and decide to try legs for the first time. ;D
Holy shit... You guys are literally machines
Respect 🙏
browney slept with guy in the blue shirt  lolll
Joe Fazer made it into a Browney video you love to see it
Love from India 🇮🇳
Greg Doucette reaction video incoming
hi love you
Browney doing cardio at 3am to win this challenge, he didn’t have to but he did that for us
Tryna say something? 🤔 4:23
i shited myself
You did it! So proud of you guys 😢
AS Always you guys crushed it 🔥
It is satisfying to see him get better and better in English but still say Liek
I need that oreo cake recipe😂
Wait wait wait the krave are called tresor?
That’s insane!!
Browneys video keeps me motivated ❤
Now we wait for Coach Greg to upload about this
Dude what app is he using to track everything
hehe boii u showed everyone how's it done
Dude, why do you never Swim? Swimming is by far a better way to burn calories than running or bike
This would be crazy painful.    I think back in my MMA days I could def have done it now days I think Id have a heart attack lol more of a  Powerlifter atm.
First one here please like my comment browney . I love your videos and you are both very cool
I tried this a month ago and it was insanely hard, cardio was going good but got super full and nauseous so I didn't finish. But congrats to you guys, thats super impressive and I'm definitely going to try it again, mostly for the mental aspect haha
well I can eat 10k calories, but burning it in a same day is a bit difficult.
U guys are crazy fr
Respect!
But you proved you'll go that one step further and not give up, smash that liek and drink your water-especially you browney. Well done
you think the average man eats and burns 2500 calories? average man is fat.  they eat 2500 and burn 2000, slowly gaining weight until they complete their obesity journey
YES A BROWNEY UPLOAD!
Which app was being used to track calories?
nice
U guys are monsters 💪💪
Virgil van Dijk is legend
oh my
Did the guy who always told us to drink our water, drink not enough water?
Not first
4:23 exposed XD
At that cramps point you should forget a out challenge.
8:57 i almost threw my phone xD
Can you do Q&A again
Best video

Mad effort in this challenge!

Hhhhhhhh lol

Hey Browney, you inspired me to start workou, right now im just doing push ups and sit up every other day and after one month I can already see some progress. Question though: Do you really think eating healthy is so important? Ive seen machos eating pizza and burgers every day
Can't wait to see Coach Greg cover this.
if you ate yourself - would you double in size, or disappear?
bazinga already done it
Sascha Huber smashed this Challenge 3 years ago
Im alwaya one of the first expecting a  banger keep on the good work💪
Collab with Jesse James west bro that will be awesome
This challenge was the hardest thing we’ve ever done, mainly because it some mistakes 😅 Smash liek & subscribe for gains
Collab with Jesse James west bro that will be awesome
