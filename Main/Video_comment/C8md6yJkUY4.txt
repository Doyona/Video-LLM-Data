Been a Big fan since day one That was great loved the ring in a concert I went to
Four years later and it still blows my mind. I have always wondered what went through her head during the first few notes: "Oooowww ow ow ow oooowwww! Oww ooww ooww oowww ooooowwww!" 😂
I'm sure this wasn't quite as painful as it looks. Sure, probably a bit uncomfortable at times, but Lindsey is a very talented gymnast and it seems like the rope was flexible as to not force her entire body weight to be hanging from it.
Hermosa melodia, Lindsey super inspirada, me encanta.
Pretty woman
AI
Dang ! She could have done this with a harness on her chest and it would have been just as good .  But thank you Lindsey . ❤
Me encanta este video, no me canso de verlo y escucharlo. 🥰
the look of determination on her face before she begins says it all
2025!
Just wow... I remember before when you had posted you were learning to get picked up by your hair... that is crazy... AND to play a difficult song while doing it... AND while spinning... and not dropping a note... just wow... amazing... absolutely amazing! So much work you have put into this. Thank you for what you do! :0)
I'm speechless
My mouth was open for almost this whole video 😮😮😮 .......HOWWWW??? 🤔 🫨🧐
vim aqui para dizer que se pudesse dava um liko por dia nesse video, e ja tinha meu comentario a 4 anos =)
This is an absolutely amazing performance! I got dizzy just watching you spin. I don't know how you manage to play the violin with such perfection while constantly moving like that. It must be incredibly exhausting. You are a true artist and a legend!😻😻😻😻😻😻
Increíble, es toda una fantasía esta chica, súper cómo interpreta, transmite música, baila, el arte lo lleva en las venas y me hace Amar aún más la buena música y el gran instrumento que es el violín. Deseando que vuelva por España para disfrutar de ella en Vivo. Gracias Lindsey, revives mil emociones en mi cuerpo cuando te escucho y disfruto. LOVEYOU!!
Beautiful, elegant and multi talented young lady!❤
The only thing I could think of that would be more epic than this.........Rammstein enters the picture.
This only has 3.8 million views after 4 years, while some talentless mumble pop artists like billie eyelash has billions. The masses will never recognize talent.
You are amazing! ❤thank You so much!! I'm crying, watching this video

Aced in three months and on violin, You are invincible, Queen
Watch the training videos for this, she crys constantly.  This poor girl went thru 🤬 to complete this video.  Made me cry watching 😅
C'est très original !
Me he quedado alucinado al ver este vídeo ,eres impresionante ❤
The pure passion and hard work along with unbrideled and worked on talent that Lindsey has..... Its just absolutley amazing. Been litsening for over 10 maybe 15 years or so. Her constant efforts always amaze me.
❤
Every time I watch it, I cry, you are the embodiment of perseverance
👀-I've never seen such a number even in the circus! Bravo!
U did a good job but if ur doing it I love this but pls don't do it again as we don't know if it hurts
Comment 52 Lindsey Stirling, I am your biggest fan  I am commenting on all of your videos to achieve my goal and dream to have you send me an autograph
This woman deserve everything. I can't describe. She's the most talented woman in the entire world
Every time I see her do it, it makes my scalp hurt, and you could see the pain on her face. But, she was determined to do it, and succeeded in doing it beautifully as she always does.
Гениально!!!!!
Прошло уже 4 года, а я каждый раз смотря это видео, понимаю, какой подвиг Вам пришлось пройти. Такого я не видел никогда, чтобы прелдалевая страх и боль за столь короткий срок можно сделать такой шедевр. Спасибо за Ваше творчество! Апплодиру стоя👏👏🔥
Simply amazing.
Ouch. This looks like it would hurt...😲
Nice music and dance, but why the torture of pulling hair? Nonsense. I don't want to see musicians suffering while playing.
you give a reason to start, fight,  and create something so beautiful like you, are
God bless you always Amen 🙏
@ Lindsey  Stirling Wow
Awesome talent and choreography ma'am. You are appreciated.
AMAZING! DO NOT DO THAT AGAIN!! 😍
It a great performance, but I miss her smile that shows she is having fun. This looks more like all the others that combine violin with ballet. It looks quite hard to do and such, but I do miss that amazing smile she usually has.
A masterpiece playing and such beautiful dancing as I can imagine!😊😊😊😊
Today, for me, you were incredibile, you're an incredible emotion !!!
Comment elle a pas mal ? Y a qlq chose qui m'échappe ! Même si le spectacle est époustouflant
Some of the most gorgeous music I've heard
Линдси береги себя пожалуйста! По сравнению с простым обывателем ты уже многого добилась и покорила весь мир! Уже покорила, понимаешь? Жизнь очень хрупкая и у тебя ведь за плечами не одно мировое турне. Не один видеоклип требующий колоссальной физической подготовки, и много концертов с исполнением трюков... Это уже сделало тебе имя! Поэтому пожалуйста береги себя, ведь ты оставила большой вклад в культуре, искусстве и музыке... Шея может не выдержать вес тела и на всю оставшуюся жизнь человек остается прикован к постели. А хотелось бы чтоб ты и дальше оставалась здоровая, красивая, счастливая и сияла всем нам своей музыкой и дальше... Поэтому береги себя❤❤❤❤❤❤ Надеюсь что ты услышишь мой комментарий и он не утонет в миллионах других...
Siempre buena.....🎉❤😂
🤍

Never saw that before. Amazing!
Lindsey you did Great in this Video also🥰
Just checked her human design as I was wondering if she has a 3 in her profile (trail and error) and little do we know she does have it, very natural for her to try fail and eventually succeeds, keep going and of course wow, insane video ❤
Clearly offer the pain to God but we would like to see more of your smiles and joy, we love that part of you more, this world needs it.😊❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤C'est vraiment beau et magnifique et resplendissant et magique ! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤JE t'aime beaucoup!
Cool, Sublime comme toujours tes spectacles Lindsey. Je t'aime très fort en Amitié !
Well, Lindsay, I am truly captivated. I cannot shake the movement that you have please before my eyes I do not understand the extent of the gift God has given you.🎉
Линдси, вы великолепны, даже не в этом клипе, он вообще сносит мозг, в остальном - ваше умение делать шоу, мое мнение вы выходите на уровень почти что близкий к Фредди. Ну это сугубо мое мнение.
I seriously cannot watch this without crying!! It’s so beautiful yet you know how painful it is. It’s amazing!
Every single time I see this video, knowing how much work and in such a short space of time, it still blows my mind the absolute crazy, incredibly mind-blowing talent that lindsey has. She pushes herself so unbelievably hard, but the results are just magnificent and out of this world magical. Lindsey Stirling is and always will be an absolute legend, and I pray one day before I get too sick, I'll be able to witness her magic in real life ❤
Magníficas ❤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💐💐💐💐💐🌸🌹🌺🌺🌷🌹🥀🌺🌺⚘🌷🌹🏵🌺🌸
Ok, did this performance receive any awards?? If not, WHY?? I am in awe. And now I have to watch back on her process for this because I'm reading this preparation was difficult. Just wow.
Para aquel que vio el proceso antes de esta presentación, es aun más maravilloso ver su logro
❤
Divine!!!!!💙
❤❤❤ wow, you are so amazing. You performed so beautifully. I love what you are able to do and what you have accomplished over the years. The things you do for your fans is so incredible, and I know every single one of us appreciates and loves you so very much. ❤❤❤

wow,, totally speechless..! what an incredible performance!!....
Каждый день смотрел на твои слёзы и с нетерпением ждал финала. Смотрел этот клип в прямой трансляции. ❤
Congrats Lindsey! ❤️💜Increddidle performats!
I’ve never experienced anything like this, and it is hard to explain, but the music at around 2:40 resonates in my soul. I’ve listened to this video probably 100 times, but even now at 2:40 I get goose bumps all across my body and it is so beautiful that it makes me cry.   I can’t explain it… no other song has ever done that to me or made me feel that way.
Я в шоке.
The stick movement didn't match with the sound all the time so it was clearly recorded and then use a trick string or something so it wouldn't make a sound on stage. Sad.
Insane 😱
Most magyarul írók! Gyönyörű vagy! Igazi tehetség! Nagyon szeretem a zenéidet! És az én világom az képviselsz! Köszönöm ❤🙏🏻
❤❤❤
Unbelievable ❤🇫🇴
Oh my 😮 I’m just seeing this for the first time. Wow, you’re amazing to say the least. Didn’t flinch one time, I’m in awe! Great job, hun. Beautiful video. Thank you for reminding us of our inner strength❤
Это все фанера, расслабьтесь😂
Love this, how difficult it is probably. Thank you 🙏🏼 for the magical moment 🧚
Simply wow. Proof of your determination and stubbornness. Amazing performance and discipline and an other level of mind over matter.
My head hurts just by watching this and I don't even have long hair!
Это просто космос❤
Конечно это фонограмма. Никто не сможет сыграть в таком кручении и slowmo, но это всё равно вызывает восторг. Кстати, кто пишет про волосы - у многих голова совершенно не чувствительна к тянущемся волосам. Это совершенно не больно.
Это просто шедеврально. Обожаю тебя. 3.5 миллионов за такой шедевр и миллиард просмотров у Gangnam style. Тупость людей зашкаливает
Wunderbar
I would love to see yu in concert 😭😭😭😭
For ever By Khi Italy Verona
❤
YEEEE-AAAAAARGH! 😳
Oh my 😢, such a beautiful song. It's helped me to really understand it's about the persistent hustle.
Больно смотреть
Vážně věříte všemu
Při síle odstředění u  člověka neni možno v rukou housle udržet. Jak to dokážeš,? Ty?😢
😮 The skill involved here is astounding
You’re on your own level of excellence.❤️
are you ok
😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰
Amazing performance.❤
Iconic. 👏 🎉❤.  True warrior.
Simply incredible
her nr 1 track is 100% crystallised
everytime she performs crystallised the crowd goes nuts
Un-flipping-real! How the heck do you play while spinning that fast!!?? Just wow!!!🤯🩵
So this is live art. ❤ so glad this was documented beautifully.
Magnificent, magical and excruciating control 🎻 🩰  Beautiful music 😁🎶😍
❄️🥶💙💨💙
Esto es otro nivel , se paso el juego en experto

Tag Lindsey I’m here now
Ты лучшая ты просто супер 💋💋💋💋
Hermosaaaaaaaa!!!!!
Yeah I was at the online concert for home for the holidays and she had mentioned how painful it was and how much she cried doing it but in three months she got through it and I’m pretty sure she won’t do it again but congrats to her 🎉🤗 - also shoutout to @ladykatza because she explained everything I wanted to say
I love it but, Oof my head, I wouldn’t be able to.
I find it so cool how much control she has while spinning in the air, just a small leg movement and it changes the speed
the word "amazing" is lack a lot of attributes to describe this.  You're an angel
Ouch!! Please do not do that again. We love Lindsey, and do not wish to see you hurt. Great job though.
Woahhh absolutely amazing!!! BEAUTIFUL mind blown this actually exists. Thanks for making it
This is how you know God is real.
I have always been in awe of her courage and resilience to take on the challenge to learn hair hanging for her fans. She does not disappoint! All of her performances = EPIC EXPERIENCES
BEAUTIFUL!  I am all amazed at Lindsey's dedication, determination, and perfection in her art and music. RESPECT and LOVE.
Gorgeous ❤
Awesome your very determined I give you that never give up way to go
This is my ariels rectial song. Wish me luck its today in a few hours
🤯....... 🌹
Ultimate art 👍💯❤
You're amazing a phenomenal woman as Mya Angelo would say 😊🤍🌟
What in the world girll i love you i love this wow yeah but please we don't want to see you in pain but absolutely beautiful love love itt
Her skills never stops to amaze me. This song was the one that made me fall in love with violin years back  <3
Incredible! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💐
By far the most impressive live performance I’ve ever watched
браво без слов ты лучшая
..........
Gavi and dad would be proud ❤
Amazing
Will you ever do that again or not because I want to know? And I’m sure I will like whatever you do.
I just came across this  She was grieving.
👏👏👏👏👏👏😮😮
🎻 go weeeee😜

t'as pas mal aux cheveux ??? mais c'est super beau !
This performance CHANGED me. I think I watched it at least 4 times while I had "Home for the Holidays" available. Even now, when you play this and swing live in concert it moves me to tears. This song itself is so emotional for me and this performance just made it so much more incredible.
Hope i could do that
❤
Piers Morgan said "You're not good enough to go flying through the air and trying to play the violin at the same time" and Lindsey said "WATCH ME."
Please never do this again we can see you are in pain even though you try to not show it and i feel bad
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Just wow 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
She is obviously not the girl who cried "ehhhh ehhhhh, he pulled my hair, cryyyyyy" when she was child... Good show
Just breathtaking… I had tears rolling down my face just so amazing I can find the words and the journey you shared to get there was inspirational x thank you Lindsey for you forever amazing contribution to violin and classical instruments, u inspired me to start learning violin, I be happy with twinkle twinkle 🙏🙏🫶🏼🫂💙
WOW
I am slso a violist and i cant do that
I love the song
This is absolutely incredible.
The amount of stability and muscle control to pose like that, dangling by your hair is absolutely amazing .
Impresionante, talento al cien por ciento.
Not even Rapunzel was so dareing
Это опасно но безумно красиво!
You are the meaning of being talented
Chills. Literal chills
👻👻👻👑👻👻👻👑🕊🕊🕊🙀
Built different
Amazing
❤❤❤
Extraordinaire ! Congratulations Lindsey 😘🥰✨
Lindsey, this is great...but I watched the behind-the-scenes on this, and please know YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS KIND OF THING for us. Okay?🙂
I’m sorry but that is korny
Wow !
Elektronamia
Que hermosa melodía, la producciónn, todo.
wau!
I have chills and got choked up, that was beautiful. But I can't even imagine the work and passion and pain that went into that. Thank you and hopefully you don't have to do things that painful, but I absolutely love your heart and vision
It's impossible. She is from another planet
You are an amazing young lady. God has indeed blessed with so much beauty and courage and strength.
Imagine been her Sister or mother 😊❤❤❤
Holy moly. That was mesmerizing
Dont do this agian, Lindsey! Your fans dont need this painfull perfomance. We respekt it, but we dont need it.
No le dolerá su cabeza
It don‘t need a Stradivari to make this kind of music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNJaif37QlQ
Someone actually died from hanging from their hair. Not a good idea !!!!!!
Awesome!
Utter madness, if this woman can do this, anyone can do anything
I am crawling with goosebumps, all over! No joke! Wot a performance! How is it ive only just found this gal! Super duper all round epic artist! ❤🎉👏🏼💙
😮😳👀
When she spun i don't know why i started tearing up.This is a masterpiece
wow
SZACUN WIELKI dla Ciebie Lindsey!
Being dizzy on top of hair loss ensuring that is insane but please don’t do that again
Those who live with constant pain have to push through it and do what has to be done every day.
Does beauty have no limits? Can perfection still be surpassed? It will not be enough to say “thank you”, nor will it be enough to simply admire you. Those who help you achieve this magic will know that they are beings who benefit from the sweetness of your art. From Argentina with love.
bràvo   !!!!!
Just plain incredible. The grace and dance movements are out of the world, but how can she play violin at the same time-is beyond belief.  I hope there is a 4k video of how she trains and prepares for performances like this. History needs to record how outstanding an artist she is.
She's sort of in shape!
wow
Nicht von dieser Welt !!!
Happy Birthday!!
literal no pain no gain you are angel
Она смогла! Она сделала это! Вот это сила духа! Её характер такой же твёрдый и крепкий, как и её волосы! Мы гордимся тобой, Линдси! Ты чудо - женщина!❤
MARRY ME LINDSEY
She's flying:)
It's very beautiful but of course we all understand she can't play live at the same time. Moving like this and play the violin is impossible. So it is phonogram.
That might be the most incredible thing I’ve ever seen
Your hair 😢
Breath taking
Awesome fantabulous 🎉❤
what the....  genuinely, my jaw was on the floor the entire time I was watching this. I'm absolutely flabergasted!
Chwała Panu w tej pięknej kobiecie!!
В день два раза это упражнение делай, шея не будет болеть.
Wow your performance never disappoint. Your the Goat of violinist
You are a gorgeous and courageous, amazing human being ❤
i cant get enough of this ,,, so many thoughts run through my mind with this ,,, Lindsey playing with such passion while in such pain ,,, Lindsey floating like an angel with precise movement timed to the violin ,,,, Lindsey getting told she cant do it , then proving Pierce wrong ,,,  Lindsey so small yet larger than life ,,, then after all that ,, i have to think of my own life and how this song relates  to me .Probably the best thing iv ever seen and heard , probably will stay that way to . Thank you Lindsey .
seeing Lindsey doing this takes determination and high tolerance for pain. this act is real and there is alot of discomfort and certain level of pain involved. once again she leaves us in loss of words.
wowww Diosa total!!! IDOLA, IMPRESIONANTE !!!
I am so proud of you. Your endurance, perseverance.. and the will of God. Your father didn't just raise you right, he lifted you. My grandma did the same for me... no matter the doubts, they were (and are) there. in everything we do. I love watching you, and FOREVER. will be a fan. GO DAD! And GO YOU! <3
fantástic ❤️, without sacrifice there is no victory
This is beyond incredible
WOW..❤
What a performance!!!!
Que Maravilhoso...... Espetaculo Lindo ! ( From Brazil )
超級棒的
This is called "beautiful determination"  . Wow what an intense & riveting performance. Truly remarkable of the very gifted Lindsey Sterling.
I m shook
Always amazing. 😭🩷  But i need a neck massage after seeing this 😂
This is probably one of the most insane, yet inspiring videos I've ever seen. Kudos to you for not giving up, and achieving what you set out to accomplish! Also... I hope you gave your hair some love because seeing your flyaway breakage hurts my hairstylist heart 😢😅😂❤
watching this *after* her vlog of the training required, of her doubt right up until she recorded this, made me weep. As she alluded to, we truly have no idea how close we are to succeeding while we're consumed with the idea of failing.
Dy Menahan Rasa Sakit itu Seperti Tidak Ada Beban.
Cada ves que veo este video pienso, no puede ser real es increíble cada movimiento expresión, lindsey te amamos gracias por ser tan increíble ❤
Why did she do that? Her music alone is awesome.  I can't figure out her pain & effort.
That IS the damndest (sorry) thing I've ever seen! Had it been anyone but Lindsey, I'd thought it was CGI. Absolutely amazing!
Sen çok özelsin, müziğini çok seviyoruz . Lütfen en rahat halinle çal .saçlarının acıdığını hissedebiliyorum  . Türkiyeden sevgilerle❤❤❤
Beautiful Thank You
This is so incredible!
Only one word: mesmerizing!
this was sooo moving super amazing you will always be the best violinist this world has ever seen in my eyes and hope to see you perform live one day  !!!!!
Волшебная мелодия, прекрасное выступления, моё восхищение) Я бы так не смогла... Невероятная женщина Линдси Стирлинг
That must of hert like hel 😮
Это было прекрасно , давно так не восхищалась игрой на скрипке. Линдси  ты лучшая
Its so magical that its painful...
Beatifull !!!
Sensational!!! Can't wait to see you again live in your next tour!
Восхитительно !Невероятно красиво ! Молодец ! Восхищение и почтение за такое неповторимое выступление !🙏👍👌💐💐💐
Это что-то невероятное. Решится на это, очень рисковано
Where can I find you
Это просто волшебное выступление, видно, что больно, но сколько силы в этой Маленькой Женщине🫶
❤
You’re such a special creature ❤ I thank the fate I was born on this era so that I can listen to and watch at you. You are a living poem
Perfeita 😍👏🏼❤❤
Is this equal to have a bad hair day 😊
Stunning but please don’t put yourself in so much pain 👏👏😍😍
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No tira de su cabello ,hay un cable casi invisible q tira por el cuelo y va sus cuerpo q lo sostiene 😉

Verse 1: I've been around the block a time or two I've seen the ups and downs, the old and new But the one thing that's kept me going strong Is the music that's been with me all along  Chorus: The music must never stop, no matter what they say It's the beating of my heart, the rhythm of my soul each day I'll keep writing songs and dancing till the end For my fans and for myself, the music must never end  Verse 2: They say I'm past my prime, I'm getting old But I refuse to believe what I've been told The fire in my belly burns bright and true And the music's the only thing that sees me through  Chorus: The music must never stop, no matter what they say It's the beating of my heart, the rhythm of my soul each day I'll keep writing songs and dancing till the end For my fans and for myself, the music must never end  Bridge: It's not about the fame or the glory anymore It's about the music that I've come to adore The stories that I tell and the melodies I create Are the legacy that I'll leave, my mark, my fate  Chorus: The music must never stop, no matter what they say It's the beating of my heart, the rhythm of my soul each day I'll keep writing songs and dancing till the end For my fans and for myself, the music must never end  Outro: So I'll keep on playing, until my final bow The music must never stop, it's my promise, my vow.
Impresionante, viva Lindsey
come on get this to at least 30 mil views. This needs at least 100 mil for this to even make sense.
Боже мой, я даже расплакалась, это было просто потрясающе, какая стойкость и сколько силы воли человеку понадобилось, чтобы это сделать. Я видела ее ролики, где она тренировалась и плакала от боли, как хотела все бросить, потому что считала, что не сможет это сделать, и вот она выступила, смогла. Я в восхищении!
Ты Прелесть!!!!!
Still amazing after two years
Beautiful
Nunca me cansaré de ver este video, es increíblemente fascinante ✨
You are lucky that you are strong❤😢
Que ermoso🙀🤯🥺
Are y😯u in 2023?🔥💃🏻🎻👌
Esta mujer se pasa de ser buen artista.
Phenomenal!!!!!
Insanely talented.
Please do not destroy yourself to get praise or pay from others.
diosaaaaaaaa 🤩😍🥰😍🥰
Wow, the amount of dedication and emotion from this brought me to tears, I'm a total mess
You truly are an amazing and beautiful woman. I love your music and videos ❤
You got it! Amazing :)
This show was something I've NEVER SEEN BEFORE. She is such an amazing woman and artist and sets the bar! She is a shinning star because she puts God first! She will always be successful and loved! I never knew how much pain she was in until I saw her vlog. This woman is amazing!
Lindsey, you are a wonderful artist. You are Unique.!!!
Your sense of artistic credibility is manificent...like a trembling water cascading down the mountains of pure sinful exploits...only to be rendered loved by the femininity inherent in a real woman
BRAVO!!!!! BRAVO!!!!!!!
😱
ICH SAGE. NUR Prinzessin
WOW!!! I don't know why I didn't watch this video before... You are an amzing artis, my dear; a Show woman I could say. Your violin performance is incredible, as always but you added this entire new level of difficultness. I cannot with my emotions in this moments, I just can feel proud of you. I am sending a big hug, from Chile jus for you.
Beautiful yet painful coming from a woman who has thick waist length hair looks very painful.
I love this so much 😍💕
What conditioner does she use? I tried this using the winch from my 4x4 it didn't work, now I have a large bald spot on my head and there is a giant tuft of hair stuck to my winch. I guess its important to point out I cant play an instrument, but I was taught to dance by the Maasai tribe in africa.
First she does a Paso Doble with broken ribs.... now this? Ooooowwwwww!!!!! Get it girl. Your strength is ASTOUNDING
Bühüleyici
I have no words... Lindsey, you are 100000% amazing, and I'm truly thankful you are who you are and you do what you do!! Much love from New Zealand!!
What concentration, technique, talent. You never cease to amaze me. This is extremely beautiful and so perfect.
You are a true artist in every sense of the word.
You can tell the great artists because they will give almost everything for their art. Van Gogh gave an ear for love she giving hair for her art.
Uma performance extraordinária, belíssima 🇧🇷
An unrechable level of discipline.
BRAVO!!!!!!!!
I would’ve dropped the violin or started crying
An awesome flow feeling, thanks ^^
3:00😱
Magic
Definitivamente eres única Lindsey
This young lady is the most unbelievable violinist and performance artist. She keeps raising the bar, and making beautiful music as she does so.  Bravo Lindsey!
Best song ever
Incredible!!
This piece is so magical
Se me eriza la piel , simplemnte hermoso , toca hermoso desde chica la veo ❤️
I saw them watching in India in my news feed and hadn't yet seen this and it literally took my breath away!!! Not much does this for me. Amazed and breathless. So very much like aging for me. At nearly 60 I've done so many things they told me I could not but this gave me strength to keep on doing it!!!
It's all done with mirrors,, Seriously,  this was absolutely beautiful!
why is her sighing in the audio???
I love running to Lindsey Stirlings music.
I LOVEEEEEEEEEE YOU LINDSEY😍😃🥰😄😀❤🧡💛💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
THIS is what merit, talent and determination look like people.  Stop trying to take it away from those that have it, and do something with yourself rather then trying to bring standards and everyone else down to the lowest level.  THIS is the height of achievement.  Reach for it.  Aspire and become better!!!
coooooooooooooooooooooolllllllllllllllllllllllllll
WOW Fantastic Lindsey
Ihre Musik ist auch so Wunderschön, Bitte nicht mehr machen Lindsey
Also Ich weiß nicht wie es den anderen Menschen geht!Aber Mir läuft es kalt den Rücken runter wenn Ich sehe das so eine Hübsche Frau sich dem Ausetzt
Ich glaube Ich habe noch nie etwas schöneres gesehen wie diese Körperbeherschung
Crystallize has always been one of my favorite pieces. But I now have a new appreciation for this song, knowing the time and effort you put into this sequence ❤
that's the most amazing thing I've ever seen... bravo.
punk! <3
واوووووووو من أروع ما شاهدت فعلا يعجز الكلام عن التعبير لم أكن أعلم أن تعليقها من شعرها كان حقيقي حتى قرأت التعليقات فعلااااا مبدعة بأتم ما تحمله الكلمة من معنى
Beautiful, but looks so uncomfortable. I can see that determination. You did an amazing job lindsey.
This is by far my absolute  favorite  video she has ever created.  It was always my favorite track but to see this just incredible.
Ummm. Amazing
Incredibly mindblowing🎻💃🏻🔥😍
no esta tocando playback
🔥♥️🔥♥️🔥♥️
I want to hang from hair just like you . 🎉😊
I hope I can try that too.
Lindsey Stirling is one of a kind...hair hanging aerialist do not play a violin!
brought a couple of tears to my eyes, brilliant.
Strangely beautiful, and almost painful to watch. I keep thinking... who's idea was this? Bravo. I hope you are o.k. Lindsey.
Impresionante
So much effort and pain went into making this video, but please don't hurt yourself for your fans. If you want to fly try a regular harness, it makes me so sad seeing you hurt yourself in the behind the scenes of how you made this video.
Pięknie to zrobione 🇬🇱❤️🇬🇱❤️🇬🇱
You are so fantastic and wondeful lady and so beautiful artist, all my congratulations
Elle est d ailleurs....
Just when you think that girl has talent…  WOW! SHE HAS TALENT!!  Amazing 🤩   She should be more famous than The Bee Gees and Rolling Stones, Fred Estaire and Ginger Rogers!!😮
In the immortal words of Miss Shuga Cain…go on Cirque de Soleil!!!
😯😯😯😯
Assistindo no Brasil
😮😳😮 Whoa
Wow, wow wow........  just blown away watching you. I just can’t find the words that could describe me watching that performance. I feel so much emotion when I watch you. Thank you Lindsey for sharing your Devine talent with us. 💕💕💕 xx
This is art!!
You are amazing Lindsey!
I came across Lindsay's hair hanging vlog first and felt her pain watching her going through that training, then saw this as a suggested video — this is insane! I was crying watching this performance. Lindsay is phenomenal!
Это вообще не красиво ни разу, сразу представляешь всю боль и вообще уже не до красоты ,это на грани фола, как в  шоу где люди протыкают себе щеки,уши,носы. Зачем это делать с таким напряжением, рыдать от боли 3 месяца точно не стоило того
👏 Amazing and fabulous! Kudos 👏 to her for taking all that pain in the name of art and showmanship. What true talent she is!
ми чомусь про неї забули
Currently listening right before my first surgery. Thank you Lindsey for doing such hard things to show it’s possible
Muito talentosa, incrível!
So beautiful. So happy to see she is living an amazing authentic life free from the cult she grew up in
Muito talentosa, incrível!
Like a snowflake dancing on the wind. 🥰🥰🥰
That is just amazing
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Много раз браво, браво, браво.Линдси, ты как всегда прекрасна!🙏👏👏👏👏🥰😍💕
Браво,красиво, талантливо, волшебно!!!
This was INSANE, and also sooo BEAUTIFUL! ❤️✨👏🏼
America's Got Talent:  "(...) you are not untalented, but you are not good enough I don't think to get away with flying trough the air and playin' violins at the same time." LOL   Lindsey, you are unique! Amazing job.
woah you have to be very strong to do that
This give me chills😳🤩
Le travail, la performance. Un bijou. Un diamant ❤️
Wow,impressive also when you spin around the weight  is getting  even bigger,is one thing when you just hang in the air but when you spin around  is much harder to endure
You are so beautiful Lindsey...just amazing.
the dance and music are amazing 🎻🎻🎻
She must be so dizzy how can she still play the violin?!!?
Amazing!
this gives me anxiety ahhhhh but you look amazing 😭🙌
she is amazing, great work
Wow u are amazing ❤❤❤
This is incredible, incredible.
OMG.....I can't believe she is doing this
yeah. YES LINDSEY this was most definitely the "silver bullet" that slew the beast in me when I heard that this was going on I THEN KNEW WITHOUT A DOUBT that you meant business and I knew I HAD to contact you again and apologize for "brushing you off" in the way I had and speak gentle kind words to you again IM VERY GLAD the family was able to convince you that this "wasn't necessary" to continue for reasons I pointed out. IM VERY GLAAD our prayers were heard. I'm going to make a mashup as a matter of fact my NEXT mashup (I'll make it tomorrow) will be a blend of your beauty and the beast and this combined
S/o Babalos for the discover
After watching everything I could possible see from her... respect is something beyond. I felt the pain, and also felt the Love, the real motivation Behind all the pain, all the sttrugle.. don't You dare to say You didn't like That. Don't You dare, say That you feel pitty or wanted to see something less painful. Let's respect her choices as if it was ours. Hope the best for you all. Always.
i dont know why but this song is so beautiful it makes me cry every time i hear it
Does that even hurt??
Amazing SOOOO talented.
I can't watch this masterpiece without crying... If you even don't cry in the video, the violin does... The pain, what you feel is hearable across the violin. You are amazing. 💖
we really are   Thank you  so much ❤️
What matters is that you did it, you had your panic attacks (with everyone who has anxiety disorders like me and everyone else), but, you did it, and I'm proud of you!
To much time to go through all comments, but do she do it live playing... awesome all the way , anyway. Hats off. Peace  . Slava Ukraine.
Master is master
muy jalado de los pelos. muy looco.
I only found this video the other day and I just wanted to say how amazing it is. I watched the video of her training for it, and bless her heart she really pulled through.
As someone with hair thats about 1m 10cm, i did not make it till the end of the video. It was very painful to watch, cant imagine how painful it was to train and film
I haven’t followed you in a while, found this on my timeline and I’m so glad I did. still as amazing as ever.
It's seen so pain !!! 😭😭😭 but you are my passion why I play violin too ❤🎻 (I'm not karolina protsenko)
I remember when I saw the Crystallize music video for the first time many years ago and fall hard in love with the music and the artist, to this day it`s my favorite song, never thought that I could fall in love with the same song all over again and be even more impressed by the love and dedication you put in your craft. You deserve all the love and good things this world has to offer, amazing job, but please take it easy!!!
Girl is absolutely insane!!!  Hurts my hair follicles just by watching this 😵
Это невероятно!!! Это потрясающе!!! Спасибо за ваше искусство😍❤❤❤
Amazing you are crazy for doing it but its looks magical...🤯🥰🤯 An love your music keep it up ...
Next, violin while indoor skydiving!
AHHHHH! Beautiful work. Loved the ice castles, this is another level ❤
A Quick face Lift! Love it! Really you did an amazing jog. Keep it up!
Дякую вам,це неімовірно яскраве дуже впечков（ΦωΦ）
Respect.  Absoluty incredible
Lindsey es una de las pocas artistas tan únicas que he conocido, tiene tantas habilidades, no me creo que alguna vez le hayan dicho "No tienes talento" ella es simplemente grandiosa.
Невероятно! Красиво! Потрясающе!
Cada día me sorprende esta chica, después de  ver lo que sufrió para deleitarnos a nosotros, en verdad es impresionante no tengo palabras para decir cuanto la admiro
Amazing artist 💗
Its like as beautiful and amazing as this performance is I can't watch it without thinking about the pain and misery it cost her to do it... You are my hero Lindsey you will do anything for your art!
Saludos bella lindsey. 😁 Desde Argentina.
lindsey just DO YOUR STFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you are awsome! DO YOUR OWN SONGS!!!
Mike from Elk Grove California age 64. What a beautiful piece of music,  hope she didn't receive any split ends while performing this lol
Ella se merece tocar en un auditorio de música clásica.
Legends never die reminds me of u...loved it
Heres un Angel caído del cielo, gracias por darnos estos momentos de los cuales no me canso de bolver a ver continuamente.
This is amazing, beautiful and can I say “ouch”.
Clay.
this is beautiful, incredible, and I can hear the changes made to the song that just add some more beauty to this new show you put on but I do agree with others please do something less painful next time!
Потрясающая!!! 💃💃💃❤️❤️❤️🌷🌷🌷
at 2:44. brilliant!
Unbelievable ! lot of effort ! she flyyyyy !
Perfeição!😍🇧🇷
Increíble 👏👏👏
I just had this song in my mind while thinking about beautiful experiences from my past. For about 8 years i haven't listened to it and now it makes me feel so much joy and it reminds me of what I usually say "everything is possible" . Gives a lot of positive emotions 😍😍😍
simplemente estoy impresionado con lo que es capaz está mujer. este video me dejó completamente ignotizado fascinan mereces mucho más saludos desde Venezuela
I can't even....
Wow..🎖 excellent performance..🎖💙
Beautiful performance but that hair hanging thing still makes me cringe. That is dedication beyond dedication.
Wow
I love how wrong Piers Morgan was! I like the couple notes that slip through unperfected, that is what makes this so real and so moving!
The emotion at the end is priceless.
Ты сумасшедшая!!!
This is the perfect pain and beauty fusion still after a year later. 🥺💗
Hey sometimes you just want to push the boundaries to see what or that you CAN accomplish it...and you did spectacular
Amazing, beautiful, crazy cool but… too much pain!!! It’s awesome that you did that but there was too much pain for you to go through to do all of that!!
UPDATE: This video STILL gives me goosebumps a month later!!  I cried! Lindsey, I’ve followed your career for over 10 years! My sister introduced me to Elements, and I’ve been jaw dropped and hooked ever since. Your work is literally the pure definition of raw beauty, talent, and energy. Just pure art at its finest! After watching your hair hanging vlog, then this, I was literally in tears! So proud of you, yet insanely inspired to push through everything that is an obstacle in my life, because you may be closer than you know. I’m no longer LDS, but coming from someone who was also apart of the church, That CTR ring must have really made an impact! (If you had one) cuz girl, you definitely chose the right direction! It must have taken a long time to not only discover your niche but hone in on it and perfect it. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU LINDSEY!!! Just know you have a cheerleader on the other side of the internet!!!!!! I’m a forever fan ❤️
Wow, just wow
This was beautiful... but please don't do anything like this again. Seeing you in that much pain is hard to watch!

*She did it for herself to prove that any human can do it, the judges told her I don't think you can "fly  through the air and play violin at the same time", she did it. She's the reason humans can multitask.*
Increíble!!! 😍
King brilliant
Es ist so atemberaubend schön, Gänsehaut pur. Ich bewundere dich, deine Musik, deine Tänze. Jeder deiner Arbeiten versetzt einen in eine andere Dimension und Geschichte, man fühlt bei jedem klang deiner Geige einfach alles. Du verzauberst einen und das jedes Mal. Vielen Dank für deine Mühe, Arbeit, Hingabe. Ich wünsche dir weiterhin viel Fantasie und Zauber und vor allem Gesundheit. 💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
I've hung from my hair before, did some pretty intensive stuff too. But this? This is ridiculous, it's a proper full routine while also playing violin!
One of the wildest things I have ever seen!
unsurpassed idiocy.))
2:42 THE MOMENT  I Cry!!!!. Such discipline, such dedication, this is truly unique .. AMAIZING .. this is, this, is.. I have no more words ...
Thank you Lindsey. You inspire me greatly. Your performances, craft and strength push me to never relent in the mill of mastery. I love!
W życiu czegoś takiego nie widziałem !! Mogę to oglądać bez końca !!
Grace, Beauté, Epoustouflant WAOUH ! ! !  Vidéo originale, Prestation Grandiose ! Respect à vous Madame ! ! Merci pour cet instant
TY for the sacrifice! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
если это правда то Линси супер девочка
Все восхищаются, а я думаю о том, что это, наверное, больно

Wow! Beautiful and Heavenly! She is an Amazing and a Blessed Music Angel!
This performance is the most impressive I have seen from Lindsey. I can imagine the hours and hours of work to get to this point. It shows on her face, the pain she must be going through. She once again gives her fans a stunning performance! 💗
Favorite ! From Miami airport go girl !
Wawwwww amasing
Spettacolare
The pain she endured for the art, fans and music. Im speechless!
how are you not bald after that lol
It's great
her stare into the camera at the end screams "what's your excuse?"
I have just one word  Ow! Also why
So did Piers Morgan ever apologize for his demeaning comments that lead to this and admit he was wrong?
Breath taking!!!....wonderful and the best I've ever seen....God has truly given us a great gift to have such an honour to see Lindsey...💞💞💞💞💞💞. 🎻🎻🎻🎻🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
Very nice and Great Respect
Incrível! ♥️ Brasil 🌹
Maravilloso!
Have you been on American Got Talent if not you should be on because you are so talented

Absolutely mesmerizing Lindsay you are a force to be reckoned with.
Pain is a state of mind, to block the responses and pull this off… nothing short of incredible. Would love for this version to be made available on streaming services. Such an amazing version.
Y ahora literalmente toca y está VOLANDO
Ahhhhmaaaziinnnngggg!! 🥰👱🏼‍♀️🎻🎶
JUST........WOW!
Coming from a violinist she’s defiantly not actually playing live it’s 100% a recording she’s not even doing the right fingerings
Magnifique super vidéo merci merci beaucoup 👏👏👏👍👍👍🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
It's so painful but The SONG SO AMAZING
You know how it hurts when you rip of a Hair.Then you can Imagine how much it hurts when you hang by your own Hair.
Lindsey Stirling Линдсюша,я наблюдал за тренироками,переживал за тебя ,но не решался посмотреть...... ты же моя прелесть....Ты Нечто Совершенное =)
It's so unbelievabel fantastic. Lindsey is so a strong human being. I Love this little Angel so much. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💓💓💓💓💓😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Wow! This is one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen! You are so beautiful and amazing! You remind me that we all are unique! Thank you so much for such a hard and beautiful work! I have no words. By the way, I felt there was a moment that I stopped breathing hehehe..
Beautiful performance, I couldn't have done this without you. I really do love you. You mean everything to me.
Como essa mulher consegue misturar tão lindamente, música com arte, fantasia, dança, beleza e sentimentos!
You shouldn't do it on the head even though it's a perfect performance, it probably hurts a lot you should have put it on your waist or leg or something .. Love ya tho 😘

Lindsey is outstanding in everything she does. I would give anything to see her live in concert one day.

Just comes to prove that hard work, determination and passion can win over any challenge. Eat your heart out AGT!!!!! Lindsey was better than all of you!!!!

Слов нет!!! Ты не от мира сего!!!
❤‍🔥
😍
Thank you
Sorry , joke for french speakers ; Ce clip est totalement capillotracté
The fact she can play the violin while spinning and in pain is a true talent.
Itiz bjudfl veri veri
You r great, your music is amazing but why would u do this to yourself, completely unnecessary. Otherwise great as always.
This art it's so painfully
super j'aime trop
😍😍🤩🔥🔥🔥
So absolutely breathtaking to watch. The only thing that would've made that any better, to have watched it in person...  you're just SO amazing Lindsey! <3  So very inspiring & amazing! :D <3
Lindsey, could you please tell us what shampoo do you use? ))
Wow, that’s crazy!
אלופה מהממת
I watch this twice.
realy realy good,I like best
It's very beautiful....❤️❤️
Gave me chills
<3
с одной стороны правдободобно(из-за предшествующего видео, но наверняка так и задумано, чтобы поверили), но в целом по законам физики при последней раскрутке просто сорвало бы скальп из-за этого нет веры в естественность, и это только крайняя ситуация, до этого тоже были не сильно естественные моменты.
I just watched the first video of this because I looked up hair hanging videos and I am honestly so proud of you. You did amazing and it came out beautifully
Es la mwjor enserio no sé... Tiene que ser más conocida
INCREDIBLE!! AMAZING!! EXTRAORDINARY!! REMARKABLE!! SHE'S A  LEGEND OF HER!!!  OWN. 🌹🌹🌹❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏🥰🥰🥰
I Love Lindsey Stirling je vous remercie infiniment pour vos magnifiques chansons.Maelle.
I see the pain in her face. Everyone saying it's a beautiful performance, I just don't get. Pain isn't beautiful. I see no need to put oneself through this torture. Quit being silly.
I am crazy...
One word; WOW!
🥲🔥❤️‍🔥
Increíble
Sensation: Long... A long never ending falling.
Crystalize: Falling...  Now: Same... Exactly. Sensation is the same...
I have been a major fan of hers since the first time I heard her and she literally brings tears to my eyes from the sounds she makes along with her dancing. I stumbled upon this by accident following a hair hanger I saw on Ellen show today and saw the Lindsay Sterling link below, needless to say my mind was blown seeing that she had learned to do this too. Most fitting routine/dance to go with her violin skills ever. Hope to see more, they say the pain dulls down the more it's practiced. Shear video/sound perfection.
Very Nice Limsy ❣️ 💯🎻🔥☝️
Fantastic I LOVE YOU 💕
Amazingggg 👏 🤗🤗
Hermosa música  saludos de aki de teloloapan gro México
Some how im imagining a new opening song for "How to teach a dragon"
Çok güzel ve çok zor
💗💓💞💖
C'est tous simplement magnifique les larmes on coulé 💗
From Spain... I have no words. Amazing.
Insane
So beautiful but painful even to watch. Amazing music, amazing Lindsey. Take care
Fantastique,  je ne la connaissais pas il y a 10 minutes et je suis subjugué. Quel talent. Bravo.
U deserve more
это что я сейчас посмотрел
🙏❤️
Great job girl! You are amazing!!!
Que grande Lindsey 👏🏼
unbelievable and amazing performance!! I love your music very vet much and it's been with me for so many years and I love seeing tou grow and become an absolute legend 💖
GLORIOUS
Absolutely stunning. I cried knowing how hard you trained, how many tears you shed but your perseverance and determination made a beautiful video in the end. I hope I'm able to get tickets to your upcoming Summerfest show.  My 11 yr old son looks up to you and your the reason he took to learning the violin. He's amazing!  I get chills knowing he's so good already and he's only begun playing summer of 2021.  We love you!
Wowooooooooo🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍😍🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌷🌷🥀🌷🌷
That must have hurt!    Beautiful, Breathtaking, Elegant, Original are just a few words that come to mine.  Incredible performance; keep doing you!  You are amazing!
I love Crystalize!😍🥰
Until the day her neck snaps...  Nice music but what a Terrible idea for a video
Amazing! Art form  at its best. Thank you!
Это пиздец
O mio dio... è una performance incredibile😍
I just love the sound of the violin the way she plays withe such professionalism, I don't mind for her not doing everything extra. I just want to listen to that beautiful sound of how amazing she plays the violin sounds incredible love it ! ❤
Оригинально, такое никто не делал. 🤓👍
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!
It is probably showing how your pain let you die when you even dont try onece you get tey tha pain flew aways just like shw did she fets that pain inside her all body and let the pain losssss this is called the pain relief 🥲
<3
This performance is absolutely stunning and the music 🎵🎶 I put my daughter to sleep to THIS and her other songs she's not human she's a Celtic spirit
uhh... that's some very strong hair. Pantine?  ;)
Je suis fanne de toi. Depuis le cameroune
Her hair🥺
Why are people still wearing masks???
Super Super Super😘 💎🎶
Dayeeem😀Just incredible, you are my favorite musician even from the beginning!
😱🥰
i wish i could hook my head up on that thing.. i have some neck pain and i feel like that would fix it.
On ressent beaucoup d'émotion à la fois magique🥰🥰🥰🥰
I am beyond impressed! 😲 this is what a real artist is!!!  I didn't know that the whole body weight could be pulled up like that by the hair
SENCILLAMENTE ESPECTACULAR
Абажаю вас
how... That's so incredible. Just, how. you did it. just wow.
i love it!!!!! and i am 8 yers old.
Une Étoile 🌟 est née ♥️♥️♥️
I used to listen to you very often when I was young. I just wanted to watch what you did since the last time that's why I'm here. I think this video is the apotheosis of your past and actual work. It makes me think about what the judge said when I first saw you on AGT : unless you're violin master you wouldn't be able handling flying through the air stuff while playing violin at the same time. Such a poetic prove that you are a violin master and beyond that, that you grew up  !  Edit : sorry for my English I'm a French native speaker 🤷‍♂️
Me encantó esta presentación bailando en el aire 😍😍😍😍 Le doy un 20 de 10 😁👌 Mis Felicitaciones para Ella por tan preciosos TALENTOS con el 🎻 violín 🎼🎵🎶 Y el Bailar 💃👈🤩 Saludes desde Nicaragua 🇳🇮🤗
Божественно .....
Woooow😮😍
J'ai mal pour ses cheveux
I'll say it for her: OWWIE!!  OWWIE!!  OWWIE!!
Классно! Хорошо что только с головы волосы зацепили....
No words you're just awesome ❣️🤩💜✨
I Just wanna Say"" 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙏🙏" " Hats off .... 😍 🤩
😲
Magnificent! Absolutely Magnificent! The most beautiful performance I've ever seen. Thank you for sharing your art with the world.
Every time I watch this I am just in awe....what a performance - AMAZING!  Just went to her concert this week, Lindsey is even better live!
Amazing
I tell ya she just makes you feel the music. She's a Pied Piper a true artist.
It was so awesome you feel pain but  you always never give up on us
I can feel that pain. Ouch roots. You're absolutely amazing
the roots of my hair are screaming
Simplemente magnifica
U truly are amazing
Definitely deserves a like under video
Comme le violon je ne vibre qu'un instant, une éternité dans l'immensité de l'univers. Et de ce battement je frôle le point rêvé où l'espace et le temps n'ont plus de limite. Et de ce vide qui se suspend tout au fond de chacun de  nous, de ce vide tu créé un souffle infini. Merci Céline H. France
Beautiful 😍😍😍
Incroyable mais vrai !
that is hurt ._.
Just incredible performance.  But I hope she won't torture herself again
Absolutely incredible! So beautiful!!!
Remember when whatever his name is on X factor said she wasn’t good enough to try and jump around on stage AND play at the same time.
you're incredible ❤  the strength within your mind body and hair is incredible
Seeing everything you went through to get to this point... it's absolutely beautiful!!!!!!!
I wonder if Lindsey can play Flight of the Bumblebee really fast while twirling in the air like that!  Ling Ling 40 hours practice!
hermosooooo
hello, why VLOG in christmas playlist ?
Я смотрела видео тренировки и потом само выступление. У меня сердце сжалось! Зачем это все? Столько слез и боли в этом. Вы молодец! 👏👏👏👍💐
Torturing yourself and calling it "art"... great. What are sadists and masochists going to think of next? This is ridiculous and unnecessary, but of course celebrities are pushed to every limit for entertainment purposes.
La neta te la rifaste !!!!!
Parabéns 👏🏻👏🏻 uma obra de arte.
Thus is truly amazing 👏🏽,  but please do something less painful I honestly  ant imagine the pain 💔
Simply wonderful 😍❤️
I’m way late to the party on this, but seeing the behind the scenes video first I had to watch this. And….wow….this is freakin incredible. Absolutely, no other word to describe it, incredible.
I know I am a little late to the party on this one, but I would like to say at least this.   Beautiful job Lindsey! I know that was hard and excruciatingly painful seeing the previous video you posted. I could practically feel the pain radiating from the screen. But you stayed strong until the very end, and you went through with it! You're a strong lass, hun, and we love you for it! 💖
вывих шейного позванка - останется прикованной к кровати. Для чего такой риск?
Juste je préfère l’original
Now am thinking of adding acrobatic stunts to my belly Dancing, absolutely love it
Wonderful work! I love how you never limit yourself in the performance with your Violin.  But don’t hurt yourself. I would never want you to be in pain just to entertain us.
beautiful video
This version makes me think "you don't own me" Harley Quinn. 🥰
The original video was so good I got in trouble at work for staring at a cute girl for shifting her legs during a standing position. I heard the song.
didnt that hurt your head by just dangling from your head!?
Hello dear, I am a pianist and orchestral conductor, could you listen to my compositions 🙏🏻🙌🏻❤
I’ve loved her since I heard the dubstep version of “Crystallize” on Pandora ages ago. She’s amazing and wonderfully talented...why was this necessary..?  I don’t understand why anyone would wish to hang by their hair. How is this beautiful for an artist of any kind....? I understand “suffering for one’s art”, but she’s already an amazing artist.  Human’s desires for the “show” is the source of so much pain. Beauty doesn’t always have to entail horrible physical pain. And the look of pain on her face here is in my mind a total contradiction to the beauty and emotion of “Crystallize”....it just makes me sad here. Please don’t do this again, sweetheart. You don’t need to. 😞😔
This left me speechless.  Absolute masterpiece performance all around how does this not have 10x more views.
Wow
Maravilhoso !!!!!!
Sublime
The perfect representation of how music looks like.
Это прекрасно
Is this breathtakingly stunning art with beautiful playing ? Absolutely.  Do I feel physically  sick to my stomach knowing she repeatedly put her body in physical distress and pain to do this video? Yeah.
ALUCIFLIPANTE!   Digno de "EL CIRCO DEL SOL".   El tema ya lo conocemos,  sin comentarios.
Боже мой, какая Вы молодец!!!💖 Смотря видео, у меня заболела голова и шея....
Magnifiques qu'elle spectacle
Ich habe noch nie sowas gesehen und gehört die Frau ist für mich ein absolutes Supertalent
Ok, don't get me wrong - this must have taken so much work to choreograph and train for, and you did beautifully - but, (and I may be missing something deeper about beauty out of pain??) why submit yourself to such a pain when a back harness would probably have worked out to be just as elegant? For the challenge? For the creativity? For the wrenching, unnecessary pain? .. I don't understand.
A magical air ballet, suspended by her hair. This is a expression of courage, a spirit not seen in many. Can't help but continue to return to this video and watch it again.
frenzy!!!

Girl, you. are. amazing. Deep breaths and continue to push forward against the blood, the sweat, the pain, the tears, and I swear you will ALWAYS rise.
Its crazy how many people come back to this everyday... this song is a masterpiece!!!
Magnificent! You are truly such an inspiration! Namaste’ 🌟🤍🌟🤍🌟
Pura pollo, le faltó superar los 7G
Unbelievably beautiful and a testament to Lindsey's strength of character and will. I am in awe.
She give me the inspiration to sell my 🎻 violin 😌😁
на самом деле с таким вращением исполнять шедевры не реально. но спасибо за красивую сказку  )
I did see what she went through for this video first time I seen this version of Crystallized  I started crying and I still do.
My hair, they will all be gone if I do like this.
Please don't every do that again with your hair stunt.  You are to valuable to be hurt.
OW today to create a WOW tomorrow.
Je vous souhaite le meilleur
Masterpiece
The most beautiful performance I've ever seen in my life 💙🥲

Jesteś Aniołem. Dziękuję
That could be a great way to pop your back, although it looks like it would totally wreck your neck.
So niCe successful  But so hard for your hair I think better no one do this
FROM NOW ON I CALL YOU A DANCING VIOLEN
thank you for choosing Peoria IL again!
It would be great if you recognized the original artist who taught you how to hang from your hair. Laura Lippert and her friend whom I forgot are the original artists.
A gymnast, a ballerina and a master violinist walk onto a stage and...
this is incredible! 😊
Magical, and still my favourite track.
That was beautiful, you look like you were born into hair hanging not just starting recently, amazing and like I said beautiful!
Estuvo muy bonita me gusta esta cansion
TBH people literally don't get it how deep this is
SO HOT!
The performance video uploaded on YouTube is so beautiful and the best thank you so much in Korea...
Look at your neck x,ray sideways prove who we are
Ela dança e toca de forma lindíssima! Amei ❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏 Talentosíssima
Es un deleite poder escucharla y verla, simplemente es arte y lo que más me gusta es ver cómo disfruta lo que hace.
I can't imagine the hard work you had to do to make this happend in a short period of time Lindsey. You are one in a million.
nope.. Sorry watching this made me feel so sick I kept thinking she was being noosed. Sorry, I love her but this one almost made me vomit. My great grandfather was hung in a prison camp - I know it's a me thing. Just couldn't watch this. I still thumbs up it regardless
какая же ты молодец
Like that 🤩👏👏👏
Love this song, but please don’t ever perform like this again!
Hello Artemis
A great way to decompress your neck and spine!
Lindsey, you are really blessed with the strength and power of God to do these things. Your performances are so amazing. Watching your VLOG reminded me of the things I go through when trying to record songs for my channel. Sometimes I get down and lose confidence and the power of God and the encouragement of people who hear me sing pushes me forward. We are born in Him to takes chances. We have to keep telling ourselves that it is not about us, it is about the people that hear you perform and find great Solis in the music you play.
Toda una hermosa artísta...⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘🥰🌺🌺🌺💕
Me encanta tu música, tus vídeos me fascinan, pero cada vez me sorprendes más 🤩
Молодец, шоу действительно, фантастическое!
I just realized this isn't the dubstep version. .. was the dubstep the original? still sounds good, this is more "movie soundtrack", sweet!
I had not seen this video before the Meet and Greet concert last month when you said how hard this was.  When you paused and simply took a breath in the middle of the song, shows just how difficult and painful it truly was.  No wonder you said never again!! Exquisite as always!
Playing violin is hard....  Lindsey Stirling "really? Let me show you how easy it is..."
You look so cute I Flipping adore you Lindsey mwaaaah
Genial
Артист с большой буквы! Невероятное представление!
Great
молодец...
И все же это великолепно лисичка👍👍👍
Now here's something I've been saying crystalize for about 14months I only seen it about five months ago
you are mind blowing, amazing!
Amo tu música
See Tinkerbell can fly so can angelica we can't activate angelica she's too powerful I'm angel
Remember when Pierce from AGT said you can't fly around and play at the same time? Bet he's eating his words. You're amazing for the growth you've brought to your art!!
Hello Artemis
Eres única Lindsay Lo tienes todo en tus manos  Te admiro en todos los sentidos de las palabras. Te amo hermosa mujer.
The amount of concentration is amazing but.... whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy????  The amount of pain was not worth it. Can see it in the face and tension in the body overshadowed any form of grace. Attach the cables to the hips to do flying acrobatics so you can enjoy it. Audience will see if you are having a blast playing and flying around and will make it that much more enjoyable. This was just painful to watch.
Is that a cello on her shoulder?
wow
0:20
PHENOMENON!!!
Это вообще законно???😦 Сморится потрясающе, но мне те6я жалко(((((((((((
You are remarkable performer and obviously a excellent violinist. I can't believe this is humanly possible. Speechless!  I do hope you put yourself in less pain for your next performance. Your talent alone is already more then enough 💕☮✌
It's perfect!
j'ai vu cette vidéo trés émouvante avant cette magnifique vidéo .....ce courage et cette force que tu as :) c'est magnifique :) merci à toi :) whaaouuu merci Lindsey de ce voyage incroyable :)
Magnifique ✨,incroyable 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Kamis 23 Sept 2021
A little over 12 years ago I remember watching a video of a young lady playing the violin in some public building. I don’t remember if it was a mall or an airport, but it was close to one of my military deployment and I remember thinking: “this girl is quite talented and really good”. Five combat deployment have been experienced and your music has helped a lot, especially since getting out. Your music has emotion and spirit, the kind that tells a story while dancing through the sky. You’ve done a splendid job Ms. Stirling and this performance is a jem for the ages. Well done 🎶🎵🎶.
Desde temprana edad, Stirling tenía una fascinación por la danza, y deseaba tomar tanto lecciones de baile como de violín. En una entrevista con NewMediaRockstars, ella dijo: «... desde que era un niña, siempre he deseado poder bailar, pero mis padres me dijeron: "Tú puedes elegir el violín o puedes elegir bailar, pero no podemos permitirnos los dos", y yo elegí el violín, así que esto es una especie de cumplimiento, es divertido decirlo, pero eso es algo que siempre he querido hacer» en Wikipedia :D
Jesteś Niesamowita. Maże żeby Cie poznać.
OOhh plz , It must have been hurt !! but beyond amazing !!!!
Increible lo que hace!!! 👋👋👋👋
There are no words that can describe how amazing your performance is!
Muy buena
I think you are very inspiring. I think this music should suit in a fantasy film, and inspire people to plant flowers.
I saw your behind-the-scenes video for this. I wish you wouldn't yourself through so much self-inflicted pain to make a music video.
doesn't it hurt?
So wunderschön
👍👍👍👍👍 best dance and best music 🎶 👍
Lindsey may you marry me ?
This is an absolute MASTERPIECE. It is said: The sky is the limit, but clearly creativity and talent knows no limits, and Lindsay Sterling just demonstrated it. Creativity at its best. Touching and inspiring. 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
Ну ты крутая!
I wonder what agt is thinking right now..... they lost out on a great talented musician. Shes Amazing!!!!! I've loved her since day 1 on youtube. Shes plays so beautifully.
schön anzusehen aber spielt sie\?
Speechless
On one side you have amazing talented women like Lindley inspiring millions and being an amazing role model for young girls and young women, and on the other side, the sad display of daft women on twitch jacuzzi.
You're absolutely mesmerizing
Well done . after all that pain .beautiful done. Brave. Don't like seeing people cry.  But u being a virgo.  Perfect performance. . 👌
Amazing
You're amazing!!
Very beautiful 👏👏👏🎶🎶🎶🌹🌹🌹🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️
Лися супер!!!
That was beautiful
Eres genialmente fabulosa y tús melodías son lo máximo
I'm so proud of her! I couldn't even begin to imagine the pain she went through while training for this but in the end she didn't give up Way to go Lindsey!
Это нечто!!!!!
Took weeks to learn this and wow it was worth it
I also dig the drums and strings in the background just build up the arpeggios so well
Bruh so much nostolgia hearing this remixied by her also lowkey why does she look like the ice witch from narnia just me?
What a beautiful melody😭
perfecto!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Guauuuuu😍😍😍😍
And America’s Got Talent didn’t think she had enough talent.
this deserves like 100M views what
Esta chica es increíble . Realizar acrobacias ya es bastante y luego añade el talento musical que tiene eso la convierte en una chica única. 🤩
Oh my Gosh!😍 You’re so amazing🔥🔥🔥🔥
that was interesting, but sure a bit painful.
Ha esto se le llama arte 😍
How could people dislike this? She went through all of this training and pain to please and excite us with something new. Now- as much as we loved it, Linds, don't ever put yourself through so much pain for us!
I watched with great excitement from start to finish.
breathtaking
LoL, love the comments!  Every time I think she has hit her limit she comes through with another and I can’t wait to see what she comes up w next.
you are my wonder woman
Epic. As usual.
The perfect violin video doesn't exist ---  Correction: If it exists
La sirène du violon 🧞‍♀️🎻✌️
What a beautiful inspiration 💖
I remember America’s got talent  “Not good enough to fly through the air and play” well think he ate his words..
Amazing but I was worried about her neck...that can't work how it looks, can it?? But I love her music. Respect to you!
simplemente admirable. eres motivo de inspiración y ejemplo a seguir. Dios te Bendiga Siempre.....
Браво!!! Я ВЛЮБЛЕНА В ВАШЕ ТВОРЧЕСТВО!!!! БРАВО!!!

THIS! Is an artist! She needs to be the one that is put on the media. She is amazing.
Is she actually playing the violin while doing this or did they just put a sound track over the video?
es lo mas lindo que vi en mi vida
каква степен на болка трябва да търпим в името на малко слава , нуждаеш ли се отчаяно от това внимание? уважавам те, но мазохизм в името на слава, не.

I just listened to Whitney Cummings podcast with Lindsey and she shared the story about this performance and i had to watch it right away.  I think anyone that is familiar with her knows what she puts into her performances and this is just another level!  You can see the authenticity of what she was experiencing in her eyes and expressions throughout tbe video.  What an astounding performance!
Maravilloso!!!👏👏👏
Espectacular!!!💪🙏💕🇪🇦
woooowwwwwwwww
This young woman BLOWS ME AWAY...Pure Artistic Talent...Such Flare...such Pizazzz....10,000,000% mindblown Lindsey....YOU ROCK
this is hilarious lol
Ver tu video me sorprendió y el esfuerzo dolor y sacrificio para realizar estas acrobacias y como tocas ese maravilloso instrumento hace que tu video se hermoso gracias por el empeño que le pones me encanto 👏👏👍
I honestly never hated a video so much just because I watch the vlog on how she came too this and it hurt me alot because I never ever wanted too see my Lindsey break down and cry in so much pain that I honestly felt it. I never want too see her cry over this. You are my world Lindsey and I love y¥€ plz stay happy if I can't be there don't hurt urself for us. We are honestly not worth ur talent or ur affection.  Remember me always. My name is Joseph mernyei and I love Lindsey Stirling with everything I have too give
You are an inspiration. All your hard work paid off! No more tears :-) I'm so glad you didn't listen to those judges!
Me encanta... al final si puede volar por los aires y tocar el violín....
Y si pudo volar y tocar el violin al mismo tiempo...
This was made 6 months ago but still it feels like it was made today
Maravillosa, hermoso de pies a cabeza todo lo que haces y emprendes, te admiro mucho sos una gran inspiración!!! ❤️❤️❤️

Super , MAGNÍFICA!
Golden buzzer for AGT
Magnifique et quel travail d'endurance ! Bravo....❤❤❤
Let me tell you a little about what I know about support.  You can only support those who have a relationship with you. Any relationship is co-creation (this is a good analogy), which is very demanding on the skills of both people, otherwise, this co-creation can be painful. If people decide to continue a joint relationship (this also applies to friendship), then both people learn a lot to ensure that this joint creativity is of high quality and that this joint creativity brings pleasure to both. Many people do not want to have the difficulties that relationships (including friendship) bring them. Such people make decisions that they do not want to co-create with this person (do not want a certain level of relationship or do not want this level of friendship), so they move away from the other person. And they sacrifice the level of relationships because some of them don't want to figure out how to overcome these difficulties. And along with this, these people refuse certain levels of support from these people. People often look for such people in a relationship with whom they will need to learn minimal things. That is, they are looking for more comfortable people for themselves. Perhaps they are doing the right thing.  Something that I recently learned and that is not written about in books about relationships. When people have a certain level of relationship with each other, then they become, as it were, one whole. And this means, when, according to biorhythms, one of the two is released from psycho toxin (negative feelings and stuff), then this happens through both people. When such a process occurs, then experiences occur in both people. Mutual support (even over a distance, even if it is mental support for each other) is able to remove negative thoughts from both. If a person does not receive something important in a relationship, then both are experiencing a deficit of what is important - each has something of his own.  It is known in nature that binary stars pull each other up to their level (they have the same luminosity, while the luminosity of a small star rises to the luminosity of a large star, while the luminosity of a large star remains at the same level). I assume the same thing happens in relationships. Some kind of restructuring takes place inside a person and both people are pulled up to the upper level of each other. I assume that this process is also uncomfortable and can be painful too.  The very mechanism of support is to take a part of the state of another person upon yourself. Thus, two people divide the state of one of them in half, and each through himself is freed from this.  This is what I know.
Lindsey, thank you for sharing your feelings about this in an interview with Rolling Stone. I congratulate you on overcoming what you chose to overcome.  I have mixed feelings about this video. On the one hand, it is beautiful. On the other hand, you talked about how difficult and painful this creation was for you. The video shows that you do not get pleasure and enjoyment from the process of realizing this creation. This is also part of your creation. And I cannot join those people who see only the outer side of your creation and who do not ask questions about whether you enjoyed it.  Your experience resonates with the experience I had before. I cannot say that this is a positive experience. I used to think that I have a lot of friends. I took care of them as best I could, made creative gifts and drawings. Individually. I wanted these people to spend more time with me, to share something with me just like that. And it took me several years for me to realize that I am not the person with whom they want to spend time. I did a lot of creative work for my friends. Basically, I took the initiative towards them. And they turned to me when they needed something from me. At other times they spent time with their friends, among whom I was not. It seemed to me that what I was doing for them was important to them and that it could make our friendship stronger. I decided to check some things. I decided that I would give my friends the opportunity to take the initiative in the new year and they would wish me a Happy New Year first. On my page, I warned that I would congratulate people later. I congratulated some friends first. I planned this experiment for a year and I knew the result in advance. After the new year, I knew for sure that I have no value for these people. I knew it would happen, but it still hurt. Probably, it was very unpleasant for me that I put my soul and my attitude towards them into the creations for them, and this was not valuable for them.  If I look back at this experience from today's perspective, then I can describe this experience as follows. I called a lot of people my friends, even though these friends treated me like fans treat the artist. An artist makes content for fans, and that content has temporary value for fans. These fans have friends of their own who are of higher value than what the artist does for his fans. A lot of fans don't care what's inside me. If I need support, the fans are the last people to support me. What my fans thought was content from me were my gifts to them. It is clear that such a big difference between what I do and how they perceive it - it had a negative impact on me. And all the same, I needed somewhere 2-3 years to figure out what's what. When my fans decided that there were more important things in their lives than being in my company, they didn't care that it hurt me. They just walked away. And it taught me that the process of creating my art should bring me pleasure. I like to support and I support some friends. Sometimes, it is painful creativity (there are different features that I was able to learn about recently), but this painful process does not go beyond when it has a bad effect on health.  I appreciate you and I do not want you to experience the unpleasant sensations that I went through. I also want to support you on your path, even if you decide to experience such an experience, which may be unpleasant or painful for you.  I am sorry that during this period I did not support you. I think that if I supported you (how it will turn out), then it would be easier for you to go through this experience.
Meravigliosa👍👏☺
офигеть...правда в ноты не успевает поаппдать...но мне все равно нравится))
凄すぎる！クルクル🌀しながら弾いてる🎻カッコイイ✨ 綺麗すぎます💕
Oh you are so an inspirational person...i love what you do. But don't hurt yourself! Love u Lindsey!
Lindsey, you are such a beautiful and very strong woman! I've been listening to you since I was a kid and every time, I'm inspired, my soul is at rest, I get goosebumps. You are so amazing that it is impossible not to admire you. I cried while watching this clip because I am so proud of you. I grew up with you, you are my biggest idol. Always smile and always be strong.  I love you so much!🤗🤗💚💚 (sorry for my English😅)
This seriously looks like something from Cirque du Soleil.
I felt like crying this is so beautiful! Lindsey is such a strong woman ready to push herself to the end
She's the most amazing violinist in the world, I love her music.
I really don't get the top comment... She'll do what she likes... It's not by our say, it's not by anyone's say. She tried it, wanted too, it's up to her if she ever wants to do it again or not. And it's really not anyone else's say on if someone hurts themselves or not. Concern is one thing, but a person makes their own decisions, end of story.
OW?
Очень больно... Очень красиво исполнено...
Grattis
Это нечто. Концентрация Воля. Я влюблен))))
한국...다시 와주면 안돼요?

Дивовижне шоу👍👍👍👍♥️
I would get headache not just by the twirls but the pressure or pull of the  hair.
I pray everyday that GOD protects her so she can do the beautiful work that she does
她的头疼吗😎️
It is very painful to look at it, but it is also fascinating!
I play violin and I’ve been listening to this song on repeat for months through Alexa music.I have trouble sleeping and this song in particular really comforts me during both those nights as well as my high anxiety moments. I like too listen to each note and try to identify what string it’s on and the placement. It helps ground me. It was 3 am and I’m sick so can’t sleep. I was listening to this song and my sister ended up getting up to go to the bathroom. She heard the song and in the dead of night she said “that’s a really pretty song”.  I then thought, I’ll send it to her. I looked it up on YouTube and saw this video. I watched it and thought Oh my… this is so much more than I was expecting. I then googled you and saw you danced as well as play music among other things. I remember reading that you have to know to play the song very well before you can have fun with it and dance. I thought My goodness! That’s fun? Looks very painful. So I started watching your other videos and didn’t see the hair hanging you did here. I then saw your vlog on this. It was poweful. Definitely not fun. I watched this video again with even stronger understanding. I do not know how you stayed strong, didn’t break down, or give up. Whoever I saw you nearing the ground I was looking for you to eagerly move your legs to relieve the weight yet you restrained yourself. That had to be very challenging not to rush the last few seconds of pain.  I learned my favorite self soothing song is so much more then I ever realized, you are so much more than I ever realized.
This. Is. Strength. 💕
Is this live ? Is she really playing at the time 😶
Я поставил дизлайк не потому что не понравилось а потому что это издевательство над собой. И ради  чего ? Так не надо больше очень прошу.
Wow wow wow such hability!, didn't you get a headache or a neckache after that?
Lindsey has great talent: Bring on 10 musician who can do that!
Just goes to show the mindset and being able to endure pain so eloquently. 🙏🕊️👍👍😎😎
You dance gracefully lindsey and i really love crystallize ❤️ all your hardwork paid off
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
Its amazing How she can control Love you😍
👏👏👏👏😍
All around beautifully beautiful. It's almost like the violin has a voice of its own. And the choreography in the video so beautifully done.
Beautiful performance but she should have it straped around her waist.  Hair? That has to hurt!? 😬

Wow 👀😱😨👍👌👍😘
she's absolutely the most talented artist i've ever seen !!!
The violin has through to her veins
В высшей степени профессионализм. Но надеюсь ваш продюсер больше не будет придумывать столь мучительные для вас номера.
🥰 Brak mi słów 🥰💪
Amazing!!!!!!😱😱😱😱😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗i lovet !!!!!!!
Amazing ! So graceful and yet your concentration never broke. Beautiful but scary. Lindsey, you need never do this again, you conquered it !
Great job so proud of you you star
Great music I would not do it not even for $ 100 million well done to the courage
The audio was prerecorded right? There's no way she did that while spinning on her hair in the air.
That was incredible without a doubt but now I have to apologize to my hair and scalp for watching this. bravo
I can't help my self but to watch it again and again
Can I ever do it wow, she is so uqnie
Looking back at Americas got talent saying she's not good flying around in the air, well she's proved them all wrong, she's accomplished 2 challenges in the video all combined into 1! She's amazing🔥🖤
Super nice ✌️💞💐
LOS JUECES ANTES: "No podrás volar y tocar al mismo tiempo"  STIRLING: " Cómo que no podré, ya lo verán hombres de poca fé"   LOS JUECES AHORA: "😱😱😱😱"
Whaooooooo..... juste whaooo. Elle me transporte déjà dans ses musiques et ses clips.. mais la je suis transporter dans les airs
I'm really, really in love with this beautiful artist, she came from the stars✨🌟⭐✨✨✨

Who ever disliked this video (probably the AGT judges) should go through the training that she went through to do this video and see how they feel afterwards. Lindsey is AMAZING.
Extraordinaire performance, et quelle beauté, je reste sans voix...
Mi amor!!!
Wow just wow.
talent without training is useless we are to be and no disappear mind and body spirit are you something magical and beautiful
Me encanta 😍 es un ejemplo de superación está chica 👏👏
The pain. she is literally swinging from her hair.
Perfeito, inacreditávelmente Perfeito ❤❤

I don't know....this just seemed weird to me.
GURL NOOOOO This must've hurt badly, NEVER DO THIS AGAIN PLEASE!😭
Wish she was into metal like graveworm a dying beauty
Es increíble 😻 ojalá un día pueda ir a un concierto
This is definitely my favorite so far by mrs. Lindsey. We r awsome!!!
Anything is possible when this girl does it ...
Perseverancia a la perfección
1.6 m  very low ... Sad
I lost count of how many times I watched this video and every time I watch it I cry 😭 She is incredibly amazing😮
Боже мой, Lindsey Stirling, береги себя Солнце ☀️ береги себя.
Your dedication to your art is beyond imagination. Your hard work is impressive and you created an amazing piece of art.
Eres grande!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Definitivamente es su voz a través del violín, y  tiene una voz realmente hermosa.
Absolutamente increíble 🙂👏😲❤️
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Not gonna lie; my jaw DROPPED when I found this. My first question was: HOW?   Goodness, Lindsey. You are so talented, and your determination is so admirable.
Well everyone Lindsey shows us in this incredible piece of art what is possible if you go beyond of what you thoght possible to create something so amazing you only belive it when you see it. This gives me strength because I know that the same strength is in me, in you and in every human being. Respect Lindsey you have made the impossible once more possible.
You are elegant and beautiful like the violin in your hand... I admire your every work.
Хотел бы я ещё услышать, что за звук скрипки записала камера которая снимала, а не фонограмму :) Наверно та ещё боль для ушей. Надо было хотя бы кусочек дать послушать в титрах, это была бы хорошая самоирония. Но вообще кроме шуток, примите мое уважение, это было экстремально, красиво и интересно, даже в своих корнях волос легкий фантомный зуд почувствовал, когда представлял что вы ощущаете.
🥰😍🤩
Gau..
too beautiful 👏👏👏 ♥ ️
Gosh I watch this so much to calm down my emotions
She is one of the best and the most inspirational and motivating person. She is awesome. Never seen something like this. Amazing
Me llamo Maga
Helou
Me me gusta mucho tu música Lindsay
Perfect👋👋👋👋⭐
Vous Salé monrir
When she wants to fly, she fly. Very talented and love her taste. Love all of her music and performances
Imagine being the guy on the other end of that rope. Dont let go dont let go. His nerves are steel
You are such a gifted, talented, and strong person. You do such amazing things and you're such an inspiration to me as well as to many others.  Thank you and God bless you.
WOW what ,this women is unbeleveble,,I love
Dios mío es increíble tanto talento 💞, pero lo que más sorprende es hasta donde a llegado creyendo en lo que le gusta hacer, es demasiado dulce e inspirador, su vida es una inspiración y un deleite ......... Eres única
Este video es puro arte❤️
A la madre, se va a quedar pelona
Das hat mein ❤ sehr bewgt
Tut das nicht weh 🤔😳😳😳😲😯
This woman Is awesome
You are so amazing Lindsey Stirling. Like I always say you can do anything!
I cringe every time I watch this since the first time I've seen it on your Home for the Holidays virtual concert but I can't deny how beautiful it is
She must have had to consult with numerous safety experts, kept her neck taught the whole time, and really trained her muscles for this. Think about it; all of your body weight is literally hinging on your neck. One wrong move and you’ve got a serious injury on your hands. Or worse.   I am AMAZED!
Hermoso 👌🏽
Veramente  strepitosa!!!💝
,free diré alex
How much hair did she lose after this?
When I’m playing minecraft I just turn this on and play
This is the most beautiful video I've ever seen 🥺
എന്നെങ്കിലും ഇവിടെ മലയാളി വരും വരാതിരിക്കില്ല വരുമ്പോൾ നീലം മുക്കി പൊയ്ക്കോ. 🙂
Thank you so much Lindsey for this wonderful amazing inspiring dance!
Ja! Quedo! El juez que le dijo que o que bailara o tocara pero no ambos que jamás podría tocar y bailar por el Escenario, además de eso sonar bien!  Bueno! Je jeje nunca subestimes el talento al artista!
I literally can't stop listening to this masterpiece, love it Lindsey
Amazing job Lindsey Stirling.
💖
I've been follow lindsey since 12 years ago... Waw she is masterpiece
Wooooowwww
A rare glimpse into the elegant and majestic mind of Lindsey Stirling.
Absolutely divine !
How do you do that???????????????? I love it😍😍😍😍😍
at the end I can see her face and inside she is screaming "now get me off this hook!!!!!!"
It's so amazing that while I was using this song helped me comne back to reality. Then when I'm about to give up and go back out to using you comne out with this. THANK YOU. you don't know just how much this helps me stay clean
그녀는 가히 신의 경지에 도달했다고 생각한다.
I watched your hair-hanging vlog just before this - and then I watched this, and just the strength, coordination, and courage that you have is so amazing and inspiring. I can't imagine how much it would have hurt, hair hanging like that. But you did it!
Goosebumps
ここまでする？ちょっとむりすぎる
Can we just take a moment and watch her physically tell herself she could do this and it showed through? Amazing, I have loved your music for many many years and I still love it to this day. Please keep being amazing!
What a Beast
Um verdadeiro espetáculo
*This is amazing no.8 of World.*
Klasse einfach nur Klasse :)
Breathless you were... So was I watching this performance from the comfort of an armchair. You never cease to amaze us, Lindsey...
Woooooooow 😲😯😍😍
simplesmente perfeito, nada é fácil na vida  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aky-J-b9LcU
Very beautiful, I unseyou went through alot of pain for that but u did it for us and it turned out amazing ❤️
My face the whole time: 😳😲😮, absolutely incredible ❤️
Wow... 😍😍
WOUAH, amazing prestation,
Debe ser playback
😳😯
Amazing... The Real Magic through the real pain.  Thank you for your Music and for your Art!
Wow you’re amazing keep going love you  Your music is awesome great love you
1:01  ibai
just WOWh!
This was one of the first tunes I heard of lindsey in the snowy caves and I've loved the music ever since this remake was extraordinary well done 👏
Génius
FENOMENALE......
1.2k people are jealous of the hair hanging exceptionality here, or they mad they can't do it. I bet if they could get thier soul to shine like hers, they would have hit the thumbs up button.
Lindsey is absolute, brilliant energy woman !!! Respect !!! Amazing experience !!! American talent !!! Beautiful young lady !!! I LOVE YOU. Johnny
I saw the behind the scenes of your training for this, I cried with you and seeing the final results makes me cry again knowing you never gave up to give your fans this beautiful moment. The dedication and perseverance shows.
Just when she was talented enough she amazes us further
She's amazing!!! 🧡
I can't walk and talk at the same time most days and there she is looking flawless flying and playing. Love her so much!! Such an inspiration.
Fantastic
just wonderful
After seeing this, then the hair hanging vlog? I came back to watch this over and and over again. To think all this was real, this performance deserves a billion views!!
This Woman will never stop amazing me she’s incredible!
God bless U lindsey stirling! Ur awesome! Such a great talent! Dont stop!👋👋👋🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘💗💗💗💗💗💗🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You can literally see the pain in her eyes... Lindsey, my biggest respect that you finished this, but please do something less painful next time 💗
Скиньте....
Усе со усеми
Чепущилки либо то либо
I legit had a dream last night that I was doing this, except I was suspended by my beard... Pretty sure Lindsey was in it too.   Hope that makes someone else laugh, because I woke up laughing at myself.
Loved the ice video as well , very nice touch adding dub
Love love love!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFuNXA_M6SQ
I gave it a like because of how dificult had to be, but, if you ask me, there was no need to do something THAT painful. NO NEED AT ALL
What I would like to know:  Did she really play this song clean and correct while "flying" (it seems impossible to me) or did she play a placeholder and they use a playback-studio version with this video, wich makes way more sense to me. Still even with playback mastering this choreography within 3 months and 24 Lessons from 0 to 100% is very impressive. But it is this speedrun that made the pain.  Yes, the first trainings are painful, but it takes it time and a normal performer uses 3-4 month just to learn hanging full body weight because they need to grow stronger neck muscels and strengthen the body for this. It is important to respect the learning process of the body. Later, if the hair is done properly and the learning time is long enough there is no pain anymore (quoting an artist from circus solei).
So that's how people go bald. :D
I love your passion, your morals, and your music! You are an amazing inspiration for many and we are truly blessed to be able to enjoy your talents! Thank you so much for being you!
Just.....incredible. Words can’t do that justice
WoW, it's magic. So beautiful. 😍
Quelle beauté ds la danse et la musique
Desafio kkkkkk
...So no head?
Que lindo, sua respiração, concentração, todo ato. apaixonante .,
Como isso é possível Lindsey, incrível parabéns, sem palavras.
Wow Lindsey 🥵 That’s amazing!

WOW😱
Seen this video so many times, there isn't words to describe the talent of this young lady
How does that not hurt her hair or her head?
how do so many people dislike this?! it's straight up AMAZING
Awesome performance.
That was quite the workout! And a HUGE achievement!!! But even though I'm in awe of this performance, for some reason I would have preferred it if you did things like this in a harness instead of being the harness yourself. Not that I thin you can't do it, you've proven you can, but because it just doesn't feel like you. I don't know how to explain it.
In my humble opinion the less we can do a thing  the more valuable it is. Displayed Masterfully by The white Violinist her Self.  Made my Monday. Still listening to your old medley from 8 years ago brings me to tears... 😢
Wow. This was incredibly beautiful.  You have a special beauty and strength.  Never lose track of everything given. It's a gift to the world. ❤❤❤
Atroce...  je n'arrive même pas à me concentrer sur la chanson que j'adore pourtant
espetacular 👏👏👏👏🤩
I swear she has the most exotic violins
there's nothing like her
The keychain on my bag:
bizarro
Умничка, такого ни кто и никогда не сделает !!!! Ты супер я твой фанат и твоя музыка помогает отвлечься от суеты и не только мне я так думаю. Продолжай радовать нас своим творчеством!!!!! Я тебя люблю и уважаю как музыкант музыканта!!!! Успехов во всех начинаниях!!!!
Nahh this the new version of a harness !  When I have my hair in a high pony it kills my head so I cant imagine how much this would hurt!  Linsey:use my hair   Everyone:oh my  Plus I'm on my dads ipad XD
I can never get my runs so clear her runs sounds like when cardi b says OK klurr
Just love the way you are and I cannot stop watching this video. J'aime beaucoup cette vidéo et je suis très heureux de voir que tu es une femme très belle et talentueuse
Lindsey Stirling is a true artist
Definitivamente ella vuela con el violin cuando toca, siempre he pensado de ella estoy pero esto ya lo confirma
👍🙌
nobody creates this before!! it is out of your free, really loving, own way! amazing what can arise out of this! (out of real freedom, independence, love)! thank you very very much! deep thank! p.s.: you are a very good dancer!
She must’ve used a lot of shampoo to do this.
Epoustouflant ! on retient son souffle tout le long.
Can't believe the number of views is so low for this, there should be so many more than that.

I love you, Lindsay, and I love every creation of yours that I've come across, but my head hurts just watching this! Keep creating!  I adore you!!
I need you to do toss a coin to your Witcher cover lol
Beautiful!!!!

Es de otro planeta ❤

What a nice job 🎼👍❤👍🎼
Вот и слушайте своего Моргенштерна ,а я пожалуй тут останусь
wow. Came here from Whitney Cummings' podcast. And this is truly amazing the endurance it took to go through the pain of learning this and actually executing. Amazing work!
Came here after hearing her interview with Whitney Cummings. Was not disappointed
Lyndsey, je suis admiratif tu sais danser, tu compose, et tu fais des vidéo plaisir à voir. Tu es un grande artiste au monde pour moi.
Simplemente increíble 🛐✨
Stop She did a good job.
the song is beatiful yes, but please dont do that again, your fans dont like seeing you in pain, maybe make like some wings that move automatically or something and hook yourself with a invisible harness, but please dont do that again.
This is jaw dropping, she's mastered every single element of this!!
Tears streaming down my face as I watched this... A perfect example that you don't need words to music to move you. ❤️
I need an advil
It really looks amazing, but it hurt me to just watch you go through that much pain! And to be honest: I can't understand why somebody would want to do something that painful voluntarily. The song itself is just beautiful and I think your usual dancing and playing the violin would have been enough. I don't want to call your performace here less beautiful, I just don't like seeing somebody hurting themself.
Howie Mandel doesn't think violinist should fly... I think Howie Mandel would rather live under a rock!
:o very great art! never have seen such a thing before! but autsch!
Lindsey Stirling, I have only just discovered you but your skills are mind blowing and you are hands down one of the most talented people to have walked this earth... Bravo!!
Absolutely amazing, Brilliant Talent. Beautiful
Ouch.
0:45  Who can read lips?
. Human, yet so close to divinity sometimes...
There's some people still living under a rock... like Howie Mandel.... there's beautiful circus performers that Dance by their hair... Lindsey Stirling is known for being a violinist... Lindsey Stirling is also known for being an incredible dancer... Lindsey Stirling is untouchable and Unstoppable!
Waaaaoooo
I watched the vlog about your process and I'm so proud of you 💙 This video turned out so emotional, brings tears into my eyes 💎
Oie... No te duele el cabello causa????
Oh my Ghosh she is so amazing!! I wish I could play like that 😱😎
Admirable destreza, belleza de cada nota musical... 🎶
Es increíble, hasta me dieron ganas de llorar  😭😍
OK...... this whole thing is beautiful,  but the most amazing part is I'm getting vibes that you wanted to prove you can fly through the air while playing to those who said you COULDN'T ! And to me that strength and pain you went through is more beautiful than the act you put on . You amaze me Lindsay.
it's really beautiful
This video deserves more than 100 million views... So sad to see such talent not receiving enough credit
This is so amazing!!
just fky! crystalize on top ;)
An incredible performance by anyone's standard. Bravo!
Wow incredible🎶✊❤
Wow 😳 extremely difficult task & extremely beautifully done ✅  It’s a proof of mind over matter 💫👏💐
She's grown so much 💜
❤️ lololololololol
yeah, bdsm has many forms.
Amazing!!!!!!!! Woooow!!!!
It’s almost like flying .. beautiful .
Genius
Beautiful and amazing. That must've hurt so bad though!! My hair hurts just watching.
this is literally art
Amazing performance as always, absolutely love the music and dancing too👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🥺🥰🥰. Can’t imagine how painful it was with you swinging by your hair🥺😕, hope that you’re ok Lindsey ☺️
Странный экстпреонизм. Зачем гимнастику с аэробикой сочетать если ты умеешь играть на скрипке?
fantástico,Song Beautiful
ella es increibleee💞💞💞😍
@themusicshed cover this!!
Knowing how painful it must’ve have been to film this, the agonizing hours of training that led up to this moment and how beautifully executed that was brought tears to my eyes. What a work of art, and you gave it everything you had. Bravo. Your talent, your passion, and the will to keep going despite wanting to quit . You inspire me❤️
I wonder how isn't the chain spinning and then spinning her back the opposite direction!
That is like walking on the moon!
Lindsey es realmente increíble  ,guau es realmente asombrosa
The best artist in the world ^^ !
This act let me without air in my lungs and words my mouth 🙈🤧😱 wow!
It was worth the pain and with that you know that you should never give up and that if you fall you will get up again as many times as possible
눈물나게 아름답지만 눈물나게 아프겠어요 . 대단한 열정을 보여주셔서 감사합니다.
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱💀
Такого я ещё не видел)
I wish I could like it every time I watch it♡♡♡🥺🥺
What a breath taking performance!!! You’re amazing!! I love you and your music 🥰 💖
The best I loved it👌👍💅
I’m your biggest fan Lindsey Stirling
she uses the bow like a blade so precise and sharp not to mention profound. im envious.
How is it posible? Amazing!
Восхищаюсь Вами ;-)
I love her music and all her videos. But it hurts me too see her in pain...Beautiful video as always, but she has nothing to prove....she is beautiful already....why do you do this to yourself?!?! I just don’t get it. We already know your amazing!
So so so soooo gooddd
It's very powerful!
wcześniejsza wersja jest fajniejsza lecz ta też robi wrażenie  mam nadzieje że nie powyrywała sobie zbyt dużo włosów ;]
You can all do what you want 😘
AMO DE MAIS😍😍😍😍😍😍❤
My heart hurts...beautifull!!!
Pain
How very beautiful. I use to figure skate. I love and appreciate you. ❤
Это конечно шок
Amazing 👍👍👍😘❤️❤️❤️
Xd que semejante artista 👌 mis respetos por darnos tanto arte y muchas gracias 😁🤩
I want this music for my funeral
If you watch the vid of Lindsey training for this you realize have motivated she is and how amazing she is.
Magnifico seu trabalho, sou um grande fã, imagino o quão difícil isso foi para ser finalizado assim tão bem, parabéns !!!
Умница! оно того стоило!
WOW just WOW!!!! I didn't believe and still looking for some rope which hold you there, it really only by you hair?! didnt knew hair is connected so strong that its can carry you and much more with this beautiful dancing :-O
There are genuine moments where I can see Lindsey being extremely excited to just fly around but although he cool demeanour this  is no easy feet
its jast a lusion , they  hang en with hier
amazing :D
Watched it. Liked it. But wish it was never done. Please be careful.
There’s better ways to play the violin then being swung around by your dome.
Ich wünsche mir sie mal musikalisch zu begleiten. Obwohl ich noch am Anfang stehe mit der Gitarre
Got talent España
spectacular!!!
Can someone tell me why she did this?? The should be deleted!! So sad!
Me encanta
Потрясающая.
Да твою же мать, если это не наложение звука, а реальная игра, это пздц..... тогда ты лучшая за всю историю скрипки... (хотя так крутиться и играть, похоже на обман...)
00:12 show mode ON!
like round table rival nightcore
some of hers are fast
yep they right
Amazing!!! DO NOT DO THAT AGAIN
The more I watch Lindsey doing this the more admiration I have for this truly wonderful Pearson ❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍😎
This.  Woman.  🤘From Arkansas Lind!
You went through so much pain to make this video Lindsay.  It brings a new meaning to suffering for your art. Thanks for continuing to be a wonderful role model .
my back appreciated this video
Wow! ☺️☺️.
This young lady is an absolute force to be reckoned with! I've not watch all of her videos, but I can't imagine all the dance training, choreographic planning, video direction and production ... just all the time and effort it must take Lindsey and her crew to craft such superb audio and video creations! I understand she didn't win some AGT award, but ... WOW!!! Such talent, creativity, and physical ability this lady has! Her music and video productions are just ... mesmerizing. And that's not a term I use loosely. I'm looking forward to seeing her perform live!
this and old songs of her are perfect
Ok this just proves that Lindsey is the best violinist in the entire world
I remember seeing how difficult this was for you to overcome and I just want to give you a hug and say well done.
Отличная задумка, меня весь клип не отпускала мысль- как ей не больно?
Absolutely breathtaking, it brought me to tears
Ow
Amazing Lindsey you can be proud of your hard work we love it <3
Beautiful, in your face Piers Morgan!
If Paganini was still alive,he must be impressed by you!
😍👏❤🔥
Wow increíble, una princesa de la musica y el baile.
12 year olds trying this at home and ending up dead
Amazing 💞
Just unbelievable 🤩🤩😮🥳
😯 wow
your shampoo is very good 👍🏼😅
Enjoyed it very much you,re up there with the rest of the volinist.
So AMAZING... wonderfully .. ❤️❤️❤️Greetings from Germany 💋💋💋💕💕💕💕
На волосах висит?
Sagenhaft......Respekt !!!!
It was hard but you made it, you made it and it is success, we are so proud of you ❤️
Beautiful 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I really hurt seeing you doing it. It is very beautiful but don't do it again.  You don't have to go to extremes to win our hearts.   You have already achieved this by your whole career ;-)  Love from Greece.
Mujer increíblemente fuerte,  por eso te adoro.
The most amazing thing I’ve ever seen.  Thank you!💖
Me encanta su música te da una ecenxia de libertad a paz y me da ganas de escucharla todo el dia
Wahnsinn was Sie da macht. Da verzeih ich es Ihr dass Sie nach 9 Monaten immer noch kein Breif mit Autogramm zurück gesendet hat trotz reply coupon ^^
She's amazing in pretty much every video I've ever seen her in because of her amazing dance moves and her amazing violin playing but this right here is epic look at how fast she spinning and she still playing perfectly in tune this is insane
semplicemente spettacolo, ogni musica mi fa venire la pelle d'oca,
姥爷6天前去世，是琳姐的曲子让我坚强了起来，感谢୧( ⁼̴̶̤̀ω⁼̴̶̤́ )૭
Супер !!!!! Нет слов.
На это можно смотреть вечно Браво👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
she really needs to learn to wear shoes and keep feet clean
Excellent musician
Я бы хотела чтобы мои детки с вами познакомились. Очень прошу ответить!
Very very nice special second act 🙂
Bad.....
Dang, this is probably the first time in a while where we've seen her with her orchestra face on the entire time...... Lindsey don't scare me like that again--
You are one of the most talented persons I know. You made it look so easy, but we all know how much painful that was.   I admire every single drop of sweat and tears you took, it was all worth it.
Lindsey and her music has been helping me in many different days. So grateful plus her music is so beautiful. Outstanding 💕
Wow
Einfach lächerlich. Dazu noch durchschnittlich im Geigen aber dennoch erfolgreich. Traurig. Die Leute nehmen halt alles an, da sie selbst meist talentfrei sind.
Amazing. No words to describe it
Congratulations little sister , from merida yucatán whit love LDS
Who else is amazed when she spins and still plays the song perfectly?!?!?!
You are crazy and filled with talent like i can’t believe americans got talent said no to you😍🤩!! *Honestly not gonna lie, but if I hooked my hair like that my hair will be detached from my scalp😄😅*
I have great admiration for her work, I think the performance is incredible and how well she handles the instrument ... without equal!
This is so amazing!
Nossa, se tivesse como, dava like 1k de vezes, ela é muito inspiradora, só o fato de acompanha-la tem me dado muita força!!! Deus te abençoe Lindsey!!
Prefer routine using hands and arms and not hair. Lindsey you do not need to play your violin while doing air dancing. You are so talented, please do not  overdo to the point of hurting yourself. You have enough fame and money and fans who love you. You are talented enough just playing violin, no need for acrobatics anymore. Your music is brilliant all by itself.
crazy beautiful pro
Proverbs 16:31 - The hoary head [is] a crown of glory, [if] it be found in the way of righteousness.
masterpiece.
Bravo! Lindsey.  Obviously still in pain but you overcame and performed like a pro!  Nice work setting a challenge and achieving it.
Warning ⚠️ Jesus is coming share the Gospel and spread his word.... ITS NOT A JOKE
She has got to be the best violinist in the world. I absolutely love her
Да, просто охринеть.
Whoooooo beatifull girll and talent yasss i love song and the arts

❤️
That was the most stunning video ever 💗
Still waiting for the DVD to be released!
:O angel
GODINEEEE
Excellent my Love Lindsey Stirling <3
Her neck muscles must that of a F1 driver ...
OOO... MMM... GGG... CIRQUE D' SOLEIL EAT YA'LLS HEART OUT!!!
This gave me chills.  She said she knew it would be beautiful if she could do it and it was more than just beautiful.  That is ART.
Wow just wow my breath is gone wow

https://youtu.be/lwtKWfJmodI
perfekt music to do my homework Thanks!!!
"Your not good enough to fly through the air and play violin at the same time"  ...
Baş döndürücü bir performans ((: Harika
Bellissima!!! Sono senza parole!
Love your music.
knowing how much you were hurting while learning to do this . . . how it brought you to major gut-wrenching sobs each time you faced another training session . . . and then to see this . . . you, Lindsey Stirling, can DO hard things!💖
1 Min into filming and Lindsey`s head pops clean off. Stage goes silent. Director mutters "s@#t..."
просто вау....
“No eres tan buena, para intentar volar y tocar al mismo tiempo" decían. Sigue adelante, que cuenesfuerzo, constancia y la ayuda de Dios podrás lograr todo lo que te propongas 💪💪💪💪💪💪💐💐💐💐💐
this was gorgeous !!!  but plz don't do that again , you had a hard time shooting it  . those tears were not wasted
This proves she has to be one of the greatest violinist of all times.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Again, this is my best favorite music of the last year. Music is fire, and your torment is very painful to watch. Although there are fewer views than the new clip.
Whoooaaaaaaattttttt ?!!!  This is amazing !!! Mind-control to the hilt !!! SALUTE to you Lindsey !!! You're just GREAT !!!
This makes me curious just how much she could/was actually playing during the routine.  Particularly in the rapid spin portion, it looked like all she could manage to just hold the spin.  That was cool.  A behind the scenes live audio version of the room through that would be cool to see.
I don't understand why people dislike the video, it's so amazing 😲

Where can I buy the orchestral background it sounds so good
fake playing
Эта музыка не стоила всех твоих мучениний. Но сама музыка - это шедэвр, за много месяцев Одна из лучших. люблю тебя!!!
Next up, Lindsey balancing on a tight rope in the sky while playing the violin! She's truly amazing. Whenever I hear or see her, I have to stop what I'm doing and listen and watch. She's so talented!
lindsey, you are awesome, that had to hurt
Fluorescence uv 🌈🌈🌈
Lo que hace esta hermosa mujer es unico se merese todoslos like de todo el mundo no cualwuiera puede hacer lo que ella hase, la adoro, mi idola
I use to listen to your music wen I was 5 or 6 and I forgot how good I were I know you probably won’t see this but you’re amazing
this video is strong and ten years music of epic music of crystalliz my favorite song on you ^^ thx for you beutifull music Lindsey <3
she floats in weightlessness playing the violin in space inside a starship
You're amazing as always, Lindsey. Please never do this again, it was painful to watch, I can't even imagine how painful to actually do. My hair off to you.....I mean "hats off to you"  >.>
She didnt give up after AGT and most people do. And for that I'm invredibly proud. "You cant fly through the air and play" yeah? Well Look at her now 💗
Wow... just wow. There's no words that can justify this beauty, this Injustice, this masterpiece, the insanity within sanity. Bravo, Bravo 👏
Бред .
WOW!!!  Asombroso!!!❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏
It is very special jumping while playing the violin I learned years a go because of Lindsey. If jumping is hard, then there is no word to describe this.
watching this makes my head hurt! Lindsey are you ok!!!!
incredible
Legendary performance . Carry on sister 🙂🙂
F por el cabello
Wonderful Lindsey. Sublime🦚
Впечатляющее выступление. Тем более после просмотра тренировок, боль и слёзы, но, в конце концов, она справилась))) хлоп-хлоп-хлоп)))
Es que simplemente es hermoso lo que haces
Оболденно🥺 Рай для ушей и глаз🤩
i have a urgent need for this bodysuit.its sparkly.i want it.
My 3yo watched this and called you a "shiny magical princess". Magical because she is convinced you're flying in this.
wow wow wow super :)
That looks like fun!!!
tu música y verte bailar me da serenidad y tranquilidad . Mil gracias eres especial
Next step flesh hooks?
Très joli
Lindsey I'd love to hear more about what this song means to you. I showed my daughter your vlog about hair hanging and we just love your music.
You are Lindsey that s make the ear heart and all feelings gracious when u play violent and performe, u are unique and u are VERRY VERRY GOOD   Bravo🌹
Magnifique 😍 je l'adore grave
You are amazing :)
Eres fabulosa!!!!!
SO beautiful, Lindsey... but...  please don't put yourself through that! We love you! ❤
Som maravilhoso 🤩😍

Great, bravo such a charismatic mesmerizing Beautiful girl and so plays, on such a forgotten instrument, tere ya vash FaNaT from Russia.ъ
🎶
Gavi Would Be Proud
Muy bello
Admit it - you watched this twice or more.
Hello, I am new to the channel, I have been reviewing your videos, I am very impressed by your videos, especially the (from Home For The Holidays) you are really an artist.
She's beautiful ❤️
oye :,o the hair aïe les cheveux !! ^^' Aïe la nuque, tête, tout le corps ! ^^' Mais quel prouesse !!! Bravo !! <3
Breathtaking...an inspiration to young girls and women...you can accomplish anything.
what a stunning performance. this type of sports is so agile and graceful and hard to pull off and now think about playing the violin at the same time. mindblowing!
this is probably my favorite song of hers
Wait y’all is she actually playing the violin live like that or am I just dumb? Like I can’t tell. I think it’s genuine but there are pets of it where the editing makes is difficult to distinguish her arm/hand movements so I’m not sure.
I can imagine doing that must of hurt, hair hanging like that, but beautiful music though, I’ve always been metal and rock only until about 8 months stumbled across Lindsey sterling and I gotta admit I really dig the violin music a lot more then I expected.
The geatest thing about Lindsey is how she moves in a way I what want to call 'martial ballet'.  It's dance, but there's a gracefully aggressive purpose to it, like a kata form.  She could drop the fiddle and just dance and it would still be mesmorizing.  The first time I saw her bust out and move like the instrument wasn't enough to channel what she wanted to convey I thought "she's having fun, good for her!".  I didn't think she would be able to build her agility and athleticism and still be able to play at her level.  She's literally a joy to watch because it's  clear she's the real deal and uses every tool she's got to channel her emotions into the audience.  Bless her for everything she does so all of us can escape into something that reaches the transcendent point that artists of every type chase for their entire lives and only a few unlock
People who dislike this video are whats wrong with this world for every single one who dis liked this video I'd truly love to see you even try this.....
You alright? That looks very painful
Maravillosa, excepcional. Espero que quienes le cerraran puertas hoy la admiren. Grandiosa¡¡¡¡
Perfecta y con estilo propio. Gracias  por tu arte
Overkill missions， It looks like abuse to me and it feels more painful than music．
GRACEFUL AND VERY BEAUTIFUL. Yet totally insane!!!
You are amazing!! Everything you succeeded it's wonderful! Congratulations!
なにこれ😳 凄い❗️ほんとに弾いてるの❓
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
No sé marea al dar tanta vuelta ...q hermoso  vídeo
Wow,  such strength, such power. Amazing grace and beauty! I've always liked Crystallize. What a way to add to such an amazing song!
To the 1.1k that thumbs downed this video, apparently you have no concept in talent.......
Linsdey...es muy talentosa, y su música es inspiración
This is the highest you could’ve ever taking ‘flying while playing’ too
Que aguante de su cabeza al colgarse así y más del cabello para no safarse
Linda demais!
thank you next
Τέλειο εγώ που παίζω βιολί δεν μπορώ να το κανω
My first thought What's that hairdo for? Then *OHHH...* I am once again impressed by your work Lindsey. The fact that you can maintain the Instrumental performances despite the physical exertion is impressive to begin with, but this is on an entirely different level. The fact that you can even keep on hitting those notes, or any notes, while spinning like that...is astonishing to be honest. This doesn't even account for the strength of your neck in this performance. I know that the physiology of humans is pretty astonishing anyways, but still.
I can't watch this video, it's just so uncomfortable to watch knowing how in pain you are and you look really uncomfortable and suffering on it, I don't think it was worth the suffering
C'est vraiment une fille incroyable que soit niveau talent comme au niveau force mentale. Elle mérite d'être entendue c'est une pépite 😍
WOAW...:)
I'm so worried about her neck I forgot to enjoy the performance  😂
She find the way to get back her airy of youth, but it costs... From the other side, it's no more Crystallize, though the music's the same.
She's like a fairy.elegant and beautiful beyond anything mortal
You are my inspiration to achieve my goals every day that passes
how is she so  underrated like COME ONNNNNN  that was a performance worth a BILLION  dollars
I'm so proud of Lindsey, I really, I really love her
Pure elegant talent. BEAUTIFULL💚
Absolutely love the fact that you have a flying v violin thats super sweet amazing video jus beautiful
WOW!!
👍👑🎻😍❤☺👏
bravo spectaculaire ! incroyable !!! merci !!!
Wow, just WOW!!!
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w_wDLc5R6bs&feature=you
Increíble...
the first time I listened to this music it gave me chills and an emotion >.< 2012.....Now I listen to it again and it keeps giving me chills 2021 omg!!! you are a very strong woman!!!!! D: jajajaja use traductor para poder escribir lo que queria decir XD!! :c
You're incredible Lindsey but please don't hurt yourself like this anymore. We love you so so much! Stay safe all the time
You're AMAZING <3 Always loved your music and I'm absolutely amazed <3
Me fascina esta mujer. Es puro arte.
Vous êtes magnifiques c'est magique je vous adore

Bellissimo sono senza parole!!!!
the things she does for us. hopefully it didn't hurt too much :( This really inspired me to become a better player.

Love this in the ice caves. It's how I found you. Thank you
So cool You're awesome ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ love it♡♡♡♡♡
#lindseystirling Goddess of Talent
I really admire you and your work, music and everything you are doing. I hope that you can reach the hearts of every one that is ready for your message.
You did it great. Great. Great. But please don´t do it any more.  You don´t need to loose your hair just to please others. I live in Mar del Plata, Argentina. I took my grand-daughter to see you at the theatre in Buenos Aires. A long travel, only to be there in your show. You were fantastic then, without  such a sacrifice.  You are a great performer, a great musician, a great dancer, a beautiful girl. You don´t need to prove it. You are. We love you, and we don´t want to see you hurting yourself.
Wao! You're incredible Lindsey! I'm Mexican and you Fan... I don't speak english so much but want say YOU ARE AN ARTIST EXCELLENT! CONGRULATIONS!!!... KISSES... I LOVE YOU!...
You are  a brilliantly talented artist Lindsey .. Thanks you for subjecting yourself to this wonderful piece of Artistry 🌹
Ma si vedono tt i capelli rovinati sopra
Здорово
Something to learn in three months. Madness! Lindsey you are wonderful.
Finally decided to watch. Had to leave at 1:11 min. because a bald man doesn't like to see hair taken for granted
She’s a beautiful woman, with a passion for her art. Her devotion to this piece of art blows me away!
Next playing the violin while skydiving from the stratosphere as she glides like an angel..
That looked like that hurt sooo much. plz don't do again, dont like watching you hurt ☹️
Fantastic imagination! Thanks a lot!
Crazy 🔥🔥🔥🥰
Cette fille est vraiment géniale
❤️
Wonderful ... as always 👍
U proved .. nothing is immpsible if we really want to do.. 🤟💓💓 . I know it's really painful but u did it to prove ur to urself.🤟😘
You are amazing!!! Eres increíble!!!
I'm confused, I don't know whether I should like or unlike this video. Like, because it was extremely incredible and beautiful but unlike, because it hurt me a little to watch this. My Odin, the ambition is eating you alive, if you do such things! I soo admire you and you are soo amazing but now I'm afraid that you will come up with other more painful ideas. And I'm really torn because from one side I'm under huge impression right now but from the other side I don't want you to hurt yourself. I will give you a like for this video because I want to emphasize that I appreciate your ambition, strentgh, grace and creativity but please don't think that I want to encourage you do to such painful things. Love you <3
Amazing performance🔥🔥🔥🔥
World championship
Ese cabellazo! Tirando pelazo! Shampoo de dioses y melodía de un ángel... Lindsey... te amo
I literally feel pain when I see that. The biggest dangers of hair hanging is tearing out the hair from the scalp.
HATER: I'm going to rip your hair out!!  LINDSEY: Here!!  Hold my Violin!!
I watched this amazing woman train for this and I must say...she is a fighter. She proves that anyone who puts thier mind or "hair" to the test... anything/dreams can come true!
1:01 SHES SWINGING BY HER HAIR!!!! OH MY GOSH! Lindsey your the most talented person now! keep up the hard work you can do this!!
Epic!
You were very brace going through all that training and hard work, which the video is amazing and beautiful in its simplicity.
Incredible.  Easily the highlight of your career thus far.
Lindsey I have watched everything you have done that I could find over the years. One wondrous performance after another. But this! I have never seen such determination, courage, and endurance on any performer in my life, and I am old enough to have seen the greats! Young lady I wish you were my daughter because that is the only way I could be more proud of you or love you more. You have helped me through some rough times whether you know it or not and I see many more years of watching you perform. You have touched my heart dear, and will always have a place therein.
Can I just say well done. Like HOW DO YOU PLAY THE VIOLIN WITHOUT MISTAKES WHILE SWINGING IN THE AIR BY YOUR HAIR?! Amazing video but, please don't hurt yourself!!
EEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
So good 🧚
I watched this art piece after watching your hair hanging vlog. In doing so I found it gives so much more insight into every move and expression you make. This is so Inspirational! Thank you so much for going through all that you do.
amazing from feet to hairtop
Absolutely amazing, congratulations on your leveling up and all the work you put into being able to do that! You are inspiring. Thank you.
Totalement fan !  C'est juste magique ! Merci !!!
Wow, I am very impressed and the flying v violin is so cool. How did you  hold the loop thing on your head.
How does that not hurt.. either way it was a blast to watch nice work beautiful 😍
it is excellent and incredibly beautiful
Amazing! It’s very cool!
Incredible work - wish you had the Harbinger song on YouTube!
🙏🏻extraordinary is possible 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I can't see this video, it must have hurt you, especially your hair 😨
That's great! Greetings from Russia.
Good 🇦🇷
This was beautiful and breath taking. Your commitment to learning and how much you believe in yourself is extremely inspiring. Your message about positive affirmations touched me deeply. We spend so much time putting ourselves down to see someone who openly tells themselves positive things is such a strong message. Your resilience and strength speak volumes through this video and it's beautiful. Thank you for being such a positive person in this world and reminding people that they to should believe in themselves and work towards bettering themselves.
I absolutely love Lindsey Stirling music 💞 incl her live concerts and multitalented performances like this one.
WOW!!! BRAVO!!!
I am so glad she didn't give up years ago nor during this. I simply have no words. ❤
so now cool
hung by just her hair..  and she did that..     .. I .. I can't even.   I'm speechless.
Oh how amazing what a lovely performance! Good job! I can’t wait to play the stings & fly!
Beyond the religious. Lindsey proved that she has a soul ten times more evolved than anyone else.
Супер!!! Я восхищён 👍🙋‍♂️🕺🕺🕺 это великолепно
The act is beautiful, and I hope you find beauty and meaning in its expression, because I don't want you to hurt yourself only to entertain.
Unreal😳
Valoramos ese trabajo duro , el esfuerzo el empeño el sentimiento que lo pones es increible I LOVE YOu ❤
Unique 👻
"You're not good enough" Eat this America got talent.
😳😱😲😯😮🤯
I was amazed when i watch this first, then your i watched your training video.. I was literally shocked when i re-watched this! Its like hanging yourself but its from hair..Excellent work !
WOW! I have no words for your talent!
AMAZING!!! Go, Lindsey!!!!!
Wow you are amazing 😯👏☺️☺️♥️
Wow and ow! Whatever hair products you use, I need it in my life!

@Lindsey Stirling is your hair okay?
My favourite melodie 😭😪😭 described my pasado
I love your music you turned no my inspiration you pushed me to learn English and play the violín, it hurts that  you Will never bless  México :(
This can't be good for hair. I mean, we can see a lot of beoken strands. I'm pretty sure you have noticed your hair's thiner.
I love this version of the piece! It’s so beautiful! Please make it available in other places from just this video!
I saw how you began this journey and why and how personal it is for you. In such a short time this video came out flawlessly i can see the pain and smile behind you're eyes at the end when you look in the camera . But Lindsey darling everything you do is amazing
This is wow
Impresionante 👏👏👏👏
Crazy 😮😍 unbelievable good and aesthetic❤️
Sin palabras ....talento es poco decir es angelada!! Es elegida, es la mejor es lo más bello para la vista y los oidos
The perfect woman.
My greatest respect for this masterpiece!!!! I really enjoy listening to your music and I am really excited about what you have created.  Greetings from Germany
Вау! Это божественно
Ok this was INCREDIBLE. Was it live? Because the thought of it being done all together stresses me out lol
Божечки , на волосах
I’m just... crying. Perfect performance
Lindsey, we love you already! Just make us more music. Nothing more.
Это ооочень странное представление/выступление, похожее на цирковое, когда гимнасты творят чудеса под куполом. Во всяком случае смотреть было интересно :)
You never cease to amaze me! Looking forward to Jan 15
Amazing performance , she’s so talented! ❤️
Exquisite. You are such a blessing, angel. So much Love sent to you for sharing your gifts with us! May our Heavenly Father's Grace continue to pour through your life into the hearts of All Mankind.
Sei veramente fantastica ! Mi hai veramente emozionata !! Fare quello che hai fatto, cioè unire tre discipline artistiche ed emozionare così , fa di te una super grande!!! Bella e bravissima!!! Un abbraccio virtuale da una coetanea Romana !!!
This woman is amazing
That was amazing, great job! We can conquer more than we think!
You are amazing and beautiful, and I (and I'm sure everyone else) is so proud of you! Your father and best friend in heaven as well <3 well done!
And she left round 2 of Americas got talent 🙄 those judges were crackheads
That was so stunning, I found myself tearing up in total awe.  It took my breath away!
Your talent and art brought tears to my eyes
For those who cut this woman down all that time ago saying she couldn't dance and play: EAT. YOUR. HEART. OUT.
Ты прекрасный человек, какая же ты сильная, твоё выступление было восхитительным
Aua aua aua
*spends this entire video scared she’s gonna snap her neck even though i KNOW she won’t*
WOW  YOU ARE STRONG YOUR MUSIC IS BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE MY IDOL
Just watching this makes my neck hurt. When I was 11 a guy picked me up by my head. It was only for a few seconds but I thought my neck was going to break.
Gosh... You're so inspiring!
Amazing
You made it! And it was amazing!!! Exactly what I was expecting from an artist like you 😍 congrats!!
I'm half-expecting Pinhead from Hellraiser to walk out at any moment.
This is amazing! 🙂 Very inspiring.
AMAZING!!!!
Bello, impresionante, gracias por darnos lo mejor de ti, saludos desde Perú
I remember when u were on agt and when u got voted off u didn't let it get u down and next thing I knew u were going on tour u are an inspiration to a lot of people including me
you are wonderful! from Russia with love=)
J'adore, je suis fan
EU ESTOU COMPLETAMENTE ARREPIADO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hair hanging must have been painful
WOW!! I saw the vlog too and just WOW!!! I am blown away!! you are amazing!! you took your already amazing talent and went "lets crank it up!" <3
Eres tan original y  guerrera. Me encantó , totalmente asombroso!!!!!!!!!!
You're so light like an angel and you fly so too it's to awesome
The song was awesome 😭😭😭 But this stunt of yours is not well appreciated by most because it may cause serious problems including death
Umm, how is this even possible?
She and P!nk need to perform on stage together. It would be fun and beautiful  to see them swinging
Astounding and creative grnius
Huauu!!! This is Amazing!
un peu tiré par les cheveux mais superbe!
The best 👑
Wow This is so amazing and spectacular. You did such a great job. But this looks very difficult and painful, too.
I was incredibly blown away by this. It has honestly been a long time since I have personally looked her up to be BLOWN AWAY. She can literally do anything and she is an incredibly strong, determined, and beautiful artist in so many ways.
I wish we can like videos when we do rewatch 🥺🥺 it is incredible performance ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
all i can think of is , why???
у меня от этого видео аж шея заболела :(
Alucinante arte! Me encanta!!
Piers Morgan was SO wrong about you. I was so upset when you got voted off and then so excited when I found ur music years later. I'm so proud of you, Lindsey. You've come so far and done so many amazing things. You've kept me from trying to commit sui*ide and have helped me even now to this day. Never stop. This world needs you.
Wow
Her movements and playing the violin is amazing to see doing it at the same time.  People don't realize how difficult that is do.  Bad enough just trying to play staying still.
Unreal. Enjoyed while thinking of possible pain.
Increíble Lindsey 👏🎥 que esfuerzo y talento
... that is a truly novel way to suffer for your art. respect. and i'm really liking your more mature look.
Everyone is talking  about no nets being used, and the pain she felt but I'm really trying to figure out how she played her violin spinning around that fast in the air without the bow flinging away and messing up.
This is totally insane, I love it! You are gorgeous ♥️
girl...are you ok?
Unbelievable, all your effort was worth it. You're amazing
This is a new level! I follow her since her very first video posted on youtube and I must say that I'm truly amazed by that performance. The emotion is... almost suffocating! The power she's demonstrating! I mean... She obviously worked a lot to make her body stronger for this. The pull on her hair and neck must be incredible and yet, she's still flying! The only other show I saw from someone pulled by the hair is on the cirque du soleil...  Between the first version of Crystallize and this one... there's a lot of hard work.
It's just magical! I can’t believe that this is possible, and acrobatic stunts and play.
This is amazing!!!!! I can't stop watching it!!! Lindsey you just keep amazing me, love u lindsey!!!!!!
This is beautiful. Maybe not pull your scalp off tho 🥺
Огромный,титанический труд и потрясающий результат!Спасибо за ваше творчество
it was beautiful, no more to say
Juste incroyable ... Bravo..
Watching video made me cringe; but you kept breathing through the pain like a champ.
Wow
❣️
Perfect 😍😍☺️
Great work Lindsey ❤️❤️❤️. Great work and great performance 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👍🏼👍🏼👏👏👏
💖💖 Insanely Beautiful!!!💖💖
Tal cantidad de dedicación Pará soportar tanto dolor eres increíblemente dedicada  eres una gran persona y gran artista
Amazing!!!!!!!!
Hermosa
beautiful ... congratulations Lindsey 💓💓💓
So beautiful but i literally teared up
Love you songs and you
WOWWWWW DIOSSSS QUE HERMOSO👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 MI ARTISTA FAVORITA
Very impressive, Lindsey, you're amazing
Lindsay I love You❤️ you are the Best ever music artist
Lindsey this was absolutely stunning but I almost cried seeing this cause you had to be in so much pain. Please don't ever do this again.
This could've been done with a safety harness, and no-one would bat an eye.  Let's not do that again.
Ow.
Посоветуйте мне ваш шампунь.Чтоб волосы были такими же крепкими!
Omgoodness young lady you are brilliant it's sooooo sooothing with a magical feel to it whoever composed/ wrote thid piece is and emotional person with enigmatic sight. Thank you these 2 performances i utterly enjoyed them. Would you believe i heard this om Instagram featuring a dog and chimp as friends
Increíble! 😯
🦸🦸
Você é incrível!!! 😯😍😍😍😍 Minha inspiração!!! 💜🤗 #bolhasluz 🙏
Fantastic Job....
Imagination is the key to creativity and Lindsey has the key to both.  A spirit that soars to new realms of the UT most high moving faster and faster then the speed of light.  Her brain is trying to keep up with her spirit.  It is amazing to watch.   I hope she doesn't burst into flames.  Just kidding.  She is beautiful though in and out that I can see.
COMPLIMENTI SEI UN ARTISTA COMPLETA :) BRAVISSIMA
اححي
Refreshing and exciting, the music says so much. What are the arrangements, if any, to use your music on personal videos?
Maravillosa , espectacular!!!! MÉXICO TE AMA  ❤
What an amazing human to go through so much pain and produce a masterpiece while doing it is awe inspiring
I was brought to tears! Another of your magical & spiritual performances <3 thank you for being you Lyndsey <3 In such a over saturated & overly superficial environment, you’re a complete breath of fresh air :)
Beautiful
that was incredible! the dedication and effort you put into this video was outstanding. the level of focus someday would have to have while spinning super fast in the air only by their hair while their playing the violin is out of this world. I'm so glad you made this. It's very inspiring and teaches a lot of us that anything is possible with hard work and dedication.
Yes, now you can play the violin and fly at the same time. You made me cry with this video Lindsey. I hope you are having a good time with your family.
You did it! Way to go! Beautiful!
I watched this this first then the vlog on her training and I am SOO PROUD OF YOU. You did it and conquered it. Way to go. ❤️❤️❤️🥲🥲
¡Auch! Me dolió la cabeza....  Que majestuosidad de vídeo.
I never expected to want to try hair-hanging. Thank you for that.
ho my dog it so amazing just wow i love your determination and your force
Amazing, beautiful, perfection I could carry on, your a true inspiration to so many, I love your music and I can’t wait to hopefully see you in Brisbane in May 2021 ❤️❤️❤️❤️
from the best what people love  you do  ,,,, you do this  . i love your job , but that way its no good way ,
Geezus that looks painful I bet you had a headache afterwards I know I would
Шальная в лучшем смысле этого слова, полное погружение в музыку и эмоции
Beautiful! But would be better without tons of makeup
Beautiful performance. Well done on you for accepting the challenge. Wow I discovered you work and I fall in love with your perfomances.  ;-)
Very beautiful, but please don't put yourself through pain for artistic purposes. We love seeing you smile and dance. Your smile is art in itself!
I didn't blink for a  4 seconds.
lindey striling is best
I've already done my makeup, which seems as a bad idea now, cuz' it's melting down by my tears, I see so much power in you, keep on going, you are inspiration for so many souls, .. thank you for not giving up, if you gave up after America's got talent, we would never have so amazing artist, sending love from Czech republic
magnificent, spectacular, out of this world,, There are no words to describe.... Respect!  Thank you!  Bless you!
amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Unbeliveable. Like... I am so, so impressed.
Another Outstanding Performance! <3
Play date please
Is my honor to watching this.
🥵🥵🥵
I love how you sync the speed of the rotation with the speed of the music ... such an amazing work of art.
Petrarch quote: Man has no greater enemy than himself. You defeated it! There are no words, just amazing. Thank you Lindsey.
fantastique !!! bravo !
this is beautiful thank you @Lindsey Stirling takes me back to the first time i heard this song over 9yrs ago and done a remix of it adding old skool vocals from my Rave days search my channel for Lindsey Stirling - Crystallize (Remix) i added a link but i think the comment was blocked so i have removed the link
You are absolutely amazing. I just love watching you perform. You're magnifying your talents.
Way to go, Lindsey! That was incredible.
it's so unusual
Amazing but my head hurts just from seeing that!! lol You must have a strong head of hair 😮😳❤️
It looks beautiful most of the time. But when she gets up from the floor I just keep imagining how painful is that 😓
❤️❤️❤️wonderful ❤️❤️❤️
Lindsey: Why do I have a huge head ace  After: four minutes dangling with only her bun to hold her
I wish you can play those miracle in Taiwan one day,loving you👍🕊✝️🥰🌷
One of the greatest things about Lindsey Stirling is her ability to take criticisms as challenges.
Impecável!!
А аааааа аааа что это зачем себя за волосы!?! я не понимаю может кто объяснить?
Moved to literal tears, so proud. Good job Lindsey!
7th chakra is open lets open another five ⚜️✨💞♥️💞✨⚜️

I get chills EVERY time at the point where you take off the ground! I watched this at your first viewing of the show and I kept thinking "Why is she doing this to herself if it hurts and is not necessary?" Well, that moment says it all. It created an impactful moment that left me awestruck. So impressed by your endurance through this. Thank you Lindsey, for what you do for your fans.
Eres Arte Lindsey Te amooooooooo
how did you even go that?! amazing!!!
Это вера, это душа. Зто я,,,,,,,, Россия это Я
Очень мило. Ну как ей не больно?  А так великолепно!!!!!!!!
Please don't do that again. If the rope catches on something and then is released, it could break your neck.
New level 😳
You are an Amazing performer,  I hope I get to see you live some day!
That was... AMAZING🌟 Thank you for making this wonderful video. I saw your vlog about practicing and I can say it was worth it. It was completely worth it. Thank you again💖
Awesome, low hat!
I can't stand dance music or dub step. But, two days ago I stumbled upon this video. Since then I have watched the majority of Lindsey's videos, bought Artemis and a bunch of her other work, I've sobbed (Lunar Lullaby), and I checked her tour dates. I am planning on going to see her this summer if I can afford it.   The Arena, Underground, Til the Light Goes Out, Darkside, and Guardian. Those are my personal favorites so far. After a friend's suicide and the Camp fire, I slipped into a deep, dark hole that I have only very recently started clawing my way out of.   Now, after avoiding Lindsey's music for years because of its genre, I am now finding myself relating to it almost more than any other music I've ever heard. Her music has an all too familiar fight in it that I really needed to hear right now. It makes me want to fight too, the way I used to- even more than I used to.   Thank you Lindsey. Thank you.
is that your idol? why mine if
Esta mulher é do caralho PQP ♥
I love you
i love you saludos desde mexco
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Imagine the migraine she must’ve had 😖
💗💓💗💓
Alguien que hable español :v? 🙂
I wonder if the hurt her head after
I got chills. I could see the pain in your face but with a sheer determination to get through it. Artistically it was beautiful. I loved it!  ❤🎻😦😯👏👏👏
Cabeleleila leila
my hair It pains me to see it, but the performance is stunning.
Niesamowite 👍👍👏👏
were tf does one live if THAT room fits in your home....
Waiting on parachute Lindsey playing violin lol.
Is she supposed to be an ornament?
The best))) thank you👍
What an amazing, beautiful performance! You are so brave and talented ❤
you are perfect ✨💫
Coitado do cabelo
What a bloody idiot. Everyone here is feeling sorry for her? Like are you kidding me? How about speaking some sense and letting her know this garbage is not okay. It doesn't look beautiful it is sadistic and I'm disgusted in her for supporting this. She's supporting the suffering and exploitation of women by showcasing this. Ugh. Get your head together Linsey, is this what you want your lasting image to be?
Woman!!! You set the bar so high!!!
I prefer your original Crystallize video to this.
wow...just wow. Amazing performance. Looking forward to hopefully seeing you in Toronto.
El comentario en español que tanto esperabas .... por cierto Lindsey es pura inspiración ✨
ow
Love this great job you improved soooo much
This is absolutely stunning 🤩 just... didnt it hurt? I mean... my head hurts just from watching...🥺
Did this mad lad swing by her hair?!   Or... mad lady
Tssss! 🥺😧🤕ay comadre ahora si te salió de pelos  este video, acabe con dolor de cuello y cabeza, mejor haz otra melodía tocando el violín desde un paracaídas o algo dedicado a las personas que no tiene brazos y usan sus piernas para hacer todo , eso me impresiona más que jalarte el cabello para dar  vueltas y volar
everyone: O my gosh! her violin skills are amazing!! me: yeah i agree BUT HOW DID HER HAIR NOT GET RIPPED OUT?!
I am proud of you!
♥ i dont have words.♥
Don't ever do that again Lindsey,please, we already appreciate your work enough 🤍
Holy cow Lindsay, I want to give you a hug after this! That was amazing and you're incredible!😍 What an amazing artist you are, keep going!
I love you so much dont break your neck, we still need you for another generation to come.
Lindsey is incredible
Я конечно не фанат такой музыки, но таки помню еще в школе, лет так 10 назад, какой-то преподаватель любил искать мелкие таланты...и тогда он упоминал об этой девушке, изредка смотрел этот канал с несколько тысяч, а тут уже миллионы, вау...ахахах, красавица что уж там.
😍
линси поглозам  видно как больно ??????? зачем
Uwuw lagu nya aku suka mendengar lagunya kak lindsey
How you did not get sick from spinning so much is unknown to me...very well done!
This just reinvented the hair pulling fetish :O
This is the final result... But does anybody think about the amount of training to control any movement? Plus playing at the same time?  We have to admire the passion and work on this video THANK YOU for this piece of art
SO BEAUTIFUL! 🥺😍  This is the first time that I do this.... But does anyone is interested in taking a look at my channel? 😇
Such a beautiful performance! It is amazing how you continue to push yourself to find new ways to exemplify your art. Thank you for doing something so incredible for us. We love you!
What can I say :👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Insane!
Guau!! Perfec :D
you are just amazing girl
The shampoo commercials are getting out of hand!
Wonder.if she had a major headache afterwards
I mean wow just wow amazing...im literally trying to look for words to describe it but can't find any... WOW
Grandissima performance , ha finito visibilmente provata.
anyone have this floor music?
You did it!!! And it beautiful!! I k ow you worked so hard for this Lindsey!!
You restored my faith in  humanity ...God bless you😀😀
Beautifull.....simply Amazing.......thank you
Play date full version pls 😘
Wow! So amazing!!! <333
This is why I started playing violin, this was awesome and I hope one day I can be on a stage too, please don't do this to yourself again though it looks really painful but we appreciate the lengths you go 😊
I really like your music, the rhythm and melody together with the effects and movements are very nice.
WoW! Like a ANGEL!
Браво!!! Спасибо вам большое, за красивую музыку и оригинальное исполнение! ☕+👍
So amazing..  you are so crazy.... 😱😱😍😍🎉
Very impressive! Very Lindsey Stirling! <3
Watched your hair vlog, so terrifying. But you did it! You are BRAVE and INSPIRING. We are SO PROUD OF YOU!!!🎻🧡
Powerful music and visual
Hey sweetie  you don't have to do things like this stay in your roots because that got you where you are, don't get me wrong heck I would take you any day of the week 24/7 Must love AB
Awesome
You can do this!!! Beautiful, unique and wonderful
"You're not untalented, but you're not good enough, I don't think, to get away with flying through the air and playing the violin at the same time."  (Piers- America's Got Talent)  Does everyone hear that? I hear a dump truck full of apples pulling up to Piers' house.
So what do you do for a living, Ms Stirlng? I am a violinist, dancer and trapeze artist, in one act. She is a new planet.
Amazingly beautiful form, it is transcendent !  Joshua 1:9
I want to say that was beautiful but, beautiful sounds like a major understatement. Thank you Miss Stirling.   That was awesome.
Anybody else want to see Lindsey Sterling and Unleash the Archers do a collabiration?
Я в ШОЦІ!!!!!!! Ти - неймовірна!!!
Если это правда, то шея у неё крепче, чем у питбуля😊
Shes wild. What a classic.
why....
ORIGINAL Y UNICA, GRANDE  LINDSEY. UN ABRAZO Y BENDICIONES
Oh my goodness!!!  I watched your video in preparation for this!!! Where is the love applaud MILLIONS button! Bravo you are so amazing 🤩 🤩 🤩
Я плачу от восторга. Вы прекрасны!!!!
Good job im really proud of you it looks really hard and i want to try it out  someday. I  didn't know that was a thing.
never do that again, Lindsey. The MV is incredibly, the song is indescribable but the pain I feel when I think of how much it had hurt is terrible.
Simplismente perfeiçao .....
Wow this is just one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. So much beauty and grace. Well done Lindsey!!
Amazing artist
You did it! ✨Beautiful✨
you   are    so    unbelievable!
Hey! I'm back again tonight too... Lindsey, I LOVE THIS! I love THIS Lindsey too! u just rock!
That was breathtaking! Lindsey, you are so amazing! The amount of hard work and suffering for your craft just makes the end result that much more phenomenal!  You are awe inspiring!
TOTALMENTE DE ACUERDO EN QUE ESTA ÉPICO!!
Supreme being... that’s how it looks like ...
The most magnificent tune you ever played. Though I don't like this video despite the torment you went through it,  I like you because of your music not the performances.  Yet, highest regards for this performance!
Kids don't try this at hime
To think she even had to practice this. Dear god, and I'm still crying about my hair getting caught by the air.
FICOU MARAVILHOSO , FANTASTICO, meus parabéns.
¿Cómo es posible que ella pueda colgarse de su propio cabello y bailar tan bien mientas toca?. Yo no podría hacer ni lo primero.
Absolutely amazing!! BUT please don’t put yourself through that again, we don’t like seeing you go through that much pain!! 💜💜💜
Absolutely stunning. Congratulations on accomplishing the goal you set out for yourself.
a great challenge to your body, to pain, to fear... especially divine music. you deserve the most sincere respect!!!!!
This is absolutely incredible!!! I can not believe she did this without any harnesses. Her sacrifice for beauty and artistry is an inspiration and a model for us all!
lindsey inspires me to play violin but ill never be good at it
Amazingggg !!!!!!
Tem mais lugar pra apertar like? Incrível. Happy 2021
Again. Breaking Artistic Boundaries. I am moved to tears watching this.
After all your pain you went through. I have to admit that this is beautiful. Your emotions are very visible there. <3
Je suis tellement séduite par cette performance, comme tant d'autres bien évidemment... Très très émue devant tant de persévérance, surtout après avoir regardé la précédente vidéo. Je suis juste bluffée ! Merci Lindsey, merci infiniment ! ❤️  Merci pour toutes ces émotions transmisent dans chacune de tes vidéos, continues de nous faire rêver !  " You did it" 💪🏻
I will echo what others have said. An awesome performance, but please, never again!
Absolutely spectacular!!! This is a piece of art and it is priceless. I'm lost for words, just an amazing performance 👏👏👏 In total awe...
Lindsey ay dont do that please no more making us scared
Can you do a song with Alan Walker please, i'd really like to see both of my fav's on the same stage :)
Wow 💪😱😃😎💪👏
Thank you Lindsey. Once again, straight to the heart!
Nothing but WOOOOOOOOW
That was incredible. The lengths she goes through for her art is astonishing. Well done.
3:00 is big mood tbh.
好屌喔!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Crazy!!!!!!!
Lindsey, I already had mad respect and love for you BUT THIS WAS INTENSE! I'm sorry if it hurt but I'm so glad you were willing to do it! INSANE AS HECK and amazing, I listen to a lot of metal bands (even your friend Amy and Lzzy!) and ik that's not quiet your genre in music but it is in your lifestyle! LOVED seeing the power and focus on your face! YOU ROCK!
Just out of curiosity, what made you want to do hair hanging in the first place?
Her perseverance paid off
After seeing the journey you had to go through to create this masterpiece I cried. You are so strong and valiant to go through the pain. This is so much more than just a performance... this is SOUL!
I'm torn about watching this. On one hand I saw the training video and how painful this was to learn to do, and I'm thinking about that during this video. On the other hand the least I could do is give up 4 minutes of my time to watch it and bump that view counter.
This is INCREDIBLE! Lindsey you are AMAZING!
Is this the original audio? Is she really playing that “flawlessly”? Or is this “dubbed”?
Wow such an beautiful  performance.  U are an amazing performer. I can stop watching this performance its just amazing. I have always wanted to learn how to play the violin as a child but never did. Now u inspire me to take lessons.
Ouch
Amazing Lindsey , I Love your performance...Congratulations..
Fiquei com dor de cabeça só de olhar..
♡♡♡♡ hiç mi canın acımadı
awesome artist I cant believe I found you recently while killing time listening to music on here
This video legit made me cry. This was clearly a personal goal, the dedication is beyond words. Lindsay, your performance in this video was flawless, be very proud of yourself! Lol but do something less torturing next time!
Нереальная.....ты фея! Такая талантливая душа 💜 спасибо за чудо.
Will the whole show be available in any other format after today?
One word, "Phenomenal" 💛
Nothing else to say... but WOW
niesamowita :) chciałabym znów móc uczestniczyć w Twoim koncercie w Polsce <3
У меня один вопрос,ЗАЧЕМ,а главное НАХЕРА?
scalp sued Lindsey...
Amazing 🤩  Having watched the behind the scenes video and what it took for you to do this made it that much more beautiful...thank you for that...my son and I love your work and your music has helped us get through some rough times. 💕
и смысл что она со скрипкой, все равно под минусовку играет
INCREDIBLE 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This is an abslutely incredible performance! Makes Cirque du Soleil look tame!   But can anybody convince me that it was not dangerous? I don't think so.  The thing is, some of us empathise very strongly, which makes this sort of thing terrifying to watch.  Yeah, sure, I could 'switch it off', but that would mean saying 'I don't care if she dies; I don't care if she becomes a quadraplegic'. Sure I could say that, but that would mean denying something real within me. Two others I know who viewed this could not watch it through.
Relentless!
I just fell in Love. Cant blame you, it just  happens.
You are awesome!!!
Das ist richtig toll gemacht gemacht einfach spitze ❤️
Hardcore!
Аболдела чтоль а что сразу не за шею
Sorry for my english  but i'm french, but for stop this it's magnifical but if you have to suffer stop it, but the best is your music because just music is very very good and god 😉😉😉😉
I just love how much this woman challenges herself! Love you Lindsey and for going through  such an intense performance!!
To play the violin as beautifully as you do is hard enough..... adding the dancing and now this is totally amazing!!!........ You are a wonderful artist... thank you
You're a hecking queen, and let no one say differently. <3
amazing performance, please never do that again. :(
That's borderline masochistic. We're already know you're strong and tough af. No need to show it like that.
Who can enjoy it while she's in so much pain?
super awesome! <3
Amazing Lindsey, and yes we are all stronger than we can imagine. You are proof of this. Happy New Year
You are an Angel ! Thank you very much for your video. It is superhuman what you have portrayed. I bow to you. See you again in Germany Ulm Wiblingen? I hug you Lindsey many Kisses !!!
Now I see the purpose.  It is beautiful.
Wooooooow ♥️♥️♥️
Eres increiblemente maravillosa!!! De donde sacas tanto ingenio?  Dios🙏 bendiga tu don!!
That out does anything Pink has ever done by far. I’ve loved you from day one and always always will. it brought tears to my eyes when I watched your video of the training. And I am  i’m grown macho man but yet I would never have done what you just did. even after being in the Marines through Vietnam era
Amo a Lindsey.  Perfeita demais.
I don't understand why use hair like a Christmas star. But still like it looks very uncomfortable.
Happy new year, everybody. ❤❤❤
Beautiful
Amazing artistry... I held my breath the whole time for multiple reasons :) brava!!
super  bravo
This was cool but why did you do that to yourself.
Children do not try this Hair extending trick at home . But you can try to play the violin 🎻 LINDSEY
dont do this, bad idea.
Really good video, she did a great job. Hopefully that’s enough pain for a lifetime.
Absolument magnifique
If you weren't so beautiful I could not watch that.
so dangerous but beautiful.....
Who came from the tiktok?
I watched this after I watched the video and I'm so glad that you were able to work through the pain and make such an absolutely amazing video!!! Thank you for sharing this video! So many of us are going through hard times right now, including myself, and this is a perfect reminder that things can be extremely difficult but turn out more amazing than we ever thought possible. Thank you girl!!! God bless!!!
PAIN GIRL ...........
Why is this a thing? And who watching a hair hanger would ever say to themselves, "That looks like  a neat Friday night. Where do I sign up?"
That/that was beyond amazing young lady. Even as amazing it is, what you endured to perform this we as your fans who love you ask Please don't do that again.
*You are a true artist.*
Respekt
Love you Lindsey! You are so strong. I mean you didn't just hang you flew like the angel you are. 😊 ❤️
Is she a girl or robot 🤐👌😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Exquise❤😍😻🙏
gurlll your edges!!
i didnt know i could love this women even more but here we are
Eu gostei é uma bela combinação de duas coisas diferentes
Incredible control.  Awesome performance. I’m amazed how you kept the sound so smooth during the spins and flight.  I still love Ice Castle version, but was impressive as all get out.  Thank you for sharing this with us.
I love your music and you inspire me and I play violin too but I'm only like seven weeks
Especially because I saw your previous video about the pain and fear that you had because of this, I absolutely congratulate on mastering this! You fought against yourself and succeeded. And what you achieved is just gorgeous!
FOR EVER ONE: Watch her other video first! https://youtu.be/Aky-J-b9LcU Watching this video after that made this soo intense to watch. I balled my face off. I am so proud of you Lindsey!
Великолепная и невероятная Линдси! Красотка 😍❤
Könnte bei "Das Supertalent" auftreten
Касс ты супер!! ванеса мей  нервно курит!!
Beautiful performance! Now I am begging you, take your hair down for 3 months and never do this again. PLEASE!!!!!!!!! If most girls can nearly handle wearing a high pony for a few hours imagine the pain of literally being picked up buy your hair. This ranks in the worlds greatest pains. Has too. Amazing job.👏👏👏
I dont understand... Why the hair??
I watched your previous video, and I almost cried with you, and then watched this one and my jaw hit the floor. This is so insane and stunning I watched it twice. This is amazing
Wow! Wow! Wow! Amazing!!! What a great artist... awesome performance!!! Thks... from PORTUGAL.
You did it!!! Congratulations!!! You go girl on not giving up!!!! Loves you!!! 🥰😍💕
¡¡Te admiro muchísimo Lindsey y me encanta verte tocar, danzar y escucharte!!¡¡Eres una motivación para mi todos los días!!
Proof how absolutely remarkable Lindsey Sterling is. This is the most amazing thing I have ever seen.
Wooow 😍😍😍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Congratulations on such an amazing performance! I know this was hard and took alot of effort and practice and all your fans are proud of you!
please make a playdate :(
Performance impressionnante, j'en ai eu des frissons même si j'ai eu très mal aux cheveux en la regardant !
Very beautiful ❤️
No hablo ingles pero yo igual no se que decidir a mi me gusta el violin y la danza soy tu fan porque al fin me doy cuenta que no soy la única persona que le gusta el violin y la danza ♥️y yo te quiero dar mucho apoyo
Increíble, después de ver el vídeo anterior, todo el sufrimiento y las lágrimas y la frustración esto es aún más admirable, me impactó mucho la cara de concentración y saber lo mucho que está sufriendo por dentro y como agarra ese dolor y le enseña quien manda, ser fuerte es la habilidad de destruir las debilidades, y valentía no es la ausencia de miedo, es la habilidad de controlarlo
@Lindsey Stirling. Amazing. 1 step at a time.
Wow, her pain tolerance must be, beyond extremely high. Amazing!
Producer: "this seems unnecessary, may  I suggest a harness?" Linsey: "NO, Pull my hair"
Lindsey you can do all things through Christ who gives you strength
I felt very uncomfortable watching that. Very,very uncomfortable. Beautiful, but shocking.
Maybe the best video i have seen so far in my life....awesome! Great job!
Amazing!!! So... So... Beautiful  <3
This is  so awesome I was so scared While watching I'm really amazed
BRAVO!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I want to fly like she
First "crystallize" is best forever...
Just curious how long the "real" version of this took.... Awesome work and since I've seen the previous video about the "Behind the scenes" I'm even more impressed on what you've done here.
👼💕
Is this extensions? My scalp hurts watching this. I’m a huge fan of Crystallize but this is amazing ♥️😍
superbe performance, comme à son habitude.
Awesome
<3 you inspired me
Fantastic Lindsey 🤗♥🤗
I'm sorry.  I love you girlie but the pain you are putting on yourself is very unnecessary. I love new art but don't do this. Love yourself. This is so damaging.
I am actually crying.  Your strength and faith and determination to excel in your craft is phenomenal.  I watched the vlog first so I KNOW how hard this was for you and I could not be more PROUD of you.  You DID it!  You are truly amazing.  No one can ever say that you have peaked because you have shown that you are strong and determined enough to up that bar one more time.  Brava my Dear, BRAVA!  <3
Ouch! It must hurt.
це неймовірно і вражає!!! ви молодець :)
Even in that pain She looks like a white swan directly from heaven...
Your soooooo Gooddd..  👍👍👍👍👍 you deserve it..  Sending Love From the Phillipines 😍😍😍😍😍😍
She supper
https://youtu.be/ycWLQIq_Zbs
Unica, in tutto, adoro la tua musica😍😍😍
We Love you just the way you are ! Stop hanging from you hair please !😳🤭
Tu es magnifique
You are so Amazing, keep up all that you are. Thanks.
Absolute Breathless, Absolute stunning and adorable. I cry and it feals beautiful to listen your music. Thank you for this emotional feeling
amazing
Quelle belle preuve de courage, de ténacité et de grâce! Votre talent n'a pas de limite! Bravo, vous êtes une grande artiste.
Wow! 💔Home for the holidays - like a puppet on strings being tethered by rope, isolated inside our homes, taking great strength and in obvious pain! 👏👏👏👏
Félicitation très belle vidéo , beaucoup de d'acharnement et de souffrance pour au final une belle prouesse. Bravo Congratulations very nice video, a lot of determination and suffering for a great achievement in the end. well done
Well, that was weird. As unusual as it is, I hope Lindsey was satisfied with the outcome. Looks too uncomfortable for me to enjoy tho. Take care of yourself, Lindsey
question! what for?
That was: Amazing Shocking  Beautiful Spine-tingling Tragic Triumphant Scary  Inspirational Fun Powerful Worrisome  All rolled into one.
My applause to you Lindsey. Your roots run deep.
Demasiado espectacular. Admirable. Que fuerza tienes como artista y emocional para sacrificarte  por tu publico
Unbelievable!! Straight awesomeness!!! You are sooooooo talented!! Huge fan!
I have a hard time playing my violin just standing there. She's a legend!!  Greetings from Arizona www.carlos-solis.com
BRILLIANT
This defies logic! You are the strongest woman I know‼️
WOW! All I have is WOW
A.  was that fun  and B. how much hair fell out
Excruciatingly beautiful, but, as others have said, I would rather you didn't do this to yourself.   I'm scared to hit like because I don't want to encourage this -- yet, it was beautiful.
and you did this while playing the violin?!?!
Speechless
Какая молодец
Floored, Awestruck, and Intense. I will never know the pain that must cause. That is no doubt some serious muscular training. Please don’t do that again. I miss your laughter and smiles in your videos. There was none to see.
Impressive profermance love it
Very good!! Thanks for Your Art!!
If she went back to America's got talent she'd win it hands down
Why am ı crying 🥺😭That was fascinating and ı honored to be watch that
Бедные волосы, но выступление огонь)однозначно лайк)
Wannsien Show
Wow, what a courage. Pinned up hair are really looking good on you, but please be more careful of your beautiful hairs.^^ Finally I could see whole your magnificent body, Lindsey, you are perfect. You were always the most beautiful and sensual lady for me. And now I saw your whole beauty. 💘💖💘 I immediately would marry you, anytime anywhere.^^ 💝💝💝
She is literally the queen for making classical music great again 😌
Wow richtig geil gemacht, da hast dich mal wieder selber übertroffen und so bild hübsch dabei sagenhaft. Machh weiter so.
An awesome performance once again. The music 🎶 is stunning.
Линдси - невероятная личность. Сквозь объектов камеры, через экран она заряжает людей искренними, позитивными эмоциями. Каждый клип, каждая композиции, это что-то новаторское и необычное. По началу, мне её творчество вообще не импонировало, но через раз другой, когда, случайным или не совсем, способом натыкался на её ролики, оставался с противоречивыми чувствами. И по итогу пришёл к тому, что стал одним из её фанатов. Обожаю Линдси! Искренне желаю ей не потерять свой запал жизнерадости и позитива, которым она наполняет других людей. Всего вам хорошо в жизни. И с Наступающим Новым Годом!!!
The strength.!!! The will shown here!!! Is not of normal being!!! She is INSANE A SUPERHUMAN!!
Woow Amazing. You've always been amazing but now it's a championship.
It looked amazing,, I had tears watching this,, please dont do it again, so much pain ,  ,, much love to you ,, you are my favorite violinist ever!
My scalp is screaming 😱
Lindsey Stirling: the only female violinist who dares to fly and spin at a thousand revolutions per second while playing her instrument :) To me, it's cool that she constantly tries herself in different backgrounds, it's a synonym of challenge! I respect that from her particularly above other things. This version of her Crystallize is cool, indeed, although it seems a bit "simpler". And my standouts for this time are: the light spectacle coordinated with the music, and her outfit! Big props again to LS and her crew! Lots of blessings!
Lindsey, This is great but this one is painful. Don't go through so much pain just to make a cool music video. (Please don't hurt yourself, there is always another way). And by the way the other Crystallize music video with the ice was really awesome and you didn't have to do it again. And you could of just hung up not by the hair but by the arms, (Like on the chest below the arms so it won't hurt) But  still this was awesome, keep up the good work but this was a little painful to watch. (I LOVE Your Music!). I also say thee video when you were learning how to hang by your hair and I felt like crying too when you were sad and crying.  This is how many people feel like you did the most awesome, painful,  and hardworking thing .   ↓↓↓↓
That is INSANE!!!
You are like a fierce snowflake that ushers in a musical snowstorm!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🗯
Aaron Rodgers is calling :)
encore un exploit, impressionnant
Simply put... beautiful 😍    Amazing, astonishing, creative hard working, breath taken, fantastic, well done, inspiring👏
The amount of fear, and concentration, on your face is real. But you did such a good job
Oye show it's amazing and tour play is other world..great and wonderful
Dunno if you'll ever see this, but you became a life lesson for my 6 year old son.  Explained to him what happened and how important this video is.  Moral of the story was, "Don't ever let anyone, no matter how important they may think they are, tell you what you can't accomplish in life."  Thank you for your music.
Thats the most weirdest beautiful wonderful thing I've ever seen to see it live would be amazing!💓💫
Это красиво и прекрасно, но мне больно на это смотреть... Что даже кончиками волос ощущаю боль.
This is very impressive and quite the achievement but please Lindsey don't hurt yourself like this again ❤️
God bless you and be near you always on your journey.
Sacrificing your hair for the music... That’s inconceivable! Only an artist like you could think of it, Lindsey.
A lovely reimagining of your music and form.
Nostalgia ♥️
как всегда на высоте!
Wow 🤩 isn't she dizzy from spinning? Lindsey is AMAZING!! ❤
She is taking the pain!  Bravo Lindsey!
So beautiful! I can't stop rewatching this!
I wander what she really is attached to
❤💓🔥✨
Just found out we share the same birthday. September 21 1999 for me. I think that's pretty awesome. I know I'm just some random fan, and this comment doesn't affect you, I just thought I'd wish you a happy belated birthday Ms. Stirling.
Bravo! Very nicely done. Your perseverance is inspiring. Congratulations on a beautifully crafted video. I hope it touches the hearts of all who see it.
That was amazing!
YOU CRAZY!!!!)))))
This is ART!
Superbly Breathtaking!
😳”OUCH” ,   I  could have swore there was some kind of harness that was hidden in your Hair  &  ran down your back ,  but i could couldn’t see the slightest  sign of one any where😱   Geese  Louise  you’ve RAISED THE BAR a few inches THIS time Kiddo👍👍👍 ...  I  wanted to say “ HANG  IN  THERE  DEAR”,   😦“Uhhhh ,  But  U  already  did “😂❗️  🙄
С праздником Вас, дорогая Линдси.!!! С Днём виолончелиста!
❤❤❤
art is pain
*Breathtaking* 🎵 🎵 🎵 🎵
Lindsey! Wow! Absolutely breathtaking. You totally blew my mind. Amazing. Plus playing my favorite song. What more can I ask for? True delight!
❤⚘....
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!
That was incredible!
She never ceases to amaze me. Every time she has a new video I can't wait to see it because I know I will be amazed by her talent and showmanship.
well, that's too far AND to alone. Come on, be brave and make another (/many) Master of Tides public event, weither it's permitted or not. People are looking for warmth in their REAL life. And so do you Lindsey.
Bravo.. absolutely spectacular 👌
Phenomenal ❤
Every year... she does something to become my hero all over again ...we love you, and admire you, so much Lindsey!
para impresionar tenia que engancharse por el pelo? ufff debe doler
она молодец! красота! Belleza! но вот то, что передает.... Почему все синее? заморожена)
This is the best I saw this 2020
J'ai eu des frissons durant toute la performance! Tu m'as fait pleurer! Tu es incroyable! Mon idole. ❤❤
I have got Goose pumps when im listening your music, when i find peace just by listening all your music, such a talent and wonderful in overall !! Greatings from Poland <3 Love your music, is inspiration in many ways !!
This video is absolutely DIVINE!  Looks painful, not to mention if I'd done anything like that; I would have lost my lunch.  Well, I also have about 1/8  of your hair.  It wouldn't hold up.  You are INCREDIBLE in so many ways.
Out of the world, wow!!!

Artista completa! Maravilhosa! Parabéns pelo clipe e pelo esforço e perseverança para realizá-lo com perfeição!

Someone should show this to Pier bite his own tongue.
Thank you so much for your tears and efforts. This made me cry it was so, so beautiful. I wish you all the luck and happiness!
Это не высказать словами, как здорово, браво!!!!!
That was AMAZING! Sounds like music that should be in the Elder Scrolls.
Wonderful to see all your hard work and determination pay off after all the pain and tears...fantastic!!!!!!!!😍❤😍❤😍❤😍❤😍❤😍❤
That looks too painful of a performance for me to enjoy !!
An amazing performance from the strongest and the most amazing person in this world... Thank You again, Lindsay Stirling

Lindo,envolvente! Amei!!!
You're a strong person. Big congratulation for the success.
What is this ? Magic?
Lindsey, you never cease to amaze me.  That has to be one of the most incredible performances I have seen you do. Thank you for some awesome music, and and mind bending performance .... Happy New Year 🎆
but why?
Piers Morgan watching this: 💧👁👄👁
How are you so good at that awesome your are awesome 💕🤩😍🌺
I was watching this just saying... HOW???  I have dabbled in areal arts and this is unbelievable... making a coordinated graceful dance (with an unbelievable amount of core strength to do what she did) while still playing a musical instrument at her incredible skill level.  She is inhuman, and inspiration for what we can accomplish when we are determined and passionate.  Thank you Lindsey for being you and being amazing!
Can I give more than one like? That was beautiful and incredible.
Oooooooooooooooooohhhh how wrong Piers was back then!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2xL7D5lPAk&ab_channel=LukasKaeonin
HOLY AMAZING swinging by your hair and playing violin just incredible
AWESOME!!!!!! SHE  IS INCREDIBLE !!!😱😱😱
So divine🥰🥰magical 🌺🌹
Esto sí es ser artista😍😍
Bravo Lindsey. I am speechless.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💕💕💕💕💕💕 amazing and beautiful!!!!!! Proud of you.
What would you think if this was the first Lindsey video you ever saw?
Oh my.. Pls dont do that again, it make me feel so pain look at ur hair lindsey.. Dont torcher ur body again.. Love ur talent so much as violinst and dancer.. Dont do for 2nd time again ya..
Her eyebrows said 😳 lol instant face lift. It’s like what my mom used to do with my ponytails as a kid lol
Perfecto
You are truly inspiring, your music has helped me in so many ways 💖
She must be one heck of an athlete to pull that off. Very dangerous. Bravo... please don't do that again.
Hello class, welcome to How to Puke 101.
I do not know but what he does is surprising and it is something that really gives emotion when you see him and those feelings that he expresses with the violin I loved greetings from Mexico 🇲🇽
This performance had so many layers of power. What an amazing and inspiring woman you are!
my respects  ma'am love you, love the song, dont love you doing things that could harm you, your perfect as you are.  peace to you
ESSE VIOLINO É BEM DIFERENCIADO !
Oh wow it looks amazing but painful, is this painful? I'm always amazed by the dancers that perform this routine.
So proud of you! Wow your legs!!! So gorgeous and so in control. Just graceful and beautiful ❤️😭 and of course you didn’t miss a beat on that violin! AMAZING!
Saw the video of her training to do this.. Enduring so much for a performance for one specific piece of her craft.., ( I don't see her remaking many videos just to add this hair twirling act to them )., Is a sign of a true performer.. I consider her a multi-performer/athlete. And she keeps finding new ways to keep her craft fresh.. 😳🤔 Bravo👏👏👏.
She never fogot her lyrics🎈🎈💜💞💔💏⭐💑
I really have to wonder if the audio in this video is actually the audio captured during this performance, or simply audio from a studio recording dubbed over the video captured during the stunt. I find it hard to believe that she didn't miss a single note while being suspended in the air by her head. She's good, and I've loved her for years, but the audio seems a bit too clean to imagine it was recorded during this.
This song reminds me as a woman gets her pulled.    For loving a man =💜-0_o💗💏💏💑💃💃💃💃💃💃
Sin duda alguna, eres mi musa🤗
Simply marvelous
We're not worthy!!! That performance is the most incrediblwthing I've ever seen. Thank you so much Lindsey for your inspiring bravery.
And Piers Morgan said she couldn’t get away with flying through the air and playing the violin. Yet she hung in there and pulled it off. #homefortheholidays
Loved it so much 💖 after watching the last hair hanging vlog 🥺🙌😎👌 I was moved to tears! It was all skill! Way to go! Loved the growth!
all the time I focus on her face trying to concentrate and breathe and I try to realise how hard it has to be and how perhaps painful too
were you inspired by this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmYaYbXsOo  or maybe cirque de soleil?;-)
I really wanted to watch this but I have nerve damage in my head and  knowing how much it hurt you.. it triggers anxiety! You're amazing, strong and talented to boot. I'm watching as soon as I post this, I want to support you, triggers be damned. Thank you for you for your courageous spirit.
этож пипец как тяжело.... молодец !!! зайчик!)
Wow well done. : )
ça déchire , un ange lindsey , c est féérique , trés fan , lindsey est unique , on ne peut qu aimer , c est tellement beau , merci
Wow ! Lindsey that ...was...Amazing!
You were incredible! Stunning! Thank you for being inspirational. Like always ♡♡♡
This has blown my mind, seeing the making of and then the result has made me even emotional, it reminds me of my struggles as well and how I’ve made it through just like you have “Crystalyzed” this moment of breakthrough. It’s such a beautiful concept, theme and choreography. Lindsey is a true artist always pushing her to best and one of my personal inspirations! You have certainly made an amazing performance.
Perfection
Impresionante... feliz navidad..."buenas noches"
Music  was great, but the video wasn't something I could appreciate...Swinging from the hair had to suck and she really didnt look like she enjoyed doing it.
Wow just beautiful  takes me to another place of wow strongness
Wow. This is breathtakingly beautiful.
WoW!!! Bravo!!
Reminds me of the Doctor from Hellraisers 2.
Bravo! ❤️
This is one of the most beautiful works of art that I have EVER seen. Lindsay, thank you so much for bringing this beauty to us. You are a world class performer, and you are an angel brought to us to help lift us in these difficult times.
After watching the video you made about learning this technique, seeing how beautifully you performed literally brought me to tears. Your command of motion while airborne is amazing, and would make you a natural as an astronaut. Next concert, from the ISS!
This is absolutely one of the most beautiful things I have ever watched!!! You are incredible!!! It's always wonderful to see what amazing new concepts you will come up with while playing. God bless girl!!!
verdadeira performance, excelente.
Que le pone manita abajo 👎si ta buenisimo 👍👍👍👍👍
Круто 👏👍 но мне больше нравится тот клип, что в ледяном замке, а мелодия просто бомба
Зачем??? Ради чего такие жертвы?
Божественно 💞💞💞Соверенство💞💞💞
WOW...another GREAT performance 🤗  love the violin.
I know in art we endure sacrifices but this to me is ludicrous.  Your talent is so immense you needn’t go to such extremes for entertainment.🙀
This literally brought me to tears. You've come so far since I saw you live, I'm so proud. 💘
Lindsey, you are truly amazing. This video blew my mind. You're such an inspiration.
Just WOW...
This is truly the most gorgeous and phenomenal performance I have seen all year!!!!!!!!!! ✨🎇🎆
😀 ❤️ 🙏 😍 😊 👍 🎉 💐 🚀
Amazing and talented. Love her videos. So entertaining!
I hope after this video she did not have a headache 😅😅😂
I have respect for the will-power to do such incredible things, but assuming it hurts quite bad it doesn't feel right to me to like this, so I just leave my comment
I’m blown away, because that wasn’t just a beautiful performance, but it was brave and took incredible strength. Not a dry eye over here. Bravo! 🥲
Unbelievable!!! New level of Lindsey's show! Very impressive!  P.S. Take care yourself! I repeat that! You did it and proved yourself - you can do that.
Lindsey est merveilleuse elle s'est tout faire, elle est incroyable et très douée, toujours sur une musique enchanteresse et sublime, en plus des chorégraphies à couper le souffle, BRAVO !!!!
Великолепно👏👏👏😍😍😍
Beautiful awesome
I really love the performance. I just really don’t like how she that pain a lot. But I understand it. For the sake of art as I suppose and she was really an inspiring artist.
New teletubby
astonishing, we are far from Mette Edvardsen degenerate "art" .... THAT IS real prformance !
❤
Ｉlive in Japan.      This performance is nothing Japan. it's a very amazing！！！ Ｉwas very exciting！！！👍👍👍 　　　　　　　　　 (Ｉdon't study English)
this woman is a LEGEND, please God I wanna be like her when I grow up
You never cease to amaze me. You are so creative, so confident, and always looking forward to what you can try next. I will say for sure you are the most beautiful person I have ever seen in my life. Thank you for bringing light into a an otherwise dark time. Please don’t ever stop being you. Forever a fan and madly awestruck.
Melhor violinista do mundo😍😭🇧🇷
This is the most wonderful thing I have ever seen! You are magic! 🙌💟💟💟💟
It is amazing what she is capable of and of continually growing beyond its limits, but I hope she knows that she doesn't have to do that for her fans.
Question is she playing the actual song on her violin while “hung up” (that sounds so weird lol) or is she just randomly strumming in the video and recorded the song in a studio later.
i really love this song but now i was more like doesnt that hurt i care about you lindsey dont hurt your self for a performance we love the song but this looked 2 painfull
Lindsey, please, don't do it again 🥺🤧 Of course, this is very beautiful, but also very painfully! We don't want you to feel so much pain😭❤️
Awesome.  amazing performance.  The number of spins would have had most people falling over if not getting sick.  You are an amazing artist.  Looking forward to your next songs.  :)
Wow just wow
Зачем это?Хочешь играть - играй. Зачем цирк делать?
You will never stop amazing us!
Unbelievable.. 🥰
Wahnsinn 💫🙏💞
Eat your heart out Simon.
This is amazing!!!!! I hope that one judge sees this. You did an amazing job ❤️👍🏼
Hi Lindsey Stirling, I am just one of your old Fans and I wish you only the best in your Live !! Do you know Dimash Kudaibergen ?!
Very beautiful :) tremendous talent! I'm sure you had a headache after this one but you did an excellent performance
Yep. I'm impressed. Bravo!
Why did she make it?
Sin duda la mejor 😍✨
<3 .... Incredible and beautiful, Lindsey! <3
Absolutely beautiful!
I love❤💙💜💖  La amo💖💚💗
Wow she is incredible..  Wow ella es increíble
The best performance of anything in my lifetime but  please n let the video suffice and never do that again the pain was tangible.
I cannot enjoy something that comes from another person pain...
Only you can do this
te conoci por esta melodia, mira como te has superado, estoy tan orgullosa de ti
that can't be good for the scalp!
It's impossible 🥺🥰😍
Lol
Whoa... and I thought the original music video was already incredible. This blew my mind and congratulations to Lindsey for sticking with it! This completely made my Holiday weekend.
Tremendously astonishing and mind blowing ! Everyone should Really Appreciate her dedication towards this type of performance ! And as her first professional performance it is marvelous ! When I saw her vlogs before this shoot it was so painful to watch my most admired violist in this struggled and dedicative act Can't explain her pain and her struggles towards this practice properly with words! Tooo much exquisite!
This was so beautiful. It brought me to tears.
She sould go back to americas got talent and prove Piers morgan wrong
your trash gurl cheers
what a beautiful performance, linsey, a true performance, left me i'm speechless but gratitude and inspired to be seen such performance....
Eres increíble eres fascinante a nadie he visto a hacer cosa cual me quedé sorprendida sin creer que si era verdad pero es real me convertí en tu fan de veras eres estupenda saludos desde Bolivia 🇧🇴 😄 sigue así por qué encerio waoo haces que luche por mis sueños gracias 😄
Yay! So glad this is posted.  I missed this portion of the Christmas concert and was SO disappointed after having seen the preview! Fantastic work Lindsey!!! This obviously required spot ON balance. Hardly just "prancing around with a violin" as some haters have commented. I think it is very inspiring to our youth today to see such a great example of not only a very talented musician, but a woman who sets difficult goals for herself, and then FOLLOWS THROUGH..even though it cost you some tears.." and i'm sure a few lost hair's there"..and to make it look so effortless, as though you were just floating through the air....BRAVO!!!
love, stirling
https://youtu.be/aHjpOzsQ9YI Qu est ce que tu me fais la....
what work and especially what courage you had, continue, I adore you enormously ...
Al fin pude ver este video. Me sacó una lagrimita. Realmente emociona lo que Lindsey es capaz de lograr. Una inspiración para todos <3
This show seems magical!
Have to admit when I 1st watched this video I thought there had to be some kind of trick/ optical illusion. Just watched the prep video & had to watch again. Lindsey you are ridiculously talented! I can only imagine the will power to pull this off.  You are awesome!
I admire her and love her videos! Man to do that without showing how painful it can be is WOW!
VI TODO EL TRABAJO QUE HICISTE, TODO EL DOLOR QUE PASASTE , TODA LA FELICIDAD Y LO ÚNICO QUE PUEDO DECIR ES GRACIAS GRASIAS POR TU VOLUNTAD POR TU DESEO POR LA INSPIRACIÓN QUE PONES A MI MUNDO A NUESTRO MUNDO GRACIAS DE TODO CORAZÓN,  GRACIAS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
I cannot believe the amount of tears I should watching this it was so beautiful. But please don't ever do it again that looks so painful.
Как у нее получается удивлять каждым видео?
wow.impresionante como todo lo que hace jeje
Amazing! You are an inspiration! Thank you for sharing!
The show must go on! Never played live
that was so beautiful, i had tears trying to form in my eyes. Thank you for that Lindsay, it was a real joy to see this.
I cant think of any way this could have been done without a great deal of discomfort. I am impressed, dont doubt that, but yowch. I hope you dont have to do that too many more times in future.
That Was Awesome!!!!!!!!!°
You are a force of nature, Ms. Stirling.  Astonishing control, grace, art.
This is such a powerful and magical performance 👏🏻  I'm beyond amazed watching this masterpiece 👏🏻  God bless you ❤❤  I really can't find words to express my thoughts. I'm so happy and proud to know such a great artist. You are a wonderful human-being. You are motivation for me and I love the things you create ❤❤
What....?!
Bravo!
Ogni tua canzone, ogni tuo video è un esplosione emozionale. Spero tanto un giorno tu possa fare un concerto in italia, magari in Veneto, ti aspetto.
God is great
Nope ..... nope , Looks like you will have headaches for days .    🥺🥺 Hope that was your first and last ... Cause naaahhh , you crying there said it all . Even tho I know you had rehearsed this idk how many times . So like your fourth  or fifth last to last time  lol     Edit :.......... She did like 20 sessions of this and broke down so many times . But got back up again . She really did it . You go GIRL !!
This was AMAZING! You had me at the edge of my seat, holding my breath. But you nailed it and you accomplished what you couldn't believe you can do!
Ow! 😣 it hurts to watch. I don’t understand how she did that
Mesmerizing.
As always, you have found a new way to amaze me and bring tears to my eyes. Absolutely beautiful Lindsay!
I click on it and you start by showing support for the terrorists who are using the faux-demic to seize power.  Then seconds later it goes to a commercial for Apple which is one of the leading groups pushing the treason.  You could have stayed out of it.  But you _chose_ to get political.  Now choose your sides.  Either you support the terrorists calling themselves "Democrats" and the MSM.  Or you support America and will push for the pulling down of these fascists who have been lying to the world.
One word for this artist... wonderful!!!!!!! From italy
Афигенно. Просто не слов 😳
Афигенно. Просто не слов 😳
SUPER Mission accompli j'aime
💜She is incredible at all.💜  💜🔮🌟Great admiration.  Great respect.  Great inspiration and motivation for me.  Everything we want and what we want to achieve is only in our head.  We can influence our lives, our personalities, we can do what found the mind desires.  Only we have to make that decision first.🌟🔮💜
You did that! Congratulations!! It was stunning and it was recorded so you never have to do it again! :)
It truly amazes me that after accomplishing as much as she has, she is never satisfied with staying in one place. She's always branching out to learn new things she can use for her music and her videos, and I think that constant drive to push the envelope is what drives her success.
I watched this first, THEN I watched your vlog about this process! When I watched this first I could see the concentration and determination on your face throughout the whole vid, and I thought "This is not her normal face, but she's STILL doing it!" Then I thought I have GOT to watch her vlog, and I have to say Lindsey, I am greatly encouraged! I started watching you since the beginning, including your first version of this song, and watching you grow and change and openly admitting that you rely on Him, is so wonderful! I was moved and I wanted to let you know, and I hope and pray that you will continue to rely on Him who came on Christmas day! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
YAY!!! YOU DID IT!!!!  That was amazing Lindsey! YOU are amazing my dear. I saw your previous video, the pain you've been in and I cried with you. I admire your strength and determination to achieve your goals, no matter how difficult.  My 2 year old son and I love you and your music and jam out in the car, I've tagged you on Instagram of him really feeling and jamming to your tunes. Keep up the amazing work you've been doing, I always look forward to new music from you.
First thing I thought of: *HOLY HEADACHE!*
We all love you, Lindsey! That was incredible but please never do that again, we don't like seeing you in so much pain
Lindsey you are amazing I admire you so much, you are capable of so many things and you do all of them, and this is beautiful, for you and team: congratulations (and merry Christmas as well) this is stunning
You're so Amazing ! You can be Proud of you, you did it !!!!!!!  It's so wonderful ! You're a real wonder woman and you're a real role model for persistence <3
No words just ❤❤❤😘
"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong." 2 Corinthians 12:10 KJV  I'm proud of you girl :)
You're incredible. I don't have the words to express how magical this was to watch.
C’est incroyable, beau et très physique, quel talent
Oh my.... I was literally watching this soooo tensely, especially after having seen your blog about the behind the scenes training.  In fact, I was afraid to watch it for awhile.... It's a beautiful video, yes, but I'm still not so sure it was worth all that pain, let alone watching you in pain just for a 4 minute video 😰  Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and take care 🙃
Mind blown. Thank you for all you do! 🥰
I have to say after seeing how much you had to go through to make this video I have so much respect for you. The dedication and determination is absolutely mind-blowing. You have gone through a lot over the past 5 years and as you said you are stronger than you know. The pain you have gone through to make this video is heartbreaking to see however seeing you power through and making an absolutely amazing video is so satisfying to be a part of. You should be extremely proud of your self by how much you have grown and how much stronger you have become. Keep making your self stronger and I have no doubt that you will accomplish great and wonderful things. Whenever you have a goal go for it and fight hard. You will make the goal I have no doubt just take care of your self. The only one who knows your limit is your self.
Sorprendentemente genial!
Qué maravilla tu trabajo y el de todo tu equipo, muchas bendiciones a todos y Lindsey eres la mejor!!!!!!
Amazing job!
"You're Not Good Enough (...) to get away with flying through the air and try to play the violin at the same time" -Piers Morgan 2010.
I need her shampoo please 😨
My heart left after seeing this....we all know you're insanely talented but please don't put yourself in danger...
I'm uncomfortable just watching this... decided to look at comments for the reason for doing it. Goal or not, if this was for entertainment then you might as well put up stands on the freeway for car wrecks. I love the music but inflicting pain on yourself, not so much. Keep up the good work Lindsey but like the vast majority of commenters have said; "Don't do this again." Yikes.
That was freaking amazing. To do any one of those things would have been awesome...Playing the Violin, The ballet, The freaking flying through the air by your Hair!!!. Nope... not you lets do all if at the same time with flawless precision. Simply Beautiful... Thank you!!
Your such a strong girl lindsey i love it🤩👏
멋진데.....우...아프겠다는 느낌....
you still alive ? Good job !
You are amazing!
Piers Morgan: "You're not good enough to get away with flying through the air and playing the violin at the same time"
I have no words to describe how talented, inspiring, and awesome you are. Thank you for this ❤️
Beautiful 🥰😇❤🙏
You are awesome.
Impresionante!!! Perfecta!!!
😮 This is an impressive production.  You're fantastic, Lindsey ❤️❤️❤️
Since there is no other way to say it, Merry Christmas Lady Lindsey Sterling, It's a bit late, but hope it reaches you. Stay true.
So graceful & perfectly choreographed. All the hard work, blood sweat & tears paid off. ❤
Love u without makeup...
Extraordinario... Gracias por el arte y la creatividad que despliegas... Es maravilloso ver cada uno de tus videos... Es como eatar en deferentes mundos 😇
True Performer!
You're like the Jackie Chan of violinists! This is the Way!
Зачем так странно крепить кольцо? Это попытка изобразить ёлочную игрушку?
i have literal tears in my eyes rn idk if it's the music doing its work or if it's seeing you in pain or both. this was crazy mind-blowing Lindsey!! but please take care of yourself <3
Lindsey Sterling that was amazing. You are so inspiring and you are inspiring others by what you do. We can do anything we put our minds to no matter the pain or how rough the road looks and you just proved it all to us now.   Keep doing things like this and keep pushing yourself forward. You know that we can only get better by pushing ourselves out of our comfort zone.  WAY TO GO LINDSEY STERLING!!!
So so amazing. Your ability to endure awes me. It truly does. I think this video is right up there with your Hallelujah video you did. Instead of due to outward mental sources bringing you down to feeling the pain as in Hallelujah, it’s all the physical pain that triggers your inner demons this time, yet you have endured through both. Setting goals then finding yourself meeting them bit by bit, one day at a time, until you have created something that you can be proud of.   As much as I enjoy Crystallize, as music, it’s now moved into one of my favorites, to join Hallelujah, because of how much the video means to me. Thank you for sharing your journey to this beautiful piece.
Absolutely breathtaking! You are the strings, in the wind of change! Everytime positive change happens, we hear you! 💓
BRAVO!
Is she even a human....
This is truly magical, seeing everything that you went through to get here is amazing. I had just found out that my cousin had passed away two days ago and your music is something that I can always go to to make me feel like everything is alright. Keep doing what you’re doing!
Yes we can all overcome pain but is it worth it for art? If you smashed your hand you'll survive but you don't know the long term effects.
Extremely good performance but I prefer when you smile.
✨I D O L A✨
How does she make a headache look beautifully graceful? Love the performance though Lindsey.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🥂sos una artista con todas las letras, feliz navidad Lindsey, una loca admiradora desde Argentina🇦🇷 Buenos Aires💖😍😘
Kinda  creepy when you have to get pulled from the top of you're head, instead of making a consciousness decision to just wear a hoist; or somthing. :•)🙂
how is she doing this without getting a headache or throwing up. 😮
Very beautiful Lindsey ♥ Thank you 🌠♥⛄🎻 🌠
So incredible and fantastic
Thank you so much for this.  Now more than ever we need to reach for our dreams and sometimes when that doesn't work out quite right we have to watch others do the same so we can get the inspiration we need to get something impossible done.  For many people that includes getting out of bed this morning. Lots of people will say why do that, that hurts, why would you do that to yourself blah blah blah.. now more than ever it is important to say "I do this because I can. Because I choose to." Thank you Lindsey.
Wow.
Extraordinary and Beautiful!!!
You are just the most amazing woman!  I have no words that match the beauty  and strength of that performance.  I hope you have a wonderful holiday season!
Lindsey challenged herself to keep improving her craft and to learn something groundbreaking (and mind breaking) this year.  I knew the resulting video would be magical, but her despair during her learning process made me wonder if it would all be worth it in the end.  I hope Lindsey is happy and that she and her family (blood and musical/tour) are safe and well.
It would be pretty cool for a musician to be an actual Cirque du Soleil _act_. .
When i listen your music you always make me fly.... And now this.... 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Video about the choreo please!!!
It's great! It's perfect!
And here I am complaining I have a headache whenever I wear a top knot for work
SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!👏
merci Lindsey toujours un rêve cette musique
Wow, that was intense and amazingly awesome. !!!
This performance is a Beautiful Masterpiece i know it's painful to see she injured her self with it but i don't think is good or bad for her to try New stuff but she can improv more with more stuff that  what she face she trying to be herself
such pain, so many tears but still u manage to suppress ur human limits and leave us shocked watching u with all our love and admiration.  The melody is so beautiful and angelic like ur presence and determination ❤️❤️ keep up with ur goals and challenge urself everyday and by that inspire so many ppl out there. ❤️
This is bringing performing art to the next level. Merry Christmas🌌🎻
Eight years ago they said you'd never fly through the air and play the violin. Eight years ago they said that you alone wouldn't be enough to fill a theater and light up the stage. That you would need a group. You stand as a testament to us all that all things in life are in fact achievable and that through willpower, hard work, determination, and growth anything in life is within reach!
fantastic
Magic
trying not to cry cause im alive at the same time as this absolute legend
Amasing jod, congratulation !!!!
Beautifully done Lindsey. You literally had me crying, because i could see how much pain you were in. You are so inspirational. Hugs
Sublime
I’m in shock...😳😳
Gracias ! Aunque eres ya increíble con tu violín , ya no hagas más esos sustos a tus fans porfavor preciosa !
This is so amazing, it brought tears to my eyes! She is so wonderful! She’s so special I’m very proud of her wide range of talent! Congrats Lindsey! I love to watch u and listen to ur wonderful music! You are one of a kind! Thank you for ur entertainment! Words can not describe how my heart goes out to you and all your beauty and talent! God bless you! Your out of this world! Can’t wait to see how u express your drive to be great at what I do! 🤟🏼👍🏼👏🏼🤩🥰👱🏻‍♀️🌸🎻🩰🎼💕💯❗️🎶🎵🇺🇸
This Is Amazing!!! I'm Such A Big Fan 😁😁  But Also That Seems Painful-
I wish people would pay MORE attention to the artists and less to the tedious you tube comments..... like a fairly mundane sentence (see below) does NOT deserve 4.5k whereas hanging from hair DOES deserve 58k likes!!!
Magnífico  Mágico
where can I get a violin like that?
wow! Amazing!
I like the violin :)
😋👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💗
you're a phenomenal
All the discomfort, all the pain, all the doubt and negative thoughts. Just know it was worth it in the end for something so beautiful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aky-J-b9LcU ВЫ, МОЛОДЕЦ!!! Через боль и стремление сделали ШЕДЕВР!!! Низкий поклон!!!
And shy did it... impressive.
this is absolutely amazinggggg and beautiful u worked so hard for this but it was sad to see u in so much pain
First of all: The performance was great! You did so well, conquering your fear and trying new things out! But please don't push yourself too much. Also take some time to relax and unwind. You have earned a break for enduring the pain this much.
I wouldn’t do it....well maybe if somebody puts numbing needles in my body. Also I myself would like to use a noose on stage and hang my head from that instead of the hair. It be a good ominous effect from me.  X3
Eres increíble, única, impresionante
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ woooooow... 🤗 Dios Te Bendiga  Lindsey... eres grande 😇 mi piel se puso chinita 🤍
This is art at the highest level.
Happy holidays plus why did you do something that is to much pain please don’t do it again
Después de ver el vídeo quedé completamente admirado, sigue tocando maravilloso y bailando increíble. Admiro tu trabajo y tu esfuerzo, muchas felicidades ¡continua trabajando!
😱😱😱🥺🥺🥺 genia
Que lindo!!!! Muy hermoso!!! Bravo👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 🥰
Tried this at home too...now i'm bald.
Да чтоб я сдохла,это,мать его,прекрасно.
Fantastic!! What skill and talent...
The truth, you inspire me to play the violin, and you play very well.
I only have one word.        WHY
Insane! But you absolutely killed it! This is my favorite song as well. ♥️
Lindsey! It's a beautiful! Strange..? But why?!
AMAZING! ❤️
Request next playdate cover violin
Is Lindsey trying to tell us that she likes having her hair pulled? :3
Wow! This is breathtaking! Beautiful job! Merry Christmas
Woow,  sin palabras .
Lindsay, you're done! You are a talented violinist and strong spirit! Bravo!!!👍👍👍💪💪💪👏👏👏
The new version of Crystallize sounds wunderfull - but I really can't like the video. I can't get the pictures of your pain and your tears out of my brain - and your face at the end of the video does not look happy... Only more pain. And so the whole time, I only hear the question: Why? And this is not the kind ot video I want to see - I like it, when you are happy about what you did! But for me it's no pleasure to see somebody's pain, sorry.
This is so scary and so beautiful at the same time...Amazing work! Please, take care of yourself!
Again you can't appreciate this dedication in a single youtube comment, but thank you for being a real life superhero
I adore this. Was it painful? I believe that you are okay
Have the paracetamol and codeine ready. I'll never complain my hair is sore again.
You're so Brave like always 😭💔
You should make a glass snow globe with her dancing in it as it plays her music.
COOL! куда можно поставить еще 10к лайков. p.s. all the pain on your face
May this Christmas season bring you closer to all those that you treasure in your heart.  Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New year ✰
Lindsey never ceases to amaze me with her, music, videos, ideas and overall attitude and passion for what she does. I remember watching her get eliminated on AGT and I thought those judges were so wrong and they were missing something amazing. Good for her for continuing to do what she loves and proving everyone wrong.
Very beautiful, very talented, very painful and very dangerous. Lindsey is a very talented actress, I love her very much. But I believe that no audience is worthy of such sacrifices being made for their entertainment.
Lindsey! You are so fearless, determined and inspiring us! You prove to me that 2020 it wasn't just a pandora box. His bodily intelligence and strength deserve to be applauded! Thanks for was born and Merry Christmas!
Warum macht sie das?
I was absolutely delighted with this video. Unfortunately, I had no money for an online concert.
The video of you learning made me cry and this video watching you succeed made me cry. Beautiful job. I pray you are safe and weren't hurt in any way. Can't wait for the next video, but next time, please don't do anything that hurts you so much! As amazing as it was, you don't need to do stuff that crazy for us to adore you! Merry Christmas!
Alguém por favor dá um Oscar pra essa mulher 😱
Absolutly Amazing.... that video.... is perfect
Hats off...
You can now advertise shampoos: "Strong hair from roots to ends!"
Ты невероятная!🙀❤️
Extraordinaria!!!!
Oh my goodness!  Literally breathtaking!
EPIC !
❤️
Very beautiful. My daughter loves you very much. And inspired by your compositions. She chose a violin for herself. And happy every day because he can play on it. Thank you ❤️
Absolutely beautiful performance. Worth the tears.
Wow! Question is she playing the actually song on her violin while “hung up” (that sounds so weird lol) or is she just randomly strumming in the video and recorded the song in a studio later. I’m not a violin person so I can’t really tell.🤷🏼‍♀️ This is so beautiful however they did it!❤️
👏🏻👍🏻... очень здорово и необычно, старая мелодия в новом исполнении... не знаю какие ощущения были у исполнителя, но я переживал за исполнителя...
Whats a amazing performance ❤
You truly will never stop amazing me with what you can do while playing the violin 😅🧡
Felicitaciones Quedo hermoso! Los frutos son los hermosos despues de sembrar crecer en las adversidades de la vida  Grax x tal ejemplo!
Abosutely blown away!  This is art 😍 And what you went through just for this, wow... you crazy but we love you for it!
Incredible
Wao. Espectacular. Me encanta mucho esta mujer. El violín a otro nivel.
Q linda 🥺❤️ simplesmente maravilhosa!
''You cant get away with playing violin and flying through the air''  Lindsey: Give me a few years
amazing <3
好用心
Невероятная!!! Сотворил же Бог чудо!🙌❤️🙏
This is a masterpiece of self-confidence, inner strength and art. Chapeau, Lindsey.
Quelle performance !!! Vous êtes splendide et avez un tel dévouement dans votre dépassement du soi. Vous êtes impressionnante. Je n'ai qu'un mot : Waouh !!!
I was distracted by looking for the wire.
So great, amazing <3
Ouch ! I have a headach
An incredible, breathtaking performance!!! It's a huge achievement to overcome the pain and show a smile when it's hard for you!!! Whatever the reasons for choosing such a number - you have achieved your goal!! You did it!!!! But the real new year's gift is your well-being and health! Dear Lindsay, merry Christmas to you and your team!!! Create magic in dance and music, but take Care of yourself!!!!!!!
note to all watching this - there is someone in your life that NEEDS to see this, it will become a miracle --- share, share, share,,,,,,,
Perfekt und Wunderschön.
Аж мурашки, вот это исполнение
Великолепно ! Высший бал.
The best performance in "Got Talent" in the world... Wait ... I love your music, dedication and passion for the music Lindsey. Happy Merry Christmas and regards.
это не опасно??!!
Isn’t that hurt so much? I realy appreciate your hard work and your magical music but I hope you put your physical and mental health first ,you don’t have to go throgh so much pain like this . I love you stay safe❤️
Flawless performance! Not sure if Lindsey checks this comments herself, but in case she does, want to tell you I WIILL NOT SUPPORT YOU doing this stuff ever again! You don’t need to put your safety and health at risk for us to enjoy your music. So please take care of yourself so we can enjoy your music for decades to come. Love you! 😘
Beautiful artistry and choreography but I had trouble enjoying it because it must have been so painful.
😨
A genius! Merry Christmas, Lindsey 👏🎄
Боже, Линдси, что ты творишь с собой? Это же больно. И очень красиво
Lol. Anyone else think of Lil Pete from Ridiculous 6?
Circus Olay take notes this is pretty cool.  Marry Christmas. And we’ll cross our fingers and I hope for a better year🤞🏻🤞🏻with you.  🙂.
NOSTALGIA super genial ❤️
Never fails to bring those beautiful, careless fairy vibes to make you feel weightless. ♥️
That was epic
this doesn’t seem safe girl
I wish I could give another like every time I watch this.
But, can she pass americas got talent? Or maybe play smoke on the water while smoke a cigar?
You are amazing! This performance is magical! ❤
Where did you get the idea of doing hung by hair dance?! I am overly impressed, but was the pain worth it? I can see the mind over matter pain and addressing fears. I love what you do and keep growing inward and outward! Merry Christmas young lady!
The dedication for art - I love that about your passion <3
I feel like I've been watching you for as long as there's been a YouTube, and you never cease to amaze
I have not seen such a remarkable performance since Laurie Anderson! Thank you, you are an inspiration. I'll add, i'm glad you didn't listen to Piers Morgan!
I love the music but just never do that to yourself again. PLEASE
I remember listening to this song over and over again with spontaneous me when I first ran into your channel years ago! How you have grown and progressed great job keep thanking God for everything he does for his children.
Mesmerizing!
Stop encouraging artists to self mutilate for your entertainment.
Wooow i just admire You. So strong and Big artist.
Wow! ! !
Wow absolutely magnificent.
Namaste ty🖖✌ we are limitless amazing performance 👁✌
Lindsey - A great Christmas song that would be STUNNING on your violin is "In the Bleak Midwinter", if you don't know it, look it up. I think it would be a gorgeous addition to your Christmas music.  Hope you see this. Merry Christmas!
Got to realize she's the Tom Cruise of the violin world. Lindsey obviously feels the need to explore her limits as a performer and has the right to do so. How do you know your boundaries if you don't push them a little? She's been doing this long enough to do it as safe as possible .  Unique and amazing performance. Respect.
Absolutely incredible🎶👏👏👏
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow! You are So inspiring! I know it hurt you to do this, as you confide in another video, and like others, I hope you give it a solid check mark of  "done that magnificently" and go on to your next want <3 All the best, and Season's Greetings, Lindsay!!
I love it!!!!!! Your amazing!! Thank you!!!
You have come so far!! Congratulations on working so hard and earning everything you have in life! Keep being you Lindsey!! ❤️🥺🥰
I love this
fantastique
Stunning job, Friggin Amazing performance  Love seeing and hearing you
Incredible!
Wow! Just wow! ❤️
That was INCREDIBLE. She is so poised; her balance and lines...and the violin...there's just no words. She has the balance, flexibility, grace and strength of a ballerina 💗 I'll never get tired of hearing this song, and I'll never get tired of Lindsey's incredible determination to achieve what she sets out to do, and smash barriers.
Beautiful things are difficult -Plato
GENIAL  LINDSEY  HERMOSA COREOGRAFÍA
This is so amazing and beautiful I love u so much Lindsey and for some reason it made me cry a little bit 💙
It's ok, you can cry now. Looks soooo painful :S
Great job, Lindsey! You've breathed new life into one of your earlier songs and made it a Christmas Eve Spectacular for me. Beautiful, just beautiful, what you've done here. I feel inspired! Thanks so much!
What an incredible story. So stunning Lindsey. So stunning.
Amazing. I admire you so much as an artist and human being. The way you push yourself is so inspiring, to always be so uniquely ethereal is just pure magic!💜
This performance aways brings tears to my eyes. My chest swells with pride of how far Lindsey has become and what she has accomplished. This performance was beautiful, jaw dropping, stunning, you'd think impossible but she persevered. That said, I won't be mad if she never does that again. The physical pain she went through was more than she should have to bear to sell tickets. I'm watching her special over and over as long as I can.
This is amazing and beautiful but also OW
I am just completely blown away, absolutely amazing and breath taking. I congratulate you on achieving this dream you set for yourself.
This was beautiful on its own right, but I missed your smile. I hugely respect you for taking the journey to do this, but I hope I will never have to see you like this again.
Me encanta Dios continue Bendiciendo tu carrera y tu Vida en General
C'est superbe, une très belle prouesse même si sur certaines rotations rapides et longues il me semble difficile physiquement de pouvoir continuer à jouer sans erreur de variation de rythme 🤔 Le montage vidéo/musical est parfois trop propre (on voit tout de même par moment que les ralentis vidéos ne correspondent plus à ses mouvements), laissez un peu d'imperfection qui fait aussi parti de la beauté de son art.  Après à force d'entraînement elle est devenue aussi une énorme athlète, en tout cas grand chapeau pour cette ''torture'' capillaire très très douloureuse qui vous permet encore de nous jouer une musique toujours aussi belle, enivrante et entraînante 😵 Limite on a envie de s'évader, de s'accrocher avec vous ou de vous supporter pour soulager votre ''douleur'' 🤗 Qu'est ce qui vous a poussé à "maltraiter" votre si belle chevelure alors qu'elle fait partie en plus de votre ''charme'' en plus des chorégraphies et de votre musique ??
I have a headache already! 🤦‍♀️😂 I love her! She is awesome!
beautiful, but ouch!
YOU DID IT!!!!!! IT'S BEAUTIFUL, WELL DONE!!!!
Dangerous yet graceful, and just so mesmerizing! Such a different approach to artistry! You are a pure entertainer!!!!
That was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. Period.
I can’t watch this knowing how much pain you went through making this😭💔
Simply spectacular
GO TO AMERICANS GOT TALENT AND PROOF THEM WRONG
Magnificent!
woooow Lindsay! you broke your fears
Una maravilla.
If you aren’t suffering for your art are you even an artist?! Way to go Lindsey you’re the woman I hope my girls grow up to be!
Обалдеть!! Супер 👏 😻👍👏
Such a stunning performance and I love the white costume that went with it! I think it was much better than the usual black suits you see for choreographies
iS that was incredible.  But I hope it didn't hurt!
There you go Pierce....... LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL AMAZING WOMAN!!!!!! She Wins!!!😉❤️🥰 She Absolutely IS ...THAT...GOOD👸🏼🧚🏻💃🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Wow, incredibly simply impressive inspiring for what a person can do.
sweet heart, i can see the pain in your eyes, I am sending hugs to you
Это невозможно!
Merry X-mas, And yeah You Schon stemina In 'crystallize", MTW Hoo Made This new geiger?
I have no words for it! You outdid yourself! Congratulations to you for the performance. I admire you very much. I wish you much success! Thank you for that.
Considering that you only had a few months to learn how to do something that takes usually many MANY years to master, for you to be able to do this performance at any capacity was amazing in itself....however, you went above and beyond that, showing that if you put your mind to something, and you believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything.  Thank you for giving such an impactful visual display ♥   PS: I hope your noggin is feeling better!
So proud of you for pushing through.   I can see the concentration you required to finish this.   Beautiful! I can't imagine your relief when it was over.
Lindsey the beast!!!
My 30something son and I just cried watching. Took my breath away!
You are the best, from the best, from the best :)
That was brilliant, thanks so much for a great uplift in these trying times
Приветствую Люди, классное выступление
Incredible performance 🔥😍
Bellissima lei e la sua musica
a word that defines this performance: spectacular
I love her songs. Dont stop Ms. Stirling. Greetings from the Czech republic
Einfach nur RESPEKT !
I've been hung from my head before (it's rather soothing, actually) but I can't imagine hanging from my hair and dancing at the same time! Much less throwing a violin into the mix!
https://youtu.be/3xb30cdo8O0
I want to see Lindsey collaborating with Thomas Bergersen! Anyone else??
I’m Absolutely Speechless!!! What A Performance!!
Хороша!!
A angel of elegance
She's getting a little old.  Normally   she would not need the harness to fly!!!
I'm a big fan of Lindsey---but NOT a fan of the hair-hanging. Part of Lindsey's appeal is that she seems to have so much fun performing her art, and on this one her pain is obvious and she didn't smile at all. And no one wants her to get hurt! But congrats for being so unique!
Eres la mejor
I wish I could like this video 1 billion times. It gives me goosebumps <3
Astonishing and breathtaking.
Oh man.... watching what she went through and then watching this was ...... I have no words , she made me gasp too many times to count and tears just kept flowing, this woman is just magnificent , god Lindsey I am so proud of you
I bet her Chiropractors like..."sooo you look like you have some unusual head and neck issues, what have you been doing?"
This performance made me tear up.... absolutely beautiful and phenomenal.  I could see the pain in your eyes, but I could also see the sheer bravery and determination. Incredible.  You are an inspiration!
Sublime vous vous êtes surpassé, 🤩🤩🤩🤩
MP 46, you where there!
love you lindsey. Youre music is so beautiful. its giving me strenght en hope in this hard times. we are in lockdown now.  But please dont hurt yourself no more. Love from the netherlands
You're sooooo Amazing!!! Goosebumps as Always!!!!🎄🔥🙏💫❤😁 Merry Christmas Beautiful!
Que elegancia yo apenas se preparan la ensalada :''V
Solo 3 palabras   Sos la mejor ❤
I guess this went into a Guinness record
Absolutely  beautiful 😍 you're dedication shows
Please don’t feel like you have to do this again, for the sake of your health, physical and mental. You are the best violinist there is, but no one wanted to ever see you in so much pain during those rehearsals. Yes it looks amazing but please don’t willingly hurt yourself
I have no words for this amazing performance of "Crystallize". I watched whole concert <3 And I must to say that "I Wonder As I Wander" was a masterpiece too!!
Кога она  в космос полетит или из желудка кита играть будет?
Amazing choreography! It must be a difficult feat to play and be in constant motion where you could end up anywhere. You did just that! Way to go!
There is nothing this young lady can't do!
Lindsey said it straight out that she almost gave up on this but she stick through it and she gives God the full credit for giving her the strength she needed to keep going you go girl keep fighting God has your back and so does your fans many prayers to you God bless you we love you.
Привсем моем уважении, это дичь какая-то
WOW!! you can do anything
Wow!!!!
😨👏👍
Such an amazing and beautiful talent!
Yup! That was amazing!
Congratulations on a stellar performance, Lindsey. You pulled off something completely new and did it beautifully. Merry Christmas <3
In all honesty and in spite of a truly mesmerizing performance, it was really painful to watch pain on your face. Please, don't do something like this again. Merry Christmas, and stay safe.
Very beautiful, but don't repeat that, plz. You could seriously damage your hair.
Magical
THE MOST BREATHTAKING PERFORMANCE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! 😱😱😱
So amazing and unbelievably talented.
Te quedó hermoso el vídeo Lindsey, valió la pena todo el sacrificio que hiciste, horas de entrenamiento, frustración y dolor físico. Te agradezco de corazón tu esfuerzo para darnos algo bello y diferente. Eres única♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I'm Soo proud of her!
Clap clap clap 🙌👏🏼that was wow good job 👍
wow ... you are worthy of admiration, you have a great talent and a great fighting spirit, you are wonderful ..... I hope to see you in person at the moment I would love that, I leave you a big hug 🤗
This gave me chills 😫 your such an inspiration. I can't stop watching this.
My queen
This was beautiful in a lot of ways but also hard to watch. I’m proud of you, however. ❤️
Ты такая талантлиая, твоё искусство для меня, как глоток свежего воздуха сквозь всю эту дешёвую попсу. Желаю тебе и дальше способность творить такие сногсшибательные произведения
Just WOW, Lindsay you are always amazing. ❤
О мой бог...  Это... Невероятно. Ты большая молодец! Ты невероятна!
Perfect ❤️
what an incredible show! this is next level stuff! Kudos to you
I've only seen this Video today. And Really miss Sterling I love your music. But if you are doing such a Thing again, I will unsubscribe and stop buying and hearing your music. I know you are very dedicted to it, but thats a no go. Your health comes first. I wish you all who read this a merry Christmas and a good Start in the New Year.
Hola, soy super fan tuya y me he quedado flipando al ver el vídeo por que es increíble el esfuerzo que has realizado para poder colgarte de tu pelo mientras tocas el violín, dando vueltas y con todo ese dolor en la cabeza. Muchas gracias por tu esfuerzo y hacer que confiemos en nosotros mismos. Un abrazo.
That was just incredible.. the performance the music everything incredibly moving. All I can say is WOW. Keep doing what you do Lindsey Merry Christmas
Whoa!
What I want to no is if you can actually play with that much accuracy while doing that or is just staged to look like you are playing?
I just wanted too stop by and wish you all and lindsey a wonderful Christmas and a safe new years. Can't wait and see what's in store for 2021.😍😍😍
I'm so proud of you Lindsey!!!💖💖💖💖 I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and New Year!!! Next year, when I move to my new house and start a new job, I'm going to see if there are aerial acrobatic lessons I can take to get back into aerial dancing and maybe try hoop dancing.
The fact that you can see the fear, anticipation and strength in her face is beyond describable. The most incredible lady on planet earth.
This is beautiful but seems so unnecessary. Why hang by your hair? Girl, it was both amazing and uncomfortable to watch this.
Absolutely beautiful but please never do it again the goal was achieved and perfectly done but the pain endured and tears cried should be the last for this type of performance you are a beautiful talented soul may you always be blessed
This girl is AMAZING!! hat an inspiration!! Now I wanna see everyone of those judges on AGT hang by their hair!!  Would serve them right!!
...THE POWER OF THE MUSIC...SALUTI🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
NAGYON BOLDOG KARÁCSONYT MINDENKINEK! AMAZING!  ❤️💙❤️
Your Amazing!!!!
Это было излишество. И совершенно не красиво, кроме музыки конечно. Видно, что  Линдси было больно, некомфортно, в каком то замкнутом темном павильоне, неинтересный костюм и без шикарной прически. Когда ее подвесили за это кольцо, она потеряла свободу, это нехорошее чувство, наверно. А до этого было видео, где Линдси плакала, каждый день. Я не хочу, чтобы ее выступления были полны боли.
That looked really hard well done
WoW 🤩!!! This beyond epic and breathtaking.
No se puede mesclar la danza con el violin , ere simplemete una gran estrella . Como vuelas y tocando el violin simplemente hermoso .maravilloso hiciste lo impocible 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🥰👑👑👍👏👏👏👏
This is absolutely stunning! Definitely one of my favourites now.
за волосы, больно наверно.(буркнул.. сохраните красавицу хоть целой)
I cried watching this knowing the pain you went through to get here. I'm so proud of you and what you accomplished! This is amazing!❤️🎄
Вот это жесть, ты умничка) Жаль только в Россию не едешь с концертом
Stunning!
My gosh! I'm astonished. Every time I think she can't better herself (she's the only one who could), SHE DOES WITH HONORS!!!! This performance made me cry. It's brilliant. AND MAD!!! Love, love, love for you, Linds!
hairfall maxima!
Waooooo fantastico
Lindsey is a real wonderwoman!
Amazing, awesome, simple the best
👏👏👏
Uoooow this was AMAZING!!! I saw your videos about the process and I imagine how difficult it was. You are LEGEN... WAIT FOR IT... DARY!!!
Wouahhhh
Great job Lindsey! You have some crazy willpower seeing how hard that was for you to go through.
F a n t a s t i c 😁😭❤️
If you want to fly you will
Always amazed....bravo lindsey!!
WOW! JUST WOW! I love your work #lindseysterling, your the most amazing violinist ever!! One of a kind ✨❤🙏🙌
Beautifully done and thank you, as painful as it was.
You r an angel, such a beautiful and determined soul dancing in the air! But pls dun do it again, we want to see the little happy dancing violin angel, we don't want you in pain or get hurt. Still, it's amazing and YOU DID IT!! Big claps to yourself, and don't do this ever again
This gorgeous woman never fails to amaze me
How can she still be spinning and playing?
Amazing!
Normalmente si comento por aquí suelo hacerlo en ingles para que si algún día lo lee no tenga que preocuparse por entenderlo o no o por el traductor etc. Pero me he quedado absolutamente bloqueada y solo me sale describir esta maravilla en castellano. Es una autentica locura el vídeo y todo lo que ello supone, los ensayos, el dolor, la pasión y dedicación que le pones a todo. Gracias  por ser como eres y hacer estas cosas increíbles que te dejan sin aliento al verlas. Misión cumplida, no vuelvas a sufrir de esta manera, nos encanta como eres y no hace falta tanto dolor, porque con menos ya nos dejas a todos asombrados. Felices fiestas, feliz año nuevo y que sigas siendo tan carismática, talentosa y buena persona como eres. Te queremos Lindsey.
Beautiful performance Lindsey.
I have to say  while this video  was absolutely impressive it's probably my least favorite of yours, it's simply not enjoyable to see you in pain, close to tears, and so far from your usual onstage personality. Thank you for all your hard work nonetheless
Wow! Such an amazing feat! Now take good care of your hair. You have such beautiful hair.
WOW
You’re so weird and so beautiful ☺️
Chapeau to you, Lindsey. Amazing performance and incredible effort of willpower and perseverance
lindsey your are totally crazy o.O  that makes me cry...so beautiful
Woah. That seems euphoric.
Something Seth Everman cant do
There's no need to feel pain for making a vídeo. Yes it's beautiful but I didn't enjoy it. I Don't enjoy seeing you suffering but enjoying the performances. So please Don't
Умница ;)
It's good
Amazing... I mean... No words... Nevermind... But seriously... Dont do that again... Other then painful it seem to be extremely dangerous.... The scalp is a strong tissue but yet can get easily hurt... Sorry... Combat medic's mind🤦‍♂️
Boring
wow, thats insane... this is the first ive heard of "hair hanging aerialists" and its wild. i have a feeling that there are no 600 pound  hair hanging aerialists because their head would probably be ripped off. id have to assume its a lightweight persons game.
Absolutely stunning made me cry just watching it  can’t imagine what the feeling would be like to see it live
!!!
She is my perfect love that was soo BOMB
ouch ouch ouch... there are easier ways to get into Cirque Du Soleil otherwise... wow
Amazing. Not a fan but definitely am now. 👏
Wow
Most beautiful way to wreck into the 2021 :D

Beautiful. thank you.
This young lady is absolutely amazing and sooooooo talented.  What an incredible performance under such extreme conditions yet she does it so elegantly!  Beautifully done Lindsey!
This was amaaaaazing !!
You are amazing! Full stop. Hard work does pay off.
How can anyone dislike this video?
Girl I love you but please take an Advil cause that looks painful
A no t pases ! Que talento, yo ya me hubiera desnucado 😱😱😱😱😱❤❤
That was beautiful. Totally mesmerized and magical. I can't believe you did all that hanging by your hair! Amazing! :D
what is dreamed, is achieved. you are always the best. 😊
Вы восхитительный артист! Ваши клипы удивительны, они пронизывают в самое сердце. Спасибо.
Absolutely brutal and torturous but at the same time stunningly beautiful. This is amazing.
wow...
Wow. Wow. Wow! Absolutely amazing, jaw dropping! Applaud you, lady! What now America's Got Talent?! Dang!!! Get it, girl! Thank you for blessing us all with your gift!!
extraordinary and magically captivating!
Eres grandiosa. felicidades.
We all got some talent wear breathing 😎🌎
OHH
Glad to see this reprise of “Crystallize”. It’s like Cirque du Soleil meets the violin. Impressive performance and much needed to lighten the mood of 2020.
Yes this is VERY cool. Amazing! Incredible! But can I just say...  OOOWWWWWWWW!!!!!
I love you Lindsey, don't EVER do anything else that is gonna hurt you again. We'd love you if you just came out and played row row row your boat.
Wow!
I get it. A Flying Violinist. Playing a Flying-V Volin.
She is so amazing!!!!
Amazing 🥰💖👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Now that was Beautiful... Wonderful and thank you for your art and you!!!
How does amazing artistry have dislikes? Lindsey your artistry amazes me and your adversity is inspiring.
You didn't need to do that, to show how incredibly talented you are 🥺 Neverthless you're my biggest inspiration 🥰 Ms. Lindsey. We all love you xoxo.
You are so aspiring Lindsey!
!
Incredible. Keep flying ~
can we- can we make merch that says 'hold my hair' with like a drawing of lindsey swinging from her hair? pls? I'd buy ten
Anyone else just sit there going 'No freaking way' and then watch this QUEEN be FABULOUS. In the words of Jeniffer lopez I got Goosies. Love you sm Lindsey our really such an inspiration. I also want to message her head rn bc that low key looked like it hurt but like SUCH respect.
how could you possibly do that, wow, very surprising, you are amazing, I am always amazed every time you see your show, always successful, and never stop working
Awesome!!!
Lindsey admirable tu gran esfuerzo 👏👏...Muchas felicidades eres una mujer valiente que le encanta experimentar lo nuevo 💕..todo mi amor y respeto
You are truly ! amazing ! 💜
When she was showing the preview, I thought she was using a harness.  Her heavy breathing at the end says it all.  😯
Well done Lindsey! 👏 great job showing mind over matter! Your an inspiration! This video and your sacrifice should be a beacon to anyone that they can overcome anything! Depression anxiety ptsd...whatever pain you have or your going through you can get through it and accomplish anything! Push through the pain because in the end it will be worth it! Thank you Lindsey for your sacrifice and for a great show!
Spinning that fast and still keeping time while playing.😳 Oh not mention the hair thing. True professional.
Coming back for the second time after watching the behind the scenes for this, and the inclusion of her breaths in the audio is EVERYTHING.
Winter Solstice Pick A Card Reading https://youtu.be/MyD68qaHp2k
Amazing as always! Hope someday i will see it in live.
Gives me goosebumps every time I watch it. It’s extraordinary. Breathtaking. Beautiful.
https://youtu.be/Aky-J-b9LcU Here is the link to know about her preparation Lindsey vlog
I have never seen something so amazing yet so horrifying in my entire life
Amazing! So strong and beautiful!
WOW! Absolutely breath taking!!
no existe publicidad de Shampoo q pueda superar esto, realmente impresionante
Beautiful 😍😙
The hair hanging look is not complimentary the artistic achievement is amazing however
You must have had a terrible headache afterwards.  The performance was amazing.
Good job on the hair hanging dance 😎
Stop.
Very enjoyable and amusing good job 😁
That was ABSOLUTELY INSANE. My mouth literally dropped open when you started spinning, and while I am pretty sure you now qualify as an Avenger, I agree with the other Stirlingites, please don't put yourself through so much pain! We already love you tremendously, and there is NO ONE you need to prove that you can do impossible things to! God loves you even more than we do, and "with God all things are possible." We already believe this, now please be good to yourself! I know there are reasons that you must do things that only you and God understand, but it's still hard to see you suffer. Please understand, it's just because of how much we love you, and excuse our fussing. Have a blessed Christmas, Lindsey!
Wow you are crazy talented and disciplined.
You are insanely good, talented, and unique, without sacrificing parts of yourself, no matter how beautiful you make it look! Next time have the "idea" people look in directions that do NOT include pain!
Awesome,  so brave and beautiful. I'm sure that if I replay enough times there be no tears left to spoil the visual effects, like many I'm welling up with each twist and turn. There is only one word to describe you. SPECIAL Please enjoy your Christmas.... arms reach out across the Atlantic in a virtual hug x
Eres maravillosa, tu musica, tu violín que llega hasta las fibras más íntimas de tus fans, no hacen más que decirte gracias por todo lo que nos das en cada una de tus perfomam..adelante sigue así..bellisima
Amazing!
Pain is beauty!
Amazing! You can tell how much time and effort you put into this video!  Your face says it all,  especially at the end and you can see the feeling of accomplishment in your eyes.  Keep up the good work
You: Are. AMAZING!! I finally got the chance to watch this video and your blog for it and want to tell you that you are an inspiration to not just me, but everyone. THANK YOU for making all these videos showing us your talent and your strife. THANK YOU for being real to us. Just THANK YOU for everything you do. THANK YOU!!
Ліндсі ти супер  класна.
Ліндсі я тебе кохаю.
Just kind of make you wonder. what was going on when they came up with this..."hay I go an idea, why don't we hang Lindsey by her hair and have her play and dance",,,Lindsay  "I'm sorry WHAT"!!
;)
Totally revolutionizing the violinist performance.
That's not even Lindsey...
Lindsey, please don't get hurt doing this type of act.
This is INSANE!!!!
To see this girl go from America's Got Talent to this is an amazing journey. You go, Lindsey!
I really hope no one complains of a bad hair day ever again.  Way to fight through the pain while still putting on a great performance.
id get long hair just to swing like that
You are amazing!!!! 🎉🎉🎉   You are a great woman with an incroyable willpower and you really are an exemple to follow because you put all your heart in your dreams!!! 🎉🎉🎉    Congrats!!!   You are the best!!!   Never forget it.  Kisses from México & Brazil
She is a Goddess incarnate. Truly. Top Dancing and playing the violin, no small feat. How far she has come, it's insane.
Now there will never be a question about feeling the need for Botox. Her skin should be permanently wrinkle free. ( hard work pays off Lady )
You get more and more creative and talented with each year.  This one was spectacular!
The incredible thing is that was a WIG!!!
This was absolutely incredible! You flew!!! I hope this was everything you wanted it to be Lindsey! Keep being awesome! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from Colorado!
This amazing beautiful spirited young lady... Always surprises me with her unlimited talent.. such beauty in this performance...
Thank you so much, you are amazing.
You did so amazing with this!! All those times where you had to take a moment to remind yourself you could do it, all that hard work and perseverance paid off! Now take some time off to breathe and relax! Your health and wellbeing both physically, and emotionally are more important to us than spectacular videos! We love you!
Unbelievablely crazy, dangerous, gustsy. But as usual Lindsey uses ge athletic body make all look so easy.
And it was beyond beautiful.
Hola Lindsey, se que tal vez no entiendas el español. Pero quiero decirte ue en este momento lo que acabas de hacer es crear una hazaña jamás hecha tanto en el mundo como en mis años de vida. El sacrificio valio la pena.No entiendo bien el ingles pero se que te dolió demasiado el hacer ese sacrificio.
Seeing you put yourself through that much pain, I don't believe is going to increase your fan base, at least not in a positive way.  PLEASE do not do that or anything like that again.
This is amazing! To watch the determination this woman put in to this is inspirational and moving! Good for you for sticking to it to make this amazing performance!  Thank you 😀
Incredible performance 🥰
Ouch AF, jeez, awesome show though, wit pain haha
I LOVE YOU LINDSEY, YOU ARE MY HERO
It does look epic and I think if you were ever to go into another talent contest you'd win right off the bat but I watched the previous video as well and that looked like torture. NOT just physically (though that did seem like a component.) but also mentally and emotionally. Seriously that amount of torture you put yourself through was not worth how epic it turned out. While the video was amazing I just kept asking myself if you were ok... There were a couple of times in there I thought you looked tense and part of the reason I watch your videos is that you look like you're having fun doing them.
Love the aerial work.  If it wasn't so difficult/painful I would suggest it might work really well with a green screen  but the format chosen was really awesome too.
Красиво, Линдси. Браво!
Just...wow. have always been impressed. This was awesome. Thank you.
I love your music Keep on playing
Pure  Beauty and power and pure power and beauty leading us into 2021 as she always does and only she can do👍
Great performance! I don’t even have hair and my head hurts
Боже мой! Линдси, ТЫ ЭТО СДЕЛАЛА!! 🙏🙏🙏
That was amazing! Well done ❤️
That is not from home
Its amazing how you work through the pain.  Respect....
That was incredible!!
This blows my MIND!!!
Wow Lindsey, congratulations!!! your performance in this video is absolutely mind-boggling... love the aerial work while you're playing the violin, you reveal more of your seemingly limitless artistry ..you are so talented. Continued success in all you do!!!
Just knowing what you had to go through for this performance makes it impressive.  Beautifully done.
это она таким образом подтяжку лица делает? Чтобы морщины вытянуть?
Magical. I would love to be able to get your concert on DVD.
Big fan. I’ve attended your concerts. Loved this performance. So understand there is no criticism when I ask, why did you choose to do this? I feel like I’ve missed something.
Trop jolie magnifique personne
Beautiful. The determination on your face brought me to tears, again. Thank you, and love you so much
I wish I could like this 100 times absolutely amazing creativity and physical mastery well done
Beautiful song and dance as always, but the hair harness hook thing was really unnecessary
Mesmerizing
you did great, srry it hurt so bad
Wow! That must have taken serious concentration.
hoping you are ok. your performance was flawless and beautiful xx
Wow she never ceases to go higher and better with her creativity!
Absolutely incredible
Love the grace that she has.
vous êtes une artistes accomplis l excellence  et merci pour toute c est  video
This is so so incredible. It is a masterpiece. It is so moving and even more so after watching the vlog.
Hey Lindsey, you did an awesome job and I'm very very proud of you! Sending all my love to you❤️
Lindsey, now repeat the same with a guy.
This is great. Awsome
outstanding !
Wow!... Que espectacular eres💙
I watched the vlog after I watched it, and it made me that much more appreciative of this performance. It was beautiful and it brought tears to my eyes
Nope , Simon said you'd never be interesting 🤣that was the most captivating thing I've seen in ....... forever
i cried at the end because of how impressive this is. she did this in three months and she proved to herself that she could achieve anything she wanted. she is pure talent. a true inspiration.
Ты сумасшедшая я люблю твою музыку , ты лучшая.
INCREIBLEEEE 😍... HAY ALGO QUE E ÉSTA MUJER NO HAGA BIEEEEEN???🤩🤩🤩🤩
those slowmotion scenes are really smooth. 1:12 1:29 are just gold.  She followed her center of gravity perfectly.
Please don't try this at home if you are above the weight of 70 kg or if you have hairfall problems
Ow. But I do find it difficult to believe she is playing at the spin rate showing at 3:00 ... Holding the instrument at ALL is a feat... Still.... Ow.
That was so beautiful, but OML *OUCH!* I get a headache from having my hair in a too tight of a ponytail! 😨
Obviously doing the "Impossible" and dancing while playing the violin was just getting boring...  🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯  Amazing, Spectular performance...  I don't even want to think about how she is going to top this....
Wowwwwwwww, eso fue realmente increible
Дорогая Линдс ! Никогда больше не виси так долго на волосах своих прекрасных ! Иначе облысеешь ! А без волос уже как-то не так приятно будет ! ))))
You did it!!! So proud of you <3
4 МИНУТЫ  - ПОЛЕТ НОРМАЛЬНЫЙ !
That was so beautiful and moving, it brought tears to my eyes! I know you were in pain but you're such a talented human being that you overcame for us and I thank you!  ❤️❤️❤️
Pain was continually in her face, not the joy of her music. Too talented for parlor tricks. Needless stunt. She's far better than this.
True talent.
Thank you for doing the hard things, Lindsey.  We can do this!  You are an inspiration and your talent is a blessing that God uses for the betterment of all!  You go girl!!
Truely AMAZING Lindsey, I bet your bow technique and everything must have been so much more difficult to perform with the hair hanging, I am thoroughly impressed, as are so many others I'm sure.
HANDS DOWN!!!! you truly are a godess amongst musicians truly STRONG and AWSOME!!!! STRONGEST i ever seen.. <3
Incredible...
Queen of violins LINDEY STIRLING
Cool
Sorry dear, but dont do that to you. Its amazing yes, but i felt the pain with you. Please no pain, bring yourself and us joy. Hugs you tightly. :( ♥
супер
Мечта балерины просто не когда не угаснит
Incroyable performance,  encore plus quand on connaît la galère de l'entraînement... chapeau madame 🤩👏
you did it! great job. beautiful performance
Thank you for going the very extra mile to give us your best! You are much loved! And your fans are so proud of you! We love you!
She is now over 6ft tall.
I know you won't replay but I'm striving to be a great violinist and your my biggest inspection!! I'm only 12 at the moment and I'm still working on my stuff but i hope to be like you one day! ^^ also i hope your not in too much pain. that looks painful
Beautiful
I wanna know why....
Wow, perfect, beautiful ❤️❤️😍
Lot of work, A lot of pain, You are amazing, Dream big <3
This made me cry. You are truly amazing.
uff...i hope this was worth it for you...
It was well worth the effort and sacrifice. It was spectacular. My neck and hair still hurt me just seeing it.
This is the first song I discovered her from and god how I missed it.
What kind of shampoo does she use? I could use a bottle or 10
I love it! So typical of Lindsey always pushing to the limit and beyond. 💖
With this passage it say, With my eyes I see and feel, with my eyes I know the harrows of pain. And with my eyes they can bring one peace. Thank you Lindsey for bring this to us. But please, please do not do this again. I hope you have found your innermost  peace and tranquility. And may you have a super holiday  with you and your family.
Is there anything this woman can't do? This is absolutely incredible!
Wow, you like challenges!! Congratulations, that was sooo beautiful!!
Dropped my jaw! Lindsey, you are wonderful and full of incredible experiments!
Miley Cyrus came in "like" a wrecking ball, but Lindsey Stirling IS the freakin wrecking ball
This is wonderful! Lindsay, YOU are wonderful! Crystallize is one of the first songs I heard from you and still my favorite, I am blessed to see you grow so much. 🤗 thank you for your effort for making this video and take care of yourself ❤️
Made my head hurt lol beautiful ty
I cannot imagine what it took to be able to do that and play flawlessly....BRAVO...thank you.
After watching how much pain you were in to prepare for this. I just wanna say it was amazing and beautiful.
Danke. Ein wunderschöner Augenblick mit viel Können!
Lindsey, you are so strong! That was really good.
Screams in traction alopecia
A one-woman Cirque du Soleil !!
UAU! BRAVO!!!
Lindsay! Remember that you are a person, not a toy! I'm upset
Lindsey made an attainable and measurable goal. The reasons that she chose this particular goal are hers and hers alone. I am very happy that she did :).  I hope that she inspires more people to set goals and see them through even though it can be mentally and physically painful. "No pain, No gain." Also I heard somewhere that no one ever got an award for being "normal." Many thanks to Lindsey and everyone else who helped make this happen.
Волшебно !!! Ты супер !!! Каждый клип это чудо !!! Так держать !!! Удивляй всех дальше !!! Magical !!! You're super !!! Every clip is a miracle !!! Keep it up !!! Surprise everyone further !!!
I think that many people forget that there are more than one type of strong, when really there are three: Strong - physically Strong - mentally Strong - keeps going, unstoppable, let’s no one win without you trying to stop them, knows which are strengths and weaknesses...... Lindsey Stirling is all three
Beautiful
All I can think of is... That is one healthy scalp.
hermosooo
Bravo
One of the most fabulous things I have ever seen ❤️
One of the most incredible amazing things I have seen.  Pure magic ❤️❤️❣️
Like a fairy dancing on hope 👼👼👼🙆🙆🙆
Мать, ты че творишь-то?!!! Пожалей себя! Но!!! - Это бесподобно, безусловно! Ты  и так шикарна в исполнении, но этот экстрим- вообще за гранью!!!
Outstanding, Lindsey 👏
is soo amizing and cool
Wow!
Love You, BUT DON'T DO IT AGAIN!!! PLEASE!!!
this gimmick has to end now! its time to do something different. I like crystalise but you are getting too old now and its getting boring
Congratulations, your hard work paid off.
Lindsey, you incredible human Being!!!
is it just me or is this video getting slept on?? this deserves way more views than it has rn!!
Ow That all i can Sayn her Pool head
You're awesome, Lindsey! 🥺👏👏👏
Literally almost cried watching this after seeing your vlogs about it
truly amazing it is nice to see you blood sweat and tears paying off so well
Maybe we could hang Piers Morgan up by his hair. Give him a triangle to play. And then just spin him round and leave him there.
😘😘🤗🤗
Me and my mom love your songs
is this like a conditioner commercial?
It really looks painful, but she pulled the show forward magnificently.
You are a very strong and talented person. I wish you nothing but success. You're a great motivator
You did it!!! You're amazing!
A freaking amazing! You go girl!
Can't respect you enough for all your amazing effort and talent and love for us all, Lindsey. Literally crying over here. Thanks for everything. Love you always.
Wow... >O.O< You can tick that one off the bucket list! Beautifully done, lass.  But remember something, we loved you in the original when it was Uggs, a hood and a really big ice sculpture... PLEASE don't so yourself damage just for our amusement. We're not that kind of people!  Well... The spikey bushes Vs Sandals outtakes were kinda funny... *[Practiced Innocence]* BUT NO MORE THAN THAT! >O.O<
Absolutely breathtaking Lindsey!!! You truly are a one of a kind artist. There will never be anyone like you!!!! :)
iubeste vioara . imi place ceea ce face
OOOOOOOWWWWWWIIIEEEEEEE!!!!!! T^T
A beautiful snowflake...I can't imagine the amount of strength and concentration that took. Incredible!
Absolutely gorgeous performance- now please don't hurt yourself like that again, even for your fans <3
Congratulations! You are absolutely amazing, it's great how you never gave up! I hated see you crying ☹️ but I love more! Now, please take care of yourself, love from Mexico.
Wow... bless you sweetheart!!! I truly adore you as a mom and woman... You inspire me. I am proud of you. Know you are strong, enough, dynamic, beautiful, an overcome
El violín y el valet no se pueden juntar, es imposible Lo imposible:           Te admiro Lindsey <3
Bravo!!!!
This is awesome, you worked si hard for this, congrats !
This music is Wonderfull
MARAVILHOSO ❤️
Amazing
Capricorn Reading For All Zodiac Signs https://youtu.be/LfYuuFwlcvk
Absolutely incredible. What an inspiration to work hard at something, and have it come together so (seemingly) flawlessly! So many will never know the pain and effort that went into this performance, and that is a marvelous thing! Thanks for your constant transformative work!
I'm so bad at focusing I'm sitting at work watching this.  She's so focused she can dance while suspended from her hair and play the violin perfectly.
Oh my speechless but such beauty.
U did it!!!!!!
you are a very strong girl, love you..
Wow impressive perfrmence
You are truly amazing!
That's probably the most amazing thing I have seen from you yet !!  Truly stunning !!  All that hard work really paid off :) !!!
I’m in tears watching this ! After seeing the pain and the mind strength you went through.. beautiful video, beautiful strength, beautiful accomplishment !! ❤️❤️❤️
that's cool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUbElKy42yE
which shampoo do you use Lindsey?
Stunning commitment to a goal she decided she wanted to achieve. But for me it doesn’t feel like a Lindsey Stirling video. I love how she tries new/different things to see if they fit with how she presents her music and self to the world. I understand she has mentioned ‘never again’ for this particular skill/trick/dance discipline and I’m glad because I feel like the resolve you can see on her face to complete some of the moves completely removes the joy I associate with her performances from the video.
no words...only goosebumps!
Клево, только зачем?
I’ve enjoyed watching you and your talents grow over the past few years. But this performance beautiful soul,took those skills to a whole other level,this was absolutely amazing💜I look forward to the day when the whole world knows who are. Stay blessed up sunshine✝️💜
extraordinaire. Bravo, quel courage, quelle performance
Lindsey, we love and support you trying to do cool stuff like this, but you don't need to subject yourself to pain like this. Especially seeing the vlog on it. We don't want to see you grimace through your beautiful songs.
The look of sheer determination on her face throughout this performance is one of the most beautiful things I've seen this year. Thank you for this.
Absolutely AMAZING!!!! Your talent surpasses all!!!
Wahnsinn, super klasse😃
Weird, but by no means any less impressive, beautiful or enjoyable as previous works.  Kudos!
Don't try this at home folks ... one wrong move and she could snap her neck!
Wow. Craziness. I’m sure she was sooo glad to be done with this but what a journey! Beautiful and inspiring. I almost wish she had on a pair of wings!
Wonderful. Performance art made with passion. It really shows.
I was on the verge of crying watching the pain in your face, it was very beautiful. I didn't like the parts were you can tell it was not you playing they should've stop the music I guess to make it more real, more you...
Legendary
Será q sou a única br vendo esse vídeo?
Has everyone worshiped our Queen today?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I love that you did what you where told you couldnt do on Americans got talent. Thank u for blessing us with such a blissful performance 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👫👏👫
Absolutely Breathtaking.. You have such grace and beauty and I LOVE listening to your music..
Wow, wow, wow, you outdo yourself every time!! 👏👏👏👏⭐️⭐️⭐️💛💛
AWESOME! <3
Fabulous!!!
If you've seen her vlogs you'd know how painful that performance was. You can literally see her grimacing throughout her video. Kudos for her to keep believing in doing it even though it's excruciating.  Kudos to you Lindsey Stirling. Kudos to you.
👍🖤🖤🖤🐺👍Wunderschön
This is mesmerising, Lindsey. Fantastically well done.
She went a long way from breaking pots dressed as Link - https://youtu.be/dXmMQJMFL_I   She's the best!
I know she said she won’t, but could you imagine if she kept doing it? That would be incredible, especially since everyone who’s done this before says it gets easier as time goes on.
WOW YOU ARE JUST WOW! BEAUTIFUL!
Estoy muy impresionada a lo que has llegado. Maravilloso video con  toda tu esencia ❤️. Feliz Navidad 🌲🌟
God it must be soooo painful... She is amazing for pulling this off !
that's INSANE
WoW. Very very impressive
You are impressive, truly impressive
Bravo Lindsay!!! You're Amazing!!! I wish You all a Happy and Bright Christmas!
You are beautiful
Wow. That is incredible. Amazing commitment.
I saw a brief clip where Lindsey was prepping for this performance. Knowing how much pain she endured for this brought tears to my eyes when I got to see it all come together.
You are absolutely incredible! 😭🥰💜🔥🔥🔥🔥
She is amazing
Lindsey idk if you'll see this but your videos always bring me to tears with how beautiful you, your music and videos are.... Please keep it up! Thank you for all your hard work!
TwoSetVio kindly comment on this.
Woow! Like a real angel 😍😍this the best clip you ever made😍congratulations! 👏
It’s a good thing Crystallize is all muscle memory for you, because the amount of concentration you needed for the choreography is intense!!!!! And that is the most amazing violin I’ve ever seen in my life. Well done, you incredibly talented girl!!!
imho this whole new hanging by the hair thing is totally dumb, adds nothing and actually looks really bad in comparison to just dancing, not to mention the vertigo you get just by looking at it. i understand the need to make new stuff after a few years but to me this just ruins things completely, and a little news flash - its playing violin, it can only go so far as to the things you can be doing while you play it. so really no need for more "bazzaz" or whatever u call it...
This extremely painful to watch.  Looks like it hurts bad and hurts my soul to watch.
amazing waaah! defying gravity. wow
Look at you  SOAR! I knew the first time I saw one of your videos.. you would reach the greatest heights!! I am so happy your out here rocking it! Super pumped to see what else you have in store for us! I can't imagine how difficult this was, but its breathtaking to watch. Reach for the stars Lindsey, I have NO DOUBT you'll touch them, your already among them..
great violinist, pretty to boot. but why is there always a gimmick (this time being a hair hanged Christmas tree ornament)?
All I can say is wow Lindsey Stirling is such a talented artist
Lindsey, thank you for your wonderful creations. I'm simple russian dude from Siberia, but my heart melts from your music. I have been your fan since 2012, and love you so much. You make me better, because i live with your violin's songs. You're beautiful
Wow. The discipline and determination necessary to do this is phenomenal!
凄いよ…。ずっとこれからも日本から応援してます。あなたの音楽やダンスが大好きです！！
What a strange and awesome performance.
The determination, concentration, perseverance, and self-control you have Lindsey is so powerfully beautiful and inspiring. WOW is the only word I could come up with the first time I watched this. You are an amazing artist in all you set your mind to. Thank you for the beautiful music you make and all you put yourself through to achieve the truly amazing videos.
Tell Pierre Morgan to shove his opinion.
Hi ma'am hard work keeps moving, unimaginable thank you ma'am
I'm already in love with that sound, and now I fell in love with it even more, Lindsey surprises me more and more every day, that's why I'm in love with it, I'm here with my mouth open, very good.👏👏👏
Oh, my dear Lindsey, you don't need to suffer that much. Dont need to pull your hair. We always love your performance anyway 😊
*elle ne s'arrête jamais*
Nice Performance
Very good)) thank you.
Кот: шатает ёлку Ёлочные шарики:
HOOOOWWW im in utter awe how is this even possible shes a goddess or something
Te amamos Lindsey eres arte y siempre nos maravillas con algo nuevo 😊💜💙🎼🎻 Saludos desde Ecuador
Maravilloso 😍
EPIC!!!  Better than that... Performance of the Year!!!
bravo t'es trop forte
Única en todo el mundo!!! Genia total incomparable!🤩😘
Impossible, just amazing
I can’t beleive she made it through that, she is so strong (mentally and physically)
Does...anyone else think the 'publicity stunt' thing is starting to get WEIRD?
Loves from india 👏👏❤❤❤❤❤
She's literally taking music and dancing to new heights. She's simply amazing and incredible
beautiful video but you can see the pain she's in looking at her face. Sh'e strong
When you are so talented that even your hair is talented:
Uaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuu sem palavras! Que apresentação ÉPICA!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Of course, this is not useful for hair, but what about the spine and neck muscles, I can't even imagine....
Show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Очень крута и сильна не только телом, но и духом. Ещё одно доказательство того, что сила есть в каждом, но не каждый готов этой силой воспользоваться. From Russia with love!!!
HOW I LOVE YOU LINDSEY
This was the most amazing and beautiful video I've ever seen. You're so inspirational! Thank you and God bless you <3
I'm torn on this. Yes, it was amazing. Everyone can see that. You are a WORLD treasure. You should not take these physical risks. To see the pain and discomfort you endured to give us this performance, saddened me. Gone was what I liked most in you, the joy & fluent ease that you perform with. I can't watch you suffer and enjoy your videos. I just can't. No one does what you do in music. You are the best.  Your time with us will be short enough. Please don't do anything to RISK reducing it. There are tons of social, political, racial, religious, & medical issues you could influence greatly with even more shock value. None of which would injure you physically. Remember, you are a WORLD treasure. See yourself that way and do what you are gifted to do. Please....no more risks like these. Painful to see.
#piersmorgan, eat your heart out lol!!!  "You're not untalented, but you're not good enough, I don't think, to get away with flying through the air and trying to play the violin at the same time." - Piers Morgan, America's Got Talent.  Good thing she never listened to him back then. She is so inspirational and unique!
That was awesome thank you 🙏
Me sorprende cómo puede hacer tremendos movimientos y aún asi tocar perfectamente el violín, la admiro, de verdad. Es una gran artista ♡♡♡♡♡
This is so amazing...❤️❤️
I wonder how many hours of rehearsal it took to grace us with this show, and delight us with its giant talent. Gratitude
Спасибо за прекрасное видео! Как всегда великолепно! Ты проделала огромную работу, и она того стоила! Еще раз спасибо!
Невероятно красиво и сильно
Who’s here from tiktok? Ahhaha
amazing
This is absolutely insane! Lindsey you surprised me a lot! 😍 this is impossible yet here you are
Impossible And possible  is in our hearts. You proved it And I Hope that you will achive in your live whatever you dream off. Thank you so much for everything you do. You are a big inspiration for my daughter. I belive you make her better each day.
Absolutely Brilliant... Grand Salute to you Lindsey and your training team...!!!
Simplemente espléndido cuando pienso que lo e visto todo sobre ti, nos sorprendes cada vez más gracias por compartir tu arte con nosotros .. 👏👏👏👏👏👏
This...this..Amazing
America’s got talent judges: you aren’t good enough to play violin and dance mid air  Lindsey: hold my hair 💁🏼‍♀️

Wow
Аххх...какое удивительное представление! Мой восторг не выразить словами (цензурными)! Лучшая - просто лучшая!
wow that is amazing !
I like the performance, but it is just a bit much for me personally. I love it just when your bouncing around with that big beautiful smile
Angels dance like that.
That was so impressive..i love every new idea you have but why do you something that hurts you so much? Everything you do, you do with passion and now you are scared and have tears in your eyes. Please be careful about yourself we love you ❤️
... Why
Lindsey.........We KNEW you could do it!!  Thank you for pushing through the anxiety and the pain, in order for us, to witness a SPECTACULAR performance.  WELL DONE!!  We LOVE YOU Honey!!! Tammy Lynn Schulz. ❤👍👏👏
This is amazing! You are crazy to go in such challenge... but you did it! thx
You are an amazing woman and big inspiration. I almost cried watching this video
никогда еще не видел такого сосредоточенного лица! смотрел видео подготовки.  Но это красиво! Вы молодец.
Woooow! Beautiful, amazing 🤩
Necessário isso?
You could see her preparing for her hair taking her full body weight :( Still an amazing performance, as always. <3
This is very nice, but please don't hurt yourself like this anymore :)
stop elevating your art, we can't hear you from up there
Obstination et persévérance , magnifique prestation ! J'adore !
Feels like crystallize is again a new song 😭😇❤❤🙏 AWSOME
I watched Lindsay's preparation, how hard it was for her, how she cried, I cried with her. Lindsay, you're a great. It hurt me every minute when you were flying in the air with a violin, but at the same time, it was a very beautiful performance, you were not trying in vain.
Wonderful tkx👏👏👏
This is likely one of her most impressive performances. Especially if you look at the training she went through and difficult time she had learning to do this, only to finally pray about it, and find herself having the strength to pull this off. I know that God helped her to do this, and Lindsey continues to be an inspiration. :)
this looks super fun to make..
Never listen to someone when they tell you you are not egnough.  This was beautiful. Im glad I got see you in person in jacksonville when you did the evanescence tour, and happy to continue watching your journey :) keep being awesome!
Neat I suppose. Just don't see why you're doing this with your hair. Hope to never see you have to do this again.
Я даже похлопал.
Ok, et en son direct ça donne quoi pour voir ?
Simply incredible in every aspect and on every level. The talent and determination you must have, the effort you need to put in, the pain you have to endure... I'm humbled. Also, are there any circumstances where Lindsey Stirling doesn't look graceful and stunningly beautiful? Haven't seen it yet...  Lindsey, on the minuscule chance you're ever reading this: you're an amazing person, beautiful inside and outside.  As much as we appreciate the art you bring us, nobody would wish you to suffer for it. There's already too much pain in this world so please don't put yourself through more of it.  May you and your loved ones be healthy, safe and happy.
Love it 🥰 you did amazing like always☺️
Doesn’t it hurt to be carried by your hair!?
WOW!!! and weird.
Are you crazy?  lovely crazy
I'm impressed but I dunno what is drawing my attention more the violin performance or her swing around by her hair
Линдси ты прекрасная!
Major hair anxiety watching this. I mean, so much love for this tune, but Oh wow that hair harness 😱
Wow! Always finding new ways to amaze.... What a talent and a beauty!
Hopefully this was a one take lol
the hair hanging godAMN
Amazing performance 😍 you are such a great artist
Oh wow! I was moved to tears... this is so touching! I already loved this song but with this performance...😥🙏🏻🤗
Maybe she wont read this... But i love your strong and i love this video... Amazing video and amazing Lindsay
дуже круто UA
Lindsey is the best 😍
Lindsey: with all the forms of beauty you’re capable of materializing, you’re an astounding manifestation of Heaven! Your mission continues, you make the entire Church proud!
Lindsey has been through so much and Piers Morgan should be eating his words! THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!
It was beautiful 😍
That was impressive dedication to your craft
Unbelievable and a little hard to watch
Призываю русских
Muhteşem...
.....Ow. I mean, I know that from a strictly materials standpoint your hair is better suited to the task than your arms, but OW. I have never had hair long enough to do something that would hurt like that, and my hair hurts watching that. Let no one say Lindsey Stirling doesn't go the frickin' distance.
Wait what?? The hair thing, i gotta try this.
Increible wow
Lindsey this is absolutely remarkable! Game changing.  Babecicle ;)
That was really awesome, but it made my head hurt just watching! One thing is for sure, no one's going to question her dedication to her art. Wow!
First thing that comes to my mind - the dubstep version of this song she made yrs ago. Awesome tune
The Dedication to herself first for being so strong, and the dedication to her fans for such an amazing performance. She deserves Everything coming her way.
Really stunning performance. I hope your neck is okay...
I love the final breathing, it brings her back to human ❤ congrats, Lindsey, your performances are beyond amazing!
Einfach Wahnsinn Großartig Ich bewundere dich
You practice this exercise every day for 1month and you go bald.....!!!
She needed more time to build up the muscles in her neck and desensitize the nerves in her scalp. Eventually, hair suspension artists don’t feel the pain and discomfort from it but it can take up to a year for some people to reach that point
She looks like a little elf fairy.
This is so beautiful and the efforts behind it all.  You know your pain was worth it when you make a masterpiece like this  But I hope you don’t go through that pain again, the existence of this is enough.
imagine finding Lindsey from a DevinSuperTramp video, obsessing over her videos, then she collabs with iJustine, goes on a world tour, and then makes me cry- you. makes you cry, i’m not crying. oh no.
How is this NOT simply majestic?
That look of pain on Lindsey's face... Oof...
This is absolutely incredible. The hair hanging vlog brought me to tears. The beauty of persevering through the pain...
one of the most beautiful perfomances i have ever seen
Up next her playing while laying on a nail bed. . . God I hope she doesn't Actually do that... I cried just by watching this.
Some hair conditioner company would have liked to sponsor this one.
Now she has to shave a whole hair off, and go bald! Strange performance, awesome song though! I love Lindsey
I couldn't help but cry to this, so talented and beautiful 🥲💙
wow, just WOW
I wonder how AGT would have judged this one.  So when I watched your last (previous?) video, you were beginning to learn this suspension gig... and this must be what you had in mind?  Yeah, AGT, this girl can NEVER stop moving!  Very beautiful.  Now your unforgettable music videos are at my cranial limit I'm afraid.  I think I need to discard AGT memories of you to provide more room!  (silly comment I know, but I really thought you would win it that season).  Lindsey, you are stunning.  By the way, AGT complained once that she 'moved too much'.  Well, what do you think now?
Legend!
У меня просто нет слов! Это было великолепно!!! Это неимоверно чудесно и прекрасно!!!
💓😔😭😭💓💓 Amo su trabajo y determinación, es una campeona.
Удивительно, Линдси!
WOOOOOOOW 😍😍😍😍😍
I've heard of suffering for your art but that looks like torture. You were magnificent in your performance though. So beautiful!
Lindsey, your work is amazing, the dedication you put into it is admirable. Very beautiful what you have achieved, but dear Lindsey, as a fan I tell you that this is not necessary, knowing what you had to go through is inspiring but at the same time it is ridiculous to hurt yourself like that. We love you well, take good care of yourself, thank you for this beautiful work but please don't do it again, it hurts to see you suffer, God bless you.
That look of shear determination, Lindsey, you've grown in talent. Have a Merry Christmas, and may your new year be fantastic.
Congratulations You are amazing « Bravo »
❤️😊👍🏼💕
I'm proud that you could do it because I probably couldn't but I see it hurts a lot 8n8, get some good rest for ya head Lindsey ya deserve it!!
Greetings you fabulous Earthlings and Happy Tuesday!! 👋👽I bring Covid-free thin crust pizza to all you friendly Earthlings 🍕Don't mind me, just cruising by:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::>>>🛸
Lindsay, thank you for posting this performance. This was the most stunning piece in the holiday special, made only more breathtaking to watch after we followed you through the torture you endured to train for it. Your courage and determination is a blazing inferno in the dark.
Wow you never disappoint me in your videos are beautiful good job
I can barely play my instruments without goofing up. Here's Lindsey dancing and hanging by hair! Truly amazing!!
Absolutely amazing as always!! 😍🥰🤗
Hermosa!😍
And that's how your prove them wrong! 👏 👏 👏 👏  They say no You say "WATCH ME"  👏 👏 👏 👏
ฉันเป็นหนึ่งในคนไทยที่ติดตามผลงานคุณขอเป็นกำลังใจให้คุณทำผลงานดีๆต่อไปนะคะ และขอให้อาการเจ็บที่หัวหายเร็วๆนะ
The hard work brought us a beautiful piece of art. I’m sorry it caused you pain, and it was truly a stunning piece of work.
That looks like it hurts! So proud of you!!!
This was incredible.  How does Lindsey outdo herself?!
Wow! Chills!! The talent and dedication! I’m blown away!
Lindsey has such talent, but this was uncomfortable for me to watch. I would like to think there are better ways to showcase her ever-advancing brilliance without such stunts. Even though I knew she wasn't going to come to harm, the images kept me in fear.
It was very impressive & the look of concentration on her face & the blog that leads onto this is inspiring but I get much more joy out of Lindsey's music when she's smiling (her smiles so infectious) & enjoying what she's doing. Kudos to sticking with & completing something so difficult & different but I'm super looking forward to the next one where she's happy while doing it
Линдси, это было очень красиво) Твои труды не прошли зря.
That was beautiful. Beautiful enough to be worth all the pain and fear she had to go through.... Probably not. We love you Lindsay, and your dancing is just as good. Please don't torture yourself for this.
Her emotions definitely contributed to the music, agt doesn't deserve to be credited but lemme just say... Without agt she wouldn't have what aang from the legend of avatar said... It's when we reach our lowest where we become better
Yo: sufriendo por mi poco cabello😰 Ella : se lo quiere arrancar todo de a jalón😂
Eres maravillosa mi linsey almiro lo que ases saludos desde hermosillo sonora
when I think of the training she been through to do this video but it's beautiful.
YOU ARE INCREDIBLE!!!!!! SUCH AN INSPIRATION!!!!!!
I can't even imagine playing the violin while spinning that fast
Amazing! Unbelievable! Восхитительно и невероятно! Я не поверил своим глазам! Lindsey, you are awesome!
Wow, ❤
“I think you may not be good enough to get away with flying in the air and trying to play the violin Also Lindsey:
Quite impressive.  I love your music.
Tremendo!!! 👏
I love this song, but it is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE for her to be doing that with her hair. It would be falling out of whatever updo it's in, and she'd at least be grimacing. There has to be something more to this.... is there harness I can't see?
America does have talent 🙂
This is mind blowing and amazing you are seriously an inspiration to any violinist out there including myself
Hermosoooooo🇨🇷🎆🎇✨🎈🎉Saludos desde C.R**😙👍👏
Should do a video with Brian Joseph king
Cirque du Soleil called, they want you in their first act! God you're fantastic!
Lindsay for you to do the hanging hair routine from Cirque Du Soleil while playing a violin. Bravo....to you
Who’s here from TikTok
Whoa
Amazing
Bravo!
This was AMAZING
You're  father would  be so proud of you. He watching u and saying  that my girl
I truly appreciate your dedication to your art, your violin skill is inspiring and your performance was beautiful to watch, but please do me a favor...do not test the strength of your scalp and hair like this again.
For comparison, her competition walks onto stage and merely moves their mouth to a prerecorded version of their own song... This young lady is on a different level, on a different planet, than other "musicians" her age.
fierce bravery in the mist of fear and anxiety, you rocked it!!  Merry Christmas and continued blessings to you!
Wow, what conditioner do you use?! Just wow!
💜🔥💜🔥💜
This is the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen. And after watching your TikTok about how hard this was for you to do.. just. Wow.
Maravillosa como siempre.
You worked so hard and you did great I’m so proud of what u have accomplished and done in your life have been with you since the beginning and you are so outstanding
How do I learn to do this?? It's beautiful!
Just ... WOW!
Acıyı hissedebiliyorum. Lütfen bunu yapma!
Amazing performance. But, people's necks have broken for less. Must be some sort of harness.
Oh wow that is amazing how your doing this by your hair. Your awesome and I enjoy every music videos you have made and come out with.
Real powhair . Great show !
Artist of the highest caliber
Bet Piers feels so silly now for what he said about her. Look at her go!
Really Lindsey? The world has no words to describe this amazing perfomance. Only leave is enjoy it again and again. God bless You always
The focus, the power, it's jaw dropping, it's awesome, it's inspiring.
thank you for pushing yourself as an artist & as an inspiration
Just so breathtaking and so much talent. You are brave, beautiful, and strong Lindsey!
😭😱😍 so great, so beautiful. You are amazing 😘
Wow!!!  Beautiful video... hope she was not hurting.
One thing is for sure - she ended the performance temporarily taller than when she started!
Mała, jesteś wielka !🙏
Delightfully beautiful!
Suffer for your art doesn't mean physical pain but rather metal and monetary suffrage.  Please don't do anymore hair hanging.  It's too painful to watch and I'm sure it's horrifically painful to you as well to do the hanging.  I'm glad you met your goal of doing this video but don't put yourself in pain to entertain us fans.
Honestly it was so hard to watch this, everything is beautiful but you hanging by the hair just seems way too painful. 😰
Wow! You were smart to stick it out.
Girl you are nuts! Hanging by YOUR HAIR!? Crazy performance and extremely impressive, but please don't put yourself in pain just to impress us 💕 we love you no matter what
OWWWWWWW when she started swinging around d-does that? hurt
I was ASTONISHED when she did her DWTS Final Routine *Which she SHOULD HAVE WON!!!!* and then I see this and it has absolutely blown my brain.  It's absolutely beautiful.
All I could think of was “OUCH!” and “oh my goodness this is so beautiful!”
Beautiful!..  and now I understand the hair-hanging video (which I mistakenly saw first).
Sister, I seriously question the integrity of your people for not intervening on this project.   Has the industry learned nothing about the responsibility to protect artists?  Did we learn anything from Karen Carpenter or Michael Jackson?  Sister, your creativity is on par with anyone in the industry. Your work sometimes leaves me crying because of your effectiveness at communicating an emotion. Isn’t that what qualifies you as one of the greatest entertainers?
IT LOOKS SO DANGEROUS !
Simply amazing. I’m awestruck
There's way too many cuts in this. We don't get to appreciate the grace of the dance.
Me encanta lo que haces. Love what u do. Keep doing that
Te admiro mucho
Wonderful ❤️❤️
Oh my goodness 😮😍😍 dose she  have  pain in head after this
You are amazing,a bit crazy,I hope that did not hurt to much,good work Lyndsey.
Absolutely spectacular. She is incredible.   However, as someone struggling to come to grips with male pattern baldness, it just seems so risky long term.
happy holidays everyone !!! thanks Lindsey!!!
Amazing Accomplishment proud of you!
Beautiful. Thank you. :)
Lindsey , Lindsey, Lindsey, great performance without a doubt! But i can only agree with most of the other people , why? Was it really worth it?
Lindsey this is legit my favorite song of yours. And to see you so formed and rigid not being able to flow like you normally do was so hard 😅 and I could feel it thru you. You moved me to tears love you ❤️
OKSSSSS
Супер! Несколько раз уже посмотрели с дочкой)))) И композицию эту часто слушаем дома. После просмотра этого видео еще в авто с собой взяли послушать)))
With this began Aquarius Era...thanks
Now get your awesomeness on the masked singer
One of the most beautiful things I have ever seen goosebumps & tears!!
good job Lindsey is must be painful, your the best music maker i now but I wasn't able to go sorry #sad face ):  thumbs is you agree okay
Ok, i'm dizzy and my head hurts. Well done
I'm a follower since you started uploading dubstep violin music and watch this today make me feel so proud of you. For a moment, I was that fascinated 14yo again, without problems, without any concerns, with the only need of enjoying your art.   Thank you and all my greetings form Spain.
That face before she jumps through the chorus is the face is bravery and perseverance and passion!!! 💛💛💛💛
Que apresentação perfeitaaaaaaaaaa ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
There are so many points on the head ! This is so intense ! I'm infatuated ! Excellent as always !
Amazing! Lindsey you did a fantastic job! Soo proud of you!!! You are such an inspiration!!! <3
Utterly amazing and entrancing!  The freedom of motion that hanging from her hair gives Lindsey is incredible, allowing her to add a new level of artistry and dance to her performance.  However, I noted that she maintained a deadpan expression throughout the performance; I suspect she was (successfully) doing her best not to let the pain in her scalp show.  Bravo, Ms. Stirling, bravo!  It was, as I say, both amazing and entrancing to watch.
So glad I am able to see the hair hanging! I am so proud of you! Now you need a day or at the spa! You're the best!!!
I prefer your early music. Your dance has always been secondary and not all that important to my experience. This dance was self flagellation and didn't add to the tremendous art that was in the music. No thumbs up on this one. You and your music are true art by themselves.
Beautiful!
Nicely done but way too risky. Why risk your health and safety for this?
Should try next with hooks in skin, next level of feeling and adrenaline.
Brilliant! Beautiful! Bold!
Ничего прекраснее я ещё не видела. Потрясающее сочетание силы и изящества.
Can't possibly be playing while doing this. So whatevs 🤪
I never expected Lindsey Stirling to announce she was into bondage so publicly
Yoooooooo~ That was legitness!!
don't ever do anything like that again
oh i couldn't watch...don't like heights , and just...ouch!
I absolutely love you and your confidence ❤  so proud of you 👏!!! Very tough what you went through and you hit like it was nothing!!! Love your music and everything you do. Absolutely a amazing soul!!!
Браво! Молодец! Умничка! Love you!
Perfect
You did it!!  And it was AMAZING!  With all the pain and struggle we saw you going through in the last video I did not expect it to come out so good.  You are one determined person!  Congratulations!
There was a disrespectful video of an guy calling lindsey out for her comments bout the womans march, his comments were like, "maybe you dont see the problems people face when u are a rich white woman"  I was shocked by this, clearly he dont even knows how she got told, she isnt good enough and made everything on her own+  worked so hard, even as a kid!  seeing this video just shows how hard she works for us and brings herself in danger, just to bring us this masterpiece of content!
I couldn't go to your presentation in Colombia due to the pandemic, but still you are still my greatest admiration in music and artistically in your spontaneous expression.
Stunning choreography, so much talent, I’m jealous, truly beautiful ❤️😊❤️
Seriously amazing!
lovely ❤️
Bravo Ms. Lindsey Stirling!
Why?
but why
Absolutely amazing!
I love how raw and real this is. We need more artists showing this side of performance
👌😍🥰🙏thank you for sharing.
YES!!! You did it!!!! Congratulations! Another test conquered by you! I'm so proud of you, of being your fan! God bless you!
Hi you where not you're  bubbly and funny self u look so said
Beautiful but this is beyond what you should endure to provide us with amazing entertainment. No more hair-hanging.
Wow, just wow. So amazing
Simplemente hermoso y mágico! 😍
ARRASOU🌹🌹🌹
Talk about some insane follow through 😭😭♥️ inspiring
So beautiful Lindsey, so brave even through the pain. God Bless you.
THAT'S INSANE!! you're soooooo innovative! Absolutely amazing! But doesn't that leave a headache!? O.o
❤️‼️
2050: Lindsey Stirling plays violin spinning inside the space station that will be spinning too.
Crystallize puts tears in your eyes but this brings an ocean
I knew you are great, its not necesary the pain 😍😍😍😍be careful  God bless you
This is amazing, now please never do it again.
Mesmerising and truly inspiring!
You're fighter, always has been one always will be one.. Well done young lady,. Onto the next challenge.
Sin palabras...
I’m proud of you! You stayed in the fight and overcame!
Espetacular, parabéns.
Sooooo! Some girls like having their hair pulled ? 🤔 j/k awesome performance Merry Christmas 🎅
Sos lo más!!!!!!!
nice playback
This song was the first time I heard Lindsey all those years ago. Each song keeps getting better and better, but this will always have a special place as it introduced me to a master. Amazing performance and thank you!
What I have found beautiful with you, your music and just you have brought listeners to listening to a violin, in this century. That is when you know your on top. Your listeners will continue to grow. Your a delight to hear.
I only can say something...AMAZING! I almost cried <3
I'am speechless..... Don't know what to say.. ❤️🖤❤️🖤
That was insane!!
The freedom of floating in the air beautiful, if that is painful then just don’t do. K
It's awesome and gorgeous!  That example lifted me up and gave me the strength to move on.  Thank you and God bless you!
I'm so conflicted about this video. I'm so incredibly proud of Lindsey for accomplishing what she set out to and her routine was stunning, but my heart was breaking for her seeing how much pain she was in leading up to and during the performance.
You need to fire your audio engineer. The crackling in this was absolutely AWFUL!!
Me: Can you imagine someone hanging by their hair, swinging across a room while still dancing AND playing the violin so well at the same time?  Lindsey: Challenge accepted
I’m sure we had all seen the process in the beginning. That alone just killed me watching her. Poor Lindsey, just the pain she went through. Was killing me .
You never stop surprising us. Amazing.
You have always been a great dancer and violinist and I love your music and videos. This video though I couldn't fully enjoy because of all the pain you went through to do it. Please don't go through something like that again ❤❤
Oh Lindsey, Oh Lindsey, I just know how much you have trained and suffered do this, but it is amazing, it is beautiful, it is sensational it is? Lindsey Stirling and we love you x
OUTSTANDING performance, you take suffering for your art to a whole new level
The things you do for us, Lindsey... =) Absolutely stunning. You know we'd be over the moon just watching you sit in an easy chair and play, right? =)
Lindsey rocks! She is truly amazing and talented. I love her music.
El esfuerzo y constancia gratifican tus actos
This gives me flash back to Shadows, best song video she made by my fellings <3
Wow es muy sorprendente como a ido creciendo tanto, recuerdo que desde la primera vez que la escuché quedé cautivada por esa pasión y esa dedicación que tiene. Desde la primero vez que la escuché ella se convirtió en alguien de quien admirar. Ella me motiva muchísimo hacer muchas cosas que me apasionan como lo es la música. La admiro demasiado y el ver que literalmente le cayó la boca al juez de Americas got talent, pues ella realmente pudo volar y wow es fascinante, mis palabras son pocas a comparación de la admiración y el buen trabajo que hace. Me inspira demasiado... La amoooooo.  Saludos desde México 🇲🇽
It's beautiful yet painful to watch, 😵😳🤐🥺😲😱🤯😨
My whole scalp would’ve ripped off my head. I could never 😦
I can't stop watching this. It might be visually simple, but the creative expression and passion you poured into this makes it, to me, one of your most meaningful and breathtaking performances. I have goosebumps.
Good work girl!! Bravo!
Anyone else playing the dubstep part of the song in their head while she’s doing this. Just me? Okay
Wow... Just dame girl ! Nailed it 1000% over every step you take forward we you grow stronger and stronger keep walking violin girl
She always out does herself. This is absolutely beautiful.
Creative, love your energy 💪💪💪🔥
I don't know if it's bizarre or unique.  But it was entertaining.  Wishing you a Merry Christmas to all.
Wow that was WOW . Well the ""Judge  that shall not be named "" was wrong on all counts . Keep smashing the limits Missy we are all here for you and behind you  100% all the way !!!!!
unbelievable, you´re just amazing
Wow that gave me a headache and got me dizzy  watching 😜🤪 but great entertainment and love this song
Beautiful!
Performance Art in its purest form, and much more! This melds musicianship, artistry and athleticism in a profoundly moving way. Loved it
Великолепно😍
I remember seeing Lindsey perform Crystallize at the "A Summer Evening of Music" concert with the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square in 2013. I thought it was such a moving performance! Watching the Behind the Scenes and then performance of Crystallize from Home For The Holidays was truly incredible and even more moving! Thank you for being such an inspiration and reminding all of us that "[we] can do hard things because [we've] done them before"!
Absolutely stunning 😍😁🤩
Bravo👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻! Explicit! 💕❤️😎
Such determination!!
Nailed it.. Happy Yuletide greetings.
Audition for cirque du solei??
Magnifique performance et tjs aussi belle
When she says pull my hair
The people that have thumbs downed this video have no soul. Even if you didn’t care for the video or were unimpressed because she’s done this song before... SHE’S HANGING AND TWIRLING FROM HER HAIR!!! I can’t even fathom how much that hurt! And she did it for her art, her craft, and her fans. Only a loser with the frozen heart of a troll would openly criticize that. So I say “Well done, Linds!” and boo to the haters.
Lindsey, you have completely outdone yourself. The performance you gave was so beautiful that I cried. I truly love how you continue to push yourself to the limits and see what else you are capable of. I can't wait to see what else is in store for you in the future. Sending love always!
I think some people missed the point, Yes, this was surely painful and it hurted me to see her cry, but that's what an artist do. She wanted to prove HERSELF that she could do something like this, she cares about her art and it's clearly her passion, so that's why she went through all of this just for this online concert. Ladies and gentleman, she is an artist. <3
Lindsey, what you did is incredible but that pain in your eyes... I love the Lindsey with joy and life in her eyes more ♥ We love you and you don't need to suffer to amaze us. Take good care of yourself ♥
зачем так себя истязать-то???
You did it!!! So proud of you Lindsey!! 😃❤
That's cool, dumb and crazy, don't hurt yourself.
ох, мне больно было смотреть, как ее за волосы цепляют
The new definition of high art in performance.  Bravo!
I can do relate to this. Thank you Lindsey. Watchful and respectful of the danger, yet bringing your best to it. The learning, then the satisfying show of mastery. And yes, voices saying why when you knew it was what you had to do. Deeply satisfying when accomplished. This is life. Not walking away from what is hard
😘😍
Your neck is so strong.
Magnifique,  superbe et...impressionnant !!!🙏❤
Ohhh lindsii
I'm getting a migraine just watching this!
Amazing❤
when my family hears me listen they just remind me that shes mormon
I held my head in pain from that, gotta Love Lindsey finding new ways to impress us all <3
I've watched this like 20 times.  It's beautiful.
Ohhh linsey
This was stunning. I litteraly had goosebumps watching you.
Mami u make me cry 😭, It’s so MAJESTIC AND BEAUTIFUL Thank you for giving us so much LOVE. Bless your ❤️ and please take care of your self 😘
That was awesome
Todo el video me quedé boquiabierta
Congratulations on conquering your fear and pain to do this. Beautifully done, be well.
this looks so rewarding! She persevered through her pain and look what she created! This is so pretty, God bless!
How long did you have to practice?😳😳
😲😱😲😱😲😱😲😱😲😱😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
this looks painful.
😯😯😯🎻🤩
this is by far my favorite music and choreography. I have always seemed to connect with this song on a deep level I can not explain she went through so much and you can tell! she did an amazing job, despite all the pain she did it. this is absolutely gorgeous
The best 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 YOU DID THAT!!!!! And it was absolutely EPIC!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
but why
Dear Lindsey, WE ALL HERE LOVE YOU...ADMIREd .. you are the jewel we love to see. PLEASE BE CAREFUL with yourself...GOD BLESS you...Удивительный и невероятный ты человек. А девушка какая...
В книгу рекордов гинеса можно заявку подавать!
She’s amazing! I loved her on AGT years ago. Piers Morgan should see her now about saying she had no career playing the violin. He was very wrong!
Не роби такого більше ніколи. Ті, хто бачив бекстейдж, не хочуть бачити твого болю та страждань. Твоя музика без цього всього і так неймовірна. Більше не роби так - благаю
Juste waw! Quel taillent! Quel niveau!
This deserves a Guinness world Record!!!  Like fr, this is insane, she is the best💕💕 I hope they do it 🤞🏻🙏🏻
Was she actually playing or are we hearing playback?
DEVINE
Wow, Lindsey! Amazing performance! You are so tough! Thank you for being so inspiring!!! Great job! You can do anything!
So magical,  thank you for a wonderful performance. It showed how strong you can be and push yourself to make something unforgettable.
Wow what a beautiful and talented woman  Every time I watch her l am surprised 🌸😇
She is amazing!
Bin ein kleiner Geist,habe nicht viel Geld.Doch hollst mich ab.Und öfnest mir sie Welt der Phantasie! Danke!
An den Haaren... hab ich ja noch nie gesehen. Muss doch weh tun und ob das gesund ist?
Okay, because I saw your vlog, I have weird mixed feelings now, thank you. :) First: This hanging by hair looks just weird. Second: I'm worried because of your pain. Third: I don't know how are you able to play on violin while you are spinning. Fourth: These gave the song a buff so it became stronger. Congratulations, I didn't know I can feel these at the same time! :D Please, don't do this again, we are worried. :D
You never cease to amaze me, Ms Sterling. Bravissima.
Poświęcenie pełne łez ale naprawdę było warto.
I admire the tenacity and determination to do something once you've put your mind to it. Her performance was incredible.
I have followed and loved Lindsey for years but this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Lindsey, you don't need to put yourself through this, you're fantastic just like you are!
Непревзойденный номер!!!! Суперталант!
This is the most beautiful thing I have seen this year. Thank you so much for your hard work and your beautiful performance. Just amazing.
WOW, Love your work more and more.
Girl your taking the violin to the next level. Just please be careful.
Much pain, don’t do that again , but was wonderful

All Ice Skaters Totally envious of your spins😳
This performance always brings me to tears because not only it is beautiful and amazing, but also because we know what you had to go through to reach this result. And your will and strenght to overcome your pain and fear are incredible and inspiring. Thank you Lindsey, I'm so proud of you, so proud and thankful to know you, I love you <3
are you really playing the violin rn?????????
❤️
Dancing, violin playing, trapeze, and hair? The strands of her talent are soaring.
What an outstanding performance!!!! What an artist!!!!!!!
you fly like an eagle you are so fluid you flow thru the air thank you
Nice performance, but so hard to watch !
Amazing
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐❤❤❤❤❤❤wowwwww
YAS YAS YAS!!! Your doing it!! Yay!! 😆😆😆😁😁😁😁😄😄😄
Nope. Props to her for doing that because I would have died
Simply one of the best things Ive seen on YouTube since there was YouTube. Amazing!
That. Was. AMAZING! Jeez I think I held my breath through the whole thing. You should be super proud of yourself!
you're Super Girl!
Your physically and musically amazing your so beautiful
Ничего себе, елочная игрушка получилась
Geez we all knw this hurt but dang Linds u made this look easy peasy. Way to go! One of ur BEST PERFORMANCES EVVVVVERRRRR!!!
героическая женщина!
I loved ❤️ it really captures the beauty of the art of making this music I admire your effort 🙏✨
Is very COOL
Lindsdy
Ohh
Lindsey, I can do even better, but you're lucky coz I've got no hair.
Her playing on the violin is brilliant.She does not have to dance.
🤯🤯🤯🤯👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 INCREDIBLE! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If you didn't believe in willpower, you should now.
Stunning !!!!!   You are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
You're insane!!! That was amazing.
All I can say is WOW! or better yet ow. It brought tears to my eyes seeing you perform this peace. I could not believe how much pain one person can withstand. You have all my respect.
THAT SPIN!!!
Ohhh mhy hermoso video
Those SWINGS!
This sums up her entire career IMO. Created from a shear determination that it could be done and that she could do it. From the first performances, to adding dance elements, essentially becoming a professional dancer, composition, and so much more creating an entire unique style of violin performance. Continuously striving for better. I hope more than a few people find this inspiring.
I'm bald,  seriously, it's beautiful
While the performance is absolutely incredible, I truly hope you're not going to repeat it, Lindsey. You are amazing artist and all the hard work and passion you put into your art is insane, we appreciate all you do, but please don't go as far as pushing beyond your limits when you suffer so badly because of it :( We love you Lindsey, you are a real star and inspiration. Sending hugs and love, please take care and thank you for all you do ♥ Hope you are well
Just gorgeous. You're so strong and it's amazing to watch.
Wow!! You're crazy... and awsome girl 👍🏻🤩🤩😘
Lindsey: spinning like a beautiful, sparkling Christmas ornament whilst playing her magnum opus the violin  Me: (openly weeping) You're doing amazing, sweetie.
Ow your hair
KEEP DOING WHAT YOU LIKE URE AMAZING💕💕💕
Thank you so much to give us that show, this video is beautiful ! :)
Absolutely breath taking, thank you so much for sharing your talent
Amazing
I love her !!! This was so beautiful ❤️
You did it! Wow...you can reach anything you can imagine!
Very talented.  I like the original better.  The song looses the "Oomph" without the normal background bass/dubstep.
blue make it rain
i felt in pure agony hahahahah isnt this dangerous??
Wow that was amazing I wish you can do this in the future with no pain.
aka zebra family
Ok, that was nice to do once, STOP IT. A fantastic video!
why? just why? yes, impressive... but still...she didn´t have to to go to such extremes... she´s such a great artist already...
ptm que dolor ;v ... pobre cabello :V
2:33 - auuu
After watching those spins i got dizzy🤣
Whoever allowed it is sadistic.
Unbelievable. Inspiring. Breathtaking. You never cease to amaze me with your songs, your dance, your positive attitude. You truly make me believe that anything can be achieved with a dream and hard work. Stunning performance as always.
WOULD LING LING APPROVE THOUGH. That is the question...that is the question
And the (Flying V)iolin on top of the performance
What she went threw to make this for us just beyond words Thank Lindsey
I love this song so much. Still gives me goosebumps sometimes and always gives me an irresistible urge to move and dance :)
What an ICON the talent! She is the moment
Astounding!
Phenomenal.
Impressive
Lindsey that was beautiful!! Looks like you were ice skating in the sky, love all your work, the emotions you put in it, and the  hardwork, and the ideas you get wonderful!
😮
Piers Morgan proved wrong way more than ever. #Queen
superbe
Bravo!
I got goose bumps ❤️
Now can we order our Linsey Sterling Ornament with the album?!
Stunning ❤️❤️❤️❤️
That was one of the most beautifully awesome things I've have ever seen I have nothing but admoration  and the upmost respect and unconditional love for you lindsey Stirling you are truly awesome and born to entertain absolutely spectacular ❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍😎
Wow! Amazing! I can't stop to Watch  It!!! 💕💕💕 Your concentration and the emotions.... Great! Really thanks 🙏
this is really impressive
Wow... feels like there's nothing you cant achieve! This is absolutely beautiful! I really hope you're doing ok, it looks beautiful, but also painful ^^"
Who's dancing in the bed and pretend they're in tt vid 😻🤛🏽
It is so beautiful that it will take your breath away. You are incredibly strong and I admire you, your creativity and your tenacity.
Bravo!! 👏👏
hard work, concentration, determination... simply amazing!!!
Piers Morgan: You'll never be good enough to fly through the air and play.  Lindsey Sterling: Hold my beer.
WOW Lindsey, eres muy fuerte, valiente y admirable, definitivamente se ve el esfuerzo que le pusiste a esto y no solo superaste todas las dificultades, sino que lograste llegar a la meta y demostrarnos que con esfuerzo, dedicación y disposición todo se puede. Tengo que añadir que eres una de mis más grandes inspiraciónes ;'3
This information was helpful with understanding hair hanging. https://youtu.be/R8R6ESFMero.   Still would never though!
What can Lindsey not do?  I love how she doesn’t limit herself, and to think that she was told she was not good on America Got Talent.   She never needed to go there, she can have her own show!  Bravo Lindsey!!!   You’ve done amazing!
Music..... A++++.  Hanging by your hair.....  F-     You can see she is in pain.  She does not have her beautiful smile.
You are truly amazing so Talented you have shown every Naysayer  that nothing is impossible
incredible work Lindsey!!! really amazing!!! i really enjoy it❤❤❤❤
You've turned pain into something inspirational and beautiful 🥰
Se va a quedar pelonaaaa !!! Dios miaaa
Ouch?!
Love the video looks like fun but can see that would hert your head
😲
One of my idols right there 👊🏻 👏 so new thinking, creative and inspiring.
YOU DID IT!!!
This is beautiful. I love this. Thank you
Amazing !!!
I am beyond impressed, even more after watching the vlog. I can only have the utmost respect for her.
Face mask at the start killed this clip for me :(
*LORD JESUS DIED & ROSE AGAIN TO FREE U FROM SIN ACCEPT HIS GIFT* ✝️✝️✝️
My daddy used to drag me around the house holding my hair, like a troglodyte. But playing violin meanwhile dancing is definitely a different level.
❤❤❤
This is amazing!! 😍 good job Lindsey!
Lindsey Stirling you are the most amazing, human, and empowering person ever! Through the tears and pain you accomplished this! Please know how awesome and inspiring you are and let this show you your true, remarkable strength ❤️
Extreme
Wow!!! So beautiful visually and auditorily! Merry Christmas,  Lindsey! 🎄❄🌟
This looks like a Las Vegas show!!!!!
FANTASTICA
Et dire que je l'ai connue il y a 9 ans lorsqu'elle avait à peine quelques milliers d'abonnés et qu'elle fessait ses performances dans des parcs ou ruines. Quelle ascension, elle est incroyable.
So viele Tränen sind geflossen. So viel Schmerz erlitten. Die eigenen Grenzen ausgelotet und erweitert. So viel harte Arbeit. Das alles für ein episches Video. So voller Anmut und scheinbarer Schwerelosigkeit. Mit diesem Video hast Du in deiner Kunst neue Maßstäbe gesetzt. Ich verneige mich in Ehrfurcht.
I wish she would release this version of Crystallize. I just love the instrumentals!
Woah girl! Very nice, but ouch! My girls were mesmerized.
fantastica
This had me laughing so hard I was crying! LOL
Dang! Now that takes some discipline! Very well done!🎉
Wow, Lindsay. You've really outdone yourself. This performance was absolutely stunning.
This is so beautiful.. It deserves at least 10M views
👏👏👏👏👏
Ліндсі це гарно але не треба більше!я тебе кохаю як композитора а не акробата!Lindsay, it's good but you don't need it anymore! I love you as a composer, not an acrobat!
Who don't like video músic's of Lindsey??? They are crazy ... Lindsey is the BEST VIOLINIST, person and artist... ❤️😄🥰
I wonder 💭 if my hair would hold me like that?? 🤷🏼‍♀️🙈🙄😳😖🤯😂😅🤣😂
That was a beautiful and gorgeous performance I was just breathtaking. But that looked like it hurt alot and your neck and head must be in pain.
👏👏👏
It is the most beautiful thing that I have seen definitely until she has surpassed herself in her dance and in everything
Why are you trying so far? As a violinist, you are aiming for limit beauty and performance that no one can do. Mind blowing performance！😲 Lindsey Stirling You are amazing.👍 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Strong hair ❤️👏
I love this orchestral version
It is not how physics works
Well done keeping that triangle
So beautiful
Incredible!!!
Stop  ! J'en ai mal aux cheveux, sinon superbe prestation
Wow! Playing while doing that kind of spin, let alone by her hair! Intense!
with this song started listening to you))) From Russia with love))
Amazing! Talent upon talent!
This isss amazing, I'm so proud of you, Linds ❤️
..great
Wouah! 😍😍 C'est trop beau bravo, très bon boulot Lindsey!
Why? You're so talented, you don't need stunts like this.
So much work.... so strong...  and also so beautiful...Lindsey you are an inspiration to us all.🤩🤩🤩
Ok that brought me to tears.  Your power of concentration is crazy. I've been a fan ever since I see you on Good Mythical Morning.  I played violin as a child and it is in my heart. Your music manages to touch me. I feel your music and it soothes me. Plus your story is an amazing one.  Thank you for sharing your talent and struggles with us. Forever a fan Sylvia
Amazing
❤❤👍
Literally heckin CHILLS AAAAAA
Wow,  this is really  fantastic!  Playing the violin and "hanging"/ dancing at the same time is amazing!
Снимаю шляпу, поступок очень сильный исполнить такой номер!
I can't describe what I feel? but you was amazing with your violin, I felt that I'm flying with your beautiful playing🧚🏻‍♀️, You did a major effort, but you proved your success with merit.♥️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Finally, Just I want to say :'' I Love you so much '' 😘♥️ I followed you  about 6 years ago I listen to your tracks daily🥰😍♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ I'm Egyptian, so I can't speak English perfect.😅
You did an amazing job! I saw the previous video about your journey with this. You did amazing. You are an inspiration to overcome any obstacles put in front of you!
Beautiful body movements, You are flying like magic or like You are on really small gravity, but the clue is Your face, i see pain, stress and fear. Please, never do that. I love your smile (of course like artist), your body full of expresion, violin master skills, but not this, this is a cruel.
Woa!! At this step is more than talent! Is completely incredible 😍😱! Ur boss
Ouch, kinda painful to watch, but what a performance!
I am literally in awe of you. You have such talent, drive, and determination. This is beautiful!
Wow you can see the determination and I know it was painful but that was incredibly! You accomplish what you set out to do and that’s admirable. Respect!
Juste pourquoi ?
Замечательно, прекрасно! 👏 Perfect!!! Линдси, боже я представляю как тебе было трудно! Ты большая умница и мы тебя любим 💕![sorry, sad anglish]
My jaw DROPPED!!
That performance was so inspiring and so amazing. ✨✨✨🥰🥰🥰🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Just unbelievably wonderful :0
You wanted to challenge yourself with this performance and I think it looks amazing. You did a great job. It must have been so flipping hard.
Lindsey got talent :D
It is beautifull and without any doubt very hard performance. Anatomically,  it shouldn't be even possible. Please, rather don't do it it again, I would say it is dangerous. It would be very, very big loss for everyone if something happened to you. But still, incredible performance.
Amazing, quite a workout!
A spectacular performance.
This is the first song that got me into her stuff!
I admit when you released your first video showing what you were training for I wondered why you would put yourself through that. But seeing how beautifully you moved through the air to the sound of your music was like watching an angel in flight. What you accomplished is truly inspiring and will remain in my thoughts while I tackle my own personal goals this coming year.
She's bold now, but all you need is an intertainment.. shame on you!!!!
I'll still try to get in touch with you, beloved Lindsey Stirling. Have a very Merry Christmas and Joyous New Year.
Amazing, really amazing; You are the best example of willpower and perseverance despite challenges, but break my heart watching you in pain, Please do not do that again I love you, Sister Stirling.
Are you a human?
IT WAS AMAZING!!! Thank you, Lindsey!
Ouch?
Do you guys remember when she did crystalize like 8 years ago? Yeah I thought that was talent. Nothing could have prepared me to see this much improvement and stamina and willpower
Eres eres eres super. No lo puedo creer . Extraordinari de otro planeta y tan bella
Beautiful and Talented. I wish my hair was that strong!  I am so proud that you never gave up and ignored all the negativity that stood in your way. You are truly an inspiration to us all!
Check out my book on my channel thanks you
Your hard work paid off. This is beautiful ❤️
Beautiful, but ouch!
💞💞💞
why??
Lindsey FTW!😆💛
...And the Stirling’s small neck grew three sizes that day.
why this much paining
Beautiful job!  You make it look so affortless!  I know it was hard work getting to this point.  Merry Christmas.
AMAZING 😱 but it looks very painful 😳
Nice!
Lindsey learned to fly.
это русский комент, поэтому вряд-ли кто-то поймет (ну если вы из России то конечно же поймете) но это изумительно, я смотрю и плачу от того, насколько это красиво, Линдси, я обожаю тебя 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍✨✨✨✨💖✨✨
YOU DID IT AND YOU LOOKED AMAZING...SOOO PROUD OF YOU!!!!🙌🏾🥇
As a fan of yours since you first posted electric daisy violin this is by far the most incredible performance I have seen you do bravo. So much strength and grace.
Meu caneco, nossa senhora, que arraso jesus amado!!!
Soberb, wonderful, divine... You reach master of masters level Lindsey!!
Просто великолепное выступление!!! Очень круто!!!
Such an awesome Performance... THAT  is bodycontrol. I don't want to even imagine how that feels >___<
"How's your year been?" "Hanging by the hair"
Beautifully done. 🔥🖤
WOW!!!  That was utterly amazing!!   That's an interesting new violin.  I like how it is braced against the body to prevent it from spinning away.
amazing on the hair hanging act but provide me a real live version to proove she can actually play while perfoming that
Honey, you look beautiful, but why did you do this to you? Hearts and love to you :)
Still King of the web
All that hard work and determination paid off so well, such a beautiful performance!
increíble, sorprendente, magnifico, no puedo creer que alguien se atreva a realizar tal asaña, Lindsey, sin duda alguna eres la mejor artista que he conocido
You are incredible!!!
Is this the only song she plays?
So beautifull
Please don't do that again, that was awfull, especially after the BTS video. For the next one, you could try zero gravity instead.
The amount of extra is the exact amount of love I have for this!
This was amazing artistry, athleticism and grace to pull this off.  I had seen Ms. Sterling's vlog on the hesitation, pain that went into rehearsing this to become the scene/video.  It was beautiful Lindsay and brought me to tears-that's the sweetness of the violin which is remarkable.  BRAVO!!
Lindsey du bist sooo verrückt gut, lässt dir immer wieder was neues einfallen und am Ende bezauberst du uns mit so etwas schönem. You' re very best.
She loves to get her hair pulled freak
clap** clap** clap** This women has always been pushing her art more and more and I love seeing her grow over the last decade!! This was intense, I can only imagine the pain going thru this over and over practicing. A shining light in 2020, what a way to bring in the new year. Thank you Lindsey!
You never cease to amaze and inspire me, Lindsey. Great job. You did it!!
This performance completely blew me away.  I cried with joy, especially after watching the Vlog. Lindsey, you are absolutely incredible, and you did a beautiful job.
ohhh myy gut
She freaking DID IT!!!!!!!!!!
I admire the determination and will to do this, but that was too much pain :( Use a body harness next time please.
I'm crying! It's magnificent...
She has gone through pain, of course. But by seeing this performance I'm pretty sure her feeling of accomplishment overcomes it.
The sheer determination, willpower, and pain in that expression seems very fitting for the end of 2020.
👁👄👁👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Excellent performance you are truly amazing and unique keep up the excellent work would love to do a track with you
We are very proud of all you do Lindsey 💙 we love u so much
Waouh
Lindsey... you are the best! THANK YOU for this Video <3
Mesmerizing
Boy I love watching her so much.
I can’t even have my hair in a poly tail for 3 hours! Amazing job! And such an incredible performance!
Precioso !!! Inspirador
это круто, на самом деле
Wonderful performance. Marry Christmas to you and may the Heavenly Father bless you!
this must be so painful, and I can't help myself from asking: why?  It is amazing to watch, yes, but is it really necessary for your music? Does your music *need* this? Was it worth it? Well, I really hope you were satisfied by this show. If you're happy, I am too.
I am so proud of you lindsey <3
Wow amazing!!!!
не огонь, а лава
come on lindsey you are my motivation
While I watched this performance varying of feelings appeared in me: I felt beauty, because of the beautifulness of the movements. I felt pain, because of seeing the suffering of the Human body. I felt transcendence, because of seeing the transcendence of the pain.  Lindsey, you are amazing. The Human body, is amazing. The intangible thing beyond the Human body, is amazing.  We all, are amazing.
That was amazing. Just goes to show what lengths she will go to to give the people watching good entertainment, and it shows her dedication to what she does. I have been following her for quite some time and I am sure this is one of the best performances of her life. Thanks Lindsey.
Taking the Pain to give us love - she's like jesus
Amazing, Love you!!!!!!!!!!!
Me encanta como tocas y muchos de tus trabajos ,pero no bajo el dolor físico,eso es autoflagelo.cuidate no vale la pena.tofo es vano
She seems very surprised during her performance, god bless her.
can someone write the full setlist of the show??? It was amazing!
wow so incredible
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim Tövbe Bilmillah  Çılgın hareketler eşiliğinde çılgınca müzik :)
Одна из лучших композиций! Любимая. Спасибо! Неужели возможно во время этого действительно играть?
I to saw what you overcame for this breath taking performance!! Love everything you do Sister!!! And Thank You🤗
#MODOTURBO #Pabllovittar #Anitta #Luísasonza no YouTube 🇧🇷🎯🎯
This is amazing and beautiful and I hope it didn’t hurt too bad. <3
Не ну это лайк и репост Господа и дамы, Линси так держать мы Любим тебя!!!!!!!!!
How to get Lindsey Stirling to do the impossible. Tell her it can't be done.
but why?
Absolutely amazing and beautiful.
Я видел, как ты страдала на съемках этого клипа. Однозначно в топ!
Просто супер. Браво.
She is crazy good; Probably using 20% more of brain power than the rest of us mundanes.
Cómo me jode que alguien tan amado por mí se haga con tantos fans y se olvide de sus inicios, siendo otra persona.
That was incredible. I looked without breathing. Lindsay Stirling you are my heroine. Your strength of mind and will inspires. Thank you.
Just perfect! Congrats👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
This was absolutely stunning it gave me chills
Молодец, труды и боль стоили того
wow... i cried
Lindsey, You are Magic ❤️
U R AMAZING  But please, please dont ever go thru this again 😢😭
Это просто шикарно просто нету слов 😍😍😍😍
So much talent! Thank you for your hard work in creating such beautiful things.
Thank you for being you and sharing your magic with the entire world. Blessed to be inspired by your talent and creativity ✨ 💙  This ... boosted my determination to thrive. Thank you Miss Stirling
Автора этой "художественной" идеи - уволить.
**me frantically tapping guy next to me on the bus**   "SHES PLAYING A FLYING V VIOLIN. SIR...SIRR....SHES PLAYING A FLYING V VIOLIN"
Breathless
Дорогая Lindsey! Ты сделала волшебное видео! И спасибо что поделилась с нами тем, как тяжело это тебе далось, т.к. далеко не многие понимают, сколько труда, сил, энергии, боли и терпения требуют ТАКИЕ прекрасные вещи! Надеюсь, тебе этот навык больше не пригодится (это слишком больно)!  Translate:  "Dear Lindsey! You made a magical video! And thank you for sharing with us how hard it was for you, because not many people understand how much work, effort, energy, pain and patience SUCH wonderful things require! I hope you don't need this skill anymore (it hurts too much)!"
Hey. You don't need to hurt yourself for attention. You're amazing as is. This hair stunt was unnessecary.
Pierce: "You're Not Good Enough" Lindsey: "Hold my hair"
You're amaizing in every sense of the word. That is alll!!! Xoxoo
I have no words. !
Finally, I can play Crystallize on loop without having to resort to going to another channel.  Thank you, Lindsey Stirling!   (Edit: Also, we hope you loved doing that. However, remember that your music will forever heal those that listen to it.)
This is so cool!!
wow. how beautiful.
No that wasn't so hard afterwards anyways. Skydiving is next right?
just incredible
you never stop amazing me
WHY?!!!!!
Your hair  It doesn't hurt????😢😢😢 You are perfect 😍😍😍😍😍😍wooowww
INCREDIBLE WOW
Честно... Я понимаю, что это шоу и прочее... Но это смотрится слишком бредово. Я, в первую очередь как скрипач,  сильно против этого. При таком  раскачивании за веревку ПРИКРЕПЛЕННУЮ к волосам ты банально не сможешь играть. Танцы со скрипкой от Линдси выглядят превосходно, но только не это. Линдси, это не будет стоить тех стараний которые ты вкладываешь в своё творчество. Честно, меня этот ролик очень отталкивает. Это первый мой дизлайк на этом канале, увы.
Very, very creative.  Thank you.
Her costume and makeup is gorgeous ❤️
I very" Like this version
Gotta be one of the dumbest things I've ever seen.
Gracious...Ok...you did the hair hanging. All I could feel was the agony of that journey and your pain. Was that your purpose?
You're amazing Lindsey
It hurts to watch. Sadists will love it.
How are you human?! This was incredible! You just keep raising the bar!
For the record, this is NOT my thing. While there’s no denying the woman has talent, it’s all negated by the fact that she’s hanging from her head. I don’t care if she was solving complex equations while reciting Shakespeare....DON’T do it whilst hanging from your head...
perfect💙👍👍👍💙🇦🇿
No words.... 😲😲😲
Wow Lindsey!!!!!
Yay I’m not a day late
Wonderful 😲😲😲😲😲 I really can't find words to describe your show. You did a great job, Love you ❤️❤️
fantastic... the symbiosis from movement and music in that fantastic and beautiful kind let us dream.. very thx for your dedication
Love it
WOW , diese entschlossenheit in ihrem Blick , meine absolute Hochachtung , Danke Lins
Wowww ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! Your story of getting to this point is very moving. Thank you for your inspiration.
(Ten years from now) "Gee Lindsey, why do you have male pattern baldness?"
Hey I just wanna say thank you for your hard work and dedication to your craft. Very few people will ever understand the pain it takes to truly get somewhere or achieve something as beautiful as you did. Because the truth is a lot of successful people or people that are really amazing at what they do, go through this kinda of pain. They just go through it alone and behind closed door, so many never truly know the pain or toll it has taken on them. But you opened up and showed us just how much pain it was to achieve beautiful work. And it’s not up to us to determine whether it was worth it or not. Because at the end of the day, the simple far that you were even able to do something you one thought was impossible is what really made it wholesome in the end. Stay safe, stay strong, and keep persevering! Thank you for the inspiration
congratulations Lindsey, you do it! you're amazing, we loves you. Kisses from spain!
Ты просто супер Lindsey Stirling обалденный клип.
It reminds me almost of a scene from a SAW movie
Amazing in ever way! And after seeing the journey to get to this performance, it became even more incredible and satisfying to watch. You're truly an inspiration to all.
If you've followed Lindsey's vlogs at all on what she had to go through to prepare for this, you likely ended this video as I did, with tears in your eyes. It's odd to feel so proud of someone you've never met but this girl... she's absolutely incredible.
Uff.... Respect..... 🤗🥰 Best performance ever.... Thanks Lindsey... 🤗🥰 Love'ya... 🤗🥰
Insane. Absolutely insane. I cried.
Amazing!!!!!!!
For those saying they don't understand the point of her doing this, it's probably not that deep.  It was something that she wanted to attempt and incorporate into her performance. It turned out to be way more difficult than she anticipated. But she refused to let herself give up halfway through. Even if it's only to do it once, she wanted to prove to herself that she could do it.
But....why? Has she not heard of a harness?
Wow she is wonder woman!
Splendida! Sei una grandissima persona e professionista! Tutta la mia stima! Buon Natale
The song and the dance are beautiful but it hurts my heart to know the pain you endured both physically and emotionally.
Лйк не глядя!
Everyone: "there is no way she can top dancing and playing violins" Linsey: "Hold my hair"
She is so confident and amazing in everything she does. I can't wait to see her next July in Seattle.
Peace y'all,  I sell Premium Gold Seamoss and Pineapple Seamoss gel! Raise your energy levels naturally and boost your immune system.  🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 www.autochthonsofamerica.com
I'm waiting for Cirque do Soleil to hire Lindsey 🥺. I cried so much when I watched the training she went through, she's so talented and mentally strong ❤️.
This is crazy...and next level...but mostly crazy.
Это потрясающе.
COOL
I bet the real audio sounds amazing...
Sieht nicht schön aus, bisher fand ich alle Videos toll. Das hier nicht.
Lol interesting and very skillful with that violin 🎻😍 https://youtu.be/3JW8PpC2D3M
Напряжение просто пздц. Не надо так!
Well done 👍🤗
Lindsey, you've outdone yourself.  That was beautiful!
Adoro vc muito , não era muito fã de violino mas vc me fez gostar e até começar a fazer aula obrigada muitttoooo . Parabéns .
You are beyond incredible. I need to watch this stream.
👍
You are a great fellow, you have very beautiful and magical music. I really admire your music, patience and strength to you! happy new year!
My gosh, breath taking! Absolutely stunning and amazing!
Wow!
какой кошмар
Was she actually playing or are we hearing playback?
WOW! Seeing how this caused you so much pain, you pulled through it and put on such a beautiful and mesmerizing performance! Way to go! You should feel so proud of yourself Lindsey! We all are ❤
😎👏👍💖
Szalone ;)))) pozdrawiam
Questo è talento... This is talent
Is she really playing or is it just a visual?
Lindsey is unlimit
Her entire being is a work of art. Beautiful empress.
I was one of Lindsey's early fans, back when she used to chat with us in the comment of her videos, and people used to tease me for enjoying her music, the same way the AGT people dismissed her as a novelty act.  People told me I should listen to Yitzhak Perlman if I wanted to hear _good_ violin.  And to them I say: let me know when Yitzhak Perlman plays hanging by his fuggin' _hair_ and I'll be impressed.
I really do wish they would use less time effects in the editing because it makes it to where you can't she if she's actually playing or just faking it for the camera. Which in this case totally negates what she's doing. About the only spot I could tell was the few seconds after 2:08 or so where you could correlate her playing to the music you were hearing.
she is crazy and endlessly great at the same time!!!!! Bravo!
Lindsey-  THANK YOU, absolutely spectacular!!  Merry Christmas, now go get some neck massages!!!
.......................................... Wow Gave me chills, again.
Wow
Simply amazing! You're so talented Lindsey! That was not a easy thing to do! Ouch! I hope you and your family have a Happy Holiday and get lots of rest after that!
Wow, ouch and incredible!!!
O, Jesus! Now please don't ever do that again!
2 cervical vertebrae popped out of my neck just by watching this
simplemente increíble como bailas y tocas el violín, eres increíble y tienes una gran determinación para lograr lo que quieres
Oh very good 💖😘😊
Way to go lindsay never give up
Hermoso ❤️
пипец и как голова не оторвалась?!!!
Me: Why can't she audition for American got talent? Simon Cowel: Can you do something different. Sofia Vergara: Presses the golden Bazar.
Cool
Pure Dedication! Lindsey you are a true inspiration to us all
You have my respect Lindsey for this GJ
Look at everything as though for the first time youre looking at the world, that observation is to watch oneself never allowing a single thought to escape without watching it. Observing has no time, the other is caught in time, thought creates the time.
WOW! i am speechless, so much work, so much body Control this Version is so  unique u are great.
BRAVO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hahahaha and agt  said she couldn’t play properly dancing around!!! You go Lindsey!!
as always you are amazing lin. i work out with your music everyday 😉 keep it up girl
C’était incroyable. Merci pour tous ce que tu donnes ta musique, ton style, t’a danser et tous le reste. Tu es génial continue comme ça et courage.
I try not to be judgmental in any way, and open-minded to all that I perceive! However, you are the most strong, beautiful, and talented angel to have graced this earth. I'm truly captivated by your performances without a doubt!    I've only recently started watching your videos, and all I can say is, I love you! You are very,  unique and quite the genius in your own right.  Thank you,  Lord, for letting us view your angel, Lindsey.
Lindsey Stirling is one of my heroes.  I try to expose my daughter to all of her content.  She is just amazing.
Lindsey this is sooooo beautiful!!!! You have an idea and you give it your all and look at the outcome. This is amazing and the fact that you did it while also playing..... like come on!!! There is nothing you can do. You are a artist and I love watching everything you create.
Humans are so weird...
la amo
I am so proud of you for pulling through!! The result is absolutely amazing. I don't know what it is about this video but i just watch it on repeat. I love this version of the song and just the whole video is a masterpiece!! Its so beautiful, thank you for your stregth!! <3
Вот что означает сила воли, Линси мне даёт надежду и дух, если мне тяжело то я вспоминаю Линси и сразу дух становится сильней
Okay did anyone else think this song was Elements? I'm such a dum-dum. 🤦‍♀️
Really nice 👌
10 sur 10 wahou !!!
Waouh magnifique grandiause 🥰🥰🥰🥰👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Barios aplausos por el esfuerzo, te haz pasado ñ-ñ mis saludos
What did her hair follicles do to deserve this abuse?
I'm shocked. It must be very hard
In my opinion see is the best at what she does keep up the awesome work
La performance est vraiment très impressionnante félicitations.  Par contre je ne trouve pas ça très beau comparé à des chorégraphies comme <<Master of tides>> ou <<Mirage>> et le montage du clip ne nous permet pas d'apprécier la musique que tu produit vraiment, c'est dommage.  Mais je le redis : c est très impressionnant, bravo.
Love her!❤
just beautiful
Great, wunderful. You are one with hairhanging. I like to see your ballet dancing with your violin on the ground. THX. Respect to do something new with your wunderful music.
I had to cry. We love you, but you go too far! Why you do that to youreself? Please stop hurting yourself.
Hmmm
When someone who already great steps it up to EXTRAORDINARY! You rock Lindsey!
Violin playing is very good and I love it but what's the rope for she's not doing anything impressive with that she's just running around and getting pulled up in the air from time to time not like she's doing any fancy schmancy acrobatics. It just seemed dull intact on it.
Truly stunning, Lindsey!  Thank you for leaving in the breathing sounds. It really helps to bring across the level of your art.  One of the most beautiful, yet difficult to watch performances, ever!  What an analogy for life!  Merry Christmas!  We love you, Lindsey!  Stay safe and healthy.
Линдси это великолепно и сногшибательно, чудесно и потрясающе!!! Никто до этого такого никогда не делал. Сколько труда и боли было вложено в это выступление. Каждый твой ролик чем-то удивляет. Но этот просто приятно шокировал!!! Продолжай удивлять всех нас, твоих преданных зрителей. Успехов!!!
Bravo, Bravo. I understand it was hard.  But I´m happy we share our life span so I can enjoy a great artist as you while being alive.
Hooooooo....WWWOOOOOWWWWW......XX
After seeing this I think Cirque Du Soleil, would make an incredible show using your music
The choreography is beautiful and unique. We can see the grace and pain. Flying in the air must have been a wonderful feeling. Please, don't put yourself through that again.
Feelings of Music 🥰🥰 Love From Bangladesh 💕💕🔥
I don’t have words to describe this. 😍👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
lan kafası kopucak
Dear Lindsey, you are a wonderful artist and art fighter. we love and appreciate you. But you don't need to torture yourself like that anymore, creativity should bring joy and not pain. We don't want to cry with you.
Absolutely amazing well done.
So proud of you for accomplishing something you thought you couldn't do,so proud of you for not giving up!! You did it!!!!! Sending so much love!! ❤️❤️🥰🤩
Придумали ПЫТКУ.
I just have one word: WOW!!
I feel faint just looking at this.
She sum up and end 2020 with this beautiful performance
So beautiful and amaizing!!! and knowing how hard has been to be ready for it makes it far more special. You and your determination are an inspiration to do the best I can. Thank you for sharing your talent and that also the "hidden" price that you had to pay to do such a beautiful performance!
Wwwwwwoooooowwwwww🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
My respect
Amazing 👏
Another amazing song but this video is exceptional
I literally started crying when this was finished because she has come so far and she was able to accomplish and complete her routine and she just looked at peace with it all. GO LINDSEY! 😇❤😀🎻🔊🥳
i have watched this so many times now its so amazing
woooow
Gaaa, I couldn't watch it. Just scrolled to the comments and listened. Looked too painful for my gentle soul.
2:41 Gentlemen we are in the presence of an angel
Resprect!@Lindsey!
You are amazing. Its insane how much pain you went thru. Its very inspiring to listen to you and watch you at your craft. You are so graceful. I love you. You help me cope and get thru my days with your music.❤
That is beautiful art 😍
самоубийца
I love her music and videos! She is so amazing and so talented! Her performance and violin playing is so magnificent -- she really makes the violin  sound with such beautiful style.
no one: Lindsey Stirling: 360 violin headshot VAC
Amazing!!!
Wow, that´s so wunderful.
I'm incredibly happy for you thanks for the beautiful performance
I know it looks painful, but something in me is saying that it’s fun 😂
Absolutely touched me and made me cry. Beautiful
I know she has 12 million + subscribers, but I feel Lindsey needs to be heard more. I know she’s insanely popular now, but I still feel she’s a little underrated, compared to other artists. This girl deserves more audiences! Like this video should be in the millions by now. This took a lot of dedication, perseverance, pain, and TALENT. I’ve held a violin before and could not hold it right, let alone HANGING BY MY HAIR AND HOLDING/PLAYING IT. This girl is SO amazing! Add some icing to the cake, Lindsey is one of the most sweetest people on the planet. She does a lot to help those in need. And fame had never messed with her spirits, her beliefs, her personality. She’s the same person as she was on AGT. Love you, Lindsey! So glad we got to chat on meet & greet last night. 🥰
chapeau bas! belle prestation
OUCH!
OW
🤭🙌❤️
Meu Deus. Parabéns pela entrega.
Un aspirina ... Pobre cabecita i usted tan hermosa...😍
incroyable !!!! et tellement magnifique
Still your best song IMO. I love this song to this day.
that.was.amazing. Thank you so much for charing.
Beautiful and amazing. And yet also kind of uncomfortable to watch. What really caught me off guard was when you started swinging high with so much force (just after 1 minute mark). And then of course the finale high above the floor. That was just... wow.
Very impressive I wonder if it could be done with a guitar but that's beside the point this was a very well done performance even though I can be sometimes a harsh judge I would have to give this a 7 out of 10 Provo
Didn't your head hurt after that? Looks kinda painfull but still a nice show. Many thanks to you
Восхитительно!
YESSSSSS YOU. DID. THAT. THING.  Incredible!
Incredible, but also a little bit crazy. Beautiful video as always
Like I commented on her hair hanging vlog: I cant watch this. 1 minute in and going to stop there. It might look nice, but all I can think about while watching this is how much this must hurt and that it cant be good for someones health. Sorry Lindsey, I really love your music, but I seriously cant watch this.
beautifull, you're fly !!!! but i'm hurt for you , please dont do that again. kiss kiss ! take care!
I watched the pain but the performance was as beautiful as ever we love you merry Christmas kisses
This is very impressive! Also: Lindsey looks like a Christmas ornament here, and I love it, haha.
Excellent  Lindsey Sterling  violine chrophed  performance  Bravo  thank you for sharing  . Stay safe take care to all those who are in team family friends and fans.  Happy  Holidays  ...⭐⭐⭐⭐🌬🦋🦋🦋❄☃️🎄☃️
Marvelous! Incredible dedication and so beautiful to watch. But next time you want to fly, use some crazy harness stuff. It might look a bit less magical, but we don't want to see you hurting. I was constantly feeling your pain and was worried for you.
Lindsey  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
That's so breathtaking and amazing! It's beautiful🌠💕
Once again it is proven lindsey You are amazing very talented besides beautiful we love You millions tanks for being like that, princess of music ❤️❤️😍😘😍😍❤️❤️🎼🎶🎻
Stunning. How in the world could you concentrate on the song while spinning that fast? Wow.
Well done Lindsey!!!
Wow, that's pretty amazing!! Not just pretty amazing, what's the correct word to use!!! Magnificat! !!!!  Absolutely  amazing!!!
You worked so hard for this. I’m torn.  Yay great you did it. This was excruciating to watch. We saw what you lived to do it.  I’m sorry Lindsey, this is one I will never watch again.  We come for your smile while you play. There as no smiling. Not even in relief it was over. That’s... wrong.
Amazing, how human hair are strong. Good job Lindsey!
Umm...*dead*🤣
Why bother having the violin with you...was awesome enough without pretending to play it...i mean playing while dancing is one thing that could work but you cant play while doing this....physically impossible...for example the rotations need your arms to stay still...it may seem like i dont appreciate the act..but i would like to see it without the violin
Very Amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow... Such beauty created beyond the challenges... Your moves so graceful and stunning... I honour your perseverance, Lindsey ... but now lets go back to that pink sea from Angels We Have Heard on High and nurture the soul in a softer and more gentle way.OK?🌸
Wow .... now that is impressive. Absolutely stunned. :)
effort, persistence, success. you are a wonderful detail. Amazing. I ♡ you ❤🇹🇷
Amazing, I really like you.
Wow its very beautiful well done!!!!! I love your music and talent!!!!!♡♡
BRAVO.....!!!
I would never be able to do this, even if I trained for 100 years
Awesome!
она чего шибанулась за волосы вешаться....
You are extraordinary Lindsey! One amazing lady - artistically, mentally and in your wonderful, deep faith.
It's beautiful but I still believe she should have been using a harness.
As much as I loved what you have done, as much as I don’t want to see it again, we felt your pain through it, but as always, you keep inspiring us with your music and your challenges 👍🏼🥰
I need to know what shampoo you use.
It was absolutely amazing and beautiful great job
Wooooow 😲😲😲
WOW
that determination i seen in your eyes before they lifted you, I LOVE IT! You thought about giving up but im truly honored that you didn't for us & the world
Sposobów Emazing
Das Lied ist6 ja super aber das mit den Haaren ist absoluter Blötsinn!!!!!!!
That seems very uncomfortable... Love the song.
She did it! She DID it! Wow, can't comprehend all the sheer will and dedication it took to do this. The music is of course spot on and inspirational, but her sharing this with the world is such a gift of the human spirit. Thank you MS. Stirling and all her behind the scenes support. Thank you, thank you!
WOWWWWWWWWW
Thank you Lindsey when I first watched this track years back I always visioned you doing a ice swing over a frozen lake and this video just makes that more beautiful. You are so unique that I enjoy everything you produce merry Christmas and have a wonderful new year from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 uk
ohhh wow ..
1 minute, 6 seconds, That's all it took for me to fall in love with this video. I watched Lindsey's VLog about her hair hanging experience, and it's so real, so honest that you just cry along with her. I hope she sees this. Lindsey, you are my love, my joy and my inspiration. Crying with you as you struggled through the pain, misery and self-doubt was an experience I will never forget. Seeing this final product, it was all worth it. Every Single Second.
so glad it didnt turn into a horror, was worried for her sculp all the time :D
Sincerely Thank You for your Outstanding Sacrifice and pain given to all of us viewers.  I can only imagine the pain you had to suffer through Lindsey.   Thanks.
Stop it! You've amazed us enough. Don't hurt yourself again. We love you.
Amazing...
Музыка просто завораживает! Не пойму к чему такие жертвы??!! Видела бекстайдж( как модно сейчас говорить)) этой постановки и подготовки к этому номеру.
This looks painfull I can't watch it :(( But I appreciate the effort!! Stay safe Lindsey :*
Dear Lindsey,  "No journey is too far when you find what you are looking for."  A great task you have mastered. You are awesome.  Best regards Matthias
A serious performer in ALL aspects.
Absolutely beautiful girl, beautiful performance, beautifully talented execution.    God Bless you Lindsey.
Lindsey, we love you so much. Please don't do this again.
Perfect
I had such a hard time watching this as a empath cause I could almost feel the pain in my hair like phantom pain and I almost went down to hide in the comments while listening, but I couldn't. I couldn't not watch and like cause then it felt like she went through that pain in waste and I couldnt' do that. It was so beautiful yet my heart screamed for her to be careful. You are such an inspiration Lindsey never forget that. You are amazing!
That gotta hurt so much ❤❤❤
Please!!!! Come to Australia 🙏🙏🙏  You are Nothing short of phenomenal!!!
Que produção maravilhosa !!! Lindo demais, cada detalhe!
Thank you for being the physical manifestation of sheer grit and persistence time and time again. You will always be my inspiration.  For those who haven’t seen the Vlog, it brought me to tears. Definitely check it out!
Это великолепно! тяжёлый труд и чётко поставленная цель всегда дадут результат. Молодец! It's great! hard work and a clear goal will always work. Well done!
Sharon:you need to be in a Group. You Wont fill Theatres. Piers: you are Not good enough to get away with flying while playing the Violine. Lindsey(Cannot nod because her hair doesnt allow her so) : but i bring Joy and employ thousands of people
After all the training, you did a remarkable job. Cheers
Одного лайка тут недостаточно. Браво. Аплодисменты
Just WOW
Know you went through a lot to be able to do this, and the result was absolutely worth it! Well done!
It is imprissonned
This is awesome!  but it looks SO painful 😱
Tu es là meilleure violoniste que je connaisse, tu es une femme formidable respect à toi toujours un plaisir de t'écouter.  Bisous de France génération 29ans 😘😘😘😘
Your hair's root game is on point!
Well done! My deepest respect
She looked like a beautiful ornament but I felt her pain, it was difficult to watch her in some parts.
How it started: Piers Morgan saying Lindsey's not good enough on Americas Got Talent  How it's going: This masterpiece
I can't stop watching this.. it's so beautiful..  Send help.
ok, wow.
Why, God why?
Так стоп, а где реклама шампуня?)
That looks so painful and incredibly beautiful
Quelle horreur  !! la musique sublime, mais la vidéo ... on se sent très mal !
Wow totally amazing 👏 that had to be so hard to do . Bravo
Sono una tua fan. sei meravigliosa hai una forza d animo invidiabile. Adoro il violino e il suo suono fin da piccola tu hai elevato ancora di più questa mia passioni con i tuoi video e la tua musica grandiosa. Grazie di cuore per l emozione intensa che mi fai provare.
The living Rapunzel with a violin.
I just can't watch it. You look like you're suffering, silently in pain. This isn't why we watch you! We watch you because we love your music. Honestly, it's amazing what you achieved but please don't put yourself through this ever again! You don't need to suffer for us - we love you!
Amazing, Lindsey!!! You never cease to blow my mind with your incredible skills and beautiful art!!! 🎻🎵🎶
WW84 PurppGhost  featured on Soundcloud
THIS WAS SO AMAZING!
This is very old dubstep music  Now no dubstep base violin rework and became more magnificent This is Nostalgia
Ok that was something I've never imagined I'd see in my life. The skill this woman has is ridiculous.
W.O.W !!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Thank you 😭😭😭😭😭
This was true determination and beautiful. Don't do it again though, your hair is amazing and we don't need it ripped out.
Watched Your previous video aswell very inspiring.. Example of real dedication that motivates and not the other way around.. Thank you..
Be careful about neck dislocation beb, but overall that's so great
Well done Lindsey, you are an incredible woman! That look of sheer determination on your face at the beginning was truly empowering. Beautiful performance. 🥰
I think the Apostoles saw Christ suffering on the Cross in the very same way we all watched Lindsey: wanting desperately to come and get her off that horrible hook. Oh my do I understand them now. Beauty born in suffering.
Che forza
Queeeeeeeen 🖤🖤🖤
Me: 2020 cant get weirder 2020: watch this 😂
Lindsey! You're BEYOND amazing, you're UNEARTHLY beautiful. But PLEASE stop that, we're scared for you :(
Beyond amazing !
Wow!
wow
You're so totally AMAZING ❤🔥
WOW sooo krass
В чём фокус?
*The violin melody is amazing on its own, u didnt have to torture urself & couldve came up with a different scenario*
Ne dais pas cas!!!!!!
👏👏👏👏👏💐💐💐😘
Amazing. Mind over matter and pain. A true gifted artist indeed. Thank you for this wonderful holiday gift to all your fans.

You did it !!! You should be so proud.
and what was it for?
You are such a strong human being. I don’t know how you did it, but I was fighting the waterworks most of show.. Always get emotional listening to your music / seeing the passion through your music videos. Thank you.
Hai la musica nel cuore!
Wow is all I can say is just frickin wow I've seen all your videos from the start and you are so talented and amazing and you keep being brave enough and keep getting better awesome performance and yes I agree with most comments in this thread if there was an audience they definitely would be going nuts
Завораживающе!!! Великолепно!!!
Потрясающе 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
If you think that looks like it hurts try it the bottom end
deliver her to mountains of olympus. she is God mode.
Awesome and inspiring resolve and determination!  The dance is beautiful, but our hearts ache to see you in so much pain! We hope there is no negative long-term impact on your physical health from this.  Please take care of yourself so we can enjoy many more wonderful performances!  We love you, and Merry Christmas!
PERFECT .... !!!!!
weird flex but ok
bravo,magnifique,  courageuse, love!!
Now we see the result of so much effort and painful crying, congratulations, it is very nice.
I'm not sure how this is even possible without a hidden harness on her back.
Wow !
Her taking about how hard this was and how she had to “push through” was one of the most unintentionally funny things I’ve ever seen.. haha. Like it’s ridiculous
Amazing!!!
i love you
YOU DID IT!!!! T_T You're amazing ♥
Best violinist
"Wheeeeee"
beautiflu clip
Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Может девчонка
I saw this viedo first before the blog video. I thought "you can see the pain, the determination, the dedication, and the holding back of the tears." Not sure why she did it, but it was amazing. And i agree, don't ever do it again. One tear came from me while i watched the blog video. Congratulations Lindsey. Hope to see you soon in concert.
Oh my gosh, what can I say "Wow" like "Wow!" What a spectacular and beautiful masterpiece. What an artist and how she can do that with her hair........is just gob smacking amazing! So, so beautiful! What a talent, what a beautiful and amazing human being! 😍💖🤩
Absolutely stunning.... The performance was AMAZING, the music was INSPIRING, you were so GRACEFUL. Another feather in your cap for a great show!! I was in awe of watching you. Now go put an ice pack on your head and retire that loop and hook, girlfriend!! You reached the goal you set out for.... NO MORE PAIN!! So proud of you! God bless you and your loved ones and I wish you a  Merry Christmas💓 💓
Incredible
Lindsey, you make being suspended by your hair look effortless!  Your performance is truly a testament to how hard you've worked to be able to do it.  Absolutely stunning!
This is amazing!!! You are so talented! 😃  (The previous video is epic)
I hope that you have more than your neck supporting you.  Thank you for sharing your talent.
This is an insane performance, never seen such a performance and don't want to see one from you again. I was feeling the pain by just sitting down and watching your performance. I can't even imagine what were you going through. Massive respect.
Very incredible Lindsey!!! I'm absolutely blown away by the levels you will go to with your performances. Just know that if you feel you reached your limit, no one will hold it against you! You are an amazing performer, we love you!!!❤❤❤
Beautiful! But never do it again!
As much as these comments are positive and lovely, some (most I've seen on tiktok Or on the vlog video) just commenting on her pain or how "she didnt look happy". She did something probably nobody else could or would do. She didn't have to, but she wanted to. Yes it was painful for her and she cried about it, but like what the heck!!! People, look what this girl has achieved by simply just saying, hey I want try doing this.... And through all the times she said to herself it was impossible or she wanted to give up, look how AMAZING and beautiful this performance is!!!  For most of us, it's easy to give up or doubt ourselves on our goals, especially during a time like this - she's showing you all that no matter how painful life is you can really do anything!! And through the pain there is beauty. Of course we don't want our amazing Lindsey to be hurt or in pain because we care, but seeing ALL the comments saying " Never do this again" "Looks painful" "She doesn't look happy" It all just seems so negative when she worked so hard and I bet you she feels proud of herself and happy of her result!!! I mean, who else can learn how to do this, learn choreographed moves for this, all while playing the violin spinning crazy in air like that in only a matter of 3 months?!??!!! It's amazing and something she should be praised for!!! What an amazing accomplishment Lindsey. Beautiful video, keep knocking down those insane goals of yours!!! You're doing amazing as always!!! Above and beyond!!!
Amazing such a tough woman love her style music and her courage you go girl love ya ❤ 🤍 💙 🧡
Lindsey, such a video should be done in 4K
So much pain You go through... I hope it was worth it
vaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Sehr schön, ich stelle mir gerade vor wie das wohl aussieht wenn man das Kabel digital entfernt und die Kamera in der totalen bleibt.
Amazing! You did it! WTG!
Merry Christmas Lindsey! Mission accomplished. Never again love. Angel❤️
You're at the top of your game Lindsay.  Now please stop putting yourself thru so much physical pain.  Working hard is great.  Torture is done now, right?
Yeah... kind of have to go with the majority on this, it was beautifully painful to watch this performance. Between this and the Vlog there's something uncomfortable that overshadows the sense of accomplishment. You doing pointe in ballet for that one music video was very impressive, but even to the trained eye it looked painful.  I understand wanting to challenge yourself... maybe ice skating while playing the violin instead?  (Who am I kidding, that's probably just as dangerous?)  EDIT: Interesting, it looks like there's at least one person out there who can ice skate and play the violin.
Wow, I cant even. Beautiful
Me encanta esta canción, pero todo el video me la pasé pensando lo mucho que le debe doler la cabeza cuando termina de interpretarla :(
Merry Christmas!! Ksll
My girl!!!!!!!!!
F$&@ing awesome!!!!!
Потрясающе)))
I have tears every time you go up. The results of your training is such a beauty. You're such an inspiring person. I hope the love we give you in return is enough ( I know you'll say yes but... Still). Love you Lindsey. 💙
Rompes reglas, innovas,   wow, wow, eres increíble, cada vez te admiro más!
Lindsey you never ever fail to amaze me 😭🔥🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 Your hard work learning this trick/routine is phenomenal! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Молодец!
As an aerialist myself (but not a hair-ialist) this is AMAZING and so beautiful. My jaw hit the floor when I saw you learned this in such a short time. Not sure why there are so many negative comments here asking "why"... THIS performance is why! You had a vision and you executed it beautifully!
This whole hair hanging thing is actually a thing?!?  That looks like torture!  How about something a little more humane?  Like playing the violin while hacky-sacking a live kitten?!?
You don’t need to do this... really, you don’t need...
I’m in awe. My jaw is on the floor. Humans are incredible and capable of so much. Go Lindsey!
You are amazing!!! God bless you Lindsey =) Merry Christmas
Is sooo beautifuuul Lindseyy KSLL❤❤ The stirlingites are proud of youu  Our goodnees  So proud of you¡! You have done a really beautiful work and dedication¡! You did the Impossible ¡!¡!
Double WOW !!!
Simply amazing and beautiful. You’re the bomb Lindsey!
Wow YOU DID IT!!!! You are amazing!! Anything you decide you want to do, you do it!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Wooww!!! Maravilloso!! Lindsey eres  Arte,pasión,inspiración tienes un gran y único don,me he quedado así 😱😱😱 me Inspiras eres única...🎻🎶🎻🎶❄💙💓💓💓❤❤❤👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💯💯💯💯💯
Please Lindsey... Don't hurt you for us or for the show. We don't want that. Even it's beautiful and hardwork, as an old belgian fan I rather to see you the next year (or following if it stay complicated) with your smile and amazing colored hair in good condition, jumping everywhere without this pein (or determination whatever ) on the face. It makes me sad even it was beautiful, it's too much. Best wishes for you, for your family and team. ❤️
I admire your tenacity and endurance, but much prefer your other videos where you look happy and are having fun!
😘🥰🥰🥰
Класс
Thought I wouldn't get to see what she worked so hard for.  Looks amazing! Would love to see do something similar that's less painful, like a full body harness on a bungee. I could get used to seeing her dance through the air a lot.
Lindsey, this is absolutely amazing. I'm in awe. Wow!!!
My scalp is hurting just watching.  Great performance like always.
Really good job Lindsey!   To each his own on the like/dislike, but COME ON, what didn't you like about it?? This was an amazing feat that she chose to fight and Overcome!   Enough said. Keep up the amazing work Lindsey 😁
producers: what do you want to do for this video?     lindsey: I want to be a snowflake.
세상에...언니 너무 멋져요 나 소름돋았어ㅠ 빙상 위의 요정같아.....
Vraiment une très belle performance! bonnes fêtes !
Wow........
THIS IS TRULY AMAZING ⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘
I cried. I loved it and hearing how much pain and work you put into making this piece just made me cry (happy cry). Good on you girl.
Thanks for clarification. Now I get why did you hanged yourself on hair. Looks like it worth it.  I have impression, that you are slowly approaching Dethclok levels of epic IRL.
Супер!
Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
Lindsey, we love you & respect your dedication as an artist and wanting to push the envelope. But please, never do this again...the pain was not worth it. While the routine was amazing, we could see that it wasn't just the look of determination we were seeing - we also saw you preparing for the pain that would come. Honestly, no one would have blamed or be disappointed by you if you chose not to do the hair hanging routine. Again, we love you!!
Very beautiful, but very dangerous! And it must be painful. My heart was dying. Very beautiful.
WHAT? THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!😭😭❤️
That was amazing. It seems almost like a dream or a hallucination.
I understand as an artist you try to stay relevant and try new things while playing an old favourite.  Personally I took no enjoyment in this. The song is a classic and will forever be 1 of my favourites, but at no point would I want you to attempt this again. You learned this in record time, and pulled it off magnificently. No one is going to deny this. However, I personally don’t want to see you get hurt. This is pretty much borderline. The public loves you and the Stirlinglites will always be here for you. You have nothing to prove to us. ❤️ Take care of yourself and your loved ones. Have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!  🎄 🎁
Simplemente majestuoso saludos y abrazos desde México esto es hermoso💖💖💖
に、日本人の方は... いらっしゃらないですか〜
I cried ! She is so beautiful so graceful powerful empowering magnificent!
She is now prepared if she ever gets into a catfight and the other girl starts pulling on Lindsey's hair, she will become totally immune.
Amazing!!!
Beautiful, but owwwwww!!!!  That would have ripped my head or hair right off.  Not sure which would've popped off first. 😂
😭😭😭
👏👏👏👏👏

Absolutely stunning
She looks incredibly tired and amazing at the same time. I am really amazed at how she still kept going.👏👏👏
lindsey is incredibly talented.
Can't beat a Classic, Wonderful and  Amazing Performance! Too bad the energy and love of a Live-audience was not able to see it in person.
Линдси это было супер и именно с этого трека я узнал тебя)
Well done for this performance Beautiful and magic Love you Lindsey
❤️👏❤️👏❤️👏❤️👏 THAT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MAGICAL DANCE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!  I am so sorry that you had to go through all that pain and torture, it broke my heart watching your  journey to get here, to see you go through all of that. 💔😟 BUT OH MY GOODNESS!!!! WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MAGNIFICENT PAYOFF!!!!!!!!! YOU ARE SO INSPIRING!! TO SEE HOW DEDICATED YOU ARE TO YOUR PASSION!!!  THANK YOU! GOD BLESS YOU!!!  YOU ARE AMAZING!!!!!! ❤️🙌❤️🙌❤️
This is pure beauty and inspiration. Loved it!
Winning Physics !
It was a beautiful performance; but it seemed clear to me that you did not enjoy it as much as you might have liked, or wanted to.  The fear or pain or concentration; whatever it was for you, showed up in the performance. It was apparent you weren't comfortable doing it. You are an amazing musician. I'd rather see you dancing to the beat of your own violin; smiling and happy. This was uncomfortable to watch at times. Innovative, & mesmerizing, yet not enjoyable. At least for me. I love your music though Lindsey, you are really talented.
Just delight and shock from this performance💖👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼. I watched the vlog as she studied and trained Hair Hanging, and was shocked (in a good way) о.о. I sincerely admire Lindsey, her strength, willpower, determination and skill💖. Throughout the video I wanted to give a standing ovation and tears welled up from shock and admiration with delight💖👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
You did an AMAZING job!  I'm so proud of your dedication in performing and showing your God-given musical and dance gifts! I saw your video on how rough the journey was for you!  Again, I'm so proud of you for giving 1,000%!!!
Wow!!! Amazing!!! This is incredible!!!
Watching this makes MY hair hurt!!!! Really pretty. Now don't do this again please! I had to shut my eyes. Ouch!
😱👏👏👏👏🎊
I could see this performance tied with #pink ribbon performance.  Absolutely stunning.
crazy hair~
Se nota el trabajo que tuvo que realizar y debo decir que es una magnífica persona y de tu forma de tocar que se ha vuelto única
Eres Brillante, eres Hermosa!!! Admiró tu trabajo, tú eres una de las grandes inspiraciones que tengo al tocar el violín, con la combinación de baile 💖!
So grateful to see your every performance even in a video 😋
супер
knowing what she´s gone through to make this, makes me appreciate this even more then usual...lindsey is just magical at everything she does
Perfect.
Lindsey your determination knows no bounds, you carry on when so many others might have simply given up, even when things seem bleak. You have always worked so hard to achieve your goals and your dreams, and we are so proud of you. In all your endeavors, we will be cheering you on. Every tour, every album, every challenge, every struggle, we will stand with you You're such an inspiration to me and to so many others, and I hope that you continue to reach for the stars and beyond <3 But also please give yourself a break after all of that hard work. You have earned it ten times over if you ask me.
It's rare to see an artist's determination so boldly presented. Often we only see the final product, practiced and refined until they could do it without much thought or expression. But this was different; you can see the struggle, the pain, the fear. And you can see the need to *do*.
Nice 😍👍🎆
Woooow amazing!
Te quiero hermana bien !!! From Rosario Argentina your brother in Zion
I watched this before I watched the vlog and, wow! I know it was hard and it hurt, but it looked so natural in the video!!! Well done!!!
Ouch
I know how very hard that was for you and I am so impressed that you powered through it and created something so breathtaking beautiful. I had chills throughout that whole thing.
Браво💐Линдси ты великолепна, твоё творчество безумно красивое, скрипачка и гимнастка, все идиное целое, ты умничка🎉🌹🔥❤️💝
Well this  tops every other video on YouTube Lol
AAAAAAAAAAAA! HOW!??? IT'S IMAZING!!!! LINDSEY! YOU ARE IMAZING!!!!! BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful.  Amazing. Truly a statement of your talent. I miss seeing you this year for Christmas! Stay safe and maybe on the ground.
I have dreamed this time, but I did not imagine that you would be that dream come true. Beautiful
Congratulations on fighting through the fear and pain sweetheart!
I did not expect you to go that far off the ground! You worked so hard. I’m so glad it paid off!
Beautiful!!
I wish I could do that..... no, I mean I wish I had hair so I could do... that!   All kidding aside Lindsey, hard to believe that wasn't prerecorded. You are just amazing and Happy holidays.
That was amazing.
Линдси, ты делаешь невероятные вещи, и продолжаешь всех удивлять! Но сколько сил на это ушло? Надеюсь для тебя оно того стоило. Счасливого Нового года!
This is amazing! that was so nice!  she deserved "ling ling honour" !  <3
You never fail to amaze on every level! You are fantastic! But don’t feel you need to hurt yourself for our sake! We are happy to be graced with your talent!
wow. amazing
Wow. Y'know, this really brings back some memories. The original song was the 13th video I ever favorited, nearly 7 years ago when I first joined youtube. Very cool to hear it again, it's one of my favorites.
Saw you years ago in VA in concert with Paramore. Truly fabulous and phenomenal. My favorite part was your testimony and the memo on never giving up on your dreams. So inspiring! I wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year Love!
As amazing as this video was it was hard to watch knowing the pain and suffering you went through just to make it.
Artist like you inspire artist like me it's good have inspiration like you. Thanks for my inspiration 🥰😍❤🙏🏼
AWESOME 😇😇😇😇😇 I AM  VERY INSPIRING YOUR 💖💖  MAGICAL MUSIC 💖💖  🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄WE WISH YOU MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU MY💖 DEAR💖 LINDSEY MAM
LINDSEY I’M LITERALLY SO PROUD OF YOU. This was beautiful and magical and elegant. You have such grace and poise it’s amazing to me. You never cease to amaze me. I got chills as I watched. I can’t believe how far you’ve come.
I'd just like to point out: The gymnasts who do this for a living for the likes of Cirque du Soleil trained for years before their hair, head, neck, and scalp were all strong enough to not feel the pain. Lindsey, you did this in only a few months. While that is a remarkable achievement, I honestly believe it was reckless in the extreme to push yourself so hard.  That being said: Push on. Slow down a little, don't push yourself so hard, but keep it up. In another 12 months, it won't hurt anywhere near as bad. Take your time. I hope to see you in the air live at one of your shows soon, but only when it no longer causes you pain.
I'll never look at a carillon the same way
I know there was a deep, personal cost for learning this skill to share an expression of yourself that is so otherworldly and beautiful that it makes my soul ache. You did it ❤️ And I feel the weight of it. I get it. Thank you for sharing your light.
This so breathtaking and incredible! That being said, I have sooo many questions...
ya no words. I tried. Truly am happy to have sight.
This physically pains me.
Bravo
Oh my gosh! I got emotional watching this! When you took that breath i could hear you giving yourself a pep talk and then you totally knocked that last part of of the park! I'm so grateful you included the breathing.... It spoke so loudly on your tenacity and strength to do this!!! ❤️❤️❤️
My neck hurts, but my ears are happy.
I’m so glad you didn’t give up  You did so wonderful and a beautiful performance 🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😘
Luv it, it's like a F you to the America's got talent judges...Bravo!
Massive respect for doing this. But next time use a harness which looks less painful. Beautiful song though. Hope to see you next year in Perth.
Her face says “COURAGE “
wonderful video 🥰🥰🥰🥰 hope you come to Mexico soon
Ты просто молодец. 👍👍
después de ver todo lo que entro , sufrió y lloro por esto que le quedara tan bonito es un wow  point de estasis en mi existencia
You did it Lindsey!!! You're amazing!!!!!
You did it, you did it, it was hard, the result was great.  You didn't have to do it for us, your content is still great but you may have done it for yourself and if so you are a wonderful woman.  She keeps dreaming and never give up.
I saw her TikTok videos of her practicing this, IT WAS NOT EASY, many people commented on why was she even trying. I don’t think they understood Lindsay Stirling IS THE DEFINITION OF QUALITY PERFORMANCE. She did this because she knew she could do it. STUNNING 🤩
Wait wait wait girl r u hanging from the ceiling by the ponytail of ur hair and doing a ballet dance wow Lindsey I just love u more
Amazing job girl, you nailed it!! You did it and I'm proud of you for pushing through all you endured for this, and thank you for this awesome performance 😊
🤩🤩🤩
Bravo! Волшебно! Чудесное исполнение!
Wooow.... After such a clip, I am even breathless, speechless, without any reaction ... Just incredible !! <3 <3 <3
Why is this chick so freaking amazing!!!!! I still remember when this song came out all those years ago I was such in awe that someone could sound this amazing and dancing just adds to the level of beast you are. Everyone tells you in life to choose one thing you’re good at and you chose not to listen and pursue both. You are such an inspiration Lindsey, thank you!
Desde Colombia, 👏felicitaciones, "persistir, insistir y nunca desistir"
I feel bad for everybody who scrolled past this without clicking because WOW.
Lindsley is a legendary show.  What you did was extremely difficult.  I hope you will make history and everyone will know you.  But never, ever risk your health.  I saw your pain and my heart aches, it is not worth suffering like this.  Let the angels protect you.  I love you, your fan
Stunning, amazing, sooo much talent. I loooooove this 🥰🥰🥰
amazing....she put all her soul and being into this performance and it is just breath taking
This performance is absolutely incredible.
amazing Lindsey. Keep pushing your boundaries. But honestly I’d feel more comfortable watching you do this on normal guy wires with a normal stunt coordinator.
Amazing performance 👏
I honestly want to know why people left a dislike. That was sensational
Awesome, awesome, awesome, that was amazing, beautifull, full motivation and concentration, only You can do that. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Flying in the air wasn't easy by the ring in the hair.
So amazing!! So happy you saw thru the pain and did this. Absolutely beautiful, darling. You look just....ahhhh....lol
Ok but how
There is all in blue on the background and blue means love with americans.
Eres la mejor te amoooo
ЕЁ повесили за волосы? это ужасно, ребята
To characterize that performance as amazing would be a gross understatement.  You are. . .
Tough training leads to a beautiful show! Look you can tell.  Very inspirational as well.  Thank you Lindsey for helping a lot of us push through 2020.
Bravo Bravo Bravo ...
Linsey Stirling: *hangs by hair* 2020: "this is fine"
Mis respetos, siempre innovando y haciendo lo mejor para sus fans
What incredible will you have dear. Amazing performance. ❤️❤️❤️
After watching her video of her learning to do this and the pain she went through, I was unsure if I would watch this. I stopped about a minute in because she isn’t smiling, there’s nothing but stress, pain and anguish on her face. Usually she’s nothing but smiles when playing. She didn’t need to do this; maybe for internal gratification but not for her fans.
2020 mood..we're hanging on by a hair.
Офигенно!!!!!! Very very cooL!!!!
Twisting so high is quite dangerous.
You can be arrested. You're making pain to your own body. 😯
She looks like a beautiful dancing ornament for a Christmas tree.
This is worth it to the cirque du soleil! amazing lindsey! truly, bravo!
Just another chick likes her hair pulled Whats .new hsssss hsss
Looks like heaven's ballet,but a little painful.
You should definitely watch the vlog on her channel together with this performance. There is a much greater appreciation for what she is did. I cried with her during the vlog. Her commitment to performance and presentation is mind blowing. This was a huge sacrifice for her to present her art in this form. It reminded me of what the Savior went through for us when she wouldn't give up even though it was the hardest thing she has ever done.
Esto es demasiado perfecto para ser humano ✨♥️
Just, Wow... you are amazing Lindsey. After watching the Vlog, I am even more amazed at what this one performance means to you.
Молодец  👍
Phenomenal, Lindsey! You set a goal for yourself and more than achieved it.
It's like dancing tied to the heaven.
👏👏👏👏👏👏
That looks soooo FUN!
me quedé así :🙆‍♂️
Hanging by the hair is looking quite scary,bus sometimes art requires  sacrifice.
This is beyond amazing. Absolutely phenomenal. Your mental and physical strength is outstanding! What a true inspiration ❤️
She really inspires me to pay a violin.
Jesus... the bills must be stacking up.
OW!  It was beautiful to watch.  But I can only imagine how much that hurt.
круто 👏
Wow !!! Soo glad you toughed out the hanging lessons to give us this awesome performance
Мелодия отличная, исполнение шикарное. Но жестко.
Crystalize was a good video as well as song.
Holy cow!  Words can’t describe how amazing this performance was. So graceful! Her playing is amazing!  Looks like it hurt
It shows that Lindsey Stirling will go to great lengths for the sake of her art. It's pretty amazing and awe inspiring, the focus and her expression to keep herself from showing any pain or discomfort well there is no words for it.  Her performance was outstanding, and humbling after seeing her vlog of journey to get from point A to Point B.  Let's bring that energy to 2021.
YOU ARE ONE OF A KIND!!! That was an awesome performance. Thank you!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Ow that looks painful was it?
Мазахистка что ли? Совсем девка сдурела...
Wuaoo 😮 Lindsey i love you!! Is fantastic !! ♥️♥️
WOW!!!
😱 trop fort 💪
Wow. Athlete!!!
I have seldom seen such concentration and focus in a face.  She's enough of a performer that I can't tell if that is performance or real concentration, but it's so different from the joy she usually projects.
I feel like a physical therapist should be on call.
Wow! Amazing! Thank you Lindsey...
Amazing😍
This is choreography from Danila Bim in Volta💕
After watching your vlog on the struggles of preparing for this, I got super emotional watching this amazing and artistic performance. I'm so thankful you were able to see how strong you are, we are truly blessed by the light and hope you bring into this world!
Охеренно
It's such a beautiful song. Many memories in my life... Amazing performance too... God bless you! and Merry Christmas!
Stunning!!!! 💜🎶💜
THIS IS AMAZING
Wow! That was amazing!! I also kept thinking, "owwwwww," especially when it lifted up so high... 😮
This masterpiece deserve a million view!!
THAT WAS AMAZING...
❤❤❤❤❤Breath taking and beautifull and so talented i would have been so dizzy 😵 Great job 👏 i love you keep it up i wish nothing  but the best for you ❤
Bem crazy rs
I really hope she's on Masked Dancer
I don't care how beautiful it was. Please don't do that again!
This was absolutely incredible!  I have never seen something so crazy!  Please though, don't put yourself through something so rough again.  This must have hurt so much.
It must've hurt so much ☹️
Strong hair
Not sure how anyone can do that while also playing the violin. It is incredible! You keep pushing your envelope and excelling in ways no one else can. When the rest of the world is sitting around waiting for things to happen, you are inspiring us to get up and do better than we did yesterday. It doesn't get any better than Lindsey. You were out of breath doing, and I was out of breath watching. Your concentration is second to none.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Highly Talented, Resilient, Not afraid of pain... I bow to you!
I too have no words to discribe just how awesome this is.
You must use good shampoo
👌👌👌👌😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ah the classics, you go girl and have fun. Cheers.
Amazing display of musical talent and acrobatic skill. Incredible but also a bit heart wrenching. No one likes seeing you in pain do please make this a once only performance. 🙏
WOW!!!
That's perfect peformance but don't make a paint because we love you Lindsey Stirling
Pain can become power.  Pain, properly channeled and motivated, can transform us in the most powerful versions of ourselves.
You’re INSPIRING!!!!! You NEVER gave up even when you wanted to!!! I cried with pain when I saw the clips of you practicing, but you worked through the hardest parts and overcame them and then When I saw this I cried with Joy and Happiness! God Bless You! Thank You for such an INSPIRING video!!!! Can’t wait to see what other things you WILL Conquer!!! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS and YOUR DEVOTION!!!!
Wow, that was amazing. Such a talented, beautiful woman
Она оказалась круче чем мы думали... Какой талант, какое изящество.. эти трюки в разы сложнее чем мы можем себе представить, а она держалась очень мужественно ❤️🤯❤️
That is scary but amazing. Wow
Que clase de brujería es esta? 😏
Amaizing, next time I'll see you playing under water.
I want to point out that she did this in THREE MONTHS.  Most hair hanging aerialists take years to be able to do this routine.  She did it in THREE MONTHS with a VIOLIN.  That wasn't just pain on her face, it was the determination to overcome fear and pain and to DO the thing she set out to do.   As a chronic pain sufferer,  i felt very connected to this because I get up every day and DO even though it hurts, even though i might feel like my body is on fire and I am weak.  That determination in her eyes is *everything*.  Maybe she can smile the next time she does the performance or maybe she never does it again.   Doesn't matter, she set her mind to it and did it.  And overcoming that pain and fear is the most beautiful part for me.
Линдси как всегда хороша, но кому идея пришла за голову её подвесить? Но сильно конечно.
Precioso❤
Love seeing the circus arts incorporated. So much talent all around. How long did you train for that routine?
Eso se vio INCREÍBLE!! Cada vez te vas superando y venciendo cada reto. Te admiro, eres mi ejemplo a seguir Lindsey Stirling ¡Eres GENIAL!  Te Adoro!!!
I mean... That's one way to achieve a face lift. 😳
Congratulations on achieving your goal! I watched your vlog and that made me appreciate your performance so much more, knowing how you pushed yourself towards this, and how your faith carried you just when you were about to give up.
Where are the dubstep bassssss😥😥
I first heard this searching dubstep the original popped up since then prob about a year ago not stopped listening to this amazing beautiful music that this stunning woman makes. Keep up the amazing work, keep entertaining and have a great xmas and new year u beautiful woman
I was in pain for you the entire time. This was incredible and you never need to do it again.
Sorry but if a harness is not in use here, this is disgusting!
That was beautiful 👏🌹👏🌹👏🌹
🤯WHAT in the follicles made of steel did I just watch!?!?!
This is living proof angels exist, and that they dont need wings to soar in the heavens. I know how much you struggled training for this lindsey, and believe me every second was worth it. Keep soaring, you can guide so many to god by your music & your dedication to us all
Iindsey grew a inch after this one.   the orig was  epic.
Just when you think that Lindsey can't impress you anymore she goes and does something that would make the strongest of us mentally break down and cry in agony.  This woman is a Phenomenon of Epic proportions.  Her talent is only surpassed by her dedication to her craft.
Cool video but it's the same music over and over need new material
Bravo
Mission possible. You best in the best.✌️👍
Speechless... So beautiful.. amazingly astounding.. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💜💙💜💙💜💙
it is just tooooooooooooooo muuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccccccch 3:01
I have no words 😍😍
Incredible
WOW that was an amazing performance.  I couldn't imagine the concentration and dedication you went through on this video shoot.  As a huge fan that blew my mind.  At end of video you looked exhausted 😴.   Please don't overexert yourself like that. We love you and your music and everyone that helps you along in you journey to bring the world such wonderful music and videos. ☃️Have Wonderful  ☃️ and safe Christmas 🎄 Holidays with your loved ones ❤
Beautiful. Amazing. Inspiring. You did the hard thing. Thank you for reminding me that I can too.
So incredible! seriously just breathtaking. Well done! Keep doing what you do best! Your music is one of a kind.
o.o  'o'
😎🔥
Ahora que valla a god talent jejejeje seguramente les gustará a los jueces después de que la rechazaron la primera ves  Ahora no creo que la rechacen y seguro an de decir o era la que rechazamos y a cresido y su fama se a extendido jejejeje  Nice video
Amazing and beautiful!
So Now You are a Puppet 😪😢
Oooooooow
True there was a lot of pain in her face... But what I SAW was strength, perseverance and resolve.
Good job
Say how when taken by the hair you are💬
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OUCH
Que hermosa ❤️👌
That sounds familiar 😉
Like always, you make the impossible, possible Lindsey. Thank you for making an impact and being an inspiration to so many lives. Including mine, if I didn't find you, I would've never played the violin. Thank you so much and merry Christmas Stirling.
Amazing...
I only see pain and hear pain
Молодец! Справилась
There is no need of doing this again. You've already achieved excellency in this activity.
wow.... genial ¡¡¡¡¡  no pasó ni un minuto y  simplemente quede impactado , no solo por ese ligero cambio en la música , sino por toda esa actuación que nos brindaste , gracias lindsey ¡¡¡ buen trabajo ¡¡¡
my head hurts just watching this
This was gorgeous and should go viral. I've loved this song for an age.
I think this is the only video of Lindsey I won't be able to enjoy. I couldn't even watch pass the middle. I think it's great that people push themselves to accomplish what they want, but this was dangerous and I can't stop thinking about how she could have broken her neck...  Please Lindsey, don't do anything like this again, there's no need to, you are amazing without doing crazy stunts like this :(
Linsdey you are big ,you are awesome, I remember when I saw you for the first time in youtube with this song "Crystallize"💜💜
I was crying while watching this video. Just looking at her face the moment after she performed, I can really tell that she is super proud. And that makes me the proudest person in the planet. From the Philippines here. Lindsey is the one who inspired me and made buy my own violin 4 years ago. Til now, i was still practicing 💙
She's got strong hair follicles. I'd be bald 1 min in.
Congrats! You did it!
next time wear a harness,  nobody can perform again if injured
hey just making autopromotion shamelessly lul. I make some art too but am still a beginner on digital art, I am good on traditional paper art tho, here is my patreon  :  https://www.patreon.com/Apocryphaa
I think this is her most stunning performance. Her resilience through this entire process is incredible. 💖
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😍😍😍😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️
She’s done it again! From the first song I’ve heard from her lol 😆 🔥
Феерия 👍❤️💋
Stunning, is there nothing you can’t do? Absolutely stunning!
This was amazing! ♡^♡ Definatly the best performance I've seen. The amount of training that it must've took to be able to tolerate the pain. I admire your dedication X3
WoW es hermoso nunca había visto algo así en mi vida, enserio eres increíble te amó ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Just WOW.  I had to watch it a number of times.  Every time I started watching, my eyes would tear up.  Lindsey you are an Angle and a treasure for all of us to watch.
Dancing wasn't enough so she is flying now.
Outstanding!
Looks incredible and painful
Amazing job, art, love & music in movement. Amazing ❤️
She can play this song in her sleep.  Might as well make her do it airborne.
This needs to be # 1 trending right now. This is a true masterpiece.
*THE TRAINING HAS PAID OFF!*
You are amazing!!!! I don't have words for this!!!! Uaaaauuuu  incredible incredible incredible  Congratulations 👏👏👏👏
WOW!
WH😱A.
This was beautiful, stunning, gorgeous, dont even have words...but one thing...ouch.
Fantastic performance! I have so many questions about the logistics of this.
I do not comment often, however this is absolutley stunning. Your performance is incredible and all the hard work/pain was absolutley worth the result! This prrformance is ABSOLUTE. Congrats on such a wondetful accomplishment!❤❤❤❤❤
Don't know if is just me but this performance made me cry, I think in part is because I was a contemporary dancer in progress, but I stopped acrobatics and contemporary because I hurt my neck really bad :(, now I am still a dancer but, I do other dance genres like Mexican régional dance, Spanish flamenco or a bit of contemporary but I no longer do tricks or acrobatics :(, I think this made me sad, and also i felt overwhelmed, I don't know why but Lindsey seems really stressed or heart broken in this video, asides from her physical pain, I think she is actually sad, it just make me feel sad, even tho the performance is out of this world. 🙇🏻‍♀️😔🖤
So Amazing!!!!
So inspiring in so many levels: aligning what you feel in your heart & God. Finding ways to shut down those little voices preventing you to see your true talent even when things seem to get hard & harder. 💜💜💜
I kinda wonder is that supposed to hurt 😐
Kuddos!! Love it! Beat your head felt heavy after all of that.  P.s. my 4 yr old thinks that you're a Princess. She's a fan!!
Did you do it in one take?... you magnificent, talentet, smart and beautiful MANIAC ! that look so dangerous and painful you already have or attention please stop it.
You have come a long way little warrior. You are one of few who are but a flame within the darkness. Continue to burn bright within the hearts of the world. Happy holidays
So amazing!!!
We do not deserve this... but I'm grateful
Sow😍me encanta 😍 todo me encantaa la coreografía la forma en q toca todo shee😍👍
Crystallize was the first of your videos that I ever saw and has been my very favorite. This version is simply amazing! You are incredibly talented!
Incredible!
I feel like I need to put some ice on my head... I'm awed by her flexibility, still. This is very impressive even without the heart wrenching hair hanging. I REALLY like this version of Crystalize, I think I like it better than the original.
Умничка, как это ей всë тяжело давалось. Респект. 👏👋
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏❤️
😍💗💗💗💐
Wow! When brushing my thick hair, sometimes I go ouch! Just brushing.
Simplemente bellísima y extraordinaria como siempre guau y Super mega guau
WOOOW! Unbelievable! Stunning! Incredible! What a beautiful song, what a beautiful creation!
So much talent and beauty in one person. Amazing music with breathtaking videos to go with it. Always love to watch them. I just wish there was a concert near Gilbert, AZ.
I am so amazed by your strength and determination, having been so close to giving up but sticking to your guns and accomplishing such an incredible feat of strength! So proud of you!
She is so good it makes me cry
I <3 you
AMAZING !!! Now never do that again - watching those previous videos of you being in so much pain made me cry..........  YOU MADE IT - the outcome is AMAZING BALLS well done !!!
Thank you for your dedication to your craft. The emotion on your face was incredible. I saw your video on the pain this caused and the emotional toll it took.  Thank you for what you bring to this world.  The amount of beauty brought about by your pain makes gives me hope for the future with the pain we've all gone through this year to think of the beauty that may come and I hope we all appreciate things a little more going forward. You are incredible!
The first song I heard and my favorite, that was Amazing!!
that was amazing.
Me: there’s no way Lindsey could become more talented then she already is. This: ..........................
I can not believe she did that she is so brave 😲

All those years girl you killed it. I can only imagine the feeling you felt as you ended the song it’s shown all over your face you achieved what you believed was the impossible girl 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Oh my gosh you did it!!! I knew you could. I watched the video when you were just learning how to do that and how hard it was. Good job 👍 Merry Christmas Lindsey ❤️
Talk about  multitalented! Orchestra or Cirque du Soleil?! Model?! Well Done Lindsey!!
Perfeiçãoooo
How not to love you? Showing us how persevering thru the pain we can achieve such beauty. I don't know if you would read this but thank you for shine so bright despite such darkness upon us, thanks for leading the way of the brave that doesn't hide the fear but instead confront them face to face. Simply just thank you
I love it its so dramatic! The song, the hair hanging, the spinning, gave me so much anxiety that you might get hurt but OHH I knew you can always pull it off! The suspense worked wonders. That last part 2:38 just, wait for it... and OHHH.
Amazing, fabulous. Tu es une artiste  extraordinaire. Magnifique performance.
Lindsey; You are just amazing!  You see an obsticle and just masters it! 😍 You are an artist of a very special class that few if any ever reach!  Never stop breaking bounderies and challenge what is possible!
I thought this was cool before watching your vlog prepping for this shoot ... now, wow!  Bravo brave one! Bravo!
Your is amazing fabolous saludos desde Mexico
speechless, wow
Wow.
Glad to you got through the doubt and fear about doing this. Loved it from beginning to end. You played amazing even with the difficulty of the hair swing. 🤯🎄 I hope you have a great holiday season, and be safe. That hair swing stuff is why I am balding. Ok not really
The determined look right before the first time you got pulled up in the air.......you can tell you were telling yourself you could do it and just working through the pain. It was an amazing performance and you did fantastic!! One more check off the bucket list!!
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up dear ones. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of Fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
You said - "I can do this". And you did this Ты сказала - "Я могу сделать это". И ты сделала это.  It's incredible Это невероятно
Amazing!!!! ❤
Your poor scalp 🥺
Lindsey, THAT was Truly AWESOME!!!!!  WONDERFUL!!!  BEYOND BRAVO!!!!  WAY Beyond!!  I Seriously Doubt ANYONE will Ever TOP That Fantastic Performance!!   BUT - we SEE the Pain in your lovely face, and that gives US pain, too.  We all know the Dedicated High Caliber of Professional that you are.   Please - you DON'T need to go to that extreme again!  Even so, let This Performance be Written in the Record Books for ALL Time!!   Merry Christmas.  Much Love, Jerry N.
Вау! Вау! Линдси это было потрясающе! Ты такая молодец! С замиранием смотрела выступление!
She finally did it 😍😍 reaaly made me inspired 🥰🥰🤩
Ouch ! Why I feel bald now..
Just amazing!  I don’t know how you will top this performance!  Well done!!!
2010: (America's Got Talent)          Pierce Morgan -- "You are not good enough"  2020 : (Home for the holidays)          Lindsey -- "How about this 😂😂"  Now, please don't put yourself through so much pain. Thanks a Ton Lindsey for pulling off the remarkable and we all love you 3000 😘😘😘
That is absolutely insane and amazing!!!!!!!! Lindsey you showed me that you can push yourself and that inspires me and brings me joy 😊🎉🎄
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Wow did you catch the heavy breathing at the end was some of that pain
👍🌹
In tears
Girl you need to team up with P!nk!!! That would be phenomenal 👏 😍 🙏☮
YESSSS AMAZING QUEEN
I am so sorry, i disliked it...the pain...its unbearable to look at your eyes in the video its the first time i see you hurt...
parabéns! Show!
You're amazing 👏 💖
Me sorprende mucho su dedicación  y aún más esta presentación
I know how painful it was to make this video happen. I want you to know that you are an amazing person!!! You are an idol and you are someone to be looked up too. Your struggles have not gone unnoticed!! We love you!!!
Chills.. wow
Не могу пройти мимо, слишком красиво получилось, слишком сильно. Спасибо огромное за работу ♥️♥️♥️🤗✊
This was cool, and I'm proud that you accomplished the goal you set for your self. However I beg you to never do this again, I don't want you to hurt yourself.
What an incredible performance!!!! Wow.
So how many painkillers were you on again?
Lindsey, you are such an inspiration; not only through your craft but by including us on your journey to create. I believe your vlog was just as beautiful as the actual performance and I am proud of you for committing and achieving your goal! You have an army of supporters who will always be with you in everything you do <3 <3 <3
that was absolutely unreal i am speechless..
🥺🥺 le falto el dubstep
Absolutely stunning!!!
😱😱😱 spectacular ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is so incredible and the journey you took to get to this point is sooo inspiring!
I lost my uncle to cancer early this year. Today is his birthday he would have loved this. I cried through the whole performance. This was was all the emotion at the end of his life. Pain perseverance and beauty in the time we had. Thank you. It hurts but thank you.
Having seen your posts on practice, this is insane and shows such dedication to your craft.  Now give your hair, head, and neck a long break...
Wow! Just wow! That was an amazing performance under some pretty insane conditions. Thank you for sharing your art with us all, from the music, the dancing and the outstanding video production. Best holiday wishes Lindsey. ♥
She could've quit when Piers Morgan and Sharon Osbourne told her how she was not good enough and sounded like rats being strangled but said no. She could've given up when she tried to get her music and talent seen and people would walk by and ignore her, she could've given up when labels rejected her because they found her too different, she could've given up her values to "make it" but she refused to back down. She could've also given up when she struggled with anorexia and depression and believed she was not good enough but she refused to let those voices rule her life! She could've given up when she injured her rib on Dancing With the Stars and was touring at the same time but she worked through it. She could've given up here when it hurt her head and it made her scared but she fought through this and gave an amazing and unique performance for Crystallize!  I've been surprised and proud of her every time. Yes, she doesn't HAVE to do something but she will if she WANTS to. (And thankfully she had the support of professionals and people to help her with caring for her hair too)
Definitely started crying watching this. Amazing.
Totally amazing artist.  So daring and creative and versatile.
My scalp hurts.
Wow so creepy kinda
WOW !
😢
You did it! You live the "I can do hard things" mantra!
We're so proud you of. You continued despite your struggle. It was beautiful.
lindsey i love you💖
What shampoo do you use to get hairs of steel???
Good song 🎶🎶🎶🎶
скальп не снялся, и то хорошо 👍
👏👏👏👏
Amazing job. With the struggle that it took to get here it was an amazing performance.
🤩😍 🥰 Absolutely stunning and beautiful. You have such verve and flair!  That said, please do not ever be so hard on your body again!!
Amazing work! But it must be really painful. 😬 And how could she play the violin without a fault while spinning so fast in 3:04? She didn't get dizzy? Was it playback or she really did play it while doing the performance?? P.S. It's a miracle that she decided to cover her legs! 😆
WOW, just WOW
knowing the immense pain she went through I literally cried through the whole video, I was captivated by the beauty but feeling her pain in my heart. I almost couldn't watch it!
Nicely done!!!
😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
i just wanna say im a huge fan and i always knew she wasnt human.
Wow! This had me choked up throughout the entire performance and had goosies! Seeing the preparation and pain that went into this prior and the success that came from that perseverance. Your talent is just on a whole other level!! I am actually struggling to find the words to convey how this made me feel watching it. Outstanding, Mesmerizing, Flawless, Powerful... Thank you, Thank You! Much Love 💜
Bravo!
Love Lindsey but this is her worst idea ever.
Now get me unhooked from this thing! haha
Your Focus during this performance was truly amazing. But knowing that it was extremely painful and seeing the pain in your eyes was hard to watch.
I didn't see the behind the scenes video on this but just from the start where I saw the hook I just knew this had to be so painful. Had to be. Her performance was flawless and beautiful but I'm glad to read she's never returning to this. Well done lindsey! Always challenging yourself and breaking those challenges with flying colors, she's the only violinist I ever hope to see one day.
It's hurts just watching
Mixed feelings. Increasing your value/skill as a performer and the endurance placed on the body's performance should not be discounted. It's a struggle to maintain your peak physical shape.   To do what Lindsay Sterling does in general is very taxing on the body, and I am glad that she has shared a small part of that with us over the years AND even more impressed with her dedication to her art.   If she has chosen to do this for herself to push her boundaries, I can accept that; but I would be lying if I said that this didn't alarm me on some level as the level of pain and suffering done intentionally to herself makes me wince.
Amazing!!!
Este video lo es todo, no sólo por su musica, sino por su dedicación y su fuerza. La pasión de ella por hacer algo nuevo y maravilloso es fantastico. Realmente me conmueve.
If Lindsey is in pain, why should I be having fun or interest in watching this video?  What idiot makes Lindsay stand in cold water and break her neck?  The pleasure of this video is akin to medieval fun while burning a witch.
I can do that with the hair on my back (: Bravo! That's amazing stuff! Merry Christmas to you and yours! Thanks Blessings Peace :) Happy 2021! Johnny. (Love from San Diego)
How does one keep the vertebrae from separating?  Awesome skill though, very talented you are.
This video is gonna imprint i't self in the history of YT as one of the best😘
Beautiful Lindsey. I respect and admire you a lot. You are a great innovative artist.
Incredible. Wonderfull, really wonder woman. Bravo
It’s weird seeing you not smile in a video you can tell she was nervous about this
Your like an Angel...
Ох ты ж, как красиво... Глаз не оторвать, немного только волнительно наблюдать, как вас цепляют к тросу...
I saw this video before the prep one and I thought "wow, this looks so stressful but natural at the same time! She's amazing". When I saw the prep video, I saw all the pain, but couldn't stop thinking about how strong you are. I would've given up for sure!
Esperei tanto esse vídeo, muito obrigada por não desista!
But how you do that while spinning 🤩 you make me go dizzy
I seen you on the song red ribbon and listened to shatter me and look at where you are at now
That was an amazing video. Not sure what else can be said.
Безумная! Я не знал бояться или восхищаться.
Lockdown can either take the best or worst out of us. Please take care of yourself, protect yourself. Amazing performance!
words do not do justice to the beauty of the performance or the courage of the artist. But please do not put yourself through so much pain.
The amount of strength you have in your neck and head! Congrats on the big accomplishment, we all love to see you perform and do what you love (even if having to hold yourself by your hair is in that, and hey, that is a story you will get to tell!)!
My heart was racing while watching your video. And I'd say that Crystalize was the perfect choice. Happy Holidays, Lindsey. You deserve to have the best time in the world.
That was beyond insane!  Absolutely amazing!!
Knowing the pain that went into this just makes it all the more amazing.
Lindsey: Dancing and playing the violin is so 2019, I know let me hang by my hair and play it.  The world: stares with mouth open.
Probably the most painful rendition you ever did of this wonderful song. I loved the way you shared with us what you had to go through to accomplish this.  It did look and sound beautiful. Thank you Lindsey for all the beauty you bring to the world.
Simplemente  la mejor  Saludos desde México 🇲🇽  Te amamos 💖
What an awesome accomplishment!! My heart hurt with your struggles and training, but what a beautiful end result. Thanks for sharing the journey 💕
Doesn't that hurt your hair? Ouch!
Finally she finished her mission . Please don't do that again. I don't want to see u cry and get painful anymore. Finally you can fly when playing violin but I know it's hurt so much.
Lindsey, you have once again adapted, improvised and overcome!  But please, for the sake of those who adore and care, please, don't do that again.  It HURTS to watch you hurt!
Thanks 4 sharing; incredible job; wish i had the $ to buy your show.. not in the cards this crazy 2020 🤩
Simply Incredible.
I cry everytime I watch this. It is so beautiful.
Not just brave, but beautiful
Ouch!! 😣🤕
YOU DID IT! So Beautiful!
My head hurts just from looking at this... Freaking well done head of steel... Love this...
Espetacular, incrível Lindsay starling! Acompanhei seu treinamento! Coragem, perseverança e atitude, Deus abençoe seus espetáculos sua vida seus sonhos!
I look for half your mental and physical strength daily. You're so beautifully talented and even more so, strong. This performance is one of the most powerful I've ever witnessed. Unmatched.
The fact that you pushed through over a month of training to put together this fantastic video is incredible. You are so talented, so strong, and you inspire me and so many other people.
Alguém aqui do Brasil que também ama essa mulher?
I'm so proud of Lindsey <3
Ídola 😍🥰
God that was horrible to watch after seeing the training video. I watched how in pain and scared she looked at the beginning of the song and just thought, "Oh, Honey, why are you doing this to yourself? Why?" and I just cried throughout the video, because this journey feels like what I've been going through mentally the last four months while pretending to have it all together.  I can't.
Well done Lindsey. Well done.
That was such a beautiful and difficult performance!  Thank you for showcasing your breathtaking skills, but please take care of yourself and don't push yourself too hard.  You're such an amazing person! ❤️
If we can say the word "beautiful" has many meanings, this performance, this woman and her talent are three of them.
Girl, you nailed it. Watching it is painfull.
You play beautiful and the video is spectacular, but I can't stop thinking about the worry face that you see from the beginning to the end of the video. this time, I didn't enjoy it so much
Awesome 💜🌟💫✨
FAAAAKE!! Its amazing whay AI can do these days!
Algo nunca visto, increíble, impresionante y admirable. No me imagino el dolor de llegar a realizar esa legendaria presentación, que seguramente marca un antes y un después en tu carrera y quedará grabado en nuestros corazones, este historia de lucha hacia el éxito.
Not saying the violin while swinging
You did Amazing My Friend! Warrior!♡
My head hurt just watching. I kept looking for a harness but if there was one it was well hidden Like someone else has already said don't do this again
Your a goddess ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Look at you!! That was beautiful and amazing! You did it! You kept playing which impressed me the most! I love you woman!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hmmm 😒 Not sure why the cutest chic on earth. Has to do.  THIS. Nonsense
Absolutely incredible. Your determination is inspiring and appreciated. Such an amazing revisit on one of my favorites!
This is moment magnific .Tank you.
Show this to Piers Morgan and tell him to stuff it
LINDSEY, You are a beast!!!!!!!!!!!! A beautiful, talented, amazing, powerful beast!
I am utterly speechless with words. When I watched your last video, I felt your pain, agony, and moments. I was praying for you and with you. The only words I have to say is true admiration. Thank you.
i wonder what the judge of AGT will say when they see this struggle of her, her beautiful result, great music, etc :3 it's so beautiful  although... i think this performance will suit better in song of the caged bird... just opinion though
Magnificent
As humans, we see someone in pain and our natural instinct is to empathize and show compassion. On an innate level because pain is part of our senses, we condition ourselves to believe that all pain is bad. But what if the soul has the ability to grow tremendously through such pain, whether emotional or in this case physical pain? In my humble observation, Lindsey is showing us the mere resilience that lies within each of our own souls, which allows us to come out of the pain with the potential for massive, beautiful, and glorious transformation💖. What an amazing and beautiful thing to ponder! Lindsey has literally given us a gift by sharing this idea through a physical platform💜. Lessons learned: Our souls are truly resilient, just believe in yourself, and God/Source (or whatever you believe in) will take care of the rest. Much love to all and to you Lindsey, you truly are an Angel 💖
excused. i think that is very damgerous and i extremely appreciate ur infinity effort on music. i just worry that this action takes some risk. u are the best
😥👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😥😥♥️
Может, не следует так себя мучить?  Мелодия скрипки и так передаст все эмоции.
Seeing her hang from her hair made me uncomfortable tbh
my head hurt just thinking of having my hair used like that
I will say some of the two most amazing performers when it comes to live performances at least when I watch them and my opinion would definitely be Lindsey Stirling and Pink! Absolutely incredible and beautiful! Now how amazing would it be if both of them performed together!!!!.... Lindsay you have put so much hard work and dedication into what you do it's incredible and very admirable! I have been following you since before people really even know who you really were and I have seen the journey that you have gone through with the ups and down and I will say we are all so very proud of you!
los antiguos y nuevos artistas de música conocidos y  por conocer:  ya wey.jpg
TREMENDO!!! Sos una genia total aaah ( •̀ ω •́ )✧
不一樣的表現 贊 👍👍👍😍😍😍
Lindsey, you are just incredible how you can focus on playing the violin while enduring what has to be a painful performance is beyond me. Just an example of your toughness and dedication to your art. Beautiful performance.
I didn't hesitate to put a like on this video. I knew it was going to be good. You never disappoint me
amiga eres arte
Iconic! I live this song !

You did it hun! I had a hard time watching the video because I knew just how much pain you were in, but you did it; and it was beautiful.
A M A Z I N G !!!!!! 😍
... hermoso un ángel saltando entre las nubes tocando su violín
Wait, I don't quite understand this. Is the rope holding her up by her hair?
Amazing
That was intense! You're such a performer! Congratulations on achieving your goal on doing this. We are both concerned and amazed by your talent and dedication. Happy Holidays! :)
Wow...😱
This is superority all l saw .is amazing. I love it
Thank you for your art.
I really wish the people who leave dislikes here explain why???'
Loved it, great performance Lindsey!!!
One of the most beautiful things I've ever seen, and also seeing your training for it. Thank you for sharing this beauty with us. ❤
Очень актуально к новому году)) Вы словно главное украшение новогодней ёлки! Как всегда неподражаемо-шикарно.
who in in the right mind would "dislike" this incredible performance?
You're incredibly amazing, courageous and beautiful ❤️
Quien en su sano juicio da dislike a este video?
Wor après tant de travail et de souffrance pour faire cette musique  Sais sur et certain que je te voie en show   J aime tout de toi continuer  a nous faire rêver
How not to love you?  If you sacrificed so much to show us your art in a different way in this video.  You are wonderful and more than that and much more
You did it Lyndsey!! You overcame a huge challenge and made something beautiful and inspiring. I hope my daughters see this. Thank you.
Wow amazing dedication, execution,  and beautiful song. A+++
Me quede sin palabras, impresionante!!!
Brava.. bella..stupenda..ti sposerei solo per sentirti suonare
ME ENCANTAS LINDSEY, PERO SENTI QUE HABIA  MUCHO DOLOR EN EL VIDEO, PREFIERO LOS EPICOS Y MISTERIOSOS, ERES MUY CREATIVA Y UNICA , PERO POR FAVOR NO HAGAS VIDEOS ASÍ. TE QUEREMOS DESDE PERÚ
Way to go excellent job. You did it. No, yeah I agree with everyone else and don't do anything like that again. Your performance was amazing but we don't like seeing you or anyone else for that matter go through that much pain just to impress people.
Great job Lindsey
Wow. That was amazing. You do what you like. Express yourself how ever you like. Some pain is just the body telling what is going on.You judge your level as you chose.
Ты супер!!!!!!! Ты удивляешься и восхищаешь!!!!!!!!
That was so beautiful! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Old school Linsey I LOVE it! :D  Takes me right back to when I first discovered her :D
Now PLEASE go do something totally relaxing and enjoyable little missy!! I highly recommend a collaboration with Dimash! 💖 All pleasure, no pain 🤗
What an incredible performance, what a passion for your art, we can't appreciate it enough, thank you for your awesomeness.
I don't much care for the hair swinging. I just love this song :)
Your gift to us from God who gave his only begotten Son.
Honestly, the constant thought of her in so much pain made it difficult to focus on the song.
Such a beautiful performance. I brought tears to by eyes.
Beautiful Lindsey, I watched the work that you put into preparing for this, and here you are, the blood sweat and tears paid off. A stunning performance, graceful and lovely.  You inspire me to keep trying to overcome my addiction because it too is blood sweat and tears, and there are many times i feel like giving up, but LOOK AT YOU!!! I CAN TOO!!! Patience and persistence, it's just trusting in my own hard work.  Merry Christmas to EVERYONE!! 💚
I’m literally in tears watching this. So incredibly stunning. 🖤🎶🎵
Truly magical, specially after watching the previous video
I've been a fan of yours for years, and I think it was through this song that I first found you. That being said, I don't understand the point of this. For me the hair hanging didn't bring any extra to the performance. Obvs I'm in the minority judging by everyone gushing over it in comments. But to each their own.
Lindsay's videos and her playing skill are amazing. One of the best things about her videos is her joy as she plays. While her playing is flawless as always, there is no joy in her face in this video. I don't think I'll ever watch this video again.
Very impressive performance! But my hair hurts from watching.....and I’m 👨‍🦲 bald....
You're perfect, is magic. I love you 💜💫✨ TE AMO, ERES MAGIA.
Brutal¡¡¡ impresionante👍👏
Wow just wow. Inspiring. I saw your practice video and am just amazed. Good on you facing your fears and being able to move forward. Not everyone can..Good on you..It looked fantastic. You should be very proud of yourself. Have a Merry Christmas!!!!
You didn't even share half of what you were doing on your blog! Look at what you did! You were so strong and brave!!! Incredible!
amazing scenes but you don't do it again. there are many other ways to give a show without putting your health at risk. please please take care of your health and your body!!  YOU ARE STRONGER!!
Wow lo logró me encanta 😍😍😍
😳😧😦😱😱😱😮😯😲😲😕😕
Quede maravillado y sorprendico con lindsey...eres fenomenal..felicitaciones por tu excelente video
The choreography always gets me. I couldn’t imagine playing while doing half of that
Lo mejor que evisto 10 x 10 l love linsey stirle
I'm from Brazil RJ.   Antonio
Amo este video
I am so proud of your accomplishment!! You are such a treasure and inspiration for others!!!   God bless you!!!
That was beautiful, but I would have preferred a normal harness and extra wires because my neck and hair hurt just by watching. The whole time I was worried about Lindsey's wellbeing...take care of yourself girl!  But on another note...this song was what introduced me to Lindsey Stirling all those years ago. I fell in love with her music and been following her ever since. Thank you Lindsey!
БРАВО МОЛОДЕЦ
Is this the teletubby we deserved ? I don't know, but here we are
This is absolutely amazing! Never cease to amaze with each new video! Over the top how you are able to do so many acrobatics and dancing doing all those twists and remain absolutely focused in playing on cue. Thankyou and God Bless! ❤
Violin teacher: Relax. There should be no tention in your body.  Lindsey: Sorry mate what didcha say
Wow, well I might not see the reason why, but as long as it was worth it for you! I loved the dancing in the ice caves all those years ago and did watch most of the previous video and that's allot of pain. You probably just opened the door to sado masochism.. 😖😒😣 anyway, Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
You’re so amazing! I love you so much Lindsey ♥️ and you know what I’ve always wanted to be lifted like so. I’m sure it’s relaxing feels ♒️ .
Amazing! Absolutely stunningly BEAUTIFUL!!!
Amazing
That's one way to do a facelift.
I bought the concert. Best ever. You astonish.
Wow Lindsey, you are awesome.
Wooouch! Well done with that performance, but I hope you’re okay! 😦
Knowing how much pain you went through for it made watching this (amazing) performance incredibly unpleasant. You did a great job, though.
Woah, that hurts just by watching
I love how dedicated you are to bringing beautiful experiences to your audience. That was truly amazing! Thank you for all that you do for your fans and being a little spark of hope in the world.
Me volvió a sorprender ésta bella y transparente mujer!!! Sinceramente pensé que no lo volvería a hacer, que no me volvería a sorprender, y aquí me tiene con lel alma en un hilo, y el corazón más arriba.
А ведь именно благодаря этой песне, я о тебе узнал... Ты сделала это. Браво! Я не имею понятия, что это для тебя значило. Но, надеюсь, оно того стоило...
Excellent
Absolutely amazing, beautiful job!
Admiro sua coragem  E a sua concentração e esforço  Parabéns
You worked through the pain and accomplished an amazing goal! You make me feel like I can do anything if i put my mind to it too, Thank you. Your are amazing❤
😃👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍
Legend.. Pushing the boundaries to her beautiful art
That was amazing Lindsey, you truely are a Warrior. But please, please, please, never put yourself in such suffering ever again, even to please a trilion people. Your energy and your smile while enjoying playing your violin worth all the sunset of the world ! Take care little angel.
Lindsey, girl, you’re amazing!! This turned out beautifully!! You conquered your fear and your pain and put out a wonderfully memorable performance!!
God is going to send the love of your life Jeremiah 29
LEGENDD
👍😀
She doesn’t look happy doing this. Not even after. It looks amazing and I have the most respect for this but I dit not enjoy this as much as the other videos..
The look of concentration on your face reminds me of an Olympic gymnast. The commentators tell us this competitor is about to attempt an off-the-charts level of difficulty. The face in front of us is steeled. Pain is ignored. Nothing else crosses the mind except the performance. I don't know if the playing was authentic or dubbed. Frankly, it only matters in that if you were able to pull off that sound with that level of precision in movement, it's that much more amazing!  Mission accomplished! Now make a video where you're having fun again!
Incroyable bout femme 👍🌹😘
She must be so dizzy
Amaziiiiiinnnggggg😱
ALSO THIS WAS FREAKING AMAZING!
Amazin job Lindsey, we are always here to support you no matter what!🥰
So much beauty in one piece.  Thank you Lindsey for all fo your hard work!  You are truly a treasure!
well....now that all of your fans have anxiety watching that amazing performance and wondering how that is beyond comprehension....spectacular talent and performance
my heart ached for her during the video  and wondered how many takes it had taken to shoot that video
Wow!! Desde siempre eres original por eso estas donde estas Talento, Gracia y Entrega Gracias por existir!!
I’m speechless
You are a machine. Awesome!
Wonderful performance!
Although this is pretty crazy, please don't do it again!  No point on suffering or risking getting your hair getting ripped off for a video.
is this a new concept? never seen anything like this before...
Watching the vlog behind this performance made me appreciate and get teary eyed watching this...ugh so good!! YOU ARE INCREDIBLE
WOW - Just WOW
😳... That, took Work and Guts!!! Magnificent!😍👏👏👏👏👍
Will we get to see this live someday? 😻
I love this so much !! My favorite song of yours
WHOO ARE THESE PEOPLE WITH THE THUMBS DOWN!? Please tell me what is wrong with this performance... THIS IS AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE! THE TALENT, THE SKILL, THE DETERMINATION IT TOOK TO PULL THIS OFF.!!
I can’t fully enjoy this because I know how much pain it caused her to do it...also can’t be good for your hair. Respect you for pushing through and performing amazingly as always. Love ya Lindsey.
WOW!! you just keep blowing my mind!! 👏👏👏👏
You did it !!!! Go girl!!! Absolutely breathtakingly beautiful!!!
You are a big star! You flying on the world!
Esto se merece mil likes
👍👍👍👍 Great, but classic version of crystallize is awesome 😉
What a journey!  We, as soft humans with some notable exceptions, are so weak, both physically and emotionally.  We need to be challenged.  Love you, Lindsey.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Outstanding...

Yea so cool i love you wanderfoll ich größte Fan
Watched the previous video 1st.  Knowing what Lindsey went through made the 1st leap in this was EPIC!
Did I just watch a talented girl play violin hanging by her hair?        Yes. Yes, I did.
...when playing violin just isnt challenging enough!
Amazing! Beautiful! You are blessed. So much talent. Thank you for all that you do and sharing it with us.
Wowwww!!! Never seen anything like this before !😮🔥👐
you are brilliant, i love every version cristalize,
👍👍👍🤩🤩
Lindsey its an amazing video but please be careful. We don't want to see you get hurt performing music videos.
Suprema
Way to go girl. Beautiful vid. You did it. you set out and despite the pain you did it awesome.
My first second thouhts: Noooooo ... you are noooot doing this! And then you did, and... This is incredible, you are amazing!
forever always one of my favorite songs, but girl your head must be dying
This was amazing!!!! Loved it, she worked so hard for so long to do this. It turned out beautiful
this made me cry it's so beautiful!!!!
Mega!
Hold up....is she hanging by her hair?
AMAZING!
Imagine someone pulling your hair and then you see this... and its a big chain also ooff. Anyway it looks really beautiful!
I dont have words to describe your talent and brightness! You're an inspiration to me!!!
That was painful to watch.  Get back to what you were doing on your earlier YouTube videos,  keeping it simple and exemplifying your musical ability and stop this ridiculous showmanship.
Lindsey has truly mastered her craft.
...What possessed you to do this?
Невероятно красиво!!! Красивая задумка!

This felt so powerful. You did it. I hope you are proud of yourself because you deserve to be <3
Wow! Speechless.   This is one of the most beautiful videos I've ever seen. Amazing musician, incredible video!
I dont know what to say lindsey. Ihave no words to describe my feelings right now. Im so proud of you because there is no any violinist can do or  done these kind of fantastic performance. Now you proved to the world that you are A LEGEND. LOVE YOU SO MUCH.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow!
wow shocker. so creative. love it :D
Respect
The best live performance I have ever had the privilege watching to. 02:41 is when the magic starts. Fortunately everything went well.
This performance is SO perfect! Very angelic warrior to it! You’re so amazingly brave and gorgeous doing this! 🤩🥰🤯 Congratulations on all your hard work for this! 👍🏻🥰🥳🥳🥳🙌🏻
yay! you did it Lindsey! I'm so proud of you! thank you for a beautiful performance! ❤️❤️❤️
You Did it 🥳🥳🥳
That's what daddy issues look like..
Absolutely amazing, grandioso. You are a true artist in perfection. i can't imagine how much pain you suffered through the whole performance. as Refiner mentioned. Don't do that again please.
WOW!!! Absolutely amazing. She is a huge inspiration to me: her performance, her music. I’ve been listening to her songs for 6 years, and her music videos are always top notch. I get teary watching this one though, I can see her holding in her pain. She’s such an amazing person and so strong in every way: spiritually, mentally, and physically.   Keep doing what you love Lindsey, and to the best of your ability, and you’ll always come out even stronger than you started. You’re always in my prayers. May God bless you during this holiday season and take away any pain you may be feeling 😇☺️
You have such strength in you. Thank you
Не хочу бачити біль у твоїх очах,але твоя мелодія Божествина, але якщо треба на таке піти, щоб вшанувати публіку це не варто, ти нам і так подобаєшся!👍❤🌹🇺🇦
No puedo expresar lo doloroso que se ve esto y como a pesar de eso lograste que fuera una presentación tan hermosa, justo con la canción por la que conocí tu trabajo y mi favorita... Es increíble, pero por favor, no sigas usando cosas dolorosas por geniales que sean, no creo que lo necesites para darnos algo increíble, siempre nos das algo increíble  💕🇦🇷💕
Beautiful!
I do circus arts, and I have seen hair hanging artists do their thing in person. It never gets less incredible to watch, not even on the internet. Can't nobody in the world say that she is not a dedicated artist.
Alter! Des geht aufs Gnack!
❤❤❤❤😊👍
Really glad you shared the process video of getting to this point first, made this so much more impactful! Amazing performance, hope you have some downtime to enjoy other things you love after!
Super gut  🥰😍😍🥰🤩😘😘
You are certainly devoted!
It was cool but your facial expressions ruined it for me. It looks like you are grimacing 😬. If you keep at it, I assume you would get used to the pain and be able to control yourself more. And they should've used some hair wax so keep the flyaways at bay, especially in the back. I give it a 6.5/10.
Amazing!! You are one amazing woman, violinist,  live your music and videos.
Ohh lindsey cada vez me impresionas más 😀
Great Lindsey!!! No tear, no pain can stop you!!! I'm in love of you, of your bravery and obviously your beauty 😘
I imagine it being extremely difficult just to play the violin with such accuracy while dancing, much less being hung by your hair during the entire thing. My head hurts just thinking about it 😅. Seriously though, I have watched your videos and played your music since I was a kid and you are amazing. Good job girl!!!
Did she play this live?
Incrível
amazing !!!!!!!!!!
Olağanüstü ve harika 🧚‍♀️
so beautiful! knowing what you went through to  be able to perform this is truly inspiring. Thank You
Cool performance, but worth the pain?
Somebody get this lady a pair of golden wings.
While this may be a beautiful performance, I am unable to truly appreciate the beauty in it as all I can see is the absolute agony that Lindsey is in. I enjoy much of Lindsey's music and dance but I prefer not to see her in such incredible pain.
Сколько наблюдаю за ней столько же восхищаюсь ❤️❤️❤️👍самая лучшая Линдси
That was bat-excrement insane.
Hermoso, gracias por tu profesionalismo y por aguantar tanto dolor el resultado es excelente
We admire you twice: once for having taken this so painful challenge and won it and once for such a beautiful and perfect choregraphy. All your moves were full of grace, perfect posture of the full body. What a composer, what a violionist, what a dancer, what an acrobat, what an OUTSTANDING OVERTALENTED ARTIST!
Wow!!!!!!!!!!!
Это что-то немыслимое... Линдси... Ты - феноменальна...
Wow lindsey that looks so painful
Muy Hermoso, Muy Hermoso 👍👍👍👍👍👍♥️
Just hanging around I see...
Came back to this video to give it a like which I didn't do because I hated to see Lindsey in danger of injuring her neck. It would have been the first time I had not given a Lindsey video a like. Please don't endanger yourself again Lindsey. I hurts to watch.
That you pushed through your anxiety and fears for this performance makes it that much more special. Your dedication to your art and your fans is unparalleled. Stay Gold!  You are phenomenal.
Amazingly done. Cross it off the list. You did it. Never. Ever, do anything that will cause you so much pain again. That would have been brutal to have to do another retake. I do like the metaphor of push through the pain no matter what life throws at you, but, I've discovered there's always a second option of achieving the same goal.
that's insanely cool Bravo.
I hope the AGT judges watch this performance
Lindsey please don’t do this again 😮😞 It’s really a painful journey
Sensationell. Erinnert mich, an einen ähnlichen Auftritt 2016 bei Helene Fischer, in ihrer Show. Damals war Helene Fischer in einer Kugel. Und das bei dem selben Lied. Das hier ist nochmals eine Steigerung. Ganz klar 👍👍👍
Wow just wow 😮😮
Amazing job, Lindsey. Beautiful. Thank you for all that you do and bringing powerful music into my life. I've been listening to your stuff since 2013. Thank you thank you thank you. ❤❤❤
I want to cry. I bet you were so proud of yourself and this is absolutely beautiful. All your hard work lead to this amazing choreography that you have blessed all of us with.
Wow🥰😍😘
I hope she got the world's best neck massage after this!
Precioso, inspirador, emotivo verla y sobretodo escucharla... también duro como la danza, esta chica me encanta!!
you got the clip, now never do it again. thanks.
Cannot Express how beautiful this was... I also didnt enjoy seeing you cry.. but was it worth it?? .... yes!!!
You must be a couple inches taller after this one lol. Looks fun but painful
True talent, Bravo.
That is so awesome and impressive :D
Lindsey, I will ever be proud of you sweetness❤️❤️❤️. Your hard work is beyond, may GOD make you greater in Jesus name. Thank you for making 2020 productive for me (my training book you bought for me). Linds-bonita😍
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE ICON! 👏👏👏
You are so amazingly talented. Seriously hope you plan on having kids one day to pass that talent on 💜.... also hoping to catch you in Phoenix the next time your in town. Praying you, your family, and your production crew stay safe and healthy during this pandemic 💜.
looks original. but spare  the hair
Lindsey , awesome 🙏🏽💯🕊✌

WHAAAAAAAAAAT. IT WAS SO EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL❤️❤️❤️❤️you are AMAZING. Thank you for this gift 💛💛💛💛💛
I have tears in my eyes, after seeing your vlog and now this.
Very impressive
This looked really cool! But I dunno was it worth it? Like I enjoy your regular dance and music enough for you to have no need to take such reckless risks of injury or even something worse. You know, for example, breaking the neck and living the rest of your life not being able to even lift a finger. That would be not cool at all.
....AMAZING!!! Would love to see you live!!! Let me know if you have plans on touring southern part of US. Just an amazing talent!!!
Hecking amazing.
From the first time I heard you, I loved your work. Impressive, great performance.
This performance was amaizing music and choreography. I was watching the video what you posted about your preparation for this performance. I was crying and I was really courious and very afraid as well how this performance will end up.you manage it. Congratulations. But please,don't do it again if you don't have to. I don't like when you hurt yourself.  I really like your music and all choreography and videos.you are really talented and you are my hero :)  God bless you :)  Merry Christmas
💖💚✨💖💚✨💖💚✨
But... Wow. You're flying... While playing... After all painful training.  It's not strength or determination at this point, it's... It's... Powerfully incredible. I'm not crying, my eyes are dripping admiration and respect. You are a legend.
Simplemente espectacular😱🥰
Muito lindaaaaa....amo seu trabalho e arte...
В живую это не реально совместить воздушную акробатику и музицирование на скрипке. Музыка очень ровная, студийная. Акробатика со скрипкой не предполагает такую ровную игру. Но результат (клип) завораживает.
Beautif video . Super !💃💐🎀🧡
Saw your video on training for this, biting my lip whist watching this thinking of the pain your putting yourself through. The result is beautiful.
You did an amazing job and I loved this performance.  You look so graceful and beautiful. glad you did this so we could see your hard work, it for sure paid off hun
Lindsey, This is very beautiful and you should be so proud, but I don't believe the result was worth the pain you put yourself through.
It loke so greaseful and zo painful plz dont do dat agene i can't say from adders people but i wut see you beter wen your having fun and have a big smile  one your curious face PLZ be your self love joke from holland
The video finished and my two year old daughter yelled "You did it!!" ❤️ Loved it! My 5 yr old keep asking to watch it ❤️
I watched this video first, my mouth was agape the whole time and by the end I was just in awe at how beautiful, how graceful, and how strong this woman and this performance was.  Then I saw the vlog shortly thereafter and realized just how much of your heart, soul, and faith you put into it.  God has blessed you with such grace and talent and I am grateful to be witness to your testimony.
ME HOLDING ON TO MY HAIR
Lindsey has found a new way. The origin.
Wow to play that well and move that well at the same time - multi talented indeed!
👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏😍 i love You Lindsey
Amazing this lady is a legend!
Is this Real life?! 🤯,  EPIC!!!!! 🤩
OHHHHHH OUCH.... Well done Lindsey!!!
Unica y epica melodia Lindsey sigue asi. Maravillosoooo
Amazing
Not gonna lie. I scrolled down to the comments and just listened to the song. After watching the prior video, just couldnt bring myself to watch this. But I'll give you the listen, because Crystallize is one of my absolute favorite songs of yours.  Merry Christmas Lindsey. And Happy Holidays to everyone watching/listening to this.
Simply amazing.  You’re strength exceeds all bounds! ❤️
It's incredible how much you SEE your strength and the amount of work that goes into each movement.  I can barely imagine how difficult it was to be lifted by the bun in your hairn let alone how intense the training was to train the muscles in your neck and back to be able to support your body while suspended. It's truly impressive all the work and dedication that goes into each performance
but why did she do this?
No exaggeration; this is one of the most beautifully, heartbreakingly inspiring things I've ever seen. I'm just blown away.
WOW...
Absolutely B-E-A Utiful, Please don't ever put yourself through that kind of pain again just to entertain us!
Bravo!
👏👏👏👏👏👏
LEGEND
Hola Lindsey. El vídeo es bonito, pero no lo hace más bonito el que lleves un violín, que sabemos que no es el que suena según haces esas acrobacias. Respetuosamente, no me parece bien. Hay personas que creen que suena así de bien y en cierto modo es un engaño.
Me encantó!! Es impresionante 🥺❤️  Y que tremendo dolor de cabello me dió jajajaja
This whole video is so nostalgic. The song was from her first album, she does a lot of cinematic covers for her songs, and she still puts so much effort and love into each video.
Way to push through and perform like the artist you are without boundaries!💪
I love you, you are the best!!
Tellement magnifique !! 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰
Getting visions of her performance where Simon was a jerk and she was being tossed around which caused her to miss notes. This feels like the progression of that performance, moving to being tossed around again but instead by the hair to leave her unimpeded unlike the Talent show. Loved it, great performance...don't go rippin all your hair out ma'am haha.
I love your music 😍 I can feeling teletransport me to other dimension ☺
You are a creature of extraordinary grace,  beauty and talent. This is a truly incredible performance but please take the greatest care of yourself. We are long past the time when what you do for us is more important than who you are to us.
The fact that she was willing to do this is amazing. That looks incredibly painful.
The performance has so much depth. The perseverance through the pain both emotional and physical. After the year we’ve all had this means so much.
Beautiful, yet painful!!   The video of you learning this looked so painful.   Your talent, dedication, and artistry is amazing.
Lindsy that was amazing. that must have been exrushiatingly painful you are brave stay safe and stay healthy.
I would not have the courage to do that!!!
THE most incredible thing I have seen in a long time....I saw your training video too. You have become an artist I admire...you have inspired many with your dedication, and you have inspired me...I am homeless, and this has shown me that you CAN overcome. Thank you Lindsey. You have flown, and played like an Angel.  The music piece fit so perfect with the performance. A++
Even if i had hair i wouldn't be brave enough to try that. Did you scream or puke first after filming?
Congats, you did it!
Amazing, can't find any other words for it.
This was one of the very first songs that I had ever listened to from Lindsey, and this brought tears to my eyes. Just wonderful seeing her grow to the woman she is today, and I am forever grateful for her hard work.
Es bellísimo👌
Lindsey!!! I'm blown away by your bravery! I saw your previous video of the work you put into get to this. I'm just so proud you were able to be this brave!!! You go girl!!!
I don't think there are any words to express how incredible this is. I admire you so much٫ thank you for everything you do and for showing us that believing in ourselfs will always be the best we can do
This is so beautiful ❤️, i love this woman
Bravo. Huge respect for the sacrifice you make to push your talent skills to the edge. No one asked you about that but you choose to try something new and difficult and painful. Hats off. Press F to pay respect :)
Todo lo que haces esta genial y aun así te esfuerzas por hacer algo más grandioso aunque lo sufras mis respetos y admiración completa.
Truly amazing and inspiring Lindsay!  Thank you for your art!
IMPRESIONANTE!!!! No sólo tienes un nivelazo en tocar el instrumento, sino que lo haces de forma increíble!!! Lindsey....te adoro!!!
Wonderful
LINDEY CASATE CONMIGO SALUDOS.
i know this might never be seen. but in my heart i want to thank you for all the hard work you went through for this. thank you for giving us so much of yourself.
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Piece of history
you did it and it was amazing
Wow what a demonstration of  strength you're the best unbelievable 🤩🤩
Who's bright idea was it to do a performance that hurt you so much?!
Sooo amazing !! Gavi will be proud of you....congrats ! So beatiful
YOU DID IT!!! WE ALL ARE SO-SO-SO PROUD OF YOU!!! THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL AND MAJESTIC, but, please, take all your time to rest and hill, take care of your health, physically and mentally, WE ALL CARE SO MUCH ABOUT YOU! PLEASE, BE CAREFUL!
Lindsey you really are one of a kind and I absolutely love your work over the years. Your motivation video of your training for this performance really moved me and I hope you are doing okay now that you have achieved this beautiful milestone.
I don't like it. The pain was rediculous. You didn't look like you had fun. I mean you overcame some amazing pain. I guess this is your version of walking on hot coals. I'm sad but impressed
Such amazing progress honey! You're doing so good! You can tell a few times that you were in pain but it was a beautiful performance and I cannot wait to see you Blossom even more
That was so incredibly beautiful. I watched it with tears in my eyes and my jaw on my knees. ❤
That was really impressive Lindsey!  I am happy that we like the same music as well.
I really don‘t understand why you do this. Of course it looks good. But   such a masochismus does not have to be in my opinion.
This was an amazing performance something that really moved me to be better version of my self then what I am already
Gratuloj por via performanco kaj via prezentado . Estas kiel revo. Mi ŝatas vian muzikon.
The difficulty in this can not be understated.. You are amazing. It was beautiful ❤️... But goodness that looks like it hurt a whole lot.
Beatiful :-)
Wow! Amazing
I have no words for this outstanding performance.
I know the pain you went through in learning how to hang from your hair. I watched all the videos of you learning. And you never gave up and you’ve done an amazing job playing your violin in that position. I am so very proud of you and so very happy that I am in touch with you through the videos so that I can see your art. I will be seeing you in person in New Orleans in July 2021. ❤️
Whilst I never ever want to see you do something this painful again, I am in absolute awe at how beautiful it was not just in it's choreography (which was fantastic) but the message. I was hopimg that this would be a stunning performance and it truly was so. It's not about trying something new that no one's heard of its about pushing through even when the world, including yourself, is telling you to give up. Violin dancing? That's never been done before, why bother doing both if doing makes the other sound or look bad? But you pushed passed that, learning to master both in spite of what you were told. This was no different. In fact it almost felt like you had taken all of the struggles in your life, put them into a physical form of pain and made something beautiful out of it. I urge you to never do this again but for what it is, I am genuinely stunned ❤❤❤
Your an inspiration Lindsey! Thank you for sharing the story behind this! I said this on the vlog video too but thank you so much for your witness it means so much these days!
Can you imagine if Lindsey and David Garrett had children?.... They would play sing dance stomp and Float!!!! Oh My!!!!
Magnifique 💜💜💜💜
I love thiss💯💯💯
💝
wow, this is next level
Wow, wow, wow Lindsey this is really amazing. You never stop surprising us. I Love You 😍😘✨💪💜💙❣💞💟
I so h😆ppy for u . U did it & u made it look easy & u look ❤beautiful💚, doing it as well😘
Wow she's actually playing it!  This is mind blowing!
I can't imagine how long this took to film with your hair being pulled all the time. This performance was sublime, it was worth it, I'll never forget it.   Now I beg you to please quit doing it. Artistic performance is lost on the audience when all they could think about is how much pain you're in. I might not be a dancer, but I know a large part of it involves making it look easy,  i.e. to just smirk smartly as you land on land on your leg with the swollen knee and sprained ankle. You've shown that you can swing and swirl from your hair. However, it never looked easy.
Chybi mi v tom ten Dubstep.😢
Gode bless you!
This should be some hair product ad
Guess I'm a Stirling fan.  Like her in this video, I was hooked early on.  ;-)
FANTASTIC!!! You're unique
Your strength and beauty is unparalleled Every time I face a challenge in the upcoming year I’m going to turn to this video for inspiration and courage Thank you 🙏🏻 and Merry Christmas 🎄🎁
Maravillosa perfección.
So beautiful !  Дуже чудово та чарівно. Дякую. You are the best. :)
So amazing. I loved it so much. You did such a great job.
Умница, у меня дочь ей 6 лет она обажает твои выступления
Wow !! Loved it I watch you all the time you amaze me all the time!!!!!🤍♥️
Wouw !!! 😍 all i can say
You did it ! and it was so beautiful, you must be so incredibly proud, As I watched your video and the pain you were in,....I wondered why, but now I understand <3
uff. looks amazing! But autsch
Wonderful.  It looks like all the pian and suffering of the practices paid off beautifully.
❤
That is very impressive ! Especially after watching the training video and how much it took you to get there ! Congrats
Passion force you to keep going! <3 wonderful performance and impossible!
Visually stunning❗  Musically superb❗ Powerful and hypnotic in every way‼️

WOW, That was amazing, stunning, fabulous, beautiful, graceful, etc....  Lindsey, you could have been an extraordinary ballerina.  Don't get me wring, you are a an extraordinary dancer.  With and incredible arch that any dancer would envy.  I don't know if you ever had dreams of being a ballerina.  If you did, you would have been extraordinary.   Loved this video❣️❣️❣️. Oh, fyi, you've got some kick azz abs.  Those move are not easy... Kudos to an incredibly artistic dance.
I love  the art that you do Lindsey, but its been so hard to watch this piece. It was hard for me to watch because of imagining the pain that you went through preparing for it...
The true Supergirl
first time best
I applaud you for doing something different and always striving to do more but I saw your first video regarding this trial and hurt for you.  I don't want to see you hurt yourself like this again...ur normally happy in your videos and I know you tried to hide it but I saw and felt your pain.  Glad you put your feet down as much as you did though.  Be kind to yourself Lindsey!  ♡♡♡♡
and they said u couldnt pack a bar boy were they ever wrong you are amazing
doing all that...and knowing the process you went through to get to this point is mind blowing! you're amazing, well done!!
Normally, you are an understudy to someone for at least a year before you are able to do something like this......but Lindsey learned this in THREE months!!!  Great job, Lindsey!!! Please don’t do this again!
👏👏👏
PERRISIMAAAA 😍👌🏽
Color me impressed! I can't imagine anyone more dedicated and hard working than you Lindsey. I know this had to be excruciating both physically and emotionally for you. My congrats to  you. I will be looking forward to seeing in person next summer, God willing.
Amazing job. True performance through pain, sweat, and tears.
she did a very good job, but it makes me feel anxious a little bit... 😬
Goosebumps & tears 🤍 SO proud of you!!    You're determination and passion for your music and performances got you through that incredible pain. Absolutely breathtaking.
is that really hanging from her hair..?
Mis respetos
Прекрасно, я тебя люблю, но не делай так...
Woww! lindo! ❤️
Chills....chills.....chills through the whole performance but that fast spin at the end; speechless.
AGT: You can't dance and play violin.  Lindsey: Watch this!
I teared up throughout the entire performance. You did absolutely AMAZING! It was breathtaking and moved me deeply. Great job!!!!
Question, "What for?"
I don’t understand the art of hair hanging , but you conquered your trail and did it beautifully...way to stay strong and literally hang in there....💕💕♥️♥️♥️💕💕
This is so amazing,  you are so incredible and so beautiful,  I adore you ❤️
So....you like your hair pulled huh? Nice job. What a simple video, but still a masterpiece
How talented do you have to be to have such a control over the violin while spinning to fast ? Keep your arm and hands so steady ? AND play  THAT difficult song ... Brilliant
Great!
wow , thank you for all your hard work . love from australia
Você foi incrível!
Girl you are gorgeous! Hope you watch that and FEEL that victory! Amazing 👏
I just had the worst week of my employed life. Then I come home and watch this and that training vlog that she made. Now in hindsight my problems don't seem quite as bad, and she is doing all of this for a music video.
Это бесспорно красиво, но все восторженные крики не стоят твоих боли и страданий, просто танцуй и играй на скрипке - нам этого достаточно, не истязай себя! Будь счастливой!                       It is undeniably beautiful, but all the enthusiastic cries are not worth your pain and suffering, just dance and play the violin - that's enough for us, don't torture yourself! Be happy!
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽Amazing!
You are Crazy ! i love that.
You did it Lindsey!! 💕
Lindsey. The look on your face is one I have rarely seen on anyone. A combination of pain, pride, concentration, calmness, discipline, transcendence and a diamond-hard determination. You had won even before you started. Triumph was in your face. I thought of Frida Kahlo, making art in spite of her pain, living life to the fullest. I thought of Olympic athletes.  I am in complete awe of you. You did this for yourself, but because you let us share in the experience we are able to channel our own pain and grief, and be filled with hope and determination, too. For that, we thank you.
what a master well done
A litle Bit grasy😅😂
This isnt the Lindsey im used to much, you were so focused looking compared to the normal jolly looking videos, I watched your previous video vlog and I could almost feel the pain you went trough for such an amazing result. Happy Hollidays
The best! 💕🙏🏻💕🙏🏻💕🎉thank you!!!!
YOU DID IT!!!!! YAY! WHAT AN AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT!!!
Se que no está sujeta de verdad por el cabello, pero me dolió :v
Factor x arrepintiendoce de haberle dicho que no podía bailar y tocar violín a la vez y no le dieron el pase
I watched the video where so much emotion was shown trying to do this and the end result is amazing 👏
You did it!! And it was so beautiful.
I said it everytime I watched the Christmas special and I'll say it again: this was definitely my favourite performance ever of Crystallize. Seeing how hard you worked for this and the fact we can see how focused you are when playing this just made me cry because this is so beautiful. Once again you have amazed me and inspired me to always be my best version. To me, this choreography gave Crystallize a whole new vibe, a whole new meaning, and it's beautiful.
WOW!! Sent shriver throughout my body. Incredible!
Lindsey Stirling will forever light the spark in my soul to find inspiration for life. You've saved me more than you will ever know 💖 I've whole heartedly loved and supported you since the very beginning of your career and you continue to amaze me!! 😍👏👏👏👏
Amazing
Incredible  i guess she s not  really playing the violing its playback but its amazing
it's mind blowing. all the hard work for such a wonderful payoff. you're really amazing, Lindsey :)
Bravo Lindsey !!!
I think i just cried.
You are an inspiration! Well done and good work! ❤
My Gosh this young lady is a Star! I am astonished with her dedication and pure love! I am glad to be walking on this Earth at the same time as Lindsey. She is a gift.
En plus d'être poétique, la voilà aérienne ! Mais comment peut-elle jouer sans fausses notes malgré la force centrifuge ? Quelle artiste complète ♡
massively impressive
Lindo!!!! Maravilhoso!!!!!
Ms.Stirling is by FAR one of the most exceptional artists in the universe! Everything she does is mesmerizing! Plus she seems like a really great human and cute as a button! Cheers to you Lindsey!!!
i cant figure out why, but i'm dizzy and my hair hurts.
Ужас! Линдси, мы ж тебя любим, побереги себя, ты нам нужна целая и невредимая!
Нахуя, а главное зачем
An exceptional performance which made me applaud while watching the video.
I was moved to tears knowing what you went through to give this amazing performance. Thank you!
Umm... Yah. OWW
Incredible, but also ouch ^~^

Fiquei com dor de cabeça só de ver esse içamento kkkkk. Fantástica a dança e a canção.
Lindo!!!🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
👏🏻🤩amazing
I saw it in your show and it's absolutely awesome. U r incredible. Nothing can stop u ;) #ksll
Bravo!!! Stunning!!! After hardwork, a great example of mental power to overcoming. ⭐👏👏👏
That look pain full do not do that again Please.  Your tears shatter my heart . as much joy you give to us . all i have is my shoulder i give to your tears. Let the gift of God shine with each fall tear with each breath . good job
Lindsey!!! You did it!! Very emotional watching you through this journey. Music has incredible power in distracting us from pain. ❤️
BRAVO!   MAGNIFICA INTERPRETACION ! 👏👏👏👏👏
Lindsey no debería haber hecho esto.... Una cosa es tocar un instrumento disfrutandolo... Y otra siendo torturado... Ella no tenía la necesidad porque ya es la mejor violinista
This performance - especially because you shared what you’ve been through to get there - always brings tears to my eyes. You are a true inspiration. Thanks to you I never forget to tell myself: I can do this. ❤️
That was absolutely beautiful. The pure dedication and the emotions combined with it were really amazing. I have never seen something alike
Класс 👍🏻 умница ! 😘😍
Mind...blown.  So beautiful,  thank you.
Lindsey just blows my mind all the time, absolutely talented!
Like ice skating on air- such a perfect choice! Holy smokes, I can't imagine how that feels- such a strain, I imagine, so much training, but DANG, I can only imagine how freeing it is to know you can do that!
This is an incredible combination, I can't believe my eyes. You are beautiful!
Why would you risk pain, vomiting, and the possibility of a broken neck for a video?
Amazing. Knowing how difficult it was for you to get to this point , I think you were so very brave , graceful, beautiful and of course your talent knows no bounds.. Thank you for inspiring strength through your spirit and creativity.
Maravillosa
Вы самая мега - супер !!! Аж дух захватывает от песен, скрипка !!! )
Increíble 🥺❤️un saludo desde México 🇲🇽😍
Espectacular... 😍
Congratulations! You've done it. Magnificently.  ^_^
you are my inspiration to follow my dreams
nice, still prefer the ice castles in Colorado :)
Очень красиво и мило )))  умничка )))
Simply amazing and beautiful! It was like watching Cirque Du Solei.
wow
Wow...BRAVO!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
First song I ever heard from Lindsey was this all these years ago. I knew I'd be a fan for a long time and Im glad I'm correct.
After seeing that last video, I cant enjoy this one because of all the mental and physical pain she went through.
What a beautiful performance
were you really playing,
Моя голова начала болеть...
Beautiful but I dont like seeing you hurting
Wow.Just wow!This is incredibly beautiful.Thank you for the music 🙂💖🎻🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶❄️
Beautiful and Graceful.  Merry Christmas!
Was it worth it?.....Amazing Yes!...Inspiring Yes!...but was it worth it.. to you? I hope so...
You are awesome!
Amazing !
I can’t tell if I’m getting emotional because I saw the struggle during the concert or if the emotions are coming out of the music- feeling the struggle to learn this and the “I can do this” and “Take that! I’m doing it!”
Perfectly❤❤❤
I'm so proud of you
Wow. Perfect. I love the strap-on violin. Very cool. Is this the first arial violin ballet?
Ok so I saw the tic tok leading to this and so glad I got to see it. You look so beautiful and it was so amazing. All of this video was magical and I'm so impressed with the training that it must have taken. Long ways from AGT
🤠👍
Oh ma pauvre tu as du souffrir  Bref le rendue est génial 👍 Grosse bises  Je t’aime 😘 ❤️🥰😘
AaAaaAAaaAaa!!! Lindsey te AMOOOOO!!! <3
Just amazing! ❤️🇦🇷
Way to keep your composure during this! You did amazing! Your hard work paid off! Congrats Lindsey!
I'm so lucky because I listened to you and I'm glad you're my idol💕💕💕
Always artistry in motion. Just to do the maneuvers is spectacular but to do it while playing the violin is awesome
Amazing.  Made even more so because of the challenges you shared earlier.  Thank you for bringing such inspiration, strength, and beauty into our world.
i love you! wis love from Belarus
Es de aplaudir 👏🏻 este increíble vídeo, wow es impresionante la danza, el tema la fotografía! Felicidades por darnos esta joya 💎!
you did it!! and you are incredible
Artemis, Roundtable Rivals, Master of Tides and this 😍❤️⚡
Your talent doesn’t fit in this world Stirling.
Woooou
She’s turned into a Cirque du Soleil acrobat... crazy and scary all together.
Hold my tears! I see and almost do not believe ... Speechless.
I feel very humbled now for how conformist and weak I am throughout my life while others, like you, go so far to bring out the most of themselves... of the gifts God gave them... Lindsey, thank you for inspiring me - making me feel small and realizing how much more there is in me that I let rust away day after day, when, in fact, I could choose to do otherwise. Thank you for the light you shine on us, so we won't forget what we all might be... are... capable of.
Who ever disliked this see me immediately
Words cannot begin to describe the depth of your commitment to your art.  You are amazing, sister. So much love!!
Blown away. I'm so glad I watched the vlog before this too. The beauty, the pain, the perseverance. And what I've always liked about Crystallize as a melody are the somber moments into the upbeat and energetic stretches. This was a beautiful song to pair off with this. I hope this gets all the love and attention it deserves!
You did it!
So.. She clearly has a fetish where she likes to get her hair pulled ;)
Why would you do this to yourself?
I know the song was Crystallize, but this was sheer Transcendence
I have just seen one of the most talented and brave artist in the world right now!!!!
So inspiring.. gave me chills! You are amazing ❤️
You should be soooooo incredibly proud of yourself. This turned out so beautifully <3
Everything you do is awesome, but this is just next level.  🤍
whaaaa?!? Lindsay!! thats fantastic!
Amazing!!! How could anyone dislike that?!?!
Seeing you overcome what seemed like a major hurdle is very inspiring. Seeing you in pain and tears and thinking that this was something that you didn't think you could do was heartbreaking. Yet... You never gave up and you completely CRUSHED it! The rendition of Crystalize going along with the choreography was beautiful. You really rose above the bar and remind us that even the toughest challenges can be overcome as long as we don't give up. Thank you Lindsey. Breath taking performance as always. <3
PRE RECORDED
This just helped me remember why you’re my favorite artist out there. Your dedication and perseverance are unmatchable.
Absolutely beautiful, but you can definitely see the pain on her face. Hopefully the other shows were more comfortable for her.
You did it! You did it amazingly! Congratulations! Such an amazing performance. I could see the strain and determination. ❤
❤️
Waw waw waw🥺❤️
This is absolutely mind blowing 🤯. I really admire you and your work. You look so gracil and charming.
This was so amazing, I had to look up words to further explain my physical being: Astounded, Delighted, Awed, Enchanted, Glamoured, Calmed, Marveled.... The list goes one... THANK YOU
i feel every second 😇
Magnificent 🥰🤩😍👏👏👏👏
Holy Moly!  I watched your last video and saw how much pain this really is. You did a brilliant job with this new video.   This new dance was so beautiful and painful looking. But I understand why artists suffer for their craft.   Bravo!
No.poprostu nie prawdopodobne co ona wyprawia 😘😘😘Loved
💞💞💞💞💞💞
Wonderful Musik from Lindsay Stirling Love this Musik Video 👍.
You were phenomenal, despite the difficult endurance of pain, the courage and strength you had were stronger than everything, VERY GOOD and Merry Christmas!
Bravo, je reconnais depuis 2 ans. J'ai suivi ton parcours que personne ne mettais un copec sur toi. J'ai regardé ta story rien compris car non sous-titre en français mais ressenti ta souffrance et vu le résultats bravo j'ai repensé à ma maman décédée d'une tumeur au cerveau. Ton envol est majestueux pour tous merci 💞💖
I bet that America's got talent is thinking other wise for bashing her all those years ago.
HOW :0
Your dedication throughout your training, your hardwork, your blood sweat and tears put into this performance make you someone to emulate, someone who your lost loved one I am sure is watching over you and so proud of your journey. Thank you for sharing your experience with us, thank you for this beautiful performance, and for baring your soul to all of your fans so that we might better understand not just you, but your passion. Truly, thank you.
This was amazing, insane, incredible, beautiful, just everything! To see the difference from AGT when they thought dancing and playing the violin was not something that would work and now seeing Lindsey excel at her craft and evolve. Just when I think "there can't be anything else to improve this" and then she does this, just perfection!
Thank you, thank you, thank you! The focus and concentration that took was so evident. Thank you for putting yourself so much into everything you do for us, your fans. Watching this and looking back to the initial video of this song shows so clearly how much you've grown, in your vision, your execution, and as an artist. Mad respect.
How is your neck now?  You look perfect in your whole routine.  🔥
Beautiful video, though extremely painful to watch. Having seen your previous video on the making of this, I felt your pain throughout your entire dance. I applaude your mind over matter; but we could see your pain, and some of us could feel it. Still a beautiful performance.
You are very strong Lindsey! I saw all the pain you went through to achieve this sublime result. Very few people would have made so much effort to offer such a spectacle to their audience. Thank you very much Lindsey. You were right to fight, your show is magnificent!
Wow!  Just Wow!
Way to up your game and try something new Lindsey!
Beautiful and you did it.  Congratulations. 🥀
I could hear your sigh of relief at the end
Thank you Lindsey. Your performance was beautiful. The pain in your eyes and face was anticipating the relief that comes from never hooking yourself to that contraption ever again. This is your journey, leave that pain on that stage. You don't have to remember it. We love you and your performances!
why would you even do this :( Not worth
wow impresionante , de verdad una mujer extraordinaria  desbordante de talento me fascina
Outstanding performance. What you went through to do this. Congratulations
Thank you, Lindsey 💙💙💙
I love it, it's just beautiful, how I would have liked to have been there in person
there's playing the violin and then there's  playing the violin Lindsey style..
!!! UAU !!! 👏👏👏 💛🧡💙💚💜🤎❤️💖💝 💎 💝💖❤️🤎💜💚💙🧡💛 👏👏👏 "AMEI" ...
I hope some serious painkillers were had for that shoot. Results are beautiful
This is amazing. It's perfect 🤗. I am glad you're expanding your skillset. We also love you on the ground. Please be safe :) we want to continue listening to your music.
Mesmerizing, first time in a long time that i've actually viewed the entire video.. and Crystallize is such a good pick, well done!
Dear, Lindsey, you're Hero! Hero full of Art. You're extraterrestrial! I'm inlove with every single played note by you! And that kind of pain.. to make your immortal dance... Hat off! You're amazing Artist I'm so addicted in who.
It all looks great, but please don't make fun of yourself... Even for the sake of art))
YOU NAILED IT!
Wow 🥰
I have so much respect for you. When life gets hard don’t listen to that voice telling you that you can’t.
This is strange...
DID IT HURT
You did it Lindsey and the video came out beautifully!!☺
I watched the video of you practicing for this. I saw your pain and the fear everyday. I can still see the pain and the fear in your performance. Why are you doing this? It's not worth it. Honestly I would rather see you dancing on the floor the way you normally do, when you look so happy and full of life. This performance hanging from your hair isn't worth it. Let your hair down and put your feet back on the floor where you dance so beautiful. Good luck and blessings on you and your show.❤🙏✝️
I am frankly amazed and stunned.  Think of the complexity of this.  Twisting and turning and moving while playing while the hair is being used to support you (and there will be pain despite all the prep work she did).  I cannot imagine there would be many people on this planet that could perform such a complex arrangement.
Her hair is going to fall out 👁👄👁
WOW. She gives everything for her art and it looks incredible. You should play one chord or maybe one note that describes the feeling of hanging on your Hair. I am blown away right now. Thank you for this video.
Beautiful performance.  My neck literally aches in sympathy after watching this. Excuse me while I go get an ice pack.
I bet that took a lot of practice and conditioning, headaches too. Amazing!
Bravoo.... super.....+++++++++++++++++++
This is incredible to see how much pain you were in, to doing this spectacular performance!
¡Eres increible Lindsey!, este video demuestro cuanta determinación y pasión le dedicas a todo lo que haces que emocionante video
Belle prestation  . Bisous.
she really pulled it off. but to me she's most of all a VISUAL artist, the music plays second fiddle. (pun intended;-)
Incroyable, magique & féérique
See the amount of training and pain it took to do this and finally seeing her fully  raised up, I did start to cry. We are so proud of you Lindsey! This just shows how strong Lindsey is mentally and physically
You did it and hands down 🔥🔥🔥
Es peligroso pero hermoso😍😘
Wow!
I love 😍😍😍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Such grace. She is such a fierce performer.
Such a good, strong performer! Love the song as usual - never gets old. Take Flight would be a fitting song to do too aha.
Amazing
Не знаю что писать, красиво,безусловно,но за волосы подвязать это через чур
Woooooooow, excellent performance 👏👏👏. And this kind of performance only Lindsey Stirling can pull of 👌👏👏.  My jaw was dropping through out the video 😀😃
Что ни говори во льдах было лучше, здесь уже не то. А это какое то издевательство над собой.
Браво, гениально)

👏👏👏👏👏👍
:| wow

DOESN'T WORTH IT. NEVER DO THIS AGAIN. IT'S A LOT OF PAIN. NO HUMAN BEING IS FOR THE EXECUTION.
Proof she is an angel and I'm thrilled you're here!
I love you Lindsay Sterling I have most of your albums
That gave me chills and took my breath away. I almost cried too. That was AMAZING in so many ways. The training you must have gone through to do that... #respect Merry Christmas, Lindsey, and Merry Christmas, everyone!
Even my head hurts, you are the best.
All the pain and suffering she went through to do this amazing song good job Lindsey
Congratulations faithful friend, you've done it!
I tip my hat to this woman.   Astounding. I cannot put proper words into a comment section. Only that this was nothing short of amazing.   God broke the mold when he made you, Lindsey. Bravo. 🌹🌹🌹🌹
Takes hair dancing while playing an instrument to a new level. Verra cool.
Wonderful!
Absolutely incredible!
oh wow! such an amazing performance. I am speechless. So so proud of you, you never gave up! amazing! simple amazing!
Concentración y control. Sin palabras.
Lindseyyy! This came out SO beautifully! <3 You totally destroooyed your goals! <3 Way to push through the pain and anxiety. ^_^
Having watched the video series as you struggled through training and the fear, when you launched right at the crescendo...it was one of the most beautiful artistic moments I have ever witnessed!  The word that comes to me is Triumphant! How perfect a tribute during his holiday season, as I know you are a devout Christian. Absolutely perfect. You touched my soul Lindsey, God Bless you!
You did fantastic! way to have a vision of what you wanted and follow through with what needed to be done without taking and shortcuts.
Your hard work has paid off. This is absolutely stunning and perfect in every way. Like the oyster, this was pain that was turned into a beautiful pearl.
This is so amazing <3
You look stronger, and seeing you overcome your fears, amazed me.
Such an amazing work of art!!!
Amazing and beautiful. But, it looks very dangerous.
This wasn't entertaining
You're amazing! All your art is impressive ❤️
Respects
You did it! All the pain you went through made this beautiful piece of work!!! It's perfect <3
Best circus act ever seen.
Stupendo
Pfft...white people
Incredible
Tears in my eyes. <3
It's  amazing!
Kristi C The pain we saw you go through for this beautiful video. I don’t know how you did it. Bravo!
Wow! Amazing!
Just wow....🇸🇪💛💙
oooooow  eres impresionante.... un gusto de ver y escuchar  tu ARTE
whoa !
Watching your blog whilst you trained for this brought me to tears and yet gave me strength as I to was learning to do hard things.. cancer. I prayed for you and somehow my treatments didn't seem that bad. Now I see the results of your prayers and hard training and I am blown away! We both learned that with God, ernest prayer for his help, we can do hard things! Bravo you brave woman, bravo✋🏻🙌
Incredible
Amazing!
😍
Молодец, очень сильная женщина, как же она плакала от боли, но все равно пошла до конца, пример многим, очень её люблю
It looks very cool, but we would have loved it just as much if you had a harness hidden in your suit instead of in your hair! I love that you were able to conquer this, but please don't torture yourself if you don't have to!
I remember when she started, subscribed since she had 10k subs :)
Gracias por dedicarte en cuerpo y alma, por sufrir en tus prácticas tan duras, cada esfuerzo y lágrima derramada valió totalmente la pena, yo adoro y valoro cada uno de tus videos y más este porque creo que es uno de lo más difícil y doloroso para ti, te admiro bella mujer! ❤️
YOU'RE SO AWESOME!! I don't think another person will try this, I can't imagine the pain. You're so determined; incredible is a word that can describe you
You're best.  To go through such pain.  It was worth it.🥺😭
INCREÍBLE  PRECIOSO  BONITO ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😭😭😭😭espectacular me encantas y cada semana más
You're so dangerous Lindsey
It was fascinating you can your music express every feeling in every song feel the emotions that you show lack of people who create music from the heart and not from income
Wow!!
You did it LInds!!!!!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏Bravo bravoooooo... i admire you lindsey
Que gran concentración para poder realizar un acto tan maravilloso, mis respetos.
Wao! You are amazing! It is inspiring to see how you did everything even when it hurts you to get this amazing results! Hope it helps your fans and whoever see you at this video to learn that you can do whatever you want working hard with love and passion. Thanks my dear and admire Lindsey.
INCREDIBLE!!! Watching your vlog before this really made me appreciate it SO much more. I mean you're amazing anyway but wow Lindsey!!! I too, was almost in tears thinking of how much pain you must be in but also so proud of you! <3
Stunning.
Сказать что великолепно это ничего не сказать. Низкий поклон от поклонника из Беларуси)
💙💚💛💜💛💚💙💚💜💜❤❤❤❤❤❤ Such a great artist you are..... 💙💚💛💜💜❤❤❤
.
Love you Lindsey Stirling!!!!!!!!!!
Lindsey this is amazing. WOW
Eres  increíble    tienes  mucho    tales  y sobre todo   muy    valiente   😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘...
... it must have hurt... You looked like you were going to break at the end. I'm not comfortable with that myself.
WOW!!! You are Incredible!!!!!! :))) Love You!!!!
Oh WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW Amazing
As someone who plays violin as well (and recently got an injury from it), this looks insanely hard and painful, but so, so beautiful and I’m so proud of you Lindsey!
That was insane.   Unlimited amount of determination and bravery.
DANG
WOW !!!!  you did super!  That piece of music goes really well with that kind of dance. You had me in tears for you.   well done!!!
Wao sehr schön wunderschön
Simply beautiful and breath taking. But wasn't worth your pain and tears.
Amazing!!!
😱
A Lindsay é um exemplo de profissional que se dedica para sair do comum e sempre inovar com sua arte ❤️
C'est une solution un peu exteme pour faire de la musique. Vous aimez vous torturer ? Il serait peut etre important de prévenir ceux qui voudrait faire pareil que cela doit se faire avec un entrainement particulier. Cela peut etre dangereux.
GOOSEBUMPS
That looked like it hurt but you did amazing
YOU DID THIS! i'm so proud, this is beautiful and i really know how difficult was but LOOK AT YOU. You are amazing, AMAZING 😭😭
Сказать что я охренел от увиденного это как промолчать.. Браво Линдси👍🇺🇦❤️
Amazing!! I loved this so much! I know how much hard work you put into it and in the end it was beautiful ❤️ I cried happy tears from how proud I was of you!!! Happy Holidays! ❄️
i knew you can do it <3
Как человеку с длинными волосами, который часто на них садился, даже  смотреть на такое больно. Не представляю, как так можно. Очень красиво и эффектно, но это же издевательство над собой
This is amazing! Well done 😍 this is my new motivation video, what an incredible job you've done 😍
It was amazing to watch, I saw you practice hard and surpass yourself and I don’t know you but I’m proud of you.
After watching her training for this it makes it 10x as beautiful knowing how much she had to put in to do this routine
Ow
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤❤❤🤩🤩🤩🤩
An old favorite. WOW!
MARAVILLOSO!!!!! Simplemente hermoso. Gran talento Lindsey Stirling!!!!!! <3
Stunning performance from a stunning performer. Endless time paid off as well as sharing your talent with so many.  I adore the viper. ♡
Insane. Through pain and diligence you made it! Bravo!
Столько труда и слёз , ради такого шикарного выступления , не вольно думаешь , как же надо любить свою работу , с трудом подбираю слова , глядя на красоту видео и её красивую исполнительницу .  Обязательно поделюсь с друзьями .
You did I'm so proud of you for doing it I watched the before video
This is just a new direction in violin dancing, with an increased degree of freedom of movement and a potentially richer set of gymnastic elements)))
Lindsey,  I am so stinkin proud or your cute little self! That look of determination on your face during this performance was awe inspiring! Every time I watch this I get reminded of how we are capable of way more than we realize! Thank you for that!!
Beautifully done!
To painful. All i can do is ask why?
Lindsey, I hope you see this because your bravery inspires not only me but so many others. They way you take challenges and keep fighting them is beautiful! Sure you are talented, but it is your heart that makes this and everything else you do mean so much more. This was beautiful and i think i can say we are all so proud of you,  you go girl!
Lindsey TE AMO Saludos desde México ❤️
incredible!
After watching the previous video and knowing how much pain she was in, please tell me that I'm not the only one that was holding back the tears at the end of this.
Amazing job, but please don't cause yourself pain like this again, It's heart breaking
bravo.
truly breathtaking!
Честно говоря даже не верилось что она реально играла на скрипке -  когда она очень быстро вращалась))) Сложно в это поверить. Ну если она это действительно смогла))) - то теперь её точно можно в космос отправлять))) Надеюсь Илон Маск это увидит и она сыграет на скрипке в новом фильме что хотят снять Илон Маск и Том Круз.  Короче пора Линдсей отправлять на МКС)))
You did it!!! Lindsey, you are an inspiration. Whenever I feel overwhelmed  or in pain, I will look to this experience you went though and tell myself ‘if Lindsey can persevere though the pain, I can.’
Brutal!!!!
Just Wow . Thank you !!!! BIG hug
Why wasn’t this on Americans got talent?😅
You make me cry, but you have overcome your fear and you have made your dreams come true.  Do what your dreams bring you.
That's a great creation. ❤️❤️❤️
WHOA!!!!
Like honestly ARE YOU OK THIS LOOKS LIKE IT HURTS A LOT PLEAES RESPOND TELLING ME YOUR OK OR IM GONNA WORRY
this is one of my favorite songs... and the performance was STUNNING   i'm just worried about how painful this looks, but putting that aside... incredible!
Hard work paid off. It looks amazing!!! Well done and good jib not giving up.
You DID it, Lindsey! So beautiful!
She did an amazing job!  Through the pain you could still see the passion she has throughout the performance. She certainly worked hard to prepare for the performance, physically, emotionally,  and mentally. You did wonderfully Lindsey!
So amazing. You rocked it!
Always impressive and inspirational.  Thank you for sharing this performance.
As I watch this my stomach is in knots lol
Невероятно!!! Смотреш и не веришь в происходящее, Круто...
We are proud of you, Lindsey! You did a great job! God bless you!
Everything you wanted to convey with this performance you achieved.  I'm overwhelmed. I'm proud of you <3 You did it amazing!
The most impressive performance I've seen a living person ever do
You go girl! Strength and power are yours, for us all. Thank you for sharing this and your journey. You are an Inspiration to us all.
That was so cool did it hurt your head or your neck but that is so cool.
Lindsey es perfecta yo algún día me gustaria tocar el violin como ella te quiero lindsey.
Oh my cat!!! 😦 you are a beautiful woman!! Impresionante!! No había visto nunca nada igual! Estoy en shock, eres increíble!!! 👏👏👏
Amazing you are so wonderful love it
I love your music and your way of being, you are a great person and hey, you did it, you suffered but the fruits are beautiful, thank you for making an effort to show us, it's a beautiful show.    amo tu musica y tu forma de ser eres una gran persona y hey  lo lograste sufristes pero los frutos son hermosos gracias por esforsarte para mostrasnos es bello espectaculo
Incredible! Your strength, determination and sheer willingness to try something new is an inspiration. Blows your mind. As incredible as the performance was, glad you're not going to try it again. The pain you must have been in, can't imagine it. She looked beautiful, poised and graceful- hard to achieve when you're hanging by your hair - only Lindsey could do it
Amazing job, hard training and being almost in tears... Definitively painful. Congratulations for having the power to do this !
больная!!!
She will never cease to amaze me🤩🤩🤩
😮😮😮 amazing!!! Congratulations for the show and warm thank you Lindsey 👏👏👏
Wow
Awesome, and it reminds me every time, since your first performances: we need more Violin Dubstep!
C'est capillotracté, Bravo !
To think that the judges at AGT once voted her off... what do they even know.
This is not good for your nack and hair. Pleas stop doing it again.
That was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen! And knowing the pain and effort it took to pull off... wow!
Your special soul inspires me love you
It's was beautiful, thank you so much, Lindsey, for this piece of art. Your effort and pain paid off. You are incredible.
Dont hurt your hair It was riskful i think
Lindsey eres toda una obra de Arte ,  Hermosa ,talentosa y dominas muchas artes para mi la mejor del mundo..💜 Saludos de Chile 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
Loving you Dear Heart.
I gotta say this is one of my favorite songs that you perform.  It was the first song I heard from you that drew me to want to hear more and buy albums (some of them are even signed), but when I saw your hair hanging preparation video I literally teared up, because of all the pain and stress you put yourself through to accomplish this.  I guess I just want to say that I am a fan because of your musical talent, zest for life and overall personality, the hair hanging stuff unless it is something that you wanted to prove to yourself that you could accomplish wasn't necessary.  Merry Christmas and take care over the holidays.....much love.
I loved it Lind! You're SO talented!!  This part of the show brought me in tears! I Love your music, I love your dancing and I love what you do... I love YOU!
*stands up* BRAVO, Lindsey!
Спасибо за красивую музыку.за танец и всю красоту исполнения😄
Lindsey sweetheart you don’t have to do that to show your love for the violin. I love you!
А если кожа на лице вытянется по вертикале? Глазницы выползут на лоб и глаза перестанут попадать в дырки для глаз. Видать её в детстве мало мальчишки за косички дергали.
You're insane. And I have so much respect.
i don't even know what i just watched but amazing as always
so much talent, so much passion, so beautiful, you're such an amazing person Lindsey, just wow... 😍
Juste WOUAHOU 😍😍😍 Après ces nombreuses heures de travail, de douleurs et de migraines...chapeau bas Mademoiselle 👏👏👏 c'est un spectacle magnifique De très bonnes fêtes de fin d'années.
did someone else teared up as she inhales and lifted her feet from the ground or was it just me? what a beautiful performance <3
Wouw something so incredible, never have seen something like this before! Golden Award medal for you!🎻🩰🧚‍♀️👑🌟💫🙏😇🏆🏅 Sending you so much love and blessings! Merry Christmas and a happy year! 🎄🎉🌈💜
The way you control everything (direction, speed and all) while you're hanging in the air ?? both 12-year-old me idolating Lindsey and 21-year-old me now are in awe of what we just saw !
Wow. As always excellent🌲🖐
Bravissima meravigliosa.🌻
Lindsey, that was amazing !!! You are crazy 😆🙈 also in good meaning .I hope that your neck is all right 🙏🏻. Waw I don't have words. It was insane and perfect ❤️
R.I.P. your hair
Bravo 👏 👏👏👏👏😭
Wow, just wow.  I can't even imagine how hard it was to go through that pain every time you trained.  I would have quietted. Definitely. It's very inspiring to see what someone is able to do by sheer power of will.
Merry Christmas ❄️☃️🎄
😳😲😯😮 WOW 👏👏👏👏👏
Absolutely incredible...please know in our hearts you got a towering ovation for that.
Que dolor
This looking so hard. But is this worth it?
Can we just say, “Wow!!!!”?  You never cease to amaze with your gifted talents! Thank you❣️❣️❣️
I would pay anything to watch performance.  This is simply ONE WOMAN SHOW. Just outclass
WE’RE SO PROUD OF YOU LINDSEY!!!💗
I am literally breathless after watching this. Lindsey, you are not only vastly talented (which we all already knew) but truly inspirational and a beautifully strong woman. Your journey through the ordeal of training for this performance was truly awe inspiring and has really helped me with my own journey with chronic pain and I just wanted to thank you for sharing such a personal and vulnerable experience with us. You have changed my outlook on life and I am eternally grateful for it.
I watched the previous crystalize, when it was released and wanted to tell you that this was amazingly brave performance that I've seen. It must been hard making this. You're SO brave AND SO strong, not only psychical but most be emotionallly and mentally to do such a brave performance xx
один из очень редких случаях когда я аплодировал перед компьютером и разбудил соседей.
Красота и дикая боль под шикарную музыку... Браво! Я такого ещё не видел!  IT'S REALY AMAZING!
wow well done on all you went thru for this, was well worth it
WoW
I can only say one thing: U ARE AMAZING!
I can't bring myself to like this video. my wife deals with a couple different mental disorders, and she has a history of self harm. that is what I thought of when I watched this. using a harness would not have taken than much away from this video. there are plenty of things there are excellent physical and mental challenges. hair hanging is not one of them. hair hanging is more like something you do to someone if you want information out of them.
Suffering for one's Art has a long history, but there comes a time when suffering should end, and be replaced with the vibrant joy of expressing your gifts on a celestial scale.
AMAAAAAZZZZIIIINGGGG!! YOU DID IT!! Thank you so much for sharing your journey to this beautiful performance!
Magnifique très jolie à regarder j adore et félicitation à cette artiste que j apprécie énormément bisous à elle 😘😘😘
Just wow
Видел твои тренировки перед этим выступлением . Ты просто молодеец! Это вилеколепно и потрясающе!)
Wow, it must be really painful. I just grabed my hair and pulled and it already was pretty discomforting.
Hey lindsey you did an amazing performance and love to see you live again and love all of your previous videos and you inspire alot fans and im very proud to be a huge fan of yours and keep on doing what your doing you have inspired alot of fans
Amazing!!!
bravo !!!!!
I love that she chose to share the struggle of the process, not just fight through it to bring the audience something magical and move on. There's an art to stepping up and making something look effortless, but in this case, I'm glad she shared the journey instead
This is even more incredible to watch, after knowing everything she went through, before reaching this moment.  Lindsey Stirling, you are awe inspiring!
👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏
Love your videos always so amazed at you playing. Ability to perform and act/dance at the same time.
Wooooow!!!!
It's  amezing.. But she isn't playing a live... When she play so clearly and dance like this then I goona be very surprised
I don’t see the need for it, no matter how much you want it, it seems like self-punishment
Einfach nur der Hammer! Hut ab, ich könnte das bestimmt nicht...
Misión cumplida, te felicitó mujer!👏👏👏👏❤ Vi tu proceso y dolor. De verdad te admiro Lindsey😊
Wow, ouch, Crazy.....Beautiful
Lindsey, my wife, myself and daughter watched your special on the 19th.   We were all truly inspired by your stories and your faith!  Thank you for being brave and courageous, especially in a world in which it is becoming increasing hard to do so.   Your faith story about being the least of these touched my heart and reminded me of this Bible verse that I have posted in my home :) Wait patiently for the Lord . Be brave and courageous. Yes, wait patiently for the Lord . Psalms 27:14 NLT  Thank you for your music, your videos,  and your faith.  Your special was a much needed injection of Joy to all this 2020 Christmas Season who watched.  Merry Christmas and God Bless!
wahou <3
Отлично
Absolutely stunning performance. Hypnotically beautiful. Masterful choreography and videography. Worth the agony and soul searching I believe in the end. Nobody else on the earth can do that!
So perfect 😍
Зачем?
Lindsey, I'm so proud that you accomplished your goal! I saw your previous video and know how much work and pain you had to go through. Your performance was stunning! Just know though that wether your dancing, handing by your hair, or just standing still, we love to hear you play. Do what you want to do. 💜
مفيش موسيقى جديدة بقى يا ليندز 💔
10 gold medal even Guy Laliberté would  be amazed with your talent you are muse euterpe in the flesh
Amazing, desition and a lot practice.
It is really amazing!!
Lindsey, excelente y tremendo video.!!! Felicitaciones.!!!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Oh my. Lindsey was probably is a lot of pain and extremely dizzy afterwards but she killed the Performance and made it cool while doing it. I hope you did not get hurt. If you did please recover safely and don’t do some that again even though it look way cool. You Sister Stirling are way more cooler than this video which I give a 100,000,000,000 stars out of five if I could. You are so love as well.
I saw your last video and all the work it went into this and I just wanted to say: WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU
I'm soooo proud for you!!! That was amazing - You're the best!!!  # DeepLove 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Remarkable!
Ladies and Gentle men! the one the only Lindsey Stirling!!!!
phenomenal
😯😳
Неймовірно...
It looked lovely but I bet it was pretty painful to do. Artists really do suffer for their art. But I admire the courage to be able to do what you did. Congratulations Lindsey x
why?
Wow! Whatever brand of shampoo you use should give you an endorsement! But you pulled it off in grand style, so stay earthbound now!
Just wow!! All your hard work paid off. This is so breathtaking it gives me chills every time I watch this performance. Thank you for such a beautiful gift. 🙏❤️😊
Glória a Deus
Beautiful, just beautiful, she is so talented and always so original. I am very proud to be his fan. I love his art, his character, and his incredible way of teaching us to improve every day.
That was a beautiful performance showing both inner and outer strength. From here, you're getting a very loud, very long standing ovation.   Merry Christmas and thank you for the Crystallize video!!!
Cuando pienso que ya no puede sorprenderme más saca un nuevo video y lo hace con cada uno ese es tu ídolo el Mío sí🇲🇽
I AM CRYING I AM SO CRYING 😭
R.E.S.P.E.C.T. My jaw fell on the floor 😲🤯
Your dad must be proud
Wow, that's великолепно, блискуче, amazing!:) I just adore of her creation and patience for this stunt! Bravo!🌹
You are amazing! Congratulation dear Lindsey, love you! God bless you.♡
This was absolutely beautiful!
It was beautiful, but never do that again,  😁   😎👍🎶✨🎻
Okay I don't remember the name of the big blue hard who said that this girl just was sounding like sick rats and he needs to eat his words and publicly apologize what can be more difficult to spinning around dizzy while maintaining a perfect arrangement!!! This girl should have got Entertainer of the Year every year!!!
I am speechless .... Moved and thrilled by so much Splendor! Skill and Beauty ...🧡
I could tell by the looks on her face she was straining
Just AMAZING 🙏
I'm sorry, but I gave you a Thumbs Down on this one.  You crossed the line of what is Art and put yourself into a dangerous situation for the sake of Sensationalism.  We all love you for your talent,  you don't have to be a Daredevil to keep us as your fans.
Amazing  y bella como siempre 😊 te admiro mucho guapa!
I may be the only one that feels this way but after she posted what she had to go through to do this, i could fully enjoy it cause i knew she wasnt fully enjoying it. But it was still amazing. Just in the back of my mind i know she is holding back strong tears
mesmerizing
Was ist das für eine tolle Frau,ihre Musik und Performance ist toll..Mach weiter so..
Fantástico.. Extraordinário...
Loved this but don't ever do this again. I know it cost you so much in pain from your previous video! We don't want to see you hurting!
Such a masterpiece!!
I watched the previous  video and could see how hard that was on you but oh my goodness that had to be the most  stunning thing I have ever seen. I was frozen with goosebumps.  Im so proud.  Well Done.
This version made me cry. Thank you for your work and share your feelings to us with your music and talent.
This was absolutely incredible! Lindsey the pain you went through was so worth it, im in awe of this! You should be so proud of yourself 😍
Girl you are so talented!!!! The things are doing and will soon do in the future! This only shows you what YOUR CAPABLE  of !!! I couldn’t do this even if I tried the pain would be to much! But look at u! LITERALLY INSANE!
You are the best example. We always carry our limitations infront of us. You carried your limits million miles in the past weeks.
It gives me hope and inspires me. And makes me cry. Please continue sharing your joy and your sadness with us. Thank you.
Awesome!!!
YOU DID IT! It was Fantastic, absolutely breathtaking. Now please get some ice for what I'm sure is a sore head.
You can see the determination in her face at her first take off. So proud of you but that looks incredibly sore. Once is enough :) But splendid job
Espectacular!
How did you not cry from doing that. Plz never do that again, your safety is also a concern for us too.
You amazing
Beautiful performance! But knowing how much pain you’re in, please make it a one off 🙏🏻
Magnifique bravo.
Epic, it was inspiring and ethereal and yet felt so painful that I winched through the screen. But oh so enthralling that it was hard to look away. You create some of the most beautiful video's around music Lindsey, so stay strong and do not let pain or anything else stop you from showing the world the beauty that in your music. Thank you for this. <3
Love you Lindsey! I've followed you since almost the beginning. This might be one of the coolest effects I've ever seen you pull off, but this is also the first video of yours where I literally don't recognize you. There is no joy and happiness and "sparkle" in your eye for this performance. I watched the video showing what you did to train for this and I seriously admire your dedication to your craft. At the same time, I hope to continue seeing that light inside you that no one else can dim.
Wow! Amazingly Angelic Grace!
c'est super vous avec pas mal au cheveux
Simply Amazing. Well done.
This is basically self parody.
Absolutely innovative! We enter the epoche of Air and Heart today, this looks like spirit of this time..) Thank you, Lindsey, for being soooo brave, open minded,  perfectly beautiful and endlessly alive..!
admire your patience
Wow!!!!
😵❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍 Amazing!!! Without you my music's world couldn't exist You are the best!!!!!
I love L S and her music. Thanks for bringing us hot violin music from this century. ❤️
This was straight up nuts! My scalp hurt just watching you! lol You did amazing! Hope you have a wonderful Christmas Lindsey & crew!
ALGUIEN HABLA ESPAÑOL??
😯😯😯😯😯👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤
Simply amazing! Only this girl can make me cry with her music! 1000 kisses from Italy, we love you!
I'm very impressed with your ability to set a goal and achieve it.  Now that you've done so...I hope you're going to go find a new one and not stick with this...because watching how much you suffered was not fun.
WOW!!!!!Beautifully done you did amazing and so proud of you for stepping out of your comfort zone.
Right on, Lindsey! You are the definition of go big or go home. Love you!
You are incredible. That is so amazing
anyone else get extremely nauseous after watching her spin like a jet turbine?
Wow... beautiful as always
NO WORDS !! WONDERFUL !! HIGH LEVEL (PERFORMANCE AND MUSIC TOO) ... !!  _ GOD BLESS U
Very impressive, this was really incredible to watch!
That viper is rad. I think the hair pulling would hurt a lot though
This is amazing!!! From Russia with love! Ty 4 your music!
Классная композиция  ,  ей не больно ?
That was both terrifying and stunning at the same time. Beautifully done. But if you want to do something beautiful stick to pointe or something a little less dangerous. Still all I can think about is how badly I want a Christmas ornament like this. Merry Christmas Lindsey, you look amazing as always ❤
Cohen19 is a hoax for Redistribution of Wealth
Wow!  Beautiful performance!  👏
🌻🌸🌺🌹🌼💖🌼🌹🌺🌸🌻🙋‍♂️
Very very nice 5⭐😉😉😉😉
Now that's dedication to something you love doing, absolutely beautiful Bravo Dancing Violinist..
WOW WOW WOW !!!!
Can’t breathe when watching this, so insane. So much love for this hero of my life - Lindsey! 🤍🙆🏼
Almost 30 training sessions and baby girl you did it!
Wow that's Talent!
asombroso como se sincroniza con la musica  el toque de su violín
You did very good and I’d say you did something that most people wouldn’t even dare to attempt. Be very proud that you were able to do this and show others that if they stay with it they too can accomplish whatever they set their hearts on doing despite the hardships it takes.  Very proud of you and all that you’ve been able to do and all of those that you’ve inspired along the way ❤️
Why only 1080p available? This was captured on super cameras with 8k+, and only low quality FHD in production???
That was Extraordinary!!!!!!!!  AMAZING LINDSEY!!!!
Be proud of yourself, you did great, Lindsey <3
I can only image how bad you wanted this but also happy you are in completing this. You emotion and passion shows in your art. This was spectacular, but please don't put yourself through that sort of emotional toll again. Happy Holidays
You did it😭 ... you showed the world again that you can do everything that others thought impossible♥️
You are amazing! ❤
Won’t need a face lift after that. Pretty amazing and weird at the same time.
Love your video there on home for the holidays. The videos of hair hanging so impressive and the fact you stayed with even with all the pain you are a true artist in your own right. It takes a lot of courage to continue even though you're in so much discomfort. Always enjoy your videos they're so breathtaking the music is so soothing always look forward to seeing more of your videos. Thank you for producing this beautiful beautiful video for all of us and may you stay safe and sound and have a great holidays everybody thank you again Lindsey for beautiful video and your soothing music  for all of us.
черт, нет слов
this was amazing, but i couldn't help but think how painful that must've been.. props to lindsey though for testing her limits AND making awesome art. love ya girl! 💕
Difficulty: legendary.
Absolutely amazing
I liked the music. Good remake. However, I couldn't enjoy the video knowing how much pain it caused (I just watched your training video). Please don't do something like this again.
creative idea! adorable shampoo ad! You are crazy and lovely
wow....
This looks gorgeous, yet incredibly painful.  The things you put yourself through for entertainment are things we do not deserve.  You are an absolute treasure and an icon.
That was AMAZING!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yes, you did! Love you
saw your previous video when you released it- you looks so close to tears throughout this entire performance. such an amazing job.
Pequena Lindsey, o seu esforço foi recompensado pela excelente e bonita apresentação. Abraços do Brasil.
Absolutely Amazing, thank you
That was just beyond awesome!!!!
magical
Liebe Lindsey, das sieht toll aus. Du hättest Dir das aber nicht antun sollen. Irgendwo muss Schluss sein. Denke an Deine Gesundheit. Weinen für eine Show musst Du nicht. Du bist toll genug ohne sowas. Ich liebe Dich ❤️ Dario
schwachsinnn
this is indeed, astonishing 💖
Great song but don't hurt yourself, Lindsey!
I have no words. Wow. Painful yet artistically beautiful. You are the epitome of sheer will. You set your mind to it, you achieved it.
Sieht ja super aus, aber warum tust du dir das an ? Du hast das nicht nötig !!! Dir so viel schmerzen zu zu fügen ! Du bist eine super Musikerrin. 😘😘😘👍
This is just beautiful. Thank you, Lindsey.
woah
Jaw dropping!
Wow
Je pourrai dire que j’ai vu un ange et entendu sa musique . Immense et Grandiose Prestation ✨🕊❤️🕊✨
It's your journey so I can't fully understand; but I can absolutely appreciate the effort as much as the art which are both outstanding.
Es impresionante saludos desde México
After having seen the vlog, I’m just cringing watching this knowing the pain you had to experience for this!
Insane
Wow! 🤯🤯🤯
absolutamente incrível!!!!!
I swear half those views are from me.
Amazing performance!! Captivating!!
The determination and focus on your face so inspiring
l LOVE YOU LİNDSEY...♥️
=O Speechless.
Amazing! You mastered this challenge perfectly! But the best thing is: You never have to go through this again. One of your best videos. You proved again that you can achieve or master anything if you just want to.
Дивовижно!!!!
Spectacular!  For what it's worth, this, and the vlog video preceding it, have helped me get over my own recent painful life-changing event..I had a heart attack, am only 47 years old, and (up till now) an amateur athlete, woodworker, and doctor.  Watching you, the painful training and the beauty of the end result, has filled me with hope I might get my life back, despite the pain I have been enduring too. Thank you.
Она просто бесподобна...!!!
Just WOW!
C tjr la MM choses...
I was tearing through the whole thing. This performance cannot leave one indifferent. It is like watching someone walk the rope and never breathing till they are safely on the ground again.   This was ethereal, piercingly beautiful and so brave. Hat off for you, Lindsey.
Very good.
Lindsey Stirling please don't ever do that again, We don't like seeing you in so much pain plz.
That's just WONDERFUL. I can't believe it. Such an amazing performance. Lindsey, you're incredible. I love all of the shows you  make. Congrants for this. Love you so much. 💖🇲🇽🎉
Insane and amazing... so hard top get there but the efford and sacrifice was completly worth... Really nice job!!
Why the way her hair is up and her makeup you can't even tell that it's Lindsey Stirling she looks so different this was amazing Loved you since AGT keep up the good work!!!
GEEEZ!!! Honey, you ARE power! Both in your talent but also in your mental fortitude to push yourself in your hair hanging training to give us this amazing video. Merry Christmas to your and yours from me and mine, here in Texas! ... And MANY, social distanced, HUGS!!!
Unbelievable 😮😍
Linsey, all the hard work, tears and pain. It was perfect! Thank you.
This is the most amazing dance style I have seen! And to play Crystallize to this was just perfect, because it's one of the songs that is most popular and started her journey. It was incredible moving to watch!
WOW, WOW, WOW!!!!!!
That was one of the best shows i ever seen, but no need to almost scalp urself for u fans. A nice dance routine is enough.
I teared up watching this, first of all, because I know how much pain this caused you and how much you practiced for this and still pulled through. Second of all, because this song brought back so many of my past memories and third of all, because it was just so beautiful and absolutely breathtaking to watch. My biggest biggest BIGGEST respect Lindsey <3
WOW :O, respect.
La seguo da anni. Spettacolare
Sei un' artista straordinaria!!! Bravissima Lindsay ❤️
Wooooow !!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What was the point? You look miserable during this performance. No joy.
Stupendo fantabulously fantasmagorically magical Performance.Love you Lindsay💜
That was just beautiful. You came such a long way to get to that point. Well Done :))
I really think everything she does is awesome but all the focus was on her hair and how that cannot be healthy for the scalp lol
Tô apaixonado nesse vídeo 😍😍
Art. With a big capital A. This is simply beautiful To be honest: This makes me think about Cirque du Soleil. Could easily be part of that show.
While I'm impressed by Lindsey's dedication to her performance, knowing how painful that was for her distracted me from how beautiful it was. Although if I didn't know she was in pain, I might have thought she looked angry.
LEGENDARY
Это просто офигенно!!!
W.  O.  W.
I like the song, I like you and I appreciate the fact that you were able to withstand so much pain for this long, but like others before me have already said don't ever do that again.
It’s beautiful, but I was hurting for, hope you didn’t get a headache.  If I twirled the many times you did, I’d be dizzy for a whole day.
incredible Lindsey what an amazing work you're unbelievable !!
This was amazing, along with your journey behind it.   Also, wondering why you didnt do this feat to "Take Flight". that seems like that would have fit this quite well too.
Me gusta mucho tu música 🥰🥰
You did it! I'm soooooo impressed!!!
AMAZING!
You are amazing! 💜This is amazing!💥 Well Done! 👊May the Lord keep blessing you and your music🙏I listen everyday 😀🤗
Lindsey Stirling in a nutshell..ok lets see what else i can do while i play violin.  We love you!
OOOOOUUUUUUCCCCHHHH!!!!! THAT'S AMAZING!!!
Just wow 👏👏👏
It turned out amazing. All you hard work paid off. One of your best videos ever!!
You did amazing! I know this was a struggle for you but you pulled through and made this amazing masterpiece! :)
Amazing work!
Просто феерический поток творчества.
This was amazing but that looks so painful
Супер!!! Очень здорово 👏👏👏👍👍👍👍
She is amazing 🤩
mission réussie , superbe prestation non sans remplie de sacrifice et de douleur .. gros bisous à ma petite fée du violon..ton père peut être très fière de toi. ❤❤❤❤
fake
I’m watching an angel ❤️
The blood, sweat and tears that went into that performance was breathtakingly beautiful. Fluid graceful movements without any wavering in your playing, absolutely a masterpiece!!!👏👏👏👏👏💙💙💙💙💙
Que hermosa!!!! Ella es tan genial!
Amazing show. It's great!
crystallize was the first thing I heard from Lindsey and what made me be fascinated by her wonderful music. listen to it again and this staging is just beautiful.
Looks amazing, but it doesn't look like you're enjoying. Please do things you love and don't put yourself on too much pressure. You're great either way!
So beautiful!!! Magnifico 👍❤️
Lots of respect! Real legend. Your efforts deserve more than a world.❤❤❤
Zbožňujem ju,ale dokáže to človek? Či je mimozemšťan?Veď sú medzi nami bolo by to normálné.💖💖💖❤❤❤🌺🌺🌺💝💝💝💯💯💯👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🥰🥰🥰💥
I remember when this song premiered.  To hear her play it again after she evolved her style is amazing. Same song but it has grown with its artist.
WOW. This was a beautiful and amazing performance.
truly amazing. Nicely done and gratz on conquering your fear.

To all the idiots that disliked this incredible feat. Why? Do you think you could do better? Are you that full of yourself? Please give me an actual reason for your disdain. I'll wait.
🤨
Woooow this is really amazing!!!
Amazing they did this at burning man a few years ago and it was awesome.
i'm proud of you Lindsey, I just finished watching your vlog today and just want to say that you are amazing and that even though you went though the pain of doing the training you push though it all and did awesome on the video. Merry Christmas!
🤘
Why?
Grande Lindsey, GRANDE!! 👏👏 Excelente trabajo que gran talento, no hay un momento donde dejes de sorprender con tu talento. Te amoooooo❤
Lindsey is just awesome.  She is so talented.  So graceful.  So cute.  I never get tired of her videos.
I watched your "hair hanging vlog" a few days before you released this video. I felt way more connected to the amount of effort you put into this video. It is truly STUNNING! And seeing the results after all that work is inspiring, I commend your diligence and commitment to get past those barriers. Thank you.
WOW, AMAZING, GORGEOUS, BREATHTAKING, FASCINATING ...
💕💕💕
That's not what music is about
Rotating that fast while while playing violin !  I will definitely faint feeling Dizzy 😵 (Even on rotating office chair)
I want a Statement.
How the frick is she able to play while doing that!!!!
There will never be another one like you, Lindsey 🙌🏻  I'm grateful to be on this Earth at the same time as you and be able to witness your talents 💕
Madness!!!! You are crazy! It hurts to watch. But I love you, you're the best on the violin 🌹💋
That most of hurt so much and there is no way I could of done that but you were able to do it and it looked amazing!!!
Awesome!
Beautiful, especially when we know the hardship behind the video. Thanks...
I'm not crying, my eyes are just sweating. 😭
WOW! Lindsey you outdid yourself once again! Bravo!  Imagine if that was your  audition  on A G T years ago,  the judges would have fallen out of there chairs! I bet they're  falling now!
❤️Well done! Looked so beautiful, even with the pain! ❤️
Bello 😁😁😁😃😃😃😍😍😍
Everybody needs to look up the word "catharsis" and read the definition carefully. If you don't know why Lindsey did this - catharsis. Art isn't always sunshine and roses - sometimes the artist needs it in order to heal and pain can be one of the greatest healers in life.
I love all your performances, but this time honestly I fell bad for all the pain you where feeling, it was awesome but you don't need to go to that extreme, you are amazing every time!!!
Amazing !! You are a real Wonderwoman !! 😘😘
Mother of your hair 💖💖💖
this is insane! wow,  I am speechless... bravo!
I only have one hair straw on my head, so this would not work for me.
It's marvelous !!! Great !
Dear Lindsey and all who are reading this comment,       I saw your hair-hanging vlog video and I saw how much you were struggling to grasp this new concept. You said that you were scared but you were going to push through. As I watched it you also said that the people watching are going through hard times and, let’s be honest. We all are. I just saw you crying in the video but wanting to push through for the sake of entertainment and for that I say you did really well! Keep pushing through Lindsey and keep trying and getting back up. You are the inspiration for so many people and you have touched so many lives with your music.       Sincerely,  Someone on the internet.
U r so good on that violin I like the new violin u have
You did it! Way to overcome your challengesand fears!
I think we need to acknowledge the epic mountains she inspires- Lindsey, you ARE!
We Need To Make This Video VIRAL guys, for Lindsey! Share it with your family and friends! Let's show her our support!
Fantasztikus! Gratulálok!
Great job!! Amazing performance. 😀 But I agree, do not do this type of performance again. Your fans do not enjoy seeing you in so much pain.
Hey yeah you fought though it and still made it look easy and good. Bravo 👏 👏 👏
4:00
Gg
Truly an amazing artistic presentation.  We have seen what you endured in order to achieve this, and I hope that you did it for yourself, not for your fans. We will be just as happy with you staying on the ground and performing with love and emotion.
Ouch ;-;
I almost cried seeing her determination at doing such a thing. Hats off to you Lindsey
Прекрасно😍😍😍
Lindsey I'm so torn watching this.  You're so beautiful and graceful, and the flying effect is so elegant, but the fear and pain is so clear on your face. We know what you went through to make this, and I wonder if it was worth it.. There are acrobats that work for years to be able to do this hair lift, and having them flying to your music would have been just as beautiful.  I was afraid you could pop a vertebrae or muscle. I was almost in tears watching you go through this, both in practice and this performance. Thank you for what you do for your art.
Perfect
such a great job and so much heart . You did amazing and I respect you so much for doing it. You are such a great warrior.
No way could I do that! I watched the behind the scenes video first. It gave me chills to watch you succeed in this. Way to go! Merry Christmas!
Legend
Amazing job
NEVER AGAIN. It makes me sad to see u like this. This could have been fatal girl!
Lenda
I'm truly amazed at your strength and dedication Lindsey, it took you 24 tries, you could have quit and gave up but instead you chose to keep going. Now this performance is the fruit of your hard work and determination 🤯👏🏼
Maravilhosa
Linda
Perfeitaaaaa
It’s amazing how you were able to push through all the pain to get to this point! This is art❤️
Pain and art have gone together since the beginning of time. This was clearly a way to cope with the loss of the people she loves. She spelled it out plainly in the making-of video why she was doing this. What is harder - hurting your hair, or burying a best friend and a parent? You are all on here complaining to SEE her do this and meanwhile she LIVED it and came out the better for it. Stop judging people for how they cope with their pain. This may actually be her magnum opus. "It has to hurt if its to heal".
This is freaking amazing!  I auditioned to one of her songs and my last show was to one of her songs!  Love love love this!  Trying to do this while playing the violin is just amazing!  Bravo!!
Wow, How much dedication and effort issued and transmitted in this beautiful creation, thank you very much for giving us your art, time and passion....
WoW Gorgeous This is pure art! This woman is wonderful everything she does is magnificent
I'm glad I watched your hair hanging vlog first so I could see how much of a bloody struggle it was for you to train for this. And the result is spectacular. Thank you for sharing Lindsey
me gusta mucho tu musica pero porfavor cuidate  i am i love your music plis take kare plis plis  saludos desde la cd de mexico  cheers to mexico city
Greatness isn't the absence of pain, it's the determination to continue towards your goals despite the pain. This was a powerful performance made even more so by knowing the pain you went through to achieve it. You are an amazing person and an inspiration to so many. Thank you for this video, it's struck a cord with me.
Nổi da gà ...pain ....
Me arrepiei todaaaaa
Ouch being hung by your hair must hurt
Following you for a lot of years and I love this song the most. I saw your video about this -how-to-do-acrobatic. This is by far the best performance I have ever seen from you - breathtakingly good.
Are you human?
Absolutely Gorgeous,  My heart goes out to you for going thru this life changing experience. You have my total admiration. With love , a fan in Quebec Canada
Nice video! What kind of violin is that??
After all these years, Crystalize is still one of my favorites and I love Lindsey for doing it. It's only my opinion, but knowing what she went through to do this and how much pain it caused her (it was clear in her face), I have to say it wasn't worth it. I have to say that I found the whole hanging by her hair to just be distracting.   I still love Lindsey and her artistic vision when she creates her wonderful videos, but this was not one of my favorites. I think I'll just re-watch the original with her in the ice castle.
Crystallize was the first music I've ever heard from Lindsey :D So this is kinda how I've found about her))
Total respect for Lindsey 👏💯👏💯👍
The fact that anyone would dislike this floors me. She went through so much to achieve this goal for the sake of powering through & her fans.  Amazing & inspirational. 💕
You don't have to do these kinds of things to impress us!  We already thought you were very impressive before!
you are an example of what can be done with willpower you believed in yourself and achieved something sensational  takes pride in what you've done.  this year has been tough for the world but we have to go on and improve day by day like you did. thanks linsday
Amazing 😻 👏👏👏👏👏👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😘😘😘🥳🎉🎉🎉Unbelievable
wow lindsey ! wow!!

Beautiful dancing! I see a lot of comments saying you looked like you were in pain. But I respect your choice. I’m certain it was an informed decision for yourself. And I think it was a fantastic performance and I will not patronize you for it! Fantastic job and keep up the good work!
Lindsey how you doing this?! You are  very good🙂 but careful for your hair🤔
this is absolutely stunning lindsey! i have  watched you since i was just a little girl and your so stunning. this is amazing. you trained and did it. the fact that you went through h ty is pain but made something so amazing out of it.
Good for you to challenge yourself, Lindsey. But, OW!
You did it!! We can tell how hard you worked to do this and it is amazing! Thank you for inspiring us to never give up!!
Absolutely beautiful. To be able to work through the pain that you must have been feeling is beyond the professionalism of an artist it goes much deeper into your soul. To show us the inner fortitude you possessed to bring this concept from a simple melodic piece into such acoustic, visual and even visceral art is breathtaking. You amaze me with everything you do. Each presentation only makes me wonder where you will go from here.
I'm speachless . Woooow. Amazing. I can imagine how that's hurts
That was INCREDIBLE!!!!!!

Lindsey, you are a strong, elegant, graceful, beautiful woman and I absolutely love this song. It just hurts me knowing how much this hurts you. Usually in your videos I can see joy on your face, but this one just looks like it hurts you. Kudos for pushing your limits, but I hope you don't do this anymore, and I mean that in the most positive and supportive way. *hugs*
To be honest, you're more beautifull when you smile. :)
I watched the back story video on this ... kind of a miracle this came to be. I NEVER would’ve pushed through to do this ... and she pulled it off making it look like absolute magic!!! Never ceases to amaze!!
Awesome ❤
There are no words. Knowing about the long hours of filming and training. watched with bated breath. Many hours of pain for 4 minutes of triumph. This is truly a triumph.
I would have never thought that I would thumbs down your video... Why would you hurt yourself like this? :-(
Beautiful. This is a wonderful achievement, you can be proud of everything you've done to get there ! 😮😁🏆
It's unhealthy how much hard work and talent went into this, I am amazed beyond believe :O Outstanding job Miss Stirling, you are a living muse! Thank you fr these experiences, memories and all the positivity you bring to the world, very inspiring! Please do enjoy the holidays, best wishes :)
😮😯😲
You are a fine violinist and I follow your plays but this..this acrobatics..was it necessary?
You did it! You're awesome!
You are AWESOME!
You did it. You are really brave. thank you for the sacrifice. A beautiful ending for 2020
One thing noticeably absent in this performance:  Joy.    Not one smile.   But you accomplished your goal.  Pun intended:  You can now hang it up.
YOU ARE MAGIC - I LOVE YOU Lindsey.....wooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Beautiful
Lindsey!!! That was totally awesome!!! A major accomplishment indeed!!! Blessings always dear one!!!❤️❤️❤️
I <3 You !
What shampoo do you use?!? Oh my goodness ❤️
Toll, ich hoffe du hattest danach keine Kopfschmerzen :-)
the reason I love this section so much is because that's how I've always seen you Lindsey. a strong person who never gives up and will do anything even if it takes a thousand tears and some more. when I saw you in the air spinning for the first time, it was the most impressive thing I had seen in a long time and it still amazes me. seeing the process and all the pain you had to go through to do this just makes me remember why I fell in love with your art years ago. we love you Lindsey. from the bottom of my heart, have the best Christmas ever and I cant wait to see you in Mexico again ❤
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😍❤️❤️
Incredible!!! She is an ice fairy!!! The most magical thing I've seen in ages!!! Kudos!
honestamente me dejo al borde de las lágrimas, maravilloso trabajo!!!
офигеть тяжелое исполнение, лайк
O GOD
Absolutely stunning!
Es sorprendente está mujer
Art should delight both the artist and the art lover. But I didn't get any pleasure watching your video because I felt it was hurting you more than pleasure. I admire and respect your art. You didn't need to do that. 💙
Amazing loved watching...great job!!!!Hard hard work...you rock!!!!
So Strong and so proud
Wow 🤯 au my Hair
omgosh this is so beautiful. I watched the vlog i love that you put sooo much into it. it has helped me to pray in hard times i love thank you.
Unbelievable. Such a difficult thing to master there, all of it really but hanging from your hair. I'm astonished and humbled.
I mean wow Lindsey you did it. But the pain! You sure are one brave woman and have come leaps and bounds. This song is a masterpiece anyway but kudos to you. I mean seriously respect. 😍
Fantastic
I am so incredibly proud of you Lindsey!! Everything that you went through to make such a phenomenal video!!! A true inspiration.
Супер. Спасибо за творчество и труд.
Magic ❤ ma musique préféré ,  performances géniale juste BEAUTIFUL
As beautiful and amazing as this looked, it’s heard to watch because I know how much pain it was causing her and how miserable she looked. But she is so strong for getting threw it 💕
You’re fantastic, amazing! A real talent, a real devotee for music, dance and challenges! You made it! No matter what they say, sometimes it hurts learning new skills, but it makes your inner and outer world more abundent.
Keep it down, everyone! She's on the phone with Cirque du Soleil.
now she is a performance artist, bravo Lindsey👏 stay awesome, best....
В день 2 раза вот это упражнение делай позвоночник не будет болеть.
Brings a smile on my face, you are really awesome. And I guess this is great for getting a straight spine too. ;)
You are really admiring, surprising, my respects ! 👏👏👏👏
Having watched the making of video this is breathtaking.
You did so good even though we could tell that it hurt so bad but you were strong and stuck through like a stuff we have always known.
WOOOW you´re amazing!!!

Goosebumps....from the start till the very last second. What an unbelievable achievement made believable
I know you probably won't see this, but from the amount of work you put in via sweat... tears... your perseverance and dedication paid off.  This video was stellar, inspiring, and artistically beautiful! Thank you.

This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen! You must have been so afraid and hurt but it was really worth it! This is amazing!
Feliz Navidad 💐
Круто,даже дух захватывает.Вы классная,обожаю Вас🌹🌹🌹💞💞💞
Wow amazing performance! Beautifully breath taking,thats not easy to do!You go girl! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I really am worried about you just hoping your ok
This was amazing Lindsay, well done! I praise God for the gifts he's given you!
Yes Lindsey!!! We’ve seen how hard you’ve been working for this performance, and you were amazing!!!
I rarely comment on anything YouTube but this is really great. Thank you.
No words for how beautiful this is
Amazing to watch this having seen the courage it took day after day!  Beautiful!
This literally made me cry. And not just from how painful it looked, too.
Yay!! Now please never do that ever again. You did it once, no need to continue doing it.
Beautiful. But hard to watch 🙂
Like I wasn't jealous enough of you. WOW! Wow, wow, freaking AMAZING!!!
Anyone else notice that little smile she did at the end? It was kinda like she was thinking "Woooo I did it!" 🥰
Amazing, this was not easy, you gave everything from yourself. How long this clip take to shoot?
Lindsey, thank you so much for this video. It was so beautiful. You constantly elevate your caft, and that make you an inspiration.
What you achieved was amazing. You are fantastic.Good luck with your future challenges.
Just another one of your brilliant productions.
I watched the behind the scenes on the hair hanging. Wow! Just wow! That performance was amazing. You did it! It’s certainly not for the faint of hearts. You are a true artist and completely devoted to your craft.
woow :o
impressive, but very painful to look at the face
You Go Girl
Congratulation, you did it ! that was beautyful, a moment of grace and totly worthy  .
It is very beatiful for sure, but I find it  unnecessary. Lindsey YOU ARE already amazing, you don't need to prove anything.
Lindsey!! You're absolutely stunning and I truly admire your determination for making this video come to life! I recall that the album this song came from is how I had found you and I couldn't help but tear up a bit seeing how far you've come and I'm so excited to see what's in store! <3<3
So so Beautiful!!!
Stunning, what amazing ARTIST 👏👏👏, goosebumps all the song
2:40 that actually gave me so goosebumps..
Beautiful, I wish you a lot of success.
Awesome
pure magic
OH. MY. GOSH. THIS WOMAN IS INVINCIBLE SHE CAN LITERALLY DO ANYTHING 🤩❤️
I am both thoroughly amused, and thoroughly impressed. That was amazing.   Please take care of yourself though, I didn't realize it was hurting you until I read the comments.
Yeah it's impressive, but... why? Personally I like the original better if not just to avoid seeing the hair, it's distracting.
it's so beautiful but i can also see the pain you go through for this work of art of a dance. take care of yourself and merry christmas to you from me who lives in denmark
Lindsey you did phenomenal. So proud of you. Just keep praying keep remembering that with God all things are possible.  Thank you for all that you do and for being an inspiration. Merry Christmas !
WOW, you amaze me Lindsey. Beautiful 💞💞💞💞
Lindsey has some *strong* *roots*😆
Simply... breathtaking!
I love your music but please don't do this again or anything that causes you pain. I loved the song but it was hard to enjoy it, knowing you were in so much pain and scared.
Painful perfection.  I hope she never does this again, it hurt just watching it.  And now I have a new best recorded version of this song to await the release of
Bravo, Bravo young lady!
:'O
Beautiful
Having watched your previous video on what you went through, this is just WOW!!!!  You’re amazing.
Like👍
С этой композиции стал интересоваться вашим творчеством. Интересен вопрос: Вы занимались гимнастикой? У вас потрясающая пластика тела.
Meravigliosa, fantastica ❤️❤️
This really was a stunning performance. Respect for sticking with it and making it look easy. I really love this new version of Crystallize
So much pain ... for what!? Yes it looked amazing - or could have looked amazing if there was not such a permanent inkling of suffering in my visualisation when seeing that ... You are so amazing, but please be loving with yourself!
A) You are amazing! B) What the heck! C) How many violins you got? D) How long did you practice for this? Not like you woke up one day, went to shower and decided you wanted to dangle by your hair. And this is the result at the end of the day :D
that was amazing, but PLEASE never do that again! :o
An artist always has to come up with new ways to wow her audiance. Lindsey has this been tied before,? lets do it!!
I hope you are having a great Christmas Lindsey Sterling 😊😊😊☃️☃️☃️☃️💃
Strength, Precision, Art, Talent, Beauty. Don't take any for granted. Take on hardest tasks first.
That was beautiful. I'm proud of you (if that means anything coming from a middle aged mother on the internet)--only because I know how hard you had work to accomplish this and I know how much you wanted to see this vision through. But I was already impressed with you--all of us are.   We are good with it if you never, ever do this again.
Boynu kopmuyor kadının😫 YOU ARE VERY WONDERFUL😍
That was amazing, truly amazing job!!!
THE. BEST. ARTIST. ON YOUTUBE. PERIOD!
Lindo
WHY?.....
Woow this so beautiful and elegant❤️❤️
84 dislike?! Are you serius?!
Lindsey you are crazy but wonderful
Пожалуйста, больше так не делайте. Вы ведь огромную боль испытываете!
Lindsey! This looked incredible!!! The way you literally flew through the air AND played violin was so mesmerizing!🤍🎻❄ But aside from that, I saw your bts/vlog for the hair hanging. Girl, that's so crazy!! I've never seen something like that before! And I don't know how you stood the pain! I definitely wouldn't have even attempted what you did! I love my hair too much! I think it would've looked just as amazing if you had worn a harness! I feel so bad that you went through that pain to entertain us Stirlingites! Please don't feel like you have to do that! You are so strong!! You're so strong regardless of the hair hanging as well, you've come so far! I've been watching you from the beginning! We love you! KSLL🧡🎻🧡
Elegance in motion, I hope you have a beautiful Christmas.
Please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please  *Don't* ever *ever* do that *again!!!* We love your music we love you!!! That was really really good, excellent, amazing, but please I beg you please don't do that again 😭 We don't want to see you in pain.
I was hoping it would be released
Браво !!!!!
That's insane.  What's even more insane is how much she must've trained to do this. **edit** I found her vlog about her training after I posted this comment, lol.
INSANE !!!!
Wahou performance de malade
Lindsey is one tough girl. That must of hurt like heck.
The video is magnificent, especially when you understand the effort spent. It also lacks the disclaimer about "don't try this at home".
Que mulher foda 😍
Watching this is scary, yet incredible. Lindsey you are the next level of incredible.  Crystallize song now holds a new kind of meaning to me.
Le résultat est impressionnant, comme quoi le travail Pau toujours
wow. Even if I had hair and was thin that would've pulled me head off.
Stunning!  The ending is amazing! How in the world do you get the strength and fortitude?!!!
GRACIAS LINDSEY!!
WOW, SEI BRAVISSIMA!!! I LOVE U!!!
You go through all of this, FOR US. Wow. Thank you so much. You are so talented.
It was beautiful, but I hope you are fine? I don't wish you have an accident or to get hurt for my amusement. I have seen your previous video about this, therefore I worry about your health.
Beautiful but.. ouch
Wow what a performance. But she pushed the pain to achieve an awesome performance.
Молодец
Remastered version of the scene with Fay dancing in The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword
This was incredible. Great job. Loved it.
Wonderful! You did a really great job!
I saw your other video on learning to hang from your hair.  No offense, but I do not see why you would endure such torment.  From the look on your face, you clearly did not enjoy this.  You are beautiful and gifted.  You do not need to endure such discomfort for your fans.
Her hair is as strong as her playing. BLESS. ❤️🎄
you put so mutch Power into your videos, do mutch love. 😘😘😍😍😁😁
Lindsey, YOU ARE A ROCK STAR!    I saw what you put yourself through to be able to live this dream, and let me just say, you could have quit, and 99% of us wouldn't have been the wiser.  But you DIDN'T quit, and that is what makes you a star.   Thank you for this BEAUTIFUL performance.  You're such a gem to have in the music industry.  I'm going now to get all your albums on Spotify. ❤ you. ❤ your music.
Crystallize was the first song that brought me to Lindsey, and it holds a very special place in my heart. It's the song that has fueled my passions and dreams to be an artist. It is the song that has brought me through my teenage years- through foster care. I have a single Lindsey Stirling album- the only one I could afford at the time, and it has Crystallize on it and for a while it was the only thing I would listen to. I eventually expanded outward and now I have a job so I can buy more of her work, but this song is my everything. And hearing her play it again, doing something extraordinary like she always does, made me fall in love with it, and her, all over again.
Youre so incredible!!!! Wow thats really amazing and Hurts so much
Lindsey,  you are smart,beautiful, strong and  adored by many.  You dont need to go threw that again. And yes, you were outstanding.  Congrats on pushing threw the pain.
So a lot of hurt on her face
Это просто великолепно и завораживающе. Просмотр этого видео, и предыдущего, про тяжелейшую подготовку, заставляют поверить, что человек способен на все.
It is so beautiful congratulations 🎊 🥰🥰
wooow. Honestly no words, i was in awe.. I know this scared you alot but your pushed through! You are amazing lindsey <3 we all are proud of what you do and support you always in whatever comes next! Greetings from belgium~ *offers the best waffle!*
Beautiful performance! I saw the video about your training for this. Your  determination, vulnerability, transparency and ultimate execution is inspiring!! Love it!!
Just WOW!!!  AMAZING work girl! You are extremely talented and creative! ❤️❤️❤️
that vlog coming makes this from like a "o thats cool" to an audible scream from me " YESSSSSSS"  That background makes this so much more impactful then just a cool circus trick
Toujours plus loin dans l'excellence et la splendeur juste magnifique.
absolutely stunning. I hope there is much pride and happiness among the tears and pain.  A big part of me wonders if that realy is good for the body, but one can not argue with the resault.
Вау! Это невероятно!!!! Каждый раз я думаю, что: "Вот! Это потрясающе! Великолепно! Можно ли сделать что-то лучше?"  И снова вижу "Да", прекрасная Линдси сделала это снова. Удивила, покорила, заставила вновь поверить в сказку❤️ Спасибо за чудеса музыки и эмоции от невероятных шоу
Умница !!!
Magnificent!!!!! You are ART!!!!
Yeah that is beautiful, but God, did you see her face getting ready for the next lift?!  ... She didn't have to go through pain for this performance, I believe.
Really pretty and amazing work. Never again hurt yourself for a performance. It is not worth it.  You're talented, you don't need any tricks !
That’s incredible! Amazing, beautiful and elegant! Wow
Lo más bello de este planeta ver tocar y escuchar a lindsey.
Awsome
Wonderful! There is no way to describe this video! Fantastic. Congratulations on your work and may God always bless you.👏👏👏👏👏✌✌👍👍👀👀😁😁🎼🎵🎶🎵🎵🎻🎻🎻🎻🎻
This was so powerful, knowing what you went through to get there, thank you for not giving up, and persisting through the pain, we love you, thank for all you are doing for all of us, this is one of the best show I have ever seen and Crystallize is now my favorite, It was hard to see you in so much pain :(, I believe in you Lindsey :)
WOW, WOW,  is there anything this gal can not do & still be right on beat with the violin..
I knew you could do it!
Simplemente increíble!! Felicidades Lindsey!!
Impressive. Lindsey is very too involved for this art and our. She plays for us, she danses for us, she suffers for us. I respect her very much
All I can say is wow. Amazing and beautiful.
I wonder what iJustine thinks of this...since she is her friend
Use a band to protect your head and hair. Please don't hurt yourself. LOVE 😘 YOU
I love you 💚
Plenaaaaaa, ficouuuuuuu incrível!!!!
Почему я рыдаю?! Это великолепно!!!
So inspirational!💜💛💜💛
Fabulous crazy lady
Thanks Lindsey, that was amazing, i want to cry, but if you feel a pain, don't do this again, we love you so much anyway!)
That was gorgeous, but I want to say no matter how beautiful it is it can’t be worth the pain it took to make it, but then again I guess whether it was worth it in the end is up to you.
what is your goal :D but i like it
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍cool💜💜💜💜💜💜💙
The most beautiful video clip I've ever seen.❤️🧚‍♀️
Absolutely outstanding  x
amazing 👏!!
Спасибо!!!
Is she really playing at the same time ?  That's incredible..
Браво! Это очень круто! Аплодирую стоя!
This amount of dedication and practice is mind blowing. She just one of the hardest things to do. To amazing 🤩
T_____________________________________T
I can't even imagine how hard both physically and mentally this was, but you didn't give up and you did it.
Magnificent!!! Mind blowing. Just Wow!
Beautiful performance 💚😌👏👏👏
Hi Lindsey, The artistic performance was amazing and you worked so hard to accomplish that. We see and appreciate your ambitions, but please, next time choose a less "painful" way to prove yourself. Anyway, (for me) you are the number one person who can play on violin in the most incredible situations and ways. I mean dynamic situations :D Go Lindsey! Please, keep in consideration a bodyharness if you are performing (something like) this at live concerts, instead of hanging on your neck. I watched anxiously so as not to have trouble for your neck.
Thank you Lindsey for showing us that the impossible is truly possible with hard work, prayer and determination.  You are simply amazing with your talents.  Thank you for the extreme work you put in to bring this performance to all of us. And Merry Christmas.
Wow I saw only part of what you went through to do this. I’m in tears because it’s so beautiful!  I got no more words.......
wow you did it 🖖🤞
Lindsey is amazing!!!! I love to hear her play and watch her dance
The consummate performer.  Well done young lady.
impossible, excellent 💫👏👏👏👍
That hurt to watch and I'm bald. Respect to your guts.
Just looking at this makes my scalp hurt
Really cool, however its really unsettling seeing her hair pulled like that
Amazing 🔥🎶👌
Incredible job fighting through the pain for this beautiful performance!
Amazing!!!
She's unreal !!!!!!
Fui la única que estuvo preocupada de donde se sujetaba esa cosa a su cabeza 😨😬 pero ella es lo máximo ❤️👏
#Magnificent!!!
Circus Lindsey, but it won't make you taller,  great effort , an invisible string for the lifts might have been less painful
I'm so proud!!  It turned out amazing!!
Oh sad sad day when you have to showcase that dispicable mask.  You just lost me as has any other fool that supports wearing them! Bye, nice knowing ya🖤
wow
Hey!! You did it!! @believe!!
Undoubtedly she is very talented.. But I do have a question.. For her what shampoo does she use... Cause I am going bald here.😢.. And she's dangling from the roof by her hair.. 🤔
After watching the video you made to train for this video makes this video 1000 times more impressive and better. Thank you for sharing your music and passion with us and for never giving up.
Bravo!!! Amazing. Loved it.
One woman Crique du Solei show! I've watched you for close to a decade now and I am still in awe of how you've grown as a performer.
Congratulations on your strength and determination, if I could give you a million likes, you are extraordinary.
I love you! You changed my life! 😊
That was very beautiful and artistical but please 🥺 don't do it again. We prefer you healthy.
She’s just amazing and she’s become so elegant with her music yet still has that spun lines to her... she’s just awesome 🤩
I love her music without having to her suffer like this😥
The run up to this was such an uphill battle. I'm glad you came out with a win.
Wow success awesome
Woow you are amazing
Волосы на месте? Позвоночник вытянула? 🤦‍♂️
Ohhh Lindsey great 🙏 good bless u this was so amyzing 🙏i am so proud of u 🙏😇😘🇵🇭🙋🏻‍♀️u are the best
AMAZING
I wish this had been enjoyable to watch, but it physically hurt me to see the full video. You can see how terrified and how much pain she's in the whole time, and it's just not worth it. Lindsey, please don't seriously injure or get yourself killed trying to one-up yourself from this. You don't need to do that, we're here for your music and dancing, not dangerous stunts.
When you consider the Pain and Tears the Training cost, Lindsey has my fullest respect! I've seen the Training Video.
Hardcore art. Respect!
Still nothing new nothing changed with me still brook in the street still bad
Miércoles 30 de diciembre 2020 mañana 8:00 pm a 9:00 am noche Dominicana 'go talent Génesis krystal Graciano bejaran baile lindsey stirling _crystallize from home for the holidays) 🤣😭
Lindsey you really are amazing
Who else is in love with Lindsey and her music?
Simplemente espectacular 👏👍😍
Amazing. I wish it wasn't as painful as it is beautiful.
I need surgery, because my jaw is somewhere down beneath the table. You're the most awesome artist!!!!
If this is "from home", I want to live in your house
This looks so silly its hilarious
The pain I saw you go through in your "Home For The Holidays - Hair Hanging Vlog" video to achieve this... as amazing as the result is, this isn't healthy.
I love Crystallize, but I hated this version! >< I can't enjoy something when the performer's clearly in pain, some of us pick up on things like that way too much!
Ok, ur hairs are real.  What's next, hooks-hanging? Lindsey, you are great itself from the inner glow to the outer shine! Just stop yet) We so much love you darling!
3:55 "That's great Lindsey, now let's take it again from the top, places everyone, here we go!"
Que bien
No lo vuelvas hacer, eres talentosa pero el arte y el dolor no es buena combinación.
Круто 👍
WOW just WOW. The Kostum is beautiful. Merry Christmas Lindsey Stirling
ow, Lindsey, that must hurt so much but wow! 😊
I can't believe you actually went through with it, despite all the suffering. What I do know is that there is a love for what you do inside you that few people will ever experience. Your music is special, your choreography is special, your shoots are special. And as the saying goes, we are defined by our actions. You, Lindsey, are special. 💪🏼😎
Hi have a very merry Christmas  that was great more that word's can say wow your music is wonderful
It's incredibly cool. Thank you for the indescribable emotions. For goosebumps all over my body. Thanks for this video and for everything you do. Good luck with everything and a lot of smiles. Happy New Year. From Russia with love.
The MOST ununique talented violin player. It's awesome.
Hi Lindsey, I absolutely ADORE you! Watching this, knowing the intense struggle you endured to get here, made me cry. It is so beautiful and amazing. I still cannot believe you can play while dancing like that.   I took my wife to your concert in Houston, TX a few years back when we were still dating. I like to think that is where we fell in love. You are an integral part of our lives. I thank you so much for being the outstanding person you have grown to be. Keep doing what makes you happy.   All our love, Steve and Michelle from Austin, TX.
Truly AMAZING!
Okay.... This is the most crazy thing I've seen of all my life!!! We don't speak about a live but of amazing and dangerous performance It is just UNBELIEVABLE!! PS. PLEASE DON'T MAKE YOUR LIFE IN DANGER BUT NEVER ANYMORE!! YOUR FANS LOVE YOU LIKE YOU  ARE! YOU NEEDN'T TO PROUVE YOU ARE STRONG! I'm really so proud of you but I am so angry too and scared by you have made...take care you and be safe Love you
That was beautiful but please listen...dont ever do that again...the repercussions in the future you can experience ..your spine especially the cervical nerves and scalp..never do this again
Wow I'm impressed she pulled this off. It looks extremely difficult. It must've took a lot of practice for sure.
Better than Sofie Dossi!  Took my breath away!
trochę mnie przerażaja te włosy ..czy się ostaną... ale całość wygląda pięknie ;)))
Just stunning. You can be proud of yourself. You did it! ;)
Sending virtual hugs. 💗 (Beautifully done by the way. (Also hope you recovered quickly.))
Ouch!  I love your music ❤️ Just please be safe on your next video xx
I'm genuinely dizzy just watching that. Beautiful performance, overcoming your fears for this is amazing Lindsey. Great job. Happy Christmas/Holidays and God bless you. 👍🏻💜✨

It makes me speechless, i can't describe what as i feel i saw this, it warmed my Heart to see you. There is no appreciation I can give you for it . Thanks that I can see your Beauty and special Performance. I have never seen a better Performance before.
Wowowowowow!!)
Amazing performance and choreography! Knowing how much pain you endured to get this point, makes it even more impressive. Human endurance is a beautiful thing.
Breathtaking performance, one of the most beautiful and elegant Music videos you have ever made Lindsey.
Much respect! This is a great example of overcoming fears and obstacles indeed. I know this was a struggle and I am glad you accomplished your goal. Great job Lindsey!
Auaaaaaa... Hammerfrau :)
❤️❤️
Ого
Восхитительно.
Ow.
This is beyond beautiful than anything I’ve ever seen
Beyond beautiful but your poor head ouch!
I'm so happy you put this up where I can watch it over and over again! I watched the christmas special and I know it was so hard for you to do this! You should be soooo proud! This is absolutely amazing! Breath taking!!! ❤
DO NOT TRY THIS *EVER*
this is amazing; now you don't ever have to do it again
Мне будет приятно если кто-то посмотрит мое видео и оставит впечатление 😙❄️❤️💙🌨️🧡👣😙❤️💙🧡🔵🔵🔵❄️🌨️❄️🌨️👣❤️❄️😙❄️
Amazing 😭
This performance is mesmerizing, stunning and just incredible! The persistence to push through is the greatest display of courage and an example of not giving up.   Can we just take a moment to recognize her facial expression at the end? The look says it all - the overwhelming sense of emotion jumped out of the video and straight into my heart.   Many wishes to you Lindsey for continued strengrh, courage and an abundance of overflowing love. Thanks for sharing your talents with us. 💕
Absolutely STUNNING!!
You are so beautiful with your music, but what you did to make this video is above and beyond!
Good job very good
I know how much that hurt to do.  I am grateful that you put yourself through so much for our entertainment, but please don't feel the need to do things that hurt just for us.
OK Lindsey, you've gone beyond the call of duty mind over matter, but honestly to much sensationalism takes enjoyment out of the number when we know and see so much pain attached to it.  Please redo this number so we can enjoy the music this time please and thank you.  Mastery is one thing but renewing your mind is another.  Renew your mind by the washing of the word, the Bible.  It's not works that save us or heal us, but everything Yeshua/Jesus is and will always be, our everything.  Works come from that relationship as we walk by faith.  Much <3 sis and it was gracefully and beautifully executed A++++.
Это было великолепно! Чудесно! Я видела сколько ты работала над собой, преодолевала себя! Ты прекрасна! Ты вдохновляешь на подвиги!
Oh darlin I watched your prep video and have to say I DO NOT deserve it!  Beautiful as always.
👍
Very impressive Sister. Happy Christmas for Friday, please say hello to Peter for me. Love Sarah and the girls. Pickwick says she needs you, where ever whenever, no comprimises. Sam says she needs ham and Staffy says Uncle Peter I'm not you pet. Love you too Peter, from Sarah. 🌈
Wow, compared to your past version with dubstep, this version of Crystallize sounds more magical and grand without the dubstep. This was very good.
No lockdown, no crazy painful hair stunts. Let's end covid now and get Lindsey back to walking on water or dancing in the forest again.
I don't know how much sacrifice and pain you had to endure for those 4 minutes.  I know one thing - the end result is beautiful.  Until my hair roots hurt looking at this dance :-)
Amezing  , samtnig new with remake first hit
I've lost track of how many times I've rewatched the Home For the Holidays show now, and this was the high point in what was already a fantastic show, really glad those who couldn't get the main show can now see it in it's amazingness !
Well done for sticking with it when you felt you couldn't. Inspirational.
That's illegal... This is illegal... someone stop her she's breaking the laws of biology
Amazing 👌👌👌👌worth your painful practice and training.. Absolutely beautiful .. Merry Christmas
Это Просто Великолепно!!!
Lindsey you absolute LEGEND
WOWOWOWOWOW Lindsey that was beautiful. That song always gives me chills and with this I'm in uh!!!!!! thank you Lindsey  your amazing!!!!!
Seeing someone VISIBLY in pain does not make me go 'wow, beautiful anyways'.  This video is legitimately distressing.
Lindsey the goddess, you lift my spirits with your style girl. Never stop, you are amazing.
🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏
Lindsey, you gorgeous human being. First off... Absolutely stunning video, I was in awe the whole time! Though, I did want to reach out to say this... I admire your determination and grace and after seeing you finish this and how happy you are likely made this struggle worth it. But lovely, I want you to know that it IS okay to give up sometimes. You're not a failure if you decide to give up on something because you can always move onto something else and that something else could turn out to be bigger and better. Lots of love and Merry Christmas <3
Wow. AGT got it all wrong this whole time. Absolutely amazing 🤗
Having watched the blog about the training you went through for this, and seeing how flawlessly you performed this, I am emotional right now. The dedication you have for your art brings tears to my eyes. God Bless!
I've flown with you! It's magical! I love the weightlessness sensation! You're amazing, you're the only one... 🤩😍
Can you say "Dancing With The Stars Sure Fire Winner" ⁉
Wow that was intense and 3 months of emotional  training and you did it.  You  are phenomenal.
🌞🕊️🌈♥️🔥🌎🌼
Amazing! Spectacular! Breath taking! Way to go, Lindsey! 🙌
Okay Ma'am!! 🙏😁🙏
Thank you madame
Как же это одновременно красиво и жестко! Снимаю шляпу и аплодисменты, я думаю, что всей (почти 13 миллионной) публики.
Miss Stirling, it looked very beautiful and spectacular, but please don't take that risk.
It must be one difficult acts t perform She is the best in her fields she has my respect
That must been some demanding weeks to get there. But after all these years of personal growing and perfection the skills of music and artistic and dance. It is pure amazing. Gratulation Lindsey.
Wow
Your still amazing lindsay. In my opinion. The best violinist of all time.
💙🥺😭 I love Crystallize and Lindsey so much. This song means so much to me.
Hair we go again with another hairy situation that will leave your hair standing on end.
WOW ! Wonderful sight, nice work Lindsey
Cool!
Boynu kırılacak diski kayacak diye onun adına ben korktum sjdjsbjeb
AMAZING
I guess all the pain you went through was worth it, that was beautiful to watch!! You are an incredible artist and we love you without you having to hurt yourself so much❣ Prayers for quick healing! 🙏
That was so amazing! I think all of your hard work paid off.🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Lindsey, I admire you so much. Don't even think about what people say about your choices. This is what YOU wanted to do. No matter the reason, no matter how hard it was, no matter the pain...It was YOUR decision and you DID IT. You made a beautiful and an amazing work. I hope you feel proud of yourself because that wasn't easy at all. I admire you, your courage and dedication 💓 Congratulations Lindsey!!
I am so happy for you
Proud of you
you are a star. amazing. your audition was great. you were so brave.
no, better she just danced to the music than pretended to play(so it is noticeable that plywood is not good) the best clip "arena"!
think of all the money she could make doing conditioner commercials
The pain was obvious, so is the talent, also your relief when this impossible task was successfully completed.  Lindsey....... You are one amazing girl!!   FANTASTIC
Wooow!!!!! Wonderful.Merry Cristmas.😘😘💜🎄🎅🎁
Juste magnifique !!!  beaucoup de travail, le résultat est époustouflant  !! Bravo
Amazing absolutely amazing
WOW Lindsey!  You were Sensational in this Crystal Video!!! I saw your hair hanging blog & saw how much it took for you to do this! I can't wait to see you live one day!  Merry Blessed Christmas!  Love, Hugs, & Prayers, Jeanne 😊❤😇💚⛄❤🎄💚🤶❤🎅
Браво, Линдси!!! 😍😍😍
Lindsey.  You never cease to amaze me.  I've been following you since the beginning and I love seeing just how far you have come.  I love your dedication to you craft and learning new things.  You always want to know more, do more, be more.  You are truly an inspiration.  I can't even begin to fathom the pain and struggle you endured while learning this new skill and the routine, but you executed it beautifully.  I am so proud of you.  It was quite angelic.
Lindsey: "I can do this"
You can do this Girl
Fuori classifica. ❤️
CONGRATULATIONS!! Well done most beautiful ☺️ thing and and love it love you 😍 so much

Would love to see you live on day
Dope
Lindsey is so beautiful n amazing playing violin n dancing so much talent 😊😍
Spectacular! Awe inspiring!
Seeing that video of what she went through, physically and emotionally, in order to pull this off makes this impressive enough. But playing the violin this well while spinning in the air makes this even more incredible!
WOW  👌👏🌹🌹🌹🤩🤩🤩
is this a case, then art equal to pain? anyway it's magnificent appearance of your art
😧 *speechless*
Линдси, ты сумасшедшая, мне было даже больно на это смотреть.
It’s honestly hard to watch this, knowing how much pain she went through to do it, but this video is absolutely gorgeous. Lindsey Stirling, I love you so much! You are such an inspiration to me! You are so incredibly strong and talented! 🥰🥰🥰
Ох Линси, сколько же боли 😬
I love Lindsey and her music, but gotta ask WHY would she do that to herself? It's physically painful to watch... T.T
Amazing
I cried, this is so beautiful and powerful! I'm so amazed! You are so strong! 🖤
Lindsey is amazing and the performance was beautiful. So talented. I only wish I wouldn't have watched the preparation video before I felt for her knowing how much pain that caused and what she had to endure to preform that.
++
Lindsey! You're AMAZING! You just Redefined MultiTasking for me!  Merry Christmas!
It's very important to know how hard do this, spesially begining. interesting thing is  that even through the years of breaking walls it still is hard
This is so incredible & amazing! I'm blown away love love love this 🖤🖤
Respekt! wirklich. Aber, das ist wirklich bissl übertrieben Lindsey. Das brauchts du wirklich nicht. Wir haben deine Tränen gesehen( Training).  Singe!!! Du hast die schönste !Stimme! die ich je gehört habe!!! ( als du" warmer in the winter with you." gesungen hast) , dachte ich nur..... WOW!!!  She's just ...WOW!!...( mir fehlen bis jetzt noch die Worte). Ich hoffe im Herzen, Du hast nicht die Corona Fischer abgekriegt. ( ich setze ein Daumen 👎)
So uh... how much taller were you after that? Must have pulled every vertebrae apart a little bit.
Bravo
i bet that popped like all of her neck bones
I don't know how to describe it but i FEEL something. You're make this world so unusual. Thank you for your videos, my best wishes.
👏👏👏 you are incredible! ❤
Fantastic 😍🔥🔥🔥
Wow, you did it! What a great performance!! Congratulations!!!
Incredible! Thank you for all you do!
WOW!!!!! just WOW!!!!!!!
Very beautiful, it was worth all the suffering. congratulations!
Just   wow 👏  Amazing  Mesmerized
Pourquoi vous vous infligez ça? c'est très dur à regarder après votre dernière vidéo.
Is that Mark Woods violin? And holy freaking moly you are a champ for enduring such an excruciating act!!! I hope you can rest your pretty head and check that off the list!
I wish I could give this two thumbs up.  Lindsey, you are so incredible.  Give 110% in whatever you do.
This is a beautiful piece of art. Bravo.
It's amazing
Just the fact I know what it took for this performance is just mind blowing! Hands down one of my favorite of this year! Well done!!
Really great performance even if I can't handle feeling bad... I can understand some crazy things but this... you are really strong but I hope you know what you are doing... please remember keeping care of yourself, you deserve it. I hope what you did brought you more good that pain, as whatever you are planning to do in the future...  Best regards 💫
I’ve been lucky enough to see her perform live and she’s amazing.
America Got Talent 2021?
Eres fascinante (like si hablas Español :v)
She really cares about her shoes and her fans god love her
i am mesmerized
😊
Whatever your hard thing is, and it’s different for all of us, do it!
Espectacular 😱
🤩
😲😲😲😲😲
So happy I watched the training video first. You are an inspiration Lindsay🦋
Just in case anyone still has doubts, Lindsey Stirling can, in fact, fly through the air and play the violin at the same time. She's awesome like that, and truly an inspiration.
I mean... Whhh.... Whyyy ?
Im mesmerized and impressed
Pretty awesome😉
This is incredible
You left me speechless. You are amazing, never doubt that.
Next Stop:  A Virtual Roblox Concert
SHE BROUGHT IT BACK?!!!
Vay bee
Как всегда прекрасна!
She is also beautiful
Wow 😻😘
I am speechless. Such talent, so much pain and preparing and still you manage to pull it through. Youre an angel to this world, Lindsey!
I take back all of my questions from the blog about hair hanging, this was beautiful. I still think it looks incredibly painful but wow was the finished product gorgeous.
Линдси, вы прекрасны! Знаю, на сколько тяжко выполнять подобные элементы и просто восхищаюсь вами🌹
Wow wow wow ! It's really amazing and beautiful !  All this training for what result !  Really really beautiful !
Woow que increíble Lindsey!
This makes me even more emotional knowing how much you went through training to do this. You are so elegant and beautiful!
Фигня! Та первая версия в 100 раз лучше! Я лучше щас пойду на тот видос и пересмотрю его! Ностальгия.  А еще видос про Скайрим пересмотр. Ото были шедевры! А не  то что щас...
Wow Wow Wow 👏👏👏👏👏
Beautiful
The true artist sometimes sacrifice her comfort and health for give us an excellent show, Lindsey is one of them
Way to go Lindsey. You did a very great job. You do amazing videos for all the songs.
One step closer to Lindsey being in Cirque du Soleil?
also you dont get hurt with that??
I love u my cute baby 💕
Wow, the best for me...
This was the song made me discover Lindsy. I remember that old video so vividly aswell.
Esto es realmente hermoso
Didn't she just learn how to hang by the hair and was crying from the pain of it? And now she flyes around while playing her violin? The beauty that can come out of sheer willpower is truly incredible
😍😍😍
Insanely impressive!!
This is beautiful 😳
Wow.
trully epic
Simply crazy stunts! I just love love love her violin music! I’m glad I found her on YouTube, she is so talented!
Ай молодец. Умничка. Классно.
The best sound that my ears can get. I admire u so much!!😍 From Ecuador🇪🇨
😭😭😭😭😭😱 que hermoso y aterrador gracias lindsey por estos bellos minutos
Благодарим за ваш труд 👍 Из России с любовью и уважением 🇷🇺🤝
Only one word. BEAUTIFUL
HOW DOES THAT NOT HURT
Wooow you did it!!!! Congratulations!!!!!
Beaucoup de volonté de mérite très belle prestation !!! 👏👍👍😘
Lindsey, I know you are determined to try something new to bring to your fans as well as yourself and we thank you really really alot for that but please just don't put yourself at risk like this again. I am not telling you to stop but please take care of your health at least. But this was beautiful and thank you for bringing something this beautiful to us.
=o  it is playback sound???  not possible
린지 저는 당신을 정말 좋아하시만  그렇기에 위험한 공연은  나를 너무 불안하게해요.
It's so fancy ❄ I am so impressed that you managed to play during thing perfomance 😮
This is actually the first song I heard Lindsey perform 8 years ago and it is still just as amazing.
Thats Awesome 😳☺️👍🏻💪🏻
No no no love you but that just seems painful uncomfortable and unnecessary. We just want you and your violin 🎻😉. Music and you are beautiful  as ever though
Superb. As usual!
Loved it but didn’t like you being in so much pain. Congratulations though in accomplishing what you set out to do❤️
Lindsey, without a doubt this was the best part of the show and the one that confirmed that it is worth being part of this #STIRLINGITE family. You are amazing.!
Yass Queeeennn!!!!!! i have been slayed!
That's something I'll never be able to accomplish. I'm bald.
Well that looks painful.
Wow Wow Wow I lover her, amaizing
😍
Why!!!?? by your hair?! it looked amazing but that just looks painful and not necessary
Композиция бомбическая! Иди дальше! Не повторяй ошибки предшевстнников.
Словами не описать чувства. И музыка столь любимая мной. И хореография и её исполнение. А вместе с последним роликом... Это непередаваемо. Ты очень сильная! Это восхищает и удивляет! Желаю творческих успехов и счастья в целом!
My heart stopped watching this. How scary and incredible you could pull this off!!
My fav 🎵🎶
maybe this is what i need to try to finally get my neck to pop
Ouch!!! MY SCALP!!!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😍👏🏻👏🏻🤗👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Love Lindsey.  This is absolutely amazing.  I do have to question, however, whether this is the actual recording from this performance.  Spinning at those speeds while playing would almost have to create some sort of doppler effect that would be audible and I don't hear anything like that.  I suppose because it's an electric violin we are hearing the sound from the speakers and not directly from the instrument, which I suppose could explain it.  The amount of concentration it must take to overcome the centrifugal force and keep the bow from flying down the fingerboard must be intense.
You are so talented!!
I saw the video you posted the other day about your struggles with this. You are so inspirational and one of the strongest people I can think of. It's because of you that I started playing the violin and so much about you has encouraged me to be the best version of myself that I can be. Thank you for having the courage to live your life mission no matter what it takes, and never stop doing what you're doing. You are amazing!!
This was absolutely beautiful. I immediately cried at the end though because of how painful that peformance was for you.
I know that is so painful but Lindsey let it see it so elegant and easy. She is one of the respectable Woman on Earth. She's out of this World.
Why tho?
ouch!
Sei FAVOLOSA.... talento enorme
Breathtaking and oh so beautiful! You’re amazing! ❤️
This video makes me think what have i done with my life this year 😅
Have a merry Christmas
Ya'll keep enjoying your oppression. Bread being thrown in the coliseum.
I really hope you do a live stream of this on instagram. All of us want to show our absolute support that it's finally done and successful!
This gave me chills and major anxiety at the same time.
Dude, this hurts my scalp!!
Great 👏🏻
I think this is the first Lindsey video I don't give a thumb up. Don't get me wrong, it looks incredible and cool but I can see the pain and I've seen the making off and I want see her in pain again.  P.S.: on the plus side she may be an inch taller than before :-D
Girl,   you are insane. But its awesome!
👏👏👏👏👏
That...was incredible!
Why did I think this was Elements when I was watching the livestream yesterday....  I’m really forgetting some of her old songs I’m very sorry Lindsey AAAHHHH
thank you its very beautiful
You made my heart cry in Joy - again . . . thank you for the process. You are a great human and give voice to a history we do not see much any more.
Oh yeah. дождались!
O_O WoW This show is speechless, I am on big impress. Lindsey I love you soo much ;* From young start on Underground parking to big show in air. I still belive on You. Merry christmas.
I knew you were going to make it

Зачем так мучить себя?
Everyone: It's impossible to combine playing a violin with aerial acrobatics. Lindsey Stirling: Hold my violin!
Wow!!! I love you❤️❤️❤️😍😍🥰

Bravissima 👍🤩 sacré challenge !! Il fallait oser,  tu es une artiste talentueuse . Bravo 👏👏
A lil crazy. Please never do something like that again...
Lindsey Stirling вы просто бесподобны и полны сюрпризов! наверное стоит сказать отдельное спасибо тому кто управлял тросом и тому кто кто дает вам советы по уходу за волосами! это очень интересный номер!
Very beautiful! Crystallize will always be my favorite!
😲 c'est d'une puissance... Extraordinaire...j'ai pas d'autres mots, bravo 👏
😭😭😭
Wow Linsey  you are amaizing 😀
She deserves more credit and fame... There's a lot of "celebrities" whit no talent.
BREATHTAKING!! I have to be honest, It was just painful watching it, I cannot imagine how hard it was for you doing it. I don't know if it was worth all your pain. But even though, you were totally amazing. Out of this world, completely magical. Lindsey, you did an amazing job. Merry Christmas.
Amazing! Unwilling to give up when the going gets tough. ❤
No words can describe this video
Simply awesome. There are no limits for this woman
The best thing I saw in 2020

Una vez más, quedo muy sorprendida con el gran talento que posees ( ꈍᴗꈍ)
Incredible 🙌
How to define poetry in motion.
We've never seen anything like this. It's both incredible and beautiful. It's amazing how often we find ourselves saying that about Lindsey's art. Keep dreaming, people. There are new forms of art to discover, and Lindsey is the proof.
how????? lindsey, you are so amazing!
Magnifique !!!
I can't enjoy this, knowing how much pain you're in. Please don't do this again.
Чей воспленный разум придумал такой подвес?Так шею свернуть в момент можно!Запретите эту хрень,а изобретателя заприте в психушке до конца жизни!!!
awesome performance
Very good, Lindsey. ¡Congratulation!
Bravo it was really cool. There are no words to describe. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
That was so inspirational 👏 🙌! It  gives me great courage.  Thank you!!! You did it!!!!
Imagine how many people have not witnessed this greatness? Hint she has many.
How amazing it must feel to achieve something that hard
<3 <3 <3
You did it and it was so beautiful! Thank you for your gift of music and happy holidays! ❤️
This looks more mental than anything David Blaine has done so far.
Well done Lindsey,I know how hard this has been for you,you nailed it x
OML! All I have to say is WOW! You are so awesome Lindsey! My jaw was dropped the whole video!  You inspire me so much! Keep being you Lindsey!  🥰
Hammer cooles Video👍
Insaaaaaaaane !! That's such a great performance 😳   Playing violin, dancing, performing this whole song requires a lot, I'm so impressed, contrats for achieving this project 🤗
Super!!! Professionally!!! Russian women pulled out tanks by cutting off their hair, do you happen to have Russian roots?
ПРОСТО ОБАЛДЕТЬ НЕТ СЛОВ ОЧЕНЬ СИЛЬНО КРУТО ЭМОЦИИ КОТОРЫХ НЕ БЫЛО ОЧЕНЬ КЛАСНО СУПЕР
La mejor cancion de 2012  en 2020
G O O S E B U M P S
Simply the best!
LINDSEY! You conquered everything- the song and the stage and the air and your fear and your pain and the result was so so beautiful and you should have nothing but pride after that performance- i know I'm so glad to have seen it, you are amazing.
Садо - мазо
do not repeat at home
That looks hard and fun to do in equal parts 😱😱😱
Yay!! So glad you put this on YouTube! Glad it will live on forever, the whole Christmas show should! I would pay for that :-)
People can't even imagine how much pain, energy and hard work, beside of talent, you invested in this masterpiece. And everything what I can say is  THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. Have a nice holidays.
That was so beautiful! You're such a strong willed woman and we're all blessed to see your talent.
Przepiękny występ dziękuję
Snowflake ❄️ so elegant and graceful as expected.
Lindsey, I am crying. You do impossible things. You inspire me madly, you lead me with your bravery, perseverance. You are my light in my dark times. You teach me not to give up when it feels like it's over. I am immensely glad that you were able to do it again, you did it! You make this world brighter and better! Thank you for all u do! You're unreal, ur magical, Lindsey!
Amazing!!!!!!
Очень очень круто! Very very cool!
HOLY S*() WOW.....I hope to see you in concert one day.
Молодец это реально тяжело сделать
So talented but crazy.  You can tell that she was in pain.
Это просто Крутяк!
I like that Violin
Phenomenal. I have watched your VLOG and you knocked it out of the park. Just doing the areal is something but playing the violin when spinning at that speed is dizzying by itself and my feet are firmly planted on the ground. BE VERY VERY PROUD OF YOURSELF. It's amazing.
Wonderful!!!😍
That's your hair! Wear a cap next time with neck bracer!
the materialization of talent, discipline, creativity and beauty in one person.
No mms.....😮 si así normal me gusta la canción y ahora con todo esto me has dejado con la boca abierta 👏🏻 saludos desde.México
From Argentina, so wonderfull. Muy emocionada👏👏👏👏
This is sooo perfecttt Congratulatiooons You Kill It!!!!
😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So unbelievably proud of you, Lindsey!!
Me turbo encanta♡♡♡
Amazing video and song, Lindsey 💗
Absolutely Amazing!! This performance gave me goosebumps!
You did it Lindsey, so proud of you!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
That looks painful, Lindsey is awesome!
Just... why?
Es hermosa 🌼. Vi cuanto sufrió para poder hacer eso,  Ella es tan Nose como decirlo, extraordinaria.😍
Mein Kompliment
I'm lucky to hit play on my Amazon Music account, she's playing while suspended by her hair... The talent disparity is amazing, lol
It hurts me so much because how much pain you went through but I’m so happy for you because you made it through (please never ever do this again)
You are inspired me in every ur word, like the video before. I know and everyone know thats so hurt, but u finished it, and congratulation, i appreciate your hard work, very hard 😍💕. God Bless You, and Merry Christmas Lindsey ❄️. Love you from Indonesia 🇲🇨
😲 Woa! That was kewl!! 🤘
Spectacular as always !!!😍😍😍
LINDSEY YOU DID IT!!! YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD
Uau! Que linda, PARABÉNS 😍
Thank you for all of your hard work to make such a enchanting video!
Is beautiful¡¡¡
Simply outside of this world 😍💙 i just want to congratulate Lindsey for her perseverance to accomplish this beautiful performance. Some people might not understand why she did this and why she putted herself through much pain, but I just can think of how amazing she must have felt with every little success and with the final result. This is beyond the views, beyond the money and everything that a show comes with, this was a personal challenge to do something that will make her a better artist for herself, and I couldn’t be more inspired by that. Truly out of this world.  I don’t think she will ever do this again, but if she does, i hope she can be patience, take care of herself and remember that she already did it once ;) she truly can do anything she wants 🔥 Take care Linds, you are incredible 💞  🇨🇱
Doesn't even look she was playing during it the stick movement didn't seem to line up with the sound, is that just an audio defect in the recording or was this basically "lip synced"?
Lindsey is the most amazing performer. A true artist, a muse, bravo 👏👏👏👏👏🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
What magic did I just watch.... wow that was awesome.   Thank you, Lindsey!
Every time she swept up into the air I about burst into tears for her.
You finally did it, Lindsey!!! As Sia says: Never give up, I'm unstoppable today, I'm the greatest.
wow ❤
Oh my goodness!!! 💜 YOU DID IT!! 💜 That was absolutely breathtaking!! And to my song, too!! I'm so overwhelmed with emotions for so many reasons but I love, Love, LOVE this!! (And miss my snowman too!! 💜💋💙)
This gave me goosebumps all over the body, it is so beautiful!
When I saw this in the concert my jaw just dropped. Only Lindsey would even try this, and no one else will. Lindsey is truly one of a kind.
Oh my goodness!!! 💜 YOU DID IT!! 💜 That was absolutely breathtaking!! And to my song, too!! I'm so overwhelmed with emotions for so many reasons but I love, Love, LOVE this!! (And miss my snowman too!! 💜💋💙)
Lindsey it was amazing,💖 but I hope you won't do again, it's not good for your health, and this could lead to traction alopecia and other problems. We love You❤️
You represent all that is good. About the Holliday. 🌹
THIS WON 2020
How is this even physically possible
LITTLE GODDESS YOU DID IT!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤😭😭😭 I am so proud of you!!!! Now go rest your lovely head and neck. That had to have hurt and put alot of strain on you. 😘
Wooow
When I thought Lindsey couldnt be more awesome than she already was... This notification showed up.
Lindsay thank you for the pain thank you for the sweat thank you for the tears thank you for the torn hair.  Thank you for your passions.  Thank you for a beautiful and amazing spectacle. We love you.
Epic.
The self discipline and focus is incredible to watch, I was moved to tears watching, so beautiful and so magical!
Beautiful...🤩
Lindsey Stirling you are amazing woman 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻❤❤❤😀👍🏼🎄🎊🎁🎉⛄❄
that was amazing, let's never do that again.......coz we all can feel how painful it was.
Well holy hair follicles of steel.
Hurray, Lindsey posted the video herself.  Little soaring Angel with a big loving heart.  Your music is written with soul and changes people for the better.
Wow, amazing and beatiful😍
Сильно! Это нечто!
I know you won't recognize me, but I'm honored to see you haven't changed. Never loose your imagination.
Lindsey...how did you do that?! I love you
As in the previous video, my neck and hair on my head began to hurt again. All hair. Lindsay, this is a very beautiful performance, but take care of yourself, we all love you very much!
I want to know how someone can be so unimaginably talented. Lindsey, how do you all of this!?
That was INSANE. Stunning. 🙌🏼 #Respect #HatsOff
That cannot be good for the neck gurl ☹️
Amazing show and amazing 'remake' of Crystallize. But it shows how stressful it was for you to put so much trust into you hair, body and yourself that you can do it. So if this is too much for you don't do it again. We will love you either way, cause you are an amazing artist. And we don't want to see you in pain. Thank you Lindsey! Marry Christmas! And Happy New Year!
WOW, you are something else, you are an angel fallen from heaven, breathtaking YOU are AWESOME!  Divin!
Крутая круть СУПЕР...
Breath taking performance  Beautiful job to a classic song.  I’m glad you toughed it out. Love you Lindsey KSLL
Months and Months of trying to learn to play crystallize, and yet I still don't know how she does the fast parts.
well done lindsey! bravo. It turned out very cool and emotional. I watched with bated breath. I saw how hard it was to do these acrobatic stunts. But you were able to do it. I will say it again, you are a miracle!
Amazing job! You're incredible and strong! And very brave. I believe you can do anything!!
Amazing, but please don't hurt yourself for the sake of the show. I believe I speak for everyone when I say we'd rather have you safe than a show.
Shes amazing!! She is literally hanging from her hair, TWIRLING and spinning! WHILE PLAYING THE VIOLIN! Like WHATTT! Me, looks at my violin which I haven't touched in years😅😅 chile...let me just rewatch this masterpiece
Why could I see SpongeBob hanging JAJAJA, Amazing performance!
Вот это да!! Нечто сверхьестественное👍👍👍 Всем привет!🤚🇷🇺
Awesome  Beautiful  Inspiring
It seems quite difficult to do these movements under these conditions and playing the violin.Great performance,congratulations.
you really inspired me <3 <3 Thanks Lindsey  Merry Christmas <3 Jesus is beautiful and you done beautiful things
I’m so proud of you!!! You did it!!! It’s looks hard and painful I would be terrified to do something like that. You did amazing I loved the videos 😍🤩
She defies reality. AND gravity.
Knowing what a trial that was and how much pain you endured to do it, to actually see the result is both breathtaking and breath-hitching just watching.  While I'm amazed by the effort, dedication, and production of your videos (to say nothing of the wonderful music and dance), I can only hope that, in the end, you are truly happy with the result.  After all, the audience of many is always drowned out by the audience of one... you.  Happy Holidays and absolute best wishes to you and yours. :)
That was so freaking beautiful! Go Lindsey!
incredibile beautiful music tenks
Что творит. Привет из России. Наверное больно. Не надо так делать.
Absolutely breath taking and astonishing :) <3
I felt something so special i can't even explain what I'm feeling
I'm literally crying because I know how much pain you had to feel, and still it is the most beautiful thing you could do. Lindsey, you are incredible hero. THE ARTIST :)
Fantástic
Way to go Lindsey all the hard work paid off  ❤🖤💜💚💙💛🧡💛💙💚💜🖤💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
I serioisly thought there was some movie magic behind this. Knowing what she went through to prepare for this made me cry. The original song speaks to the struggle inside me. Many times feeling like im hanging on a thread. Shes hanging by her hair. And being flawless while enduring that pain. This visual made me cry...we can feel as if we are hanging by a thread... That thread wont fail. We can press forward , we are strong. Another beautiful work Linsey. Thank you.
👏👏👏👍😊
Bravo !!!!!!  You did it !!!!
WONDERFUL!!
Lost a lot of the magic without the ice … Definitly preffer the original video …
She continues to push the envelope after 15 years... We love you!
Beautifull ❤
RESPECT!!!
Wow!. A bit of a step up from rubbing our bellies and tapping our heads as children. Kudos to you for all your hard work, effort, practice and training.
Watching this is paifull, but music is a painkiller.
Cool im your big fan
Виртуозно!!! браво ооо
Amazing work Lindsey!!! Greetings from Argentina!
You never cease to amaze me. And the way you work so hard to learn new things is inspiring. Also I love that you brought back Crystalize, the song that made me fall in love with your music
My jaw was on the floor the whole time! This looks absolutely terrifying yet surprisingly very artistic at the same time. Well done, Lindsey!
Wow
Awesome 💃
Beautiful and excellent 💙
jupp.... not worth all the pain done n dusted
how can you play violin while you're been spinning? 🤔😯
This has got to be the 14th or 15th time I see this version after rewatching the special. Every single time, I tear up. You are such an inspiration Lindsey and I sincerely hope you eventually offer the holiday special on DVD so I can save it to show my future children about what hard work, faith, and a dedication to make other people smile can do for you in all aspects of life.
like Cirque du Soleil, beautiful
Absolutely amazing, the dedication and perseverance is extremely inspiring💝💝💘🎉💓💕🎉❤💫👑
Valio la pena!!!
Incredible!!
Truly amazing. You worked so hard to do this. We are all so proud of you!!!!
...pretty... ... ... but why?
It's amazing, specifically when we know  how she suffered to do this. I'm stunned. Congratulations, she's crazy.
Great fantastic beautiful as useral!!! You did it! 👍👏👏👏👏👏👏
Bravo!!! Excellent performance!
Дякую за красу.
I love how Lindsey never gives up on things she tries to accomplish! She is one of the most talented people that I know! She gives me so much courage I can never ever thank her enough! ❤️
Magnifique !
?????
This is the purest example of what not giving up looks like.
I don't like seeing you in pain.  It's not worth it.  Rev. Lovejoy from Nebraska.
IM SO PROUD OF YOU
не любишь ты себя)
Interesting and fear
Amazing!!!! Many of us would have to learn from your courage, your effort and your dedication to the things you love, without ever giving up!!!
YOU ARE AMAZING
Wow, I do aerial silks but this looks way more painful. Your so strong in every way ❤️
Beautiful xx
Calidad artística de otro nivel!!! 💯💯
Elegance, power.... Emotionally charged... Perfect compliment to Crystallize. Thank you 💖
Lindsey, you are truly amazing and an inspiration, you go girl!!!!
Lindsey is the epitome of super-ager; challenging herself across mental, physical and emotional barriers We love you Lindsey! ❤👍
Awesome Accomplishment Lindsay
Umm that looks a little bit painful BUT IT SOUNDS AMAZING
Wow!  Well done Lindsey, we are so proud of you! I can't imagine that's good for your hair/scalp though, and I know it hurt a lot. Please don't do that again, but well done and good for you for pushing through and going through with it!
Mi Diosa🤧💖
woah-
The performance is amazing. You did it.  You can be proud. But i prefere see you smile when you play. Not suffer. Stay as you are and continue.
Just a huge whaooo from France 👏 Such a beautiful, epic, peotic, masterful performance.  Congrats ! You can be proud of all your hair hanging work 💪 and all the rest
The sheer determination on that beautiful face!😌This woman is pure magic, beauty, grace, and kindness.❤️ This women never ceases to amaze me❤️ Totally love ya @lindseystirling!🥰🎄🦋
So proud of her!!! Specially after knowing what it took to get to this performance. I actually cried watching that behind video and almost cried again watching the performance. So brilliant, talented and beautiful!!!
you're a really great woman 👏👏
Woooow
Whoever reading this, God knows what you are facing through, He heard your cry, He is going to deliver you. Just trust in him
Thank you. Every time I see your videos I am inspired and encourages me to keep going. Anything is possible when you are just being who you are in your heart and soul. Thank you for a wonderful and unforgettable performance. Lindsey you are one of my most favorite artist.  Thank you and I am proud that you over came your fear.
✨🎻✨❤️ yey!!! You got it Lyndsey ❤️❤️
she did that with her hair being pulled????????? wow. my gf would be afraid of going bald
This made me cry, it’s so beautiful! The sheer determination, persistence and grace this woman has is amazing, thank you Lindsey for inspiring so many of us with what you have! 💙🤍💙🤍
Сейчас куча таких же недоразвитых начнут повторять и тягать друг друга за волосы
Потрясающая! Великолепная!
Wooow Amazing and classy performance
cheesus, i cant watch this, please just dont do that!
Woww, Let's pray together! Dear God, please make my days useful, my nights restful, my home peaceful and my efforts fruitful. Amen.💕
❤️❤️❤️
Amazing! That was some absolutely stunning concentration. Well done!
Я думаю - это перебор ; так можно и головы лишиться .
Thank you Lindsey Stirling for the such a magical music and amazing show 👍👏🌹🌹🌹💕.
Mükemmel 👌
🔥🔥🔥 marvelous
Another one for the books! She done something someone has probably never done with a violin before
Great performance
You excel at every new job, I love being your fan
JUST WOW! JUST WOW!
Talented but kinda hard to watch ^^;
Still trying to wrap my brain around how she stays on-tempo and in tune when she was massively spinning. That violin is designed to stay in place without holding it, but I don't think the designer had THAT performance in mind when he created it.
You are amazing
Actual CBT is less painful than watching this.
Incredible, but the pain you went through😣
Lindsey you took my breath away with this version of this amazing song. You have really out did yourself on this. I will be there on July 13th to see you. It will be my birthday present to myself. 💙🎻
That was amazing! But please don't hurt yourself! Or overwork yourself!
This is awesome above all. Perfect performance. Non typical talent. Ahhh. Eden and Utopia.
I have never seen anyone that is as good as you are like a god at that
Это очень красиво просто прекрасно 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩😭😍😍😍😭😭😭❤️💞💞💞💞💞
She's always trying something new but manages to stay focused on the strings...nice job LS
Bravo Lindsey ! C'est incroyable. Je suis émue 😢 Avoir vu le making off juste avant rend cela encore plus beau et émouvant. Bravo Lindsey pour tes efforts, ton courage et ta persévérance. You did it !!
that look like it relly hurts
WoW ame está versión esta épica me en canto es fascinante mágico ✨💫 🇨🇴 WoW love this version this epic singing me is fascinating magical ✨💫  ❣️
I love you Lindsey 💜❤️
Sempre spettacolare e bravissima!
Wow, wow, wow, I am sooo proud of you🥺🥺🤩🤩. You did this really good 👌🥺❤️
That explains why you thought it worth to go through the struggle.
I am always surprise with her songs, but when she performs them... I'm just so astonished. This song is so special for me because it is the first song I listen from her, after that I support her every day ❤️
AMAZING, AS ALWAYS
😍😍aaaaa você é perfeita,eu te amo muito!❤
I'd actually love to hear the live audio from that, cause there's ZERO way she was playing that perfectly through that entire thing. Beautiful, and amazing just the hair stunt on its own, the fact that she could even still get ANYTHING out of the violin doing that would be amazing.
Wow! Great!
How did she now throw up pass 3:00 is anyones guess.
this must have taken so long and it must have so painful but it was so worth it. This is, hands down, the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen
Quede completamente loca   (o.o)  ¡¡No existen palabras que abarquen lo magnífico que fue!!🤩🥺💕💕
You are FANTASTIC!! I love youuu♥️♥️
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😺
Dear Lindsey, I watched the video of you practicing for this EPIC performance.  Not only did you gain the physical strength, but your emotional strength is amazing!  Out of all the videos you have created, this bay FAR is the best one.  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  Keep going strong!
That was beautiful. Your music is amazing as well. Thank you for sharing your musical gift with everyone.
Absolutely beautiful. Crystallize has always been my hands down #1 favorite Lindsey Stirling song and this version of it is beautiful. And to do it while hanging from your hair? Astounding!
11 minutes 340 comments wow  #kezostudios here
Fabulous ❤️❤️❤️
Congratulation for you to have been able to do this clip ! I don't know well the deep reason behind, but I prefer to see joy on your face because that's what you express the most since you began. I know that's just a personal preference like tones of others... But my idea would be for you to ask Tom Cruise when he will make his movie in space to take you with him so you could make a clip in 0 gravity without struggling with so much pain (I know it can't be done like that but maybe with some new techs, soon...)! Anyway once again : Congratulation !
Who the heck is giving this video a thumbs down 🙄🙄🙄 she’s 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bravo
Q hermosooo, beautiful...
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😺
Wow – good, as always, and literally taking it to the next level :-) ;-)
I am SO proud of you!!! Even when faced with total defeat, you find your inner strength, call on our father, humble yourself, and soar like an amazing eagle! I know this was one of the hardest personal obstacles you've ever been faced with. But hold your head high Lindsey! YOU. DID. IT!
i get teary eyed every time i hear this song. every time.
veeeeuuuuuuuu  Lindsey  u r really  courage and so talented  woman.....inspired  all of us
This is freaking amazing
Ви-Герой, що витримали ці важкі фізично елементи. Вражає. Схиляю голову перед Вашою відданністю тврчому процессу.👍👏❤

Perfection, just wow ... just wow Well done Lindsey
Your Violin action dance make me Expected ^.^  V

Just excellent content, keep spinning it out.  Seasons greetings all.
Woooooooh love it😍🤩❤
I'm convinced Lindsey Sterling is not of this world. She is something grand from beyond.
Très belle cotre graphie et très jolie musique un grand mérite a toi et merci encore pour t’es belle musique
Respekt vor dieser Leistung! Anmut, Musik, Bewegung in einem, sehr schön!
No words🔥
Thank you very much for going through that hard training for this, Lindsey Sterling! You look so much like a snow angel flying effortlessly - no guessing how hard that really was! 🌲🌟❄️
She did it!!  And this was emotional to watch during the special but  still worth it! Best performance of Crystallize!
Oh wow 👏👏👏👏😘❤️
Doeu na minha alma ;-;
Great decisions that are made in life, I can do it and I can achieve it, great work and beauty in motion, the art of flying without wings, if not with the heart, that is Lindsey, for all of us who follow her.  :)
wow der Wahnsinn echt klasse vorstellung
After seeing the pain you went through and kept at it. Well done! You are a very brave woman, Lindsey.
I'm crying. 😭 Your pain and your insecurities just couldn't beat your amazing spirit. You didn't give up, you encouraged yourself through the journey, and achieved an AMAZING result. ❤️  I'm still crying, just so SO proud of you. 😭
Well it came out beautiful 😍 Now that it's done do you think you will ever hang from your hair/head again?
Saw your lead up to this that's amazing you pulled that off given how much pain you were in love your music been a fan since your start on utube.
Yay Lindsey you did so good!!!  I'm glad you were able to overcome your fears and do things most people would no have the strength to do. I'm so proud of you for pushing through!
No one:   Lindsey-  I believe I can flyyy
Lindsey that was Spectacular after watching your videos on training for this I know how hard, difficult it was and scary too.  God has certainly given you a talent, grace and creativity to amaze us all.  Your videos never cease to amaze me.  Continue to let your light shine.  💐❤️😇
All the hard work payed off ❤️ This is amazing good job!
Linsey, you are my hero!!! It's unbelievable!
That hurts me just looking at that!
it is magical, you are always wonderful and magical, much love🖤❤️👏👏👏👏👏👏
Way to go Lindsey proud that you accomplished this it was awesome!
You are such an amazing woman and violinist. I listen to your music for so many years now. Greets from Germany
Lindsey  performances  and  shows are  sublime  having  caught  two shows artemis  tour  nantes  in France   and  London  I.will never  ever  forget  them magical  mesmerising   memories  made 😎
Exquisite, creative, beautiful, mesmerizing talent! Great work Lindsey! 💛💛💛
Ella es hermosa❤ y toca el violín súper hermoso 😍
Lindsey, that was amazing. I saw your blog and how hard you worked to overcome your fear and anxiety with the hair hanging. Thank you for all you do to make such beautiful artwork to share with your audience and fans. Wonderfully done 😊
MS. Sterling is simply amazing! 🤓😍🤓😍🤓 Until she posted the video about her training in hair-hanging I always thought it was some sort of body harness that was designed to look really fancy like "oooh look what we can do" now I'm wondering how this hair-hanging got to be a thing?
Woww ❤️❤️😍🤩
What is the point of this? nice parlor trick but couldn’t you have at least put out a new song with it?
👏👏👏👏👏👏 Sería muy feliz que contestaras mi msj excelente video como siempre te esmeras en innovar en cada una de las cosas que ases x eso estas en donde estas  sigue así saludos desde México 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽👏👏👏👏👏
Glad you  pulled through! Amazing video and thank you for showing us what work went into it. Lets us appreciate just the more! THANK YOU!
Bu kadın beni her seferinde şaşırtıyor, yok tamam artık bu zirve derken bir bakıyorum daha yukarıya çıkmış. Tek kelime ile harika sadece harika 🎻
Why did this video ended 😭😭...I wish it was an infinitely long video..,.☺️☺️☺️☺️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  ONLY one word for this video : *OUTSTANDING*

I saw the outtake video and I am speechless! She is so strong and so talented. Amazing, I just had some tears in my eyes <3
This was such an amazing performance. I'll never forget it
Wow... doing even one would have been too much for me.. violin and dancing at the same time! This is just absolutely amazing, astounding
Amaizing how every day you can surprise us more 💪
Absolutely amazing!
No way I could do that hair hanging thing. Mostly because I'm bald.
Amazing 😍

Great job!
Remember that judge that one time said she should not dance and play the violin at the same time?  yeah, I can't remember him either :-)
How can you play violin and basically fly at the same time? It's super epic!!!
YOU DID IT YAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!!
The Ultimate Lingling workout
Good work, Lindsey.
Lindsey you are amazing. I'm really proud of you for doing this although you struggled so much. And you look so graceful here. I don't know if I could have done that but you are a strong woman. Thank you for never giving up. <3

Does that not hurt?
Wouldn’t her hair hurt a lot?
Loop won't allow me to meet and greet with you. I've entered your name and they can't find you. So sorry. I'm on my computer at this moment.
Wow... just wow. Amazing job, good for you for being able to do this in a super (for lack of a better word) strenuous way! God bless you.
I laughed and cried at the same time watching this
Beautiful piece! Beautiful performance!
After all the pain, Linds still gives us professionalism and art. Chile loves you, Lindsey 🇨🇱

Such tenacity to train and work hard for her craft.
Jesus Christ, she freaking killed it.
Mission accomplished, now please don't ever do that again. We don't like seeing you in so much pain.
This is fire

I respect this chick because she respects her craft. Alot of youtubers or should I say influencers need to put time production and quality in their craft and stop using a microwave timer to record your videos
