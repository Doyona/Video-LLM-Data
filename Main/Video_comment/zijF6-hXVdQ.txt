40:54 this is where  where they actually lost,the blade was running and fine,it got hit to wall ,thats where it got stopped.
a robot that beats the meat.. hmmm 🤔🤔🤔🤔
What a duel! Big up
Fire
Bring this back
They should do this again (only if it gets to 10 million views) get it there
remember nothing is possible without Jesus✝️ He loves everyone so much that he died for your sins and the great news is one day he will come back so repent and have true faith and he will grant you eternal life you don't have to be perfect.❤
Tobi on his monthly period again 😆
Put that against zachiel and one tapped
Currently watching the planning part and I’m calling a JJ’s team win. Smasher robots suck in battlebots
Best 45 minute video the sidemen have ever done imo . Plus I miss robot wars ❤
35:48 you can see Josh looking at the blade and says "I can disable that" and he did so! Was awesome.
love the Apollo clip, nostalgia at its finest 2:15
Tobi was a bit of a p*ssy  in this one
please make another sidemen robot wars in 2025
there needs to be a rematch! for sure! maybe have groups of 2 and get a few youtubers involved.. not danny aarons though :)
มารับชมด้วยครับ
💀
Simon pussyo
A robot that can give a massive electrocuting shock that can fry the computer of other robots would be a good idea
Oyyee Vik and Josh are too sick
They should do this again with four teams of two and have like a mini tournament and have two matches, And then winners get fixed up and go head to head in a third match or something like that.
How is Vik sooooo good at drawing😮
them teeth are YELLOWWW
Should have done more rounds. Fixed it up and did more rounds!
why did the blade and hammer break in two seconds
Hedging my bets on the tendy
Robot wars is the UK's rip off version of American Battle Bots
8:33 harry is so comsiderate he wants to talk but let viks talk instead what a nice guy he is❤
i sore apollo live
Make more videos like this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2024
give us part 2 with even more big robotsss🤠
30:10 turn the fn lights on ya dips Wtf u cant see anything
This video is so underrated
Vics team: Drawing and discussing intricate robot ideas  JJs team: *Circle with wavy lines*
Is the robot guy from robot wars used to watch it all the time
How much did Pepsi pay u to be in ur sides ad 😂😂
Sdmn more robot wars with same teams
Wth why haven’t the sdmn done Yh is again
This deserves more views
That big robot is siiiccckkkk
pt 2
we need robot wars 2
Its a great video❤❤
need a part 2 pls
If there's 1 thing I know, It's Robot Wars
6:45 Ethan's dad joke
Ethan went caveman mode out of no where sometimes
We need a number 2
Why did jj actually try
…
KSI must be 70-80 IQ tops.
josh zerka coldest moments ever
mad to think sides has been out for this long
I dont know but just taking a design and copying it is weird for this format
How did this vid did so little views … to sidemen standards. This is a banger
As someone from a team that makes these in India i was laughing the entire video and it's sad that it didn't do well views otherwise this would legit be the best 2nd fight ever .... Love from team orcus
30:30 proves that men are so simple in ways to get happy
I feel like the golden daddy wouldve won if its weapon was more durable, it got put out of commission so quick for something surrounded by armor, unlike the tenderizers exposed hammer.
Can we have a tournament of this like 2 sidemen each with 1 guest maybe being Chris again to do a 4 robot tournament with a final and 3rd place
9:51 Darth Maul actually didn't die from being chopped in half, can't remember exactly what happened to him but apparently he did survive.
They should have followed through with sperm and called it the golden shower
1:02 the voice crack
Bro tombstone is the goat and battle bots is awsome
I was there and I agree KSI was disappointed
They build their weapons out of the worst materials😭
Im sorry but whoever welded the tenderizer needs to be fired immediatly!
The welds are shocking haha
Tommy t is amazing.
This is actually such a good vid
This Sidemen Sunday was an underrated banger
Just watch the last 6 minutes it's a waste otherwise
Best sidemen sunday of all time.
sies oped on my birtday
Bro they seriously need to do this again solid video
WE NEED A PART 2 OF THIS!!!!
LOL I heart this vid❤
Obviously KSI was first to the chicken
They should do this again
it's so dumb how they do most of the video planning and then a 5 minute battle and done
its about time for the 2nd episode of this series innit? ^^
that's so much fun, i hope it has part 2!
Pizza
shame both primary weapons died instantly
May the tenderizer go down in history, as the first and last, and only bot to fight and beat the golden daddy. 👏
Do a part two
This was amazing:)
Underrated video
14:49 😂😂😂😂
I forgot that I’ve never watch this
This is the definition of “For the male audience only.“
Darth maul came back half robot
The time they show each other their robots i could see zerka, vik, ethan, Harry's arm of the robot will get ripped off
simon  and  jj
Almost skipped 90% of the video to watch the real battle
yapiea
That Pepsi commercial was lit 🔥
Josh killed it 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨
awww harry is so cute 😂❤
Simon is the dumbest sidemen by far
They Decided To Bring Back Mr Psycho Absolutely Incredible To See him back
Poor dude probably hasn't even met Ethan, just sat there watching them all collapse in laughter.
Sidemen v Beta squad robo wars needed.
ChrisMD slammed the blade into the wall and that was it
we need another one this was sickk so awesome
Ethan really annoys me
JJ knowing about darth maul but not about the millenium falcon question?
I am surprised Simon, allegedly one of the smartest sidemen, didn't know what Inertia is
6:30
Jj’s team : METAL  Vik’s team : plastic toys 🧸
This was just awesome. Them guys really do have a good taste when it comes to liking childhood classics. That was just such a joy to watch. ❤️
JJ's robot design was eggcellent
this was so much fun, every lil boys dream rlly
Chris MD was sh*t as always
JJ: why is everyone better than me   Also JJ driving robot one handed
where the sperm tho
This video was banging!
will there be sides in the us?😢 i wanna try
Egg machine
Josh was good at handling it
3:27 Tf is Harry doing ((I'm German) This is sarcasm))
We need some dramatic anime fight music
Season 2?
Damn this might be one of my favorite Sidemen Sunday ICL. 10/10
Back up
Darth maul didn’t die
That discount sir killsalot though.
Such an underrated video!
Andy (the robot guy) matched the energy and was honestly very good in this video. Was a funny guy worth my watch.
Please make a whole series of this, i love battle bots and a series of this would be so nice
The best part for me is when JJ said sike 8:20
Need more vids like this was awesome
Simon is so delusional  He told JJ he is awful, yet not once did he take the remote for he can control it himself …
I would of built the Quinn Pensky robot… tiny little cute robot with a laser that will blow up anything in its path. Shoutout Zoey 101! 😂
Please do this again
bro got mr physco but from the hood☠
A Robot Wars Youtuber tournament would be sick
we need another one of these
14:36 yeah blood on it 😂
they dont know that darth maul survived :(
Please bring sides to America!
Mad how this was filmed in my hometown and I didn’t realise until my mate got a photo with them at McDonald’s right next to it, I was at work about A 5 MIN WALK AWAY 😔😔
6:45
Such an underrated video!
They need to make a part 2
the sides ad shoot was in ksi movie
Ethan will be so pissed off lol 😂😂😂😂
9:56 darth maul did not die he got chopped in half then got metal legs
Josh killed it omg
40:23 simon man😂
Its starting to fold in on him
The “meat beater” was such a missed opportunity for a name
This video was so much fun! Deserves more views!
One of if not the most underrated vid the boys have put out
🐐
The funny thing is that these bots could be entered into Battlebots and they would fit right in.
JJ laughing brings my earbud battery from 12 hours to 3
Again We want this type of video again please 🙏
This video had alot of potential sadly The parts aint good enough
Joch is just legentary
Man would love to see this more man that was fire god damn man .
Round 2 Lets go
1:02
Your ads are sooo good😂
Honestly such an underrated video it deserves so much more views
It would be nice to create an arena dor battle blades in kibao like jj’s team its like a kibaoh battle blade inspired bot
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why did this video do so poorly?
Josh is very adorable here...
They gave vikks team plastic little toys and jjs team a washing machine and a microwave
4:00 watched it over and over again 🤣🤣🤣
Its the 123
10:00 Simon has a point here. Darth maul didn't die
Can we get another one please
I love how unemotional the expert is
I thought Josh had it until I seen the egg
I want them to do this again but a massive tournament each person gets their own one winner gets a trophy and some other prize
They had the better robot and still lost lol
One of the most underrated video
40:00 start of the fight
I need a SIDES but I am nowhere near one
I feel bad for the creators, both of their robots broke at the beginning of the match.
We need round 2 of this
There's subtitles
that was beat lol 5 seconds of weapons working ? lol
3:29 harry throwing up the dodgy sign
:]
The two robots are ram & slam vs spin to win and I love it
Am I the only one that got extremely excited thinking they brought Leandro Trossard just to realize it was Chris md
Ofc KSI goes for the chicken wings at the beginning.
the only thing i have to say about the robot is that the weld look terribleand aren't cleaned
√
How did this vid “ flopped “ loved this vid
we need another one of this but with like 4 teams instead
this video is pretty underrated
Chris md ruined that video for me such a shame was looking class aswell
Anyone here after the last reacts, rewatching after they said they wished it did better
Underrated video 🤩
Josh Harry Ethan and viks teams robot look like they could win they have armour to defend from the sharp spinner and have a hammer that can destroy the other teams robot . They have advantage on the other team
Couldn't they have built typhoon 2 with a self writing arm ?
Wait Chris is Simons son
2nd part please
Ong them eating with they mouth open stopped me from ordering sides ever
chris is anoyying
Ik it was just to advertise but that looks like the plainest chicken tender I have ever seen lmao
That was the greatest thing ever, I loved every second of it, the planning and designing phase was really cool, both robots looked absolutely sick and did some proper damage to each other, Josh countering the eggblade with the hammer was so smart and satisfying to see and the underdog Tenderizer won which is always great to see although the Golden Daddy did have the worst drivers so there was a somewhat even playing field but man that was so fun I'd love to see the boys do another one
More of thissssss
The Tenderizer  I’ll give props to the team, they built a durable machine
Vikstar or Ksi drawing  Ksi.           VIK 👇.               👇
I can’t believe I watched this video for that battle
To answer the question to did dearth maul die, the answer is no
I didn’t think they would win I would of bet on the other robot
This was a good video but why the really low views
The way they walked in the room, it’s like the gathering of a gta heist
the way Simon let Chris win cz it was his dream 🥺🥺
Give the black guy ago
Such a banging vid
Robot wars 2? With Chris ???????
Why is Harry wearing a childish hoodie whilst doing a sidemen video 😂😂😂. Harry built different.
Why Tobi always saying “stop” “turn it off” and “chill” ffs it’s the point of the video
Legend
I dont appreciate this having under 10 million views
They look like real battlebots
All those robots are from Battlebots. we've got tombstone, whipflash (my fave), minotaur, rotator, lockjaw
15:01  JJ: Months and months of stored sperm Captions: Mums have stored sperm
I was clinching watching this like I was there and had so much at stake lmao
That was anticlimactic
Josh controlled it like a boss 🤟
most underrated sidemen video!!!!!
For some reason in my head i could smell the first robot guys breath with the yellow teeth
"The robot will be about 110kg" Me:"That's a whole JJ"
Would have got more views if they were allowed to fix the robot and battle again..fight was boring
That was sick
First driver dif lol
Vik gamer
We just don't enter a robot LMAO
I wish the spinner was way faster
Imagine if JJ's team built a fast robot named Stacy?
I love how one team is like super impressed by the robot and and the other team is just terrified
One of my favorite videos
Massively underrated video still
Chris md thinking mail died
13:49 he said zed
Last
Last
Last
Last
@chrismd Can confirm dearth maul did survive being chopped in half
Banging video
Ngl the video was really great and I was waiting in anticipation of the fight since the robot guys built these mechs exactly the way the boys wanted them to.  Then the fight started and the weapons gave out after like 1 or 2 shots at the enemy bot...ngl, that was anticlimactic and deeply unsatisfying... Hope that, if they should ever one of those videos again, the builders put a little more thought into the weapon designs. Yeah, they weren't given a lot to work with I agree. But the weapons giving out so fast and thusly leading to 2 hunks of metal driving at each other was kinda...yeah.  Great video idea, everything leading up to the fight was top-notch entertainment, just the main event lacked the hype the "pre-game" suggested.
Vik: scientifically analysing the robot using clever words  JJ: drawing an sunny side up
So funny how Harry's team is crushing little toys and then JJ's team is smashing huge home appliances 😭
It would be dope it this was an annual thing!
The fact that the robot guys build exactly what they wanted is legendary
This is probably one of the worst sideman video of all time
The big robot looks insane😂
They need to do another one of these
w
6:45
1:23 JJ walking in like it's a GTA cutscene
We want to see this again. With experience they will be able to create much better and crazier robots
0:16 i just came
MY NAME IS BABATUNDE
Ksi is like "something like this" then pulls out a picture of Tombstone the best most op Battle Bot .
Robotwars but everyone of u have ur own and meet eachother?
Goated sidemen video
Guys just letting uk, idk if it's just me or YouTube's acting wierd, before tday this video wasn't recommended or shown to me eventhough I've subscribed, I wonder if that's why the video has 6 million views when it could have more.
Make part 2
sick vid. more pls
Oi Simon lad instead of complaining about everyone else on your team drive it yourself maybe?? Such a strange personality
I'm just uncomfortable by looking at the man's teeth broooo they're helllll yellow 😑
man I want another one of this
Oi does anyone know the time of the vid where the fans broke in or did they not put it in
Ahh, big hero six
Shoulda named one of them the brobot
6:43
can't believe I didn't catch this video when it came out
We want a 2.0 of this video
The hammer sounds cool but the egg saw is next level
Harry,vik,Ethan, and josh drawing they’re robot and all the weapons   JJ: egg  Team golden daddy:👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
.
And ethans dad😂😂
Can't believe jj called tombstone Harry's mum😂😂😂
Tenderizer team: our hammer broke their blade  Me: About that...
I ain't gonna lie, the sidemen's closed captioner is dog water lmaooo
*Like this to join the Real Ones who stayed through  the whole video without skipping* 💪
JJs dickbott 🤖🤖🤖🍌
Dickbott 🤖🍌
Return of tenderizer???😭
12:35 Harry just listening
robucks pleasse
We need a part 2 of this
Y’all need to do this again
Coulda name it *Gold Digger*
What does MD stand for? Major Neak?
the robot guy looks like a grown up version of the bully from toy story
I love how JJ says his robot is gonna beat the others easy but then gets destroyed by the other one
This was an underrated video man would love a part 2
KSI and Simon's attitudes just stink so bad.
Low key disappointed asf the weapons pretty much died after the first hit
they making more noise then the bots
6:40 BRUH
Nobody noticing Ethan say we beat their meat
Pls do part 2 of this it is legendary
I like that Harry was put in with the smart side while Simon and jj talk about eggs
6:45
Suggestion, this again with smaller teams, lil tournament
I lobe how JJ says no real gold because its heavy, not because it's expensive
Part 2 ????? pls
Bro i love cbt 😩
Jheeeze josh had a glow up in that 2 months jump. It's a Tommy T twenty twenty two
Another one👍
Jfjfmf F  F Fmfktt T T  Tmfklfkfktmskk F F  Dkskskkk&£¥0_0-9384!!$.
This had me in actual stitches
UP TO ASLA MANGWAYEGA JATT NE
Nice drawing, Vikk.
Tbh I just watched vik saying “like” the entire time, he said it almost 500 times this video
That was barely a robot battle tho
I like that they stold the design from tombstine
This should be top 10 most viewed vids. Should be at at least 15 mil
Wait... This is the extreme robots arena.. will these robots be at the shows?
Of course the ad had to be chicken 🐔 I bet jj likes that
jjs team should have put blades and on all sides and like tank tries to elevate it
Putting Harry and Ethan, the two chaotic sidemen and Vikk and Josh, the two most strategic sidemen all in one team was like sealing JJ's team's fate. They got lucky with the powerful blade design (I say lucky because they weren't being serious with the design phase, but the Hammer and Front Dragon Spike Ramp came in clutch.  If Vikk's team thought about putting a shock absorber on the hammer arm, their hammer could've been working and probably would've broken the other bot.
simon nd jj’s little convos inbetween are everything
How they gonna survive that *smashing a toy*  Them smashing entire washing machines
Let's be honest here the only reason the golden daddy did not win is becuz the sperm dispenser wasn't used
Still a shame fans stormed the Filming area
dat was a funny ahh comercial
This is one of the best sidemen Sundays
31:24 that scream and the random dwarf person in the back
That ninja star in the thumbnail looks so dumb lol
Is it not Mario Music in the background? 19:50
Is there a side restaurant in iowa  if there isn't pls make one
Jjs robot was good offensively but they didn't think about defence. Viks teams robot had defence properties.
This was by far my favorite sidemen sunday
Its unfair dude when they have josh and vikk and the other team have all of them who are absolute trash
being a huge startwars nerd i can say actually, no darth maul did NOT die when chopped in half
Imagine Chaos 2 or Hypnodisc in this 😩 iykyk 🔥
Ek is mal oor die robot weldone
Bullshi
I was routing for the hammer bot from the start
Part 2?
Robot wars is my childhood Love this
This was so underwhelming at the end
ksi loved the chicken
It olmost was reslly, beating the meat, with all those weard ideeas.
I wish they had started up the robot and it flew out the box and killed them all.      Ive been dissapointed.
Did JJs grp use Tombstone as an inspiration??
this video deserved more views
Ngl, this is probably my favorite Sidemen video.
1:02 6:47 love Chris LMFAO 9:43 xd 13:30 k n o w l e d g e 15:37 I like this guy 16:30 19:50 Mario music, youre teasin norty norty where is moresidemen mario kart xd big up chris lmfao
Does anyone know when the hoodie Ethan and Tobi had on during the Reveals, when those Pastel hoodies will be released?
6:35
41:33 LMFAOOOOOO THE HAMMER AND SAW JUST DEAD
35:38 LMFAO
30:25 JESUSSSS
21:37 LMAOOOO
I dislike simon but he choud b worse
I want sideman to build  a bot
No wonder it lost, its just an EGG 😭💗
Collab i never thought i'd ever see: The sidemen with Steve Smith
Best video ever
They need to make more!!!
it’s kinda sad the video is so short because of “fans” breaking in the set
How does this only have 6m views totally shld hv more
40:24 COLD JOSH IS GOATED
Only 6m views so far for this quality video? Age demographic 12-16 am sure.
Thumbnail lied i sad.
we need another one
E G G
If y’all think the should do this video again with different design let’s have 300 like it maybe a year letter but I hope they do it
This deserves more views👊
10 minutes in, josh team making full plans, jj team egg blade 🤦 I wonder who wins 😂
I want to see more of this
ayo
brings sides to australia plz
As a person who watched battlebots  there design is very familliar
The fact also “fans” broke into this set too is wild
Battle bots 2
We need more😂
jj's attempt of drawing a robot is whats gonna lead us to robot uprisings
I love how as soon as the name “Golden Daddy” is spoken, everyone is just automatically like, “Aw yeah, that’s it right there!” Including me. :)
Underrated video
straight banger
Anyone else come here after watching them talk about it on Sidemen Reacts?
What the f*** are those welds bruh
I think vikk's team should've added hella blades atleast they'll have some armor and then tenderize then
Harry was wearing tgfbro childish mearch
I feel for the cleaners
the hoodie tobi and ethan are wearing is so hot
new   tia  in   red
Nice
thanks  andy  for   making  this   video
Any other frustrated star wars fans watching?
6:43 😂😂😂😭😭🤣🤣
I haven't finished the video yet but bruh. Vik's team has no idea what they're in for. After seeing JJ's team destroy the washing machine I was blown away  Edit: wow they really screwed that up lmao
Imagine the state of the toys that Harry's team got would've been against JJ's egg blade
Legendary video
Why’d this flop? One of there best?
The tenderizers shoulda called their robot  *“The meat beater”*
SICK VIDEO
Darth maul lived
So sad this video flopped with the views.
Tenderize is written with a Z
JJ was so confident and cocky 😂 was so good to see his team lose
Mmm, sides
I love how the gold daddy is literally destroying a tv and a microwave and the tenderiser is barley destroying a toy they are just dismantaling it
do more pls
0:59 That Harry voice crack.😂😂👌👌
https://youtu.be/ODR2bUtj0bc
I'm everywhere
this reminds be of Big Hero 6 😭😭
Vik and Josh makes the toughest duo.
Me seeing this after watching go go squid 2
underrated video. this was super fun to watch
Darth maul dident day
Dearth mail didn’t die he came back in the clone wars and he ended up ruling mandalore a planet SO NO HE DIDNT DIE!!
This is one of the most underrated videos of sidemen
harry in the sidemen eats promo was the funniest thing man
Ksi vs logan paul robot fighting.
This video is so much better than I ever thought
https://youtube.com/shorts/lWMkEXwrr9o?feature=share
The fact that they actually discussed about the proper spelling of "Tenderizer" and said it was properly spelled with an "s" and not an "z" ... which is the correct way anyhow, is hilarious in my opinion lol
39:46 “your tisin” 🤣
We need a part 2
my man at the start has gold grills
This video is sick and needs more views
this video would of popped off if it had a better thumbnail tbh. I didnt even notice they made a cool video like this until the mukbang vid. Or if it was a gaming version.
Let the wars begin
How is this not on bare views?????
How did this vid get very less views. HOW
how does this only have 6 mil
Vik's team actually played really good. The other team robot was prolly more powerful but they managed to destroy their blade by sacrifing their hammer and then their bot was stronger
Harry rocking tgf Merch love to see it
Part 2 !
The best video
Sidemen architects?!!
This needs more views! It's sooo good!
This was such a good Sidemen video. I really enjoyed it. Thanks
The welding on those robots 🤮🤮
Half of the video is just the eating 😓
This video is hella underrated
The poor man that had to deal with these 7 lunatics plus 1. I admire him 😂 I love these guys so much.
Respect major damage
Robot wars 2 pls
We need a part two of this
They should 100% do it again
voice crack lol 7:11
Should have built one with a ramp and a saw blade in the middle with the ramp doubling as a flipper 👀
bangin vid
amazing Video! But u should have taken 2 engineers, one for each team that really is only for one team...!
16:14 funniest transition 😂
Make another video like this 🔥
Sidemen are so entertaining ✌️ they are the best YouTube Group
Egg blade 🔥💀
Round 2 next year?
That intro was dope though
Just wanna say neither of them can stand up to the minotaur 👀
ayy this is just like boxing fam like ksi's team had a swarmer robot and harry's team had a slugger robot like what?
This was such a sick video
Is nobody gonna say anything about the welds?🤣
Banger
Robot wars 2 surely!
bruh who welded that? jessssssssssssusssssssssssss
Bit anticlimactic that they both broke within a minute tbh..
Did Simon reference Naruto handsigns?
I really liked it it was a different than usual but good
Hmm
Can we talk about that thumbnail 😭
The food actually looks edible unlike beast burger 🤢
Really really awesome!!!!!!!!
3:28
so cooooool!
I was rooting for the tendorizer team but when i saw the other team robot destroy a washing machine I was abit shook for the other team but I still stuck with the tendorizers who at the end won....yay
Watching sidemen just makes me feel so free somehow
Definitely need a round 2!!!
If there’s not a part 2 I’ll cry
when i saw both of them for the first time i was like yh the golden daddy lost cuz that's perfect flat surface for a mallet but... my god i don't know if the armour will survive that but if the golden daddy got to the wires, it's game
Josh team are chickens
It was a straight up L the moment they gave JJ the controller
hahhaha
well team EGGBLADE was ploughing  through "Home Appliances" n other team Lets not talk about it "Plastics" 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣...i guess blade got ruined in that destruction rather then during the hammer blow
Babatunday builds a robot
I love the back and forth showing Ethan and Vik’s drawing to JJ’s squiggly lines 😂
Vik og
0:46 the guy looks like Diego Costa
i was eating food while they were doing the sideats ad , felt like i  was at a cinema
Eggsecutor
This was so amazing, we need more of this surely!
Jokes on your Chris Darth maul didn't die!
Ethan: "that's not bad..."  Harry: "Yeah...."  Ethan: "Harry F it'
why does evey title have extreme in it  like bruh
battlebots robot's are better
Ksi walked in that bih like it was a gta 5 heist
ethan’s dad is john cena
Can the sdmn make a robot wars part 2
<Great video i like your energy and professionalism in your videos.. I remember months ago when I joined  your channel and watched a video where you spoke about your confidant Michael Eugene Fred who has been a fundamental part of your journey, I am happy I reached out to him like you suggested because his one on one  crypto sessions  has made me better. copying his daily cause of action, has helped me avoid mistakes and get better returns, thank you so much I also feel you should make more vids like that , it will  help people know the right person to use to get  a better one on one experience when the youtube videos are not enough  to avoid never to give giving up, make wrong moves  and  make better yields.
#thankmas
#thankmas
Im really interested in how much this video costs bruh 💰
Darth maul actually came back in the film solo
Part two please
The blades dead lol 😂 probably shouldn't have used it against a laundry machine and a microwave
Bring sides to the US
Can we just talk about the fact that darth maul didn’t actually die in the prequels and we saw him in Star Wars rebels where he died to obi wan
This is incredible i did 2 years of robotics and have small experience in battlebots but its amazing how well this was done ,good job guys
Coming back to this, how does it only have 5.5M views ?? Banger vid
Ayyyy
say lenny one more fckin time vik jesos
dude actually a sick video
Pt 2!!!!
27:00
Harry at the beginning “sorry sorry, I don’t know what I’m talking about, say something” 😂🙂
“I wanna break their robot, I wanna fuckin see it crumble!” The energy in his eyes as he says that and the villain hands lmfao.
“Why have the British Military Not got this”🤣🤣🤣
Chris needs to be in more of these
Wait are the sidemen sponsored by Pepsi???
Behz is not a promoter He said that the food is not that bad Who would say that 😂💀
Like a championship of battle bots but only youtubers
Imagine a YouTube war of these bots
I've met a few propper robot wars people
PART 2 !!!!!!!
Jj team was so pathetic 🤣
Honestly can't understand why this doesn't have more views, best sidemen Sunday in a while IMO
Who else predicted which robot would win?
No offense, but am I the only one who noticed that all of the Sidemen's teeth are white?...Then, there is the one dude 💀😬🦷
To 19:32
I meant 19:30
Darth maul did survive being cut in half. He got robot spider legs
Ethans team: We need a big hammer thin at the top and a and we’ll need rear side defences and a big spiky wall thing at the front  Jj’s team: AN EGG THAT LEAKS SP*RM
That food at the beginning looks amazing 🤤
JJs team clearly wins because they destroyed the opposite teams hammer before their blade stopped working a little while after which means that the team with The hammer robot lost because there robot was already destroyed before JJs teams robot pushed in the pit
This was the fans break in video
JJ ofc I do!!!!! To stinking
W
Ako lang ba pipino dito
So permanent series??
I feel sad that the big nostalgic shows I grew up watching, and so did the Sidemen evidently, haven't performed as well as others on this channel.   Crystal Maze and Robot Wars were both hugs parts of my childhood. They deserve more love
More reality TV bullshit ...
the welding hurts
Part 2
That was amazing
Zerka really had it out for the wheelbarrow.
2 months later n jj forgot about the sperm leakage
i want to see them recreate them then fight the big one!
another one
Do a sidemean side food mukbang
Sorry but the food looks just like other burgers so what's so special
Don't put both the big brain sweats(Josh n Mr.Star )on the same team makes it too predictable.
Would of been stronger PVA glued together than that welding
When JJ’s team revealed their robot, Harry’s teams reaction can turn straight into a meme. It’s my first meme thought so I may not be good but idk.
part 2 of this one would be nice
6:49 nobody should ever sleep on the banter 😂🤣😂
Should definitely another one of these, couod do a round robin or 2v2v2 teams wouod be cool to see how it would go
Why are their vids getting less views nowadays
Tommy T linking up with Prof Vik 🔥
6:50
Part 2 should be a no brainer
bro literary watch this battle bots when i was 5 yrs old
https://youtu.be/SzFNWz4qsos
Battlebots in this video - Tombstone - Whiplash - Beta - Rotator - Minotaur
Give me the vitamin d
We need a part 2
this is gold!!!!
I knew when I saw the difference between plastic toys being destroyed and washing machines and TV’s being obliterated that JJ’s team won
Felt like the final battle was way too short and have different people controlling it next time if there is a next time…
They should of made it "the beater of meat"
I’m just watching them trying out their robot’s attacks and I mean... surely KSI’s Chris’, tobi’s and Simons team is gonna 100% win, right? 😂
Why did this video get almost no views
Vik + Josh!! 💥 golden daddy seemed OP, but the tenderizer did its thing 💥
🔥
Lol that was a good 5 mins of entertainment
No vid this week or what??
Ayo where’s this week’s drop fam?

Not colchester 😭😭😭
Split into 4 team and do it again please
build a giant gingerbread house
That’s mad yo
Is this vid when sdmn fans broke in the set??
Harry's childish hoodie is absolute 🔥🔥🔥🔥
So 37:03 at this point if the tenderizer attacks from the sides then it'll win and if the golden daddy attack from the from the front it'll win
This is literally blunt vs slash damage but robots
Thought JJ would call it Golden Frieza
Nah Darth Maul survived. Returned in the Clone Wars.
When I saw one can destroy washing machines and the other can’t break plastic I knew who would win
Yall need to do squid game irl sidemen version now
This is elite af
Toby kinda killed the mood
awesome video!!
They spelt tenderiser wrong lol
Next there will be a supermarket called “sidemen express” subtitle: “allow it fam”
The robot guys teeth : 🟨🟨🟨
William Osman be fuming rn
Stats at 40:00 🙄
SIDEMEN : THE CUBE based on the Australian or american tv show THE CUBE where contestants were made to do difficult tasks inside a giant glass cube
This was such a good video
Is this the shoot where all the fans broke in while filming?
Part 2???
They both broke within a minute lmao
Cool 😎
EggaTron Would of been a cool name
Smh not rating spinners
yoo the welding on these is so horrible
New video idea for the sidemen: SIDEMEN MAKE A SONG IN 24 HOURS CHALLENGE  feat. Bella Poarch.
robot action... just like travis scott :L
.
guys we need more silent libary
Just admit it u just skipped till the fight begin
Vik: thinking about how to annihilate his enemy team's robot with features JJ:  E G G   B L A D E
Ngl I loved battle bots but I don’t think it comes anymore
Noice
Every sidemen sunday is a must watch tbh 🤷🏻‍♂️
part 2!!!!!!!!!
Why would jj drive forward right when the other team can push it in the pit? JJ is bad at video games and bad at anything that requires skill. Give him something that requires very little skill.
Tobi is such a pussio about destroying objects.
This video is basically for people who play video games. Everyone else like Ethan Harry and jj are trash.
This is why jj is bad at video games. He barely moves it forward.
Vik looks good in jeans.
we got toby's medicine https://youtube.com/shorts/Qemx4LftxII?feature=share
7:40 ZA WARUDO!!!!!!!!
This reminds me of the Disney Channel show lab rats that one episode
Ethan looks like a white Kevin Hart
Darth maul lived
They should not have let either of them have spinning disks because they tend to be the only thing that wins 100 percent of the time. That seems like a weighted expectation meaning, they should have had to design something other then a spinning disk.
1:21 not my dumbass thinking it was an ad
i like how they had to rent a schools sports hall
VIK and Ethan were both saying the ideas for the robot and they were all what I was thinking
2.6K violence haters viewed this video!
Harry team laughing about destroying little tikes toys The other team touching a washer and slaughtering ut
44:25 looks like hitler in Auschwitz
Do another silent library it was great
6:45
25:40
The fact that jjs team was given metal apliences and viks team was given plastic toys shows
Big respect to the guy who made the robots and set it up. Such a nice guy
This is sooo nostalgic......💕💕 #loveyourchannel
This is a very random question, anyone know where Chris M’s hoodie is from ? 😂
I love sidemen videos and 99% of them are bangers, this one tho ain’t for me
Nah when ever made they weapons so weak or me heated
43:06 😔poor sportsmanship by jj man
Just because the test was against metal instead of plastic Im gunna say that KSI's team wins
josh did AMAZING at controlling the robot. even when the hammer broke he was awesome
Does anyone know when the pastel colour block hoodies in the vid are dropping?
😂🤣🔥
My dad clicke a pic with u guys
I have an idea for a video and it is to play lingo I think that would make a funny video
Golden Freiza ?
Josh is so attractive in this icl
I was so psyched throughout the whole video
The engineers needs some credit tho , we want to see the design stage
Literally made Big hero 6 irl
3:27 pause and look at the hard evidence that Harry is indeed a Na............
I feel like Randy would’ve made a great fit as the plus one for this video. Don’t get me wrong MD is also a great fit
Next video Sidemen Rugby
it's jus like what they say a good defence is a great offence
Not really entertained by this one sadly :( weird because I usually Love robot wars
I feel bad for ethan's dad
Jj 20 women vs 1 is needed before the end of the year!!!
This is so entertaining 😂
The Uber eats Ad was funny Harry Messed it up
DO SIDEMEN FEAR FACTOR
What’s the discount code
Ain’t no way these niggaz just showed all that food and im sitting here hungry
how does this not have more views... its still 10/10 in terms for views! considering the amount og effort they put into this i thought it would do well!
Where's the timestamp of where JJ says he no longer have Neo & Morpheus? T^T
Now I wanna see them in actual Battle Bots.
Remember when they did the crossbar challenges and they would bait us in with the drop music and miss the bar, dammn good old times 😂😂
What’s the discount code again?
Doin
the host needs to brush his teeth
Part 2 coming when??
Nah we need a rematch bro
can yall do strength test part 2 to see how much yall improved
I need more
.
This was so good
Vikk is the best at controlling the robot
This video concept was epic
Remember watching the like 5-6years ago massive throw back
We need part 2 this was so good
Sidemen The Apprentice Phil is Lord Sugar
9:15 Darth Maul did indeed survive...  Sorry I had to be that guy.
Anybody know what’s the Hoodie that Chris is wearing?!  Asking for a friend 👀
Jjs idea went from 📈📈📈📈📉📉📉📉
Hear me out ... sidemen storage wars 😂
"why have the british military not got this"😂😂
Got juiced on the build and still won 🤣
Let's appreciate the intro and outro edits at the end especially, they are sick.. some epic editing done
Is sideman too big for youtube
So much efforts for 5 mins of fun ? 🤣
This was the best sidemen Sunday video ever 😀😎
harry reping the tgf merch

these guys are single handedly carrying youtube
There was 5 minutes of battle 😂
Bruh
#sidemenTinderInRealLife
Underated vid
Again
Darth Maul survived getting cut in half and came back in the Clone Wars and Rebels as one of the best Star Wars characters of all time then died in a rematch (they fought again before this in the clone wars) with Obi Wan on Tationne when Luke was a young boy
31:35 Tobi Is Holding This Man Telling Him To Cut It Off. Grown Man Is Scared Of A Washing Machine Getting Hurt. Hate This Dude. (kidding. or not)
Quick question does that guy brush his teeth?
Actually hype for eatsides because beast burger has like 1 place in the UK so I can't get it delivered. Hopefully a UK team will have more restaurants in their home country.
Bro they needed to get Colin Furze on this video.
I swear vik looked like a gta character walking into someone’s crib at 00:21
The most used word in the entire video: like
That was exciting to watch
That was dope
I was hooked when JJ drew a fuckin egg  Nice to see all their brains working as 1 instead of 7 tho lol
the welds on those robots have been done by a blind man
i want to see more groups of youtubers building with these guys and then a full on battle to see who is the greatest builders and drivers... youtubers took over the boxing scene, now let them take over the robot wars scene!
The should have had a robot each and done a battle royale. Or 2v2v2v2. 5 mins of battling just isnt enough…
I know that this is so random but I want to see ksi on I'm a celebrity get me out of here
noticed how josh always goes paper first up
Simon and tobi did there team dirty bro
JJ: can we make a gun bruh had me laughing so hard
All that hype for that mess of a fight at the end? Aw was kinda peak but good build up!
I’m pissed
Why do they give it to JJ 🤦🏻‍♂️ he always messes it up
shouldve definitely be 2v2v2v2 cuz ethan n vikk were on the same brain wavelength.
That was Great!!!!
Battle Bots 2 please!
Yo this is sick! Do a part 2 pls. We need more🔥🔥💯💯
only people who saw this from SIDEMENREACTS are elite!
think we need a SIDEMEN EXTREME PUNISHMENT POOL #3
This is the best sidemen video ever
When’s the next annual moo off boys?
ngl when I saw the blade, I did not expect them to lose
VIK TO JOSH: Run away your gonna die, run away your gonna die, run away, run away, run away your gonna die, run away runaway
TGF childish jumper looking fire
I never see grown man be so happy over a robot war 🤣 Great video made me laugh
Another one 😂😂🔥
Good video until they both broke. Then 10 mins of nothing
How to make grown man happy, this video explains it all
Another please
Harry has tgf hoodie childish respect
I couldn’t help but notice that Simon says “this comes out in November” makes me wonder when it was filmed
the engineer is the only one with yellow teeth
This was surprisingly fun
who gave JJ the controller?!?! 🤦🏻‍♂️
vid idea- sideman go ice-fishin
Its so fun to see Josh enjoying himself so much since most the time hes the one who just plans and doesn’t get involved much in the fun stuff 😃
The hammer design part was too funny for me to handle, vik: let’s put some texture on it. Ethan: oh yeah like beating your meat🤣
challenge a premier league team to a 7 aside game
Should av called one of the robots roomba 2000 lol
Fantastic video but 43:08 when Ethan wanted to handshake was painful.
Bro is stupid for attacking the tenderizer from front
i know shows often get different names in different countries but like im sure we can all agree battle bots sounds so much cooler than robot wars
All that just for the blade and hammers to be broken within 10 seconds. What were those nerd engineers doing?? 😂
Today is W2S birthday 🥳
The sidemen making a restaurant at this point bros gonna have the best passive income in all of YouTube
yall should do another sidemen spelling bee
Do a part 2
Bruv what is this new quality daym.
6:54
Surly call it the meat beater?
We need part 2.0
wtf how did i not know this was posted until 3 days later
stinker
I'm still a bit confused that why does everyone say something about Harry and lines?
11:21
After loosing Simon blames jj for the loss but it was actually Chris messed up and after that round thing gone of Chris tried to give to Simon but he didn't then he given jj .  Vik was wrong the part where hammer causes that round thing off but it was actually Chris that slammed his Robot into the wall that really caused it off
Sidemen remote kitchen lessgooo
damn i hoped this would do well :(
*Beerus 2.0*
We need F2 Freestylers Vs Sidemen
That was so sick!!! Lmao
Bruh that was sick
35:40 when the oh’s turn to regret
Ah, Englands MrBeast Burger. Banging.
the whole video led up to a flimsy hammer and a dud blade
This video was an L tbh
Bro his teeth are... YELLOW DAMN
Vik I have your auntie for science. That's so cool
CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD CHRISMD
What are the odds bro one team wanted to beat the “meat” and the other team wanted sperm to come out 😭😭
Dumb... 2 months to make and the robot stops working
These new Roombas are getting out of control 💯
Calling for a Sides Mukbang!
Josh too cold on the sticks
Hey guys, my sister is flying to London for the weekend and I wanted to know how much does the ps5 cost there
The fact that the robot guys build exactly what they wanted is legendary
Needs to be done again with more teams, this was unreal
Harry lookin buff
That chicken looks good asf
wonder how expensive this video was
Hope the both war robots were made by different person,then it would have been so much more fun
"is there any way we can make it more offensive in a simple way".... that csaught me off guard lmao
Vik: "can we put something more offensive"  Me: naming it the N word?
11:34 couldve just written the n-word on it... :D
Can anyone help? There’s no details in the description of who tf the robot company was and I wanna know how to book a day for my partner 😭
‎
idk if this was coincidence but when they were making CHICKEN ksi was the first one to appear and to smell 😭
Darth maul survived and didn’t die when he was cut in half so Simon was right
Robot wars idea was discussed in sidemen reacts now we see this happen
Sidemen pls do diss  track battle again because we want vickstar diss track again (i heard that yesterday and i love it🤣🤣🤣)
The way Ethan talked at the start had me dying 😂
Man they deserve much more subs... They are the best content creatirs on the platform
This is probably the best Sidemen video
5:10
Yo bro there is a video in your ad
“Did he die” “We didnt see”  Star Wars: The Clone Wars would like to have a word.
6:44 The best of this video🤣🤣🤣
Vik's team had the ramp which was a failsafe when the hammer stopped working. JJ's team had a lethal blade, but when the blade stopped working their robot had no way to defend itself or attack. Vik's genius and passion for building the robot were elite! Incredible video!!!
Happy birthday Harry
Talk about wasted talent ... R.I.P  Golden Daddy
I was leaning towards not watching this but I’m happy i did
👎
Darth Maul survived getting chopped in half.
brush your  teeth "mR rObO eXpErT"
if only they actually got people that were good at making robots then maybe we would have more than 1 minute of robot fighting.
These robots 🤖 look menacing.  👌
I took one look at the bots and gave the tenderizer a 0% change at winning, the blade going out was the only way they could win there. GG boiz
Yo ngl tobi kinda pissed me off. After Chris hit the microwave and all that he’s like yo cut it bro chill. Like dude it’s the whole point let him mess some stuffy up wtf
39:55  Thank me later
Everyone thought Ethan’s teams one would win easily then they see Simon’s one spinning hahaha
the color grading on the intro is not it
This guy looks like DanTDM
I love how they went out of their way to do something nice for Cris. And they got a banger video out of it.
Star Wars fact: darth maul didn’t die after fell. I don’t remember the full story and I haven’t read the comics but I know he fell into a trash gather somehow and was transport to a trash world. And for 15(I think) years he pretty much became insane and fed off of trash and made like spider legs, then I think he was rescused by his brother who had been powered up by like their species mother thing, and branch to his home planet and gave legs,  More years later he was in control of mandalore for and like a few days/weeks .and killed obi wan’s lover (Ikr most people didn’t know obi wan had a girlfriend) he almost died when being chased by Ashoka tano (anakin’s padawan) and was captured. But cause of order 66 happening at the most “perfect” time the ship he was captured on crash into a planet, but he barely made an escape during the commotion. He went into hiding, then I think 5-7 years before a new hope, he found out that obi wan was on tatooween and he showed up to kill his major enemy, and when he found obi wan, he found out that obi was protecting someone (luke skywaker) and at the sound of that obi wan ignited his lightsaber, a quick but beautiful fight ensued, with mail trying to kill obi wan how he kill obi wan’s master he was slice through the middle of his chest, killing him in the hands of his mortal enemy.
WTF are those welds at 17:29
For a second I thought I’d seen Sidemen House 2, alas, not everything we wish for shall be granted.
Need a ROBOT WARS 2
6:25
Bruh golden daddy out here destroying washing machines while the tenderizer is destroying plastic
Fam these 20 second double ads😡😡😡😡
Anyone else lose-key not find jokes about Ethan’s dad funny 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️ after seeing how to bezinga I just don’t find the jokes funny
Any time vik gets to use his brain, his team will win
I feel like Vik in jeans doesn't really work
The tenderizer - LOOKS BADASS 😎 The Golden Daddy - LOOKS LIKE BREAKFAST 😂
This feels like an episode of the apprentice 😭😭
Anyone else feel like the battle itself was anti-climactic a little? the weapons broke after 30 seconds and it was just like bumper cars after that. Decent vid, but not the greatest
sidemen burgers like mr beast burgers?????????
This is when the so called “fans” broke into their shoot. SMH
One of the best videos they've ever done
Plz do Family Feud
The Sidemen never fail to keep coming up with fresh ideas, this channel just keeps getting better and better.
I’m surprised that JJ didn’t instantly go to Golden Frieza. But he went to Golden Daddy
Probably the most boring sidemen sunday ive seen
Tenderizer low key looks like JJ
They should have done more than one round
This video was elite 😂
Damm it pains me to see welds that bad 🤣
JJ Golden Dragon
Sponsored by pepsi
How is this trending on GAMING
The series of sounds made by JJ and Tobi at 32:07 are from another dimension
this is one of your coolest videos ever definitely top 10
If sidemen make food I would love to see them make chicken and beef combined 🤤
That guys teeth make me feel ill
When Chris said about darth maul dying actually he is still alive because he’s alive in the clone wars series
Why is JJ holding the controller like that 🤣
Maybe one of those bots can fix JJ hairline
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
Great design on the Tenderizer, it just looked like it had more options
1:25 that walk in looks like they bouta plan a heist
Simon always cries about everything but never wants to be involved unless it’s football
I think simon should have driven it lol
Part 2 👇
The guy at beginning sounds like James acaster
This was to sick, definitely want to see this again
Bro I wanna go to London just to try the food
Vik destroing plastic- YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHHH WE WI|LL WIIINNNN Chris casually dominating washing machines
anyonelse just skip to the fight
https://youtu.be/Fn0dnFKkaxk
@43:04
what was the discount code??
man calls himself a star wars expert but didn't watch maul come back in clone wars or finally die at the end of rebels
This big robot kinda looks like JJ
2:37 josh goes unappreciated sometimes this was gold and unexpected. especially bc of past vids where harry makes fun of his own weight
Big up josh he’s so cool
This sidemen Sunday was bloody sick
banger
Bro when I saw the title U freaked out I was like SIDEMEN DID A BATTLE BOTS VIDEO OMG!!!!!!!
L vid
It all started with a reaction video
jesus christ simon and tobi bitched the most but didnt offer to drive it lol such a buzzkill
Dead video
Damn i loved this video
42:43
I think we need a part 2 to this
Sidemen makes documentaries now?😂
Ay charter hall
Only real Star Wars fans know Darth maul didn’t die
ethans team : 1000 iq robot drawings          jj's team: EgG bLade
Vikk and Josh leave the sidemen to pursue a career in robot battling
I can’t believe i thought they collated with McDonald’s at first
man the intro was soo cringe
Fun Fact: This was recorded months in advance before KSI released his “All Over The Place” album
This was so sick!
It was so smart to put that ramp in the front. Because if the hammer would break then they would have a backup offensive/defensive trait that wont ever break by mechanical disruption. Meanwhile the other team only had one offensive weapon that could very likely break and no other backups except for their ability to drive on both sides. But that wont help at all in offense
One of the best sidemen videos ever
Odds on this becoming a monthly thing 😅
If da blade didn’t stop game over
I watched this 2x speed cos I was bored
26:00
DARTH MAUL LIVED
God bless spread the gospel
11:13 I just remembered Simon told us a looong time ago somehwere that they recorded the first part of a Sidemen video that day and the rest would be filmed months after. This has to be that video
Pov:2030 sidemen branded cars
Who does the welding on these things😂
Is anyone gonna mention how mad the robot guy’s s teeth are 😂
Plz more robot wars
9:52 Darth Maul actually didnt die, he managed to survive down there by eating bugs and the such. He eventually died at the hands of Obi Wan Kenobi many years later.
LETS GO
This was so hype 😂😂
Tty
Sidemen doesn't give any discount code for this week Everyone: wait that's illegal
WE NEED A PART 2 DUDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Wow everyone just ignored the voice crack of jj on 6:20
Sidemen Sundays are just field trips with the boys at this point 😂
This engineer making the designs for them, he litterly has no personality. Just looking at him annoys me
Anyone else notice the HAMR sight on the thumbnail lmao
The 20+ fuckin adds in only 20 mins just makes me not even want to continue watching the whole video
His teeth irl said england
Both robots are useless! They should have made something like Minotair, Tombstone or Witch Doctor!
Extreme robot wars 2?
I came here to see who’s more creative but instead I end up seeing food and getting hungry 😩😭
great video bois
It's hilarious to me how viks team are smashing bits of plastic and jjs team are smashing up metal kitchen appliances 😂😂😂
W for Vikk's idea
Golden daddy was one hell of a MONSTER!! but vik's design and Josh's driving skills harassed the monster😂 i mean they lost it the very moment jj took the controller😂😂 GOLDEN DADDY: 0 WEAKNESSES THE TENDERIZER :5 WEAKNESSES  Still TENDERIZER won!!  SKILLS MATTER😂
BTEC Robot wars lol
men why did they give it to JJ + why did the thing stop ?
Too sick, need a rematch
Classic Simon blaming JJ even though it's not his fault . Such a worst character 💩
The production is MAADDDD 😤🔥
that took an unexpected turn
the robot maker is so fit i’m in love
Wow something new that’s not hide and seek amazing
Ending was a let down with the weapons not working... PART 2!!!!
Lmao 42:44 to see simon pissed xD
Walking in like they about to do a Heist
Bro they open up to so many business ideas using there popularity
10:00
need 2nd part plsssssss
Soo fawking cringe I like it🤣🤣
Yo we need a part 2 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love when one team is like so creative and another one is just like " okay what is the best one" 🤣
That was so entertaining I watched it twice, back to back! Robot wars is sick
my school laptop is the exact same  laptop they used
0:59 harry f...ed it
Need a part 2 of this please
0:35 JJ be looking kinda Thicc Lmao
I like how KSI just goes for the chicken
Those burgers at the beginning of the video look bussing bussing
Am I the only nerd who was naming all the bots as they came on screen. 😂😂 Both robot wars (UK) and BattleBots (worldwide entrants based in US) are awesome shows
22:57 vik is me when I'm watching ph lmfao
The best sidmen Sunday.👍✌🔥👊
Toby... Shhh let the boys play
22:10 okk lets goooo
Please get HARRY PINERO IN NEXT VIDEO SIDEMEN
Being a 27 year old this video is blokes living your childhood dream. Sick vid
I love when one team is like so creative and another one is just like " okay what is the best one" 🤣
The outro is sick tho 🔥
Make it a series
What a fuckin awesome video reminds me of sitting watching robot wars before school
Made me so hyped up from the start by destroying all those objects. Kind of a bummer with how fast both of their weapons broke.
Enjoy seeing Chris on the sidemen Sunday’s
I just realized a Robot battle attracts a hell lotta Bots in the Comments lol. 😂😂
28:18 that's what Arnold Schwarzenegger said
this vid must have been expensive
Please make your videos shorter!
Tobi was shook the whole time “Cut it cut it!! Turn it off, turn it off!!”😂🤣😂
Should’ve called it the parent!
any news on the sidemen figures????
dislike
Josh got that GTA experience coming in handy for him lmao
This was dope
17:29 everything looks so good apart from that ghastly weld
Party 2 when?
that was awwwwfuly short we want moooore of this
This needs to happen again
Banger
JJ Simon tobi and Chris call it the golden daddy issue
that was awesome
Pt. 2?
One of the best video of sidemen
3:28 POV germany 1940
For all of those that just wanted to see some robots fighting, skip to 38:54
“It won’t be beerus it’ll be … “ I was instantly thinking he was going to say champa
Is Tobi hoodie a new sidemen drop? 👀
Who thought gordon ramsey when they saw the food
0:15 WHYYY, I AM HUNGRYY NOW 😭
We need a part 2 but nit the same teams the teams should be team sidemen vs some other group ,
Awesome video until the end. So hype for so little action
Such a good video!
So is the eat side thing in the UK,worldwide, or what
Would've been great to see them go up against some Robot Wars Veterans
part 2 would be sick
The battle was extremely anticlimactic
KSI finally off his period and looking energetic.
Did Simon just cabbage that guy oh no
https://youtu.be/Zbj-SYEBW1g    ROBOT WARS 2
More of this please
Why does simons teams robot look like a vehicle from dune

WE WANT A PART 2
I would not be angry if this was a regular thing.
Its so weird seeing Ethan and Tobi wear Harries hoodie lol
29:56 I've never seen Ethan so happy destroying his childhood memories
Am I the only one who noticed that they all were wearing hoodies
More
Simon should stfu honestly he doesn’t do anything but talks as if he does something.
Excuse me, Y'all i wanna ask sumthin.. Recently my phone gettin weird idk why but there's website that automatically open even when i'm in an app for example Yt... the vid that i was watching suddenly paused then direct me to a freakin annoying link that was unstopable.. PLS Y'ALL I NEED HELP 😭
Part 2 asap
so anyone see the tik tok of a fan running in like 1-2 weeks ago?
Every teenager would have this and use it 24 seven just to mess up stuff and I’ll be so sad fine
Imagine teenagers having this as a toy
they really made a travis scott robot
clearly the sidemen haven't watched the clone wars if they talk about maul like that. 🙄
If the sidemen ever add a new member I hope it’s Chris.
so if chris didnt hit the wall the blade wouldve had a hit on them
Jj lost it for them😢😢😢
Damn that hoodie Josh is wearing is fresh af!
Idk if anyone notice but the thumbnail for viks robot is so lacking man it's just the saw blade pasted over the hammer, like u can still see the hammer hahahahaa
Knew josh would win. Walking dub.
Why would any sensible human give Harry, the worst person in the world on the sticks, the chance to drive a dangerous hunk of metal.💀
43:08, pain.
a round 2?
We want another robot wars
I am expecting a sidemen restaurant mukbang
We need pt2!!!
I expected a 360 noscope from the robot, thats disappointing
JJ’s team : drawing Freid egg Ethan team: being productive
Those welds 😂😂😂
14:56
The best YouTube channel
Just saying if they started selling sidemen deathbots I'd buy one lol
Kinda disappointed that both the robots broke
Darth Maul didn't die. He had gone insane and was waiting for years until Savage Opress came and rescued him.
simon isnt wrong Darth maul did not die he came back in the clone wars
JJ can’t drive 😂
I just wanna say, darth maul didn’t die
Brilliant video I most admit that tobi character doesn't really bring anything to this group of people hes a lovely guy but he's really blagged hes way through this life
Josh timing his hammer and countering the egg blade was one of the COLDEST things i've ever seen
We need a part 2
A holy piece of content ----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtWA6bldvTY
EXTREME MUKBANG??
@sidemen This was awesome!!! I hope u guys get the oppurtunity to do it again!!
Please again part 2 must have to 4 wheels with square

Whats the track that drops 20 seconds in?
Well good brill content lads well done lloks so much fun wood love to do it 🙌👊😎😎👏👏
Toby: turn it up more?
Honestly, I thought the Blade would demolish the Hammer robot
The production has got so much better than the first sidemen Sunday
Inertia is not “stored energy”
Good idea but the only fun part lasted a couple minutes
the mvp is tenderizer's armour
ChrisMD has finally made it
Josh was like, "Smooth Operator, it was a smoooooth operation"
I like how both teams touched on the two most violent bots in the competition, Minotaur and Tombstone
this video was dead
Yes my team win
Bro, the difference in the way both teams say “our robot is lethal” is amazing. One robot is obliterating everything, while the other is breaking plastic toys with a little hammer lol!
KSI: picks up TOMBSTONE, the most notorious bot in the competition and says “let’s create something like this 🙂”
He’s definitely not a welder
Simon would have done so much better being the pilot for the team
ChrisMD in a sidemen video is always great
ROUNDDDD 2!!!!!
Maul lived god damnit
Let’s be honest, we all knew this video was coming eventually. Also, Sides is gonna be banging. I can’t wait!
The joke about calling it Ethan’s dad and not having a robot was elite 😂😂😂😂😂
Why the hell did jj get the controller🤦🤦🤦😂😂😂
funny cause Darth Maul didnt acc die
ive never been this hyped! when the Tenderizer pushed golden daddy into the pit!!
ethan is not funny.
vikk's team: we will have war jj's team: we want to spill our sperm all over the floor
Harry team drawing actual concepts    Jj team: egg blade, circle
Darth maul lives but is overtaken by the force and is driving to insanity and can't leave the planet he is on So he did live just not successful 😕
Loved this 🔥🔥🔥
Loved this lmao XD 😂😂😂
Oh my god they actually did it.
BRUHHHH
this might just be the best sidemen video to date
They have to do a second one, this vid was so amazing
yo is ethan and tobis hoodie discontinued? i need it bad
Bro I thought that Harry’s teams robot was sick compared to jjs hella Na Harry’s one can’t even break a plastic toy 😂😂 while jjs one is ducking washing machines
Simon actually made a good point with Darth Maul, he didn't die for AAAAGES after being chopped in half, like 20 years lol
Get Me To 1,000,000 Without Post Any Videos!
J
Flame emote
never judge a book by its cover
When he says Harry’s on the right lines, me in my head “yeah he is”❄️
WE NEED MORE OF THIS
I love battlebots and robot wars this is great
A round two would have been beautiful
i mean simon wasn't wrong with Maul lmao
This is like big hero 6 openign
ksi look like jj olatungi
Oh I got so excited for the eatsides but I’m  from America lmfao
blowng up
Disappointing JJ.
I need pt2 nowwwwwww
Josh is just good at everything honestly.
Should do this again but in two’s
39:56
Who wants part 2? ME
The sidemen are really gassed up about who will win but the makers from the robots allready knew and starts laughing the losers out and allready bet on the winners😂😂
sidemen hide and seek on a football field with tgf bro and their team
this felt like a gta heist setup
Simon has a point maul didn’t die
Team Golden Dad was a complete letdown
this is sick
I remember when they did a reactiom to robot wars and said they should do it.. well. Here we are😂
tobi’s shadow prollyscares  him
If there was a sponsor, I think everybody would know the sponsor
They literally have the best video ideas
why is no one talking about this dudes teeth?
Wish the builder gave it tank controls
This is ao sick. Now im gonna watch more on youtube😂
Congrats to Harry with hes birthday to morow the 24. November, only legendes are born that day couse i am to💪💪🇩🇰
THE ONE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR
😂😂😂
Are the track pants that Harry is wearing during the last day (when they actually do the fight) still available for purchase? I want to buy one, but I can't seem to find them on the Sidemen Clothing store. Can somebody please get back to me?
W
This is literally the best vid this year ngl
Staunton City Council Unanimously Passed Resolution Condemning Forced Organ Harvesting The city council of Staunton unanimously passed a similar resolution on October 14, 2021, two weeks ahead of schedule. Mayor Andrea Oakes thanked local Falun Gong practitioners in her speech for educating the community about the issue. She said she had communicated with Virginia State Delegate John Avoli about the resolution. Mr. Avoli expressed his support for the resolution, as well as Vice Mayor Mark Robinson.  During the council meeting, the sponsor of the resolution, Councilwoman Carolyn Dull, spoke about how local residents should pay attention to forced organ harvesting in China and avoid unknowingly participating in this type of organ transplants. She thanked local practitioners for their effort. She believes that everyone should stand up and oppose China’s state-sponsored forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience.
darth maul survived l
2 months sheesh
34:03 what was that?
It stoped there blade vik said but the blade carried on🤣
No way has another YouTube merch outfit ripped off teddy fresh's colour block hoodie in almost the exact same way that James Charles ripped them off. 😂
the fact they don’t know darth maul survived 😂😂
this idea was fire
10:15
Filmed in Colchester lol
Group project be like : girl group assignment 13:11 boy group assignment 11:03
Another one
DOOOOOOOOO ANOTHEEEEERŔRRRRRRR
“The Z looks cooler” Well the Z is correct so…yea
Don’t forget the milk 6:46
Colchester <3
Part 2
We DEFO need a part two, with different teams.
Damn, his teeth 🤢
The intro just made me really hungry ngl
No Amount of Calgon was saving that washing machine lol
Yhe sjould have called it the egg fried slice
This made me wanna watch Sidemen doing The Apprentice 😂
Who would have thought a fried egg blade could be so destructive.  Old Man Josh’s driving was the deciding factor though.  GG.
Sidemen ninja warrior pls
Darth maul did not die
The into to their restoraunt is something only sidemen would do, most will redo it😂
This has to be one of  my favorites sidemen sunday vids this year
If I had to pick I would have one similar to Vicks teams hammer but instead a pick axe to stab it in place the I would have two circular swords that move in and slice it while it is pinned   Sike I’ll just have a flamethrower and a shotgun
They should do a tournament of this but its the battlebots game for gameboy advance
Take a shot every time someone say like
round 2
round 2
hey
The sidemen do nothing but improve, it’s crazy how good the production is now
Peanut butter:  Harry: 1:08  🧢
The scoop came in clutch
Vik wasn’t fair in this 💀
Great video idea
The mallet was so disappointing
go team tenderizers!!!
16:53  If u just wanna see the fight and understand it
Would have been better if the weapons didn't immediately fail.
Part 2!!!
This video is amazing 😂 one of my favourite
That welding was shocking!
The sidemen are proper rich
I hoped for Golden frieze but daddy is good too
Right video this 😂😂😂 golf buggy demolition Derby next yeah!😂😂😂
this one can definently see a part 2 like no doubt. Maybe even 4 teams with 2 wars and get some more guests in?
" Congrats to everyone who is early and who found this comment " 🎉🎁
One of the robots called Razor on the original series is my dad’s cousins one 😎
Is no one gonna talk about sidemen food!
SIDEMEN - FOOD??????????
If only the hammer still worked
This was a great video.
Video idea: I’m a sidemen get me out of here (I’m a celebrity)
Been waiting for this for a loooong time!!! Another banger from the sidemen!
For real though. which one looked cooler "Golden Daddy" Or "Tenderizer". Honestly I think Golden Daddy. I think what would of been good is if they had the blade going through the entire thing or having a claw so they can hold it in place and rip it to shreds.
Lmao Simon scolding jj for driving when he didn't touch them in the first place
Man spelt tenderiser wrong lmaoooo (its a joke)
0:56
pepsi > cola
Nice video sidemen
Part 2???
This is going to be so dope
Yo vikk is just genius with design and josh on them sticks!
I knew putting vik and josh on the same team would’ve been a guaranteed W they’re too smart
why do i rember the exact sidemen reacts video saying they want to do this
I thought sides was a troll wth!
Sidemen Fear Factor!
3:27, didn’t know Harry was German…
When was this filmed?
When ksi Said ”lets call it golden… golden…” i was like oh no, don’t call it that 😳😳😂😂
Simon talks too much during the fight but he aint touching the controller
When’s ksi s next consery
Broooo that was too sick
They should have put Simon on the sticks lol
These guys have such a good group around them! Nothing but Ws in there camp!
When it was showing the chief part, I immediately shouted "GORDON RAMSAY!!!"
Tombstone is now called Harry’s mom
Stupid fact no-one cares about or asked, Maul didn't actually die. He survived on his hate alone and made himself spider legs before then being found by his brother and then went on a quest for revenge.
That was sick
Sad, i ordered 5 advent calendars and none had a golden ticket 😭
Man i loved this video👍
Shoutout to SidemenReacts channels for coming up with this banger of an idea.
Hammer broke in 17 seconds. Blade broke in 25 seconds
My god they actually did it
🔥
please do a second video of robot wars. It was sooooo entertaining
GWARN ANDY, MY BOYYYY
ayy Chris MD
Sick video 👍
All the welders watching this i feel your pain!
Love how its meant to be a washing machines when its a tumble dryer 🤣🤣🤣🤣
this is probs the best sidemen vid out there rn, i beg there be a rematch
Anyone else still stuck on the Darth Maul part? Cause like, he's still alive
Red jumper guy was loving life
Ethan’s dad 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Simon KNOWS ABOUT STAR WARS !!!!!
Sidemen always blessing our sundays with these amazing videos <3
Most set up video I've seen
I LOVE THIS VIDEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It’s like the episode in spaced
I’m happy they got Chris on another video
Too bad his teeth were yellow
i definitely want a 2 part of this video
Every time I have an absolute terror of a day,  I can always rely on a Sidemen video to cheer me up.
I'm waiting for the sequel!
Really thought I was being clickbaited like last week's Sidemen Sunday golf video.
That intro tho :D
Team who can grow a beard vs team who can’t 😂😂😂
The Name for the robot gradually got worst until KSI hits "Ethan's Dad" Sigh lol
vikks kinda sick at this
They both look sick
Hmmmm.........Not bad !!
More of this. This can be an actual series.
44:01 'its lit, astro' ..
Is there a discount code for clothing?
Part 2 is needed!
Destroy build destroy but uk version
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES LETS GOOOOOO
Unbelievable
32:05 How tf did JJ know their robot was like that-
Simon was mad funny this video, his witty humor is underrated
Lets gooooo
Who honestly thought team golden daddy was gonna win?
That was amazing when both weapons broke 😂😂😂
The SIDES promo is the most comfortable & natural with his body language I have seem Vik in a long long time and that's so good to see. He's getting more & more comfortable in front of the camera! ❤️
I haven't watched so idk why won but when I first saw ksi killing robot I thought it was gonna lose but now I saw what it can do it's insane
wow
that welding job is vile
Yo Harry is jacked bro
Was simon actually worried about the hate? So he decided he doesn't want to drive the robot? He would have smashed this coz he is competitive, idk why he didn't try to drive the robot earlier instead of giving it to JJ
Ethan got left hanging by JJ 😭
The sidemen r banging out some awesome vids atm: tag, abandoned and this r sick
was there no discount code this video?
vikk is so annoying he just puts me in a bad mood i cant stand him at all
3:26 watch what that arm does Harold 😳😬
The actual battle in case ya'll are curious - 37:30
can we just take a sec and realise that the boys have their own fuckin vodka AND online restaurant now. from a group of friends making jokes on gta to now this. fuckin insane lads
Love to see Harry repping TGF
that was sickkkkkk broo
Who hurt Ethan at the start
Omg yesss
5 minutes of the fight really oh god REALLY sa roy keane noises
Nobody talking about the Uber eats collab at the start of the video...these boys makin boss moves 😎
Geeza sounds like James Acaster 😂
But Harry's team winn, broo the other robot is more dangerous🤣🤣🤣
Anyone from Colchester notice this was filmed in charter hall?
I’m just here for Tommy T
the 2 grps difference in their ideas on board is bonkers.......lol
Anyone know what this weeks discount code is?
What the golden daddy did the the washing machine. I expected it to demolish the tenderizer lol gg
“Darth Mail got chopped in half” Yh but he came back so suck it Chris 😂
Is Simon spaghetti
That’s the most white guy I’ve ever seen
I just realised that they went, "From the UK, to the UAE"   SideEats I mean
Is that a new member og sidemen?
Grass
Rematch When!?
When was this filmed
Elite sidemen sunday
Harry's reply to Ethan for the  takeaway commercial is the same enegery as Beetlejuice.
Is sideeats international?
That hit from Josh on the blade was amazing almost perfect timing I don't think they realized how good of a shot that was.
14:52 “Can it leap, like sperm?” I hate him lmaoooooo
Yes your were in Colchester
Part 2 pls
i remember them reacting to these, wanting to do it. Now they are
"When India and Guernsey combine....no one is safe" Very well said..👏👏
“Yh likewise bro”
WE SAW U LEAVE LMAOO
Watch out for the hair at top left 15:26
badass
Please more Robot Wars
Sidemen wont be getting sponsors for little tikes any time soon
If the z is cooler then why ain't it the zidemen
Bruv can anyone from UK please tell me what Ethan said at 1:00 😅
Best times were with Chaos 2 and Hypno disc :D
*calls it robot wars then uses almost all robots from Battlebots as inspiration*
Josh as always a genius . i love this man
Count how many times they say “like” in this video😂
I wish they ate the beast burgers 😋
I need that food now like right now
We need a part 2
Josh made them win
At my big age I never thought I'd enjoy watching grown ups build robots n compete against each other but this was acc sick loooooool😂😂😂😂
1:01
That intro reminded me of the sidemen show days
after seeing the egg blade rip through those appliances i thought it was a sure fire win... oh how i was wrong.
25.54 the cone weirdly moves bottom left
Best YouTuber squad in the game bro not even joking u deserve the 5 years of subscription and all ur subscribers well done Josh, JJ, Ethan, Harry, TOBI, Vikk and Simon  Edit: meant 5 years 😂
plsss do this again!!!!
Big up colchester
travis bot
That food add at the start is trash 🤣🤣
Just know they gonna do a eatsides mukband
those welds tho.. :P
that intro!!! 😯
Is that DanTDM's brother?
Damn now they have their own food company too
Its team beard vs team beardless
Bangerr
We need a 2nd video, this was too sickk😂
I saw this.. and said no way this is real
6:39 The escalation 💀
Simon not having the balls to drive but goes mad a JJ, hold that L
The fact fans sneaked in to this set
What a video 😭❤️ the sidemen are gods
That was so sick!!!
nooo i wanted to see more we only got like 3 good moments but still thats good enough
they should do faze clan vs the sidemen in robotwars
just to save your time, the actually fighting is like 8 minutes of the ending. waist of time just hearing vik hype himself up thinking his hammer worked and he actually did anything
Oh damn this wasn't filmed recently lol
Part 2??
PART 2 WE NEED PART 2
use the hammer to flip back up
"historically he wasnt a success story" idk why i laughed so hard when Chris said this lmao
We need a part 2
Yo what are those welds?!?! Looks like someone spread hot glue on it and painted it over😂
This notification popped up as I was watching robot wars
I bet thats one of the most expensive vid they made
Jonathan pierce would love watching this awesome robot wars
The ad in the begging was tv level
When was this video recorded?
They didn't say "3 2 1 Activate". Day ruined.
I restarted the video 3 times before I realized the beginning wasnt and ad lol
Content
The meat is there and they they beat the meat          ok....cooooooooooooooOOOOOoooooooOOOOOOOOOooooooool
I am glad Harry didn't throw the controller!
Part 2 part 2
U gotta love the Sunday dinner
Vik: I’m so bad at drawing Also Vik: Draws a robot machine  in a minute and is better than anything I’ve ever drawn
Josh and ethan was clutch with the front. The front saved them. The hammer was also clutch by Ethan instead of a pickaxe.
Why didn’t they think attaching a chainsaw to the front
Man like josh!
I knew Josh was gonna be boring when he drove….
Ladz I think we need more of these vidz like everyone has 50 kg robot 🤖 who wins gets £10,000 like so sdmn see this👍👍👍
Sidemen always going up a next level:  Sidemen clothing 👕 Side+ 🎬 Sidemen merch 🎒 Sidemen vodka 🍸 And now Sideman eats 🍔  What’s next sidemen kicks 👟 ???? Well done boys 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
They are pushing for an exit, mark my words, Sidemen as we know it wont be here within 1 year.
U Spelled Tenderiser wrong
of course jj went for chickin first hehe
I’ve just noticed how handsome Chris is
I thank whoever suggested to watch Robot Wars on Sidemen Reacts cause this is a banger!
"#1 on trending for *gaming*" Excuse me what?
Do they not know that tenderizer is already spelled with a Z lol
When it comes to robot all man are so excited😂
so they spoiled it because ethan was like if we lose cut that out
Your Best Video Ever!!!!!!!!!!!
JJ trying to use one hand on the remote is HILARIOUS🤣
Yes!!!
I like that it's actually a egg😂
Harry is so excited bless him😂😂
Tobi did nothing that whole vid personally dont think he belongs in the group he relys on the others to make the video good hes good at sports but thats about it
Wow tb to the 90s show
"And it beats the meat"😭😭😭😭😭
Anybody else notice that Vik's team was smashing little toys and Simon's team was literally destroying home appliances
This was like an epic boss fight
darth maul survived just so yall know
The beginning looks like a cooking video
I love how Harry is wearing childish merchandise
I’ve noticed that the sidemen Channel is a tv program. Every Sunday a new episode with the occasional special. Which is the reason I don’t pay for a tv license.
i think they should build 1 robot each and battle
Round 2????
sick content mannn!!!!!!!!!!!!
Babatunde would have suggested using some "WOTAH" to drench the other robot's motherboard.
When ethan said "WE ARE HERE FOR WAR" im fking fireing up
So funny how Harry's team is crushing little toys and then JJ's team is smashing huge home appliances loool 😭😭
Againnnn
Niceeeeee
Toby is captain fun sponge in almost every video
Josh's COD days gave him the finesse
Tobi is so lame “cut it” “cut it” like stfu
Bruhh they missed the opportunity to name it sidechick
Side+ , Sides What's next oh Sidemen
It felt gooood to see JJ lose :)
See the hammer go bamb! I knew the golden daddy was done for
rematch
Point lass
part 2 pls
Andys face is whiter than his teeth
omg! we need second part
Simon is so depressed
Can someone tell me what food was at the beginning. If not I’ll go frame by frame and find those ingredients.
Part 2?
10:10 the plan that made em win
This video was sickkk
40:57 Driving into the wall is what broke the egg blade
Kinda funny jj the first who went for the chicken
part 2
Man that was crazy!
GOD BLESS
we need more of this XDDD
The fact that they give washing machine to destroy to one team and plastic toys to second team is a violation
Has miniminters head got bigger?
12:40
If they called the robot “ethan’s dad” it would’ve first destroyed him emotionally which then will mess him up physically and they would’ve lost. Didn’t expect less from Knowledge SI.
It would be so cool if they design robot where it throw Petrol on other robot and spark fire....boommmm
This must've cost a lot speaking from experience. But please more of this🙏🏾
We need a part 2
The production on this channel 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
This is one of my favourite Sidemen Sundays in a while can’t lie
Watched robot wars for years. The Hammer NEVER was effective. Surprised they didn’t know.
This was epic we need another.
INSANE video
Dart mall did not die
boring video ngl i hate these type of videos
Finally ive been waiting for this
WE. NEED. MORE.
This video is a banger! 🔥
Me: sees those images of bots who was in battlebots
I like sidemen vids where they  gotta use their brains. It makes it funnier ngl
Vik the entire video : like Bang bang
This was so fun to watch!!!!
Boring accept the last 10 min  that’s as peak as it gets
is this the one that fans broke in??
Chris was a sick addition!!!🔥🔥🔥
42:44 is beautiful
the fact that it was clear that ethan's side was gonna win was clear, he said it in the video : cut this part if we lose
Harry's got good calves
at 13:52 vik looks animated
11:09
Part 2 please
Dunno how anyone likes Simon
Why was this more entertaining than Godzilla vs Kong
the way jj said SIKE is so funny
16:23
R.I.P the golden daddy
I think it would have been more awesome if they all had oneof their own
Simon is such a backseat driver hahah
FINALLY SOME GREAT CONTENT FROM THE SIDEMEN!!!
Kinda suck that the robots main attacks both broke
They do this but it’s like rocket league
Tobi do be cute tho 29:43
We love Chris.
Surely do this again, this was fun as hell to watch
Stop the video at 3:27
Definitely should have called it ‘The Goldfather’
Vik's team: discussing about rear side defence, angled scoops, spikey thing up front, tactics  Jj's team: *E G G*
Defo need to do another robot wars buy have a different builder for each team so the can have two robots each and have two rounds rather than just the one
Why does chris look like a black and white character
this was so sick love it 😎♥
Next video: SIDEMEN POLICE CHASE ESCAPE
42:48 Josh looks so happy 😁
Seeing them make a robot for robot wars makes me uber jealous. I practically know how i would make my robot
What trainers are Ethan wearing?
EXTREME ROBOT WARS PART 2
use me as a “we want a part 2” button
My man borrowed my thinkpad school pc
i feel like every hammer weapon at least in robot wars was rubbish aye- hypnodisc and razor, pussycats were the ones dishing out the major damage. sadly they didnt have any drum like weapons
whose idea is this robotwars? it's sick!
Id ask for my money back... poorly made robots. dead company
One of the best sidemen sundays yet
I watched 40 minutes of planning  waiting for the good stuff only to get 4 minutes of 2 robots driving around with each other because both robots broke as soon as they got touched
i was just about to do home work
Josh the Pilot.
Ofc the TAG TEAM VLC CHAMP Josher wins cahhmonnn💚🔥
I like how Ethan's group actually trying to make a robot. Meanwhile JJ: egg blade goes brrrrr
This was awesome.
24:44
Wait till they hear about Captain Shrederator. The literal circle with a few points
best video this year
Simon giving JJ crap for his driving at the end was pretty unfair - at least he had the balls to take the controls
do this again but with more teams this was honestly awesome. i was actually excited for the battle. I cant believe they pulled off the upset when i saw the goldne daddy destroy those appliances i had no hope for the other team
Epic episode gents!!!!
This video is sponderd by PEPSI 😅
Vikk + Josh is too OP 🔥 🤣
hey the expert guy listen it does not cost much to get your teeth cleaned by a dentist
Eyyyy i was waiting this ❤️
This is the 8.5k comment promise
Loved this video best one yet what annoyed me so much was the guy u was speaking to in the first bit of the video his teeth are yellow like sweetcorn
Can u guys make a robot wars but it's all every man for himself
Josh and bois: *got the full sketch and idea for the bot*  JJ and the bois: *e g g*
man said the boss robot has plaits😂 comin like his name shud be tyrone
Damn, sidemen never dissappoints
as a engineer, seeing this makes me happy knowing intrest in the subject it still being promoted :)
wow they actually did it i remember them mentioning a robot wars video in a react video
the real fight was kinda clapped
#48 trending on India
vik is too smart
Maybe they shouldnt have tried it on the appliances
Chris was so good in this video! Have him back
Am I the only one that think sideman channel video are getting boring.. I find sideman reacts more entertaining than the main channel video......(no hate personal opinion)...
there has to be a part 2 and more i enjoyed this too much
0:17 that was nice edit
YESSSS THEY DID IT
watched on sidemen reacts. They said they'd do it. They did it.
The control s look rubbish
Banger video.
Darth Maul didn't die after he was cut in half lol
It’s cool how the intro the three biggest in the group (most personal subs) run into the kitchen
war starts at 40.00. Thank me later
42:48 that laugh from Josh😂
6:20 i love how this video is about robot wars but they pulled up a photo of one of the most op robots in *battlebots*... (the rest of the photos I'm not really sure... might be from battlebots too but I only remember tombstone)
robot man sounds exactly like james acaster
What so I've waited a week for a video shorter than 46 minutes? 😂
Ethans road man voice is so annoying
When ksi laughed i did to i was wtf 😂
This bangssssssss. It’s a fun one!
the Moment Simon didnt want to drive is the Moment theyve lost
I would eat that
Surely the bring sidemen food to Perth Western Australia
Battlebots fan lets give it a like
This deserves so many more views!!
BANGER of a video!
Lets goo. Trending in India
21:06 sounds like funky town
AGAIN PLEASE
15:30 my favourite part is the guy making the robots encouraging the idea😭😭
The welding on them is dreadful
sui
No
This one was a banger congrats!!
I skipped most of the video, not my thing with the robots but i see why people liked it
Best Sidemen video in a long time!
Simon should've drove...
Who is the guy??
38:08 I’ve heard that before
Man the main fight was really underwhelming since both weapons stopped working
Simon literally made the smallest contribution then tells jj he stinks. Someone please humble him
We want more of this...
The fact that Harry’s hoodie says “childish” is so funny
4:50 he loves lines that boy
11:35 yeah u could place some racial slur on it u guess
We need a sequel for this immediately
JJ overpowered sperm technology 😂 fking hell.. atleast that would have worked 😂...this vid was a banger 🔥
Still waiting for Tinder in Real Life w/aitch
Rematch plsss
They should do this again, same teams, but also a beta squad team and a YouTube team with lux, freezy, Randolph and Stephen tries. Would be a legendary tournament.
Part2?
Ay this video was bangin
as soon as they tanked the spinner hits it was all over
That was absolutely sick!
Really enjoyed the video hope fully there will be other Parts where they build individually....
Almost at 14 mil subscribers 🙌
Absolute Banger
Vic woke up and chose violence
Yea right,waiting for part 2.
A video that took 3 months  to make....     Big Ups the Sidemen
To be honest I kinda wish i could see what the big hammer could do at full strength its probably like 10 times stronger than the tenderizers one
Chris telling JJ he can stop being bad for the camera looool
I really love that we want part 2 plssss👇
MrBeast vs Sidemen (Restaurants edition)
welcome back to the sellout sidemen
i would love to see another one of these
COOL we want this one more time
THIS WAS INASNEEEEE, We definitely need a rematch\ part 2
This is a absolute banger 🔥
Sidemen Goated Forever
VIKKSTAR
For Star Wars fans darth mall didn’t die until late in the clone wars series because when grabbed onto a vent in the whole he fell down then got metal legs
The guys use medieval weapons and some weird tactics/strategies  on the robots. I'm just gonna put a glock or a rocket launcher  on the robot it will do the job wonderfully.
They Need to make this annual
This needs to be done again
JJ was so into this, usually he just sleeps. lmao
Sidemen are just unreal right now.   Best channel on youtube, not even close.
They need to do a sidemen Sunday like the one where they spent 100,000 dollars on each other, but on each other's girlfriends and the girlfriends react to the gifts in the end
The coolest video the Sidemen have ever done.
They defo need a rematch 😂😂
I'm lovin this Ethan and Vik content, don't really see much of their friendship
the diffrence between drawings tho HAHAH
For the millions of people on the sidemen channel and the millions around the world  LETSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS GET READY TO ROBOT RUMBLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
We need part 2
Vikks team mashing toys whilst jjs mashing washing machines
That was an amazing sidemen sunday👌one of my favourites. Would love to see another one day
Part 2 please!!? It has to happen
poggers
Lets goooooo Josh
this was my dream after i watched big hero 6
As a robot fighter myself, in that very arena XD, Golden daddy could have won if they hit Tenderizer's sides and took the wheel out XD oh rip but im soo happy this video is up.
this video gives me “the sidemen show” vibes
this should be a yearly thing at minimum
@0:20Vik walking in like a champ
that guy teath is yellow
could u please do a part 2 for this. this was sick
Need another version of this😍
The quality of their last 2 videos is INSANE, these boys have stepped up so much and I dont think any of us expected it - their own food partnership and alcohol? So unique I love these boys and im really excited for what else they show
say this every time but  this one aye this time ,its the sickest damn what a video ,absolute savage
#1 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
me clicking the video  Sidemen bullying me with their food flex
ABSOLUTE BANGER!!!!!
I beg side+ shows some of the 2 months of the robot building process, since that'd be pretty interesting
before i watch i bet there is a Roomba involved.  Never mind i was very wrong as i can tell from the intro
WE NEED A REMATCH! THIS WAS FANTASTIC
tobi being so concerned with the blades on the tv is so cute omg
Total banger
I want a part 2
Okay just a few minutes and and video production quality is amazing
Giving controller in the JJ's hand is the worst mistake they can do😂
i hate how disrespectful the sidemen were about controlling the robot, the guy spent 2 months making the robots for then to talk bad about the robot
get some manners
I haven’t even watched this yet and I’m soo exited this guy mana be fire
I thought the sidemen were way dumber than this. good f'ing jobs my g's
I want Tobi Brown do ideas for the team Chris OOJJKSI Simon ! ?
9:52 I mean Simon is right, he didn’t die.
teeth...
WE NEED A PART 2
Chris MD sold that so hard
Vikk and josh are basically 2 advanced AIs working together
QUALITYY
The designer sounds exactly like James acaster
WHAT A BANGER, brought back those good old days of watching robots demolish each other
The best video on 2021🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Didn’t know vik could draw so well
20:30 nice
#2 for gaming lol
Wow
Great, I’m bare hungry now
JJ is preparing for fatherhood
Someone needs to learn how to weld
Honestly I didnot realize that the robots were that big until JJ's washing machine was next to it.
When I saw that the Tenderizer had a wedge, I knew Golden Daddy was done. It didn't matter what primary weapon Tendy would have, wedge > horizontal blade.
Hope we get to see more of this! This was awesome.
Team Tenderizer  actually created a very sick design and  creative weapons system. Totally munched the egg bot
This proves that not only your robot needed to be stronger , it should have some planning and design also
Easily the best Sidemen Sunday ever🥰
nerd with the yellow gashers
is this the actual ring from the show?!
only ogs know josh was insane on the sticks
Need a part 2 to this!
now that was a banger, do more of robot wars. Maybe with more kg's
Man like Tommyyy T the getaway driverr
why is no one gassed about SDMN FRIED CHICKEN!!
This is a dream
so one smashed up plastic and the other tore metal apart, mmmm....
the second hand embarrassment following that fist to handshake interaction in the first few minutes 😅
OMG I LIKE THIS GAMMMMEEEESSSS AHHHHHHHHH!
I love the robot series this sidemen videos is fucken amazing
why didn't simon control the robot after chris, he could've won the match if he tried
R i p golden daddy 😔😔😔
This was another great one I forgot about robot wars!! I like when ya bring back old tv shows
43:08 Ethan deserves his handshake :(
I would've gone with Golden Gilder
They really had me hungry for food at the first minute into the episode
Sidemen Take Me Out?
Mad video
is it just me or did anyone else get 3 roomba ads whilst watching this
These guys never fail to bring out entertaining original content
this might just be the best sidemen video i have ever watched
Having Vikk on your team is just a W, the guy is a mastermind🤣😂
Bro why is Tobi yelling at Chris to stop like let him have his fun it’s literally what it was meant to be for. This man just proves how boring he is more and more every video
Sidemen what is this?
I got so hungry from that intro
The tendorizer tendonrised the golden daddy
Ethan's team is more organised. Everyone is able to input their ideas whereas JJ's team was just nodding and agreeing to everything he suggests despite having the biggest fan of robot wars in ChrisMD.
I can’t explain how fast my would left my body , when Harry messed up at 0:59 💀
Team Vikk: *Seriously planning* Ksi: EGG BOT
1 Team just got a robot  The other team at least created an own idea
That was so much fun!!!
awesome
Damn. The Tommy t in josh came out in this sideman Sunday

Please call the chicken, SIDECHICKS
I have spotted that Simon is growing a beard
Vik and co destroying toys, JJ taking on the whole kitchen
This video gonna blow up in the future.
Outro is hard btw
As soon as I saw KSI’s team’s robot I knew it was getting mashed 😂
I need a part 2 of this
sidemen vids are banging lately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_1wWqbL5o
What a video 🔥🔥
AYO can I get Sides on Uber eats from Australia? Can they deliver that far? 😂😭😭
Part 2 please?!!
2.5 mil in less than a day 😮‍💨
Never thought I'd enjoy grown men playing with cars
Remember, we couldn't get a proper end to the video due to the "fans" that broke into the set. Absolute wastemen the lot of them.
I love how Vicks team is breaking plastic while Toby’s team are breaking washing machines 😂
I think the robot guys is the one with the bad breath that jj was talking about in the last video 😂😂😂
looks like both teams messed up their weapons while testing them
39:49
That Pepsi sponsor tho
That video was fuckin awesome 😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV90GtzDT6I
Some one needs some welding lessions haha
Good idea trap them in a giant spunk bubble
I think we all want to see sidemen helium challenge ? Don't we ??
15 hour ago video
I had next to no faith but holy God it worked
13:50 Zidemen
This Video is treading at 44 for Gaming in India
I thought they were going to do a pickaxe type weapon instead of a hammer.
Everytime JJ is planning something its All Over The Place
we need a part two
12:50
This was a little stale,  but not bad.
28:19 Vikkstar Schwarzenegger
28:
Make this a series🔥🔥
37:40  Everyone: gassed Tobi: mum i shitted the bed
Cheers to Ethan for bringing so much energy to this shoot
Finally  KSI loses sonething
Someone PLEASE tell me if they are still selling that pastel hoodie???? I can’t find it on SidemenClothing 😭😭😭
2:10 Why is Harry so weird
Darth maul didn't die he came back to be the best character in the franchise
This is probally the most boring sidemen sunday ever guys
HARRY? YOUR FINALLY WITH ME 3:28
Amaizing make a part 2 next year it was sick
Lets give some love to the team who actually made the robot cos they did a really good job
this is y u dont give toddler killer robots
Yesss! I have been waiting for this video for ages finally it’s here
gggoooood video
Fun Fact: Darth Maul is still alive after he gets cut in half.
Only sidemen can make eating look awesome 😎
When was this vid recorded??? I think making the robot would take a lot of time
Honestly they should have not use the hammer until their blade stops.
This was one of the best videos in a while, would love to see some extra versions of this one. 4 teams in a tournament
The way that guy makes Chrismd look less white then he is😂😂😂
42:47 JOSH jumping like that was so wholesome😂❤️
12:35 Tommy T out hear popping tiers.
manz got dreadz
Vikk really did saved them with scoop the idea of scoop angles or their robot would have been finished with only one blow from other team's robot. Also he sounded so passionate about designing the robot it felt so refreshing and cool. Also credit to big zerka for the perfect pilot
Just looking at the teams planning and designing their robot , u knew Vik’s team was winning
Vikk's plan from the start was HUGE.
this is a BANGER of a video ngl
Absolutely SICK 🔥
Josh played so sick, not showing their vulnerable side and controlling the beast The Egg Blade was so sturdy and the blade was deadly than Tenderizer and strong, but the design on front of the Tenderizer was just big brains by Vik
I like the fact the got to destroy plastic and then they destroy a washing machine
Sidemen Making ads we can't skiiiip lol
Hey
Idk what's worse for JJ, Simon, Tobi and Chris's team, being thrown by the robot or giving JJ the controls?
That other robot looked like JJ.
this is lit
at 44:12 the fans broke in the place thats why they put a cut on the video, fan footage here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCbPyaJuaAs&ab_channel=CelebrityDrama
Missed the Red team, Red team chant. 🙃
never have i ever seen such yellow teeth
Am loving every moment harry and jj are close ...
big up the robot guy
cringe ad tbh
Seeing harry wearing a watch is weird
Once more
It was a banger, once more!!
Do it again
Once more
Give us more
Make it a series please
Yall remember the movie Reel Steel? yeah we're not far from that now.
We want More of these.
SIDEMEEN TINDER!!!!!!!
I would loooooove to see another robot wars video
Wow very cool
Man Josh was amazing with the controls. And Vik, Ethan and Harry organized their ideas and come up with The Tenderizer. Their planning was really good and effective.
Definitely need some type of part 2 in the future. sick video
Give them controllers (from Xbox or play station) n u will see them destroy everything 😂😂
The contrast between the two teams though @42:57 - 43:05
Boys theres no need for the overuse of extreme
4:51 Josh wanted to make a joke about lines I can just tell
Have to make another one of these videos They're 🔥🔥
tobi yelling stop, the dude is so dead man
1:28  Did anyone else think that was dantdm or is it just me?
Please bring back the christmas rap battle.
Who wants to see the Sidemen do a painting challenge where they have to paint each other?
They spelt Tenderizer wrong......
this was so fun to watch
Since when did Gareth Bale build robots ?
Ethan and Viks team surprised them can destroy plastic jj and Simons team incinerating metal🤣🤣
next up we have Atom and Twin Cities ready to fight each other
Harry is wearing tgf childish merch
11:21 one of Ethans favourite exercises...
part 2
That thumbnail though
I have no idea why he gave JJ the controller 😂
Cannon: darth maul lived and was low key always the good guy video on my channel 😂
Need a part two
32:08
Make a another one like this again
That lose was anti climatic to say the least.. wasn't it?
Sidemen - the apprentice video would bang. 2 teams, 2 ideas, selling to the general public, trying to make the most profit. Boardroom etc.
Golden Daddy looks a lot like Blue Flame
44:01 tenderizer becoming tandoorizer
Josh is OP
JOSH WAS DIRTY ON THE STICKS BRUV
What was that cringe at the start
#BEST
I am so hungry
Love your videos
As a long time Robot Wars fan, this was EPIC!!!
We need a part 2
Jesus . This is legit content on GOD Level.
Josh on the sticks is a guaranteed W Banger vid!!!!
What’s the discount code
should've called it allow it jr.
@3:27 Harry getting a little dangerous
I bet Ethan's dad never knew his son will one be a sideman and they will mock his absence eternally.
We definitely need part 2
I bet Ethan's dad never knew his son will one day meet KSI
do it again
45 min vid to see just 4 mins of an actual fight not impressed
Oi big up the lad who made them. Dudes a king in disguise
why is vikk and josh on the same team lmao
the spinning blade was likely to big and heavy.
yo sick sidemen video boys that tenderizer was a awesome robot it was glad there team ended up winning 👍👍👌👌
Why have Chris md on here his like a grand dad proper cringe his defo a virgin ruined the video with him in it if u guys make a video on how to be a librarian then get him in perfect other then that nah
Thanks!
lmao thought that was gonna be phil at the start as the chef
big hero 6 lmao
We want part 2❤️❤️❤️
I think the reason why the blade broke was because they were smashing up everything with it.
I love that vikk is still part of the white shoe gang 😬😂
My man is so awkward 😂
That hammer hit from Josh directly to the blade was super clutch. I think that won them the match
chris had a good point but was missing the knowledge. darth maul didn’t die when he got cut in half
KSI's ideas best
The best intro so far
Andys got the best job in the world
Waiting on a sidemen takeshis castle
They deserved the win, couz jj team didnt do sh!t lol, josh team really created their own thing
Vikk right at home here. Nerd
X
His teeth tho!?
Ksi missed out on the chance of calling their robot,  The Gold Father
the blades and hammer was a bit anticlimactic
Dislike
15:00
AMAZING VID❤❤
team vik OP
Should've done "Sidemen Bamzooki" before this for the old CBBC viewers 😂
Pls make more of this
Who put this guy in a light room. He is just hair and a shirt ffs
lorte video'
This was sick 🔥
Another great vs terrible vacation?
AYO this was sickkkk. give us more......
The robot guy gotta brush his teeth...
Darth Maul did survive btw, and died to Kenobi before episode 4 on Tatooine
This was actually so sick. The reactions when they put them in the pit
Not gonna lie when i saw "the tenderizer" going against childrens toys and the "golden daddy" going against appliances i literally thought the tenderizer was done for lmaoo. i'm so surprised but this was a great video!
Josh's driving was fantastic
The harmonisation at 32:26 🤩
W videoooo
5:46 should everyone be worried about ethan…….
I usually love sidemen Sundays, but I only liked the end part of this video. The planing was kinda dry.
Yes Z is cooler than S
Definitely make a part 2
OMG THIS IS SICKKK
they should've named the eggblade the eggsecutor
Funny thing is, Maul didn’t die
1:18 feeling like a GTA heist cutscene, especially JJ walking in
The sickest sidemen Sunday in a minute
who remembers when they had the idea for this vid in a sidemen reacts
Best sunday ever
All that GTA v driving went into use
Y’all should do a part 2
32:11 what is that noise 😆😆😆😆😆
Banger
The planning >>> Big up Vikk. Also what a driving Josh!
Tobi is such a baby, always ruining the fun
class video
I like how is simon flexing of chris md for bullying jj in the driving test 👏
The start really miss lead me
Major damage looks like travis scott smh
I loved the video I just wished we had seen a little of the building process
Anyone see those welds @17:30
The fight had everything! The two weapons cancelling each other out, the house robot being involved, josh actually pushing them into the pit!
All that gta driving coming in clutch for Josh
JJ was actually smart to say theirs should look like the one with 2 wheels and the large spinner in the front because that is called tombstone arguably one of the best bots of all time
Wow viks triangular slope suggestion actually worked against that blade lol
Will be waiting for part 2!
Sidemen with the eatside. Damnn. The grind we want to have one day.
Make it an annual thing
harry can barely drive a car in gta i cant imagine him driving the robot lmao
The egg blades controls went backwards because the robot got flipped on the other side. So forward is now backwards and left and right is right and left.
Legends
I wanna see a sidemen Sunday fear factor
how is this 1#trending on gaming
حلو
Ssnsj
Who saw Ethan V2.0 controlling the robot?
did anyone else hear the noise ksi made at 32:10
This was amazing, love to see variety in the content 👌👍❤️ and both the robots were so freakin cool, great work by the builders/designers
Well that's a bit anti climactic
My Australia fans we get this on Monday
Need part 2
This should be the knew way YouTubers settle the beef 👀
I was so nervous that I spoiled myself the ending in the comments, sad I did it :/
This episode was a banger, I LOVED Robot Wars. Whoever had this idea is a G
That final robot fight scene might be one of the most rewatchable parts in Sidemen history, I just watched this whole video half an hour ago and I’m back again for that scene
this vid is sick
Is there discount code for this week?
We need a part 2 of this!!!!!
the thing for me about these robot wars is that it takes too long to built, and then destroyed in a few or more minutes later
The food in the intro made me so Hungry man. It looked so good
so sad that it took 40 mins to get to the robots then 1 min for them both to break
Please now a Beyblade
Watching grown men play with their toys has never been more fun and interesting! Ahhh Classic!!
I don't like when the actual professionals are involved because the boys don't have the same banter, it feels too mainstream and loses its youtube  charm
How much would it cost the sidemen to get one of these
I'll just use a powerful magnet on mine
Vik really came with Will from the inbetweeners vibe in this vid 😂
If Simon would have controlled the robot instead of Chris they might have actually won. Chris was a terrible driver.
Who remembers when Harry thought of this idea during a Sidemen Reacts video?
Darth Maul who actually survived      👀
The sidemen are levels man .
the tenderizer looked sick, and josh did really well driving, but I gotta say the golden egg boi was badass in the testing
Man that food intro 🤤🤤🤤
Trending on gaming let’s go
men
35:35 i love how KSI  reacted to his own robot to make their reaction louder lololol
Next up: Rocket League in real life giant football + a car each
This must be a joke , sidemen got there own food brand coming these guys just keep being successful
Josh is op
We need more of this and they gonna make their own robot
They always do the most creative things. Loved this
I love how Bhez, Vik, Josh and Harry are planning a war whereas JJ, Simon, Chris MD and Tobi are worried about there "Egg Blade"
vikks robot had plastic toys to destroy, while JJs robot had steel to destroy....................this shows the end result!
.
Can we get a part 2
I swear sidemen videos are just getting more boring every week 🙄
maybe this is the best sidemen sunday video ever!
What’s funny is vikks team practicing with toys and jjs team practicing with TVs and washing machines 💀
That intro is highkey soo class! 🔥
imagine they had the budget to make one robot each
looks like this is going to be most views video on sidemen
Ethan is never safe from the Dad jokes lmao
Scrapping the bottom of the barrel for video ideas at this point
ॐॐॐ
That was epic
I've finished through half the video and seen both their robots. I'm putting my bet on Ethan vik Chris MD and w2s team fromm the looks and the hammer and everything. Lets see.
I wish they let Simon drive. He was basically on par with josh.
I d love to see a rematch , love the emotions this episode has brought from them and it was one of the most exciting episodes in a while.
This was actually such an entertaining sidemen sunday 🔥🤝 also big up the people that built the robots based on what the sidemen said 😂
Sidemen mukbang?
It pisses me off how demotivating and stupid Jj was
If Chris went from behind the hammer when it was loaded, they would have destroyed the other team but it stopped spinning...🧐
Anyone notice the plaque on that dude’s teeth man that’s Grimey as hell
Lol the weapons broke 1 minute in
we need 1 more part of this........
Mainmen
Its funny how Team golden daddy got washing machines, TVs and even microwaves whereas team tenderizer got children's toys
Big BANGER.
Love the content but i fucken hate the previews at the beginning. I dont need dumbass  spoilers because I am about to watch the ENTIRE video anyways! FFS😂
9:59 fun fact Darth Maul survived until Obiwan Keniobi become a old man, and his legacy ended in the last season of Star Wars Rebels
W with chrismd
For real, if the hammer and blade didn't broke, blade would've definitely won
Where is the build process
Am I the only one watching this at 6am
need round 2, three bots, add calfreezy and callux, different teams
Josh is used to driving on gta😂
42:55 im dead tobi violates ksi lolol
6:47 that one there was a violation
Do they get to keep the bots
Lmao the teams are polar opposites
Vikk>Ole
They actually did it like they said they would with tobi
Since JJ is like 5”6 Chris must be 5”
3:28 Harry u good?
Team egg blade
Darth Maul didn't die at that point
The intro made me so hungry
The thumbnails are way too overhyped 😂
Like if Sidemen should do one with multiple machines. Maybe teams of 2 or a machine each! Could get other features in too
THIS IS SICKKKKK
Everyone gangsta until pekka comes out!
hey make this a series
To be fair though..
YouTube channel opening a fast food company, where have I heard this from?
Intro made me so hungry
Yooooo Sidemen's Going so sick these days
Did anyone think that the opening was scene was for Chef Ramsey finally doing Sidemen Sunday??
Sick video idea! It sucked that the robots weapons broke very quickly and it became more of a driving battle but that was not in their control so fair play.
Harry really autismed that test drive 😂
KINGG JOSHHHHH
This vid absolute fire
damn. . . . . . jj so bad xD

Ay josh my getaway driver
I hope sidemen clothing or other business can go worldwide, i wish i can order some sidemen clothing or that fried chicken in the Philippines y'know.
Gotta do a part 2 boys!
We need a part 2
Good job it's not a race 😅
Bout to nerd out, but Tombstone is the best robot ever. that is all.
Me at Mexico crying about not having the chance any time soon of trying sidmen food 😂💔
What a rollercoaster!
I was thinking the same as KSI "Ethan's dad"
6:48 that was mad from Chris bro 🤣🤣🤣🤣
We need a roast of the sideman part 2!!!
Bruh how is this gaming?
My favourite video
The. Sidemen. Never. Disappoint.
I was waiting for this from a long time boisssss🔥🔥
2013:SIDEMEN channel Few years later: SIDEMEN Clothing 2021: XIX VODKA Again 2021: EatSides 2023: Sidephone 2027: Sidecar 2030 : Sideplane 2040: Siderocket I wonder what they are upto
at the poinr when ksi was presenting  and vik was presenting, the results were already decided
Part 2 needed immediately 💥
Damn this is sick
This was awesome
If the egg blade stayed working, I bet they would of won
i think that they should have gave the most chaotic person in the group fight
sidemen sponsored pro robotwars team?
Can’t deny it, the sidemen are killing it
This is basically just British Battle Bots 😂
“Why have the British military not got this?” 😂😂
43:07 the way ethan just held his hand was hilarious.
Tobi was so concerned and then goes  “Yea get the microwave. That things got off easy” hahahah
This is a banger
Harry and Vik’s “Oh” when they saw the golden daddy has me dying 😭😂
Love to see Chris in these videos!
Ethan sounding like R2-D2 at minute 19:43
He went all out on the chicken bro
JJ's battle bot concept is just a roomba with a sawblade
of course they make it so JJ smells the chicken
BANGER!
Bad driver good robot vs good driver bad robot That was sick
I love the sidemen but sometimes Simon takes things to seriously
WAIT IS JOSH LEFT HANDED?
Tenderizer is spelled with a z isn’t it?
true underdog story
Favorite sidemen video
Sidemens production is crazy, it’s like the one for the sidemen show  But it’s weekly vids
Who else remembers when sidemen had less than a mil?
This was so sick!
chris md is the best
Best Sidemen Sunday so far🏆🔥
Who remembers that lab rats episode
I was expecting the hammer to break easily but not the blade josh team had the ramp to back the hammer breaking
9:57 clone wars show he comes back
josh and harry knew straight away they had no chance
The contrast between the two teams is hilarious😂. Vikk and ethan planning  like professionals and then there is JJ with EggBlade🤣🤣
I watched a 40 minute video for the hammer to break in 5 seconds and the blaze stops spinning in 10 seconds into the fight... now that's content !
i thought i'd clicked on the wrong sidemen video at the start cos of the food!
15:00
Team Tenderizer: excited that they crushed plastic  Meanwhile, Team Golden Daddy shredding through metal
When are they gonna be doing squid game common boys!
I have NEVER seen a food advert more dramatic than THAT!!!
the intro acting is more fake than the sidemen shows acting     PLS TAKE THIS AS A JOKE
Lol they filmed the first part in summer and the fighting part in winter
This video was Hella underwhelming idk why people gassed it up so much. Nothing happened. Tobi and Chris were mad dead this video
#5 trending for "Gaming" lmao 39:57 for the actual robot fight
Sidemen copying MrBeast with the food I see….they’re gonna end up pulling themselves too many ways….already are
simon is so whiney all the time. what a sore loser lol  while tobi is shkaing their hands
No one does it like the sidemen wow
Bro i need a Part 2
0:58 simon (i think) said something about this on the sidecast😂 that’s jokes
this was so sick .
That food looked way too good
Hello. i like watching all of u guys, but it will be much better if u guys able to put caption/subtitles in the video. english not my first language so sometimes I miss the meaning of chat. in other hand, ur video is entertaining and great production, keep it up.
⬇️⬇️ https://youtu.be/UTapeU7tmpY
Eatsides vs beast burger Finally a legendary battle
This was one of the sickest things. Maybe one day we can get flying drone battles hogwarts style lol.
This is number 1 trending for gaming 😂
oyyy this is sickkkk video
Another Title :-  Team Beard vs Team No-Beard
Tobi was mad annoying this video telling them to turn it off
Gold Daddy lost because they never deployed the sperm.
I hope the food available in America
Genuinely great video
make this annual
I'm guessing this might be Ethan's video idea because judging from "Behzinga" he's a tbbt fan and they have a robot war in it...
I wanted this video for so long ☺☺
This video should have came out earlier because in my school in Engeneeiring class we are building amour own robot and doing a fight a single robot is worth over few thousands
imagine gving them the normal xbox or ps4 controller to control
A good video idea sidemen should make a part 2 Sidemen vs Beta Squad?
Harry and ethan celebrating at the end was honestly pure joy for me and i died laughing
another banger.
The tenderizer wins. everyone makes fun of chris. tobi shakes the other teams hands. what a guy
Will the site restock due to the sale? The hoodies are like out already especially the blue white and light blue hoodie
Need at part 2
part 2
Now why in the fuk did they give the control to jj 😂😂💀💀💀💀 of course y’all are gonna lose
THE TENDERIZER ENTERS JJ - "your dead. your finished." Tobi -  "That looks sick tho"
We need more of this!!
We want more of this vids.....🙌🙌🙌🙌
They should do a rematch
Vikk woke up and chose violence
use me as "we want a round 2 button"
https://youtu.be/1j8cMj_6-2k.  3:19 where jj originally got the spinning disc idea from THE DAY THEY DECIDED TO MAKE A ROBOT WARS VIDEO
2:35 Josh 💀😂😂
Thrilled that Chris is in a sidemen video
ksi's egg looked/ like his forehead.
Only real ones remember when they were reacting to most strongest robots from robot wars and harry suggested that they should do it on the main channel
red team with a special guest
Yo this video is sick!
Nice
I’ll help clear this up. Darth Maul survived.
I still think a pickaxe would be more critical, but they killed our boi with this weak arm..
JJ's team gets actual electronic appliances to destroy while Vikk's team gets children's toy 💀 Outrageous
They should definitely make a 2nd version with new robots
This? This is trending #1 on Gaming? Hooooooow???????
Who else skipped to the robot fighting part
Best getaway driver
I’ve been watching battle bots for a long time and I’ve learned how truly useless hammers are so every time they mention a hammer it hurts me
One team's drawing and planning and thinking things through Meanwhile ksi's team: Behold, a circle.
This is so sick 🥲🥺
That was so fuckin entertaining I never thought it would’ve been so good
Viks team: *Design every aspect of the robot and plan every minute of the fight* JJ's team: eggblade
Vik and Josh's team was so thoughtful and well planned.. give credit where its due
The results is expected
Kinda feel bad for chrismd... 🤣

Definitely do this type of stuff again, the soccer videos are a little repetitive. But either way I'll watch lol
This was so awesome! Hope ya'll do it again sometime and try some different designs
W Pepsi sponsor
❤❤
30 seconds in the weapons on both fail 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son Jesus to die for us and our sins on a cross and was buried in a cave and Rose 3 days later so whoever believes and confesses with their mouth shall not perish but have everlasting life in Heaven.
Would love a part 2 this was sick !!
I love this so much
Never knew I wanted to see sidemen go war with robots but this is amazing 😂
#5 for gaming ?
Who tf did the welding on those things 🤢
only harry can make an ad about sides better
28:40 like a profesinal mover
Please do something like this again please
go for beyblade war
sidemen love the word extreme lol
Vikk:bang😂😂
Josh " Rahtid " haha made the whole video 🤣 😂 😆
If simon drove that they would have won
this video = massive W
Josh deserves so much more respect!!! What a man
This was the best idea ever! Im just disappointed the spinner stopped
I love how everyone is saying vik's team and ksi team in cmnts
sooo coollllll
Yo please do this again this is sick
2020 sideeats 2055 siderocket
Nothing like a Sidemen Sunday to cheer me up from a loss in a soccer tournament
I JUST WANNA KNOW IF ITS COMING TO AUSTRALIA
I think jj's team would've done better if they actually knew how to drive
JJ's team: Breaking machines Vikk's team: literally enjoying toys
I hate tobi. So soft
38:30 Didn't knew Travis Scott started to work in Robot wars after that  astroworld disaster
Triple stuffed oreo
Think we need a new sidemen holiday or road trip or bingo
"We didn't see the light fade from his eyes.."   Ohhh yeah we did. Just wayyyy later in the animated versions. XD
We want part 2 with new robots and same teams
Do a part 2
Vik's team - we should add a two sided hammer, flipper, spikes  JJ's team - "sperm"
Vikk: Uses the white board to plot a plan.  Other team: Gassed about how their robot looks and name it the golden daddy.
If I remember correctly Darth maul didn't actually die
Best sidemen Sunday in a wile... bravo
bruhhh all that just for the both weapons to stop working ffs we need a rematch
Tommy T on the sticks
Part 2 pls 😭😭
They missed the perfect opportunity to call it “The Meat Beater”
Toby mad annoying
Any Fellow Welders cringing at the welding job? Lol
What's with the outro ad going so hard jeeeez
Travis Scott robot
I gotta say, Vikk looks hella good in blue jeans, Never seen him wear those befoer. Rate the drip. SICK video bois.
How’s Simon complaining his team lost when he didn’t even take control and let Chris pass it to JJ😂
I like how they’re just bullying the wheelbarrow
This was the most thrilling sidemen video i ever watched.
Like the robots
We need another
Damn if only the weapons didnt break first 😭
BEST ONE EVER!!!!!
Can’t wait for a part 2
The sidemen always makes our day better
As always amazing
https://youtu.be/_bPkU-CaVC4
legit chris needs to be in the sidemen he fits in so well
that big boss robot looks like lil yachty
This is honestly one of the most exciting Sidemen Videos our there, can’t wait for more videos like this Guys!!!
I still remember the video about the best robots on their reaction channel and everyone in the comments hoping that they would try this theirselves
in ap physics rn an that interia is part is funny asf
josh is too good mate.
3:27 Harry Moving Mad
Best sidemen Sunday in a long time, had me hyped!
It’s funny how KSI knows Darth Maul here but didn’t know Millenium Falcon in Sidemen 100 vs 1 😂😂
i mean… darth maul did survive getting cut in half…
JJ just drew the Egg Blade to promote his album What a legend 😂
The Tenderizer reminded me of a horseshoe crab
defo not inertia AHAHAHAH
this is the most entertained I've ever been by a Sidemen Sunday
I did not expect the robots to be that awesome 😂
As usual, JJ playing like BabaTunde and ensuring THE LOSE
bro I was smiling the whole way through this  absolute banger
They should have called it the meat beater
The fact that the TikToks didn’t ruin this video makes it so much better. Being dragged back to my childhood through this video🙌🏼
Robot man sounds like James Acaster
I love sidemen
THE TENDERIZER SHIRTS please!!!!! Mecha Champs!!!
I loved Robot wars growin up
I was always rooting for tenderizer, even when your hammer broke
Banger!
this was amazing
They really went from reacting to robot wars on sidemenreacts 4 months ago to actually having a robot war on sidemen channel 🙌🙌🙌
Is Sides halal tho?
Vic:will paint it jet black and will splash red p Harry:blood  Vic:paint ...  🤣🤣
THIS IS SICK!!
Danny Duncan
C'mon... we gotta have a part 2!!!
I thought they would mention the fans breaking into the shoot
as a welder i would like to know who welded those absolute POS welds
Or course jj is the one to smell the food
I was so excited and thought the spinner would be legit and then it easily broke and the game just finished at that point
hi
side chix noice
ii just noticed that ive actually never not watched a sidemen sunday vid even if its boring
Tbh If Simon Control the Bot they will win honestly
They could've won if the robot came everywhere
So do y’all know that c02 knife I would put something like that so it can slide under the other robot and when it’s ready it just exsplodes
Vikk looks good wid the glasses Just agree wid me
That, was, AMAZING 👌
Nothing but love for the sidemen but this is a moresidemen kinda vid
KSI and SIMON makes it more funny 💥😂
Why tobi want it to stop lmfao bruh your behind bullet proof glass
it must be fun designing a robot with Slowthai
From clothing to vodka to food sidemen are definitely going places
imagine spoiling star wars
Part 2 is a MUST
Chris is underatedly Funny
Damn Toby did my guy dirty at 37:52😂
It's an amazing video but the robots could be better, the meat hammer is abit flimsy and the blade is basically blunt
Awesome video perfect length Chris wasn't as present as other guest but we love to see him what a laddd. Defo need to do it again.
0:11 wtf
Josh is so boring
cool
Banging video. Soon as jj got the controller I knew it was a L
The fact that the robot guys build exactly what they wanted is legendary
6:15
This was sick! 🔥🔥🔥
Simon is such a coward, he gives the controller to jj even though they know he’s not good and then proceeds to yell at him and blame him. He just does my head in
Bruth they were crushing a washing machine and there was destroying plastic toy
yo are those hodies tobi and ethan wearing available to buy? they look cooold!!
The tenderizer was kind of an original idea. JJ's team basically copied and had a better robot overall as well.
Lab rats anyone?
mans is so white🤣🤣
26:39 simon was so nice for this
6:45 that has to be the best joke of this video lol
Can't believe they did this... Robot wars are so sick man.. My childhood grew watching those robots
This video was amazing!
no no. i want to see 7 sidemen robots fight not the big ones but the small once like crash gear ya know
This was one of the best episodes. Awesome battle
Anyone see JJ completely ignoring Vik on the handshake🤕🤕🤕
That was actually dope!!!
They should do it again but they have a robot each and fight in a tornament for money or somthing.
When indian in their team nothing can against them
+1 , οποίος είναι από Ελλάδα και γουστάρει sidemen
Glory glory Tottenham hotspurs
Love this hope they do another one honestly 😭
It's On Trending In India ❤️
Why did the chef in the advert look like gundogan
I was hoping one would shoot fire
part 2
can confirm darth maul did not die
We need a sequel to this ASAP!
11:37 when vik said he wanted the robot to be more offensive i thought he want the robot to sa some racial slur or something and I'm like DN VIK 😂
I wanted them to win 🏆 yesssss was a mad vid
This was sick af never thought of this I loved it keep doin u bois much love
BANGER
team gold daddy is a double stuffed oreo
Inertia is the tendency of an object to move. More mass more inertia and less like to move
Just do some Shabalabalaba 😅😅
7:00 That drawing of Ethan’s dad on the whiteboard is amazing.
The Tenderizer trying to tenderize the Golden Daddy !!!
The only reason Golden Daddy lost is cause of how poor Chris’s piloting was. They had it in the bag until he ruined the blade by driving into the wall at full speed
come on wee all know not give JJ the controller lol
Best sms ever. Could watch a series of this where they all have a robot each 😍
One of the best Sidemen videos in ages! LOVED this one guys!!!
Sidemen hole in the wall
Always had faith in the old terrorizer cahhhmon
Simon is right without realizing it lol Maul survives
Simon is right without realizing it lol Maul survives
This was amazing we need a part 2 or a series of builds vs builds in anything 😂
that was amazing I NEED A SECOND PART with more designing and footage of them being built but otherwise the boys smashed it again
Bro they got a robotic travis scott wtf
28:20
The way JJ was holding the controller was somehow frustrating
Such a fun video to watch
Simon doing naruto signs🤣
Vikk literally saved the day with the angles. Angled scoop > the golden daddy
Dope
Vik walked in like a gta npc lol
umm boyss, part 2 MUST have triple threat... MAD scenes!!
Andy needs some vitamin D 😭 mans is so pale
biggest what if ......... what if vik was controlling the robot
CHRIS IS SO FUNNY LMAOOOOO
I’ve been waiting for this since the react very excited to watch
Attention
I need them to do this again. Honestly there’s nothing like 2 robots killing eachother   Holy cow 1.6k likes in half a day.
Ksi team got destroyed so funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Here me out: Make this a series.
this was bloody amazing, I really rate contents like this rather than those dating ones
Tenderizer is spelled with a Z in the US at least
LOL why is the thumbnail for one of the robot's flamethrower is an optic...   For anyone wondering the flamethrower is a Leupold HAMR
2M VIEWS IN A DAY
Class video lads would like a part2 at some point.
He didn’t die watch Star Wars rebels
The few minutes which the match actually lasted was some of the hypest sidemen Sunday moments in history haven't seen them that keen for a very long time
somewhere in there, there's a poetic justice in the fact that Golden daddy got hammered by the Tenderizer but right now its lost on me XD
31:38 vik says the n word
Mario Kart vid??
LMFAO JJ
JJ: oh wait, just call it Ethans dad Chris: we just dont enter a robot into the competition  🤣🤣🤣🤣 the violation
Damn harry repping the Childish merch
Shoulda called the gold one sugar daddy 😆😆
That was pretty epic to be fair
the EatSides intro 😂😂😂
Bro the thumbnails are soww funny man they look so shocked🤣🤣🤣
What in the cringe was that intro 🤮
They should of called it “the beater meater”
Bit of an underwhelming end unfortunately
No one: Ethan: _T  O  R  K_
0:22 why does vikstar walk like that
why did I expect them to make Hiro's robot from Big Hero 6?
The fact this is trending on gaming?!?!!
Josh sacrificed the hammer in order to do enough damage to the spinner to stop it
Am I the only one that are looking at these welds on the builds and just like how are these holding up
Sidemen battlebots niceeee
I think Stevie wonder did some of the welding on those robots 😶‍🌫️
the leak makes them think that they destroyed something
ethan is surprisingly good at this
they should have called it the eggsecutioner
This video was actually so cool!! Deffo need a part 2 but maybe with a longer rounds
I saw this at TikTok
both robots are ganna be really good i can’t wait
they actually did it HAHAHAHAHAH BIG UP
Simon did absolutely nothing in the fight but blamed everyone else for losing 🤣
Thanks Josh for destroying that Eibarman fan
There should be another video of this but each sidemen gets their own robot with a tournamenty
Any wonder they didn't fall apart on their own with welding like that
JJ’s group robot looks like it could be from Star Wars lol
i think ksi team is ganna win
use the hammer to flip back up
Love how they thought they were spelling tenderizer wrong with a z when that’s correct
that is so cool.
Banger video
This reminds me of the 2 types of school group projects 😂😅 Group 1: smart and hardworking group Vs Group 2 : lazy and do whatever group
This was honestly sick
i am so disappointed in jj’s idea🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
We want a rocket battle as well!
Eats sides 10k calorie challenge
Looked like a Travis Scott concert with the other robot looking mad like Travis Scott
When the camera switches from vikks group drawing to jjs group drawing it’s so funny how there is a HUGE difference lol
This weeks sidemen was boring
Surely not the only one that jumped away from the screen when KSIMONs team was destroying microwaves and washing machines?  The fight really didn't go as I had planned
This was actually so good.
Love this group ❤️🇵🇭
When's the golden daddy get a rematch ?
Good vid... until the girly squealing started
Robot wars was a great tv show back in the day
Biggest Upset in Sidemen History!!! GG's to The Tenderizer!
Sidemen vodka, Sides! GONE CLEAR!
Darth Maul survived getting chopped in half… but he died to Obi Wan later on so yeah.
Let's gooo chrismd
10:07 Harry was about to burst laughing when Vik said "robot connoisseur" lmao
Yooo this is the best idea I’ve ever seen from the sidemen 🤟
Omg they acc did it
Boys teeth are yellow
Please do a video with Phil
Video wasn’t that long to be honest it was 80% talking 10%test driving 10% battle scene
Mual died but not becuase of him losing his legs.
how come one team got to practice on plastic childrens toys and the other got like proper washing machines and stuff
That was so sick bigggg dub
Lmao that was sick
6:11 vik awakening his inner great khali
Josh’s top is hard the green one with trap phone on is hard
It’s funny because Darth Maul came back with robotic legs so either way Simon wins that argument 😅
Youtube be like #1 on trending for gaming? Yep my real robot which i just built with real steel and parts, yep gaming!
This has to be up there with the GOAT sidemen vids
NGL this is one of the best recent video's , very nice
Golden Daddy shoulda won 😤
ksi vs logan paul again pls
I feel like the microwave and washing machine damaged their egg blade before the fight. Whereas the other team were given plastic toys
Cool cool. Make this a series plz
Sidemen Robot Wars tournament
darth maul survived lol
Drinking game: Take a shot every time someone says “LIKE”
Poor Harry couldn’t get a word In edgewise
pleaseeeeeee do sidemen dogeball with punishments
Ethan: these aren’t bad yk  Harry: yaree yaree
The hammer won
I like it how they never put YouTuber guests in the description
Yeah never do that intro again
Epic video
It's about time Simon and ksi bloody mary
Best sidemen video yet this was awesome guys 👌
Best vid sidemen have made in ages. Class content
team beard vs team beardless
Pause at 3:28 harry what u doin with ur hand there g😂
Oiiii Colchester ykkkk
tobi was lowkey being lame when they were destroying the machines and stuff
pog
Tobi be tryna turn it off every 5 seconds in training lmao
I Love these Kind of Videos, do more!!
a banger
Fire vid, I'm not even there but my heart is pounding😭🔥 congrats to The Tenderizer 🔥🔥🔥
Amazing video, if they managed to do this where every sidemen member made a robot and did a tournament it would be insane! Expensive and time consuming though.
I cant be the only one that somewhat knows the names of the bots in the pictures. We all know Tombstone and I think the other one is Rotator I don't remember. The show in America is battle bots.
Me a Star Wars nerd watching this: Darth Maul didn’t die!!!!
Bruh sidemen got a new restaurant chain or something what
i’m doing robotics in school and this is way more insane than thst
I want a redo
This was really good, do a part 2!
The welding hurts me
Ksi shoulda named it allow it bot
Please make a part 2 but in pairs
Some quality mechs
This vid got me watching professional* robot wars for 3 hours now lmao. So epic to watch
These guys are doing SIDE-missions now
Star wars nerd here   no Darth maul didn't die he is cut in half and then finds some spider robot leg things and lives in some tunnels somewhere on naboo I'm pretty sure. There is a whole big arc with him after this but that is the start of it.
SideSnacks would've been a great brand name
men being men is always good entertainment
👇This many people want part 2 (four teams but dous)
I like how JJ’s team has metal objects and Vick’s team has plastic toys
Please tell me the food is halal??? Imagine putting all these Islamic references in your videos and not acknowledging the Muslims views.
This was sic lads. I used to love watching robot wars back in the day. I was convinced the egg was gonna win seeing the damage it did to the white goods but the Josh’s skill hammered the win home
Didn't expect that result after watching what the weapons did in the warm up
Vik is actually to smart for the sidemen 😭
Robot Wars was one of the best shows to watch when it was on, hopefully they’ll be a part 2. Also respect to the guys who actually constructed the robots.
44:30 Josh was so confused where to clap 😂
ANother one NOW
PART 2 !!! we demand part 2
jj is arse at this
They should have made bigger robots tbh or gone for a free for all
I realized the last minute that the big machine with the claw and hammer had dreads💀
very good
sidemen reacts is just a planing time for the sdmn Sunday at this point
Ayy
I remember seeing them react to Robot Wars on Sidemen Reacts and wanting this to be a Sidemen sunday
Great video. ☺
PART 2 👀👀👀
My personal favourite Sidemen Sunday video in a while
Honestly after seeing The Golden Daddy crush the washing machine, and The Tenderizer being put up some plastic toys, I thought JJ’s team had it in the bag
14:06 Allow-IT Man's Arch Nemesis
part 2 is needed
#1 trending for gaming
One of the best videos I’ve seen in a while 😂
nothing is beating this video
Best sidemen video hands down
The welds are crap on all the robots
We need another one of these, please
why was jj controlling it like he has never seen a videogame controller before
Those welds are shocking
The tenderizer looks so sick omg and the thought that went to it makes it even better
I know Ethan did not just call the back of his robot submissive and breedable
part 2 pls with the beta squad
THIS WAS SICK!!
the robot looks like travis scott lol
It’s mad how josh draw an egg as meat 🥩
Been waiting to long for this
I know KSIMON is overdone but they are actually sitting SO close it's hilarious.
SIDES is a really good name, they’re really branching out, biz men!
Never underestimate the underdog
Who saw the video of fans storming the set
WE NEED A PART 2
This is the best sidemen sunday
They missed a trick not calling it "10 The Riser" cause of there rising hammer lol
Lol Vikk's team design actually looked legit, they had a proper blueprint, and then there is JJ's team
I genuinely look forward to my Sunday/ Monday just to watch these videos 😊
Awesome robots but the welds on them look floppy 😂
josh really looks like he's an expert on anything like he has a perfect face for any job
Darth Maul didn't die he got cut in half and sent down a garbage disposal, where he landed on the garbage "planet" where he slowly rebuilt himself for years and came back.
This idea started from a sidemen reacts video
I hope it’s halal
These boys did even know Darth Maul survived. :(
🥱
Missed opportunity to call there fast food bitesides
I know they all loved shooting for that ad in the beginning
Imagine if tgfbro had JJ’s teams robot when jay got a his head stuck in a microwave
anyone else thought andy was dantdm for a minute
Should’ve called it RC Hammer
Those welds... yikes
House bot looks like Sir Kilalot, the memories :’)
let’s have a robot wars 2 where every member of the sidemen get there own robot and they go into an arena at the same time
having chris in the vid for a change was so good !! love this
I just love it when I get that pop up saying “Someone has liked your comment” or “Someone has subscribed!” 😍 Makes somebody’s day better! Have a great day ❤️ PEOPLE!!!
Ethan and vikk have never watched robot wars, wanting a hammer over a spinning disc 😭
I just love it when I get that pop up saying “Someone has liked your comment” or “Someone has subscribed!” 😍 Makes somebody’s day better! Have a great day ❤️ PEOPLE!!!
I always love the rapport between Simon and JJ, funniest friend duo honestly.
Who else remembers on sidemen reacts when they  joked about doing this
We need a part 2
I was gassed when josh won bro
I’m 4 minutes in and I’m convinced josh Harry and tobi are all stoned 😂💎
Just for Simón to know darth moul didn't die he survived and end up on clone wars
This reminds anyone about that one zoey 101 episode?
I really wish Simon took the controls because I think he was better at the training thing but it was a fantastic video no matter the out come 😂😂
Chris is the man we all wanted to join the sidemen
Bruh I was slightly hungry. Put this vid on and now I'm really hungry
Tobi at 30:33: Turn it down.  Me: TURN DOWN FOR WHAT?
Vik looking fresh in clothes that aren’t just all black 👌
I liked the video before I watched it
Finally the true Battle of Bots
this was an absolutely great video. Y'all are legends.
That's what u get when u miss with legend ... Ethans dad 👌🏾👌🏾
If only we could get another
This the episode that almost got canceled by fans
More more more more more
the reason Ksi's team lost is because Tobi didn't contribute
was waiting for this since that reacts vid
That’s was the worst video Iv seen so far I’m a big fan but that was a bad video
U should have called it (The Golden Trogon) like the trogon horse (idk how to spell it)
The contrast in the planning phase was hilarious
The amount of money that went into this video...These things are NOT cheap
Lmao I remember them saying they should do this for a Sidemen Sunday on Sidemen reacts. Glad they went through with it
My boy andy 🔥🔥
Sidemen with the Pepsi sponsor, y’all up up
I saw the BTS and bro the fans are annoying lol, they gotta chill. But hey thats a con for being famous.
Please make this again but a part 2 but with different teams...vikk and zerka need to be on opposite teams
Harry is so cute 😂
https://youtu.be/ee_gCJwylkw
this was awesome!
Ayee Josh was actually so sick at driving the robot
This was sick!   Thought the hammer would lose based on the weapons test and what the bladr did to the appliances but fair play. The bulldozer front was the winning design!
They accomplished every "boys\mans" dream, of designing a killer robot. xD
12:15 When did vik become an amputee???
Do a part 2
Honestly great video idea but having to blur everything kind of losses the edge to the video
Imagine a 8 man free for all. What a video. Amazing
Not even watched it yet and i know for a fact these boys are way too lazy and half way too stupid to make these kinds of bots. Lets see if they show who makes them  Edit: Ok good they did.
I love this video 🤩 top video
KSI’s team’s Robot: *Shredding apart washing machines* Vikk’s team’s Robot: *Breaking plastic childhood toys*
Before there set was broken into
I didn’t even know robot wars was real I only saw it on the simpsons
He could've went with golden frieza
Dont know if I rate this or not 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤧🤧🤧🤧
simons attention to detail
I have been waiting for this since the reacts video
Best vid in a while
Please explain to me how Chris isn’t in Sidemen? What a legend!
Great video but the actual fight was dead.
I was so happy to see them bin the other team's robot in the pit. This was so good!
Best video ever
god damn brush them teeth ey
Chris md with Ethan’s dad joke too funny
Gg gg 😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 big up josh on the driving
teeth jeez
I honestly thought the tenderizer would fail but it surprised me
This pub golf and holiday videos are my favourite
*the teams planning the design*  Vik & Ethan: we want this mallet thing that goes *BANG*
9:52 as a Star Wars fan, he intact survived
Man I need another one of these 😭
Number one on trending for gaming?
Simon was right, Maul survived being cut in half... xD
ethans dad comment is so funny😂😂😂
i love robot wars so much and used 2 participate and havent even started the vid yet but know that they will b so dum and this will hurt 2 watch
This was so much fun! Big shoutout to the people building the bots! 👏🏻
Fun fact: Darth Maul survived
another huge banger
For a show that hasn’t been on tv in forever it’s amazing to see them get the actual arena and everything
A 🦂  scorpion designed robot
This is one of the best sidemen sundays
Ayo wtf, this was too sick
Expected more 😭
Oooh the boys got that pepis max brand deal
Me who watched sidemen reacts and watched them come up with the idea
BIG UP COLCHESTER YEA YEA!!!
The Tenderizer: Bang bang and the scrap is dent The Golden Daddy: HAH! Blade goes BRRRR!
Need a part2!
This was one of the sickest vids , had me hyped all 45 mins > <
BEYBLADE BATTLE NEXT
I love how the designers quietly sitting there knowing KSI’s teams robot works on both sides while helping Vikk’s team make a robot who’s entire strategy is flipping over KSI’s robot LMFAOO
shouldve made a robot each and done a tournament
At 39:13 man said golden dad-e babe-e
part 2 i beg FIREEEEEEEEE
3:28 harry's gonna need to explain this later
Very anticlimactic
Sidemen making money money moves💰💰
Haha the y did it
Sidemen Video Production has gone through the roof this year 📈. As a casual youtuber viewer, we don’t deserve this haha
How was jj using 1 hand wtf
Thats one scary roomba
Damn sidemen are big time now ya know
36:15 F1s be like
Yo Simon and JJ watch the clone wars tv show maul is alive
Months of planning for the blade and hammer to break on first contact 😂 love to know how much this cost 💷
I love how both teams where so confident
That wheelbarrow had a family
As soon as i seen jj with the control i instantly thought theyre done 🤣
i see a new pastel colour block hoodieee
Tbh If the winners team played with The Golden Daddy it Would have ended quicker
We need this to be an annual battle
on of the most interesting and original sidemen sundays ive seen in a while.
This might actually be the most enjoyable Sidemen video ever.
#TeamTenderizer
Engineers did Chris’s team dirty the spinners are the most op robots
I like How Harry is humble now !🤡!
This is awesome ‼️
are they sponsored by pepsi max?
can we talk about how sick the edits at the end were
Daily dose of ksi being cocky
The people who design the robots are talented af
filmed at leisure world colchester 📈📈 met all of yhem
I love how both robots just lost their primary source of damage instantly once the battle started so it boiled down to a jousting match (probably the robot equivalent of losing weapons and resorting to a fistfight)
Thay should do more of these it was crazy
First sidemen Sunday I disliked , 6 mins of fun
God Ethan is still the worst sidemen
That guy needs to brush his teeth bruh 🤢
JJ ?🤣 32:10
I really enjoyed this video
They need to do a rematch but 4 robots. But don't let vikk and josh team up. They are too good at this.
Sidemen apprentice?
Ethan moving mad 25:26 - 25:41
100% needs several more parts this was sick
Spinners suck..."laughs in tombstone"
that intro was
Man teeth like the yellow submarine.. Allow it man
14:58 the amount of times I thought there was hair on my screen 😭
Someone tell ChrisMD to watch Star Wars The Clone Wars to see what happened to Darth Maul
We need Robot Wars back
why does the beginning of this look like something from the sidemen show
Should've called it sidemunch. Like if u agree
I felt like such a nerd when they were picking up photos of robots and I knew all the names like oh yeah that's Tombstone, great design, Minautor is a beast... etc 😩
The ending was disappointing ngl
I swear they should do a Robot wars Tournament, get a few other guys involved all have their own Robots
🐐
Yesssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!
im a little late but thats fine
Big robot looks like jj
lit ep.
Lots of love from north east India.
The fight was so underwhelming😂
Best video ever ❤️
This was amazing whole nother class above boys
chrismd a perfect fit
These welds are driving me nuts 😂
Chris MD in sidemen video, Finally!!
Ngl, kinda wished Simon was driving the robot in the battle, just so he knows it's his turn to be the "laughing stock" in his team. Way too busy in annoying Chris and JJ!  Did laugh at the Darth Maul joke though! Cheers for the vid Sidemen!
I remember them talking abt this in a sidemen reacts
Is no one gonna talk about the video picture? A scope from cod on top of the robot haha 😂
If not for josh’s amazingly defensive abilities that tenderizer would got obliterated.
When Vik said this is Lenny I'm sure he was referring to a character from the book mice of men.                  Not sure tho
I expected more, nevertheless it was ok. I never expected the twist and of course JJ was their downfall, I thought he was good with his hands 🥊
Right I’m 1 minute in and have already seen 3 ads
Part 2 but many robots
Vil really want to drive that😁😁 and Harry really is shy.
I’m surely not the only one that hears James Acaster
Darth maul didn’t die btw he survives being chopped in half 😁
Yk something I've noticed with Simon is he never likes being the one focused on for too long. It's pretty clear he never puts himself in situations where he is put under pressure. Same with dating videos and fitness videos
Oml I already know this is a good one
3:28 Harry Harry Harry
Team Vik: *Calm and calculated  Team JJ: *E G G  B L A D E*
I feel bad for tobi bro 😞, he litterly got on the team where they wanted to make an egg robot 🤖😕
why are they eating like they havent seen food in days at the start ? 😂
Call it ethans dad and just don’t bring a robot got me so hard
Ngl it’s simons fault their team lost
SIDEMEN DO SOAPBOX RACING ???
We need a rematchhh
banger as always
2016 Tobi
Tactical masterclass from Josh
this was such a good video
That's the American way of how to spell "tenderize"
Real Star Wars fans know Simon is right about darth maul not being dead 😂
Why oh why did they give controls to KSI the man was the  worse driver 🤣🤣
Ahhhh my childhood came back for a sec. Loved robot wars loved this vid gg
Anyone else think this should become a series and add another robot in with a group of youtubers that changes up every time? 👀
Amazing video and i havent even watched it yet.
9:52 he lived
They should do another one a bring a few more people and have each person have their own robot. They could then do a bracket style tournament.
Elite video
Part 2 please
They should do a part 2 with 4 teams of 2 and have a massive tournament at the end.
Bet that “sides” thing will be like five guys prices 😂
Trending on gaming?
Please make this into a series
3:28  Ayo Harry....
PART 2
That one robot reminds me of Travis scot
If i still lived in the uk i wouldve ordered the sidemen food
Would love to see thies robots Vs carbide
I love how this video came to life cause of a sidemen reacts video
How much did this video cost to make?
This reminds me of the one episode of Zoey 101 back in the day
Ethan doesn’t shake jj’s hands at the end after jj ignored him a few mins earlier… 👀
I wanna know what they do with the robots afterwards because this was sick and need a part two with more teams and more robot for more destruction
I’ve just got in bed with school in the morning and now I’m hungry
Can’t belive the fight was over that quick 😂
It wasnt Josh behind the sticks...it was Tommy T behind the wheel
3:28. Hm Harry?!
Whoever built those robots for sdmn, they actually delivered what the boys wanted wow. Big up👍
Did anyone notice that this is the extreme robots atrena
Best video so far!
ChrisMD… really
UMMMM what was harry doing at 3:28 ahhahahhahaha
Vik’s team: Lots of actually planning and drawing JJ’s team: It will leak semen + circles
SIDEMEN BATTLEBOTS
Wtf is that boys teefers
This needs a free for all part 2
Do I hear a rematch
that video was actually great, fair play lads!
This is more entertaining than any jake paul fight
This was amazing childhood memories, we need a part 2 a free for all annihilater
Bro that big bit looked like Travis Scott
Robert wars was the best I am so hype for the sideman restaurants so hype let’s go sideman big w
VERY GOOD VID
Daddy’s golden egg 👌🏼
Vikk’s plan plus Josh’s driving makes the team too OP lmao
9:50 did he die   No he did not
43:04 chris 😂
Iam guessing Pepsi paid them for a sneaky add
I need a part two to this
Big robot looks like Travis Scott lmfao
Keep it coming with the videos guys! Amazing content and always excited to see the new Sunday video 🔥
I love how at 39:00 Tobi wasn't even booing
inertia is a property of matter, bill bill bill nye the scienceee guyyyy
“If your reading this it’s to late”
“#1 on Trending for gaming”
Should have a "like" counter, Boys be saying "like" 500 times first 10 min
This video was sick 37:30 for the fight
Need that pastel colour block hoodie
Pisses me off how yellow that guys teeth are
I want more
23:43 did Josh say 'chinking tendies'
The Golden Meatball: Harrys dad
Yoooo this video was sooo cool I was soooo gassed at the end. Let's go, thanks for all the videos, keep up the great work 👍  (edit): someone liked and unliked my comment, rather get 100 dislikes than that to happen :(
Stinky video
what a dead vid
.
Need part 2
In star wars darth maul did survive getting cut in half but  he died in star wars rebels.
The geeza making the robots is a lovely bloke
watching this wanted to make me make my own robot , sick video
Would of been a better video if the robots were built stronger
2 v the giant one lol
Games of skill Vikk:📈 Games of chance  Vikk:📉
one of my most fav sidemen sunday's👍 great job lads
I am a massive sidemen fan but I've got to say the videos recently have been a bit boring especially this one robot wars awesome sidemen version not so good
U can’t be mean to Chris man he’s so niceeeee yet sidemen always find their way 😭❤️
The cinematic food part at the start made me so hungry 😩 I haven’t had good food like that in awhile
Been waiting for this and it turned out sooo sick! Both teams went for food related robots too :D
Now this what i want from the past years ago
ChrisMD is always so jokes when he's on Sidemen Sundays, hope he features more.
Simon such a sore loser like bro cmon
Lowkey so disappointing that after all The weapons testing each robot only got to use its weapon once before it broke lmao. Woulda been cool to see how else it could have played out if both had working weapons
Congrats lads big banger
9:50 The ironic thing is Darth Maul didn't actually die hahaha (shoutout Clone Wars gang)
They put the Tenderizer up against some Fischer Price toys and the Golden Daddy had literal house appliances haha
Ggs in the chat! Good vid
This wasn’t fair man why did it stop 😭 i wanted to see more
I'd be fuming to have the weapons fail so quickly. Good builds but wtf was that about
loool the big robot looks like tarvis scott omg i dunno why but its so realated to his last consert
HONESTLY BY FAR THE MOST FAVORITE VIDEO OF MINE!🧡🧡🥵🥵🥵
I genuinely thought the blade would have done it
How can people watch 45 min of nothing?
I saw the tik tok video of the guys who snuck on the set
The guy on jjs team with the white t shirt on was so dry
Sides+mains is a better food name
my childhood consisted of waking up and watching robot wars there is so much nostalgia watching this
6:24 The real name is Tombstone
He actually will die later 9:55
Actually one of the best sdmn videos I’ve seen in a long time
This vid is too good 😂
L video
Could tell vik really wanted to be the driver there man
Yah, they should’ve never given that controller to chris
Sidemen need to do a tekeshi castle video
What a banger!
Guest stars ChrisMD and DanTDM presenting lmao
The robots looked so much cooler than I thought they’d be   Absolutely incredible
I've never been so jealous in my life. I always wanted to create my own robot for robot wars 😩
Hide n seek in a hotel
The Guy has yellow 🦷
this might be the best cinematography in sidemen history
Perfect way to end my birthday 😊
7:15
Awesome vid
Yeee
Naahhh ! the usual sidemen content is much better as compared to this video
This is actually a sick vid 🔥🔥🔥😍
On SidemenReacts they should watch clips from Battlebots considering they had a picture of Tombstone and all their robots
That intro made me cry
I didn’t think I would enjoy this but omg, when it destroyed the washing machine I screamed
Wow, nice video👍
I SWEAR SIMON IS ALWAYS SITTING NEXT TO JJ
Enjoyed this very much
The robot guy’s teeth are so yellow they make the sun go out of business
Great video idea deffo need to do a number 2 in future
Ah this was the colchester sidemen video breakin
Man, too many fking bots in the comment section these days
The start just looks like an advert haha
Banger 💯
Honestly this video was sick.
This is gass! What an episode!
Josh banged that 😂😂
Golden Daddy + Josh  End of the big Robot🔥
Where’s the tinder at tho? 🤔
Anyone else notice that Andy guys dusty teeth
Wow
Tommy T oh no josh is a great driver
From "They are done fam" to " We are fcked" a night summed up for JJ😂😂
They Should Do An Imposter Video
Anyone else see Tobi’s scissor necklace.
Vik draws an actual robot JJ draws an egg😭😭💀
can tobi shut up
By far the one of their worst ones in recent months. Imagine the guy who suggested robotics as an idea lmao
Side BURGER
How many ads are enough ads?
Viks  team drawing a full diagram while jj draws a fried egg
45 minute video on robot wars. Not even 20% of it is the actual fight. lmao
31:37 Vick drops the N bomb ;(
this was a banger
They all tanned 👀👀 sidemen holiday soon??
I think JJ had a bit too much fun with his blade
Real ones remember when harry suggested this in a sidemenreacts vid
This is elite content
Harry expressing his inner German 3:27
This video was so sick
YES I was watching robot wars on bbc so I’m so glad
ChrisMD..... Whose opinion in football is as irrelevant as he is.
Wowww https://youtu.be/FSSFgWlDbJU……..
This is the best sidemen Sunday
Bro all tucked in bed not even hungry, now imma have to get some munch because of the food intro
Now I know why they posted 2 bangers on there second channel this week, cus they knew this video was dead
Imagine a mr beast tournament with 10 YouTubers
Bro I want Harry 🤌🏼🥵
Ok while I am a fan of the sidemen I think this is getting a little bit mad 16 bucks advent calendars side plus stuff they don't even know there selling now food I think they need to chill abit or sperd them about
Darth maul didn’t die
42:39 vic is TENSE😂😂😂
Love that while Ethan and vik are making a masterpiece JJ is just drawing a fried egg😅😂
My mans teeth r yellow
sik vid
That Guys Teeth
Ok but why is chrisMD here 🤣😭
Love how genuinely invested they are in this
Team Tenderizer 👑
9:30 best part is Darth Maul didn't die.
bro it’s funny how like viks team think they have the best robot by destroying plastic toys. but jj’s team destroying a mf washing machine
Anyone else see this idea birthed on sidemenreacts?
P2????
Vik’s team put so much more thought and effort into theirs
this was a sick video
Only if they didn't break so fast
Banger
They should do a second one but with more people. 4 robots and a mini tournament
has simon watched Star Wars Clones wars? 9:53??
We demand more!
No way Chris finally got an appearance
Simon is right darth maul survived being chopped in half
Awesome!!
Chris MD is still alive damn
Leave how one team smashing plastic and the other is metal stuff lmao
Pls Robot wars 2 this was insane and so fricking fun
Okay i'm watching this at like 1 am and i'm so hungry beacause of the fricking intro :/
Another banger! Who’s video idea was it
SIDEMEN EXTREME ROBOT WARS 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 22 2 2 2 2 2 22 2 2 2
This was amazing! Please do it again at some point
another one
Sidemen Sunday just hits different haha
I watched the robot wars on the sidemen reacts channel yesterday!! And now this!!! Sickkkkk
harry had such a mehh explaining 🤣
To be fair... It does look better with the 'z'
There need to be another part
Anyone else confused which restaurant they were advertising😭😭😭
jj is in a jd sports add
Chef looks like gundogan on 2 chem
The build up was better then the actual battle
more
Major Damage looks like JJ lol
Intro looked like youtube series
Defo needs a slow mo replay with the best parts at the end. Watched the battle twice. So good, pure entertainment!
I need a part 2
Wowww https://youtu.be/FSSFgWlDbJU…….
Damn these videos don’t hit like they used to, bare boring now
I love how excited they got when they won ahaha :)
More robo wars pliz!!! :D
MORE OF THIS
Who is the guy who helped make the robots he’s sick fr
rematch ples
Over 1millon view in 4hour killing it boys!!
_'Coming up'_ or _'Preview'_ sections in the beginning of videos are already quite stupid. *Blurring* them to not spoil anything makes them absolutely useless. Bravo editing team!
I remember this sone walked in on it during filming if I'm not wrong
What. A. Video.
Simon is so annoying , he is so involved in the person doing the stuff and moans , but then he never wants to step up and do it . Like bro u didn’t step up , so u cant moan at all
who is the blondie
Best one in a while.
Would like to see see a second one and them actually working on the robots and the process of making one
If only they hadn’t broken it would have been 10x better
I reckon the sidemen should go on I'm a celeb next year 👀
with the Pepsi and Uber eats money right off the bat sheesh
Ongoing series
if that hammer had snap action it wouldve been over
MAKE THIS A SEQUEL ✨✨
The guy who helped them design their robots kind of sounded like James Acaster haha
When Andy cabbaged Simon I new this vid was gunna be a banger
Part 2 has to happen, this was insane
2 months building them to get them destroyed in 30 seconds
This puts a whole new meaning to "Don't put all your eggs in one basket"!
Peitition for them to do Robot wars 2 for Chris' sake xD
I beg for a Part 2 with more teams!!!!
Next time bring Harry Pinero as guest  pleaseeee
We need a part 2
Chip, syped....this editing 🔥
That dude was just nodding at everything
I see the Pepsi sponsor 💸
Video idea babtunde vs 20 women
Big plays bro
This looks like battle bots remember that show  (I've only seen on Netflix)
Chris MD (mini djck, micro djck or whatever it stands for) is just a disappointment.
41:24 Bro Harry got them vocals
The lad that helped design and build the robots was great. He had great banter with the guys and made some dope looking robots.
This is every boys childhood dream
Worst sidemen video
the tenderizer looks sick with the XIX on the side
Need a whole tournament it was sick
they’re the biggest geeks in the best way possible
Egg blade
All that for 5 mins of a battle
Oh of corse I do, we know I stank lol
Into gave me Sidemen show vibes😔
The best sidemen Sunday of 2021
So weird I never usually watch promos y'all too much tho😭😭
Why does harry wear tgf merch?
Part 2 needed
The boys have officially gone clear
Mark Rober is typing...
This is so amazing 🤩
Top tier content
This video was sick tbf
Why are the tenders so plain tho ? Cover them in buffalo sauce
Tommy T got driving skills .. mans used to driving stolen vehicles.. its prepared him well for this 😂😂😂
This is my favorite sidemen video. Josh is insane on the wheels!!
this made me realize how far in advance do they film sidemen videos?? because this seems like it was filmed in the summer
Imagine the sidemen 8 years ago with this food colab
Yoooo this is sick
The KSI knows Darth Maul ???
This video concept is sick and extremely well executed Probs to the masterminds behind this video it's entertaining af
Viks team: Calculating everything about robot.  JJ’s team: Set 8 building a robot.
New robocop is looking good this year!
This is the best sidemen idea ever!
If Simon would of maned up and drove they would have easily won
Chrismd made it to sidemen sunday
Poor harry didn't get to say what he wanted
Number 1 trending for gaming?!?! This is gaming. I thought it was sport.
If joshes hammer hasn’t of broke m they would of  won even easier as they corner them and had them pinned so many times (so many opportunities to hammer them) but they dominated even without hammer
that robot guy is honestly so sound props to him for making and sorting the robots
Why is this trending on the gaming page
This is a stinkah
Ethans dad then not enter a robot Got me . Was half way to drinking water now I'm soaked. Lmao
top tier content
I love ittttt ❤️
Y’all gotta do a part 2
Egg: breaks washing machine Mallet: barely destorys plastic toy wheelbarrow
Am I the only one who thinks the guy at the start looks like DanTDM
11:34 vik: "is there any way to make it more offensive" Write down Jake Paul is a better rapper than ksi
I'm shockingly surprised that during the planning phase the team with Simon and Tobi was so disorganized while the team with Ethan and Harry was so organized.
That bot that they were showing the photo of is called tombstone it’s made by hall Rucker
43:10 JJ fr just denied Ethan of that handshake
ANOTHER😳
Sidemen should play the British classic Raven with James Mackenzie
21:57 Did no one else clock Harry calling Josh an OAP 😂😂
The content weekly is freaking awesome!
Why did they have jj drive😂
This is the best sidemen sunday I have ever witnessed
The way Harry and Ethan gas up their robot is just hilarious 😂
Instalike 2 seconds in!
Sidemen goin Cray Bruv💥🧨💛
nah Chris needs to make another appearance this video was more sidemen quality
🔥
Big respect to the robot wars guys
That was soo good
The kinda stiffed them with how weak they made the hammer and the blade
what does simon has in his mouth
People who have not watched starwars       👁👄👁
🔥
was anyone else waiting to see if the people who ran onto their set would be in the vid? It’s good that it wasn’t put into the video and i respect the sidemen for not putting it in as it would encourage other people to try and get a cameo in the vids too.
Yes its happened 👀👀👀
Pleaaaaaase part 2
This guy's so white he's blue! Looks like he's never seen the sun
This needs 20 mil views come on everyone we can make it happen
Been blue balled a bit there, 40 min build up for a 2 min battle 😰
“Golden Spinning Egg no Jutsu”
Tobi actually pisses me off asking to cut it after every little hit smh
Giz me some free Murch
If anyone watched battle bots  This is the video this is inspired
People look down on the Sidemen for being a bunch of rich guys who don't care about their fans. But it was so nice of them to devote an entire Sidemen Sunday, that took 2 months and thousands of pounds to film, just to put a smile on on the face of a Sidemen & Robot Wars make-a-wish child's face. Well done boys, well done.
waiting for a rematch
honestly my fave sidemen sunday in a while, bangin video lads!!
Thanks for spoiling the entire video in 1 seconds.
Not gonna lie I want more of this like an actual one where all the boys have a robot and it’s a free for all
I argue that the Food stuff at the beginning was unneccsary!!!!
Man I loved robot wars why did they cancel it but one of the best sidemen vids
Big ups the robot guy
Definitely want a round 2 of this!
definitely gonna need another one
spoiler:      the tenderizer hammer swing was so tactical because they could still use their ramp to man-handle the golden daddy into submission. they sacrificed one of their modes of annihilation for the ONLY mode of annihilation of golden daddy being the blade... defenseless and defeated

Who remembers when they said they would do this for a sidemen Sunday
Anyone else have no clue what the ad at the start was but thought it was sick
Okayy, is this the best episode ever or what?
Josh did so good because back in his childhood video games weren’t invented so he had to play with RC Cars
Why does the robot guy look like clay from 13 reason why?
I would absolutly LOVE a part 2 on this. Split them into 2 new teams and let them make new robots!!!
I would say Golden daddy got used so much in the testing round that it got damaged during the test run just like Cyber truck window glass at the backstage that it got broke at the live event. They should have just stopped after destroying microwave. Their test run backfired on themselves.
Zerka was a legend this video.
Legit found the intro more interesting then the video 😅
how tf is this trending on the gaming category
All the times JJ has betrayed and Bullied Vik. He is finally getting a sneaky revenge. 😂
Ngl, I was worried that eggblade would annihilate the hammer if it came in contact (which it did), I didn't expect the eggblade to take damage from hammer too though
Dead vid
Eating while listening to the sperm bit, wrong choice
Round 2?
RIP Washing machine💀💀😂
What is that boss robots name ?
Great vid. Darth maul didnt die lol 😁
They gotta make an annual thing
Is it halal
Great video idea! What great fun that looks!
Why was tobi so scared lol
The nostalgia is real
We need a part 2 honestly
Allready want the part 2
still waiting for squid game in real life
This was sick
Spread the gospel turn to God,Amen
They said theyd do ut and they did
JJ was a double agent😂😂😂😂
We all want part 2
Do spill your guts part 2!!!!!!
My television childhood and my youtube childhood combined. So happy
We need part 2 of this 🔥
Darth maul does in fact survive
Ok I may be delusional but I think I submitted this idea
That was really exciting gg sidemen
I bet a lot of people wanted to see this video idea.
The entirety of team tenderizer had their hands on the controller before JJ was done
Tandelizer team reaction to golden daddy was so underrated
Hello there mate
fam. they are releasing too much at once. They need to be more big time. I love these guys, but again, too much all at once!
This was terrible. They both lasted no time. Both weapons broke really quickly, still entertaining
Who else watched the sidemen reacts where they came up with this
They are like a bunch of 10 year olds with the robots😂 gotta love it
We need a part 2
These guys are making MOOOVES
43:08 when ethan tried to shake jjs hand
I was somewhat hoping they would've showed the part when they got swarmed by fans.
They should do a sidemen im a celeb
we need a part 2 of this
It gave me apprentice vibes at the start haha I dunno why
The build up was better than the fight
I’m currently 5 mins in and I’m so intreiged
What happend to sidemen tinder IRL 1? I cant find it on their channel lol
Prolly my favourite sidemen video
I love how team gold daddy was practicing against huge metal objects and the other team is practicing against plastic toys
Sidemen version of battle bots ❤🤘
golden daddy is such an underrated robot
sponsor a sidemen robotwars team
Simon stayed violating Chris LMAO
These guys ain’t doing it like no others
We need a part 2 for this, get freezy and randolph involved, make it a tournament
Wh o gave it to jj
Amazing video, this is absolute quality
JJ should have suggested naming the robot, allow it bot.
bro got the yellow on yellow teeth
That's was sick
they should do more
Should have called it The Meat Beater
It was great fun to watch, must have been brilliant to take part in.
That final battle was the biggest upset of the century. Especially after the hammer died lmfao
We need a sidemen dinnerdate episode with KSI, Harry and Ethan!
Hell yeah crush gear time baby!
Always have faith in Josh to get things done!
Eatsides the gang lezz goo
his teeth are maddddddd yellow
I loved doing this class in highschool
Ethan's Team: *Have a detailed plan about how to mess up the electrics JJ: eggblade.
1:01 minecraft villager be like
Seriously branching out aren't the sidemen these mans gonna do everything.
W VIDEO!!
Ayyy the best tv show of all time gets a reboot
*Star Wars Clone Wars/Rebels spoiler* I really wish one of them would have watched the Clone Wars/Rebels animated series so that they could have backed Simon up that he didn't die XD
43:10 Legends say ethan is still waiting for the handshake from jj 😭😂😂
Sidemen is always getting better 🔥
im just sad they didnt call it side dish, thought that would have been very funny
This feels like an old-school Sidemen video (which is not a bad thing obviously, this was a great vid)
Come on tenderizer!!!!
They gave my guys children's toys to crush. While the other team had  a TV. Washing machine, microwave.
I think in the us tenderizer is spelled with a z so it looks normal
sick intro
I just left reddit because im sigma
whos here within 5 hours!!
The bloke designing is a bobblehead figure. Can't keep it still
The levels sidemen are at now are just ridiculous. Well done to the boys and the crew!
Chrismd suited this video, he played a good part.
12:19 How many times does vik say like
Oh my they spelt tenderiser 😠
Officially my new favourite Sidemen video based of the title alone
This was good but they should've separated vik and josh
Here before 1 mil card
There needs to be a part 2
i beg u man do a part 2😂😂
Imagine the next sidemen sunday is tinder 4
Why does Tobi say to stop, like the point is to watch  and see what the bot can do! Never been a fan of tobi! I would hate to be his partner in any of the sidemen videos
Sooo good about time
Don’t know why tobi is so scared of destroying things with Golden daddy, kinda triggered me
Please get Stephen in the next video
Man like Zerkaa on the sticks. Quality again.
Knew this was coming after seeing that Tiktok from the guys breaking in the place
part 2
Imagine being a Side+ members knowing today was robot wars (not usual btw)
end wasnt that good. should have been 2v2v2v2
They wrote the tenderizer wrong. It's "The tenderiser".
For some reason I expected Phil to be the chef at the start
That's a banger.
I was waiting for this
We need a 2.0!
No better way to spend my Sunday afternoon then watch a bunch of grown men cheer at metal pieces get launched in the air
It's a dancing ballerina
I'm 100% sure u made bag from pepsimax on da table
the outcome was not what i expected josh the goat
ohhh that’s why they were in colchester
JJ's team had more powerful weapon but Josh's driving and control was better :)
Amazing Video 💯💯💯
i was exited for this video and it delivered
ngl, wasnt a good sidemen sunday
andy looks like the smart version of musty
That was sick love watching robot fighting
Petition for Chris to become a full time sideman
Banger!!! I don't know how they thought of this idea bit it was amazing
BROOOOOOOOOO  i thought it was monday and the muckbang yesterday was the sidemen monday smh. it was a banger tho
Can we just appreciate how the guys let Chris MD takes control because it’s been a dream of his. If they don’t reach 15 mill by the end of this year ima be mad
This is one of the best I’ve seen, and I haven’t even seen it. Robot wars was the one I’ve wanted for ages
darth maul survied btw
Knowing how much these things take to make.. this was a SICK Video boys.
Sponsored by pepsi max?
spencer  fc without the beard
Remember the GOAT that was Hypno-Disc?  Always support him on Robot Wars back in the day.
Nah they got a whole fast food brand now?? These guys are really big time
Part 2 pleaseeeeeeeeee part 2 another 1
Josh drove it like he’s Tommy T
This was one of if not the best sidemen sundays so far
The editor done well to cut out the people sneaking into the shoot.
Sick vid again!
Who was there in sidemen react when they came up with this idea 🤚🏼
The fact Harry’s wearing sliders cracks me up. No pun intended
This was actually such a fire video🔥
Banger of a video
More gaming instead please
Can’t believe JJs team missed the opportunity to call their robot the “eggsecutor”
Oh yessssssss!
Do “sidemen work at fast food restaurants”
absolute banger
31:30 sounds like vik says Bigga with a n
I hope a rematch is on the cards!!
10:04 I feel like this was the winning moment
31:18 poor tobi, no one heard his pun😔
UNDERDOGS
I’m so happy this is going to be EPIC
The welding on the robots is atrocious
Robot action time
The boys never miss
God, the original Robot Wars series was childhood gold TV. Perfect
They are filming a holiday 100% prefilmed as they said this is coming out in November and josh ain’t doing RP
perfect
BANGER !
That food looks amazing I'm hoping one opens up in Dublin
Beyblade, beyblade let it rip
That final battle was sick! Well worth the build up!!
I grew up watching robot wars seeing these lads re-create it now I'm almost 18 is such a bizzare nostalgic but new feeling
39.16 The cameraman  lookin like Ethan
22:52 when ethan started shouting bog I lost it LMAO
This is the one where the sidemen fans invaded them during filming on tiktok
Yoooo we need another one
The final battle looks like a real life video game lol
Damn, I like my food with Mtn Dew. Shame.
Phenomenal idea and video!
stinker
filmed in lesuire world colchester lmao
I was unsure at the beginning but what a sick video!
Who else remembers the sidemen reacts video where they said the should do this
Awesomeee
I knew their team was going to win and their hammer was going to break
Shame the robots aren't as robust as the real ones
That was fire plz pt2🔥🔥🔥
This video is actually sick
Wish they did one where they all had one each 👀
PLS DO ANOTHER ONE!!! THIS WAS ACTUALLY SICK
Bruh while vik ethan and Harry were smashing plastic the others were smashing a washing machine and a microwave
This was sick!
All the childhood memories i got from this video... Banger
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ew, pepsi
This video idea is actually mad. Nobody does it like the sidemen
We need Part 2 come on
Tenderise isn’t a word
This was amazing
This is so sick
24:15
This must be the shoot them geeks crashed sick video though
I'm pretty sure it was the slam with the wedge that damaged the disc rather than the hammer
The names are great, daddy going to get his meat tenderised😂
I was the 1 milli view wtaf
tenderizer made me proud
Storm breaker robot would look good
jj stick to music...
Been waiting so long for this video since it was suggested and it lived up to expectations. So sick 🔥
That was sick, i enjoyed myself watching it
Again please
Now I know who JJ was talking about in the Nandos muckbang about stinky breath ;)
Top quality welds 🥴
vodka and fast food... nothing like using your influence to promote healthy living eh guys?
boiz: drawing sick 3d schema of their robot  also boiz: *E G G*
well, that's gonna be interesting
This was a sick video
Moving mad
First Vodka… Now Food… What’s next ?
I demand a rematch
Comment for the boys
vik " i just wanna bang bang"
21:00
This is probably my new favorite Sidemen video now. I really hope they do a part 2 for this, and maybe do 4 robots and make a mini tournament for it. As for the robots, they both look really good, and I knew the match was going to go 1 of 2 ways. Either Golden Daddy winning with pure destruction, or Tenderizer winning with control. It's a lot harder to control a 2 wheel robot than a 4 wheel one. Plus Tenderizer has a defensive wedge to not only deflect the blows from the disc, it also helps in a pushing match compared to a disabled disc. Spinners are some of the most successful designs out there, but once their weapon breaks, they're just sitting ducks afterwards. Hammers are cool, however most hammer bots do not do well in robot combat. Only Terrorhurtz and Beta had the most success with hammers, and they're both built by the same team. And sometimes the best defence is the best offence, which proved to be the case in this fight.
will side eats come to the US?
When did they start filming this?
so early that jj forgot to put ads in this video
A Million views in Not even 4 hours....
One of the best videos , definitely need to do more of these
I’ve been here 😂
Battle bots ❌ Robot wars ✅
Not gnna lie jj deserves that L he flopped very badly the paigon
hypeeeeee
Yes the best sidemen video ever!!!!
The welds on the gold one😂
Cant believe they used a blooper as the actual add for the burgers
jj never wins
quality for sidemen sunday goes crazyyyy
That blade would've destroyed everything if it didn't die within 20 seconds😂😂
jj and vik not on good terms mad
im the 1millionth view
Please use halal ingredients
1m viewer !!
1 Mil views in 3 hours damn
40:00 actual robot fight lol
This is literally peak UK childhood vs The current peak of life coming together
JJ: we gonna make the big daddies Josh: is that a challenge
I love how one teams destroying metal washing machines and the others destroying plastic childrens toys
Bring EatSides to Australia please, be the first on youtube to branch your food brand out abroad, a man can dream!
They put a rifle scope on top of the robot in the thumbnail lol
Bruv I order and jalabad came in ??
I like it how they put a fake blade and fake flamethrower on thumbnail lol
JJ’s IQ and handcordination could be the worst i’ve ever seen
Blurring in the into so it doesn't spoil anything should be used more often
Why did I pause at 3:27
They need to 2v1 the big boss robot
Team 1: Fisher price Team 2: Home appliances
3:27 Harry went German 🇩🇪
I remember that on the telly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIeuld84w3c&t=6s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIeuld84w3c&t=6s
bro this was so fun to watch actually had me on the Edge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIeuld84w3c&t=6s
NAAAAAAH THIS IS INSANE
THIS IS JUST A NEXT LEVEL OF SIDEMEN. THERE NEED TO BE A FREEZE TAG
I need a part 2
This is sick
The actual fight was dead
such a sick video, been waiting for it...
I loved watching these when I was young
Disappointed they didnt call it the meat beater
14:17 Simon kinda predicted the fate of the Golden Daddy
bro...how many things are they doing oh my god💀💀 jesus christ! my mind would overload thinking everything has to be perfect and get stuff done 24/7 they have moresdmn to shoot all the time,sdmn shoots and they have to organise all this as well,sdmn reacts,sdmn clips,side+,eatsides,sidecast,they do their own events sometimes,they have merch jesus christ thag's alot to have on your mind but i guess the only reason they can bear with it is cause it's 7 of them so the pressure comes off soemtimes since each week one person has to plan and the rest just has to show up and also come up with video ideas
AGANE AGANE AGANE! xD
Great Video idea, do one free for all, so everyone has one! :O
Need a part 2
Someone else thinks that the robotguy exactly moves like vik when he describes something?
BANGER VID
This video had me laughing 😂
Team Beard vs Team no beard
What an anti climax😂😂
ksi drinks pepsimax   love that mate
They should open a restaurant and call it SIDE order
Anyone know robot nerds @ ?
josh should pursue this career
34:55 vikkstars dreams broken
me eating a lovely burger while watching this video KSI: talks about putting everyones sperm to make some kind of slippery path
Sidemen got the 'sauce' big moves
Petition for sidemen extreme lazar tag
Part 2 but with more teams and robots
I did not expect Vikk's team to win tbh. But the unbeatable gamer duo made it happen
This was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Listened to this and had no idea james acaster was a robot-wars master
Part 2 but with a more durable robots
Every Sunday gives me another reason to live
this is an absolute bangerr !!
Need a part 2
no-one gonna talk about 28:17
This show was my fav when I was younger
This is sick!
As soon as a We saw the egg blade we knew who was winning.
last weeks one was insane
Let's goo!
Loved robot wars, loved thus
I wanna part 2 that was so epic
This end of the video got me so gassed fr tho
How does Ksi get blamed for that loss. Just randomly handed the controller lol cmon man
I sure this guy doesn't need tik tok camera filter to see if his teeth yellow or not. Im sure he knows lol
Woahhhh😮
Imagine if everyone had their own robot and they all just went in free for all
oh come on man, i was hungry before i clicked on the video and then u have that introXD
Josh is such a underrated legend yk
This was sick
Another one!!
This needs a rematch! Insane video
11:20 would look really strange out of context
Whens sidemen robot wars 2.0 coming? 😍
The amount of effort The Sidemen are putting 🔥
3:27 Umm Harry your arm
Legit I was thinking the exact same thing when josh mentioned a small robot going under the opposition
Chris not even a sidemen member why he driving
Lamest video possible
Next robot wars, teams of 3 free for all!!!
"Golden Daddy" 🤣
There absolutely needs to be a part two !,
Ayo sidemen do I’m a celebrity, that’d be sick
I feel like the guys' driving skills reflect their rocket league skills.
This started as a reaction idea and turned into a reality, the content 🔥
should have called it daddy falaby
Another amazing sunday
8:00 Ethan's sitting next to his dad, so cute 🥺
What in the efff is going on, the simulation is broken maaaannnnnn
Pls do a part two
Please make this a returning thing (like the tinder and 100 vs 10000)
I thought it was Gordon 😤MAD FACE !
Chris known it all should have gone for an actual flipper. Like Apollo style: it would have been perfect.considering the little usage and damage it would have had to deal with. I bet one flip josh would have been rocked lol
Mans needs a toothbrush
6:25 thombstone by ray billings
Them going between the two drawings are so funny
If there's one thing I hate it's horizontal spinners
We need to make this a series this is so fuego🔥🔥🔥
Ethans team should of called their robot The Masterbaiter
I enjoyed this ALOT
This idea is definitely not taken from a sidemen reacts video
LETS GO TENDERIZERS
the fact that in weapon testing, one robot was fighting plastic toys and the other was fighting washing machines😂
sidemen have gone clear ya know
Love your editing as always guys 🙌🏼 Big ups to the sidemen for always keeping up with the great content ☺️
school project
not blood just paint
Plss do a part 2
part 2
who are those guys
That’s sickkk
The starwars reference was funny asf ngl, "but he did get chopped in half"
THE MOST HYPE VIDEO EVER OMG
Well done to whoever was in charge of this one. Made my day.
This was such a banger
We’ve all been wanting this.
soo funnn
man needs to brush his teeth asap lmao
if sideman did a dad muckbang :  simons dad: "the burgers pretty good"  tobis dad: "I like the chip"  ksi dad:" this is very nice"  josh dad: "I like it"  vick dad: "u should put some curry spices on this chips"  harry:"bath time boys"  ethan dad: "                "
Collab of the century
Ayy these sidemen Sunday videos are getting better every week, but I have one question...  ...When is the next Moo Off?
probably one of the best sidemen Sundays
Use me as the dislike button
That was gas big UP the TENDERIZER
Such a goated video
The video production on this video is next level👏🏼👏🏼
WOOO! the old days of robot wars lets goooo!!!!
The sidemen are so good at finding good video ideas :D
Nice
This was fire
one of the most boring videos ive seen from yall in a while
They did the thing
L KSI
Why on earth JJ holding the controller like that ??? Bet he doesn't hold his xbox controller like that, what an absolute nonce
I’m surprised jj diddnt say golden frieza
Question: Does Sidemen Clothing do black Friday deals? Wanted to buy something but wasn't sure if there was any point waiting or not
Im disappointed man they both broke in the first 30 seconds
Josh is cold with it
Who else remembers when they were thinking of making this a Sidemen Sunday in another video? 😂
New interest: Unlocked
Ethan, Vik, Harry and Josh are the best Sidemen team lmao
Pepsi come on......
Whoever came up wid this idea big up them😮‍💨
The Tobi, Simon, JJ trio is undefeated
This video was such a banger
I think we all know who JJ was referring to for who had terrible breath in the mukbang video
Simons the type of guy to complain about his teams driving, when hes the best driver that doesnt want to drive
Who else remember the reacts vid this from
best video yet
Dude josh was a legend in this video. He is so underrated
Do it again please liked it a lot 👀😁
Seems like there's also robots in the comments section
It was so hype to see the Tenderizer win with Josh
Someones been watching braille skateboarding ahahahahaha
The washMachine would of lived longer with Calvon
O hell yeah
So which of the boy's now has the Robot at home 😂
9:52 Simon is never wrong just right with extra steps
ofc jj goes straight for the food
OMG finally the video that harry requested
Is that Christian
03:28 Harry going Hitler mode
So underwhelming
ohhhh so this is what simon said in his live stream months ago that they started recording for a video but it will not be out for like a while sheeesh  edit: heres the link to it  https://youtu.be/IQbjmLrYGkM
Anyone gunna make a joke about Harry being on the right line then
what a legendary video
This needs a part 2. It looked like they actually had fun in this video 😂
I can't believe this is happening
If the main weapons hadn't of broken that would have been amazing
I am black but there’s too many comments for people to know.
#BringBackRobotWars
The standard just grows each time
wow
will it be halal or nah
Question is if its halal tho
Episode 2: Their girlfriends design it.
That initial ad made think of one thing.. Sidemen should probably start their own delivery service🔥
Fact that one hit with the hammer... Just completely disabled the circuits and all they had to do was ram into them non stop since they had no weapon other than the blade
a part 2 of the robots from both sidemen teams team up against the massive robot would be pretty hype, even though the sidemen ones would most likely get annihilated
This was a fantastic video
Bro we even got a trailer before the vid, who else is doing it
31:20 Nice one Tobi
*dead sidemen sunday cant lie*
Luke 11:28 But he said, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!”🙌
The engineer's face got me dying 19:24
Bro why did the chicken have to pop up after we just saw jj
Noice
Normal robot wars full on geek and technical talk... Sidemen robot wars let's have a robot that spunks on the other team... 😂😂 Props to the technician getting involved with the spunk talk only sidemen could achieve getting a robotier to use talk of ejaculation
The robot designer sounds like James acaster
The sidemen should do take me out and one of the boys is the host and the rest come down one by one that’d be jokes
need more of these
At this point Simon has more facial hair than KSI
guys i tink yoo speld tenderiser rong
*MY CHILDHOOD* AYE I USED TO WATCH THIS ALOT MAN
Let's admit it we thought ethans Harry josh and vik would win but after seeing the other teams machine in a test run when they broke things with the spinner everyone knew they would win instead but then somehow they still won(because of the other massive robot).
Real ones know they did a reaction video to robot wars! And they said they should do this for a future a video! Here we are 🙏
Yes finally something competitive
Am I the only one concentrating on simon's facial hair???
Oh yeah, let's give the worst GTA driver the controls up against the best GTA driver
nobody seeing the rasen shuriken team egg made !!
Best video in a while!
to think they've gone from doing football videos in a park to robot wars is mad
This is where vik really gets to use his knowledge
This is the content I needed
This was it
I think i entered the wrong video ...
I love Robot Wars. Guys make a part 2 in the future (if possible). This is like one of the best sidemen videos ever. Really enjoyed it... I can't express in words how much i liked this video.
Super incredible video! They made their idea from SidemenReacts happen!!
We need a rematch!
38:11 it's a WALKOUT!!
Big up the chicken tendies Tenderizer
REMATCH!!!!!
What a vid
the hoodie game was on point
Darth maul actually ironically got his legs replaced with robot legs later on lmfao
Bruh I called this time ago, LETS GOOO!!!
This vid was banging good job lads.
Ethans dad and we don’t enter the robot that would’ve been deadly 😭
That Donny’s teeth are mad yellow
This video was SICK
I like how in the first scene jj goes straight for the chicken
Chris was on smoke when he made the joke about Ethan’s dad
What a video
Sidemen Robot Wars 2 needs to happen now 😭 This was such a cool video
Highkey my favourite Sidemen episode ever
This is Harry’s happy place😂
28:18 Why did Vik turn into Arnold Schwarzenegger😂😂
Simon:ours goes upside down Harry:and ours does    😂😂😂
They gave the Golden daddy metal objects to destroy whilst they give plastic objects to the Tanderizer...lol
Sick vid
Round 2 split into teams of two and do a fatal 4 way battle!!
Part 2 mate
33:58  Tobi: Get the microwave, thinks it got off easy  Lmao
tis is a better sunday so far, only competitor is the silent library episode
This was too sick lads
MAUL DIDN'T DIE FROM BEING CUT IN HALF
the classic power vs speed
this is one of the best sidemen sundays.
Gave me Zoey101 Vibes ngl,  a banger yet again! #Sidemen
Chris is such a great guy😂
Clicked so fast my comment came later
The robot guy has the dream jpb
should have built a robot that arms that swing like ksi, would have been funny af to watch
Team 2: Has fully formed and designed robot Team 1: *EGGBLADE*
man cant lie, i ordered a macies as soon as i saw thew beggining
Didn’t know Joe Weller can build robots
Wow i really didn't think the tenderiser would ve able to take those hits
Tbh It's kinda more sidemen content not for the main channel 😂😂
lowkey need a part 2   3,4 and 5 of these.   what a banger
Darth Maul actually survived
This feels like a reality TV show now lol
They were arguing about whether tenderized was spelled cooler normally, with and s, or wrong and with a z. But tenderizer is spelled with a z normally Ethan...
FINALLY I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THIS
Robot wars fan: YESSSSSSSSSSS
Dead video
Waking up to a sidemen video is the best thing ever
great video
Shame my life’s a mess and I will not have the funds to get sideways that looks peng
Been waiting
We need a sequel
Your guys videos are so good lately
2hrs ago niceee
Great video, the fight was a bit anti climatic tho
Big Up the people building the bots! mad cool
Simon: ‘but did (Darth Maul) die or did he just get cut in half?’   Simons seen The Clone Wars everyone
The most underwhelming fight ever😂😂
bamzooki vibes
World class idea , loved it boys ❤️
Real star wars fans know darth mall survived getting cut in half. Soooo 2 spinners is technically correct there.
Amazing video 🔥
39:00 aint no waY a bolt just fell out..

I remember a while back on the reacts channel they reacted to robot wars and someone said “we need to do our own robot wars” and they really did it! Amazing vid!
banger
When the big robot comes out   Ethan: "Why do the military not have this!" 💀
Bro imagine if Harry did a fifa 22 player career mode 🤔
31:38 did vik just say what i think he did
This is is the sickest!
Been waiting for this ever since yous did the reaction vid for robot wars
These videos are actually just getting worse by the week
such a banger, the golden daddy was no match for the tenderizer
We need a part two with beta squad
claim your here "before 1 million views ticket here"
Not gonna lie I enjoyed this way more than I thought I was going to.
We want part 2 of this already
Robot wars was my Childhood. Madness
Big, big W for OG's of robot wars
10:34 Ksi makes a animal cell
darth maul survived past the clone wars and into the beginning of the rebellion
Finally
Actually darth mall didn’t die he lived and came back in the clone wars and died in Star Wars rebels
778,275th
Thanks for the flash warning ⚠️
OMFG I CANNOT WAIT TO WATCH THIS. This was my fave thing to watch growing up
Finally
7:35 anyone else notice JJ go to say golden beerus 😂
Lmao tobey just doesn’t like violence, tries to stop the damage a second after they would destroy the microwave and tv
3:28 i can hear harrys german impression
Do SIDEMEN SCRAP HEAP CHALLENGE i used to love that show
JOSH IS THE REAL OG _Period_
Defs a Top 3 Sidmen Sunday !!!
No way sidemen are sponsored by pepsi max
That was pure epicness.
No joke, when The Golden Daddy hit the washing machine my quality dropped to 144p
What a video!
Big up the whole crew who helped design and make their ideas come to life!
Paid all that money and both weapons broke down instantly in battle haha
The banging in the background is unnecessary
7:34 surprised JJ didn't call it Golden Frieza lmao
Hi
So your telling me 1 hour before this they were litrily watching like a boss moments
my man has some yellow teeth
Possibly the best sidemen sunday ever production wise. Need a part 2
This was a great video! Really entertaining
Sorry i cant the teeth 💀
Banger
bro why didn't they just make carbide or apollo
Vik is Genius Man!!
Should do destroy build destroy!!
When one team is smashing up TVs, washing machines and microwaves then there's the other team getting so hyped over smashing up childrens toys lol
29:35 yo when I saw how fast and how sharp that thing was         like bruh     31:20 bruh
A good name: The Godfather
YESS! Ngl- that was the best episode of Robot Wars I've ever seen!
Idk I like The Abusive Father I think that’s a banging name
Bro a sequel of this video would be sick
When vik said it needed to be more offensive I was really expecting Harry to come n stick a swastika on it
Lowest views for a sidemen Sunday in 2 hours for a long time but doesn’t deserve it. Quality vid 👍
simon big brain, darth maul didnt actually die, in the series the clone wars and rebels darth maul is still alive
Ethan father 🤣
dude that BOSS robot looks like Travis Scott  :3
make a part two in the future!!!!!
Everyone claps their hands and josh went for the belly taps hahahah
The outdo tho
That egg blade is no yolk 🥴
Ayo Pause 3:27, what u doing there harry?
cannot believe I actually packed Messi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8JH3AhTV7Y&t=48s
Been wanting this one !😝
38:08 that's what she said
SICKKKKK video idea waiting for part 2 ALREADYYY
I remember watching the sidemen reacts robot wars and they said they would do this, the sidemen really make things happen
Sidemen Formula 1 please as next video
Ayeeeeeee
Transformers certainly has changed the last time I saw it.
Jj a sell for not passing the sticks
I beg y’all make a part 2
Legendary!
Ksi should've called it golden frieza
Nice
Someone did a super thanks?😂
If it want for the smart people even Vic couldn't have made a robot
Extremely lame man
DO MORE !!!
jj getting so gassed over robots is acctuly so wholsome ngl.
100 thousandth like
Omgg this was so hilarious 💀💀😂😂😂
Those Robots looked sick!
Was sick. Beginning and middle were kinda long, skipped through the video and watched the end.
Jj:Darth maul was way cooler Chris:Historicly he wasn’t successful  🤣
This should be an Olympic sport
never clicked so fast in my whole life
They really missed the opportunity to call it the “tender-riser”
Sick.
Real ones know this idea came from the sidemen reacts video
Already want a second one of these. Brilliant video, would love to see one with smaller teams like pairs which could also have randy, lux, freezy in aswell. Would be so good
It’s a crime we only got 5 minutes of robot combat 😔still a great n funny video, jus love seeing these lads enjoy themselves n happy
That fight was so anti climactic lmfaoo😭😭😭
These video ideas 🔥
How ironic… The Tenderizer got tenderized 💀💀💀😂😂😂
Did pepsi sponsor this
I love how I get to reminisce about my childhood with these guys, I can’t see what they pull out to the bag next. Keep up the good work lads 👍
THIS WAS SICKKKKKKKK
Big Sponsor from Pepsi
As soon as I’m on break from work
Vik:draws a very good scientific drawing Jj: draws a circle 😂
Andy looks like clay from 13 reasons why
that was sick
They should do battle bots and donate some of their winnings to charity...if their bot is good enough to win
Absolutely lovely the childhood is back
Loved the vibe of the vid from the start, keep it up guys
Sidemen video idea: Beach day Swim race  Sand castle Wtvr just do something at the beach
Lets go tenderizer 😈😮‍💨😮‍💨🥶🥶🥵🥵🥵
The Tenderizer vs The Golden Daddy 😈😍
Ethan: "cut this if we lose" Me: "well thanks..."
35:29 when Tobi says ""see what it did to the washing machine"" and ethans like :|
Team Tenderizer ftw
Well this was lame
Actual god tier content. Awesome video
Enjoyed that lol :D
I want my money back!  I was promised 15mins of robot wars not 5!
KSI sold that so hard
If golden daddy didnt lose his egg spinner i rate he would have won even with jj in control, those spinners are lethal, there used to be one on robot wars called hypno disc or something like that a small rectangle with a spinning blade and he was elite, sick video though
as if they actually did this!!!
Sidemen: good idea Also sidemen: EXTREME
so happy to see ChrisMD this week!
Love the Sidemen so much this video bangs!
This is so sick
I was disappointed when Jj’s robot lost that fast
Omd yes remember the reacts vid this was brought up in lessgooooo
Who came up with this idea? fucing robot wars boring AF, luckly sidemen are entertaining.
How is barely anyone talking about eatsides 🤤🤤🤤
They gotta do this again
6:45 LMAO I CANT
Who all skipped to the last part
More of this please👌superb sidemen Sunday
The ramp felt like the difference here
Sunday dinner watching sidemen thee best
bruh they actually did this
the robots were sick
Axe on wheels vs spinny thing Welcome to sidemen lol
I'm freaking ignoring this in my reco while watching moresidemen only to find out this is the new one lmfao, gotta watch it now
They should have built tombstone  Forgot they did........ Kinda
I love how toby instantly shakes the enemy teams hand after his team lost, so wholesome
Tbh vik is a fuckin genius , that idea of a adding the slope in front was the game changer
" In the red corner after finally getting the milk, Ethans's Dad "
This was so sick.
DO. THIS. AGAIN.
do one of these actually way 110kg they don't seem that heavy
here before 10M
9 min in and my nose starts bleeding like hell, the world was trying to stop me from being entertained and I bled throughout my house and stuffed my nose w tissue, we resuming entertainment now. What a roller coaster
JJ looks like he’s lost weight.
Maaaan
Incredible video 🔥
We need another one of these, this was amazing
42:44 🤣
Im 100% sure that these robots can overtake North Korea’s military
Bruh what is this thumbnail 😭 just show the actual bots
Golden daddy had nothing on Daddy Zerk
Gold one looks like a fidget spinner
Whats the point of the video if they didnt even build the robots? Doesn't that defeat the whole point.
the fight was so underwhelming, reminds me of logan paul vs Ksi
Bruhh imagine if the British military had these machines
Yo they actually did it🔥🔥🔥
Toby >>>> most boring sideman
If the golden team could drive better the would have definitely won that 😂😂
And now everyone’s gonna go watch robot wars
What do robot wars and Valtteri bottas have in common? They both like hitting things.
tbf the build up was hype but the main weapons broke so early so it was kinda dead
This has Big Hero 6 Vibess!! !
Darth maul survived btw
I'm so annoyed they went with golden daddy instead of the sugar daddy
Big man Tommy T got that drift from gta
Great video.
I absolutely loved robot wars so this was so great , so great to watch the ideas and battle.
THE INTRO
godd damnn that guy who designing the robots whatever hes doign mans teeth are yellow asf
Well that was underwhelming
Isn’t a sidemen sunday without Simon crying being a salty looser 🤣
WHAT IF THEY ALL EACH CREATE THERE OWN ROBOT !
What's with all these fake-sidemen bot comments?
It was so funny how Jj was destroying washing machines and then Viks team was destroying plastic toys 😭😭😭
100% certain if Simon would of controlled it, they would of won. Still a solid video tho!
Ngl I skipped through almost the whole vid
Apprentice vibesss💯💯
3:28 did Harry just heil ?
Did anyone catch the discount code?
Tobi at 9:56 knowing he watched the clone wars and rebels...
The vlassic childish hoodie worn by harry. Ik that hoodie and its classix. Ik when the threw a tent in the water
Omg I saw this robot thing on tiktok and now they do it aswell wow 😮
amazing vid. what a battle
Would like this to see more of this would be ace! Different youtubers involved
That was so entertaining 😂❤
Bro… imagine if Jj’s robot shooted  out c*m 😭😭😭
We need a part 2, this video was sick
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.  #BringBackRobotWars
Too easy
Beast burger > Sides
big W
greattt
Sidemen do professional tag
44:56 is that the guy from one direction at the back
*SPOILER* Wanted viks team to win from the start but when I saw the robots in combat I had doubts. Glad they pulled through
Those Sides look delicious
42:45 the dub moment
The robot guy looks like side from toy Story
Id called the golden robot goldmember
VIK looks so smart with glases
The disk stopped working when Chris rammed into the wall the hammer was totally useless
jesus someone tell that guy to brush his teeth
Jj actually aint fat rn wth
I use to watch these videos all the time!
best video ever
viks fault
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the behind the scenes and work that went into these robots ! Amazing
tf is harry doing at 3:27
Epic video! Hope there will be a "SIDEMEN EXTREME ROBT WARS 2"! GG WP
Guys. I’ve just found the sidemen a few days ago and this is my first same day sidemen Sunday. Let’s gooooooo
On God jj and Simon is the best sidemen combination 🙌
cool video
Colchester
the tenderizer was too bulky for the egg blade
Big Sidemen Daddy beats golden daddy any day
Am i the only one that thinks that the robot guy from the beginning looks like a ghost? like he's never seen sunlight.
REMATCH!!
Harrys so thicc now😂
This is gonna be mad
I would make a robot that shoots a net at the other one and then takes their time destroying it with a hammer
blade died from that impact on the wall
Blaming faulty engineering
Is it only available in the UK at the moment (EatSides)?
Thank u sidemen for making eatsides halal the Muslim community appreciate u
Absolute Banger!!!!!
They should make another one with fan suggestions
I feel like the video could have been so much more EPIC if the editors got the time and made an epic montage and just cut away all the bits wher they are waffaling
Hi community
Sundays are the best days!
Sidemen always making 🔥🔥🔥 content
Is it just me that thinking that looked like a quality washing machine 🤨
An absolute banger
Very sick but theres some diirtyy welds. Not super pretty
Me knowing Jj was gonna say ethans dad💀
No discount code??
The first part sounds and looks like a ad for the burgers
Ksi fk it up
More of these!
I thought it was terrible until 30:30 😂😂😳
Def want a #2 they need a rematch
Josh was the MvP
Awkward when Darth Maul actually survives…..
Now we need a giant beyblade battle
Jj sold
Tobi was so gassed!! The handshake was also very nice to see, even tho his team lost ❤
Definitely want to see another one of these
Do sidemen mock the week and get either daire o Brian or Stephen to host
Amazing video, i wish the fight lasted a bit longer but still was a very good video 👏
Bring back sidemen tinder. Anyone else for that idea
This was sick!
Those engineers had 2 months to make these and both of their robots have their weapons fail immediately. PATHETIC!
I’m sad
OHHHHHHH THEY DONE ITTT, SIDEMEN ARE MASSSSIVE
Genuinely one of the best Sidemen videos ever 🔥
Best video yet
Havnt even got 1 second into the video and I already know this is a banger
Josh‘s driving skills were mad. Big moves from big josher
One of the best Sidemen Sundays in a long time.
I'd be down to see a Sidemen Extreme Robot Wars 2.
can't explain how much I loved this video!!
This was sick, we need part 2 with bigger "house" styled robots
That was close vikk 44:41
A Chris md feature nice, also they finally did the robot wars idea
We need a second one this was sick
I saw a clip of this on tiktok and went straight to this video
Great video idea but the end result was very disappointing tbh. All that build up for what was basically 2 mins of nothing
Vik & Josh in the same team .surely they will be a winner...
Baffles me how this show hasnt made a comeback bbc are idiots
9:55 they’re laughing but simons actually right maul survives😂😭
Ethan, vik, josh and harry: making a legit robot  Simon, jj, chris and tobi: *egg blade*
28:13 oh my
40:00 start of battle
this vid was so ded
both robots failed in one attack each I'm dead
Eat Sides Mukbang?
Im begging u to have a part 2 this was so entertaining
thats a banger !!!!
Reminds me of big hero 6 baymax 😎
Only the real ones know that Darth Maul didn’t die after being cut in half
Such nice robots but the worst welds ever
Plsss do a part 2
Ey yo fam this looks amazing
I would love to be in a Sidemen Sunday video too ❤️❤️
Viks groups goes to weapon testing with plastic toys while jj's team is over there obliterating a full on dryer 🤣🤣  I'm surprised there blade lasted as long as the other teams hammer 🤣
The boys making moves i’m so proud
Another one?
I don’t think mans in the middle has ever seen the sun or touched grass 💀
We need part 2 of this
That star wars conversation... Someone hasn't watched the clone wars and rebels series
Omg, this is just W. First I thought the tenderizer is going to win after I saw the golden daddy obliterated the washing machine I thought there's no hope but the tenderizer came in clutch! Big W. Banger video as always Sidemen.
W vid idea
Side plus gonna hit this week
Alternative title: Improving methods of heavy lifting
Crazy how Simon doesn’t watch Star Wars but was right about earth maul surviving
we NEED this to be a series!
Damn they really did it like they said in the reacts vid
It’s a shame the mallet and the blade broke immediately but it was a good fight
amazing episode!
Best Sunday video in a while let’s goooooooo
I swear the big robot looks like Tavis Scott
This would’ve been better if the robots didn’t die immediately
YESSSS
THEYVE DONE IT
AyO!
JJ:That looks ded that looks finish TOBI:OH IT'S QUITE NICE
Legit feels like I'm watching Netflix
Went to go see the actual Robots live show in Coventry, mad to see this a few weeks later. Good job lads
U should sign the robots and do an auction or a giveaway would have a lot off interest
1h ago😳
I need to be on the team behind the sidemen cause every business move they've mad in the last how ever many years I've predicted!!!!!
Chris MD deserves at least a link in description. The video was a banger and he was a major part.
Those things are huge, I remember them looking so small in the videos I watched
ayo sidemen is in their prime atm
The big robot looks like Travis Scott 💀
this is quality
Soo unfortunate that both their weapons malfunction so early :( but still love this vid
Extreme robot war 2.0 is necessary now
There is no video where jj doesn’t say anything sus.
Atleast they got a likeable person in this time, Not that Tommy guy gives off predator vibes
anybody ever heard of this
TOBI MOVING MAD AT 12:53
Who dresses Chris MD
0:50 sidemen felxin on africa
“Can call it the Golden…..”, “Daddy!” Ad break
Could of called it the meat beater instead of tenderiser, I'm kinda mad
Part 2 next week
28:20 vikk " that's power" 👹👺👹
Simon was right darthmaul didn’t die at the end of phantom menace he didn’t die for another like 40 years till he faced obi wan in rebels
Bruv we fckg want part 2 this was insanneeeee omfgg
let's see round 2 with other bots
This video was too litt hahaha its crazy how us men enjoy simple thibgs like this. Woman could never see the fun in this. Us men are just too amazing 💯💯 (still love woman tho 😏)
They should deffo make a part 2 with all the boys like a tournament with 4 teams. They could learn from the mistakes
KSI be like: why he don't make a robot with a gun.......👀..............🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anyone else had a childhood moment from seeing the title oh boy robot wars was my childhood.
This is the hypest i’ve ever been
JOSH IS NICE WIT IT
What a classic
Chris ruins the vid tbh
i thought ethan’s teams one was gonna be the best but holy jjs teams one does a lot of damage, i still got my boys tho. the tenderizer for the dub
40:00 for the fight
Best robot, woulda have been another bot, saying after the mother bot gets broken or battered up, another one comes of it like a crazy little devil.😅😅
This is one of the best videos
2022 Youtubers robot wars
like for a sidemen robot wars 2 !
I wish I lived in London after seeing that
In the side eats promo Vik just stares at Ethan waiting for him to say his line 😂
Wonderful
them robot people did an amazing job!! shoutout to them, need a finale!!
They said this was gonna happen!
i’ve been waiting for this video ever since harry teased it on the reacts channel
Darth maul survived FYI
Oi bitches don't come up me!!!
I'm genuinely so sad, I really wanted and thought that JJ and Chris' team would win
vik is thriving and i’m here for it
thats one way to copy beast burgers lol
I had a sneaking suspicion that this would happen. Ever since that sidemen reacts video.
Phasmophobia fans chain
Why are the sidemen video titles always in CAPS? maybe the keyboard's broken... who knows!
A youtuber robot wars would be cool
I have been designing and building robots from cad which is amazing for people who are trying to make a model then build it or 3d printing
Yayy yurei
Let's be honest, I think we all wanted the tenderizer to win
Do a Sidemen Top Gear!
the build up was better tho.
Was nice of stevie wonder to give a hand with the welds
I have a video idea sidemen try not to be extreme
I loved how hipped Ethan was  PS: I have a duck video, a chicken video... Also a patreon
Jj is so trash 😂
why was Tobie turning it off every second
I think do it again with four teams
Tenderizer barely destroys plastic toys  Vik and team - this thing is lethal
Great vid
Was not expecting this as a video but omg what a BANGER
JJ's groep looked better but josh was to good on the sticks
Simon just violated Chris at the end man😆
YES!!
Now This does put a smile on my face
The man looks like a mix of DanTDM and WillNE
jj: Let's call it Ethan's Dad Chris: We just don't enter a robot that one there was a violation
That was so awesome!
Anyone watching the begging of the video all the side men are pulling funny faces soon as Brian talks…  like man this geezers breath is a mad ting
this was so nostalgic
Most creative channel
I've watched every season of robot wars like 7 times and i can say spinners are by far the best type of robot
BEST VIDEO IDEA WITH THE BEST PEOPLE. MADE MY SUNDAAYYYYYYYYYY! jeSIIUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!
I enjoy this one alot very entertaining still the end.
😅
i love how these guys cheers with pepsi and not beer
those welds made me sick
Harry apologizing for talking then continuing to talk is so funny
When JJ said “why don’t we call it the parent.” I instantly thought they were gonna put a wooden spoon,flip flop and a belt on it.🤣😂
KSI: Let's make something like this Tombstone: oh I see your a man of culture
Banger as usual
“When India and Guernsey combine...”
Tobi: that’s enough 😐
JOSH WAS COLD WITH IT
https://youtu.be/H7Pnf3GafWwl First episode on Tuesday
Finally another best content 🔥🔥🔥
39:31 agorilladaspinna
This was dope AF
That's epic content bro
This was fuckin' sick!
Sidemen are 100% cashing out, all these new things, their gone soon
Harry became german at 3:26
Intro banging as always 🙏
💣💣🔥🔥🔥
great vid
Robot wars?  They’re videos are advancing and creative  Mad respect man 🤩
This video idea is absolutely amazing, and the execution of the video as well is absolutely on point in every single way possible
please do another one soon! this was so good.
My childhood program... all i need now is sidemen Takeshis Castle
The engineers look so gassed.
simon why didnt u take control u always just criticise
Why the robot guy so White?😅
Hello
Mad looking robots, but is it,  ‘bring your nan to weld day’?
Jjs team was trash can’t even lie
Banger!
I’ll be waiting a year for sidemen extreme robot wars 2
Friedmen
Ethans dad lol what an old joke but that was so well placed chris needs to get of MD
Honestly hope anyone who interrupted their filming for this video falls down a flight of stairs. Pricks
11:53 judging from what I see I already know viks team is gonna win🤣
Anyone know where Josh's top is from?
I absolutely loved this
Sick vid we want pt 2
So this is why rock beats scissors…
I’m actually overwhelmed at who won, completely unexpected those results were
This is an S tier video
Anyone else remember the reacts vid where they got the idea... TBH I didnt think they would pull it off
The golden daddy has potential to be a great robot for robot wars
42:44 i rewatched that 20 times. lmao😹😹
9:52 people who watched clone wars: hell nah
best sidemen sunday of the month
Once again we have KSI taking out the K in his name with an egg shaped blade.
I love how the other one struggles to destroy a toy there's golden daddy just destroys washing machine like it's nothing
🔥🔥
YESSS robot wars big up
Ay I could tell this was gonna be a good vid from the start
The Ethan's dad idea lmao
ngl we watch 40 mins for them to break instantly
I think we can all agree if the blade had kept working the golden daddy would’ve won
Jj group won
Robot wars was so sick back in the day
Class video
it was a mistake to put the big brains vikk and josh in the same team!! look at that planning fam!!!
The guy who was helping build the robots and stuff defo hasn't used a tooth brush in 2 years
1:24 is like a gta cutscene 😂
Lol I thought Ilkay Gündogan was cooking their food at first
They need To make Onther vidio about this
This is up there personally with one of the best videos, WE NEED A PART 2!!!!!!
Niceee one tbh. This is soo good
Pt2 pzzzzz
This was an awesome video.  Was not expecting that result though
Cant wait for the next Sidemen Robot Wars
THIS WAS DONE  IN COLCHESTER  SIXTH FORM
Technically Darth Maul came back in the Clone Wars so no he didn’t die
that robot guy is honestly so sound props to him for making and sorting the robots
Best video possible.
the beginning gave me Sidemen Show flashbacks
This was incredible. I beg this video bangs so they do a part 2.
Need a part two for a rematch
Certified banger❤️
I hope they do a tournament of this
Get Tom Holland in a vid
Ethans robot name should be called "THE MASTERBATUER" AS IT BEATS MEAT 🥩
This definitely needs a part 2 as well this was madd
By far the best sidemen sunday  Like this goes on top and sidemen holiday drops to 2nd 🖤🔥
Yo battlebots was such a banger. Loved that show and now we got the sidemen doing it!
Lol the golden daddy 😂😂
love to see it
Great video overall just a bit sad all the action happened in 5 minutes
Best episode ever
rematch when?
Banger upload!! 🔥🔥🔥
I would be fuming if jj's group won coz they weren't even trying yet vik's gave thought la and time tbh
The egg blade is technological innovation at its finest
Dang yall. Came excited for the new video, leaving excited for chicken 🔥
Love this
17:30 did a blind man Weald 😂
Pretty sick episode
who would like to see a sidemen go kart race ?
Yet another banger
Loved this show growing up. Absolutely smashed it lads
This was so sick
I knew this was the Sidemen Sunday when I heard Ethan say he smashed robots on Sidecast yesterday
18:54 ETHAN REALLY SAID SUBMISSIVE AND BREEDDABLE HAHAHA
Tobi is so scared of his robot
Gonna need a part 2 with new guests 🔥🔥🔥
If u wanna see where they fight here it is 40:01
19:29
this be looking like a real tv show
I’m a massive fan of the sidemen, but this was boring I can’t lie
a better name would've been "The Meat Beater"
Vik's drawing was so sick!!
THEY DID IT LETS GO
I would like a 2.0 of this.
no one:   JJ and Simon: always sat next to each other whenever possible  issa a joke btw
3:27 German moment
Well, we all can say the golden daddy got tenderized!
That was really fun, every boys dream.
need more
great video
Like fr, why does Simon always need to have rude comments? Just piss off m8
Vikkstar: *scientific explanation of why their robot is perfect + pretty cool drawing*  KSI: *E G G B L A D E*
I didn't expect to enjoy robot wars so much! 🔥
Simon losing on purpose so Chris' dream comes true? A wholesome moment in a video about smashing stuff
Great timing for the video 😂entertains me while I wait for the Cowboys
Simon's face when JJ said leak sperm.....
zed looks cooler
I thought the Golden daddy would get annihilated until they showed the blade, but they still got annihilated LMAO
Sadly boring Sunday
I think that’s the first time I’ve ever seen someone’s teeth more coloured than his skin
OMG NO WAY
ROUND 2!!!!
I have a new level of respect for Josh now  Tommy T 🔥
Oh my god the first bit of this show was like I was there with the 4k resolution and the really good camera that was filming it!! 👍🤩🤩🤩
Absolute Banger
andy seemed like a top lad 😂
Omg what a vid
could have been a good more sidemen video... big L
SIMON AND KSI BROMANCE 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Can’t believe I’m actually seeing this 💯👌🏻
That was smooth. Funny n quality content as always. Big up👍
Maul survived so simon is still right
Not finished the vid yet but I’d be astounded if the golden daddy doesn’t win 😂😂😂
For the first time JJ had a good idea Well done JJ
Such an underwhelming finish 😭😭
Damn, only 400k views
I would actually love to see Ethan starring in movies like it just suits him a lot he should try joining the movie industry
They should've teamed up against the big one
Talk about living the life
I loved the commercial even though i usually get outraged by them.
Pog
This episode was fire lol
Sidmen on top 🥇🔝
Simon being salty blaming JJ….. loooool. Sick video tho!
00:21 that vikkstar walk
What a video 🔥🔥🔥
E
I have the toys
When are we getting Mario Kart?
I'm sorry 45 minutes and only 5 are the actual robot wars match, bit of an L
Sidemen taking it old skool.
This is the best there has to be another robot wars video both teams designing a new robot
kons done a madness
My two favourite things combined 🥺
The dude reminds me of like 2013 dan tdm
The real bots are in the comment section.
Darth Maul does actually survive, he is in Solo: A Star Wars Story which is set after the Phantom Menace.
Tommy T showing who is baddest boy in town🤣🤣
This actually ended up getting me hyped to see who would actually win lmao
this was a banger honestly
KSI should have named the robot "Yinkas' Shoe"
that was siiiickkk loved the video , wow
The robots are weak asf
😂 this was a fire video 🔥🔥🔥
This was actually sick. They need to do it again but everyone make their own robot and have like a duel and last one standing wins
I understood that reference Chris 🤓
In the first half of the fight I was like, I can’t believe the team that just drew an egg were actually going to win….but the team that actually discussed the design won as they should have.
One of the best Sidemen sundays ngl
Match of the Year : The Golden Daddy vs The Tenderizer 🤣
Vikk knows his design man came with a presentation
This was sick video 🔥 and the people who made the robots are 🐐
tobi keeps stressing over the pit, calm down bro
The video idea is amazing
why are there so many bots
I know no one cares but according to the comics, Darth maul actually didn't die in that scene. He goes on with robot legs 😂 so they've got a point.
We want among us in real life
F*ck Eat Sides. Halal meat needs to be banned immediately. Boycott Halal meat
https://youtu.be/mme5SihteDE
‘The Chef’s Kiss’ would’ve been a banger name for JJ’s Team’s Robot
If your in one hour crew like this comment
Ngl I sprung up my seat when Josh's team won lmao
Great vid 🔥🔥
That burger montage was everything 👌
Vik: scientifically analysing the robot using clever words  JJ: drawing an sunny side up
We need round 2 ( best of 3)
this is class content
Sidemen apprentice??
Banger 🔥🔥🔥
How has Chris md blagged a career, the guy is a drip
Love the vid 🤙 but who did the welding on these it is not that good
Cant believe the robot guy went with the sperm slip, was sooo funny lol
His teeth got me squinting 😂
Banger
Harry supporting tgf childish hoodie. Respect:📈
Didn’t know dantdm worked with robots
I swear the Sidemen are one of those people that can start any business and be successful
An instant classic
simon threw he was the best on the team
JJ actually pisses me off man
One of the bangers fs
this video is a banger
The Golden daddy got Tenderized!
Why are the sidemen only doing old cancelled British shows lmao
Had to watch it in slomo
SICK video
Hiiii
Always hitting the like button before I even watch... ❤
Havn't watched the video yet but i know this will be one of the best they've evver made
I miss the old robot wars. Craig Charles Goated that show
Great video, just a shame the fight was over before it started
20:40
I’m no welder but those weld could use some work
Yessir another banger like usual
part two
Bro Sidemen gonna have their own Netflix in 10 Years 😩❤🙌🏼
Must have been Vik's idea bc its boring, we want romantic videos like speed dating
Always improving the edition and video
HOLT SHJT A RESTURANT?
Waiting for this since sidemen reacts
This was actually sick would love to see a part two tbh
Before I watch, I hope to god they don’t use a hammer cuz those always suck
JJs team seems like theirs was made to destroy the other one lol. Vik qnd them were crushing plastic toys, and the other was ripping apart washers lmao
Who else got hyped 🤣
I BET THIS WAS THE GUY WITH THE STINKY BREATH THEY SPOKE ABOUT IN THE MUKBANG
Tombstone😎😎
Great timing sat here with a dominoes bout to watch the boys
Can't lie the robot at the end looks like something from Transformers
One of my favorite sidemen videos
Team Can grow a beard vs team cant grow a beard
0:57 anyone notice how they were holding on their laughs before Ethan even said anything😂😂😂
war robots
poor tobi
YEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH BABY! This video had a long time coming. YES NOW BITCHESSS!
I can't lie that intro made me Hungry as hell😂
I know I’m having for dinner next sidemen Sunday
guys, whats that color palate on the hoodies that ethan, tobi  wears? teddy fresh copy
Currently 14:00 minutes in, judging the engineers reactions. there is no way JJ's team wins.
Was like watching a Jeremy Lynch video with that Pepsi advertising.
Star wars fans all over the world throwing hands at 9:52
They gotta keep doin this
what is that noise JJ makes at 32:08 LOL IM ROLLING
This for some reason felt like a relative TV show
I seriously think after this vid sidemen must have realized. It was not worth it. For sure. So much time, effort, money but they don't have the skill to make robo war interesting.
love this and its a good concept
This is actually mad
Real quick can we appreciate how much the sidemen actually do for the fans putting in 30- to 90 minute videos every week and also the side channels a long with their own channels
Massive banger
Banger video! One of the most entertaining
That was sick
That arena is sososo cool :0
That was incredible!
Golden Daddy was strong we all saw what it do to microwave and washing machine, but Josh banged it he was so sick.. 🔥
I don’t care what anyone says robot wars was 10,000% better when Craig Charles from red dwarf was on it. Once the reboot happened much like COD it was garbage after that
This gave me the sidemen show vibes
Why did this remind me of the Zoey 101 robot wars episode 🤣
Was Tobi in this video
That was an insane  fight Actually thought the Golden daddy would've won
WHY DID THEY GIVE THE CONTROLS TO JJ AND NOT TO SIMON????
nah this video is a banger
the way simon actually has right about darth maul without realizing
Jj new what robot they had befor the battle thats bang out
Who else realised only the black guys are wearing black shoes everyone else wearing white 🤯
2 v 2 | 2 v 2 2 v 2!!!  4 v 4?!?!
Ligit fun!!
My robotics teacher right now: 👀
No one gonna mention the welds on those robots…
No matter what the video, its great to see Chris
the guy in the red hoodie looks so innocent and happy idk why
Simon  gets so much undeserved hate. In my opinion he actually is one of the funniest sidemen
This video was honestly a madness, so sick, outdone yourself on this one lads would’ve loved to see more rounds tho
mans teeth are yellowwwww
I’d make a double sided spinner so tombstone but on two sides
28:19 viks inner indian came out
the problem with the golden daddy is its only got 2 wheels so the handling is much more difficult
9:53 Simon raises a good point, Darth Maul didn’t actually die from getting cut in half
they need to do a part 2
I wish KSI named it golden Winden
for a split second i thought the chef was eddie hearn
The designer was such a legend 🙌
THEY ACTUALLY DID
Shoulda been a 2v2v2v2 tournament
Andy needs to brush his teeth
Should do a Scrap heap challenge video, like the old programme, 2 teams get put in a scrap yard and have to build a vehicle fit for challenges out of old vehicles, cars/bikes everything
Sick vid
That actually was mad. I want to see other videos like this
We need more video of this
Great vid
we got the first scene of big hero 6 right here
Anyone else clock the welding
golden daddy for the win!
WE NEEEEEDDD MOREEEEEE OMGGGGGGG LOVED ITTTTT!!!!!
If only they could get Jeff bezos
Need a rematch vid soon
jj: Let's call it Ethan's Dad Chris: We just don't enter a robot that one there was a violation
YES
yo sidmen movin mad they have 3 clothing brands in between them a vodka brand now a food brand side plus like give me some money
AYOOOOOOO LETS GOOOO
Great video yet again. All bangers!
Soooo when can we get a sidemen bargain hunt?
istg ethan at 11:20 just shows how he just says and does whatever before thinking about it
Okay, an actual non recycled video idea. I'll bite.
Pt2 is needed
fars vagyok
It’s like battle bots
That was one of the best videos I have seen. i lovedd this. Never seen Robot wars.
this is the video where "fans" broke in and scratched their cars as they were leaving..
Incredible scenes 😂😂
Banger of a vid love the upped production along with the wheel
mans has yellow teeth, just saying
Didn't think this is going to be such a banger, but I found myself laughing every  two minutes!
Not Ethan's team wanting to beat the other robot like meat and JJ's team wanting to leak sp3rm😅weird connection
This was so sick
11 geeks in a video man what a record lol
8m of fighting and it was borring
Patience is key in this video
THIS IS SO MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING THAN. THE TITLE OMG SHHS
great vid
That was sick. Robot Wars is awesome, credit to the creators of those robots.
Ethan Pain 43:08
Who remembers SDMNs reaction to top ten battle robots or something like that and harry said this might become a video
DOES BRO KNOW WHAT A TOOTHBRUSH IS GODDAMN
i don't why but from the very beginning i knew vik,josh,ethan and harry will win. EZ. they were more collected , calculated and had the better driver. josh was sick.
Banging video!!
34:22 not them saying "one more for the culture" then hit it 3 times 😭😭🤣
This is so sick not gonna loe
The start of the vid is how I would imagine a sidemen thanksgiving
Anyone else see JJ preform in Birmingham last night
That 3rd robot is terrifying 😬
THAT WAS AWESOME
38:50 true actually, if they are making these for videos on YouTube I’m pretty sure the government has real life transformers.
This is epic af this is one of the best vid u lot have who ever came up this top class
Just don't like vikk, no reason behind it tho...
Before 1 mil gang
The egg
I know I definitely won't have been the only one, but as someone who's requested this before I'm gassed to see it happen
we need robot wars 2!!!
Everyone : *Actually trying to make something.*  Simon and JJ : *Talking about Sperm and Daddy.*
The sidemen food ad was sooo good
This is amazing guys, great job!
Lots of KSIMON moments in this video
Exciting video given what happened during the recording in Colchester. Y'all make Sundays even better, especially during the football (American football) season
🔥
44:30 wtf is Josh doing lol
Rep that childish hoodie Harry
Bro imagine hanging with friends and makeing millions while doing it
OMG THEY ACCTUALLY DID IT!!!
No one: JJ: Darth more
This was a banger. I’d defo be down to watch a rematch 🔥
I’m wondering who welded those robots looks terrible
This was actually really sick
on 44:30 josh forgot where his hand was and started clapping on his stomach
I love how no one tell which team win in comments but I didn't think the red team going to win 🤣
He should have said nice soup at the beginning hahha
golden frieza was right there
This was so sick
4:02
This was so cool
Ethan is loveing this did know he would be so etudiastic over robots 😂
Underrated video
The constant comparision between both the teams whiteboard had me in tears... 😂😂😂
We need a part 2 of this
sidemen are genius
the tech guys teeth are so yellow
11:21😂
y'all really out here living my childhood dreams
Everyone screaming at JJ in the end is DEFINITELY a Sidemen Classic 😂😂😂
Nice
I remember when Harry said this would be a good video idea on the react channel, a fantastic video it was
one of the best sidemen Sundays
Best day of the week🤧😭😭❤️
Am just saying if Simon drove they would win
9:50 simon with the star wars knowledge bc DM doesn't die and just gets robotic legs xD
I was hoping to see the golden daddy to tear through the tenderizer lol
Such a sick video, better be a sequel sometime next year!!
What a video lads!! Now we need a sequel :D
Josh is a smoooth operator.
Lol It’s like that one Zoey 101 episode 😂
One like on my comment?
Swear pepsi did not sponsor this video
JJ: why is everyone doing better than me?  . . . Also JJ: *uses only one stick to play*
This was the most anti climatic fight ever
Yaaaaaasssss the tenderizer
i kinda hate how the video is 15 mins of designing the robot, 15 of practicing then 10 mins of the actual battle
If Chris was really a Star Wars expert he would indeed know that Darth Maul survived being cut in half only to return in The Clone Wars animated tv series
Josh was fire!!
This video could've been alot better they both got destroyed to fast
Can we talk about how much effort Pepsi had to put in to get Josh to drink a glass in that ad?? I know that man is LOYAL 😂😂😂
The fact that they gave JJ the remote when he was the worst
this was an actual banger
The sidemen look fresh with their haircuts
I love that they left in the laughter in the promotion 💀
this was such a sick video!
Ethan and vick taking charge  Ksi team jus jokes taking nothing serious
KSI came up with the egg blade idea and I was like how did this guy make a song with Lil Wayne and later in the video I say why. his ideas are dumb but they work
42:46 Josh's giddy laugh is amazing
Yo after watching that washing machine destroyed, I thought for sure the golden team was going win, but the underdogs came out on top
the guy who is the robot expert really got gold teeth
This is amazing!!
3:27 harry hailing hitler
I’m kinda offended that the sidemen didn’t know that Darth Maul didn’t die when he was chopped in half.
28:00
this was such a sick video!
Why’s tobi keep sayin stop it and cut it or turn it down when they’re testing it?? Bro is so boring
Thnks for making my Sunday
Ethan’s favourite word, “bro”
Make more wwe
josh is so underrated, pleased to see him glow in this vid. he fr don’t get enough appreciation
,l,
This is sick. This better be an annual thing at least
Sidemen honestly have the best videos on YouTube rn, they put in so much effort to make them as good as they can be.
Sidemen Sunday a banger 🔥🔥
This is hands down one of the best sidemen sundays
Never been so excited for a sidemen sunday not gonna lie really hope someone builds a drum spinner
16:51 is when they start to introduce their robots and test them, 37:26 is when it starts to get crazy
If I was never a fan of destruction, I am now!! 😤😤
crazy content
This was a banger!!
Ethan and vik going crazy in this one 🤣❤️
this is the American way to spell it! 14:05
Sidemen clothing, sidemen vodka, sidemen burgers  What's next cars?🤣
SIIIIICKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
That food man
the subtle album plug by JJ😂😂😂😂😂
PART 2!!!
thought this was gonna be boring af, but at the end I was yelling for the tenderizer, let's gooooo
This, cinema summary AND blarg video, easy night in
Josh really goated on the sticks
3.7k in the first 1hr
Tommy T with the drving skills
we need a part 2
Pt2 now
Finally
sidemen sundays make my day better fr , i’m going through a heartbreak but these videos make me happy
:
Josh is natural in everything he does.
chrisshitatfootball
Can confirm was in Colchester the same time the sidemen filmed this. I was so close to charter hall.
Chris did him dirty 6:45
I hope they do this again
Who’s idea was it to name it EATSIDES? 😂😂😂
Ayyy, this bangs!
Christ Ethan had meat head energy in this haha
I first seen robot wars on zoey 101. Who else?
The welds on the robots got me cringing. Great video though!
darth maul died because he didnt have a golden lightsaber
I like how vik and Ethan took everything over😂
Jjs team was too smug for me before the battle, pulling for the other guys lol
Sidemen can make any videos funny!! Swear down
The golden daddy had the ultimate offence but no defence
Kinda annoys me how Simon was the best driver but didn’t want the face the pressure of being the driver. Me and my mates would love to do something  like this and he just throws the change in the bin
We want a part 2
that was actually sick
We need a part 2, this was such a banger. One of the best Sidemen Sundays for sure.
10:27 well done, JJ that’s called an amoeba.
I haven’t enjoyed a video this much in a long while😂.
It was so funny how they cut between Vik and Ethan cheering when their robot destroyed plastic and JJ and Simon's team destroying a washing machine.
This video was entertaining asf
Tommy T getaway driver
Simon : " DO THAT !! NAH DO THIS ! While me : "Just go get the controller  bro"
I dont know how none of them made an egg pun
if i dont get robot wars 2 i am failing this semester on purpose
Washing Machines arent actually that sturdy
6:13 that random hair
I didn’t get a notification and I was scared the sidemen sunday was cancelled
Huge video!!!!
Banging this ngl
Golden Daddy: appliances to destroy  Tenderizer : plastic toys
obviously jj goes for the chicken first
Such a banger video! Big up the sidemen
Sidemen sunday is the best🤩🤩
Well that tucking sucked
sup
For real can yous just do this every week that was so sick hahahaha
Huge applause to Joshs driving. He was able to beat that robot with their crappy one
We need Gordon Ramsey on a Sidemen Sunday video judging the Sides food.
Jjs team must win
A video we didn’t know we needed 😍
a mukbang to start off the video XD
22:48 Harry can't keep his tongue in his mouth when he focuses lol
Please make a "EXTREME ROBOT WARS: THE SEQUEL"  this was honestly one of the funnest sidemen sundays Ive watched.
Team JJ needed a backup plan for if the blade stopped spinning. They had the other robot for speed and movement. gg
Banger
both robots were so bad lol
Someone please make an anime of this
Darth Maul isn't dead. He's alive because of Dave Filoni
actual fight was so disappointing lmao. Both broken within seconds.
.
this was the greatest comeback
I remember them talking about doing one during a reacts... This is nuts
Ending so good
epic vid
anyone know the music playing at 6:30?
i clicked the vid because there was no food in the title and iam hungry, 10 secs later, jj and the boys eating this magnificent meal and iam just here like 😐
That was too sick boys loool
We need a part 2 of this haha
AYOOOO for real why is Josh so cold on them robot wars sticks!!
simons not even met the guy for 5 seconds and has already made it extremely awkward😭😭
I mean Darth Maul did die, just years later in the desert of Tatooine lmao   Still at the hands of Kenobi though!
I have never clicked a video faster
The golden daddy is no match for The Tenderizer!!!
Amazing🔥🔥... Takeshi's castle next ....🙏🙏🙏
Yeah my future son, dad's early
This was sick
ayoo this is big leagues energy i loved this sooo much
3:26 ayooo Harry WTF??!!?!?!
sidemen makes me laugh atleast 3 times every video 😂
What a timing what a video what a day👍👏
Apart from music I dont thnk jj is good at anything 🤦😂😂
The tenderizer is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No lads, darth maul didnt die. Watch the clone wars 😂
Does this remind anyone else of the show Battle Bots
Krishna krishna
Why is nobody talking about the resterauny at the start?
Miss 1 hour uploads
How doe's ethan have that hoodie we're the main part is blue ? The one on SDMN clothing is pink in the main part ?
The British Mr Beast fanboys at this rate
JJ's team absolutely annihilating microwaves and washing machines and then cutting to vik hammering plastic wheelbarrows is the funniest thing ever
I just love these lot so much
make a good video
Ngl I thought they were done for when the hammer broke
10 year old me is happy ... thanks guys
the production levels are going up every video
I can only see a black screen :(
This video is a banger, hillarious.
Banger
the sidemen are so LIT! LOVE YOUR CONTENT;)
Don't know about the design but we believe in josh
Bro this video is banger
The difference between planning of both teams. Vik's team : how expect my team to strategize. JJ's team : what truly happens
One of the best Sidemen Sundays!!!
Who remembers when they got this idea from a SidemenReacts video?
Jeez the videos lately are straight bangers. I mean all ur videos are bangers but these new ideas🔥
My man look like mustycow
Banger vid
Dosent andy look like dantdm with out the glass and the small beard
im the same age as these lads and robot wars was a major part of childhood tv
This is so entertaining. I didn't want to video stop.
:)
I swear to god i recommended this video idea
They actually did it
What an amazing vid
That guy probably had the time of his life. Its nice how they invited him in.
This has the old school YouTube originals vibes
Unfortunately this sidemen Sunday was an L
Yoooooo this is so sick!!
!
0:21 Vik walking in like a unit
I've never seen vik so violent or aggressive... * flashbacks to among us and piano chair *
This is quality, talk about underdog story!
I live in Australia so I get sidemen Monday’s instead of sidemen sundays, it honestly makes Monday so much better!
Tommy t took over josh while driving
Jake Paul vs Tommy Fury ain't gonna be as good as Golden Daddy vs Tenderizer
BANGER
anyone else see the sidemen Sunday spoiler in tiktok for robot wars
This was one of the best sidemen videos in a minute!!
32:08
great vid good job
will eatside just be in the UK or also abroad?
Ethan when he see's Sir Killalot - 'Why don't the military have that ?'.
Moment when they talk about Darth maul and say he failed he's mission to kill every Jedi yet he still comes back with robot legs 😂😂 and he's still a beast
Love this show use to watch not on a Sunday
I like how teams are "the ones with beard" and "the ones without one" 😂
A good idea but not very good
They got the sickest ideals most unique youtubers
Why is it only 45 mins ffs
can't wait for sideeats
NGL when i saw that blade I thought the golden daddies had won this
Chris MD sold the golden daddy should’ve won
Elite video 👍
We need Robot Wars 2
Oof what a boring vid
This was so sick, honestly goated
0:36 Ah, so it's bulking season again, huh ?
I’m not even joking this is the best YouTube video ever posted
cool
C'mon the tenderizer
Vik is really good at drawing lol
I used to love this show so much and watching the sidemen do it was so fun to watch
Out of context, when was this filmed?
My mate is actually a living robot
At bro this the best sidemen sunday ever
Kind of underwhelming ngl
GONNNNEEEE CLEARRRR !!!!!!!!!!!!! Sidemen on your headtop
any others that remember the sidemen reacts video from time ago where this was mentioned?
I fully thought the sidemen would be in a warehouse just piecing things together and trying to make robots😭
The best day is Sunday when the Sidemen upload
43:11 poor ethan😂🤚🏻
Yoooooo Josh won it!!!! That was an intense battle haha. Had a good laugh. The tenderizer was underrated for sure. Love the quality content
Jj, Simon, Tobi and the other guy is testing against microwaves while Ethan, Josh, Vik and Harry is testing against toys
Part 2 part 2 part 2
This video was literally such an underdog story. I thought the Golden Daddy had it EASY with that blade but was rooting for the tenderizer all the way. The lads jumping after the win was literally me too
I NEED THE PASTEL HOODIE NOWWWW
People dont watch the full video and starts commenting about one line jokes   🤣🤣
pepsi hmm ok yh ok then nah nah it ok
Disappointed 🙂alb
Chris md!!!!
another banger as always
The title was all I needed to know this was going to be a banger.
Simon surely can't hate on JJ too much, at least he didn't refuse the controller when Chris didn't want it
never been so hyped watching a video XD
Are we not going to talk About the shittiest welding job i have ever seen😂
Sidemen here to take over the world
So sick
As a massive fan of Robot Wars and Battlebots this video did not disappoint  🤩
Nothin like a sidemen vid on a sunday evening
First the vodka, now burgers? Hell yeah
Part 2 ASAP!!
Neeky video
phenomenal
PART 2 ASAP!
Wouldnt ever associate chrismd with robots but sure
Only real ones know that they spoke about doing this before
Absolutely amazing lads
15:02 These two must be having school projects flashbacks
the 'robot man' hasn't brushed his teeth in years 😂😂
Optimus been real quiet since this dropped
Banger as usual !
The robot designer fella is jokes lol
3:27 Harry exposing his German genes.
Vik's group: Actually trying.  JJ's group: Not sure what they are doing tbh.
*Sees Title*  Me: Someone's going to get f***ing hurt.
funny man
Idk y but I kinda felt bad for Chris MD.
Ngl thought the dude had grillz lol
This is sick
yo
This was fun
I watched all that for them to loose the main weapons in 15 seconds and for literally no destruction 😂 still a good video tho
Sidemen be carrying 2021
Ayooo this is littt
This video is so cool. Perfect for my birthday :)
Vik crying in the inside he didn’t get to use it 🤣
the first 15 seconds and its already a banger vid
We need a part 2
Chris giving it to JJ to drive it instead of Simon is what made them lose 😂 expected a bit more destruction during the match but fair play, another banger video 🔥🔥🔥
Tbh I didn't think that vic and the guys wud win 🤣
Gr8 vid!!!
Can Toby not say “stoppp, stopppp and stoppp” every SIDEMEN video it’s actually getting jarring at this point
I was so happy when Team Tenderizer won😁😁😁
Yes lads! Robot wars was one of my favorite childhood shows, get in!
Who else wants to see a Sidemen Taskmaster (that TV show with Greg Davies)
Awesome Bruv
I didn't thought that Tendelizer would actually make it but that robot was so wicked ☠️
These videos bang harder.. Kon is putting some serious efforts
Lol u suck simon..hiw can u blame when u the gamer dude🤣vik was right pusio😅
Great video lads 👍👍.
38:33 why does it look like travis Scott with the hair
Now we gonna get a eatsides mukbang
Jcjcmf. F F F F  Fxuxu ft t  T Tnxhzhd F F F D .7.4
THE CONTENT KEEPS LEVELING UPPPPP 🔥🔥🔥🔥
big banger
Man like Chris drove the blade into the wall 😂😭
Yh but he got chopped in half. historically, he's not been that successful....  Had me dead
I'm glad they decided to do this, I was hoping for this
That welding doe
Broooooooo the sidemennn do a robot wars vidéo that just fking incredible
Big up Colchester !!!👊🏼😂 #essex #charterhall
well at least there is sdmn content to watch
The golden daddy is just a roomba on steroids
This reminds me of big hero 6
Shame the weapons didn’t last abit longer but still a sick video
Freya be like: 38:08
Earliest I have ever been in a sdmn video
Jj's team: gets a tv microwave and washing machine to train   Vik's team: gets some plastic children's toys to train on
No way KSI's team is winning
THIA WAS SO LIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
JJ and Simon really got jokes
This was an absolute banger🔥
this was painfully average
That was amazing
This is the first time I've seen vikk in blue jeans
The guy at the beginning seemed like he is just learning how to shake hands.
Putting Josh as driver was the best decision made all video lol
This is the most I’ve ever seen JJ use his brain
The spunkinator
The quality of these videos is unreal 👏 well done boyos
Anyone else think the Nandos Mukbang was the sidemen sunday, Did that and still uploaded this banger
Robot wars was goated
Just 45 mins come on fam
Lol the robot didn’t lose, JJ did.
V2??
Fire vid!
Wow now thats a banger 💥💥💥
Should have made the robot and put milk carton stickers on it then the name Ethans dad would of fit 😂
Would've been good if the robots actually worked
See u in Colchester
my guys teeth said 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
God I feel stupid. I was 14 minutes in until I realized the "other team" was other half of the sidemen and they weren't all there storming ideas together.
Darth Maul actually didn't die, Luke killed him between 4 and 5 I believe but it might be 5 and 6 I'm not sure
One team taking it seriously. The other team: egg blade 🥚⚔️
ChrisMd is always the best guest
White shoes team vs Black trousers team
sidemen food wtf
Why does the guy helping them sound like James Acaster
finally finished it
Banger alert 🚨
They made it happen
josh is op
a bit of a stinker tbh, keep it real
That battle at the end was better than any anime battle ive ever seen
This video had potential to be one of the best, instead they just fought the robots for 6 minutes ( they should ve made more robots and made 4 teams of 2) Personally im dissapointed...
This vedio is epic mad!!!!!
Anti climatic
How did an egg go to a killer robot?
Behz team should win this
The variety of their content still surprises mw
As a wise man once said: "When India and Guernsey combine, no one's safe" Team Tenderizer FTW!!
Kinda a let down. Both main weapons died instantly. Unlucky af for the boys
So that was anticlimactic
Love how this game from a sidemen reacts
We need this 4 times like the tinder...
This is a hype one and amazing to see new creations. Pretty cool too when Battle Bots comes back on soon.
4 elements of survival for the human race: Food Water Shelter Sidemen Sunday
This is a bangin, original, unique idea. Props to whomever idea this was.
Poor welding i must say 😂
we will need a part 2 on that 1 fam
Dank foods tho
who remembers the sidemen reacts where they randomly suggested they do this and now it’s here
3:27
Why is tobi so scared of everything
The production level on this is out of this world ✅
This is a banger that no one asked for, but everyone needed.
man the travis scott robot was a beast
More robot wars please 👍
It's funny because the only reason the blade actually stopped is because they ended up ramming the protective metal barrier that was too strong for the blade after running from the big bot at 40:55
I-
I thought the tenderizer was gonna win but I've got my money on the golden daddy now
Let's just not enter a robot for the contest 😂🤣
Jeez thats a new type of sidemen sunday
the state of that guys teeth yuck
That was 🔥 round 2 plz 🙏🏻
That was too sick, we need more
This ended up getting me hyped to see who would actually win lmao
This was actually dope
This is one of the best sidemen videos of all time, I had a smile on my face the whole video
23:02 topi sounded like my dad teaching me how to drive. Lmao
Ksi  v 20 women ?
oh man there sure are a lot of bots here :D
Vik & Ethan drawing a 3D model of the robot Meanwhile JJ: EGG BLADE
I had zero faith on team josh I mean just look at Team JJ’s robo man, what a fight 🥶
Rematch!
Ngl the final battle was the deadest part of the video
certified BANGER
2:33 that awkward laugh from Andy though
We need a part 2 for this next sidemen sundayy
When I saw the robot I already knew who finna win
its amazing that the big guy actually picked them up during the fight. Sick video!!
vik actually thought that harry meant real blood...hysterical
The fact I was the first person to veiw this is mind boggling
wish the video was longer, such a banger honestly. Rematch?
This brought back some memories of my childhood
simon is low key developing a beard, who gonna get a proper beard first? Minter or jide?
Yes lad
PLEASE do a sequel!!!!!!!!!
Harry was so gassed 🤣🤣🤣😭😭
Video Idea: GTA stunt races in real life with these robots! One each, would be unreal
Eh
Who's been here since the very beginning
We need a part 2 of this
It's really sad the fact that eatside would probably won't come here in the Philippines
worst sidmen sunday ever
Chris is goated man.. 🔥
0:15 nice robots
Oh my god. This was amazinggggg
:D
Big up the Big Brains who made the Robots.. Made it exactly as they wanted it to be.
PETITION FOR KSI VS 20 WOMEN NOW THAT HE'S SINGLE👇🏼
RoboWars is so much fun!!
Dislike

Was there a discount code ?
SIDEMEN IS THE GREATEST TEAM
Banger video well done
Chris: Does Darth maul die   Clone Wars Fans: 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
We need Chris MD more often on sidemen Sundays
“Z” is pronounced “zed” in the UK?!?!?!
When the hammer and the blade broke it was disappointing af
vik: *draws a well detailed diagram*  JJ: SO ANYWAYS I STARTED DRAWING AN AMOEBA
^AYGSDFUJOVogl[,n
banger
Buddy needs some tooth paste
Weird but great  video
We need part 2 of this for sure
Josh was cold with it when he dropped it in the pit. love it
PETITION FOR KSI VS 20 WOMEN NOW THAT HE IS SINGLE
Ayo that hammer ☠

Big banger
Their hammer was rubbish the spinny thing was op just that metal armor on the fromt was too much lmao
im in 12:00 The Tenderizer gang ➡️
This was so sick brooo. I can't believe that
This Video is perfectly made for Mr. Vikstar only LOL
Whoaaaa andy and his crew are so talented!
Think about how much longer the video would be and not jsut finsh quick all because people think it’s funny to leak the location?
17:57 all im thinking is that someone needs to go back to welding school
S teir vid
Do Among Us in real life again or football videos pls
FINALLY!!!
Sick contents man love it every video even from years ago
0:16 Kentucky Fried sidemen
In Josh I Trust
Why’d they give JJ the controller?
THIS SIDEMEN SUNDAY IS SO GOOOOD!!
Imagine Robot wars decides to use "The Golden Daddy" in the real show
9:59 he didn't die.
Part 2
This vid is so nostalgic
What ?
I remember them reacting to this 😂
VIK “like” count? 😂😂😂
Omfg Robot Wars was my favourite
hi
i legit thought the golden daddy were going to win after what they did to the washing machine
I remember them talking about this video in sidemen reacts and now its finally out let's go
Okey josh was a sick contoler of the robot
3175th comment
Ole ❤️
Years of GTA RP-ing has made Josh an excellent robot pilot
Ethan's dad jokes are immortal
Ksi was the worst and they give him the controller
Chris MD: We don't enter the competition wtf 😂😂😂
Banger✌
Ksi seems happier now, and contributing a lot more 👍
Banger
such a sick video idea lads
This is the best sidemen Sunday ever
This turned out so amazing. Absolute Banger!
We, men love robots and destruction! perfect Sidemen Sunday!
Bro there’s nothing worse than people who won’t do something cause they’re afraid to embarrass themselves, and then complain on the guy who actually does it. Everyone complained on KSI even tho they didn’t wanna do it themselves 🤔
The battle of the weapons lasted long 😅
So happy my team won
Yo did anyone know jj watched star wars?
Tommy T hacker man, drug dealer, get away driver and machine controller
Yess another certified hood banger
Tobi and Chris were looking slightly amused and extremely concerned about the sperminator lol
Simon looking like spotify
At this point , they're video ideas are insane and so fun
I’ve never been so confused at the start of a video-
This is so sick
officially my favourite sidemen video
Dam son
Sidemen are only getting worse and worse tbh
We need part 2
The tenderizer !!!!!
Im a Fidget Spinner
I was expecting a tinder video but this is crazy
Who is here when they saw the podcast
They don't seem to disappoint us on Sidemen Sundays . Loved this video 😍.
Banger of a video. Kudos to the creativity bois 🔥
that was over so quickly 😂😂😂
I love how Chris MD is just there 😂
Chris Md and Stephen are the best special guests
I have done this for my anger management classes and it's really fun
Why did I think the start of the video was ad for nandos
They got a brand deal with Pepsi as well!
so fun
Tony shut up
why were his teeth so yellow
Anyone here from Pakistan?
Just finished watching now watching again it's so good
What a banger!!!!! Yall always have good content in all ur vids. Always making me laugh.
Another great side men vid
he is so white he must be on computer all the time
JJ has just changed the ROBOT WARS industry forever with the egg design.
we need to see another video of this
I feel like I know the Sidemen so well that I honestly believe we're on a groupchat together
First Vodka, now their own food brand. SIDEMEN TO THE MOON
Yeah
Josh was sick as a driver, like they won because of him I think...
Rematch
THIS IS SUCH A BANGER OMG
this reminded me of Real Steel movie
One of my favourite shows I’ve been waiting since the suggestion came up in a sidemen reacts vid
What a sick vid
After a long time I had so much fun watching a sideman video great stuff
Ksi saying they could call it ethans dad.. I didn't catch at first but then hearing the little comment right after about the robot just not coming to the competition, kinda mad ngl💀
in the first minute and ten seconds i was so confused lol
Nah im gassed. ITS HALAAAAAALLLL
Siuuuu
Andys teeth yellow af😂
We’ve done sidemen dragons den. Next time do sidemen The Apprentice
After all that both weapons break in 30 seconds...who on earth was the idiot building these?
I’m 10x happier in life now that I know KSI knows who Darth Maul is
Need another one of this
i love both teams theyr done for they done lmao
W vid
Chris absolutely obliterates washing machine  Simon: is our egg ok 😂😂
Well done keep up the good work and please upload 2 times a week like if u agree.👍
Sheesh
What a banger sheeeesh
bruh the fact they broke in 30 seconds
I've got an extra " toothbrush "  Someone wants it?? 👀
Definitely going to do a eatsides mukbang
I love how they changed it to Z bc it “looks cooler” when that’s just how it’s spelt
sick
Who else notices how yellow andy’s teeth look like next to all the sidemen 😂😂
We do see darth maul in later films
love it
6:45 call it ethans dad, they won't see it coming.
3:26 Harry did a madness 😳
Yellow teeth
Lets be honest, they’re so consistent with the Sidemen Sundays. Its just *chef kiss*
jj: Let's call it Ethan's Dad Chris: We just don't enter a robot that one there was a violation
😍😍
JJ's team absolutely annihilating microwaves and washing machines and then cutting to vik hammering plastic wheelbarrows is the funniest thing ever
Cool intro
man uses thinkpad in 2021 not saying that jj did not activate his windows but lol
Behz: draws a robot Jj: makes a drawing to enter into a preschool art contest
What a banger
Sides is nexts weeks biggest hype Wednesday finna get my scran on big up the boys
The mario music in the background 😂
BAnging video
This reminds the old days of robot lego club because we didn’t do jack s*****, most of the students were goddamn show offs and the teacher was boring
16:00
So boring
Have a nice day if u see this comment
Chrismd was a great guest this episode👍🏻
My favourite TV show!! And my favourite YouTube channel!!! =The best video ever!
that hammer makes me think of Jay slapping a turkey
Can we just appreciate how well the guy made the robots and how cool they were
Seen ChrisMD everywhere recently
Wallahi Ethan catching strays left and right lmao
Golden daddy
36:15 vikk just happy to be involved
I was there while they were filming
The tenderizer showing up with a meat grinder and the golden daddy showing up looking like a fidget spinner, hahaha
"we have a flipper and then on the back we have a spinner" W2S 2021😂😂😂😂😂
All challenges sometimes are on fair or end up with one of them not being part of it. This might sound crazy but it would be kinda better if they had someone join the Sidemen , would be a big hype too.
This videos for us 20 and overs for sure
i knew this was coming 🤩
We need an ep. 2!
Well tbh darth maul didn’t actually die
Used to watch this programme so muchhhhh
I WANT SIDEMEN EXTREME ROBOT WARS 2 but all 7 of them make their own like a tournament
My mum (Myra Wilson) was a judge on robot wars series 4-5. This is like the only show that I can one up people on when talking about it to people. Shame that there hasn't been any new series since series 10
I wanna see a robot that has a low slung flip ramp, so it drives under other robots, and then once they're up on it, a hooked blade swings out of the shell to like throw then onto their roof and really dig in
Love these guys❤️
Vikk: How to make our robot more offensive. Meanwhile Simon: Can our robot leak...
Real ones no this idea came from a sidemen reacts
Anyone here a star wars fan that knows maul did survive getting cut in half
im Hwere
Best idea they had in a long time always epic content
Bruh This content is insane they deserve more subs
I'm just trying to figure out if my man the robot geek has ever brushed his teeth....
Is this robot wars or food wars?
Chris really called himself a star wars expert but clearly doesn't know (SPOILERS) that Darth Maul came back
this is the video they got raided i think
I think I got an idea on who JJ and Simon were talking about with the bad breath lmao
cmon
Eatsides in Canada..when? :)
Different every week another banger
Why is Tobi scared of everything lmao
Im impressed by how that robot DESTROYED that washing machine
honestly chrisMD fits in the sidemen well tho
I like how the first thing that goes to Vik's mind is bribery
w content
Happy Sunday everyone :)
Is it gonna be in South Africa? (Sides )
I like how JJ's group got microwaves and stuff but Ethan's group got toys 😂
Mans teeth looking like popcorn
Kinda cool last year was the goal to 10mil and they've almost got another 4 million now 👏
What an absolute throwback to childhood
the fact that nobody has finished this video is crazy
Yo I just watched the sidemen reacts where they watched a robot wars vid and thought of making this, and here we are.
16:51 when the robots fight
My childhood meets adulthood ❤️
BANGER
Knowing what bots usually look like, the thumbnail gives me cancer.
Lets show some love to the designer guy. He seemed like a really intelligent and nice guy!
Jj- I want robot to be gold it looks cool Robot maker- hold my teeth
“I like a blunt”  “Yea let’s tenderise they’re meat”   -Ethan Payne 2021
Who thinks of the videos they upload , the only thing I have been watching this week was these gentlemen.
Should’ve called it the Meat Beater
Can we just take the time to appreciate the amount of effort that goes in to these videos
Please keep continuing this series
Anyone else not realise Ksi was an actor in a Netflix film  I had no clue
who else feels like the sidemen second channel has better vids than the sidemen sunday
CHRISMDDDDD
My mates dad actually created the original hypno-disk can we get some hype for him?

Vik's team : begin to design robot  Ksi's team : making a name to do with a dad
sidemen always come up with fresh content
Great video … shocking welds though 😭
Jjs team should of called it the exsperminator
This is why I love sundays 😍
Another short sidemen Sunday 😑 🤪🥊
Sidemen selling every single product on the market now, feel like every industry in the future will be sidemen ran, like some sort of big brother/dictator style movie
35:48 It was at this moment that they knew they fked up
Theyre just doing side missions at this point
Washing machines live longer with calgon unless the golden daddy is about
A Flippy Robot - KSI
So much hype and drama for trash
jj: Let's call it Ethan's Dad Chris: We just don't enter a robot that one there was a violation
Fullest
At this point, the sidemen have outdone themselves Well done lads xx
the guy helping them build the robots sounds like james acaster
SideEats Mukbang
Ayo tell me why I liked because of the Sideeats ad
Chrismd finally in a sidemen vid
Up the sidemen!!!!
yes a vid about my passion I'm kinda annoyed that I'm not in the video
6:44 Chris Md just attacked Ethan for no reason.... =))))
Tinder 3  Tobi: I am never found wearing same clothes as others  Robot wars Tobi: proceeds to have the same hoodie as Ethan and wore infinite times by w2s
Marking my 13th streak of watching sidemen Sunday within 1 hour
There is definitely going to be a Sidemen Burger Mukbang
That studio in the beginning🤩
Why tf is Andy whiter than his teeth
Is Side eats halal?
It finally made it through the ideas list
my favorite comment was when Chris said, "What we just don't enter the robot in the competition?"
9:50 technically darth maul survived. So simon was right
SideEats… that’s big time
I have played badminton in that hall
Spliff nd sidemen let’s go
I like how in time ksi was trying to control the robot the other team was basically done already😂
17:57 lmao those welds are so bad
Robot wars ws my show and to see some of my fav youtubers partake in it truly puts a smile in my face
Ethan and vik got a proper axe and everything meanwhile jj got an egg 😂
Yo
Huge respect to Andy
Man I miss Robot Wars

This the video Simon was gassin about few months ago
Here within an hour ticket here
Like that ksi has a new album
the best part about simon asking if darth maul actually died is that canonically he didnt and then showed up later
Ksi plugging his abulm  Simon this is coming out in November
Isn’t this the video that some fans crashed the set
That mallet is LETHAL😭

Sidemen are big time
Who agrees with me sidemen X dropouts y'all should Collab
I’m so happy the meat grinder won
Heyy
Why does jj hold the controller so weird
Haven’t even seen the vid yet but from the title it’s a banger
The welding on the robots looks like pigeon 💩 though 😂
omg! since i saw the sidemen reacts to it i hoped they would make it. thaaaaaank yall
Finally
They improved so much it’s actually crazy 🔥👏🏼
Did anyone else see Simon shaking the guy's fist when he tried giving him a fist bump in the beginning? I feel the pain through the screen man... make it stop... please...
1:23 walking in like a GTA heist setup cutscene
The ideas,  innovation and effort that goes into these sidemen Sundays is unmatched
Any vegan options in sides? Feesbad
Team vik & crew actually designing and brainstorming proper feasible ideas, and then we have team Knowledge.Strength.Intergrity out here designing THE EGG EGG🍳 BLADE because big brain 🧠 lol, ohhh don't forget the slippery spunk idea.
1:00 definition of “we made it bois”
That is a Sick Madness
yoooo cant believe it!! we need more of this pls!!
The sidemen always thrive in whatever they do. Love this video very much!!💙
The fact that they are in Colchester makes it better
nice to see ChrisMD giving these small youtubers a chance!
Ethan eating pisses me off and I don’t know why
Darth Maul did not die when he got chopped in half in your wondering
i love how all 4 of the other team finished test driving while jj was busy
Me enjoying the vid: Getting mad everytime i see that guys teeth
BATTLEBOTS
EatSides is hands down the most retarded name I've ever heard, love it lmao
sorry to Andy but is it just me or Andy's yellow teeth are bothering u as well
His teeth Were gold
should've made it camo and called it ethans dad
Team vik & crew actually designing and brainstorming proper feasible ideas, and then we have team Knowledge.Strength.Intergrity out here designing THE EGG EGG🍳 BLADE because big brain 🧠 lol, ohhh don't forget the slippery spunk idea.
Anything to make more money huh
This video bangs as per

Back from work, laying in my bed with my meal and a sunday sidemen video, couldn't get any better.
Sidemen Sunday!!!

Daammmmmmmnnnnnnnn I grew up watching robot wars this is going to be epic asf 🔥🔥🔥
Hi
Slip him summin tasty nah my man needs a toothbrush
i love the sidemen
is it just me or does andy look really pale
The best teams for this
Imagine if they did the sperm thing. They would have a robot that would smell of spunk and they would each know only 1/5th of the smell was theirs 😂
I love Vikk's power walk at the start lol
13:26 What a random coincidence😅
Chris and Simon debating if darth maul was alive make me happy to be a clone wars fan
YESSSBROOOOOO
Yessss love side men
Great video
Ay let’s go
That intro😂😂
Who agrees we need a part 2??!!
i've never felt so let down by humanity before
Darth maul didn’t actually die lmao 😂
Funny innit
Not my favourite sidemen Sunday but I'm for it regardless 💯
just woke up time to watch sidemen
They smashed it!
Okay I’m actually scared every single time I think oh maybe this YouTuber should do this like for example this Friday I said to myself “the sidemen should put Chrismd in one of their videos” and here we are it’s so weird
Jheeeez ChrisMDIZZLE
Best thing about Sunday’s by far🙌🏼 never fail with the content🙌🏼
11:21 clip it lmao
AWESOME
Big brain vikkstarr123
Surprised they didn’t make a roomba they destroy everything
I’d love to see this as the next YouTube trend
CHRIS MD!!!!!
I saw the title and instantly knew its gonna be a madnesss
Omg I loved this video!!!!
Not me who noticed viks fire haircut
helo der
OnE HouR GaNg
Been waiting a whole week. for 5mins of content
How do they come with some of the amazing ideas! 🔥
I was thinking jj looks bigger then usual but the start of the video was back in September
sidemen food? literally what? what's up with youtubers these days. they definitely have someone else running it cause i doubt any of them have food business owning experience. it's just regular food, if there's ever been a harder sell out it's this
No way they’ve got an Uber eats sponsor
Just wanna say darth maul survived and had robot legs
Hell yeaa🔥 Lesss gooo boyss Banger sdmn Sundays as always!
Now, iam ....... The happiest person on earth 😜🔥
KSI watching a washing machine fall right in front of him and not doing anything is soo funny 😂🤣
ksi gobbling the chicken nuggets
They made something this cool, and then they let the trainee do the welding...
How long ago was this vid filmed
Perfect timing
Damn the videos are getting shorter and shorter Everytime
Take a token a good luck Beacuse this is their best video ❤️
The reacts ideo did come to life❤
bruh that ad
Yeah
Who else is skipping to where the robots are actually fighting
9:30 Darth maul in fact did not die, but lived on for 30+ more years
Inertia is not stored energy. It's tendency of a body to maintain its state of motion.
Ethan is the most American sideman
It's cool to see the Vulure and PP3D guys in the background of the testing 😊
Guy sounds like James Accaster
really good video idea acc
Love how eatsides is coming out on my mum’s birthday
Whoever is steering the channel in the direction its recently been heading, great job. I can see your vision and from a business perspective its very impressive. Premium YouTube content seperating itself from the platforms generic mould. The content is higher quality and more entertaining than actual shows on TV. Well done lads.
I want to be the 8th Sidemen
Put one in SA please
one of first comments
Halal gang
Early
E
well they said they wanna try this
I can’t wait for this.. I’m a uni student so take away is a thing now

That guy who made those robots is so humble man, great work dude!!
Siiiiick!! Robot wars and sidemen food. Yeeeesssss I'm voting on both uber and deliveroo i need to try a burger
The thumbnail looks great I like the floating spinning blade and a literal fire laser
Last 7th video was a hide and seek  another 7 videos was hide and seek I thought it was going to be a hide and seek
Those guys changing the game very damn week!
Sidemen are the GOATS in YouTubing🐂
Finally a good video yes lads

JJ IS A LEGEND
First
3:27 Ayo what was that harry?
Looks fun
I started dying at 4:02 when they kept interrupting eachother 😂
Rare video of Vik doing most of the talking while other sidemen members paying attention to what he's saying.
Back with a another banger 🔥🔥
👍
Darth maul actually did not die from being chopped in half, he came back better
😁😁😁❤️
Simon said this is coming out in November, when did they record this I wonder
Sided mukbang coming soon
🙈
Darth maul survived
So happy they got Chris on one of these
Yes
Josh is an excellent driver
i woulda had a gasoline sprayer and a flamethrower lmfao
Tobi acts like he knows everything bro your a b*tch u can’t fight u don’t know nothing
Second
The Star Wars nerd in me cringed at that Darth Maul bit
This show was literally my childhood😭😭
Tobi acts like he knows everything bro your a b*tch u can’t fight u don’t know nothing
I hope the fast food chain is halal and in Birmingham
When did they start filming this vid
white boy so nervous makes it funnier

Who remembers when they discussed this idea in a sidemen reacts
Amazing video! Great watch!
Original idea boys👍🏻
crazy
Yo Vik was smart as hell in this video
Worst sidemen video I've watched
pretty sure the sidemen stole this from click! but still it depends on who makes it better
jj's team was clueless in the beggining deciding names and making fun of ethan's dad and there there's vik's team on the design hahaha i love it!
Earliest I’ve ever been to a sidemen video
It’s my birthday on the 28th
It’s a good day today

Harry ruining the ad by awkwardly agreeing is a such a Harry moment
Optimum pride
