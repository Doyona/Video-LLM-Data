If you guys heard a kid yelling then that was me I was yelling bc it was my first Bucs game and I didn’t know how to act 😂
Tomin is got to go. He got a Superbowl off the great players that cower made. As a Steelers fan, we won't see a championship. Replace Tomlin
Does anyone want some YouTube with their ads?
are the buccaneers the only team that change their uniform colors? when they battled the ravens, they wore red
Trashk is already out here throwing interceptions and getting sacked does the gator/sooner game ring a bell?
Amazing throw & catch by Mason and Calvin 🔥
How the hell did Pickett slip that through the defense to Pickens!
I overall like the Steelers Offensive Unit this season but I'm a little concerned about the seemingly weak pocket . A 3 second pocket doesn't leave much time for development downfield or safe disposal of the footy and seems to be encouraging snap decisions that get us into trouble a bit too often . The team seems strong though and the Defense is stellar . Looking forward to a deep run this season . GO STEELERS .
This is not your old Steelers
Go Baker!!
2:58 did that guy really have to smack him in the face mask? That seems.like.a.call.should be made
Dang it, they took Tuck's TD away! Go Cuse, another #44 in the League!
Three quarterbacks doing the business in pre season loving it go Steelers!
What the hell NFL?!! You fined Kwon Alexander $43,000 for a clean hit?! IN A PRESEASON GAME?! What is wrong with you guys?! You morons are not gonna allow players to show their worth if you keep doing this. It was a clean hit and no one got hurt! Go suck an egg! You guys are ruining the game of football and to be honest I think you guys hate defensive players. Your actions are incredibly stupid.
I guess Baker Mayfield belong to the preseason level only.
We aren’t making it any *LESS* than the divisional round but I personally think they are definitely superbowl bound.
PrincessP from Tampa is doxxed
First real game Sunday😎
Didn't see this game, and I'm a 9er fan... But have a BIG feeling Pickett is going to make a big step this year... They'll see the playoffs this year with actual hope...
Sean Tuckers teammates named him "Baby Nick Chubb."   Thats an ultra compliment coming from his peers. Safe to say hes making the roster.
Time to get that 7th Lombardi Trophy 🏆💍
Is the sound about a second ahead of the action for anyone else?
love how they dont call holding anymore
Trask can't get to his 3rd read even if he had 5 seconds.  Flat footed, Can't get through Progressions and no pocket mobility.  I can't believe Baker Mayfield is a starting QB again.
😢
Why the steelers had 2 different players with jersey #26..??
Steelers never fail on finding top notch WR's.
James P #42 got smoked all game as usual 😅
I hope trobisky not star QB couse is suck,
Jesus Christ Pittsburgh looking dangerous but they need a serious test then we’ll see what’s what. Good confidence boost win 💪🏾
Pickett to Pickens is going to be so exciting! Go Steelers
Steelers that game was sloppy come on now let get together last year y'all was looser now I tired 😪😴 of seeing the same team keep winning the super bowl
TOMLIN sucks he is the worse coach in the NFL
I literally argued with yuccs fans about their QB battle. Ive watched the camps and Baker is BY FAR  the better QB. Trask is erratic and looks lost way too much. He not that dude.
00:48 GP14 breaking ankles already
Trask played like trash 🗑️😂
Cut trushitsky now but this is Tomlins team NOW 110% AND TOMLIN IS RETARTED SO ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ,WHEN THINGS GO GOOD TOMLIN POUNDS HIS CHEST AND TAKES ALL THE CREDIT WHEN IT GOES BAD HE IS EITHER QUITE OR POINTING FINGERS BUT ONE THING THE STEELERS COULD HAVE THE STEEL CURTAIN OF THE 70S AND JOE MONTANA ALONG WITH JERRY RICE LYNN SWANN AND STALLWORTH AND TOMLIN WOULD FIND S WAY TO SCREW IT UP
Hate to be mean but Morgan kind of sucks at QB
@2:34 Trubisky still being retarded ☠️
Sounds like a home game
Did anybody else notice the score went down for Tampa Bay for some reason they were at 13 but then went down to 10 how the hell does that happen
Man, the O line just wasn't there for Trask. They did great for Mayfield, but i think there were some mental things to do with that.
:Steelers a pile of bones !!!
As a die hard steelers fan tribuisky is horrible he has to go
Baker is as Baker does. I know its preseason, but he did exactly as a starter should in a preseason gamw
I just figured it out! *#10MitchTrubisky* wants to get cut!!! I wonder why?
#14 is the real deal.
forgive me for my optimist but Pickett is looking much more comfortable! Some accurate and powerful connections with the fellow young receiving core.
0:46 this play was so very reminiscent of Antonio Brown. I really feel Pickens will be a big part of our future.
How are we not talking about Kirk warners son is number 85 for the Bucs
I swear Dionte Johnson lives wide open
Our Steeler boys looking great !  I wish my dad was alive to see them. I've watching Steelers since I was 5 yrs old.
Go Bucs
what i learned is Tanner is already cut (hes the throwaway guy won't even clear waivers for the PS)
Man I need to move to Pittsburgh
Congrats to the recent NFL highlights editors: More replays of the action, less focus on the antics and dancing.
That announcer from Tampa needs to pump the breaks with the whole “Every other team missed on this guy” Nice grab, along with a nice throw from Baker…But I’d chill out with the hype all over a kid who hasn’t played a single snap in an actual regular season game, who makes a nice catch in a meaningless preseason game, and the 1st preseason in the 2nd quarter at that. Be like the Steelers PA guys hyping Herbig after a nice pre debut and saying “Every other team missed on this kid, and we’ve got ourselves TJ Watt 2.0!”
BOOYA!
Herberg. Hehe...
All Steelers fans out there get hyped😃😄😄😄🎉
Did Darnell play?
0:46 🤣
0:46 🤣
So many more YAC with these scrubs on defence.
I'm  even embarrassed with my Stillers when D intercepts how they run to opp goal line and celebrate. ChickenSiht! They are supposed to intercept passes, recover fumbles. So, when they let opp to grab a TD pass do the D all run to the End Zone and beg for forgiveness??
Trask sucks start Baker
Our 3rd string QB looked better than Kyle Trask smh. Dude still hasn't developed to the next level, and this his 3rd year with the Bucs. Trask sucks 🤷
Man Tampa Bay is in for a long, long season smh lol
Bucks stadium is gonna be empty this year 😂
#2 Trash
😏😏😘🖤💛✨
LETS GO STEELERS 🎉🎉
CALM DOWN Calvin Austin did one good playing and y'all already comparing him to Tyreek hill 😂
Mason Rudolph’s 1st good throw in 5 years
I'm hoping Trask can become the Bucs starter. But idk man.
Bucs gon be terrible this season🤦🏾No secondary at all
The first team offense of line looked amazing thank you
Everyone said the Steelers are going to be at best 3rd in this year's AFC north,I guess a lot of predicters who judge pro football have diffently bumped all their heads 😅my prediction "not only will Steelers win the north"but the Steelers will be in this year's AFC championship game"yes I said it and I mean it wth 💯 perfect certainly!!!! let's ride!!😊
Mitch need to go Rudolph trying
Nothing like holding on Yaya Diabi on TD pass
Kenny Pickett looked good. Pickett to Pickens gives new meaning to the term "Picked Pass".
hopefully that is not the best the defense has..
Mike Tomilin.  Kenny Pickette.  You know we’re bringing it.  Tomlins teams are always in the conversation.  They will be again this year.  Here we go Steelers-here we go.
Mason Bum a** actually looked like a solid 2
Baker mayfield will lead the Buccaneers to the 2023 Superbowl. He will also be the MVP.
Can't wait to see the "Pittsburgh Dad" episode #GoSteelers
They are already missing Brady.
His name is Herbig. Why do they keep calling him Herberg?
I am so ready for some Football,more this year than ever for some reason..
Darnell Washington 💪
Hey, Steelers we are looking leagues better than last season, hopefully we can keep this up in future games, keep kenny as starter and have mason as back-up, and then we'll be awesome,  Also Kenny is looking better than last season, not saying he was bad just learning and this season he picked up a better offense to take some stress off him :P  But mason is looking awesome as well, he's come up a good bit from last time i seen him play!
Y’all mean to tell me Cam Newton can’t play yet these are the potential backups of the league.
That TD view @ 2:35 clearly shows that the Wr was out of bounds on the second step. Referee didn’t have that back view of the Wr
I hate Rudolph we have to get a new backup
That scorekeeper MUST be a Tampa Bay local if he’s mistaking the Bucs scoring 2x for either the away team scoring (7:25) or for not even seeing the flag thrown on the field prior to the touchdown (9:45) 😅 He’s lucky this is only a preseason game…..
Alls I can hear as a kid's voice reading for Tampa bay
George Pickens my man kids gonna be a breakout player this season
Yikes both teams looked terrible
Trask does not have the arm strength. Every throw, whether it be 15 to 30 yards, looks like he has to put everything behind it.
The STEELERS are looking really good so far!
What an AMAZING Game!!
Palmer looks good.  Bucs D looks trash.  QB looks trask
Pickens when he is covered...he's open! Keep feeding him the pigskin!
We can into hostile territory and stuck it to the home team, very proud of you boys! It's looking like a great year of Steelers football! Here we go
Hopefully we have a great season ! #GoBucs
Back to irrelevancy I guess... Miss you TB12. We'll be losing while your off playing with your Russian gymnastic model
I better never see our coach put in number 5 as qb.
I got a feeling………
Mason 'N***a Rudolph did well 👏
Baker looked good. He has a chip on his shoulder
STEELER NATION
COWBOYS RUNNING THE N.F.C THIS SEASON
literally you say
I'm pulling over 300 mbps and this website still buffers at 720p. Not exactly selling that Sunday Ticket with such lousy performance.
I know its only preseason but I apologize for ever doubting Rudolph
Can't believe Joe Schoen drafted Wandale Robinson over Pickens
That was rooough!
Here We go Steelers here We go
Why bucs  score go up on tne big austin catch😂😂😂😂
The steelers are going to be hard to beat. if they keep this run up.
Rip tom brady
i wanna believe that Kenny Pickett is our guy for the future but for PITT you really gotta show me .. Fan since ‘96.
L ADS
Penny Kicket =Mac Jones.
0:44 felt like they were playing a college team
not looking to good for my bucs. back to the bottom of the barrel
TJ Watt and Cameron Heyward's protegaes(Nick Herbig and Keeanu Benton) did a fantastic job on the field in that game. That defense unit is pretty solid.
As a steelers fan, that was a nice takeaway from zyon. Also its nice to see kenny targeting johnson some more this year. I actually might draft him it they keep it up lol. Also wow! Our pass rush was unstoppable!!!💪🏼
Baker looked good
It’s about to be a lot of folks looking for a team after this game 😂😂 seriously where’s the defense shesh
Steelers beat Tampa  bay
best third string qb out there...nice showing Mason.  💪
Those refs suck! Calling plays dead before the players are even down.
lol the bandwagon brady fans left
Keep it up STEELERS 🖤💛🖤💛🖤
Kordell Stewart continues to be a liability for the Steelers.
There was a personal foul called in this game against 26 of the Steelers after making a good clean tackle. The call was so bad, even the entire Tampa Bay crowd was booing the refs for a call that went against their opponents. If they are gonna be making those calls during the regular season, there’s gonna be a lot less viewers and revenue for the NFL
Baker looked good. Mitch looked like well.... Mitch. And the NFL being the gigantic organization that it is can't even make a highlight reel without repeats like seriously I would gladly take the job to edit these videos.
I'm glad Mason and Mitch are back. They didn't let egos get in the way. They will be solid back-ups. A lot of good pieces on this team I'm hoping for a Super Bowl win but I'll settle for a 11-6 record and divisional playoff
The Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens will have competition for the AFC North division!!!
Питсбург хорош
That Pickett TD was fantastic. If you watch the replay angle, you can see he starts through his progression on the left side and as he works his way back across the middle, just how quick he sees the separation, makes the decision, and delivers the throw--That's the stuff I want to see in year two. If he can do that with consistency, KP is gonna make believers out of a lot of doubters this season. I know, I know, its preseason, but I have seen nothing but big steps forward from this guy in training camp. Excited for 2023!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Elton and the Bucks win this year. They won't make the Playoff they.
Go box this year we don't want to wait this year.
Hopefully, I'll attend this year at the end of May.
But we don't want you to deal with us here. Any shows that you have.
Yaya seemed like just meh? lol
Mayfield actually looked pretty good based on these highlights. I opened this because I wanted to see Darnell Washington more. The Steelers are back on the way up, again... And the bucs won't challenge the raiders or Cardinals for the first over all pick
that palmer td wasnt in lmao
#11 foe.thr bucs isn't bad at all.
That td @2:27 was sweet cuz that corner couldn't have covered that any better
Come on with the punt highlights, please
Mason did again what he did last year and out played Mitch again. Crazy he was the one they let walk. Mason should be the number 2.
I like our depth
My Bucs look decent
Damn GP sold that outside move so hard
Hoping Kyle Trask begins to show out like he did on his one and only record setting season at the Gators,wild how well he did for only playing one year in highschool and 1 year in college having to wait his turn, but he waited soaked up knowledge and put it to his feet. He's a really humble man, hope he learned as much he could behind Brady on how w champion carries himself and prepares
I see the bucks have went back to the old ways good to see them back
Pickett looks ready but wait until next year. He’s gonna be a star.
If the steelers offense meshes well to start the season, calvin austin can be this seasons Jaylen Waddle
It’s hilarious that at 0:46 the commentators were hyping up 0 then Chucks pancakes him😂😂😂🤣
Steelers fan hyped, but the BUCS were garage garbage in that game... They defense sucked and offense called the wrong plays.. and got smothered with the ball .
pitt 14-3 tam 6-11
lmao baker mayfeild a rookie?
Pickett to Pickens!
The Pittsburgh Steelers suck. Forever and ever. Amen.
You accidentally put a football game in your ads
Great job 👍 Go Steelers!
Watching them react they think they are in the playoffs.
Ok Baker 🤝
10:56 caught and avoided the tackler with great anticipation.  The tackler tackled nothing but air.  There was a lot of YAC in this game.
Kenny doing what kenny does 😏
I'm a patriots fan but I'm rooting for Baker to turn his career around.
What was up announcer #2? All I could from him the whole game was mumble mumble mumble lol
I'm a Raiders fan. I know the AFC North is a tough division but I expect the Steelers to contend for a playoff spot, and will be a tough out for anyone they play.
The game was so badass! I was there at that game and I had lots of fun! I'm giving credit to both teams because they're amazing!
Hearing MUTHHHHH in a away game in the preseason really eats me kno we have the best fanbase
Safe to say who the starting QB is for Pittsburgh. Many people are saying this is the 4th best team in the AFC North. If that’s true then quite possibly every team in that division will have a winning record this year…..
They had they starters in the bucs didnt 😅 and yall saying yall look good for the superbowl wow
Qbs who wear gloves annoy me.
That play the that Trubisky threw the pick on, Canada sent not 1 but 2 crossing routes, and a go route. Wow. I'm actually impressed with the play call. Mitch even had Austin open but threw a bad ball but if we call that with our #1s at the right time it's an easy 6
That wasn't even a TD from Baker to Palmer 😂
Mason Rudolph is looking like a solid no.2 this year!
Steelers offense working the Clock was great to see last nite in opening drive . Moving the ball working the clock to keep the Defense rested as well is key to winning games this year. Going 3 and out under 1 -2 minutes putting defense back on field is unacceptable. Can’t rely on Defense every game especially the fast pace offenses.
I tell you unless the wideout makes it look effortless mason Rudolph just looks awful... But the fan base and organization want  him as third string so okay...
Who the hell is Nick Herberg
What a head faint 🤦🏾‍♂️ the coldest 🥶 I’ve seen thus far…
Not sure why Calvin Austin lll was still playing in 3rd quarter. He should’ve been resting staying healthy since His Injury last year came early. With Najee and Warren running the ball it should open up Friermuth, Johnson,Pickens, Austin as long as the offense line can keep Pickett safe. Our defense is solid as always and will be threat to AFC North division, as well rest of Playoff teams.It’s going be interesting season for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
BT potter is going to be kicking in the league for a very very long time. One of the most consistent kickers on the planet and I’m sad that hes not going to be suiting up for my clemson tigers anymore.
Same dumb running up the middle with no bells or whistles.. RIP my Bucs. Bring Bruce back!
TB12 definitely changed the perception of the Bucs for me now.
Dont enjoy a lot still preseason
Pitts is cut, need another look at Trask, Goedeke didn't look good at all. Now he sees why he was a guard last year
The entire Steelers team gonna be a bust this year 😂 they’re WAY too hyped, just to get 4th in the division
If Kenny and Mason get hurt our season is over
Second and 3rd string DBs gonna clean up some of that coverage and little better coverage for the backup OL but other that that Steelers looked very solid I’m proud and excited . Great game !
It’s a little concerning that the Steelers first round left tackle is playing late in the fourth. Any Steelers fans know what string he is and if it’s been reported he’s playing bad?
No O-line and no D-fence  Coach won't ladt the season (he shouldn't be the coach)
Pickens just like Plaxico Burress a master at confusing dbs with his route running and change of direction, Plaxico Burress, Hines ward ,Antonio brown all are masters of route running and change of direction which makes it impossible to know what they are doing cause they literally could be doing anything to you, any route from anywhere on the field it's very hard to defend
Even though I don’t like mason Rudolph, he is a decent back up. You have to respect his game
I wish Mitch would retire
Jesse James caught it!
Mason looks like a number 2 for us! Mitch 3rd! I really like watching this team it's amazing!
Kyle trask sucks his throws and accracy is bad
Why do Steelers quarterbacks always wear 2 gloves lol, he looked good though
Steelers fan here… need other Steelers fans to help me out here lol have y’all realized the way we try and tackle? Sometimes we slide? Wtf?
Pickens to Pickett look so good! Trubiski look like a rookie. Rudolph look better than Trubiski.
Baker looked pretty good
Picketts Accuracy Is Gonna Be INSANE he hasn’t even tapped his FULL potential that’s scary!
What QB competition for the bucs? One guy can actually win, and that’s clearly Baker Mayfield. He lead a poverty franchise in Cleveland to the playoffs and a win, and he can do it again
Ok ive been on a media blackout all summer and im only finding out now that baker mayfield is the bucs new QB.......This is awesome.  Personally I wouldve loved Taylor Heinikie but mayfield is a great player
Pickett is gonna have a big year in year #2 He looks more comfortable and patient in the pocket I hope the best for the man Him and Pickens are gonna be a deadly duo for years to come and Calvin Austin is underrated sneaky too
dam...... Steelers looks good so far
Trask is trash. Looks like he didn’t learn anything watching Brady from sidelines.
PLEASE CUT TRUBISKY
I’m looking forward to seeing more of Moore. Definitely a solid pickup 🔥
I am happy to see Trey Palmer out on the field, playing some great NFL Football. Really hoping to see this young rookie grow to become one the biggest faces of the NFL. He had a great record breaking performance at Nebraska. I am looking forward to see him grow and develop as a rookie within his career to become a NFL Great Football Player and eventually enter the NFL Hall of Fame. Trey Palmer is going to benefit from learning from all the old and new players so he can make his staple within the franchise as a rookie player. Other NFL Draft teams are going feel defeated from passing him up as a rooke NFL player.
Mason Rudolph should be the number 2 QB over Mitch
They bullied Morgan out there 🤣
Yeah this shits rigged there were 2 touchdowns Tampa should of had but the refs called a flag that wasn’t even legitimate 🤦 I’m done watching football
Trask giving me Chris Simms vibes.
That was not a TD.
As a Bucs fan, this season is going to be rough
do kwon and mcfarland have the same number or am i trippin?
Pickens is so good
Tampa oline is crap .their secondary suspect . Their d line is stopping the run nor putting pressure on the QBs.    Gonna be a long season
Offense looked good. James Pierre was getting cooked all night. Kendrick Green might be out of the NFL in a year at this rate
The only buc highlight was when the Wolfman came into the game.     Bucs will be sub 500.  Maybe win 4 games this year.  Zombie head coach Todd soup Bowles can’t develop talent
Kade warner 1 for 10
look at my team man
Those announcers were over it by half time 😂
With burrow injured 🤕 possibly missing the first 4 games. The AFC north will be interesting to watch. Lamar/Ravens should win the division ➗. But the steelers are the sleepers 💤 of the division and Tomlin is a very good coach. With Watt and that defense. They will surprise some teams. Pickett to Pickerns. Will be like Burrow to chase. No cap
I'm scared for Pittsburgh with Mitch as the backup dude is jus not good
Baker is only MVP in Pre-Season 😂
I wish Canada would let Kenny just throw ONE good deep ball. He has a bigger arm than I thought
Downtown Pittsburgh is full of drug addict in those apt. buildings, thats why drug dealers are down there, the media or police don't want tell the truth whats really going on
steelers fan here....super impressive first drive....wish that running game would get going though...i cant remember the last time any steeler running back took a handoff and ran 50-60 yards for a TD......Franco Harris in 1977 against the cowboys? Rocky Bleir against the Browns in 1978?
Pickett looking solid
The Steelers offense looks much better.
Im not gonna say Rudolph  plays better that mitch but he is definitely the smarter qb
We’re going 13-4 this season lets go steelers 😤💪🏾
I still don't see why that last touchdown by the bucks is good when Jesse James did not count against the Patriots 5 or 6 years ago! This one here was even less obvious then that one smh
First TD from Bucs was not a TD nor the second it was weird they didn't review it but they were clearly out
Was at that game last night. Could have sworn it was a home game for the Steelers. We played great at so many phases. Last night just made me so excited to see this year. Pickett, Pickens, Austin, Watt and so many more I can’t wait to see make plays.
I understand it's preseason but i don't think people realize how long it's been since the steelers drove right down the field for a touchdown on the first drive with 6/7 completions. It feels like the steelers are back so hopefully it keeps improving.
Baker looks chubby
The Bucs without Tom Brady begins now!
Should've used the Steelers announcers, these guys sucked lol
People who know ball know that the Steelers really upgraded both the lines on both sides are so good this year even the back ups can hang
Baker first td pass was nice and the catch😮‍💨
All the fake Bucs fans that showed up with Tom Brady yall packed it up yet? Lol
Najee looking like rb3
y’all all overreacting. Its the preseason bruh.
Most boring commentators of all time
If you can’t see the difference in these rosters you’re blind
Nice win for the Steelers in front of their home fans lol
If your a coach for the Steelers and you see this get some better QB’s there just standing there throwing duds
i missed the game did kendrick green play any FB in the game?
Thank you for whoever put the highlights together, but the continuity was off it would be like a 40 yrd gain to the opposite 40 then the next play the team is like 3 and 31 like how did that happen?
Trubisky is horrible
Defensive front looks good. But that secondary against medium routes is going to be an issue, not in a good way.
every game we play no matter where sounds like a home game 🙌🏾
Was at the game and I can tell you other than some “hiccups” from Tribitski and some questionable plays from Rudolph, the “D” looked good and the Offense had some string rushes and pass plays. That first Buc’s TD was questionable.
Mark my words David Perales for the steelers is going to b a problem
AFC North gone be a hell of a division this year. All 4 teams dangerous
RAVENS
omg i totally forgot baker was on the bucs now lol
Here comes the outlandish claims over a preseason game 😂😂😂😂😂
Can't wait for the panthers defence to rip Mayfield's head off. Dude is a bum
I’m a Steelers fan and I can say we lookin good but that’s jus preseason but the squad lookin gr8 and Kenny comin around. Now bein frm Florida I can’t lie the bucs lookin nice too and ppl sleepin on baker I feel a couple passes was a little too high and off jus a tad bit but he looked good. Both teams lookin solid jus my opinion
I actually hope baker has a decent year , really feel like Cleveland did him dirty
Mitch Trubisky is not good.
These NFL editors must be tired. Showing the same play twice.
Calvin Austin is going to be a problem for opposing defenses. He is so fast. If he works on his route running he will be very good. PS4L
Rudolph is QB2
The Bucs are back to the yucks
Just one game but Wolford might have just jumped Trask in my mind. Also we’re in good shape receiver wise with 83 & 10. Bye bye Russell Gage
If steelers stay healthy they going ti be good seem like injuries hit them hard every year
Hold tf up…TB has a QB named “TRASH” on the roster 😭 5:16
Touchdowns are to easy to score
Fat defensive lineman are all GAY! Holding hands so MAHOMES MARTYRDOM could scramble
CORNERBACKS AND LINEBACKER AND FAT DEFENSIVE PLAYERS ARE ALL RIGGED FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MOVIE MAKING.
Black JIHAD Republicans are so gay, THEY HAVE A EXCUSE FOR BEING STUPID AND GAY. I SLIPPED AND HE GOT AWAY FROM ME. NFL PLAYERS GAY BOOK RULES
Dude the bucs don’t feel like a real team to me man. Everyone’s playing for themselves
if #5 isn’t cut today then idk what we’re wasting our time on lol
its just one game. nothing spectacular but definitely not bad. we gotta lot of football to play
Not go lie we are stacked. 💪
Can you imagine giving KP time in the pocket while Freiermuth and DJ run short routes, and GP and CAIII run deep routes.  This team is gonna be so hard to defend against.
Protip: sorry ass Trask was playing his hardest to fight for the starting spot
Tampa looking ehhh and pitt tryn play too hard..finna be banged up soon..watch
Can't wait to scream "Pickett to Pickens" all year!!
Before was the B's combinación..now Will be the PIC -PIC comb!
Baker still cookin Im a fan Never cared until the Browns did em so dirty. Now i root for em always
I was there at the game and I’m really happy to see the Steelers win! I dont really like then both but I’m just happy for the 2 hour drive
really hope this year Steelers are worth watching... Defense looks awesome but it's the QB that I'm worried about and it's the same one from last year.. Big Ben had a ring his rookie year, so no excuse.
We played great! I’m looking forward to this year!
MUUUUUUUUUUUUTH❤ FRIERMUTH the goat
kenny looking good, has a lot more zip on that ball
Просто рад видеть Steelers и уверенную работу в атаке с Pickett (QB) и Pickens (WR)  Успехов банде Tomlin в сезоне! Steelers let's go :)   У Buccaners мило выглядел kicker в очках :)
An ad a minute into the video 😒
I’d love to see Brady coaching Baker.
Throw by mitch was perfect....receiver let it get picked
0:47 “you got something beautiful” as he gets pancaked
We goin to a Superbowl
Fire Tomlin! He is poison.
That dime that Mason threw to Austin. 😮‍💨
Big Panther fan here. Great to see Pittsburgh get more weapons from the defensive standpoint. A lot more urgency to get to the QB is well needed in the Steel City. The Succaneers got some great pieces to compliment Mike Evans. More weapons for Mayfield will add up throughout the season. Their secondary pieces are a nice add on as well 💯💪
Kurt Warner son showed a lot of promise
I hope all fans realize that the NFL is giving you a preview of the season only four run plays during this game . Enjoy fanstany foot when your RB produce points
That dude was out of bounds on the bucs first td
Mayfield looked comfortable as well. Hopefully, this is his redemption story
there is only 1 QB in Tampa this season...
Mason should be back up he through the best pass of the 67 yards strike to austin fir a score
Looking forward to the season to start.  GO STEELERS 🖤 💛
Anyone notice that Matt Canada might have finally found out how to scheme this offseason?
W STEELERS
Steelers will have a promising season if they stay healthy. Man it's nice to see football season right around the corner..
Rudolph should be #2
Man I love George pickins RAC ability it looks so crisp the way he makes people miss, his stutter and cuts kinda remind me of L bell
I am from Pittsburgh that game was great go steelers
I know it’s preseason but I’ve never heard a less enthusiastic announcer on a 67 yard TD pass
Darnell bodied people on the line
Steelcityyyyyyyy PICKETT NEEDS TO STAY QB1 these other qbs just dont look well nor have what it takes like kenny does!!! He looks comfortable and can navigate around the defense this triple threat gon be WILD
I want Baker Mayfield. Week 1 LETS GO BUCCANEERS
Preseason. Saw a lot of Buc rookies and 2nd string on booth sides of the ball starting the game. After them... Cuts will be made lol. The are some 3rd string pieces that should get a second string look though
Go Mason👊🤘💪🦾💪🦾👀
Bucs fan here. It's going to be a long season.
As I look at the Steelers I see tons of talent as well as depth. There's a saying that goes, " to many chiefs and not enough Indians "   I think will be fine because we have a general / Coach , that knows how to get the best from his players.
That Pickett to Pickens connection ❤️
McFarland makes some really nice plays hope to see him involved w offense somehow
All I can say is the buccaneers have no replacement players offensive line was a joke 😂
I see people talk about Trask playing bad, dude legit had someone in his face in less than a second. What can he do? Baker looked good tho
John 14:27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
If watt stays healthy...you better watch out for the Pittsburgh Steelers...he tied the most sacks in a season with missing a couple of games dpoy.
Hopefully Harvin is on his way out
#10 for the Bucs did a tribute touchdown dance from the movie 'Little Giants' I believe it was the character named Hot Hands.
No injuries...Big time Win... Businesslike...Run the ball guys...GO STEELERS ❤
Mayfield is a good QB if he is with the right team
george peckens
STEELER NATION 💛🖤 This would have been better without all thr fukn commercials! Thanks youtube.
Bucs secondary is sorry as usual.
can the bucs hire a coach that can teach Goedeke how to block
Im in  Florida I didnt see Kenny throw one pass more than 15 yards in the air? Mason is better than him he has the deep ball threat Kenny doesnt. If Kenny got hit the way Mason got hit against the Ravens idt hed ever play again. Also Masons numbers better thru 10 games than Kennys are. I want Mason qb1 call me crazy go head
we looking good #steelersnation
1. Bucs O line remains weak. 2. Did not see much of anything from the "new" bucs Offensive coordinator. 3. Bucs head coach will be fired. 4. Steelers under Mike Tomlin remain  one of the best coached teams in the NFL for the longest run ever. He is such a cool cat that inspires his players and coaches to perform. Great leader.
A real team plays tonight let’s go Flock nation ravens baby 💪🏿🤫
Overpaid its a game seating prices are ridiculous costing more than two weeks pay
Why were fumbles blown dead immediatly, is there a new rule or something?
This is why we need TB-12 back brady because no matter how good the team is an there offense today still suck overall we don't have a good QB to even get us to rhe playoffs this year . The QB we got the way he throws is not likeable he slow an he doesn't have a shot gun throw like brady .no one can do it in the pocket like the greats TB-12: tom Brady. This team gotta long summer .there defense is pretty good they ok but offense sucks and running back vaugn am sorry we will not make to playoffs we better hope goodwin are mike evans carry us all year are we in trouble even coaching staff
The nfl gonna learn quick…..we been warning you guys now these comments mad sweet what happen I though we finish last in division 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Baker Mayfield did a good job
James Pierre is garbage he need cut
I was watching female football earlier and was like WTF...  The women run plays like they don't know wtf they're doing and the passes they throw makes no sense most of the time.  It's like that with all female sports when comparing to male sports.  Sports are just played better by men, peroid.  Nothing against women, it's just....sports is not their thing.  Just look at how they play in the WNBA....  Enough said.  Women were designed by nature to "milk"...that's their thing and they're built for that....but they don't want to do what nature designed them to do and that's why they're now lost and doing all this "ME2 chit."  Haters are going to hate.
The game was blacked out in my area! Thanks for letting your fans down NFL!
The fact Nick Herbig had 2 sacks and Tomlin shouted on the sideline “Does anyone else have a little brother?” Is classic😂
That touchdown by Palmer was out of bounds
Week 1 = Pit  0-1  😂 #goniners
As a Bears fan, why does Trubisky still have a job ?
Not the rookie they was talking about getting pancaked after they complemented him
Watch interest in Bucaneers fall now with fat mayfield
we want qb vision in madden
Let’s be honest, Most Bucs fan favorite 2nd team is the Steelers. I’m one for sure.
Yaya Diaby is going to be a name to remember. He looks scary out there.
A lot of Baker ass kissers and wasnt like 3 Steelers got injured that didn't return to da game make since because they also the only team who looks like they played starters
The season started...
IT'S OFFICIAL, and listen, it pains me to realize this, the NFL is fixed. If you need any more proof on how fixed this industry is, go watch SB 57. Here's a team in the Eagles who had the leagues nastiest pass rush, can't keep footing nor get to Mahomes all game, a so called "hurt Mahomes" biggest game of the year, in the world, and the field is approved by a Chiefs fan, a geriatric man, and it was the worst field players have ever played on, Eagles pass rush can't keep footing nor get to him, sure would make a difference in the outcome right?? here's the thing, yes it affected both teams, but 1] the Chiefs knew about it and 2] it leveled the playing field, even if it affected the Chiefs it took away a major impact on the Eagles, wait, it get's better, the Eagles, even with the self inflicted wounds were the better team, they were controlling the game, what happens? A unwarranted flag comes in on a play, extending the Chiefs drive, ending the clock, and preventing a stud QB in Hurts from coming back, so think about this, Hurts got robbed 3x, all so agendas and faces can be showcased, Mahomes the clown is clearly the next face, Hurts balled his eyeballs out, and get's robbed a league MVP, another drive to comeback, and a Lombardi, to Andy Reid the ex coach of the Eagles, and people are starting to wake up to the BS, we've seen it for 20 years with the Patrtiots, here's a basic question, do people really think a billion dolllar entertainment racket industry is left to chance year to year? with no plans, agendas or goals? lol, just stop and think about that, I loved the NFL, but it's clear it's the WWE, it's entertainment it really is, and that's fine if you present it as such, but don't present it as a competitive league down to the best team wins, it's far from that, and the biggest clown in the world who Americans are subjected to daily is Jake from State Farm, nobody, nobody finds this clown to be mildly funny or entertaining, and yet he's doing a commercial with Patrick Mahomes, literally the field they played on, the stadium, State Farm. Mahomes is champion, yet he's champion  like Hulk Hogan was, it was booked. Any real fan tell me you saw the Chiefs as the better team that day. And tell me the refs and the field didn't come into play, please deny that as a reality.
Go Steelers! 💜💜💜
As a eagles fan glad to see the Steelers up !! Kenny and Pickett yikes !
bucks gone be traaaash for years! again!
Really wish the Chiefs had picked George Pickens. The Chiefs lucked out with the draft bust Skyy Moore. the fact that they were two picks away and only one other WR within the next 34 picks. The Steelers really landed big time with Pickens!!!
I watched dolphins vs falcons. Should ve watched this
Steelers looking good..!!
tom   I  see  u😢
Steelers need to continue playing with depth. Don’t focus on individuals. Let all three backs get touches.
I wish we pick up Myles Jack instead of Cole Holcomb every one else looks good Cole coverage is horrible
The Bucs pre Brady are back
bro why was that annoying girl mic'd up 😂
Who the hell mixed the sound on this video. Some of the worst I've seen from the NFL
Yup the buccaneers are going 2-17 this year I’m sorry we are going to get first round pick this year either get a top quarterback in the draft or go for a top defensive player in the draft because we need to work on this defense and also we need to fire Todd Bowles please just get rid of him so he terrible. Worst NFL coach I have ever seen in my life
Steelers defensive front is gonna be absolutely insane
Man that offense 👀
51 on defense looks explosive af
Trubisky is doing Trubisky things xD How can only one Team hold on to him after so much Years of bad Football ?
Kenny and pickens gone be nice
C.A.  GOT WHEELS BOIIIIII!!!!😅😅😅😅😅😅
Someone please help baker with his release for the love of God
McFarland is going to be perfect mix with Harris the defense will be on its heel different running styles also Pickett looks to be taking the step needed and Calvin looks good also ,if Kenny plays up to par were going to be hard to beat .
My opinion, for any steelers fans (or haters)  I legitimately think we can do really well this season. last season I was pessimistic due to all of our holes and knew it was going to be a long year immediately after week 1. Watt's return saved us from being a bottom 5 team as we should have been, and while I was upset at losing out on a top pick, we had a great draft nonetheless.  As for today, I really liked what I saw from the DL. Benton and Herbig were living in the backfield, and we've struggled with depth there in the past few years. Adding seumalo, jones, and Washington hopefully will make our blocking way better. Anthony mcfarland and calvin austin will give us much needed speed. I also loved what kwon alexander showed, we had a MLB making an impact for the first time in a while. We didn't even get to see what Joey porter or Allen Robinson have to offer. My only concern is the secondary. They weren't doing so great, although in fairness we didn't have our top 3 guys out there and our DL should be able to cover for them pretty well regardless. I also gotta give a shout-out to my man Pickens for silencing all the "OPI merchant" haters out there, who conveniently ignore that OPI wasn't an issue in actual games for him last year   In the end, it all comes down to pickett. I loved what I saw, but only time will tell how it actually goes. If he can just be solid and get 25-30 TDs, I think we can totally win 11-12 games. I see a lot of people hating on us which is understandable but I'm happy to take the harassment and let my team doing the talking for me because there is WAY more talent on this team than last year and I really like our schedule. As always, I'm trying to be as objective as possible, but as long as there are no major injuries I stand by this prediction
Our problem now is our tackling angles are ugly
I’ve been thinking it for some months now but after seeing that first drive I can confidently outloud say, The Pittsburg Steelers are A LEGIT THREAT TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE IN THE NFL.
Didnt see live but man Pickett looked solid and Pickens n Austin gonna be a problem🙂..
This Steeler team looks faster than I've ever seen any Steeler team before.  Austin is amazing.  Major props today to Mason Rudolph who looks like a very solid back up. Might possibly be traded for a third round pick.
B. Jones looked iffy at times, hope he grows into the LT role. KP8 is gonna need all the protection he can get if were gonna have a good season.
Nick herbig gonna be a monster
There is no reason we should be having Mason or Mitch
17 can't tackle to save his life
Championship season✈️🤑✍️
Mr.Rudolf did good living up to being named after that deer😂
The kids screaming throughout the game 😢
The look and feel of Mike Tomlins team is always really good. Thats a quality built team.Greetings from germany to all my Pommer relatives from Pittsburgh.😉
TAKE KYLE TRASH OUT
Looks like the Steelers shows some improvements this Preseason. The Buccaneers got a long way to go though.
Hopefully the Steelers stop sucking this year lol
Got our lick back 2x’s
Baker looks good! Ppl sleeping on him and my Bucs! Playbooy wide opeb, especially rollouts, which we did like 1% of the time with Brady. Im excited for this season
Whoever 44 is for the Steelers needs cut today.
Mason should be number two
We gotta draft a QB Kyle Trask can’t move his legs stuck he looks just like old man Brady back there
Baker looked way more comfortable in the pocket then Trash 🚮
I already know I’m gonna upset some with this comment. Jaylen Warren should be the starting RB this year. Regardless of how the o-line played he still got his yards last year, the dude is a straight dawg!
I turned on the game in the 3rd and saw Darnell Washington pancake a dude right off the first snap. It’s gonna be a good year.
Carolina most definitely running the south
Happy for Pickett and Baker.  Both looked 🔥 in this game.  Give baker some time to pass, Bucs might surprise people and if the Steelers stay healthy they could potentially be surprise contenders
That Yaya kid looks better than Tryon already in my opinion. He didn’t get a sack but he was nipping at their heals.
Jayleen warren a dawggg I believe he’s way better than Najee how tf Jayleen become a free agent
Tbh i liked what i saw from mason rudolph this game he looked much more comfortable than any other game hes played
Every 20 seconds a commercial? U serious?
I love how the first Trubisky highlight is him tossing one over the middle to no one 😂
Seeing the Steelers and enjoying all Steeler nation. They are like no other fans. Let's go Steelers! Let's Go!
I dont care. i like mason rudolph......as a backup
Steelers look good out there, but started to accumulate alot of missed tackles when they controlled the game, but no outside man coverages? #NeedAnewPolamalu #HereWeGo
I know it's just the pre-season, but HALLELUJAH the NFL is finally here!!!....tired of watching these other lame ass sports.
Where is Tom Brady???
Shoutout the to the squeeker over the commentators mic in the background, definitely made it more entertaining 💀😂
Baker played well! Keep up the good work!!
This qb wr duo might cause some issues
Steelers Nation
Baker looked good.
They almost knocked pat out on the first play lol
steelers superbowl
I'm surprised the Bucs haven't made Bruce the head coach again 🤣😅😀
That first drive has to get everybody excited right?
The last Qtr in the game   27-7  Pitt    ...Then Wolford  came in 27-10 then 27-17  Better then  Mayfield and Trask put together  Ya its a The Preseason but Wolford is the guy they need..... To start the season.......
Looks like the Bucs...without Brady
Ditch Mitch 🙏🏽🙏🏽
as a pit fan it looks like they are gonna do ok this year
I hope they do good , there’s just gonna lose week 1 😅
0:40 how is announcer going to make a statement as such and then said player proceeds to get pancaked 💀💀💀
Gear Up For The Start Of NFL Season "Just Bruised And Beaten All Black & Blue Its Been Like That Since Madden '92.........
Pickett looks a lot more comfortable. Only preseason but he looks much better. Let’s see if he can consistently be like this.
Give the position to Mayfield! Its a no brainer
nice
Wait so McFarland no. 26 played on both sides of the ball?
I like what I seen from my Steelers 😎
I hope the Raiders or Redskins were watching this game and try to make a move to get Mason for their starter.
GO STEELERS 💪💪💪
Thanks for the recap! The sound was just a split second ahead of the picture
Bucs got work to do😮😮😮😮😮😮
Do not give that man the right tackle spot. My god that was horrible and that wasn't even against starters!
Outside of Kenny Pickett...Our QBs look terrible.
I went to this game. It was the very first time i had ever been to an actual football game ever. I just wish it wasn't so damn hot. X3
Baker ain't looking bad
I love how crispy Kenny looked and GP and I love the fact that the Mitch and Rudolph are celebrating together, this team is not the same as last season and it going to show 🔥 I CANT WAIT
Good game seen a lot to look forward to with this new offense way better than leftwich already we where spreading the ball defense looked shaky but alot of are starts where out
Well we know the bucs going to be a non factor if they running them type of plays in the nfc 😂😂
This Buc fan hopes we lose every game
VAMOS STEELERS 🎉
Im not a steelers fan but if pickett played like this all the time he wouldnt be such a joke
This game solidified two things in my mind. 1: Kenny looked poised and in control, and 2: Kendrick Green still REALLY needs to go.
Our defense and WR core is gonna be really good and our like our backs too McFarland speed is gonna be very much needed just gotta get back one game at a time Steelers football run the ball stop the run be physical hopefully we're playoff contenders this season
Touchdown to Pickens they missed the biggest holding call
Y’all seen that boy Trenton Thompson with that INT! He’s ready coach put him in he’s gonna produce🙌🏽
That’s the old bucks team I like too see Tom Brady can’t carry you guys no more
Keep the fire Stiller fan, Bucs played ZERO starters - Destined to be the 4th best team in the AFC North
Best qb depth chart
Tampa Bay Buccaneers look nice, definitely a solid team for the future, their rookie and sophomore core are very impressive. Nice job Buccaneers!
It's nice getting these uploads again. Each year the NFL gets crazier and crazier. 2022 was wild asf in itself. Wonder what's gonna happen this year.
It's preseason, commenters in here acting like it all mattered when in fact both teams are trash.  Neither has a shot for the AFC Champ game this year, better luck next year.
Baker 😤😤
ik it’s preseason yadayada but my Steelers 1st team looking legit and plus ball is ball and a win is a win how ever u look at it !
Number of 44 for Tampa looks like Nick chubb a little
Pickens is legit….
Steelers QB's looked on point. Defensive scheme seemed to work well. Will be interesting to see how far they go this year.
Gonna be a completely different team 😈 go Steelers
Steelers has no QB at all they all are ass
Lets go 10-0 again 🎉😂
I know it's preseason and playing against non starters but our o line looked really good on their opening drive
Pickett genuinely looks really, really good. Excellent ball placement, great pocket awareness, dude can ball when he’s supported well. I’m not technically a Steelers fan, but they’ll be fun to watch.
Baker played good.
I wish my Bears had taken Pickens in the 2nd rd last year when he was available :(
If you are in this comment section to be a hater, then take your ass somewhere else.
Steelers played a pretty damn good game, if they stay healthy they are going to be a dangerous team. Kenny Pickett is going to have a really good season and our defense is going to be fire.
So excited about this season.#here we go 🖤💛🖤💛
I hope 🤞 the regular season looks this good for the Black & Gold!
Sad tk see steeler fans now get excited about a preseason game not just any but the 1st one and against a team that isn’t very good. Now it’s just a bunch of delusional fans in the comment section acting like they have a LEGIT Super Bowl team
Bucs oline depth looks rough
Austin was wide open on that interception
YOOOOOOOO, THATS WHY YOU DONT SLEEP ON PITTSBURGH
Was that Broderickthat Broderick Jones getting bull rushed????!!!! By a second teamed???? Uh oh !!!! LOL
Palmer lookin really good for the bucs, gonna surprise a lot of people this season. GBR!
Rudolph is qb2
As soon as KP to GP went for 6 Every social media comments: WE GOING TO THE SB I love being a Steelers fan
Brodrick doesn't look ready
Steelers had a great first half and not to bad of a 3rd but after that we played like last year.
Backups weren't very encouraging to me
TJ Watt stays healthy, Steelers will be a dangerous team this year.
Compliment Yaya then he gets pancaked😂
Pickett looked better & mason Rudolph really surprised me.
Mason may have the best deep ball of the 3 QBs
Terrible commentary
Super Bowl confirmed
I'm hoping Herbig and Austin can contribute this year...One person who won't be, is Morgan. He was atrocious.
I coined it… way before anyone said it. Pickett 2 Pickens
Aye that boy John wilford look good out there on my mama! I thought that was Brady. Tampa might actually have a little surprise in him. He looked hungry and focused. He should start
Death. Taxes. Mason Rudolph shredding preseason defenses lol.
what a trash QB for Bucs
Any body see herbig make that play he’s gonna be a good player just watch
Steelers played well. Why is Rudolph still their? Baker Mayfield  look like hes getting use to that offense.
The Steelers are going to miss the playoffs this year they suck.
0:11  KENNY THROWS AS FAST AS MAHOMES  I told y’all he was special.. he broke DAN MARINOS COLLEGE RECORDS… he’s going to win a super bowl. Watch as the Steelers defense stay the best in the league and that offense becomes a top 5 with pickens making plays to get 15 tds a year… watch.
I think The Steelers are gonna SHOCK THE WORLD!! This year nobody is paying any attention to them because the AFC is so loaded but they are gonna turn some heads I got a good feeling about this year
feels like another kevin-stefanski I-dont-trust-the-qb-so-give-the-ball-to-the-rb moment... baker could throw, why make most of the plays were run plays??
These edits are so bad. Y'all make BILLIONS, with a B. You gotta have better social media editors. Like, do these ppl even watch football? These edits are trash compared to fan-made edits.
Can we please stop putting trubisky out there, oh lord… season after season I witness this horror. Make it stop!
Baker is clearly No. 1. Trask looks awful. His number doesn't help him though, looking like a worse Chris Simms giving me flashbacks 😂. Wolford should be the backup, he's got some upside.
Steelers had a good game overall, I would say baker has the advantage for the starting job after this
Steelers need to have the same luck as last year and stay healthy if they wanna be contenders
The Steelers are going to destroy this year
You almost wanna say Trask sucks, but he doesn't have time to do anything
Unpopular opinion but why don't they film NFL from behind and closer to the field so you can actually appreciate what's going on.
Dionte Johnson !!!
Steelers making the Playoffs, brothers. I really like Jaylen Warren as well. Good fantasy sleeper, imo I am also sold on the Pickett/Pickens connection. All the experts saying don't draft Pickens in FF are retarded. He will have a great year.
I'm so happy to see McFarland on the field again. Glad we keeping him instead of snell. He's been with us for a while but never got a real shot and you can tell he's been waiting for it
Did Joey poeter jr play?!
McFarland fastttt 😂
Settle down folks....preseason....pre....season.
nicest grass ive ever seen
Mason Rudolph looked like the best QB has the fastest release, make him play with the starters🗣🗣🗣💯
Anybody else hate these commentators? I know it's preseason, but damn... have some enthusiasm!
Mason looking like he's back on the OSU campus!
3:41 Mitch DRIVING that team in for a TD!!!! Our depth at QB is UNMATCHED!!!
Todd bowlers should be on the hot seat
Of course Mitch throws a pick 😂
NICK HERBIG. That’s it
Kenny good Mitch bad
I like mason’s gun slinger mentality, he never gets credit for it just scores TDS and walks away , I kinda trust him more than picktrubiski at this point
It's nice seeing Austin out on the field
Steelers 10-7 barely misses playoffs
Again, preseason means absolutely nothing.
These Steelers are for real. The NFL better be ready.
My Niners play Steelers week 1. It’s gonna be a battle! Can’t wait!
Who put these highlights together terrible
Todd bowles is an awful cosch he destroying the Bucs, Owners hired him so they could get draft picks to get a QB😅😅😅
That 1st round pick Jones looks like another 1st round pick bust
Kenny looked solid on that drive
I think for the Steelers qbs it should be Kenny picket then mason for 2nd and then trubisky man Kenny looks very good I’m not a Steelers fan but they do look like contenders the defense is already elite once you get a qb that is calm in the pocket and starts having good connections with Wrs especially how  George Pickens makes  unbelievable catches bro you got an offense scoring in most of the drives tbh
Bucs go 6-11 this season, Baker Mayfield Lmao we're done.
Everyone’s gonna talk about Pickett to Pickens and Austin III. Rightfully so, but Keeanu Benton and Nick Herbig both looked fantastic. Steelers defensive front is gonna be absolutely nuts
Kenny FN Pickett!!!!
Nobody gonna talk about how they showed the same 4th and 1 twice 😭
Bro is it me or do I hear some kid screaming the whole game in the background???
Ayyy Chris Myers
He's been doing that all mini camp #14
Dangit, Terry Hanratty....
a punt going out of bounds is not a highlight
Man it's nice to see football season right around the corner.
We already know what kinda special talent Mr Pickens is but I'm excited to see if Calvin Austin can make some big noise in that slot position. I think he will. Keep sleeping on this Steelers team ya'll.
This tank for Caleb Williams is starting good let’s go buc 0-21 season incoming
Bucs :)
Pickett stays throwing dimes ❤
Bucs just turned into the Browns.
I don't mind trading or cutting Mitch. Give Mason the 2nd again and Morgan the 3rd
Number 19 knew he was open somehow
idk who he is but looks like #16 for the steelers SUCKED tonight
What a beautiful pass by Trubisky! Go home Cody White! If Pickett threw that pass, fans would be going INSANE! Great first drive by the Steelers! Pickens could be a special player.
Ik that it sound stupid to be acting like a coach in the comments but honestly the one thing I noticed about the buccaneers is that they still have no answer for pass rushing and offensive line might end up getting baker killed steelers looked all around better coached and a better group as a Bucs fans I foresee a mediocre 7-10    8-9 season which will finally get TODD BOWLES OUT OF TAMPA THANK GOD and give us an opportunity to scoop up some actual coaching talent. (besides Dave Canales who I couldn't feel better about as an offensive coordinator hopefully this doesn't come back to bite me)
Our offensive is going to be TUFF i just need our defense to be elite but our key players didn't play yet soooo i cant wait until the season !!!!
From the looks of it, Baker will be starting week 1 lol
As a bucs fan they need to work work on the secondary
Lets goo Tampa🔥
Haven’t been excited to watch a Steelers offense in sometime. This team looks legit and Pickett definitely seems like he’s gonna have a great 2nd year. Just gotta stay healthy and they’ll be a threat in both sides all season long
Mason tossed a dime as taking a hit.
It looks like TB will have a long season.  Oh boy.  Steelers did their thing, its always good for the NFL when the Steelers are contenders, too early to tell, but they looked quick, fast.
Todd bowles dont win no damn BOWLS ever and you can count on that lol
Mason Rudolph was very impressive this game!!!
I love My Steelers no matter what!!!! Picket/Pickens 2024
Baker still the best in the league
Ai ai what a schame😮
Kenny Pickett has a lot of potential and can easily become a top qb in this league after what he showed us last year.  It is there for him also to become one of these $200 million qb's,  if he can win a Superbowl.
Steelers look real good.....Bucs not bad.
At 0:49 seconds Steelers WR #14 (George Pickens JR) juked the safety out his shoes before he got a TD.
I went to this and I got autographed by Gunnar number 89
Trubisky is so trash. Man  Imagine if we had KP8 all year yesterday…
Great start keep the spark going! Go Steelers
I just feel like trask ball speed is sooooo slow … can’t believe I’m even saying this baker is better.  P.S. bucs fan
3-14
2-14
Unless your in the AFC, you can’t run against us often
CA3 bros got wheels on him he gonna be special
Go Steelers but also happy Sean Tucker got some touches and a TD that didn’t count. Think he’d be a good depth piece at RB for the Bucs. Go Cuse!
1-14
0-14
0-13
Pittsburgh really is the best  WR factory in the NFL...Super talented can't wait for the season to begin. #HereWeGo
0-12
0-11
0-10
0-9
Pittsburgh Steelers vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers
0-8
0-7
So Diaby looks terrifying.   Hope we don't get any injuries to the LB/secondary though, because the backups still look rough
0-6
0-5
Let’s go Steelers…….step to 7 begins
0-4
lets settle down on the kenny pickett hype, yea he played good but it was the steelers starting offense against the bucs backups and rookies in the one drive he was on the field
0-3
0-2
0-1
So many pluses, too many to mention. Great job men. GO STEELERS! 🖤💛🏈
Herbig had a great game. So far looking like a great draft pick.
Pittsburgh getting cracked week 1 vs San Francisco
Help me out, at 7:46 does the color guy say "I didn't even see who the corner is....ah, it's Derrick Pitts and... f**k it?
i cant believe football is back, im gonna cry 😭
whoever this #5 guy is, idk if he ate a bag of popcorn before the game, or if he’s nervous, but damn this guy STINKS!
0:40 announcer curse right there, dude got pancakes and they scored on him lol
Kenny Picket is him bro
Jesus as a Steelers fan we actually look well rounded. Thought Canada was gonna keep throwing games
0:47 Zyon and his awesome tackling skills resurfacing from 2022. 6:56 Goedeke's T-Rex arms didn't cause this sack lol. 8:15 It is going to be a long year for the Goedeke. 8:38 Great pickup from left to right side by Durham.
As a Nebraska fan, he was squandered away though he had an amazing season. Good thing I’m also a Bucs fan. I think Trey Palmer could make a big presence
mason > mitch steeler fans ?
my #buccaneers need to work on rushing defense and our run game strategy ...our QB's  look pretty good on accuracy but we need to learn how to escape evade out the pocket when it comes too a defensive team like #steelers..overall solid game just some minor tweaks on both ends of the team
Secondary was terrible, to much zone. They covered no one. Offense looked good. A lot of weapons
Is the NFL allowing same #’s being worn on each side of the ball?!?! 🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽 pretty sweet. #HereWeGo
At 838 in the 3rd it says 26 to 13 when Austin scored the touchdown and then it says at 802 in the 3rd  27 to 7 so am I tripping or what???? LETS GO STEELERS
Kenny Heisman!!!
Trubisky is such a waste of money
IM so proud of Mason Rudolph he never fails to make me say “TRADE HIS ASS”😒
Warren  McFarland  Najee
Imagine being a buccaneer & knowing your teams going to be ass this year
Man....its too bad the Steelers are too stupid to no allow an OPEN QB competition.....Mason Rudolph looked great compared to the rest of him.....what a waste and sad to see he isn't being given a FAIR chance.....hopefully he will get traded somewhere instead of being wasted on the sidelines behind pretty much average QB play..........
Happy to see Calvin Austin doing his thing
Kenny  Mason  Mitch
Told y’all Steelers best team in the NFL besides the Chiefs. That offense with austin back and healthy will be unstoppable.  A upgraded line and secondary, they already had DPOY TJ watt
Kenny out here dropping dimes. Calvin Austin faster than a bullet. George Pickens doing George things. Man I’m excited for this team this season. Super Bowl here we COME!!!!
AND THE UNDEFEATED SEASON STARTS LIKE ITS SUPPOSED TO!!! HERE WE GO!!
Go Baker!!!!!
Fire the HC of Tampa now get it over with just start the tank /JK
My boy mason Rudolph looking like a solid no. 2 this year ✊🏽
KP8 was great. I will admit I have been a Mason critic but he played well behind poor O line play and needs to be the backup. Just give Mitch a bus ticket out of town
The Bucs get the loss in their first preseason game with Baker Mayfield. I really like how Baker played today. I could see potential in him and in Trey Palmer. Hopefully, but doubtfully, but I hope that maybe we can win the Division, if Baker Mayfield is good this year. GG Steelers. Next up, we face the New York Jets. Good Luck Jets
Finally!! NFL replaying good plays! Thank you!
George Pickens that d00d
The buccs had 3 quarterbacks 👀👀👀
That first drive and the Calvin Austin TD was all I needed to see. Not to mention Darnell Washington knocking down the entire line 💀
Defense needs to get there lines better chasing someone in the open field
Why did tampa bays third string play the best 😂
Let Austin do his thing glad he is back after his injury...... I am a Steelers fan, I feel like my team is in for a surprise season, all across the board. Mike Tomlin and management will be good I don't care what nobody says, Kenny Pickett and the rest of the squad will shut doubters up, I can't put much on the preseason I don't man...    Steelers 🖤
Austin could be a sleeper this season for the Steelers
Baker gonna be great this year
Kwon Alexander was hitting everything
Always nice to see nfl highlights on recommended again
Matt Canada, please keep the play calling up like this. This play calling was very fun to watch.
Steelers looking good 👀
Yay Football!!!
Fix the highlights
Darrell Washington is HUGE ASF bruh bigger than the o line men lol . I love this in our back pocket
Trask definitely learned all his scrambling techniques from Brady
Pickett looks goooood this game exited to see him play this season
Kenny throwing 🎯
Ik it’s preseason but the Steelers already have more games with multiple passing tds than all of last season
HERE WE MF GOOOOOOO🗣️🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝
I was at that game well played steeler
If cory trice was healthy we would be deep at Cb. Get well soon bro. Steelers looked great.
CA3 getting that touchdown while they were talking about Shaq daughter was crazy. RIP little angel🕊
Shoutout #33 man proud of my dawg
Bucs played well didn’t have any starters playing vs the Steelers starters and trask looked great except one throw
Kyle Trask or Trash??
ALL GLORY TO GOD❤JESUS SAVES JESUS LOVES
Where is Darnel Washington? Is he a starter?
The Pittsburgh Steelers has a great game tonight in Tampa!🏈
My Steelers played good
Get used to hearing Pickett to Pickens!!
I’m ready for week 1 that will tell a lot about this 2023 Steelers team and boy that man CAIII is going to be a problem especially if the Oline is giving Pickett time in the pocket for him to throw downfield him and Pickens are the future at WR in Pittsburgh
That was out of bounds on bucs first TD
Trask only had one bad throw (not the int it was a good throw just bad timing) and the WRs had two bad drops that Mike or chris aren’t gonna drop I still think baker has the edge but I want to see trask get some reps with Mike and chris next week
Steelers Nation
I've seen enough steelers going to the superbowl
I’m a Bucs fan but I’ll cheer for the Steelers this season since polamalu is one of my all time favorite!
2010 team revived KWON is a bad man!
Falcons
Steelers will have a promising season if they stay healthy
Steelers played a solid game tonight. Kenny Pickett looked incredible in his only drive. George Pickens and Calvin Austin are gonna be lethal. Nick Herbig actually looked great out there. Broderick Jones, he also looked good.  Good win tonight guys! Here We Go
Bucs penalties this game kinda sealed their own fate
Tribisky is 🗑🗑
Baker looked great. Was not expecting him to rebound quite so well. If he plays next week like he did this week, the job is definitely his
Lets go baby. On to buffalo🖤💛🖤💛🖤
Tampa oc trash way too obvious run run run run penalty pass…run run pass ..run run run you would think they running wild but the thing is they was running no where and both qbs where looking good and they limited pass attempts
360p?
i mean, we lost because of trask. he can’t avoid getting sacked. trask needs to wake up if he wants to be a starter. we gotta have baker as a starter! don’t get me wrong. wolford played his heart out but i rather has baker just because why not and baker has more experience. we gonna go 2-1 in preseason
No Brady no party
Would’ve won with Baker in all game
Shitsburg I don't think will make the playoffs but buccaneers might
my 49ers are a good team but the steelers are always good i could see the steelers looking at this game week 1 as a early statement game for them and my team losing going 0 and 1 we do travel well if we do win it will be close we do have a nasty defense and cmc and jordan mason anyways good look steeler fans see you week 1 in steeler country
still 360p
Yaya diaby will be a beast in 5 years
Keep counting baker out😂😂he finna show yall
Best team we’ve had since 2010
I've madden 09 and Madden 10 on my Wii
We’re so back
I love NFL
Steelers played well. I think if they stay healthy. There going to be contenders. You could tell the defense is going to be crazy this year
pickett highkey SLINGIN it
A lot of buccaneers rookies look good. Especially yaya
C'ant believe NFL season without TB12
This was A Good game TBH
21st?
Bucs are falling I lost faith
First
The steelers looked great out there i think they could have a chance at making the playoffs. Baker and trask looked good, they both have a good chance at being the starter, and the o line definitely needs improvement but gg steelers.
Our starter 🔥🔥🔥 boy I tell you, this is going to be a season for the books
2-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS TB BUCCANEERS LOSE
Let’s go Steelers nation📝
I’m a gators fan so I’m low-key rooting for Kyle Trask
