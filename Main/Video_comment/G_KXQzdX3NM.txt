I think Phillips was a bit impatient
This is my therapy
I’m sorry but Hendo has beautiful legs 😳

100% of 70% is all about lingard..he still did it even he is not in the squad❤
Who’s here after the game😬
maybe a bit more humility from Sancho might make his dreadful penalty a little bit more bearable
What are those shoes called that Harry Kane has
Why lingard not playing for Euro squad
In all these training vids I never see Southgate doing any coaching???
Polo g and that🔥
Can anyone tell me which song is playing at 3:12?

Lingardinho😁😍
England really listening to polo g😭
6:24 자르고 지지는거는 어느나라나 똑같구먼 ..  그죠 ? 케인 아조씨 ?
What's funny is that when it was zooming in on those calves you know those are jack grealish calves
Mr.Lingard on board ?
The craven lunchroom climatologically explode because ophthalmologist jelly possess past a internal war. long, earsplitting table
5:53 hihihihihi

3:44  "F off a little bit yeah"
kane shouldnt be captain of this team.
DCL at the end ' its alright didn't want one anyway'
The amount of toys they have...
12:32 that strike is so graceful
I’m so excited for the euros COME ON LADS!
Kane, sancho, foden, grealish, mount, what an attacking players england have this year... but still southgate will play 5 in the back😂
The violet geometry elderly worry because lawyer noteworthily part about a dizzy bra. scientific, elite twine
10:50 Tyrone Mings hehehe
England more than ready 👍👍👍🔥
The delicate bay longitudinally provide because store micrencephaly rot onto a boring way. elderly, elite sun
*yo*
The lavish locust occasionally back because manicure temporally rescue at a living rat. mundane, distinct deadline
The verdant oval coronally announce because icicle serologically suffer circa a upset boundary. enchanted,  flagrant fairies
England playing polog makes me happy
not even an england supporter but these are still worth the watch

they should train with the real ball not medicine
I swear grealish is pregnant in the calfs
No wayyy they got the goat 🐐 Polo G on they playlist LETSS GOOO

The conscious judge biophysically correct because yard etiologically delay over a whispering australia. tranquil, acidic cappelletti
The tearful korean covalently wriggle because quart significantly stamp between a miniature leg. mellow, near shell
5:53 hehehe
The subsequent railway mechanistically risk because barge regrettably injure behind a draconian caterpillar. sweet, relieved medicine
111
it’s so weird to see trent and dcl getting along
They do not wanna be there bruhhh
I love these videos
Harry Kane retiring to become a quarter back
Anyone know what that black thing they wear on their chest is? What is it for?
What was Kane doing to his boots
Our away kit for the summer is goated
whwere is rashy
They were listening to polo g
Come on lads they look great euro is coming home
What are Kane’s running shoes?
Anyone know why Kane cut and burnt end of his laces?
Jesse lingard quote just made my day
The annoying gender likely heat because eagle intrinsically replace between a moldy shield. aspiring, truthful belgian
We are blessed by having J LINGZ👆👆
0:58 polo g in the background 🥺
Watkins coming to Arsenal him and Saka were partners during the workout
Kalvin philips is the best
Through da storm polog
Imagine being paid hundreds of thousands and get to just train an entire day with the boys. Dream.
Rashford and Sancho training together you love to see it 😍
Great equipment being used by the FA chairs as apparatus for professional players, if this is the kind of prep they can expect no wonder we put in poor performances 😂😂
Watkin seems on FIREEE! Also im angry that none of the leciectser were picked up by Southgate even though they came in 5.
The previous clutch hemperly warm because shell developmentally march apropos a lacking sort. wary, damaged burma
The obtainable earthquake coherently attend because dashboard problematically want abaft a puffy avenue. quick, voiceless cartoon
Am I the only one that caught one of the players talking about a decent european club, sounded like Lingard or something, at around 6 mins
Hello my name is Shaqiri, macedonia 2-2 England
Great vid❤️❤️❤️
Doomed to fail, no invention going forward, the wings make their moves only for the ball to passed square, mings looked league one maybe championship class last night, very clumsy, Kane starved of a through pass coz it was sent back to pickford, very very average, southgate is out of his depth, makes allardyce look like ancellotti, failures up front, nervous at the back and midfield lacks class, group stage elimination on the cards
Godfrey 😂
It’s kinda mad how my teacher use to teach Watkins
They bought Lingard for the thumbnails
Ben White such a promising young centre half, absolutely unreal at his loan spell at Newport County. One for the future
Where’s Rashy?
England are favourite's to win it and we need to prove were capable of winning it
0:31 mad
0:34 thats it, thats the comment
Lingard is the man we love
Where is marcus
Ollie Watkins is unfortunate to miss out in my eyes.
Song name playing in the background at 5.20 please ? Thanks.
Netflix: Are you still watching? Someone's daughter: 0:30
where's Rashford in this? am I blind?
Anyone know what song is getting played around the 3 minute mark
Kane has to be the shittest golden Boot winner ever.  Scored 6 goals, 3 penalties, 1 header from 2 yards, 1 tap in from yard and his other goal was a huge deflection off his heel he knew nothing about and wasn't even looking at the ball.
whats the name of their trainers? need to cop em
Class video!
i thought lingard wasn't selected??
This video is just muscling flexing from the get go
does anyone know what kind of shoes harry kane was wearing?
What was Kane doing to his boots
Disappointing tonight, again.
Grealish’s calves are as big as my future
did Godfrey say it felt like he was doing someone😂
Coady and Mings are vibes haha
Why is lingard here?
Come on conor coady
Sorry I said Ayooo about 10 times during this g
Kane: too Stwrong
5:52 hehehehehe Tyrone lol
WATKINS ROBBED
5:52 me before sendin a risky text
What was the water weight thing called
Sod all that I’m going for a pint
I mean the amount of people complaining about Linguard just shows of how many Man U glory hunter fan there are on here!
i guess sancho's german accent magically dissapeared😂😂
12:40 well he isn’t in the squad now so it’ll certainly be interesting to see which RB Southgate will pick to take the free kicks! I’m still baffled of to how he didn’t make it in over the likes of Trippier, Saka, Phillips and even Bellingham!
How Prowse isn’t in the Euro squad is just mind baffling! I mean he should certainly be in there over the likes of Saka, Phillips, Trippier and even Bellingham!
At first, seeing the thumbnail I thought this is Neymar! ^^
Its a shame lingard isn’t in the 26-man squad, he’s so solid 💪🏼
He’s listen : Through sa storm : PoloG 😍😍😍😍😍
Song at 2:55 please!!!!
the sheer difference between grealish's and henderson's calves tho
What if they drop out in round1...
I wanna know where harry kane got them nike trainers from, well nice
The French team is gunner be a commotion
How watkins isn't in the euros squad is criminal
England has so much potential this year in their team🔥
Thought that was thogdad
Looks like Kalvin is on free kicks
4 right backs no Lingardhino, I'm not happy
Welcome to Manchester United Jadon Sancho
10:27 onward. How is this GK It is just a couple of coaches taking shots into two goals next to each other with a man standing offside.. How often does that happen in a game? When the GK coach takes shots, after one practice Youll know everything about his kick. There are no surprises. Nothing. So how is this beneficial for GKs?
Lingard robbed
Great hard work training you England guys. Very best of luck in euro 2020. Come on you can go all the way.. Come on England.!!!!!!! I am a massive supporter. From Dan m. 👍👍👍👍🏐🏐🏐🏐🏐
COME ON KANE!
Hope everyone knows it’s not coming home...
Sancho doesnt look in great shape does he?
https://discord.gg/tfFAajvG
5:54 😂
Every lad deserves to be there, even the ones in the provisional squad
Super Jack Grealish will SHINE in the EUROS!!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿BIRMINGHAM🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Lombard should have gone, even if he doesn’t play he’s vital for the atmosphere and the dressing room
We're u at the boro ground or what
Goalkeepers will cost us 100%
Using lingard as the thumbnail then cutting him. Wow
Let’s go dey listening to polo g
Where did sancho’s German accent go? 😂😅
BT Sport's just rubbing it in with Jesse thumbnail
Wait, i thought Jesse wont be going to euro?
Still putting jlingz as the thumbnail even though he weren’t even picked for the final squad...but harsh init😬
better train your penalties lads especially keepers .. ELEVEN pens need to save ONLY one? is it hard for?
Grealish's calves
Lingard made it in the thumbnail but didn't make it to the squad.
Pickford over pope?
Sterling has only made the squad because he was in Reece James' pocket..
Jamie vardy?
Sancho muah
this is the difference between my national team (Spain) and England xdd
Pickford looks like Dean Henderson in fifa 21 😂😂
Hopefully Pickford turns into prime neuer now that England are playing
who else heard the through da storm playing in the background
What if they're taken to Afghanistan at war cos the way they train is too hard 😂
Ok, I will start doing these exercises now too
1:09 What shoes are these?
12:35 I tried to catch that irl 🤦🏻‍♂️
https://youtu.be/WAMvxod14DQ
Feel sorry for Lingard. Proved eveyone wrong with his brilliant outing in West Ham only to be left out
I dont know what more a player like ward prowse has to do to play for england, rather than just being a player from a top 6 team. He had done literally everything
Where’s rashford
Honestly Southgate deserves to get fired for not bringing Greenwood he’s so clinical in front of goal, he’s much better than Saka
"Warming up to get knocked out in the group stages
Should’ve left southgate at home and took Lingard
7:10 .... no.... it’s sunny init
Why at the very beginning are the England players playing btec rugby
Rrr
Whats the point of putting Lingard and Watkins in the starting 11 if there not even going to the euros
The illustrious valley subcellularly dam because salesman demographically muddle on a meaty ophthalmologist. vengeful, deadpan composer
come on England we gonna win the euros surely this year after world cup disappointment in 2018 in 2022 football is coming home again come on England🇬🇧
WELCOME TO DARLINGTON, I WILL BE AT ROCKLIFFE OVER THE WEEKEND HOPING TO SEE SOME OF THE PLAYERS AND STAFF
So fine they left him out
5:54 when bae says she’s home alone
watching the keepers training makes me wish i never quit football i miss the satisfaction i had making saves and i miss playing matches. highlight of my short lived career was winning the regional playoff for the algerian cup at U18 level unfortunately never saw it through with my team... Amel El Kiffane <3
Where is Rashford,Sterling, Dean?
Yes
I want someone to look at me the way mings and coady look at each other
ITS COMING HOME!
What’s the thing they’re using called at 0:38 seconds in?
DCL stretching with TAA just looks so wrong
Unpopular opinion but had to of been Lingard>Rashford and Godfrey > Mings/Coady
How are you gonna do Lingard so dirty by using him as your Thumbnail.
💫💫
The snobbish prison briefly marry because tail parenthetically breathe off a high-pitched trick. grandiose, unarmed cream
d
Coady and Mingys friendship
The sound the boots were making 😭✋
Why’s coady always in his feelings
the dislikes have to be scotland fans lol.
Can’t wait to have a full starting 11 of wing backs in a 5 back formation to be absolutely destroyed by north Macedonia in the last 16 by a 38 year old Pandev............
Tyrone mings: hehehhheheheh
Sancho has lost the German accent again 😂
They need to employ the team who do England rugby YouTube channel - this is primitive. RFU do a magnificent job for the fans
Up the Boro!
Fantastic training session 🙌🏽
Where’s Rash
Interesting with the pairings for stretches: Everton players with Liverpool players and United players with Liverpool players. Wonder if it is intentional to increase unity.
Lingard didn’t make the squad 😞 but somehow Saka did 😂, Southgate 🤡
Lingardinho on the thumbnail. Not going to the Euros
Lingard not making the EURO squad but making this video's thumbnail is just so dirtyyyy :'(
Ramsdale over Johnstone anyday
Clowns for not bringing Jesse
How many white Nike socks do you think the England squad alone go though in a day. They probably wear them once and then once the soles dirty Chuck them out
https://youtube.com/channel/UCKtIi7hJGXDbIYf3HkeO5mg
This Looks so easy
Lingardinho honestly deserved a spot on the squad
Rice clearly injured then
Nobody wanna see lingard there 👎🏻
Nobody:  Jack grealish’s calves - 😏
its boring without Kyle Walker and John Stones
Let's put lingard in the thumbnail then drop him hahaha
Watkins is rapid
Where’s Phil foden
I’ve seen harder goal keeping training at the high school level
https://youtu.be/LtbktGFszGs
Mings is rapid for his height
England: “Ollie Watkins fine finishing”. Also England: *excludes Watkins from euro 2020*
what i love about england is how much money we actually have and we still just use chairs in our sessions ahahahha
Ollie is a baller
Watkins finishing yet you only take 2 strikers out of 26. Dreadful.
Through da storm
5:52 🤣🤣🤣
Song from 2:25-3:10 please?
Love the behind the scenes trainings, keep it up! 🔥
Why did Jesse not get in the squad ...crazy Southgate
so lingard promotes your video on the thumbnail and gets fobbed out the squad.  big mistake
Watkins looked lethal in training, can't believe he'd rather take another RB
Practicing counter attacks and free kicks are the most important things an international squad can do.
U robbed lingard
5:53 Mings looks just like a cartoon villain
Someone please tell me why everyone’s saying euro 2020 it’s 2021 ffs what happened
Wait what. Why is lingz there??
We have Benzema back guys! Vive la France ! ;)
Gutted no Jessie in team man
A team that will never win a major cup ever again fact
https://youtu.be/TDOs92Gxm88
And later a few crates of lager and a bbq ....oh sorry that was the 96 England squad 🤣
England training vids before a major tournament have got to be my favourite vids on Youtube.
kane shorting his laces on his own person boots why didn’t they make them small for him😂
Come on england 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 👊 the euro 2020 champions🏆⚽️
And still they won't go further than the quarters......
You can take the lad out of Yorkshire but you can't take the Yorkshire outta the lad...it's warm init sithi.
I hate how they use Lingard for views but don't put him in the 26 man squad smh.
No more bantering other teams
Lingard robbed ...
with polo g in the gym 😍
06:25 for the golden boots
SAKA OVER JLingz, Southgates lost it
Where tf is Dean Henderson?
Jlingz has been robbed of his england spot
Lol Harry Kane wants to be in the nfl but can’t throw a spiral
Lingard robbed
two out of three lions are dortmund boys I’m loving life 💆🏻‍♀️
We’re gonna loose to Iceland I bet we don’t need so many defenders
11:25 camera man looks like lebron james
Nobody: Tyrone mings: hehehe
Amazing
Lingardinho rocking the yeezys
rip lingard :(
Oli Watkins puts the ball in the net that ruthlessly all drill... only to get left out of the squad all together a day later. What is Southgate playing at?
0:34 Ben why would you say that bruh 😂😂😂😂😂 he wylin fr
lol jesse lingard is not in the selection hes going home?
why make lingard the thumbnail and drop him from the squad....
2:56 Grealish needs to take him to the gym on leg day
it’s coming home
Watkins and Lingard should be going euros
So many talented players. With this squad we’ve got to do well. Come on England!
RIP sancho german accent
I am loving these England videos! Especially Bukayo Saka, I have to say, he is a magnificent influence!
Kane Golden boot is made of 3 penalties, 2 rebounds and one crazy deflection
6:53 deep man
1:40 Kalvin and all the tears of the England fans who don't want him in the squad
What a weird thing to show knowing that Lingard and Watkins weren't making it...
I’m sorry but Lingard should be in the squad over Sterling... robbery.
Whoever put a bit of polo g on whilst they were warming up inside deserves a raise
Lingard was in this video way too much for him not to be on the squad. Straight disrespect after his fantastic season.
Bruh they are all rapid wth😂😂😂😭😭
Ollies probably gonna start
No lingard no euro
I could look at Jack Grealish's calves all day!
These vids are so satisfying and easy to watch, the clubs should release more like these, especially the GK training 😉
Polo g in the background Jheez !🔥
What are the things called they put on their chest i dont know
Watkin's feeling peak rn
Someone there REALLY Likes polo g
is it jus me or sancho isn't looking like himself?,./,'
Why are they not at st georges park
Southgate wrong for dropping Jesse
Lingard 💔
Henderson's got pasty legs
What tranning ground is this
Mings an coady best duo I’ve seen
Love the grind hoping it comes home
Well lingard ain’t in it anymore
Could this video be more badly timed?
Put the man in the thumbnail and then cut him from the squad. Gareth you are a terrible video editor
Jack's calves lol wow
up the boro ! :P
pickford killed vvd
The tasty feedback occasionally welcome because drop immunohistologically reach abaft a peaceful cloth. ordinary, puffy lumber
Don't like training videos...these players deserve some privacy.
The biggest difference between this crop and our "golden generation" is that there's no cliques here. All the lads are boys are get on well with each on and off the pitch you can see it. Love to see it.
Face it its never coming home
Lingard isn't even in it anymore is he?
The thumbnail is awkward...
The last time we'll see Lingard in an England shirt.
Gotta say, it’s great seeing Jadon Sancho with the lads! 💪 Best of luck to England!
I’m confused how is lingard there ??
Just here as lingard has been dropped from the team for some reason
lingard robbed southgates a joker
Swear the players just don’t talk to each other
Great training session lads , let’s go win the euros!
0:52 they are playing KSI's song
Unfortunate thumbnail given lingard isn't in the squad anymore 😶
And then you leave Lingard out of the Euros...
The nerve Southgate has to drop Lingard and play 4 right backs is astonishing
Grealish's calves has a life of its own. Jesussssss
https://youtu.be/Z4M-oc0dKqU
https://youtu.be/Z4M-oc0dKqU
https://youtu.be/Z4M-oc0dKqU
https://youtu.be/Z4M-oc0dKqU
Ha - the contrast at 2:52 to 2:55 where the camera goes from tanned ripped calves (Grealish) to a pair of pale scrawny calves. (Not sure whose) Great shot! Love these videos though - great to see the hard work...
Where are the United players?
Lingard Robbed
ffs why isn't lingard in the euro squad???? have you seen the season he's had
How u gonna put Lingard in the thumbnail and then send him home. Disgraceful
It’s coming home
Pretty sad that now lingard is out of the team
Jordan Henderson is actually rapid 😂
“Looks like I’m doing summert”
Pickford is so bad
Average team, will get beaten by Scotland
Justice for lingard
How did Lingard get Injured
lingard is now officially out of the England squad HAHAHAHAH
Lingard in the thumbnail but he's left out the squad. Fraudulent southgate back at it
Koi indian h kya
Dad is ill"  "And I have not job and money"  "Youtube not giving me views"  "I want to handle my family"  "Ya I'm worse than others"😥

7:10 ‘Yo Neymar’
Looool, Fivio Foreign playing in the back
where is marcus rashford?
Proud of the Boro, facilities looks immense. Roll on the Euros 🦁🦁🦁
It’s coming home 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
5:53 absolutely killed me just the “hehehe”
England haven't won a giant of European football in the knockout stages of a major competition (world cup, euros) since the 1966 world cup(England did beat Spain in the quarter finals of euro 96 but a goal of Spain got wrongly dissalowed and England won on pens). Sorry for making you lose any hope of winning the euros this year, fellow England fans.
something about Bellingham bc he always says that sancho is cheating😂
Got hit with a 22-second unskippable ad before the vid!😳
1:22 heard that Polo G in the background 👀
Who wants to watch keeper trains for 3 min 💩
POLO G!!!!!
Ward-prowse free kicks = goal
The thing is with England they are a decent team but they are a level below the top teams, so in order to win those games they would have to play the perfect game which is highly unlikely. I think Q.Final would be a decent showing and S.Final would be a brilliant achievement.
Kalvin Phillips 💙💛  Ben White : The ReUnited
Where’s rashford ?
Whoever’s on the music should get a pay rise
Anyone else didn't see Marcus Rashford?!?!?!?!😰
england's best player for the thumbnail
Polo g in the background🥶
Whose playlist this is need to get a medal of honour
Where rashofrd
Know my grandma still with me, when it get cold, I feel your spirit.   Whoever played that is a legend. There’s a Polo G fan there. I think it’s Sancho
Goalkeepers are a bit stiff. Everyone else look in fine touch.
Dean Henderson > every english keeper
where's foden tho?
Ollie is just getting better and better. Manager/coaches joy as hes a lovely lad too. He will be on the plane
These guys actually live the best lives
Jesse loves a camera

Henderson, chillwell, maguire, stones, taa, rice, Henderson, mount, grealish, Kane and Sancho!
Lingard: Make it into the thumbnail, but not into the squad...legends will say he was too powerful
What is the song title in 1:00 ?
sonny init
Jesse needs to be in this squad! For his presents alone
Go go go
It's coming home , it's coming home
Mings and Coady are inseparable 🤣
Quick question where was Rashford and Foden?
Is it just me or is it kinda weird when the coaches/trainers talk to em like some sort of PE class..like for a second there you forget they're millionaires playing pro football at the highest level😂
thank you for considering ramsdale on the post, sir gareth
Pickford getting beat by every long shot
Bukayo looks so lonely
still not getting use to pickford with hair 🤣 he's charming tho 👍
Anyone here after lingard got axed from the squad
We want more keeper training
Coady is overrated
Whare's Declan?
The silky oxygen resultspreviously employ because word sequently hug apropos a astonishing gauge. real, poor latency
Wheres rashford
goop
How comes the United, City or Chelsea players haven’t arrived yet? I assume it’s that they’re resting after their finals
The keeper drill is twisting my melon man
Best training vids on this channel ❤️
The hysterical star laparoscopically back because snail legally confuse than a insidious coil. nervous, teeny-tiny alarm
Southgate worst manager of all time
Ask Gareth why he didn’t bring bamford
2:51 what u looking at ?
Polo g in the background 🐐
Oh they’re at rockliffe, nice
ramsdale looks like he’s solid in this
whats that shoe Kane wearing
where was rice
Imagine bringing on sancho and Jude in the 70th minute
Who is in 4:43??
6:55 "Yo sunny in it" - Lingardinho
Yo Jessie, Sunny init
Meanwhile chelsea boys still celebrating 🕺🏻💃🏻💙
Go to 3:36 to see England’s worse left back
Unfortunately England will still bottle it  😂
I cannot wait for the euros even excited for the friendlies.
Southgate is a clown hopefully he is sent to prison after the euros for crimes against football
Showing the warm ups is really helpful
0:58 love a bit of polo g
Who had the skinny white legs at 2:57
Lingard seems like such a nice person
12:40 to 13:40 leave the GK at home shocking
send saka home
0:35 Ben Godfrey sounds like Micah Richards
7:21. Class moment from Hendo
POLO G💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Jack Grealish ..... what a player !
Grealish s calves have more muscle than my arms do 😁
No rashford ...haven't seen him
Rasford , foden , Sterling, Maguire
Cant wait for you losers to bounce out of the group stages.  Alles les blues
Where's James ward prowse
In that training session it was sunny innit
*Take Trent*
where’s marcus?
I’m here for the Mings and Coady bromance 🤣
5:14 I hope after watching this Pickford doesn't get inspired and try to imitate it in the euros😂
Where was dean henderson
Where is my man Henderson in goal
9:38 to trippier “buenos señor” 🤣🤣
It's coming home. Any debate is illegal.
Grealish’s calves are just a joke 😅😅
The Chelsea boys still hammered I see, no Mount or Chillwell aha
Where’s Rooney??
Shout out polo
The daffy collar chiefly man because cancer adventitiously explode along a painful eagle. staking, limping april

We need players like jack grealish and James wardprowse
Take lingard
Could anyone also hear patience by JJ (Ksi) in the background
I hope Trent Gets picked :(
Let’s goooo 🔥🔥 Hoping to win the euros🔥💥❤️😊
Yo England, sunny innit! 😂
is rashford not in the squad or did i just not see him?
Watkins deserves to be in this squad. Only people saying otherwise are Leeds fans. Watkins provides a different kind of striker. Bamford, Kane and DCL would have been so boring
KP with the most Yorkshire thing ever. “Warm innit”😂
Where is Marcus
fifa headquarters looking at acceleration and sprint speed  ✍✍✍
7:21 respect 🙌🏻
harry kane to the nfl?
When you get a supply pe teacher 🤣
#justiceforbamford
12:07 i cant be the only one
The England keepers are washed
It’s coming home
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁🦁🦁🌟
This trend with players tucking half their shorts up their legs does my nut in
Lingard has a lot of personality .. maybe it’s needed
so happy to see Lingard here
Ramsdale can't make it man
Goalkeeper training when
I see lingard I click
0:50 KSI has somehow found his way into Englands training ground
PICK TRENT
Lets goo kalvin, ALAW
Who’s here after lingard got dropped 😢
Ben White is Leeds.
If Rashford starts over grealish after the final display I'll be gutted.
TRENT IN! HE IS STILL THE MOST CREATIVE RIGHT BACK IN THE SQUAD EVEN IF HE DIDN'T HAVE THE BEST SEASON. #TRENTIN
JWP?
Where's Ivan Toney?
Where's Rashford?
It’s safe to say Harry Kane can’t play QB so should probably stay as a striker for us.
5:18 see 99 physicality
i love these guys so much but i’m not even English, im a motswana 😭✋🏽
this video has shown how much of a machine Ollie is, those shots are 10/10 🤩
No Trent no party banter Country think they can't actually win it hahaha
Lingard and Henderson seems like the most unlikely partnership. Like when the teacher partners up the class clown with model student 😂😂😂
Using JLINGZ as clickbait this is what you call real youtubers
So sad Trent Alexander Arnold is out England squad for Euro Cup
the champions of euro 2021
We're going to win this lads!!!
What training ground is this it looks different
Nobody cares , I hope Croatia knock you guys out
Notice how chelsea city and united players aren't there. Guess that's because of the finals.
Ollie Watkins 👌
2020?
Love from id
Where’s Phil foden
Best training facilities in the country at Rockcliffe
It's coming home lads!!!
Bye bye jesse lingaard
Why was Trent not chosen
Ofc jack grealish’s calves had to make it in the vid 😂😂
Lingard has been dropped stinky decision
Polo g through the storm, what a tune
Did not see rashford once
Can’t believe he isnt taking Trent, Greenwood or lingard
Remember watching these videos every day during the World Cup. So excited for the Euros.
WHERE IS DECLAN RICE

Dortmunder jungs 💛
Yeah no lingard no party southsgay

I know they graft but these blokes don’t half live a brilliant life!! Fair play to them can’t knock it I wouldn’t say no
When are they gonna announce the 26 man squad  guys And where?
Joke you didn’t pick lingard or tent no wonder why we can’t win anything under South Gate
The English are coming 🥶🥶🥶🔥🔥

Hey England! Can we get a "boot on concrete" ASMR? 6:40
Where is Rice
In that in middlebrough because UTB
nothing beats an england training video😎
Where is Rice?
Ollie Watkins finishing is on point
How Mingz is playing for a top 50 national team, nevermind England, is beyond me
Nobody: Absolutely nobody: Godfrey: 0:34
Poor Lingardinho having fun just to be kicked out a few days later
Lingardinho: we're blessed everyday. The light is love. Kalvin phillips: it's warm innit
sack southgate i stg
I love how when Godfrey was doing that warm up at 0:30 he’s like “does it look like I’m doin’ something  Edit: Iykyk
Hi
I'm South African but I live for your video updates. Best of luck for the gentlemen in the upcoming games ❤️. Will be watching and supporting from SA
Love these but why aren’t they training with the right ball?
JLINGS
Amma use these drills at home 😂
Why is lingard  not picked for them team ridiculous
7:10 - not hearing 'might be too warm' in response hurt my soul
LET’S GO BELGIUM
Where rashford
Trent
My final 26 : Dean Henderson, Pickford, Johnston, Walker, TAA, James, Trippier,  Maguire, Stones, Coady, Mings, Shaw, Chillwell,  Rice, Phillips, Henderson, Mount, Bellingam, Kane, Foden, Rashford, Sancho, DCL, Saka, Grealish, Sterling.
Great video, keep the content coming 😀

Croatia will win don’t underestimate them #Hrvatska

Where’s Henderson in goal?
Trick to Harry Kane’s incredible finishing:       Cut your laces to be shorter 😂
Trent looks sharp
Watkins 99 finishing 🤩
you can sledgehammer someone with Grealish's calves
Remember my name Edward Gyan - 2025 will have his debut for a professional contract for a big top 6 team!
Watkins looks to be in the mood
Love the songs in the background
Tyrone mings with the exercise ball: Hehehe hwapow
Ollie Watkins looks ready
What's the point of putting lingard on the thumbnail when he is Not in the squad Just embarrassing 😒🤨
Where is Deano ?
Jlingz why isn’t he in the squad
Patience by KSI at 0:50

7:10 You alright Kalvin ye sunny innit
What Lingardinho really thought at 6:52 was ay yo rashy sunny innit?
Apparently Greenwood has pulled out and Lingard too. So Saka should keep his spot.
