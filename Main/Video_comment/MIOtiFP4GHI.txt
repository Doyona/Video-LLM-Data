When she played Travis verse😮‍💨
From one "Where you have been" to the next, you can really see the lifestyle and world transformation of Solana from CTRL to SOS.
Coming back to this
like this if you’re here because she left her manager punch
Watching this again now that she has revealed her split from Punch as her manager
sza's personal life is so crazy solana, please take a break and rest up, your amazing!
Hearing SZA cry was like getting repeatedly stabbed in the chest. That just hurt to hear…
Ppl have no idea how draining it is to pour one's soul into song. To tour for months on end no break. Its a sacrifice these artists are making. I was a producer and composer for 35+yrs. When i finally quit in March 1 2024 i had a breakdown. Tore me in half. Broken I'm still trying to heal.  Please be grateful for artists like SZA bc its a painstaking mission, making music no less on a world stage. She gave up her freedom for you all. Be thankful & give her the flowers TODAY 🎉🎉🎉❤
SZA IS PERFECT 🩷🌊💸
thank you Sage for documenting all of this and more
Bro I watched this 20 times
SZA I Love YOUR Videos ❤
Love to see the background of the album, all the process you passed and feelings
I MAY BE CRAZY BUT DID TRAVIS HOP ON LOW?????? 4:51
i love her sm. she’s so talented and she had been making amazing music for 13 years!! i love her sm. #szasupremacy
solana, this album helped me through so much. literally the way you were exhausted after putting all your energy and time into something that your label may even delay for another 5 years, that hurts. but they can never take your originality, your talent, and your soul. thank you so much. as your fans, we are so thankful that you put in sm energy to release this album. i really don't know where i would be without it.
Sza is all thighs baby
0:00 SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS SOS                        LANA IS COMING…..
I love Solana💓
Love u ;)
WE LOVE YOU MAMA SZA!🥹🫶
SZA ❤️
you're everything to me, i love you so much Solana
Obviously RCA it’s the reason why SZA released SOS 5 years after Ctrl, because y’all know that RCA it’s a shit
G'day from Brisbane ❤ 😊
Hearing SZA cry makes me sad and I might cry
This is so sad. This is what Normani is probably going through omg. 😢 but artist try to cooperate with their labels so the album can come out that’s why Normani is quiet. SZA was right and look how successful the album turned out to be.
2:50 was heartbreaking ❤️‍🩹 😢❤
The best album ever
I am still waiting for the Vinly and SOS DELUXE
Does anyone know why the featured artists on the whiteboard weren’t on the album? Because I would’ve loved to have seen a collab with Billie, Tyler, or Doja 😢
all of a sudden she became chubby?
I love her so much😭
Its
raw
When Sos was crying, i was ready to fight someone. 😤
i can see her hard work and now she succesfull with the sos album
I guess they forgot ctrl was all over the charts
Thank you 💗
Keep soaring, Solana.🙂 I'm proud of you.😄
Yes love it❤
Sza i love you
Soooo stressful. Hugs
SHE DELETED THE KILL BILL VID?
Release big boy
I’m so sorry you had to go through that SZA. I absolutely loved the album and it was well worth the wait!❤❤❤
Drop the Kill Bill MV already

I love you ❤ scorpios unite ✨
Waiting 4 clarity
SZA’s music is my sole mate

Love music, but no more injections plzzzz stop with that
She looks depressed.
Job well done sza so proud of your hard work love you 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
We love you solana, You deserve everything and more ❤👑
I'd catch a case for SZA.
I love shawty so much
I love sza🩷
Thank you for being brave enough to be vulnerable and show the struggle and pain behind creation.  When artists create something, people see the beauty in it but don't see everything that's had to be done behind the scenes to bring new art into existence.
Ill be here for sza and awaiting that damn Vinyl pack 😢❤
This bitch mad thicc
i love this woman.
Where’s the killbill video ????
You said you didn't want to be labelled as an rnb artist but you use an hashtag with just the rnb genre? 🤨
Love you and your sound sza❤❤❤

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN LOCA?!
Sza don’t be sad and depress please take care of your self priority your hapiness , we will always here for u ❤  be strong.!   - from philippines 📍🇵🇭
Please don't use Hell as if it is a word. Hell is a place, a real place that separates us from God eteranally for those who have went agaisnt God, those who broke His commandments, those who dethrone Him, those who live a unrepented life, those who cause others to sin purposefully and not repent, those who lead people astray from God purposefully and not repent, etc. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. (Revelation 21:8). I don't want you to go there or anyone else. I pray that everyone goes to Heaven by turning away from sin, repenting, living for God, picking up your crosses, denying yourself and flesh, walking daily with God, etc. Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: (Acts 3:19-20).
that is so fucking pretty
i love how sza is back and better than ever, and im totally obsessed with the new sos album!! love you queen <3
I absolutely love her.
YESSSSS SZA YESSSSSS
Solana bae wow ily
Love you
I love sza personally and energy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤
Ooooohh perfect timing, cleaning the storage of my pc, resetting and relaxing then finally going to sleeeep. Much love sza sza, every tiime. s.m.s - shellfish Mars
OMG SZA DONT CRY GIRL UR GONNA MAKE ME CRY 😞😞 THANK YOU FOR YOU HARD WORK AND DEDICATION WE LOVE YOU 😄
00:38 Name song ? ... I love so much
Merry Christmas and God Bless you and your family 👪
Her crying hurt me so much because it shows that she was tired of extending the date and sick of all of the pressure she had been receiving. Some people don’t understand that she couldn’t control the release especially everyone that joked about her being liar probably affected her emotional. It wasn’t SZA’s fault that the album was taking so long to be released. I’m so proud of her and I have been patience because her team were probably doing for a good cost and the album came out perfectly and it’s my favorite album of 2022! Thank you so much SZA! We love you! 🤍🆘
I will literally murder u if you come close to my speaker again
We need one of them disney+ documentarys on this album
<3
THE FACT SZA HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON HER MENTAL HEALTH AND HER BODY SHOWS GROWTH
Hey Miss Solana. You don't know me and I really don't know you past your name and your stage name of SZA but if you ever read this I wanna say thank you. Thank you for making me cry, for getting me through some of my worst days, for making me think, for saying stuff so harshly that I know I could never say. Your latest album I finished listening too like 10 mins ago and I need time with it but I understood it. And thank you for it. It's given me much to think about. Also just thank you for your voice. I barely discovered you this year and listening to CTRL and SOS was something I wanna experience again. You are so talented, amazing, breathtaking, and absolutely priceless. A quote I once heard is "Your mess is your message" and honestly if you have ever faced any of these things please know your never alone and your always loved by the people who truly care about you. Your doing absolutely fine and I wish you all the health, happiness, and peace in the world. Take a break, exfoliate, and drink some water looking at your success from on high. You deserve it and much more Sincerely, Your Fan -Daniel (Ps if your ever in la let me know I'd love to play violin for you one day since I'm trying to become a musician too!)
The fact that they wanted to hold the album back, and it's Christmas and it's still topping the charts with the Christmas music... Trust urself. Dope shit can't wait to see her on tour
Yoooooooo
It was worth the wait 🙏   You are always worth the wait
Beautiful vocals. Melody 🎵
In my fug skin healing ❤️‍🩹 from US
❤🔥🔥🔥🔥👑
Minha esposa
SOO YOU GONNA RELEASE BIG BOY OR NAHH???
words cant explain how much I love Solana❤️
Body PERFECT
I love sza
me and my sister are so happy for her!! hope she comes near us
we love you sza and we love everything you’ve done for us ❤
the only bad thing about this album is that travis flopp is on the album
Solana the woman that you truly are. I love you and am forever grateful
Hands down my favorite artist. My best friend in my head. She works so hard. I cried when she cried
you're....just....too......ahhhhh.... dont even have the words <3
One thing about Travis he always pull through for SZA
I love you soo much
Waiting for hold me close🫠
Mannn. I loveeeee this woman oh so much. I remember when she released Z and I knew she was going to be so special 🫶🏾. I’ll never forget when I listened to Ctrl (2017) I was just a young girl figuring out who I am and what is my purpose in this world. Here I am in my 20 somethings listening to her SOS album and by far one of the best albums on the universe 💯. It was very much worth the 5 year wait and she needs her flowers asap 💐. Thank you for sharing your vulnerability in this album, showing your growth, and your precious heart 😭.  I just wanna say thank you thank you 😭💜. We (the fans) love you so much 😔 in all you do. You never disappoint and your music is so therapeutic. Thank you for watering me for who I am and always, much success!    - Much love, Camp Ctrl Member Kayren ⛺️🌲💜
shes the moment
Artista ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Awww I love this, SZA put everything into this album and it’s incredible
Thank you for being so open and vulnerable and for an AMAZING ABLUM! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this album! 😍😍
❤
so grateful for this album and all that sza does
I’m so grateful for not just this album but this video, is so important to see not just the rise because baby you been a star but the falls too. This dream so many want so bad it’s hard as hell ❤
All worth it 🥺🌊🎶💫✨😍❤️
oh to be sza🫠
So proud to see how far she’s come. Will always have love for SZA and her music. She’s a big reason I even started making my own music for my very small fanbase. Love you SZA! Thank you for always being your authentic self and sharing your art with us!
4:40 .... she can send her tracks when she wants to. Wtf why do we need some bruh to nod for her to have the power she should already own? Mmmmmmmmm...🤔🙄😔
u need to leave ur label period
Sza is the gift that keeps giving and she brings magic every time she sings and it’s beautiful
Imagine a Reality Show about SZA life😭❤️❤️❤️
Luv you SZA❤
Im so glad to see she's been progressing through her growth, we're all here to support <3
THIS IS SO CUTE
SZA has really gone through a lot. 🆘 really deserve it's recognition because it's beautiful. It's just annoying how people be sitting there saying bad things about her  when they can't even accomplish anything themselves. Nobody is perfect so don't judge her.
Ummm during 1:46 there’s a lot of writing but I feel like I see: Kendrick, Tyler (the creator?), Frank (Ocean?), Kasey Musgraves, Olivia Rodrigo, Doja, Bad Bunny, Rosalia, Halsey, Billie+Finneas, were those all possible collabs/ideas? Could you imagine if we got some of those on the deluxe??
I hate that artists have to go through all this but this Album is so beautiful Sza WE LOVE YOU
Her bbl is killin me 😭😭😭
❤️❤️🔥
solana imani i thank you.
sza i love you so much you’re amazing . when you started crying at 2:35 i felt so bad . you deserve nothing but love n happiness and i can’t wait to see you in february
You really saved 2022 with this album SZA
This makes me really appreciate sza more
I’m glad she dropped this video! So can’t nobody blame her for the wait! She tried to drop her album when WE wanted it, it was her label so STOP CALLING SZA A LIAR PLS N THANK YOU
To be a senior in high school when Ctrl dropped from Scorpio sista sza changed my life more than I can say and to be a 24 year old five years Later this album changed my life even more Thnks for the music sza worth the wait ❤
You are a goddess. Idk if y’all peeped the board tho. I had frank as a feature and his name underlined 🥺🥺
We love you Solana. Never doubt yourself. Ever.
You sing from the heart and I hear it &  I just love your voice ❤️ so 💗 FUCKING 🔥 MUCH 💞🔥❣️
i can’t even begin to tell you how many times i’ve listened to this album. can’t even begin
Put in years of work to get where she’s at, never stopped betting on herself. That’s ill ass fuck! As an underground artist, I love seeing success stories like SZA. She gives me constant encouragement and belief in myself and what I’m trying to make. So happy for you SZA, you deserve this so much. Thank you for your consistency and tenacity🔥❤️
W Trav
Im just seeing that shes under RCA… that really explains the mistreatment they did that with a lot of artists. RCA curse is real.
Don't know if all of the stress was worth for her, but for me there hasn't been a full 24 hours that's passed since 12/9 that I'm not blasting SOS through the walls and waking the neighbors up. Hope she's proud of this masterpiece
sza is an artist true to her craft; we love and support her
WE LOVE YOU SZA. YOUR MUSIC IS TIMELESS. SO PROUD OF YOU. FOREVER THANKFUL FOR YOUR MUSIC
I literally love you smmmm
Sza truly understanding her feelings and the way life go but she knows😂
Yes SZA, albums do not come out of nowhere, you gotta have more experience in life to write about!! Do whats authentic for you always ❤❤❤
i love trav and sza’s friendship so much 🥹🫶🏿
💓damn i need a whole documentary 😂 I wanna hear hear sing in the studio
GET A DEAL WITH HULU!!
😢😢😢😢😢
Sza wearing all white and covering that hair... she getting initiated??
LOVE SEEING YOU JUST LIVING YOUR LIFE🥹🥹💗
my love
I love that even though SZA/Solana was under pressure and in tears she didnt bash out her emotions on people ,that shows how mature of an artist she is overall.If she decides that shes done with music i understand and she will still be the goddess of music and vibes.😌💖
i’m rly glad she put this out…bc ppl were pressuring tf outta solana n the ppl that r doing it NEEDS to watch this
Thank you for sharing so much with your fans we love and appreciate you so much ❤️
Deluxshi！Deluxshi！😆 SZAAAA！😝😝😝
Why am I crying ?????
Seriously I'll never understand why labels do this to female artists, just prevent them from releasing albums when they're ready even when they've released successful singles. They did it to JoJo, SZA and most likely are doing it to Chlöe and Normani. Just makes no damn sense to me
That’s it? No pt 2 or nothing? Just a reel Lol
more pls.
why did this make me love my favourite songs even more
SZA in my opinion, is a Sade, M.J, Prince, you know...the ones you just shutup and wait those years patiently for lol. The lady is just that great. No dedate.
THANK U SOLANA!
whutup with that features whiteboard 😳😳😳Pls ppl hand in tha verses for the deluxe album 😭😭
The fact that Punch was worried that she’d do numbers before the holidays and wanted to push it back to next year😒😒. Glad she stood her Ground. One of the best!!!! Congrats SZA
No one should have that power over you at 2:30
i love you
Solana, all the ups and downs were worth it. You released a piece of art. And you are breaking records like crazy.
Where the hell have you been loca
This album is EVERYTHING! I felt her blood sweat and tears through this. Please don't stop making music. You are truly a ⭐! I just love the authenticity that you deliver. Can't wait for you to come to DC!!!
This got me wanting the SZA documentary so bad...! Ayesh...! 😭🥺😣
Thank you for sharing with us this venerable moments mama, we love you and you are AMAZING.  I am in love with this ALBUM OMG can't stop listening to it 😍😍😍
I LOVE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Love this 🖤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
TDE are a little harsh and heavy handed it sounds like. They are one of the best labels ever though.
her singing along to blind at the end 🥺
😭
watching this while hearing snooze really hit different 😼
We love u sza
Nice hit Sza you can't stop entertaining us Thx we will try to support you through your journey
WE NEED AN HOUR LONG OF THIS DOCUMENTARY! 😭💓🙌🏽
Much appreciation for all hard work that went into this album we love you and thank you
Album of year.
I've always believed that SZA never cares about numbers, but the enjoyment in making music & releasing it for her fans. After watching this video, I'm unbelievably in tears and so happy for her that she could release the album the way SHE wanted. I'm proud of you, SZA.
🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🌍
omgggg
Solana we all love you take care of yourself 🫶🏾🫶🏾
Why do I need a full documentary from sis  I don’t expect one but I enjoyed this so much another hour or so, wouldn’t hurt❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love this song much I wish I could live it💯❤
When she cried it made me die...
❤
Thank you SZA/Solana for working so hard on yourself so that you could put energy into this album. Everyone always asks artists "where's the album?" But if it's not here yet there's a reason and we should never ask someone to rush that process because they are human too. Stop forgetting that.
thank you sza 🫶🏽 .
We love you girl ❤❤❤
Punch is so…. UGH
ok auntie imma need moreeee😩😩 I liveeee for a doc
i would die for a sza doc
Tired of sza management, I rlly wished she gets new management.
Bra I love sza and I appreciate this glimpse it made me emotional I love her but can we have a whole doc??
2:16 If you came from that one tiktok!
This is everything! Thank you for being so brave enough to showcase your vulnerability to us.

Who can make up all the features she wrote down?
how is no one talking about the white board with all this FEATURES!? so many good artists there and i hope they all end up on the deluxe
Damn alot of people stepped over sza when she needed them 😫😫
Thank you S! You are literally my voice when I can’t say all the things out loud I’m thinking that your pen wrote. I love you so much. I’m so beyond grateful for you. And I can’t wait to see you in SAN DIEGO 3.13.23 BABY! ❤❤❤❤
LOVE YOU SZA FOREVERRRRR. THANK YOU FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ARTTTT
SHE DID HER BEST !!
They just wouldn’t understand ❤️
ela sabe que é fodona!
I would 1,000,000,000% watch a SZA documentary. SOS: Making the album. ❤
Thank you my Scorpio sista ❤️ I know this whole process was stressful and it shows in this video. Album of the century for sure 🔥❤️
To Hear You Worked with Sadhguru is truly magical! I HAVE LOVED YOUR MUSIC since day one! And for you to give spirituality some awareness is something so important in this time! Im so happy for you. ☺️
The part of her crying 😓
Love SZA, and this album is Golden
You don't owe us anything, so thank you for sharing. I love the album.
SZA, please release a documentary about the making of this album. Or at least about you 🙏🏻
kai cenat wants you
Thank you Sza we luv u also did u guys hear her she said there is a vinyl pack ahhhhh
i love u so much sza!!! grateful for you and your hardwork. thank you for always pushing through!!! <333
SZA really is an authentic individual. It's unfortunate that the industry has worn her out along the way, but this also shows how much love she has for her fans to put quality music in a timely manner. ❤️
love you forever SZA. your music saved me many times:) this new album is beautiful
Missed you so much SZA baby🥹🥹🥹
OKAY BUT WHO SAID YOU COULD GET THAT CAKED UP?! Mkaaaay but rewind to “Garden” & Ms Solana is them lyricssss
Sza upset is everything ❤❤❤❤❤ Sza happy is blessing ❤️❤️❤️❤️ SZa is love ❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
icon. I Must Say
I love her music like i i've never done before with any artist.
SZA really giving it back to the fans this SOS era and i'm living for it
I wish Travis never sent in those damn vocals. Open Arms woulda been so much better without him. I also wish Frank had been on the album
pink hair sza is absolutely flawless omg
What is the first song?
Solana, u change my life I love so much ❤
I loved this BTS soooo much! Nobody understood how stressful this really was on you Solana ! Love you 4L∞🫶🏾
Congratulations on releasing your album SOS. I know you getting ready for farm life now. U deserve it. Have fun on tour too!
Thank you SZA and the whole team for creating this album. PLS MAKE MORE
Seeing this behind the scenes, show that she cares about her ART. Seeing her going though ups and down of the industry and seeing her struggling of her album getting released, you made a body of work and it was worth the wait ✨✨✨❤️❤️❤️
Is it just me or this is like a very mini  documentary?? Like, I want more, in fact, I NEED ALL OF IT pls pls pls
this album is amazing
It brought me to tears when she cried and said she was tired at 2:50. There’s nothing worse than seeing your hard creative work being stalled or sabotaged… She deserves every bit of success she’ll definitely receive for this masterpiece!!! ❤❤❤
im so proud of you sza
We don't deserve her 😭😭
So its true that it wasn’t her fault, WE’RE SORRY SZA!!! This is like fucked up they kept doing that..
thank you for sharing your beautiful art with us 🖤
WOAHHHHHHH thank you for letting us in behind the scenes!!
The album is phenomenal and it’s doing amazing!!!! I hate that sza had so much pressure on her with the release!
I love you sm 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
sza is truly an angel sent from God and was put on this earth for a reason. i’ve never been so drawn to an artist, she’s the only artist i’ve fully been able to relate to and puts my feelings into words and songs when i’m unable to speak and understand them myself. she deserves all the love and praise, she is so talented and works so hard, we all go through rough times no matter how perfect our lives may seem, so including clips of her crying and struggling really makes her a real, true artist. i haven’t seen her in concert yet but you best believe i’ll be draining my bank account to see her this tour 😂   protect sza at all costs ❤️
Wow I know SZA is excited that this album is finally done.. Peace and Freedom.. I hope you enjoy your retirement once your tour is done. 🤍
I love this & I love you
LADIES, THEYDIES AND GENTS, SOLANA IMANI ROWE 👏🏻👏🏻
she needs a new label .. i’m so sorry sza
The album is the BESTTT
SZA LIVING HER BEST LIFE ERA
The album is perfect sza. but please tell me some of those features got be on the deluxe 😭😭
I love sza she’s grown so much 😩🫶🏽

Wait… I heard vinyl packeting….. so we getting it in vinyl!!!! 🎉
interesting that tde thinks that the seasons affect sza um sza affects the seasons— everyone gonna listen no matter what no matter if im on my deathbed imma wait for the music to drop idc!!!!! hope that all the blessings come your way from this album sos we love you dearly 🤍
I hate TDE fr. Istg if they made us wait any longer for this album bruh..
I feel like she did something similar when CTRL was about to get released so this feels very nostalgic. I love this ❤️
YES GWORL!!!!!!
I am in the first hour here
WE LOVE YOU SZA❤❤
WHY SO MANY FEATURES ON THAT BOARD???  ROSALIA? DOJA? WHAT ABOUT GRIEF? RODEO?
We love you !! Thanks for sharing this with us, you didn’t have to. Your breaking breaking records and barriers, just focus on you and continue to be SOS 💙

i need an 1 hour doc because you have sm story to tell about the past 5 years
I love you and SOS with all of my being but these ticketmaster prices are insane.
Sza babes you changed the way I perceived life ever since CTRL cause it's not every day artists make music that you resonate with so with SOS it just feels the same you know having someone make music which you genuinely relate too so from the bottom of my heart thank youuu
I almost cried with her. Thank you for this album Sza.. despite it all. This album is incredible and so worth the wait.
No more NYC dates, tour announced a week after the album. 😭 I wasn’t ready… how you drop this masterpiece and only a chosen get to attend. It wouldn’t be so dire but you’re retiring or take long breaks. I’m not ready 😭
SOS on repeat 🔁 run it back
Wtf
Thank u sos thank u thank u thank u . People don’t realize the hard work that really goes into all of this and the timing. We all just watch from the outside and just see what u share. I can’t even put into words how grateful I am that in my life time your spirit is here with us all. So genuine so hard so real. Thank you for holding your ground in what you know you want to do to change this society thru your music and your expression. I will forever be here by your side cheering you on. Thank u
It is a emotionally process to make such a wonderful sza album. Thanks for let to us see inside these days girl.

WE COULD'VE HAD HARRY AND SZA
Solana NEVER doubt yourself. The industry is shadey, the award shows are bias, and the press is hell. But none of that will ever take away the power and the greatness of your artistry and the support you have behind you on some real shit! Thank you for this album, thank you for your contributions to music, and thank you for being you! ❤
And, just like Amy Dunne, she returned triumphantly 🥰
i love her!! she is just so many words she just amazing and i’m so proud is u solana!!
we appreciate you sza <3
"The vinyl pack is done!" 👀👀
No shade but open arms sounds exactly like the last song to get done. Beautiful album nonetheless
I can’t wait to see you in Toronto ❤ I was AT REBEL WHEN U FIRST CAME IN 2017 TOO 😭

Hearing SZA..Hearing Solana through her tears, excitement and doubts for this album truly is heartbreaking yet a full circle moment. SZA released A beautiful body of work, just as CTRL was, SOS is timeless. We’re so proud of her.
we need a documentary!!
awwww the part where she was crying ☹️☹️☹️
the album is perfect and i’m so proud of uuuu!!!
I'm so sorry she had to go through that and other artists who has been in situations like this as well my heart is hurting 💔  But I'm glad she's smiling in the end 😊
So glad she did everything at her own pace
This is the best song on the album
