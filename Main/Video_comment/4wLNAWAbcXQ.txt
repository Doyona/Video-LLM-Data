@8:35 @Fab Rats  While Paul was saying how you spray towards your buddy and not yourself, I could really see how much Landon is like Paul! It is always wild to see how much kids are like their parents!!
DAMN BOY, that's an old video 😲 Cheers from Sweden.
I thought was Roby Lynn wife bronco 😊
Don’t tell them kids, but I think the rooster is wearing bubblers !
Twas good to see Ben again.
Marianne is a Swedish candy!!
Lots done & the tasting.  Love that Bronco
Mrs fab rat  absorbs enough through skin os mosis
Matt might get some if you like hurry up and comes over 😅
Paul's drunk off chocolate 😂
I'm bustin a gut here..." They did a really good job and I don't want to come back here again"
Whatever happened to the red tool box the lady donated to you from her husband
Nice carb like em got some good service out of my 750
You guys are awesome I love that you gave your brother that was probably the best thing you could have done
Paul, is Ben, you actually your real brother? or just a best friend that's like your brother?
Sorry the best Chocolate comes from Hershey, PA. Ron
That Chevy is beautiful!
Burnout is mice exterminion
Boss is away the mice will play lol
cell-phone light "candling", that's a new one on me! but it makes sense with how bright they are now, same for LED flashlights.
what is that green plastic film/brace contraption when getting the root canal. all I recall is my jaw getting sore and and closing down on the dentists fingers/tools. once had a cavity drilled and filled without novocaine, because my dad did. difference was his very minor cavities. on mine, the dentist was cringing and asked multiple times if I wanted him to stop and numb it up, NO, I said and he continued on as I bent the dental chair armrests inwards. I was maybe 13 and the dentist's name was "Dr.Payne". not joking/pure serious history.
the old R for race backing up fast, combined with neutral dropping(car full).... I know about that, nor neutral dropping coming into a left turn in front if high school(lol). that's when it went BANG and turned the spider gears into chunks. transmission survived, driveshaft, ring/pinion all good until it got totaled in street playing with friends. lol Chevette/Pontiac T1000's cars. tough little turds really, we beat them like red-headed step children and race cars(slow/lol) some of the most fun and bad times we all had.
I'm more of an edelbrock delete and holley installer(carburetors), same for quadra(bog)jets. but in the end, they all have their flaws, although some can be worked around easily. I like to keep it simple, minimal to no electronics for off road usage, on road it depends on the vehicle, type and usage patterns, carb or some efi setup.
that hei is making me sick to my stomach
What nice gifts....those chocolates are wonderful, I've sampled some of those....
👍FROM CADILLAC MICHIGAN
👌
Nioooo😮😮😮😢😢
You guys are awesome, would love to bring my 72 bronco out there and go wheeling with you... Mine is just not built to withstand what you guys do. Great videos, good wholesome content is appreciated...Thanks Jim
I really like the rats
Broncos are not Chevrolet's 😂
Do not show dental work on video 😳
Honda makes a rat cover to go over wires and hoses, and it's got hot sauce on it to keep them from  eating everything
Please don't show the dentist episodes next time. I don't like to watch it 😷🥴
The right carb for this motor is a 480 CFM Holly.
I had a '67 Bronco half-cab.....It ran great!   Miserable piece of shit as a daily driver.  It bucked like a bronco going down the road.  The top seal leaked like a sieve and no amount of fixing helped it........I had wet nuts every time it rained. These things are top-heavy and very overrated......
have you ever thought to get a pressure bleeder for brakes, they work well, and faster
So you're saying one rock bounce off a derby car and broke both your after flying over to bed it went through the back window and broke the front
Don't think I haven't noticed Michelle looking great
Those Kit Kats were likely from Japan. I purchased some last time I was there.
old  school  rules  i  say
You boys be kind to that Bronco, I owned a 71 white /blue that I bought new,.
I love the fact that they have found true happiness it really feels like it. Love all that they do.
Very nice burnout!
f100 80s     3 speed in the tree  with 50s and a straight 6 300 awsome
Paul, you know that WD-40 is a penetration oil, not a lubricant. You mentioned that a linkage needed some attention. That WS-40 was what you would put on it. Maybe regular oil won’t fix it, butt wouldn’t regular oil work better than WD-40 ?  Please commit !!
That Bronco looks exactly like one I used to drive. It was even red in the beginning and it was painted blue. OMG it brings back memories.
Paul's videos get A 👍👍 even before I watched them. I like em beforehand always ☺️
It's a Ford what it barn up
whatever became of Landon's red pickup?
ALWAYS dependable fun enjoyable content along with Paul humor and now with TONS of chocolate. What more could you want?
Darn it!!! I was just getting over my candy cravings! I Never!
WOW!  I’m shocked about what Michelle said when testing chocolate….It says a lot about somebody’s personality when you choose not to share with Matts off Road!   The Finland Folks were nice enough to send it, but i wonder if That would’ve ever been reciprocated and now I have my answer!
Love it
it sure look like a rat more than a mouse to me. I never see baby's rats like that before hanging on their mom like that
Love your chickens.  That gorgeous hen beats burnouts in the garage.  What a chicken!
That was Great 👍Video  Love your work Great Fabrication  Have a Great Day 👍 God Bless America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Michele, just for your information, you are not the reason why I watch Fab Rats videos!!!
Great work and burn out too.God bless you all.
that candy is not good for your weight and also not for your teeth
Paul you are a problem solver, lol
Good job Michelle.
Both broncos I've ever had I couldn't wait to get rid of them.  I tried to like them but Ford is just so poorly made I couldn't stomach it.  76 bronco fixed up and sold for a 69 Camaro and 68 bronco traded for new 2003 Suzuki Eiger 400 that had rolled but fixed, way better machine, still running strong.
did you find your fenders for the truck?  if not i have a lot of them, hit me up if you need them.
❤️👍👍👍👍👍😎
Literally one of my favorite vehicles you guys should build it like the yota
Ben is a Genius! What Can't He Do??? Excellent Video Y'all ❤️
awesome little bronco with some really cool mods. Great work, and awesome content,
Paul's wife was built in a lab. She is not normal. Everything most men would want in a woman, lucky bastard. My last three wives constantly complaining, insulting, spending money ,mean......
Is this really cat treats
I miss Randall
candling the eggs for the kids was cool!  Especially using a cell phone.  I am so old school that would not have occurred to me!  LOL!
Great video ya'll as always!! I really like those old Ford Broncos there tough like the body style and pretty easy to work on.  Ya'll did good job gettin her done.  Michelle you did fantastic job gettin a root canal . Thanks for sharing be safe have fun enjoy ya'lls time together
If it was yours carb or fix what was in it
I like carbs on them too. Understandably they can stall out on the steep climbs.  But there’s something nostalgic about a carb on an oldie
You should drill and into the concrete and put some anchor points so you can run chains to hold the truck or car whatever you have if it's four wheel drive test out the four wheel drive burnouts
Poor chicky. Layin bad eggs. Shoot the Roaster. 😆
Really. Mom brings food and no hug. Loosen up. Ben. Your an awesome addition to Fab Rats.
Paul. If you don't want mice in the shop. Let 2 cat's loose in shop. Just put litter box somewhere and have kids take care of it. Feed cat just enough so cat will kill mice not eat them. Mice have diseases. Great video.
I used to but not after I was forced  to see a root canal in progress which is not why I watch this channel, dang it!!!! Ruined my whole day, thank you!!!!
Is it still for sale?
Your New Knife will work   Til it Don’t.. just saying
Ya kit kats are most likely from Japan...
Well I know I’m gonna love ‘em, so I like em.
Paul doing good job
How many children in Ben and Paul’s family?
Hey on that carburetor it needs the plastic spacer to dissipate the heat! It’s a poor design on edlebrocks part! The heat from the motor boils the fuel and when you stop it’ll be hard to start it’s flooding itself through the venturas squirting fuel down into the intake! I promise it’s going to do it and when hot you try to recrank it you give it more fuel that it don’t need! Call edlebrock they sure will tell you!! I’ve put quite a few on!!
Paul scared me when he said Michelle's face was droopy I thought he meant she had a stroke for a second
Did you get any colourful guards for your gauges?  I think there was a little humour from your Nordic neighbour, getting you to taste test all the loverly flavours, whilst doing your daily labour! I haven't seen anyone send you any jewellery yet or theatre tickets come to that! I might have to get an aeroplane flight and bring some tyres over for you! I hope its not too windy because I really don't like a draught running through the house! I'm sure there are more words that deserve to be carved out of aluminium. In the late 80's, I had a 4.9, Ford Bronco, column gear change. I had a Company Petrol card and the company I worked for asked me to either stop using the card or the car!
Im swedish and love fazers choc...and finnish licoriqe...especially the sweet ones...
I have your hood and side skirts and an original radiator I don't have the fenders but they are the small fenders you're asking for. They're in Phoenix you can have them for free just tell me how to get them to you. I've messaged you several times on several videos G at upper class rats in Phoenix
Boss is gone and more sht.gets done right. Not wrong parts no big mistakes you have to redo 2-3 times ! I have a feeling Mr.Bens holding back cause it's F.R's (Pauls)gig! Hopefully this isn't as good as it gets.
I don't blame Michelle for hording the caramel chocolates!!  YUMMY!
AHHHH so that's how they do a root canal.  Should have known Fab Rats would have the answers 🤣
Marketplace nampa id.
Have you guys considered an ultrasonic cleaner for small parts?  I'm not sure the pros would outweigh the cons.
Bronco is back on the road awesome and Michelle is a tough woman! I was a big baby getting my root canal lol!
Ahhh for the days when men were men and motors were fueled by a mechanical device as God intended instead of these e-lek-tron-ickl dee-vices that no mortal can truly understand.  Glad the dental details went well Michelle. Been there, done that, hope to NOT repeat that. :D:D:D
Got me a FabRats tee shirt today, I love your content, I also got a golden nugget tee too. Thanks ,for all you do.
go to hot august nights in Reno Nv, usually find everything youwill need for yhr chevy
I'm just a hobbie welder and fixer upper, but your skills and ability have encouraged me to try new things.  Thanks!  Paul, you really are more than just another pretty face!!
I know 2 guys that just love those things... they both have more than a few of em... and are constantly workin on them..  Genuine Shit Boxes..
That knife, watch it, it will close on you. Lock wears quick. It gave me 5 stitches and a sweet scar
I was so distracted by the chocolate, that I forgot what I was watching.......lol.      Burnouts, thats it.
Ford is awesome rear end spins both tires not like a Chevy or dodge that just one tire spins.
Wow Paul I thought you learned your lesson from the last burn 🔥 out. Remember all the black rubber you had to clean out of your shop.
Wow Ben you need to take that Bronco out and blow the carbon out of  Exhaust out of the piping system. And like Vice Gripe garage says give it an Italian 🍕 tune up with some Berryman carb      choke cleaner. Hahahahaha 😂
Paul is starting to talk like Richard Rawlings. "Burnouts"
Morskey repair has a you tube  Channel think he’s in North Dakota has access to a lot of those parts if anybody can get what you’re looking for Tommy should be the one
It’s a 302, they can’t help but be fun.
Hey man, I want to buy that Bronco. Is it for sale?
So hard to find one of these vintage Broncos. Impossible to find one here, in Alberta, CANADA
😂 I love the sniper... but had i known mice and rats might be an issue I would have sleeved all the wiring with the aluminum sleeve they use for houses 🤷‍♂️ even garden hose works for a little while.
You check put classic industries for that hood an side panels on your 42 your working on?
Bubba knives are awesome 👌
Fan shroud would improve cooling!.
They’re not good for mechanic and they break real easy
The new Bronco has come a long way from the old ones.
I really like the custom shifter!   That was artwork!  This is going to be a Million Dollar truck!
Did you put the fluid in the bottle is on the floor
fuel line backwards reminds me of my shop teacher (AC/DC very high current generators and alternators) Finigans law - if you have a 50/50 chance - there is a 90% chance you have it wrong lolol
I need to come out a go to work for you guys. The  fringe benefits  alone are worth the effort.
Wow now I know where got your company logo form! Every time you start up an old car! Rat’s come flying out of every part it!
He!! Ya brother
Really? Little Caesars ...Piece a Pizza
Story time with Paul linny Buzz long ago far away Ford. Where is the cam bearing tool?
Came for the car mechanical stuff, didn't know I was gonna learn about chickens ! Wonder if mama hen was sick? Never heard of ALL the eggs being bad.
I had a 1970 with a boss 302 and a 66 with a pto and six, loved them Bronco's.
Hey man I’m sorry for your wife a getting a root canal I hope she feels better I know how they feel and I went to school was after I got one done and then my face was just not talking right my whole side I was slurring and everything so I know how it feels I hope she feels better and I always watch you guys and everything I hope I get that winning card if you guys are giving away but I can’t buy anything right now I don’t have a credit card or anything like that no money so I’ve been trying to get something so I can keep up the good job man
You are assholes! Remove all wiring that is not being used anymore! It is just common courtesy to your fellow technician! It may seem like a pain in the ass now, but when you get a vehicle in that the previous Tech did so, you will thank the GODS!
Root canal?!    Ya, that's leaving dead tissue in your body.  Better to completely remove.
Paul, watch you all the time.  Really like the Bronco day.  I have a 72 single cab with a 351 W.  Was thinking about putting a Sniper on it and was wondering what you did with the one you took off the Bronco ?  Could you let me know if it is avail...
Felt strips around the rear hatch will muffle most of those rattles
I enjoy all of your videos and especially this one. One of the most destructive problems with this iconic classic is rust. My 1974 Bronco Ranger lived its whole life in Southern Nevada and has no rust. I am the third owner and have owned it for 32 years.
What's up
Hi
They should pour a concrete pad outside, for the express purpose of doing burnouts so they can keep it out of the shop.
I've got a Bubba Fillet knife. absolutely love it. Its got good steel in it and takes a real nice edge
Try Iron Trap Garage in PA. For early auto parts .He has a very large collection.
I believe I will enjoy going William with you all someday also.
Hey Paul Cox I would love to meet you in your family someday will that be OK.
Hey Paul Cox my name is Hector I live in Myrtle beach South Carolina I see in videos you have a Jasper wrench in your pocket do you have.
Haha Michelle I tell my soctor I prefer going to the dentist more than going to the doctor haha im weird like that though haha I like the dentist more because atleast when you come out your better haha
Do you guys ship merch to Canada? Thought I would ask here while watching the Bronco get fixed.
To keep mice out of the engine compartment just put a few mothballs in various locations they will stay clear!
"What In The Heck Happened there".... "Dad, Thats what happened"  XD haha kids got his old mans sense of humor lmao
36:00 how quickly you forget what a mess that made last time!
I am amazed at the amount of sugar you all eat, how do you manage to have no holes in your teeth.  When I grew up there was no fluoride in the water, and I loved sweets.  We had the cord type drills that vibrated in your head.
**CONTENT IS MADE EVEN BETTER DUE TO THE HUMOR FROM ALL PARTICIPANTS!!!** **THANKS FAB RATS!!!**
Josh Dean. Confederate customs. Nashville Tennessee for that hood.
I thought it was a milwalkie knife at first.
ELK antlers saved!  YES!
Randel you need to get a good rooster :D :D
I had one someone a thing like a dog coup on the back took the six out put av8 in it moved motor mounts back cut the cal so I could put the motor back to the bell . After all of that I had to go to the junk yard to get clutch rod . Will I was there Ilearnd something six bell is shorter then the v8 I did all that work and all I had to do was change the bell.
Check out Adventures made from scrap he might have one he owns a junkyard with a lot of old stuff junkyard
" I know what's wrong with it, ain't got no gas in it"! Awesome job guys!
That carb is going to starve where you all live when getting vertical.  Owner would be better off going with an original or Q-jet that is tuned.
5 minutes of chewing chocolate, really??
What the heck is up with the Yellow forklifts forks in impaler mode? Love the videos guy's and gal
What does the owner think about Paul doing burn out on his ford
Can you tell me about how much $$ you bought your forlift for? model and type as well. i need/want one like it.  :)
I need to know more about those eggs, Randall. So, the eggs you set aside (with no blood veins), you said they were “no good”, but can you eat them? Anyway, now you got me checking my store-bought eggs with my phone flashlight to see who knows what.
Have you checked with Robbie to see if he knows where you can get body parts for the old Chevy?
Sure don't see the appeal to those burnouts. But what ever floats your boat and like your content. 👍
Love having the bro’s on the show!
@1:27 Holup
I don't think it counts as a burnout if you have to use the breaks... but that's my opinion not the popular one!
LOVED THE CHICKEN section.  Do more with chickens.
I’m sure it will run like junk.  Have you studied how to put an electric motor in one yet?  Nice teeth Michelle.
FABRATS: They do it so nice I watch it twice 😎 thanks for always sharing the personal stuff guys it really makes the channel 👏
crush that heap of crap,....BRONCOS SUCK
I guess you heard that one a Ben F.O.R.D. Fix Or Repair Daily. :) Love them though.
Oh that's Hilarious!  Randel :) :) Got to Love Paul and Ben,  Thanks for putting up with the boys Michelle.  Love you guys. and Greaters your coming along great too. just steer clear of the bad tasting stuff copy Dad Paul not uncle Randle :)
When I worked in the Outboard shop in the 80's we used lacquer thinner in a oil squirt can to clean carburetors. We called it Eye Juice because it always ended up there. Great video
Hey the video was great. I’d say that was a pretty good burnout. I enjoyed the video 👍👍👍❤️
This was a good video but please NO more active dentist shots. I almost lost my lunch.
Why watching one of your videos I noticed the ceiling in your machine shop is that made from irrigation Wheels
Next time we need a dentist warning lol gave me chills 😂
I have a 1986 toyota 1ton that my grandfather bought new. I wish I lived close to ya so I could have you make a few things mint on her. She runs good and outside looks amazing but she has a few noises under her bonnet and one part on the Frame that needs tending to. She would be a dang show truck!
How are you liking the way the shop turned out and the new US General tool box set up? Let me know I got a 73” roller box and looking to add on and would like the imput
How many of your nabours think your shop is on fire after a burn out haha
Wicked vidoe show more of your kids rc trucks i love them
Yeah I have asked about that in person and was sorely disappointed. Oh well. Glad to see it run. I enjoyed some of that wind in Kanab
Most awesome channel today I subscribe
Yea chocolate coma call it what you want I know better lol
The more time passes by the more attractive Michelle is becoming. Watching you folks is like a trip through the twilight zone. She gets younger the kids get older and work is never ending. Hang in there Paul. Surely you're getting a payoff somehow too? Ya lucky scoundrel.
Time for another hilarious video of Michelle reading user comments.
Once again, love the editing Michelle!
Bubba is proud of his knives.  They’re a bit too pricey for my budget.
I've been looking at that Bronco for YEARS!!!
Remember when using a knife.  Don't get bloody, cut toward your buddy!
Shop looks great
Hey Paul love the content, ive been watching for some time now and have noticed the cherokee in the background at the boneyard. I've been building one of my own and would like to see a series from you to see how you would do it thanks keep up the great work
Man that sucks you guys don't have a parts store somewhat near by!!! I hate leaving the shop to get stuff lol So I feel the trips Pual!!!!
Hey, those flavored Kit-Kats are where it is at. A buddy of mine brought back a Green Tea flavored one from Japan, and I feel robbed for only having limited choices on the shelves here in the US.
Nice job onthe truck. 7th grade band got stuck with the tuba! Teacher complained i was not practicing, i told him he can carry the thing the 2 mile walk home! Oh givin him new tires?
Ah finally ——I haven’t been able to find you. It’s  be pleasure to be back. Always great stuff.
They were kinda beatin up on ya there Michelle. Maybe you better take that pizza back. LOL Everybody out here in You Tube land are glad you were OK from the fender bender.
At least you had a go with a trumpet, my music teacher had one look at me and said "sit down" well it was me and Winfred, Winfred Chopper head.
I thought you were saying Michelle had a stroke at first.
I enjoy a good burnout but I worry about everyone's health breathing that in as it lingers in the shop.
Paul awesome things going on. nice to watch a good guy doing what he loves.
Paul is soon hilarious " (paul) I knew you were a drunk 🥴  " 😆 lovee the content guys and always look forward to your new videos!!
not how you spell gauges (gages)
Utah, 5 people found in a FORD Bronco in sugar-coma's.  New at 11
are those the new LED lights you had put in a lot brighter and nice
The newly updated shop looks amazing 🤩👍
Build an elk horn chandelier of sorts
What a great team!
Lots of laughs in that episode. More Raisin Rum for Ben and Randall.
I'm a Swiss chocolate guy. Tastes even better in Switzerland.
I hope you make an exception by NOT trying to do a burnout in the Golden Nugget. If you must try, please keep it to a minimum. Getting burnt rubber all over that spiffy $1000.00 per gallon paint wouldn't be good.
Why waste money on a boat anchor?
Gauges *
Root canals are actually not very sustainable. Do some research on holistic dentistry and better solutions.
I have that bubba knife its pretty good
Them was adorable pinky mice. Momma tried to move them with them still all latched on, hope there somewhere they can live without becoming a problem.
Just a FYI, the FJ is in the July issue of Four Wheeler
16:24 What do I owe ya?   How about a hug and a Kiss!
Poor Michelle we feel your pain .but the end result with your smile will be worth every minute!
Randall is the chicken whisperer? Didn't see that coming. Come to Michigan Randall. Itty will put you to work on our 9200 acre farm taking care of our 250 chickens. We've got 1400 Angus cows you can look after too big boy.
EFI is better in every way, but hey it's the customer's money...
Oh no Michelle, root canals are not fun and so expensive. So rad to see the Bronco sputter back to life. Seeing the mouse nest remnants fly out was pretty epic. Haven't had the opportunity to try Finnish chocolates.  I may be partial but Switzerland still has the best chocolate, hands down.
That’s a fine wife you have Paul.  That makes two I know of.
what did grandma bring you to eat?
Cool Bronco...but would be REAL cool with !!LS power
Those Broncos are getting pretty rare and sought after!!  Awesome!!
America 🇺🇸💪🏼🔧🔩🤙🏼
How's the Coronet coming along?
Maybe Paul gave her second hand MTN DEW mouth, spreading cavities 🦷 😂. Nice carb work always enjoyable
Paint that air cleaner cover to match  the body  hahahaha
Dam rats anyway lol
Paul, Cleetus liked my Comment on you driving at Bristol!! So I guess you need to contact him to set everything up. I can't wait to see you joining the fun! I can't go but I will be watching.
A few weeks ago you wanted to know if you should do the Lemons race. You might also want to look at ChampCar races. I know more folks running in ChampCar (Previously ChumpCar).  You should volunteer as a race steward before deciding to jump in.  You can donate your hours to an existing team.  You can go a day early and help inspect cars, which will be very informative for building your own.  Then work flag at the pit where you make sure the teams are being safe, and not cheating the 5 minute mandatory  off track time for fuel and driver change.  The most impressive moment when I was volunteering was the moment after the green flag.  A sixty seven car close tight pack thundering down the front straight into turn one, three wide looked absolutely terrifying.   The rest of the race I wouldn't have any trouble with hunting down the car in front, and finding a way to overtake them.
Dang some new shop lights sure would be cool...
Gages?? Wtf is "gages"?? It's "Guages" lol ;)
You guys are amazing ❤️ and funny😂😂
You didn't learn from the last burnout in the black truck? Don't send the rubber INTO the shop. Turn it around and send the rubber out the door. Ha
why does bleepinjeep orders his xls not from Fabrats and co.   Michelle !! that was a question i got saturday. lol
You all are great. Love the vids. Bronco is sweet.its beautiful there.
Robby layton has a couple of rat rod chassis I'm sure Rudy from Matt's recovery just bought one from him
4:52 "does it have off-roads in it?" He's talking about the carb. Is he referring to the mod you can do that allows the carb to continue supplying fuel even when you're driving at steep angles? iirc, I did a similar mod to the carb in my 86 Samurai, and it ran significantly better.
Burnouts Is environmental burden the shop is polluted and the particulate matter is cancer causing.
I’m thankful for your channel and videos. Recently had to quarantine from Covid and your videos helped me get through the days. We are sending the flavored Kit Kats to our kids and grandkids and they’re really fun. I don’t care for most of the flavors - ha! - especially almost anything macha. Blessings Fab Rats!
If I walk an extra 2 miles today, I can eat the Reece's cups that have been hanging out in my fridge. Stay strong Michelle and put in those miles.
WOOOOOWWWW TRIGGERWARNING viling down the inside of a tooth without a warning gave me the shivers, please don't do that again lol
Excellent job Ben and Paul
I found a 1942 chevy front end but I'm in ontario Canada. Bit of a far drive lol.
I really like your videos, but that fugly HEI Distributor ist an eye sore for any true Ford lover.
At 16:57ish  5 gallons of gasoline you just doubled the value of the vehicle  When the Bronco came into existence gasoline was 25¢/gal gas wars could get it down to 17.9¢/gal and if memory serves me one option was a PTO post hole digger  Thanx lovin’ your videos from Krapramento, California the Krapital/Krapitol
Its a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day under the Bronco hood, won't you be, won't you be, my  neighborhood mechanic. I was trying to think where I heard that voice and Paul sounds very much like Mr. Rogers. No sweaters, slippers but ratty hats and dirty jeans and a soothing voice. It pays to sound calm when you demolition derby.
The green tea kit kats are the best
Nice to see you messing with a Ford small block, I have an ‘89 Mercedes Coupe with a 302 in it, I drive it daily.
How many days has she been sitting on those "no good" eggs?  It takes at least a week before veins are visible by candling. Even if you think they are all no good, you should break one or two open to verify it.
My Marine son was moving from 29 palms to San Diego when he dropped his 1969 El Camino S.S. off at a shop to install a new fuel tank and lines. He got a call from the shop later telling it was going to cost an extra $800.because the mechanic did burnouts and twisted the drive line. My son paid the crook and I posted on his web site. Boyd Cottington would be rolling over in his grave over his old mechanics dishonesty over this treatment of military personnel.
BURNOUT!!!!!!!!!
I SLEPT THREW MY ROOT CANAL
I was with a friend, we were in my dad's twelve-foot aluminum boat with high winds and down pour, it was so bad two of us had to row the boat in
Hey Paul Cox my name is H stone from Myrtle Beach South Carolina I love you new shop I like what you done to it I know you do bye. If you will tell Michelle I'm glad you did her  hurt in the  car  Accident.
Hahaha love this stuff
You barstard Paul..😈 Michelle.. You make him pay👨‍🚒
Love the Bronco!  Got two myself.
Huron bay is not fun in the tail winds of a Tornado.
Being a diabetic y sucks.
Michelle, you're so purdy!
Great job getting the Bronco back to its owner. Nice to see you do some work on a Ford for once. You may want to know that there are ford fans that watch your channel and don’t believe the world revolves around Chevy and Toyota.
I am still waiting to see what you do to the Jeepster.
Michelle is such a good sport. She doesn't mind the banter, which is not a common find. Love the difference having her input into the videos. Hell, I love the family aspect of this channel in general. Nothing like where I called home, though my family tried to keep this up (because of their small country roots)
Hey guys if you put peppermint tea bags in cars not being used mice will stay away, very important change or add new bags monthly. And some bugs will stay away too.
did we really need to watch a root canal?
Rochester made all of Edelbrock's carburetors, the only thing, I've ever found wrong with a Rochester carburetor is they wear out.
little caesars pizza is not really pizza. Its cardboard with stuff on it.
really wanted to see what those burgers looked like....................
Paul, most O2 sensors are 18mm spark plug threads. Some are 14mm spark plug threads.
Your Brother Ben is a Great addition to Fab Rats!!
That was a fun taste n tools
LoL I can soo relate to your fears. My wife has been driving my truck while her Fiesta has been in the shop. I've been worried sick but can't say so.
For crying out loud use an FL1A .....a Holley is certainly easier to rebuild and rejet...don't care for the ugly distributor but they do the job
I had a trumpet in 7th grade too
I had a root canal. 16 hours total in the chair over 4 appointments. Navy dentist.
Bro I was eating while watching this video. First mama mouse got me then the dental visit... I need a warning. To avert my gaze... please
Nice burnout, just think of all that black stuff you just got cleaned up after the last burnout.
Liked the video , fenders  , get in touch with iron trap garage  , they just got alot of new old stock chevy fenders , hoods doors ect . ect . they might have what you are looking for .
Love the Brothers working together. So what are the plans for Michelle is she getting new wheels or taking over Pauls truck or are you going to build her a ride?
You need to use your YouTube money and buy yourself a heated ultrasonic cleaner.
Love the "tastes and tools" Randal cracks me up
One of Paul's sayings I have been using every chance I get is you can't hurt my feelings I held a flashlight for my dad because it's true
That was torture for Michelle to watch y’all eat that chocolate in front of her!
HEI in a Ford. Well anything you can do to help.
Hey, is the Bronco for sale ?😂😂😂
I was told by my great grandad, Always cut away from the sausage if you're a man and if you're a woman to cut away from the kitty.
Theres a 1946 in Winnemucca NV on Facebook marketplace. parts for 1k... Looks like front end with fenders,  and cab
doesn't count in break fluid
too bad they always  cut the quarter Panels on that Bronco
Chickens are soo much better than Hot rods , at least you can Eat them
16:01  Gotta love her.  You just know those burgers are going to be greasy and delicious.
The best Chocolate in the world comes from Blondel in Lausanne, suisse.
Love the way you have said NOT FOR SALE.  In a few of your videos.  But I guess you will always have folks that want what you got.  Thanks for the terrific videos.
Well done, what a team. Please keep at it. WE here love your work. Utah forever !!!!
9:41 no life jackets. Yep definitley 70's or 80's!
Dosent robbie have a bunch of old trucks n cars , saw in rudys video the other day
Burn outs! Dumb.....
@24:50 I'm wondering if you already ate the pizza or are you going to have to walk it up next
Talk to Cold War Motors about that front end clip.
glad you are able to get your mouth worked on........i need so much work on mine but money always gets in the way................. my 2 cents keep it to yourself, so i dont have to think about mine
Paul and Michelle  As the original builder of the little 42 Chevy, I love the idea of a blower Small Block and fenders.   I have the paint codes if you want to match the paint.    THX Doran
Love the new hair color Michelle
You need a sonic part’s cleaner , awesome for cleaning port’s in carburetors
I just want to say, I really like Ben.
I need a YouTube channel so people send me stuff…lol
Another Excellent Video Y'all ❤️
Paul, you may never take the time to view his YouTube video, but I am telling you, you have met you match.  It called, "I built my own yacht with materials from the scrap yard Full 90 days".  If I were you I would never challenge this guy for any reason. Your Brother Dave
"Smells like dirt" 🤣🤣🤣
Thanx for all the fun and serious  content  Love watching your channel  Have a Great Day 👍
I thought highly of this channel until I heard it's a Ford it will do a burnout! SMH
Holley EFI computers have always been such trash.  Bent a rod on my 71 Blazer because my Holley throttle body decided to die and the injectors went wide open, not even buzzing, just squirting fuel into the engine until it filled the cylinders.
😁😁😁😁😁some of the best chocolat in the world.... Finland😋😋😋🤙🤙🤙...from Asia , well keep a clear mind....😂😂😂burnout done....👌👌👌
great work guys, keep it up, that thing is going be fun to work on
For the front clip, try Silas at Adventures made from scratch on YT. He has lots of old bodies in his 4 salvage yards.
This is Alabama. Several years ago we were teaching 5th and 6th grade kids on Wednesday night. We were doing a Bible project, and we needed a pocket knife to open something up. This was Boyd’s and girls. I asked if anyone had  a knife…. none of the boys did, but three girls had a knife.  Don’t you love the South!
Paul just needs to pour a concrete slab near the shop just for burnouts. It'd keep the shop from getting covered in rubber dust, and the smoke wouldn't run people out of the shop.
What's this black soot-like stuff all over everything in the shop? It's weird, it shows up after every indoor burn-out. What could be causing this? Is it bad to breathe? How does it get everywhere? Why aren't the walls of the shop white anymore? Burned rubber is good for the lungs, right?
Don't put a carb on it keep it efi
Root canals , over seas chocolate and rat poop ...Are there better vids :) ...? Nope , I says not ....
Great having Ben along board, just adds to the mix. Root canal, no thanks.
Those forks being raised while the forklift is parked are waiting to destroy any unsuspecting passerby to. potentially, ruin their life. Won't be cute or funny when it happens. It may need more than one try, but, unless God intervenes, you'll be reporting a heartbreaking tragedy. "HEADS UP!"
1st…she drove herself to get a root canal?!  2nd - why go from FI to carb?
I really like your video you make, wish could meet and talk 👄 to you, wish I could wend the car you gave why
Michelle! You are a brave person. Hoping any pain goes away fast!
I liked having Professor Ben after he put on his Clark Kent glasses!
Lol
Friends DO NOT let friends drive FORDS
Ford LOL
Paul can you tell Michelle to never dye her hair again, haaha
15:06 lmao that took my back to when I first saw the PowerPoint effects that make animations like that lol. Thst was probably around 2005-2006, literally thought it was the coolest thing ever on the computer lol
Michelle, what a trooper! Nasty exhaust blast!! Shop almost back to organized, sort of!!
Green Tea kit kats are the bomb!
My thoughts no burn out just burn down.
Lmc has new fenders
I mean I think Paul and Ben could have done the canal for ya
All that candy and Mountain Dew... .glad to see you guys are keeping the local dentists in business  🙂
nice video
Good mom and dad advice on the rum. " if you don't like the smell don't drink it!'  and "You'll have to cut your leg off and put a patch over your eye!"  That was great. You guys are all a great family and one of my favorite channels.
It’s pile
The last time you did a burn out in the shop everything was covered with black rubber dust, and you do another burn out in the shop! You need to pour a concrete burn out pad outside.
Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to Heaven! Believe Jesus is the Son of God. Read the Bible. Doomsday is on the horizon.
Irontrap garage on YouTube for antique parts.
I really enjoyed the chicken segment.  Thanks!
My wife knows all about those root canals.
I have to ask how the ceiling of the Taste n' Tools room is constructed?
Gloves.  That solvent is being absorbed through your skin just like a transdermal medication patch.  God knows what that stuff will do to you long term.
sorry, I like your channel and most of the content, but could have done without the dental stuff..
Great watching you guys! What’s the plan for the 64-66 C10 Chevy? Always see it in the background.
I could almost smell the burning rubber!  Good job!
Do you own an ultrasonic cleaner? I find it helpful for cleaning items with small openings... like carbs. Thank you for the "Taste n Tools" taste testing segment. It was hilarious!
Awesome to see the hen push the eggs under her, thanks Randall
dentist did a good job with the videography lmao
Hey Guys.. With all them mice or rats running around, you need to get you some Cats.. We had mice problems on our land and got some kittens from people giving them away free. That took care of them. Just let them hunt during the day and feed them a little at night. It's that easy.. Good luck
Fenders for the hot rod truck,look for iron trap garage on youtube
We have very different opinions of burn out. That's power braking.
The taste test had me rolling
Y’all should make a little plywood backer to catch all that burning rubber!
More black stuff to clean up Paul , job well done cheers mate and Michelle I am that was you and not me, enjoy the chocolate when you can !
Everynow and then kitkat releases the strawberry ones here in the states, I love them. They are like nesquick.
Suomi mainittu, suklaahyllyllä tavataan.
The Bronco what about the welding machines
Who does the Bronco belong to?
I got the cordless Bubba filet knife and it's Awsome!
Michelle you crazy showing that it gave me ptsd watching you sitting there one time I started suffocating cause of that thing that isolates the tooth it was made outta water balloon material so when I would breath it would suck down I panicked but hope you feel better an don't have to go back
Papa Dar hi 👋
More wheelin less working lol as if eh hahah
I know what's wrong with it!  It ain't got no gas in it!! 😂
"Got'a crown vic motor..."....I have a story. Back in the late 70's. I owned a 69 Pontiac custom S, 350, 2 barrel with a 450 turbo hydromantic, I did some work on for hp. I always wanted to be faster than anyone...lots of story's behind that. Anyway.....One night working late stocking groceries and doing the usual stuff of drinking late at the store, I bought a pizza and headed home...might of been around my 2am.//special shop stayed open late.(I was 17 or 18 at the time). There was a trooper who had a boat Vic....you know one of the long Vic's. Was estimated to run around top end at 150 to 170. No one really knew. I had met him on a one other occasion for speeding. Had a S curve I loved speeding through next to my uncles house, then a long 1.5 mile straight away before my turn off....PS setting the scene. I met his black car with red letters just as I exited the S curve. Saw the red letters and was an OSM, gunned it. Saw him do his pull over and fish around. By this time I had reached 130 according to my un-adapted register. But I saw his headlights uplift when straightened  out. Long story, I out foxed him.   Main thing I was worried about was him taking my pizza!
My 73 Bronco is my pride and joy! Glad to see this old girl getting some love, at long last Paul!
MOTOCRAFT PH8...OIL FLITTER
Hi paul i went to cleetus's channel whom i also watch and commented that you should go to bristol in september and i won an iphone 13 so thankyou for that sir
What's the deal with the off road floats you were talking about?
White top! Ha.  Fun, pretty capable little rigs in their day.  The old man had several, it's the rig I learned to offroad in.  But in stick to my land cruiser.  Looks like the nugget is near, paint seems to be finishing up so the fun shit can begin.  Can't wait to see Ed's face, I think he will need convincing it is really his same rig.
The cheap summit carbs are really easy to set up
Dirty minds.... "Don't put that in my mouth".
Finnish treats!  You guys are so lucky.  I'll have to bring the family by for Taste 'n Tools.  :D  Take care y'all!
Good to see Ben following the Fab Rat tradition of doing things twice. Great video
Ver brave of you Michelle to take a camera into the dentists, nice teeth though, they don't use all that scaffolding and green sheet here in the UK.
No more root canals please. Makes parts of my body hurt.
Repent to Jesus Christ  “Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.” ‭‭James‬ ‭4:7‬ ‭NIV‬‬ h
This Bronco is great!
these longer videos are amazing.
The 4x4 shifter in the Bronco is the same one that they use as the shifter in a Pinto..  :)
That tool box your Mom and Dad gave you. Looks like my first box I bought back in 79.
Nooo not in the shop again
👍👊
There is more pain in getting the needle than having the root drilled, and the pain stops when they finish not the next 3 to 6 hours, all the best to yous and your loved ones
Need more chicken updates.
Randall AKA The Chicken Whisperer
On the old Chevy project try classic truck rescue for front clip
The only way that Ford is going to run is with a small block Chevy! 🙂
In reality you are absolutely different from that image of yourselves that you have created in your external consciousness. And your might is unlimited. The potential to be God is laid within you, within each of you. As a matter of fact, you are gods. And your task is to master your divinity little by little, to let the divinity enter your external consciousness.
Go Michelle go!!! Lol, sorry you on your way to the dentist
WOW. Michelle made that root canal almost look like fun.
If I knew how to add a picture I would, but I'm pretty sure that you have the wrong grill for that '42. I have a '42 rebadged as a '46 (wartime), ten feet from me with a totally different grill. Love what you do, thanks!
Oh bugger talking about teeth, just lost two fillings last night 😠,   oh bugger  $500 each filling,   so much for my new engine for my train layout 😬.
"I knew you were a Drunk "🥴 🤣
You need to hook the electric fuel pump to an oil pressure switch for safety reasons when the engine dies it will shut off
I like the longer videos. Well done.
Some of the very greatest chocolate in the world is Althea's near Buffalo NY. Order a box of truffles. You will love it Michelle.👍👍👍
Cut towards your chum, not your thumb
Nice job 👍I have a few things for a 42 but it's mostly for the 1 1/2 -2 ton wish I could help you more, but for front clip I don't have a reg 1/2 ton.  There is a guy named Lee Reynolds in Hugoton Kansas L&B enterprise.  I got some stuff from years back not sure if he still has stuff or in operation, but he use to have quite a bit of early chevy trucks.
This was a good one!
Oh I hit the Like button before I watch.  What's NOT to like with these great folks ❤️ Michelle is a trooper,  root canel, wash/clean out the truck, stop by the auto parts store and bring home pizza.  Michele I was teased about my accidents as well.  I've had 3 bad! ones. None were my fault and 2 of the 3 were men driving, lol I just couldn't zig fast enough when they zagged. I'm still dealing with the effects 30 years later. Praying you are doing well.  Glad you guys got a cool vehicle up and running.  Please be careful cleaning up after mice. They can carry Hantavirus, which can kill you. Please wear a mask so you don't breathe it in while cleaning.  It was great seeing Randall help with the chickens, maybe you guys need to build a better rooster lol.   Maybe you can contact Silas with Adventures Made From Scratch. He's a You Tuber in Hutchinson Kansas. He and his dad own a auto salvage. He has some old vehicles, and some cool stuff.  Maybe he can help. Always enjoy your videos,  great folks to "visit".  Stay safe and GOD bless
Well, Randall's egg tutorial was an unexpected surprise, and thanks.
Wow that dude will do a Good burnout I think I mite know where to get them parts for your truck I'll let you know this week if he has them are not I saved this video to show my friend that has the old truck yard here in Indiana he just mite have what your looking for
Well it was really funnny watching Ben always using the ladder! Also neat wagon wheels in the ceiling during candy time. Keep it up guys! Love your videos! 👍👍😎
I like Kevin from KSR’s term, the good ol “Safety Burnout”. I think that applies nicely with Fab Rats
👍👍👍👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I need another sniper kit. Love them
Congrats on the trending video 👏🏻
The wife lady has agreed to pitch in 50/50 on our shop. Guess I may have a place to build our DJ-5 krawler sooner than I thought. Thank you for your time.
not bad, not bad, lets say 5/10 burnout score
Don’t like em but you might need more cats 😂😂😂👍
3 speed... Lol what
I liked old bronco's right well
More rubber to clean out of the shop.....
Watching you 2 busting knuckles IThinkthat Paul is doing more talking than twisting. nuts.
Cut towards your chum, not towards your thumb!
Speaking of wind, I was at lake Powell last week and actually passed your house on the way . Made sure to point it out to my boys since they all love your channel. It was horrible and we got chased off the lake after the first day. That lake is no joke in that wind and gets super dangerous. Especially in the channels with the boat wakes bouncing around too.
FORD - Fire Or Rust Destroyed
Loving the longer format videos!
Chocolate is Healthy...!!  Full of Anti-Oxidants..!!   Give Up Something Else...Chocolate is da Bomb...!!
Paul I always look forward to your videos every week seeing the different segments like storytime and including stuff like Randall helping the kids with the eggs is always fun to watch. On this channel we see a little bit of everything and I love that
LMAO- busted!  Need to fix Grandma's car 😂
Ok could've done without the root canal uhhuhuh! Hope everything worked out for you Michelle!
12:56 'Gages'...ha...!  *Gauges*  Grandma is Awesome.  True Patriot!  Bringin Food and Smiles.  '...Not Homemade, But Home Cooked...'    ha...!
I drove past the shop, and it looked kinda quiet. I didn't see a house down there so I didn't know if I stop or not.
I really enjoyed this vid looking forward too much more fun stuff..  I just finished up my kit Version redcat wendigo  Bronco!! RC  💯.   My wife just got her teeth worked on lol too
Ben has been a great addition to the channel.  Great job everybody!!
I had a ‘74 half top bronco like that.  3 speed on the column, built 289 HP.   Kick myself all the time for getting rid of it.   It would walk sideways and smoke 33’s.
Root canal ouch!!! So sorry for you Michelle.
Those old Broncos are an absolute nightmare to get in and out of 4wd. I don't miss that old technology at all.
I think one of Eddie Van Halen's teachers told him he had "zero musical talent"... Just goes to show you .... you never know... unless you try.  ;)
Another great video team, Michelle is looking thin/fit 👍🏼👌🏽
Aww Michelle get well soon. Root Canals are almost worse than Wisdom Teeth and I wouldn't wish either one on anybody.
I was going to say that a Fab Rats was the one who broke it.
Sorry Paul! I have to disagree with you about having candies just like the Marianne candy from Finland. That chocolate peppermint candy is the ABSOLUTE BEST!! Nothing compares! My husband and I enjoy watching your channel! You all are great!😊
Nice job on the Bronco.  Nice burn-out too!!! 😁 I got a F-150 that needs a new  5.4 3V engine... hint! LOL!!
Randel needs his own YouTube channel about chicken farming
are you ever going to put the Yoda bobble head on display in the shop?
OH my that old Green Chevy on the trailer wounder what your going to make of it?
Randall, when you say them eggs aren't good, does that mean even with bacon and cheesy hash browns? PS, now you 2 bears in the shop to poke at!
Nice work on the Bronco but we need to see those elk sheds !
There’s a U in gauges
I love driving my 69 just started driving it again last week!! Keep up the good work!
So cool
You channel is the best on you tube. Keep up the good work. Love the family interaction. It makes it s enjoyable to watch. Also enjoy seeing the projects and your builds.
Don't get me wrong I love fab rats I watch it everyday I learned a few tricks an I will continue watching but it bothered me to see fuel lines with hose clamps that could come loose down the road hopefully exhaust pipe doesn't get to hot..
Found On the Road Dead. Fix or repair daily.
Have you guys looked at the comments on Cletus's channel - there was a whole lot of people that nominated Paul, Matt and Robbie for racing at Bristol !!!
Was the fuel line a little close to the exhaust pipe or was I seeing things. Not a good idea the exhaust  pipe is going to get  Hot hopefully no leaks.. wait a minute they just had a fuel leak this is a fire waiting yo happen...wake up guys someone is going to get hurt....
Finland make the best Almond fingers👌
Stay clear of the serrated part of the blade it ain't one bit fussy on what it knocks and cuts. Other than that anything will do for mechanic work
Michelle is looking good!
Michelle will always be in these videos. She will never miss an opportunity to ruin them with her annoying youtube mom voice. She's the worse.
Can anyone share the link to the Cletus video to fill it will FabRats name?
Another great slice of life from Paul and Michelle. Are you sure the Bronco is not for sale?😃
Love all the stories. I enjoy all of your adventures.
Paul, you"re lucky to have Michelle. I should know, my wife is just as amazing!!!
My pops had a '73 Bronco, this brings back some good ole memories. Thank you for sharing.
I hate dentists
Yep those rats are nasty on drivelines..... the Fab Rats😂
Oh I know those root canal’s are no fun… I know the feeling… thanks for your videos guys…
“gages”? Common man. LOL
Finnish black licorice is the world's best.
Did you put a brake lock on it?
This gives new meaning to the old saying "when the cat (paul) is away the rats will play"
Another great video. When are you going to build a rig for Randall?
I remember my father used to leave the carb submerged in lacquer thinner overnight. Carb cleaners just don't exist back then.
I’m surprised Paul brought a ford in his shop. Love the show guys good job
for old truck parts check with adventures made from scratch. he has huge collection of old trucks
Michelle darlin I feel your pain. I just had two root canals at one time !!!!!
Does Randal ever get a sore arm for holding the camera in that position? I have rebuilt several Holley and Stromberg carbies over the years...
Ben reminds me of Dale from Tucker and Dale VS Evil. I love it.  He's fits.
Look into the BG brake flush machine  I use it for ever brake job I do. After you use the newest one I have been using you will never pump a brake pedal but 2 too 4 times on a complete empty system. It is so nice. Also if you want to use the function that it has none will get on the floor
Michelle and Randall and kids That few minutes with the hen and eggs was some of FR best educational informational video ever This is what sets you guys apart from the other channels  Love it👍❤️!!  Now some other informational  As a 64 year old diabetic and quadruple bypass survivor do Paul a favor and next time you are at Wallyworld pickup a blood sugar test kit from their pharmacy. Its Reli-on name  I watch what you guys eat and that comment about his fingers and chocolate coma would be funny if it wasn’t true. Don’t end up like me. Kids need their parents. Get yourselves a sugar test. Its cheap and easy and may save your lives  Love you guys❤️❤️🇺🇸🙌🏻
Michelle,   the first root canal I had done took three and a half hours sitting in the chair.   Techniques and methods have gotten a lot better !!  :-)
Hey, I had a root canal last week, so I feel Michelle's pain.
I know where their is a 1973 one owner. With only 33000 miles
Great job Paul and crew. But the real hero is Michelle, root canals are no fun.
The wife gets the win today with a root cannel, truck washed, and parts run with a candy tasting. Bronco running good.
I’m a viewer/subscriber.  Don’t refer to folks watching your content as, “fans”.  When you achieve Motley Crue status you can refer to viewers as “fans”
Paul is a “fixer”. That’s an understatement.  Apart from welding a pop can under water, he can probably mend anything from a broken heart to the crack of dawn.   Furthermore, well wishes Michelle.
I enjoyed watching Randall get pecked hahaha great video
What? A woman who gets a root canal, cleans up your truck and gets pizza and parts all in the same day???.  Wow shes a keeper!.
Is there a more diverse, entertaining channel on YouTube? Mechanical tutorials, exotic food tastings, truck vandalism and the unflappable Michelle!!! Got my vote!
Paul, u might want to check out a youtube creator for the hood/fenders for ur 41 chevy. Check out adventures made from scratch, his name is Silas i think. But i believe he maybe a state or 2 away from you. I dont normally promote other youtubers. But i really think he might have what ur looking for.  Btw. Really like the bronco. And hope Michelle is better from her root canal. Yall be safe and God bless
What year is that?
That was a lot of fun to watch!
Paul l want to see you do a build of a Mitsubishi montero limited 3.5 2002
Just back from the Dentist, lets eat some chocolate . LOL.  Bronco needs some windshield wipers.
Gotta get tired of working on rusty junk.
Randall's "Chicken Bits" was cool! I knew none of that. Very entertaining to watch/learn.
Hey FabRats crew, question on Cleetus and wanting to be in their video. I can’t find what video that is, can you help me with what video that is?
If you want to hatch some eggs,take a sharpie and put a small marking on some fresh ones so you know which ones they are and how old they are👍
Video would of been better without the dentist stuff.
Just vacuumed out a ton of mice turds and a body today out of my 78 f150
The PCV valve belongs in the valve cover. The vent is the hose from the fill pipe to the air filter
Hope your feeling better Michelle ❤️❤️😘
I would do the burnout outside
Anyone who can drive, film AND smile, while her face is numb, deserves an applause. Good job, Fab queen.
Did she get her own YT channel
My inner monologue happens in randall's voice. P.S. I love mountain dew. I hope to steal one from Paul, someday. We LOvE Fabrats.
Hope you don't get a headache putting that pipe rack above that door remember you're putting your laundry out to air so to speak OSHA or building inspectors may not approve just a little 😜🤫
Why would you fill your shop with smoke and burned tire bits after all the work you did to clean, paint and reorganize the shop. Burn outs do not impress me. More like you show a lack of respect for the car owner and his ride. I don't bother watching people trying to destroy something that is useful.
You know Paul kids bring home stray dogs and cats. You bring home stray car, trucks and SUV's!
Michelle has amazing teeth!
learned somtin new today, I did not know the Bronk had a built in Tool Tray LOL..
Oh the old root canal awesome i had a wisdom tooth pulled out of my 60 year old mouth so numbed up and pulled out with some vice grips it was impacted in there the best part is the pain meds for 3 days and a fab rats video or two. Thanks for your video's.
Might want to add an outside burnout pad. Beats that indoor rubber smell.
I think Paul should invite the fan that sent in that Milwaukee magnetic light, the one with the extending arm. to come see the shop.  Is that the most useful fan gift so far???
To make burnouts a little more exciting. Bob Chandler owner of Bigfoot told us how to do a flaming burnout. So we tried with our derby cars. Pretty cool doing them at night but go easy on the gas.
Randel you're awesome
Paul we use Carbon free for cleaning carbs. It's better then carb cleaner in a pail.
I know you are a 4 wheel guy but if I could make one request it would be with all the project cars your building can build one slammed and bagged low rider?
Didn't Paul use crown vics exclusively for Derby? Just saying I'm assuming because you couldn't kill em
haha OMG , never seen a rat nest blow out an exhaust  lol that was awesome
You might now get more work done with your brother  You should watch Halfass channel what he can do by himself
When do you leave forBristol?!! Ps the videos with your brother are priceless.  I hope you work together forever.
Michelle, this comment is all about you...because you are a super-awesome part of the Fab Rats family Team. You're smart, you're fun, cantankerous, you make interesting facial expressions, you ask interesting questions and make interesting comments, you have a smile to die for and your personality is just cool. Keep rockin' it IN the videos and behind the scenes as you edit them, make parts and supplies runs, get or cook food to keep the crew going and coordintate things in general! We all hope you felt better quickly after your root canal procedure too dear. ;)
if this is going to be a normal thing you need a better exhaust fan.
So I’m gonna say this regardless if it’s not popular. Maybe it is and other guys won’t say it. Here goes.  I love watching fabrication,  I love watching four wheel drive and pulling people out. I started watching Matt and still do.  I don’t like watching some woman in a dentists chair. I think I like Matt’s channel better as Jamie doesn’t dominate the video. All these female comments start getting under my skin. Can’t a guy channel just be a guy channel? It seems the lonely men who can’t find a date are the ones who like listening to Michelle. For me it’s like drops constantly on my head.  Maybe I’m in the minority but maybe I’m not.  Figured I’d at least give feedback as I would want to know if it was my business making profit.
Check back of block above bellhousing for PCV. And with 4-wheel disc might need a booster.
A real Bronco
Please don’t put an LS in it. lol. Another great video Paul and all! Always entertaining. Keep em coming and be careful! Thank you for sharing.      Jim
thats back when there was water in the lake lol
The Bronco needs wiper blades. Just saying.
Don't want to rain on your parade but that can't be the correct place for that distributor... Ya can't just stab them anywhere... With 11 teeth (usually) on the gear there is only one place where things will sync up... Otherwise the spark has to jump to far in the cap, carbon trace, misfire, you get the picture... It's like setting push rod length on a high lift cam, calculate the correct length and just barring the motor over requires half the force....
Awesome video, my ADD is kicking in though, it’s “gauges” not gages.
Kit Kat Mango, is Pronounced Man Go not Man Jew.
My father and his fishing buddies were out on an island in Powell when that wind came up. Seven of them. My dad and one of his pals made it home. I lost the best male friend I had that day. That was 1972. Glad you guys had better luck. <3
Michelle there is no good going to come from a diet with no chocolate.  Nice old Bronco.
Why bother dam buckbord rides like crap and it's a ford
The Michele part could have been left on the cutting room floor!
👍👍 Bout time we had some Ford action! 😁😂
It would look cool with cycle fenders on the front.
Nice Bronco. Really didn’t need to see the dentist
You guys need to build a burnout pad outside the shop so you don’t fill the shop with black dust.
Ya know, your dad would be so happy to see you guys working together!!! Dad built you guys right!
Absolutely love the Paul test on the cars though I'm sure next video we'll here complaining about rubber being on everything again lol thanks Michelle for all your hard work even with the numb face from the root canal can't wait to see what the next vehicle for her is going to be. When is the next keeps commercial because I think we're due one with all the guys including papa dar those are the best endings to the videos or beginnings depending on where they need to go!
**>>>COME VISIT MATT<<<!!!** +++ **PAUL >>>TASTES LIKE CHOCOLATE - AS FAR AS CHOCOLATE GOES<<< I THOUGHT IT WOULD TASTE MORE LIKE BROCCOLI!!!** LOLOLOL!!!
I wish I knew folks like you in my neck of the woods. I need a jeep straight six rebuilt.
I don't do root canals.  If the tooth is that bad, they can pull it.  The hell with 'em.  I'm old.  I won't miss a tooth for long.
It seems like you don't like  Fan shrouds I don't think I have seen any on anything you work on.  I guess you and Matt don't like a cool radiator
She now has a dead tooth in her mouth.Big mistake.
Black licorice is awesome! I'll even volunteer to "dispose" of it for you 😂
I feel your pain Michelle. I have a root canal on Tuesday.
Well I have got to say we'll done Ben and Randle for keeping up with the work while waiting for Paul to come back 😂😂 and then go back out again 😂😂 I love the way you all work so well together ❤️ ❤️💯👌
Darn Phillips head screws, that's why we use Robinson in Canada
That's cool I have a 72 international scout ii there fun trucks an up there in price right now that's a plus for me lol I have a stack of phone numbers of people trying to buy it an doesn't have a for sale sign on it.
CA-RA-MEL... apart from that.. great vid as per usual guys
Try the "adventures made from scratch" dude or Mr Good pliers I bet one of them has the parts you need for the old Chevy!
Michelle, please never show us the details of a dental visit ever again else I'll make a cantankerous comment.  You are triggering my PTSD caused by the dentist.
Its prity smart of ford .to supply a builtin tool tray on the firewall. For everytime your ford breaks down.
Now you have rubber on both sides of the shop lol 🤣😆🤣 you will be finding that for years 👍 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Isn't it funny how we hold onto things for years. I have a tool box that I've had for over 47 years now. I also have ratchets that I've owned for more years than that. My parents gave me a torque wrench, and it was a cheap one as well. Just the dial indicator and it goes by how much the wrench bends to give you the reading. I don't use it but, it's because they gave it to me as a Christmas present and it's only what they could afford at the time, having 6 children. I wouldn't give it away!!!
After catching up with all of your previous videos I will say you are by far my favorite channel. I started watching awhile back but the more I saw the more I had to see the earlier ones. Michelle you do an excellent job editing everything. I really enjoy the longer video’s. I’m proud to be a fallower of your channel. Don’t worry Matt I enjoy your channel also. Wish nothing but the very best for you both.
Awesome vid guys! Always wear gloves using any solvent, can loose feeling in your hands 🤘🇨🇦
The worst breather in the world choke it out
Where's the fridge with the Dew at paul
What engine powers the wood splitter?
I recently got myself an ultrasonic cleaner. Heated to 80 degrees drop a carb in for 15 minutes and it comes out shiny clean
Band class: I blew my trumpet in the ear of the player next to me while the teacher was busy with the drummer.  Of course, the other trumpet player returned the favour… at which point the teacher looked up… and sent him to the principle’s office.  I felt the need to confess, so I got to join him.  The principal put us to work cleaning out a storage room… at which point my mother stopped by with my forgotten lunch.  She was so proud of me that I had been chosen to help out the principal.  So I had to confess again…. I still play, but I point it in a safe direction.
Lol Michelle's yay was adorable and funny 😄
👍❤️
At 15:26 … “herding kids” or “herding cats?”  Same skill set required, but entirely different visuals.
Yea, I would use a copper metal oil line instead of plastic.   I had an oil line break open somehow and it  squirted hot engine oil all over my foot.  Good thing I was wearing an old pair of sneakers that day...
I always do cause I know it’s going rock👍👍👍
That dental dam looked like a horror Halloween costume!
Better fix your moms car! lol she is awesome 👍
Hi there, while you guys were doing your tastings, I couldn't help noticing the support work in your up-stairs flooring. Whats the story on that? looks like wagon wheels or other steel work or something
“I have younger taste buds than you.” “It smells like dirt.” Great quotes. Thanks for the laugh.
I too will be getting a root canal this week. 😩
Should of known you wouldn’t of learned from last time 🤦🏼‍♂️ fresh clean shop and doing burn outs inside again 😂 well enjoy black rubber everywhere again 😜 great vid glad to see this up and going 💪 have dropped your name on Cleetus page hopefully you can get involved 🤞
Great video with variety! Love it!
EDEL-JUNK...🤦‍♂️....ford is meant to run with holley!!!
Love seeing dental work on an automotive channel. Jesus...
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
please never ever includ dental or medical stuff like that just really not what i want to see in your vids but other than that loveing the videos
Have any of u ever heard of fanny farmer candy all different chocolate ,not cheap even then but amazingly good. When I was a kid. If u ever find it you'll know what I mean by good chocolate.
Ask merlin or welder up for that front clip fenders
The saying goes “Cut towards your buddy, not your body”
Quite like the Bronco, nice job guys.
Sure cure for knife cuts…. carburetor cleaner. One squirt on a cut finger and you remember all the knife safety you learned in Boy Scouts. That start up would have been even more epic if a mouse rolled out of that exhaust. If someone sends durian don’t eat it!
Good luck Michelle I've had 2 root canals you got this, Paul, Ben & Randal in the shop is a good time, tools & food with Michelle was fun, careful with a burnout it is a Ford lol great video God Bless ❤😉👍
i know you arent much of an electrical guy but if you ever get ahold of an old electric wheel chair you can convert it to rc and use it as a trailer tug
I love everything about your show except the burnouts. Your a full grown man with a family what could possibly be running through your mind thinking that a burn out is even cool? All that does it tear things up and make your workspace a disaster. Quit being a bad example for your kids and grow up.
More burnt rubber in the shop?
I have a local honey hole of old cars ill check if they have the front clip
Will one of the kids get the old toolbox? Don't let it go, pass it on!
You go to the Michigan go to Frankenmuth you want us to good chocolate or some good all Fried Chicken go to Frankenmuth Michigan
Jeepster
The bronco will run if you put a chevy motor in it!!!
This video is a good example of why this is the best channel! Family matters and makes it feel like we all know you. Keep it Up. Gray where's your channel, get it going bud!
I played the trombone too because I liked how it could do the slide gliss.
Take editing privileges away. No reason to be adding dental/root canal clips to a mechanic channel.
Do you do burnouts with all your clients cars? So disrespectful of you! Punk ass move!👎👎
Including the dental work in the the video is....weird. I'd vote No on including too much personal content in the Fab Rats videos.
Howdy!
Do u use that wood splitter or split by hand.
My daughter: "Why did that poor hen lay so many bad eggs?" Me: "She might be old and going through menopause " My daughter: "Henopause!"
If you're supposed to cut towards your buddy, how do you cut the cheese?!
I'd be willing to trade my 95 Dodge 2500 diesel for the Bronco.
lovely candy, it's pronounced liquori-"issss", not "liquori-ish" The English also get it wrong! 🙂
Won't that fuel-injection work on one of your rigs Paul?, it looks fairly new, I could never let somebody work on my vehicle that says he hates the brand of vehicle I drive, but that's just me, after eating all that sugar, Graden is going to be bouncing off the walls, lol, and I think Michelle deserves a little chocolate-hoard if she wants it, but she should take a refresher driving-class asap, lol, all you guys are awesome, thanks for sharing.
What a beautiful little rig so cool
You can get any car to do a burnout if you put the drive tires where the brake fluid is on the shop floor, or spray them with WD-40.
for old car parts, try Mr. Goodpliers yt site. He is in Kansas
Yup,been wanting to know about that bronco,and those elk sheds/rack!!
Great video. Love the duel screens.
Had two root canals.  One went really well.  One not so much . . . in lieu of a third root canal I elected to have the tooth extracted and an implant replacement done.  Much better.
Oh dear god where was the warning for the tooth part!! No way jose'!!!
The chicken 🐔 segment, y’all may be on to something there.
enjoy your vedios .im in Flint mi
What u gonna put in the burnout competition if u get to go to Bristol ??
OMG! please stop the dentistry stuff! My dentist as a child was a butcher!
Cheater putting that HEI in the Bronco
I love this channel, you guys sing the song of my people! Rock on, rock on.
You guys received black licorice from Finland! So lucky. I love that.
Once this is done you will have to attend NW bronco round up. Great event.
Just be glad the kit Kats weren't durian flavor
Hubba-Bubba K-nife don't you K-now...
Love those early Broncos, spent alot of time in one with my uncle hunting and fishing. Trip to the dentist and even some video shots that made my toes curl! great team effort to get a burnout shot!!
Nice job paul👍 Old betsy did well  😜 and gived  a great burn out
Your Bubu Knife is red. Thats all I know.🤔🤭
Randal is the best cameraman / commentator ever….
Easy
The whole fab rats team gona be at the dentist getting new teeth with all that candy and mtn dew  🦷
1977 pontiac firebird trans am ( smokey and the bandit) is my dream car but with the wife having cancer no way I can afford one...
Make the blue tool box RC specific. God knows ya got lots of toys.
Lookin good
This is like the learning channel.I already know about carbs,but Randel taught me about eggs, now I know it all!
Michelle should go to the old salvage yard in St. George and see if they have an International to go with the Bronco you're working on. I mean she's already there.
I make my own knives.. Lol
Lmao Paul " you'll have to cut one leg off and put a patch over your eye" that had me rolling, something I would tell my kids!
I love fabrats!!! I hate fords  I'd rather push a chevy becuse fords need to be thrown in the garbage
If you see an Aldi grocery store in your travels, stop and get some of the chocolate candy bars from Germany. They are the ultimate. Also if you like sour kraut get the one on a glass jar from Germany, the very best. Aldi is not all over the US yet but growing. It is a very well ran store from Germany.
Really appreciate you interacting with all the family even if you're going to get your teeth done or whatever is really nice to have a good connection with what's going on and enjoy the work you're doing at the time. All the best from Surrey BC Canada 🇨🇦
When you all going to build the Willys wagon?sure would like to see that..
I bet MrGoodpliers another YouTuber has the parts you need.
Randal can you still eat the eggs that were no good?
hey 🤙from hawaii it was more interesting watching Michelle then the carb cleaning 😆🤣
*Guage*
Check out classic truck rescue on YouTube he might have what your looking for
ok... randall ,,, he is ok...chicken farmer,
So is that the same as like a four banger? Like when the timing is a tooth off and the accel pedal seems lackey? Hit the gas and it does a slow rev? When he was stabbing the gas, it seemed like it was on a struggle bus. Just curious.
You guys are hilarious - seriously - you can't make these things up, very inspiring.
Paul, you are always talking about burn-outs.  Remember that T Bucket that I showed you last year?  That machine would not do a burn-out if its life depended on it.  LOL   I has a low stall converter, 33 inch tires in the rear, weighs 3,700 pounds, and 3:21 gears.  But, on the plus side, it does everything that I wanted it to do.  I went up to Toquerville Falls when I was down there, and it did that road without issues.   I have always liked those square Broncos.  Blowing out the mouse nest was awesome.  Probably not for the mouse though.  LOL
For a minute I thought that was my old Bronco. 😎
Dang Paul..  as much as you expressed 🤮 having black rubber soot all over everything in the shop..  👀 😲😁
As a pocket knife junky I can say the Bubba pocket knives are basic run of the mill stuff. Mystery high carbon steel. $65 price.  Nothing special.
those finnish chocolates are awesum... i should now ... i live in finland...
A couple of episodes ago I mentioned that the audio mix on your "Stories With"  inserts would need to be adjusted if I was ever going to hear them. Today's stories with Paul and Ben was the perfect level. Thanks for the adjustment.  By the way if anybody ever complains that Michelle has nerve for anything she says or does, tell them no she doesn't and y'all have the video to prove it.
Where's your pride? No,no, no, not the; "unduly high opinion of oneself; exaggerated self-esteem; conceit b) haughty behavior resulting from this; arrogance". You know, the herd of cats to get them mice and rats.... Ooops, wrong rats. Sorry bout that 🙄😁👍. Man them fab rats sure got into that candy 🙄😁👍. Awesome bird!
Well that was nice of the doc to record some of the op for you!
Lemme ask an honest question without seeming too sarcastic about it: How many times does Paul compliment his wife Michelle compared to how many times he teases or is outright sarcastic with her? Some of you may even enjoy the 'Name That Part' segments, but all it does it show how Paul thinks he's so much smarter than his wife. This particular video was boring enough - swapping a carburetor back onto a 302, driving an unregistered vehicle (once again) on city streets and then doing a burnout on a smooth concrete floor? Yaaawn ... Zzzz. The addition of the sarcasm about being glad she's getting her vehicle back and biting his nails about her crashing his truck just made it even worse... I'm not going to Like or Unlike this video and most everyone can honestly say they couldn't care less. I'm simply sharing what I hope is constructive criticism and letting others know that praise and being kind is better for our souls than these demeaning little digs - especially on a Sunday morning.
So clean and whiteish work shop is just a no go for you?
I live alone and I have to say that your videos feel just like family to me.  You guys are awesome and I truly look forward do your videos. Thank you so much
Perfect finish , to signal a finished project . Nice little brotherly project to speed things up as well . I love Broncos , and have had every style accept the Bronco 2 , that was to small for me , as it was smaller than the original .  Great job on your composure Michelle , especially right after a root canal . Looking forward to your next video . Cheers
That Ford might run it's got a GM distributor in it😁😁👍👍
Whats up with that black 61-66 c10 thats been in the background for the last year? I love that body style!
Love it one of the best videos you have ever made love the chocolate tasting
ok... edelbrock ....?  what are your fixes .  once you said they had jets switched >  and a float passage bad 4 off road ..
All that soda-drink'n on this channel has finally shown the inevitable result.... a root canal. Anyone want to make a bet on who's next? Paul or Matt? $10 on Paul being next. Matcha-flavored Kit-Kt is the best!
One just must love Paul.
The shop is looking great ,love how you guys work with each other fantastic entertainment
Don't feel bad Michelle, l was in a bad accident March 3rd.. 2000 Silverado hit me head on 60 mph bounced and landed on windshield ( chevy cruze,) and then rolled. Sadly, I haven't found the courage to drive again yet. You're my idol...
I'm curious about the Bronco. MORE CURIOUS ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO START STITCHING INTERIORS LIKE MERLIN
Why not get a ultrasonic cleaner?
This is the guy I want to fix my Bronco and then do burnouts? Lost all respect Paul? I guess if it ain’t yours/ burn it down?🙄
Ain’t got no gas in it 😂😂😂
Enjoyed the rats nest Being blown from the exhaust. 😂
👏👍👊🏆🙏
You guys seriously need to watch out for hantavirus
I thought you were gonna say threw a piece of candy an many years later married the girl you threw a candy at
The shop looks so different with the new foam and paint, and panels.
That solvent parts washer is a lot like the one we have in our barn. I wasn't sure what it was. My father is suffering from dementia and showing him a picture of it wasn't enough to jog his memory. I'm hoping we can sell ours sometime soon. Trying to clean up the old barn shop.
Hey Paul, I always use to say, "Cut towards your chum, not towards your thumb." love the channel, God Bless.
Enjoying more and more your videos! I see Paul more happy and the chemistry of the team is sent to the videos! That's just a small step to the round number with 6 zeros! ...:) and hungry when I see Grandma or better saying Mom -  all the time bringing some food :)
Robby has one go over to his paint shop
We have matcha at home…. Yuck
I don't need the Bronco I'm going to win Robby's Charger !!!
I have a Ben for a brother too. Ben's are awesome.
Michelle are you feeling better from your accident and have you had any luck finding a replacement vehicle?
What's up Paul I was wondering if you have a Dana 60 Chevy   For sale I'm interested in buying one  Let me know thank you
Is pizza on Michelle's diet ???
If it ain't Cadbury's it ain't chocolate, just saying...
really good video
I had to Fast forward past the tooth mutilation 😵‍💫
Wow, you also have other Finnish viewers, you seem to have gotten good candies from here in Finland.
contact halfass kustoms on youtube! he has the parts or if not im sure he know what rock to turn over
I love the garage burnouts! 😁😁👌😎
Fabrats to 1,000,000
The eggs are “no good” so does that mean that there are no omelettes in the future?
Robby probably knows where some parts are
Shop is looking great 👍 please please don't go to commercially
I’ve got a holly 600 cfm on my jeep 4.2 ltr.
As TrailMator would say on the chewed up driveline: It's those stinking Diamond Billed Rock Peckers that did it  :)
We did get to see our beautiful Michelle after all.. I'm happy
Aww Michelle how could you imagine you could get back from town without a trip to the parts store???
Poor Michelle dentist s are always no fun good video as always enjoyed thanks
Michelle, I just had to visit the endodontist the other day. I wound up with an extracted tooth, and a bone graft to eventually get a tooth implant. Getting old is not for the faint  of heart!
Cut towards yours buddy not your body
Thanks Guys
What would be an ideal price for a 55 c3100 not running but in good condition ?, going to look at one this week don’t want to over pay or lowball
Hey Paul ,you need to get a ultrasonic cleaner, when you do carbs and other stuff. The parts would come out like new.
Nices
Face book groups i belong to. 41 to 46 Chevy & GMC Trucks, 41-46 chevy truck parts for sale,1941-1946 Chevy Pickup On S-10 Frame hope they help!
Finnish candy. Retro carb, check
You need a bunch of cats to take care of the rat problems….😊😊
You guys (and Michelle) could do a channel on just tasting!!  The problem is that we wouldn't be able to tell when you are being truthful or not!  Be sure to let the kids join in, their response is so funny!  Love your channel!
Hey Randall. How about explaining what the hell you are talking about the eggs. What did you mean that they were no good?
I fell asleep during my first root canal.  I think I’ve had 3 of them.  I lost track.  You’ll be fine.
What is the purpose of doing the burnouts?  Love your videos. Watching from Alaska
Love Michelle too. OMG Paul your amazing, my Dad was a jack of all trades also. I can tell you learned so much from him.
Good burn out!👉💨💨
You just complained about burnouts in the shop.
Off topic, however I’ve noticed particularly in this video that the shop is much brighter since all the work that was done with the paint/cleaning/insulation, great job! It appears to make a difference in the video quality…..maybe?!?
Bahahaha... Graydon... I'll give you a crumb!... Michelle, you picked the wrong day for your dental work!
Hahaha,  way to cover your life on the go. 😁😁🤣
Look! a REAL Bronco!  Save the Bronco wipers!!! LOL!!!
My friend had the old school Bronco. Compared to the new ones there is no comparison. The new ones are just a silly suv. The first root canal I had was a good experience.
Paul and the professor.
I’ll bet Ed would prefer to get his Suzzz running before he can no longer drive....  An Ed Fan
I’m not sure how but Michelle looks even prettier
I saw a live and smoking rat blown clean across the road, when an old wrecker was started for the first time in well over 10 years. 🐀
This is the best "TV show" ever
Nice 🥕and the bronco
Has Michelle gotten a new ride yet??
Had a 73 Bronco back in the 80s, they are hard to find now, at least up north.
Contact Iron Trap Garage channel for the front clip... they may be able to help. IronTrap Garage
That was so nice to see you tasting Finnish candies 😂. That was a great set of different flavors.
Burning tires is very childish !! sorry i think !!
Those Ford HEI distributors are awesome
Sure ran better after you launched the vermin out of the exhaust system! 😆
Fab Rats crew Paul Ben & Randal (Michelle included) Y'all are awesome!! boys too!
You need a shuttered roof exhaust fan to remove burnt rubber from the shop. That chit's not good for your lungs.
Ever run into a forklift with the forks up off of the ground? LOL. Pretty funny. LOL/ I have seen it a couple of times and it is very damaging! Did you not complain about the black soot all over everything that last time you did a burn out in the shop? Hmmmm???
If you need a place to store your elk antler you can send them to me. I store them on guns an knives 😂
Awesome truck! Had a coworker that had a1978 Bronco. He decided to put it in 4 low with it in granny gear and tried to do a burn out on pavement. Took all but a second and you heard the loudest bang every. Snapped the transfer case right in half. 😂 Funniest thing ever!
Michelle  I did not need to see that 😱no no no nope🤢
I have a 1976 ford 390 P>ick UP Truck that needs carb and valve train work. Interested ?
I have a lake Powell story like that when wind blew our rented house boat side ways on shore and the speed boat got blown all over the place. Scary wind storms there. Your story brought back some good family memories! Love what you guys all do!
I was in your neck of the woods around Monday and Tuesday and really wanted to stop by but didn't because I didn't want to bother you lovely people. Keep up the good work and keep the videos coming.
Michelle's editing has really improved the video quality over the last year. Good work Michelle. You cannot let the guys take all of the credit.
I do not get the melting tires for fun, just don't get it.
@fabrats you should might clean the cab air intake since there was mice in there.
Throw an LS in that bitch! /sarcasm
I want to see the Jeepster roll in the shop and drive out.
🐼~ 𝕮𝖔𝖔𝖑 𝕭𝖊𝖆𝖓𝖘 ~🐼
Pikes peak automotive give them a call they have about everything
So is it less expensive to have two mechanics rebuild an older carb than buying a new one?  I could have done without watching the oral surgery.
All those burn-out rubber streaks in front of the house... LOL!
I chewed all my fingernails off wondering what and when about that Bronco. Thanks for finally letting us know. I was really hoping it was yours and you were gonna do some cool stuff to it. Like your friend, I wouldn't sell mine for the world.
That’s crazy flying rats nest 🤣🤣🤣🤣
ok i have a confession to make   ,,i  am declaring myself a fabrats  junkie. it is like candy to a fat kid. brings a smile to an old man's face along with   some Memorys   of doing my own wrenching in the early 90, Machelle, Paul, Randell and all of the gang are just great. thanks for the bright spot   in my day
I think that’s the best reason for those old bronco to be rare if you have one you have to have two. I had a problem hoarding Jeep’s and their parts now I have people coming over to liberate them for favors.
Get well Michelle
22:20  One of the best things about this family is that Paul never quite grows up - and Michelle never quite learns not to say things like "Let me smell it..."  😀
There's a hood on ebay right now for the correct year.
Its going to be interesting to see Paul working on the freshly painted golden nugget; everything he has ever worked on was rusty and dented. 😉😉
Another day moving forward in the shop I like it Michelle hope you’re not in to much pain for to long happy Sunday Fab rat’s
Love the impromptu chicken farming segment
I know that knife is called a knife, it has a sharp blade, and it will sure kiiiiiillll.
Its all pauls fault as a fab rat since rats and mice chew on things to keep their teeth A number 1!  Paul didnt give her enough shop items to chew on!
Now that I saw the Monte Carlo in your moms yard, I’m going to ask when it’s getting built on every video you post😂😂😂
Michelle, rum is from sugar cane molasses it is diluted flavor of that
Don't know anything about that knife, but it has a tanto tip, which I hate. Had one once, and i finaly had to take my belt sander to it and re-contour the tip to a more standard contour. Sharpened it up, and now it's a useful knife!
liked taste and tool
If in Texas you'll get this...... Michelle did a Beto O'roark LOL
ROOT CANAL???????????? HOILY HEADERS BATMAN!!!!  screw root canals.........go get paul and have him weld it all up!
Do you have a rooster?
Ford baby 🤘🤘🤘!!!! Paul you look great driving a ford … like to see more ford stuff !!!
When using a knife it's" Cut towards your buddy not your body"...😉
Let Landon build a rock crawler out of this old ford
Paul I'd love to see you build a burnout car for one of cleetus shows.
More great entertainment!  Michelle, I cringe at the dentist part though!
Looking for 42 parts check out adventures made from scratch.  He’s always getting the old iron.  He saves his favorites.
i love how now with Ben around we get additional perspective on the "storytime with.." lol
As always, great video...fun to watch all your crew does. Randall's egg/chicken segment was educational. But guys...you gotta stop slamming Ford! Some of us, against all odds, still love'um!!!😁
I have had a number of root canals and the pain causing the need for the root canal was far worse than the procedure.  To me its really not much more than getting a filling but I do have a great dentist.
9:40 Not a life jacket to bee seen.
The truth comes out, Michelle was Bajain'. Good stuff guys and Gal.
Your mom and pops did a great job raising you two boys!  Very fine gentlemen!  God Bless You And Your Family's!  ps, would love to see a video of you and your boys playing with your rc rock crawlers!
I can't wait to see what you guys do with Sherm's Samurai.
My uncles used to have an old Bronco... "3 on the tree" 4x4 ... It woulda made a fabulous crawler...
Your brother way better to watch than Randal
I hope it had a hot battery on it when them rats chewed the wires maybe they rode the lightning 🌩! 🤣 🤣
Paul, you get that Jeepster squared away for Michelle, you would be worrying less about Michelle driving your truck.  😁😁🤪🤪
OMG, I swear that I could smell burning rubber!
No I haven't
SO here is a DUMB question ???  Why don't you do your burns where the rear is pointing out the door??  So the smoke and rubber go's outside instead of filling up the shop whit smoke and blowing RUBBER all over the shop??????? LOL....
I know just how you feel Paul. We pull our RV with our 2006 Silverado Duramax and I'm a nervous wreck every time she needs to drive it to town!
Hmm Hmm, two-legged Rats. Play safe from Elliot Lake, Ontario, Canada.
Cut towards your buddy not your body 👍👍from this guy
Dumbest thing I ever did was sell my 1970 Bronco,,,  351 windsor,,,  full cab,,  dual tanks,,,  jeep hunter,,  dumb,,, dumb,,,
"Whoever sent this to us..." Can you really not write down or take a picture of the sender's name before you separate the items from the packaging/letter? Postage is expensive - especially from Asia. It's important to try and get the names for a proper thank you. P.S. I still love you all. You'll have to forgive me but that was pounded into me when I was got gifts as a kid. 😂😂😂
I got to say the shop looks really good it looks really bright I bet you can see a whole lot better good job guys love it 👍👍
Paul, Matt, and Cleetus are the best YouTube creators. Everyday people doing awesome things. Love every video posted.
When are you going to pick the winner for the 65 coronet?
Carburetors and dental work in the same episode! Only on Fab Rats ☺
i hope to see you at the Freedom Factory one Day doing a real man burn out
When are you going to do a Scout? Puppy approved.
Wonder if it'll overheat without the fan shroud. I always used to throw my fan shrouds awy when I was a kid, and I never could figure out why I had issues with them over heating, but I do live in SWFL.
Lol , awesume
Check robby. For fenders for the Chevy.
Sending love from Commiefornia.  Don’t forget about us outnumbered freedom fighters!  Skål!! ᛟ
Just when you think your all out of Hanta virus…🦠
Cool old bronco!
Outstanding video in every respect!  Great content and editing. Best video yet!
the rats nest was hilarious
Then but pour 5 gallons of Fuel on the Bronco double the price of the Bronco.. LOL 😆😆😆
Morning Fab Rats Family ❤️❤️ Central Oregon is on the hunt for "pieces and parts" for the '42...!!! Can't wait to see it taking it's turn in the shop!!!  Sorry you had to miss out on the "chocolate taste tests" Michelle, but the 'stash' will taste TWICE as good when you're able to incorporate it back into your allowable food groups🤩  Stay Frosty... Keep your powder dry and your head on a swivel.... 🇺🇸🇺🇸WWG1WGA🇺🇸🇺🇸NCSWIC🇺🇸🇺🇸 Prayers and much love to all with angels to watch over your travels. ❤️❤️👼🙏🙏👼❤️❤️
In the SW, dirty is purdy!
Paul , Randall and  Ben good job guys keep up the good work
Randal needs a new hat !!!
I love those Edelbrock carburetors. I used to be afraid to work on carbs. but i forced my self to learn those Edelbrocks. My truck runs like a champ.
The 1975. I bought a 68 Bronco. Stock Jeep tires on it. Didn't have no backseat I found one down the street from where I left paid 25 bucks for it. Had Defenders cut flares on it put some fifteens by 33's on there put headers on it. The original motor start burning oil so I had that change put a factory rebuilt that was bored out original order was 289. This other ones for spinner 289😊. Got rid of the smog pump. Cuz it was on my Mustang 65. But that thing would make those big back tires bark like dogs. It would lift the front end. 3 speed on the tree. This was a northern California. I had that thing for 45 years same motor. I never put more than 60,000 miles in that thing. After while when I got separated it's at more than what I drove. Talk to Southern California headset different 5 years. Drawing from Southern California to Missouri. I got rid of it two years ago had that thing for 45 years. Had to sell it couldn't work anymore. That they would Clan The Impossible. My cousin had a 72. He was always getting stuck the river in sand. Call me to clock in the morning I have to go pull him out. I wish I still had that thing. The only minor buddy rested had on the floorboard cuz it still had the original floor mats in it moisture underneath. Had a liver transplant didn't work anymore. Lot of partying back in the days too young. So the first seven thousand bucks. In Southern California could have got 20. Or more. I have no way to get there. This came from an old farmer . The gear the board from your he restores them. He had one that was a rock climber. Jamiroquai moradabad I wouldn't sell it to him you're going to fix it and give it to his grandson. So I hope that guy who has that Bronco there I really appreciate it I really appreciate it mine.. and yes it gets pretty hairy when you're climbing Hills when you go to 3 speed on tree put that thing in Low 4 I didn't even touch the clutch or the brake.😫☹😡. Not bad running how did hair no-hitters. Any problem with mine was I'd break axles and my partying days and I would drive it home about 10 miles. One time though really bad time I won't never forget coming down the hill from the dumps with my trailer my grandfather my aunt youngest son Highway was at the bottom of the hill I got pretty close to the stop sign when my brake pedal went to the floor so you either have to go left or right and I was tried doing 8 miles an hour I made a left turn a dump truck came through I program to her gravel white spot got to stop The Carter pinned underneath a broken from the brake pedal stuck it through there and it stayed in there till I got to Missouri 40 years later.😱😳🤪👍🏽✌🏽👌🏽👊🏽💪🏽👏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽. Thank you Paul for the memories of a Bronco. Good job guys.🤷🏽‍♂️🙋🏽‍♂️.
Watching them fill Michelle’s tooth made me cringe. I hate having my teeth worked on.  I think Ben is a good addition to the crew.
Oh and you guys are the best ones on YouTube
The Kit Kats are from Japan.
Good luck to you Michelle looks like a lot of pain good to see you you guys are so awesome and great parents good to see Randall Paul's brother it'd be nice if his mom could come in every now and then to is a very nice lady
I got my type rating in the MD-11 freighter in Finland long ago. Retired now. Blue Sky's.
Black licorice is the worst.
"It tastes better than it smells..." I'm sure we've all been there... Lol...
As far as the knife goes... It's red. It folds. It's sharp. Keep the pokey part away from you.
cool bronco when are you going to work on the cornet
Owner probably originally found this on some back road and it was dead; then you fixed it…😁
Does that woman ever NOT smile?
Jiffy cornbread mixed with baking soda,  takes care of rats. Safe for pets if they get into it.
Over by Leech, Oklahoma they have a junk yard over there that would probably have what you are looking for, but will you travel this far if they do.
Sweet you guys got the Japanese Kitkats!
Great story time with Paul and Ben ,And Michelle you are a trooper for being a good sport and taking the ribbing from your man , I know who's doing the editing so I know what I'm saying.
I hope you get to be a driver Paul. I have to tell you your content is so far above the normal you tubers. Really is wonderful to see great people doing great stuff. Thank you and your team!  Just have to say Michelle is amazing! She gets a root canal(drives herself there) then washes your truck, get parts and dinner !!!! Take care my friends and do a kindness Mark
Beautiful Bronco, could tell you my story about mine and having a family and it had to go but this is a happy ending so... Michelle in the dentist chair with the dental dam looked like the character in the movie the Mask ha ha. Thanks for sharing another great video.
All the car guys on youtube constantly talk about the mice in the cars and engines... I am wondering if possibly the mice have evolved and are developing higher intelligence and know they will need to study our vehicles so they have an advantage during their war against the humans.
Ouch Michelle!
You mentioned Finish chocolate. I’m heading to Finland to visit my daughter and her family shortly. I have been taste testing Finnish chocolate and licorice for the last 3 years. I’ll get to purchase Finnish chocolate first hand. I’m excited. Enjoy the Finnish candy.
scouting has gone so far down hill i don't want to be associated with them anymore even though i had many fond memories of scout camp and earning merit badges.
I think Paul needs to acquire a new Rooster...
Hatching hen eggs is a crap shoot, but if you don't get chicks at least you can eat the failures.
Paul you need to invest in a hydra sonic cleaner! Saves on all that carb cleaner and saves on your hands!
Love seeing the old ford broncos running again where I live there isn't many left in good shape running
Sounds like a Disney movie fab rats they keep the old man's dealership alive doing all the work at night !
Paul with the old "Cut your Chum not you Thumb."
🦅🇺🇸💪😁👍
Never ever, ever do a root canal! Just yank the tooth.
I like how ford plans ahead. They left a place for you to put your tools while your workin on the engine!
It’s too bad the Bronco was for a friend, I was hoping you were saving it for one of the boys, or Gracie.
So as a kid I got up on Sunday and watched "Looney Toons" you know  'Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner' Now it's Looney Tunes with "Mush Mouth Peanut Butter Brain Randal", "Fixet Twice Cus That's how We Do Things Paul" and "The New Guy Who Just Might Know How To Do Stuff" ALSO just asking Michelle to do a "Burn-out" spin some "Donuts" or pull off a "Rockford" (Ya all ask Paul about that cus he knows what it's about)*-)  I was censored and used NO CUS WORDS....
I have a94 Bronco Eddie Bauer edition 5litre 4speed auto for sale .Needs top and a little tranny work $3000 or best   offer
" Cut towards your buddy not your body ". Works for me.
in Asia, the "Kit-Kat"s are made from cats
Get some cats...and do not feed them. That way the mice will look delicious to those hungry cats.
Yah! I graduated high school in 97 I think that was the last year that they offered auto body an auto mechanics an small engines. But not no more.
NO, we've been asking about Ed's Jeep.....enough of the "pass around" CLICK BAIT..... Do it, finish it so we can honestly enjoy your other videos. Otherwise admit your scam !!!
Hey Michelle, hope whatever you're trying to nail down with the elimination diet gets figured out. Got some digestive type issues myself, and have greatly improved my quality of life by eliminating certain foods. Stay strong, it's worth the trouble and sacrifice!
Everyone that knows knows the best chocolate is found in your friendly neighborhood Mavericks gas station. 1 innocent looking chocolate bar sitting on the shelf that most would overlook as it’s not from “the big brands” but will put you in a serious chocolate coma for a good hour.
Love watching keep up the good work
NICE! I had an 85 Ford bronco i miss it so much. Now I got a 95 gmc jimmy two door. It’s my only vehicle now it sit in my garage not running an driving 🥺 The only vehicle I drive now is a company an it not mine☹️ but hopefully one day I’ll be wheeling agin.
That was pretty cool.
Y'all helped keep me sainish while stuck leg up healing busted ankle,  liked watching weekend binge before busted ankle.  Thank y'all
I haven't wondered about it. There are new  6 cylinders that have 300 hp.
👍👍👍👍👍
13:07 I see that you like GREEN (my own favorite color, also), Paul --- green toolboxes, green seat-cushion, etc... did Michelle choose those colors, since she also had a green mouth-shield when having her dental work done? ;) :D
Nope, I'd have Randall outta there. Closer to her than Paul in every shot. Nope.
Thanks for sharing 👍😀
You Utah boys are funny my son's live in St George and Cedar everyone there is a Ford hater lol My first truck was a 1964 F100 and my latest truck is a 2019 F250 stocker pulls two trailers get about 13.5 mpg ,had a chev 69 K5 blazer cool truck and a 63 1/2ton,  just like the way my fords drive and sit best truck was a 2001 f150 5.4 love love loved that rig , keep trucking and I will keep watching 👍
best chocolate on earth is Daffin's Candies.
NH oil undercoating  has a undercoating with a mouse / rat deterrent in it
Minot north Dakota  salvage bought a front clip for my 37 chevy have many parts
Cool...
Stock engine = 600 carb Mild to 3/4 Cam = 750 Anything radical racing = way more carb...  That 609 Edelbrock should do the trick.... Sometimes it helps to add a 1" spacer depending on what intake you are using....!!!!
Love your easy going style Paul , and that bubba knife are great !!   Keep being you
Great to "see" inside the shop!! (ligths improvements)
I do love me a Bronco.
Did NOT want to look in ANYBODY’S MOUTH!!!
no, sorry Michele, the best chocolate is in Belgium! 😆
the only thing i would do with the bronco is try and put it back to 3 on the tree. and some small mud tires.
I hate fords but this is my favorite channel on YouTube
This is one of your best videos ever! Really good editing and sound. Dual plot with the shop and Michelle's trip to the dentist. And some worldly food tasting. Even some chicken wrangling. Lots of fun and hilarious family time!  Thanks, I needed this. 🙂
Quick question:. Is the bronco's fuel line rather close to the exhaust?
Won't be watching FabRats videos during lunch any longer, thanks Michelle!
Paul I have a ?? For you my nephew has a 1987 ford bronco how hard is it to put a straight axe in it we've rebuild the hole thing but that . I'd like to send you some pictures of it
Poor Michelle... That's okay we love you Michelle. Still have to tease you a little bit.
Haha I got a root canal on Friday I feel your pain
Those kit kats were from Japan.
you guys and Matt are the few that release videos on Sundays...THANK YOU. most channels go MIA on the weekends
Awesome!!!!!
lucky for you guys naming your channel FAB RATS and not FAB BEARS or you'd have a bear problem. the channel would be a bit more extreme.
I seen a 56 suburban on Barrett Jackson  sell for 65000 all original look to it
So do your clients get a rebate because you burned off a quarter inch of their rear tires?!  I'm a fan of Fab Rats, but not of tread melting and toxic smoke!
Chocolate Coma!
That’s TMI on the dental visit... 🤢🤮
Good video, keep them coming
That needle looking thing went way up into your jaw! Dang that's scary!
I have young taste buds. Classic.
Hay hay love this channel, just had a birthday I got a Fab Rats T-shirt and sticker 🤔 think the sticker will go on my 62 Falcon I am building 😅😆
Surely you meant "Gauges" ... Gage actually means something VERY different, like a guarantee of fulfilment with your life as penalty.
It needs a 5.0 Coyote in it and some trick suspension and a satin clear coat.  New project, burnout pad in front of the shop.  Just talk to Cleetus McFarland when you go race the Crown Vic.  👍
If Randal is going to be helping Ben when Paul is out of the shop, aren't you going to need another step ladder? 🤣  I'm glad Michelle was numb up to her eyeball after seeing how FAR up, they were shoving things in her tooth! 😲
Bubba knife looks pretty meh. They don’t list what steel the blade is made from on their own website.  That is generally a huge red flag when it comes to quality materials.  I’d say just take a little bit of time sharpening up your trusty Benchmade 940 and you’d be far better off.
@12:25 I've never seen a root canal being done. Thanks, Michelle. Oh boy, learning new stuff @27:13 Randall candles chicken eggs.
Hey Fabulous!, Fantastic!, 🐀's!, I might have to stop watching your Channel?, Faby 🐀!! I thinking working on a Bronco?, a Ford Bronco is a good idea!!💡 ???🥺
I love the fabrats canal and watches almost every video. I also like that Michelle and the kids appear from time to time. But what I really don't like to see is a dentist visit between a bronco build. sorry...
Burnout’s are immaturity made reality
👍👍🇺🇲 Lgb!
Alright a real bronco!! none of this new plastic made in Taiwanese over priced barbie jeeps that they are calling the new bronco
"I knew you were a drunkard" hahahahahaha!
I have had problems with Edelbrock carbs wearing out the main metering needles. That's why I am a Holley fan. Thank you Paul and family for all of your time and videos.
Dinner, I love your haircut!!  Low drag and low maint.!!  Looks great!! Oh, and the Nugget looks fantastic!! Nice work guys!
Lol, I always click the like button before I even watch the video. Ain't never been disappointed or had to change it!
Jeez chevy owners can be so insuferable when talking about ford. Guess their just jelous that theirs will never run as good as a ford 😅
Nice Video ! Thanks for sharing ! Sorry about the bad Tooth deal ! OUCH !
i would still like a sticker for my titan,thanks guys.hope michelle is fellin better
Hooray for root canals. 🙃 Just shoot me. Hope she’s feeling better.
If’n ya ever go to Finland, go to the Fatzer candy factory. They have a tour where at the end of it, you can do an “all you can eat” chocolate feast! It’s amazing! Eva, our Finnish friend, and I ate so much we got sick (we ate all of each type of candy, waste not want not) but my wife only sampled each flavor and threw the rest away. I THINK THATS TERRIBLE! (But she didn’t leave with a tummy ache either) Glad you had the opportunity to try it-
Randle, any voice job offers, with ur drawl, lol?
Geno Rife here. Just fyi, German chocolate is considered to be the best chocolate in the world. The Swiss even consider it to be the best!
luv watching you guys ,ben &you complement each other,good job bringing in your bro!!!!
Unsubbing waaaaaaayyyy too many commercials 11 is too much
Hi Michelle, did not need the mouth shot but great hair. Paul, there are some happy Ford owners with very dependable history.  When I see burnouts I just see money and stink. Love the channel. Great old Bronco. Good work Ben while Paul wandered through his stuff, ha!
My dad has a friend named bones who collects broncos as well. Pretty crazy.
Burnouts ? Yes please . Kinda makes me want to do some with my van , but , it would most likely go boom ( and clank and crunch 🤪 )
Utah pack rats are terrible
It must be nice to have fans all-over the world. Some of the stuff you get is strange but still appreciated I am sure. Finnish candy is very good but the Frazer made choklad is not as good as the Swedish made Marabou choklad. At least this is an ongoing argument in our family.
Gauges??
No, it's "Cut toward ur buddy, not ur body", ha, cheers!
oh wow, maybe less dental footage... I had to hold my hand in front of the screen because I'm a little baby.
I watch another channel it's called Irontrap Garage they might have your parts
It's awesome to see "Ben power" on full display in this episode. Good job Fab Rats, it was smart to bring him on. Paul can do the all important dad stuff (love it) and the work on the Bronco went on for us. Thanks guy.
Looks like you need a carb dip tank.
How big a discount does the customer get for all the smoke that you let  out of the tires Paul?
Great video,glad to see bronco getting new lease on life.just keep it up and carry on.kudos 👍👍👍😎😎😎
You guys are to funny i love this Chanel
"Not for sale" just means "not for sale YET" lol
Oh look is that a FORD and it can smoke the tire's well what ya know.
Keep us updated on the chickens if you can I’d really like to know if they hatch
I cringed when I saw you we're working on a Ford, but I was pleasantly surprised, 35 minutes and you only bashed Ford once. Nice burnout too!
You should take one of your rigs to Cleetus and cars burn out shows.
Paul’s a pretty good sanger I’d say, he could carry a tune far enough to bring home probably if he wanted to…I mean he’s no Michelle of course but still 👍
You have to cut one leg off and wear a eye patch. 🤣 I wouldn't want to drink either if does were the requirements.
Story time? Where is the popcorn and pop@???😆
you will need to clean the shop again ...
It was those big rats that tore bronco up. 😆
Paul "you won't see Michelle"  *Michelle edits her clips in* 😆
I hope Michelle is feeling better and she has pain medication!
damn the root canal shots almost knocked me off my chair.  eesh!
I always like the videos first,because if I don’t, I’ll get into it and forget to like it. Besides, I know I’m gonna like it. It’s FAB RAT’S! What’s not to like! Keep em coming guys!
Where the heck can I find a woman like Michelle. Somehow finds time to do all of the things for normal everyday life plus video editing, plus driving HERSELF to and from the dentist for a root canal while picking up parts and getting pizzas to bring home for dinner. Absolutely unbelievable, Paul is one lucky man. We see you Michelle <3
Now we get to hear em complain about black stuff everywhere, lol 🤣
Believe me once u try Euro.  choc hersheys will be a distant memory  and a bad one at that
Yay!
That pipe in the ceiling makes a great dimmer switch. Glad your face is feeling better Michelle. Merlin knows where those Chevy truck parts are
Time to get some cats.
looks like Paul is loving the self-employed / working from home life ... i get the feeling he hasn't missed any of his kids ball games since he quit
My mechanic's theory is electrical wire casing is made from peanut oil.  I think mice just like anything plastic or rubber.  I maintain two vehicles in the Sonoran Desert where mice engine damage is very common and the mice love 93 GMC truck more so than the 98 Subaru Outback.  I think it's the larger engine compartment because it doesn't matter where I park the GMC they always find it.  I have found putting moth balls in empty cottage cheese containers with holes midway up all around and the lid off works.  Two of these inside engine compartment on the finder wells and one on the header near the air filter keeps them at bay. Just a suggestion I have found works.
The spread of that rats nest on the floor was so comical
I just love that old Bronco , I'm so happy it's on the road
What's up with your rollback you have to work on building?
Thank's Y'all, now you have me wanting to do burnouts with my Super Powerhouse 95 Tacoma.Or maybe it's just wishful thinking. Good job getting the old Bronco running again. Best part was when the rats nest blew out the tail pipe.
Free tip for you Paul from a retired mechanic, I heard you say put saw dust on the break fluid spill. Absolute best thing is water, it neutralizes break fluid in seconds. Just throw water on and wipe up or hose it out. Same goes for cleaning brake drums full of brake fluid after a wheel cylinder leak job, just hose it out.
I didnt know we had the best chocolate in the world
Fix her car boys
Awesome video Paul and now I have also say the crew, with your two helpers!!! Lol!! Remember keep up all the hard work buddy!!
More work,less candy.  mchelle you are a beautiful young lady ., and a good oil changer.  if I EVER GET THERE ,PAuLBETTER KEEP  his eye on me  ju st kidding.
The flavored kitkats are awesome, especially the apple pie one, and the smores
I love the chicken egg lesson.
Fixed it and it runs, now we just got to burn the tread of them tires and then hand it back to the customer. Thanks for watching. Hahahah
It was nice of Tom Segura to take time out of his busy schedule to give Michelle a root canal.
I do as well, i want that Bronco
You need a sonic cleaner for your carbs. Works great
Michelle, you are for sure a Trooper for the Channel.
Truly a Fab Rats start on the Bronco :)
OMG,  I absolutely love your channel, educational, entertaining,  and often comical ! Thank you so much for sharing your life experiences with all of us .
Oh you all got all fancy with YouTube money. Spending fancy money on a tooth doctor. You have plenty of tooth grabbers in the shop, you don’t need all them tooth’s. Just need one in the front.
This was such a fun video! Thanks guys!
Gauges*🤣
Did you hear Michelle was going to wash the truck!  My kind of woman!  My wife can't even clean the windshield when she can't see through it!
Love the split screen 👍
I have a question if you do get to race in the cleetus crown vic race in Bristol will you be bringing a burn out car for the burn out contest???
Chev’s of the 40s is the best place to find parts they amazed me many times when my brother and I restored our grandpa’s  42 Chevy pickup
❤️❤️❤️🐀
You all eat carbohydrates, carbohydrates change your mouths acidity which then allows tooth decay. Hence her root canal.  No carbohydrates and everything gets better. No beer belly, better sleep, more energy. Not to mention all the disease carbohydrates cause
t=This is why Sunday mornings are so good fresh pot of coffee and FR,MORR,DL, oh and chocolate taste testing👍
You gonna burnout the Nuggie?
Paul darn it I keep saying we both love doing the same things and also love trying new things!! Just the other day we was at the store and my lady baught some kitkats that were blueberry muffin kitkats!! We tried them and I didn’t think that they were bad but I definitely like the regular ones probably better!! My better half was saying that different flavor kitkats are a big thing over seas but I can’t remember what country she had said but I think she said it was a big thing in China or Japan maybe but I definitely can’t remember!! How funny that we both just had been trying different kinds of chocolate!!! We also have a place in Des Moines Iowa called the chocolate story book that makes all kinds of candys and my favorite is there dark chocolate covered Cherries!!! Some of those with a can of MTDew is my snack every night after dinner until gone!!! Lol!! Absolutely love them things!!!
When you get little ceasr get your pizza heartaches  they take the butter and the cheese  for the crazy beard on the pizza
Don't get bloody cut towards for buddy.
Every root canal I’ve had has failed! Ugh I hate teeth! Why can’t we have like 6 sets of teeth that come in every 15 years!
Ok paul them why is it 65% of cars and trucks found burning along side the roads are general motors
Great job on all the editing you do Michele!
If you cant find anything in the newly organized shop....... its beside the tape measure, which is beside the black sharpie
Awesome video love every bit of it hope Michelle's mouth is recovering from getting that root canal
Paul when you are looking for your experienced parts, if at first you don't find the part you need - send Ben in! He'll know where to find it!  That 2000 calorie taste test looked refreshing. Everyone was wrenching in high gear and got the job done!
I have a 42 that I restored/ rodded. Pretty fun little truck!
A knife and it seems to have a blade just like all knives usually have, now for the serious part is it a good blade, was it well made ?
👍😎👍
Came here to watch the bronco, left due to the root canal.
That’s a good one, Michelle is brave to show the dentist visit. The editing on the videos is fantastic.Y’all are brave to try the candy random people send y’all. All the hard work of cleaning the shop and then Paul cover it in rubber smoke O well.
Fords rock and Michelle no wait needed to be lost
Your first mistake! Please do not ever show dental work. WTF
I'm sorry but nothings beat Hershey milk chocolate ok
There’s 2 41-46 chevy trucks sitting by a house in Herriman Utah. I tried to contact the home owner when I was looking for a part for mine. I couldn’t get them to answer the door. Let me know if you need me to go knocking again.
Dr Clay Williams 😂😂😂.  So I golf with that guy a couple of times a week…. Now I will have to talk with him about my favorite YouTubers.   Michell you was in good hands.
I have a Bubba Cordless Filet Knife and don't know how I did without one for the last 50 years.
Awesome video guys! I really hope Cleetus gets you to race at Bristol! I've been commenting it on all of his videos and I'm going to keep doing it til he picks you!
The Kit-Kats are from Japan!
Randal is a good addition and guy! <3
Randall's a cool cat with all the chicks.
Fabrats and Ford!! Two of my favorite things! Thanks for working on the Ford Paul.
Just wanted to let ya'll know, I put your name in the "Freedom" hat with Cletus before you even mentioned it! Figured you would be a natural fit.
By golly, I am interested in that rum candy. All of it looked good though! I just like the taste of rum 😉 keep up the good work guys, and gal. 😁 awesome video, keep them coming! This has been a comment.. from a 2 year viewer bahaha. Never miss an episode! Awesome content! Gotta keep Michelle in there, as well as all the others. Delightful, light hearted fun!
Paul robby has a lot of all them old trucks
I always use the copper oil line kit when doing Guages like those.  Even more so when mice are problematic. Good video guys.
50/50 chance of getting the right line but odds are even that you'll get the wrong one!
I can think of many good reasons NOT to do a burnout inside the shop and not a single one for!  Just Sayin'. Still my favorite shop / fab channel though
Just don't use vegetable coated wiring . Use real wire, not the new unimproved version with vegetable coating.
Paul keep this in mind don't forget this its important  if you like chrome stuff on your engine any engine don't use the chrome water neck with green antifreeze the green antifreeze eats it up from the inside i stumbled on to this by accident had a 350 chevy i dolled up chrome all over you know oil pan valve covers timing cover an water neck an the green antifreeze ate it up good info to remember
'41 thru '46?  Wasn't all auto production switched to war production during those years?
Root canals!!!  My favorite dental appointment!  After watching your appt, I'm sure Paul and Ben could have taken care of that for you!  They're mechanically inclined.  Great video!!
Ha, I was taken aback with Randal getting dusted by the fan blades; then here goes the ratcannon.  Wicked.  Noice.
Everything is for sale!
Really enjoy your videos and the Great Personalities, and tire 💨 lol
I love this family... I love this channel. 👌✌️🇰🇪🇰🇪
That was the ugliest distributor I have ever seen on a ford. And no 44 in the front 71 and older
That giveaway car will be nice since it's all been done twice lol
Having your brother on board y'all make a great team tackling these projects! Y'all keep doing it twice to do it right make that a t shirt !I'll buy one !
The shop looks great with the "junk" removed
Loved the boys chicken
The fuel line is a bit close to the exhaust.
Sure looks like your buddy Robby is taking advantage of Ed  for content with the Golden Nugget.
You need a concrete slab out front to do the burn outs, so the garage isn't full of smoke and rubber!  Good job getting it running!
Michelle is looking great!  Working out and loosing weight?  You guys are an amazing family. Thanks for sharing your life and experiences. Always a joy to watch.
Was that a $500 box of candy???    Your shop dog is named Scout?  My last search and rescue partner was named Scout, and he was a Border Collie also!   RIP little buddy.
Poor Michelle I know that hurts. Hope you feel better. God bless
Why all the ford hate?
I have a 96 bronco xlt 351w runs drives needs work??? After you do the early one you can work on the "96" last year they made em.
Paul make that tool box your mom and dad gave you a electrical box. God bless
There's a local guy in la pine Oregon Mike Shields that has what you're looking for for the front clip of that Chevy if it's something you'll be interested I can get his phone number for you just let me know thank you
No burn out on the Golden Nugget, Please. It's coming your way in show room - car show clean, and Ed should get it that way.
Fenders and such:  check out my nephew at Angry Auto Group, North Dakota. He is constantly pulling vehicles out of ND farms and has parts galore.
Blower motor!  WOOT!
Best quote of the video: Grayson "I have younger taste buds than you Randall" lol
As smart as you are I hesitate saying this but, you can put an auto oil filter on your parts washer and keep the fluid relatively clean.
That was another epic episode….thank you guys 🥳😂🤙✌️💪🤟🫶😎
Great show and the very special editor is wonderful.
That exhaust blast was nasty!  And I'd never seen a hen tuck the eggs under. It was oddly touching.
As I laugh my ass off about the screw not staying on the screwdriver I know how it is. It happens everyday to me.
I'm not sure you thank her enough, Paul 🙃🤣
No gpod eggs- 'cept fer eatin'
So you having been ask to sing in the mormon tabernacle choir?
💯Wait one on the parts Albuquerque New Mexico pimping with all those old school truck🤪🤪 lowrider capital of the world
This has been a great video all the way from the dentist to the Bronco. I had forgotten that from anticipated the need for repair and put in a ledge for your tools.
Nice work but the top radiator supports look to need a little tweaking . Just saying ....
Great video love the burn out! Long time since the lovely Michele played "Name That Part" and read the "Cantankerous Commets". Any chance of that happing soon?
Smoky burnouts!!!!
Brother tag team carb cleaning, what could be a better bonding moment? Or hours.
Haha, if Randall likes rum, ill send you a bottle when I get my shed finished, need to do another run ASAP, stocks are low and winter is upon us!
My EDC us a Bubba. I beat it up everyday and takes edge pretty easy.
Wanna confuse the hens? Put duck eggs under them.😆 The fun happens when the ducklings go in the water and momma doesn't like it.
There were at least four of the first gen Bronco's at my HS ( including the vice principles brand new 73. yeah, Im old! )  Cant believe what they demand in money nowadays! Good to see it gettin' some love.  Todd Konoske the retired trucker.
Great video awesome family I'm so glad to see the Bronco up and running again they are a good little truck I had one of the first fifty that came off the line, it had a 170 straight 6 it was a powerful motor up it had great low end and it was very reliable I never had any issues. Thanks for the awesome video and God Bless stay safe .
Paul you’re lucky to have a brother like Ben wish I had a brother like him
From root canal to candy review to roo. ..... 😁
Why do burnouts in your newly coated workshop 🤔? Just wondering. Did it look to clean for you or something 🤔?😂🤣 👍🏻🇬🇧
That bronco looks very familiar. If it was taged in Denton Texas in the 80's to the Abels it was my foster brothers. It was al red with white top then.
Tine to start wiping all the black soot off of all the tools again :)
Those rat’s were just trying to rebuild that bronco so they could move in I guess they were Fabrats lol great video and great editing Michelle.
Every Cleetus video I mention Fab Rats lol
Loved seeing the Bronco!  We love our 68 have had it since 1982 second owners🥰. We would love to see you get one to build into a crawler they are great.
Why are you ditching the holley sniper setup for a carburetor.    Wouldn't the sniper efi work better.
Brilliance in all aspects. Especially the openness and honesty.
Shirt idea.  "I'm a fixer that's what I do"
Is this a garage or a food show? LOL 👍👍👍❤️👍👍👍🤗
I wish I had that bronco to park next to my new bronco! Awesome to see you getting it back on the road!
I gotta say, best video yet. I'm being bias because I'm a Bronco nut and I bleed blue. Lol. Awhile back I stated if you did a video on Bronco that I would put my last Fab Rats sticker on my 2022 Mustang GT, well ill send pics to your Instagram. And I know where a pile of those old trucks are, I'll see what I can do.
why aall the commercials suddenly. you didint have them before. is fame going to your heads ? still like the show and family values.
Michelle!  Why in the heck would you show that? I'm gunna have nightmares now! 😬😬
Excellent show once again thank you so much.
Hey since you mentioned it, what's going on with the giveaway car. Haven't heard much about it lately, can't wait to get entered for the giveaway. Great video keep up the good work, thanks......   👍👍👍
As a Swede 🇸🇪 with a craving for licorice, no one makes it better than Finland 🇫🇮!
Nice vid 😁 and only 1 negative Ford comment. I’m impressed.
finally, man I've been itching for this
I wonder if the spark timing is a bit advanced to much as it fights the starter when cranking?
Ben evicted the family, and in the end, they were exhausted.
Who's the bearded fellow, is he working with you full time now?
Checking comments on the Cleetus video, Paul is a shoe in !!!! GO PAUL !!!!!
YES We got to see her great video
Wrong Paul that only happens to junk General Motors products and Toyotas hahaha
Paul did we not learn about shed burnouts a few vids back 🤣 either way it did a halfway decent burnout. Side note love that your shirts and that mine will be heading this way soon finally bit the bullit and got some merch im excited to see how many recognise it where I am 👍🇦🇺
Unless that root canal filling does a burnout, the dentist stuff is weird here...
Another good one Paul, Ben, Randall. Your a brave lady Michelle! Have a good one.
Great video
Hey Paul,  fellow Youtuber Matt with Iron Trap Garage will most likely have all the parts you need for the hotrod truck
Pause at 4:14 to see why i laughed when Paul said "AUGERnisation". The clue is in my spelling, (and capital letters).
Lol and now the shop is covered in black crap again. 😆🤣😆🤣😆🤣
Mag1 brake clean is the best!
Good to see the Bronco get some love.
Yeah i tried to like the video youtube wont let me paul i tried
So I reckon the inside of the shop is too clean since it was all repainted, and you need to do some burn outs, so as you can dirty it all up again. Makes it feel like home, I guess  :)
Paul can sing solo So low we can't hear him.... LOL 😂
I hate those plastic oil pressure lines to the oil gage. had them fail. I use copper.
💯💯 the part stores equals pizza for dinner equals tax write-off🤔🤔 business expense🤪🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The finnish chockats ( i suspekt you got some Fazer) is allmost as good as our Swedish made.😊
Is carbing it making it simple(less time) for you to replace?
Alright this is totally unacceptable!! I demand flavored Kit Kats in America!
What happened to Ed's jeep?
Since I told your wife how terrible her hair looked in one of your last videos. It was piled high on the top of her head. It looked like pole on the back of a bumper car!! I wanted her to know her hair looked awesome today.
👍👍
How would some one go about sending you some stuff.
Will you sell the Holley sniper ?!?!? I need one for my 88 ranger with a 351 w
Sick👍👍👍👍
Paul, a float that doesn't float is a sink.🙄
I remember those old days of carburetor cleaning... no left over parts is always a good starting point... so what are those eggs good for Randall??? Love the tube rack... very useful project... Thanks
Flood Cleetus McFarland channel requesting Fab Rats be on it!!!!!
Hey Fab Rats, I am in south east AZ and will be pulling a trailer to Ogden,Ut next week to clean out a hanger. I hope to stop by and buy a T-shirt and check things out.
I’m not a Ford guy but those old Broncos are cool even though they normally have rust everywhere.
Elk don't have horns.
What kinda truck did you park next to Michelle?
Yes smoke out the shop every week!!! Burnouts to 1 mill! We need a tire popping burnout in the shop soon!! You could use a cement skid/burnout pad out front!
Try Gas Monkey Garage & Richard Rawlings for hood and fenders
Masterfully done Paul !!! Thank you for sharing and making my day 💛
Was that a GM HEI distributor? No wonder it ran so well! Ford Durasparks suck.
Michelle, an option to a root canal is teeth like stars. They come out at night.😁
What was wrong with the factory gauges?    For future reference there is a place south of SLC that rebuilds gauge clusters, I believe it's called "classic gauges"??     Broncos use a 5 volt reference to the gauge cluster with a IVR the newer solid state ones are the best.  Ground the sending wire and see if the gauge pegs.
what kind of choke do you like on Rochester? I like thermalstatic.
I thought you learned your lesson with burnouts in the garage.    Better fire up the leaf blower to get all the black particles out again.
Grayden know when to show up, doesn't he? LOL!
Paul experienced a temporary glucose neuropathy. Over time as a Type1 Diabetic, i personally experience ongoing Diabetic Neuropathy. Unavoidable and it has taken a much longer time for me (58) to get what many T1's experience at 40.  Speaking of sugar and living in Zion (Greater KC Area), I'll see if I can send some Topsy's Popcorn and Stovers in store available only chocolates for Michelle.  I played Trumpet and Baritone. My boys played Trombone, Baritones and Tubas.
❤ watching all the family tinkering on the prospects.
You have my sympathy with that root canal hope you better luck then I did with them.
For those that don't know, the first Ford Bronco had a 107 hp v8. Not quite something to write home about. The Toyota pickup with the 22R engine had the same hp, but the difference is the torque, which Ford had more of than the Toyota.
Paul would be a dream neighbor.  Anyone..."can you help me fix..."  Paul..."yep"  Anyone..."I didn't say what..."  Paul..."doesn't matter"
I can see that Michelle is weak for old trucks....hint hint
One of my favorite YouTube channels.  Nice job on the edelbrock, may want a 4psi bypass regulator.  Root canals aren't bad theses days, hope it keeps your tooth from aching.
The exhaust looks very close to the fuel line (rubber) , will this not cause vapor lock(s) in your hot climate ?? Pls keep up the great videos.
Excellent video lots of stuff going on very entertaining and interesting! Thank you for sharing!
well done guy's
Chocolate does spoil so you better freeze it
Sorry Michelle,  I had to fast forward through you getting your face jackhammered and drilled.  That's cringeworthy..
Ok bronco isn’t for sale,why about the short bed Chevy pickup? And what year is it ?
I gotta say I'm a little confused as to why you would do burnouts inside the shop and make a mess of what you just spent so much time making look nice...that burnout dust ends up everywhere on everything.
it seemed I was always fixing things. your videos helped me laugh at myself knowing I'm not the only one in constant repair mode.
You should check out robbys junk for the fenders
I have heard of off road float setup, and off road vent setups, but never actually seen one. I know my old Dodge 4x4 ran fuel out of the vents into the motor when it got on extreme angles, but I had to get pretty stupid with it before it would flood itself
What a way to  end the weekend watching  Fab Rats, Matt's Off- road,  Robbylayton, Trail Mater, and Rudy's  Channel
Brother in law sold a cleaned up mid 70s with a Coyote motor for $150k at Barrette Jackson last year. These things are stupid expensive even rusted out.
And there was rubber EVERYWHERE
Best Episode yet.....I learned a bit about everything (with bonus taste testing). Keep up the good work.
My uncle had two broncos a 66 and 70 six in one v8 in the other both all original he sold both but he said wish he could have kept the v8 for hunting
Michelle..........Tip from the "Wise Old Dentist I Am"  The Safety Glasses aren't Just for Paul.....YOU Should of had them on in the  Chair.........Just Sayin'..........Trust me.
Thanks for infom on chickens
I have a grill 2 hoods and running boards. Your if you want..but in Colorado
Damn rats ruin  one quick
You need to get a ultrasonic parts cleaner game changer works great on carbs fuel injector etc
Small Towns are nice but, 50 miles round trip to a parts store in Kanab and 150 mile round trip to get a root canal in St George?, Yikes!
Michelle cracks me up lol love the check ups..🤣😂
Carb instead of the Sniper 🤨, just fix the wires and fab a rat trap.
My Wife can smell Chocolate 10 miles away, like a bear.
Need a rooster to have fertile eggs
Yep yep. That's my favorite Bronco style
Best to have the front facing into the shot to do burnouts so the black rubber dust don't go everywhere. Yes I learnt the hard way lol good fun though 👌🏾
I want to see you all group up in team team up with YouTube junk yard digs
***** Paul, does that dist have a steel gear? Roller motor has to have it.  1985 Mustang manual trans, duraspark dist comes with steel gear.
❤️👍👍👍👍👍😎
I wanted a old bronco unit I seen the price of one lately
The Wasabi Kit Kats are the very best but you can't find them any more.
Fab rats rules
A dimond in the ruff brother.
Where’d the name Fab Rats come from? Is there a story behind it?
I’m thinking I don’t ever want to see Michelle’s tooth get violated like that ever again. Unless you’re making a tooth rock crawler which might last cuz she’s long winded lol
5 pin relay with pigtail. 30 Amp. Amazon box of 5. Best price I've found.
The Bubby Blade fish filet knife is a great knife. I live and fish in south Louisiana and the bubba blade will filet through redfish/red drum scales but then slice a trout clean and smooth! Nice choice.  Don’t know about the pocket knife but the filet knife is the bees knees!
Gas line to close to exhaust pipe on frame.💥💥
yes!
Edelbrock...meh..  If that engine is stock.. . Better off with a 390 4bbl.  Or a 2100....
Randal's been awfully quiet lately. Fix it!
You could upload five times a day and I’d watch all of them
come on guys get hitting old Cleetus up and lets get Paul in one of those extra crown Vics.
I've grown to really enjoy your videos. I may have to get one of those hats. Thanks for sharing
wondered if that fuel pump was going to be changed out :)  y'all good....
HA!...finally... My Uncle has one that he dropped a Chevy 454 in and made a custom chevy tailgate...Oh, and painted it chevy orange... I thought you would like that captain LS...lol... he used to do the Baja races in it... now my aunt just uses it to run to the store
I have a two tear blue Craftsman  tool box just like that when I was going to school for automotive.
How did the sniper kit work on that set up. I have got close to the same set up wondering about fuel mileage thanks really love the channel really believe you would steer me in the right direction thanks
Ben sounds like Jack Black to me. Lol I can imagine him doing engine noises ri-ki-ki-ki-ki-kiiii skadooshh 😂
At my house we have squirrels in the garage, birds under the eaves and raccoons raiding the garden.  I feel your pain Paul!
The mice have probably moved out turbo-wise
I've always wanted a bronco. Cool project!
You NEED an ultra-sonic cleaner for those tight small places on those carbs….
Do youtubers use threadlocker?  I see Paul's NOT the favorite child 🤣
I'll come back after my mouth stops hurting!
Root canal poor babe, Hahaha will it help with silence. Nothing personal, just a guy up North..
IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME!!!!; thank you for giving the Bronco the attention it deserves.
Get you one of Michelle's muffin pans to hold all those carb parts while you rebuild it. Keeps everything organized. And bring me my give away car!!
I have that exact same tool box!!!
Try the corn meal and baking soda trick for mice and rat problem.
My dad had  a 74 that was the same color when he first got it.
Sweet I've owned a few wish I could afford another one.
always wanted a old Branco or a old scout
After the big storm in Southwestern Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦
Love it
How many people like Paul’s videos before even watching? I do.
Let's goooo fab rats crew
Good morning thank you the videos. You should build the FJ roll cage taller in the back so it’s more safe for the rear seat  🍻🇺🇸🤙🏻
😀😃😄😁😆
