Man!!! You was in the city. WHEN YOU COMING TO HARLEM!!!! NOW THATS GANGSTER
Boi he got off I kant even front
All gas no brakes 🔥
Sure these rappers enjoy a small percentage of success but the moment they scream "mob ties" it's a cap on their growth and success. They're not free, we all know they're paying dues. If they ever want to be free and truly do their own thing, that's when the problems will start. Nippsey was an example of that. I like trapboy freddy and finesse but they'll be more than what they are. One might say look at Drake, Drake is a Canadian citizen, he's not in Texas like that and he has his own security.
Sliding then
I haven't seen a southern person shoot a video in New York in years
This hit even harder in the whip
Fuck mob ties he a bitch for fucken with mob ties niggas thing they gangsta pussy
