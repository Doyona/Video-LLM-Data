Why don't you show us the face of the suspect who was arrested for this?
How do you say you’re dad is such an amazing person and then say you’ve never hugged him. I’m confused. Why wouldn’t you hug someone you loved, respected and admired. I’m sorry that you lost him, but it doesn’t seem as if you really appreciated the type of man he really was.
I’m seeing this in August 2025. Hope his boy was able to more forward after the horrible tragedy.
Any update on the trial/sentencing?
Had to be a black

shoot outs a TACO BELL and CHICKFILET nothing. Very strange attitudes toward fast food joints wonder why?
Poor kid. May God give the family rest.
RIP 🙏🎖️ Sorry to hear of your loss. SENSELESS 😐
The killer deserves the death sentence but given a 1901 racist style execution it’s what he deserves
What I would have given to personally make that killer feel the pain that the fathers son felt. I’m sorry for your loss. Sincerely hoping you’ve recovered from this horrid act of violence.
I am sure you will let him out without bail.
On a large note, keep voting the same way you did. I'm positive the p0s never had any warrants and the judges never free him!
Rest
You will be just like your father Carlos! God's got your back!!
Who could even dare... what kind of monster murders someone in front of their kid???
Damn that's crazy tho the man working at the Taco Bell literally had nothing to do with the fake 20 why even shoot some that has absolutely nothing to do with anything. He was literally just doing his job 🙄 WTF???????????
I've been following this story since it first occurred, why haven't they published the killer's face yet? He's been in custody for weeks...
So tragic. Definitely worth remembering that you never know when the last time you’ll see someone might be so make the most out of the short time were given
So sorry for your loss. It is sad when a hard working person gets killed because of some idiot. God bless this family and know that you will meet up again when you pass on. He is just ahead of you and waiting.
These Psychopaths who KILL and who ENABLE these killers represent the very WORST of the world's ONE race, HUMAN. It is HUMANITY and COMPASSION that makes this Constitutional Federal Republic WONDERFUL. The reason a FEW have spent decades and billions to isolate and dehumanize so many and to FREE violent criminals is being witnessed NOW. They literally HATE those who strive for independence, pride and LOVE this country. Family and Faith add to the strength to resist EVIL!
We going to bring justice and i asked to who because the new normal support the criminals and make law able citizen criminals ...
Stop ignorant the massive elephant in the room, Black crime against Latinos, and Asians is out of control. This is NOT an isolated event.
$2M bail or bond is chump change. The bail or bond amount shall be increased to $100 centillion, minimum, or no bail at all.
Who is the guy that got arrested?
This is so sad, A working man shot down  by a street maggot.  Another George Floyd passing counterfeit bills..  The only way to defeat evil is to destroy it.
Everytime I see this article of news my heart breaks again and again for his son.
Rest well you’re in heaven with God prayers to family and friends. I hope they can get through this.
Anyone know how to contact this young man?
Omg 😭 may God bless his soul!
That taco bell should name a chalupa or nacho meal after him or something with the proceeds going towards the family.
Disgusting hate crime by the typical Defund the police mob! He used a counterfeit 20 are they going riot loot have parades for the suspect!
Biden's America lol
🙏
Why just criminals kill other criminals. Not the innocent ones
George floyd wins again.. Shout out to everyone who supported blm, good job on the news for not revealing his identity
💔💔💔 just heartbreaking
Say the race of the suspect????
This is absolutely heartbreaking! The violence has got to stop!!
Evil got no respect for age or gender.
Why can’t the news media ever show us who the murderer is?  Why keep protecting their identity if not don’t report it till you’re ready to do so
I hope corporate appreciates their sacrifice and service. Might not be a battle field, but bullets still flying and for no fame; no glory. At least the father and son shared a moment.
The best thing is that he is already like his father they both have a great career at Taco Bell make crunch wraps and denying fake $20 dollar bills
What a shame
Why won’t they show the black suspects face?
FYI THE SHOOTER IS BLACK SHOCKER!!! I know!
I hope the criminal gets beheaded and tortured with slow painful death 🖤. I would find them and torture anybody that messes with family and beheaded them and send it to his family or hang it on the streets oh hail to bringing justice to the deserved
They won’t show the killer because we all know the killer was a black lives matter supporter, and you aren’t allowed to point that out. Latino lives matter too.
California sooo sad! A news station that gloats how great it is! You have a lot of problems California!!
Jonathan madden the killer is out on a 2 million dollar bail. Cant even pay for 20 dollars worth of taco bell.   To hell with him
Where is his mug shot ?
Rip this is devastating!😥😥😥😥
Burger king then taco bell,, whats next?
Garcetti is more concerned about the killers well being!
I'm sure George Gascon will set this criminal free. Criminal lives never matter let's keep it that way get rid of Gascon!
If they don't stand up for fast food workers we will have to make our own food 😩🇺🇸👀🚔
Ik the wings are bad but this man had a shootout…
Public hanging eye for an eye nothing less. Start sending "real" messages to these murderers. Dont give him a comfortable jail cell. Just end the mf.
Always tell your love ❤️ ones you love them - life is to short
gascon will let the perp out early.
Dang, that’s awful. You have this incident and then you have the Burger King employee gunned down in NY, when does it end. It’s time for our leaders to hold these people accountable or elect new people who will
Isaiah 57 1 🙏
burger king and tacobell what is happening
That's s nice haircut
Rip pops!
Good job LAPD
Remember everyone death is always around the corner you never know when you're gonna die. And once you're dead that it's, no turning back. Repent and believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For Jesus died and rose for us so that we can be justified and washed in His blood. Turn away from the world and turn to Jesus our Risen Savior. Our Only Hope and Salvation is in Jesus. Dying without Jesus is a life you will regret for all eternity. But the love of Jesus is greater than the gates of everlasting hell.
I expect the nothing less than a death penalty sentencing.
Hopefully the criminal advocate gascon doesn’t get a hold of this case. If so then the criminal will get off.
Lost my dad when I was 12 & it's a never-ending pain, stay strong fellas 🤎
Full weight of the law?? in California?? more like the FOOL wait of the law...
where’s the BLM protest at
The working class shouldn't not be treated like this! Prayers to the poor son. 🙏🏻
Justice should be swift and heavy. My deepest sympathy for the family..
It's sad that we have to share the earth and air with these scumbags.
This kid is will be blessed in the most incredible way for his Pain
Death penalty would be good in this case what y’all think ? And any case like this
Get tough on crime
I bet the killer is out on parole....leftists hate bail.  California loves crime
Thank god!!!
41 working at Taco Bell a lot of LA  Mexicans work at low-budget jobs like this
Firing squad for the suspect
God Bless the son and my condolences goes out to his whole family 🙏🏽🙏🏽🥺🕊🕊🕊
wtf? hella shootings at fast food resturants lately. rip.
Wonder why they didn't release all kinds of information of killer like they always do? 🤔
Police allegedly arrested the perpetrator but mysteriously won't release any pictures? Either that person is being protected or they didn't arrest anyone
Very sad
Burger King shooting and Taco Bell shooting how many shooting are there
🙏🙏🙏 Rest in piece sir I feel bad for his son that's F'ed up
Been years thinking it was Betty... that's crazy
Why are they not showing the shooters face or name?
I hate crime. It’s really not cool I promise
What is the description of the POS
Omg that poor baby 😭 Prayers to the family 🙏
n-word coming through haha
That's the thing... it's embarrassing for a son to display emotion to family especially the father that believes that showing emotion is a sign of weakness making you less of a man. I've looked past that and since I'm older now I told my father several times I loved him despite him not being perfect. It's awkward I'll admit but at least you'd get that out of your way to not regret not saying "I love you dad." at his final moments. I rarely speak to him now but when the time comes I won't hold regret in my heart.
Thank god they caught this DIRTY BUM man smfh 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ hope the raza takes care of him in prison enjoy prison for the rest of your life BUMMM‼️‼️‼️ RIP RAZAAAA 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Death penalty for the murderer!!!!
no wonder peeps are quitting their fast food jobs
If we just make counterfeit bills illegal, this would have never happened.
Nah bro u gotta do better ...
May he rest in the bosom of the Lord. R.I.P brother 🌹❤️❤️🇨🇦
En qué mundo vivimos...
Why does the POS even get a bail?
His poor son to be there working by him when he's gunned down. Heartbreaking. Hopefully there's some severe justice for the idiot who did this senseless crime.
The crime is so bad in LA and its a disgrace. What is wrong with their leaders? I will never vote for dems again, they let the cities across the nation become WAR ZONES and took power away from the ones keeping us safe. Solid plan dems…….next time it’ll be your family member. What then? I told you so doesn’t feel good in this scenario.
I don't know what is wrong with people in this world because this man shouldn't have been murdered at work in front of employees and his son. And on a side note I have a you tube channel type in Russell Mills May 22, 2017.
RIP
What's with all these fast food restaurant shootings these days? Things sure have calmed down under Biden.
Why is there bail in this case?  And just $2 million?!!?
Hearing what his son had to say was so heartbreaking, I'm sobbing. Coming from a Hispanic family who doesn't hug each other much or say they love each other I know what he means. I hope they keep his memory alive 💖
Any reason why they're protecting the shooter's identity?
Ayy brehh is yo name cuhh
Sad to see these senseless murder. Society must do better for itself
Just another one of Labums boys out here getting hunted. BLM would be proud. You wonder why the news don’t want to show this  criminals face. Because it doesn’t fit the agenda
Why can't they name the killer and show the public his POS face for? What are they afraid of?!
This man was blessed to have so many people love him, he obviously must have been a good hearted man.  These things will be fixed soon.
Poor kid, man. I understood him very well when he said he wishes he showed him more love.
Why not show photo of murder?
ATTN: Democrat Voters, YOU are RESPONSIBLE  for this. Your kind Defunded the Police, Freed FELONS /CONVICTS out on Streets
It's so scary how you can do everything right and lose it all because one person decided to do something wrong. Rest in peace, Alejandro Garcia. And condolences to his children, who now have to live with the consequences of this senseless action.
19 year old female cashier was killed at gunpoint in Harlem New York 2 days ago. There is senseless killing happening nationwide 😭🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Burger king now taco bell. Next Wendy’s, kfc and McDonald’s. Smh.
I mean to be 41 AND working at Taco Bell?!? That’s just truly awful! Poor mans just trying to get by. & to the son; ur dad knew u loved him. They just know when it’s so unconditional. & u wouldn’t have been able to work beside him if it WASN’T unconditional.
Rip
It's good to hear that the man who killed him has been arrested! Now it's time to get justice for Alejandro!
I swear BLM targets and preys upon everyone. Hard working Latinos and Asians are constantly being preyed upon by these people. They just caught another BLM in NY for killing the Puerto Rican girl who worked at Burger King, and another who pushed an Asian lady onto the subway tracks, where she was killed by the train. All of them BLM, all of them unapologetic!!! Wake up America
dont worry, Jon Madden will be out w/o bail in no time
Prayers for the victim family/friends this is so ridiculous and senseless. Revelation 21:3,4 John 5:28,29
Medieval punishment for these kinds of people!
THEY GET MAD FOR NOTHING, AND JUST TAKE PEOPLE LIVES, THAT'S WHY I DON'T TRUST NOBODY
My heart goes out to this young man. So heartbreaking to see him cry like that.
Where’s the picture of the suspect? Probably the cousin of the Burger King killer but BLM is no where to be found now huh?
This is so sad man .
The shooter sounds like George Floyd, Saint of Fentanyl.
BLM is extremely proud of the shooter and Gascon will grant him clemency. Watch you’ll see.
EVERYONE: " SO SAD "😢  ME: NO MUGSHOT  😤 HES BLACK TYPICAL OH BUT B.L.M  N!####$
It’s sad, his son brought up a good point…..time is short….respect your parents and spend more time with them now and show them you care about them because in the future eventually they will not be there
Now the shooter will be sentenced to a maximum security prison in CA where he will deal with occasional race riots where he and his people will be out numbered and will have to live the rest of his life wondering if he will survive another day.
RIP BOZO GO BACK TO UR COUNTRY
This is what the news told you
Where’s all the LeBron James comments, oh that’s right. The perpetrator isn’t black🤦 weirdos
Praying for this family… 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
The media is to blame for this also, why won't you give a description of the killer?  You woke fake media bent backwards for thugs.
Los Angeles.  Typical.  Thugs that can't contain their emotions.  Taking the life of something just trying to make a living.  It's like the poor girl at Crofts who was murdered in LA.
It was a takuache cuhhh
So far I’ve seen a Wendy’s, Burger King, and now a Taco Bell murder this week
😢😢😢 why they don’t show the suspect 😡
The full weight of the judicial system? What a fukkin joke!
Harris will bail him out. Then hire him for staff
WHY IS NEVER SHOWS THE CRIMINAL FACE ?
Gascon will not charge him…
Full weight of the Ca criminal justice system. Priceless. The guy will be on the streets before I’m done typing this
At least they caught the POS killer.
wonder why the shooters identity is so mysterious 🤔 😏
Why don't show the killer face
George Floyd on the loooooooooose
Rest in heaven
I think fast food restaurants have a full right to have the police on guard all day, fast food restaurants are very easy to threaten workplaces for robbers for the lack of security.
Not enough being done about the violent crimes around the country and Democrats are responsible for not condemning the violence only condoning the criminals.. this is what the Democrats want division and Decisiveness always making up Lies and covering up the Truth...
No picture of the suspect??
I don't understand how they get a bail at all why aren't they being held on a no-bail. I had a no bail warrant for a traffic violation and my traffic violations had nothing to do with an accident or somebody getting hurt
Does any know if this family has a GoFundMe?
Whats the description of the perp?
My prayers to the family. I had no idea his Son was working with him that day. So heartbreaking 💔
Heartfelt condolences to this gentleman's family. Horrific to see how people KILL other people over so little, over anything, what horrible society we became. I feel so sorry for the son who witnessed this horrendous, senseless killing of his own father. May he REST IN PEACE
Rip to Alejandro. He is just working for his family
So what he's under arrest. Gascon will free him next week on a "simple assault" or gun charge. Condolences to the family of their loss.
Dam 😔it’s sad to hear good people getting hurt 😞 mf out here wan at take the easy way on life and think they are all that and they have been through tough time but that man worked for him and his family that’s a real man right there .!!! Condolence to the family
🙏🏽🕊🙏🏽
Also LAPD is purposely not releasing the mug shot of the dude that killed him who I bet is  black cause they know this will increase racial tensions between blacks and Mexicans in L.A.
Death penalty. No need to keep trash like that alive and fed three times a day. Get rid of them.
Watch and see…The far left woke progressive District Attorney Gascon will eventually drop this down to a manslaughter as the case progresses through court.
#BlackLivesMatter
Fucker shouldnt even get Bail.
Absolutely tragic 💔💔💔
Truly sad 😞 😪🙏🏻 to all the family
It seem I should postpone my California vacation
I wouldn't be surprised if this starts a race war in L.A.....happened when I was growing in the late 90's....should happen any time soon!
I hate these lazy losers they can get guns but they can’t get a job to pay for a 10$ meal . Put them down don’t waste time with them
The News channel needs to post a link to donate to the family.
Ill pray for you and your family. Stay strong
This news makes anyone cry.
I’m so sorry.   God bless them
The perps gonna get life in jail
The perps gonna get life in jail
amerika need to bring capital funishment /death penalty for this murderer..
Justice for Alejandro! 🥺🥺
I feel ur pain man when my mom died that  was the first time and last time  I huge  her and told her I love her but they know we love them that's why we have to be good so we can see them again
A counterfeit $20. That sounds familiar. I’m glad they caught the killer before he was able to cause any more harm to other innocent families.
blm
Thank you LAPD for taking this criminal off the street . May Jesus Christ give this son and his family strength .
My heart and prayers go out tho the Son, Wife, Mother and his family and friends. May he Rest In Peace🕊🕊🕊. On the other hand, I hope the monster that killed the worker, rots in jail and suffers and that the inmates beat the living hell out of him.
Is not that serious is just a 🌮 🔔 fake food. RIP Alejandro Garcia
God speed.
It’s ok that the customer used a fake $20 bill, he could do that because George Floyd did the same.
secand  Incident involving an african american killing a hispanic where is BLM where is the black communtity  Addressing this  Issue if it was the other way around they would be crying up a storm
Burger King 19 year old shot, and now Taco Bell too?!  Jesus have mercy, Jesus we need you more than ever, I pray for this family to find comfort and healing in Jesus 🙏
Why didn't they tell us the name of the criminal and show a pic of the POS? i know they have all the information already!
Why 2 million dollar bail. How about held without bail. What kind of tard is that?
How did he support his family on taco bell wages?
I'm so sorry and may the killer burn 🔥 in hell!
may god bless there family
If we can all join hands and agree that it’s the white racist fault because everything is the white man’s fault ! Don’t blame it on the black man because only Black Lives Matter
2 millon dollar bail??? why not just set it as no bail.... what a tragedy..i feel bad for the family keep your head up lil man till the day u 2 will meet again....
Wow, too many tragedies. The world is sick. We need an awakening of peace and order.
This is truly sad he witnessed his dad's death! Lord may have many blessings for this child in his way in the name of Jesus i pray
Wow, hope they give him life.
This is not right.  So sad.
Tragic. I pray for the family. May they be comforted. To be killed over a taco. I hope this perp never sees the light of day. The son was correct. Show your loved ones you care and tell them you love them often. 🙏🏻❤️✝️
I understand his pain due being latino. A lot of latino men don’t show emotion like that
Break my heart... 1:25
Meanwhile kids in Chicago, Baltimore, and NY want food stamps and stipends to stay home schooled and be lazy to avoid COVID. This man gets shot for doing his job working at a place those brats would never do. RIP
I hate guns
This is what happens when everyone in America who has a temper has a gun.
Why don't you named the culprit am sure is another BLM protegee.
A innocent humanbeing, snuffed out by a worthless thug. My condolences to the family.
Sad. Apparently they caught the suspect who is named Jonathan Madden-For sure he was a white supremacist. Er, wait actually I was looking at the wrong article. This guy is black. Wow, so not a white supremacist. Man, what are the lefties gonna say about this one?
jonathan madden is a BUM
Stop voting demoncrat.  They're to blame for every murder!!  Stupid policies, creating a criminals paradise! RIP  to this WORKING MAN
Hmmm I wonder what color the killer was.
They don't show the shooters face because he is a race you can't talk about..... Anyone else and it's obvious
So glad they caught the guy.    I hope he goes into general population in prison and his life becomes a living nightmare
Is there a go fund me I want to donate to the family my condolences to the boy and family may God heal him and give all his family strength 💐🙏🏽🕊
No description so let me guess the shooter was of the melanin variety huh
Omg that poor poor boy 💔
I’m sorry this kid loses him father.

Hey, son, your dad loved you and now he is your guardian angel 😇.
Oh lord. Painful to see this.
Law enforcement please slap his wrist firmly before you release him
Ruining America
That’s just dirty
Im so sorry for your loss  Dios lo tiene en su santa gloria
Black Lives Matter, though, right?
Senseless!
I wish we could bring back chain gangs and expedited public executions. Killing someone over the worst tacos available deserves a public spectacle. There's a community out there that really needs to put themselves on check and like soon because we are all not buying it anymore.
Death PENALTY  only
May GOD bless his soul and helps his family!
RIP
My deepest condolences 😢    very heartbreaking 💔
Yes!
🙏 & Justice For The Family
I can barley watch the video!! My heart goes out to the family. What a tragedy! Oh what a tragedy… there are no words to describe such a senseless crime to the highest degree!!🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
The fact that there even is a bail for the shooter, no matter how high, is ridiculous. He took a life without mercy so why should he get any?!
The LAPD South Bureau Homicide Division, investigators identified Jonathan Madden, a male, Black, 39-years-old, of Los Angeles, as the individual responsible for the murder of Garcia-Galicia.
Sorry for the lost everything’s I see here hurt me a lot
im so sorry for your loss. may he rest in peace.
No pictures of the shooter?
I’m sorry Mijo 😞
Good! Throw away the key!
How demonic do you got to be to murder someone over a taco bell meal?
*This will continue until Taco Bell brings back the Double Decker Taco*
The shooter is probably of a certain race that rhymes with jack
Does everyone see the one common denominator? Younger generations,  what happen to good parenting? They have no character or morals..
No murderer with witnesses should ever receive bail. The father really sounded like a terrific guy.
Blessing to the family and friends.  Very sad. 🙏😪
Why not show the suspect??? Hmmm let me guess
I thought California is a Safe place to visit.
The scum bag that murder this honest hard working man should be fed to the wolf's he deserves no sympathy.
My goodness.  Wish people would stop  this killing ..
Let’s be really clear.  When we catch them, and there is irrefutable proof that we caught the right criminal, as soon as the trial is over, the criminal goes directly to the gallows.  Not prison.  Not an endless stream of appeals.  Directly to the gallows.  Let the criminal say good bye to their family with the noose in place.  Then pull the lever.
This is so awful… just awful… I so sorry for their loss….I hope the shooter gets the chair or death penalty.
B to the L to the M. ra ra ra
😭
Hell awaits the heartless killer. No one should EVER take the life of some one else unless it is in self defense. So senseless!
The *SCARY* part is that  this  guy  is *39* & reacted the way he did...
All drive thru window should be bulletproof
Please, don't wait until they are gone to realize, as you should see, it will be painful if you have any love. You may have parents on edge with one another, when you are behind the scenes with either one, show that one the love...when you show love, give (tight) hugs, and speak of care, it cost nothing, yet is priceless. The body's response to positivity heals positively, both physically and mentally. Please SHOW LOVE, while they are above ground.
Omg. Prayers for strength
"the day that it happened, that was the only hug I ever gave him"
See if I care... The murder rate is  much worse in Tijuana, Mexico..and,that's just across the street from FN,San Diego, California!! Welcome to America!!!
So sad! My condolences to his family and friends. 😪🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
This is almost too much heartbreak to stand. A hardworking man doing the right thing killed by a lowlife do nothing, let us pray that California comes to the realization their policies of catch and release are destroying families and innocent lives
Hmmm no look at the shooter? Oh, BLM member so the news doesn’t want to show it.
✨R.I . P ✨Garcia ❤️💕u are loved 🙏🏿
He lost his life for 20 dollars 🤦‍♀️
He killed that man over $20????……wtf
Man sad 😔 my condolences 🙏
Now tried to keep the bad guy in jail. If not you can take their place. Because this is getting old. It happens every day. Sorry I cannot cry no more. Fresh out of Tears.
Lol 2 million
Didn’t know his son worked with him. That must be very traumatizing and I hope the shooter fits in prison. I wish this family to recover from this experience and remember their father as a good man
My condolences.   Revelation 21: 3, 4
The slain father gives me the impression of a guy that WORKED his way to SOME form of FINANCIAL stability. Im sorry for his loss.
When I heard this crime took place me being a black person and knowing  my people this is a black crime now that I heard his name I don’t even have to see the color of his skin I know it’s a black person my people stop it
Dude, my dad left me when i was 11, so yeah life is not what you want
So SAD😭😭😭🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️
My heart breaks for this family .
This people working on fast food Restaurants need to Stop Defending there 💩 like they the owner! I'm sorry but I'm not getting shot of yelled at for a chicken nugget sauce or a Taco! RIP Alejandro
I blame all democrat politicians for this and all who support them.
To damn much violence, what else can I say .  Again and again, a good man and dad is dead for nonsense reason.  Rest in peace to a good man and father 🌺💐🌺💐🌺
Guns should be taken away from people like that
All over dinner tacos. People are so crazy. taco Bell, no where to support
People killing people for the meagerous things so stupid.
Ugh we are tired of the guns I hate guns no more gun violence stop murdering people like they heartless or something always have to take away our loved ones the shooter is so evil
Why… why would someone do this for $20… ? senseless.
Too many degenerate criminals walking around with no respect for life.  These people should never be released and they should spend the rest of their days in a prison cell.  Time to kick out every politician who voted for catch and release for multiple offenses.
Moral of the story is don't work as a fast food restaurant cashier
Why are you hiding the killer's photo?  Show his face so other potential victims can identify him.
No pic of the murdering thug... I think we all know why. "Swift justice" would be releasing the pos...at night...in a remote area...and letting the victim's family know when n where.
I will take your wise words brother. My condolences  🙏🏾
Prisons are getting packed let's start using the electric chair
Truly disgusting, hard working man killed while trying to provide for his family.
"white supremacy" is NOT the problem in this country Biden you turd
no pics of the shooter?? black
Damn that really hit home. I barely speak to my dad but love him so much. I’m sorry bro. Keep grinding take care of your people bro😢😢
So sad hard working man making honest living to support family stolen from our prayers are with you and the family…🙏
Better send this one to feds so gascone doesnt give 6month probation
Our hearts go out to you and your family
That damn scum bag, man. I really hope karma teaches him the horrors that he's sowed. It's childish and ridiculous that they did that.
Well, no mug shot.  Tells you everything you need to know about the thug.
Why have they not mentioned the pervs name...must be an illegal
Change bail reform
Just another day in the sh…ole that is LA. It’s no place for decent people.
No mugshot of the POS that did this?
That speaks volumes about Mr. Garcia's character as a man for his son to say he wants to be just like him as a father to his own kids. You don't hear young people say things like that nowadays about their parents hardly anymore. They usually want to be like entertainers and athletes. This man lived right and I have the utmost respect for men like him who do right by their loved ones and especially their children. That animal didn't have to take this man's life over a measly counterfeit $20. I hope he never sees the free world again....free society doesn't have any use for individuals like him.
Hate crime
This is so heartbreaking,  it's about time these fast food places have security after hours to protect their workers,  employers are expected to sight cash for counterfeit but when confronting the customer the situation could turn deadly. In this case it did,  $20 is not worth losing a life  over,  taco bell pay shouldn't expect their employers to put this life in line for a fake $20.
Just absolutely horrific..
People are trash nowadays
If it was Pedro in FL he deserved it. He wasnt 40 though
FINISH THE WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am so happy they caught  him. I was in tears. Angry and sad.
No picture of the perp?
This is so sad
The son & father was working together at the same Taco Bell . That’s a hard working family
Shoulda just gave him the dam extra sauce yall being too stingy sometimes
🙏🙏
Son broke my heart
Show the murderers picture,may the dad R.I.P  sad that even at work you're not safe
Condolences 💐 so sad  and they worked together sad sad
$2M bail?   Thats more than #CapitolRioters .. with 100 law enforcement hurt and 5 people died!!!!   America has to stop saving #White men, stop saving gun users, & prosecute every criminal
Who kille somebody working fast food, because you cant afford it?
What does the perp look like?
God bless the family, especially the son and mother.
Im glad the police caught that scumbag!!!
I hope there's payback waiting for him in the county jail n also when he reaches the big house
Whats the suspect look like? Why didn't you show who he or she was?   I'm angry even though it's not my father I lost, I couldn't fathom how hurt his family is over his death.
All you humans are useless , all these crying to your corners and you can’t do jack but let criminals continue to leech off you.  When are you ever going to learn?
Sad changes nothing, start eliminating the bad seeds of the society.
No point crying, praying, no action means more loss is coming
Start executing criminals, why show mercy to someone who doesn’t
Another George floyd again huh. With fake money again. Huh. I guess these George floyd out here havent learn their lesson.
I feel sick.... wth is going on in this world? violence is so much worse now enough is enough omg my heart😔💔😭😡
Smh prayers for garcia lord have mercy. Feel bad for his son
Such a professional, compassionate police chief
What does the shooter look like?
Very sad.  We are living in Biden's America.  It's getting worse by the day.
👍 Great job on arrests. Now, go arrest the thieves committing FEDERAL CRIMES ON THE TRACKS. LET'S GO BRANDON PHUCK GASCON
Dude could have drove away
Told ya ,matter of time
Start empowering law enforcement to combat this lawlessness. There are consequences to poor decisions.
Quit referring to the POS shooter as a man since he's obviously not.
Why are they not showing the murderers face??
He shouldn’t get any bail at all.
Show the scumbags face
It really hurts me because you can never get them back. 😢
My deepest condolence to his family an🙏  😢  Sad horrible rest in peace.
All over a 20 dollar counterfeit Bill, some people are way beyond stupid.
So sad. I hope his son doesn’t carry that guilt with him. His dad knows his loves him, and that hug you have him that day, meant the world to him. 🥲 And to have to watch him be murdered just terrible. 🙏🏼🙏🏼 praying for you, and your family.
Is his name really John Madden?
Not even worth working at these poison factories for some petty wage.
Good!! Put that loser away forever!
We need to start tying these criminals to wooden posts and beat ‘em with rocks till they stop breathing. They’re getting too comfortable out here
I don't know how many times I have to say this but our justice system is too soft on crime because some people cry and complain when criminals get shot, killed or beaten. O well who cares criminals like this deserve only the most H3llish of punishments and daily beatings in jail. If jails are too full or cost too much start executing  the highest offenders... this snowflake justice won't get you anywhere it won't end crime...
So much hate in the world😔may Mr Garcia RIP and watch over ur family especially ur son... I hope the DA will prosecute that POS 💩 and not give any bond...Mr Garcia needs justice ⚖️
It’s not worth it your life is more than $20
That's messed up. Lowest of the human population killing for a fake $20 bill!
So sad
No picture of the suspect.
Carlos he knows you love him !!!! He knows
I'm sorry for your loss bro..your love and your father's love will still grow and live on.
We need the death penalty! These people kill and get a free bunk and 3 meals a day. Bring the death penalty and go through with it ! My thoughts and prayers go out to this family.
So sad
Shooter should be sentenced to 24/7 drive through duty at Taco Bell for life and customers are allowed to throw their tacos/drinks at him if they want.
Life in soildtary confinement
Fund mental health and have systems applied where people like this are either treated or put away before anything bad happens.
Unforgivable. $20.
Your Dad knew you loved him young man. Your message is very well received, I'm so sorry for your loss. 🙏🙏🙏
No bail WTF 🤬
Lord Jesus Christ prayers for the family amen 🙏🏼
😥😥😥😥😥🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Need to remove GASGONE ASAP, too soft on crime, let's get him out, NOW.
Esto esta fuera de control aquí en los Angeles da miedo salir primero por el covid pero ahorita por los robos y asaltos por donde sea ,Parece que estamos en otro país no en USA donde vamos a llegar a andar armados y defenderse uno mismo? Qué horror pasó este jovencitio de de ver cómo asesinaron a su Papá un trauma de por vida,Qué Diocito se ampare de nosotros y le de aunque sea un poquito de consuelo a este muchacho porque lo qué pasó es demasiado doloroso qué Dios lo bendiga por siempre y le de paz a su alma
Low lives, man!  Those people should be executed immediately.
😭😭😭😭😭
BLM will get upset over this fact... but, I could care less about them, yes Jonathan Madden is a 39 year old identified black male coward located and arrested in his home in South Los Angeles! I don't care what race or color he is... anyone committing such vile acts should be exposed... regardless of race or ethnicity!
2 million dollars bail! Yep he staying in prison forever getting free sausage for life... Don't drop the soap homie 😁😁😁😁
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Picture of the killer?
Fast food need security glass and doors.
Is there such a thing as sensefull violence.
🌹🕊💫👌🏿
Stop coddling criminals in & out of prison & just maybe crime will slow down.
Where is the creeps picture that did this horrible killing. The police should plaster his face all over America. The family should demand it. Take our country back!!!!!! From these cowards.
So sad for the family, sure God gave him a new calling.
I wish they would show the shooter
I feel for the son, me and my pops didn't express emotions until I turned 25. We might not have expressed them but I knew he loved me and he knew it too. Stay strong bud. RIP.
That greaseball gonna try to pay his bail in counterfeit $20s.
This innocent, hardworking, responsible family man was shot and killed just for refusing to accept a counterfeit $20 he was just doing his job...unreal!😢💔😡
Good job FBI!  My heart goes out to the family of this person.
Killers need to be tortured in prison or death penalty it's getting worse everywhere!!!!!😤👊
This is so sad Godbless his soul Rip my Brother🙏❤️
Who is the suspect? Why is the media protecting his identity?
I’m glad they got they killer. I don’t want to hear about bail or nothing like that. He needs life or the death penalty. This is sick and disgusting. And what is Taco Bell going to do about this? They need to pay for all the funeral arrangements. He shouldn’t have ANY bail. None.
Fake news NBC Cowards
NBC is fake news cowards
NBC is fake news too cowards
My condolences to the family 🙏
We need to stop a lot of LA criminals search the cars for guns throw ‘‘em in jail
Condolences to you stay strong you going to get justice
Why the killers name have to be john madden
God Bless this family it’s to sad 😢
Thank you 🙏 Officers for all your work
Fricking evil pos. People with guns playing God over arguments. these people should not be allowed a gun. Anyone that gets in an argument with you and owns a gun and threaten you with it report them to the Authorities these people play God with guns and try to control you with them. Rest in peace Unreal.
Let's give this Hungr......Y COWARD life in pri.   SoN! LA DETECTIVES I'm sure the coward has done something like that in the past. We might resolve other cases....
Why are you hiding the killer’s face?
I am so sorry for your family.  For the son who held his dying father.  The loss of a life over a $20 bill.
Thank God they found the guy! And a son had a change of heart! May his memory be for a blessing and may the Comforter surround his family and friends. Amen.
I bet u it's a jogger
May he rest in peace condolence to the family🙏❤💐
aLl CoPs ArE bAd
Same.. a Burger King woman in NY, just working, along with others, shot to death like a dog. I don't know what America is becoming
My thoughts and prayers are with this young man and the family. 🙏🏽⚘🙏🏽
To all those, suggesting, that the police, would not release the suspect description, because he was black....... ...you got it wrong,again, you"race card" extreme right morons
And that full weight of the law will turn him loose
😔😔
RIP “That was the only hug I ever gave him” We need to stop this cycle of emotional neglect with our kids. Parents please show love to your kids, help them not punish them.
Our most sincerest condolences to the family....                                   ⚘⚘🦅⚘⚘
So heart breaking🙏😥
lol the only swift justice is for the kid to avenge his dad by killing the murderer.
Terrible, RIP, however the coverage is lacking
I never saw a gun in a rock n roll video till I saw rap and hip hop clowns in circus.
Every day I see nothing but 👉🏼💩💩💩💩 crash dummies doing all the killing… speaking facts 🦾🦾
I guess he should just accepted the counterfeit 20$ bill its not like Toco Bell would have gone broke
Its a good thing they let out the prisons in the summer of 2020. Its done alot of good
Is the guy Johnathan Madden blk or whte ?? I may hve seen a photo of him and he honestly looked like a biracial type . Had fair skin but kinda blk features . . Was likely racist & hostile towards us Latinos on a regular basis , as a lot of ppl in this country are . I'm sure that wasn't his first negative encounter w a Hispanic person .
Death penalty
He really killed someone over less than 20 dollars, how does a person become like that?
😭😭😭
Swift Justice.  Thanks law enforcement for a quick arrest. Its gotta be painful losing someone like that.   God rest his soul
I just hope that guy goes to jail for life that's a disgrace to be killing somebody while they're at work and their son seeing their father die
I just hope that guy goes to jail for life that's a disgrace to be killing somebody while they're at work and their son seeing their father die
You guys and your guns!
Im personally send the guy a message once he gets into his jail cell....i hope thats his name but im go ask for copy of the video so im 100% thats the guy....This is what i do professionally
The killer probably out on $5000 bail  and walk the streets by the 2-3 days
A DEATH FOR A DEATH , this was SENSELESS KILLING a PHONY $20 he stood up for not taking PHONY MONEY and lose his life  . So the KILLER should lose his life.
WTF is wrong with this black dude trying to use a counterfeit like Georgia Floyd?
Forgiveness
I haven’t seen my dad in 14 years and he lives 3 hours away….. Lucky to have an active father that’s for sure such a sad lost
Heartbreaking. Gavin Newsom will want to personally finance a statue to honor the murderer.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Rip to the father
So he was black?
Was this guy watching Terminator-Rise of the Machines before shooting the Taco Bell employee? That's a serious question.
America in decline.😑
This is so sad. Amazing parent. He left a legacy.
that poor kid man......
There should be no bail psycho should never be free on the streets 😡
Happy they caught the scumbag responsible for this horrific crime. God bless him, his family, and the local community.
I’m glad they found him . Jail him for life
Show the killers face
Over 20 bucks
Shooter should get the death penalty.
The same criminal will consider a job at Taco Bell beneath them but will try to rob the establishment.
Once they stop putting tomatoes and green onions on the nacho Bell grande they no longer became valuable enough to kill
This has to be used in the marketing department showing how good Taco Bell food really is
How can they didn’t show the killer.
Poor man, working hard to provide for his family, and some ignorant thug decides to exterminate him & destroy his family.
😪
THESE HEROES MAKE VICTORY POSSIBLE,  GOD BLESS YOU ALL MAN AND WOMEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT!💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗🙏💗🙏💗🙏💗🙏💗🙏💗🙏💗🙏💗🙏💗🙏💗🙏💗🙏
Over $20 dollars what a piece of sh*t. Hope he rots in hell. Took someone’s life over nothing. When I was 25 got a job and seen one of my co worker struggle help him paid for lunch when he couldn’t. You’re 29 years old expecting people to give you free stuff and took their life when their just doing their job to make ends meet? Nerve of the people nowadays…..
Rip 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

THANK GOD!! ALSO ARRESTED ANIMAL WHO SHOT YOUNG LADY KILLED IN BURGER KING IN HARLEM NY !!! THANK GOD  !!!
This is advice to everyone working serving the public, if a person pays with a fake 20 just take it, that person probably hungry. The corporation will be running tomorrow but your life is not promised.
Throwing your life away over taco bell, that's nice... people are really disconnected from real life.
That’s so sad I feel so bad for his son and all of his family . 🙏🏻
This so so sad and heartbreaking, especially his son to witness his fathers death. It was so sad to hear he has given his first and last hug to his Dad, RIP. 🙏🏻
What did you shooting get you? Nothing! Absolutely nothing. These mindless heartless monsters...  My deepest condolences to the family and love ones.
I'm so sad about this.
How are people like this allowed to walk the streets freely? I bet this is definitely not the suspects first crime.
The 2A celebrates its new year like those old years, a new number in different tune! Live in a Rep state,  learn the same old thing again.
I'm sorry for your loss 💔
Hard workers and rappers are a constant target... Stay safe all
Bail should not exist that shows all the world cares about is some quick cash...smh
RIP, God comfort this family.
Bet it was a white supremacist judging by how quickly they reveal his face and ethnicity here.
Just saw the mugshot of the scumbag killer. Not surprised at all.
Shooter was a BLM
thank your local politicians.....look and read ....
this hurts
All these for less than $20…
The son speaking about not hugging his father until his death made me cry... 😢
Notice how they didnt say 'black male' shot him, which is what happened?  NBC is so Woke that they didnt even show a picture of the black man that shot him.    You are supposed to think its a white man that shot him, that blacks are the victims.  Thats the narrative and showing Anthony Madden's pic would go against that narrative.   FU NBC.
Great
So sad God have mercy💔😥🙏😔
George Gascon will just let the killer walk scott free
Why does he even gets bail.  That's so stupid.
Well who’s the criminal? I’m pretty sure we all want to see who this imbecile is.
Wheres the Go Fund me account for this deserving family my heart goes out to thrm they worked hard for Taco Bell we should Al donate to this family rest in peace❤️
Why would you even bail a murder thats why i love my society were i stay police is called later after to take the fukin body if not burnt with tyrescos there is no need for him to be alive too
Man when his son is talking about him 😢. My thoughts and prayers are with him and the rest of Alejandro’s family and friends.
Completely senseless; I hope this human garbage get the death penalty, but then this is California, death penalty is pretty much just an empty phrase.
Like bruh wtf. Like Just WHY ? Why bro ?
1:19 is it just me or is the guy hugging the son of the victim fake crying??
trying so hard to hide this N's face. RIP brother.
Why no picture of shooter? Oh must be a minority who would be future rocket scientist or football player.
Just hand that kid a bottle of salt and a strip of sandpaper while those in charge turn their heads and a lesson will be learned that no prison sentence could dish out
Whoa i wanna see what the suspect looks like where is the pic ?
Never defend a business, not even your own, it's not worth it.
Demonrats are loving these casualties..just part of the plandemic..
Dam that's a hard one. Over 20 dollars.... Smh 😔
Suspect real motive was to kill not to pay for food stay woke
I think as his son I would pay commissary to everyone in his block to make his stay as miserable as possible, to remind him each day why he is there and give him no peace.
All murderers need to be hung publicly. Then used as target practice for cpl holders.
Honestly if I were a a judge… it would be his life. Take someone’s then pay the price
Raza needs to start hunting joggers Llantas don't like us. We need to pop them all.
Blacks ain’t the only ones dying we Latinos have it hard too  Latinos lives matter !!  Rest easy hard working Latino dad 🙏🏽
Am heartbroken for this family.  But let’s be honest….look up Jonathan Madden. All I can say…I will never ever trust these people again, you bet I’ll look every time they are around. The trust is gone. I supported BLM I supported George Floyd….no more. These ppl are animals and don’t deserve anything anymore. Dr King is looking down in utter disgust.  NO TRUST NO PEACE!!!!
Nuts country where Taco Bell employees get killed and someone is willing to go to jail to avoid paying for a taco
I'm so sorry Carlos!!! My heart is with you love
Let me guess the shooter is some rock that came to life?
wheres the perps mugshot?
I work in customer service every day I go in a grocery store I'm always watching my anxiety level has been higher lately you never know when something's going to jump off. The companies don't have anything in training to tell the employees never get into an altercation. The companies make the employee feel that they own the business. And the people who work for the business protects it even if it causes in their life to hell with that. I avoid all confrontation I do not get in confrontation if someone wants that behavior they will be standing there by themselves. May he rest in peace. But it's not worth it.
Unfortunately Gascon and Kamila Harris like to release criminals. Moore also needs to resign
I use to live near that taco bell and there was lots or loitering people would hang out by the tables and parking lot to drink alcohol and smoke ...
This is heartbreaking 💔.  Rip 🙏 🕊 young man. Prayers for your son family and friends 🙏 💙
This is America
Wth? All over fake money smh
Is it bad if we make a law that, if you intentionally kill someone, that the family can kill you too either through torture or fast kill.. just wondering
Sweet taco bell got free advertising
Burn Loot Murder
He should be held without bail. He killed a man because he didn't want to pay for his tacos. Time for all murders to receive the death penalty.
These punks. How u gone b mad because someone call u on fake money. Even if it wasn't, only a heartless coward would do that. Hope he never gets out of prison
Hate to see this kinda stuff… heartbreaking.
Sooo why are they hiding the gunman? Oh yah he's a young black man in California.
🙏🏽
Sending the best prayers for this employee 🤲🤲
1:23 this is the problem with a lot of younger people especially men these days, they never tell their parents they love them or show them affection, but they can do it with girls for some reason...i bet dude has a girlfriend that he hugs and tells he loves all the time...but he could never do it for his dad until hes dying? smh
110 year to this murder we want see same punishment for criminal
Is blm gonna burn down the taco bell like they did to the wendys?
🤎🤎🤎
They need to show who the shooter is why are we hiding the criminal? I’m sick of this
THIS IS THE EPITOME OF PRO CRIME POLICIES IN LA. We must get justice for this man!
Where is Derek chauvin when you need him?
What is dog s***. Who shoots a poor guy working at Taco Bell
Good job LAPD.
To the Garcia family - We see your tremendous pain at losing your loved one. He must have been a wonderful man and father. In the arms of the angels may he find peace and may you find comfort in your loving memories.
Senseless
My Condolences to the family. To the son please try to stay strong. So very very sorry.
The result of liberal and progressive and Democrat.
Your dad did good. He was  showing you how to become a working, responsible, young man. He is proud of you! Noone should EVER witness something as horrible as this! My condolences to the family.
Death penalty to shooter
Blessings and prayers 🙏
This is so heartbreaking 💔
The sad part is when his son said he never really hugged his dad and said I love you  till he was dying that is messed up,that's why I hug and kiss my kids everyday all day and tell them I love them hell I hug and kiss them more then I hug and kiss their mom
*†*
They will give the full force of the law and let him go today, after all he was just hungry and just had Monopoly money.
Prayers and condolences for the young man and his family. Just senseless shootings, take the wheel Jesus, we can’t do this without you🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
It is just not worth it. We need to work from home. We need better gun control l.
😔 💔 my condolences to the family. 🙏🏾 🕯🕊
I’m sorry for your loss. When the son spoke broke my heart. Our dad was killed too. It’s a very traumatic thing to live with. You will be a great dad someday and know he’s in heaven looking down! Thank you Leo’s for catching the pos!
So sad. My condolences to the family. Young man, without words your father knew you loved him, so please don't feel guilty about that, EVER! Your actions told him everything. My condolences to you and your family. Because of him you are going to be a GREAT father. Just like him! Sending prayers to you and your love ones during this difficult time. Stay strong.
Good job blm group for defending criminals,us Latinos actually work and not live in section 8
May you REST IN PEACE, Mr. Garcia...⚘... Prayers and Condolences to ALL who know and LOVE you, and mourn your passing...💕⚘💕
You're a special kind of fuked up when you actively take advantage of working class folks trying to earn a living.   Hopefully justice is swift and the family can find some resolve.
RIP,So sad.
I feel so sad for their family after seeing this on the news. It just brings me to tears.
God bless you and your family
Heart broken 💔🙏😢 man 💔..  People are so evil. Criminals when they going to stop hurting people we work do hard heart hurts for the family 😢💔 hard working people man..
I’m sorry for your loss. When the son spoke broke my heart. Our dad was killed too. It’s a very traumatic thing to live with. You will be a great dad someday and know he’s in heaven looking down! Thank you Leo’s for catching the pos!
The LAPD South Bureau Homicide Division, investigators identified Jonathan Madden, a black male, 39-years-old, of Los Angeles, as the individual responsible for the murder of Garcia-Galicia.
too many cowards with guns
“The shooter”?  More like the cold blooded murderer!!
🙏
put his picture and real name.
Heartbreaking
Glad the evil scumbag got caught. It would do it again.
Johnathan Madden 🤔… 🧑🏿‍🦲
YOUR FATHER WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE  ..BENDICIONES!
LO SIENTO POR LA MUERTE DE TU PAPA...QUE PAZ DESCANSE..BENDICIONES HACIA LA FAMILIA!
Taco Bell needs to step up and help this family
More losers passing off counterfeit $20's, why does society put up with these gutter people? Condolences to the Garcia family.
So sad  sorry for ur loss 😢💔
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR LOSS
even when we just workin trying to live a straight life they gun us down
Just depressing.
Sad
Where's the convict's picture?
Awesome. Good job, lapd. If the suspect had indeed tried to pass counterfeit money, request for assistance from the secret service. Lock the suspect tight that he has no way to maneuver and goes to prison.
whats happening to america😳
No photo of the shooter? 🤔
Joggers targeting Asians and Hispanics
The man was literally working just trying to take care of the shift and go home. But gets shot. Wow sad pathetic excuse of a human to do that. I hope there is another life where justice is promptly served
"Taco Bell Shooting".  Only in america will you ever see those three words together.  What a joke
Let me guess he’s very dark skinned. As usual.
the black man fulfilling its stereotype once again. blm clown.
A George Floyd $20
I just watched this video I am so sorry to hear about your loss.  My heart sank when the son started talking.  I hope they keep the pos in prison not on 2 million dollars bail.  I would give him a life sentence of no parole or death.  Stay strong and I hope your fam  I’llly is ok
It's mandatory to make all glass windows like bank windows bulletproof!
God say's forgive no!!!. I'm sorry I don't forgive murderers.
Good,thank you God for his capture.
🏃🏿
We truly are "...for the land of the free, and the home of the dead." We gotta get rid of the guns!
Jesus...this is sad. Hey kid...he knew you loved him. Now make him proud
Mankind: God’s biggest failure
🙏ONLY WHAT WE DO FOR JESUS CHRIST WILL LAST
Shooter had a car but couldn't afford a taco LOL
damn there has been so many fast food employees getting killed =( so senseless
🌹💐🌹💐🌹
Don't worry the Soros backed DA will have the murder out insight years.
We want to know the identification of the criminal
I’m glad they caught him and proud of the lapd doing there job
No description  or pic of the shooter?....I wonder why
Free guns killed people
Hope people.donates money To familys
PRAYS. FOR FAMILY 🙏👏
Poor Carlos. Prayers for you and your Family. May your Father Rest In Peace. How horrible.
Good job 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Descanse en Paz 🙏
Where is Taco Bell in all this. It would be nice to see taco bell help them out a little.
No pic of the perp?
What’s the matter they don’t have a picture of the animal they killed him I’m gonna guess
Good luck with getting justice nowadays...
i am pretty sure the killer was a church boy
Just a bunch of gutless goons running the streets with guns🤦‍♂️ Their day will come. What goes around comes around.
Diana Ross just put out a new song and one of the lyrics is"why do we love to hate so much". People are eager to kill over nothing,it's tragic and i don't understand why we care so little about life,even our own cause the shooter just threw his life away over nothing.
As usual, a black male was arrested for this murder. As usual, the media hide the race of the shooter. I'm sure the DA will do everything possible to get the thug acquitted!
Absolutely sickening.  Great job Democrats!
WHAT DONT YALL UNDERSTAND THEY DONT GIVE AF THAT Y HE HAS AN BAIL
F:ck whoever shot the man. I have a lot of anger for him. Im very glad they found him, he needs 50 years in prison minimum. Losing a father is the hardest thing in life when he's always there for you and works hard for the family. That guy either didnt have a father or he was a piece of doodoo too.  Prayers for the family.  The world is a mess. I dont believe in money or working but i wouldnt kill an innocent for it.  Go to the government and fight them instead (no shooting either) . Guns are for protection not for fun
So wrong
awe , very sad
It needs to be mandatory to show the face of these scum criminals. Post all their socials so we can know who they are. We sick of these low lives. Do your job news reporters…
So sad. Prayers to this family. God help us!
Time to start hanging the innocent immediate families of these criminals.  And then let the criminal spend life in jail.
Let's go brandon
Newscum puts a halt on the death penalty and Gascon won't file special circumstances. If you vote for those pigs you'll reap what you sow.
Employers should stop asking employees to verify money look what happened! That poor dad and he’s son saw everything omg!
hummm another fake 20 $ that result in violence and death .
Death penalty
The shooter shouldn't even get to have bail. I hope the shooter gets life without parole. May your father rest in peace.
I hope that there is justice for this guy.  He was a working guy who was just providing for his family.  Loser deserves max punishment, nothing less.
A good person earning real money killed by scumbag using fake money.
If we ALL came from TWO people,  how can we ALL not be related in someway! ! !  This is craziness!!  We can be there for one another if we just TRY!
Where's the picture of the shooter?
So sad
You don’t want police but when devils come for your loved ones we look to our  protectors in uniform
Good job officers
I’m waiting for Commula-ha-ha-ha Harris to post his bail like she helped bail out others arrested for their crimes!
No image of the shooter? Must be a sun person.
Such a sweet son, brought tears to my eyes.  Such a humble father and son.  Great that so many donated to the families GoFundMe account.  Sure the money will not bring their husband and father back but it does help them financially.
That's so sad😭🙏🏻
Let's all pray for this young lad so he can gain the strength to get over this  terrible loss.
Accept Jesus as your lord and saviour and be saved in Jesus name amen hallelujah praise the lord ✝️✝️✝️ repent Jesus is coming from new Zealand island s 🌍❤️
Getting killed at work..ppl working hard during covid19 ...😔
What is Taco Bell corporate going to do?  It happened at their store while he was on the clock.  They owe his family a lot. He gave his life for Taco Bell.
My condolences 💐 to his son and family !!!! Rip
Gascon will stand in the way of justice
Sounds like George Floyd case, except the wrong person died here
The jackass threw away his life because he couldn’t pay for his $20 meal 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
Greenlight on Madden!
They better lock up that suspect b4 Garcia's big family gets to him.    R.I.P Senor. 😔🙏🏻
Should just hang people like this for 30mins then drag their lifeless body through town to show murderers what their future holds when caught.  Sadly people believe people like this can be saved or rehabilitated....BS save taxpayers money for schools and better educate future generations.
God Bless this family at this time
My god. H heart breaks for this son such a senseless crime I’m tired of this everyday more then a handful of these same crimes my goodness. The poor son.
This world has gone crazy.
rip condolences to the family
My god, this is heartbreaking! Im sorry for this great loss! I am happy that the killer has been arrested!
My condolences to the family this is so sad.😢
Heartbreaking to hear this teenaged son speak; an awful, senseless loss of a good man. Sorrow and sadness for this family and community.  Peace.
a bail for taking a life? owkay
And this is how racists are born. Congrats dudes….😞
Wht supreme again!
It's really sad how dangerous it is outside of your house
Killed over a fake $20 bill damn coward
Glade he was arrested but it will not bring him back praying for the family and his son that’s was there he is going to be traumatized
Thats awful
That's some fuxk up 💩. MF's needs to stop the BS.
May the most high do favor for this family.  Very senseless and tragic. I will have this family in my prayers.
SHOW THE CRIMS FACE ?  SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS NEEDS DEATH PENALTY . COWARD ACT.
I heard the D.A. already let him out on a cashless bail.
So fn terrible. A family working hard together, toiling away at a minimum wage establishment and not being able to verbalize their love for each other before the senseless murder. The whole scenario is just heartbreaking.
That is a very sad wvent
You hope so but really it's not up to the police. It's the increasingly lax judicial system that will flip the family and community off
Im   sO    SOOO   GLAD....THEY   FOUND   THE   KILLER JUSTICE   WILL BE   SERVED
🙏 😞
They did get free taco bell for life ?
Death penalty or Reclusion Perpetua for him
That's why I eat at McDonald's
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Just another day in America.
Wouldn't be surprised if this kid turned into a real life Punisher
Life in prision,   as an exemplo for  the others criminals....
Makes me remember the daddy carrying his daughters birthday cake into Chuckee Cheese but was shot and killed before he got inside. People need to think damn hard before shooting, Period !!!
🥺🙏🏻🇺🇸
I bet he’s black
Then wings really must smack
I really don't understand these senseless crimes.
Poor kid 😞
Death penalty
😔🙏 rip very sorry for loss
Heart breaking ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Listen to what that kid said. Go show your mom and dad some love. Not just one time but all the time. Love your parents
The US needs to steal peoples guns away, you got all these bums with firearms
Now the Soros sponsored L.A. D.A. can let the suspect walk out the back door.
All that for some chicken wings
So tax payers have to pay to babysit a grown as man…. Time to reconsider changing the justice system and bring back the death sentence. The system is just a revolving door for criminal with no real consequences. What a joke
criminals are truly sick, you commit a crime and get pissed that it doesnt work so you kill an innocent person. just sad
Why the 2 million bail...Lock this POS up and throw away the key.
Sounds like brown on brown crime. 🤔  who's the boogie man now.....
41 years old and working at Taco Bell...😔
His name was John madden?
This is America the Violent that parents have to raise their children in.......American culture is really going downhill fast.   Another sad day for families across this nation.  RIP sir.
There’s been more shootings at the drive through because their desperate for money I’m glad they found the shooter
Hope he gets reamed in prison cus he tried to rip off bubba.
Your dad knows you loved him. Prayers, for you. I am so sorry you had to witness something so horrible as this in your lifetime.
I'm sure we'll find out He's had a criminal record and has been released. When is society going to wake up? You need to execute him for the life that he took and the lives that he ruined! Enough with the smacks on the wrist and saying we can rehabilitate them. These criminals are like dogs with rabies they need to be put down!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow RIP Beautiful Angel 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹 Sad Story 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 From Edinburg Texas
Show the KILLER..
whybdont they show the shooters face??
Taco Bell should be paying for his funeral expenses !!!! He gave his life for A $20 dollar bill ….
I want to se the face of this devil…mmmm. I wonder what he looks like.
That’s it. The government needs to hire me. I’ll get rid of these senseless people.  May he Rest In Peace.   This is not the end.
Truly sad! Brother was just tryna make it and support family. Senseless 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Why doesn’t the news show a mugshot of the murderer?
I'm so sorry 😞  I still think about him and you. My sincerest condolences
He should have just gave him the food
I wish I could comfort I U all. I send u my ❤love°
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I can't believe that animal had a home who would want to have a demon like that in their house if I had someone in my family living in my house like that I would rip him of his life
I wish the cops had done this when my father was murdered F Stockton California that sh*thole
HOLD GUN MANUFACTURES ACCOUNTABLE TO.   IF THEIR GUN IS IS USED BY A CRIMINAL THEY SHOULD BE GRAMILY FINED AND CHARGED WITH AIDING AND ABETTING. THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THEIR GUNS HAVE GPS AND BIO SECURITY WHERE THEY CAN ONLY BE USED BY THE OWNER.
The footage of the son on the ground was heartbreaking ❤️‍🩹 💔 .  RIP for this man and may there be swift justice in this case.  😢
To the son, you’ll probably never even read this but doesn’t hurt to try. As a Latino, We aren’t the best at showing affection but I can guarantee you that he knows you loved him more than anything. Don’t live with that false regret friend,  your Apá knows you loved him. My condolences and stay strong.
Need a mayor that is tough on crime period
Over $20, senseless!!!Losing a parent is extremely difficult! Witnessing him taking his lasts breaths has to be unbearable! I pray that this young man is able to find peace...
Crime is going up... Minorities need to vote out the bougouise that vote for these policies that hurt us..
Incredibly sad. America what is wrong with you??????
Words cannot express how tragic this situation, and how traumatizing the whole situation is for the victim's son. All family and friends involved will surely have a long, hard road to recovery, and I wish them all the best.   This could happen to anyone, at any time, and it really makes me want to go wake up my kids and wife and tell them I love them right now. So senseless.  Be strong, Carlos.
Nice they got this guy but thanks to the Democratic racial "equity" agenda he'll probably get paroled back out on the streets to kill again.....
Omg to see his dad die in front of him omg so heart breaking.
Yes!  Prayers to family.
Lock that bum up 110 years
Great job to the detectives. They never rest. What a nightmare. Witnessing the worst of us.
Passing a fake $20 bill where have I herd this before. Well I guess the cop had his knee on the wrong neck
a JOGGER broke a family over a fake $20.  Classic.
Whoever did this should Fry in the chair! I have changed my mind on the death penalty the last couple years.
Come on we want to see his face
Gun pollution, it's growing.
So sad. 😥 RIP Alejandro Garcia. 🙏🙏🙏
No talk about hate crime??? I guess only when blax are the victims huh.
Maybe he should've stayed in Mexico.
What kind of worthless mofo tales a life over taco bell food??? This guy doesn't deserve to goto jail but straight to death row but of course that won't happen
I’m very sorry for there loss very devastating heartbreaking 💔 my deepest condolences sympathies to his lovely familia stay strong 💪🙏🏼
💔     So where's the booking photo of the murderer??????
😆😆😆 someone turned him in for some money money. One of his friends snitched on him for that money somebody turned them in they give you reward money 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑😁🤪 don't worry people they'll give him food place to take a shower place to go to sleep oh yeah you turn them in they put them in the big house eat three times a day take a shower three times a day look at TV read a paper read a book go to sleep get up and make your bed go back and go to sleep everything that a man would want don't have to worry about rent don't have to worry about light or water don't have to worry about food they'll take real good care of you in there the only thing you got to worry about is getting raped or getting beaten up or killed it's a mad mad world in there yep anybody in the world if you ain't got a home you're homeless cold and hungry need a place to live all you got to do is break the law they'll give you place to sleep remembered night and day three times a day meals take a shower sleep have your own nice warm bed 😅😁. So see you don't have to be homeless just break the law and you get free room and board food shower warm water everything that you desire 🤪 what you waiting for break the law and you get to have free rent free food 😋
Like we didn't know who it would be.  The LAPD South Bureau Homicide Division, investigators identified Jonathan Madden, a male, Black, 39-years-old, of Los Angeles, as the individual responsible for the murder of Garcia-Galicia.
That poor boy….
Sorry for your loss
It’s sad to see brother’s taking lives on a daily basis. The numbers are staggering like what the hell is going on?
Great 👍
We should hang like this criminals infront of the victims family so no one will dare like do it this kinda of crime period 😡
Why do they even put a bail on these monsters?  Should be NO BAIL! How does a judge/commissioner make these ridiculous calculations? Why not 1 million or 10 million..why 2 million?  Usually 10% to a bondsmen and you are out.  That’s $200,000. That could be somebody’s home used.
taco bell should supply employees with hand guns !!!
why is the killer held on bail though?
Why are they wearing masks?  California is full of sheep 🐑
Turn away from satanic Catholicism! That stuff send people to hell with their idolatry.
WE NEED: - More thorough/strict background checks and mental health evaluations during the vetting process when purchasing a firearms.  - Mandatory periodical mental health evaluations and drug tests for gun owners. - Any gun owner found to be: abusing substances, mentally unstable, or using their firearm with negligence, should have their firearms confiscated until they are proven to be responsible and healthy enough to own/operate a firearm. - Longer wait times to purchase a firearm.  - Close gun purchasing loopholes. - Regulations/requirements for gun owners to keep their firearms safely stored, so no child, mentally unstable person, or any other unauthorized person can obtain their firearm. (Punishment of the gun owner should occur when their firearm is used in a crime by an unauthorized individual, due to negligence.) - Any person with a criminal history should not be allowed to own or operate a firearm.
😔💔🙏🏻
can we know what nationality or race of the shooter or are they gonna brush it under the carpet because it is not gonna favor well in that community?. This isn't something new,but when Mexicans get tired and retaliate it's racial. Smh The news and media need to stop being bias!.
Full weight???? so they will release him in a couple of weeks!! This is what California governor has done!! Release criminals back to the street.
15 dollars an hour close all restaurants  in south la let them eat cake
Notice the duping delight at 1:21.
Pretty sure it was a tinto for 20$ dollar. Hopefully in jail they get him…
Prayer I feel you pain
Gascone will drop the charges
RIP to that man and god bless his family🙏
Because of the new law in CA they let him out already on bail. Thank you governor newsome.
Death penalty ⚡️🤪⚡️
This is like the 3rd killing of a fast food restaurant employee that I've heard of in like the last 2 days! Leave people who are trying to make an honest living alone!!!!
God bless him.
Why are you wearing gangster masks?
It was only $20 and it wasn’t even yours. It was your employers $20.🥜
This makes me realize life is not guaranteed. Prayers for this man's family.
Suspect = BLM
Thank goodness... great job officers and prayers for the victims family 🙏
Fkn aye unbelievable. Wonder why they didn't show the suspect.
Send that killer to the death penalty , he deserves that.
Good prays God they got the bad guy, justice for this father God bless his family comfort them. I lost my father too n I know how it feels my condolences to his son n rest of family
Father and son trying to work together. Probably the father’s second job. Clearly showing a good example to his son and family. Then some ahole tries to pass fake money and get mad. Really over $10 worth of food?
Basketball Americans
This breaks my heart..such a horrible crime,
No BAIL!!!! IS WHAT WE WANT!! COME ON LA!! RIP DEAR MAN!
What about the killer ?
THIS IS AWFUL FOR HIM TO SEE HIS FATHER GET KILLED ALL BECAUSE OF A COWARD PAYING WITH FAKE MONEY SMFH
SHOW THE FAST OF THIS MONSTER!!  Jus saying, but ...i could of sworn at a job, isn't it no relatives working together??
That's effed up, hope Taco Bell does something to help the family
black guy of course. blm silent and no responsibility invoked.
:(
Wasn't there a guy once upon a time who tried to commit a "victimless" crime like that?
Prayers to the Garcia family. This is senseless. May the family find comfort and peace. smh
I'll take "what's the color" for $500, Alex...
Im sorry for your lost. I only wish police would say they plan to bring the full weight of the justice system to all criminals.. Its a dam shame they have to say it because they know that the justice system now just slaps the wrist of most killers today.
Why did he shoot him? I'm sure he didn't just pull out a gun n shoot him...the son should get a break from taco bell funeral paid for n more for it not protecting it's employees
Evil monster people, just killing for fun,  put him in a cage!!!!!
This broke my heart! Praying for your family
I cried. It broke my heart seeing him cry on the ground and I wish I could give him a hug. Really sad to witness his dads death. May Jesus keep you in His protection and may you prosper in your faith and your life. I know it’s difficult, but you gotta keep pushing forward, It’s the only way Jesus will rescue you from these dark times. It’s coming for all the 🌍, I feel your pain brother. ❤️❤️❤️
The suspect is Jonathan Madden, 39 years old, Black Male.  No outrage because it is expected.
JUSTICE WILL HAPPEN
It had to be a African American they the only ones that would do it over some food
RIP! SAD TO SEE SOMEONE LOSE THEIR LIFE IN THAT MANNER.  BRING BACK THE HOT CHAIR! NO MERCY!
Who’s the POS WHO TOOK HIS LIFE? Where is his face? Eye for an eye
Praise the Lord that they got him!  I pray this insanity stops! Yes, prayers for family and friends. Incredible tragedy. God will bring some kind of good eventually. May our grief be constructive. So sorry this happened!
Well this is cut an dry, this is when the death penalty should be carried out swiftly right after the trial. So tragic what this murderer did, my heart goes out to the victims family!!!!
Show us the suspect
DEATH PENALTY!!!
All this over food! Humanity! Where is it?
Please. Don’t let him go free. Death penalty for these Garbage stupidity editor
My heart aches for his family and prayers.
Good. But. There’s one issue.  George Gascon an. Newsom will let him free.  In few years
🙏🏼
Blessings to this man.
Good they arrested him
Over a counterfeit $20 bill. Let the family get a piece of him.
And what’s the shooters name ??
🤔 sussy
Heartbreaking 💔 news. Big tears coming down.I’m sure his dad knew his son loved him with all his heart.
Sorry for your loss, my heart and thoughts are with you young man and your family. May the soul of your beloved father rest in peace. 😢😢😢😢
Why set a bail?? Maximum penalty if guilty.
DA Gascon will probably charge this murderer with aggravated silliness. Gascon is wrong for America!
The shooter needs to be locked up in the jail cell and made to eat Taco Bell food for the rest of his short life
1. Condolences to Family and Friends. 2. LA is a Shithole.  LA's DA and Mayor are to blame.  No photo Let me quess???????
Time to bring back the death penalty and stronger drug laws!
I always tell people.. fast food’ll kill ya! But they don’t listen.
Why are they not showing a pic of Johnny, if he’s 39 show yo face?
heartbreaking…this made me cry
So do Latino Lives Matter too or nah?
Wow you got this man working at Taco Bell to provide for his family and then we have a pig paying with fake money trying to fool someone into giving them food. So sad. So unfortunate.
Sad and speechless .you can see the pain on that family. They need to publicly Fry the perpetrator.
The shooter has a white name but the news is refusing to show his picture so this could go either way
Hope Gascon is happy.
Omg, seeing the son shaking and crying broke me..... That murderer better not get off easy.
Why isn’t the mugshot of this murderer included? This is heartbreaking.
Praying for you Carlos. May the universe guide you and your family on the right way!
So heart breaking I'm glad they took that garbage out the street
Look at this a hardworking father teaching his kid an honest living and this happens ! Someone tell me the dogs name that did this ?
Hopefully the DA doesn't drop the charges down so he is out in 12 months!
Damn the killer 🤬
The Great Democrat voter experience
All over some food should of just have him free food Taco Bell is a multi billion dollar corporation they don’t care about they employees they probably open still after the shooting like nothing happened
I feel so sorry for the family this is so heartbreaking
What's the shooters name???
Why a crime like this granted with bail ?
This is wrong on so many levels n
Omg  nothing is so sad that his young son crying for the last and only one hug.
Bet you can't guess why they didn't show us a picture of the suspect..........
1:16 threw 1:37 man I feel so bad for this Kid man 😢
Condolences to the the family may Christ be with them and watch over them I went to school with Luigi he’s a good guy it’s always the ppl that don’t deserve it
Who kills a taco 🌮 bell employee??  Shameful 😡
It'll be interesting to see how many convictions this monster has accumulated in this beautiful and so humane land.
That guy shouldn’t have any Bail!!
Life in prison is too nice. Lynch him and leave his body for weeks for the world to see that this behavior is unacceptable.
Outrageous. Nobody should have to experience such senseless unprovoked violence. Time to dust off ole sparky. Do a pay-per-view with the proceeds going to the family. Have a message at the end which reads "who wants to be next?"
For real justice for the family wouldn't it be better for this murderer to get castrated; we could reduce crime if the justice system did that!
They won’t show the killer face because they are trying to protect  him for racially profiling. What stupid blm got to say about this nothing All Lives Matter.
39 year old? Wow
I’m so sorry to this family. I can feel their heartbreak 💔. Praying for the son tonight. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Thank you Chief for showing up and sharing that news with the family and mourners.🙏✊
Damn that was the only hug so sad!
I am in tears and my heart is aching for his family, especially for his son. Nobody is safe anywhere, and it just keeps getting worse. </3
This is so sad! I hope they get better!
The murderers mother and grandmother should take their own lives in exchange for the life of the man their son murdered.
The DEATH PENALTY Is Crying Out For JUSTICE  ⚖
🙏
Let just hope this suspect was black person cause is black person in New York or anyway in the states
BLM right?
Give the suspect 110 years!
They won’t show the picture off the killer because they want to protect the race of the suspect what does stupid blm say about this it every life matter.
Prayers for family
Here is more info since the news media are too scare to say the suspect description. “The LAPD South Bureau Homicide Division, investigators identified Jonathan Madden, a male, Black, 39-years-old, of Los Angeles, as the individual responsible for the murder of Garcia-Galicia” —LAPD website.
I'm glad that bean burrito is off the streets!
Praying for the Family, may justice be executed speedily. The devil continues to kill, steal and destroy. Today, is the day to live for God. God's Plan of Salvation can be found in Acts 2. Gotta be ready! These are the last and evil days. There is so much wickedness and evil, so much hatred and strife, all the works of satan. God yet rules everywhere and over everything and everyone. We need to surrender the rest of our lives to God, fulfilling God's purpose, for our lives. We are all here for a reason and it's not to kill,  injure, offend, etc., we need to LOVE one another. We can only do that through God's Spirit living in us. 🙏🙏🙏🥰🥰
🙏🏼🙏🏼🕉🙏🏼🕉🙏🏼🕉🙏🏼🕉🙏🏼🥰💕💕🏞
Angry or not bless you children.... Children bless you parents... You never know when is the last time you see each other.😭
Why can’t we see who this POS is? Gee, I wonder why. I’m guessing one of Maxine Waters constituents.
I am so sorry for your loss 💔.
This is fucked up on God may the killer rest in hell.
oh brother
John madden out here murdering people over tacos?!?! I thought he was dead?!?
take off your mask
This story gets even sadder they were working together damn.
Why is the suspect even getting a bail bond amount, there should be no f-ing bail for that turdbag! Need to publicly lynch that suspect, anything less is disrespectful to the family and society.
Really heartbreaking.  I'm willing to bet the perp has a long criminal history and should still be in jail. Love those liberal DAs and judges. Wish they could be held accountable.
Man tries to use counterfeit bill. Gets caught. But instead of fleeing from the scene, fights with the Taco bell employee. After heated argument man shoots the employee. This is America 2021. Will get worse because criminals aren't getting strict punishment. Our judiciary is broken.
Show his face. Quiero ver la cara de ese cobarde asesino.
My prayers go out to the family.
No diffrent than the cop killing people...horrible
Don't even pay enough for the bs fast food worker's have to put up with.....
Justice for the family 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
My heart breaks for this family. Justice for this man and his family.
This world has gone mad! How could you do this to someone my God! Smh prayers for his family ugh 😣
RIP
So sad to see all these sheep in masks.
no picture of the shooter?
Heartbreaking for the family who lost a father, husband, brother and friend all because of this criminal breaking the law.  I’m sure this isn’t his first offense.  He shouldn’t even get offer life in prison…his life is worthless.  Why waste money housing and feeding this trash in prison.
Hope that they also got his fake money.
You probably won't see this but your Father loved you very very much. He probably just didn't know how to express it the way other fathers did.   Just know that to guys like him Working means everything to a Man. And he got a chance to work side by side with his Son.   Lots of kids don't get to spend time with their Dads. You got to work shoulder to shoulder with him. That's Respect. Take what he taught you and carry on and be strong.
Once again....it was another one of BLM's that did this. Latinos, Azians, and even Whhyytes have a common enemy.... BLM's.  Be ready!
I am so sad an heartbroken by this it’s so horrible I hope this guy gets the death penalty 😢😢my condolences 💐 to the family and those who are heart broken by this 💜💜💜
I hope that coward pays for what he did to that family. So much violence and nothing being done to stop these idiots from hurting people and their families. May God bless that family.
GUNS   GUNS  !                                                                                                                       .....   just saying   .....
Too many cowards walking around free… mostly due to democrat policies
wait, father and son worked at Taco Bell....and he died getting into an argument over $20. 🤦‍♂️
This is so sad. RIP to the victim.
I really hope that Taco Bell gives financial help to this family. It's the least they can do. Sounds like a really good guy they lost.
Released without bail?
Theres a serious supply shortage of organs in this country to be donated...there seems to be no shortage of these horrific criminals. fuk filling up prisons. Turn em all into organ donors/
Kudos the law enforcement for a prompt arrest
Fuq you DEMOCRAT Voters and Politicians. You freed these FELONS/CONVICTS. FUQ you
Because of Gavin newscum and the democrats the killer will be out in less than 5 years.
Who is the shooter?
Wtf!! Killed over some damn tacos. Such a shame. My heart goes out to his family and especially his poor children 💔
My deepest and most sincere condolences to his family & friends. May God comfort you and soothe your pain in due time. I am so sorry for your loss!
Good I am glad they caught that bad fish. Time to process him. I'm sure someone will filet him in prison.
What is Taco Bell going to do? I heard about a girl ( employee ) in NYC killed in a Burger King. I know the police are working hard, but is there something these billion dollar corporations can do to increase the safety of their employees?
Will never understand why people think pulling a gun out will solve anything. That just shows how much of a coward they are. Condolences to the victims family
Killer wasn’t identified as white male. Y’all already know what race it is.
This shooting & killing sh¡t has GOT to STOP!!!!!  Hot head, selfish, a$$hole needs to be treated the way he treated this man,who was WORKING to support his FAMILY!  What happened, did your order get messed up?  Where your going, you won't need food, ever again!!!! Sleep tight, snookums!  762mm full metal jacket, free of charge!
Damz that’s sad 😞 Rip Sir ❤️ Now zappp the shooter ⚡️⚡️
This ia an extreme reaction,  but maybe these companies should stop penalizing workers for accepting fake bills. It's barely a pittance to them, but it's burden on employees.
Broke my heart to see that young man in pain.Just sad what society has come too ....condolences to the family
Hard working people making a living, and a loser trying to rip them off. Sad world right now. It has to change, Make executions a public event.
I’m sorry for your loss. When the son spoke broke my heart. Our dad was killed too. It’s a very traumatic thing to live with. You will be a great dad someday and know he’s in heaven looking down! Thank you Leo’s for catching the pos!
My condolences to the family and love ones. Please pray before leaving your house.
Why no mug shot.  Shall we guess the race?
Senseless crime. Rest in Eternal Peace Alejandro 😇 🙏 🦋.  My deepest condolences to his family, friends, co-workers and community 🙏 ❤
The masks are stupid.
My condolences go out to Alejandro's family & my heart breaks for Alejandro & his family. Why aren't they showing a photo of the murderer? Show the monster, don't hide or protect his image.
Thug must be related to fentanyl floyd
If I was a killer I probably be in Mexico right now on the way to South America!
Jesus Christ please give this family strength..☦️
Should have stayed in Mexico... he'd be alive today.
This looks like 21st-century Wild West.
Was the murderer a member of BLM??  Will they riot for his release?
What a pathetic loser this shooter. Waiting to hear if this worthless human was out on the streets because of liberal policies in the criminal justice system.
So sad and heartbroken. Everything is wrong .Who is responsible for chaos and worry among us threatening our peace and our life.  Why we can't stop this . This is just getting worse and worse and enough is enough!
Where's the mugshot of the shooter?
Who wants to bet on the race or suspect?
So heartbreaking
So heartbreaking 💔
Just a senseless tragedy. I’m so sorry 💔
He should not have any bail!!
This is terrible. Condolences.
These people that are going around killing people, should get life without parole.This is absolutely so sad.
John Madden?
What kind of society are we living in these days??
BE CAREFUL YALL THESE BUMS IS EVERYWHERE 💯YALL BE SAFE & HAPPY NEW YEARS R.I.P TO THAT MAN
Bro people in south LA are brain dead.
No picture of the suspect...
Hispanic Lives Matter!! My comment keeps getting removed!! Keep posting it people!!
Americans must demand that criminals who commit a crime using a weapon must receive the death penalty with no appeal allowed
So happy they caught the horrible person that did this. It just makes me sick some of the things people do in society. Just keep praying people. Pray for the wicked!
Makes no sense. It's bad enough people don't want to work, yet, the ones working are gunned downed.
I hope they got the right guy
Recall Gascon and build more prisons
🙏🙏🙏🧡need more justice
It was over a stupid reason also smh that dude is the definition of a stupid criminal
My condolences brother.
Thank you for catching this scum bag Let’s pray the judge isn’t a sympathizer for this murderer!
It should be a NO-BAIL charge. Not open for debate.
This poor son to have to watch that. So sad
So sorry for their loss
It's bad enough the kid loses his father, but to be there and see him murdered is just brutal.  RIP to this man and condolences to his family.
Yes way to go, now if only the laws are written well !
How about a mugshot of the POS in TV?
His son was working with him when it happened…JFC the senseless nature of this trash human
Death penalty 🤬🤬
Sue Taco Bell for no bullet proof glass.
It hurts me to see so many people in pain. Stay strong. May he rest in peace.
Oh my gosh. His son . . .
leather jacket a little casual for a news reporter?
Terrible. What is wrong with people
Wow
Liberals really need to start muzzling their pets
so sad. my deepest condolence to this family. why do we not value life any more? thanks to lapd for swift arrest. send that monster to prison for good.
Sadly I only see it getting worse in Calif for they just reaffirmed the gov that is emptying the prisons and thinks decriminalizing crime is a great idea.
My sincere and heartfelt condolences to the Familia of Alejandro Garcia. To loss (murdered) such a hard working and responsible person of our community is senseless and evil.
RIP Alejandro
😓💔
39 years old cant even afford a taco, gotta take a mans life over it. What the hell?
So sad .
They found the guy? good. HANG EM!
My deepest condolences. Evil people exist these days and they are uncontrollable. :(
Democrat run cities.
🙏🙏🙏🙏
GOD BLESS THE FAMILY ❣❣❣ CONTINUE  2 PRAY IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST ❣❣❣ YOU HAVE 2 KNOW HE IS WITH OUR LORD GOD/ SUROUNDED WITH LOVE & NO MORE PAIN ❣❣❣
Jesus my heart goes out to them
The BurnLootMurder Crew....AGAIN!
Time to automate some of this crap late at night in these lousy areas. No one should loose their life Taco Bell - this shift was not worth it.
The reporter wearing a mask that doesnt work makes it really hard to understand as well.
Senseless af dude is never gonna see the light of day cali give out Ls like it's nothing
So sad
RIP
My deepest condolences. Lo siento mucho por este joven. Perder a su padre, un hombre trabajador, de esta manera injusta. Pero, le dejo un buen ejemplo a su hijo, el de trabajar para obtener las necesidades basicas. Conseguir dinero de la manera honrada, trabajando. Dios hizo justicia, porque el todo lo ve. Mis condolencias para este joven trabajador como lo era su padre. John 5:28, "There will be a resurrection..." & Revelation 21:3,4. Suffering will end. 🙏
They deserve to rot in hell.cmon shoot somebody cause they got caught have fake money.
I bet he's out on no bail now!!! gascone will let him serve maybe five years and then ready for parole!!!
Take every action possible on that monster! Lord please heal and comfort this family 🙏🏽
Don't worry kid your Father knew you loved him  ❤
God bless this, family and may the Lord cover you with His love and comfort and supply all your needs. 💖 🙏🙏🌹
No one will want to work at fast food places anymore cuz the world's gone crazy!
I watched this note, and looking at the kid crying about his father been killed, that made me cry too.
Sincerest condolences, so heartbreaking....😢
So happy they got they guy off the streets. But I have a stupid question. When you kill someone in cold blood, why do they give you an opportunity to make bail? What good does it serve the community to allow a murderer back onto the streets ON BAIL?
I thought they'd find the person, damn dummy, practically EVERY drive thru have cameras.
Death Penalty
NOT Samaritan A GOD SEND HERO❤️❤️❤️
All these damn judges giving bail for what smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
They need to start adjusting the law. If you have a criminal back ground and kill a person without a criminal background you need to get the death penalty.
Only going to get worse folks under Democrat run cities with Defund the Police and Bail Reform as their platform. Heart aches for this young man as I never got to do what he and millions young boys wished he would of done earlier with his father...RIP.SMH
You youngsters stop taking advantage of yr hard working parents ..Express you love to them...
Why not show the killer Mug Shot....?
If that person is guilty, lock them uber the jail
RIP sir. There is NO excuse for this. NONE
I lost my dad a few months ago and I never got to tell him how much I respected him and how much  I was thankful for he was the only one that would check up on me and I would get annoyed cuz he would always ask questions but this whole time he was the only one that cares enough to even ask and I pushed him away..I have so much regret I can’t even express it I’m hurt that he’s gone and I’m hurt on how I treated the only person who loved me so hard…tell your family how Much they mean to you every chance you get because you never know when the last time your going to see them
*Glad they caught the **-jogger-*
Applause!!!!!
My condolences to his family.
Great job to the police department. IT should be MANDATORY the D.A. attends all his victims'  funerals of his failed leadership and policies! This boy was raised by an extraordinary father. He has such a huge heart! Your father's legacy will live through your life's decisions. Deepest condolences to their loved ones and where is the GoFundMe??
try to use counterfeit money then shoot someone because you get caught  - world is upside down / I hope this family gets justice and the criminal never sees the light of day
Sorry if I'm going to offend somebody... But this soundly like GF passing fake money and sorry their wasn't a knee put on to this scumbags neck also.
Thank God!  My biggest condolences to the victim's family.  I'm so so so sorry 😞
Just another despicable Chump supporter.
DEATH PENALTY TO THE IDIOT - THE SHOOTER! OR THE FIRING SQUAD.
Good 😢 ppl need to stop being so quick to pull a fkn trigger.
America! Heal your nation please! Your country is SICK
Too many fast food foolery
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
2 million bail, this is not good for a family that was aggrieved. It is understood that bails are bribe/corruption. The rule of law always applies to this types of concerns. Criminal prosecution/imprisonment and damages on the end of the suspect.
Full weight? Please make it a death sentence
R.i.p. john madden
Always watch your back no matter where you're at. This is just sad.
This is what ive been waiting to hear and to findout it happened infront of his OMG thank God🙏🙏🙏🙏
Killed the killer too right away
This hits hard rest in peace keep your head up man is not gonna be easy but heads up bro
SHOW THE SHOOTER
😥😥🙏🙏🙏
I thought the da aren’t going to prosecute criminals
This is mess up Rip to the Man praying the family get justice serve 🙏
Hope that guy gets 50 years of Locked Up
Typical America
How come the media doesn't show who it was.
That must been hard on young man his daddy getting getting kill at the job
Bro, I work with my mother this hit hard wow 😢❤️
Put the killer in a chained gang and hard labor for the rest of his life to pay for his crime.
That's so sad that happens if you're working at your job you get killed
Sending prayers to the family .🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Such a tragedy.....killer should have the full force of the justice dept on his neck.
I wonder who the shooter was
DemoncRats stole the presidential election and broke the USA.
Johnathan Madden 😳😳😳😳
Gun-happy on this Earth all they want to do is kill somebody I hate guns it's in the wrong hands
Where is killers picture???
No mug shot? Wonder why
Sorry for your loss
This is so sad
Where's the fuckers mugshot?
Mentally ill, repeat felons walking around our streets with loaded weapons. Are you happy phony QTGOP! Our 2nd Amendment was not written for this purpose. My sincere wishes for healing for this family! This killing was so beyond senseless it's obvious the suspect is not only a repeat felon but seriously mentally ill and should be prohibited from ever walking free again!  Someone this dangerous should never be offered release on bail!
A tough sentence will be deemed racist
God, I am SO SORRY!
Man, i want to be like my Dad too🙏
No suspects photos...let the public see this criminals....take a life of a father and can't show pictures of this criminals...sorry for the lost of your father.....
Glad see they gave him a very high bail instead of low bail like they do most criminals nowadays like the on moron judge here in MN that let a repeat violet offender go to family funeral only for him to go on the run and let a guy who rammed his truck into a fire station to get to some poor lady he was trying to kill out of jail with no bond
Where did these nonhuman animals come from? People who put no value on life. Someone who will kill you over a Taco Bell bill...sickens me. RIP and condolences to the family, especially the son.
This is a sencless act of violence.  We as a community should not act in such a way to commit a crime such as this. Nobody wins nobody loses! Victim or suspect we all lose. In these times we need not to treat each other as animal but as a human being for if one falls we all fall that's the bottom line.  Rest In Peace justice is the only way 🙏
Odd.  No photo of the shooter?  Hmmmmm
When they don't mention the race... well you already know who did it.
What kind of father/son relationship was this, they never hugged before ?🤔 I know it's a tragic situation but don't be like your father, learn from it, young man! Hug your kids daily!
Working night shift at a job very few even care to have in order to support his family and community. My heart goes out to his family. RIP  Society failed you.
Messed up.. Fed rid of Gascon and get some  some justice back in LA
I am heartbroken for this family. There aren't enough words to describe how evil people have become. Prayers for the family to find strength.
Gascon will let him go!
Death penalty he is a murder
Lord have Mercy! This is horrible, this violence must stop.
not worth the money they pay there
He probably mad because they ran out of wings
I thought John Madden died? Hmmf
Wonder why they do not show picture of suspect...
yo quiero taco bell Hahaha  Taco neck by Shaq
Evil Exposed. Nothing like God's justice.
Please make the man pay dearly for his evil ish he did!
Can their be a new law where the family gets to decide the fate of the murderer. Including cruel and unusual punishment. Make it a case by case situation.   Maybe killers would think twice
I’m glad they caught the loser but I’m hurting for this family and what the son has seen
No bail! Death penalty!
Wha perp look like??
Dam he was the same name I do last and first name too
Hopefully homies get at the shooter in jail since there released his name
This is why we should come together despite  where we come from. We all have families that love us and want to see us make it back home. Prayers for the family.
Poor buddy 😢
Dang first the 19 yr old in Harlem NY working at Burger king, then a 16 yr old in Milwaukee also Burger king now this 41 yr old man at taco bell,  all working when murdered all less than a week..rest in luv sir 🕊️🤍🕊️
Another mostly peaceful jogging accident.
Show the MONSTER criminal's face..
He didn't let you have free food so you take his life forever? Who are you?!? I hope they serve this guy the crappiest free meals the prison system can give him for the rest of his sad life. - Rest in peace Alejandro
That kid probably supported BLM until now...
Man shot in Taco Bell. A young woman shot in Burger King in Harlem. What the hell is going on with individuals shooting people in fast food chains?
I pray God comforts this family during this horrible time. You know when they don’t show the criminals mugshot unless he is white  there is a 99% chance he is : The LAPD South Bureau Homicide Division, investigators identified Jonathan Madden, a male, Black, 39-years-old, of Los Angeles, as the individual responsible for the murder of Garcia-Galicia. Sadly had to go to the sheriffs website to get the info because not 1 news outlet would tell anything about the murderer
Woodchipper, feet first, on the slowest setting.
Gun gun gun gun. America has a gun problem.
Maaaan, I'm in tears..Prayers for you and your family Carlos, stay strong..
Heady chang sounds like a great weed name.
God bless and comfort this family🙏
Them tears are heart jerking
Life without parole, nothing less.
Man that son feels what a cruel world
That was evilguy did for taco that was stupid i hope theteen get hugs comfort god give peace fam prayers
Over a 20 dollar bill come On rip 🪦
If he wasn't here illigal!ly it wouldn't have happened 🖕
I want to see the face of this evil monster. Victimizing a hardworking man doing a job that many do not want to do. Working hard and doing an honest living to provide for his family. This is becoming too frequent that we have this type of violence in the US. What the hell is going on! People are losing their minds losing all their humanity and compassion. I'm in shock and my heart goes out to his family, so tragic.
“When I have my children, I want to be like him.” This was just beyond heartbreaking. 💔
Of course the usual suspect.
The killer is the stereotype. Probably a felon as well.
The race of compassion strikes again. Notice how they wont show his face. Guess Garcias life dosent matter
It's taco bell.... What possess some people?? Just a person doing their job. Just a bunch of people need to be taken down a peg these days.
RIP sir...hopefully Gascon will not drop the ball on this...this guy does no longer deserves 0²!!!!
Wow ;(
The hate that Trump caused in this country! Division of the country ! It's really sick what this man has done!
Bruhhh😭😭😭
So senseless. OVER a 20 dollar counterfeit. I hope this sorry excuse of a human gets what coming to him . God bless the family
My deepest condolences to the family...So heartbreaking
DEATH PENALTY
Lawlessness is taking hold.
Staple his pp on a ceiling fan set on high
Lock him up and throw away the key! Set a sample for the rest!
Where is the rest of the story? I highly doubt this was a random killing. What happened,  what was said?
fast food restaurants cashiers should ask for bullet proof vests and double their pay it seems like they getting shot at now more frequently than the cops
Why bail was granted in the first place ? He's a murderer and should be locked up immediately pending for trial.
Thank you for locking up this Moran whom committed this crime.  👏👮‍♂️  It brings peace to my mind that this Evil Moran is not out in our community. My prayers go out to the family!🙏
Who thinks now with the security state we live in can get away with murder? $2million in bail also seems unreasonable. Capital offenses ought to have no bail. The detained can easily pose a flight risk. Just my opinion.
That’s just stupid are people really that dumb.   Thats so sad these poor people working hard to make a living and what do they get some low life Taco Bell eating idiot gone mad and making decisions with a gun.  Killing someone over something so silly wow it’s really low.
To the gunman who killed this hardworking family man , I would have absolutely no remorse in sentencing him to the death penalty.. Death by starvation and thirst.. lock him in an open cage in front of the store where the shooting occurred in full view of everyone and then , let them watch him die!!
I'm so glad they made an arrest! God Comfort All The Loved Ones
R.I.P🙏🙏🙏
Sorry for your loss
Another fine upstanding citizen just trying to get some Tacos. Upholding the stereotype.
POS scum bag give him double the sentence and charge him with federal crime and capital murder
Sorry isn’t enough. Only time heals. I hope the shooter NEVER gets out of prison !!!!!!!
RIP
Hey little homie it wasn't your fault you're your dad didn't hug a lot it was his fault so don't feel bad about that just pass it Forward bro.. hugging you friends and relatives is not gay.
Till America gets the point that this is what a God don't exist America looks like ...No morality, No ethic's, No Values, and Death is all over America.....America will keep getting worse till she cannot be saved and if America gets weaker than she already is she can and will die
A Burger King employee 16 year old girl also just killed at work.
okay, the son is mourning the father but cnbcla isn’t because the son is probably a Trump supporter, sound about right.
God is not sleeping he should rotten in jail Condolences to the family and friends
DEATH PENALTY RIGHT AWAY.!
When people have guns, they often use them in unnecessarily. So sad and so senseless. RIP
I can't imagine liking crappy cheap imitation Mexican food so much, that you will attempt to use counterfeit money to obtain it and when that doesn't work you were literally Resorts murdering someone and not even getting the food, the logic here is so far gone, wouldn't it have made more sense just to go in and Rob the place that way you get real money you get all the crappy cheap imitation Taco you want any chance of you having to actually hurt anyone is pretty low oh, now you going to most likely spend the rest of your life in jail for Taco Bell that you even get
Where's the booking photo of the piece of crap that took this man's life. Guarantee this is another release from prison compliments of Gascon. Rip to the victim.
The perp must have been a disciple of Saint Fentanyl Floyd. Congratulations Liberals and the media.
May Mr. Garcia rest in sweet peace and I hope justice is swift and cruel to the loser who senselessly killed him.
Shooter already out on bond.
I feel so bad for the son. I wish the family the best and sending positive vibes. No family should have to experience this.
A gun owner is a coward who can not function in a civilized society.
Thank god they found that worthless loser. If i made the laws he would get the firing squad.
Refundan a ese desgraciaso en la carcel porfavor!!!😤😤😤
were is the shooter? what is his name?
It's that all these people do, stroke Biden's leg hair, loot, and kill indiscriminately?
I'm just wondering, what's a felon doing with a gun? Why don't the "gun control" nuts focus on getting the guns out of the hands of criminals, getting the criminals off the streets, and leave the hardworking people alone? I'm very sad for this families loss and hope the suspect gets the death penalty that we all voted for!
So sad
So sad to hear this, cannot figure out why people act like animals.
My heart so broken hearing this I’m so so sorry and I know you will be the best dad ever
Time to install bullet proof windows at drive through
Is there a go fund me?
God bless you and your family😔
Just Joggers doin what Joggers do...
This poor man just trying to work and support his family this is so wrong
Great job keep him lock in for ever ..
Everyone should be allowed to carry a firearm to protect themselves or others from bad people with firearms, even employees! #shootback2022
Life in prison for that waste of air.
Look at how they hide the killer's identity.
Condolences to this man's family and friends. The perp doesn't deserve to live😶
Taco bell Corporation is Tricky they rise food prices  inappropriate  Last time  I got something $5.99 now it's a $8.99 $3.00 more I believe many of the Toxi bell Costumers  are angry about  Thier tricky system and take  out of the Taco bell employees  That's not cool  Call the corporation  not the employees
Heartbreaking  my condolences to the family for their loss my prayers are with you
🙏🏻
You can’t even do the right thing anymore or else you get killed. My sincere condolences to the family.
I am so sorry Carlos.
Death penalty needs to be reinstated Nation wide, specifically for dogs like this.. Do your part for global depopulation....Win Win
Show the criminals faces!
I am so sorry this happened to this lovely family. So many senseless murders are happening all over the country. This is madness. Jesus, please heal my country and heal this family.
Once Again.The LAPD,Does It Again.LE,You Rock. And,Chief Michael Moore. Your Awesome.Richard.
Alejandro Garcia May God bless you.
All these crazy crimes , just for the lust of taking someone’s blood 🩸; if it’s him, let’s throw him in prison for the rest of his life!!  🔐
South LA has been killing grounds, taco bell employee and a officer in a matter of a week. RIP
Well you know the shooter is black because if he was white or Mexican they would have said so. I hope the d.a. Will give this dude a life sentence without perole  (death would be better but the d.a. and the govenor are  pussys) im afraid the d.a. is gonna go soft on the shooter
This is so sad. I used to feel for kids who had to worry about getting shot at school, there was just a girl who got shot at a BK in new York city, she had only worked there one week and she got shot and killed. This man was murdered in front of his son, just trying to make a living. I'm pretty sure there is another person who worked in fast food who was recently shot and killed too and now I feel like we can't even go to work. It's not safe.
People who would shoot someone like this seem to be looking for a reason to shoot their gun. One negative thing about carrying.
Perpetrators going to spend the rest of their life in jail. Was it worth it for a $10 meal?
So we can go to his home and protest and make him uncomfortable and his family...make them experience anguish and unsettled...every thing.....
Reminder to criminals, it’s 2022, cameras are everywhere.
people gotta seriously look in the mirror and ask themselves, " am i one of these demons that would act out like this?"
I get him we men don't really hug like this but he's right we gotta show more love and support to family even the black sheep
Everyone and their mother knew it was a black man when this happened.
These stories shatter my heart and I pray for his family and may god give them strength. The 19 year old man broke my heart and I agree with u 💯 I lost my father and I never told him how I felt about him nor gave him a hug. I do encourage everybody that does have a father still, show how grateful you are! May god bless your father and may god enter him into heaven🙏💯🤲
Sad sad sad believe me GOD BLESS THE FAMILY OF THE MAN THAT UNFORTUNATELY DIED AMEN 🙏
Let’s see how Gascon will handle this.
Prayers for the family
So no photo of the perp, I wonder why???
over Taco Bell?
You know why they aren't showing a picture of the perp???  Because he is black...
THANKYOU JESUS !!!  and the Police .
Charge that loser with a hate crime
Finish the wall .
That poor son, he had to see his father die. My lord. There are no words for that
👍
Some people shouldn't get bail. It's not gonna stop until we start giving out the death penalty for this kind of tragedy. Life in prison is not enough. Execution within 30 days after being found guilty, period. Better yet, televise the execution for all to see. It might just change a bad guys mind thinking that his mother will see him or her hanging from a rope.
Why not showing face of the criminal ???
Garcia Family, sending you my deepest condolences. 🙏  Carlos, your father will be beside always and I’m certain he knows how much you love him. 💞 Praying for your comfort and peace. ✝️
PEOPLE AT THE RESTAURANTS DESERVE ALL MY RESPECT. THEY ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES JUST TO HELP US. THE RESTAURANTS ARE HELPING US TO SURVIVE THIS PANDEMIC.....  DEATH PENALTY FOR THIS ANIMAL. DEATH PENALTY. DEATH PENALTY... SOMETIMES THE DEATH PENALTY IS A NECESITY.
Do not worry he be back on the streets soon with this liberal justice system!
This breaks my heart into a million pieces. What a cruel world we live in. Why hurt an innocent hardworking man trying to make an honest living to provide for his family? I hope the coward who did this gets dealt with in prison. My deepest condolences to the family. Carlos dear, I know this is very hard, but you gotta stay strong for your family. Your father will never be forgotten. May he rest in paradise. 😔💔🙏🏻
So glad they caught that person what an absolutely senseless crime.
Save our taxes take him out!!!!
2 million bail? He must be white
We're living in an evil society
No video on the scumbag,How peculiar
Joe Biden American
This is so heartbreaking...and senseless.
the balloons again
This is so very sad man I really feel for this family may God comfort them
EXTRA CRISPY PLEASE
He should have made a run for the border.
So he died because someone tried to use fake money and he called them on it??? Wtf is wrong with this country
Where is the photo or video of the shooter? Why don't you show us his or her face?
Death penalty needs to come back, along with multiple cameras as witnesses
They caught the scum...YES! Now if they can find the killer who killed the teenager working at Burger King in New York
QEPD !
Joggers are a trip
Amen amen 🙏 🙌 amen 🙏🙏😥💐🌹🌻🌺
MEXICAN LIVES MATTER . PUT SPOTLIGHT ON US THIS 2022
Idk what I would do! If they found the suspect I would threaten his life in prison  Until he commits suicide
That poor son 🙏 too much badness
:)
Fake $20 bills cause so much trouble!!!!
The shooter. Salt or Pepper?
live harvest body part to repay family
public stoning it too good for these evil doers.
may the evil does get epstiened
I remember when news would show who the criminal is
Biden’s America!!
RIP. ❤️🇨🇦❤️
shoulda shown the loser who did it! so senseless … OVER TACO BELL 🤦🏼‍♀️
The family gets life time supply of takos.
Awesome to hear that they caught the creep who took this man's life so unnecessarily  RIP son. Your memory will live on through your loved ones. God bless you 🙏
