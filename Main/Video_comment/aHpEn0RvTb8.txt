Bruh the way you laughed and the facial expressions at 9:41 took me out 😂😂😂😂
you dont have the voice to be blabbing nonstop
9:40 that face bro made 😭🙏
This game didn’t feel real. It was definitely more of a defensive meltdown than an offensive masterpiece.
bringing back up qb and reciever
Bro really gets more views off the dolphins than the patriots 😂
The defense got shitted on so bad u gotta feel bad💀💀
Raheem mustard😂😂
Broncocs are never going ever recover from his game there aready in a body bag

kinomtonomtonomtonomtonomtonotonomtonomtonomtonomtooetonokmtonomtonomtonotonomtkinomtonokmtonomtonotonomtonomtonotonomto
Flight didn’t know what a backplate was💀💀💀
Bro we are nOT worried bout breaking no record against DENVERr🥴🤕💀🤣🤣😩 we’ll pop it against somebody actually worth it🙃🙁
Ig we can officially can't say cap no more when flight says he'd do a certain move in football😢
as a broncos fan this gave me flashbacks to the Seattle super bowl
flight never seen a backplate before lmfaoooo
Giants ready to get blowout when they play the dolphins
bro i love watching flight high
Achane is crazy fast he had a 4.32 time and it was started late he probably had a high 4.28 maybe speed
Whats worse this or barca losing 8-20
Imagine buying a ticket to watch your favorite team lose so bad that the other team almost breaks a record 🌬️🥶🎠
17:38 “try not to fall asleep” 😂😭
Can't believe they did this without Dan Marino.
I never knew nba and nfl had same comantaters
“Yeah this def going to o.t” 6:34 😂💀
Does Flight actually not know players? 😭
Number 28 should be in the Patriots
7 points away from a record  1934 NFL Championship game Washington scored 77 Points
Achane our rookie
achanes 40 is 4.32
Never see any quarter back so friendly with friends and coach like this.
bro i am a 49ers fan and even i say this game was entertaining as hell
Yo is flight gonna react to the college games or what??
"Yeah this definetly going to OT" 6:33 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Flight don’t sleep on Syracuse
“fire your field goal assistance”😭😭😭
"yea this definitely goin to OT" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conga Line celebration was in effect
I’m so happy you are a Patriots fan . FINS UP
Bro he’s GONE
you’ll have to watch the broncos if they get 80 balled lmao
Not seeing the box score is criminal FLIGHT WTF
Bro it was 70-20
“Fire your field goal assistant coordinator” - Flight   💀💀💀
6:34  Flight - “yeah this definitely going to OT”  Me - “should we tell him?🤣”
Man’s said his bone was sticking out his back I am weakkk then he goes “I didn’t know you can do a center sneak, what if they put that in madden” hell nah he can’t be serious 😂😭
my thoughts and prayers are with those who are naive enough to think flight didn’t already know the outcome of the game 😭😭😭🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Honestly, I don’t know what’s worse being zero and 16 or this game
Flight high ash😭😭
Broncos country, lets ride.
it’s pronounced A- CHAIN
12:30 ay they were on this time though🤷🏾
Flight is lacking lowkey for not post the Oregon vs Colorado dam😅
Miami dolphins are the main character team tbh
yessssss sir , let’s Go Dolphins!
Worst loss ever
Goodness gracious embarrassing
I am so pissed off
This is embarrassing
Imagine being a broncos fan like I am experiencing this embarrassing loss😔😔😔😔
What happened to my team god damn I’m triggered😡😡😡😡
idk this was recommended to me its just some annoying dude yelling at a replay
“It’s like a madden game”😂
Bro that a cap he not no prime rick Williams cause Ricky was big n strong , that rb just fast
The Dolphins took most of the starters out early. They had a rookie UDFA RB Chris Brooks in the the end. They could have scored even more. The biggest story is how the Broncos hired McDaniel as a ball boy and wouldn’t consider him for the head coaching job recently. Also, Payton talking trash about the previous Denver coaching staff being terrible and talking trash about how Tua should be replaced by Bridgewater. Then seeing Chubb enjoying them beat up his old team after they said they didn’t need him. Glorious.
“I can tell this bout to be a shootout” 😂😂😂😂
how does flight not know what a backplate is he said ''is that his bone sticking out' im dead bru
First time experiencing a 70 point game by one team in the nfl. And I’m so happy that the dolphins did it FINS UP
the record for most points in a game was back in 1966 when the Redskins scored 72 points the dolphins on sunday could have scored 73 with a FG but they choose not too
watch deebo smith 49ers week 3
if you didnt know the people who scored was Tyreek Hill 1 TD Raheem Mostert 4 Total 3 Rushing TDs and I Receiving De-Von Achane 4 Total 2 Rushing and 2 Receiving and Robbie Chosen aka Robbie Anderson 1 TD please let me know what you think
De'Von Achane is a rookie that they drafted in the 3rd round this year
The no look shovel was the slickest play I’ve ever seen
Why was this game requsted?  Go to sleep? Wow man i understand youre a patriots fan lol. Not used to scoring and excitement 😂😂😂😂 they pretty much broke a record lol.
Statistically spesking tua best qb in the nfl even rankwd number 1 in deep ball accuracy so hes the best at the deep ball. Forvthise that woukd say just look at his weapons. Well you can say the same for mahomes
Funny thing is: Dolphins Head Coach was denied the coaching spot for the Denver Broncos last year
It’s not the offense u clearly seen it’s the defense
3rd and 4th qrt played by 2nd and 3rd string players.
6:36
5:25 they got that from A Reid.
“Mustard”
As a Miami dolphins fan this made me so happy
Lol maannn go look at his highlights #28
Proud to be a Dolphins fan!
Watching this motherfucker watch football is fucking hilarious. Dude thought they ran a fucking center sneak
They could have left it at 69 too lol
For real tho it’s like the phins were playing on madden pro arcade mode they just put on a slaughter house 😂

As a Broncos fan it’s going to be painful watching Flight react to this
The Dolphins straight up drowned the Broncos.💀🐬
Fr you’re already there might as well take the record lol 😂🤷🏻‍♂️
The best of the game was the  td. dance. 😂
😭😭😭
"Mustard and A chains"💀🤣
Lifelong Dolphins fan and I used to pray for times like this LOL. I also would have kicked the field goal...
Nah dolphins coaches some bitches. Go break that shit
Flight, I have to say this for the first time: My Broncos are a national embarrassment!
He said “Yo was his bones sticking out 😟😟😟”. 🤣🤣😭😭😭☠️😭☠️😭☠️😭☠️😭
Tua Rondo
Broncos really got that SPANKINGGG
his 40 time is like a 4.38
"Fire the field goal assistant coordinator" 😭😭
Achane is the fastest runner on the dolphins. And that's saying alot.
🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Fins up!!
Flight is so funny not gonna lie😂
Eagles bucs game
“1 billion dollar move wit a 1 cent finish”
The great thing about that no look shuffle TD in the 2nd quarter was tua chucked it with his right hand, but he is a lefty...
Fullback was under center
Does this go to overtime 😂😂😂😂
that's that 70 piece dance
Griddy Congo line was disrespectful af
FTCCCCC
Should’ve gone for the field goal at the end
18:46 That's crazy 😂
So inspirational playing madden with Tyreek😢
Is he going to react to chargers Vikings?
FLIGHT WATCH THE CHARGERS VS VIKINGS GAME
I went to high school with achane dude is HIM
Fight we know u a fins fan, u can’t admit it
React to the chargers vs Vikings game
Didn’t even look at the box score 4 & 4 for the rbs 🔥
Devon Achane remember the name
just imagine if it wasn’t the broncos but was the patriots and the score was 20-70😭 yall think flight would change teams then?😭
I just don’t understand why we didn’t beat or attempt the scoring record . I wanted the backups to be part of history and to stick it to butthole lips!! WHY WAS RUSS IN TILL THE LAST PLAY OF THE GAME . If their starters are still in when there’s zero percent chance of them coming back then we do t stop scoring PERIOD!!!!
Field goal coordinator 😭😭
Bro flight just react to every football games highlights I’ll watch that shi everytime 😂😂😂
Dude so cooked he talkin bout a center sneak
he said fire errbody 😂
Achane is in the same convo as tyreek and monstert and waddle. 4.3 speed.😂
Pray to God
Pray to God
ouuu i was waiting for this video when i seen the score on tiktok lmao
6:09 is his bone sticking out💀 flight so stupid man
9:38 When the demon inside of me takes over
Dolphins were doing victory dances in the first half 😭
Bro really thought the center can run the ball without snapping it🤣🤣
Let's see Colorado VS Oregon
MUSTERD
Achanes 40 time is 4.32
6:03 Bones sticking out got it 🤣🤣🤣
Bro said is his bone sticking out 😂😂😂
LMAOOOOOOO
Can’t lie I just been waiting for basketball reactions…

Fire the field goal assistant coordinator🤣
Did he dolphin laugh in this one?
Field goal assist coordinator 😭
18:35 💀
May never see a murder like this again.  Last time this happened the super bowl didn't exist yet.  That happened after a game like this.
“I can tell it’s gonna be a shootout” famous last words
6:05 no way
Flight just thinks these players got unlimited stamina, he wants everybody to juke
Bro flight thinking the broncos gonna come back was funny asffff😭😭
Flight be acting like he just doesn’t hear any nfl news on the media😂capper
He’s gonna have to react to another broncos game cuz New England plays them
broncos fans can at least be happy they're in history again
Field goal assisted coordinator😭💀
Achane ran a 4.3
16:30 “these guys are still losing by about 78” what???
Miami has the Dolphins the Greatest football team, they throw the ball from Goal to Goal like no one's ever seen. They're in the air, they're on the ground, they're always in control, and when you say Miami..your talking Superbowl.
Flight is dumb enough to say “oh is this finna be a broncos comeback?” When it’s 63-20 in the 4th😭 this guy doesn’t know shit about football
“yeah this definitely going to ot” 🤣🤣🤣
"I can tell its gonna be a shootout" lol
The ravens game vs colts
😂😂😂 o my lmao
Flight u a fool for thinking Mimz bone was sticking out ☠️ 😂
He’s baked 😂
Flight bouta become a dolphins fan
Read your bible! (KJV, preferably) ♥‎‎ ‎. .
Damn not even on madden this is possible
Flight so inspirational man
We waited for this
Flight speaking facts in the end there, Broncos need to fire all their coaches and hit the reset button
This was a evisceration‼️😭😭
Tbh, it was in my opinion, Sutton's two fumbles that ended this game. They just gave the Dolphins too many offensive drives.
What makes it worse is that the broncos traded a first round and 2nd round pick for their Coach
Mannnn They shouldve said FUCK SEAN PAYTON, NEVER GONNA GET THAT CLOSE AGAIN. Cement his ass in the LOSING HISTORY BOOK
Ingold is the Dolphins fullback. He went under center to try to sneak it.
You could see actual happiness in Flight when Tua threw that slick no look shovel. His reaction to the conga line celebration 🤣☠️
W
we life-long fins fans have been waiting so damn long for a team like this
Go Dolphins!
Do the Cardinals pls
I Russell came to the patriots less money
“i can tell this is gonna be a shootout bro”
wait til he sees how much fields has regressed
That dolphins team love eachother 😂 you dont jus dance together like that wit anyone
ayo flight you gotta chill 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Where that Colorado game at…… idc if they got blown out 😂
John Madden Jacked Into  An NFL Game. He Clearly Hates EA
7:52 hill should be down
Flight said “I can tell it’s gonna be a shootout”😂😂
The entire league is watching like the kevin hart "DAMN" as that score just keep climbing. Getting Mercied in the NFL is crazy.
Bro.. 70pts is fucking hilarious.
Tua is what we need at patriots
Waddle didn’t even play
"Yeah, this defenitely goin to OT..."
This man said jacksonville not hot? your florida card has been revoked you can’t come back fight
I’m glad I didn’t watch that game. Being a Broncos fan is tough…
A game we're he can actually say they are down by 40 and be right lol
the rant for the broncos at the end was golden 😭😭😭😭
Fire the field goal assistant coordinator😂
DEVON ACHANE REMEMBER THAT NAME HE IS GOING TO BE A STAR! HE’S ALREADY A STAR.
Them niggas had a routine
Tua hit that hoe on the celebration 💯
He thought it was gonna be a shoot out then after the kickoff return td he said comeback💀💀
Flight definitely knew the outcome of this game it was all over the socials. Plus I ain't ever heard him say "oh yeah this going to OT" as much as in this game
A-chain
As a Bears fan, don't watch our game
love the reaction video flight
9:37 😭😭😭
They killed that dance 😂😂🔥🔥
Football fusion as score
Losing by 50 is crazy 💀💀💀💀
“Fire your field goal assistant coordinator” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6:33 Bro really thought it was going to OT 😭😭😭
9:40 I always get scared when he does this
I was at that game to my dolphins put up 70
His bone is sticking out
That’s Robbie anderson?
Dolphins HC said he didnt go for the record because he basically took pity on denver. Said he wanted to put some Good Karma on Miami
‘losing by 50’ couldn’t be more accurate😂
colorado game
That's what my fucking dolphins do baby's we on top Sean should've stayed with my saints goofys dolphins getting that superbowl
FINS UP!!!LETS GO!!!!DOLPHINS!!!!
“This definitely going to OT”  💀

FINS UP BAAAAAABY 🐬💪🏼🚬
Flight about to bandwagon to the dolphins

From the looks of it, Russell ain’t the reason they loss
Achane is actually that dude
“Maybe they’ll spark a 4th quarter comeback?”😂
Wait until flight finds out Achane runs a 4.32
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Jesus didn’t come into the world to condemn the world but to save the world. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven. 💯
“If Wilson’s making those type of throws this early in the game it’s going to be a good game” 😂😂 2:09
Bro keep Tlking about cut bck😭😭 niggas can’t cut bck when running fast asl.
dolphins fannn here actually surprised that happened
Sean Payton is fine they need playmakers Russ has nobody to throw too and they O-line is garbage
How is he a patriots fan? Definitely a bandwagon 😂

He should’ve seen the catches and touchdowns each player had
NFL is dying ever since Messi came to this country. MLS is taking over
Dolphins fans been suffering far to long ! It’s about time hahaha

Patriots won already
Broncos got they ass whooped on a saturday afternoon that's tuff😂

"Bro this Dolphins game better be a double overtime .." 🤣🤣🤣
nigga said come back 😂
When he said "this def going OT" I laughed .... I was at this game too
quick question for a casual football enjoyer: why didn’t they go for the FG to break the record?
Yes sir my team Miami 305 let's go dolphins all the way my home town team to all my haters
ANOTHER FAKE REACTION 5:35 is something he would never say if he didn’t know the final score
Hey u should react to the Oregon ducks vs Colorado College football
More like A-Train from The Boys cuz that nigga moving……I want him drug tested he might be on some compound V😭😭
The All-Time record in the Regular Season is 72 points. For all games, it was 73 points.
Broncos offense only scored 13 points, but Russ fans want to blame the defense- they both suck!
FAM take in the stats, I was waiting for that
6:08 “is his bone sticking out?” Bro😭😭😭
Flight: “I can tell its gonna be a shootout.” me: yeah only one team is shooting
😂😂like a madden game
Bro thought the broncos were coming back down 50 with 9 minutes left
Flight you do know the dolphins lost to the jags 62-7 in a playoff game right lol
WE JUST KNOW FROM THE THUMBNAIL 😂😂😂😂😂
Miami automatic Super Bowl bid for this obliteration, they lookin hella solid

Achane's 40 was 4.32, so far this year the top 5 ball carriers in terms of speed have all been Dolphins(Hill, Achane, Mostert).

Flight should join a flag football league and this time them cameras gonna be on
Achane 40 time is a 4.3 fastest 40 time by the rbs
I agree, this loss lies solely on the field goal assistant coordinator, hes gotta go

tua looking like his prime self in college if ykyk
Just so you know this could’ve broke two great records 1. Most total yards (they got 726 the record is 735) and the most points in a game (they got 70 💀💀💀💀 the record is 72 and they were in fg range lol) still tho 70-20 is outrageous 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Bro why didn't he look at box score

Achane 3rd rd rook from Texas A&M ran a 4.28 40 at combine

@NotYourAverageFlight  18:06  They could have broken the record here, thing is McDaniel had his start in the NFL as the Denver Bronco's ball boy. Imagine the disrespect if he broke the record against the team that made him have a career.
2:40😂

Where’s college football reacts
I click the vid and I said “o ya why was everyone freaking out about this” looked it up and I was like o ya flight gonna have a field day w this 😅😅😅

They should have kicked the field goal
9:39 😂😂😂😂

THE THUMBNAIL 😭😭😭😭
This may be the greatest YouTube and a meal experience I’ll ever have

I was waiting all day for this 😂
The first time we all experienced a 70 piece NFL PERFORMANCE in our lifetime lol never thought I’d see the day
“That’s respect”THEY WON BY 50 😭😭😭😭

Broncos took the worst ass whoopin this was worst then the giants get 40 to 0 by the cowboys  💀💀💀
"This is gonna be a shootout I can tell" More like a firing squad
Thought no blowouts
i have no idea how Vance Joseph still has a job in the next couple of days - shit gotta change.
When a team lose this bad Flight's always tell someone to fire the whole staff lol🤣🤣🤣🤣
Today is a good day
The center didnt sneak it the fullback did.
My team😊
Flight go get on the Miami roster😂
Yessir. Reacted to 3 of 3 for dolphins
Deadass doo

Ahh hell yeah w reaction comin in
Ready to cardinals vs cowboys
i’m a broncos fan originally from hawaii. my team needs a clean sweep it’s so bad dude. on that note i’m really happy for tagovailoa
As a Broncos fan, I am disgusted, outraged, embarrassed, and pissed off. Russ played good, he's not the problem. Our defense is the problem, and Vance Joseph needs to go
The Dolphins are a legit playoff team. As for the Broncos man this team is so underwhelming.
“Fire your field goal assistant coordinator” 💀
How did y'all trick Flight into watching this
Getting tired of these 15 sec non skipable ads tf Is this youtube
look at the box scores flight
U know it’s bad when he skip the box score😂
“Yea this game is going to OT”….. 20-70 “You guys are never being watched for the 2024 season on this channel “😭😭
6:23 he really asked if his bone was stickin out 😭💀

I been tryna tell people that achane is him
As a dolphins fan we’re looking strong

"yo was his bones sticking out" flight a fucking fool man LMAOOOO
The fact that my Dolphins scored more points in a SINGLE game than the Broncos have in three games. That's sad 😂😂
“If Wilson is making throws that early in the game this gonna be close” oh how wrong he was😂
Broncos fans would’ve preferred they kick the field goal. I mean you might as wel
Fire the field goal coordinator 😭😭😭😭😭
Can tell the MF was getting old when he paused on the plays when a player wouldn't cut back😂 #DIRTY30 OTW😂😂😂
anyone notice how fucking high flight is?
this is worse than the Atlanta falcons 28-3😂💀
Those niggas when out sad😂 they lost by about 82😂
“What happened to his pad, Oh is his bone sticking out??”😭😭😭😭
"we don't watch blowouts"
😂😂😂
@6:03 “are his bones sticking out” 😂😂💀💀
"Was his bone sticking out"😭😭😭😭 Bro buddy wouldn't be even able to walk....
