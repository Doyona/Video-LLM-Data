What an absolutely beautiful and amazing wedding congratulations on your 2 years of marriage.
I would not have thought that a theme color of black and white could look so good! The black bridesmaids dresses were so beautiful!
Congratulations!! Continue to keep God at the forefront of your marriage and never allow your threefold cord to be easily broken (Ecclesiastes 4:12)!!
Felicitation! Nous aussi on parle mariage sur notre chaîne :)

K guys I was crying the whole time especially when you talked about how God had a plan for you two... Your letters to one another were so beautiful. I feel blessed to have been able to watch this and that you shared it with all of us. And yes I've been following you for a bit but this was the first time I watched your wedding video... It was so amazing. Thank you..
That was the best bouquet throw I have ever seen 💐
Keep the Lord Jesus First!!! 1 Corinthians 13!
They were pregnant all ready one month. Because there baby born in November 2023

You look just Cinderella in your dress Sophia!!
I know I’m late but congratulations! May the Lord bless you a wonderful life together❤
The most beautiful wedding I have ever seen ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🩷🖤🤎🤍🙏❤️‍🔥😇🕊️❣️🏆🎂🍰😍😘🥰🥺😭

It’s funny but there’s one shot at the end of the ceremony where a Taylor’s complexion looks like one of the twilight vamps. Nothing evil intended of course just Hollywood stuff
May Jesus continue to bless your marriage God bless you both! Congratulations!
They really compliment each other. May the love they share go deeper every day. Love never fails.
Aww, Julia and her husband seem like amazing friends🫶🏻
I cannot get over those gloves.... You really look like a princess with those ❤❤❤

This is the most beautiful wedding video I’ve ever seen. I sitting here with tears streaming down my face. Sophia, the letter you wrote to Taylor is everything I hope and pray that I will be able to say someday to my future husband.
Las tomas de los novios juntos lo hacen el mismo dia de la boda o es una pre sesion?

Beautiful wedding but why do people have to wear so much make up and get so tan why can’t they just be happy with their natural every day make up look. And skin color.you are so pretty naturally. You look so much older than what you are.
How so very beautiful! Wow so perfect what a beautiful journey youd are going to start! And yes yous makes the most beautifulest couple going! Congrats to you both!!🎉🎉❤❤❤💙💙💙
Breathtaking so so beautiful........When Taylor cried I cried
Is this real life! 😭 I wouldnt know
Hi,  how can I contact you? (im music composer) I want to make a music video of a romantic original song from my Music Band, using your wedding video, if you allow me, giving you the corresponding credits.
Beautiful couple, beautiful event, and beautiful wedding dress!  God bless their union!!!!🎉
Blessing always from Nancy!!
Absolutely beautiful! 💛💛
Sophia and taylor looked a lot different for what they were then and to what they are now. Totally different. Not much recognizable from past to future. Both got more better in looks.👍👍
Can someone explain to me why this video has so many dislikes? (I have the dislike extension btw)
Congratulations, Jesus is Lord!
Congrats
How old are you?
That was beautiful. Happy Ever After wishes for you both. 🙏❤💥💫🌱🌎
Interesting if he is younger than she ❤❤
Such a beautiful perfect day!! You looked stunning Soph!
Is anyone else watching this while going through a breakup Im just sitting here with tear rolling down my face wishing I could get married to someone like him
Happy wedding day

Beautiful couple and wedding congratulations to you both always
Blessed Amen 🙏
Absolutely beautiful, as a grandma of 5 ,(3) granddaughters, I pray this for them, Al in God’s divine timing. Your husband cracks me up, you guys are young, love & live life, congratulations on the pregnancy, all will be well
the fun will start when he gonna start to cheat on you 😁
💜🙏💜
So sweet
I'm trying my hardest not to cry but I'm gonna cry anyway
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Beautiful beautiful wedding, God bless you both always 🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻
Nice wedding video
That was a really enjoyable video to watch.
No bc they way he cried when he saw her and reading the note is amazing and shows true love wish them both lives of joy with each other
Why so much makeup and such a dark fake tan? Good grief, she looks 40 and like she’s spent the last six weeks on a beach in Brazil, meanwhile he looks like a pasty white 16 year old dumpling. 😂
Oh my gosh when Taylor started crying when she was walking down the isle🥺 they are the cutest
You guys are seriously the cutest couple and soph you are so beautiful. God really created you flawless when it come to beauty within and with out congrats on wedding and soon being a new momma to a beautiful baby! GOD BLESS YA'LL
Awe❤
SO BEAUTIFUL
The wedding looks amazing, but the videographer could have done a better job with the chronology of the events and with the skin colors in some moments.
This type of love is a once in a lifetime, congrats to you both❤❤ I lost my love on April 25th and he was my once in a life time.
Stay married
CONGRATULATIONS!!!! God bless you!🥳
There's going to be alot of people scratching their heads in disbelief when they find out I wasn't even invited, and I'd love to be there when you try to explain that.
Congratulations, always keep Jehovah in your marriage and may it be successful because a three fold cord is not easily broken, Ecclesiastes 4:12.
May God bless you both and your families!❤🙏🏽🤲🏾
That was amazing ❤❤❤❤
I just cried my eyes out to this
What is the second song?
What a picture perfect day.  What an absolutely gorgeous wedding!  You are so fortunate to have found each other in this life ❤

Such a beautiful wedding and a wonderful couple! I got all emotional crying when you read your letters. Wishing you that lifetime of happiness.
Taylor reading the letter is making this one of the most emosh wedding videos of all time😭❤️ LOVE LOVE LOVE
Why are they reading each others vows? That’s so weird
Heavy handed on the self tanner.
Soph is so so beautifull.. May God be with you guys each step of everyday ❤❤❤❤
Divorced soon
To most of us, you are still "kids", but your life decisions are showing TRUE maturity and wisdom. Your wedding video made me cry, especially the letters. You are SO blessed to have each other. Yes, it's Beauty and the Cutie, and your online antics can be "young", but I LOVE that! You're being authentic. REAL is what the world needs, rather than what the world thinks it wants - which ends up as false pretense. It's so refreshing. I love what you're doing.   The young Husband got the appreciation, respect, and love of the beauty of his dreams. The young Wife got the protection, adoration, and whole heart of the cutie of her dreams. What more could anyone desire?   To the both of you, The Greatest Love Story ever told is John 3:16-17. The fact that you want to use your love as an example of what God's love for us looks like is all God ever asked of married couples. It's the most beautiful part of your beautiful story.   May God continue to RICHLY bless you in every way, and grow you in Wisdom and Love. Your blessings are running over onto others' hearts. 💞 In the painting reveal comments, one woman said she gave her heart to Christ because of your witness! I rejoiced over her! That's your most important gift. 😍 Love.
nothing like plastering your life allother the internet...
This is so cute omg ❤ wish you both the best ! Congrats
Way too much self tan.
Absolutely beautiful wedding!!! You were one of the most beautiful brides I have ever seen and that beauty started shining within. You have that glow girl!! You guys are a true example for young Christians in this world today♥️♥️
Stumbled upon your short video on Facebook and had to come to YouTube to see your wedding video. This was beautiful. I love this for you both...so very happy for you 🙏❤️
Congratulations guys I love watching everyone of your videos watching this made me cry ❤
This was just so beautifully done. ❤❤🎉 Congratulations on your journey of life. Remember a family that prays together ❤ 💙  Stays together.  We are more than conquers Through Christ Jesus. ❤
I love this soo much, you guys are perfect for one another ❤ May God bless you both with many many beautiful years together 🙌🏻
This is the cutest thing ever omg 🤭
I started crying they read each other the letter they wrote each other. I’m glad he’s the one for her. She so beautiful inside out….. love u both
🎉🎉❤❤ congrats 🎉🎉
Your dad is sooooo handsome 😅😊

Sobbing
❤ your wedding was like the notebook ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Such a beautiful wedding video ❤
I was so confused when Taylor was reading the vows at the beginning when he said “To the man I have hoped on since I was a little girl” or something like that. I was like “what!!”
This is so beautiful. I’ll admit I definitely cried because I hope after my recovery I get to find a love like this one day.🤞🏻I will pray to God and ask him to help me find my future husband
this was such a beautiful wedding
That was so beautiful!! 🥰💗😢
So so so cute!! I love you guys congrats ❤️😍
I love you both I want love like this ❤❤❤

Congratulations to you both sitting here in tears u was absolutely stunning bride Sophia and such a handsome groom Taylor wish use all the best wishes in life much love from Scotland uk xx
I have a question. How do males and females bond with each other? I don't see how men and women can bond (especially romantically) with each other. Men and women think very differently from each other.  Women can build incredible friendships and become very close to each other in a way men can't bond, and science shows that women can bond very well with each other. Generally, women are even more social than men are. After something bad happens, a woman quickly rushes to talk to all of her female friends to get support, whereas a man can isolate himself and grief alone.  Women tend to be more emotional, more caring, more empathic, more compassionate, more affectionate, more loyal, more nurturing, more understanding, more sympathetic, more sensitive, more kind-hearted, more peaceful, more calmer, more gentle, more expressive, more intuitive, and more outward than men are, and thus bond more with other women in a special way that they can’t with men. Men, on the other hand, are not that emotional, and thus can’t bond with other men in a special way.  Women are more comfortable being around with other women than they are with men. They have a type of bond that usually men with women won’t really have, or with men and men.  Women feel a lot safer in general with other women than they do with men if either is alone with each other, and it is easier for women to trust other women more than it is to trust a man.
Y’all got married right down the road from me 🤪
So beautiful that letter Sophia wrote you had me in tears 😫❤️
I have been in tears for 7minutes congratulations you two beautiful people ❤this was a stunning day filled with truly beautiful words in the letters  My heart is overflowing with happiness ❤

Congratulations on your marriage covenant with God and with each other.  My husband and I are believers and Christians and we just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary, March 28, 2023.   Remember to always put GOD FIRST.  We've learned the marriage triangle:  Husband, Wife and at the top: GOD AND JESUS CHRIST.   Remember to seek Him, His power and His wisdom especially in the hard times which all marriages go through in this sin, sick, sin filled, fallen world. Encourage each other, pray for each other.  In loving God first, you will love each other the more!  May God bless, lead and guide you!
Absolutely gorgeous! Congratulations to u both! What are the songs used in this video?
Soooo beautiful!! ❤❤🥺🥺🥰🥰
