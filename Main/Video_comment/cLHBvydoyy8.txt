The guy who's tagging along doesn't have a clue about anything really. Just another out of towner 'creative' living in Hackney..
Please remove that apostrophe from 'locals' in the title, cheers!
Morning Kevin,  This pinned communication has been attacking my Gmail/ Tube account for 1.5 years.  I have made hundreds of blocks attempts...  I ask yourself and your team to respect me and to ensure I no longer receive this content.
The tittle is already a joke
its really nice to see you trying some turkish food but that doner is a fucking disgrace tbh, can tell directly just by looking at it :d
But bro why doesnt he go see some proper British food?
Come to switzerland brotha!
Best food critick ever ❤
You are searching for Turkish food? You need to visit Berlin, not London!
Bourdain would be so proud of you Bronson 🧡💜
I used to live right behind The Best Turkish Kebab, nice memories 🤤
Locals, not local's.
Food is funny, it’s all I think about all day when I’m hungry and then when I eat it and get full it’s the last thing on earth I even want to look at.
"i don't fuck with david schwimmer" my man is spiting facts right here
Going for food to london is like going for for a rest to gaza... The tv shows it differently. See? Meat raw in some dirty fridges, no hygiene, same spice and absolutely basic shit that these programs show as if it was anything special. Zero fresh produce. Zero quality. MEH Put msg, garlic and fat on almost anything and you'll get this episode.
Came here to see London local food, not middle eastern arabic muslim food only. Where is the classic english food and the good Asian food? Or other kinds?
So you've come to London to eat some Armenian & Turkish food 🤣🤣🤣
Guess I didn’t realize so many “locals “ eat kebabs all the time. Maybe in some areas, but I didn’t think this would be strictly Turkish food in one area.
The British get on best with the Americans two classless nations. The British don’t get on with anyone else looking at that video the UK looks like one hell of a poor country.
I used to get lahmacun from a place near EFES for £1.50
hella distracted by the beauty of the co-host
He got me with the Turkish flag and the Ottoman thing. Liked !
Lmao rival webisticks 😂
Take a shot every time dude says "yessir"😂😂
The chef looks like a featherweight Beterbiev, crazy.
Mecha-shawarma
TASTE CADETS COLLAB RN RN RN
I swear action bronson could fit in anywhere man, he’s just lobbing darts in the pub chatting to the old boys
I love this episode it just feels goood
Does he like the food or is he just always stoned
gahh what's the name of the song that starts at 8:25??
I was at the bar with my boy devin and we played darts against some dude's in Korea shit was lit we beat him them foos in a clutch comeback
Why didn’t you just go to turkey other then throwing 6darts there was nothing English about this video disappointing
This is where I live it’s really not a nice place mate trust me 😂😂
A burger from a good kebab shop is a thing of beauty. Don't get them often, 'cause the kebabs are usually too good to pass up?
Bro tried no English food litto all Turkish
IN THE CAPTIAL OF ENGLAND AND NOT SHOWING ANY ENGLISH FOOD. WORST EPISODE EVER. GO TO TURKEY
Sertaç is a legend of the game as well. Mangal II ❤
Hiccups are diaphragm spasms, the best way to stop them is to fill your lungs full of air and start flexing your core muscles (ONLY your core muscles, I don't want you to pass out) real tight as if you were going to get gut punched, holding that for 10 seconds, then relax and breathe out. They always stop when I do that, first try.  The core muscles flexing, plus the chest cavity full of air will stretch out the diaphragm, stopping it from involuntarily contracting. Burping uses the same muscular group, that's why sparkling water which makes you burp helps with hiccups.
us brits know to have a a proper laugh its who we are most Americans don't know how to talk to us we don't bite we are welcoming people even though we don't show it but we will buy someone a beer that's how we welcome people and have a laugh and a chat
londistan
tv above the dart board is a crime
Yo Bronson was in the manor WHATTTTT
Spe t all that moneg on robots still serving pre packaged pitta right away i think avoid
Superkebab is better
Was the Baby Reindeer series shot in that pub? Looks like it
Why are you getting upset and flagging comments for?
01 Adana Restaurant - Dalston Ustun - Dalston The Best Turkish Kebab - Dalston
Is this the guy that dresses up as a hillbilly saying "pass that to me boi?"
7:31 blind guy uses phone?!
£2 Lambachun everyday for lunch from Adana takes me back
Mounting a TV a foot above a darts board is just asking for trouble
The trans am 😂
10:00 there talking about the meat processing machine like its a stripper working a pole.
Which bit of London?
The Army and Navy is in Stoke Newington not Dalston
To be old guys in a pub in London!
It’s all newington green, ain’t Dalston 😂
How the fuck can you smash a full turkish meal, then some pizzas, burgers and a godamn donner kebab in an afternoon.
The host dude talks too much
I'll tell you where the locals eat in London. At home. Have you any idea what rents are like here? 😂
This is where the locals eat, just in Dalston lol
Best turkish kebab is so mid honestly... and such is the case for most kebab shops ive been around east london sadly. Don't go there.
My guy was right next to stokie and missed out on super Kebab /aziziye  Daymn
10:56 The way they touched burgers, like saying "cheers" with a drinks glass, had my crying 😅 Nice video Action and welcome to the manner.
A Great thing about London is the absolute abundance of cultural culinary choice within a few minutes of any given location.
“Oh fuck bro” all the time . Stop it.
my guy you need to go to kaffa coffee next time you're in dalston. best injeera in town. also some banging spots on ridley road market particularly the truck down the bottom that serves these folded up flatbread things that i cant remember the name of since i moved out of the area also rip all island grill :(
Nuclear physicism 😂
Up the newington green! Best part of london
None of the locals eat at these places
You simply cant go wrong with Turkish food.
Some of these places they call Dalston are in Stoke Newington. 😢😢😢😢
Dalston is just the beginning though. Action needs to walk through Brick Lane.
I already ate. Can't be watching this without food in front of me 🤦🏽‍♂️
not in london XD
Have you found a local in East London? The place is like Afghanistan!
That’s not places people eat
As a Londoner I know action bronson had the shits after eating all that kebab in one day 😂 set him up fr
do you eat this all in one day?
Wrong choice for doner
U dnt wanna eat where the locals eat. We eat at the worst places 🤣
ah yes best turkish kebab for a wrap after watching the footy at the Yucatan
all stolen from Lebanon lmao
Why u have beef with Ross😅😅
Haha not a good idea to put TV and darts next to each other
Adana is in Newington Green, not Dalston....wtf is this
The UK's culinary reputation often suffers due to widespread misconceptions, which, unfortunately, are not entirely unfounded. The prevalence of fast-food chains has significantly diminished the quality of our food, offering rapidly microwaved meals that appeal to an uneducated demographic, many of whom still regard having orange juice with a meal as a mark of sophistication. However, it's heartening to witness your appreciation for the rich and diverse culinary heritage our country possesses. Your enthusiasm for genuine, high-quality cuisine is truly commendable, and I am delighted to see such an appreciation flourish.
Cheers to the production crew!
To cure hickuos you hold your breath and apply as much pressure as possible just below the ribs, right into the gut and hold til you run out of breath. Then breath deep at least 5 times. No bs I get them bad and had to figure something out.
Green lanes lahmachun banging in the hood too
to solve hiccups , force air into ur stomach, like swallowing air to burp, then burp, repeatedly.   Cheerios  q=D
Bro! Really? English cuisine? What dish they got they took from other countries while they invade them😂
I'm doing London and Paris shit for my mid life crisis and this channel is fantastic.
@sertacdirik @bambambaklava. smoosh the two of you together and you get a Turkish Empire Cheeseburger. I'll be the meat.
The best British food is Turkish, Indian, French, Italian, Moroccan and Chinese.
Yessir
Mommy won't let me sleep over. What in the actual Fack. More like when your boy don't know the dopeman and he's gotta wait up the street. Bro your slippn
Love this video I get so jealous of the American videos of your amazing pizzas, tacos, Korean style food etc but nice to see a good video on our English shores of what we do well 😊
I am in love with sertac. so fucking charming
Once you accept this man, you realize everything that comes out of his mouth is pure gold comedy. Great editing to lace it all together.
Action, bam bam. come to Montréal Brother. Ill show you around. we do food, Syrian food in Laval MTL, Then we visit galleries for art. Galleria Baklava. let's go homie. it's crazy
loooool hows my house and my mum in the video
Man’s walking in London relishing Turkish delights while cumbia music plays in the background.. that’s right up my alley dude
I can only watch these videos while eating. The food always looks so great. Love it.
Lol why is the TV right above the dart board
the last one is really Bad i test it really really Bad, dont go guys !! But The firts one i test also is really good !! !!  and the second i dont know ^^
Is it just me or does anyone else wonder why they get so much food that goes to waste. They could have just ordered 1 each of the pizza style dish right ?
he really wanted to interview that girl but his hiccups would not allow it
The kebab cutting machine is called "Der Gerät" and is an invention by a legendary German-Turk.
9:41 for the next 15 seconds is amazing
How many times in this episode and others will sertac say "Yes Sir" so corny and americanised its London speak the London lingo and terminology stop catering and trying to be american in presence of americans
Action Bronson you are the fucking man
action is literally a geezer with an american accent, one of those guys u wanna go pub with every weekend
you and London go so well together, you was born in the wrong country mate
That’s the most I’ve heard “yessir” in the space of 10 minutes
I hope this isn't a "how to play darts video" 😂😂 action copping some banter
bro for doner u have to come to berlin its not even comparable the meat the bread the sauces its on a completely different level turkish food in london is good but berlon is different
“I don’t fuck with David schwimmer” -action Branson 😂
Now he's back in England, he's got the green sleeves on too. Perfect.
9:22 Probably invented somewhere in Germany....
Not sure why you would hunt for kebabs in london and not berlin
I'm sitting 10,000 miles away cursing you both! Lol
Hey guys what’s the songs is 9:09 ?
Is it really a kabob if it’s not Persian, everyone knows they make a superior kabob
9:40 der Gerät
the kebab cutting robot was invented by  a turkish guy living in germany i think, at least the most popular one sold.
Tv on top of the dartboard 💀
Yessir yeahhhssir ye-ssssir
Nice to see Action go for long-ass walks after eating bread.
the cockney geezers taking the piss out of Bronson was a an absolutely phenomenal interaction
This is it! 😂
Hounslow west roundabout has a kebab van infront of a mc donalds in an old pub, i miss living there for that spot man Legendary
Complete opposite side of the city but you should definitely try Ekin Restaurant in Kilburn High Road, especially their wraps ;)
Loool seeing Action Bronson walking around the streets I grew up on is strange. Dalston / Newington Green is the best area in London!
Sertaç! Birader are you turned the man Demirsporlu or something, herif eat like more Turkish than me amk daskljfahsdşlfaşlskdf
Stirling Scotland go to tastebudz best kebabs you’ll get in the uk,I  live in England now Nothing compares
I don't fk wit David Schwimmer 😂😂 my man!
I always drink that salad juice love it!!
Not many places can tes Dalston for kebab, only green lanes. Who can remember Mavish on Lower Clapton Road back in day...a good contender.
Mezz grill new Wembley stadium 😊
I think that the next generation will eat kebab as Christmas main dish 😊
Shahi naan kebab southall. You missed the real gem that all Asians know
Turkish food😊
Best kebab is the real winner
This dude is great, wish I could hang with this dude. The best is when he says shït that makes no sense yet everyone agrees with him, prob b/c he’s got a big asš mouth that doesn’t stop.
Thats a Turkish restaurant...Must be full of delicious food.
Экшион любит заточить !!Аппетит всегда Хороший!!!))
6:07 that's the turkish itis 🤣🤣
Action bronson
He’s spot on !
It should have taken in istanbul
It’s called “Der Gerät” Kebap cutting machine invented In Berlin
@actionnronson Mate you need to be in Green Lanes, Wood Green area Bro come on.
"I dont fuck with David Schwimmer"    Hahahaha
10:26 seems kinda expensive for a kebab??
Jokes aside, that is an AWFUL spot for a tv lmao
Love the fact he didn't even ask them until he brought you there, legend!!
Big up army and navy! Best pub in east
Give us part 3
Turkish Food is the Best 🇹🇷🤤🤤🤤❤️
I was happy to see my self driving pass in the trans am if I new I would off stopped.
Hope you had a top time in my manor 😋😃😋
Kabob “ grilling meat on fire or charcoal” 2500 years persian tradition! don’t look for kabob anywhere else, just come to Iran and taste the real kabobs
How much this meal cost??
The doner machine they didn't invent it, close friend of mine is the supplier of those doner robots Total Shopfitting Solutions in London
I’m fuckin starving watching my boy Bronson eat some bomb ass food. I gotta take my ass to bed before I raid my fridge and cabinets lol.
Ill be honest, disappointed with selection of restaurants. There are far better places within the same area, maybe this was down to time constraints. Only valid place out of the three visited is the iconic best kebab.
Glad to see he lost some weight. He seems like a good friend
The fact that nobody brought good doner to NYC is a crime against humanity
How much total cost
Come to Germany if you are looking for kebabs my friend
Kebab in london is absolutely disgusting, come to France
Mangal at Dalston and mangal2 Round the corner from it.. the best kebabs in London
Nah you get fooled :D Best Kebaps in Europe are in Germany. And the cutting maschine was invented by turkish man in germany
Check out Kabob grill n go in Phx Az best you’ll ever have action
‘Look at how he wrapped it’ 😂 superb
NGL i think the dude from mangal doesn't know London that well lmao
Bro come to Turkiye, eat it from the source :D
None of these spots are in Dalston… first couple were in Newington Green, and The Best Kebab is in stokey…
Dint put back on all that wait Bronson
Not the same without clovis :/
9:15 That is the best kebab in Stoke Newington not Dalston two very different areas, Stoke Newington has a mosque and like 20 Turkish kebab shops and Turkish working mans clubs Dalston has no Turks and mainly a black Afro/Caribbean area.
I love turks and im happy bcz they are  living in my country. And im in love all kind of kebappppp
First scene, he's willing to laugh at himself...true test of a real dude...much respect.
Surprised they chose Best Kebab as a spot ngl
he just wanted to taste thehash ishhy haha
As a local, this 100% passes the vibe check. Most yankees coming to London barely venture out of Leicester square and Covent Garden. Places like Dalston is where its at. Also, all of the places featured in this video serve halal meat and the road where 'Best Kebab' is, is like a 2 mile stretch of some of the best Turkish restaurants outside of Gaziantep
Action, smacktion, fracktion bronson
That first platter takes me back man used to get a similar thing with my aunt up at Diyarbakir green lanes it became our little spot, Miss her dearly. Crazy how a food vid can give you nostalgia, makes me appreciate my hometown 👌🙌
Yo AB If u Like some kebab go to Berlin
Surprised that Action and David Schwimmer aren't "friends"
We had my grandads wake in the Army and Navy- he lived in the block you filmed in that very first shot. We got to Adana for every family meal; then you’re there reviewing it?! Crazy! Such a great spot
I  I used to drink in there best days had fantastic biff ❤
yeeeeeeeeeeeees in the ends big love
You should come to Malmö Sweden if you want some good kebab🤝
When tourists say the food in London is shit because they went to all the awful tourist traps rather than beauties like these 😔
Guys please mention the Location in your Feed 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🤤🤤🤤🤤
Dalston is nonsense, look at that ultra processed crap kebab. Haringey Green Lanes is the one. The doner in Gokyuzu is just stacked marinated chicken thigh.
omg Action bronson was in my ends lol
I love how genuinely curious he is about everything, you can see he has a true love for what he does.
Action, take me out to eat. Lol
That Best Kebab doner is bad. You can get much better. The meat is all reprocessed. Not sure about this guy he's with. Doesn't seem genuine.
@ 2:57 wanderlei Silva
come to bristol!!!
gotta hook bro up with some antacids 😭😭😭
Bro are you out of your mind,eat only Turkish kebabs in London beacuse theres plenty of Pakistani ones and that might poison you LoL
visit Berlin here is the best kebab.
Mangal is just popular because of the social media hype and nowhere near the best in the area, you have to go to Umut 2000!!!
A Turkish guy in Germany invented the Automatik Döner cutting Machine ist called „der Gerät“ wich Means „ the Devise „ 😂
These guy must smoke hella weed in between these kebabs man there aint no way yall walking from kebab shop to kebab shop
If you haven't scavenged for hashish in forreign lands i dont respect you.
Old English man in a pub giving shit to Action for his mandbag is the best thing I have seen today!
What do you do with all the leftover food you ordered?
Man, I used to live at the student accomodation that was right next to Adana. Newington Green, what a trip to see you there.
Bronson food tours are the best!   Anyway Dalston Best Kebab was my spot when I was living in Foulden Road.   Really friendly guys working there and amazing to have a late night kebab.
Outer bull he was no longer a jerk
As someone who grew up minutes from adana and the pide shop, i have to comment on that being labelled ‘Dalston’. No one who knows the area would call that Dalston. Its Green Lanes… at a stretch it’s Newington Green… bigger stretch its Stoke Newington. But hellll no is it Dalston. Anyway let me stop being a party pooper and thank Action and the crew for putting well deserved love and attention on delicious establishments! Just get your editors a map….
having a tv above a darts board in a pub sounds like the worst idea
You should have worn a millwall shirt on ya kebab haunts trust me would have made the VID 10 times better !GATE13SW6CREW cfc
That plate of meat looked insanely good
How dare they write Dalston for “best kebab” that’s belongs to Stoke Newington
who puts a tv above a dartboard?
Seein Bronson get roasted instead of him doing the roasting is jokes 😂😂😂
That can't have been cheap but looks lovely
nuclear physicism :D has to be the title of a new Action Bronson song
ROMANIA- DRISTOR DONER-Bd Tineretului, that's where u gotta go
I've eaten kebabs all over the world and nothing rivals London imo
Bro I gotta show u round Essex next time ur over the pond 💨💨 will be on deck aswel 💚🙌🇬🇧🇬🇧
As a Turk I can confirm the only decent place they went to is Best Kebab for a Doner. Which is not considered kebab really for Turks. There are so many better options but Mangal 1 close by would have been much better compared to where they went. Content is entertaining otherwise.
I don’t fuck with David Schwimmer either.
Bronson, Been here 30 years and love a kebab. You have to try Best Kebab in Stoke Newington! And try the Lahmacun, wrap your kebab meats in it 🤤 Have fun in London bro 👊
Love kebabs. In the UK lots of people see kebab as unhealthy. But it’s literally meat and salad. It’s very healthy. Beautiful food, great fresh flavours. Love it.
Best Turkish kebab is in Stoke Newington, not Dalston.
Bro needs to be going further up the road to Green Lanes. So much more better Turkish food up there.
The lahmacun place is da best spot ever chilli lahmacun from there is da oneee
you need to do one of these videos up in glasgow!!
Being born in London and living here for the past 29 years but Action Bronson will birth man on the lowkey food joints... This guy is just amazes me every time he comes to the ends. Immaculate rapper as well. BRONSOLINO  AKA BAM BAM AKA BAKLAVA. Legendary
Yessssirrrrrrrrrrr
This content is so good: The blind bloke with the cane checking his mobile, the geezer almost getting run over to get a selfie, Action’s hiccups, the TransAm at the end. I was certainly entertained. 😂😂😂 Edit: of course the food was 🔥 too. 😂
You say your family is from Manchester, Action. So why don’t you do an episode here?!
Get it right best kebab is in stokenewington n16 across the road form the church.
Is garlic sauce a thing down south because if not you need to have kebab with garlic sauce
action please come to tel aviv to habasta the best restaurant in asia
I need to know what David Schwimmer did to Action Bronson.
Wallahi the best turkish kebab is unbeatable, their chilli sauce is a mazza
Best donner kebab you'll ever have is in Vrisakis palmers green. But you've got to go early as ot sells out super quick.
stick with the small independent restaurants >The 3 big turkish chains in north london launder drugs money
Raavi Kebab Drummond Street North London. Seekh kebab with sauce and choose your bread. Been going since I was around 5 years old
Lovley to see you in the uk big man ❤
Love you bro but you eat too much meat man 😢
the Kebabmaschine was invented by a turkish german guy;)
He went to 3 of the best round the corner from mine.
Action, you got to hit up Turkey itself. I know you love your kebabs and lahmacun and stuff, and I am SURE the Brits make them all well (better than here in the US, that's for sure), but as a Turk, I have to implore you my guy :)
Kebab kid Fulham
Aaaay Dalston!
The Best Kebab is always banged out, sick spot for döner
Oi oiiiiii
Quality content
Sick video of some of my locals, but my only issue with it is, pretty much none of that is Dalston its Stoke Newington/Newington Green ends. Would recommend trying Devran which is across the road from Best Kebab, they aint bad either and their wraps are huge, but nothing beats Best Kebab imo
Wow amazing to see the exact area I grew up in on the show, shout-out the original Mangal on Shacklewell lane
you took him to the average Turkish places in the shittest area too lol
ok LONDON DOES NOT HAVE GOOD KEBAB.
Actions in my manor.
Props for bantering with the proper pub lot at the start although got outta there quick 😂😂😂
"I don't fuck with David Schwimmer" Action proves yet again that he is a man of discerning tastes.
Hard to listen with all the unnecessary swear words
Food looks great but why all the trash on the streets everywhere
host trying to cater to bronsons style is genuinelky cringe
Great to see Turkish food getting more exposure, so good
Anyone wishing to visit these places,it's Green Lanes,Newington Green....not Dalston....and don't go to Mangal in Dalston.....overrated and bland !!!
Didn’t he lose weight ? Lolll
HACKNEY 🙌🏾
Still thinking about the blind stick with a phone
"Nuclear Physicism" - Bam Bam
Best kebab has been my go to for years!!
Action Bronson come visit Bradford UK for food.
Kebabs and lahmacun look okay but that döner is so disappointing. Processed meat, I wouldn't call it döner. Unfortunately, that's what they serve as döner in the UK and Europe, most of the time. For real döner, you should go to Istanbul, Turkey.
Mate you guys didn’t go to “what the pitta” smh
He lose weight?
That döner at 9.30 is garbage. It's basically a hot dog. Real döner, yaprak, is thinly sliced beef on top of each other. What they're selling here is just meat grinder meat.
I live in the area and somehow have only been to 1/3 of these places. Gonna remedy that this weekend.
I’m really pleased to see an American getting into the real London food scene. Fed up of a certain US YT’uber giving London a bad rap and showing eateries that no self respecting Londoner would be seen dead at 🙈. Good you’re avoiding the tourist traps and chowing down with the locals on the ground.
That does seem like a risky spot to mount the telly
how did you not take him to Umut2000
How many yes sirs is this guy gunna say lmao
London Kebabs aren't any good, not even MID, for most wouldnt pay a £1. We're not talking about restaurant kebabs for £30.00, just standard fast food. The Germans and Poles blown em away.
Good old Blighty!
I get full up just watching these shows.
Need to know more about why he doesn’t fuck with Ross from Friends
Why doesn't Action like David Schwimmer??
Go Golders Green likya
PLEASE! What is the name of the absolute banger that comes on at 3:48???? That 80's disco funk is insane!
Turkish food is  🔥
Dual-wielding a kebab and a burger.... Ma man
I got terrible food poisoning from that last gaff, avoid that
Can’t believe you tried “lips and arseholes” kebab 😂
What’s the beef with David Schwimmer?? 😂
Yo fam, that Khabob cutting machine 🔪 is next level 😯
Should have gone green lanes really
best content on youtube imo. watch this b4 i go to sleep
You could tell he was fighting for his life
anyone that hasnt been should know london is home to some of the best kebabs(and worst) outside of turkey  i havent watched the video but honarable mentions are  Mono wraps bt the arsenal emirates stadium  crystal kebab in holloway road  woody in camden   for sit down style anywhere along green lanes(little istanbul) is great  Hala is my recommendation but gokyuzu and devran and antepeliar are all popular   (edit just watche it if you liked adana restruant defo heck out hala its a couple levels above
HOW  do you eat so much
Well I know what I am in search of today !
7:31  the man with the blind cane and on the phone 😂😂
my fave up that way is e-mono behind finsbury park station. hits different. 4.8 stars of nearly 1k reviews.
Action gotta be my favorite human of all time, other than my kid lol
The automatic kebab slizing machine (Der Gerät) was invented by Duran Kabakyer in Germany / Turkey. If you want doner kebab come over the channel, there is the origin.
I will never tire of this series. It's never flat.
Take me to puffcon with you action
Doesn’t matter who you are, English pub men will mercilessly mock you
Man, I am heading to Adana asap for that salad and mixed kebab combo! Dayum!
Someone sign this guy up for a world tour series of this show!!!
Should've hollad if you want the kebab plug
I really wonder what the beef with David Schwimmer is
You can’t use the word kebab and not have Iranian kebab original
Action waving his finger after eating Adana kebab lmao. 10/10 can totally relate
How can a man eat this much! Lol
Action This ain’t choices for the Turkish food you gotta travel to Istanbul for that or the whole country of turkey or you gotta go to Berlin man if you want to eat a real kebab
To have someone say they moved to an area based off your food recommendations is some crazy shit! Action Bronson is the man! 🔥
this first Turkish restaurant man is proper
Bronson never disappoints!
Action Bronson can you do a video at Trill Burger in Houston?
That dude with action is awesome
These are great but whys he go to London to eat Turkish food lol

Wow.....
🔥
A day on the doners. Can’t imagine the turmoil in his guts after that.
how can you do a Kebab tour in London and not go to Haringey? and that Döner cutting machine was invented in Germany
I love this man’s « yessir »
How’s Clovis?
i fkin love this show
Super Kebab had the machines before BTK did
I'm convinced Action needs to go to Japan and just go crazy
‘Yezzirrrr’
9:33 EINF DER GERÄT hahahaha
Is it a real kebab shop if you don’t get called “boss” every 5 minutes
Action getting roasted by a bunch the most stereotypical pub blokes you could imagine is so good. Those kind of guys couldn't give a fuck who you are they'll tear you a new one!
It’s best when he goes London 🇬🇧💙
life goal to be as high as actioin while scouring the uncharted food gems of the world
I love going on a food joint runt in London.
Epic! Mouthwatering kebabs and international glowing - had to show huge love in the Attack The Culture 'Videos' section - love the content and keep the fire videos coming, Brosolini! <3
Always funny as always . That döner looks so good
The hipster scale is off the charts .
take the manbag off 😂
"Holy shit trans am??? Why did that just roll by??"
Why this guy look like Ariel Helwani
Streets gave me Shaun of the dead vibes.
"Nuclear physicism" *signals in Italian*
I never knew the thing I craved the most in life, was having another man hand me a doner and then hand me a cheeseburger, and I just double fist that. What a way to live.
Honestly go to western Europe for the Turkish food
Turkish one is the best version of every dish in the region. Best baklavas, best kabobs, best flatbreads, lahmacuns you name it. Turks effn perfected every dish in the region. I’m not saying the food in other countries are bad it’s just Turkish food is on whole another level.
Watching this eating ramen noodles and Doritos with chocolate milk. One day I will be able to afford a meal such as el baklava
why the hell he is not fucking with david schwimmer?😂😂😂
Peace from California! ✌🏽
0 chemistry between these 2 😂
Bring back Body
Makes me happy to hear Action Bronson doesnt fuck with David shwimmer
Action's Crazy Town Butterfly reference is such a deep cut
everyone should have at least 2 Albanian mates! at leas 2
Damm action I'm bloody hungry now
Dam yo!!! That kebab slicer at The Best Turkish Kebab is next level yo!!! Fk, that is a industrial slicer yo!!! 😆😍🤣😂 Action was like. What da fk am I watching right now? LMFAO!!! 😆😍🤣😂
Sup Mr. Action Bronson. On the hunt for kebabs, also on a hunt for other things from the Ottoman Empire 😆😍🤣😂👊🍻🍺
Need more Clovis
The content on here is so manly , I’ve been upgrading my masculinity by every drop Baklava blesses us with .  My appreciations Mr. Action .
It is absolutely hilarious that AB and his boy were at that window staring at the mechanical Gyro slicer making orgasmic noises like Kebab Cucks🤣🤣🤣. Damn I love these vids. Everyone should experience Mediterranean food once in their life
Kikoi
My dream is to randomly meet Bronson on the street
“I’ve never been depressed for longer than 6 minutes in my life..”
All the spots we grew up eating at especially best kebab legendary
Lol at his murse
Don't loose your time eating left and right... Go straight up to a Lebanese restaurant for the real tasty food🇱🇧
Im pretty sure super kebab just down the road actually had the AI doner shaving machine first but then best kebab got theirs soon after. I was going best kebab since I was like 8 years old!
I LOVE THIS SHOW! VIVA LA FTD!
Yo peep the unc rocking the one direction merch at 2:57 doe
Bam Bam Bacchus
Died at the how to play darts video / murse banter. Miss that London humour
I hope to see some Old Kent Road footage soon,   Lebo Kitchen - where the queue goes down the street 365 days a week.  El Marsem - Albanian cafes where the footballs on and guys are screaming over dominoes matches going wrong. Milk Bar - for mad baklava  Not forgetting the Latino spots, the north African joints towards New Cross, double back round thru Burgess Park to Ahments, london's best Pie & Mash.   Come onnnn... @thebeefgeezer
Why does that bloke keep sayin "yezzzzzzzir" is he trying to be a yank?
‘nuclear fizzizzizm”
The price of the glorification of gluttony.
the mangal finally makes perfect sense of all restaurant. a charcoal bbq grill and a pizza oven... the perfect combination for cooking everything
7:30 bro saw you with his 3rd eye
Why do I watch this before going to bed?
Best Turkish in Stoke Newington 🤌
gotta be honest i miss the old kanye
We need longer videos, I could personally watch these episodes for an hour at a time. Keep it up!!
❤ these episodes
That crazy town reference was awesome.
Action, congratulations on being a badass dude with tastes of a Lord from food to whines & your way of life. Double your editing teams pay because they also do a good job.
Never craved Turkish food before today - that all looks delicious holy shit!!
“I only get depressed for like 6 minutes, tops” 😂😂😂
Turkish food is amazing 🔥🔥🔥🙌
Gazoz will fix them hickups 😁🤣
Bro the way the people in the kitchens just GRIPPING tf are of ppls food is crazy 😂😂😂
Does anyone know what  bag Action is wearing because that shit is fire.
the man said take the man bag off ……you can't be cool after that.
That first meal looked crazy! 🔥
Love how Sertac said “It’s the reverse Goodfellas” when the guy brought the table to the outside of the restaurant for them 😂 7:51
I need to tea on bronson and ross tho
Beautiful
“I got the motherfu**in hiccups” 😂
anyone got a website made of all the places he’s been to and what he think?
What a fantastic vid! I lived in Adana for a few years while serving in the Air Force. Some of THE best food Ive ever had. Borek? Please..soooo good. The best treat was the hot bread (ekmek) and some goat butter. We ate kabobs so much. The pastries..baklava....just some of the best eats.
AB + HIGH FOCUS RECORDS COLLAB WHEN BRUV
NO MANS EVER HANDLED HICCUPS SO GRACEFULLY
bro you need to come to vienna!!! i'll guide you and provide the cali grade za ;)
I want the cheeseburger 😢😊
LOVE Sertaç's enthusiasm with the food just like Action... takes a delicious bite of something, "OH F**K bro, you gotta try that"
*NUCLEAR PHYSICISM*
7:29 what's with the blind guy lighting up a cig and looking at his phone lol
I see they've perfected Kebabs there.
Amazing bro

that transam was on some different shit
Der Gerät!!
I'm so hungry after watching this episode lol
i love watching this amn interact w all kidns of ppl and cultures man hes so kind
Action needs to go to Big Has's for a Sunday BBQ session.
@Action Bronson you should link up with JESSIE from @TopJaw while you're in London.
Pakistani food or you ain’t serious
Grifting again . We see people for what they are.
This better not be a How to Play Darts video hahahhaha
Oh boy did you ever pick the right guide man, top marks
As a kid, my parents would drive in to Glendale, Ca to pick up Lahmajoon from a restaurant in that area . I’d say it’s been 20+ years since I’ve had it . Thanks to this video, I’ll be on the hunt next month when I’m in Ca! Cheers!
Jazz playing in the background is top tier 👌🏼👌🏼
This man single handedly changed my entire palette
Doner kebabs should be enjoyed after a solid 10 pint day session Action. Great sober, unreal after a session.
dont ever stop droppin these!  👑🥘
Bronson lives the life
I miss body
I don’t think I’ve been depressed more than 6 mins in my life… Action pleaser teach us your ways 😂
AI Technology! ...Action got glassed in the first bar.
Great to see The Best Turkish Kebab on the map. They really are the best Turkish!
Shit is always 100% legit

Green lanes stand up
ACTION that food looked awesome and bet it tasted awesome!!!! GOAT forever!!
The blind guy looking at the phone, easter egg special
Tiabs commercial road banging

He should’ve gone gokuzu   in Green Lanes 👌
How can action not fuck with Ross?
7:32 wait a sec how can this guy use his phone?!?!

Yo, for real, I love watching your videos especially after work. Be having me in a relaxed state immediately 😆. ❤
" take your man bag off" ha
why do you guys never try traditional english food??
He went to my usual in NG 🙌
Bro I’m not gonna lie action loves food so do I that’s why I watch this shit but let’s be honest it’s not like he’s gonna eat something that  isn’t good can’t really take his opinions on food seriously
Don't understand why u want kids to eat that garbage
I see Action gaining his gains back 💪 😆
I never thought we would see Action wearing a purse
Shout out to LASSO
If Bourdain, Zimmern, & Big Pun had a son. Bronson
Favorite show
Bro you putting in work, salute and congratulations
Action Bronson trifft Der Gerät
impressive 7:30 🤳🏻🧏‍♂️
Lol action point out the trans am at the end like why tf did that fly by 😭 it’s a fair point there’s not many muscle cars in the uk let alone old ones
bro, action,  i'm begging you pleaseeeee make these at least twice as long, pleaseeeeee!!!
best food series shoutout my home town
Two teaspoons of sugar in a glass water,and after you hi cup you pound it.💪
Watching Arian the bro Bronson devour plates of meat is like watching ocean’s waves hit the shore,it’s so natural.Cheers from the motherland 🥂
How in TF did they eat all that?!
those guys remind of the men of bree and shire folk from the lord of the rings. Good people!
can the dude stop saying yesirrrrrr
🇦🇱🇹🇷♥️♥️
Were can i buy actions Merch please let me know
Turkish and Indian food in London is legit
"i dont fuck wit David Shwinmer" 😂
All that looked amazing, meanwhile watching these episodes eating things somewhere around the ballpark of the quality and expectations you would recieve from some pizza bagels..
The Best Turkish Kebab is Stoke Newington, not Dalston.
floppppp yo action this guy not showing you the real. how can he show Turkish culture and not go green lanes ?????l he just took you to Times Square instead of dyckman park crazy.
love how bronson pretends the most basic food, is something  special. cant take this guy seriously no more😂
Bronson mixing with the locals. Love it. ✌️
💥💥💥💥
The best kebab store in london sells fake kebab! Hahahahaha😂
Does anyone happen to know the track playing over the top from around 4:25 😁
Got a feeling that bloke wasn’t blind
The 10 minute mark..🔥
7:29 😭
Please come to SACRAMENTO
I want to know what went down between Action and Ross
🤟🏼❤‍🔥
Hey action I e always wondered.. what do you guys do with extra food? Cus I would get full way to fast
Actions skip at 1:30
God damn why can't I run into Action Bronson when I'm cycling around East London??
Mad cute when Action hiccups 6:24 like a bebe 🥺
Working these episodes out like a man in the groove. Action youre golden
seems like Action and the food guide didn’t really gel well with each other
🔥
Action! Gotta throw a food fest in London and get everyone involved
Man i just ate my dinner 5 mins ago and now im craving some good doner kebabs thanks to you action... Great vid! As always! peace
The only thing this episode missed is beer alot of beer
Every episode is always fire 🔥
Love how you always visit real food places, none of that gentrified dogshit just real good food!
Yikes, that guy has a strong accent. Needed to turn on CC to catch half what he said.
Bronson looking like a true brexit geezer
That’s the most English pub I’ve ever seen at the start of the video “oioi we’re the boys!” 😂
Ah man I felt that comment about not having hash 🤣
g you cant come to dalston and swerve the caribbean food!!
Love
Class as usual
Action is slowly turning into a sort of food icon. Sort of in the same realm as Anthony Bourdain or Andrew Zimmerman or guy fiery
This made me missing my beloved Turkish food, yani!!! 🥺🥺🥺
Don't try to kiss me with your lips all chalky In the Trans Am, you could feel the kicks from the horsies
the old men saying take the man bag off in the beginning though haha roasted him " i hope this isn't a how to play darts video" 😆🤣
finally a turkish restaurant. god bless you action
Yummmmm😮
Love this shit Action, could binge watch these all day
Yessiiirrr
Sertaç "Yes sir!" Dirik 😂
So glad Bam Bam passed by best turkish
Drs in the house
to me this series is on par with Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations content-wise and just the coolness of everything
I see an FTD video and immediately click on it. Action is food video royalty 👑  straight up...
Kind of disappointing you came to London and only hit up Turkish spots, once you’ve been to one or two good kebab shops you’ve kind of done it all. London is such a diverse melting pot of cultures and food, just shame you didn’t hit up more of a range of places.
Colocaram Samba pra tocar na hora de apresentar o primeiro restaurante(turco) UHEHHAEH edição chapada.
That trans am rolling by was a legendary moment
Yeeeeeessir
10:45 holy fuck I would tear into that I need it shit
This man is a legend in the food game. For real love this series.
Action B, please make episodes 2 days in a row or something please you would do 99,9% a favor because this is just to good and therapeutic for the stressing mind nowadays XD
The camera panning to the blind Turkish man casually burning one is perfect
Helal hoş olsun dostum in Dalston 😅
A trip to London is required every 3 months man. Linking up with local legends. You knock it out of the park with these recommendations.
Why in the world are you eating like that? That ain't cool
Best kebab is 💩 they lost it from co19
When we bringing mayhem and alc and big body back for an episode
incrível o horario q isso ta sendo dropado, exatamente no almoço no brasil
I love that Albanian-Turkish connection
so nice to see the Adana spot is still going strong!
I don't fuck with David Schwimmer
Every episode = God Tier content 👑👑👑
The guest kinda looks like that one dude from hiatus kaiyote
Why no David schwimmer?  Is it because he was the most unlikable character on band of bros?
Best Kebab House is Stokie, surely.  Big Up.  Yung Baklava in the ends 💥
Cool af
Live in London and here to see where my next food journey going to take me, AB you’re the man
Take off the man purse lmao
Very delightful 😊
Keeeeeeeeeeeebabs

Turkish Delights are sweets!!! DON'T MANDELA EFFECT C.S. LEWIS!
