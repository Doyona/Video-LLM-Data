DAVID MILLER and marco janen👌🔥👑💯
Australia saying at the corner to South Africa - Ok you just take all the series and we take all the trophies and worldcups. 🤣🤣
cricrt my love
Star Sports should be ASHAMED of those graphics.

New channel guys, need support badly :(
Seems strange. Why are there blacks playing for Suid Afrika?  I thought they were banned?
Australia 🇦🇺 ko  Hartey ho dekhne me maza aata hai  Kiyo ki ye log India 🇮🇳 team se bahut  Baimani kiya hai
Man south african women so beautiful
1.33 camera view
I don't think qdk liked bavuma that much
Bavuma nikalo yar koi achha player lo
Temba bavuma is a real hero❤❤🎉
Apna kaka Is great player 😂
Zampa ko to miller ne kampa pila diya😢😢😢😢
Bavuma unfit player should be retire
Australia play too fast if aus have played little slow than they would have been won all 5 matches
Keshav maharaj hanuman ji k bahut bade bhakt hai
So South Africa wins ( 3 - 2 )
2:42 what a sixes  by miler 😮😮😢 , surya ne catch pakad liya 😅😂😝 varna kya haal hota 😂😢

What A crowd , this is even scarce to see in subcontinet if its a bilateral series
https://www.youtube.com/@YogiUK011
Millerrrrr
South Africa wins the series Australia wins the World Cup
😊😊
Kesav Maharaj👍
Congratulations south Africa team all members
i'm indian , pak vs india matches are nothing in front of aus vs sa
India should also play 5th match odi series with australia england south africa like old days  t20 destroy everything
Now if this was India, everyone would be saying : it’s only a bilateral series India doesn’t the win wc tho😂: but everyone is completely complementing sa
= 85663
I love South Africa cricket
Missing abd faf amla
*AIDEN MARKRAM* ✌🇮🇳
South Africa crash Australia in series But get out by Australia in knock out
A review is goo and bad. In all fairness in my opinion SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. WHETHER ITS UMPIRES CALL OR NOT. IF THE BALL IS GOING TO HIT THE STUMPS ITS OUT.....
As an Aussie, I’m not really impressed in our performance. We couldn’t get going with the bat, and unfortunately marsh has had bad captaincy. I don’t think they’ve tried the best they could in the last 3 games, we lose wickets to much and that’s what brings our batting down massively, other than that I just want to say congrats South Africa for winning the series.
Aiden markram 2nd best after ab devilliers of sauth africa cricket
Why temba babuma always out by 0 run
The previous  was big ...thats even  bigger❤❤❤ mpume commentary  is amazing ....good batting from phehlukwayo
Andile Andile ❤
Worst player of the decade temba bavuma
Australian cricket team best team in world👍
Brilliant south africa 🇿🇦 👏 ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉

ICC Trophies in last 5 months : Josh Inglis=2 South Africa in all of 30 years = 1 🤣
Maharaj bhai.. Siraj nhi...
This type of reckless batting and collapse was needed by Australia in World Cup final .
Well done S.A. We Love you. Keep up the good Spirit.✅🙈🥇🥇🏆🏆🌟🔥👌🏾💪🏽✊🏾🙌🏾🙏🏾👏🏽❤️‍🩹🥰👍🏾🕊️🕊️🍾🥂🍾🥂💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Enjoy the bat sound 😂😂😂
South African cricket & Rugby is the only time you see a diverse crowd come together like this. I wish it would be like this all the time, imagine how powerful a nation we would be if it were the case... Government should take moments like this to drive our country forward but no Corruption is the only Song they know 😢
Eng teams looks the most strongest on paper.
Faf du plessis and no in South Africa South Africa no win world cup he is an important factor player no political in cricket mark Boucher you are stupid man respect faf dup and request him please join the team tima bhovama is any in your country but ABD devilliers and faf dup only one one pace your country God send him only for cricket and you re same on u 😢
6:05 Those 3 towering sixes from Phehlukwayo were awesome ❤
Marleen best batsman
Maharana is is good baller 👹

Salute for Quinton de kock❤

A fantastic series ❤
This SA vs AUS odi series reminded me about sa aus rivalry back in 90's between Hansie Cronje & Steve Waugh....all odi series those days  between these two countries were played in the same intensity like this particular ODI series...but one has to still remember this is not a full fledged Australian squad without Cummins, Starc & Steve Smith...
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lift the world 🌎 Cup❤ South Africa❤❤❤ 2023 this year❤
Mitch marsh will be the game changer for Australia in in 2023world cup  Might be a chance to win the man of the series

Wow Sa
Once again  SA v AUS produces a legendary series
India has too see South Africa team becagse they are looking good they can be dangerous. For Indian team
After a long time to see a good and perfect spin bowler Mahraj ❤ Great Bowl🫡💙
Keshav Maharaj should be preferred over Tabraiz Shamsi as he can bat too.
Nice
🤑😈
I hate Australia , SA well played❣️
Who asked to bring back that dump Bavuma, there's no good from him. Team SA played brilliant without that silly captain...
Happy to see head wrighters aunties got thrashed
South Africa on fire 🔥❤
this is the last inning of de cock or not ?
I thought quota system ruined sa cricket
What a win! What a win
The innings smashed by Phehlukwayo was catch my mood over the moon 🔥

PROTEAS FOUND A NEW ALL ROUNDER   WHO IS CONSISTENT IN JANSEN. HE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE THIS TIME FOR THEM.
Happy to see 👀 cheater aussies lost the series 🎉
South Africa is back good to see they will be one of the favourites in the wc
TEMBA IS SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE BEST CAPTAINS IN ODI FORMAT OF CRICKET. CONFIDENCE HE HAVE IN HIS TEAM IS IMMENSE. PLUS HE IS ONE OF THE BEST PLAYER OF SPIN BOWLING.
Where is the venue???
Proteas are doing great 👍. Favorite in the world cup❤. I absolutely love Miller's batting. What a player he is❤❤❤
Babar Azam will break record of sachin and virat and he will make new records of 200* Century❤
SA fielding man❤

What a catch by DeCock ..superb efforts in weeketkeeping ... SA team performing very well as a team unit .. wish them good success in the upcoming world cup 👍
Dekock's call of single to Buvma was bizarre.
sa now in good condition to 😅
That six from miller like a bullet wow❤
in this match Tempo Bomma wicket cannot throw and take the Wicket because cricket spirit missing Aussey so you lose the game
Hoio
Not markram show.... Its jansen show...🎉🎉
9:33 what a catch. One of the best wicketkeeper of this decade. QDK quick de cock ⭐
ab ki bar bavuma ki sarkar
WONDERFUL 😀❤
Good performace SA Team All the best SA  WC2023
9:30 commentator utters Labuschagne name as, something like 'Labuskafi'. Probably the way it is uttered in South Africa.😀
Wow🎉🎉🎉
Steve Smith Glenn Maxwell Pat Cummins Mitchell Starc Josh Hazelwood  Australia lost with a second string side for sure
Brilliant
Your intro and outro animation sucks 😂😂
This batting line out of SA is brutal .happy to see SA playing like this
I really like South Africa. I can never forget the 2003 World Cup. I will definitely come here one day to watch a match with a beer in one hand.
Bat speed of phulekwayo 🔥

I was there on the ground for this match
Can Janson be Next Jacque Kallis??😊
But SA will choke in Icc world cup,,, that's the main problem
Apart from Bharat (India), I would like to see two teams winning the WC 2023 South Africa and newzealand.
What an intent for the aus team. They copy the eng formula 😅bang bang ❤
If only SA would put a stop to this affirmative action BS and drop Bavuma, they'd be unstoppable. Look at how good they are with only 10 players + walking-wicket-Temba
Congratulations south africa🎉👏 . Love from India ❤
SA peaking at right time💚
Who is lady commentator? Her commentary is brilliant ❤
Amazing batting, bowling and fielding by the South Africa team what a comeback 😍

Nobody praised decock, he caught tremendous wonderful catch in both match. Those were just stunning!!!
SA has a very balanced team for world cup, just need a bit of luck
Firing middle order  Lower order contribution Chipping wickets at regualr intervals Excellent fielding  This SA side is a team to beat in the WC

Who said Odi cricket is dying, just look at the crowds at Asia cup and this match...what a crowd support SA looks such a dangerous team with players of this caliber, sad luck does not favor them in icc tournaments Aus's weakness is death bowling and if the target crosses 300 mark they fumble easily.....other teams are noticing this carefully

Full credit goes to bauvma for being run out.😂😂😂😂
What's with the thumbnail of the video
Fantastic series win by South Africa ❤ great Play
Currently only sa have best no.4 middle order batter Aiden Markram 🔥🔥
Markram surely one of the player to watch out in wc
भारतीय ये मैच क्यों देख रहे हैँ?
The great team SA, why the hell the didnt win the world cup.. Why god why!!
Ese run out me appeal hi nhi krni chahiye thi
India Bharat  Is the Best 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
No words
My favourite team after India❤❤❤ go proteas
The way Marsh hit those pulls to sixes thats look so effortless and superb .. Miller is in killer mode  Markram is good middle order player  Well played South Africa..
See you again Quinny 💔
SOUTH AFRICA IS BEST ❤️
😮😮😮😮 Miller the killer of Sixers 😮😮😮😮😮
South Africa fielding always best
Ugly a*s animation
What a great comeback by South Africa. Great series
best way to ruin the highlights put who won in the description phucking muppets!
Where is thumbnail girl😢
Great bowling by Hindu all rounder Keshav Maharaj
SA, Aus, Pak, Eng all look strong now, gonna be good competition for India in WC.IDK what's gonna happen for SL and NZ  let's see.
Miller killer
Best fielding side ever ⚡
Beautiful Natural light Day match
What's with 4:55?
How has a team like SA never won any WC is baffling
4:55
What a crowd! What a match! Fully passionate and mesmerising day.
These highlights are shit. Jansen got 40 off 20 balls and you only show one boundary from his knock.
Congratulations south africa what a winning ❤
This time for africa🔥
Thumbnail is the secret for extra 5 lakh views
A team to watch out in the WC 23
2023 World Cup Winner :- South Africa 🇿🇦🎉
I think faf duplesis should be in the world cup squad.. instead of Bavuma faf n de cock can open.. because both the players know the Indian pitches very well..
Yesterday Two things happened, Siraj destroyed SL , And jansen 🔥
Australia  played just attacking cricket no player wants to play longer version. They wanted to play like t20 game. This team needs player like labusange and smit in the middle order.
9:32 ..How the commentator pronounced Labuschange😂😂😂
Next match Ind Vs Aus ❤
i still don't understand the fact that even after performing well in bilateral series against top teams they are still choking in world cups and icc tournaments
David Miller the beast,,, so underrated
Who sees that girl in thumbnail 😂😂😂 again and again
What a Series guys 💪💯
Fielding of sa in whole series was amazing ❤🎉
That's why I like 5 match odi series. Someone performs bad at first, then they rise at the end of the series like they know where to improve themselves and where to, and pretty much that's the career defining moment for the rest of their life...
I m very sad for Quinton de cocks retirement😢
Bangladesh win over south africa. But Australia can't
This is what expected from proteas
nice thumbnail
Wow what a beautiful comeback to lead the series n get the trophy
I think a lot of people need to take a step back and realise how good 50 over cricket is
Congratulations SA from IND
Australia😅😅😅😅
Now  a days David Miller is one of the most destructive batter in middle order positions. The way he hitts flat sixes is really   impressive and it's carry how  strong his hitting and timing ability  with perfect execution .
Miller is such a pure heater of cricket. It's sad to see SA management has ruined his carrier .  He should bat at no4
Can't wait india vs aus
4:54 Thumbnail 😂😂😂😂😂
Too much aggressiveness is the main reason of Australians defeat.

Because of South Africa Pakistan is again in the top of ODI  Thank you South Africa 🎉🎉 Pakistan No 1 ODI team
SA❤from india❤❤😍
South africa is back
If miller is that from in world cup become dengerous
I think top 4 teams for wc 2023 1 Bharat  2 England 3 australia 4 SA
Tim david should only be in t20 not in odi
2015 SA vibes
adam zampa missed back to back century by 29runs
Impatience and immaturity clearly shown in this Aus team
This time only two team looking good one is England second is India
Who all loved phekluvayos hits ♥️
Congratulations Keshaw Maharaj 👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉 and the South Africa team 🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
Australia you need to improve a lotttttttttt
Congratulations M Jansen 👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉
sa is looking to much dangrous for coming odi worldcup
What a finish 🎉🎉🎉 by Andile Phelukwayo🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
South Africa should show the same performance even in world cup.
SA are very comfortable against Australia, West Indies and Sri Lanka They can beat Aus and WI even when they are down in dumps.  But ironically England is the team who troubles SA the most. England are thrashing SA in tests and ODI's since 2015-16 . In the 2023 WC, SA would choke against any of these Eng/NZ/Ind/Pak.
Indian team is all set to take the world cup title 2023❤️
Congratulations David Miller 👏👏👏👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉
Thumbnail dekh ke kon kon aya hai 😂
Very very dangerous team 🔥in 2023 worldcup in india
Is bar world cup South Africa ko hi Jitna chahie

South Africa 🇿🇦 is back…RSA ALL THE BEST FOR WORLD CUP
Star sports know how to make thumbnails. 😂😂
being a cricket fan i just wanted SA to get back at rhythm they used to be. I want old African team back and finally they are. The only team left out of is West indies. I want them back too. This is the real cricket when the old giants will be back in form
Amazing what a match of series decider and RSA win this match and odi series 🎉🎉
Well dom sa
why aus playing t20 in odis lol
Don’t underestimate this South African team for the upcoming world
SA hammered aus looking like very dangerous side for world cup
Alex Carey should find a new job.
Respect button for Mohammad siraj❤
Congratulations team South Africa
Sa come back
Name of girl in 4:55 minute
Emotional moment for quinny 😢
In this tournament I liked to Klaseen , Markaram and Marsh ❤❤❤
So main weapon to disrupt SENA batting is spin
This is the last odi game of Quinton de cock in his country 😢
Nice come back of sa
Tim David is not suit for ODI squad...
Sa are making a habit of bouncing back from 2-0 to win the series 3-2
This world cup may have something to offer for South Africa
Thumbnail is awesome 😎
Looking at both teams from world cup's point of view they are going to pose solid fight against India, Mitch Marsh as an opener can do damage if not dismissed early, Warner had a good IPL in India this year too. Decock has been known to score every time against India. It'd be a wild game!
SA though, are known for choking, they do have a team now to challenge other teams in the world cup.
thats callled cricket man  . best of luck to the world cup team south africa
124-2 to 193-10...keshav maharaj + jansen 💥

This WC ...SA's batsmen are threat for bowlers on India's flat pitches 🏏
Green, daryll mitchell, mitch marsh,  johny brstow and butler.......just stand and smack pacers like..hell😂😂
Congratulations to South Africa for its winning one day series....one flaw I reckon in South Africa team that is  bowling Africa should search a bowler like Allen Donald,Dale Steyn ,ntini genuine fast bowler and introduce all rounder like lance klusner.
This type of South Africa we needed fearless and ruthless 🔥🔥🥵
An india vs south africa in the final would be a treat to watch 😊😊😊
I'm coming to see the girl in tumbnail 😜
Cummins. Starc.josh.smith.maxwell
What a team what a series. This is more impressive to watch than ASIA CUP
The shouting and hooting in the crowd z🔥🥵ohh man they are lucky to witness this match live in stadium
Both are great 😊 experience captain for both the teams Mitchell Marsh for Australia and Aiden Markram for South Africa. Both these teams have a rivalry with each other since the year of 2018. Australia won the 3 T20I Match Series 3-0 and South Africa won the 5 One Day International match series 3-2. ❤😮😊

What a clean hitting by Killer Miller🔥
🎉🎉🎉Finally South africa 2-0 behind  What a come back 3-2 win siries  Markram miller
Is puri series' me chmapa bohot piti hai 😂😂😂
Marsh should realise that its not t20,
Thumbnail...
I think Jansen will have a good CWC. A good ipl contract as well.
this was the actual Australian batting and in reality the reason of Australia winning is their consistency on keep continue till the end of the game they dont give up if other team also do the little hard work like South Africa did in this match they can be win easily.
I opened this video because of Thumbnail😂😂
South africa has one of the flattest pitches… so many 400s have been scored here
SIRAJ 👍✅
Power of thumbnail 😂
These are the mighty South African that everyone says them chokers. What an effort! What a spirit! What a performance! I love South African cricket team because of Mr. 360.

Feel bad for temba he is such a great man but not much respected by other south African becoz he is black

Just what happened to marco jensen ,gut hitting ball like a beast
Marco Jansen is a gem. He has a great future.   Well done SA.
Are you using thumbnail to attract people?
Congratulations SA
Marco Jansen vs Aus😮
Inspiring performance from proteas.They have very good batsmen in the form of Markram,Decock,Miller,klassen and power hitters phehulukwayo and marco jansen. Their fast bowlers are world class Rabada,Noritze and Engidi and jansen.spinners samsi and keshav maharaz.definitely sa is well balanced team for 2023 worldcup.from 0-2 to 3-2 and winning the series is truly unbelievable.as an indian fan i wish to see india as the champions.if not india then it is proteas i wish to see them as champs.they deserved the trophy in 1999 worldcup.very unfortunate for them.all the best proteas for 2023 world cup.Thanks for star sports for good coverage of highlights.
If they want to free from choker tag they must need to play spin well then  south Africa became  very dangerous team😮 ..in this  world cup ..

Me to larki dekh ky dekhny aya tha 😅😂😂
Zampa gave 6 sixes in his 10 overs. Super bowling, keep up the good work
This dekock sometimes looks Irritating and Selfish
Warner ❤️
🇿🇦🇿🇦🎉🎉🏆
South Africa is looking like a complete team now. They have genuine openers, solid middle order and fearsome ball strikers. Plus they have couple of good all-rounder and a good spinners too. They are making the semi finals easily. I am not sure of Australia though, Warner is past his prime, Tim David is a liability, Carey lacks oomph, Zampa is ordinary. They need to play Marcus and Smith in that middle order and get a better spinner.
Thumbnail😂
Congratulations ✌️ sa cricket team 💪 Very strong come back & 2/3 series win against Australia,,,, From Bangladesh 🇧🇩
History repeats here tooo remember  Ind 2 vs aus 3 😂😂😂😂
What a comeback and what a series win for South Africa before world cup.
Mitchell Marsh Hitting Like Monster
That is massive win. Africa was down and out but they come back  brilliantly.

So happy for SA who truly have announced their arrival for CWC 23
Bavuma is looking too small in front of Marco Jansen 😂😂
How hard Miller hits sixes
Any one knows about this girl?

I'm Indian but I love south african winning movements
SA deserve it
Congratulations south Africa From Pakistan ❤
Last game de kock on SA 😞😞😞
south africa is the best team in the world
New SA played like old SA
Still you didn’t understand why Australia hide their star players
What's with the thumbnail? 😂
And thus we are actually seeing revival of teams like South Africa, Sri Lanka, Pakistan in exactly that order.
Keshav Maharaj is such an amazing spinner!!
FUCKING FEMALE COMMENTARY....TOOK THE FUN OUT OF THE GAME AND THAT CRAP IS THERE ALMOST THROUGHOUT THE GAME.
Australia cricket & March captaincy worst ever
Thanks to SA to win the series against Australia .
Respect for cameraman 🫡🫡🫡
Will tim David get more chances in odi cricket. This was a big opportunity for him this series.
Fix tha😂 just joking
Well played Markram & killer miller ❤
What the actual fuck are the first 2 seconds of this video? Takken 3 wtf was that?
Aus ab apna ghussa ind series pr nikale ga world cup se pehle 😂
What a come back by SA. I want SA to win the WC this time as they richly deserves it. What a captaincy by Bavuma. I think they got very good players. Watch out for David miller and Klessen, they will murder any bowling attack on their day.
Congratulations S A .......from Pakistan
South African white players always unfair with bavuma this proved that today
Well deserved match and series win by SA. Outclassed the aussies when it mattered. 9:22 says it all, "One wicket brings 2", has been the theme of most aussie innings' lately, bad decision making and no desire to protect your wicket. Carey's dismissal unlucky, when looked at in super slow there is a bit of doubt whether WK caught it cleanly but hey was given out...
What an energy in this match...😮😮
Phehlukwayo should come in at 7 rather for sure.
Confidence builder series for South Africa❤
Keshav Maharaj bowled wonderfully.
Now India's turn to defeat the Aussie buggers !
If South Africa can remain consistent like this, I think they can make the semis of the WC, maybe even go further. They have a well balanced team
Coming back from 0-2 and winning the series 3-2 it's not an easy job... But South Africa did that and that too against Australians... Respect button for South Africa...
Worst player nd worst caption of all time cricket bavuma
Guys, if the square boundaries are so small then suryakumar yadav would be the run scorer ever, like just keep hitting it over fine leg over and over again.
The thumbnail 😭☠️
West team Australia
I have to say Australia top order if they click they are on fire ... and they have woken the sleeping bear in SA
Proteas 🔥 that is the best bowling performance from Marco and Maharaj ❤👏👏👏👏
Markram miller de kock klessan bhavuma this players should be in form all the time if they can be then it will be deadly team
I want the Proteas to at least play in the finals in this World Cup.
😊
Markram 🔥🧡
What a game of cricket is❤️❤️
10:58 look what happened to umpire after giving an out😂😂😂😂
You give away the result in the title again. I couldn’t watch it with any suspense.
Probably the best atmosphere for game .
Wishing similar defeats for Australian team in world cup 2023 👿
David Miller still has 🔥🔥🔥!!
Who's here after Asia Cup fixing?
What a batting collapse, from 135/3 to 193 all out.
What a find phelekwayu by south africa. Very handy All rounder he is. Congratulate Team South Africa For there Remarkable Serious Win Against Ausis.
Finally SA didn't choke thank God🛀🤲
Horrible commentary, it's like listening to fans commentating on their favourite team. It's supposed to be neutral guys.
Southafrica come back ❤️❤️❤️
Well done South Africa.
In whole series all sixes was brutal and massive oness
टीम बवुमा...
Is RSA's T20 squad really imbalanced? I can't believe they lost 3 in a row in their own soil and can't even showed any competitive match 😢
We miss you decock
SA are more than favorites to win the ICC ODI WC 2023.
Inspiration  team  South Africa  I LOVE  INDIA ❤
Come on protea 🔥 cheering for you most in the world cup..👍  India, Protea & Nice guys from Kiwi ❤
Thank you proreas and thank you bokke for flying our flag high. Today was a good day for South Africa
Khaastor pr Indian k muh pr... because India me kuch ganduu logo ko lgta h ki cricket vhi khel sakte h
It's a series win for South Africa because it reflects that black has also guts to do everything that white can do...
This was a proper thrilling final 🔥🔥  Phehlukwayo shots were mind-boggling 😳🔥

Greatest of all time ! well Played SA ! ❤
This WC, SA will show his beast mode.
In the past few months, Aus have blown away a 2-0 Ashes lead and 2-0 ODI series
no starc no Cummins no hazelwood
Fantastic W for SA and Maharaj- who was a Maharaja with 4 wkts.
Bhai ladki dekhne aya tha pura match dikha diya 😂
Can South Africa win the upcoming ODI world cup???  Fingers crossed…
Australia overconfidence mai haar gaya series 😂😂😂😂
Best of luck for world cup my favorite team South Africa🇿🇦❤
Wish SA wins 2023 WC, my childhood dream
Bad ass. Bring on the world cup.
Ye kab se shuru kar diya bhai starsports😅
Missed timba's shots, quinton is ignorant, couldn't he see?
Wassay bhai ki prediction Shi Nikli what aa comeback South Africa
I like South African cricket team
What a superb comeback by South Africa in the last two matches. This ODI must be if not the then one of top 2 ODI played by South Africa
Australia got killed in last 3 ODI
Markram plays such a glamourous shot damn😍😍💯💯
Worst camera work in a cricket match. Worst.
Congratulations SA ❤
Why is Auatralia playing a B grade team? And with all the all-rounders in the team, why do we persist bowling players who are being demolished by South Africa?
Every team is coming with attacking batting approach, good allrounders  and good spinner except Pakistan :P. Shadab khan looks very bad if we compare with all front line spinner of other country also Faheem wont even fit in Zimbabwe team
9:44 what a catch by QDK🔥🔥🥰
Congratulations South Africa
Gerald Coetzee needs to go back to the drawing board.
One of the best odi series in the recent times , we need such bilateral series for odi to survive
Cricket is never a gentleman's game from the perspective of Australians.   Bavuma got injured badly in the rib cage, then also they were having super fun after getting the wicket 😊 nice gesture from team Australia.
And some seasonal cricket fans thinks ODI cricket is "boring and dying"😂😂....we have got to watch some outstanding thrillers in this ODI season everywhere.....
Markram 🔥
Well-done south africa congrats, all including me never thought they would win something with this line up but they did, give miller at 4 if u want better results
Crowd🔥
Yeah series australia jan pouch kar hara hai teen match jo south africa un teeno matches mitchel marsh toss jeet kar batting pitches par bowling ka faisla kia
Brothers Congrrs to d win nd welcome  to a G21🎉
South Africa has a very very good side ready before wc. Solid batting unit. Jansen, Phelukwao allrounders. Add Rabada and Nortje to pace bowling. They just need another one or two quality spinners along with Maharaj and part time Markram.
In this series Australia become South Africa And south Africa become Australia
That's amazing performance by south Africa down but not out🎉🎉great win
Congratulations finally feeling well n satisfied 😂
South Africa next target to pakistan 😅😅😅
South Africa all time win again Australia all time
South Africa big team  no Australia

Wow brilliant performance by South Africa, absolutely love the African-American crowd 👏 congrats boys

World cup competition looks tough this year 👀
Remarkable Comeback 0-2 down ODI & Historical Returning 3-2 Clinch Series Aussie Hand🤲
Fantastic. What a superb comeback.
Australia worst form I ever seen 👎👎👎👎👎👎 I think Australia don't have ability to play 50overs match?? last 3 matches all out in 35overs this is worst Australia team I ever seen 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😌😌😌😌😌
South Africa 🇿🇦 looking good for the  world 🌎  Cup   ❤good luck hope you win the cup this  ❤from Pakistan 🇵🇰 😊
Well played south Africa
Oh god jahnson and phelukhwayo playing odi like t20😂 Bc ye kya tha... Wtf was it bro.... They were hitting sixes like nothing... Dho diya yaar
The boys are back!!!
I hope I am wrong but this World Cup belongs to South Africa
Congratulations Africa....  You did it what a comeback after 2-0
South Arica is  useless away from home, especially subcontinent !
South Africa's team is very strong, it is among the top teams in the world and it has very good players.
How is Carey still in the side?  After his 'cheating' humiliation in England he is averaging about 8 with the bat.  Broad was right...
I wish SA plays this way upto WC
wy bondries very very small this
Bhai intro Mei kya ghatiya graphics the😂😂😂
2:44 how 😮😮😮
Sauth Africa always go to the semifinals but didn't go through the finals
South africa 100% come back
Neser will never play international cricket again
Good thumbnail buddy😂😂
Timba babuma is my favourite batsman ❤
What a brilliant comeback from South Africa (2-0) down to win (3-2).."WoW"😉..Good luck to de'kock...🤗
Not a chasing pitches in south Africa.. Whomever will bat first is likely a winner
What a perfect series❤.
Nz ya sa m se koi jeete wc ..
WTF has time David done all series. The selection for our ODI side has bamboozelled me. How we could throw a 2-0 lead just makes me annoyed with CA. Inglis, David, Stoinis, Neser had no place in this side from the beginning. Shame on you CA.
Would love see SA win the World cup...Please SA this time atleast....🤩
Tim David send out
Miller ke shots yr❤
Congratulations to Team South Africa winning the series     🇿🇦  3        🇦🇺  2
We can't take SA lightly, they have some absolute world class players
I'm not gonna lie, I already wrote off this series after the second match believing that our team was not ready for the WC, but they proved me wrong. Bavuma's batting hasn't been the best since he became captain, so losing him early might have been a bit of a blessing. This game was won by Markram, Jansen and Maharaj. Good job boys.
South Africa is really special.
The AUS decline continues...  Their worst side for a decade
Thank you for the highlights star sports. Please upload highlights of World Cup matches too
Poor Highlights 👎
*9:29**  FINALLY someone pronounced his name correctly  LABUS-KA-KHNEY*
South Africa is like RCB ❤❤❤and Australia is like CSK
That's called fight back South Africa 😎🎉
Whenever the tail enders give some boost at the end just like pheklukwayo did at the end, its always a morale booster. + jansen eliminated the top order with the help of some amazing catches by fielders. This match was amazing to see. In some short time ODI cricket is peaking n its going to be thrilling this 2023 WC. 😮😊
I don't know why this bavuma plays!!🙏🙏

Australia is a big tournament team. They always bring their special magic and win tournaments.
Keshav maharaj love ❤from🇮🇳
I am happy that arrogant aus team lost this match and series as well. No sledging worked out here for aus team 😂😂😂
At this point I’d rather have Lucky and Jansen in rather than Coetzee
How beautiful south african grounds are world cup should be sceduled here
aussies getting thrashed wat a sight
Aus... What was so urgent... You had 124 in 20 overs... Seriously
Listening to the crowd feels like I'm in a concert...what an energy 💪 SA 💥

Excellent bowling by SA.. they bowled very sensibly
Cricket is back at just the right time Eng vs Nz,Aus vs SA and Asia cup

Superb bowling by jansen and Maharaj
Congrats South Africa
Rip spirit of the game ..When it's bavuma run-out😮
Bhuma dont deserve place in african team
I just love cricket growing
Maharaj 🔥🔥🔥
Can’t lie that run out is the dumbest things I’ve seen from QDK. Bavuma should’ve stayed his ground.
De cock is such a bad person not just a one incident but multiple incidents
Realy i cant understand Whts gng wrng vth Australia?last 3mtaches aft won the toss y he decided to bowl fst?I thnk this is the reason Australia lost the match
What a poor display of cricket in last three matches by australia, they are playing odi cricket like t20 means u dont have technically strong player  just a slogger 😊
What a loud crowd!!  Good to see South African cricket on a high after so many years❤
Its like a feast of a series for a cricket lover. Smashing sixes, brilliant catches, making records... So much fun
Greatest SA Team: 1.Hashim Amla 2. Quinton De Kock(G) 3. Jacques Kallis 4. Faf Du Plessis 5. AB De Villiers(C) 6. David Miller 7.Ryan McLaren 8.Dale Steyn 9.Morne Morkel 10.Kagiso Rabada 11.Imran Tahir
South Africa should carry their form in World Cup too.
Why South Africa didn't play with pink jersey
Well done SA❤
SiRAJ 5-5
World जितना है सपना, फ़िलहाल Asia है अपना
SA Srilanka newzealand beware of these underdogs
I have a feeling Aus will again win WC
Australia This coach will be eleminated if they want to get cup. Warner, Ingles, David should not play in ODI. Khawaja, Smith, Labuchagne, Head, Michel Marsh, Maxwell, Stononis, Camroon Green, Carey, Starc, Hezellehood,Zampa(Extra). This top 11 are needed to play every match if Australia wants to win the ODI world Cup 2023.
Wonderful thumbnail 😂❤
Marco Jansen is second Chris Morris for sa❤
Aidenmarkram is the best combination of hitting and defensive abilities
Shout out to thumbnail 😂😂
Oh god shamshi with his celebration
Australia ki chiell k rakh di😂

Australia ki chiell k rakh di😂
Congratulations
This is sa 4th consecutive odi series win vs Australia
phehlukwayo ...wow..what an innings for South Africa ..awesome hitting out of the park
Aussies are making it a habit of finishing the series on a low
What a thumbnail 💀🗿
SA is on fire this WC ❤❤❤
Amazing crowd support💚
Smith Gibbs, Mark Boucher, Morne Morkul, Albie Morkul, Hashim Amla, Jesse, South Africa, it is a pity if the team plays like Kenya and no one is ahead of them like the Lions.
Thamnil Mai ladki star sports bi tharak jama raha hai
Why Australia played so much attacking cricket in this series??Attacking cricket has cost Australia to lose this series and by huge margin of runs....Were they copying England????
Finaly some satisfaction to see rsa again in thier true form
Protees are back... loved it from India❤
What a comeback by SA team.... congratulations ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Australia's premium spinner conceding too many runs.. a part to worry for Australia
Every team is playing attacking cricket now except our Indian cricket team in batting
Well played both australia 🇦🇺 south Africa 🇿🇦.
The shouting waves at the Wanderers is just unbelievable ❤
Aus don't play this free odi series in serious mood😂
Quintion signature selfishness by running out bavuma
Quinnies catch must be best of the decade.
Was this qdk last match😮??

Need character to win the series after 2/0 down in the series......well played proteas
all mentioned about markram and other but Miller was killer and consistent for SA for last two years
I think de kock is the best keeper after dhoni because his batting feilding review etc
Congratulations 👏 to southAfrica
Well done boys.
Sa finally realised that they are playing in home conditions
Fact is sa is not a competitor of Aussies...but how it's possible..I think Aussies team selecting committee is totally failed...captianship was not good.....I think without smith Cummins khawaja head..Australia will b waste team ..
The girl in the thumbnail such a cutie  We saw what you did there
Everytime they seem to be serious contenders for the wc and this time tooo
Such a pathetic calling by Quinton De Cock , Bavuma was in pain and he called for a run😑
India will hammer Great ready kostrulia
Bavuma ko faltu out krwa diya chappal se maaro de cock ko
What a comeback by sa 🎉🎉
What a crowd 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well deserved loss for AUS! Thank you SA! Great performance! 🎉🎉🎉
What a match , what a series.. More valuable and entertaining than Asia Cup.
SA ko bahut ko bahut help hoga
bro used girl picture for more clicks on this video. btw i also came to watch that girl lol
I think Aus take this series as a practice match,this is very sad
Phelukwayo ka batting style dekh k usse as a batsman promote karna chahiye, world cup mein SA ko nahut help hogaya
South Africa ❤ world Cup winning contender ❤❤
Congratulations 👏 South Africa 🇿🇦
Proteas Always On Fire 🔥🔥 Favorite Team 😘  Love from Bangladesh ❤
As a pakistani my team is punture  So im suppoting south africa to win world cup
What a flashing comeback 💥 from South Africa squad that to after losing first two ODIs to Australia. But in last they won all three consecutive ODIs and a massive series win after destroying the lineup of Australia. 🧿
Star know want we want thumnail 😁😁
De Cock is a star WK.
Indian,,but wishing SA to win this world cup..
David’s international career is over as is Neesar and Warner.
And What did this woman do?
Ingliss,,,green david should be dropped
Well done SA.
I became fan of Millar.look at hitting against zampa
Timba 🙌👏
গ্যালারি ফাকা
For me zampa will be the player to watch in India world cup
David Millar on 🔥 look at his sixes mind blowing
David Miller is my favorite batsman ❤❤ love from 🇵🇰
Who made these shitty graphics
Marco Jansen is one man army here, great crowd support and great comeback by SA
Well done Themba and the boys, not forgetting the management and staff, keep the spirit flowing 🎉❤💯🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
It's was not about Markaram special...it was all about Marco Jansen Show.
Star sports knows how to get views from Thumbnail 😅😅
Good luck boys, until another choke in world cups 😁
David miller fan from india❤
I dont know but last 3 matches gave me 2006 series vibes where south africa chased 435 target on this same ground
How many are here for thumbnail Girl😂
Lot of missing  faf  du plessis bating  nd style   then I m remember old match Smith gibs any one knock against aus   today sa  team bating line up much better to be better  I think sa  big fight in wc
Miller is really killer
South African Team deserve A ICC Cup
Bavuma army in great momentum. Hopefully either it's India or SA. Not aus, eng, they've already won too many
That catch by decock gave me goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥that’s why sa is my favet team❤❤
Old cricket is back
It will be a exiting world cup....🎉🎉
Thumbnail 😂
Phehlukwayo most underrated all rounder ❤❤❤
Seeing de cock calling for run when bavuma was hurt tells why he said he is mentally 20 by age but physically 40
south africa can be a serious contender this wc
Australia In bilateral Always Like that 😂😂 and them In iCC event s😅😂🎉 they beat the shit out of Everyone 😅
Even though I was a bit unhappy today being a big fan of David Miller that he did not hit any convincing boundary against fast bowlers but it is still wonderful how despite being a no. 6 batsman, he has an average of almost 43 now and this year has scored 5 fifties and 1 score of 49 out of 10 Odi innings he has played.He used to be very On and Off till 2019 but he has been extremely consistent in both Odis and t20is(especially Odis) since 2020 scoring a fifty in almost every 3rd innings.His wealth of experience in India can be a huge plus for SA in this World Cup.
What a co incidence.Australia in the last 3 ODIs just batted 34-34-34 overs
Briliant captaincy by Bavuma. Marco removed the top and middle order mostly via short ball but when tall heighted batsman were on crease, he brought in Maharaj and boy oh boy he did the job beautifully. Congrats SA you have been outstanding. BRAVO
Chokers choked the aussies
What a series win for SA 🔥
Thumbnail😂❤
🎉proteas
This always gives me goosebumps
I m for thumbnail
I love this commentary ❤❤
How on earth is Temba bavuma getting chance to play for SA?

What a come back by south africa
Thumbnail girl sooooo beautiful
V good bowling Africa
Take ben macdrmot as a wicket keeper batsman. Josh inglis is not a good wicket keeper batsman
ten and a half men !!!!!
Brilliant comeback by team proteas from 2 down in the series to win 3-2 Stunning performance
When Miller connects..then it's always a big six
Sa welldone inshallah world cup south Africa jeety ga inshallah
A good team effort in the last three! May long it last!
SA well deserved this series❤😍
I think coming ind vs aus series is not needed for india....player get tired ...
Wtf is the intro😂
Yrr ye bavuma kyu khelta hai
Congratulations proteas ❤🎉
Tim David is not at odi level yet
Congratulations team SA 🇿🇦
The dislike button for De Cock...    For money and t20 leagues not playing for South Africa representing cricket board
Congrulations S.A.
Three consecutive victories with 100+ runs margin to win the series with that experimental bowling against a team like Aus which has a good bench strength. This SA team is ready for the WC
What a come back by South Africa Just unbelievable 😮😮 they played very well 🔥🔥💪
Fire the cameraman.
South africa team doesn't need any trophy to define his legacy 😊
Gosh, the opening graphics look like EA Sports Cricket 2001 😆
That girl on thumbnail on 4:54
Where the Thumbnail Girl ?💀
What a comeback from South Africa after trailing 0-2 down to winning series by 3-2 de kock should reverse his retirement decision this is the vintage South Africa we love
thumbnail <3
And this is what i want from the proteas... WC is comming guys
South africa made good come back 🔥🔥
Never drop the catches is the biggest lesson behind fall of great teams
What a match , I think south African crowd with their voice boost the team to won the match
aussi, english, NZ and now RSA, all are equal weight team!
Dear south Africa and Australia siraj miyan or bumrah apka wait kr rhe h
Nice blur bkl star sports
Keshav maharaj hindu lion
Well played sa
Brilliant series by sa
I don't understand why players are leaving international cricket you can't get such an amazing atmosphere in franchise cricket 😢
Why no body is talking about marco jansen?
02:20 Zampa Revenge from Klassen 😂
What a Great Come back by Proteas. And What a Bowling by Marco Jansen. Can You Believe That!
Btw   *Admin knew very well what he was doing🤣💀*
very good playing batting mitchel marsh ji soooo handsome bowler adam zampa ji ,. shaun abbot ji  🙏🏆 ☀🍦
Dhoni's and de cocks wicket keeping are like chefs kiss such a presence of mind and and hardly missed catch
🥢
Better than shitty asia cup final
This green jersy is lucky for them i will suggest to there board members they should remove yellow color from SA jersy , i have seen mostly when they wear yellow and green jersy they loose there matches and when they wear full green or pink jersy they always have good luck for won i guess there board members should take my comment seriously and should work on them or they should consult with good astrologer..
Much more better series than fixing Asia cup match.
What impressed me the most is that Jansen got the guys that absolutely smashed him in 3rd odi.
very good playing south africa  very good bowling marco jensen ji 5 wickets very good telented bowler marco jensen ji 🙏🏆 ☀☕
Markram has something special
Australia gonna be getting 10 th place in wc 😂
South Africa great comeback
Nice thumbnail
South Africa are best in ODI series but not in Worldcups.With this same team they will loose vs Australia in upcoming worldcup in Oct 12 2023.
Power of thumbnail 😝😝😋
Best wishes for World Cup 2023 to South Africa
MaHaraJ !!!😊❤
4:53 What about that For Success Means for Success People that Why Editor Put her for Thumbnail.
Mil
Left handed batter is like Japanese Katana.         Miller.     Clean 🗿🗿🗿🗿
Those shots by Phehlukwayo were so decent.😮
quinny😞
They also shown we are coming for World cup
World cup winners Australia ❤❤
SA FIELDING IS ALWAYS IMPRESS
Good to see SA unbelievable come back
Australia have 3 problems in this WC 1. The Captain P Cummins. He is not good to even get a place in the white ball team. And Steve Smith is way way better than him. 2. Alex Carey. All other teams are going to the world cup with proper world class batsman but Alex Carey is not up to the mark. 3. They have built a Balanced team but you need the Best team to win the world cup. Why Marcus Stoinis and Sean Abbot are in the team is beyond comprehension.
Semi finalists are - IND , Aus , eng , sa in this world cup , new Zealand and Pakistan look ordinary
Worst.... performance by Australia.... This is not an Australian team.... Neser,Tim David...Abbott .. upcoming worst players....
*Keshav is in good touch he will be asset for south africa in the world cup*
Good job So quickly. Upload highlights
Good job So quickly. Upload highlights
Luv seeing protea play and win like this , obviously against other teams not India
Phele Asia fir world cup mai flag laherange
Sa deserve icc trophy🏆🏆🏆
When Markram and Daryll Mitchell and Mitchell Marsh play shots like these they look like Beasts 😮
Whatttttttaaaa comeback from temba bavuma  SA & TEAM...from 0-2   to. 3-2 & winning the series 😗⚡🤝🤘🙌 knocking Aussies down
Miller six and attitude 😮😊
Siraj 1 vs 6 sri Lanka 😅
Today Siraj siuuuuuu 🤍
Cricket back South Africa 😮
Today I saw miya magic 😉👍.....
Miya Magic at Colombo  Marco magic at Johannesburg.  What a Finals indeed 😍
Miya Bhai finals jaldi khatam karne ke baad yahi match dekh Raha tha 🤣. Ismein bhi Aussie collapse...
Positives for south africa from this series going into the world cup: 1. Batting ( everyone in the top 6 made big scores in the series). 2. Spin department ( maharaj and shamsi were really good  ) Concerns: Pace bowling( no pacer was consistent although jansen performance today will give some confidence) but SA desperately need nortje fit before the wc.
What a great comeback from the proteas, they are on absolute fire 🔥
Pommie sounds like a porn star. Ay hessss, beautiful
Beautiful thumbnail
