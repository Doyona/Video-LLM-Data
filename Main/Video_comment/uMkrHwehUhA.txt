GET OUT OF THE LEAGUE KYRIE
Can't wait to get a new roster of sports reporters...You all tried and have failed spectacularly...Never seen anything like it...Good luck hiding but you have taxes that need to be paid
I guess people are allowed to kneel for a flag but they're not allowed to refuse a vaccine is that right you piece of s*** Shannon??? Shannon Sharpe you're the biggest fisherman's Bob on the wave of public opinion you have no thoughts of your own... you're perfectly fine with taking this man's rights away just because everybody else thinks it's fine you're the worst of the worst!!
Kyrie sitting at home listening to all these nba players being on covid protocols after all being vaxxed
Hey lame Sharpe you eating those words now..🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙈🙈🙈🙈
They R so one dimensional, one of the hottest topics in the NBA right now is how the Cavs are bringing big man basketball back! Lebron or the Nets 7 days a week I'll pass
Kyrie Irving setting aside his pride means he a professional taking accountability, and Kyrie Irving returning back to the Brooklyn Net's is his best option's
Kyrie will b there 4 playoffs they aint slick They know he dont last a full season because of his injury history so they r save n him...
Kyrie may have ended his career with his unpredictability. No owner is going to pay him millions of dollars then cross they're fingers and hope he shows up.
No vaccine no pay life mess up 🥴😢
I’m not sure Kyrie wanted to play w Harden ever since they got him he started missing games
Like we know Kyrie, his moods and unpredictability..except him to unceremoniously come back before 2021 ends🤫
Kyrie Irving has dug in like a Alabama Tic
Its not Kyrie fault James Harden should be a elite scorer.
Shan , Skipper how come the old school 🏫 players never had any of these problems? They just played.  Played.  Played. And won. Wilt played all his career.  Bill had 11. Bird was pure shooter. Pete carried ball to super market.  Jerry had his whole body on a ball. Magic had aids and came back.  Mike didn't make money till he was grey. Chocolate thunder broke back boards.... Iceman was hopping everywhere
Kylie is a man and makes his own health choice any team that don't have stupid rules in there state would love to have him
Make NO MISTAKE, Shannon & the rest of you FAN BOYZ/BRONSEXUALS are STILL sore Kyrie left y’all BOO-THANG LeCon😂🤣
These guys value sorts over life!
Many players  havent got the experimental jab
Kyrie Irving is just not right for the NBA and won't go to work,their paying him 35 million and 200 million for what just to sit at home collect 200 million
I don’t see why they are so confused.Its a crossroads.They or anyone could come to one.The network may do something they are strong,y against and they would feel.I don’t agree with this but I don’t want to give up this money.People don’t see everything the way you do.There are people that if Trump was President and all this came down.They would refuse the vaccine(Though its by the same people) and would call him a tyrant but now that they are comfortable EVERYBODY SHOULD DO IT.
Well Kyrie needs now to come back or just retires. I believe  in what he's doing g but he's taking up space for another up and coming star.
Kyrie...Hmmm Maybe I'll Go To Work Today Maybe I Won't..🤔🤔🤔..The World May Never Know😴😴😴😴💯💯💯💯🏀🏀🏀🏀
Kyrie A Champion, he Rich, I really don't think  he Cares about What Anybody Says !!!! And That's That!!!!
Kyrie is not going anywhere, there trying to pull a fast one on the league. He’ll be back with the Nets after the All Star game cause that’s when most stars take the game serious.
😂😂🤣🤣
Kyrie you’re a legend baby.  Shannon is just a crusty old dude who took the jab.  There was no requirement in the NBA to take a jab when you joined the league.  No one else can decide for you, this is supposed to be a free country.  You should retire and start your own league - who wouldn’t come play in the KBA
Mark 16:9 King James Version 9 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
With all due respect, I bet that @ShannonSharpe, and all of blk sports’ talking-heads are not allowed to treat @AaronRodgers12 , with all the same Sickening vitriol & disrespect that they treated  @KyrieIrving with!
Earth to everyone, there are bigger things in life than basketball. Respect, family, God, freedom. Everyone has lost their minds. These two men have lost a sense of reality, this is America the land of the free. Since when does basketball dictate what you do with your life or even me as a fan, how can I criticize a man for making a decision with his family and personal life in mind and not his job. LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, does anyone know what that is anymore.
Kyrie and ben coming to big 3 soon
Win or lose he is still his own dam man  more so than skip and Shannon , Barkley , Shag, Sten A. , men and woman.
Who wants him???  Even though he retracted, he still believes the earth is flat.
I think it;s inevitable thta he;ll retire when all is said and done.
Stop trying to force that so called vaccine on people and he will would play. Shannon is a Uncle Ruckus!
Take your money and invest it - Trade that!!
Shannon missed Kyrie's point
The man doesn’t want to take the vaccine. You making it seem like putting an unknown substance in your body is a small thing.
Defend lil nas x for his confused mind but trash Kyrie for a set mindset society 2021
Contract makes the law. I am sure that vaccination is not inside his contract. If he chooses not to get the VAXX so what the man should be doing his job he is getting paid for
I really think nets going to be fine, they can get another nice piece with what they get for kyrie, Harris, cam Thomas, claxton, and possibly brown.
Shannon you're an bih clown for this b's... I stand beside Kyrie Irvin, his Bodie his choice.
Pseudo-intellectual - a person who wants to be thought of as having a lot of intelligence and knowledge but who is not really intelligent or knowledgeable.
KI is one drama after another. Not worth the headache.
if you cant standup for something the n youll fall for anything no mandates  Lob=ve you Kyrie keep rocking for what you beleive in
Any team that you put Kyrie Irving in they will still have to deal with him not being vaccinated for one, for two, Ben Simmons is a defensive player Kyrie is offensive so that isn't really an even trade the nets would be better having somebody that can score. I like the idea of levert going back to the next but I don't think there's enough stuff there Worthy trade-wise but I like the idea of him going back to the nets Kyrie can make whatever decision he wants that's fine it's just the fact that if it's going against the NBA policy he has to deal with that
I am so tired of all the African Americans on these sports shows all talking crazy and sounding all crazy like this guy
Shannon always keeping it real
Dawg Unc!  You buck dancing too bru?
I thought Fox used to be the freedom channel 🙄
I thought Fox used to be the freedom channel 🙄
Unfortunately this is not a who's right or wrong situation; sadly were programmed in life to make a decision after hearing the facts of a topic... this is more of a personal choice type situation which means that it shouldn't get any response publicly on T.V out of respect for Kyrie if it's really his choice to make on his life...... God Bless!
I'm not sure what's wrong with Kyrie, but he doesn't get the responsibility that comes with being guranteed more money than a small country for playing or not playing basketball for 6 or so months. The other side of the popular argument " people have a right ", is THEY DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO INCREASE OTHER PEOPLE'S RISK OF COVID! Which is what people do by refusing to get vaccinated.
Explaining yoself to people who don’t like you gets you nowhere. Kyries not going anywhere this is just another talking point
The ablaze pea anecdotally scribble because sort psychologically transport atop a faded frame. majestic, rhetorical plant
Trade Karen Irving  to Africa for J cole and some Ethiopian food!!!
Great discussion.
He can go play in Texas and florida let’s be real higher power exists
If he leaves than he can't play anyway. Honestly without Kirie or any other all star. Nets don't stand a chance. An no Ben Simmons isn't even good. That's how you know Skip wants Lakers to win another chip. You can honestly tell that both of them don't care about Kirie Durant and Harden winning a championship.
I subscribed just to unsubscribe.  These two have just been banned for life.
kyrie, the voice of the clueless
So tired of Kyrie Irving. I went from a fan to being on the verge of just flat out disliking the guy. He is so entitled it’s incredible.
People need to understand its bigger than basketball.
Russ for kyrie!
Kyrie needs to buy a doppelgänger just for vaccines.
Bye Kyrie lmao
Life is bigger than basketball. Just go get Tuskegee’d  because you want championship. You sound stupid as the statement. Ask how many people what in it and what it dies they cant tell you. They are just all volunteer guinea pigs in the end. Then they mandate the world to be part of a trial basses for the shot. Because know one knows what effect it would have on you after 2-3 years. Double doe’s for real.   Look up the patent for the corona virus vaccine in November 2019. The same month the announced the release of the virus. How did Obama and Dr faulty know this administration would have this pandemic? Big red flags! I dont trust it at all. Anyone with a brain should know that. Look it all up. How did I call out everything since the release of c19  that would happen. Because if you paying attention and doing you research it tells you things. I called the election. I said harris aBiden would mess over black people. Harris said i will not do anything in particular for black people. Then turned around and did for asians. Claiming asian hate like it compares to the 400 years plus of black hate. About the mandates and how the economy would crashZ because all the vaccinated could not support the whole country. What i did not for see is its all on purpose. But these are all the greatest minds in the world working together. How did they not know. It’s impossible that I knew and they did not.. Its not anywhere close to a logical sense..
Stand for something or you fall for anything. You still need to call in. No call no show is a no go!!
The same thing their bashing him for later down the line they’ll be praising him for what he did💯that’s how things work in this country they’ll milk you for what you worth.
The same thing their bashing him for later down the line they’ll be praising him for what he did💯that’s how things work in this country they’ll milk you for what you worth
Leave the man body alone daaam we don't live in North Korea
Maybe I’m naïve but I didn’t expect this kind of stance from Shannon. I think more often than not misery loves company, and those who took the jab want everyone else to establish those who regret it. You aren’t allowed to use certain words to reference it on the internet or you’ll be censored & even banned; there’s been a number of cases of Bell’s palsy; miscarriages; testicular abnormalities; blood clots; heart attacks; deaths, and more side effects all with a convenient waiver of liability form you have to sign before their experiment is shot up in you, and you’re CONFUSED by why he says this isn’t about the money? Nah, we’re talking about people too smart to be that dumb
The problem with this situation with Kyrie is that it is another in the yearly situations with him. There are people praising him now that probably wanted him thrown under a dungeon for allegedly wiping his feet on the image of a leprechaun last year so this whole folk hero deal with him now will not last when he goes tipping at another windmill.
I know it seems like a pattern but kyries injuries have been unfortunate…when he did take time off for mental health or whatever it seems worse because these exact arguments…they use his injuries against him like he wouldn’t have played if those didn’t happen lol
I would choose Jrue Holiday any day over Kyrie.
Nets are stupid for not trying to trade Kyrie for Simmons. Simmons has EXACTLY what they need, elite defense and score in the paint. Iamgine him having all the spacing in the world and getting easy drives to the basket. He 'll get his easier 20ppg of his career, while also giving them a leap in defense.
I hope Bucks will repeat. If not, I would like GSW (now that they don't have snake KD, they are likeable again) or Phoenix or Denver.
I guess championships and money is more important than someone’s health decision. This wouldn’t be a topic if there was no mandate.
Support for the vaccine is POLITICAL. If you talk negatively about a vaccine that was thrown together in minutes, you get death threats, calls, and bullied. Nobody talks about those who have a "Super Human Immunity" to the virus. Look it up. Kyrie can neither catch nor give the virus any more than vaccinated individuals, so what's the big deal again?
Nobody wants him at a high price.
Non-conformity issues? Much?
They spent this entire segment devaluing kyries career and its trash. They are true idiots and shannon lives under skips porch and has butter biscuits in his suit pockets
To this should show yu how everyone is programmed. Kyrie is standing for the Meaning of America. Land of the free HOME OF THE BRAVE. Kyrie is brave enough to step up to the system what happen to Americans y’all got soft asf
Trade him for a bag of syringes
Foh, so if Kyries the person that has adverse effects to the vax then what? F... y'all and Shannon Sharpe. I have the right as long as ya'll agree?.  Shannon's a buck dancing go along to get along clown.
This man said be a pro.  Being a pro is letting people tell you what you can and can’t put in your BODY??..Shannon you c$$nin right now.  NBA ain’t everything.  There’s somethings more important than money and sports Shannon.  Principles and personal choice
NBA IS ALL ABOUT BASKETBALL..NO ROOM FOR STUNT OF WANNABE HERO.
If the Nets are really serious about winning a championship, what they need is someone who can guard Embiid and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Identify the best player in the league to handle that task and that's who they should trade Kyrie for.
A man whose worth over 75 million has backed himself into a corner you can't make this stuff up😂😂😂😂
I think KD is a great basketball player. The biggest difference between him and Lebron is Lebron seem to be smart in making his choices. KD seem to always make the wrong one. All except going to GSW to win 2. Then he made the mistake of leaving. So yeah, i think KD has made too many mistakes in his career. His talent is top class tho. His latest one has to be going to the Nets with Kyrie lol. Could have teamed up with someone way better and win titles.
whatever team signs him, they deserve what they get
I feel like kyrie is tryna be Jordan when he retired to go play baseball 🤣🤣🤣
The streets stand with kyrie 10000 percent
i am a fan from Europe. This was a truly honest and to the point take from both Shannon and Skip. Being from Eastern Europe, if you pay somebody that big of a pay check, and he takes the work absolutely unresponsibly, when millions of people are becoming unemployed in America and Europe now with the pandemic, i dont know man, getting fired is the most logical thing here tbh.  i wish him the best , but...
Health ISSSS wealth. No experimental jabs for me.
What is Kyries actual reason for not taking the vaccine🤔? He’s taking a big risk for such a cause
This is the first time a player gets talked about more than LeBron😂
TALKING ABOUT THIS MAN BODY EVERYDAY .. NEW AGE WEIRDOS .. TALK SPORTS NOBODY CARES ABOUT THESE 2CENTS 💎
This is *BIGGER THAN* your  team. Kyrie is a *MAN* in this instance. Shannon need to roll his lips back in love the sound of his own voice.
Strange that ESPN pundits aren't allowed to put out vaccine related deaths and serious adverse reactions many have experienced from the shot, probably why Kyrie don't want to take it and he even seem reluctant to put that data out there
What does pride have to do with you not wanting something  in your body that is clearly  experimental... one body that's it!!
Kyrie is one of the most highly skilled NBA players. At this point neuro test is much needed than the vaccine. What is wrong with him?
Kyrie Irving is the last person I would look to for any kind of social consciousness. The guy literally thought the earth was flat. He gets all his artificial knowledge from YouTube conspiracy videos instead of reading a book with facts. And boy does it show. He’s not deep, let alone awake to the ways of the world.
Shannon thumbs down 👎
Look, this is the point about Kyrie Irving and I quote my own self "Overstuffs his statements with ideas that lead nowhere" We can all breathe and move on now. That's it
They put white male baby fetus in the vaccine.  So winning a championship is more important than his concern of what goes in his body?.. Man these people say anything on TV for the 💰..  Kyrie stand your ground bro...💯💯💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
3:39 though lol what happened?
Grown men whining saying he has to “do the right thing”, you should be supportive! He deeply believes he’s doing the right thing.
2:52 I can't put all my eggs in Kyrie's basket and have him trip on the way to the market and there goes everything 🙃😆 that was funny and classic however I seriously do not agree with Skip and Shannon and all the rest of the talking heads for the corporation/plantation called the NBA. Kyrie has been betrayed by the NBA and all of these talking heads have betrayed him as well.
Amazing.  Its like the NBA puts out the word and then all analyst trash him until he is gone. Everyone saying he is crazy,  etc for taking a stance on something he believes in. In the words of Dave Chapelle.  "Some times you have to leave that 50 mil on the table".
Send him to Minnesota
With the utmost respect, Kyrie Irving have to make the Brooklyn Net's Organization trust him again, and Kyrie Irving is ONLY getting one shot!!!!!!!!
Money cannot go with you when your number is called
Why is this guy not playing with king and company this guy is a bum done
There are so many counters to everything they're screaming about, its frustrating.
I f*** with you Shannon shark but Kyrie is right about the vaccinations
Shut up. Game down. He is concerned about saving his life and his family. U both are  sleep on the real issue here  for  the money bag.  Shameful
He's not going alone you guys are for a rude awakening you'll see
Isn't Julius an uncle. I'm sure unc don't want to waste his fortune on you when you were more than capable of having your own. The thing I wouldve done after making this decision is cancel all more overhead. Move to a normal place. Start living a normal person's life. And though I've done no research. I feel like I don't have to, to make the claim, none of that has happened. And won't until your accountant is scheduling emergency appointments. The kind that made kanye a republican.
Because. You ain't George Bush Jr, kyrie. You can't afford to make this many spoiled rich kid choices. And this is a choice someone who is unfamiliar with the lifestyle of 98 percent of America makes.
Maybe he should spend a day talking to broke former celebs and see which phase of life was waaaaaaaaaaaay easier.
Kyrie seems like the type of kid who never missed a meal or had to deal with an f^#% up situation. Which is highly unusual for his ethnicity. I hope he knows that money isn't everything. But it can sure keep life a lot more comfortable.
Poor kry-rie always something 😢 never his fault either, even getting hurt and literally missing half a season every year still not his fault poor guy
Shannon hates mentioning Jordan when it comes to championships. I wonder where his aminos towards Jordan stems from? 🤔
They're all compromised. They can't understand a man standing on his principles.
Why is no one talking about weekly tests or other alternatives? Why does he have to put something in his body that has not been proven to do anything?
Freedom and opposing tyranny is way more important than a ball game.
So Shannon's criticism of Kyrie is basically the SAME as Stephen A Smith . Him and Shannon are both black but yet I never hear any black people criticizing Shannon for going at Kyrie but yet Stephen A is a sellout!??. Can someone please explain!????
Kick rocks kyrie
Show proof where Kyrie is looked up as a hero to those against being vaccinated. Typical of media putting out false narratives.
Kyrie is the Kanye West of the NBA....smh
The testy goal conservatively wreck because antelope intrahepatically replace beside a mighty gold. exotic, second moat
Yeah Shannon super predictable he has no opinion just an actor. Can't wait for the final act.
Kyrie is not alone you guys are wake up we hate you now.
America has bred nothing but sheep so when someone steps outside the boundaries that are set now everyone becomes unglued! C'mon were better than that
Shannon  A Smith smh
People going talk about you no matter what.
Message to KD; a bird in the  hand is worth two in the bush.   GS was the place.
Kyrie is a hypocrite. If was truly about the "people", he would have retired, gave his money away or made use of it for the cause, and become a revolutionist or something. But he hasn't and he won't. It wouldn't be about money or whatever, it would be about what he feels was right and what he was passionate about. In simple terms, he is an uneducated attention seeker.
When Kyrie was playing with Lebron this wasn't happening; g.o.a.t. Just a g.o.a.t. doing g.o.a.t. things.
He would not look foolish with whatever decision he makes by the way.  Nobody should be here to judge a persons personal decisions and the time frame it takes to make them.   I think y'all are all trying to destroy Kyrie character as a whole, and its disgusting.   You all don't know this mans life and struggle yet you tear him down. smh.
Trade him to the Bucks 🦌 Back 2 Back baby
Kyrie picked up dennis's bag and then some lmaoooo
I dont care how much talent he has. I personally want him to go away. He's living proof that money doesn't equate to happiness. The man has money, fame, a championship and yet he creates reasons to complain. Just get out of the NBA so I can enjoy basketball!
2:13 NIIiIiiIiCCCEE!!!!!
There's one person that can get through to KYRIE IRVING but thing is that person is no longer with us. The only guy that could have gotten through to KYRIE would have been KOBE "BEAN" BRYANT bc KOBE is the only person the KYRIE IRVING looked up to and fully respected and KOBE is the only guy that would put nothing before basketball, KOBE BRYANT is MR. BASKETBALL literally and i believe he would have been the only person in this world besides himself that KYRIE would sincerely listen to.
How do u trade a scoring machine - and a defender. They role w him through this year his contract is up after this year.  So they will let him go at the end of the season if he does not co-operate thn
When you give brats hundreds of millions $$$ they find other things to entertain themselves. Kyrie will find out that he’s no one cares about him anymore
Its almost like he was born as a rich entitled spoiled kid in one of the wealthiest areas in new jersey....
Men sitting around gossiping about another man in 2021  smh lots of beta guys out here . Sports tv 📺  😑
coercion and fear has won this take...welcome to tyranny
Classic losers 🤷🏾‍♂️
I don’t understand why the state has the power to tell someone that they have to get the vaccine to attend public events, if you aren’t vaccinated then wear masks at games. Kyrie shouldn’t have to take the vaccine to play…  they can test kyrie daily for covid if need be, makes no sense to me
2pac was a VOICE for the voiceless.  Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, MLK, all voice for the voiceless....but YOU @KyrieIrving AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA u are no voice for the voiceless my friend.   @RealSkipBayless @undisputed @JennyTaft @FOXSports @FS1
I actually think they have a better chance of winning without Irving thin with him because him being in and out will destroy chemistry and chemistry is huge in wining a championship and KD Harden is more thin enough to win if there healthy and the role players stay healthy and does what they need 2
Kyrie has done this so he wouldn't be traded because no team will wan't him that's his plan
Lebron would be a hero of the people if he took the same stance. The nba would have a completely different face on and these guys would be talking about how he transcends the game and is the greatest human on earth. But kyrie get treated like his breath stink.
Kyrie isn’t the best teammate apparently but what he does in life is his choice. If you have someone you work with and they don’t ever show up and do their job you fire them and that’s fine but you can’t hate them for what they do in their own life.
He got a ring! With a winning shot!!!?
If a team wants unwanted distraction, trade for Kyrie Irving! Hahahahahahahaha
Kyrie with the cavs: I want you to trade me because i cant stand playing with lebron. Kyrie with the celtics: I'm outta here, its very hard to lead this team. Kyrie with the nets: Hey i dont want to get vaccinated so you guys have to deal with it. Whats the common denominator in all this?  Its all about kyrie, all about me me me me. Kyrie is just unpredictable.
Kyrie is the Ali of Basketball, he's the People's Champ who gives a voice to the voiceless.. They told him they have excemptions, then they pulled the rug out underneath him.
Kyrie smoked his brain away, however funny too watch… come on tell us more about the earth is flat, while talking all around the globe references 🤣🤣🤣
His body his choice... If he was playing for the nets we wouldn't be having this conversation 🤬🤬🤬
Bottom Line, Sounds Like Bi-Polar Mania Behavior to me!  IJS it is what it is...
When you talk to someone who is anti-vaccine just ask them one thing to see if they are reasonable or not. 'What would it take for you to be wrong?' Someone with genuine reasons for not being vaccinated can answer that question. Everyone else is just dug in and will move goal posts in any direction to appear right. If you can't be wrong about something you really aren't right, you're just stubborn
HE DOESNT WANNA BE FORCED TO VACCINE SIMPLE
It I was Philly I'd see if I could swap Ben Simmons and some picks to the Nets for Kyrie
Kyrie = AB/AB=KYRIE 💍🤯🤪💍
Too much spotlight on Kyrie.... Anybody know latest on the Klaw ?
At the end of the day, Kyrie is just taking off time from work whenever he wants. At a certain point the company/organization just has to let him go. They can’t be accommodating forever. That’s just irresponsible on their part.
Nets got a sour lemon.
Kyrie Irving is a joke. Any team who signs or trades for him are crazier than he is. Let him go so he can become irrelevant and we won’t have to hear anymore of his B.S.
I'm gonna say it coz no one can.  The reason: Flat Earth and Conspiracies
he sounds like scatman crouthers in the begininng
What about your life?
Let that man be a man an own his own choice!  Support his decision and stop punching this man down.  He has enough money and a Championship ring!
Mr. Drama!!!!
these are the people God says choose the world over anything. They love the world. Championship over morals. Yall have to see these conversations are meant to make you agree. Lets not forget the vax doesnt do anything for anyone or protect them. They can simply give him a covid test b4 each game. This is satanic energy and it's taken over the minds of the whole world.
Man, skip and shannon vibe together so well. Unlike the other show in ESPN
I probably have not heard everything that Kyrie has said about this but these talking heads are useless. They pretend to know what he thinks, what his options are. -smh
Sixers will take him
I have an anti-vax uncle who quit his job and is now home schooling his kid because of vaccine requirements. I have been close with him for many years, always laughing off his tendancy to believe in wacky conspiracies...but this is just sad. I tried many times to reason with him, but he replies with the same old debunked drivel I'm sure he read on facebook. These people have made up their minds, and no one can convince them otherwise
These aren’t military guys, they aren’t obligated to take an injection that they don’t want, especially with the side effects and mortality risk that these vaccines carry, waning efficacy, relative risks for his age and leave of health, there is no reason for the Nets to play brinkmanship besides politics.
Get out that mans pocket!!!
Kyrie’s unpredictable… and I Predict, Team’s ain’t getting Him no more after this Drama.. always been and always will be. What a waste of his talent..😢
A Black Man has the right to say no, or did we forget that part?  Everything else is irrelevant,
Come on Unc you starting to sound like Stephen A now.
They are better of letting Irving go for free than to take simmons
Shannon has proven to me that he is a sellout!!! He do something he would not want to do dor money!!!! No one should be made to take something they do not to take regardless of money!!! Stand tall with your decision Kyrie!!! 👊🏾💪🏾
Why would any team want Kyrie Irvin on their roster. Yes he is a very talented player but othe NBA teams know he is baggage and garbage. He finds excuses to not play and is injury prone and does not want to play and destroys your team
Real talk. I hope he retires.
I stand with Kyrie, Skip and Shannon mentioned things of the past and i get it but you cant force someone to get vaccinated
Its ironic that Kyrie said Lebron was full of drama! And look at him! Every single week theres drama with Kyrie
The vaccine mandate is stupid. Only weak people support it
Much respect to Kyrie for standing his ground. F the NBA.
If I'm a Gm I'm not taking the risk for kyrie.
I respect that Kyrie is really about what he talks about and is willing to but he’s money where his mouth is
The whole vaccination debate is one sided in the media. The fact is the vaccine doesn't work. So why the push to actually take it? Why no discussion on natural immunity? Which is far more effective than any vaccine. The truth is the governments of the world have been planning this nonsense for some time. Going back to Gerald Ford. You can look it up. Happened in 1974-76.   Kyrie will be vindicated in the end for his stance.
Unk is one step from Stephen A. He is on the road to sellout status!!!
Kyrie is the biggest NBA drama Queen. It's always something with him. On an every other year basis. First in Cleveland. Then Boston. Now in Brooklyn. Lmao. One of the greatest talents in nba history gonna be left out of the hall of fame due to these transgressions
Kyrie sabotages himself. He had it made with LeBron. He had a great situation in Boston. He’s prime to win a title run Brooklyn. It’s just always something with Kyrie
kd a co start to tf😂
This is the one time I'm afraid I have to disagree with my man Shannon. I am a man who trusts in taking control of myself and not letting others dictate my well-being. Ali was the most hated at one time for taking control of himself against the “MAN” and the system, and now he is seen as the biggest ICON throughout the world.  These mainstream puppets are paid to go with a specific narrative, and I don't expect anything more or less.
I usually don't, but I support Kyrie on this matter.  I'd ask to get traded.
It’s just foolish all around. He’s gonna have to get vaccinated to play in the nba. He doesn’t want to retire. So why not just go ahead and bite the bullet get vaccinated now and play for a championship caliber team? Common sense ain’t common tho.
Money aside, all things being equal, in the end professional ball players are employees getting paid to work just like anyone else on this planet. You can't just come and go as you please to your place of employment unless you're like the owner.
Respect Kyrie for this!
Kyrie is a diva no matter where he plays it's clear he went downhill every since he left Cleveland should have swallowed his pride and worked out whatever issue he had with Lebron they could have won more titles
KD & Hardin is NOT pressing Kyrie to play! Don't forget they all said they're standing with Kyrie on camera! Don't start being like those other shows! Ratings will start to look like Steven's!
He's already retracted the statement about Flat-earth. He admitted he was wrong about that. I'll stand by his decision. Remember, Dave Chappelle walked away from 50 million and people thought he was crazy. People made up a bunch of stuff, too.
So make this about Kyrie and not about forcing him to in Inject something In this body he doesn't want to. 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Freedom is more important than a championship.
I like Kyrie but dude just pay a doctor to say you took the vaccine lol durrr. With documents to prove as such.
As great as Kyrie is, he is paid to do a job. He may not play anymore because of his reluctance to taking the vaccine.
SO WHAT. HIS HEALTH AND BELIEFS ARE MORE IMPORTANT YOU BUNCHA COMMIES
I didn’t realize it was this many sheep here in America; the land of the free and the home of the brave. When Ky was screaming BLM everyone loved him now that he isn’t going along with “the narrative” he’s the bad guy. Ask Brandon Goodwin how he feels doing what was best for the team. Y’all better start looking at what’s going on in Australia.
Ftrecord,  shannon in particular sounds moist about this subject.
Shannon, what's up big dawg? You're starting to sound like black Hating A Smith.
These guys are puppets shaming a man that’s standing up for hisself and what he believes in everything ain’t always about basketball or sports
Yall start to get too personal into Kyrie life let that Man have his right and move on! Why is media making such a big deal with this Man  having the right to do what he wants with his body! He is not stopping the NBA from playing any games! Damn does everything have a agenda now....SMH I use to like this show.
This whole conversation is disgusting. People are judging someone’s character because they’re saying playing a leisure sport aka being an entertainer isn’t so important that they’ll blindly put a foreign substance into their body. How much is a dollar and glory really worth? I guess to some people it’s everything
Tyrese not a leader ain't nobody following him
These guys are weirdos he doesn’t want to get vaccinated and they’re talking about him being selfish to me it looks like it’s the other way around if he doesn’t want to get vaccinated make them do a rapid test every day before he steps there
No matter how talented and good Kyrie is  he’ll never get to the next level because of his ego.
Terminate or strike...just like the nurses, the cops, the soldiers, and the teachers.
Incentivize his contract.
As a nurse I respect Kyries decision.. As a man I respect it even more.. I’ve seen first hand the cons of the vaccine that gets less press than a basketball player not taking the vaccine.. In my city alone they’re distributing different vaccines based on what side of town you live on.. So you can’t get mad at a man for protecting his peace of mind & his body
Hes literally trolling everyone. The man clearly hates the media and the fact that people can't keep his name out there mouth. He'll pull this along for as much as possible and then get vaccination like nothing happened
Kyrie sit home and be paid, It's business. INVEST YOUR MONEY...
Chris Paul should have been considered for an award during his time in OKC.
Why are they even discussing this guy? Oh my.. its tiring.. im outa here
You guys get tooooo personal at certain guys. Why do you guys think you know what another man thinks, using your personal mindset?! Y'all trip'in as usual when it comes to a certain hue type. EZ 2 C.
Look at all these dems. If u disagree with them they attack u and discredit u.
Shannon  reminds me of sam jacks character in django
He didn't "choose to just take an absence". The NBA is trying to force medical procedures on him.  It's the NBA that's being irresponsible, not Kyrie.
These two are pathetic!
I wonder what the story would be if it was Luka doncic........
Uncle Drew is Uncle Doomed.
Smh  he shouldn’t have to take the vaccine that’s his choice Shannon I’m suprised 🥴
Kyrie to DC
Kyrie to lakers
Honestly nets may be better and more balanced without kyrie playing. I mean of ourselves they're unstoppable woth him, but I think they would be more balanced without em.
Now, this is undisputed!
These young players bring a lot of drama to the game. That's what's turning people against the league...
Kyrie reminds me of Terrell Owens , all the talent in the world but no team wants him
From Unknown Sources: Kyrie Irving signed a 3 month contract with ESPN entertainment to not take any vaccine. ESPN was struggling with NBA news and reached out to Kyrie to help them and one thing we know about Kyrie he never refuses for help.
Kyrie Irving is the black version of Donald J. Trump, self-loving, arrogant, and argues against science with repeated talking points only a 4th grader can agree with.
“I can’t put all my eggs in kyries basket then have him trip on the way to the market and there goes everything”  I love it
I Stand with Kyrie ✊🏾
NBA players are not making any sacrifice getting vaccinated. They should be grateful to those scientists for creating such vaccine in such short time. Otherwise they all would be in another bubble crying about their mental health. If Kyrie got a problem talk to some scientists and get it solved. Man what's the problem.
Crazy how you two don’t agree on anything besides that vaccine.
6:50 Who told Skip that taking an untested, rushed vaccine is for the betterment of the whole? Whole as in NBA I hope.... That thing in that needle is mutating inside those vaxx takers. Deadly viruses that require vaccinations don't have 90+ percent survival and recovery rates.  Respectfully
It’s kind of weird that because he doesn’t want that shot , America’s tv personalities are literally tearing his image apart 🤦🏾‍♂️ it’s so evident too
I'll take skip all day over them ESPN dudes..no comparison.skip da 🐐
It’s always something with Kyrie on every team he goes to.
Y’all … they arguing with a grown man to do something to his body he doesn’t want to do for a vaccine for a virus that he can still catch after he gets the vaccine
Shannon "what up bruh" Sharpe
Can't get Right
He's making a stand against the Vaccine props to him! They over looking the fact that he's making a point you can't force people to take a medicine it's against all rights!
So the money is more important then freedom of choice?
Hahaha...these CLOWNS!! They try to picture Kyrie unprofessional when he was ready to wreck everyone, basketball wise! That's his JOB Shannon, BASKETBALL 🏀! Do you get it?!? The Nets , you and everyone on the sports news right now act unprofessionally. He has EVERY right to choose anything regarding his body. DEAL WITH IT!!
Money is the ruler of all evil
All things in " the Real World " according to Shannon Sharpe....it never gets old......
A voice for the voiceless? Anti vaccers go loud af. Dude immature and selfish... selfish toward his team and humanity. He is an incredible baller but he has issues with his thought process...
Talent only matters if you show up
I love Kai but if the Nets want to be successful you have to get rid of him his talent is great but he’s not utilizing it and is letting down his team send him to philly get Ben a great defender and give Embid another scorer
So Players Getting Vaccinations For Championships ? 😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️ YALL See How Stupid This Is Getting . (7:00)
The irony of making ppl get vaccinated to "protect" others , without a choice, is that 2nd hand smoke has been takin mfz out, by way of cancer, for centuries. But yet cigarettes and cigars are permitted for purchase all over the U.S. I wonder why?💰💰💰💰Hypocritical mfz. Smh
so Kyrie is trapped in the corner.! why are we still talking about him...? let's move on, he just wants attention...that dude is just a problem about to happen.!
I don’t want anyone talking about that first chip in Cleveland anymore when skip says they could’ve won u know they could’ve won
I couldn't disagree with Shannon more on this topic.
Kyrie is a white guy in a black man's body. He's a wierd nerd dude. Black ppl don't claim Kyrie we don't know if he's a astronaut or a alien. We are just confused as y'all are on this dude lol
I would hate to go to sleep at night and be thinking about Kyrie. Or sports at all.
Thank u skip for the pre lebron to cleveland take
Kyrie is a drama queen. Always has been and always will be. Kyrie hasn’t figured out that he isn’t an alpha for lack of a better word. He wants to be but isn’t. Trade Kyrie for Russ. Straight up.
Damn all this because he won’t take a vaccine? Johnson and Johnson paying them advertising bills.
i'm very happy to see both skip and shannon agree on something
They want this man traded for what reason???......IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT TEAM HE GOES TO, HE WON'T PLAY UNVACCINATED!!!!!! Yall just dont want him playing for the Nets anymore. Hatred is real!
Kyrie just make you guys so tiny to the point you coudn't utter a word about the humain getting together message part of his talk, i guess it was RED LINE hein i mean neither of you makes the fifth of the amount of money he was black on white promised to make and look at yourselves, no matter how good you are at whatever you do according to René Descart what really defines you is how much human you are and on this playing field KAI just made me see how small you guys are, i use to love the show i watche it every day and when i can't i youtube it but that's it you ain't worth another more minute
I dont understand why you guys just can't support him. You guys never supported him . And what he's doing has to deal with his health.  Why should he take something that he don't want to put into his body.
Remember they hated Ali for taking his stance and sacrifices. Kyrie is jeopardizing 200 mill for his stance. I'm glad he realizes its bigger then him. If they buck break Kyrie on this, a man due over 200 mill, then the regular blue collar employee doesn't stand a chance. Shame on you Shannon for not realizing this. No1 should be forced to put something in their body they feel comfortable with. I feel like ppl who are pro vaccine mandate will be on the wrong side of history...
I’m still taking trae over Kyrie
“Flat earth, Illuminati, he’s brave.” Lol, nah. Kyrie’s an idiot with $$ and a brand behind him that no one wants to bad mouth. Imagine just taking time off from work with no exploration and STILL getting paid. Sport starts deserve the accolades and leeway because they took a chance on themselves, but you HAVE to play. Thank GOD the Knicks didn’t sign him.
Teach him a real lesson and send him to the Hawks.
I have a right not to get a passport or a driver's license too. What are the consequences?
Just retire. He tries to hard to be smart.. it’s annoying
I stand with Kyrie and his convictions and stuff. I'm definitely Not with ANYONE forcing Anyone to do and what to put in their bodies. FR. IJS
I know that it very likely won't happen, but the trade that could make sense for both sides is Kyrie Irving for Damian Lillard. Why? 1. Brooklyn would get that third superstar that everyone thinks they need... A reliable superstar. Plus, Portland shows love to Dame, and puts him on a direct trajectory towards a title. 2. Portland, who is clearly trying to find its identity, will get someone who'll keep them competitive (when he plays), and if all else fails, plenty of cap space to go after another superstar or other pieces to rebuild with.
I’m so tired of this subject. Just move on please. Damn!
Shannon barber pushed his line up back to far this week 😓😂😂
Shannon worry about them bum Lakers. Cause they not perfect
Skip & Shannon live in a fantasy world where sports gods are worshipped.  They don't understand men of faith & principle.
Man y'all keep regurgitating the same thing. Have y'all interviewed him?? Nope.But you seem to have all the answers. You both keep pressing the issue that he should take the vaccine, Brandon Goodwin took it, lets talk about him and his blood clots... In time, i look forward to see yall back pedal out of your statements.
Woman: Kyrie question!  Shannon: Skip idk what to believe!  Lavar Ball: That's right!!!!!
SMH it’s choice!
Many families and friends have died from COVID. Get the damn vaccine. If you don’t want to, fine but you’re not helping in any way
Kyrie is always the problem wherever he goes. Even when he didn’t show up, it’s like skip not showing up to his job for personal reasons without telling anyone. It just doesn’t work that way. Kyrie is being very selfish right now, i dont even know what he’s standing for exactly anymore
GRAPHENE OXIDE IN THE SHOT. HE KNOWS WHATS UP
Do we ever ask about the mental health of these athletes?
All you people acting like kyrie is doing this for the people are foolish. He's a stubborn, selfish head case and always has been. He don't give a damn about anybody unless their opinion goes along with what he wants
None of y’all supported Kapernick! And would have the dignity to make the decisions these two men have!
None of you media or athletes would ever stand for something. It’s not always about the team and playing , it’s about real life
The deranged event summatively subtract because george connolly pick of a picayune theater. classy, versed creek
I'm not taking that gene therapy shot
Kyrie goes to the wizards they going 4-5th in the conference
Wish they’d show Jenny more
Kyrie is definitely one of the best who has done it. However, always in the back of your mind is will he be there for the next game.
EVERY YEAR it’s something new with Kyrie SMH he’s TRASH
Unvaccinated= spiritual, intelligent, brave, introspective, leadership ect... Vacinated = im smart cuz i watch 📺, CNN, and Dr Fauci
Teams owner just need Tylenol so they can work with kyrie
WASHINGTON
Shannon is on the wrong side. Time tells everything. Why you mad for what another man decide for his family? Why?
Shannon wanted to curse but covered up those S and F bombs real smooth. Mad props.
Vinny curry got the vax aug 3rd got blood clots aug 23rd. This is pharma pushing fox to push an agenda
This segment was trash, they couldn’t talk down on his ball game so they attacked everything else about him. I know the call has been made to kaepernick him cause they couldn’t  deshaun Watson him but damn. Most of y’all are the same ones who acted like y’all were so offended when that lady told lebron to shut up and dribble. Well isn’t that what y’all are telling kyrie to do.
Still tryn 2 figure out why vax'd mfs pressed about un vax'd mfs??? Y'all took the vax so y'all good right? Then wtf's the problem???
This guys have nothing to talk about that's sickening
The guy hasn't done anything wrong.why should the guy be demonized for the truth. This world is so evil.
kyrie to clippers for batum morris and reggie
Why so many likes?
We need to keep this in perspective. Kyrie is not using his so-called voice to question and raise awareness about the wasteful use of private jets, Webull's - the Nets' major sponsor - ownership and the ethical implications, Corporate America's pillaging of the planet or the very real and scientifically established threats of climate change and biodiversity loss. He's using it to confuse people about whether or not to receive a safe vaccine to protect his team mates, himself, his family and the public at large. Let's get a grip here. He's not some sort of intellectual, deep-thinking giant. His thinking is obviously muddled. He's a public figure and while we respect his choice as everyone keeps repeating, we have an obligation to critique it.
At this point, I’m just waiting for Kyrie to announce what gender he’s truly been all this time. But he better not use 5G to announce it.
He got injured and left LeBron when he needed him and he gave LeBron that 2016 title also
I agree wit Shannon comments. Kyrie is thinking about "I" vs Team. Being a leader is making sacrifices for the betterment of the team. Kyrie is considered a leader on this team therefore his actions should show that.
Lol Kyrie be thinkin' he CM Punk or something.
I mean, he believes the Earth is flat. What do we expect?
Trade him why because he won't take the white man's lethal injection
Skip and Shannon are so stupid when it comes to this issue.
Nobody said this about them not playing games for BLM
There is literally zero chance anyone would want to trade for Kyrie Irving. After all that he has done in the last few years, nobody wants that problem. The Nets wouldn't sign him also if him coming didn't bring in Durant as well. Irving wants to be Che Guevarra type of personality, his mind is nowhere near focused on basketball.
Nike should drop Kyrie's endorsements. Its hurting their brand.
haha  remember what these dudes said in just a weeks time they'll be singing  a different tune... should've just changed the topic big boys.
I don't care what any of these fakes have to say about Kyrie Irving. I'm not listening to the segment and I am unsubscribing from undisputed as of today. I already know that Shannon is going to be blasting about the vaccine agenda more than anybody else because he only cares about company policy he doesn't care about moral rights or Godly rights period! And I hope he sees these real statements. Kyrie is a strong intelligent individual and he is built for this! He doesn't care about using his platform to keep his security and status, he cares about standing up for what is right because if you don't stand up for something you'll fall for anything!!! ✌🏽 Out undisputed for good!!!!!!
I don't think he's ever playing for the Nets ... the owner of the team has probably soured on Kyrie... I would have... if im the team owner I'd talk to Silver and see if I could just pay him to stay home like a settlement in exchange that Silver pulls a David Stern and makes Irving persona non grada.  KYRIE is about to get the Gilbert Arenas treatment.
If Kyrie continues in this stubborn way, no nba team will hire him. He has done this to himself & is perceived as unpredictable, and definitely not a team player. He may or may not show up for work, depending on how he feels.
Hate to say this but the nba got a agenda. No ones gone trade for him. The world would have a fit, If a team traded for a unvaccinated player. That would change everything the gov preach about. It’ll b nba players can go city to city without the shot. Why should I get the shot.
Trade him to okc for gilgeous-Alexander
Tuskegee experiment…..
Talk about the reason why he doesn’t want the shot.  This is the same thing they did with Kaepernick.  Talk about why he’s kneeling not just the fact he’s kneeling…..  Just because they tricked you into getting it doesn’t mean he wants it.
Collin kaprinick didn't give up the money the same way you avocative for Collin kappernick to be in the  NFL You should be advocating for Kyrie irving to stay in the NBA This is the worst segment I've ever seen You either stand with freedom or you don't it's simple Kyrie made the easy choice
Wish the Inside the NBA crew was covering this
No matter your race , religion  etc. The government enforcing vaccines is a dangers game. The government doesn't give out chemo, inhalers etc.. ask yourself why not what he is doing. Respectfully
Kyrie making 18 mil this year without stepping on the court. Huuuuuge Win !!!
Kyrie can’t do what CP3 did for #1 he isn’t the leader CP is #2 the talent.
U don’t tell kno one what to do with their body
So the police can got to games without vaccination 🤔
Kyrie is just an actual man and sadly too many aren’t used to seeing that anymore
Ahh i think ive seen this story before But to be honest i think this vaccine thing is more of a distrust of the government and how they went about it all only fuels their fire.
Not caring about the money more than other things isn’t confusing… does he care about the money? Duh. He just doesn’t care about it more than whatever it is he’s fighting for. 😂 I would like to see him get the vaccine and play, but to each their own. 🤷‍♂️
every team needs Kyrie when the Season starts, Kyrie, Miami has great weather:)
Lamar Jackson took his and still living ,kyrie grow up ,don't take it ,Retire and be you , this is still a white world ,kyrie watch up you don't have enough money for you and kid life time ,5 to 9 ..pride is ugly.
Kyrie think he'll be nominated for PM
I support Kyrie 💪🏾
It’s do or dye for a big three like them this season
Ali fought for the rights of black people while Kyrie is fighting for all people's right to not get vaccinated regardless of color. That's more tuff. We need to have Kyrie Irving Day just like MLK day.
Kyrie escaped the matrix
Oh well....bye bye Kyrie!!!!
Boooooooo LET'S GO BRANDON AND THE NBA..
If people stand up and “FREELY CHOOSE” not to vaccinate- ITS A PROBLEM!    They are showing us that.    The masses are sleep 😴 and the New Order is coming soon 🔜
Kyrie's attempts for power play never worked for him. He tried it with a few teams now thinking his the man but failed. This guy need to learn from his mistakes and just stick to what his good at and influence the younger audience through playing honest basketball.
By ignorance or instructions from above, these 2 puppets are muddying up the waters, attempting very desperately through the constant stupidification of the masses, to make it appear as if friendship / loyalty / team spirit / championship are in front of being alive. If the entire proposition of being injected with this concoction is putting at risk the entire viability of being alive - with no lack of examples and instances all over the planet - I find it mildly entertaining and highly partial, that this channel is devoting so much time into cajoling an athlete who has the spine to stand vertically and not put "the good of others"  ahead of his own existence.  Don't get it twisted, boys. You are being bluntly obtuse - again, not sure if by personal belief or by mandates of your own station's powers that be - and democratizing being a pawn in a game you all refuse to look at.  I'm not a fan of Kyrie's antics by any stretch of the imagination. But on this particular topic, it's a freakin' life altering decision! This whole talk about bros and pros becomes utterly nonsensical IF THE MAN IS NOT ALIVE or suffers from potential side effects! The mere fact you are attempting to shame him globally on your platform, speaks volumes about your own masters, who you are as professionals, your level of consciousness (more lack thereof), not his integrity!  You don't agree with the man, don't! He will likely be sanctioned. He will likely hurt himself. Or he may lead a movement of players who believe their Life shouldn't be put at risk over a dodgy medical inefficient solution! The entire operation you are mounting is disgusting to say the least. Kyrie may be loose goose, but that's his right. You should move on and create content that doesn't hinge on entertaining forms of coercion!
Y’all sound as bad as SAS. THATS HIS BODY PERIOD
Kyrie is entitled to not take the vaccine if he doesn't want to. But at the same time, Nets have to do right by them. I respect Brooklyn for their stance especially considering how talented Kyrie is.
Kyrie getting all these MVP calibers players around him and yet he ain’t grateful enough to get his sht straignt and fcking play to get a dam ring
Conspiracy theories lol FACTS Skip! As your boss 😂. But y'all on t.v I get it. This is entertaining when you are awake. The  😈 is a funny guy for this fiat. Skip and Shannon do a show on Tuskegee experiment. Then ask Kyre to get the shot.
He’s such a toxic person … I can’t even watching the great movie 🎥 he’s in …
Biggest loser in the NBA this year.   If he don't vaccinate, he is probably done with the league sooner or later.  If he does vaccine, all his social stance and commitments would forever be discredited by him choosing money over his stance.  GG Boys.
Kyrie to sixers
Let him play without killing himself ShayShay them he would respect his job. Kyre was the reason Cleveland won so let's me real about that. Nets ain't letting him go anywhere.
Kyrie will be nothing but a meme  by 2025 … 😭
Why exactly would Kyrie not get the vaccine? What does he lose if he gets the vaccine? Or is this one of those flat earth kinda stuff from Kyrie?
When interviewed he did not want to say anything a week later I want to be a voice for the voiceless  your a joke Kyrie 😅🤣🤣
Stand strong kyrie
Lakers are rubbing thier hands laughing
When you uncritically believe in every conspiracy theory how can you claim to be a free thinker?
Been saying this about dude from day one . Most over rated player in the nba
This is a rare moment 1:48 I can't believe skip said something like this it's beautiful 🥲
It’s crazy because I think this is how uncle drew is made 🤭
Funny thing is I know for 100% fact Shannon would take Kyrie on the lakers right now without hesitation
We welcome Kyrie to the Big 3, we need here bro
First times I seen them agree on something
Trade Kyrie to the CBA Bayi Rockets
I have not agreed with how Kyrie has conducted himself previously within a team dynamic, but this is different.   Kyrie is exercising his right to choose as a U.S. citizen.  This situation is like all of the health care workers who are being let go across the nation for not taking the vaccine.  It's the, " You don't have to take the vaccine, but if you don't you can't work here" agenda.    Absolutely ridiculous!
I think the suns 🌞 might take him 🤔
The NFL is getting great again, Boxing is getting great again with Fury etc..., MLB definitely is on track to the best Post Season ever, Hockey always gives you their best, and here we are spending hours on someone who doesn't want to get vaccinated. After so many lost their lives and loved ones. These are the times we're living in folks. Unbelievable!
Dear Steph,  Words cant explain how much I miss you.    Love Always KD 🐍
Honestly don't blame Kyrie, blame the NBA and stupid mandates on experimental medicine
I can’t wait for Shannon to use this Kyrie saga to push Bron’s agenda
Y’all go watch Andy Hoops’ video on Kyrie after this. Really good video.
A championship is worth altering your DNA?
Shannon sharpe you don’t even know @kyrie
@shannonsharpe u talking about Boston like brad stevens ain’t get fired! His college coaching was trash
Tell me why 500 medical work quit? They work in the hospital and they seen first hands ... Explain that
Trade him to the rockets
He believes what he believes and everybody's against him...let him live, he's a basketball player with a conscious, he's a thinking man and a man who will stand on there own morals and standards....Why put him down!!!!
Who wants to bet me the nets are going to play a lot of games in the meadowlands this season? New York is overrated.
He might be dealing with some issues that is bigger that basketball
Kyrie wouldn't even be relevant like he is now without Lebron
Shannon is the definition of a sellout. I used to respect him but he's slowly and surely showing his true self. How can Shannon be so smart yet pretend to be so confused by a guy, who spoke carefully, about how he feels. Going from Uncle Shay to Uncle Rukus right before my eyes. Smh
Irving thinks he is some philosopher. Dude is just big headed…
Puppet, Puppet. PUPPET.!!!!!!
# SHOE DROP  shoe drop 1 - cities pass covid mandate/ shoe drop 2 - salary drops 50% / shoe drop 3 - the nets decide to move on / shoe drop 4 - nets cancel $186 million extension NEXT CHAPTER - gets traded to a bad team / Nike cancels contract / injuries, flake outs / retirement / no idiot is bigger than the game / only fools poop where they eat NBA MOVES ON
Realize that he's not even the people's champ
Trade Kyrie for Trae young... let Irving believe in his beliefs in Atlanta
Kyrie's job is not the only one threatened if not vaccinated to work. Welcome to real life bro
After digging his back out you wish him the best really? It’s so sad it’s always your own people!🖕🏾
Any body that take that much time talking about anybody else really wishes they where that person
Its crazy how we all became sheep. The propaganda is real.  There's more to life than just basketball. If he has an adverse reaction to it,  dies or becomes deathly ill none of you will be there. Tyranny at its finest. This have nothing to do with basketball.
Narc games. Smh...
Skip why would you "support" someone who thinks the earth is flat? That's just ignorance
Kyrie too cocky, he needs to go from the Nets, I would not want him on my team.
By the way. I don’t think Kyrie cares about anyone’s opinion. He’s in tune with his higher self.
Trade the bum
Ben Simmons is worth way more than Kyrie at this point
This is a collective effort of character assassination by Shannon, Stephen, the dumb one Perkins and now even Skip is doing it. Skip was waxing lyrical about Kyrie last season, now he's not all that. This is laughable
My little brother ky is not a puppet like some of them dudes on TV but KD is a snake so a snake will bite you at any moment I bet a mil if that was lebron james bron would say we need ky to win a championship but KD flip that script by saying if he don't want to with us he ain't us.
"Foolish pride"       ~Prince Vegeta
Kyrie to either Miami, Dallas or Memphis, no Mandates in FLA, TX or TN
he should get vaccinated and donate his whole salary to anti mandate awareness
Kyrie needs to request a trade to a state that doesn't have mandates. so he can play and make that good money...
Y’all pretending there isn’t more NBA players against Vaccine
Kyrie's absurdity cuts his trade value in half.  It's still better than paying him to not play and lose the cap space.
when these two are on the same page about any topic, it takes this show to a different level, nothing better on tv
Y’all comments killing me:  The choice is simple: get vaccinated or you can’t play.  Kyrie made his choice.   Everyone can say whatever they want in response. If “you lose respect for Shannon/skip” over this then you probably never had respect for them so stop the madness.
Simmons would need to be the point if he went to nets but harden is the point how is that a perfect trade
It’s not about doing something special it’s not about the team it’s about not wanting to be told what choices you have to make medically 🤦‍♂️ stay strong kyrie stand up for what you believe is right 💯
2:53   😂😂😂
Kyrie still thinking he is in the level of Lebron, KD, Giannis and Curry. Lol
Did they not see the live 😂, Kyrie coming back
Y'all just want this man to entertain y'all do u kyrie respect
Shannon and Stephen A smh
Imagine an nba team that actually wants Kyrie Irving lol
Kyrie wants to be oppressed so bad 😅😅
I only see two situations happening for Kyrie. 1.  He will be out of a job and loose money. And even though he is saying he doesn’t want that well it’s going to happen the route he’s choosing. And 2. He will comply to the rules of the NBA and get vaccinated which will cause his supporters to not like him because he fought all this time to not get vaccinated and he finally does....Kyrie dug himself a whole he can’t get out from.
And the lie detector determine  that was a lie 🤥🤥🤥😂😂😂😂😂 basketball does not mean anything it's pointless 🧐🧐🧐🧐
I remember in Cleveland,  one game Kyrie scored 40+ with 1 assist. LeBron pulled him aside,  you're the PG we need more assist, ....... he never changed!
Kyrie if you are reading this Please retire!!..The NBA will still be watched by millions while you focus on other important things to do…increase your superior intellect while we dummies stay enjoying the league
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins repent of what the New testament describes as sin believe the gospel get baptized and obey the teachings of Jesus the gospel and the teachings of Jesus are documented in Matthew Mark Luke and John Jesus is the only way to be saved God bless
ky has such a poor track record as a centerpiecee pg it's hard to back him on this issue even though i think he has a great point
Last time i checked, the state of New York changed the rules and not Kyrie.
OK uncle Shannon Sharpe starting to get really annoying now
Go to Dallas
Kyrie is an absolute embarrassment to the entire human race 🚮🚮🚮
KD leaving Steph for Kyrie is the worse decision ever…… He should’ve stayed in GS
Nah trust me the nets will take him back if he wanted to come back.  because he’s a guaranteed Championship. That’s why they allowed him to do what he did last year
The nets should strike with kyrie to ban this ridiculous mandate.
Where are all the player activists defending kyrie? Lmao A bunch of cowards, joe Biden got them like trained seals
Great!! Job Kyrie in standing for what YOU/WE BELIEVES.. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Kyrie doesn't care anybody but himself . He is not a team player . He is not reliable . The Nets can't trust him to be all in . The Nets should trade him.
This is stupid to even consider. Every GM believes Kyrie will retire or be problematic
Y’all mad cuz he don’t wanna get the jab lmao
Shannon is the best in the business.
He should go to Dallas
SHAN-NON!  Skip!  Do anything, but please keep Kyrie away from Los Angeles (meaning The Lakers).  If he wanna go play with Kawhi & Paul (Clippers), then have at it.
Leave the man alone damn it! He will continue to play in the NBA 🥱😴
The same people who support Kyrie are the same people who condemn Kap. You love whoever loves your cause.
I'm proud of kyrie for standing his ground
You wasted 20 minutes watching his live then spend an hour talking about it the next day. Makes sense
I hate how the media is forcing a person into a health choice that doesn't affect them!  Choice only matters when it's the cool thing to do.
It would not shock me if they had covid-19 in the next basketball video game I'm just saying
Yooooo, LMFAO they trash this dude every single day because the will not get the vaccine. Hahaha yooo, every dang day haha
no he isnt going to get traded
i personally think people talking about a trade are missing the mark on this.. i think the organization is backing kyrie and waiting to see if mandates loosen up. they let this man miss games and be spotted on zoom calls and at parties
Shannon sharpe you were my guy. NBA, Stephen A smith, skip, Shay shay, anybody else dragging a man and trying to take his right to earn a living for having an opinion of his own.  This is a witch hunt. I’m shocked. Can’t believe what we’ve come too.
KYRIE FOR JOHN WALL? WELL TAKE HIM 🚀
Kyrie needs someone who has his respect to sit him down, look him in the eye and tell him "Bro, YOU AIN'T KOBE"
Trade him for russ asap, lakers will be insane and so would the nets
Kyrie is my hero. Morals, value, and vision is what’s key too a man.
If the nets trade kyrie they are not smart at all
This show is bad.  Rambling.  Blah blah blah.
Kyrie for Westbrook
Lost a lot of respect for Shannon and Stephen A for how they demonize this man for him standing on what he believes. There still isn’t enough info out on what they want to put in your arm and everybody just supposed to go with it. Heroes and life savers lose their job cuz they won’t get it ? Hold on something’s smells fishy and Kyrie calls bs. Salute to u my guy 💯
I'm sure you guys are WRONG.. KD has enough respect for another grown man to respect his decision.  They didn't and DON'T need to try to convince him of something that is not their business. It's just you controlled media guys pushing vaccines on free people that are spinning naratives.
Kyrie is a BIG problem for this discriminating law.  They are send everything they have after him.  Question Skip and Shannon, if the vaccine SAFE & Effective, how can Kyrie be a threat?
They pretending like reporters wasn’t asking kyrie what kind of father lebron was to him. He left Cleveland because they acted like he ain’t average 30 in the finals and bron did it alone
Unpredictable for not being vaccinated 😂😂😂 this world is sick
I’m all for personal choice. But I’m also for having to deal with the consequences of choice. In this situation just my opinion, Irving is coming off somewhat disingenuous as a way to get unnecessary attention because this voice of the people is going to lead whoever is fooling him in the wrong direction. I wouldn’t trade for Irving and his unpredictable behavior that for a team sport is terrible. Nets organization has a choice to make that’s in the best interest of their franchise....
A guy who thinks he's great.  Yet he never makes anyone around him better.  When he the main man the team is worse.  When he's hurt the team in better.  What good is he for a team.  Sign him and tell him please never play we are better off.   A talent that never does anything for a team.  Any team wanting him doesn't want to win because if you get him there's a good chance your team will actually get worse if he play.
Don't take that gene therapy shot. I love this brother
Wow these sheep are more worried about championships then human rights and morals. “Forget your health kyrie don’t you want a championship?”
We rocking w Kyrie
Shannon is an over animated SASmith.
Who’s knows what’s in the vaccine 💉
Trip on the way to the market 😂😂
Kyrie isn't the only high network individual to walk away from sports for health risk.
I'm not understanding they are calling Kyrie selfish for taking a stand but simultaneously sangus Lee says if he comes back that's a problem problem but wouldn't that be an example of being a good teammate he will be putting his personal beliefs to the side but there trying to change the nerve and say
Shannon never wants Kyrie to work again ..Listen to this clown...Shannon Sharpe is a complete sucka
Give me liberty or give me death. Patrick Henry.
Russian Roulette  No job is worth it!
Ask yourself this question! If the vaccine is safe then why isn't anybody who has been involved in making it and funding it, not getting it?
He thinks he's MLK but he's more like Kanye. LMFAO
Yeah yall are disappointing assainating this man Character
Kyrie doesn’t have COVID? Why can’t he play?
The NHL season just started, baseball postseason is going on, the NFL season and yet the only topic of discussion is Kyrie smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ a dam shame
So the world is upset because a man doesn't want to do something he's not comfortable with... Welcome to the land of the free... Smh! These big corporations are slowly taking your rights... Smh!
Let him go
But what happened to America land of the free. Seems like America ain't such a free place anymore the way this situation is going; basically get join the system or be banished from it simple
WWE or NBA . What’s more real ?
Poor Kevin Durant, he should have stay with the Warriors.
Can someone tell him he is standing alone, but man he is giving up 194 million for a free shot. Can someone tell Dave Chappelle, Kyrie left 194 million on the bus 😂
Trade him to the Thunder Americans are still free in OKC🇺🇸👍
Kyrie in Cleveland before Lebron never even came close to a .500 record
I'd rather have D'Angelo Russell back, than keep this guy.
People are on kyrie .we took covid19 shots in Guyana and now they are saying we are not acceptable I. Trinidad, american, and a few other places .the shot we took is t acceptable. Spodnic(spell?)
He's Bipolar.
Lebron dodged a bullet with this goofy Kyrie
Send him off to Sacremento
Kyrie let his ego get out of control while desperately trying to convince people he doesn't have one and that he's some down to earth guy. He was never "that guy" to begin with but swears he deserves that type of treatment and respect
Shannon and Skip explained it perfectly. Not like screaming Steven A. Smith.
they added a kyrie emoji 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Nah, Uncle Shay Shay. Kyrie is taking a stand and he not a head case. Athletes have more leverage and power now. He is an intelligent person willing to pull the levers of power. Don't blame him because he can do what your Gen could not do.
Nets about to offer draft picks until 2050 to OKC to take Kyrie
Kyrie doesn't wanna get vaccinated. Why is this so hard for you people to understand?
Shannon has became very enjoyable to listen to
I'm the first person to call Kyrie out, but he's not unpredictable. He beats to the tune of his own drum. Y'all should leave him alone. He's accepting the consequences, so it's nobody's business at this point. He isn't even encouraging anyone not to take it. Sure the Nets will suffer, but it's not Kyrie's fault New York altered the deal about exemptions. For all we know it might be against his religion to take the vaccine. At the end of the day it's just basketball. What is basketball compared to his beliefs about his body?
Emmy award winner just died form COVID-19 he was double Vax. Plus COVID survival rate for Kyrie age Groupe is 99.9975 lol.... Stand strong Kyrie !!
Both skip and shannon are very wrong on this topic ky can do what he wants why every ody want him to b vaccinated so bad
One thing after another
Is the vaccine in his Contract
No, Shannon KD and Harden knows that Kyrie isn’t going to change his mind. You will have to work around his wishes.
I’ve never heard him say that he wants to be a revolutionary I just see him being himself why does the media focus on putting words in peoples mouth the way they do. Times don’t really change I see. It’s really weird how if a person does not agree with everybody else’s choice and they choose to do their own thing they get demonized it seems.. They used to do the same thing to Iverson
Kyrie is cheating the system. Now his brand is "become the voice of the voiceless" and he still got paid $17 million WITHOUT DOING HIS JOB and im paying my hard earn money to watch the nba. Damn kyrie...
LeShannon want to push kyrie to be out of the nets so lebron would have a better chance of beating the them 🤔🤔🤔
Kd just wanna hoop and tweet from his burners and dassit 🙅🏾‍♀️
my god kyrie people have gone to school for 13 years and know that it is beyond stupid to think its a hoax bud
I just wanna know if Shannon is vaxxed 😭😗
Kyrie use to think the EARTH WAS FLAT...So yeah he's real smart...🤦‍♂️ LAKERS IN 5!
He’s going to Philly
What did he do wrong?
Kyrie pulling a Aaron Rodgers 😅
You want to call him a dumb flat earther. Fine. What is dumb is not letting the man do what he is good at; this is what control freaks do to talented people all the time in all walks of life not just basketball
He ain't playing , why are we still talking about this
Pff they even dont see whats going on huh!? It aint about damn basketball! Its about freedom of choise, freedom of right towards your own body! What is this stupid talk. They should back up Kyrie instead!! Fs what a shamefull world we live in!
why do ppl think he has high IQ?  cuz he’s 🏀 awareness?? the guy is uneducated and consistently says ignorant or stupid things — WHAT HIGH IQ 🧢 🥴🧃
Imagine crucifying a guy because he doesn’t want to get a vaccine that doesn’t protect u from covid and is killing people
Kyrie Irving is an Aries like me 😂😂😂😂 he’s gonna do whatever he wants 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I defend Kyrie because it is a control thing. They can't talk about him on the court so they do off. He has the most enviable talent, natural, not that he did not sharpen and hone it. Dan Gilbert set aside grudges used Kyrie as bait for the King to control the skills Kyrie had. There was no one who could do that in Cleveland then. Same as Boston. They can't tell him what to do on the court, so they find something else; Kyrie isn't the one with control issues.
Kyrie save the league all the trouble and retire...because YOU are not a team player. Buy yourself a MacDonalds franchise. I would fine him like Simmons for not playing
Shannon and Steven A both need to kick rocks because everyone isn't a sucka just because ya'll got that vaccine. Can't make a person got that in their body 💯
I Stand with Kyrie!
K.I is going to OKC, to be MIA,...🏀
he's going to play for the nets its his home town
Foolish pride 😂😂😂 his body his choice let the man make that decision the media is the reason so much is messed up mad because people aren't buying the b.s smh
Aint no one gonna trade for Kyrie… he would miss 4-8 games in cali, 4-8 games in new york… there are more cities  in other states that want to put those same laws in the next coming months.. AND, kyrie always misses games for “personal reasons”.. his salary is too much to swallow for any one team to just take it in the chin
1. I'm all in about being vaccinated. 2. Shannon's arguments are wrong. Kyrie said it's not about the money. meaning his decision to not being vaccinated, will not be depended on how much money he will lose becouse of it.  In the same breath, he said, "Do you realy think i want to lose all this money". thay are not contrediting statements.  3. Why do you bring up "well, i'm a tight end, so i want the ball all the time".  Getting the vaccin is realy not a decision you should do for your sport teamates, in the sport context. it's obviously about your surroundings health ect. but it realy shouldn't be about "helping your team to win a title".
Kyrie’s a fool, get rid of him if you can get value for him.
Crazy kd (and to lesser extent harden) came to the nets to play with kyrie so I'm surprised he would do this..he got a chip if he didn't he prob don't do this..ill be shocked if he does get the vacc to play at this point
What’s the point of the vaccine if u can still catch Covid and die from it ?
they hate for people to not fall in line lol Kyrie has his own mind and will live with the consequences of his choice
And of course these company Men are going to talk like this...  Skip and Shannon are old men. They are supposed to take the vaccine....
This is what the Nets get for trying to buy a championship. As a Celtics fan, I couldn't be more delighted to see them having to deal with Kyrie's drama. Hahaha 😂😂😂
I don’t see Tom Brady or araon Rodgers pushing people to take the jab
Being consistent is one of the best things we humans can do. Consistent in a good way is even better.
If LeBron had said- "I'm not taking the shot- no way, no how" Kyrie woulda been like- " I think it's best for me to be conscious of the well-being of my teammates and the universe by trusting the knowledge and experience of the physicians by taking the vaccine as a means of being a beacon of healthy living..."
So everyone on social media is gonna take random sources from Nick Wright saying he’d retire or Kyrie for Simmons trade would be great for both teams even tho both of those statements are incorrect. Then Kyrie hops on ig live stating himself that “You think I wanna lose money? You think I wanna give up on a team that wants to win a championship? Don’t believe that in retiring or don’t that I’m giving up this game” Can you guys bring up those actual statements and talk about those instead of following the typical random kyrie hate news that Nick Wrong made up.
when not discussing their favorites….this is the Best talk show on TV by mile
its actually funny how people actually defend kyrie in this situation. Hes such an odd person and not reliable at all. Sad cuz hes such a talent.
Without Kyrie the Nets chances are reallllllllly out the window for a ring...💨😄💨! Barring injury LA is winning it all any way with their roster.....if you have ANY memory you know Harden falls asleep in the playoffs...😶. Chill with your $100+million Kyrie.....somebody in the League will call you....👍🏾
A transfer worker most of the time it's trouble either it's to lazy to work or don't get along with others! So why would any other team should make that transfer 🤔?! His not bigger than the game.  Basketball was here before he was on this flat earth like he says! He made enough money 💰 and I think no team should take a chance with this dude.. but I tell you this the dude it's a beast with his handles! A beast 💪
Kyrie is the best WR in nascar 🔥
A mind is a terrible thing to waste! Ever since the stomp on Celtic logo cursed him!!
You stupid he said they made him promises as devils do and then play the victim
The operative term is coercion. They claim it is his choice, but really? Is that what you are saying? In fact he is being demonized as anti-team, insubordinate, unpredictable, precisely because ostensibly, it is his choice, which only makes Kyrie look worse
Westbrook for Kyrie!!! make it happen!
What if next year everybody who got the vaccine drops dead I don't hear none of these mofos talking the long term effects not one person is speaking on that
Shannon Sharpe provided no context to Kyrie's career, when Kyrie was with Cleveland before Lebron he was playing on a terrible team with guys like Alonzo Gee, Dion Waiters, Anthony Bennett, etc. I'm a Bulls fan, a traditional regional rival to Cleveland, Bulls and Cavs are both Central teams that play eachother alot so I witnessed Kyrie's early career in Cleveland a lot back in the day. Kyrie was always a baller but Kyrie never had a squad that gave him a chance the way their roster was poorly constructed. Kyrie was also EXTREMELY young at the time and hadn't peaked yet. Half the people bashing Kyrie didnt start watching the Cavs until Lebron came back. They cant even name Kyrie's teammates pre-Lebron and have zero knowledge of how horribly ran the Cavaliers were in Kyrie's early career.  Kyrie has also been injured in 3/4 of the seasons since he left Cleveland. The only legit chance he had to lead a team on his own was Boston where he couldn't stay healthy. His sample size is small due to injuries or having played on bad teams (pre Lebron Cavaliers) yet no one provides this context when they say "he cant be the number one guy". It feels like Shannon puts down Kyrie to elevate Lebron which is funny since Lebron has never won an NBA Finals without major help. Lebron wouldnt even have come back from 3-1 without Kyrie Irving, Kyrie hit the game winner which the media wants you to forget since they emphasis Lebron blocking Iguodala MORE than they do the actual shot that won the game. Let's speak facts.
No kyrie lakers in 4 lol
They more worried about Kyrie than Gruden
I find it strange they heard exactly what was on his mind and what his issues was and continue to ignore it but then decide to formulate their own narratives ....smh
More and more I’m losing respect for Shannon sharpe because he says he’s respects both sides of the vaccination but steady criticizes people who don’t get the  vaccination because he says “He wants to get back to normal” news flash Shannon things will never be normal again bruh …
Kyrie got them scared 😨
Freedom is priceless. Stay strong Kyrie.
He wanted to run the show in cleveland. Send him back 😂😂😂
Kyrie is aware he's alert he's woke! He a spiritual person not a religious person. With that being said there's a different type of mentality and thought process.
Come to Chicago Kyrie!
And in a few months when the vaccines wear off what is the NBA's plan? Boosters mandate next?
Stop forcing people to get these vaccines it should be a choice
NYC is done with World B Flat. Boston can’t stand him. Cleveland hates him.  His value in the league has plummeted.  Other teams don’t want an unreliable drama king.  Time for the league to say, “we’re done.”  He has no business being a role model for kids while actively FIGHTING to get more people killed.
So are the organizations being professional when they trade a player while they’re suiting up and they find out through a text from someone else and not the team 🤨
LAKERS is watching 👀 🤔🤔
Stand strong Kyrie 💪
Nobody has the rights to whatever Kyrie chooses to do with his OWN BODY!
Neither one of them mentioned how insane it is for the NBA to require an experimental medical procedure and then threaten all the players with the loss of their livelihood.  Shame on EPSN
Why isn't the MLB or NHL being forced to get vaccinated?
You guys have been too friendly and agreeing too much 🤣🤣 , I need Tom Brady to get blown out tomorrow so I can see Shannon talk Spicy
Kyrie to Philly we need that
Crazy how a man becomes a villain just cuz he doesn’t want to get vaccinated
You can't depend on Simmons either.
Talking heads. What a job.
I can't believe that these two gentlemen agree for once! It's amazing!    Poor Kyrie
Dont do it kyrie. I cant believe all the ones that took it? Money is a very powerful thing.
No team should trade for him. Every social issue stops him from doing what his job is.....that is basketball. I understand things are bigger but you cant have it both ways. Retire, but you cant do your own thing own company time. Plus hes always injured.
Kyrie is one of the best loseres in NBA history without Bron he's got a 38 percent WP (off my head) Remember the narrative that Westbrook was a bad team guy??? Nope... It was Irving all along
Shannon F u helping tear down Kyrie. Sellout..
OH! so skip only makes sense when they aren't talking about Lebron ?
You ain’t alone Kyrie half of America stands wit you
History is filled with stories about what happens when people stop thinking and decide to 'go along to get along'
This stuff is to much if a man don't want to get jab than so be it. If you are protecting yourself smfh
Hes going play he's not going lose 40 million  dollars
thank goodness these two have devoted and entire week to bash this clown into oblivion
Every news media outlet is hating on kyrie. This is wild but we know the truth s/o to Kyrie✊🏾
Kyrie won't play for his team unless its his way but he also won't retire so he can free up a roster spot and give the Nets their best chance to win. He claims to be all about his team but he's holding them hostage by refusing to budge. He might as well be untradeable too bc who gonna risk this dude flaking and retiring?
Let ‘em retire so we can get off this.
Kobe death messed this dude up
Unpredictability
i haven't seen undisputed in months and is it bad if I don't know if they switch the women presenter
So sad always downing a black brother 🤦🏽‍♂️this is so sad stop downing your own kind and look at the positive he does . Talk about the positive sometimes nobodies perfect and you can’t force a vaccine on anybody. SO what if doesn’t play , he’s still a leader and helped and various of ways.
They should trade Kyrie for Damian Lillard that would be NASTY!!!
Freedom mother fuckers! Go Kyrie
Maybe this was the plan the whole time once James harden came he wanted to find a way out.. Maybe he wants to be the man that bad.
Its amazing how these dudes come on TV an try to tell us what these basketball an football stars be thinking
Cm punk in basketball 🤝
I am not sure from what Kyrie claimed if he is implacable. An in depth interview of CP3 in the twilight of his career after making finals on major network, halftime maybe on Sun., about getting vaxed, and then getting Covid, might help
10:08 stop twisting the narrative before  the season He was promised that he would be able to play without the vaccine
Skip full Vulcan on this episode
"He would suddenly look foolish if he caved and went back"   Only a coward and a fool can't recognize a mistake and apologize/make things right.
Priorities for these ballers: ball > freedom
Salute to the Heart Break Kid Kyrie Irving!!!💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Straight slander last 3 mins
This is hard to listen to The guy just wants freedoms and rights as a human being but they are making him look like a villain and mental illness is way more important than f****** basketball or to play for fans
Kyrie should demand a trade to a texas team there's no vac mandate for work so he wont have as big of a  problem.
He has the right to say NO
Ratings will be higher if Kyrie plays without the vaccine than if he doesn't play with the vaccine. He just is the most exciting player to watch in the NBA now unfortunately
I think Kyrie is a genius, this is the perfect load management strategy. Because of his injuries Kyrie's body cannot play the entire 82 games without being injured. KD and Harden can easily handle the regular season games. The Nets are preparing for a healthy BIG 3 for the Playoffs.  Kyrie already did this for him not to be traded and still to get Harden.
This Collin kapernick all overrr again ! Stand 10 toes down bro ! We with you Kyire !
What  would  y’all do  if you the owner of the team that’s kyrie is playing for?
Kyrie sometimes has bad timing but he did say before all this happened the league said their would be exemptions for those who didn’t want to be vaccinated. If that the case then the league backtracked. If I’m wrong chime in, I’m just on the outside looking in.
I love this show regardless, but damn it’s a way better show when they not talking abt MJ or LBJ
Trade Iring for the 76s to help Embid getting more Buckets
A Football player has no business talking about the money other Sportsmen make. Football players are the lowest paid Sportsmen in Sports!!!  BTW, Ben Simmons has returned to the 76ers!!!  Championships are so great right? So, why are Championship Winners SELLING THEIR RINGS & OTHER HARDWARE???  The truth is that Kyrie has done something that NONE OF YOU EVER WOULD!!!  ALL MONEY AIN'T GOOD MONEY!!! If it is the end of Kyrie's NBA CAREER, who's business is it???  You guys aren't going to lose a DIME & THE NBA WILL NOT GO OUT OF BUSINESS!!!  It's Kyrie's business, his life, HIS DECISION...MAYBE HE WANTS OUT OF THE NBA...DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT???
Pretty sure Kyrie will be even less excited about raising taxes if he doesn't play and his salary is cut in half
So Kyrie should sell his soul for money and championships?  These dudes are lame.  Kyrie answers to a higher power and to what is in his heart.  His strategy will pay off in the long run while these fools will continue gnashing their teeth in anger.
If anybody thinks kyrie doesn’t care about the money should better wake up to reality. He would never say that 7 years ago.
Man unk seems more like uncle these days
Im glad Kyrie has a mind of his own and is not following everybody else if he doesn't want to get vaccinated he doesn't have to get vaccinated, my man people have rights🙌🏿🙏🏿
I think Irving NBA days are numbered. Hopefully he dosent end up like so many broke athletes.
You can complain about politicizing the Pandemic but can't ignore the reason Kyrie is more germane to the 🏀/vax question than CP3 is political
Kyrie for Russ.
So we gonna act like magic Johnson didn’t play with aides!!! 😒
This is like when you refer a friend to a job that you got hired at and he comes in tweakinggg
He now has time to visit the edge of earth.
18/20
I said it yesterday, they will frame this a certain way, and that's what they're doing. I knew they'd show clips without context and label him aloof. The sad part is, people will watch this and take it as gospel instead of doing their due diligence. There's a reason newspapers are written at an 8th grade level. They understand that their audience only cares about the quote, not the full article.
Take the vaccine or continue to lose money - Shannon sharpe so you’re finally admitting it’s being forced thank you!!
When skip is calm like this he is easily the best to talk sports 🐐
Am a Kyrie fan but he’s a selfish dude look at Durant and harden both are way richer than him but still out there yet they could have both decided to sit out coz no one wanted the vaccine but it’s protocol fakkkk Kyrie
It's a simple case of knowing your worth.. he could do something that don't sit right and it could still work but a lot of people don't know their worth or they bet too much I guess we will see
Well I know when these guys don’t like a player
When those that got sick and or took the vax punish those that didn't get sick, like their contagious
The vaccine machine has all of their puppets going hard at Kyrie
The fact that u think 🤔 they giving u a vaccine...... that's not even made for u 😕😒 this country is a business its meant to heal you *****
He has a right to make a choice tf
Question when the swine flu was going around did ya get your flu shots!????
I’m sorry Shannon, but that’s not true, employer’s nowadays would threaten you if you don’t come in, you’re fired
Next Kyrie saga: " I was abducted by aliens, i saw Fox Mulder's sister"
kyrie is superficial if it’s his problem it’s important but the 4.5 mil people that have lost someone to this it doesn’t matter he’s such a hypocrite
Why can he choose what the Fk he wants in his body and do with his own MF body??!! His playing in NBA for a great.. great reasons🔥. It wasn't y'all opinion what to do with himself got him playing in NBA?!! WTF??🤔 If one men refuse to take the vaccine out of his Team big deal move on  Leave the man alone!! Respect Mr kyrie's 🙏🏾🙏🏾 do what makes you feel free.Make money do let money make You!!
Looks like after he got that 2016 chip he hasn’t had love for the game anymore
They can take that banner down lol
Kyrie has had plenty of time to make a decision. Kyrie over analyzes things keeps taking in more and more information which causing him to have fear of making the wrong decision. He has went down the rabbit hole on many of topics. This is who he is. He misses games because he says he needs some time because of what's going on in the world. His brain gets over stimulated and he gets stuck in a loop of processing information.
🗣️🎶TEMPORARY LLAAAAY-OFF!
There's a lot of really smart guys in the NBA.  Kyrie is not one of those guys.  Not just because of this but he was a flat earther too.   You can't fix stupid....
Shannon Buckdancing is pitiful!!
JENNY LOOKIN GOOD says DAME 4 KYRIE end of soap opera
Undisputed!! Squad!
So basically they’re saying “shut up and dribble!”…. 🤔…. Why is it so wrong that he does not want to be “Forced” to having something injected into his body? 👀👀. How about respecting his choice about his own body? My body my choice? 👀
The media pushing the agenda that kyrie is not being clear on what he’s doing. You guys are pushing that he picks and chooses and that he’s emotional. Hop on his junk
🤔🤔🤔16,700 NYC officers refuse the jab Over 60 Officers died from the vid! They aren’t forced! They show up to work and police the city!
Come to Denver
This whole issue with Covid is just the thing they needed to cause these kinds of divisive & political landscape! Your freedoms vs the so-called betterment or health of your fellow citizens! Getting the vaccine has become to straw to break the camel's back in this country! Another war type scenario! The vaccinated (the sheeple) vs the unvaccinated (the wolves) which is just another way to cause dissention! Is this vaccine a guarantee has it been tested for long term affect or is just a gamble a trust of faith on the part of each living human being?? I for one stand behind Kyrie's decision on this particular subject! It's his right & his obligation to look out for himself & his family! But what about the others you ask well they have their rights also to accept it or deny it! If this means kyrie doesn't play well so be it but it shouldn't be a death sentence for him! But because of the way the NBA NFL & others are structured it's all about the status quo! This is preposterous & quite dangerous America! Educate yourselves ppl  & don't believe the hype!!  Numbers do lie & so does our government!!!
The bottom line is it's the media people blowing this whole Kyrie thing up. Kyrie is 100% right. It's HIS BODY. He signed to the NBA, not to be a scientific experiment.
Proud not prideful
Kyrie Irving isn't unpredictable...Kyrie Irving is weird!! Just say that
So much drama with Kyrie year after year after year. Personally im exhausted with his mental issues or whatever is going on in his head. In fact he ruined a clash of 2 superteams we were all waiting to see, NETS vs LAKERS that is. I was defending Kyrie all this time but after this im done with the dude. If i had a team i wouldnt even be bothered to have him on my roster. Period
I understand Kyrie for being like this because I had the same belief but when it came to decide for my family... I didn't think twice for the vaccine... I remember my parents were like please son? "Think about others". And rest is history... And know this, I always believe in making your body immune naturally...
Its a mandate not a law,there is a difference,respect a persons right to choose
I love undisputed but I think they're wrong on Kyrie.. 🤷🏽‍♂️ still love the show..
I love how entertainment is worth more than a human life , these athletes do not own their bodies
It’s bigger than basketball
I respect both parties let's move on and trade him. Regardless between his mental break and injuries he's not playing all season
I watch basketball simply because of Kayrie, Harden, and Durant. I am from Namibia and I am 41 years old. But there are certain players who have Mastered their craft that can influence the populous. I REPECT AND SUPPORT KYRIE he elevated NBA and I’d he he stands by his conviction than so be it.
Brah if they were to trade him for a John Murrant😳😳😳. Unfairrr. Memphis wouldn’t. I’m just saying.
Just move on from kyrie that’s it shouldn’t know 1 man stop the show!
Shannon is always right. Kyrie is a pawn
Trade him,, not worth all his fuss.
Kyrie is doing what he should have the right to do plain and simple 💪🏾✊🏾💯
I'm glad he's not getting vaccinated.   Stand on your square young man.
Imagine if the Lakers turned around and traded Westbrook for Kyrie or even Ben Simmons. They would be so nasty!!!
😅. They politicking for the man again?
Stand with kyrie
Kyrie is a Boss for standing Firm 💯
Bottom line we can't predict what the future holds, so he could do this again next season for whatever comes up. Last year he missed a lot of games for whatever he claims he needed to do or deal with.
No guys, Kyrie just pointed out that a check to check guy like myself is forced to take it or be homeless. THATS FORCE NOT CHOICE
"that's the only ship that matters" did indeed make me chuckle
A possibility that was not mentioned is that these vaccine mandates could very well be held unconstitutional by the courts. Half the people of color in many major cities are unvaccinated. So we are going to deny millions of black and brown people the right to enter a resteraunt, go to school, or hold a job? I don't see this as being practical, and certainly not good politics never mind the question of legality so I think the mandates get struck down and Kyrie becomes eligible to play again. As for the other baggage, you take the bad with the good for talent like that and try to give him a supportive environment.
Can Shannon make a free throw?
Foolish skip is more like it
Why is vaccination being pushed when you can still catch it and pass it after getting vaccinated? I got vaccinated, but I don’t agree with the mandates. America is supposed to be all about freedom right? If Kyrie doesn’t want the vaccine, then it shouldn’t be pushed upon him, especially since it doesn’t make a difference unless you don’t have the antibodies to fight the virus, which Kyrie already has cuz he’s young. Only 3 teams out of 30 are pushing this, it doesn’t make sense to me. NBA should have taken the NFL approach and only educate the players about the vaccine rather than pushing them to get it and not letting them play if they don’t.
Kyrie sitting laughing at y’all now keep feeding into it
Oh sweet Lord Jesus please let my KINGS get Uncle Drew? 🙏
As an OKC Fan I guess it’s not surprising they’re always involved in trade scenarios lol
Kyrie Irving  hasn’t been the same sense He left Cleveland
So many poor and black people need a voice. That's the cause he chooses to fight for? It's sad, childish and a waste of opportunities. And for what? To defend far right politics designed by white rich people to favor white rich people.
If sixers can make sure that kyrie will sign back they should trade ben for him
Can Shannon even brush his teeth lefthanded?
The funny 😂 thing is Kyrie said for us to be logical: If the Nets only have to pay you 1/2 your salary & then can get rid of you after this season it seems Kyrie's not being logical!!😂😂😂
It's his choice glad he took a stand. Kyrie a man for that
LMAOOOO GROWN MEN ON TV AND ALL THE SOURCES. STILL SPEAKING ON SPECULATION
Best talk show hands-down 🙏🙏🙏
Shannon : "Skeeeeeeep...."
Ppl make a big deal cuz he don’t wanna take a shot that don’t work 🤡
Kyrie has ONE year left on his contract, Simmons has FOUR on his contract... Those are NOT equal trade terms! Just stop.
He’s waiting for the lakers to call
As a basketball fan, sure, I would love if he can just get vaxxed and GET BACK TO BUSINESS. But as an American citizen, i'm actually gaining respect for him because he's actually following through with his principles. LeBron would NEVER give up money or do anything like this.
Why is it a problem to have your own opinion on anything 🤔
Are the Nets missing a piece or is Kyrie missing a piece?
0:01 Skip talks boring.🤭 Shannon talks boring. 🤭 Kyrie plays basketball bo____ uhh, why we talking about him 🧐
I hate that corporate culture doesn't let ppl have there own opinions, personality, character, moral, and way of life... they call it bucking the system... maybe the system is in the wrong treating ppl like objects just because they give them money.. sometimes in substantial amounts
People in the comments saying Kyrie is “acting up” or “needs to get in line” as if he’s a child that can’t make decisions for himself 🤦🏿‍♂️😂 he’s an adult, he can decide whether or not he wants to get the shot. Him wanting to play for the Nets with KD, or the millions of dollars he’s been paid doesn’t trump him being an adult who can make his own decision. Give it a rest and stop it with these regurgitated points that ESPN ”analysts” drilled into your heads 😂😂
I think he wants out of Brooklyn.
Solution: trade Irving to back to Cleveland, since he wants to be “the Man”…
Kyrie needs to get fired
Trade him for westbrook lol
I brought up the Ben for Kyrie trade weeks ago as a joke but to hear them actually talk about it like it could happen is crazy lol media really having a field day about this
Who are the voiceless that don't want to take the vaccine anybody that didn't want to take the vaccine one doesn't have to take it too can say they don't want to take it
Tabloid press bad journalism 🏀/Covid first person real sportscasters think of, somebody who actually got to the finals, CP3, got the shot, then got covid
Kyrie wants to be Kaepernick... 1. Kaepernick's fight in packed in more people it wasn't about personal choice 2. You see who kaepernick's playing for now
THE TRUMP SHOT IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE.
Shannon sharpe people starting to not like u bra.u need to worry about yourself.the man say he aint takin nothin an i agree
I thought new York just passed religious exemption
He’s always injured
Drop him and black list him for spreading lies
No team will trade for him, he’s a headache and he’s always injured.
So yall love Shannon's take for saying exactly what Stephen A is saying all along ?
Somethings are bigger than your job, sports, etc..Whatever that is for you don't compromise your self for nothing or no one.
Much respect to kyrie for not bowing down to the democrat nazis destroying peoples lives.
It’s funny how a personal medical decision matters in basketball lmfaooo
Kyrie is %100 correct while the NBA and anti Kyrie people are just dumb AF and wrong  Vaccine is unconstitutional plain and simple and it goes against the science  I have natural immunity it's still in effect 17 months later. Ok being fair pretty sure I got covid a month ago but if I did man it was so damn mild round two I am not sure I was sick.  Under 35 years old in ALL of the US take a second and guess how many Covid deaths there are per the CDC   Around 10k  Survival rate is %99 non vaccinated so the increase ur protection us splitting hairs and again natural immunity stronger and lasts longer  Zero merit to a mandate EVERYONE should support Kyrie as Americans our liberties are paramount
I stand with Kyrie, Let's go Brandon!
Send him to the rockets Abbott sign EO where you can't force anyone to take the jab. Too bad our team sucks right now! lol
Trade Kyrie for Westbrook and trade griffin for Adams
Welp, there goes the nets championship
Kyrie man just get the shot so they can move on to another topic. it's not about personal choice or health. It's about basketball and pleasing your fans 😶
If you care so much about those unvaccinated losing their jobs well he's still getting paid to not show up. Maybe he started fun to pay those people's bills that he cares so much about.
I’m not a kyrie fan but I stand with him on this. Skip and sharp are out of line with this one. Why would kyrie need to apologize if he decides to get the vaccine and play? I think they skip and sharp need to stick to sports and stay out of science
*_I just became a huge fan of this man! I love how being firm on your own medical decisions is considered being selfish. The man refused to be coerced into putting something in his body he didn’t want to. This is called integrity. It isn’t a weakness._*
Have a friend like Kyrie...always going against the grain for everything....with everyone else always having to accommodate...after a while it got exhausting....ummm...a global pandemic is not about 1 person...
People are questioning Kyrie's sanity. Who are the paranoids here? A consistent campaign strategy of liberals during elections like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert has been accusing conservatives of fear mongering. Who are the real fear mongers on Covid? Canada closed the border until next month apparently, over Covid. Young in shape athletic, yeah Kyrie knows he exists, that doesn't make him a Narcissist. 78% who die of Covid are overweight. Body Positive liberals only want the old and infirmed to be afraid. I don't blame Kyrie for his fearlessness. Isn't madness frequently acquainted with fear?
We can give kyrie for dame so I don’t care what ky does
😂
So you are recriminating a guy for standing for something he believes in? It makes 0 sense for a extremely healthy  person to be force to take the vaccine, but you guys dont want that conversation to happen. Sad that Shannon doesn't see Kyries point this time.
Kyrie is the next CM Punk
shannon going over the same points all week bro it's not this serious
Hey Nets just release him and tell him don't ever show your face here again
Thanks Karlie for not exposed LJ to this BS.  Vaya con Dios.
This is stupid the man doesn't want to take the vaccine who cares its his choice
Kyrie is a headcase, stay away, especially at that price tag. Doesn't matter how good might be if you don't know if he's in or out.
can you get infected if you are vaccinated? Yes. can you pass it on despite being vaccinated? Yes the coercive measures are just wrong.  Kyrie> Kaepernick
Why do Y’all believe because u get a certain amount of money that u should just shut up and do whatever people tell you to do, what happened to standing up for what u believe in
Disappointed in Shannon, he shucking and jiving and buck dancing here 🤦🏾‍♂️
Alone ? Maybe you and your nba sellouts but naw false again really do you guys ever speak the truth in public puppets ? Kyrie has the world backing him real men and real women alike forever all the way home ! .
Kyrie will be just fine whether he gets back in the NBA or not. It's the media that doesn't understand a player that will give it up and stand on his principles when challenged.
I don't think he wants to play anymore.
These type of men are the reason why we are in this Position
I hope the first take is watching see even tho skip is a hater but his basketball knowledge amazing he knows how to talk basketball unlike SAS who only knows how to yell and talk loud and say stupid stuff 😶🤨
A human will never see a round Earth 🌎 it will always appear to be flat to the eyeball so the earth is flat it feet flat on it u won't ever see both sides of a round Earth only one side of a flat
Keep standing Kyrie‼️
Life is more then basketball now they are talking about him missing games in the past we are talking about people losing jobs in a so called free country and these dude are missing the point
I get kyrie might of been a problem in the past but why is the media trying to paint him out to be a bad guy because he doesn’t want to get a shot that doesn’t benefit anything but yet the world has brainwashed everybody to get it , Y’all wrong about this 1
Kyrie is just not smart enough. There was a simple way to get down from that tree he climbed, he could've said he spoke to several doctors, and after doing that research he will take the vaccine. Instead, he doubled down on stupidity by saying it's not about the vaccine at all but about the mandate, which didn't exist when he decided no to get vaccinated.   There are other vaccine mandates, there are other things you have to comply with if you want to keep a job, and most people have taken this vaccine anyway. He's fighting for a tiny minority of crazy people and for politicians he fought against up until now.   Kyrie is the kind of person who hears something and attaches to that without checking the facts, then a week later he hears something else and attaches to that. It's probably why he keeps changing religions.   The worst part for his basketball career is that now any team that signs him would know he might not show up. He's unreliable. Teammates will hate him for that, especially with the amount of money (and salary cap space) he will take. Can you imagine a co-worker making a lot more than you and choosing when they show up for work while you're grinding every day?
Accountability does not mean can I count on a person it means do you own what you’re responsible for doing
So Shannon want sports stars to protest for George Floyd , but not stand up for THEMSELVES with a vaccine they know nothing about 🤦🏿‍♂️
Winning titles is more than a person's long term health?. Sharp is either ignorant, or playing ignorant. Have you done research into what's exactly in the vaccine. Since when does health demand a panacea approach? Idiot! Even something as healthy as an almond can cause an allergic reaction. You don't go out handing out bags of almonds to every kid you see because it's healthy.   If you can't blindly pass out a f*cking almond to every American walking, what makes you two embeciles think that a rushed vaccine, one of which has never been done having  MRNA capabilities is okay to inject into every human walking?   I love this show ONLY when sports is the topic. You two are nothing more than talking heads used by the media to push for vaccines. Even the producers of the vaccine state emphatically that the vaccine does NOT protect you from COVID-19. 10 years from now we'll see how the health is for those who chose to get multiple injections and boosters. Healthy is not a popularity contest. You have to make a choice that is good for you. Just becuase thr majoirty of NBA players are taking the jab, doesn't mean Kyrie should follow the sheeple. I respect him for having his own mind.
Let’s talk about dudes actually playing now
Demons in suits
"Skiiiiiiiiiiiiiuuup" lol. Shannon Sharpe is my guy!!!
Kyrie’s next step is going to say the league should let the players decide the schedule and game days because it’s unfair and takes away their freedoms to have to work a schedule made by the league.
believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything -colin kaepernick
Selfish is the only moniker Kyrie is worthy of
Some things I don’t agree with Kyrie but on this vaccine topic I agree with him!!!!! And some of the things are being said in the media don’t fit with what’s he’s talking about and doing! If and when he gets vaccinated he never said he’s against it he’s doing on his terms and not ours or the organizations!! Y’all bashed Lebron for saying he and his family is vaccinated and y’all said he didn’t do or said enough! 😂😂😂😂 just remember they let magic Johnson play with aids!! Look where things have came to! Get a vaccine get rich
Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe are very mean today with Kyrie Irving, he has issues and it seam like they do not care about his metal heath all they care about is that he not playing basketball.
🧛🏻‍♂️🦝
lmao even if he is ready to play he’s injury Prone. Kyrie is a huge gamble anywhere
Kyrie Irving need to go get that money take the vaccine Need to start worry about what other people say and go get go get that money keep playing around you won’t have no job
Hey Kyrie if you read this... NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU STANDING UP FOR ANTI-VACCINATORS. You are NOT a visionary. You believe the damn Earth is FLAT!   You need to learn to be ACCOUNTABLE kiddo.
He doesn't want your injection. All the things he's banned from taking due to the NBA but he decides to personally ban 1 thing from his body and this is a problem?
Y’all remember first take?
Basketball ain't life. No job or career is life. Only God is life. And if the Holy Spirit tell you not to get the shot, then do what he says and rebuke every demon that tell u to do otherwise
He don't want to give up the money but a mandate is forcing him to
So are you pro choice or nah?
Kyrie might as well stand on what he believe and retire
Kyrie is not alone in this
Alot of ppl gonna have to Apologize to kyrie just like they did kapernick.. the intelligent logical ppl can never see what a visionary sees.. ppl called kanye crazy for spazzing out now he's a powerhouse in fashion
Da lifestyle kyrie wants to live da religion he believes in how he ultimately views da world.. doesn't go together with da NBA n da rest of da commercial world..its like a square not only trying to fit in a circle ..it's trying to live n get paid n it to... now dats damn near impossible
Life is am-predictable!! The reality is you are full of it when you think the pandemic has an easy Answer !! He’s not alone he can be complicated
Shannon da show out for the Masonic boss Sharp 🙌
Kyrie for Ben Simmons lmaooooo....sooo it’s better to have choker Ben and choker harden with Ex-Choker KD lmaooo plz stop ... we want killer kyrie not scardy cat Ben along scardy cat playoff harden ...
The Nets don't need 3 superstars in their prime anyway. I'm glad Kyrie is acting up.
Kyrie is just attention seeking since the Cleveland days, Boston, and now Brooklyn. He wants so much attention on him , it's just the Illuminati movement, the idea is for people to forget what actually matters
Shannon is right friendships come and go, but championships are forever, MJ and Pippen are an example.
Shannon you a clown
Kyrie thinks he's this generation's Ali or something, except he has half the intelligence and charisma.
Lol the league got kyrie F up
KD coulda stayed in Golden State….instead…
lol
It's so sad because he's not killing nobody by not taking it and the thing is you can still get covid with the shot as well... what a oxymoron that is.. Kyrie I'm with you 200%
Everyone in American has a Reasonable Expectation Of Privacy and THAT"S LAW and Emotion!
Kyrie's credibility is hurt because of his past antics. I do wonder though had this been KD or a combination of all 3 guys saying they're not getting vaccinated would Sean marks and others still have that same energy? Hypothetical of course so we won't know, but whether making stands for or against vaccine mandates, it needs not be out of convenience. I respect Kyries choice to stand and respect the organizations choice to protect their players in how they feel best but always do it with integrity. Don't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason. The 'why' of the thing is the foundation".
01:47 ..finally..somebody from the media saying what i been saying for years. If kyrie n love werent hurt cavs wouldve won that first finals against warriors... Then repeat..no kd Wouldve happened..no dynasty...dubs got lucky
Lol what is kyrie going through? All that sage getting to his head.
Stay strong black man ✊🏾
In the Words of Muhammad Ali aka Nation Of Islam aka The People's Champion and I QOUTE "I don't have to BE, what YOU Want Me To Be, Am free to be WHO I  WANT BE and THINK what I WANT TO THINK"(BOOM)! Kyrie Irving is a "Conscientious Objector" with Freedom of Expression to BOOTH! Learn Your Law's and History Folks!
I guess ALLEN IVERSON was a dumb person too when he didn't wanna do the dress code.. he kept his braids in his hair and he gave other people/fans hope and loved him for taking a stand. That made him strong..  OK Rosa Parks she sat in the front of the bus instead of the back.. these people TOOK A STAND and changed history and many more..  you people are showing yall are weak minded   and just listen to what everyone tells you to do.. Take a stand.. he's choosing his body over money and millions, tell me that's not strong‽
Funny how these guys say the same thing SAS does but everybody hates SAS for saying it.
No to Communist dictatorship mandates. My body, my choice, not government's.
Skip stay with the quips. The only ship  the championship ship lmao 🤣
John Wall for Kyrie trade coming..  I can hope.  Come to Htown and teach some youngsters
About Chris Paul and OKC, not only did they make the playoffs they took the Rockets to game 7 and it was a very close game.
Shannon, I used to respect you. Today you totally lost my respect. You are a Kyrie hater.
Can you switch it up y'all talk about the same thing everyday y'all talked about Kyrie yesterday the day before y'all never talk about boxing baseball's always just football love football number one sport but the show is the same everyday
Kyrie is such a drama queen I'm glad the nets won't give him an extension it's just like when he was with the Celtics 🤦
The claw was taking days off just as much as kyrie...if not more.
He thought the world was flat 🤦‍♂️ enough said, just get the damn shot or retire. Don't care either way
Lmaooo kyrie  would've got that bag and neveerrr went back to work bruh
Man F that vaccine!! Stand for something or fall for anything!! 💪🏽🖤✊🏽
Kyrie, stand your ground. Your health and family is more important. Money can't buy your health. Don't take the poison.  These two don't give a... About you.
His body his choice! entertainment and money is secondary
Kyrie is the best, the media is the problem
Lakers 👀👀👀
Then look how they are trying to dissect him by talking on all his flaws....where was this when he wasn't woke Kyrie. This is exactly how they try and do you when you decide to get off the hamster wheel.
Playing in the NBA is a not a 9-5 job Shannon....
Kyrie is a MAGA hero
Shannon, Kyrie just doesn't have that championship DNA and you know what that is from your own experience in winning a Super Bowl.
He is standing for something and skip he is not going in this alone he got a lot of little people that's standing behind him how y'all gone try to tarnish this man for saying people shouldn't be losing their lively hood over a shot that is a result of respiratory failure when there is no cure for respiratory failure only things to do to prevent symptoms and ask any Muslim in the league if they would eat Pork to play and see what they say amd LeBron needed him just as much as he needed him and skip where was LeBron at when the team needed him last season walked off to the looker room on his team
illuminati is not a conspiracy theory, there is enough evidence to show that by now
Without Ky Brooklyn ain’t making it out the East 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Keep doing what you’re doing bro!
Kyrie better Vax that thang up😂. No team is going to trade for him. What else is he going to do??? Acting😂😭.
Trade Kyrie for Ben Simmons. 😂
I think at this point he needs to see a professional for his sake.
Question is who is gonna take him if he isn't gonna play
We’re listening to people who never stood up for anything but making themselves more money
Shannon has definitely sold out at this point. I don't even need to discuss Skip. All these sports shows and you telling me every single one has the same opinion. Talk about pushing the agenda.
How funny and ironic that Skip is now trying to display Kyries nba history. But for the last 10 years he trashed Lebron and said he only won rings because of kyrie. Nowwwwwwww it’s kyrie isn’t that good and he’s a “sidekick”. Lol they’re playing with you all’s emotions.
Black Players Start your own league,B1.
Kyrie is a unifying talking point - almost everyone thinks this guy has lost it.
Did they AWOL Kyrie for that absence?
Go Kyrie!! I support you .. Go Hawks!
Oh Shannon is up his nuts even though Kylie is antivax. Typical. Kyrie is a Mans Man. Take note. Woke Losers.
Planet Flat Earth from another univserse is looking for point guard on their Basketcube league.
We stand with Kyrie
just to let yall know they had 3 separate segments on kyrie this morning 😂 that goes to show you how big of a deal this is
Kyrie 💪💪💪💪💪💯💯💯💯💯
Not a yes man.
Stand for your freedom kyrie… and keep cashing those away game checks …. If u have the vac u can still get and pass it so what are we talking about
Sixers have demonstrated that they support great individuals. So this is why. OKC will never deserve .
Why y'all talking about the Bills players?
Only way Kyrie plays is if the state of NY loosens up the law just for him…
Who’s going to trade for an anti-vax loony? The other players are going to have none of that.
I knew this would eventually be what the media would do, ridicule Kyrie and make it seem he is crazy. Where is flat earth and illuminati coming from now?
dude is not a Team player. the world is not his team. KD and Harden handling this better than Embiid handled his disappointment with Simmons. they should probably just go ahead and call it what it is though.
So put a kids game  over something in your body that we don’t really know what’s in it there come on stop that smh
KD Kyrie James harden just laughing at theses reporters shows
Should be removed from the nba, go play in China, enjoy playing without a vaccine there.
Its funny how shannon can talk about one of skips teams ,thats in the fire, very seriously...   But when skip see the lakers in turmoil he laughs and say " i told you so"...   👀 Yall dont see that?
I’m a lifelong Bronco fan. SS has now become the same people he despised earlier in his career. Huge hypocrite. F-em!
I bet they won’t cover the brandon goodwin story he got the shot and it ended up hurting him 🤔
Why are people bashing him for using his platform for a better cause rather being a yes man, I don't get it
I respect Kyrie decision. Let a team in a red state trade for him.
Trade Kyrie for Dame $
hates hate.... his body his choice
These mf 🤡🤡🤡
Shannon hit something important on the head. The people gassing Kyrie up are the same idiots that no matter what as long as it seems like someone is going against the system they will cheer. Then when that person falls or fumbles the bag immensely all of a sudden they laugh or maybe when their friend they gassed up gets fired they won't even offer him a bed. Those are the losers Kyrie is appealing to.
Wtf lmao
Why take a vaccine that no one knows the long term effects 👀
I never understood when I was younger they said basketball is mostly politics. I understand now it's all politics if u wanna play ball 🏀 then u have to play ball or they're gonna sick the media on u and shape the publics opinion of u
Come to Texas Kyrie. All emotions , no facts.
Damn Kyrie been the topic all week🤣🤣
Shannon get on my damn nerves. Looking like a strong fish with glasses
This whole drama is not about vaccine mandate or money, Kyrie is ALL  ABOUT SPOT LIGHT, and he got a lot of it now, that's all he cares about.  Remember he left a CAVS team that was in the NBA final 3-time in row,  his reason was, he WANTS all the TEAM SPOT Light to be on him, and can't  do that in a team with LeBron. Even winning is nothing to him, He just  want all the attention, he took 2-weeks off last season unannounced just  to get media attention, whatever gets him the attention, and he's the  number one news in the NBA for the last 2 weeks, that's mission  accomplished for him.
Kyrie is right not to take a shot that’s still in its government/NIH funded clinical trials that aren’t complete until 2023. The shot which has recorded more than 16,000 deaths that have been directly reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), ran by the FDA & CDA. Which is an accumulation of more deaths in 10 months of the shot being available to the public than has been recorded altogether in the previous 40 years since the organisations inception.
Shannon you being a UT
Kyrie failed to even lead Boston that one year. The team played better without him.
The thing shannon said was “it’s kyrie” 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ what does that even mean it’s his life bruh they only coming at his neck so they can have something to talk about for the season far as Brooklyn
If he took the jab tomorrow and stayed…would there not be another Kyrie thing further down the line?
Honestly I love the idea that Nets is going to trade Kyrie for Westbrook in midseason. Drama would intensify to the next level.
Hey Kyrie.....Green pill 💊 or Red pill 💊
On 🏀/Covid Kyrie unofficially tabloid press. Bad sports journalism. Interview CP3. CP3 got it and was vaxed, unlike Kyrie, got to the finals.
Kyrie would make a  good character on The Matrix series.
I could never see myself losing millions due to my ego and pride. He thinks he’s smarter than he is. He’s going to be the martyr of ignorance and stupidity
They had the exact same conversation yesterday. Lol. Bro let Kyrie live his life as he so chooses. Denver signed MPJ to a max contract this summer and he's unvaccinated. They have made this all about Kyrie, because the terrible city of New York has a silly mandate that doesn't even apply to the NYPD.
Have you seen dave , have you seen john , naw I haven't,  well maybe they  will show up sooner or later....shannon spot on with what he said about the REAL world....
"We got a chance to do something special" winning a championship isn't special when they do it every year they get a banner a trophy and a ring it's so special u should give your life for it. So stupid how they act like sports really matter.
Uhmm y’all not from area…NYC is not close to Philly lol. It’s at least 2 hours, and parts of Brooklyn it can take you 3 lol. But I get the point .
I just don't understand how you can continue to hold that position when the vast majority of your peers in the NBA and millions upon millions have taken the vaccine already. People aren't dropping dead or turning into zombies. It's clearly safe and not dangerous. Even Andrew Wiggins took the freakin' shot.  Take the shot Kyrie it's not that big of a deal. We are all going to die regardless.
Shannon mentioned all those older players that were all about championships which one played through a pandemic 😷 🤔?
Kyrie should not be expected to be vax until a major network gives CP3 a full hour interview. Kyrie didn't get to the finals. Kyrie didn't get vaxed and then get Covid. What does Kyrie have to do wid 🏀/Covid?
WOW! Skip finally admits that the 2015 cavs would have beaten the warriors in the finals if Kyrie did not get injured.😱😱 Crazy to see what Skip actually thinks when Lebron is not directly involved in the topic
50/40/90 Kyrie Irving is the man
why just bball mandated
Kyrie don't want to play for Brooklyn since he knows James Harden will out shine him so he is hiding on the vaccine thing 😂😂😂
We need to Ban skip and shannon..and get new host...
I hate this narrative. It is not for anyone to define a man’s priorities. Has it occurred to anyone that being mandated to put something in your body is an obligation not worthwhile a game you love or the financial reward? Leave the man be guys..he is a great talent and a gift to this game we so cherish. And he has the right to stand for his convictions . Many will too if they could afford to!
Kyrie will do a George Costanza on opening night
Conspiracy theories are becoming realities dually noted.
Boston was not much better without Kyrie lmao   Look at Boston since Kyrie been gone.   And CLE had a better record every year Kyrie was in the league before LeBron, he was just getting hurt.   Lastly, Brooklyn pre-KD was good, Kyrie…just got hurt again. Y’all tripping
Kyrie wants to be Colin Kap without the intelligence or the cause. Hey Kyrie, stop the Cap! 😂😂😂
Ya'll  are just craying, because kyrie won't play. keep crying tho 🤣🤣🤣🤣
man how is this so important the man made his choice for himself nobody else and yall mad? it aint taking no money out yall pockets what everybody trippin for
They let Magic play with full blown AIDS but scrutinizing Kyrie for not taking a flu shot??  😒😒😒
It perfect. A perfect situation, two players comparable contracts, one a covid19 the other a holdout. Behind the scenes and agent is working, talking to owners and the player. Deal is made. Kyrie Irving for  Ben Simmons! That's my guess
There is something about having the kind of talent Kyrie does for those around him. You try to micromanage it, a sign of workplace bullying; it is part of why Kyrie wanted to escape from LeBomb.  Kyrie knows the more people try to harness his talent, to get him to heel, the easier it will be to compete with him. He's dealt with this ever since his poor start in Cleveland that probably had something to do with the same dynamic; trying to back off the micromanagers. He doesn't try hard to be so good, surrounded by people who did, do, and always will. Some people mistake Kyrie's affability and non-competitive nature as a lack of leadership qualities, an indifference to basketball, but that is what makes him more clutch than the King. Basketball means more to Kyrie than being better than anyone else; that is when you know somebody loves something, when it is not a way of proving you are better than anyone else. It just so happens that Kyrie is better at it than just about everybody. His uneffacing skills conflict with the amount of effort it takes for him to be so good.  Kyrie thinks there are more important things than basketball probably because he had a good upbringing, knows what matters, and realize basketball win or lose proves nothing.  Before Covid Kyrie dealt with workplace bullying, and here it is a hot button issue that gives even his teammates the opportunity to put him in his place and take him down a notch. Hopefully they don't break him
God this is a trashed debate, they are basically saying that basketball is more important than real life decisions JESUS
Kyrie one of my fav players but damn he irritating me like he can be a voice but you messing up a special thing
Kyrie should just retire until Covid is over and then comeback.
It's not about basketball dumb dumbs! It's his LIFE and HEALTH!!! Damn yall GOOFY smfh
Really do feel like people are attacking Kyrie. I’m not the biggest Kyrie fan but he’s a GROWN man & whatever decision he makes for the well being of him & his family should be RESPECTED.
its not a vaccine its a seasonal shot
Ban kyrie from the NBA already fr 😂
I don't think anyone should be forced to do something they do not want to do

He's.....Weird ..off talented but something is way off on the brotha no disrespect the NBA needs to drop him ..facts just end his career because he is a misfit.  Facts
Wiggins said Own Body??? under contract!!! Irving said Own Body!!!Own Choice!!! Kyrie and other Athletes become Owners with those million dollar contracts that Own players of major Leagues of ...
🙄 Here goes Shannon. I guess it’s his turn. Don’t start this bs 🤫
Y'all create a whole different Narrative from what he said ...the man said he made a choice for himself/ his3 body for what he thinks is right WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING HE WANTS TO BE THE VOICE OF PEOPLE ?  That's not journalism That's Gossip show
LAMESTREAM MEDIA 📺 WILL ASSASSINATE UR CHARACTER IF U DON'T FALL IN LINE LIKE MOST 🐑 DO ..
Unfortunately kyrie a real man and in this day and age where genders are crossed its hard to see that. Some things are bigger than a team, bigger than fiat money.
Leave that man alone puppets
Can they stop distracting us from the fact that their FORCING players to take a vaccine? No one else finds this unconstitutional ? Kyrie is the problem in this situation and not the rule itself? If a player gets the vaccine and gets covid their still spreading the virus regardless. The vaccine doesn’t stop u from getting covid or passing it on? So how’s kyrie the problem for not wanting to be FORCED to take it? People are such brainwashed sheeps now it’s insane letting the media play on kyries past stunts to justify the hate for this latest event.. when no kyrie is right on this one. Lebron also said he’s not for forcing ppl to take the vax either. But keep trying to make an example out of kyrie cause everyone already knows him as the “crazy one” . I literally feel like Neo in the matrix. Y’all bots are so easily manipulated it’s insane
That Boston team Was dope I must admit they definitely had the squad their to win a couple of chips
And the oscars goes to Kyrie Irving winning best Actor of the year
First of all everybody got rights and if he is sacrificing his personal life for others that should be appreciated. The mandate is bs u can still get the virus still spread the virus and die from it not to mention this posed to be a free country now the government can decide what I'm inserting in my veins and threaten my employment and now he the crazy one smh
What would be crazy kyrie gets Traded to the Lakers and Westbrook goes to the nets. I got a feeling it’s gonna happen kyrie and lebron back together
He is literally religiously exempt .  And if they fire trade or hinder him in anyway over this he will be paid alot of money for it.   Plus ....if everyone else is vaccinated and the vaccines work.... Why bother the one that doesn't want it?    Ahhhhhhh
Way to be a man and stand on principle Kyrie 🤞🏾💙 the people love what you doing the media don’t speak for we💯
The Nets really has the chance to win 70 + and the chip if KI is available to play the whole year. That is what is on the line.
bucks in 6!
I’m unsubscribed. Thanks Kyrie. A lot of people lost their job and a lot of people lost loved ones due to the vaccine with noone  to hold accountable to vaccine injury
KI Punk
The Illuminati does exist…. What’s the original price of the first Apple computer! What’s pops up in your mind when you think of the forbidden fruit 🍎 Them spirits are a real thing
Everywhere he goes, he destroy the team. He's not a LEADER...
Kyrie don't you ever quote Kobe mamba mentality again you Looney. You're disrespecting Kobe whenever you decide to skip games. Shame on you.
This aint a basketball discussion with the nets, this is not bending to force. Its not about safety if visiting teams can play its now about singling out who doesn't take the mark of the beast. No doctor can tell you what this will to to your body in 15 years.
Bye-Rie Irving 👋🏾
I hope Kyrie realizes the only reason he has a platform is because he's good at basketball. And if he doesn't play basketball, his platform disappears; along with the potency of whatever his message is supposed to be. I love political activism in sports, but come on... It's just marketing for causes. If these guys were just regular dudes who couldn't play basketball, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be out there doing the Che Guevara thing. I could be wrong, but I doubt it.

Why are you guys just speaking bad about another human being when he has done nothing to you
Undisputed was one of my favorite sports shows but I just can’t watch them right now their taking our freedom away and right now this show and a few others is playing a part in it all and I will not support it
Good for kyrie put the power in the talent not the owners.
Salute to Kyrie, if he doesn't want to get that jab, so be it. Only fools allow themselves to be guinea pigs, especially when the elixir isn't proven and concocted in lighting speed.
Man kyrie was talking. About nothing on his live 🤦🏾
man y’all talk about this team like they don’t have all the best nba players on it chill let kyrie do him stop w the hate i really hope bro just retire so we don’t have to listen to you clowns talk about another man decision trying to make him feel guilty about some that y’all want
Why is everyone so stuck up on Kyrie, if he doesn't want to get vaccinated so be it. It's his life and he made his choice just like the Nets made there choice in regards to Kyrie. The NBA doesn't stop and start with Kyrie, there are plenty of other great stars to watch in the NBA
Why cant the NBA  just test Kyrie for Covid  everyday?
Kyrie should play for the Looney Toons.
Kyrie to Pheonix.
I support kyrie
Been getting vaccinated since birth now it’s a problem stop it America
How is everyone enjoying the new flourishing medical tyranny?
Kyrie will stay with the Nets. It would be a bad deal to trade for Kyrie.  He just misses to many games.
When are y’all going to understand that he’s not budging at this point?
I wouldn't  be surprised  if they Isaiah  Thomas kyrie.  I think he's  gonna regret  this.
If it’s not about the money and he has his beliefs why doesn’t he retire? It’s better off that way, and less of a distraction right?
Why people acting like Kyrie owes them something??? He’s his own man let him live. He’s mother was half Native American and they were almost exterminated. Please let him be him. If he can do it with his job title let him live
How many times are we gonna rehash the same story when these 2 are saying the EXACT same thing.
I support you Kyrie.  The league is better without you.
Shannon you are very disappointed to man I thought she was better than that but you just like everybody else  I stand with Kyrie
KY would be great on inside the NBA tnt.
Kyrie ain't going nowhere.  He'll get vaccinated.  He's trolling all y'all.
Free kyrie he standing up for all of us and our freedom!!! Y’all gonna lose real fans keep it up!!!
Y’all better be damn sure them vaccines legit the way y’all endorsing them.
if ky gets traded, nets not winning a chip imo, I just can't get over hardens past up short in crunch time and idk about them lakes 🤣
Kyrie deserve an NFL player contract from now if any of these teams are smart
Kyrie for zion😁
I support Irving's decision to not get poison in your body. No one can prevent anyone death especially with putting poison in your body. These blinded sports teams and govt officials can't think logically. They think to control people. First, it was "our body our choice" when it comes to women and killing innocent babies but now they force a jab to save a life? You hypocrites!! People need to stop playing God or Jesus by deciding who lives and who dies. Only Jesus gets that choice.
Just vaccs him during the sleep
I say we get Fox for Irving
I hope Kyrie laughing at y’all
Eventually all states will mandate the vaccine other than Texas and Florida. So his only options would be those states if he chooses a trade.   Texas already stated a ban on mandates for any organization. Florida already sued a county for mandating the vaccine. These two states won’t mandate anytime soon and will probably have an executive order pushed by the federal government in order to follow the mandate.   Kyrie’s best option is to retire. He is proving nothing but loss. Retirement would have more of a meaning than causing a distraction to the organization. At the end of the day, this is government and business. Both will move on without anyone and will not look back.
how is ben simmons a good fit with the nets? someone explain to me
basically they are forcing him to take the shot. It's unbelievable. And ask for the passport (social credit system) in the soon future is mind boggling.
What's makes this confusing he doesn't mind taking the vaccine he's doin this for the ones who don't kyrie you can't save the world let them deal with their own issues I commend his intentions to do well but he's goin about it the wrong way
🦝
This whole world is flipped. What's right is wrong and what's wrong is right .
F*ck a team when it comes to your personal choice. Bunch a 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Your confused because you never did anything without someone giving you directions....
Obviously this is click bait.. this dude will eventually play ball...
THIS IS SAD TO WATCH..STOP ATTACKING THE MAN AND MOVE ON..UNC YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS..CHILL 4Real YOUR PEOPLE ARE WATCHING 🎃
Love uncle shay shay and skip, this is why I don’t watch first take anymore
Pre-woke Kyrie could’ve been an MVP by now
Money ain't everything and a championship don't over rule ones human choice! Unbelievable America will fall from within and we will actively participate in our own demise but putting entertainment over humanity! We live in a matrix an assimilation of reality, the only thing that's real is our ability to connect human to human spirit to spirit!
I miss Cleveland Kyrie
What are they talking about 🤷🏾‍♂️
Alot of greats only played 10 years 🎃
He can play for Newsmax or OAN 🤷‍♂️
Kyrie is not getting traded this is ridiculous
What if the vaccinated start to die?
Why can’t you just accept his beliefs and leave him alone ? What’s wrong with the world
Media need to stop give him attention
Made up he’s not getting his contact extended.. can’t reward his type of behaviour. Vaccine or before vaccine.
It’s deeper than basketball skip and Shannon
Kyrie will be vaxxed by next week
Nobody is talking about maybe Kyrie  doesn't care enough. He's rich, got a ring already. I feel like he could walk away from the NBA and be ok with it.
If you get triggered by a person making a choice that hurts no one, you may be a sheep. Wolves love 🐑.
2 weeks on the same subject I just notice even sports media stick with drama like other media sources smh damn shame this how ya get ya views Nd money 🤦🏾‍♂️😭
Kyrie is giving you lames life right now... All you mfs talk about is Lebron and Tom Brady anyway. Milk it for all the views you can punks
Sheesh, nets are just lucky they have harden and kd haha
Shannon is spineless. He never stood for what he believed in and lost something. The moment he’s going to lose something, he’ll change his tune.
Imagine your someone tryna get on an NBA roster and then you see a player who is a starter on arguably a top three team in the league opting not to play
🦝  chip activated
I think him not getting vac'd is his own choice and the fact that they ate trying too make him do it is stupid asf especially when they get tested everytine they play or come into the building not to mention the vac'd ones are the main ones spreading the shyt
Best show on TV
Well we know now100% it wasn’t lebron fault now!!!!!! Facts!!!
The fact that sixers is willing to stick with simmons despite him not wanting to play for sixers over kyrie, explains the of the difficulty of the kyrie situation
Bruh why is this still being brought up? KD don’t want him traded and Kyrie already said he would retire if he was traded. The nets would be the ones having to give up extra picks or something for safety in case Kyrie do retire. Does the media think they bout to trade Kyrie for  another superstar straight up? Or only have to trade Kyrie for a good player and some picks? No they’re not because if Kyrie retires then the team trading for him gets robbed.
There was only 1 man in the history of the NBA that could take time off when ever he wanted. That man was Dennis Rodman. Rodman could take time off because when he showed up you knew he was giving you everything he had.  You don't know what version of Kyrie you're getting. He could show up and give you 100% or just 40%.
Ok Shannon A. SMITH
Shannon breaks my heart sometime he’s so loyal to the government and the system he has to remember Tuskegee experiment the watergate scandal Jim Crow laws countless times officers beat charges 9/11 as a whole .... even if u white or black there’s reasons (besides a regular vaccine being produced at least 5+ years and this one was less than 2) for us not to trust and it’s our right of choice
I love Unc and Skip respectfully. I usually agree with all of their assessments and especially Shannon’s metaphors and how he expresses life lessons through things he learned fr his grandparents etc. but I think with them being from an older generation they don’t fully get why Kyrie is taking this stand
kyrie for ben
"It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society." what is the
OmG skip just agreed if that kyrie wouldn't of got hurt that first year lebron would of won the ring that year lol😂
This the same Kyrie who said the earth is flat
The game called life is more important than 🤺a job that goes against the most high 🧘🏾
Kyrie to the mavs 🤣
….because basketball is more important than my health …a game is more important than my health…a championship is more important than my health.
can people even comprehend anymore ? Were all adults here. He has an obligation to the company that he works for. He can do whatever he wants to do in his own time not company time. He can retire now and do all the stuff that he wants. Im sure hes a good guy but if you hire me for 10 days to fix your house and I signed the contract but decided i only going to work 4 days cause the other 6 days im going to volunteer my time to a shelter. You know for a fact, your going to take me to court fir breach of contract.
So all the sudden it’s a crime for a black man to think for himself and not follow the crowd 🤔
Instead of talking about basketball they spend the whole show talking about being vaccinated
I'd trade Kyrie for someone like JJ barea anytime at this point
What confusing me is why the vax is that important, just let him wear a mask when he is on the court is that simple.
Kyrie should get vaccinated and still not play lol. But what if he's vaccinated already
In response to the Net's not allowing him to play away games. Kyrie should threatened to retire if the Nets try to trade him this season.
Kyrie should join Ice Cube League. Or start his own. 💪
he should simply retire if he has no interest in sacrificing for the collective. tired of hearing about this guy daily ffs
I salute Kyrie Irving I stand with Kyrie Irving. Birmingham alabama checking in
I'm a huge kyrie fan and I respect 💯 what he is trying to accomplish...However, most people that are watching this aren't understanding the real issue here. This guy wants to keep his job and get paid but doesn't want to take the vaccine for the very same job that he does. He wants to stand up for the people that lost their jobs because of not getting the vaccine. If your going to go all out then quit your job! That's all the media is trying to understand. It is a selfish act because he still playing this holding back his own team with championship goals this year. All you unvaccinated people really need to calm tf down and see what's really the issue here..smh 😑 Remember, this the same dude that claims the earth to be flat lol
It’s not about the vaccine you old goofies
He should retire, and become full fledge political activist. He already has generational wealth
They can say what they want,  but Lebron obviously needed kyrie to win that championship
These guys “I don’t have a problem with him making decisions for himself!!”  ******proceeds to have a 25 minute segment having a problem with a choice that has nothing to do with them that he has made. And speaking in hypotheticals and slandering him.
SAS is licking is taking a lot of notes🤔
Kyrie who's been very injury prone trusted doctors throughout his career.   But now, all of a sudden, he doesn't trust them because of the vaxx 🤣
What franchise would want a player known mostly for his unreliability???!!!
Kyrie is the 2021 iverson we talking about  practice
Hate the haters! Kyrie ♥✊🏽
Kyrie probably wouldnt play regardless lol this is just an excuse for him not to play....look at last year....part timer his whole career
Bro fk yall. Im standin with Ky. His body his choice. Get off hiss dicc
its easy to tell who is dumb, because they open their pie holes.   since kyrie signed, he didn't change, the nets unilaterally agreed with a 3rd party to ban him.  that's on the nets and these 2 clowns seems more mad about it than kyrie himself.
How did he back himself into a corner when the state and organization  are giving him an ultimatum 🤔🤦🏾‍♂️
Lakers finna trade Westbrook for Irving… JUST WATCH. COVID restrictions aren’t as crazy in LA. Send that problem ova here!
If he guarantees he’ll retire if he’s traded, trade John Wall for Kyrie Irving. At least Wall would play for a good team, being the 3rd option and the Rockets wouldn’t even want Kyrie near the team
Lets go Brandon!
come on Kyrie, just retire.  get over it.
He said he was promised he will not have to take it so its clear he talk to somebody
These guys are confused because they stand for absolutely nothing 🤦🏾‍♂️
Will the nets play the knickerbockers? Clippers? And other teams that have the mandate?.. that would bring his total game count to 26 games... imagine the nets get the Knicks in the first round??😆😆😝
Brittle Mentally and physically ! shame great talent ,
I wonder if y’all would treat LEBRON like this if he took this stance 🤦🏾‍♂️💯
200 million and play basketball just to get vaccinated? Where is the nearest clinic and that contract I’m signing up right now!
I guess they don’t know cities are rioted to not take the vaccine.
KD is a loner not the same as a leader. Harden cracks under too much pressure. Kyrie is always hurt and only mentally availiable sometimes. Never focused on basketball.   NETS are being exposed for being the all cracked team.
Not wanting to take a forced medical treatment is now considered acting unpredictable. The gaslighting has turned into trolling because y'all are 🤡
Pure bloods 💪
Michael Jordan recently said he believes in the science. MJ rarely talks about outside issues. He got blasted for not being political while LeBum gets bashed for being that. So it's damn if you, damn if you don't.
Cookie?  Did yall listen to his ig live?  He was very thoughtful and articulate. Understanding and compassionate.   Yall clearly have a script ur following.   Absolutely shameful
why dont you 2 tools actually discuss what kyrie said? afraid to say it? kyrie is right, and i respect him for it. vaxxs are a choice, and should never ever be a mandate. it goes against all science, and is just control.
This was a trashing Kyrie segment 😳
No vaccine mandate in Texas. Would be able to practice and play at home and some road games with the Mavs.
I’m glad Bron have AD now
Kyrie is a thinker growing up in the public eye.  On his ig live, he sounded more reasonable and responsible than these old heads.  This is a shame.....
It’s nothing wrong with his stance it’s his body wtf are you ppl dumb
Kyrie selfish, just retire
I stand with Kyrie... Go Bulls😂!!!
Kyrie has done some dumb things but Kyrie  is Absolutely right in this case. If you have taken the vaccination or not you can still get COVID and still spread COVID. I mean what are we talking about. How can your government tell you what to inject in your body. It’s make zero common sense where the players are playing on the court without mask then sit on the bench with a mask and sit 6 feet apart. I guess when your playing on the court you can not spread COVID. Wake up this is all about control. Y’all been listening to sleepy joe to much.
Not to mention he stay hurt 😂😂.. from college days to the nba
Not everyone sells this soul for money and fame Shannon men ever wasn't titled to their own opinion the problem with you people on the left is that you want people to do what you want do what you want but yet you claim to be inclusive and understanding what they do what you say but when they go against the system you want to cancel them.
oh yes we dont want a human just a mindless robot with endless production
1.9K Dummies
U shouldn't be forced to do something u don't wanna do
The narrative that they're painting is wrong. He is the new Kwame Brown.
This is the first time in my life I’ve actually heard Kyrie say something that I can fully agree with. The man is truly taking a stand for simple human rights and they just sit here laughing at him. Smh.
Kyrie is siding with police unions and the very people that once told him and every athlete to shut up and play ball. The ones that didn't  care about his beliefs and the reasons he and everyone wanted to protest for racial equality. He's too stupid to see that.
I'm proud of you kyrie don't endorse that mRNA technology Injection, don't be a sellout like the rest proud of you 👏 ❤let's go Brandon!!!
A man or a woman should stand by their principles and never give in to the mob stand your ground.God made us free in  Spirit and mind and body.  Whatever happened to my body my choice
I want Devin Booker !
I’m a Lebron fan, I’m a Kyrie fan. Shannon does all this talking about Kyrie but I know I’d take Kyrie on the lakers right now
Cowboys, Brady, Nets, Cowboys, Brady, Nets, Cowboys, Brady, Nets, LeBron, Cowboys, Brady, Nets, Cowboys, Brady, Nets, Cowboys, Brady, Nets, Lebron
Yeah getting the vaccine is a *personal* choice but then the consequences of not getting it are a *personal* problem
👍🏽🙏🏼💪🏻 stand strong
Dude is just an athetic Kanye
Kyrie had a choice as an American But that’s a private business so it is what it is
I love how Skip and Shannon's basketball take both criticize Kyrie regarding his decision and people love it while on the other network, SAS does the same thing but gets excoriated because he basically booted Max off First Take.
I'm *JUST* now seeing how Undisputed "sports" take is more so political statement than opinion regarding *sports*. Are you allowed to have a conservative opinion?...better yet. Don't talk about it at all
Hold up stop the presses,!  Skip just admitted that the 2015 Cavs would have won with Kyrie lmao.
It's a ploy to trade Westbrook to bk and kyrie back with LeBron 🤣🤣🤣
Why the hack do they think that team is more important then his health like I’m getting done with all these people because once I get a voice I want to challenge all these people about they character
Forget these cowards and their mandates shout out to Abbott
Kyrie, as a fan and unvaccinated person, please take the vaccine and play for your team. You don’t have to be the peoples voice and sacrifice your career for that. We understand :).
Uncle Shay need to stop all that damn yelling s***
Biggest diva in the league
Drama queen leave him alone nobody gives af
It’s crazy to me that a black man can go on national television and talk down on another black man fighting for what he believes in. Really sad man
Stop hating
Almost thought Skip was about to say "when they needed him most, he vanished" 😂
I stand with kyrie 🩸
lol Kyrie is jus on an ego trip at this point. he is all over the place. its just his pride
What's my all-time favorite song? Probably U2's "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". It's covered in the Sing 2 trailer. That should be Kyrie's theme song. Always searching. A wanderer. He doesn't have an endgame.
It can work like that, if it works like that. It’s all about leverage. If he gets it, he get it. NBA does have to worry about setting a precedent that they won’t want to maintain. He set up the Brooklyn situation on another note. KD wouldn’t be there without him so they owe him regardless.
Shannon the oversear
The nets are definetely gon tradr him now..... Wf ben simmons fo sure , my problem for your problem.
The sixers trade makes NO sense so what are sixers gonna do when they run into the nets in the playoffs and Kyrie can’t play
They keep saying Kyrie is a big thinker then spend the rest of the segment showing me evidence that he isn't 🤣
That guy defects from the norm every chance he gets.
GO TO LAKERS.....REUNITED WITH LEBRON..
The Kyrie Irving effect 😄
Respect for Kyrie, but to what end? Against the vaccine? Why?
Kyrie isnt doing anything wrong. He knows the consequences for not playing.  Hes making a decision and moving forward.  Next story.
We all respect Kyrie's generosity. We are aware how charitable he is. His heart is always in the right place but not his mind. Not his emotions. That's his problem. Has the heart of gold. But sometimes it feels he's on some acid trip.
If everybody vaccinated except him why does it matter bro only putting himself in danger so if y’all mad it’s cuz y’all don’t believe in the vaccine y’all put in y’all body ..vaccine I thought where made for the people who can’t beat the disease some of our immune been surviving through all the bs Ebola, flu, mad cow disease all that bs I don’t get sicc I refuse to put the siccness in me if I can’t beat it without y’all like I been doing
Mr. Toxic 😂
Coming from a Celtics fan who never liked Kyrie, I hope he sticks to his guns and doesnt cave here. No where in his contract does it say he has to get vaccinated to get paid. I would sue the Nets and the League all the way to the Supreme Court if I were in his shoes...and he would win. Plus he can afford to since hes wealthy enough to never need to play again. Forcing other people to get vaccinated against their will or basically lose all human rights of earning a living is insanity. They are trying to see how far they can push the limits and you will still accept it.
6ers could try to trade for him
Kyrie for Simmons is a HORRIBLE TRADE for the Sixers…they already have another star that’s always injured…they can’t have another
No contending team can trade for him. They have to think about the possibility of playing the nets or the Knicks in the playoffs and dont have him available to play.
He need to Retire we are done with the dramatics!!!!!!
I'm saying back to back.. Bucks in 6!!
Let the man play, without the dumb vaccine
Kyrie's name has been trending all week long. More interesting than the NBA preseason and WNBA Finals. 🍿 Get your popcorn and listen to the jibberish he has to say about nothing. Just a mouse running around a maze in his head.
Kyrie is stuck in suspended adolescence. Because of his talent he never had to mature so he still acts like a teenager. He posits theories that are real "to him". Like a teenager he has thoughts and ideas that are real.."to him". The NBA gives him a platform and this is news. But when he speaks most rational mature adults are left more confused. Therapy would help.
How is kyrie going at this vaccine alone ?? I know tons of people who feel the way he does..Skip so casually says that as if it's a fact n Noone bats an eye..smh unbelievable
Kyrie is a great talent and I respect his conviction to his beliefs.
This dude is screwing with the privilege of playing in the nba.
If he gets the jab I guess all the "can I count on him" goes out the window
I mean he aint wrong its his decision
Kyrie  retire bro you don't need this and yo kids don't need to hear they talking bout there dad everyday. Retired bro they trying too black list you and make you a terrible person and it hurt me to hear and I don't even know you but I feel you so just walk away from this game so these people can gone and talk about the next person
It doesn’t make sense to trade him because nobody else wants him on their team
Kyrie trippin got kd n harden and millions...
The whole world is following this closely if Stephen A. Smith posted a reaction for Kyrie's IG Live fairly quickly after he posted it. Same with Skip's tweet. Usually both can take hours to talk about something.
As a black man who has native heritage, I understand where Kyrie is coming from mentally. I don’t want to get flagged by YT but look back at history. In fact, look how gene and vaccinations were created and look how they medical industry did them people to gain that technology!!! SMH most people will look at my comment and call me crazy but it’s some   Enlightened individuals that knows what I’m saying
I stand with Kyrie. He doesn’t want to take the vaccine. He’s aware of the consequences and chose to fall back.
Nets go on and trade him if you can because at this point he is daring them now to do something they just going to have to say f**k it and get rid of him
They talking more about Kyrie than LeBron/Jordan and the Cowboys/Tom Brady. Look at Kyrie out here changing the world
That's  the league's  fault u should know who u signing what's  the real issue? when black folks make their own decisions  its a problem.... tellprivate sector  the league to stand up to government the people say no to mandates u right Shannon he should start his own businese  u know what I say start your own league..media and government wants to control people's life  We say no it's  my life my right this not a Democracy this fascist country  u do what I say or else
Imagine kyrie for dame mid season trade👀
man i had respect for these guys in the past but now they are just a couple of bought clowns.. will never watch this show again
Kyrie did sort of back down from the flat earth thing after he was called out, I think there’s still hope he’ll back down from this too.
Hate to break it to you but titles and championships aren't "forever" Shannon Sharpe. Those trophies are very much perishable and in due time all of the accolades will be forgotten. There is a massive world outside of professional sports. Try visiting that world once in a while!
Trade Westbrook for Kyrie 👀
Why would a contender who will eventually have to play Brooklyn in the playoffs trade for him when he won’t be available for that series
Watch NY change their mandate by November/ December lol
If they let him play then he would say he can't play because of covid 🤦🏼‍♂️
Since kyrie wants to be the voice for the voiceless he should give all the money he'll make to charity since he doesn't care about losing money
Kyrie's IG Live explained his position so clear......yeah it was clear as mud!🤣 👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾 "Don't believe that I'm retiring," Irving said. "Don't believe that I'm going to give up this game for a vaccine mandate or staying unvaccinated. Don't believe any of that s***, man." Huh?????🧐 Kyrie being Kyrie.....again!🙄🙄
What team will give this guy a Max contract when he hits free agency???  If they do they’re idiots…this man burned bridges in Cleveland, Boston and now Brooklyn…WTF
Deserted Cleveland. Deserted Boston. Deserting his Brooklyn teammates because he respects his body. Melo didn't even play for an entire year and he had no unpredictable antics like Kyrie has done for the last 4+ years.
Go back to the Cavs where you were appreciated Kyrie… the grass isn’t always greener in the big cities
Kyrie for dame.. haha
Idk if Ky gone retire or take it & come back but I salute to him for standing up
They have a great chance to win without Kyrie but they are damn near unstoppable with Kyrie. That’s why this is such a big deal.
Thank you Kyrie for dismantling the Nets SUPER DUPER TEAM. Leveling the playing field for the NBA lol
Puppets Shannon i cant believe u. Jalen rose is necessary for tv not you other sale outs
15:31 He's also a Drama Queen......🧐
Nah he more likely to be dropped by the nba than to play in the nba.
for 33m/season i will go 3 jabs .
Team  kyrie💪🏾💪🏾
As Broussard pointed out on The Odd Couple, Kyrie may opt in next summer on whatever team he is on because no team will offer him over $35M next summer. Kyrie has worn out his welcome in the league.
He's coming to the Raptors. The cold freezes the virus here.
The producers of this show turned Shannon Sharpe into a vaccine mandate enforcer, Shannon , tell your Zionist producers to stop advocating for big pharma, Kyrie has the right to refuse the vaccine, you and Skip don't have the right to force him.
Kyrie Irving is his own problem he won't admit it but that's the way this young generation is.. they trip themselves up and blame everybody else
He just dont want to take it. If that means he can't play thats okay to him because he no comfortable putting this vaccine in his body. This is way bigger then basketball. They say they not forcing people to put that stuff in their bodies if thats the case just let him go and live with his choice. They are trying to force people and thats why this is a big deal. I stand wit kyrie on this one 💯
The Muhammad Ali of our generation
Kyrie needs therapy.
Kyrie stay strong against the hive minded demons of this 🌎
What do Lebron and KD have in common? Kyrie drama
Kyrie is on another level (in a good way)
Do Kyrie a favor people, Stop pumping this dude head up like he’s some hero or something. You’re not doing him no favors
Kyrie been a diva since the lebron chip
Kyrie is a real man! a real man who sticks to his principles! You two are not men you two are corporate sellouts! Grow a pair of balls and be a man let Kyrie show you how it's done!!!
BLM says the vaccine mandate is racist. Resist the oppressors.
This is better for the nets if he gets traded.
OKC getting Kyrie is really just a salary dump on Shai and Kyrie next year since they own a ton of draft picks including from my Flippers. Sam Presti does this a lot. OKC can't attract stars any way. They can only build from the draft.
Why would any team want them problems he’s not worth it.
I don't get this narrative that Skip is always spitting about Kyrie being smart and a thinker... blah blah blah. Thinker? I can imagine many things but nobody is listening if you're not famous. There are a lot of thinkers and the smart ones don't believe in conspiracy theories. He clearly thinks that he's smarter than he actually is, and that will cost him millions.
I have no problem with Anti-vaxers, I have an issue with *Kyrie* smh Every single year it's something different. Cleveland, Boston, and now Brooklyn. This dude is toxic AF, and I'm really getting tired of his antics
Kyrie is the Republican's Kaepernick lmao.
Free Will is hard to come by these days
Just remembered Shannon nor Skip Is Kyrie's Psychologist.  It's all speculation for your entertainment.
Trade him to the Lakers for Westbrook 😁
This is a bit sad in my opinion. I love watching Kyrie, he's really talented, but he's an unpredictable dude. He seems like a good guy but he's unpredictable. You just don't know what he's thinking about.  Man can come up with conspiracy theories that make you sit back and be like WHAT!! 🤣😅  But like Shannon said, talent trumps all. Teams will look at him, and be like, we don't like your character, but damn, you're talented so we're gonna take you.
Very disappointed in this segment. It comes across like they didn’t even watch Kyrie’s IG live and instead just chose to rehash a bad narrative around his name that he even addresses and apologizes for on the IG live. Ya can do better
My real problem with Kyrie is that he's doing the things regular people want to do, but can't, because they don't have millions in the bank. The amount of people that would quit their jobs instead of taking the vaccine is probably staggering, but obviously not everyone can go without guaranteed income. There is no way Kyrie would be doing this if he had $78 bucks in the bank, and needed to feed his family.
I would love to see Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in a much better situation. Not be stuck on a bad team for the last two years. Felt like those years were wasted. Nets gets to dump Kyrie for a budding star.
The irony in all of this is that the player in question has one of the best "handles" in the game but is not handling his business very well.
Man are we still talking about the same thing man give it a rest man Kyrie Irving got the right to choose what he want to do with his body.. stop trying
Russ can get to the playoffs in the west
Voice for the voiceless? Where Kyrie been. They are already the loudest voice in the room 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😭😭😂😂
What don’t they get? Kyrie does not want to get vaccinated. He has a Ring, He has millions. Millions haven’t been vaccinated but these two act oblivious.
So first it was about the vaccine and the media was calling kyrie selfish for not taking it. Now that he don’t want to take it all of a sudden I’m hearing he’s injury prone and a bad teammate etc. I see exactly what’s going on here. It sound to me like get down or lay down.
Kyrie always talking about how he’s on a “Platform”. More like you on a high chair bc you act like a spoiled rotten baby
Harden can move back to SG if Nets get Shai. Then say Kyrie opts out, OKC won't care. They have a ton of draft picks and are free from the big SGA contract as well. As much as I love SGA, he's not worth his current salary.
Kyrie is right with what he believes in. It's his body and it's funny the NBA was still going on during the height of covid season... Nothing was mandated and here are players playing side by side with one another.. Don't make people do things that are  uncomfortable to them  especially when it involves money. He's not a problem and he's just living by his morals that some now a days don't have anymore. Take the shot and move on.. There hasn't been long term studies on these shots at all...to the point thousands of medical personals quit their jobs in that same said state because of it  I'm not anti Vax but more pro choice... The NBA should be considerate let left it as an option not mandate to take the shots
I used to give Kyrie credit, but he's solidified his position as a clown. Hope he gets released and no team picks him up or he retires.
As a member of the Native American community we would like to trade Kyrie Irving to the White Community for Alex Caruso.
OKC will work, complete opposite of the big big city
Kyrie ain’t been the same since he left LeBron
Can Steve Nash just suit up
No one giving this dude an extension and no championship team is signing this dude.   He shows up when he wants and plays when he wants to play. That’s not how you do things and he is not worth the troubles
One team who might trade for Kyrie is OKC. Trade Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and a couple picks they have in their war chest. SGA is a high character player and person. He will not flake on teams.
AND ALL THE MEDIA OUTLETS (WHICH ARE OWNED BY THE SAME COMPANY), YALL REPEAT THE SAME TALKING POINTS SHOWING HOW YALL ARE TRYING TO SWAY PUBLIC OPINION
So basically u don't  have a right to say no huh.. smfh
Lmaooo this is why nobody watches tv anymore
Who's watching NBA now anyways when you got NFL right now?
Shannon is lying sayin Erving has not communicated with the nets. and the nets know exactly what's going on. And skip is a puppet too saying because he don't want the vaccine he is foolish!!!!! Trump was right about all this fake news 🤔
I’m all fairness though, he shouldn’t be forced to take the vaccine. Plus if the other players are vaccinated what’s the problem…right? Listen I agree with kyrie it’s his choice, blame the leadership of the organization for enforcing the rule.
Big Pharma has it's hand stuck WAAAAYYY up Shannon and Skips back.  These are company talking points.  Everything said on this one was very disappointing.  I'm surprised at Shannon.  Smh. NBA will get BOYCOTTED this year and maybe even longer
Every time they troll kyrie by taking bout how he wants to be the “voice for the voiceless” or how he wants to be a “revolutionary visionary” it’s just makes me laugh cause I know they don’t believe it 😂😂😂
KI is a trouble maker, he is clueless about what he wants in life.  I will not be surprised if later on he plays for the WNBA because he changed his gender to woman.
So Kyrie has to get vaccinated to play for his team but opposing team players don’t have to get vaccinated to play them? Make it make sense please
As a Fan of the Boston Celtics i'm really glad that this is not Our Problem anymore, don't get me wrong he's a great player, but those things speak louder than his game, i'm sorry for The Brooklyn Nets Fans and i hope KI let this thing go and get the vaccine so he can play and maybe win this year.
Every time they bring up how if Kyrie and Love didn’t get hurt the Cavs would have won is annoying. By that logic if KD and Klay didn’t get hurt, Raptors don’t win a title...yet you never hear people bring that up. Media just sour that Cavs lost that season.
Grandma shay needs to sit Kyrie down. This is the same guy that didn't want the nba to go play in the bubble, when he wasn't even playing because of injury or s sabbatical or something. The one who suddenly started smoking incense before games in year 7 or 8 but does it before every game. Stephon mauberry compared Kyrie to Muhammad Ali, give me a break. Now I wasn't alive when this happened but basically Ali was willing to go to jail over his beliefs and might have, gave up his title and 2-3 years of his prime to boycott the draft and Vietnam I believe. Again might be mixed up cause I wasn't alive then but Ali was a true hero, pioneer and role model. Kyrie just wants to be center of attention always.
Kyrie should team up with Clay Travis. I think Clay is the only Trumper I know who hasn't got vacinnated with his recent tweet towards Stephen A. Smith.
So Skip believes it’s over with Kyrie in Brooklyn but believes Simmons will remain in Philly.  What kind of logic is this guy working with?
Crazy
Someone needs to take kyrie around the world to see the filled up  morgue. Blah
After a few months Brooklyn should trade Kyrie for Westbrook reunite the OKC big 3 in Brooklyn and reunite Kyrie with Lebron
The vaccine is a scam
Whether by injury or drama, this team is destined to fail.  They're basically the Clippers of the East.
Yea I wonder if lebron seen this coming. Behind the scenes
These guys did not watch his live lol media is foolish
I'm a Trumper. I'm one of those uneducated deplorables as you Demonrats call us. Even I got vacinnated twice. Yes, sounds hypocritical but all sides are hypocrites. We're all human. We're all hypocrites. Take the shots, Kyrie.
Get the vaccine you dope
Everyone seems to forget about the fiasco before the bubble 🤔
Kyrie is 2nd best first of all! Here goes the 🤡🤡 want it their way no other… Kyrie I support we should all be able follow own faith
Crazy how Kyrie wants to take stance on the vax shot yet nobody questions the 1,000's of fans that have been at these stadiums. If the sports world really cared then everybody entering the stadium should have to show proof of being vaxed. We all know that ain't happening.
Shannon says teams/franchise don't know what to expect from Kyrie but Kyrie can say the same thing that he didn't expect a team/franchise to oppress him. So when the franchise is unpredictable its okay. But for a player to be is not..
Capitalist mentality, no one respects people anymore .
Kyrie has even lower trading value than Simmons. NETS took him 'coz he was a package deal with KD.  Good going KD!
Kyrie is a Genius.... He will be the only NBA player without bloodclots and health problems.  watch by the middle of the season when the players start dropping dead or all types of illnesses.
Why do I have the feeling that Fox is forcing Skip and Shannon to be pro vaxx on TV?
I will clearly state that I do not condone many of Kyrie's past questionable behaviors but I stand with him when it seems that many do not. We need people like Kyrie to stand against this wave of pressure or we may end up with what is happening in Australia. You can see how everyone falls in line. They say "Just take the jab and you can have the world." Stand for something or fall for everything.
Kyrie is the nicest combo PG I've seen since Iverson. It's a shame we haven't been able to watch this man play
Skip can we just go back to the topic of king james cryrie is not worth talking his just problem after problem 😂😂😂
It’s funny how not one person in the media who supports him
Karl-Anthony Towns lost 6 relatives to covid including his mother, yet, Kyrie said he cares so much about the world which is why he isn't getting vaccinated.
Kyrie is delusional
Kyrie acts like a temp with a bad attitude with nothing to lose.   Reality he makes over 30 million a year...........
this isnt even locker room drama..... cmon Kyire
I hope Kyrie ended up playing for the bucks and eliminate nets from the playoffs. I love KD but I’m done with nets
Kyrie Irving is one the most selfish athletes I’ve ever seen. He’s trying so hard to be somebody instead of just BEING somebody
I’m glad he’s standing up to these commies forcing people to get vaccinated for a quick profit and to please investors
Lebron didn’t have no issue playing with Kyrie
Shannon: Can I count on you, Skip? Skip: 🤷‍♂ . . .  😄
Kyrie is a quieter Kanye
Kyrie got KD to Brooklyn.  He's being ridiculous.  This a a no stance. People around the world dead from the virus. THE CHINESE GOT VACCINATED,  SO THEY KNOW SOMETHING WE DON'T.  COME ON KYRIE. THINK. silly
If i don't show up for work and also don't call my boss to let him kno i don't have a job no more.
Kyrie for Westbrook without telling Lebron or KD. I would definitely watch that simulcast press conference. Lol.
Shannon, he did do it professionally. He said in his live that he was in contact with them AND they promised he would have exemption and went back on their word. You both are wrong on this.
They keep talking about the "regular world" and how the average person operates in that space etc. etc. but this isn't that, professionally sports is a whole other world. This isn't corporate America we are talking about so those rules don't apply over in Kyries world.. Shannon knows but it's weird cuz he currently works in corporate America so he keeps applying that to Kyries situation.. Will never work..
Kyrie will fold...pressure hasn't started, nets haven't lost a real game yet
The way I see it is Kyrie thinks his voice is bigger than the league… he gotta understand he’s not LeBron, KD, or Giannis… if one of those top 3 players said sum then the nba might care ‼️💯
The only relevant years Kyrie has had is when he was with Lebron. He has been irrelevant and/or a team cancer the other years.
The fact that u can't be who u are in this world is crazy everyone got an opinion but none of yall is him.
Dude not getting traded get off the gas the media do anything for views
Nash is probably thinking about that Ben Simmons trade now
Kyrie ain’t wrong.
NBA is rigged anyway, lol
The league can just ban Kyrie if he doesn't want to get vacinnated. Blackballed. Kaepernick no longer has a job and he actually stood up (or kneeled down) for something. Kyrie's reasoning is all vague like his recent God tweet.
It’s his body if he was white would the conversation be talked in a different manner???
Forcing players and ppl to get the vaccine is inhumane
I was watching Stephen A talk about the same topic, I closed that video 30secs in to watch this one.
Kyrie: Big head, small mind.
it's ironic both Kyrie and Ben have tremendous talent, but have issue with being professional when it comes to handling their business.
I think I pretty much understand what Skip and Shannon are trying to say. Kyrie is going to have to make a choice. He can’t live the best of both worlds. If you want to make a difference in the world you have to make sacrifices. That’s just my personal take away.
Not even joking but somebody from his tribe need to talk some sense into him.
I LOVE KYRIE HE'S MY HERO
Kyrie is a joke now. A shell of himself. Lost himself to the sad, wrong side of history.
Kyrie should've been fined a lot of money 9 months ago for going AWOL on the team and partying at his sister's party. I hate the new NBA for giving in to these overpaid brats. They need to lay the gauntlet on them all.
Just say it he was the best with LeBron period
I think he will retire. No team is gonna want him. He caused problems with the 3 teams he played for so far. Teams will not want that.
What a weird boy
Please don’t say Harden can lead.  That dude has failed in every season while padding his own stats.
# CONSEQUENCE The nets are now saying no ext for $186 mill next shoe to drop - nike cancel shoe deal // next shoe - gets traded to a bad team for peanuts // next - out of the league the beauty of ignorance is things can always get worse, and they usually do
It’s almost like a different show when neither Skip or Shannon’s “guys” are the topic. Not a complaint I watch them every day either way 🙌
As much as I love Kawhi on my Clippers, he shouldn't get paid for the games he is going to miss. The league needs to change it. Injuries happen all the time. Team owners needs more insurance.
I think kyrie is saving time because he knows he’s injury prone he’s gonna stretch this out as long as he can his body can’t take a whole season
So at first Irving believed or still believe the earth is flat and now he doesn’t want to get vaccinated….. this guy has 70iq
Why are other countries that we were told to follow getting rid of mandates and getting rid of vaccines then? Conspiracy theories?
No one is gonna talk about the nba just making up this rule?
So Kyrie didn't want to play with LeBron. He wanted his own team. That worked out well in Boston right????? And now this nonsense 😒
“GOOD BOY” SHANNON IS WHAT HE GOES BY NOW!
This is a real debate show ! First Take is awful now. Because ESPN is doing their best to give Stephen A what he wants
NBA should get much stricter. These athletes are overpaid spoiled brats. Fine players for missing games even if they're injured. This can eliminate load management and paid vacations. Don't give in to LeBrat's demands.
Soooooooo,  let me get this right. He's making a stand because someone is mandating putting something in his body that he doesn't feel comfortable in doing ⁉️⁉️ I would loooooove to see the narrative if there was something that Skip and Shannon was forced do, that they wasn't comfortable and doing and their jobs were on the line🤔🤔🤔🤔 Give me a break.  Be careful with all the energy you put on others, you maybe in a similar situation one day. This is disgusting
This is Kyrie LIFE!
Kyrie wants to have it both ways, he's more selfish on & off the court than ppl realize.
You can still get covid and DIE  EVEN if you get the shot , and even if Kyrie got the shot, he can still get covid and then what?  What? He has to sit out right?
🥱😴.
His body his choice.  Its not a basketball decision
Why does Skip keep calling Kyrie a revolutionary visionary? Guy's just a quack conspiracy theorist w/ the IQ of a box of corn flakes. Call it what it is.
Im sorry but ain't no way a needle is keeping me from 186 million to play basketball and the government need ppl alive to make money so they don't want you dead.
Kyrie trying to be woke not realizing how many people he could help in broken communities with $200 million. 😵‍💫
If Kyrie retired is he a HoF? I don't think so honestly
man y’all need to step out your tiny worlds stg. THIS AINT ABOUT BASKETBALL. wtf do y’all not get about that. He shouldn’t have to be forced to do anything with his body that’s it. and I’m even vaccinated. this should’ve affect nobody’s career in the first place. Thing of the bigger picture
Greatest Handles of all time.
When LeBron needed Kyrie the most, he hit a game winning shot and is the reason LeBron has one more title than he should have. Again, these commentators are absolute morons.
“I’m confused bruh” -Shannon
Let's support Kyrie and others like him Go Fund Kyrie 💯
Why would a team give up a single asset for Kyrie when he can opt out and become a free agent this summer?? Stop saying dumb stuff Shannon.
I wonder who will take him. Things atrted going down for him soon after he left cleveland
# CRA CRA CRAZY
My fav player but I wish his mental health was better
This is bigger then basketball
Kyrie really is the dumbest smart athlete ever 😂 if only he could put his energy at the right place
people saying bron to play basketball and not say anything are the same people saying kyrie has his own choice ,lmao
TRADE HIM TO DETROIT
Can't have your cake and eat it too. All freedoms have good n bad consequences. Pick your poison, this ain't rocket science
Kyrie is NOT getting traded. Just throw that out the window. He said he's not retiring. So the only solution which is the easiest one is get vaccinated. Follow the rules. NO PLAY, NO PAY. The league doesn't need you, Kyrie.
The earth is flat,  and Kyrie is bigger than basketball.
Dam unc you soft shoeing aint ya
The government has had lotteries to try and get people vaccinated! Some states/cities offered 100$ per person! Those two things alone would be enough for me NOT to get vaccinated. The government still sells cigarettes, KNOWN to cause cancer! ALL the fast food chains are still open and they cause obesity and diabetes!  BUT all of a sudden ALL of these restrictions and rules and to keep everyone SAFE because the government is worried about their health lol. I don’t buy that for 1 minute.... Good luck bots!
I don't understand how the "protected" need "protection" from the "unprotected" if they're so "protected" 🤔  Last week CNN ran a story acknowledging the vaccine reduced your natural immunity to other viruses.  Several million people have now been affected negatively by the Vax. Men and boys have developed heart issues. Women and girls have developed reproduction issues. Covid plus vaccine equals less people now and in the future. Which gates and others have been saying for years, is needed.  We had native Americans that told other native Americans, it's ok, the white people are good people. We all know how that worked out.  It's simple, our bodies our choice! High school like peer pressure and group thinking is another dead giveaway.   Golabal genocide on a massive level and most people do their research on T.V and social media.
Gotta make our own narratives..:: can’t leave it to them….
Are we really talking about this???? If he doesn't want the shot then what are we doing????? Oh ok so we're gonna make him???? There's no choice now??? If LBJ said dont take the shot then the league wouldn't and the world would love him for it.
Kyrie a real one! Fk that vaccine 💯
What does Chris Paul going to play for another team have anything to do with someone else's health? These guys are morons.
Its not called unpredictability its called being unprofessional - issues at the Cavs, issues at the Celtics and now issues at the Nets and the common denominator in all of that is................Kyrie.  A supreme waste of immense talent that no organisation should ever consider bringing him into their team unless they are looking to be the centre of all the wrong kind of attention and paying for someone to potentially implode your whole team....then he is the GOAT!
Sorry but Kyrie Irving means more than the whole organization.
We gotta wake up folks… no 1is mentioning the fact that SEVERAL are taking the same stance…. Not just Kyrie…. White and black.. nations are standing up as well… but somehow Kyrie is more important than that….:: 🤔interesting
Love to have him in Miami.  Funny how the whole concept of "Freedom in America" has come full circle for Kyrie.  Turns out white privilege only exists for Democrats and what they believe in and the stuff they want to push. "Leftist Privilege" is where Racism actually still exists in this country.
So standing up for freedom against real oppression isn't good enough and he should forget it. But all the taking the knee nonsense on make belive systemic racism and make belive police brutality when it dealt with repeat offenders that resisted arrest and bor8ght it on themselves was a good cause. STOP ALREADY
I’m not surprised by Skip but Shannon is showing his true colors. He’s a coward with no backbone who’s a good ol boy for the company. They say attack Kyrie for standing on his decision and Shannon says, “Yes sir boss.” All that Unc stuff is out the window
Cousins wasn't even 30 yet and only got league minimum. Same with Drummond. Isaiah isn't even in the league any more. Kyrie doesn't appreciate what he has. He's an ungrateful deserter. A flaker. A kooky Flat Earther.
Kyrie Irving in your team🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
That is the only part i don't get you don't want be vaccinated and not give up the money but that is exactly what your doing by not getting vaccinated.
Kyrie is a little better version of young Kemba walker with a ring change my mind
Only place for Kyrie is Texas Houston Rockets. Texas is anti vaccine mandates state.
Kyrie's video was very contradicting, he made it seem like he has no problem getting the shot but at the same time having a problem getting the shot.
Kyrie might be trolling us. That this is all a ruse to entertain us and attract more attention on him. But even if he was and got vaccinated tomorrow, he's ruining his value to teams. He may never get a big contract ever again.
If Steve Nash was anywhere near his playing days , he’d be my pg over Kyrie any day.
Kyrie wants to play. The nba wont let him because because he doesn’t want to get vaccinated. These people are misleading the facts
Shannon is a communist
If he doesn't come back, he might mess it up for players to get guaranteed money.
I respect kyrie so much they’re trying to smear this mans name it’s such a shame what media is doing to him.
I’ll be honest, it is not really my bosses right to know their employees medical info.  That is between a doctor and patient, just as much as a patient and psychologist or a client and a lawyer.  This is privileged info.  If Kyrie doesn’t want to disclose to his boss if he got the jab or not it is in his HIPAA rights.
Kyrie is the personification of the truth of the saying, “the best ability is availability”
Funny, he took a stance on a social issue he believes in and he's a bad guy ..becuase it goes against what the left and democrats want.
He's not going to get traded because no team wants him. Even bad teams. He can opt out next summer. What's the point? He'll likely get banned from ever playing another NBA game again for not getting vaccinated.
RESPECT UNTO YOU SIR. SOMETIMES IN LIFE A MAN TAKES HIS OWN STANCE. MANHOOD IS AT A LOST IN THIS BRAIN WASH EFFEMINIZATION PROCESS (TV). FACT IS SOME OF US WILL DIE FIGHTING BEFORE WE LET ANYONE VIOLATE OUR BELIEFS (MANHOOD)🥊💯🎺
New Orleans will take him
At the end it was like they was trying to get the Gms attention in the league pointed out all of Kyrie flaws. Almost like a backwards car salesman
Basketball not more important than The Most High
I really don’t think they’ll trade him
Skip keeps talking about invaded people getting him sick but they’re not saying that you can catch it and spread it if your fully vaccinated , why do you think Jaylen Brown and Al Hortford who are vaccinated still caught Covid and have to stay away from the Celtics right now, but nobody’s talking about that
See how to talking heads on TV say you should get vaccinated because somehow they know what's best for kyrie and his health? See how kyrie was a hero when he was buying George Floyd's family houses and now he's enemy number 1. See how the liberals make you the bad guy when you do not agree with them at every moment
Skip and Shannon make it seem like Kyrie is a selfish person that is refusing to play basketball .. when it's the vaccine mandate that's PREVENTING him from playing.. these two Democrats believe the motto "my body my choice" only applies to women and abortions.. so Kyrie is selfish in their eyes.. maybe Kyrie should go Republican.. (They buy sneakers too)  Republicans don't see a selfish Kyrie, they see a free man exercising his rights .. LISTEN .. Democrats will trade liberty for safety, and Republicans will not.. this show is just Democrat propaganda, thus you are always bad if you don't follow the Democrat agenda :/
All respect to kyrie! His body his choice
“All those conspiracy theories” that skip and shannon know aren’t theories💀
Health is more important than 200 mil !!!!
He’s going to the Lakers
Kryie Irving for John Wall! #1. Houston TX isn't a covid mandated town. So he can play both home games and most away games.  #2. If he retires Houston can save $ , and Houston gets out of the 2 year 91 million dollar Wall Contract.  #3. Nets can get not only John Wall who is still a decent player but other pieces like Eric Gordon and others to help the nets win the title
The problem with the league is that it isn't acknowledging the existence of natural immunity through prior cases. They have even more resistance than those who were vaccinated, and yet, they are still required to get vaccinated anyways? That makes no sense.
Kyrie hasn’t played a “full season” since he left the cavs…. He’s full time scammer. 😂
The raptors is made for Kyrie. Loyal fan base who will take to him immediately. Since lowry left there's a gap for a new hero there
I'm just glad Kyrie is doing this now and not when he was with Lebron and the Cavs
SHANNON  AND SKIP I TOLD EVERYONE  THAT  I KNOW  THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN  WITH  KYRIE IRVING  I NEW  THIS WAS GONNA  HAPPEN  MONTHS AGO  KYRIE  IS GONNA BE KYRIE  NO MATTER WHAT IF HE GOT TRADED  HE WOULD  DO THE SAME  THING  TO THE NEXT  ORGANIZATION
This dude is soooooo overrated. If I'm the nets I'm trading him period. Send him to the kings for buddy and a 1st and move on.
They turn on everyone who will not bend the knee and submit. Basketball is a game. There is more to life. Kudos is he dosen't want the shot
Kyrie stood his ground.
He did talk to his boss and teammates. They all knew his stance
Nobody has ever woken up and said "I need to learn something from Kyrie Irving today" ... dude is a clown.
Ky: I wanna be the voice for the voiceless Voiceless: 👀🙄
Kyrie seems to be lost and scared.
The league won't miss Kyrie if he doesn't play
Bruh I’m so disappointed in Shannon. He switched up on this one.
Traded to who? Why does the media seem to think Kyrie is tradeable? The whole world can see the issue Kyrie has been for the Nets in now his 3rd season why would any other owner or GM want to put up with this mess? Kyrie can't be traded but the Nets now have grounds to terminate Kyries contract.
They can trade kyrie to teams without a vaccine mandate. I think the Rockets, Mavs, Suns, Pacers, Heat, Magic and the Hawks are located in states that banned vaccine mandate.
Look this situation has to be looked at from both lenses 1. Kyrie has the right to choose what he puts in his body he is right also like he said he has to think about him and his family. 2. The nets also have the right to do what’s best for them also they have all collectively have got vaccinated so ownership and the team want to win a championship.  Im proud of Kyrie for standing up for what he believes in. But I also understand ownership I don’t think Kyrie is selfish he just standing up for what he believes in
The media will always lick the boot, This is similar to what they did to Kwame Brown, running their mouth.
But why are y’all speaking for KD & Harden 🤔 Neither one of them have said anything 🤷🏻‍♂️ Some things are more important than a Championship💯
Nice one shannon cryrie kyrie is just a diva his young idiots fans dont understand wat is work ethics 😂😂😂😂
Lakers need to trade Russ for Kyrie...that way OKC Big 3 get reunited and Bron gets his Robin back...i want to see them back again winning another one
Freedom is more important than money and championships.. media simps will never understand
Thank you kyrie making a stand !! Rest just sheep's
I hope he doesn’t get traded
I really wonder how long can Kyrie live off a shot he made 5 years ago……ever since then and leaving Cleveland, he has accomplished NOTHING. Yes he is a great talent but he has been in the headlines more for negative things than he has for his actually play on the court.
Im just glad he didn’t do this when he was with lebron and the cavs
Please y’all stop following espn we don’t watch it for a reason talk about something else leave this bs to the other network got damn!
So he’s just supposed to take a jab for a championship, it seems easy but we don’t know what’s in that vaccine. You won’t know what it does to the body for years to come. It’s a 99% recovery rate yet you need to just take it? It makes no sense
I don’t know why people care so much about Kyrie. He can’t stay healthy, he messes up the team chemistry, and he does stuff that makes absolutely no sense. He’s not even a top 10 PG in the NBA rn!
This story is ridiculous. Most of the NBA players are vaccinated. Why not focus on them?
Please stop it. We should not compare Kyrie with racists republicans. He has valid points.
Kyrie is enjoying the attention, like Lebron. He'll be back in the middle of the season because vaccine mandate will end. The infection rate is on the downward trend. The media needs to stop talking about Kyrie and Ben.
Brooklyn is alot farther than 1 hour from Philadelphia come on skip smh 2 totally different states what college did you attend
Nets are done without kyrie.  He should go somewhere and demolish the league once again. I support his decision
Good an nba players with balls go to a red state where we dont control your life
ii felt tht wen skip said "tha only SHIP tht matters issa CHAMPIONSHIP"!!! thts real asf...
He is predictable The mask and testing negative was good enough last year. But now it's not!?!?! So how is Kyrie the problem again lol smh
See I said this last year that Brooklyn should trade Kyrie to N.Y.C for D Rose, Mitchell and one more defensive piece, but no. I saw this coming a mile away. They need more rebounding and defense. They can win without Kyrie if they fill up those holes.
Whats the problem? Stop raping people with illegal vax mandates and he will play. Problem solved.
Yep, his last 4 to 5 yrs is very questionable to continue his career in the NBA. I think this troublenfor him
Shannon tries his best to keep MJ. Out his mouth. That's funny to me.
they killed him whole segment long lol
Can ya talk about the rest of the nba taking the vaccine?  Some positive he doesn’t wanna take it oh well Astros game tonight talk something else
I hate that these media guys are all trying to play Kyrie like he planned all of this... There would be no issue if he didn't have to get vaccinated. Why are these cowards attacking Kyrie?  Why are they scared to call out the municipalities implementing these mandates and the NBA enforcing it. It's Kyrie's body and he can do whatever he wants with it, why is that so controversial.
KD is not letting that happen.
Everything said here was true......
Elite athletes are able to get away with anything!!!! When they do stuff like this, they need to be held accountable
Trade him to a deep red state team...Texas...Georgia etc etc
If this madness is going on by next season , we are going to have more problems then worrying about Kyrie getting traded.
Nets need to get rid of Kyrie.. he’s nothing but a distraction..Nets can win the title without him
RESPECT FOR KYRIE
I would love kyrie in OKC with Shai. That's at least a 6 seed.
It was only a matter of time before Kyrie's foolishness reared its ugly head again
He isn’t retiring but he isnt going away because he wants to keep the nets hanging or maybe wants the new contract
Malcom X talked about men like Shannon and especially Stephen A
A lot of smart people who dont spend all day talking sports believe these mandates will lift by early nxt yr.   THAT is what he is waiting for
If they put the same energy towards the mandates fighting against Biden and all those involved with the mandates they might just consider making it free choice.
This dude is a fking drama queen. I dont care how good he is, he's not good for the locker room.
These guys forgot there has never been anything in life FORCED on us!! Let that man do whatever HE wants to do!! It's between him, his fam & God! PERIOD!!! He's not conforming! Proud of KYRIE!!!👊🏽
A blessed day to you brothers and sisters. (We are called to be family in Christ!🙂) Family, JESUS CHRIST THE LORD DIED FOR OUR SINS, HE WAS BURIED, AND HE ROSE AGAIN THE THIRD DAY! Peace and love to you all in the name of the Lord Jesus!🙂
Why should Irving have to Apologize for fighting for what he believes in? See this is the Type of stuf MJ was trying to avoid & he still got labeld so now with Irving its proof your Dam if u do & Dam if u dont.
Voice for the voiceless?  Kyrie is adding his voice to the already loudest crowd.
Kyrie is the Kanye West of Basketball. He knows how to shake up things.
Trade him for Simmons. He does need to shoot thats it
Disney & Fox employees are REQUIRED to get the vaccine.
And also the sm-102 then Lucifer race drug he does not want the DNA of Satan so that's why he's standoffish his body his choice
Kyrie just go ahead and retire, the game will not miss you.
The Lord Jesus Christ said we are in the world but we are not of the world for if we were of the world the world would love us but because he chose us the world hates us and he let us know to know that the world hated him long before they hated us!
Those picks and swaps the rockets got for harden are looking better by the day
There is absolutely no reason for Kyrie to bend the knee and take this vaccine. He's a healthy 30 year old with a near 0 statistical risk of serious infection from Covid - he may even have natural immunity which is 6-13x superior compared to the vaccine.   The vaccine does't prevent infection or transmission and has a 6 month efficacy window before you start needing boosters, this why you aren't considered vaccinated in places like Israel without at least 3 shots. So why would he risk a potential adverse side effect to a vaccine he doesn't need, and that doesn't work as well as initially advertised?  If you think these mandates stop at vaccines you haven't been paying attention - I guarantee you boosters will also be mandatory within the next 12 months.
Damn Stephen A. Shannon eaze up
New NBA rule  One psychopath per team  Nets are two over the limit
Skip dyed his hair?
It seems y’all are more mad about Kyrie playing than he is. Obviously he’s motivated by more than just money
The Nets don’t need Kyrie to win a championship😂 All this uproar over nothing
If we keep it just basketball and Kyrie just needs more time to figure his choice on what he wanna do with this body, u have a long regular season that I don't need him for. The nets have 2 top 5players, "kd best player on the planet", that ain't enough?! Yall always talk about stacking the decks. They pay him for clutch playoff moments. Leave him alone and give him the time he needs.... This is America and it's looking like we don't have rights and freedoms anymore
Lol they are literally calling Kyrie an old Ferarri LFAO!!!
I hope he gets traded to another planet. People like this don't deserve our oxygen 😒 this dude should not be allowed to have an IG. The amount of b.s and ignorance is ridiculous. I feel bad for people that are with him 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
This means Nets are no longer a super team till Kyrie is back.
How y’all mad at him for doing what’s best for him
Lol it’s funny how Kyrie hasn’t hurt anybody but everybody is upset with him
When it's all done truth will overcome the fear and the lies. Quit making statements about this man, he's a free man.
Trade westbrick for kyrie, kyrie runites with bron Nd westbrick reunites eith his buddies harden, durant
I don't think he'd look foolish if he eventually takes the vaccine... no one said Wiggins looks foolish... losing 17mil and not playing the game you love nay change your mind.. it changed Andrew Wiggins
Lost a lot of respect for Shannon
He should Join CP3 & Devin Booker   1. LAKERS LAKERS LAKERS 2. Bucks 3. 76ers 4. Nuggets 5. Mavs clippers&nets Won't Win JACK.
What was kooky about what Kyrie said last night? It’s foolish pride if someone doesn’t agree with you?? These dudes won’t dare even sit on this platform and talk about the pros/cons of the jab but they will talk about every con dealing with Kyrie this ish is disgusting
Trade him for Dame
Hope he goes to the MAVS
Now let’s address skip. Implying he should or could would want to back off from his beliefs.  Hey skip the hypocrite, not everyone is like you.
"I can't put all my eggs in Kyrie's basket and he trips on the way to the market."  Shannon Sharpe, 2021
Shannon keeps spitting facts.  People seem to really think that it's ok for kyrie to do whatever he wants.
Its not Kyrie won’t take the vaccine it’s just this his 3rd team with problems. He’s become a liability outside of taking the vaccine.
the voice of the voiceless?  the voiceless that kyrie is talking about are filling up the hospitals
Kyrie just be yourself! Dont listen from them. Dont play.  From a Bucks fan
Just leave this man alone. This is all his personal choice, and dissecting his personal decisions, is insane. His body, his money, his career, his life, his choice.
When You could win the next 2-3 titles but you're too scared to take a shot
I'm not anti-vac but I am pro choice and what they are doing to Kyrie is horrible just because he don't want to get vaccinated so they villafy an demonize him for standing up for what he believes in damn talk about go along get along gang this is just ridiculous 😒🙄
Kyrie is worth a lot, but the trouble associated with him is not worth the hassle.
Their is a player or players out there that could’ve made the draft and would’ve done anything to play right now. I love Kyrie the player but man it’ll be a waste of enormous talent if he retires because of the vaccine
Shannon Sharp wrong again. Mr Sharp you are full of poop and evil at that.  People owe zero to any workplace forcing a jab.
Kyrie the biggest diva in the NBA
: )
Therapy saves lives.
Good job kyrie do not let people force u
Hes just a narcissist.
Kevin Love was never a factor ever in Cleveland. Stop saying he was hurt in the first series.
on a side note sixers should of kept markell fultz
So we all know that this is a tv show and they are doing their part to drive ratings…but come on now…y’all are purposely misrepresenting what he said for y’all’s own gain which is shameful
Kyrie = Kanye with a crazy layup package
Kyrie for Ben Simmons.  Do it!
Kyrie... is a 🤡!  Good luck on his future.
Time to tear kyrie down since he doesn't follow what they want him to. Putting words in his mouth, saying what they think he feels.  Why not ask the man himself but no just throw out stories of well i think this and that
Who was Kyrie before Lebron... kemba walker Stop giving this man all this credit
“Could u imagine giving him 200m guaranteed? Hed come and go as he pleases” I said this yesterday when they revoked it lol.
He talking directly to anyone calling him or anyone a fool stupid or dumb ....it's not about money,,its about this specific virus and so called cure, not flu , measles or rubella  just this specific roll out  take it or dont get paid,  take it or dont go to grocery store, get it or dont fly.... if you dont have an understanding of the bible religion and beliefs established thousands of years prior to covid ,  it wont make sense lol
Everyone is upset because Kyrie didn't want to play with LeBron and help him win more championships. He never asked to be sent to Boston he has to be sent away from Cleveland. It has been a lot of players who have had a problem with the boss the organization in the last 10 years not just Kyrie Irving. And now he just doesn't want to be forced to take a vaccination. And you're up here talking about the man like he is a criminal period when your record and arrest sheet is way longer than Kyrie's
*So Kyrie has to get vaccinated to play for his team but opposing team players don’t have to get vaccinated to play them? Make it make sense please🤦🏿‍♂️*
the comments on shannon's IG about this are hilarious. "he's a free thinking black man" so he's the only idiot in the nba who won't get vaxxed? LOL also how does race have anything to do with this.
So if Kapernick takes a stance, he’s seen as a hero. Kyrie takes a stance and now he’s been seen as a villain. Its easy to judge someone by their actions, but if you do judge, keep the same energy for all cases
Kyrie don’t trust the gubment, nuff said
All y’all doing is talking about basketball. Do y’all not understand that’s it’s bigger than that? He wants to hoop but is more concerned about his health and what’s gets put into his body.
I’m sick of America and sports 🏀🏈⚽️ ⚾️ at this point. Leave that brotha alone. You going to start seeing people’s true colors  and agendas, for example Stephen A, he’s sickening. They happy when he puts a ball 🏀 in a basket but unhappy when he makes individual decisions goes to show you what’s wrong with America. This is bigger than sports and winning championships. Wake the f up.
Kyrie refuses to participate in a society that forces people to do something against their will because being free is his Birthright... Yell that out loud skip
That would be very understandable, they sees he's a big headache to the organization.
I get what Kyrie saying but bro you giving up a lot of money that if you really wanted to be the people's champ play the games get your checks and set up with local programs and charities to help those people that actually need it. But right now you giving up 234 million just to die on a mountain by yourself.
I think tv sports analyst treat this issue as a sports issue and it’s not. Kyrie don’t wanna take the vaccine for his life sake and him not taking it is not a smack to the nba they just fine it’s deeper than that that’s why you hear so many people backing him and they don’t even watch basketball
Kyrie refuses to participate in a society that excludes people based on their medical status... Shannon I know you didn't take the jab
Hypocrites. Are they paying yall bonus payment to bash on Kyrie Irving. Lets see how many days you guys going to talk against him while he's minding his business and not playing.
sam presti rubbing his hands like birdman rn
He's the last player that you would trust to be his own coach,  the Kobe Michael Jordan to name a few. Not even close for Kyrie.
Kyrie doesn't need to get the vaccine and the team doesn't need to pay him its simple really.
The media is loving Kyrie. 24/7 news cycle.
I hate that this man's talent is otherworldly and we hardly get to see him on the court smh
Unc   I’m all through Chicago being your spokesperson   However I’m very disappointed in you on this topic but I get it
Kyrie has earth flatten his way out the league..... He took his stance and the NBA took theirs..... Good luck 🤞🏽
Kyries call of duty clan has superceded  his contract with the Nets
Kyrie and embiid won’t work. I know my Cameroonian brother Joel, they’re going to clash regularly.
No he would not be standing alone. It is plenty people and players supporting carrier. Did you not see all the players supporting him in his live in the comments. Stop reporting lies and giving y'all negative opinions about this man
Stop giving your personal opinions about Kyrie and stick to what he said. We don't care what your belief and opinion about something you don't know about. What we know is what he said.
Kyrie good and a legend if he go on wit basketball or not.
Shannon is buttering them biscuits up for his master.
Imagine a world where they trade Kyrie for Westbrook....
Nobody trading for Kyrie at this point
Everybody's not a sellout like you Shannon
The Nets will be fine an Kyrie will handle his business for the team an himself to move forward‼️💯
What if he takes the vaccine & gets traded anyway lol
Preach it Unc, let them know about the dangers of the elusive flat earther lol
😂✌ Kyrie is just doing what he did in Cleveland! & what he did in Boston! And is now doing it again in Brooklyn! Finding a reason NOT to play preseason!
Please tell me all you vaccine experts what is in the vaccine that is so bad??
The unvaccinated put absolutely NO ONE at jeopardy
is amazing how the media is mad because Kyrie is controlling the situation and not letting them in his business. And the black men in the media are the main ones going in on him. My young black brothers please let this be a lesson to you. Learn how to speak and stand with your brother whether we decide to do what you do or not because it is several different roads that lead you to the right place.
He's trying to find a loophole so he doesn't have to play and can still collect his money
“If I’m gonna be demonized for having more questions & taking my time & make a decision with my life than that’s my decision” -Kyrie Irving   Why is that so hard for these guys to understand it’s “his CHOICE”
Let's go Brandon!
So the league and jobs telling people something thats gettin put in your body won't be mandatory and then making it mandatory or else u fired ain't gone be talked about? Smh and Shannon tagged along wit the bs lol.
He said he wasn’t retiring so teams could actually trade for him now.
Why do we even care. Just let him play and shut up
Lebron would take kyrie and ship Westbrook out in a heartbeat
🧢🦝 Sellout
If you think about it his best bet is texas or Florida.  But which of those teams would actually take that gamble 🤔
Who cares.. Just let the man play basketball.
If kyrie was really about it then he would have walked away by now. I know for me i would never hesitate on my morals.
History is catching up with kyrie
Everyone should just mind there business!
Somebody tell me the reason why Lebron James came back to Cleveland after leaving to Miami 😡?
I agree that Kyrie’s decision to get vaccinated or not is his choice. He just has to understand, which I believe that he does, that his choice will have consequences.
Trade? They want the whole league to take the venom. So he go be on a new team with the same problem. Wth smh
Y’all tryna bully him into submitting to the white man. Why would he trust that foreign substance
Please stop this, yall takes are annoying and so obviously biased. Enough on this topic please 😂
How many times are we going to talk about the same thing? It's Kyrie's choice if he doesn't want to be vaccinated. Besides, the situation can be resolved if they get rid of the mandate in a couple of months.
GO ALONG GET ALONG GANG!!!!
Kyrie is talking about people being canceled for not complying with the mandates
Its 50/50. There's really no way to predict this. COVID isnt part of an NBA contract.
John Wall for Irving
Kyrie: IG Live  SAS: RANTS!
Kyrie is a wannabe Colin Kap
Free CROWDER! LET's go Brandon F O R E V ER
Dam Shannon you too now huh, another puppet pushing the corporate narrative......
I DIDNT KNOW KYRIE WAS SIGNED WITH THE BROOKLYN NAZIs
Respect kyrie decision and keep it moving
Everyone apologise to Bron, they said playing with Lebron was the problem!
Go Along Get Along Gang.
Ben Simmons would play a game in Philly before Kyrie even plays a game in Brooklyn
He gonna take that shot whether he like it or not you ain’t special kyrie u human just like the rest of us period
Sharp tap-dancing for the vaccine agenda.
As a Vaccinated Milwaukee Bucks Fan, we stand with Kyrie! Don't let them give you that vaccine!😉😉😉
Kyrie has a point , the league said it won’t be required to be vaccinated and he’s holding them accountable, they just want kyrie to “shut up and dribble” at the end of the day it’s still a money making business and the league moves on with or without him
Kyrie is the truth
💖🌷💖🌷💖🌷Love the channel !
Irving to lakers.
This is what these 2 clowns talked about for the first 80 min of the show UNSUBSCRIBED
I think the nets would be fine with just a healthy KD and Harden.
So in other words y’all just want Kyriee to shut up and dribble! Noted
Kyrie will be back playing for the nets trust me
Shannon stop it. We stand with Kyrie. He can decide to do whatever he wants. Im sure he knows how much he stands to lose. Why you so concerned about it. Worry about you and yours. Broke hip chump
Sports media loves attacking Kyrie
Lol damn the media hate Kyrie so much that Skip was willing to give LBJ another ring just to make Kyrie look bad.
Free Kyrie! “🇺🇸??”
All the bandwagon Nets fans already have their excuse set up again if Nets lose to the Bucks.
Bro they keep saying that but who really need kyrie
Just let em be its his choice i wanna see him play bt if he dont i still believe we can win a chip !!! If he hasnt decided by season opener than we move on bt i respect his stance even doe i hate it , cause as a black man we do have to be skeptical of this world an the intentions. Bt as a fan this 2 shall pass 🤷‍♂️🙏🙌
We talking about a "GAME" ......IF HE DON'T WANT TO TAKE A VAC HIS CHOICE. Remember this is a child game ...it's not 🌎 moving . Period. Remember Ali did the same thing. The only thing now is; will he walk away from it all like Ali 🤷🏿‍♀️
I wonder if Shannon realizes the most unvaccinated ppl in the country, particularly NY where kyrie is, are young black men. Kyrie is basically standing up for those ppl & those losing their jobs like healthcare workers in NY over vaccination. Yet these 2 just continue to be sheep
I like how they upload this first while the show is still going lmaooo see how the media use this situation to get more views
Have fun in retirement Qyrie! Looking forward to his future Tucker Carlson appearance and conspiracy theory podcast.
Meh ! Y’all just dragging this story too much now. Who cares if he want to get vacs or not ? The media is so on early dramatic about everything and seems to let everybody personal choice in life bother them
He like a fine woman that got too much baggage...lmao...i want yo talent but not ya problems buddy
Just imagine the shot like it was Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Kyrie
This is why Kyrie trashed all of you "reporters" on his IG. One day, you support him. Then the next day, you trash him and it wasn't even called for. All of them only know how to stir up issues rather than actual "reporting" on "rumors" from "anonymous" sources 🙄💯
There’s not one member standing behind this man. It seems like Shannon is becoming a boot licker as well.
We just learned that fewer than 20 NBA players in the ENTIRE LEAGUE are unvaccinated.   But 16,700 NYPD officers are unvaccinated.   61 NYPD officers have died from Covid.  But New York City is refusing to mandate that police get it while insisting that Kyrie Irving must.
LeBron the greatest for winning a chip with trouble maker Kyrie!
Shannon and Skip just mad that Kyrie exposed them for all the fallacies and lies and misinformation that they put out against him🤷‍♂️💯
Kyrie is truly something else
