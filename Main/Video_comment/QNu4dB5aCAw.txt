terrible striker, great wingers
71 international goals for lukaku noice!
I love this highlights package.  Belgium highlights: Goal 1 Goal 2 Goal 3  Swedish highlights: Missed chance Zlatan subbed on
What a performance and that 3rd assist was so good left 2 defenders on the floor reminds me of kakas goal v united 🤩
Sweden won't be achieving anything other than defeats with "hair fixing" Lindelof!  Every 2 minutes he is stroking his hair 😅
Eden burger missing?
ibra in 2023 LOOOL trash
Just why is ibra benched for 70 mins
Belgium are back! But what about that dude Zlatan? Incredible.

Tap in merchant
Lukaku as always, acting like he is elite and does NOTHING else to help the team
4:12....AYooooooo
Sweden is famous for burning the Quran and discriminating Muslims... but not famous in anything else.
THE LION ZLATAN IS BACK IN THE SWEEDEN TEAM SINCE 2015
Zlatan just played at 41, you telling me ronaldo won’t be playing at 42, he’s going to another euro and another World Cup. I got a bet he don’t retire till 45.
Romelu business as usual 😎👍
Captain Super Kev 💙
They need to make up for the awful WC.
https://youtu.be/_gtq_2w-9GE
Ronaldo will be playing for Portugal at 45
Anyone who watched the game fully. Did they see Lukaku and Zlatan talk or shake hands?
good game, sorry for Sweden
He's a brown man
Lukaku missed so much in WC. This performance is nothing.
why was lukebakio so good 😂😂
Sweden have some great attacking players, but the really cannot defend.
they better hope Morocco don't get through XD
useless record!
as a villa fan can somebody please buy olsen
1:17 bro what is that
Fair to say Forsberg didn't have his greatest game
bro rlly did neymars celebration 💀
Big Roms with a hatrick love it !
Sweden are crap 😂😂😂😂
Welcome to Chelsea
LAKAKAA
Good to see Zlatan 🎉🎉
Olsen is that u
Lukaku has that goal poaching style like Gary Lineker.
Lukaku sometimes plays rubbish like Emile Heskey.
Didn't the swedish kick cross the goal line?
That's the result u get when u don't have a manager have u playing silly tippy tappy football
What is that celebration, if you wanna copy Rashford Lukaku, just go for it bro..
4:16 😂😂😂
Lukaku is a donkey.
I can’t stop calling him lakaka
Lukaku is such a donkey lol
I dont think lukaku had a wash for days before this game, None of the Swedish defenders wanted to stand near him
Poor Sweden - the dream in tatters as their nation collapses
Still lukakaaaaa
Lukebakio killed it this game. Big probs to Lukaku, love seeing him prove his haters wrong.  4:10 gotta love the celebration too lmao
Lukaku back to Everton please, as Chelsea don't seem to want him.
YEAH , THATS WHY IT WAS TOO EASY FOR BELGUIM , WITH PENSIONERS LIKE ZLATAN GETTING A GAME FOR SWEDEN HAVE THEY NOT GOT ANY DECENT YOUNGER GUYS GOOD ENOUGH , SWEDEN FOR YEARS USED TO BE A GOOD TEAM AND VERY DIFFICULT TO BEAT , NOT NOW !
Not sure why Zlatan even bothered coming back..Sweden are absolute trash now!
Chelsea needs a striker
Sweden are the England of Scandinavian footie.
Classic Belgium and Lukaku winning/scoring when nothing is really at stake
Lukebakio's passing is crazy good
The Belgian Harry Maguire.
isak is swedens only current standout player
Stormzy is pretty good at football ngl
Lukaku is shit hope he doesn't come back to Chelsea
Only if I didn't know what Belgium people have done in Africa look who saving their ass now lol.
Lukaku v Zlatan again  Well played Lukaku come back to your best ASAP😊
Belgium having a pitch pep talk after a goal against Sweden in qualifying 😂. Behave yourself!
Swedenstan has white players?? Weird!
People are hyping zlatan too much...he is not even on lewandowski level😂😂
LAKAKA🐐
This commentator 🤝 the word 'bemoan'
🤫🤫What’s all that about..Zlatan is king 👑
Ibrhimovic he's not doing the best the now but he is probably the best player for Sweden
Lukebakio guy is 🔥
What do you expect the head coach is an ITALIAN from Reggio Calabria
There ain’t a lot of Belgium in Belgium, no?  👀
Please please comeback to Everton
Good to see the boy Rom shining 😍
keep up the good work Lukewarm hopefully now we can get some Money back! i dont care if he is the highest scorer in Tournament He Disrespect Us & cannot catch a Bus!
Bro broke 2 ankles with 1 touch 💀
Lukabacio was amazing!
why isnt anyone talking about Lukebakio
Why cant Faes play like this for Leicester
How’s Lukaku no.10? That looks crazy
Sweden are never this shit when they play England
Belgium still  don't rate them  or   lakaka
It looks like this Belgium side is more deadly than their so-called Golden Generation. Bloody hell!
damn if zlatan is the future of swedish football im scared for them
Zlatan making history same match as Lukaku getting an hattrick. I do hope their mothers get on.😂
Ibrahimovic is a horrible person and I don't think many of you realise that. You all seem to idolise him
Glad Zlatan was humiliated.
wt a game from lukebakio
hopefully some club sees this and buys him off chelsea...
The easiest hat trick any striker can get.. Not impressed lol. Hopefully we dont get him back in Sep
We can see what a new coach can do when he shakes things up and gives young players a chance!If you are not playing well and a regular at club level, you should be nowhere near the national team!Nigeria needs to learn this if they want the Super Eagles to fly again!Happy for Lukaku.
I've seen Lukaku suffer, so it was great to see himself.
Zlatan and Lukaku don’t get along so Lukaku will raise his game on this occasion my opinion
Lukaku the kind of guy to be shit for 9 months then have 1 good game and shush everyone
Lukaku's goals are just failed first touches
much more positive from Belgium going forward
This match match was supposty be remberd for Zatlan but Lukaku took over there show Lukaku will take that 😁
After the long lost Ronaldo, its now down to Rashford and Lukaku to fight it out for the most meaningless goal celebration!
Zlatan doesn’t write history   History writes Zlatan
Wonder if Ibra & Lukaku shook hands after 🤣
That was Lakaka playing!!
Lindelof is garbage. Please finally leave Manchester United in the Summer. You're far too weak as a CB. How is Forsburg an international also?!! He wouldn't make it higher than Semi-pro level over here in England.
Hope someone purposely brings on someone older than Ibra to take that “record” away from him, he’s such a prick
All tap-ins 😂😂😂
Remember when Lukaku & Zlatan were trying to have a fight on the pitch........Zlatan caught a bad one in this game though.....
great hat-trick from stormzy
Ah yes the European qualifications where already 40 procent of the teams got at least 2,3 black dudes.
best game football !!!
Belgium got some deadly wingers they bamboozling the Swedish defence 😂
3:02 "Lukaka"?
Was Sweden goal not a goal !!
Suprised wout faes didn't put the ball in his own net on the goal line clearance the amount of times he has scored own goals
Lucky day for Lukaku. He's so shit
Lukaku is one of the worst strikers you will ever see. Built like a brick shit house and gets bullied
Zlatan is an old fraud he needs to retire  Lakaka is an ugly piece of shit  Sweden is the land of rapists  Belgians are ugly and their country is a shithole and their team is overrated.   Eden Hazard’s bum is bigger than Belgium and Sweden combined.
after all the bad mouthing Zlatan has aimed at Lukaku i bet  Zlatan kept his mouyth shut after this
Bro got more goals today than at chelsea
4:02 The footwork from the winger to make the two players collide was filthy
Lakaka shushing people like he aint trash 😂😂
Good for Lukaku. He's been through alot lately. He needed this
Shame lukakau couldn't do it in the world cup when it mattered..
Ruling out that third goal would have been unforgivable 😭💀
wout faes 😟😟
Bakayoko what a debut
Very funny goals🤣🤣🤣
This is what we want to see from Antony!! Sweden right winger dircet and staight to the point. Lindeloff time is up at united, he's bang average as a defender
What a breathtaking and captivating display from Lukaku and Belgium. Hopefully, the euros will be the redemption story for Belgium and Romelu Lukaku 🇧🇪  🙌
Still doesn't make up for him being an absolute donkey in the WC, failed bigtime there so I dont see the need for the shush celebration he let the nation down.
Sweden must be gash if the donkey score’s
Chelsea bring him back
This is how to play Lukaku, just let him be in the box and he would get the job done, hope Potter can see it too. Btw who is this Bakayoko guy, he is a good winger....
Wow , great
Bakayoko on right wing looks a dangerous winger.
Can't really believe some of the people having a dig at Lukaku after he scored a hat-trick. His last game was against Croatia, where he had one of the most horrific performances that any top-level player has ever had. He's managed to get over that and got 3 goals that any striker lives for. His header was a beautiful touch and the third he did well to keep himself onside and slot it home calmly when Jack Grealish showed the night before what can happen if you lose your head.
We’re so shit we made Lakaka get a hatrick. Get this Janne out
Sweden mighty Viking defenders are looking indestructible.
Believe Lukaku will get inter Milan into the champions League final
I guess he had to be there to put them in. None of these goals were as a result of his influence maybe the header.
As long as trossard doesn’t get injured ❤️
That 3rd goal; those 2 defenders falling over themselves is shameful.
if only he did this at the world cup
Soo happy for Lukaku.
Lukaka
Luka has scored 71 goals for belgium kane has 54 😮 is Luka a better international footballer than kane I don't think so as a England fan it will be hard for us to win at the highest level there is so much quality in international football I feel as if we can compete but it will be very tough to win finals we as England fans should really start to understand until we have a world class 16 we will be waiting a while I don't think this current squad have it not this euros but the next world cup we will be ready
Come play for chelsea next year.
Belgium back to beating everyone until the tournament when it matters
Sweden 4-4-2 for about 80 years 😂, that pitch is huge you need legs and sweden didn’t have pace easy night for Belgium.
The assist for the third goal…. He left the defence for dead before bringing it in to assist Lukaku. 😊
I’m so happy Alex Isak is not injured. 🖤🤍 #NUFC
He was fantastic at world Cup also when we needed him. Flopped at man u flopped at Chelsea.
Our Africans are better than your Africans.
Well done Lukaku for single handed winning the world cup......oh wait he scored some tap ins against Sweden and thinks he is Maradona
De Bruyne just chilling, its like a sunday football game after church for him lol
Lukaku scored a hatrick because Zlatan allowed him to
Belgium's golden generation was no coincidence. Media announced Belgium's funeral too soon.   Guys like Lavia, Onana, Lukebakio, Bakayoko, Doku all seem ready to step up.
See Lukaku is great and he can be yours for only 50 million! (chelsea fan)
Lukaku is a wronged when it got hard at Chelsea he quit and went to a easier league.
forsberg got bullied
When they ask me to spell Legend I say Lukaku 😁
The 3rd goal was probably the worst case of ball watching I've ever seen
Those Belgian wingers were causing mayhem in Sweden’s defence 😅  Congratulations to Lukaku, looks in great shape
HAPPY for Zlatan But Dammmnnn Lukaku Getting A Hat Trick Against you is an embarrassment lol
Lukaku is hit or miss. I just cant hate him though
Nah who was playing right wing 🤣🤣🤣
Just don't let Isak get hurt please Sweden.....
When he plays well he is actually world class he is just really shit sometimes
Good to see zlatan back in action is work ethic is fantastic and well done to lukaku for the hat trick
More goals than touches for Lukaku
Stop the video at 4:17
When Lukako does that to you, then you have serious sorting out to do!
Zlatan won’t like that, him and Lukaku were beefing at one point. Letting him score a hat trick on his head
so Sweden are out for euros? im a bit confused with this
Zlatan = "the past, present and the future" 😂🇸🇪
Well done Belgium and Lukaku, top notch scoring.
Aston Villa - 2 International Goalkeepers...
Do Sweden think they are a top side, that could take this Belgium side???? even at 41 surely you’d start Ibrahimović for the best possible chance!???? 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Lukebakio looks really promising in this highlight
Who is the right winger player?
I’d be slightly ashamed to over celebrate that hat trick if I was in his shoes and I have no legs.
When I saw that lukuku had scored a 3, I knew they'd be terrible goals.
Perfect hat trick left right and header
What a shit hattrick for that insecure player, now he's gonna get a ego boost again.
I will still go on record saying zlatan would still make the England squad at this age.
Don’t show the highlights to Inter.
I really like lindelof, however this shows he isn’t a Utd starter. Either he accepts a back up or moves on to someone like Spurs
Ronaldo shitty hattrick against Liechtenstein: wooooow goat  lukaku hat trick against Sweden: bum nigga
The most gifted hatrick ever 😂
wtf is viaplay
Lindelöf masterclass.
To bad he can't do this in the world cup😅
Bah. He was USELESS at Chelsea.
Zlatan makes history as what?
Remix to Rashford celebration 😂
