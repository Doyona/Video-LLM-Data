why is there still barely any crowd are there restrictions
Why is this in Riyadh? How utterly pointless. No thanks.
Martinez will be Barcelona main target next transfer window mark my word source trust me bro
Dzeko rule-breaker in FIFA is to me the best ST for  a seria A team. I have him and have 357 goals with him in 372 matches
Used to be a good classic 20 years ago
this final should had been played in Italia.
if you *B* go to the *I* not so popular *T* sites that tell the *C* real truth and *H* not the b.s. the *U* media tells you *T* you will discover *E* that these athletes who are in perfect health are dropping dead, go to the site mentioned throughout this comment in all caps
Had lautaro played like this in the world cup...
L A U T A R O ❗️❗️❗️🥃🥃🥃🥃🎻🎻🎻 🏆
Madrid!!
World cup 2026 be like........ I'm fidna go upside yo damn head with a little bit more of the other only thing that each one on you was thinking,  but wouldn't say.... that is because we all look to our own personal struggle to revert to a state of certain gratitude for all people who don't ever say there will never be another. And why?? Football will always bring together fans of any of the players that should go back to another one for universal gain for the TEAM!! I wonder why?
dzeko is so class
Amala🖤💙🇮🇹⚽️🏆⭐️
3 quality goals.
Bravo Andre Onana!!👏👏👏🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲

Congratulations Onana. You are the best.
Pioli needs to go
Farmers cup.
Goal of The Day? #1 - Lautaro Martinez / Inter vs Milan or #2 Gnonto / Leeds vs Cardiff  #Italy #SerieA #FACup #England
Inter Milan and Manchester City are terrific teams this season.
This announcer have to literally scream when there’s a goal/chance? It scares my whole family if the volume isn’t way down. It’s like a room shaking scream every time
Lautaro made it look easy and last month he almost gave me a freaking  heart ❤️ attack he was playing against Argentina 😅😅😊😊

Let’s goo now my card finna get upgraded
I remember in the beginning of the season people were saying Lukaku was better then Dzeko you can't even compare them haha. Hopefully Dzeko takes Bosnia to the Euros now 🇧🇦
Great job by Inter they stepped all over AC MILAN, and I love it. Both clubs need to look into hiring Tuchel and see who gets him. 👏👏 Congrats to Internazional for the great victory 👏👏
Terrible time for Tomori
MARTINEZ, GOLAZO!!!!
Leao has to GO!!! he is no passing the ball to team mates is bad for business.
INTER !!! 🔵⚫
One more time....."PIOLI IS ON FIRE" HAHAHAHHA😂😂😂
Hakan Calhanoglu Is so Underrated
Tomori should definitely not be playing football. There was no effort/passion in his game today. Rafa Leao is a selfish player as usual and it's obvious that selfish players can't survive modern-day football. I don't know why the media hypes him so much though.
Win or lose, Milan belongs to the black and blues 🔵⚫️🔵⚫️🔵🐍🐍🐍🇮🇹🏆🏆🏆🏆 FORZA INTER!!
Tomori got slapped by Inter for 90 min straight 😬
Why did they play this in Rome? Would have been much better in front of a packed San Siro  Still, amazing to see Dzeko on fire, even at his age!
pyro is beautiful
The tomori hate is crazy
There goes my Origi showdown upgrade. If you know you know.
FORZA INTER!!!!
“And the ball rolls in the desert 🏜️ “ 😂😂😂 the commentator is a fraud
Dzeko is like a fine bottle of wine, he keeps getting better as he ages! Last year he was great for Inter as well, they just need to make sure they rest him because he can't play like this week in week out. Mark my words: if he's fit, Dzeko can be the most decisive factor in Inter's match up with Porto in the Champions League
Leao is annoying
Lautaro used that Fifa 23 finish😂. Great game from Inter
Omg tomori smh
nerazzurri > rossoneri
#17 Milan was too selfish, never passed the ball to teammates
Origi still better
Milan are in shambles right now. Management is to blame. They keep letting starters leave for free and not replacing them with equal value. Everyone is now seeing how much this team misses Kessie.  Tonali is not on that level. Their pressing is weaker, defense a mess.  And offensively they have no ideas.  Everyone just shooting the ball from 20 yards out and a mile over the goal.
Not really looking up for Tottenham match tbh
Why is the Middle East getting all these football finals recently?? They must have paid a lot..
Tomori = 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
That was exquisite by Lautaro!
I miss Maignan 😢
Asi es es un super delantero solo por q es bosnio no tiene Los reflectores q semerese. Vamos edin zko
Leah wasted all Milan’s chances 😅
❤❤INTER❤❤. MILANO È SOLO INTER.   E BASTA!
Tomori had a shocker
Lautaro is a quality quality player who had an unlucky World Cup where he got into his own head. Glad to see that he’s moved past it
COSI RAGAZZIIIIIIII !!!
ight but where was that in the world cup? 🙄🤣💙
Inter 💪🏾👍👍👍
I think Leao needs to leave this summer from Serie A.
Leao fully deserved substitution after at least 3 if not 4 atrociously selfish decisions in attack... One can be excused due to the inherited nature of all strikers to have a go, two is getting a bit irritating but 4?! Common now...
Well there goes the origi upgrade
Rip origi upgrade
Nice fireworks
rip my showdown origi :/
Quaresma would be proud of Lautaro for that goal!
Pioli grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr😴😴😴
@CBS Sports Golazo Have a question why is the video quality not very clear as compared to the seria A youtube channel
Ooooooo Edin Dzekoooooo
Is this a real live game?
Lautaro taking some notes from Victor Osimhen.  Great gol.
Why weren’t they playing in San siro
Has Leao ever actually passed a ball?
What the hell is wrong with ac Milan???!!!!!
I've ever seen weebs like AC Milan
L inter e la squadra piu' forte d europa !!!!! se gira un pizzico di fortuna puo vincere tranquillamente la champions !!!!! FORZA INTER SEMPRE !!!!!!!!! AMALA !!!!🖤💙🖤💙🖤
He wasn’t smiling 😮 3:58
if only this game was in the san siro
Two games in a row were Milan defense is not at par. Relying too much on Leao upfront..
Zanetti, legend!
This ac Milan team did not treat this game professionally
Martinez is suddenly on a hot streak after a poor individual World Cup!! Maybe that motivated him to do better!!
Milan is Blue
Edin Džeko is one of the most underrated strikers of this generation 🇧🇦 what a player!!
Tomori chose a terrible time to have an off day 💀
No more 88 origi
Sit down AC Milan, little brother. Let Inter celebrate. Milan is pained Blue baby!
Dzeko like fine wine 😊🍷
Phenomenal goal by  Martinez!
Why does the play by play man scream the shooter's name every time? Christ, it's annoying.
Dijamantuuuuuuuuuuu 🇧🇦🇧🇦🇧🇦🇧🇦
does r leao knows how to pass?
R. Leao is the most selfish player I have ever seen! He has zero team play. Always him. What a POS!
Tomori was awful
WTF !!! Over fifty percent of the telecast was showing each and every  foul at least twice and then showing every freaking player that got substituted SLOWLY trotting off the field and hi fiving everyone then putting on his jacket. There must have been less than 25 percent of the video that showed actual play. Once again WTF
What if inter wins champions league?
Milán needs a Mexican player
Thats why we Inter Milan baby 🙏 🔵⚫️
Forza Inter!!!! 🖤💙
Milan is blue💙💙
ACMilan >>>>>>
Dzeko next level Every year he puts another striker on the bench. Negredo, balotelli, tevez, Patrick shick, Lukaku, correra
I knew I should've have done Mkhitaryan
Tata for God's sake man Milan needs a new backup urgently
Bro I wanted my origi card to get upgraded
first
Forza Inter! First to comment
