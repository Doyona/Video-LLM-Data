OK I’m going in Minecraft and going to the end but in creative I’ve never been able to get to the end before.

This is my favourite Ep so far love it 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Nah why I want to do this find this slash have Minecraft 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Cant believe lizzie fell out the end last time
“So I began to build with these rainbow crystals!💖🌈  Me: *FLABERIGHT🍄💙🤍*
I'm so sad that the end biom doesn't look like this 😭
I miss Humie :(

I love how much Lizzie tries to embody the roles she’s given, the raccoon was so mischievous but she does it so well and so smoothly I didn’t notice until the role change? I’m just happy to be along for the ride tbh
Like that place would be beautiful to live in just ignore the pumpkin head needed but it would be amazing
The fact that it doesn't turn Day in the end.
Someone tell me what mod is used for the end
Re-watching this made me realize Lizzie is crazy for living in an ocean in empires 1 but it's more crazy that she lived at the end
CUTE 😍 ☺☺☺😊😊😊
Id never leave if my end had biomes like that
How can I play afterlife
Sub to golden_finch
I STILL CANT BELIEVE THATS HOW U DIED OMG
You can’t lie she is so good

We need these End biomes in Vanilla Minecraft
Lizzie how do you get those plant at the end i tried but there were no plants is that a mod
OMG where does she get the inspo?
*Le gasp* there’s no chickens in the end! *throws egg* *there are still no chickens in the end :’/*

Evil racoon that steals garbage into a Florin that needs to stay in the sun but stays in another dimension where the sun doesnt exist.
LD: if you’re gonna have an Epiphany do it elsewhere  Me:🤭😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😵
End entrance more like endtrance like entrancing I know this series is over but would have been a banger name
What mod are you using in the end it's beautiful!
Maybe if she had an Electra she could get around a lot better and could continue living like that
How and how to play after life
Can I join it looks fun
4:49 Joey in the chat tho🤣🤣
You can have a party 🎉
Omg wich mod is the end plants? I need them
the grand END-trance!!
When weebs hear a old anime opening: 13:41
I HAVE to know what mod you guys used
On episode three it was so sad that she fell I loved her being a raccoon Because raccoons on my favorite animal I wanted her as a pet she was too cute
Restarting count… day 1 of rewatching as many videos of Lizzie’s as I can until she posts again
the “ weee “ when she fell off is amazing.
5:17 how did you get it to look so cute! What's the mod/texture Pack name!!!!
omg the end looks so pretty! 😭💖
Katherine was also a floran
the red end biome with the tentacles remind me of Xornoth from empires s1
😂😂😂😂😂
😂
I hope mojang adds this end things in the real game!!!!
When you wanted to see the bees I don't think they wanted to see you so they weren't back in their Nest
It’s starts as a new life then it goes to the end floren it sounds like she died 🤣
Yea❤
Shill is a short enderman
Can someone tell me ow I can get to this end? Where Lizzie got the achievements “remote getaway” and if I can? I beg someone tell me

I am fan
^^Lizzie, let me tell you that your my childhood! I've loved you for so long! You and Joel are so funny, and my fav series was 101 dalmations
WOW 😱💗💯🤩👍🏻🌈🌳
Have you seen the Youtube Game On commercials? one of them as a brief shot of the greenhouse (pinkhouse?) I don't know why but that really stuck out to me. Like all the other clips are gamers laughing or action games and then there is a fraction of a second long snip of the greenhouse, i think it might have been 6:53
I was loling so hard when she said  “OH MY GOD I LOOKED AT ENDERMAN” and oli did nothing
I'm new to Minecraft so are you using a mod to get all the end flowers?
How did you get that portal to there I'm new..
Weeeee really got me 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂
I think u made a mistake
“There are no chickens in the end” throws egg and nothing hatches “there are still no chickens in the end”
I know im very late to mention this but i was just rewatching lizzie’s series and i noticed lizzie wore her floren outfit in x life! (Episode 21 time stamp 7:20)
i really want to get the mod pack they have
Its funny on how her friends were saying "no lizzie don't do it"but she did it anyway.
do you know what being like I forgot a name but being making flowers it's kind of good because hurting the environment is bad but creating more of the environment is kinda good and I love your outfit and I heard that the other flower person is has honey yes and your face it I see your future I can see your feet
I would absolutely love to see Katherine and Lizzie as Florian’s living together.
hi
that was so chaotic lmaoo 13:10 and then it cuts to oli yelling lmaooo
So this is strange oli shows up in the end with an egg, and he's an endarian . In Lauren episode, she becomes an end Adrian and follows this orb to the end. Weird.
Is the end thing a mod?
Question did you use a texture pack for the world if so can you comment it plz I love watching you videos they are so entertaining and fun
i just heard the enderman say ok
The end looks like space🪐
I love your ENDtrance
The fact that lizzie was literally ignoring all the CUTEE flowers  (Not a hate comment)   I wish u a great day
The end of fish
Never mind Katharine I’m living hare
Is this a mood?
She goes “look man if ur gonna have an Epiphany go do it elsewhere” 😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
14:51 AAAUUUOOHH 😰😰😰 AAOOHH😨😨
I hate how I keep seeing all these cute mods and i cant use them😞😞😞
I really wanted Lizzie to stay a raccoon
0:30 WEEE
Why did a stick fall from the sky?it’s at 4:12

I actually never realized how pretty the end is, is this a mod? Or just straight up minecraft
Is he ok XD?!?!
Don’t you mean… end-trance?
The part when she was trading flowers with Oliver, there was just an enderman staring at them curiously 😭
I love when they are hearing the song and oli got in front of lizzie and she's like : um excuse m-?
Is anyone going to talk about how the floran outfit Lizzie had looks really identical to the X-life “witch and the oven” skin that she killed jack in?
I love your videos 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖

To many places
Not me looking for those biomes for 3 hours and realizing it's a pack( or sum like that) 😭
Anyone re-watching her afterlife florin? Cuz u watched all her apisodes

I just realized that you can’t sleep at all again because you’re in the end
New “Leaf”

When Lizzie said Entrance, I said end-trance
Liz was in my dream last night
this actually makes the End look beautifull

Series idea: ~Axolotl craft~ (Its a series with your friends btw) Rules: Everyone gets 1 axolotl and if it dies, your series is over. You will have to hide your axolotl and attack other bases!   Side thing if ya wannna add it: Every episode a player is chosen. That player must take out another players axolotl or there own will be gone and the series OVERZ  (Sry for bad gramar)
I WAS SO UPSET. RIP RACOON!! 🙁🙁
BABY SHULKER
bruh the way she gasps was so funny 🤣
You should make bridges between the islands of the end and decorate each side of the bridge with the items from the island it leads to :)
Now that I think about it, most of her deaths are because her plans fail 🤔
No one:   Oli in the chat: yeeee
You have no idea how jealous I am after seeing the void- all I have is pocket edition and I'm not sure I can get the end mod and I'm so upset lol  Welp at least this gives me motivation to keep saving for a computer
oli: **having a main character moment** lizzie: that's enough-
Ldshadowlady=Evil just evil Joel=I dunno why I keep on believing her Stay safe
Lizzie: i have something perfect for you.  *AD PLAYS*
Lizzi look cute on his new fit
Do anyone know the packs name or were you get it? I neeeeed it! Please someone that know answer!

I just want to say in episode 2 there's actually you playing the pod a species called human they don't die to some kills them you're interesting interesting is this right now as us And as a nurse suggestion you read so you can read the comments
"Look man if you have option"
Here is a lizzie flower it supposes to live in the sun but living on honey is alright liv8ng in the end
The end rlly looks like a fairy forest at night :O now i dont know if I like the end better or the overworld :O if only the trees can be added in the game :(
Is there any phantoms orgins?
The stal is like the premiere stal (sorry for the spelling)
Hey Lizzie what’s the name of the mod you use to get all those flowers and plants in the End ?
You need to have more Rainbow colors on you. I love your new life & still sad you lost the old one. Good luck in this life. Hope it last.
It’s very spoopy
Girl, you're literally Isabella
I love ur vids I hope u stay alive
Are you Yemen you sond like her  xoxo I love this video pretty  biyom
Poor lizzy she died
The vanilla end looks empty now
You are awesome  very awesome I love your videos when you add detail  to your house with the leaves from the end well it's amazing very creative
Lizzie you are the best Youtuber I know you are like amazing amazing and you and me have a lot of common.😊
What texture packs are you using, Lizzy?
Sorry Lizzy I like raccoon life
It's sad that Lizzie's racoon life only last 3 episode 😭
Thats.  Funny
So what's the link for the better end mod
I love how everyone was so worried when she got to the end😆
missing the pure joy that was raccoon Lizzie but the scenery for Florian Lizzie is hard to beat
i feel like you should give tours of the end!
Lizzie: oooh it’s so pretty Also Lizzie: oops. I broke it
Oli: having a dramatic moment. Lizzie: “look man I’m just trying to vibe and your ruining it. Me: lol :*)
My advice is to stay ind the sun, what Lizzie does  goes to the end where the sun doesn’t exist. LOL!!! Like what happened did she forget that she had to stay in the sun.
What is the mod please do it in the link
The way the enderman went for lizzie🤣😂
what was the mod for the end biomes please i need
That ohhh yeaaaa was rlly funny 2:15
You are doing so good
Hi🦋
I LOVE YOUR videos
The was you died -
I feel like Joel(aka your husband) would love the red vine things
What about the raccoon build
You should make a bridge to every little biome in the end
Rip raccoon welcome forbidden love
I love how sausage  was hyping her up in the chat when she went to the end
If you look closely you see "Queen of the end"
If you haven’t already  The bees have strangely adapted to the end environment
She died in the end and she stays in the end
Omg the plants there are so cute!!!! If I wasn’t scared of endermen I would live in the end
How do you get the game mode
Poor thiing😂
WHERE DO I GET THIS MOD?!
Oh I really didn't know there can be 2 of the same origin (which makes sense now, but idk i didn't think of it earlier 😂)!! Thats actually very interesting
THE ENDING OF THIS VID WAS SO FUNNY ESP WHEN OLLIE CAME

Hi lizzie how did u make the end pretty? Is it a texture pack or a mod?
kathrine always ends up with plant roles and i love it
Did you use some mod for the end? Cuz I NEED IT!!! Please tell me :(
What mods do you use they look so cute!
Whats the mod to get the flower place in the underworld?
She looks enderman in the eyes multiple times without getting caught. Then, I remember she is wearing a pumpkin... That's a short attention span for you..
who is megan?
Can we just appreciate how creative Lizzie is<3
What shader does she use I’m so sad
Lizzie ur Isabella from Encanto 😉
Honestly I would love to be a Florin I love plants even though I don't own any I just love them they look so cool and pretty even Cacti! Man there are so many flowers and Plants I really love when I live on my own my house will probably be a giant indoor garden lol
I gasped when they all fell to their deaths
So far the only episode(that I have seen) in which lizzy didn’t die
I Like Your Video So Much
3 episodes and she died
I really wanna join you
Aldi shadow lady I really wanna join you and your videos and your friends it would be so grateful
The entertains should be named endtrain
I nether new how amazing the end was
you make my day
Lizzie just left the game😳
Can I please join you?!
If the end is like this beautiful 😍😍❤❤ I'll go there and never ever leave It's all so memorizing and my favourite colour schemes are exactly like yours
Lizzy, can you offer some of the end mushrooms to Megan? Maybe forge a peace? Because Megan is controller of all overworld mushrooms, which are basically underground flowers.
OMGG THE END PLANTS AND THE CRISTALS ARE SO COOL AND CUTE!! ❤️
“Shulk not scared shulk tough boy” I was about to cry because of the way he said it!
Omg this series is so good and interesting the biomes are beautiful wish my Minecraft looked like that❤😍🥰 -faithful LDshadowlady fan💕💓
Aaaa my Eyes The rainbow crystals  AR SOoOO BRITE
I LOVE YOU CEUT😘
Aww. I liked it more when there was Raccoon Lizzie.
Can you please tell me what you do to have all these mods and stuff?
Flower 💖
Love your channel
the end is actually so pretty, i wouldn't blame her for wanting to be there.
Hiii
love your videos😄
The end is soooo pretty 😍 I'm so glad you decided to live there
Like this
You should make cute and safe bridges from island to island
You should put glass blocks around the counter so the endermen can't attack. Also just leave like a block open so you can trade.
hahaha! when u were out of hunger and opened the door i thought the door hurt you!

Hi my name is Amelia
Love your videos!!!
She could describe it but she just didn’t want to for reasons reasons
I love your videos and Lauren's videos!
I KNOW YOU FROM LAURENZSIDE!!
Remember X life when she baked Jack in an oven. She wore an adorable dress when she did it and her floran dress is the same one.
When she went everyone was telling to not do it in chat
It is sad that she is no longer a raccoon… 😕
Are all the pretty plants a mod or is it in base game? I want them 😂 but I can't get mods
Scott in empires said that you decided to live in the ocean biome because you like to make things difficult for yourself, this has never rang more true
Oh... so that’s how Lizzie became a florian Also this episode gave me inspiration to build a bee sanctuary in my own world
i neeed a link to this mod pack (if there is one) pls pls pls can someone give me oneee
This is so sick
_yes amazing_
Hiii I just wanted to ask which Mc version does the server works for

The little "weee" when you fell lmfao
I love the end mode
Okay, does nobody else think Lizzie intentionally jumped off so she didn’t have to fight? She crouched and jumped off
Fact:Lizzie uploads a video another 7 days
I got vibes of Isabella from encanto when Lizzie went to the end-
One word only:CHAOS
Please do part six
Is it just me who has been here since 2016?
Is the ender men your villagers?
I really liked the raccoon life😢

Does anyone know what mods she's using? The End biome thingy looks super pretty!
Can you please name something Sammy
Joey and his baby shulk were so cute 🥰
You should call your End Entrance, the Endtrance!
I miss the lizzie raccoon 🥲
Your sort of like Isabella from encanto lol
That’s cute( the biome, the place) but why would you stay so far away? U would miss them 🥺
How do you enter the second ender portal?
Lizzie i want to ask how did you get that texture pack i really want it pls tell
I liked raccoon 😭
what shaders do you use?!
What mods do you have?
Whats the mod for the plants and biomes in the nether? thanks! <3
You should make a texture for the pumpkin so it matches your skin :)
I love this new origin!!!
The end plants are gorgeous  😄😊
You should live in that purple land with all the flowers u saw on the way looking for the end
Is there a mod or something to get this if so please tell me
All I can say is karma
So funny how she almost died again 😂😂
Where do I get this mod
We need this in normal Minecraft!
“Look man if your gonna have an epiphany can you go do it else where?” 💀-

12:24 'A- pleasure to make your A-cquaintance'  he literally adds highlights and makes the A's bold when he talks XD but i love that line itt gives sas
How about you name your shop end floran shop please it's a cute nama ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
No matter what profession she takes on, she makes it her own and makes it completely fun and loving to watch! This is why I've been following her for over 13 years! But to be fair.... Does anyone else like her as a racoon better?
HEAR ME OUT I HAVE A THEORY (cannon lore theory). When Lizzie fell into the void, her body was.. ya know, but the end sensed a spirit worth preserving, so it took her essence and used the life of the end to make her a vessel. It made her, literally,  of the end. She’s the voids chosen. (Ignore that she died in the next one and this theory is useless I have CLINGED to it for DAYS)
what mod is used for the tools T-T
ahh what mod do you use for the end I need it  n o w
Yay there's a new lizzie😁 in fack when you actual you do come to life just not you🤫
hi i love your vis so mach and i am 9 and my name is abigail but i go be abby ❤
I MISS U BEING A RACOON
what are all the mods you use?
Anyone know her updated pc specs? 2022 and also the mods in this?
The " endtrance "
You should make it so you put the music box in the floor and then just play it all the time!
the outfit lizzie is wearing is the same outfit she was wearing in X Life ep. 21 , Revenge
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Endtrance
Give head phone warnings
I wonder if Lizzie will try to find carving pumpkin mods, its like changing clothes for how you feel each day but with pumpkins!! It'll be funny to show emotions with AND maybe you can try carving flower designs into them:]
“And it also has these tentacles, which aren’t really my thing but I’m sure somebody else likes that” Ayo?😃😭😭
If i was makeing this i would be like the endtrence
the introooo- (before the actual intro the one where previously) I guess your Isabella now :)
BABY SHULK
*Now that you can read you can read the book that Lauren gave you*
Does anyone know what the end mod is? It’s super cute!!
Please tell me what mods you used for the end!
Baby griot meet baby shulk
I never knew that would go bad 😣
I love how the reactions in these episodes are so freakin genuine
"Look man if your gonna have an opinion can you go do it elsewhere." That cracked me up. Also where can I find this mod I neeeeeeeeeed it.
I NEED THIS WORLD
WHAT MOD IS THAT FOR THE ENDDDDD!?!?
Katherine has the same powers😄
Your skin looks so cute
Hi<3
Lizzie: I have a plan! Me: 🤦🏾‍♀️
I love how Joey stopped speaking just to admire the shulker head
Bro those biomes are freaking poggers!
When Lizzie put on her new floran skin, I was like: HmMm... I WONDER where that skin came from.. ToTaLLy NOt X Life as part of another one of Lizzie's devious schemes!
You should build a  bee hive for your house🐝
Lizzie : gasp did that hurt

If you wanted to make a really funny pun you could’ve said that your shop was blossoming
Lizzie be careful because of Scott k1lled 2 people! Those 2 people are MythicalSausage and Gem!!

My 10 year old daughter wanted to comment- “Wow your house/bee farm is so pretty you can never put to many flowers!” She wants to send you a letter and asked me to find out where she should  send it.
My 8 year old daughter is obsessed with LDShadowLady. She draws pictures of her pretty much every day. She wants to send some to her. I've been looking around and can't find a fanmail address. Anyone know if there is one or not? Or at least an email address?
I’m a little worried about Lizzie. She alway been good at uploading regularly.

Love the green house . and I think you should make a underground base witch you can use for experimenting on flowers
I know what Lizzie should do! She should write about them in a book! Like scrapbooking!
Lizzie! What mod do you use?
LDShadowLady someone is copying your vids and I thought it was ep 5 but it was ep 1 this person named LDShadowLady Minecraft is copying you so I think you should check that out
Ld I think you should change the entrance for the nether world when they get in the portal it’s fine but when they see the entrance they have to know that’s it a shop
Although this entire episode was magnificent, my favourite part was in the start when Lizzie went ‘wheeee’    Also this- Lizzie: There are no chickens in the end! *throws egg to hatch chimken* Lizzie: there are still no chickens in the end!
Ahh yes the queen of the end flowers herself ps I’ve been a shadow kinet for 5 years
PLS TELL WUT SHADEFRS U USE-
I'm so glad you decided to live in the end xD
I miss ldraccoonlady but ldendfloranlady is here to cheer me up
It would be so cool if there was a texture pack to make the pumpkin look pastel and cute and stuff
Neat thing you might want use around enderians in the end: There's a potion effect and enchant called "end veil." It allows you to stare at enderman without consequences. Not sure how you get the enchant or how it works around enderians but the potion is made using "end dust" on an awkward potion.
can you make more vids
What mods are they using!
That was the dress you wore to kill jack sucks in  x life in the oven
Ldshadowlady hi I have been a fan as long as shadow craft and I just wanted to say I love your videos I always have some thing to look forward to when you post thank you for making videos 😁

I love how when she enters the end the chat is just like  SHULK--NOO Lizzie don't do it  Sausage--I wouldn't blame you it's really pretty  SHULK--Queen of the end

Since you're a Floran whom lives in the end you should theme your skin as an end Floran to make you fit in! Also, you should make your bee/house thing end themed (just an idea I'm also a big fan of the channle)

This episode had a good ENDing
You should make an enderman farm and charge something per hour to use it
When will  lizzie upload the next origin ??
She's a Flor-end! 🤣🤣🤣

Umm lizze if you do minecraft ripoffs try multicraft it is multiplayer free and cool blocks  and mehcanices like homepoint  and protecter blocks to protect buildings...
Ldshadowlady i have been a fan of you for years and joel as well i always love ur vid's and you always make me smile love from the philipines
What if every time you make a friend that you trust you build a small island of what coused your trust. like  Kathrine, you would get some grass blocks and make a island and on top you would put her bee farm that looks like a bottle!
*Sees the End mushroom biome*  Me: I WANT THAT MOD NOW 😭😭😭

"Look buddy If your gonna have an episode can you do it somewhere else" 💀✋
Well Lizzy is literally my whole childhood...I started watching her when it was 2015 I think I'm not sure and I have watched every server and my faves are crazy craft SMP,last life SMP, Empires SMP,Base invaders and some other she is my childhood and I'm still a fan since she is funny and kind and somehow finds a way to make me smile every time I just wanted to say Thank you Lizzy💖💖
I love the plants
You can change carved pumpkins texture by botonists bench
It's the stuff the people said in chat when Lizzie got into the end- it got of me off guard and made me laugh heh-

"There are no chickens in the end. There are still no chickens in the end"
We need these to be longer than we 15 mins!!!

Awesome videos. Also I have been a huge fan if you since mid 2021❤❤ and  have watched almost 220 videos made by you! Keep all the hard work up. I also have a YouTube channel. The name is my username here. It has only 64 subscribers :(  Also I have taken quizzes about you and I have done then pretty well. You might be impressed of me. I have been knowing you and subscribed to you since mid 2021 and also I have been subscribed to SmallishBeans from mid end 2021. Can you and we make this the most liked comment? Once again, both of you keep up your hard work. Hope Mery and Buddy are also doing well.

At first I was kind of disappointed that there were two florans on the server and I wanted something more original. But nvm! I love how Lizzie went for something different than katherine :>
Make knew Vidyos plssssss i cant fand a new vids plssssss
Can you post another afterlife video?
trash-collecting enigmatic raccoon that entraps villager gem (perhaps the funniest thing I've ever seen happen in minecraft) to causing chaos that potentially could kill everyone on the server (iconic) to dead from same said chaos (perfect resolution to a perfect story) to business floran in the end (did NOT see that coming)  if you only watch one afterlife perspective, (I don't know why you would, they're all great, but) you can't miss with liz
Lol I don't who but it cracked me up when someone went AAAAHHHHHH OH MY GOOOOODD in the beginning
Just asking… do you know where I can get these mods?
you could make your dress end themed to match! add the cool end vines and make the flowers on your dress end flowers!
Lizzie, you rerolled. I saw in Scott's video! What did you get at first?
Is it just me or am I already re-watching this series
Ya know, lizzie and joel need a series that is kinda of like a " loop " where they rp and threw out the ' years ' they come and meet each other again and again,always in a different scenario  but like soulmate style, and tgey can ro and all that to
Ldshadowlady/lizzy when are you going to post another video I really want to another one on after I could you ever start a new series

i with the biomes in the end were real that would be awesome! (ID TAKE EVERYTHING!)id wipe out the end CLEAN!
I loved this episode so much I’ve watched like 20 times miss the raccoon but love the new one. You are an amazing YouTuber should have 20 million subs! If I become a YouTuber you would be a role model
Make a fish tank for your End Fish!!!I just LOVE her videos!!!🐟

The whole time you were collecting, I was fan-girling over the flora in the end

I love how kathren is happy that lizzie is another floren but if that happend to say joey he would be like " THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE SHULK" and kill her
What about humy

Hi Are you going to make a song in afterlife like the song you and Scott did Deal with Destiny in empires?
MAKE MORE EPS PLS MORE!!!!!!!
Lizzie you make me smile when I’m sad , you make me happy and you make me laugh your really kind and caring  and Kawaii
Lizzie should do an end floran outfit I think that would be so cute!! It would match the theme
“Wee”
Cool
Lizzie something you should have on hand as a floren is potions of fire resistance
The end is called the end because it ENDS some, some ok players lives I think so you might die in your home!
Your twinning with katherine now!
Lizzy i Redmond add a tester to your pumkin you 'll look so cute ! Love you're videos
Lizzie you are becoming so childish and a five year-old can tell that you jumped of on purpose
Lizzi
11:26 missed opportunity for a pun, you could've said "to end-tice them!" I've been watching too much SmallishBeans I think...
Lizzie! You should do redstone or something to signal if anyone wants to trade for flowers !
you should call the shop, : The Ender Garden
omg what mod is that i need it
Lmao I love how the villagers are forever locked away in the mountainside house
You should make some kind of bridge between the islands, maybe you could make them based off the theme of the biomes
Ldshadowlady can you do series were you live in your dimension ? If you don't know what I'm talking about .It called Making a custom Ldshadowlady dimension.
There are no chickens in the end  * throws egg*  There are still no chickens in the end
They need to update the end like that I will be so happy with this update (I don't  think  my pc will like that)
you should build a research centre in the end to show off and research all of the plants :)
i love the end vibe
From your flower mod
Or you should make a mod of end flowers
You should decorate your house with flowers for you flower mods
Hey you should name tag your bees 🐝
The little dance is ironic.
Make shere to carry a alytra on you and some fireworks so that if you fall into the void you can save yourself
wow its still amazes me that you managed to not kill Oli in his first episode
You should definitely make some safer bridges to your house and some resting spots so people can visit you and have safe places to hide if they look at an enderman. (You could also add a train track so people can get to your place faster)
wait what about humie your just going to leave him in the old house dont do that to him who gave you book shelfs humie did you gave you emerelds for the book shelfs humie did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lizzie your isabella from encanto
mooooooooooore ldshadowlady
Pls do part 5
Just like Katherine
Spool #5
Would anyone happen to know the mod pack Lizzie's using for research purposes?
The end reminds me of something... Oh right. *F L A V O L I T E*
Hey lizzy you live in the end and joel here's real world is the netherworld so why do u build a house or a place for joel in the end and joel build u a place in the netherworld that would be so cool!
when are you gonna post ep 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don’t understand how creative people are with content and just in Minecraft in general…
Maybe you should build safer and better bridges. Because every time you run and jump on those one block lines to get to the next inland, I almost get a heart attack
Maybe make some sort of mushroom house or like one of the plants in the end as a home
yout geg ant mincecrekt lisy
end fish
There are no chickens in the end *throws egg* there are still no chickens in the end lol I also love when she said “Look man if you are gonna have a opinion go do it somewhere else” lolz her videos always make my day
Lizzie should buy a whispering gourd from Scott and wear it. They are purple pumpkins!!
I miss rocon lizzei😥😞
PLEASE DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT MODS SHES USING FOR THW ABILITIES AND RHE END PLANTS
Ldshadowlady I wonder how popularmoms is doing it’s because you haven’t seen him in a long time
I just wanted to say Lizzie that your awesome videos always make me smile, I think that each one of your videos are unique and special and have entertained me for years. Thank you for making these epic videos and I am excited to see all the other awesome video that you will make next.
Dude I used to watch Lizzie and Laurenzside all the time, you could not stop me  lol. And I saw that you guys where doing a Minecraft server again and it brought me back to the crazy craft days. I’m really happy your still posting as I’m enjoying this the same way I was when I was in 4th grade. I know you won’t see this but still. Thank you. You where the person that I thought of, when I thought of people who got famous and it never went to their head, and they stuck to their morals. I’m pretty sure every kid that grew up with Minecraft has at least one appearance of you stuck in their head.
Isabella who
Wait is there two florens?????
its an ENDtrance muahaha
Bruh me and my dirty mind
Ldshadowlady used the same skin in X life to kill JackSuksAtMC
This is amazing, an End Florian, wow. oh! I know something you need! Scott has blue pumpkins, I think they would match a lot better then the normal pumpkin
your floral skin is lovly
IM CALLING IT-  shes dying to an enderman
Hi lizzy!! Im a big fan of you and I wonder, in your season kingdomcraft what texture pack did you use? I wish you saw this :D
Thank you Lizzie I’m sick today and your videos make me so happy! I love you keep up the hard work
Katherine:Flower girl Lizzie:Business flower girl
Maybe raid end cities to get gold iron etc and ask for other things for shop
Not a fan of you any more "oh my goshshshhshshshsh
Haha good for you because are a killer of find away ta climb 🤣 that is not a funny jok
Lizzie why are you so evil in xlife to starwberry when she fell to her death and said that it was not that stinking beans, your boyfriend who did it .He was the one why didn't put a bucket of water there
I didn't know that you were bisexual lizze
I just love this series!
I Love the way she talks 😊
I love the way we’re only 4 episodes in and Lizzie has already caused mass chaos 😂😂
i love how if she has to get anything from the nethier but dont want to go their she just asks joel and he happily does as she tolds
i miss racoon lizzie
Can you please get a pet
You should absolutely make a base in that crashed ship, it would be so mysterious!
lizzie, Yall shall build a shop to the overworld to! And there cost diamonds and some are cost neitherite 😏 like.. the ones are the neitherite bc... there some hard to obtain maybe☺️
You should set up customs on the main island.
Please make an official music video for deal with destiny and we don’t talk about xornoth! I haven’t got over empires :(
Lizzy  Episode 5 plz
Hey Lizzie! You should add bridges to connect some of the islands im sure that would be a cute idea.
I'm getting that one barbie fairytopia vibes from the wnd and I absolutely love it
Lizzie surely you build a house up in the super tall flowe
what’s the mods name? :)
The end is so cute. I cant get over it.
You should also try and make like really cute bridges connecting the islands. Super cute.
Yay love how this is turning out. End adventures yay.
Please link of mods
hi Lizzie i really like After life but when is season 2 empires going to come
You should try putting a bridge to each island so that it's easier to get more flowers and maybe put a base at each one ! :) I hope you think of doing my suggestion !
What shader do you use? it looks so nice
I love the way she says `I want one`
!LIZIE! SCOTT IS ALSO SELLING END-FLOWERS! HE ALREADY SOLD SOME TO PEOPLE! HE’S STEALING UR COSTUMERS!          He actually did think of it first so maybe ur stealing his costumers .. BUT STILL
Hello, does anyone know the mod name of the thing she uses when she sells items? Like this little box she has been using in almost all her series? I need it lol
Omg so cuteeeeeee the flowersss
If there's a unicorn or magical animal option in Afterlife SMP, I wish Lizzie has one of that. It would be supercool. Also, maybe you could get a mod that makes your bees, like, blend in with the End and you could build a hydroponic farm for your plants? So if you meet mobs spawning in the End (mostly Endermen) you can jump into the water and deal 2 more damage. Also your plants wouldn't suffer (expect maybe the bees, cause they'll drown).
I am Five years old
i wanna join the smp.
My name is Anushree
I find it funny that Lizzie jumped off of the end platform on purpose   I’m excited to see more of the end!! :]
I love when she was like what now so annoyed it was so funny and when she said there are no chickens in the end there are still no chickens in the end 🤣 lol
Idshlolady i like your voice mail
Wheress ep 5
I love this Lizzie!! this was amazing!! I'm getting this mod and you have given me a tour and I can't wait!! ❤
I don’t like it when Lizzie just leaves all her precious stuff and just hfhfhrnudhfnjffnsjnfjdjdjfhdfhj
Those flowers are pretty!
Why did u reroll? I know you did because I saw in chat of Scott’s vid. If u want to re roll it’s okay but u could have told us
Ousum
Can you make a pond near your house?💞💕 It's kinda cute to add a pond and put the end fish in it and decorate it with pinks stuff, I hope you like my idea... Becuase when you add a pond it's kinda Cute! soo make it near your house.  And decorate the enter of the end in the overworld so it's not a wood anymore the THEME IS THE END...
Build a end hotel so poos can stay at end with u
Ldflowerlady
you should wear a flower crownn !! :D
Your flower market is absolutely blooming!
who else remember this skin on Xlife?
What is the mod I want to be a raccoon
maybe decorate your portal to the end with flowers and put a sign and stairs so it is prettier and more FlOrAnY
Your build always amaze me :,) I could never do those
Lizzie you should make bridges so you don’t fall! :D
yay 😃
are there flower crowns in the mod? that'd be really cool if you wore one, especially if it's end-themed. c:
im jasonr, i dislike video
Lizzie is challenging herself, like when she decided to make an Empire in the Ocean.
where's ep 5 😭😭
That greenhouse, is BEAUTIFUL! 🌸
I always like your videos noooo I don't like your Vida I love your vodios
What is the mode
Endtrance get it??
So pretty and so cute I love your videos
Lizzie: Here is the new end entrance  Me: End entrance, huh. Wait! End-trance!
Where lizzie build her green house, it reminds me of Pandora from Avatar
You should maybe make the bridges between your islands look nicer!
Lizzie! You should edit the pumpkin head to look like a helmet of sorts. Kind of like how you made custom armor in Empires. <3
we need the bath house back D:
Lizzie should make a end shop
What shade packs do you use? Also is it available on mobile?
The End is literally gorgeous in this mod
omg u should totally build a giant house out of that pink wood and put alot of flowers in it next to your green house so u have a house and put a flower thrown.
You should make a flower garden  and a zen garden 🌸🌷🌺💐🌹
You should have a barrel of pumpkins at the entrance
The staircase she built reminds me of the one I made in the SMP I am in
You need a mod of stacking your honey jars ,so you can have 64 honey and not 16.      Am I right or am I right 💁🏻‍♀️😙
Can you be next to “Mr.HOT men”aka Joel????
7:03 right after she mines dirt with her pickaxe I see a shovel in her inventory
💖Ollie: " you have brought beauty back to my life"💖
Hahaha lol the weeee is so funny LOL 😂
OMG it was soo funny when Shadowlady played GRASPING AT THE STARS and ollie said" I see wow" and he was so dramatic Lol XD
The mods used to change the end. Are they exclusive to the Afterlife server or are they available as a mod pack to everyone?
You made my day my tablet just broke and I’m sad now
LD Shadow lady Can you please  Show me what resource packs did you use for this video? Plz🥺
how do you make these servers with all your friends?
Can't wait for next video
I miss base invaders
Lizzie you should make a flower texture for the pumpkin
I love how Katherine was queen of the overgrown in Empires and then she became the first Floran of afterlife.
Ok, Idk if I'm stupid or what (because I don't play Minecraft) but are those end biomes a mod or an update!!???
Hi lizzie can i join in your server plsss
In return I would like-  SO YOU BOUGHT A GUITAR
I’m exited for hopefully the new season of Empires?
:}
Hello I am 13
Lol
You should change the color of your pumpkin
You should re-texture the carved pumpkin to something End Florian approveable
LD is cross contaminating biomes with invasive species.
You can make a little beehive House  for your bees all all of your bees in there
You should put the floating lanterns around the shop
Lizze you should make like a really cool path to you house!
What’s the name of the mod you used for the End?
Such cool plants! What a lovely (and adventurous) start =)
An idea is making an island floating in the end and collecting overworld animals and placing them on the islands and cover the islands with flowers depending on the color of the animal! For example, you can use white flowers for an island with chickens!
True shadow cadets know we love Lizzie because of how dramatic and how creative she is
Post q number 5 pls
You are now isabela from Encanto with flowers
“You are not the RAT-COON I once knew!” -Oliver
you should try and get a mod on the server that makes carved punkies invisible
Izzy your videos are the best
Is your real name Elizabeth or Lizzie
Treeussy
Oli in the end being like "this is my homeland" and then acting like a tourist is so relateable
You should make a garden with pets to guard you
The “weeee” as you fell of the edge was hilarious 😂
This is the best video in the series!
you should get a botanist bench and make the pumpkin head way cuter. Or go to scott for a purple pumpkin. :) love you lizzie
Hey! I randomly remembered one of your videos 7 years ago (this is not my first YouTube account I forgot my others), just wanted to say thanks for being apart of my childhood! I remember the elf clean-up video and its pretty funny, thanks for everything! Much love.
The saddest words “But that’s it for this episode of afterlife” 😔😔😔😔
Pus if you ceep the pumcin hed on it's prity safe
What mod has those biomes please tell me I want to know please
You should make a farm or get some kind of pet please Lizzie
Post more!!!
Wait lizzy hear me out okay, Let someone life like Katherine with you so you could do some stuff like start a farm but I think that would be an great idea and maybe u will do that ❤💗
Can you make an enderman statue by your house holding a end flower 🌸
your new Origin is so cool!!!! ( btw what's the name of the mod were the spawn and the homes are marked with a letter?)
Poor humie is all alone
LDPlantLady
DAMN IT THE EP IS OVER I CANT WAIT TILL NEXT WEEK THIS SERIES IS TO GOOD 11:26 btw u missed a joke opportunity "ENDTICE them"

Does anyone know what mod pack they are using to add all of those adorable plants?!? I feel like this one w/ Lizzie's flower breeding mod would be AMAZING!!
I’m soooo glad u are a florist! I love flowers and your greenhouse is just like shubbles! You picked the best colors and designs for everything! Keep up the amazing work!
The rainbow pink nether screams Lizzie <3
Hey Lizzie can you give me the mod or how you and your friends did this it’s really cool and I love it and the plants
The grasping stars are nice
AHH I LOVED YOUR RACOON HOUSE BUT THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER-
What’s the mod pack ldshadowlady is using?
8:37 pqvdkqvwja my dirty mind couldn't handle this part-
13:12 ICONICCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
You should build a animal pen (ask Katherine for normal over world animals)
Hey lizzie. You should ask for some workbench. You can carve the pumpkin and put it in one of the workbenches and have a different coloured Pumpkin. :D
4:53 Oli in the other world:
I watched the  Enderman tragedy like 10 times already 🤣🤣🤣
I was so sad that Lizzie lost her origin. I was so sad it happened because it was a great one and I was scared she would get a bad one. But luckily she got a flower one my life is saved!
Ok the flowers were super nice,cute,pretty and  cool and I’m not trying to say there not but why I’m I not really thinking about that and thinking about Huymy. What happened to him!?!?
You should make an end flower garden
I really hope you fix the single block wide bridges, they stress me out lol
it took so long for you to post I was waiting forever
Where can i download this from
The end reminds me of pandora from avatar
JUST TELL EVERYONE ON THE SERVER THAT YOU OWN THE END PLZZZZZ ITS SO PRETTY!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oli
The oil part made me laugh
I love these videos they always brighten up my day ! :) also does anyone know what mod or mods that are like this ! i really want to live in the end !
😁😁🤗
Can you join Hermitcraft
I ❤ it
Lizzie, you should redesign the shack (elevator?) where the portal is to match your theme!!
Lizzie had the chance to say “my business is already blooming” at the end 😂😂😂
we need a end update in minecraft, this looks so cool
AHHHH LIZZIE Get a florian table and customize the carved pumpkin (it doesn’t really go with ur outfit atm)
Other mod : extra organ
Hold on- she has the same one as Katherine-- O_o HEADCANNON TIMEEEEE
I loooove the plants in the end and can we all be grateful that she makes video’s
Lizzie: I have something that is perfect for yo-THE BOLD FLAVOUR INTENSITY OF DORITOZ!!!
Group*
are all of the people in the minecraft worlds you make like katherine, and all of the others your friends? and also, how did you all get together in the minecraft world? and can other people join your groug even if you dont know them?
Mod:better end
For the people, who wanted Lizzie dancing: 2:10
Hey what mods and packs are you using?
Can't wait for the next episode 😁😁😁
It kills me how the end is so pretty and the end in normal minecraft is pretty plain tbh
5:01 how did you do that I want to go to the end and i need a pumpkin but it covers half of my screen
This episode was so wholesome and funny
You could upgrade the end portal entrance like what you did to the end gateway thing, and yah. Maybe you could also add like some “tourist thing” that you could show others..☺️☺️☺️
What is that mode in the end called
Lizzie could u make cute bridges to each island also what mod is this?
I love how Lizzie and shubble both have geenhouses but they’re complete opposite vibes.   Shubbles greenhouse: 🖤🥀🍂🔮 Lizzies greenhouse: 💗🌄💐🧚🏻‍♀️
5:30 since when is the end that pretty?
You could finally find out what Lauren's book said 😏
i feel like lizzie isnt gonna die in the end, but the overworld
I think Lizzie would die from: Endermen, players, a trip to the over world, her own origin, or falling in the void...🌸
you should do like a texture pack for the pumpkin so it looks like a flower tiara or something! it would be so cute! Love the vid and your new life!
Go to the nether for some plants, there are a ton.
That combat logging was CLUTCH I am really impressed with your end building! So pretty and a great idea to not step on your fellow floran's roots!
lizzie in ep.1: i never want to die  also lizzie in ep.3: falls of into the void    lizzie again in ep. 4: goes to the were she can die
Aw I miss raccoon Lizzie
How do you get all your stuff
Definitely ask Joel to move into end I think he would fit in perfectly with his origin
🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄
I would love to see a smp that was different era, every different player had a different era in time i think that would be cool.
Why do I feel like everybody's origin represents there personality like Lizzy is a sneaky type person first than she's a sweat lady like a flower and of course Joel is 'hot'.
Lizzie said goodbye to trash and hello to honey
I was just watching solitary’s newest episode and at the bottom it says Lizzie rerolled !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You die ha that’s funny 😂
Here's a idea :you could make a unique bridge to every island because nothing is ugly on your watch
I love the biomass in the end if you can you send a invite to me so i can join you'r wold.
Fun Fact: Minecraft bees' favourite flower are the dandelions.
The end biomes are so pretty! So many fun and colorful types of blocks and plants
Kathrine would love it in the end 💐🌹🥀🌺🌷🌸💮🏵️🌻🌼
When You saw that fish I was like "ITS THE FISH FROM SUBNAUTICA!"
Lizzie I love your videos
u should make a wool shop, since that u can grown flowers and make dye. and u can maybe have a sheep farm with rainbow sheeps!
You should make a shop selling the flowers
Lizzie is now pumpkin Floran
12:32 - It's always sunny in philadelphia refernce !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lizzie, LOVE your new end place. So cute! Can’t wait to see what’s next!!!
She survived X life on her one heart in two episode six and she dies with seven hearts on episode 3 of afterlife
Nooooooo
Baby shulk🥺💖
You should change how the pumpkin looks to match your outfit
Lizzie why don't u make a texture pack for the carved pumpkin so it can be cute and safe
Ooo
Lizzie should have stood in water when she hit Joey
Wait if origins means their ancestors did that stuff doesn’t that make Lizzie and Catherine sisters
Lizzy more plz
BABY SHULK
I Love how it went to a 10ft tall fish lady to a racoon girl smaller then a bin to a 4ft floral lady who lives in the end
hi LDShawdowLady and or Lizze you are truly my fav youtuber even now i am in the dream smp fandom but any you are my fav youtuber😁🥰❤❤❤❤❤❤
every single time she says "i know something thats perfect for you" youtube gives me a add and its  a right timing xD
Katherine being a floran in the overworld  Lizzie being floran in the end  And now i am thinking will there be a another floran that will go to the nether now i am enjoying this siries😊
Lizzie I'm so ashamed of you I'm only episode 3 you lost your life episode 3 Lizzy but I do like your new organ your skin is very cute and I hope you stay like this or else just kidding I don't know what I'm going to do to you I don't really know your address I don't know anything about you that's like private so I just really I like this but you again I hope you stay like this and I hope none of these words are open bye the boys
I wish you the greatest of luck with your new life!
Lizzie you should make a custom pumpkin so instead of it just being a normal pumpkin its a pumpkin that matches your outfit :D

I have never laughed so hard at a YT video as this one! Thank you Lizzie! Love your content!

Can I join?
Yo what mod is the end 1 i rlly wanna play it!!!
Boat boggie
It looks like pandora from avatar in a way
You should get all of your old things from the over world
what mods did u install for all those flowers
You should name your island end of the lost floran cuz theres alot of flowers and and your a floran oh ya you could get lost of the islands you have
"A rare, magical golden goose egg" Hmm where does that sound familiar from?
Coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
OMG WHATS THE MOD FOR THE ENDDD?
Wow 😳😱😯
And I was just watching Katherine‘s video she was on episode three
Yeah you’re just like Katherine yay!!
I feel so bad for you

Hey Lizzie, what mod are you playing on and how many mods are there in the sever?
Lizzle no more. You're now Isabela. (If you've watched Encanto) lol
ISABELLA IS THAT YOU?
13:59 THE BEST THING I HEARD FROM LIZZIE IN 2022
Lizzie doing the chest shimmy in the boat had the same vibe as Tubbo discovering his chest wiggling when mined that one tree
Lizzie I think u would fit in a Frozened Flower Themed. Because if the end was in real life i think it would be cold! : )
Hi I’m rube sorry that I look like a boy. I loooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeee you. I really want to play Minecraft with you if u say yes here’s my right it just like it is please xxf3aR 4UrL1fxx. I really like u and I really want to play with you bye

So good
I want an end Queen and the shulk movie
Can you post a bit faster because I love your vids but it takes sooooo long
Hey lizzy you live in the end so why don't you change your skin to a enderman theme!
Kinda that Lizzie and Katherine are both floran's it kinda looks like they both are the floran twins
hi ldshadowlady can you try to make an green house if you want to? btw im a big fan stay safe <3
I introduced my brother to Lizzie and Afterlife smp, Empries SMP etc etc, funniest thing is he calls Joel "BEAN" no idea why he wants to call him that but I thought I'd share it.
Katherine:The sun is your best friend.  Lizzie:The sun is going away!  Katherine: 👁👄👁
Are the flowers and plants and stuff part of a mod? and if so, PLS TELL ME WHAT ITS CALLED ITS LEGIT THE BEST AND I SPENT AROUND @ HOURS GETTING MYSELF IN THE END, KILLING THE DRAGON, AND READING THE ANNOYINGLY LONG STORY AT THE END REALISING WE CAN SKIP IT, THEN REALISED THAT I HAD BEEN WANDERING FOR A LONG TIME AND I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT LOOKED AS AWESOME AS THAT. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
TELL ME WHAT ALL YOUR MODS WITH THOSE FLOWERS I NEED THIM and the after life one
Lizzy wear a floral end skins
Wow,lizzie you made this series more interesting 🤩
The fact Lizzie added a “weee” sound as she fell, into the void is incredible
I'm happy your a floral style now
Oh my god please I beg you - tell me what mods make Minecraft look like this! i desperately need his in my life!
this was the only thing on my subscriptions list not sad tonight, lolz, thanks ily
i was so sad to see her leave the bathhouse but was overjoyed to see her get a MAJOR upgrade in biome scenery, cant wait to see what she builds in it :D
always love lizzies videos :)
Dude! The biomes in this end are STUNNING!!! I might use the biome at 5:46 as reference for a poison forest in my comic!
Raccoon lizzies sacrifice has brought beauty to after life smp
Is the end a mod orrrr-..     I just looked, i feel dumb as someone in the mainly creative community
I’m so excited to watch you live out your Florian life, the end is so pretty!!!
*receives an egg* oh ._. WAIT there are no chickens in the end *throws eggs immediately* there are still no chickens in the end! ._.   Absolute gold.
You should put a chest full of pumpkin heads so when people come to ur shop they can just put it on and so they won’t die if they look in the wrong direction
You should make a texture pack that makes your pumpkin look like a space helmet
Near your house
May you make a flower garden and i love you😁😁
I love the fact that lizzie fits every role she gets
No one gonna talk about this is the same outfit that lizzie used to kill joey in xlife
Yay!!!!!!!!! A new  afterlife Episode!!! Love You and all of your Episodes 😘🥰😻♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️. I wish i kould Play Minecraft with you!
The part where oli listens to the song, caught me off guard.
i rather u as a raccon its cute TwT
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO!!! >:D
Ah yes First LD shadowlady  Then LD fishlady Then LD racoonlady So now LD plantlady Yass( ꈍᴗꈍ)
I have a lot of favorite parts but i can't describe them because I like all of them
Lizzie i agree that you should get everyone on a boat and dance haha its funny.
i think if lizzie build a water fall in the end that will be super cute and i will miss the raccon and i like the new orgin and the flowers in the end is super cute.
Watch Lizzie win Joey's contest
Lizzie, there is a botanist bench that you can use to change the pumpkin's color and design! Someone else suggested this, I just want the suggestion to have a higher chance of being seen
i love how the only advice she got was “stay in the sun” and she decided to move to the end 😭
lizzie  dont forget to always carry water yo gain strength from water
also Lizzie the other loom thingy can make different wool patterns kinda like a chisel
OMG THIS MOD IS AMAZING!!!!! THE PLANTS ARE GORGEOUS 👑😫
Are thy using a new minecraft update?? Also I love Ur vids
why dint u clib out
does anyone know if the end was updated to look like that? or is that mods?
The way Lizzie said, “⁎Gasp⁎ There are no chickens in the End! ⁎Wishfully throws egg⁎ There are still no chickens in the End!”
YOU SHOULD GET A ENDERMAN AND KEEP IT  AND NAME IT ENDER JEREMY.
Get the flower mod from x life SMP to mix end flower polen items
MAGICAL MUGGLE WORLD
Lizzie your new power reminds me of the girl from encanto who has the flower powers (I forgot the. Name lol)
It’d be so cute if Lizzie made Florian style bridges connecting the islands so she doesn’t risk falling of being hit off. She could add a bunch of the floating lanterns and end flowers.
Omg yay you and Kathrine are both florans
Does anyone know what mod it is for the end biomes
Why did this feel like 5 minutes
I love how Lizze killed herself and now living where she got killed like...
i love that she has a end shop
I love how they stay true to their characters, the slightest little detail makes me happy
How do you make the cutest houses! Like literally it's so adorable and creative! Love you Lizzie, Keep it up!!!!
Oof in the last episode you just fell off
Its the ENDchrins
The end is so cute
14:43 when Lizzie said "Oh you want a baby shulk?" Sounded like she was talking to a little kid
Lizzie your biome is amazing btw ! its so nice and pretty ! i also like your shop btw.
You should also try the other version of Pumpkins for you to cover your face. I saw one it on Gem's video and saw Scott made a blue pumpkin. There is a pink one and blue one, you could try it and look so much cooler. The end is beautiful Lizzie and I love that you chose to live there so we could see the beauty of it.
SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THIS FANTASTIC MOD IS IM OBSESSED🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕💕
Fix the cobblestone bridges that are in the Nether it’s not the best, ps ly :)
Hi
You should give everyone complimentary pumpkin heads when they come in at spawn so they can not be hurt by the endermen!
I love this ur the best YT !,,
i like to think that the reason the endermen attacked lizzie is because she scammed oli with the tentacle LMAO
Buddy the cat but he's a _________ who will ____ us  Comment if you know the correct words😏
Hi Lizzie, I have a question. When you record your videos do you record them silently and them add speaking after or do you speak while recording them? Sorry if that doesn’t make sense.
Ok but imagine she died while transporting the bees… that would be so upsetting because she went through all that work to make a home in the end
Oh I HAVE to draw this skin.
Bro, if I was her and I died I would’ve been so scared for my origin, Bc I know theirs some bad ones
Build bridges from island to island for safety plus itll really look cool and pretty (≧▽≦)
Can you do a 100 baby challenge playlist in sims 4
I LOVE OLI HAVING A MAIN GIRL MOMMENT!!!!
OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Trade megan for items
12:38 Best line I have heard from this Afterlife SMP yet and I have been watching everything. I loved it, 10/10 am subscribing and notifying now lol
Ur outfit is so cute Lizzie and ur new home am glad u got that.❤️
I LITERALLY LOVE YOUR OUTFIT! AH ITS SO CUTE 🥰
you should made an overworld “base” so when you’re hanging around the overworld you have some supplies and a place to stay!!
YOU SHOULD MAKE A PLANT SHOP
The drama Oli made during the disk playing was just over the top lol
i love your life now
Cute endtrance
it is hard to brith
I think that katherine and of shadow lady are a team like in x life they build and 3 heart club like I'm on their team
Lizzie’s conversation with Oli went from 1-100 REAL QUICK
Lezzie you should build a house in a Fairyland theme it will look good especially in the area that you choose  (Sorry if my grammar not right)
You should make a zoo of the end creatures starting with that end fish you found. I think Joel saw a flowery slime you could probably include in a zoo. You should also build a botanical garden of the plants you've found in the end.
I think that it should be the, END-trance.
Ok ngl I laughed really hard when she discovered she can dance in the boat.
Omg now I’m downloading that mod
Lizzie: "Well, well, well-" Oli in chat: " yeee"
oh my god I DIDNT KNOW THE END COULD BE SO BEAUTIFUL 😭
Joey/shulk: being scared  Lizzie: Hello welcome to the end, where I live Joey/shulks mind: how the heck does she live here?!?!
I think it's cool that she decided  to live in the end because  she did die there
THE DISC IS AMAZING I ALMOST SLEEP..
lizzie with literally every end plant: "ooo so pretty! I want one."
Lizzie u forgot hyumi
12:00 You missed the chance to say "endtrance"
Hi don’t know if you will read this but maybe for your flower market you could section off an make different shops\stalls for different biomes in the end and decorations that would be cute (*ฅ́˘ฅ̀*)♡
Lizzie! You should build a bridge for every end island, but the theme for every bridge you build is inspired by the biomes of the overworld :D
A masschara ad pop up when Lizzy said let me show you my wares Me: I don't he want masschara lizzy
I lost it at "look man if you're going ti have an opinion " I'm rolling on the floor HELP
im a day late  god-damnit  anyways  the end looks so good  @Firel did such a good job  also.. your minecraft skin is so pretty!
I looooveeee the end dimension biome!!! 😭♥️♥️♥️♥️
you can make custom pumpkin heads at the florist bench with different colors
There was an END update!?!?!?!?@?
please dont die lizzie PLEASE
It would be so pretty if Lizzie did a bridge at every island :O so that guests would be safe to walk and not die ^^
Omg she used the mod that Lynsayrae did for one of her videos!
lizzy gamer Burry lied to Joel that she told you that Scott he was trying to steal something from joel
Is it just me who is head over heels for the aesthetic of the end-
All glory for the pumpkin queen  !!
You and Katherine are a good team I hope you don't die and Katherine you to are my Idol💙💕
part 5 plesss
While I rllly liked ldracoonlady this is pretty good aswell!!!
I MISS THE RACCOON
I miss you as a raccoon Lizzie but at least you get another Beautiful skin and I love your vids I am a big fan! ^v^
Lizzie your villagers have been abandoned.
Crazy craft/troll craft Lizzie:”I’m pretty sure it’s always night at the end”  “The Sun is your best freind-“   Lizzie:”ah yes the end..”
the end is actually so beautiful
Lizze deserveds the title"The End Floran"because shes in the end
Lizzy according to Scott's Video you re-roiled did you? and what did you get? (Also I love your Content!)
When you said you were going to live in the end I was a bit doubtful, but when I saw all the beautiful trees I’m so glad you decided to live in the end it’s all so pretty 😊
I’m glad that ur different now i didn5 like the racoon
O lordy lord the queen of the end
That was really good thinking getting offline as soon as you realised you couldn’t take the endermen, I was so scared you were going to die!
Its not AfterLife its EnderLife. lol
who realized that lizzie’s floran outfit was from xlife when she killed jack?
Why does the end look so good???? Is that a mod and if it is I NEED NAME!
Omg- Joel is the ruler of the nether and Lizzie is the ruler of the end- the perfect power couple ;000
Make a shrine for raccoons
Lol the end-trance that was the first thing I thought
I love your vids💜💜
Lizzie you should make your new pet end fish an aquarium!!
15:08 Oli: yeee
"TeLL tHeM tO LeAVE mE AlOnE"
The "hello Oliver" had me howling so funny lmao idk y
I wish that the vanilla end looked like that 🤩
Prank Joel like if u think lizzie should prank Joel
lizzie you gotta work on those bridges we all know your gonna fall off them and they arent very pretty either-
your the best
i hope you become raccon lizzie agan
Sadly you can't sleep in the end
The skin is the same as the one in episode 21 of X-Life
what mod is she using for the end?? it’s GOREGOUSSSS!!
I think you should make a bee house instead of living with the bees
LDShadowLady can I please play with you when I get a computer or if you don't want me to play with you can you tell me what mods you use
❤️❤️❤️👑
I hope you don't die in episode 6! Please do not do any "Evil Plans"
More base invaders
I didn't think two people could have the same origin at the same time-?
I like the pink end buyom
lizze: ohh there are these tentacles definitely not my thing but i know someone else might enjoy them me: hm.. oh! i know! joey!
It would be cool if you made a house next to Kathrines in the over world and stayed there every 3 episodes or slowly became and ender creature on accident or something
Does anyone know the name of the mod for the end and the shaders?
Love the pastel floran outfit, but I think a cute outfit inspired by the end would be amazing! ^-^
the song was beautiful! oil was just having seizure or something tho-
I have an idea! Every time you die you can go into a new biome in the end
you should give joey the tentecals.... plz tell me you get the empires refrence
seeing lizzie as a floran erases my sorrow of her first death
LIZZZZZZZYYYYYY WHY
baby shulk do do do do baby shulk
should’ve gone into water then hit joey hmmm
the endtrance lol
Well this is definitely a HUGE change in scenery.  can’t wait to see how this continues
katherine is a floran too
It would be so cool if you had a building in each biome in the end. Because they are all literally so pretty  For example, in the pink biome you could have a building for growing plants and in another biome you could have your house or a guest house.  Just so yh at you are able to see all the really pretty hooked in the end 😍👍
I am always late to waching ur videos
Does anybody know all the mods they are using or are they not out yet?
You have saved my life
I thought I'd miss the racoon but I LOVE THIS, youre so funny, do you stream this or just upload YouTube videos?
lizzy it's kind of funny that you died on the third episode of an smp that record the amount of deaths you've had on the server ngl ;-;
I wish I could play on this server as my first video
The fact you got Katherine’s Power
The Floran takeover has begun... soon they will rule the server
Hey yall 🙂 how yall doing? 💪💯🔥🔥 if anyone wants to do a collab I'm down to I'm not that good but I'm trying 😂 I appreciate yall reading this and hope you have a better day then before reading this much love y'all 💙💪💯🙏🔥💙💙💙💙💙💙
(Pls read this) you should name your shop: Flowers Glore! For Honey Pots And More!
I love you videos
I love you LDShadowLady
when are you gonna post daily
Yasss more
can you make an art series
Is it me or does the end look like pandora? 😂
To 'ENDtice' them
Love you
I love how she says she is so scared of the end and nether and she is literally living in the end🤣🤣
I think you should make some rugs for your end house like you did in X Life. Also I love your videos!
Lizzie, there is a way to change the look of your pumpkin and you could have a cute head in the end
There is just pne tiny problem with living in the end......no beds
Wait but the modded end is so gorgeous and stunning
What mods do you use?
The time 7:48 was SO cutee
I love coon
Comment coon or flower to debate which costume was cuter
Honestly I am going to morn lizards eh GAHRBHAGE buisiness. But her new origin is adorabpe
What mods did you guys use for the End ?
you could also sell wood from the end too
Katherine's sister
Nose ingles
Why did you do that you new it was a bad idea. P.S. I love your videos 💘
Btw you could make or maybe should make a new house the old one is a bit too small or cramp like you said, Likewise I want to point out that you should make a new place to call home maybe a crystal dome it would  Look amazing!!!  Nice video btw 👌
Hi
you have the same orgin as kathrine and by the way i love lizzie
you should hang vines from the island that holds the end portal!
what mod is this
You also killed several people ! Great job
Hey you are keeping a very old tradition of getting stuck in the end or maybe not I don’t know if you are stuck or not.
Wow... A diamond ingot
Can we talk about how Fwhip was an influence in another person’s death? By accident ofc.
I love how cute this is! The End vegetation is so pretty!
Did my girl really say to olly TELL THEM TO STOP
Please tell me the plants in the end are real! I want them
I love how when something disappointing happens Lizzie always makes it not a big deal
She's gone from being the Ocean Queen to dealing damage when wet!! Love you Lizzie ❤
Lizzie you should make it so you’re able to wear the pumpkin but it won’t appear as one! Change it to a cute texture that matches ur skin!
So…her old house is up for grabs? Or is she ever going to return? Lol.
Lizzie please share whats the name of the mods youre using😊
Oh right you died OMG the fact that the last video ended like that that was hilarious! But I can’t believe you died :(. I mean your new life is pretty cool but it has a lot of downsides…..
So lizzie is extra flammable now- And her husband is a blaze born. I want to see them interact before one of their origins change! 🤣🤣
are you gonna make a new house?
I love ur vids!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Why did I think that you died on purpose XD
Lizzie I love the Siris but I hope it as a story like empires other than that I love the Siris
Your so cute as a Florence
There is a plant workbench that can let you change different plants and change the the pumpkin heads face  I don't know if you can wear it or if it works though  I assume yes because the pumpkin is a very useful item in the end   but it could just be for decoration   Also dont know if it works on end plants...  Now that I think about I think you had it during the racoon empire in the workshop floor...  Never mind than 😅
Lizzie make your pumpkin head cuter because you don't want your customers to see you as a scary pumpkin
I gotta admit- I thought Lizzie was cRazY for wanting to live in the end— BUT THAT WAS BEFORE I KNEW IT WAS MODDED  OKAY!?!?!?!? ……pretty…..
Lizzie next you should mack a farm of bees and unesasery things in it and build a humunges castel becuase then pepoel will feer you! lol have a good rest of march brack... :)
sad fact: your husband is a fiery man and you are a plant woman, that means you can't touch because you're going to burn 🔥💔🌱
What sort of end mod do you have Lizzie?! I want is now! I’m jealous!
Lol Lizzie why in the world will you have an evil plan you nu you will die
Hey Lizzie since your gonna live in the end for like forever I think you sound re design the pumpin hea to look cuter
Is there a mod
Omg we’re did you get your mods tell me
Can you please leave a link for the mod.
The same as Katherine (the power)
0:30 WeEeE
NOOO I MISS RACOON
Same as katrain
floran thats not that bad :)
Just a few tips for living in the better end; 1. Those end lillies can be farmed, cooked, and turned into paper, 2. Look for a sulfur biome (yellow smoking geyser towers), as sulfur + coal/charcoal + bonemeal = gunpowder, and 3. Get an elytra so you can fly around instead of having to bridge across the void to get places! Also, instead of regular enchanting, you might want to look into the infusion pedestal, it's used to create specific enchanted books, as well as a few other things 😎 I've been playing as a Dragonborn in a different Origins modpack, and I've been loving the better end life! Best of luck, don't want you dying again too soon 🤡
I have a suggestion! I think It would be really cute For you to go back to Get some dogs and build them cute little houses! Hope you read this byee ^^
Wait I just realised, it would be cool if when you are a floran going to the end, you would get an achievement and become glumolescent each time you are next to the bright trees and flowers
Finally you oploaded I've been waiting since last month (love you and all you Y/N  Man
Please call how you can get those plants at the end in your Minecraft world
Hey Lizzie, I was just watching Scott’s video and in the chat it showed that you rerolled your role, I was just wondering what you got before you rerolled??
LET ME LIVE IN THE END WITH YOU    I love mushrooms lol
lizzie you should make a cute path all the way from your bee area to the end portal for easy acces :))
lizzie scott made something in the end i don't know what but there is something🤔
Crystal house
RIP raccoon Lizzie
Maybe, you could have a laboratory in each area that has different plants
LIZZIE? ARE ALL THOSE FLOWERS AND STUFF ACC IN THE END?? I am freaking out i need those in my minecraft game! Are they mods?
What a strange but amazing place to live
More please
I love how you live in the end, I also love your flowers
Love your new skin
I’m obsessed with the end flowers I need moreeee
More often Besty post
0:29 the faint ✨weeee✨
Love the house ❤️
I play this modpack in another server, and I'm just waiting for Lizzie to discover the creepy shadow people in the dragon tree biome. It's going to be entertaining.
You should make the end entree platform more safe.
lizzie should live in a tree house
Omg I love the plant one it's so cute
What was the origin that lizzie rolled up and chose not to be, so she re-rolled?    Just now watching MothBoy's upload, and at 7:20 it clearly says on the chat that Lizzie used a reroll.   But what was the respawn life she didn't agree to, before she became a Floran?
Nobody: Lizzie: shimmies
Baby shalk do do do 🦈🦄
I don’t mean to be rude but I personally like the Florian origin more
Honestly this is just such a great series ❤️❤️❤️ (Ofc all thanks to lizzie ❤️)
Did you use a mod for the end trees and biomes
Omg ur vids trending go gal
You know the smp getting good when lizzy makes a shop
anyone know what mod is used for the end here??? its so pretty
Can you name your fish moonlight,star,Lillypad, or flipping fish
I love Sausage and Joey trying to protect her when she enters the end
You should name the fish something
5?
LMAOO JOEY JS SO FUNNY
I really am I big fan I think your amazing keep being you I really want to meet u it would be my dream ps I'm a girl but the picture is my dad bc it his account LOL
I am going to start a petition for an end update 😂
Lizzie, you should put some overworld plants by your house to remind you of your original roots
People in the chat: No Lizzie, There she goes, Nooo
OMG that base was soooooo cute and i cant BEElive that ur a florean with kathrin ur skin is adorbs
I thought ep 3 was the last one I was like 😨😨
This episode is so cute I hope she lives longer as a floran
Wow... guess we'll have to get used to this setting from now on! let's see how lizzie LIVES here
omg i love your videos
Hi Liz just wanted to tell you that you didn’t slip but... fwip pushed you
I love how lizzie  only  had 2 episodes to live as a racoon😂
You are beautiful LDshawdowlady ❤️
This is my fav video
The fact that Lizzy and Katrine(im sorry if i spelled her name wrong) have the same origin-
you should add a crown to your avatar, to show that you rule the end, (because ollie has literally never been to the end before- is he even a true enderman?) i do not take blame for this causing war against you two
Hi I love the vid
I LOVE YOU SO  MUCH!!!!
What is you named your end fish Fin? Just so your fish doesn’t despawn.
What mod do you use for the End💖
Lizzie I think you should make a flowery castle next to your greenhouse it would look so pretty decorated with all the flowers you collected in the end.
the end queen has a new pet,  i have some wonderful names for the newly crowned queen, :D  Shard  Saphire  Azure  Lapis   :D
I think you should make bridges to different biomes in the end based of its theme or something. :3
Lizzie if you are reading this you should mack a skin who is a little bit more of a end theme 😅and um here are some new names florono, Endruu and enddylily idk I commented some for the racoon theme😶
You should make an oversized flower garden! That way everyone can walk through and look up and see all the flowers above them!
14:15 THE WAY JOEY GRUNTED "OOHHHHHHHH..." HAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
the biome is like Enchanted Oasis on steroids 😭❤
I love how she says, “bee nests” like she’s never heard the word hive 😂 no hate intended I just thought that was cute
I felt bad for Lizzy died on her on trap that whent misrabley failed
“Honey, need honey “ why did that sound so cute 😭🖐🏼
So you’re the only one the died- well congratulations on being the first with a different origin 😂
For a reason I think of lizzie as Isabela from encanto because of the dress she's wearing ;u;
can we talk abt how cute her new skin is???
I think The End is the perfect place for you 😊
You should custom texture the pumpkin head like other items from Empires so that it’s like a magical flower crown of protection or something.
Make a house by the pink byom🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
You should make the paths more thicker so you don’t fall
She looks elegant in that dress
Endtrance
Lizzie I think you should get a pet enderman
Part 2
Raccon Lizzie will be missed
When is he said I’m sure something will like these tentacles I thought she was going back to empires with Joey then she gave them to Oli
Can u do a leave house for me pls
it's a very beautiful house Lizzie! Hopefully, another raccoon will come along to take your place as Trash Guardian.
You need to make a flower farm  in the end so you can have infinite flowers
Lol "I'm not taking off this stupid pumpkin head ever again"! Oh my gosh Lizzi & Oli panaking made me laugh so hard. 💕
Nooo how could you you abounded humiee
lizzie need to build some safe Bridges because it is very scary walking to a 1 block wide bridge.
me when the video ends: NOO..😕
Fun fact Lizzie's floran skin is the skin that Lizzie used on baking jack from the gingerbread house at xlife
Imagine if she became a giant!
I have been here since the very start of this series it is sooooo cool!!!! I’m 9 and i really like all your videos please notice this message -ibis. PS: (don’t mind my crazy name my sister and i are sharing an account.)
May your raccoon life be in peace
awh wow! what packs do you use on this world? id love to have them for myself, its beautiful.
I can’t believe that Lizzy almost died a second time 😂
We need a graveyard for our lil raccoon because its not a LDShadowLady series without a graveyard duhhh <33
MY SISTER GOT ANYRY WHEN I SAID YOU UPLOADED 😨
End-trance
Joey: hey- im totally not scared at all- Joey: Shulk not scared- Joey:shulk tough boy
You should put a open and closed sign so people know when you are selling and they don’t rob
What is the name of the mods you use?
Congrats LDShadowlady, you’re #3 trending in gaming
Lizzie in the end:Sees flowers Also Lizzie:I’l Take your entire stock
Ah Lizzie when you broke that one block in the ‘elevator’ to take everyone to the end, you could’ve just stuck to the wall and climbed back up and let everyone else have done the dragon business for you.  Ah well, old times now
The plants are so cute I can’t wait to see what happens next!
hey lizzie i know you probs won’t reply, but what mods are the ones you used?! x
What mods did you guys use?
I'm drawing plant lady
You should get the End Veil enchantment! It makes it so that when you enchant your helmet, you can look at endermen without them becoming hostile! Really useful for when you need protection from endermen and other things.
Is it me or does anyone else realise that her new Florian skin is actually from X-life when she was baking jack in a cake. But anyways the skin is still super cute!
watching this 🍃is insane
Lizzie you should work with Katherine in her flower shop since you are also a floran
But isn’t Katherine a floran
Hello! I'm writing on behalf of my 8 year old daughter, and she says, "Hello! I love your videos, and I love Minecraft too! You're always so positive, and you make my day happy" V.C. from Texas :)
It hurts my soul that she missed out on the pun that her floewer store were blooming... :(
By far my favorite series so far
Is it just me or do you LOVE lizzie's floran skin?
I miss raccoon lizzie
I really liked the raccoon life, it's so sad to see it go! But hopefully u don't die again :]
I WANT A PT. 5
Lizzie is the same origin as Katherine so this is goons be intesting. Also did you know  Seapekay  died twice while going to rerole
I miss the raccoon
I think perhaps we should invest more times into the roads of the End. While one block cobblestone paths between end islands may work for some, I feel we are one new giant origin away from the void claiming another life as well.   Also what a better way to inspire people to buy then seeing all the beautiful builds that can be made from the local flora?
at first i was kinda sad there's no more racoon but so far lizzie being a florin has been just as amazing
Hi Lizzie hope you are doing well I'm going to comment until you notice me. I'm not a big fan tho.
It’s not really a floating island
The whole incident when she looked at and enderman and Ollie just watches as they attack her had me hollering
I get big pandora vibes in the end lol 😂
Random idea: flower crown made of your favorite End flowers! 😃
Lizzie: I have something that's perfect for you. Ad: HaRdEr LeMoNaDe
"GOODBYE, CRUEL OVERWORLD"  "NO LIZZIE DON'T DO IT"
End-trance. Lol
FHW NOISE JOEY MADE WHEN U HIT HIM IM CRYINR BEO
Quick question, what mod is put on for the  end! It’s so cool! (Love your channel!7
Lizzie! you should retexture the pumpkin to look like a sunflower hat!!! btw love this video :D
Live in a castle plsss
Jgjgjg
Hi Lizzie i'm a big fan i have an idea, maybe you could change your outfit to also kinda match the end like enderpearl hair clips or something like that so people can know! 😊
Hey LDShadowLady where do you live I want to send something to you please 🥺
No but why is the End that pretty
I JUST SAW THAT LIZZE IS THE TALLEST PERSON IN EMPIRES-
O have subscribed
Hello
Lizzie,  PLEASE widen your bridges if you're going to jump-run across them.
GUYS GUYS!!! JOEL IS A BLAZE AND LIZZIE IS A PLANT LADY! THE FORBIDDEN ROMANCE LMAO
You should see if there are other types of pumpkins in this modpack (I’m pretty sure i saw a blue gourd that was carvable in someone else’s video) or you could see if you can get the pumpkin retexture to match your aesthetic.
hi
Love the skin
YAYYYY UR BACK!!!!!!!
I love your video so much❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Excellent job 💖💖💖
I love your video so much I
Lizzie,you should maybe make a pumpkin stall next to your flower shop so then all the people who come to the end without any pumpkins will buy a pumpkin to protect them from endermen.(This was just a random thought)
Hey LD shadow lady can you put all the mods that you have in the series down in the description pls
Lizzie the thallasium stuff is pretty much just iron in the end lol Also you should try to get enderite! It’s hard to get, although it’s powerful!
I love your videos
i love how the chat was “NO LIZZIE DONT DO IT” when she went into the end
It would be cool if there was a wolf origin. Maybe, some of the powers/weakness  Nocturnal ( can’t sleep )  If you hold a bone in your of hand to get two extra hearts ♥️  Meat eater ( only eat meat ) Fear of small spaces ( 5-5) (slowness) Sheep ( you kill any sheep you see) Trust ( you get agitated or aggressive when people come to your home) Moon ( you get speed when you are outside in the moonlight)
Lizzie DONT DIE
i’m gonna choke myself out i loved the raccoon lizzie 😩
At least you can read now
Can u join among us and open this lobby ETCTHG
You could make a little hut next to your shop that’s two blocks tall so people can go in there for safety from endermen
I like ve Lizzie just ignored that Joey said don’t do it
Lizzy looks so cute  Lizzy and Katherine is floral sisters 💓💞
Lizzie: i am never leaving the end ever again Lizzie in the fucher: look
Ah please dont die with this powers😅
Isabellaaa your Joels hereeeeeee
So I had seen this video posted yesterday and it said 18minutes ago do I still count as earlier?
WHAT MOD IS THAT I NEED IT
Lizzie: *is fed by the sun* Also Lizzie: let’s go live in the end!
Dont tell Lauren about her egg child breaking in the end...
scott took some of the mushrooms in the overworld
I love that you established in the End, it's just GORGEOUS! Whoever made this mod needs to slap Mojang across the head so they can get those great ideas too.
I think you have the same origin as someone
does the end look like this because of the mod? if it relly looked like this minecraft would be booming-
What mod is da end flowers? I am going to take notes if you tell me. IT'S SO PRETTY!!!! Im gonna draw the plants of the end
Color your pumpkin, your killing me mentally
Note to self I don’t like waiting for new videos for sieries
I love your new house but I also love your old house
What mods are in this server?
Your the same as kath
(*opens procreate*) ART TIME
Lizzie you should try to make your carved pumpkin to a flower I  your hair
PLEASE WHAT’S THE NAMES OF ALL THE MODS IN THE SMP I NEED THEM
Ok I know this isn't related but.....COUNTIUE THE SIMS DISNEY SERIES pls 🙏
lizzie you should make a texture for the pumpkin it would look rly cute
The fact that 2 people have already died and Geminitay has only made one video is weird
Is this a special mod or can we all plat it? 👀👀
Hello lizzie i have some cool ideas *a massive beehive for ur bees like it is the overworld * and making ur own custom floating flowers PS- i absolute LOVE  your videos and the new biome s so cool i never knew the end could look like that
OMG LIKE THE END IS SO CUTE
It was funny when she said endtis them
Nooo not racoon Lizzy I loved that oraginnnn
Does anyone know what this mod is for the end..?
the fact that Joel is a Blaze while Lizzie is a plant make me laugh so much
Are you going to move your villagers to the end?
I cant believe I didn’t have all notifications on..ldshadowlady is my favorite YouTuber
it would be cool if you made some of the those huge flowers but out of the new end stuff... maybe the crystal blocks
nooo
Only if she had a totem of undying.
Wait are u actually living in the end??
Isabella vibes ✨💖
Lizzie you should put the jukebox underneath the ground so people don't know where the music is coming from
It is so enchanting Lizzie! ✨❤️
I want to buy a flower it looks so pretty
Like Katherin! You’re sisters!!
Lizzie your new base is so cool! I love it so much! Maybe you could make multiple fields of end flowers around your house… lots of love Lily💗
Congratulation for your new life. Please make a beautiful house in the end and paths.
Call the End Entrance the End-trance
ITS AN END ENDRANCE INSTEAD OF END ENTRANCE
Hey Liz, I think your not going to find this but if you do, maybe you can build little bridges to each biome island and decorate it in a way it fits the biome your going to ?
What About Humie And The Enchanting Table Though?
She always chooses the most unique places to live!
I watched Joel's video they killed the dragon and fought for the egg
noooooo the raccoon
Isabela is that you?
Once you died I thought you would get a bad origin, but I was wrong it's prob the best lol! You: I didn't want to stay in that house any longer than I had to. Me: You built that though!! At least you could build a kawaii one full of adorable plants:) Btw I LOVE the mods you used to make the nether cuter and the overworld!!
Omgggheee😂 you almost died again HAHHAHAHA
i think you should jazz up the bridges that lead from island to island😁
15:07 look at the chat
I love it when she gets carried away😄her builds are SO very cool! Or am I just a really badd builder..nah,nah,nah she really is good- GREAT builder😆 "Like husband, Like wife" they say❤
“There are no chickens in the end. There are still no chickens in the end.” LDShadowLady, 2022
alternative title: lizzie goes crazy due to all the beautiful plants she finds in the end
Next to the portal you should have a chest full of pumpkin heads for your customers! That way they don’t die like you almost did! And you should also decorate the end portal with stuff from the end
Wait Her origin is like Katherine origin right
Does anybody else remember that outfit from xlife? She used it while luring people to her oven of death in one of the last episodes
16 hours ago first time i am early heyy
Does this mean Katherine has been replaced
Those biomes are so cool
8:36 yes some people really do like that...
NOT THE RACCOON LIZZY but she's a flower girl 😃 love you :3
Lizzie; there are no chickens in the End! Also Lizzie; there are still no chickens in the End!  i love this part so much XD
y'know what I find really impressive? people had grown to love racoon lizzie so so much I was scared people were going to be disheartened at watching a new origin. but somehow you've made this a new origin life that's just as loveable, or even more so, as racoon lizzie, even with an origin people have already seen. and I find that so amazing
Whats the name of the mod you use for the new biomes, I love it!!!!♥️
0:01 never thought lizzie would be evil :)
Someone else did like the Tentacles
Live with Katherine
Hey ldshadowlady! I was wondering what mods you use for this series!
Noooooooooo I liked the raccoon 😢
I love Lizzie's new origin and her cute skin:)❤ Remind me of what happened the last time she wore this skin?...●_●
Please make more Lizzie please
I watched this video was uploded like 16 hours agooo?
Lizzie will you take me to the end with you?
Love ur vids✋👑💅🌸🥰🤩🤩🤩😁😁💅💅👑👑
LdShadow lady ill always be a big fan waaaaaahhh
Lizzie I love your outfits so much I loved your raccoon onesie and I still love your outfit both of your elf I love both of your outfits literally I like to practice onesie cuz you had a because you're a raccoon and ask you something is she is she still a shadow I don't know if she's going to ask you to join not to sleep I don't know what it's called but that's why I'm just saying
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
"I want one"  -Lizzie 2022
Your should create a bridge with railing for safty measures just incase you fall off
Is there a place where I can see the mod pack you are using? The end mod looks so cool!
Lizzie should wear a purple pumpkin on her head. Scott had some in one of his videos and the purple would look better than orange.
I love your videos Lizzie 🥰
Lizzie should find some of the animals in the end and sell them.
maybe try making a bed area
This reminds me of a deal with destiny
You should make some other pumpkins to wear using the floral workbench
I love how Lizzie says "I want one"
When I saw the name of the video I wanted to cry
I cant believe she died
✨Shulk not scared shulk tuff boy✨
Oli should live with Lizzie at the end. They will be the "End Buddies" or Nemesis...well
YOU LEFT HUMI WHYYYYYY
I'M LOVING UR NEW LIVE THE END MOD THINGY IS SO COOL
The flower table thing could make the pumpkin head pink so it matches your esthetic
Liz you know that with the plant table you can modifie the pumpkin in your head, like a OwO face
1:56 SHE FORGOT HUMMY
💜💜THAT PLACE IS SOOOOOOOO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💜💜
I missed the Panda…but! I love this new Origin :D. It’s really cool!— at least to me! The ending was also really great
YAY finaly ep.4 woohoo
You should name the flower market “Florian Flowers”!!! :)
These role plays are amazing.
lizzie you should try to get some pet from the end or overworld to keep you company!
Two florals on the server now well well well
pealse give lizze a cute  life minecraft
Lizzie can you tell us what is the mod pack in after life PLEASEEEEEEE? ❤️❤️❤️
Lizzie, you should probably get an elytra
LDShadowLady your boyfriend here!!!
Its nice to see you having a new life💗
What’s the end mod called?
Omg Lizzie you almost died again! We have been waiting for an episode long time!     Don't die:>
First Lizzie was a raccoon Now she is Flower lady or Isabela from Encanto
Omg I need the stuff found at the end does anyone know how to get it??!!
Omg the pants ah so cute
Iizze I think you should make a real house and move your old stuff to your house and decorate it and explore the end more 😇
Lizzie! When I’m watching this your #1 on trending for gaming!congrats ❤️🥳
I THINK HES TALKING ABOUT THE GOLDEN EGG LIZZY GAVE TO KATHRINE 💀
I love the fact that Lizzie still thinks she is still small like a raccoon when when went back home😂😂😂 ...     I kinda want to see Lizzie loving in a treehouse like a little fairy/elf.
Can't you just put grass in the end for trees? Also I'm dyeing at home du to being sick
OMG the mods are amazing i wanna know them the end is usually not the prettiest but with the mods ITS AMAZING
She will become like Persephone ❤️✨
lizzie have you watched the new disney pixar movie turning red????? its amazing !
What if both of yall lived in the end together (you and oli)
“If you’re gonna have an epiphany can you do it elsewhere” - ☠️🤣
Scott may be the nether plant dealer, but Lizzie deals end plants I DESPERATELY need to know what mods are used here!! Minecraft is so pretty already but this really takes the cake!
noooooo i loved lizze the racoonnnnn. . .   :(                         at least she matches with Katherine  the mushrooms give me cottagecore vibes
Lizzie: There are no chickens in the end. Also Lizzie: *immediately throws chicken egg* Lizzie: ;-; There are still no chickens in the end T^T
those biomes are everything i have ever needed
the end is somewhere i want to be now!
l love the músic is sooo cute and pertty l love it!
Lizzie you should sell pumpkins at your market so people could not b afraid to die
I love how shubble has a greenhouse as her house and Lizzie has the floran origin
Elloooooo
Look man, if you're gonna have an epiphany can you have it somewhere else? 'Lizzie 2022'
I wish the vanilla minecraft end was this exotic, beautiful and cute. The mods in this series are so cool. 👏👌👍
Its my first time seeing the end! And i cant wait for future episodes, this is so beautiful
What mod is this TELL ME
Make your self a house
Hmm you and kathrine look like isabella from encanto tbh
I just want to know what mods or texture packs she used.☘️☘️
the end is so pretty and cool 😲
entrance? more like endtrance am I right, ahahah...
Definitely her origin
I like your new Thing and the racoon
I love it
New life!!!!!
You always wear a pumpkin now so ummm why not make you're outfit like a pumpkin with flowers all over it to match the pumpkin hat vibes
I LOVE THIS SERIES 😀 ❤
when lizzie logged out after being attacked my enderman i genuinely thought she died
2:14 ohhhh yahhhhhhh
Lizzie you should be the Floran of the end world and you and Catherine can be floran buddys your the end floran and cathrines the normal floran
I’m sick I’m sick
Noooo
This is just the PERFECT place for Lizzie!
NOOOOOOO RACOON LIZZIEEEE

ISABELA YOURE BOYFRIEND'S HERE!
Cool
Lizzie almost died again!
Lizzie, if you wanted to live in the end, you could find on of those cute trees in the end and make a treehouse in it, or build a custom tree. :)
Lizzie you can use the botanist bench to make new pumpkin heads - there's some pink ones and other really cute face! Might look more Floran if you have to wear one forever now! <3
So many biomes in the End!
Why hello fello old Xlife skin lizze
Katherine and Lizzy are probably besties in the world now :D
I knew that oli would like the Tentacles
Peace love and plants
The End in modded is so much cuter than vanilla!
I love it how Lizzie always finds a way to friend Katherine🥰🦢
you should decorate the end island that you put your shop on. it looks a little dreary and not fit  for your beautiful shop and staircase.
In The crushed end ship could be Elytra
You are so DANG CUTE Lizzy!!🤩💗💗 I absolutely LOVE the shop and your/bee house it's super cute!!💗💗
Omw this is by far the best episode by far in my opinion
SOOO GOOD I LOVE UR VIDEOS SOO MUCH
First! To be last.
I was 100% expecting Oli to start singing ngl
Lizzie you need to build a house
You should try better Minecraft
i laughed so hard when the endermans started beating up lizzie and shes like OLI HELP OLI TELL THEM TO STOP i love that
Where did you find that mod
YOUR ISABELLA!!!!!
Gonna miss Lizzie the racoon, but Lizzie the end florian seems super awesome!  Can't wait to see what happens next c:
I honestly feel so bad for lizzie
It's so sad that Lizzie died in her own trap .. remember that Time when she said she'll be a strong racoon she kinda lied but on the Good side she's with Katherine and it's kinda nice her being a flower because that suits her best like Katherine
Woo that was amazing
Use the botanic table to change the pumpkin to make it cool
Lizzie should build a house that looks like a flower a giant flower castle that she lives in and she should be known as the end floran  queen
What would you do with humy and teh other villagers?
Oli was bursting into song and she said NOPE do this somewhere else LOL 😂
She also is the opposite of Joel
She is so ambitious
lizzie u can desugn your pumpkin head
end floran lizzie has no problems with mobs and I think one thing would kill her someday is from falling, hope she would make a secure bridge for guests amd she could also add a chest with pumpkins for future visitors
Lol her voice at 8:52 😂
i wish the end looked like this in normal minecraft! mojang get some ideas! they have made the nether habitable but they have put little effort into the end to make it “livable” . good luck lizzie!!
Anyone who sees this comment, do you remember The Pixelarity? //Ü//
i do wonder if the nether pumpkins work in the end :0  they're purple! scott had a bunch of them. oh yeah, and definitely get a florist table to make your pumpkin look cute.
being  floran is so cool! good luck on your new origin atleast joel wont call you short anymore right?
I was so upset about raccoon lizzie but...... THE NEW SKIN SLOVED THAT PROBLEM
Hi I love your videos 😁 and also can you make a video about the mods that's in afterlife I really love the mods!😊
I love this one
LIZZIE!!!since you are a floran you should recreate what katherine did in empires so you can get a bunch of flowers!!!
The end mod
I will miss the moment of Lizzie picking up everyone's "GaRbAGe", but being a nature lover, you as the floran i just can wait for you to rule the end world, you should name that whole colorful biome in the end as the all mighty "Rendbow Endlands"!
LIZZIE!!!since you are a floran you should recreate what katherine did in empires so you can get a bunch of flowers!!!
Share the mod to us
i just noticed that fhwip is the one who pushed ldshadowracoonlady
Wow that is a fantastic ✨ENDTRANCE ✨ you built right there
It was the end-trance hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Do You prefer being a raccoon??
A rather grand endtrance
No one knew that She keeps going into lakes and not taking damage
You were the reason I started playing Minecraft <3
The end gets prettier.
Pleaseeee make a pond with those beautiful Lilly pads from 9:40
well dont on #1 on trending for gaming you really deserve it <3
ahhh #1 trending for gaming !! 🥳
NOOOOOOOOOO
Dissapointed to see the raccoon era has died, but hello floran lizzie! Floran besties with Katheryne!!
Finally Early for once💜

Hey lizzy you live in a rainbow house so why don't make these barrels rainbow like that red barrel in the house you can take it and take some rainbow wood and make your own rainbow barrel      Btw I love ur videos💕💞💓💜🤍💖💙💚❤🌺🌺🌺🍄
You should name your backpack “NOT ME NOT HERMIONE YOU” ah the memories
Lizzie: about to go to the end   Joey in chat:  NO LIZZIE DON'T DO IT   Sausage: and there she goes
what mod is that?
Lovely little greenhouse.  Maybe turn down the glow settings on the shaders somewhat, your building is so bright, it becomes hard to see stuff
I think you should call the End Entrance the  “Endtrance” A pun lol
I hope this will be a better series 🤔
The end is soo beautiful ❤️❤️😻
#1 on trending for gaming!!! Yay!
You should bee (heh) an avatar
Amazing video again!! I’m waiting for another episode!! Kisses me! 🍄✨🌿🌴💍🤍
I started crying when you felll becuase you looked kawaii as a racoon
RIP<3
What mod makes these beautiful end biomes
You should use a texture pack or something to change how a pumking hat looks like!
I’m obsessed😍😍 I think look like you 🧝🏼‍♀️🧝🏼‍♀️🧝🏼‍♀️
Wow I someone has the same one as you I can't remember who but yea that's so cool
Btw katherines feature is floran u two r same witch is so adorableee😊😊
2:09  I accidentally discovered something, and I don’t know how to describe it. *mission dont let the boys of my class see this.*
The Nethe- I MEAN END- is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo pretty ngl
Can you please make a nover vidoe
OMG FORBIDDEN LOVE WITH JIZZIE!? IMSO EXCITED
i didnt play minecraft anymore until i watched this and i started playing minecraft again, TY LDSHADOWLADY edit: pls the gasping at 8:52- lmao i just cant
I think you can have pink pumpkins if you want to Spice up your outfit
Lizzie i have a question so how is there a mezaelia tree at spawn everywhere? Is that a mod or just there is a giant lush cave under the area that all of you have not wanted to take resources from?
I saw that outfit and I was like, that outifit is really cute and familiar. And I went back to all her original series and she wore it when she was trying to kill JackSucksAtMc
I LOVE YOUR  VIDS I LIKED AND SUBED WHAT IS MOD PACK CALLED TELL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Her new name will be LDflowerlady now.
👍🏻
Love your video's!!!! I can never be so brave to live in the end just like you.
Isalizzie vibess
WOOOOOOEEOOWWW🤩
Lizzie! In the endtrance you should put a chest with pumpkins so visitors can be safe!!
im sad the racoon is gone :( i liked the evil plan maby with your new floran powers you shalt take all the flowers of the end and give them to people for really high high high prices THE MOST EVIL PLAN OF ECONEMY
Lizzie I'm also a YouTubeer to I love you
please someone tell me what mods they use for the end ;;
OUU SO ADORBSSS
Lizzie I think it was fwip Lizzie fwip pushed you off
I think it would be really cool if Lizzie replaced the pink wood with the rainbow crystals coming down from the portal it would look really cool
I already miss our little racoon lizzie <\3 but I'm very excited for Florian lizzie!
Kathrine and Lizzie are TWINS
Hello lizzie! Im sorry im not early but ill be still supporting you
I miss racoon lizzie😪😪😪
i love how you decided to live in the end
The opposite of Joel?? That’s so fitting lmao
Also can u make a mushroom thing jhst anything got to do with mushrooms
I think this is the cutest creator on yt and I LOVE IT
It's a bit new for me since she doesn't really go to the end but she has upgraded and stuff and she has become super brave- she grows to fast😔✌
What mods are on the server? Is there a place where the mods used are listed?
anybody know what mod she used for the end biomes?
Yay lizzie don't fall in the void though
The new Queen Of The End!
can you name a bee? if you can name the one that you like
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
damn now the only two people i watch play this are the same origin
No you're not that little cute raccoon anymore
so i know you can change the pumpkin textures in one of the table mods to be different colors, but can you use them as enderman defense? (edit: its the botanists worktable)
"oh, baby shulk." That was adorable
To cheaper water texture
I love the end! It's so magical it's so mystical buT the vanilla  end is so  boring I'll be typing this in every video becuz I really want an answer what mod do u use?
Water texture very dull
I love how everyone who has gone in  the end seemed scared, grabbed and dashed, but you have embraced it and allowed us to see the beauty & awesome brilliance of the different plants. Could you build up a mini biome area area with small plots of each biome and all plants soils growing therein? Help you to catalogue and aid your production...
Please change your shader pack
Your shader pack not good light is to bright & block texture not seeing good

Maybe lizzie losing her raccoon life was not that bad
I love Lizzie and her videos
The minuet i saw this went up i clicked on it please make moreee
Lizzie! You should change your floran skin to an end floran and move around by ender pearls<! That whould be SO cool! :D
You can make a farm of over world beings near the greenhouse
What are all the mods used? I really like how they look! :)
What a lovely end-trance to your flower shop! It is truly end-spiring
the end looks so beautiful!
Omg i love ur new origin!! im excited for the new upcoming episode but i have school so i can't watch daily ＞﹏＜
Am I the only one who notices that she built a house for the bee's but not herself
Florian Lizzie is beautiful, and that greenhouse is gorgeous I wish I was a youtuber so I could enjoy the wonders of this world
Can you tell me what mod you used for the end it looks absolutely beautiful
lizziee build a safer and better bridgeee i always get an anxiety that u will falll
The music is so good
“There are still no chickens in the end” had me laughing 😂
Mod name pls
Lizzie, I have a suggestion for your life in the end. Retexture the Pumpkin head to a flower crown matching the end flowers or your outfit..I have a feeling that you will wear the pumpkin head in The End *forever* , I also have thought the same for Katherine as a Floran in the overworld (..But with the overworld's flowers of course)
u and kath are twins 👯‍♂️
This series is so amazing i love how lizzie just neglected what Katherine said and is living in the end      Btw how does one find that biome in the end its really cool
You scared me lizzie 😂
This was a cool experience 🤩
I didn’t enjoy it  I loved it it was amazing
Lizzie! (Elizabeth 😌) i love ur vids! AND ur build r so cute and amazing!! Shout out pls!
OMMG I WAS PLAYING AND X LIFE MOD AND I HEARD THE BABY GIGGLE EEE!!! IT WAS A FLAT WORLD IN A VILLAGE!
Did anyone else notice a kinda like audio change at 9:34 ?  Edit:I don’t mean this in a bad way your videos make my day whenever you post :D
The "weee" when Lizzie fell 😭
awee that was so cool I never knew the end had all these freakin cool places
oh! i know! you can build a floating end platform with a waterfall flowing down to the ground!
Somone is a floran in the smp too
🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸💮💮💮💮💮💮💮
Katherine is also a Floran
your bilds are butifull
Is it maybe an idea to make a custom texture of the pumpkin your wearing. I think that would look much better.
Welcome to the old times, baby.
Hi LDShadowLady
Lizzie is flammable so she can't see Joel 🤣
I love the new origin but still miss the raccon origin
Yessss!
Joey and his baby shulk is the cutest thing ever
highlight of my day: AwW bAby sHulK!
Just like Katherine
please add a floral crown it will look so cute!
I love your new hous is so beautiful🌹🏵️🌺
Your floran outfit is adorable Lizzie! It suits you so much!
Everything is awesome but don't forget the small gang club please
I now your not going to reply lizzie but I love all your videos so much and iloveyou to the best best YouTuber in the world
That sound Joey made when he got the baby shulker.
I'm sorry but whenever Lizzie talked about the entrance, my brain kept saying,"end-trance"
FLORAN LIZZIE FOR THE WIN!
"There are no chickens in the end!" *throws egg* "There are still no chickens in the end." 😂
You should make advertisment in the over world! Like signs! <3
oohh lizzie you should get some pets like a wolf or cat or end animals
I love ur vids♥
i never knew the end was this pretty
when she caught the end fish it got me dying “cAn I cAtCh iT? AuOhH I cAn CatCh iT!”
lizzie you should add a villager market stall near the flower shop
I LOVED THIS <3
I LOVE UR NEW AESTHETIC
Who else is thinking of the wyvern layer from shadow craft?
Lizzie try to get some trees from the end and plant it next to your shop and maybe get sapplings of the tree and sell it in your shop
Miss the Racoon but i like the end Lizzie better
I swear to god Lizzie you got the best mods! You have to tell me where to get them!
Lizzie you can change the pumpkin to look pretty
hello ISABELLA (if you watched encanto you would get the joke)
The new skin is so pretty
I love the BetterEnd mod. It makes the End breathtaking.
I’ve been studying all of your episodes really hard to find out what your mod pack is so identified a few mods in this episode better end and biomes you go also I think you have biomes o plenty and in your raccoon house you used the chisel mod
Wow Lizzy, this is so cute! I especially love the end-trance xd
Lizzie ur the best and  um  yeah I love all your videos    Waiting for the  next  part   Love ya!!
I Love how  joey was so happy When he saw sholk he was so cute
This is amazing! Also thanks for letting me know planting a tree and flower gives a better chance of a beehive! I never knew that! Candle making will be so much easier now!
Ahhhh, you and Katherine are twinning now!!
Oh noooooo
Omg such a nice role
Ĺol these trying times
Lizzie is so cute as an floran so I would like to say DON'T DIE TRIYING TO GET RARE FLOWERS GOT IT   PS: sory for yelling Lizzie
Oh nooo I loved the raccoon life
i love your new outfit it fits you well very much it's sooooo pastel and cute
I like how you try to leave the game when your attacked
the 'exuse me; got me giggling
SINCE WHEN WERE THERE PINK TREES IN THE END
I诺他 古城发一下给他
When I was at school,I bet to my friend that if Lizzy dies,she’ll get Floran.  Guess what? *It happened.*
*boops like button*
Aaaaa CUTE and a tiny bit suicidal  This is on brand
Humy is just still sitting there waiting for his raccoon master to return- 😭
i love you
Is it just me or your binge watching every and I mean EVERY one of Lizzie’s series at 1:50 In the morning while also spontaneously watching Dora the explorer while reciting random facts you know that are very unnecessary but interesting while trying to do all the tongue ties you know while being dehydrated and laughing so much you can’t breath but your friend hung up on the phone so now your lonely so you dance to the Dora theme song while watching Lizzie but you got a new hair cut and look like Dora so now you go by Dora and this took you a whole 2 minutes to write out but now it’s 1:52 in the morning and your watching Lizzie now it’s 1:53 and your watching Lizzie on Saturday march 19th which you though was the 18th but you remember that you don’t have a sleep schedule so u just stay up and u look at ur self in the mirror then you realize that ur looking at yourself and start contemplating everything,how the world works, if your really adopted or your sibling was lying. Then u remember that u have Dora for u and ur Latin bestie calls u so u screen share and watch Lizzie together in silence then u say good bye to them and never hang up so ur just sitting there in an endless void of silence then u wheeze and then u look at the time oh look it’s 1:56 now so u hang up and call ur other friend but they don’t answer so u contemplate going up stairs for snacks and food but u remember u have 2 other people and 3 loud dogs in the house so u sit in your bed starving,dehydrated,lonely,messed up sleep, phone dead but then u remember ur watching Lizzie and forget what happened just now. Oh look it’s 1:58
Lizzie I think it would be a great idea to maybe be able to make a spawn point from the over world to the end or make bridges since you can fall in the void  also prettiest biomes in the entire game 😊
This reminded me of the good old crazy craft and one life days, Lizzy spending an episode collecting cool and random flowers
You should retexture the pumpkin head, so it's much cuter!
You should add a little dark color on your skin because your the endfloran
Ur the same as Katherine!
Can you cover someone's house 🏘️ in flowers💐 then give them a stack of gold and a new house 🤑🌺🌸
Helloooo! I have a suggestion for you:D You could make an end farm for ender pearls ( for your business because they are scarce) and a end flower farm for you business:D Ok bye bye!
Amazing and funny like always I love your videos ldshadowlady!♥️❤️
Your so cool Lizzie
Nooooooo I loved racoon lizzie I'm so sad! 😥
This is the best series I´ve ever watched c:
Does anybody else find the moment with joey a bit cute? Him saying baby shulk made me so happy
Hey Lizzie! U should also charge people for ur growing abilities(but only on end plants)
your the same as katherine cool!
If you get like one of those tables for flowers you can make the pumpkin have a cute face and (I think) a different colour
OMl the over world sucks lol im get this mod and livei n the end !¬!
Number 3 on trending yesse
You should build pretty bridges covered with vines and plants  between  the biomes in the end
i feel so bad for lizzie :(
Lizzy to not die make a burrior  :) (also no trouble)
You can make a botany's table and make your carved pumkin cuter
Love your new origin greenhouse and the market and everyting
omg your Floran outfit looks like one of those old Strawberry Shortcake doll outfits 😭 it’s so cute
I loved this episodeeee
Im still sad theres no more raccon lizzie
this is so cool
It's ok Lizzie your floarn powers are awsome Ur raccoon power was meaning other people are scared of you  We love you Lizzie💕🌺
Nice episode!
I randomly remembered this channel, it makes me so happy! (I'm going to every channel I used to watch).
love the vibe that the pumpkin head adds lol
Kathrine is a Floran too!
I love the end shader pack !!!!!
I like your new home but it needs some work done to it like make more flowers to and some crystal on the roof
Can you do something with you to keep on doing empires
“He.. told.. me! that the life, of my dreams! Would be promised, and some day be miine~”                                                                                                                                                          -Isabella madrigal
So Lizzie is practically Isabella madrigal because ✨✨✨✨ 1.she make flowers, plants ,etc 2.she perfect 3.she is like pink [it in one of Isa colour schemes]
Well this is definitely a HUGE change in scenery. 😂 can’t wait to see how this continues
Lizzy how about customize your pumkin it doesnt suit your outfit lmao
Omg her fit for her Origin is soooo cute
I didn’t know u had better end mod on or that there could be two floral thing-ys
THE FLORAN SIBLINGS WILL RISE
Lizzie take your time to post more btw I love your videos<3
I LOVE YOU LDSHADOWLADY YOUR MY FAVORITE I SUBCRIBED I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!
I'm really sad that Lizzie died I really liked her raccoon life
I love your vids
I love u
Since joel has taken your baby shulker you can put the ender dragon face on the top front . It would be like the dragon is comming from the shop. And also ender dragon head is very popular. It can take the attention of the people to your shop
U should retecture the pumpkin into a hat
I never knew the end could be this pretty 😍
Jesus is coming please share this message. ✞❤️
“I FEEL” said olly “BABY SHULK” once said joey
Lizzie, please, O PLEASE get a pair of elytra, you won't regret it.
Can you...     Make ur episodes longer Lizzie?
Oh this reminds me of ex life😭
mod name
I loved this epesode so much!! You really took the challange and moved your base to end. I love it!!! There are other really cool pumpkins that I have seen others use, maybe you use those instead of the plain vanilla ones??
These videos come out so fast- wow!
Ur powers is the same like katherine! Also u should build a bee place so u can survive with the honey!
NEW LIFEEEE
I want you to change that "Cute skin"into a more fluourescent,dark skin.Just like the End
I love this episode!!!!!!!!!!
I adore the angle you’re taking with this new life! I also really really wanna play in this modpack with friends
Lizzie: pink and Rainboow!
She was a tiny raccoon that is so cute then in to a human flower😃
Your skins are so adorable😭
Me at first when she said she is a floran: *Ah yes your isabela from encanto!*
YASSSSS
you have the same Origin as Katherine tho; I thought people couldn’t have the same origin
The end in this mod is like a beautiful fever dream. I love it
you can thank me for this theory because raccoon Lizzie just CANNOT die…: ok hi hello uhm so when raccoon Lizzie went into the end,she underestimated it’s powers and she lost her animal ability and turned into a human because yk,the end isn’t a normal realm,it’s not the overworld so obviously it’s magic since it’s a different dimension. and she became a floran as raccoons are animals :))
I love lizzie's videos lizzie if your seeing this you are amazing
You left you’re pet human back at you’re old home
the lillypads remind me of the last series
It's very sad you died but I love your new origin also you should make a pink tulip house with a mini tulip field
You'll always be are favorite raccoon queen <3
I am not subscribe to your voice
The tables of the government have turned, minecraftia is now offically the minecraftian communist party, we are at war against anime now.
Yooooo av ben waiting for this yayyyyyyyy
What mod makes the Origins and can you only get it on PC and what mod makes the end have all those plants and blocks
Hi lizzie can you please find an animal and name it blossiara for me
You should build a mall for people to buy things from you and they pay you with anything you want
O.M.G!?
I love how joey and sausage are just talking about lizzie going into the end and then lizzie just ignoring them and going on with the adventure 😭
Can u make more?
Lizzie you should use the floral table to make your pumpkin head pink!!
I can’t believe Lizzie was about to “DIE” again! Lizzie has a death wish!
Ooh I like this more than the raccoon Lizzie xox 🌈🌺✨❤️🍀
Question WITCH MOD IS THIS?!?!
You sholdnt have 64 dirt and flower and spling if you lost the bee have
Lizzie your so inspirational I love it thanks for making videos for us
Put a texture on the pumpkin head that looks like your head so when you're like filling your videos it looks like you're wearing not a pumpkin at all
hey LDSHADOWLADY👋 how life over there
You’re outfit is adorable!😁and so are the plants, I wish that they grew in real life🤩
I just LOVE IT 💖
this was my fav episode ( even tho lizzie died ) we will never forget that tragical accident
OH MY GOSH, YOUR AVATAR IS ADORABLEEEEEE
After this sight from the end... The normal end looks boring common Minecraft, add some vegetation to the end how many of you all want better looking ends??
shimmy, shimmy :D
I finally watched your new video when it came out
bAbY sHuLk
She should sell pumpkins in her shop some people come to the end they won't have to worry about the Enderman
Lizzie you make everyones day. Your theme is cute and why dont you build a little kawaii version of a bee abd a flower. That would be really cute.
I think you should plant a few overworld trees in the end it would be great for those who live in the end and need a house you can make them give you stuff you want
the end with mods is so mithcal
What mod is that to get all those flowers in the end
seeing lizzie as a floran erases my sorrow of her first death
U just have to be cearful so u dont fall in the void again
This was amazing 🤩
Everyone thought you were a bee not a floren
Lizzie team up with katherine she has a shop it's called fruits foods and woods or something like that you both can team up bc she has the same origin as you and pls go back to the overworld
Olli just zomed out
what mod or mod pack are you all using? im in love with the end and i would love to try
Katherine has the same origin
Goodbye Humie you shall forever be remembered as the first and favourite villager
I though raccon lizzie was my fav but floran is so cool!   I would love to see a love story between the blazeborn and the floran Imagine a third florqn is born and they form a sister hood floran squqd xd
“there are still no chickens in the end” PLSSSSS😭😭✋🏻
the endtrance :D
You almost got a new origin lol
I knew it that lizzy wound be a floran base on the leaks
I thought you were about to die when you looked at the enderman or got poisoned
Lizzie you don’t have to concur a new word                   I take it back
longer eps plzzzzzz
I saw gem got better pumpkins maybe wear that
I LOVE UR VIDEOS !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I highly request you to start a new season of crazycraft  ty.
In the end it reminded me of when tommyinit, ranboo, gogy and philza made a video in the end. =] ily
you can build your house floting on water👁👄👁
I was literally SCREAMING when I saw those mushrooms- ADORABLEE EEEEEEEEE
Haven’t you learned that you died here
Its ok lizzie can still meet joel right-
i know it would be floran
omg love the gift
So excited for episode 5
Haha okay i love what you got ahhhh your kathrine 2
Lizzie try retexturing the pumkin so it matches your outfit so you dont have to wear an ugly pumkin on your head   Plzzz notice me lizzie
11:53 an endtrance 😆
Katherine and you are the same origin
Lizzie! hello how are you today?!? I have a suggestion for you! you should sell pumpkin heads at the entrance to the end. Make a nice big pumpkin farm! maybe some pumpkin pie on the side? Joel bring her some cows and chickens!
If only the real end looked this beautiful…
yay
I'm not going to lie..I saw this origin as more Lizzie than racoon. I hope she keeps this one for the rest of the series <3
Lol it always scares me when lizzie runs on the one block bridges! I think u should make it a little wider so It will be safer, u can also make a bridge to all the end biomes u have seen till now.  Lovely house btw Its soo beautiful😊
ahhhh wear the pink pumpkin with the :3 face! that would be so cute lol! <3 can’t wait till your next video!
Wow that End Mod really changes it up!! For once I’m in love with the end
LIZZIEEEEE , HIIIII , MY HOME PAGE IS UR ANIMEEEEE , also why not build a castle and a whole platform of shops like a plaza so u can sell other end things and also UR SO AMAZINGGGG
The new outfit is so cute!!!!!
lizzie's colonisation arc
i miss the raccoon lizzie q_q
baby shulk!!!!
For a sec i was like u gonna live in the end but ive omly seen the vinala end this end Is SO pretty. 🌸
Lizzies new outfit is so cute^v^
I drew Floral LDshadowlady and I love it I gave her kinda of a Hannah Rose vibe
Hi, just wanted to let you know that you helped me get through my life a lot and helped me through hard times, so thank you even though it wasn't intentional! I also have a very fun idea that you should do a shadowcraft 3.0! (just a question ,_, )  :)
Raccoon Lizzie may be gone but she will forever be with us in spirit  especially since she died in the end.
Yes a new afterlife yaaaaaaaaaaaaay😄😄
you should put a barrel with pumpkins in next to your staircase into the end
Im getting isabella encanto vibes with her.
OHH :( No more racoon
love this lizzie! love you so glad theres fun smps for you to play again!!!
Ah! The old outfit! I love it
N-no raccoon 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺
What days are you posting?
I. Love. This Eeeee!! Amazing Lizzie!!
Hey love your vid’s ❤️ if I were you I would make some cute bridges from your house to the other biomes that coordinate to the colour of the biome
.
Make your new house in the end
Build a pink house for you and your flowers
PLS mek mor video iy love it
Lizzie! You should make a texture pack for your pumpkin hat so that it look something that cooperates with your outfit like hermits do!
you can make cuter pumpkins with potanians workbench(if I write the name right 😅)
Omg I really love the custom end and the build look awsm
I mean,i was KINDA right abt my bee theory was i?
NOOOOOOOOOO YOU'R NOT THE RACCOON ANYMORE     rest in trash 🦝
Isn’t ironic that Katherine was Queen/empress of house Blossom and now she is a floran.  (I think I spelt it right)
Test in piece: racoon lizzie
lizzie can i join after life
Learn more on Kathrine ✨
U have the same
9 hour late :(
gemitay ecscped the room she escaped
Mabey you should take the flowers out of the barrels do noone steals them? Also you could make a network of rainbow crystals for your house ( like the bees? )  The end was the right place to go. Elderflorien = a florin born in the end! Now that you can write, one could make a catalog in the book about all things ender??
The fact that Lizzy almost died again 😂🥲😭
End garden would be fantastic . Please do it Lizzie
Hi I watched your videos for so long I love your channel  your content is amazing
After this i totally didn't make an end house in minecraft :'3
:0 end floren amazing cant wait for next episode!
“Baby Shulk?” ~Shulk (Joey Graceffa) 2022
FIND A PET IN THE END <3
👇this is how many people noticed Katherine and Lizzie have the same origen
You should make a railway going through all your favorite biomes.
Your Kathrin 2.0 lol shes also a floran

End Floran a cute title
YOU NEED THE PURPLE  JACK-O’-LANTERN ITS SO CUTE!!!! You could wear it!! I think? 😊😄

aww man why did it had to end
Fun fact: lizzies new skin leaked
I love this new style but i am going to miss the raccon lizzie
omg your skin is sooooooooooo cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sas you can't be athe raccon queen anymore but your still our Raccon QUEEN FROM HEART!
You should totally build a flower shop in the over world and sell flowers and plants
Lizzie is the best content creator /youtuber for me
The skin in the thumbnail is so adorable omg

I love how on all the different servers Lizzie and everyone else always make shops
I love Lizzies skin i mite have to still  Lizzie skin😂
Omg she has the same power as Katherine- I love her outfit. This is such a good series!
Make a business with kathrine
I think you need to make a house in the pink biome :)
Ohhhhh
Everything I see of Joey is just precious. The way he says shulk, how he gets scared alone, being a body guard, the way he just cooed over the baby shulk. I better go and watch his Afterlife series as well.
Lizzie I have an genius idea how about every four episodes you get a new character so three more episodes and you’ll get a new character and I am your biggest fan I can’t believe you’ve never even Noticed one of my comments hi I said happy birthday in your comments for days before your actual birthday and I’ve been so close to you because the day you start a YouTube I was born I looked up to you so much for so long
It was so Funny when Oil said don't do that my brothers get mad or smt Also Love u lizzie :3 I really love your Videos Happy Late St. Paticks day Mwah :D
I justaccidently scraped my scab off and it was bleeding but this made me feel better :3
The end flowers look like a fairy forest! The perfect place for Floren Lizzie
1:07 that skin seems familiar 😏🤨..its from x-life when she BRUTALLY MURDURERED jack 👍
All the cute biomes in the end remind me of this show called "Star Darlings"
No one: me at the store grabbing everything i can
The bees have a great honour of feeding the Floren Queens Lizzie And Katherine
She needs to sell pumpkin heads and have some buckets of water on hand…
thats katherens power
I love her new look
You and Katherine have the same origine
Lizzy, I love this! I coudlnt imagine a new origin on you after a racoon but this Is amazing! I love how you used the End in such a creative way. Love it
NdFloran lady cuz you pronounse n like en so its like endfloranlady
If a chose the enderian origin my skin is already half enderman
you should've called the stair case a endtrance
You don't know how much my cat loves you whenever she hears your intro she'd be running towards me
Hey Lizzie you guys should change the Minecraft hearts in to the color of your origin
I lovet it
Is the end biomes a mod or is it in game?

CONDRATS ON TRENDINGGG (*^▽^*)
This was AWESOME!!!!! I LOVE your videos 🌱🍄✨🌸
5th time rewatching this video
I saw peple play so i New you are a bee!
You should put complimentary pumpkins in your shop or next to the entrance for people who don't have them, that way they will be less scared & more inclined to visit the end!
💐🌹🥀🌺🌷🪷🌸💮🏵️🌻🌼🌱🌿🍄☘️🍀🪴🌳🌲
lizzie big fan of you im a girl btw im on my dads account pls  💗 my comment
You can re- exture the pumpkin head to a tiara or a bow.. Etc....  🤩
This video was so epic i couldn't bee leave it
I see you've gotten a friend fish, so here's some name ideas;  Iris  Abyss  Blue Raspberry   Fate  Lilypad
You forget your mending books
Lizzie should take her old stuff from her og house then burn it down
Omg LDSHADOWLADY your number 3 on trending for gaming!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Congratulations though you deserve number one
I miss raccoon lady but I LOVE the end floran!!!!!
This origin suits Lizzie - also what mods are you using!? SO FRICKIN CUTE! <3
I love the shop!
the smp should make a farmers market and you can build a shop and sell end plants in exchange for honey bottles and other things and then you can have two shops which means double the prophets
Hello-oh there all asleep 😂😂
"there are no chicken in end, there are still no chicken in end." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is the end pretier then the overworld? I love it!!
Has anyone thought of shark boy and lava girl yet :o
R.I.P
Wait did Fwhip kill Jimmy and lizzie by accident?
She is so chaotic 😂
Am i a bit late to watch Pretty Ldshadowlady's Videos To Make Me Happy By The Way Im Not a Boy Im A Girl Im not a Lesbian. 🍋💫💛🍌
Right when you said i have something for you i got and add to buy a phone
Lizzy said “ima go live in the end” At first I was freaking out. Then I remembered she’s a pro.
This gives me My Neighbor Totoro vibes but in The End jahsgsgsg love it so much
My lady that's so beautiful😍 I like the all biomes your the best floren ever  it's so magical ✨✨
How do you make new skins? I want to make a new skin for my channel

The end is so beautiful! best place to live
I kinda want Lizzie to like redesign the pumpkin on her head to like a cute mask if that is possible-
Fun Fact: When i saw ep 3's end i completely forgot she will get a new origin until I saw The mythical sausage's video 🤦🏻‍♀️😂💜🤍
if there were those trees were in the end i would life there to ever body would
At first I thought it was really sad that she’s not a raccoon anymore but now I’m like obsessed with this new thing
Lizzie's gotta build some cute bridges between islands, I get so nervous watching her hop across the 1 block wide paths haha
my favorite line in this video is just..  ‘ baby shulky ^w^ ‘
Lizzie,u should open an exotic flower shop and  sell them for gem or more flowers I hope u do this because u can make alot of gems,more flowers ,etc and u could build ur shop in the end!!
KATHRINE IS HAVING THE SAME

Ender Fin the Ender fish :)
i love your skin so cute!
You should  alliance with Catherine
Oh your just like Katherine!!
Cell Woods for three diamonds and stock up some under flowers
Lizzie: “end entrance” Me: an ENDtrance 👀
lizzie had two one-life series that lasted for multiple months and now she can barely survive 3 episodes 😭
I am so sad that she is not a racoon anymore

rip racoon ldshadowlady
Comments: expand your house expand your house LDshadowlady: seriously just seriously
Ngl, I really hope that there will be a Minecraft update that puts the end biomes in the mod to the actual game
The end is sooo awesome!
This is nice but I want you do have a RACCOON LIZZIE SIDE THAT SOMETIMES RANDOMLY POPS OUT HAHA MAKE THAT HAPPEN TO EVERYONE THAT DIDED LET THERE PAST SELF POP OUT SOMETIMES

Lizzie you should go to Oli's house, wear a pumpkin to freak him out and place blocks and signs it would be so funny
Looks like someone has a twin
I am waiting for Floran Lizzie fanart, guys.
love this episode <3
Lmao leave it to Lizzie to find a way to make a business in a Minecraft smp
All those amazing End Plants and bioms! 🤩🤩🤩 As someone who is currently End busting to try and find an Elytra, I'd love to get lost in all of this wonderment, instead of slogging through the barren yellow rocks and pop fruits.
Petition for Lizzie to sing "What Else can I do" from Encanto
you should make a floren meeting place for Katherine and you
Ep. 5 pleaseee
You should retexture the pumpkin!
If you end up makeing your own house plz make a terraeaom cuz your a plant woman
So you are a Floran like Katherine
I Don´t remember who but someone has the same oragin
Lizzie is just so so creative and brave cuz she made a house in the end and even went to the end. If i was in the end i would die the second i went in there 😂😂
I'm still really sad that you're not a racoon anymore😭
Can you make another one tomorrow
Loving the chaos!

Lizzie became Isabella from encanto
lizzie: gives joey a product without getting anything in return lizzie: business is BOOMING
I love your mods!!
I love the flower Stall and the greenhouse is beautiful!
you should live in a giant mushroom that naturally spawns!! or make the ender dragon pillars connected to make your house!
i love the video
AAAAAAAAAAA the end is so prettyyy
ISABELA YOUR BOYFRIEND'S HEREE-
Noo stop ending the Video when I start to get COMFY. XD lol .  these are great and make me laugh I think I like the raccoon Lizzie better but i also like the new one!
Whats the biomes mod youre using?
[Tip] if you keep eye on enderman its wont move
get a resource pack that makes your pumpkin kawaii and all flower-y
Your videos make me feel much better in this rough time for me My dog got put down 11 days ago from cancer and a fluid in his lungs Poor boy was only 4 :( I know it's for the best, but I can't get over him  💔
I loved Raccoon Lizzie but I think Florian Lizzie will be so cool
SHE'S A RAINWING FROM WINGS OF FIRE THEY USE PHOTOSENSITIVE                    Sorry for caps also bad spelling (if I got anything wrong)
That End Dimension is so pretty - not gonna lie. The fact that you easily found a way to pretty up the place and live there without much difficulty is amazing!
You killing Jack was one of my favorite X Life moments, so I love how you brought the skin back.
Wait can two people get the same origin?
Can I join ur smp???🥺
If you’re going to have an epiphany could you do it elsewhere
Joey is a Himbo
Like that you use the end as a base. Because most of the people live in the overworld.
Build an end tower with plants growing all over it
you should make a texture pack for the pumpkin on your head to look like a space helmet :)
Fun Fact: No One Misses Lizzie's Videos
Lizzie: Or I could live in this lake, on a lily pad Me: Memory’s…I mean Lizzie does’n’t remember but we do 😅
adore u
7 hrs ago,nice
I can’t stop thinking about how it’s almost like you saw your future last episode when you came across that beautiful mysterious flower biome while trying to find the portal
ah there is no internet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The end is way better than I remember
Life is a walk in the end looking for mushrooms on logs
how bout selling some pumpkin for protection from the endermans
I’ll Live you
Most amazing everything
I love your vid
I'm pretty sure lizzie has made a new friend in the end
2:13 lol
you should make bridges to travel around the end such as to your house!! it’ll look so cute!
Ur isbella
Hi Lizzie I love the videos you create and I hope to see more!
This gives me avatar vibes
Read the same origin of Catherine now
Her and katherine same powee
I think all of the plants that you’re selling is beautiful
It was funny how the ender man almost killed you
aghhh i hope lizzie never dies with this origin!!! Its so unique and cute!
You should put a chest of pumpkin heads so they don’t die in the shop
love the vids lizie keep up the great work
Gg
You should build your starter base in-between the pond and the pink biome
Build your house a tree house because it's cute or build a green house.😃
i was always scared for if she would die... my dre- well nightmare? came true

This is such a fun smp. This definitely is one of my favorite next to one life and x life.
13:09 it would really be funny if someone animates this 😭😭
I think you could do I tecsure pack for the pumpkin so it can look better
I just realize joey is a shulk meaning he is a shulker and a end person and oli is an end person too and the only 2 people that visit your shop
i guess you could say its an end-trance 🤪🤪

Raccoon Lizzie 2022 - 2022 Suffocated in the void  May she rest in pepperonis
Aha! I guessed correctly! Your skin is so cute <33
This was an amazing episode... you have some really great comedic timing.
The Fact that Lizzie and Katherine are now Flower Sisters
Joel also has a shop
Hey you got Katherines origin
Hey, Lizzie you should make a bridges so you can cross faster to other places.
How did you get the mod?
you should live in a giant end flower or tree, since they are so beautiful and would go greatly with your origin
that "Oh-..." when the sun was going down. It was amazing 😭🤣✨
I love your oufit
I think oli needs to live there with you
So your Groot?
I like u better as a raccoon :
Lizzie the end looks good and all but it's really dangerous What if ur customers gets hurt
im living for the Ender-Florian vibe!! like a casted out Florian from the overworld that now thrives as a dark mystic Florian? very much here for it!
Does anyone know the mod for that cool end??
CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE A PART 2 !
Pink plant life brings bacc the cute Lizzy
5:17 Lizzie showed me the most beautiful biome! Btw the part when Lizzie wrote bye cruel overworld and Joel said *NO LIZZIE* *DON'T DO IT* was just ( I don't have words for it xp)
I love how everyone entering just goes "Hello....? 😨😨"
I mis her raccoon days 😔
u literally jumped off the end lmfao
Lizzie, you and Katherine should keep a flower festival or a partnership shop
The end is beautiful. Lizzie, you have great taste. <3
Mmmmooorrr
Wouldn't it be funny if lizzie actually died again
omg lizzie this is so good! hope u dont die from endermen 😂
You should try a floating island thing were you grow plants from different biomes!
Omg the biomes in the end world! I never knew they existed 🙀 I loved this video, Thankyou Lizzie :))))
You need a roof garden!
Is anybody gonna talk about the chat when lizzie went in the end?-
You should make a village! It would be good for trading and cool to see a flower villqge
OH MY GOD I LOVE RHIS ,,END FLORAN LIZZIE !!
end+entrance=EnDtrAncE
Sorry if I spam a bit btw I wanna leave suggestions but I doubt I will you get a ton of attention
All hail the baby shulk
You got #4 on trending thats actually amazing congrats
Lizzi you should add some of the pink vines under little end plant form and make it glowK
Lizzie now: Yes, I am a graceful flower woman. Lizzie then:TrAsH pAnDa!!!

I leve this mod and the end mobs are amazing!! The og end is boring but this mod gives it life :D
You need a attraction so you get more sales lol. Marketing
She is living my dream Minecraft world THE MUSHROOMS 😭💀✨ I need the mod now….
At first when I heard Lizzie was gonna be living in the end, I was like. Oh boy. I don’t think a florin would do that :/ But now it’s perfect! And it really spices things up and looks ✨amazing✨
Lizzie, when a customer buys something, they can just grow their own in their own house..
Lizzie don’t you mean End-trance 😂
You should try a spa !
I’m watching this again like all her videos I just realised that’s the same skin from x life!
Lizzie you are isabella from encanto
Lizzie house is so wonder ful i wish she could be my friend who do you think is the best biulder katherine or lizzie
It's so odd knowing what the endermen are saying and hearing them speaking over eachother so often
11:58 i guess you could call it the ENDtrance... ok i'll leave now
You should work on the elevator area for the end!
LIZZY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING MY CHILDHOOD
Those end biomes are just ENCHANTING! I'm definitely adding this to my modded world!
You should try to make some big crystals
I Beg you lizzie please make yourself a bee shop where you sell stuff bee related like honey bees and stuff. Big fan BTW <3
You need some pink trees around! They would look so cute!
Your have a twin
You need to fence off the edge so people don't fall
I feel like Lizzie missed an opportunity to call her stair case the end-trance
I love how oli stayed true to his enderman origins when he couldnt see lizzie😭
You should make a bakery with flower cakes! It could be another way to get over world stuff
Omg lizzie is so extra, living in the end haha I'm excited to watch this play out!
Which origin do you like more, raccoon or a floran
Lizze always comes up with unique and amazing ideas... I would have never thought of making my base in the end😅
It's so cute that joel is like a fire, destruction guy and lizzie is a nature lady Edit: after watching the video it's even more cute that they are both from different worlds not belonging to the overworld
Just watching you go through all the end biomes reminds me of the plants in Nausicaa's fungi garden in Nausicaa of the Valley of the wind! If you ever wanted to create a sort of lab/garden where you can study the end plants, you should definitely take a look at Nausicaa of the valley of the wind for inspiration! Thanks for making such fun videos to watch :D
What mods are you using
What is the biome mod you're using?? Everything looks so cool!
You should sell pumpkins out in the end for people visiting
Lizzie's friends begging her to not go to the end  again is so funny
You should add more sunflower things there really cute
You should add a pond full of lily pads next to your house and put ender fish in it
You should add bridges to each island in the end so you won’t fall and it will still look cute
You should re skin some stuff to where there's more flowery things
You should try and make some floating ship shops near your home! It could match the theme of your house and have vines growing off it!
Rest in peace racoon lizzie, you will not be forgotten
You should also make a mushroom farm from overworld nether and ender and have like a variety mixed up
awee its so cute the way Lizzie said 'Catherine will love these!' in every small detail she remembers someone special to her
I want to live there.
I see a pattern, everyone is starting to die on their third episode.
You should make a life tree! You should add different plants on and around it and have leaves of all kinds and colors! You should also make the pumpkin head like a thing where you re skin and it's flowers and mushrooms all over your face
Lizzie you should do a texture pack that makes the carved pumpkin into a flower crown
Bring humi
I CAN'T WAIT FOR A OTHER EPISODE SO EXCITED AHHHHH THE END IS SO COOL
oh no
So flicking amethys was right?
this is so cool. please dont die and stay at the end
im cackling 😭 this woman almost died AGAIN
is it just me who thinks that joel and lizzie are literally like hades and persephone... joel being some scary creature from a dark world and lizzie being able to grow life venturing into dark worlds.. oh and theyre both chaotic
Awe no more climbing  walls?
Build a cobblestone generater
Part five please
i know you wont reply but what texture packs do you use I love the way the world looks and all the little plants if you don't mind can you tell
LIZZIE IS JUST LIKE PERSEPHONE OMG?! I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!! "GODDESS OF SPRING" BECOMES THE QUEEN OF THE UNDERWORLD!!!
Rip raccoon Lizzie.
I love your new outfit Butts I miss your Raccoon outfit
Lizzie what are you gonna do wity your old house?
The way we gasped at the same time at the first end biome
NOoo she's not a raccon anymore!
The End is more beautiful than I thought.
I can't believe the first thing she did after becoming a character that thrives in light and water was move to the end 😭😭 I love her
Oh my God I forgot the YouTuber but what are Youtubers has the same origin
O I just love it
What i think that would be very cool is if lizzie was conanocally extremaly tall
Hey Lizzie! Joel discovered that you can bottle butterflies, and I think it would be really cool if you somehow used them in your house!
You should go to the overworld and make people buy York crystals and I mean your flowers and they can get you can get whatever you want if people buy them
Ur Isabella from enconto now
OMGG
I have been waiting for a new ep finally
I love your vids
WHAT MOD IS THIS FOR THE END?! IS THIS EVEN A MOD? I LOVE IT! IF IT'S NOT A MOD HOW DO WE GET IT?!
Katherine: Stay in the sun. Lizzie: Actually, I was thinking I go.. To the end. Where there is no sun. Or animals. Or bees. Or ores.. or anything...
I think I might love this this more then the raccoon
your new life is like Katherines life being a Floran yay
Katherine and lizzies powers are the same
This is great! Joel is selling things from the Nether snd you're selling things from the end.
Ldshadowlady can you make a flower work shop
you should build bridges to the other islands in the end !!
UGH THIS IS THE LASTEST I'VE EVER BEEN TO A LDSHOWADLADY VIDEO USUALLY YOU POST AROUND WHEN I GET OUT OF SCHOOL BUT I DIDN'T CHECK NOW I'M 6 HOURS LATE 😭
OMG AHHH I WANNA SCREAM!
Who knew the end could be so pretty
if ever you’re going to build a shop you should build abandoned raccoon house but overgrown with so many vines omg i already love imagining
The Better End mods is prolly the best mod for
“There are no chickens in the end.”   *throws egg*  “There are still no chickens in the end.”
I died when Joey said “baby shulk” at the end-
Joel is a blaze.. oh no this isn't gonna end well 😥
Omg sooo cute!!! I wish they had that in vanilla Minecraft 😂.
I think my mom likes my bro more then me aka the fav child and when it happens I always watch Lizzie it helps me smile
rest in piece raccoon girl. she'll forever be missed
i was hoping she would make a greenhouse for her bees and make herself her own house made out of some of the cute wood from the end
Can you post more frequently please
**freakish cottagecore mushroom fangirl noises**
11:15 This is where people will *end* up  haha get it?
Can you make a swampy flower house  Edit: and bee sanctuary
This so so fun I love how she lives in a new dimension
Why do you have to die 😭😭😭😭😭
WAIT lizzies outfit gives me strawberry cheesecake princess i think is the name
How did you get the other disk
NEVER LEAVE THE END!!!!!
Your like kathrine
Omg i love your channel Liz plz make more vids and can i  have a shout out
Congrats for number 3 on trending 👏
i luv ur new origin and i miss the raccoon origin
Lizzie: Oh look a dragon head!  Me: isn't there only 1 on the whole server- HUH? I- 💀
OH MY GOD LIZZIE ALMOST DIED AGAIN
(Don’t mean to be rude) but Lizzie’s power is like Katherine’s and it’s kinda funny how they have the same power!
Oh all we need is the Florian of the nether so then there can be the three-dimensional Florian sisters
the end city dimension reminds me of Mariposa  Anyone agree with me?😀
You brought so much wood
When I saw your outfit from a sneak peak from someone else, I guessed Floren. I said "She's gonna be a Floren! Here and Katherine are gonna be the same!!"
If only the end was actually that cool
Here we are....The End Florian: LdShadowLady I have to draw a poster         Yaaassss
BYEE not Lizzie's little shimmy in the boat
You should live with kathrine!
If fwhip didn't spawn on the spot you were staying on you would not have died and while fighting the dragon he killed seapeakay and he murdered jimmy with cold blood but got killed by gem's golem.
it was the last day of the school for me and im happy to start this devine day with afterlife smp video
What about Humie?
The new house is so cute!!! it's bittersweet changing origins cuz they're both so cool. much love <3
I can't wait for the next episode
I was wondering why she would want to live in the end. Now i see why <3
The end is so cute, also now joel and lizzie is the king and queen of the nether and the end
omg i was worried ur going to die again phew lol
YESS LIZZIE POP OFFFF
Hey Lizzie I think it's best if you made a wall so that your customers won't be killed by Endermans
I love the End in this mod hahaha i would totally make everything with these resources
You have the same origin with katherine 😊
Lizzyyy What a nice dance,.😏
She shall be missed
i MUST find out the name of the mod that makes the End this ridiculously beautiful
The flower power fits lizzie’s aesthetic actually! Joey said end queen XD  I thought Oli was gonna break into a song!
Lizzy is like Isabella from encanto
:)
I love the choice to live in the end, it really makes for a fun series!!
Your new origin is SO CUTE!!! 💕💕🍄🍄✨
RIP Raccoon Lizzie Ep1-Ep 3
There’s jelly in your mod pack!!!
I whant that mod
It looks like Lizzie jumped off the plate form in the end
imagine making a base like the room of isabella from encanto
I wonder if the modded carved pumpkins can be worn..
How do you keep coming with such great and creative ideas?! I soo admire youu
Hi lizzie try not to I die again
i honestly LIVE for lizzie being a floran like slayyy queennn
Let me finish drawing racoon Lizzie and then I’ll draw Floran Lizzie
So could you put like the link for like the mod so you can put on our own Minecraft also I think you should do a cottage mushroom goth themed house
I will boop the like button :D
You can use the Chipped Mod Botanists Bench to turn your pumpkin head pink!
"Look man if you're gonna have a epiphany can you do it else where" Had me laughing so hard. HAHAHA too good
O! That’s the mod that silver used for his video
I love your videos and there are two flower lady in there smp!!!!
Lizzie went for the "What kills you makes you stronger" quote me if I'm wrong 🤗
Waiting for ep 5!
I love how her origin is kinda the same a Katherine 🤣
I love the end with that mod it's beautiful. You are a great end florin.
i was like not sure abt the idea of living in the end but omg the end is so prettyyy
I cant wait to see your next episode but I do miss racoon lizzie Well. IM READY FOR THE NEXT EP
Lizzie just missed the opportunity to call it the 'ENDTRANCE'
The Enderman be like " Flash Sale " charge the shop keeper 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So cute
"awhhh babby shulk🥺" its tO CuTE
WOOO YOU UPLOADED
Kathriene has the same origin as you lol
Can you make a farm  With animals  And bring some CATS 🐈🐱
Joey is such a beautiful person
I am in love with this series..the second this episode ended .. I started crying ans saying ' why have u taken this amazingly beautiful series' episode away from me
I feel like it might make sense to sell and grow pumpkins, because the shop is next to the entrance, people without them would like it, and you’d have spares in case yours got lost.
00:29 that little "weee" is so adorable.
That is katherines origin LOL
U died because you didn't crouch
I loved Racoon Lizy but I think I love Flower Lizy even more.
bee our guest 🐝 🍯
Ohh Lizzie u should also change the texter pack of you pumpkin to be a flower hat! it would be so cute p.s LOVE your videos
The flower is a myth.   Im a modder.  Looked at the code.   It's 5% for oak trees, no flower check.     And... hmmm..  no biome check.  You may be able to get natural bees hives from oral trees in the End.     Think I'll test with 100 trees.
I think we can all agree that Lizzie is one of the best builder/designers in minecraft out there
The end of your first life made me so sad
Lol
If the real end is like that i would love. To die and live there
14:22  Me: omg deal with destiny part 2? No….ok😭 sorry I just really miss empires  (Afterlife is so good so far tho!!! I’m obsessed to see more!)
You should use a botanist table to make your pumpkin look cute so you look fashionable in a pumpkin! Great video lizzie!.
OMGG I LOVE PLANTS AND FLOWERS!!<3 I love you and Katherine's afterlife creature!!✨
Im pretty sure lizzie is working on a lore, i guess we will never know whats gonna happen
This episode gives off Landarium vibes, and I'm here for it.
Joey said Golden goose egg it reminded me of empires
Hey Lizzie and Katherine Have the Same Origin
Yay!!!!
"now I am highly flammable"  but how will you kiss your husband the blazeborn D:
lets be real, lizzie was all of our childhood's
14:43 KILLED ME. Joeys “OH”
Love your new origin and shop, very cool
15:08 LIZZIE U PASSED UP UR OPPERTUNITY TO SAY UR FLOWER MARKET IS BLOOMING
Lizze's power is same as Kathrine's power (sorry if there is any spelling mistake)
You should name the shop Floran Fortunes
I miss base invaders ):
Lizzie what happens if you fall
10 bucks lizzie is going to die by falling off the void again
This gives me isabela vibes
Yeyyyyy new post
Lizzie u got to make a plant pot for a home it would look so cute then u could decorate it like those big caves were everything is over grown with plants edit: and u should make the dirt brown glass
Nooo! She’s not a raccoon anymore 😭 I love ur vids Lizzie! ♥️
Just imagining you dying your first day of your new Origin
You can carve the pumpkin into something cuter with the florist bench!
I love that you upload more frequently for afterlife and it makes me so happy to see your videos! Glad to see that you are more motivated
SHE IS THE ORANGE PUMPKIN
SHE IS THE ORANGE PUMPKIN
SHE IS THE ORANGE PUMPKIN
it would be cool to see the two florians be rivals
Lizzy clearly hasn't moved on from her raccoon faze. Not able to sleep because of origin to not able to sleep because of dimension.
You should make a skin for your pumpkin head
Build a cottage in the end or a club for the people from the end
The whole Florian and blazeborn Lizzie and Joel have reminds me of Persephone and hades hehe
Lizzie i like when your in the boat and dances it look so cute
This is absolutely amazing! My favourite origin out of all of the other players! I need this end mod!
Lizzie! You can use a Botany table to change the look of your pumpkin head to something way cuter if you want!
i now need these mods the end is so pretty... if you know the mod please tell me ;-;
13:57-13:59 Oli:you have brought beauty back to my life LDshadowlady Lizzie: look man, if you're going to have an epiphany can you go do it else where?
That is so good lizzie can you make a house but look like a ship but pink and purple
Oh gosh lizzie please don't die your home looks gorgeous, Also I love your end-trance looks gorgeous
I'm obsessed with the end! I can't wait for the next episode :D
Lizzie is persephone🥺🥺
2:16
WHATS THE MODS WILL YOU TELL US ?
I love your bee house thing 🥺🥺
Katherine watching this: damn I wish my home was there all those plants.
Yay now u and Kathrine match origins
Sad,sad,sad,R.I.P Racoun Lizzie
I love how Lizzie always picks the most dangerous biomes or places where people would be to afraido go to live at lol
Hi you are so nice and pretty
you are Floran kathrine's sister
You can help Katherine at her shop!
I love it!
There are no chickens in the end! There are still no chickens in the end. 🤣
13:55 that ended me🤣
The modded End looks amazing, but it's a little overwhelming to be honest. I'd like to get used to it though!
R.I.P Lizzies raccoon life🦝
Lizzy PLEASE build a mushroom castle!!!!
If I lived in the end I would be very lonely no one else lives there
I'm wondering are all the Biomes in the Origins Mod or are they another mod in general?
do you know how to read now?
Frloren
Yay
Yay new power for lizzie
The way Lizzie was about to get another origin 😂😂😂
Damn, this just goes to show that the end is in desperate need of a major update, like the nether update
The literal opposite power of Joel when it comes to water and fire
Omg imagine if she didn’t log off. All that work as a Florian for nothing
Hi lizzie! I know you might not see this but recently I’ve been going through a hard time at home and at school, watching this new series and re-watching some others distract me from whats going on, you mean a lot to me lizzie you are really funny and energetic and it cheers me up <3 Thank u for everything you do
Whqts that flower mod?
11:54 Endtrance
LOVE YOU LD❤️^^
Wait how did everyone get out of the end?
Hey Lizzie ur cute and Mary is cute and your family is perfect and I always watch ur video  again and again I love ur video's Lizzie❤️
R.I.P Racoon Lizzy you will be missed :(
You and katherine can be BFFs for after life. Btw I love your new power
Woaah what if you do like a tour for the overworld people, idk maybe build sum on each end biome? Maybe a building that contains facts about the biome and its own special plants and flowers? this way you CAN ROB THE OVERWORLD PEOPL- jk this way you can get overworld things 2x faster?:p idk just an idea of my sleep deprived mind
Aw u died!?!
who gonna pick up trash now?
Hi
0:30 did u guys noticed that someone pushed lizzie to the void??? Since she was crouching that means she can't fall on the void on Purpose so that the rest of them can kill the ender dragon for her, someone has killed our raccoon queen!!!
lizzy theres tons of texture packs that could make ur pumpkin look cute! i suggest looking on planet minecraft
will there ever be a mod list?
I just lost some very important in my life so this video makes me cheer up😔🙂
You should make a tavern! You can sell flowers and drinks, it would be cool
All hail the End Floran Lizzie
AHAHAHAH THE LAST EPISODE WAS SOO FUNNY I CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS
I love joey’s origin so muucchhhh
OMG THAT ONE VIDEO I WATCHED WAS RIGHT
Ld shadow lady you shood work with Katherine
A new type of florian
these biomes had me SCREAMINGGGG THEYRE SO PRETYYYY OMG
Lizzie should add a texture to the pumpkin because it just doesn't match her aesthetic
Well, Joey’s a father now.
LOL she is so cute 😍😆
😱 ANOTHER BONEMEAL IN THE SERVER😱😱
I am sorry that you fell in the void.
I saw a Video about someone talking about the Skin change guess they where right
0:30 wee
Day 3 of asking lizzy to say hi ♡
im too early but still too late
Katherine is a Floran to!
She has Katherine's oragin
I absolutely love this series even more, even though you and Katherine have the same origin, i like how you did the opposite of what youd expect a floran to do, the end is beautiful!
THIS EPISODE IS ABSULUTELY AMAZING!! I LOVE IT!!🍄🌱
LMAO HOW DID I MISS AN EPISODE
There are no chickens in the end!- there are still no chickens in the end...
The fact where Ldshadowlady forgot about katherine
I think you should build bridges that connects the end islands
Lizzie: Maybe I could live here! In the lake, with the lilypads.  Me: having flashbacks of Empires SMP, when she was the ocean queen  Also me: YOU SHOULD TOTALLY LIVE THERE- oh wait- that biome is pretty too-
You should make your floran skin purple and have end flowers on it because well you live in the end
You must have hit him in the water, it gives him more damage because of one of your abilities
Oh no omg I missed raccoon Lizzie but now we got 2 Florans
Fun fact, the mushrooms that grow on the side of logs are actually real! They are called polypores, I think, and they are really pretty! They aren't usually brightly coloured, but they are still pretty cool!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh
Floran is katherines too!
How happy Joey is when he gets the bay shulk at 15:10 is so wholesome… except that it’s dead
Yeah I would try to live in the end too if it looked that pretty
your the best
Why i like your racon form ill just watch your racon videos 2000m times😭😭😭😭😭😭♥️
SHE BE DOIN THE SHIMMEY IN THE BOAT
Lizzie is the icon she's the moment and most importantly she's the villian 😌
Hey Lizzie! I have a little suggestion for your pumpkin head incase u want it to look cute or smth, but what if you retextured it into a mask? Like a flower eye mask! That would probably look cute. But it would probably make the pumpkin look weird... so Idk if it would work, anyways love your videos! <3
What about Katherine
*Beeeeeutiful bees*
Plz post more
Shulk tough boy for me XD
mods?
13:17 IM DEAD THE WAY LIZZIE SCRAMED 😂😂
No one is mentioning how she almost died a second time 😭
Congratulations  on being 3 on trending
She and Katherine are twins!
2:13 fAther when can I leave to be on my oooOown ~
Ooo
you should take some stuff from you're House, and build flying land , -Sorry it is hard to keep up with the words because i'm Mongolia and 10 year old, how do i going to know every single words in English huh?! but i loved you're new origin love ya ♡♡♡♡
What mods do you use!!?!?!?!?!??
I wish I could be on this server my family doesn't do mods so it's definitely less exciting than everything you and Joel do
When Lizzie posts, it makes our day <3
You should start an smp where you only live in the end/nether  called end life and nether life
Cool
It seems like you got the same power as katherine! Such nice friends ahh
2:13 😂😂
Lizzie living in the end kinda reminds me of when her and Seapekay got stuck in the end when she was trying to rescue Zodiac! When they were saved it was a Christmas miracle!
What is the mod?
I’ve been waiting for this all day ! <3
When I saw the pink vines my mind when’s to Isabella immediately
I LOVE FLOWER LIZZIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh I just watched ur vid more and u already know 😀😗😅
Ldshadowlady I'm a huge fan I wanted to tell u that katherine is also a floran
I cant believe most of us thought Lizze was a bee
Id think it’d be cool if she uses one of those things that came with the one of the mods they used for the server to make her pumpkin head a different color (Ex: Like the pink pumpkins Gem used for her house)
go to Katherine's and tell her you have the same organ
she has to join katherine in her shop now.
this video is so good like this new series just started and it already amazing
What mod pack is this it's sooo cute! Love your vids!!
I hope the new Lizzie never dies, like the floran end Lizzie is so coolll
Lizzie should make a special song for every time she does the shimmy shimmy 🤣
The music in that disc was adorable!! >w<
When I saw the ththumbnail I was like florannnnnnnnn yayyyyyyyy7y
Dying was worth after all, i mean somebody else would have occupied the beautiful end if Lizzie didn't died
I love you're videos
You have the same origin as katherine
Hey girl! Congrats on #3 trending, love the series! <3
Even though Lizzie was the person who got some people killed in the end including herself,it's so wholesome to see her with the other origans getting along
:00000 now there is two Florans Katharine and Lizzie
I can’t wait to see an alien flower Lizzie ✨✨
The ‘aww babeh shulk line’ brings me so much joy
you and kathrine are flower sisters now!!!!!
The RP element in your videos is so unique and it’s great! I’m gonna miss the raccoon but I’m here for the florist
I wish that u could make a enchanted lake because of the flowers
Plot twist she dies again i really liked the video alo i've been watching ever since the crazy craft series but i didnt have a youtube account then-
LDShadowLady I whatche your video 3 times!
I was waiting for this for so long!!!!!!😩😩😩
Okay i think I like this better than raccoon and the settlement area!
Can we just appreciate how Lizzie lived in the end for that long and had only one incident.
Before I watched the third episode I had a dream where you died and your next life was a giraffe
I love your intro especially the catsq
ah yes the end folarn
TL;DR: LDIsabellaLady
CALL IT THE END-TRANCE PLEASE LIZZIEEEEEEEEEE
You will be a great new floran!
Never been so excited this much
TWINNNSSS
I've honestly been waiting for your episode 🙂. I almost cried when I watched you fall. 😢
The end is breathtakingly beautiful.
Katherine is not alone 😊
Oh holy Jesus Christ-   Lizzie and Kathrine = BoneMeal Duo  But if someone dies.. No more BoneMeal Duo 😔
Mythicalsausage is the one who kill the ender dragon the most
Lizzie you now need to surround your shop with exotic trees 🌲
I BIOMES IN THE END ARE GORGEOUS
omg Lizzie you could sell complimentary pumpkin heads for anyone who comes to your shop! AND I think you could make your house either look like one of the trees from the end or have layers of the different biomes/ plants! <3
Lizze what happens to your old house from when you were a racoon? Love your vids
lmao  "There are no chickens in the end." *Throws egg* "There are STILL no chickens in the end."
Ur like katherine shes also a floren
The better nether contains lots of mushrooms and instead of the pink vines they’re blue and white
I love how Oli was having a moment and Lizzie was just like “NOPE”
Make cute bridges to the other islands
Lizzie the End queen and Joel the Nether King- absolutely perfect
you and oli should both live in the end and maybe joey too since hes a shulker and make like a cute village
You're flower shop and bee greenhouse is beautiful. Might need a rig though
I loveeeeee I mean loveeeeeeeee you vidssss!!
Katherine And Lizzie :>
yas
Now you abd Katherine had. The same power
So cute the Florence is even better tan the raccoon never go back to the overworld! Never!
Ok so I keep haveing this sort of feeling like something wrong or I am being watch OUT OF NO WHERE but I got on you tube saw this vid clicked it and I don't know how but it fixed me teach me your ways
I would love to join that world!
from a raccoon who's better at night to a floran who depends on the sun-  but ofc our end floran won't be a sunsimp and stay in the end
Omg the end mod is literally the best, it’s amazing!
Lizzie cant realy die at the end couse only enderman and shulkers
wait- why is the end so pretty
I was sad when she died because I was really looking forward to her raccoon storyline. But Lizzie has a way of just making every new experience entertaining.
baby shulk🥺🥺🥺
Woah that end place os soooo cooooooooool
I always look forward to your videos!!🥰😍
That end flower mod i need it whats it called please
Lizzie, you are my comfort isolation YouTuber. Thank you!
End entrance? How about ✨end-trance✨
wow imagine if the vanilla end actually had this many biomes, that would be awesome!
i have an idea of a thing you can do, you can fix the bridges that connect the end islands and make it rlly cute (idk but maybe add a roof over it and add some of the cute hanging vines)
Everyone: DONT ENTER THE END!   Lizzie: I live there
I love the end biomes they are so beautiful😍 but I wish lizzie's new skin had a flower crown to really suit her flower origin😭
You should make another song in this series pls
no but why did you jump when you first went to the end ;-;
Wait yuor wave katherine s pawer just like I imagine 😀😀🌾🌷🌸🌹🌻🌺🌼
Now our floran kathrien has now a twin💖
Awesome video!! =D
And give a free pumpkin with purchase
lol lizzie's series are the best because she;'s always so risky
Is she gonna have another deal with destiny
Me when I saw the thumbnail: shes a Florian.
I love you videos
Wow posted 4 hours ago!
Lizze yuor power is much better then the ader one the racoon 😅😅😉🔜
I have been watching every single thing sense like 2020
Nothing like starting a new leaf
WE LOVE THE END FLORAN <3
Lizzie is an icon and my role model >3
What mods are in this series?
There's a botany table that let's you change up plants and it makes some really cool jack-o-lanterns. Idk if you can wear them but they look really cool so it's worth a shot
That was  BEUTIFUL
Hey can u post vids earlier cause your vids are really good
Megan hiding in the shadows waiting to strike
I.LOVE.THIS.EP!!!!!
Is it just me or is her floral outfit the same one that she wore when she killed jack in X life?
Lizzie cosplayers be like: ok normal sailor Lizzie  Nvm fish lizzie Nvm again raccoon Lizzie  NVM. FLOWER LIZZIE!
Love you in the end world! Such a good idea to go there
Omg you and Katherine are the same!
Omg lizzie I guess your  power no way love it 💜💙❤️
I know there a way to build a portal in the end island to make traveling to and from the over world much easier then running all the way back to the main island
I’m sad you lost the raccoon butttt now you can be a ✨Recycling service✨
Wow
who else yelled hooray when Shadowlady died? probably just me
while i love your new floran skin, maybe you can gradually change it as you go further into the series by adding some "end themes" to it since you're living in the end and all :0 like the "flowers of the end" are slowly transforming you uwu
Aaahhhh no more lil racoon but hey it the new mother nature's 😍😍😍 Ps; please don't again or maybe miss Lizzie can reset origin for something new 🤗
I hope lizzie returns to her old base and redoes the inside of it to fit other origins...
I really love raccoon 🦝🦝🦝
did anyone else think oli was about to burst into song?
Holy shi- Lizzie became Isabella Madrigal
your abandoning humy!
the real question is does she even have a house? and I want to see katherine in the end
As someone who's played a LOT of origins as a floran, I can safely say, only an absolute lunatic would settle in the end as a floran...  Lizzie, you're either the bravest player I've ever seen, or the most impulsive
I'm sure gonna miss the cute racoon lizzie, she's so cute. Without a racoon, who would collect the GaRbAgE T.T But I love how you choose an extra ordinary place such as the end, who knows what beauty awaits for floran lizzie to discover. I love your shop, it's so preety, if I were in the episode, I would probably pay 10 diamonds for 2 types of plant💕 the disc is so beautiful, it's best disc I ever heard
Lizzie's crystal house looked amazingly similar to a greenhouse I once built when I was in an SMP! That's so cool 😳
By the way great vid leave a like an subsribe also leave a time Stamp if you think it’s dum Lizzys no longer a racoon
🌼🌸🌷💐🌼🌸🌷💐
you should have punched joey in the water so you did 8 hearts!
The technical difficulties will never not be funny.
Lizzie is the good chaotic energy that I need in my life 😭😭😭
Wow
Why you kill racoon
I love that you decided to stay in the end! The end is so beautiful omg I wanna play with this mod
2 FLORANS make a floran club with katherine  and and ask to work at her shop
Omg Does anyone know what mod they are using? The neither is so beautiful🤗🥺💞🤍
You should sell elytra too HAHAHAHA btw lizzie is really chaotic.. she's supposed to be in the place where it has a sun but no she goes to the end HAHAHHA also it's a good thing she never take down her raccoon origin's house, i hope no one will gonna sneak there and take her past things
You should make pretty paths from biome to biome in the end! It'll be gorgeous!
What mod did you use for the end?  It's so pretty!😍
rest in peace raccoon lizzie ✋😔💔
Should have punched Joey while you were in the water 🤣
you dont post a video everyday /:but its ok..
Am I allowed to say that the anime Lizzie at the end card is hot
You should make a skin for the pumpkin
New lifeeeeeeeee
Honestly, I like this origin way more than the Raccoon one! I never knew you could find such cool things in the end! I love it!!!
what about ollie is he not ur friend
Hi
THE “yea ok…) FROM OLI THOUGH XD LMAO
Did anyone else realize that lizzie actually jumped off and didnt "fall" off
The End is a really beautiful place in this mod.. can't wait to see what Lizzie does in her 2nd life!
I love the uk
The end biome is so pretty!!! The Florian life will certainly be wonderful
I'm die I ng for the next episode
In only 3 episodes you died normally you live a lot longer
The End looks so cool in this world 😱❤️
Lizzie sees mushrooms : “they remind me of Meghan” Shelby : eternal crying
I'm still drawing her as a raccoon and saying she's a raccoon idc
Lizzie Madrigal- (SHE REMINDS ME OF ISABELA MADRIGAL)
Lizzie the thallasium thing is the equivalent to iron in the end :)
okay but why can you kinda tell she jumped...(no hate ily and i love your new origin Lizzie<33)
Why is the sky in the end white?its black right?
Love your new power Lizzie! It matches so much to your personality sweet,caring and adorable 💕
it’s funny that orionsound and Shulk went first in the end because if you think about it orionsound is a enderman and shulk is a shulk
Hahaha lizzie dying from hwr own evil idea classic lol
Maybe she should add the texture that makes the pumpkin invisible so she doesn't have to take it off!
You should do some bridges on each world
Please make more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your enemy is now Joel as he is to hot
The song was very pretty 🤣
There’s 2 Florans on the server now
GOD bless you all 🙏
It looks like Ollie and you are. family friends
Baby shulk.
Katherine is a Floran too!!
I love it
Hiiiiiii
OMG LIZZIE LOOKS SO CUTE IN TYAT DRESS
That boat dance shall forever be known as the shadow shimmy.
the end is so cute
YES
I'm really sad that Lizzie isn't our little raccoon anymore, but it's great to have another Florin sister!
i love your videos
let’s hope this fish doesn’t follow in the tracks of orphan fish from uhhhh one life i wanna say idk
ok oli likes the tentacles 👀
YES! We've waited long enough for this video
Two florian now yessss im excited
Not the shaking
GONE NOW FLOWER LADY also Orion is funny
sorry posted that before watching
I like how Joey said baby sholk
I like how lizzie took the end. I didn't know the mods their using make it so pretty. Next time, you should make a little flower garden and put stuff like your end fish there.
Oohhhhhh maybe you could turn your skin kinda end-themed like your old kingdoms skin! Maybe it could be because of so long in the end, you’ll be turning all bioluminescent and end-y! I think that could be super neat!!!!! :D
“shulk not scared.😰 shulk tough boy😥”
end-entrance? more like endtrance
Ld Are You Online? I Got To Tell You…
I’ve been waiting for this since the cliffhanger of their death.! Let’s see what you got~!
katheren's a florian too
omg the end is so beautiful
You should add a flower crown to your new outfit
This entire end makes me think of Squiddo’s video where she explored the end with no guide whatsoever and built Claire’s but significantly less chaotic
Okay yeah i love this!
I saw in the vid you were getting around to the different biomes on the little skinny bridges and I thought for another episode, you could build really majestic bridges so when people come to visit you or youre just exploring, you would have a safer and pretty way of getting around :)
hey lizzy there are more plants in the betterend mod, try exploring more also im certain others would love to buy some end saplings if possible!
I miss racoon Lizzie sm 😫😭 but I also rrly like floran Lizzie! So ig it's a win win! But Lizzie question-  What's gonna happen to your old house 🙂..
Please make "End puns" while you're in the End dimension XD
THAT BIOM IS BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow a new life
Hey LDShadowLady what mad is this? I know it's origins but what exact mod is it because I am in love with the biomes!!! Thank you! Love your channel!  :)
I think fwip accidentally pushed you lizzie
Lizzies little dance in the beginning is so cute
WHAT is the mod/mods your using for the end I NEED to know (I’m sure it’s listed somewhere I just can’t find it)
You should start a Flower Shop !
Katherine’s new sibling?!?!? 🙀
We shan now call you LDplantLady
i think u should find an elytra just so if u slipped on the void again u could fly back and not die
Hello, Lizzie  With the gardener's table you can customize your pumpkin heads to have different shapes and patterns.
I WAS HOPING SOMEONE WOULD LIVE IN THE END OR NETHER IT LOOKS SO PRETTY THERE!
I love this you make a good floran
ENDTRANCE
It would be nice if Lizzie builds a larger house in the next video
Ldshadowlady please try out crafting and building its just like mine craft you just add a texture pack which is already there, hope you like it!!<3
"Ooo, there are no chickens in the end!",  "Oh, there are still no chickens in the end." (😂LOL😂)
It’s sad that the raccoon house has been abandoned
No more racoooooooooon 😭😭😭😭😭
🌸Flower Lady Lizzie🌸
Lizzie i love the idea of living in the end and the pumpkin head fits so well! Such a great series so far per usual!!
"these vines are so cute" all of a sudden why am I blinf
Hiiiiiiiiiiii
Never in my life I’ve seen anyone live in the end and this will be one of the most incredible series I will see in this journey of Lizzy! I am very excited ✨✨
Omg Lizzies dress is so cute I want one!!
It's cool that the origins that are from the end came to Lizzie's shop
Lizzie discovers the beauty of the end
Anyone know what mods do they use??
I love how in the beginning of the vid I was like “she should make a market for the special end plants” then she made a market 😀
Raccon woman
Lizzie i think u should see Gemini she can make u a cute pink pumpkin that would make u cuter ♡💕
Lizzie, please build safer bridges across to the different islands so you don't fall into the void again!
I won't breath until Lizzie notices me
Do not end the series fast
𝓦𝓱𝓸 𝓮𝓵𝓼𝓮 𝓳𝓾𝓼𝓽 𝓵𝓸𝓿𝓮𝓼 𝓵𝓭 𝓬𝓸𝓷𝓽𝓮𝓷𝓽
Why is nobody talking about Joey being so cute with the "baby shulk" like my heart omg
She's now Isabella
Weeeeee 🤣😂😆
I luv this series ♥️
I’m gonna miss the collection of everyone’s ✨GaRbAgE✨ But I like Lizzie new Origin Edit : The outfit is so cute
Wait your new skin is the old skin you used to kill jacksucks in a gingerbread house in x life ep 21
You should build another studio ghibli house in the end!!
The end is definitely the most BEAUTIFUL world in minecraft
The “oh excuse me “ while oli (orionsound ) went over the table had me dying of laughter
Not lizzie snatching kathrine's wig
Can u pls make a mushroom house and put mooshrooms in their and some Bees pls!?
I know this wasn’t your fault you died but when you fell in the void I noticed you jumped? But I think it’s an accident. Keep the vids up!
Hi
I love this End mod! How do I get it, what is it called, and how did you get rid of the pumpkin head in first person view!?! 😊
RIP Raccoon Lizzie. Floran Lizzie is already looking amazing - The End needed you!
Can someone give me a list of mods they use in this server?
At the cost of 1 dead shulk
Then he mightve not wanted baby shulk cuz he died and u got free goose egg
I think maybe in the next episode if you have a pet from the end try naming it enderina and you should try making a house with all different biomes for example in each room there will be a mini version of the biomes!!
Now you and Katherine has the same origin
if we pair up both series after life and empires then Lizzie and Joel then we add them parents with rules such as no falling in love with a blazeborn and no falling in love with the ocean family we would get a forbidden love story since Lizzie used to be the ocean queen maybe we could go back in time where she was younger and she is a princess soon to be queen and Joel is soon to be king of blaze maybe??
You have the same thing as Katherine  Elizabeth gaming
I have a question, why didnt u hit shulk 3 times as the deal? u mightve murdered shulk but u would definitrly win!
You should make a honey garden filled with bees sand and lots of plant and a waterfall
That house is amazing just like Lizzy!
new life and Lizzie almost died yet again
oh no there's no more garbage
I won't be shocked if Lizzie will have another song number with Scott
Curiosity killed the cat. No, tricksterness killed the racoon.
Can you make a pink house with flowers around? I don't know if you would like it but I feel like it's a good idea
I LOVE THIS (not to mention my favorite place is the end)
The end is so beautiful I bet everyone is jelly
Ayy 2 floran
Weeee 🤣
What if you live inside a rainbow flower
Aw man I'm 3 hrs late
(:
Stay in the; the sun is your best friend   THE SUN IS GOING AWAY
When lizzie said "i have something that is for u" and a ad about cars shown up😂
SMP OMGGGGGGGG% FU*K
It’s an ✨endtrance✨
This makes me wanna play Minecraft so bad but I deleted it for storage;-;
Thera are still no chicken in the end
Lizzie the fact that kinda u killed ur self cuz no one hited u  you just fall off
You should make a mushroom house/ garden
whats the name of this mod??????
Are thoses strawberry on her dress?
Hey Lizzie, you should make a nice safe entrance from where you spawn in the end to the end portal so no one can get attacked and also keep a barrel of pumpkin heads at the little entrance so it's safe.
Mincraft conspiracy: bees are on.y this big so you can see them and not hit them by accident
Hello! Lizzie I was just wondering what your favorite animal is?
lizzie and joel are like persephone and hades 🥺
LIZZIE, YOU HAVE JUST FOUND PANDORA FROM AVATAR IN MINECRAFT!!
the end is so PrEtTy OMG I think when I get minecraft I might never leave the end when I make it there  omg I love it and the greenhouse
Missed pun "Looks like my flower market is already blooming"
Its my birth day today nad it got 10x better when you posted this vid!
i love it !
Im really confused and surprised that there are no mobs in the end except for the enderman and that one fish-
It’s been years since I’ve seen your vids and I randomly get a recommendation for this new series. Been binging it today and I can’t believe the theme song is still the same which is cool
I love the fact that lizzy's new origin is the exact opposite of joel's xD
YOU AND KATHRYN HAVE THE SAME POWERRRR
Hey my element is alora aka the "Nothen Lights".
The end Florian !
Omg it sucks that I don’t see the notifications when you post??? 😣
you could build bridges to another island to make it cuter and safer
Imagine lizzie got the giant role and couldn't fit in her house!
Random fact but when this was posted like when it was only an hour out I already made some headcanons & some fan art -
i like the thought of lizzie and joel’s relationship with these origins—a florist living in the end who burns easily but thrives in water, and a blazeborn that cant get wet but is strong when on fire. their opposite origins are super interesting to me lol
katherine: stay in the sun, it's your friend lizzie: overworld sucks
When it said i have something good for you it said pantin
I wS like she's gonna die again pls stop the race yu got so far beautiful be careful
Lizzie: *dies in the end* Also lizzie: MY NEW HOME!
Katherine and Lizzie, the bonemeal people 😻⁉️
when she said wears i got a flashback of empires
DID YOU DIE!!????
Hi lizzie!
You should’ve used your water super powers
You should also sell pumpkins for people to put on
Lizzie you should definitely build a castle in the end that is covered with all the beautiful plants of the end! So that your title as the End Floran Queen fits! 💓 All hail the Floran Queen Katherine of the overworld, and the Floran Queen Lizzie of the end. 🌺 🌸Like so she see's this!!! <3
I love after life so much
LOVE YOU LIZZIE!!
I wish I was in a modded minecraft world so I could life in the end
I love the idea of living in the end! You've found such a great home to live in, And now we have two Florans!
the modded end biomes are absolutely gorgeous! i’m loving this series so much and i can’t wait to see what you do next as a floran!
What mods are used please tell me
This is so exciting! And I love how the place your old self died is also the place the new you was born! ❤🌿 Also, I loved the fact that Oli "couldn't see you" 'cause of the pumpkin hahaha that was amazing, it took me a sec to get it, 10/10 <33
I literally love how as soon as the song plays he goes all dramatic
This origin suites you to be honest
OMG the wait for this was so long! :p  BTW, I would probably put water with slab paths around the "entrance to the end" to limit the available spawns of the endermen. (I doubt many of the guests will be wearing pumpkins)
THE END IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO PREEEETY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just i gonna say RIP racoon
I was waiting for someone to make a base in the END it sooooo PRETTTTYYY...Thank you
Does anyone else think that the previously lizzie said at the beginning was similar to the one from "The Big Bang Theory" like it just sounded so similar.
Ngl thought lizzie died on purpose as like a cool plot twist
Every day I go on to see if you have posted more after life bc I LOVE you videos and every content you do!
Raid her house in the overworld.
Long live Queen of the end!
The trade with Joey was cute. Even if you did punch the Shulk xD
Raid the end city to get a diamond and they is wood in the end.
LIZZIE WHY IN END I MEAN ITS CUTE BUT VERY DANGERUS🥲🥲🥲😟😟😟
Dear Lizzie it would be a cool idea to put a chest full of pumpkins in it so when players want to buy ur wares they won't get hurt by the endermen
Can you use a botanist bench to make your pumpkin cute?
Lizzy. I feel like u just wanted to have a cool death
That’s Katherine’s power
What’s the mod she used to make the end so pretty!! I totally need to become a little end scavenger! :)
so very lovely, queen of the end lizzie
You should put a chest full of pumpkin heads by the entrance for visitors
Lizzie could make a killing by selling pretty carved pumpkins to her panicking visitors. There's a lot of nice variants in this mod. 🎃
when lizzie and joel post videos at the same time  me: *stresssssss noisess*
i want to download this it looks so cute
lizzie is actually like kathrine now
i love it
Anyone else want a whole mincraft series were everyone is a different animal? Lizzie could live out her raccon dreams!
Use the botanists work bench and can change the color and style of you pumpkin!
5:17 omg its so beautiful i want it ahhhhh
you should talk to Scott he has lots of cool nether plants i think you would like!!
YAYY NEW AFTERLIFE
I💗U
I love your green house
Someone needs to make a "End florian" fanart of lizzie.
I honestly love the better nether and end mod and seeing them in the afterlife smp just makes me so happy thank you oh amazing creators
Hi
YOUR LIKE Kathryn
I thought you were going to be a bee, because of the beelocation advancment, but your a floran!
Ooooooooooh! Fun! You AND Katherine are Florens!
I lovee th song 🎵
I miss Raccoon Lizzie but florain Lizzie looks so cute!
I love you so much Lizzie your the best YouTube I watch 🌺🌸💐❤️❤️❤️❤️💕
take of ur pumpkin head
Hope you don’t die because your place is amazing
I love your greenhouse so much!!
gosh why the end bee's sleep in the end
I'm so glad she decided to do a shop in the End!!!!
the end biomes are so beautiful,  what is the name of this mod??
This is The best after life episode out of everybody’s after life everybody’s it is the best
Ldshadowlady has become  the end flower lady
As an enthusiast of exotic and carnivorous plants, I was wondering if anyone knows the mods used to make the End look that way? It's so euphoric!
i love your new origin ! and i’m so glad your posting more often, i love your videos lizzie !!  edit: you should edit your outfit to be like pumpkiny/ like the end because your living there now but flowery yk
Love how the first thought lizzy had when she became a plant was space capitalism
Since Lizzy isn't a raccoon anymore and doesn't eat people's garbage, maybe she can use the garbage as like, fertilizer and compost lol
RELEASE UR MODPACK 🙏
honestly you sound kind of spoiled just saying "oo those are pretty... I want it." but I know you are not I just found it funny
how does she have no pumpkin blur?
Hii
i think u should make a castle with rooms dedicated to different plants and stuff in the end.
Lizzie: Puts the music disc in~  Oli: Starts vibing~~
If only the end looked like that without mods
I love how when Lizzie sees something she likes she goes gimme
Queen of the END.🎉
“There are also these tentacles, not really my thing but I’m sure someone else will like them…”  My brain for no reason: Xornoth flashbacks
The question is, if she uses the botany bench to make the pumpkin cute, will it stay cute on her???
by looking at the thumbnail, im going to assume your a florian like kathrine
You got Catherine
Those flowers are gorgeous! And the greenhouse looks spot on
Her floral orgin almost ended so fast when those enderman charged at her lmfao
The fact that lizzie almost died again in one episode is comedy gold
If you’re a plant and you survive off only water and honey. Wouldn’t the bees as they adapt to the ends environment, make you also adapt to the environment? So, you wouldn’t like need any sun and and you and your bees would change to fit in with the end and its creatures. I don’t think end flowers have to wear pumpkins on their head to hide from Endermen. Also, whoever (or whatever) was living there, clearly had to adapt in someway to the End and the fish did too.
You should make a shop and sell the end flowers and etc but also you can pay for travel so if they go to you ,you don’t have to pay them but if you have to bring it to them them pay you with diamonds and honey bottles
Oml I'm so excited for when you build your home Ahhh the shulker head thing with joey was so wholesome 🥺
At some point when you run out of space you should build a giant cathedral with big stained glass windows!!! And like super angelic and even Greek mythology influences too!!!
I’m liking this! I loved the panda but this is adorable!
Kath and Liz are the same 🤩🤩🤩 this will make adorable fan art
Those tentacles remind me of zornoth
Lizzie and Katherine🤔
The effort tho… I could never 🤣 p.s hope you don’t die 🤍
End is too cute somtimes
I have a idea what if you interview your videos and say what you regret the most about what you did.
I love this new series so much. It's definitely making my isolation a lot better!
Could you release a modpack on curseforge that has all the mods in this series?
YAY IM PRETTY EARLY
oh my god i thought the series was all over omg thank goodness ;-;
I think you should put a chest of pumpkin heads by the portal so your guests arent intimidated by the townfolk
Monjang should actually add something like, cool, like biomes, in the end.
OMG!
The fact that i already knew straight away what Lizzie's origin because of the flowers.
Wonderful Wonderful! I will miss your raccoon life, But in this series, i know it will go on longer!
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii it’s  Annabelle o
Lizzie: Enters the portal  Everyone else: *ZJCNSJCNSJNXAKSJKANXKWNXOSNDDJ NOOŒ*
What if…you invite your floran friends to go to the end with you and check out ur stuff?
What if scott died and also have the floran origin and he manages the nether plants of course PLANT POWER!🌸🔥☄️
The Floran is my favorite origin! I’m so excited for this life!
I miss raccoon Lizzie =(
Also u know the movie encantó? Well lizzie u look like Isabella from encantó! Btw love u
i seek another deal with destiny
could someone please tell me how to get the mods lizzy has on the end??? Im trying to get into playing survival Minecraft and it would be cool to have them!
You made a FLOWER shop and sold a tentacle and a shulker head XD
😁😁😁😁😁the end was really pretty 👁👄👁
I'm curious, maybe you can use the botanist table to change the pumpkin head face?
pls name a bee. bumble PLEAAASEEE💗💗
Amazing
Endtrance
Oli feeling one with his homeland: Is this the song of my home world *climbs over counter* Lizzie: umm excuse me 😒🤨 😭😭
THIS IS LITERALLY THE MOST AMAZING THING IVE EVER SEEN.
Lizze the Floran garden Whisper of the End
The fact that it looks like she jumped off 😭😭
Awesome!
does anyone know what mods these are?
Oh my god they should actually add them to Minecraft because the plants are so beautiful in the end 🤩 like now player have another dimension to explore
WHAT IS THAT MOD PLEASE TELL ME I NEED IT!!!!!!😭🙏
Let’s go your twins with Katherineeeee
I need the end mod-
Such a cute house and stall!
This is so cute! I want all those mods so badly but I’m on bedrock so like- Hopefully soon I can get a good computer!
Lizzie: I am now going to live in the End  Me: Why would you do that its so ug-  *Poof*  Me: ...Okay
Ok the spirited away house was cute, BUT THIS. This is a thousand times better.
I died when she looked at the enderman
Nooooo I like the raccoon. ;(
when it comes to raccoon base, it could be worse. fwhip now has to deal with his own pillagers trying to kill him at his own base
"OH baby shulk :00!!"
your new power it's like Katherine's power😮😯😦😲
So cool I love the plants they so magical
You should make a store called sell the end and you sell enderpeals!
You should make bridges across all the biomes in the end so you can get home faster
i guess you could say your market is flourishing, or thriving like the grapes on the vine (i’m sorry)
no Lizzy pls go back to the overworld I don't want you to die so fast
Lizzie do you know that you can reroll 3 times.
I still wish the raccoon was still here
A rainbow bridge would be nice.
Lizzie and Kathrine are now flower twins
Love the outfit
Oh Enderman, why do you get mad when i look at you in our land? Are you.... Insecure~
Those end biomes ARE AWSOME :0
Can someone tell me what mod this is
Lizzie: Goodbye cruel world. Joey: Don't do it Lizzie!
I saw a bit doubtful ab lissie going to the end but then I remembered MODS
Hii
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ME AND MY FRIEND WERE WAITING FOR THIS VID!!! YAYYYYYY WOOOOOOOOO!
I wish those biomes were actually in Minecraft. Set all my dreams would come true!
Had a bit of a heart attack when Lizzie got attacked by the endermen. It’s pretty much like that every time she gets attacked and is unable to get away 😂😂
Somebody else is also that Origen
Lizzie and katherine are the same
How will she get sunlight
🆒
Love it
Finally the ep we've all been waiting for 😭
ALL THE BEAUTIFUL BIOMES MAKES ME SO EXCITED! i wish these were in regular Minecraft its just so beautiful. also so many ideas for lore and character building, like for example since Kathrine says the sun id your best friend and there's no sun in the end you could slowly be "corrupted" by the end, kind of like how she became the blue axo in ocean empire but instead of it being prophesized it happens naturally.
the floran skin is soooo pretty!
Where you ended this I was like noooo
Omg love the new skin 🤍🤍🤍
if lizzies gonna live in the end she should make a custom texture pack of the carved pumpkin on her head to make it fit her theme so she can look nice while living in the end
your soo lucky
By the way Lizzie, you can grow stuff my touching the ground!
Now you can BEE friends with the mushroom queen
Yesssss! Another episodeee!
Loving the series! Can't wait to see what else you'll be doing! 💙
As much asi miss Recorn lizzie, This mod is awsome! .the flowers are so beautiful!  💐 🌹 🌸 🏵 🌼
I love how lizzy always has such cute vibes in her builds with every series
OMGGGGGGGG I LOVE YOUR NEW ORIGIN LIZZIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE :'00000
That's the cutest house you ever built in your life or the video that I watch
Can you make a a flower shape house and a flowery path so if anybody want to visit you like joel and Katharine
Why did you have to go the end anyways???
In fact,THE WORLD IS TOO MEH FOR LIZZE.SHE LOVES THE END.
love how your likh kathrin
wow, just wow
YESSS!! I bet this floran life will turn out very cool and amazing!! I can't wait to discover the beautiful and mysterious plants brought from the end! I'm so e excited for another episode!!
Lizzie you should use the botanist bench on your pumpkin hat because there's some super cute variants like this pinkish one that would match your vibe perfectly
Love this series keep it going
Can you invite ItsFunneh and the Krew to the SMP
IF I GET THIS MOD IM LIVEING IN THE END .
lol, everyone thought she would be a bee
Lizzie! I really love all the mods they make this series a lot more exciting and interesting!! Do you mind listening down all the mods you guys use? Please id love that! :)) anyways that’s all love you Lizzie take care ❤️😊
I 'm just apriciting how much Lizzy doesn't want to sleep
Can you name the end fish moony
Why does the racoon origin fit you more😇
It's a hotel of bee's!!
Lizzie and Katherine flower people yay
Those biomes in the end remind me of the movie AVATAR by James Camren! It’s so cool!!
I love the biome’s in the end it’s kinda reminds me of that one avatar movie
U HAVE KATHERINES POWER!
of course shes one of the first to die
:O
well seems like Lizzie is still gonna call Joel "hot" to get things from the Nether
🌸I love this new origin Lizzie has! 🌺
11:57 call it the "ENDtrance"
IM SOOOO happy when Joey came to the end and Lizzie just says ugh what now and then she just says oh it’s you lol it made my day
Omg your end is just so gorgeous
I think you stole somebody's origin
LIZZIE U HAD ME SCREAMING AFTER THROWING THAT ENDER PEARL JUST TO GET THOSE FLOATING RED THINGIES
I love your new home!!!!!!
Rip raccoon lizze lol
That made me laugh so hard it brought a tear to my eye, Lizzie you have inspired me so much and your videos are the only thing that have kept me going ❤️ Thank you so much. ♡︎♡︎
Your like Katherine now! >V<
You shouldve said: "My flower shop is blooming"
I love this orgin
You should get another try to punch Joey, but do it in water O.o I'm curious to know how much damage you'd do
I kinda miss her old base 🥲
Now Lizzie is a twin with kathrine
Dont die again, im loving your new home
Who thinks Lizzie is gonna live in the end forever-
and then next episode lizzie has a bounty
Can we all agree that Lizzie is one of the best builders out there? Her builds are so creative and beautiful.
can you still wear the pumpkin head if you change the face. case you could wear a UWU pumpkin
What mod are those cool end biomes from?
Ldshadowlady is this empure season 2?
Ok here me out the more time lizzie spends in the end the more her skin starts to Corrupt into her surroundings of the end
Whatever origin you have Lizzie your outfit is so cute
do you have any recommendations on a new youtuber who is small with not many subscribers
2:29 ✨The flower girls✨
quick question when is empires smp season 2 coming out lizzie
I love that everything is so exiting and new in the end and I can’t wait to see you the new adventures and beautiful places Lizzie finds! I hope when Lizzie or if Lizzie dies again with hopefully won’t happen I rlly hope she stays in the end
its so fun watching others discover the wonders of the better end mod
I have a change get a wither rose and no just you or your going to die hahahhahahahah
You can retexture the pumpkin to make it fit in with your floral aesthetics
Poor trash panda.  Her life, cut too short.    P.S.  Put a For Sale sign up on your old house!
Love your videos
The death seems intentional to me...
So cute>!
Katherine and lizzie flower ladies
Seeing that one block brigde give me anxiety
Low-key need this mod pack 😊
Lizzie are you ever gunna post videos on tiktok?
To the person reading this comment  You are awesome & hope you are having a great day 💖
So I watched someone else perspective first and they showed how she fell, so I legit thought she got bored of being a raccoon and wanted everyone to start over with her XD
You are Katherine’s sister now
lizzie is so metal
Can someone tell me what mod she was using? I know she used the orgins mod but idk how she got those biomes-
make a flower shop in the overworld
We can all agree that Lizzie and her crew have the best mods ever in Minecraft
Hi
You and Katherine can be twins!!!
you have the same origin as Katherine :D 😁😁 Two Floran
Since this is the same thing Katherine has there is two Floren people on the server. I thought she would get something else...
I’m so excited for your new life Lizzie!
you should make the portal look like a magical subway station
Get a custom texture for your pumpkin head and give it to everyone on the server! Raccoon Lizzie was amazing but I like new Lizzie too!
You can use a botanists workbench to make cool carved pumpkins
I need to remember not to get too enthusiastic about this new orgin, because it can be gone in an instant.
katherine and lizzie being florans fit so perfectly!   and also the little “weee” at the start is everything😍
Get use to end puns
"Look Man if you're gonna have an epiphany can you go do it elsewhere!" ROFL🤣🤣🤣
ITS. SO. BEAUTIFUL.
Katherine: floran buddies :D
best opera ever!!! jk
I NEED someone to make a custom model for Lizzie’s pumpkin that looks like end plants growing from her head or similar. I don’t have the skills, but it is VITAL.  Also it would be cool if Lizzie’s Florian skin changed over time to be more end themed rather than strawberries.
Omg the end looks beautiful!
Pls don’t dieee it’s super pretty
She’s Katherine! Lol
Who else is just in love with the clicking noises of her Mouse in the background it just sets the mood I don't know if it's just me
You should call your self a end florist if you haven’t already
Aww the way Joey said "Baby shulk' Made me so happy it was so cute!!
Me when lizzy is a racoon:meh Me when lizzys a florian:LIZZYYYY SHE GROWS THE FLOWERS THE ISLAND GOES WILD LIZZZYYYY SHES A PERFECT GOLDEN FLOWER
Yay I'm so happy you posted, I hope you don't mind that I'm a 2 hour late
Opposite of Joel. What are the odds.
This has inspired me to live in the end in this mod 💛
tell     me.     this.       mod.     NOW
Hi
I'm early yay
What Minecraft is this I want it!!
Very interesting that Lizzie is a floran, and so is highly flammable, and meanwhile Joel is a Blaze-kin. And so is ... well, you know. While I will admit, I am sad that there will be no more raccoon Lizzie, and the bathhouse has been abandoned, I am looking forward to seeing the adventures of the End Floran.
So you take more danger from fire. Your husband is the King of fire. Oh boy, here comes issues
Omg are they gonna both live in the end ? 😁
Now Joel and Lizzie are opposites 😍
LIZZIE... u know what nevermind and I love u also your videos are great
Lizzie, you should change ur outfit into something more dark so it matches the end
The boat shimmie caught me so off guard but I loved it!
The modded end reminds me of Pandora from Avatar so much
Floren of the darkness, muhahaha
I haven’t even watched this episode yet but I just imagine Lizzie waking up in a bed of flowers      I’ve gotta draw this NOW
Rip raccoon lady
YOU HAVE THE SAME THING AS KATHREN DID
I like the idea of making a new house for each life, it makes for some great variety!
Lessie I love your content and you are officially my favorite Minecraft YouTuber !!! Luv ya so much keep going ! God bless ! Tysm for your content!!!!! I can watch it for hours and already watched all smp series tysm!!!!!
I love how lizzie lives in the end, I show how she has such good respect for others.. Even when she is evil 😈
I kinda thought LD would want to be unique from Kathren,
Lizzy! Idea! I think you should build an flower castle with over grown vines and everything it would not only scare your enemies but be an great addition to your land the end thank you for listening powerful queen Lizzy    -from your faithful servant
I Love Your Series
I miss lizzie has a raccoon but he new look is cute to and you have to tell you small group that you left
I love how lizzie and smallishbean have opposite powers XD
Can you put a link for the mod 😭😭😭
NEED MORE!!!! I absolutely love this series like all the rest I can not wait to see more!!!!
Lizzie I think you need to build a safer platform soo you can go to the over world and the end safe without you slipping to the void again.
For a bit there, I thought, welp, there goes that whole persona 😂 Glad you lived though
2 florians? :O
same as kathrine
Ohhh nooo the baby racoon 🦝🦝🥲
Hi Lizzie! I absolutely love your videos and I have been watching for a long time now, a good idea I have for you is to build a mini flower tower connected to your green house where you can live! Love you queen 💕✨
2:13 ah hell nah
hehe XD
so you know there is a flowering bench and you can change the carved pumpkin into a kawaii  carved pumpkin
this is so sad
I love it so much!! I need you to decorate my home!😂✋
joey: NO LIZZIE DONT DO IT!! sausage: its a very pretty place-
Lizzie: I hope I don't slip again. Me: wait I'm pretty sure she jumped off 😂
F in the chat for raccoon Lizzy
I like raccoon Lizzie
14:21 hmm kinda puts a ring on my brain *plays song in background*(feast your eyes as i share, my glorious wares, special antiques that are existetly rare)
Baby shulk :0
I love the end biome! I wish it was in real minecraft
Lizzy can you BEElive that you have a new origins
Lizzie's next death will most likely be falling off the void.. the small dew needs an elytra ASAP  ( yes I'm gonna call her a small dew for the rest of her floryn life )
>.< i shall miss the racoon days.
next time she should make her home an end ship and you have to teleport up there.
You and Katherine are the same origin now
So sad she died cause I loved her house and just everything thing but so excited to see this new origin Actually I can’t even say that because I love everything thing about her in every video  And sorry I’m late I was playing with friends and didn’t want to be rude
Maybe your powers should be like Isabella from the Encanto movie
O.
13:06 that was so hilarious yet so scary at the same time
You are like Katherine
You can change the face on the pumpkin with the Botanist Table!! You could have an adorable face!!
girl my eyes are bleeding because of your nean crystal beehouse thingy
those places in the end are sooo beautiful!! is that a mod? what mod is that?!
I KNEW IT
I’m sad that raccoon Lizzie is gone but this new Lizzie looks amazing!
Bro I literally was almost done with fan art of raccoon Lizzie ✋🥲
I wanna start a petition to make the vanilla end look like this
i think lizzie fits the end, shes cute and can be spoopy at times :)
Lizzie’s shears: “Oh, yes. I slowly feel like I’m being used way to much than I should be.” Lizzie: *finding to do many things and her poor shears not able to contend with her*
You got this gurlllll you’ll survive this lol 💛
Retexture the pumpkin so it looks like some end farmer's hat, so it can complement your new skin.
You should get the Pumpkin specialty textured like the armour and things from Empires. :O (if not that cool too, no pressure, just a suggestion)
I'll admit I didn't know who Lizzie was until Empires. Her and Joel both. Really the only ones I watched before were Pixlriffs (for his amazing survival guide) and Fwhip (from some of his build tip tutorials) but both of them are among my new favorite people to watch for minecraft stuff
i dont think your safe in the end floran lizzie
ay you got kathrines powers! :)
Lizzie, you should customise the pumpkin head to look like a flower crown!!
Lizzy I think you should change your costume to something more endery
Hi
i am so exited to see what lizzy gets up to as a Floran though i am going to miss her as a racoon it all ended to soon but still lizzy as a Floran is going to very interesting and not just a Floran an Endfloran very interesting and i give he my very best wishes to stay an Endflroan and not die and get a other origin also the end looks so cool the biomes are  amazing and very much better than the overworld i love it
Definitely love what you did with the portal stairs, now they'll go up shabby ones from the dragon's island and come through to a majestic stairway to an end flower shop
Poor meghan  Everyone =meghan is a freaky person Meghan =whyyyyyyyy
SUGGESTION: make a place or area in every single biome for floryn research.(become a flower scientist in the end HAHAHAHAH)
Long live the raccoon that's in Lizzie, but excited for the new beginnings!
Omg!! Your like Katherine!!
THE WAY SHE PANICKED WHEN SHE NOTICED THAT SHE LOOKED AT AN ENDERMAN
Ur Catherine
The fact that the earthly flower person is selling items from the end to the person who is part enderman in exchange for items from the overworld
Me just over here thinking........ Flowers in the end? I am so confused? What is for breakfast?............ then me remembering that it is modded I think... Also I love the bee bonanza you have going on Lizzie!!
You can team up with katherine
i like this new origin! =]
I think the shaders were good in the overworld, but with such bright/glowy stuff in the end it's kind of a lot; would it be possible to turn the bloom effects down?
I love the new outfit! and i love this new series too! I LOVE YOUS SAISIAKSJNSSJISOAPA
Hey Lizzie OMGG I’ve been watching you since I was 5 😩😩 ilysm!!!! You should make like little memorials of you past lives like a little garden area or something
I would love to watch you stream this
Rip raccoon girl: died by falling into the void   HERE CONES ANOTHER FLOWER GIRL!!
I love the and can you make more videos please
I can’t wait till part 5
I wish the end is like that in Manila Minecraft and also How do you get the ant look like that like what mod is it? You’re my absolute favorite YouTuber and I was sad when empires ended but now I’m even happier than I was when empires was running because after life is awesome but my favorite was still X life🤠🤠
WHAT A MF BEAUTIFUL CRYSTAL GREENHOUSE WTF OMG
Your a amazing florist
hi
How cool I hope you can keep this one for a long time
Hi 🌸lizzie🌸 I'm you're big Fan from 🌸Philippines🌸
Lizzie can make a flower pumpkin head
There is a hanging purple plant in the nether called "Whispering Gourd." It's plant can been turned into a purple jack o lantern.  It would be much more fitting than an orange jack o lantern! I think Scott had some for trade.  I wish the end was so lush and beautiful on vanilla!
i love it <3
🌺🌺🌺🌺💐🌸💐💐🌸🌷🌷🌼🌻🌹🥀🌺🌼🥀🌷🌷🌼🌻🌹🍀☘💐💐🌸
:o
The little jiggling while in the boat is so funny and lovely at the same time
This video was soo cool, and it makes me wanna find this end mod for my modpack now-
OMG YOU TOTALLY FIT THIS AAAHHH! EXCITINGGGG!
Maybe you can make a bridge
the endtrance
I cannot get over the fact that she died bc she *walked* over the ledge 😭😭
i like floran lizzie much more than i like racoon lizzie
i love your shop lizzie
Your new skin is BOOTIFUL!!! I LOVE OT PLEASE DONT DIEEEE
I LOVE THIS SIRIES
Honey I need honey!! *Joel pops in* right here lizzy
I'm loving this series so much!
Hi
The fact that she almost died again..
“I see ✨potential✨🤌”
Baby shulk do do do do do
That Florian outfit is SOOO pretty!!!
Lizzie!! Re=texture the pumpkin so it looks like a cool plant or flower! (Maybe even a flowery pumpkin!)
I thought kathrine was the floran
That one guy: guessing lizzie has a bee orgin cause she got a bee acheviment Lizzie: gets a origin that can only drink honey bottles
i love Joey's little, "auh baby shulk"
The environment on the end is so cool
You're  the 1 Who died
Ah We have the Overworld Floran, The End Floran, Now we just need the Nether Floran to complete the Trifecta
What mod did you use? i'm trying to start my own origins server but i'm very confused how to.
Aww i miss raccoon lizzie though
You could creat of shop selling them!
lizzie u should put a texture pack on the carved pumpkin so it looks cuter!!
Lizzie: AAAH TELL THEM, TELL THEM TO LEAVE Oli: im IM TRYING *is literally just panicking and standing there*
Ldshadowlady WHERE DID YALL GET THESE MODS????
SOOO PRETTY AHHH!!!!11 edit : what is the end mod pack?
She’s like Kathrine! Although it truly is sad now that there is no raccoon, she won’t understand how she organized her chest!😫
Baby shulk do do do do do do
Why do I like floran Lizzy better then raccoon Lizzy
You should call your flower shop “Blooming Blossoms” and also I was thinking your house could be like a giant flower or maybe a treehouse? Or maybe a giant mushroom!
Ur new life reminds me of Isabela from Encanto!
i love the fact that her floower shop has so far only sold a tentacle and a mini shulker head  neither of witch are flowers XDDD
i miss raccoon lizzie but end-floran lizzie is also amazing :DD
You are kind of like Catherine she grows flowers too
She's definitely going to fill the server with her houses from each of her lives.
who knew the end was beautiful
I like right when Lizzie was looking at the sun, there was a little cloud heart ❤️ it was so adorable- 2:40 is time I saw it at
I think it would be a really cute idea to retexture the pumpkin into a floral hat ! :)
You inspired me to build in the end
HAHAAH JOEY IS KILLLING ME “AUUGG… OH…. OH…😨”
Does anyone else get avatar vibes?
You should build some type of way to get to each colored end world biomes
Isn’t that the outfit Lizzie wore when she killed Jack on X Life?
TAKE OVEER THE END BECOME THE END QUEEEN
i love seeing how ever one is enjoying the series so mush
Love your new home! But maybe you can retexture the pumpkin head to like a transparent glass helmet of some sort? Or like a big Flower around your head or a halo? Though I think it looks cool as a pumpkin as well tbh
For your end home, make a rainbow house to match the greenhouse❤️
is this your candy outfit with jack in x life?
ya know what! i might like this one better!
THE WAY OLI GOT ATTRACTED TO THE JUKEBOX HAHAHAH
OMG SO CUTE!
The raccoon is forever missed. I have to admit, the Floran is cool.
Omg I got this mod in forge And it’s awesome I wanna go to the end now
You could make the colored grass separate areas or make it fade into the other grass just feel it look cool :D
Lizzie: "*gasp* There's no chickens in the End!" (Throws egg on the ground... ...nothing...) Lizzie: " ._. There's still no chickens in the End."
You can’t sleep in the end so you can’t respown
How awesome!
I crave Lizzie’s videos 🌸 and I’m honestly obsessed with her builds 🍄
why do i like this origin more .......
Make the pumpkin into a tiara with the end plants
End entrance? endtrance..
The developers should really update the End like in AfterLife. It would be much more enjoyable
It's funny how even in her Floran life, she couldn't sleep since she's in the End The only time she sleeps is in this episode
poor raccoon lizzie
Cool same power as Katherine Elizabeth Gaming 🌟
AAAAAA
The question I'm asking is that:   WHAT MOD(S) DID LIZZIE USE 4 THE END???????? IT'S SO BEAUTIFULLLLLLLLLLLLLL  (was it the `new end` mod or smth)
My last name is Prøspër should I feel honoured?
Omg Katherine twin!!
You should change your skin to match the pumpkin 🎃👍
Lizzie should 100% call the flower shop twisted flowers or even endflorian
I love how you re-used your skin from when you killed Jack in X-life
I love it
Lizzie is like Persephone  She’s a flower goddess,her husband is king of the under world and she lives in the underworld
Side quest chickens 🐔 in the end
Katherine is a floren
I love love love love your new skin!!!!!
MWAH-TERIAL GWROOL!
Lizzie can you try using the custom pumkin heads? In the botanist workbench i think
Can you maybe link next video all the mods please in the description Pretty please
I wish the end was like this in vanilla Minecraft
Ldshadowlady? No hahahahahha        more like the most best youtuber ever
The xlife skin is back
:0 your a flower princess!
That's so hard tho! But you look so cute!
You should build a flower-end castle!!
Let me just say how beautiful the end biome is💕💮🌸
I love thiese episodes please do more also your builds are great and your funny
I love how Lizzie has a different outfit for each story ( Empires, Racoon and hopefully many more!) Keep up the amazing vids ❤️
The raccoon legucy is gone, and now the Floran legucy has come!!
Oli acting like he couldnt see lizzie with her pumpkin on was GENIUS
I absolutely love the new skin, but I think it would look adorable if it looked more 💫alien💫 like to fit the end aesthetic, especially with the neon vibes!
Lizzie You should do a water fall in one of the rooms;D
You should get a botanist work bench, then you can texture the pumpkin and other plants.
no raccoon anymore… but your skin look so cute
omg i absolutely love the end! you should make your house in one of the pretty trees, like a tree-end-florian house, with pretty lights, and a very overgrown feel. <3
I really love how you always live in danger everytime🥰
Your Minecraft name should be LDEndLady Lizzie
Omg your a floran like Katherine
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
The end is the best dimension! We can all agree on that.
Those endermen were all set and ready to ruin your new life. Holy crap! o_o
Lizzie you should make a custom pumpkin for your head
I’ve been waiting for this
Everyone in the mincraft chat: NOO LIZZIE DONT GO- Her: **probably ignoring them**
That end music disc needs to come to actual Minecraft! Honestly all the end stuff should come in the inevitable end update 🤩
my ferret died today 🥲 i was watching LDSHADOWLADY’s afterlife series when my sister went to our ferret cage and went to grab our male ferret (jack) and she said “—- HE ISNT BREATHING” so i went to go check on him and i shook him and he was ice cold. i ran out of the room balling my eyes out to my mothers room and yelled “MOM I THINK JACK IS DEAD HE ISNT BREATHING AND HE WAS FREEZING COLD” but imagine that with breaths of snot and crying, and she got up in a rush running to the ferret cage and she grabbed him, he was semi-hard and his mouth was open. he was stuck in a sleeping position and i miss him. we burried him in our backyard but now all i feel is emptiness without the sound of him shaking his body or falling down the stairs. I’ll forever love that little skunk, but im sad i never played with him. our female ferret seems fine but shes been sleeping in the area we found him the entire time. they were mates snd i dont know how she’ll take this in the long run.                        - RIP Jack 🕊🪦                                    2015-2022 😭
Lizzie should build some small floating islands (since that’s basically the end-) and it would be cute if there was a little waterfall on one island, and the water falls to another island below it? I’m bad at explaining so I am sorry for that. And it would be cute if the glowing end fish lived there!! :O
I still think she is Queen of raccoons
i love how she goes to the end and 2 of them are just saying NO DONT and shes just ignoring them like nothing happened
You have the same origin as katherine
I knew you would be a flowen
im already enjoining this more than the raccoon
I don’t know what mod this is - but the end is now my favourite place and I’m still too scared to go.
YEAHHH
Lizze I've seen from a mod what the golden goose egg is I don't think you want it!
Aww.. I missed her raccoon-ness :(
YAY A NEW VIDEO
I really like your new origin!
WOW WOW WOW
Hi!
Endtising end endtranc 😂
Lizzie please I’m begging you make proper bridges
I love this episode so much
you need to traid the mushrooms with megan and flowers with katherine and if you get the goose name it fellow endygoose
Katheryn is a floeren to
What was that Lizzie?😂
It looks like the ✨prisms shop✨ from empires- beautiful Lizzie, beautiful 🤌🏽
Wow now u turned into Isabella from encanto but u were a raccoon in turning red (but it's actually a panda I think but it's close to raccoon)
Sad to see the Raccoon go, but I'm already loving the End Floran  All I ask is that you build some better bridges so you don't fall into the void again
Why does this remind me of one life?
Lizzie maybe you should put a texture so your pumpkin have flowers or make your pumpkin overgrown
Lizzie I think you should get animals and name them all after flowers!
Anyone else notice this is the skin Lizzie wore when she got revenge on Jack in X Life?
Your the same of kathrine 😌now my two favorite youtubers are now a Floran😊😊
I love this series! Usually always late to the series’s 😂
or did katherine die cause idk I'm confused 🤔
HIIII
We now know where Axolotl! Lizzie came from. From this biome 6:17
Hold on lizzie theres already a floran though and that's katherine so u would have to reroll lizzie since katherine is still the floran
Lizzie you can get very op armour with those crystals they are VERY VERY rare DONT trade then if you don’t make them pay lots!
The end is so beautiful and your builds fit right in ♥️♥️
You should sell things from the end
Lizzie I think u should update ur flower breeding mod to the version in afterlife?! And maybe u could add nether flowers and end flowers!
I like u when ur a raccoon
She should make the videos more longer
I love just her outfit it’s amazinggg and her house at the end
( 11:59 ) you can call it "the *EndTrance*!
I miss the onsie though...
Lizzie: OLI HELP TELL HIM TO LEAVE ME ALONE Oli: 👁👄👁
Beautiful majestic home is awesome or even better than awesome I love ldshadowlady she is my favorite YouTuber I love her vids and her
this kinda look like that Tommy mod vid were he doesn't leave the end
It's onely ep 4 and she is now a Florian
what mods are you using ?
Lizzie should plant some of those beautiful trees in the end somewhere :0 maybe they have saplings
The modded End is so beautiful. I'm hoping this life lasts a bit longer. I really want to see what she can make of it.
yay
Wow. Every series is THE BEST
Nooooo
Noooooo
you and Katherine are floran buddies
YOU HAVE KATHEREN POWER THING: O
Florin lizzy lets the journey continue my friends for the next episode wut shall she do next also the the end-trance and the store and staircase are MWAH
I WANT THIS MOD, THE END IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.
I like the idea of the next raccoon looks to her for advice and stiff
Sup
What mods are you using?
and why do you want to move to the end
The fact you chose to live in the end after you died there is honestly amazing. I thought you'd never want to go back so this really surprised me lmao
you should build cute bridges between the islands! :)
That was fun
I miss Lizzie the raccoon 🥺
eeeeee, LIZZIE'S A FLORAN!!!!  *fits her aesthetic perfectly*
GIRL U AINT LEAVING THERE ITS TOO BEAUTIFUL 😍
I found your firs video it is different than the others
I wish my end looked like that.
One thing that makes me nervous about living in the end is the chance of falling into the void and I hope that doesn’t happen because your end home is so pretty
GIRLLLLL!!! get to part five STAT i flipping love ittt
You should build something in the blue trees
We all miss and love our little raccoon ruler may she rest in garbage peices
On the last video when she did at first I didn’t clue in but then I realized she was not a raccoon anymore 🥺
finally! I’ve been waiting for forever
Consult the elder floran
It's ironic how she has fire weakness, and Joel is well... A blaze isn't he? Also those end biomes are beyond stunning. 💖
What mods do you use?
I JUST CAM FROM SCHHOOL AND DID NOT KNOW THIS EXETS tysm
I love those flowers thank you you are my favourite youtuber!❤👍
HERE WITHIN AN HOUR TICKET 🎟
Try to survive ldshadowlady
So in love with your new look and end home
hi
Wow thats a pretty ENDtrance
you should make a bridge to each flower area
Wow Lizzie your new origin are so amazing ❤️
I NEED A PT.5 NOW
I think you should call yourself the enderderin flower Queen
I love you your the best stay as you are we love you I love this series 💕❤️💕 I can't wait for the next episode
You got the same one as Katherine
Just realized that she goes to the end first not the nether. the nether was always the one kills me
my heart almost dropped when lizzie made eye contact with those endermen😭😭😭
Would you be able to tell me what Addison or mod this is for Minecraft?
wow imagine if the vanilla end actually had this many biomes, that would be awesome!
wow! what mod are you using ? its so pretty!
I love your vids! They’re always so funny, i hope you get to 7M
I would love to see her face when she sleeps in the End...
I wish u were still a raccoon:( but now at least ur like katherine
i love you lizzie!!!!
did.. did you just let them kill the dragon for you
Lizzy:I'm a floran Kathrine:There can only bee one😐🗡
Business is blooming
Lizzy:I have something perfect for you  Ad: Clorox
We always enjoy
How do u make do u get a random origin when u spawn and die
She can still turn invisible to olly
personally I would set up shop in the overworld so people wouldn't need to come to the end and in doing so take some of thoose materials for themselves
Early gang 🥳
Could Lizzie technically change how the pumpkin looks and THEN turn it into a pumpkin head?? Also, please tell me you’re going to make a botany research station/facility/building—that would be cute (*´꒳`*)
Egg
Racoon Shrine Racoon Shrine Racoon Shrine Racoon Shrine  Racoon Shrine  Racoon Shrine  Racoon Shrine  Racoon Shrine  Racoon Shrine  Racoon Shrine  Racoon Shrine  Racoon Shrine  Racoon Shrine  Racoon Shrine
IM A BIT LATE BUT IDC IM HERE!!! I LOVE UR VIDS
You should create a purple pumpkin mask!!! It will be so pretttyyyyy
You should have pumpkins for people just in case!
I just had the worst day in my entire life but atleast I can come home to Lizzie shimmying
WHAT ARE THOSE MODS!!! they are so pretty I need them!
You should build cute bridges connecting the islands based on the biomes on each one <3
Every time I hear "wares" I keep thinking of 'Deal with Destiny'
What is the name of this mod??????
I love this series it is so great please keep making more videos?!  🤩
Don’t you mean …           END- Trince?
Get it girl!
I'm so sad about the Raccoon.
9:11 all the endermen said 'look for the eye' before lizzie threw the enderpearl; i just found that funny
yesss we are gonne have soooo much fun
Shulk: Baby shulk 🥺  Me: IDK WHY BUT I LIKE THE HULK EVEN MORE NOE BECAUSE OF SHULK!!
UwU
UwU
Why don't you text you the pumpkin to look like your head?😃
I love this video
Next time be a Moth! You would be sooo CUTE!
She is like Katherine now! Maybe you can make something with her. 🌸🌸🌸
Hi
Hu
6:01, What if you build a mini Prisma Palace tower in that lake as a reference to your empire? You can also maybe build bridges from island to island and the bridges could be themes after the biome it's crossing in
You and Katherine are twins
omg i the love the end now
your new house is so cute
Yeah and lost her diamond armor
Idk why but when you said tentacles I said oli would love that and when you gave it to him I choked on my water and laughed. 🤣🤣🤣
You should build a large bee hive for your bees
Raccon Lizzie!! NOOOOOOO
Karma'
In my free time I love watching you guys make new or old smp like this one and empires I love you guys!
Omg wow

STOP THE END LOOKS SO AMAZING OMG
ngl- i cannot beleive you died that way :C....
Rest in peace raccoon Lizzy
Omg when lizzie looked at the enderman, it gave me a heart attack 😭😂
Oli: you have brought beauty back to my life, LDshadowlady 13:56-13:58 Lizzie: look man, if you're going to have an epiphany can you go do it else where?
You should call the entrance the EnD-trance
please i cant get over how pretty the fricken end is-
"Look man if you're going to have an epiphany can you go do it elsewhere?" Is my favorite thing I've ever heard uttered.
As much as I miss raccoon lizzie I think End Florin Lizzie will bring great things to this sever😄👍🏵🌹🥀🌺🌷🌼🌻🌲🌱
I like the raccoon one better
I hope lizzie decides to make a shop selling end items so her and Joal can match :)
SHE AND KATHERINE ARE THE SAME OMGOMG (EARLY)
Aaaa I love your videos
PLEASE MAKE AN END OUTFIT!!!
I can’t wait until someone gets the hardest origin possible: THE MERLING!!!!!
Aaaaaaaaahhh I had to hold back my tears everything was so pretty and cute I just wanna join the SMP go to you and trade all of my valuables if I have any for everything you have and then I will go to every single place in the end and take everything that I find cute I’m having a  breakdown!!! lol
Lizzie I love your new starter base!
Hello I'm sorta early
loved it
You should build some elaborate bridges to avoid falling off the end
Wow~
Im gonna miss picking trash with u  Lizzie But im very interested in seeing how far your new origin brings you too
I CANT WAIT FOR EP 5
Lizzie: Dies in the end Also Lizzie immediately after: The end shall fear my botany powers!
Well, that end forest mod, I need it
To bad you died, I even make you as a raccoon hope you like you new live I think that you look 👍. Have fun 🤗
This is my favorite smp shop and home idea ever!
You should change your outfit to match the end so you’re the flower girl of the end
Please make ep 5 tomorrow please. PS, Love your vids IDShadowLady
i love lizzies racoon fase like so cool
I want to be in the end with you ♥️💐🌸🥀🌹🍀
O.M.G girl that fits you but it fits more on Katherine bc she is peaceful but we'll miss you're raccoon self
O
Lizzie should totally change her skin to make her look more end-like Like chorus fruit and dark-colored skin with eyes like the endermen it would look so cool
Can Oli, as an Enderian, actually not see other players wearing pumpkins or was he roleplaying?
I feel like those purple gourds Scott has would match Lizzie a little more than the other pumpkin lol
I absolutely love lizzie's new  origin
Noooooooooooo i lobed racoon
I'm a bit early
Wait wait wait wait wait. Lizzie was shifting on the platform. And she very clearly jumped off? I mean i guess its not that bad considering all parties get something new to experience here though haha so i guess that was kinda smart for keeping audience attention
this this a mod!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bye bye Raccoon Lizzie Hello Floral Lizzie!
I wanna live there
Lizzie is posting more often now
NO WA
Man, time goes by so quick when I am watching Lezzie's content.
I have literally been waiting for someone to inhabit the end.  I wouldn't expect a floran to be the one to fulfill my hopes, but it's totally iconic ✨
Wow the end looks amazing!
lizzie you should make ur skin end themed!🌌✨🌷
The end look so cuteeeeeeee
You should build a house for each origin
LD shadowlady please build a secret base so you can hide you're anything you want to hide hide your diamonds or anything
"OOO! There aren't any chickens in the End!" *throws egg* "There are still no Chickens in the End"
Can you link the mods please
Lizzie you could change the pumpkin design to any design you want but it requiers a modded table..
LIZZIE Grows a flower and the server goes wild LIZZIE Shes the perfect GOLDEN CHILD~
You should make cute bridges to all of the islands in the end
Loved it😍
Great new origin!
OMG  your video is amazing!!!
this extremely oversaturated world reminds me of Katherine, and its SO CUTE
2:13 the most amazing dance I’ve ever seen
I never knew the end could be so BEAUTIFUL😍
Just don't die.
A Hurricane of Endcuranda's, tentacles, hanging vines. blossom berry bush spread as she climbs & she pushed through!
I've been waiting so long for this
“gains strength from water” “flammable” Joel and and Lizzie are completely opposite lol
Make the end  music dis your Outro song
Lizzie, you bounced back in spectacular form and you're 100% the most talented creator on the server
Your origen is like Kathrine
Please post more videos every day
OMG your new skin is so pretty!!!
Bro, you almost lost your second life already
Oh!You've got the same origin as Katherine
Oh my gosh Lizzie that is a beautiful
Wow I wish I was living there what made the end so pretty what pack what is it called I need to know
what mod are you guys using for the plants?!
lizzie: i am never going back to the overworld it sucks 2 seconds later lizzie: i should prob go home now
Now trash will keep on piling 😭
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EPISODE FOR SO SO LONG
This made me so happy
So many people died in the end lol
i love how it just went wEeEe in the background when she fell off the platform
Rip raccoon girl
love the little shop build
You can shimmy 🤩🤩🤩
Splash bottles of water?
Basiclly lizzies isabela
I wish I could play with these mods... Sadly I'm a PE player and, alas, cannot.
I thought only one person could be orgin. There’s already a floran in the series so shouldn’t she reroll
Lol researching it she actually jumped off don’t know if she did it on purpose but either way made for an entertaining end of the last video
You are now kathrine
“Where they will *end* up in the *end* “ *Pun, but I’m sure it was unintended*
omg does anyone know the name of the mod in the end?? i absolutely need it ))):::
Anyone hear the “weee” when she fell 😂
YUSSS IM NOT LATEEE~~~ >8)
You should change your skin into an end floren lady
Please name something “Flapoola”
Lizzie and Katherine best team up
you should make a house at the overworld :>
*i just did something unexpected, somethings coming, something new*
Plant go brrrr
You are like Katherine cool 😎 ♥️
The song makes people AKA Oli who dont live in the end insane AKA what you did to Oli
Go to katherin
YOU KEEP STEALING KATHERINES IDEAS (joke)
I miss racoon girl  :< but this will make up for it
I'm on my mom's account and you got the Floran just like katherine
im wondering what the mods for this server are honestly
I love how Orionsound almost breaks into song
I am going to miss lizze collecting gARBAGE!
I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!!!!
soon we'll see flowers on everything she builds
With Out Shaders everything with the Better End Mod looks only half as good😭😅
Lizzie You Rock
yeah!
Girl! Your so fast at adapting OMG!!
you should convince Ollie to move to the end too!
I love all the series
Lizzie: Katherine, how do I survive? Katherine: stay in the sun Lizzie: Decides to live in the End
I'm sad no more Garbage runs
I’ve been watching ldshadowlady for 6 years you are literally my idol
Lizzie opening a competitive buisness to Scott's, him with Nether flaura and her with End flaura. Can't wait to see how that turns out! Also the rainbow greenhouse is so goddamn beautiful
“There are no chickens in the end!”  *throws egg hopefully*  “…There are still no chickens in the end…”
It’s adorable how scared Joey was when Lizzie decided to enter the end! ❤️
At least you have a life you can settle in but it’s just not the same as the raccoon
PART 5 AND 6 AND 7 AND 8 AND 9  AND SO ON I'M EXCITED!!!!
NOW YOU ARE KATHRINE!YAAAAAAAAAAAA
Aw man I’m gonna to miss raccoon Liz y and picking up T R A S H…
I love how you went in a totally different direction from the other Floran. Its going to make the series so much better even if you do have to set up a super honey farm. :)
I LOVe YoUR VIDEOS :DDD
Oh no! The tiny trash panda!
End-trance 😂
Could some be so kind as to tell me if they know what mod makes the end and other biomes so pretty?
Woaahhhhh :oo
what if you make an end version of your skin.
YOUTUBE WHY DIDN'T I GET A NOTIFICATION FOR THIS MASTERPIECE WTF
jUsT gOrGeOuS😭👍👍✨
its a Endtrance
If you were in water when you hit joey/shulk, you'd get 2x damage.
Hi
Lizzie and Oli is such a funny duo
Joey: baby shulk
I think the end entrance should be called the ENDtrance
Ahhhhh
I love how Orion was thanking Lizzy for bringing him joy she told him to get lost😂😂😂😂
with how well the shop went guess you could say business was... "blooming"?
2:16 haha
The bridges... the bridges!!! They're TOO skinny!! I don't want you to fall, I love this origin :'< Make the bridges thicker and add railing, and maybe decorations, Trust me!!
Lizzie is gonna do the 🌟Lizzie shimmy🌟
I love your shop
bb shulk 😭👐🏾
Lizzie, now that you live in the end NEAR HUGE TREES and you're a floran, it's best that you live inside a tree, become one with end nature. Or at least I hope you do, anything is good
Ah, you found a couple of my discs! There's a third one, too. Got a few viewers from this video- thank you for enjoying BetterEnd! If you want to play my music in the background or anything, you're completely free to ^-^
Hey lizzie! What mod are you using can you please reply to this comment its ok if you dont haha i say this to almost every youtuber!
Yeah no.. end is much better!!
Atleast this is a good way to make up for forcing half the server into the end
Early!!!
Entrance don't you mean Endtrance   Also I still think Joey should have been shulk from Xenoblade
I LOVE your new skin it makes me want to go wear something pink and floral. Super excited for your new origin :)
Can you name a raccon shady paws for your death as a raccon and if you keep dying the grab the items that represent your last origin like if you die as a flower lady then grab a vine and name it something like puffy because pollen that's why I suggested shady paws for a raccon because they are like little animal bandits
You should customise you flower skin to the end flowers 🌸
Sorry I was 59 minutes late but I’m here
Can you please tell me the name of the mods your using I NEED THEM
OMG LIZZIE! the end looks so cool! what mod is that? OH and what IS ThAt ShAdER! 🥰😍🤩
She still chasing her dreams of conquering The End
The fact that Lizzie take twice much damage from fire and Joel being a blazeborn
lizzie just vibing in the end
"Uh excuse me-" **gets shoved away**
i love this❤❤❤❤❤
Here within an hour
DO A RECAP/REWIND ON THE LAST EPISODEEEE AND PLEASE POST MORE OFTENNN
Love the green house
Hey Lizzie, if you know how to you can try make the pumpkin a flower Crown like how scar has his elf ears on hermit craft I think that look cute especially with your origin❤️
LIZZIE MAKE AN ACTUAL HOUSE IN THE END! PLEASE
LIZZIE AND KATHERINE FLORANSS
Whats this mod, im loving it!
I loved the raccoon so much even though this is amazinggg
13:06 the best of lizzie 😂
Lizzie could name her end plant shop (hear me out)… End Of The Vine!
I have been watching everyone’s series and seeing all the different perspectives of your trick has been hilarious! Now we have two cute Florans!
Love U Lizzie! 🪴🌱🌿🍄
if you die again please live in the end again, ITS SO PRETTY
I can't wait until they're done with this series so people can actually start playing the mod pack for themselves. It looks like so much fun to play
Wow did OLI SAY ‘The Brothers of my Enderdem?’
Lol Nice job lizzy
This End is so cool. I can't wait to see what more amazing ideas the End Floran has for us. ^-^
AHHhHhHhH I love this Series sooooooo much 🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶
OMG the end looked beautifull!
LD FLAWER LADY IS BACK!!!!!         ps.Xlife lizzy's flawer mod
I'm sorry Lizzie for u r death
Wow
the pink end biom kinda reminds me of Isabella's room from encanto
Luv ur vids
love how lizzie is a floran and joel is a blazeborn opposites attract
I miss little raccoon 😭
What mods are used in afterlife??
I love it what are u going to do with ur old house??
❤
Lizzie has some great dance moves!
Noooo you no longer a raccoon ;-;
2:12 oh yeah shimmie shimmie!!
earlyyy
Lizzie: (gasps) there are no chickens in the end  *throws egg, it being empty*  Lizzie: there are still no chickens in the end
You should use a texture pack so the pumpkin looks like a cute hat or something
YES
That Shakira shimmy had me dying!!!
Me in this episode: "Looking at title.👀" AfterLife mk I need to get this mod!
Cool
Awwh
please take off the pumpkin I’m getting all stressed
I like this origin a lot better- idk why
Nooooooo you looking so be for
Omg you and Kathrin are twins also y’all are basically bone meal machines.
My favourite part was when you made your house :) - My 6 year old  I like how entertaining your videos are and I've been watching you for a long time :) - My 11 year old  Thanks for being a family friendly channel that me and my kids love watching together <3
Love the video✨      Hi LDShadowLady! I wanted to ask the huge favor of joining my Minecraft realm that me and my friend made for a screenshot, because my entire friend group are such huge fans of you. I totally understand if you don't want to or don't read this. Much love to the Brand-new floran on the smp!
i love her new skin it is so cute
i like flower lizzy but i miss racoon lizzy already
ah yes much better here than the bland overworld
NoooooooooOoOOo
many Scott will like 5hem he has end ones
I was so excited to see what origin you got next !!!💖✨
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Omg I love Lizzy's origin
OMG LIZZE I LOVE YOUR VIDS SO MUCH, and what mod did you use for the end that looked so cool
In one episode Lizzie officially became an End Citizen 😂
This episode is ✨🦋
YOU GOT THE SAME AS KATHERINE
You should put up a sign for when ur not around at the shop and besides the bee hive maybe build a tree house or a nice mansion!
🥰🥰🥰
she should get a texture pack that gets rid of the orange pumkin head lol
Rip Raccoon Lady
Even though Lizzie had to go to the End by herself at least she didn’t have to go through the fight for the Dragon Egg
Nobody: Lizzie: *Boat shimmy*.
It’s sad tho bc she’s not a raccoon anymore ☺️🌺💗
you should make your house like a end ship
I loved this episode so much what raged me was you didn’t get any saplings if I was there I would take five or more of EVERTHING I COULD GET
hiiiiiiiiiii
RIP RACOON
No the raccoon queen died
Lizzie everytime she enters a new server and got some materials: BUSINESS. MONEY. ITEMS.
I didnt realize i was early until I finished the video lmao
Im exited for lizzie's new  origen 😁
You could make a town out of the houses you have lived in for every life. (Including other dimension houses.)
OMG SHE IS SO CUTE I may miss her racoon but she is still my raccoon queen
Everyone was saying your next origin was a bee and I saw your skin spoiler and I 100% knew you were a floran, yay!
EARLY
Look man if you're going to have an epiphany can you do it somewhere else please 😂😂😂😂
You could make a town out of the houses you have lived in for every life.
Yessss!
Lizzie must be loving this series! She posts so often now!
OrionSound: goes into stall LDShadowlady: Bro leave-
i miss raccoon lizzie 😥but i loveee the new lizzie! very much a lizzie type thing to live somewhere that doesnt have something essential for her origin! XD i love it XD
Forget being sad about the racoon THE END FLORAN IS LEGIT EPIC
I love watching lizzie 💖💖
Xornoth would like those tentacles 😏 Also what shaders do you use
everything lizzie does end in CHAOS… and im here for it.
I love watching lizzie 💖💖
14:50 you should of did that in water
Wait the end has BYOMES?
are we going to ignore the fact that the epic end biome with epic plants isn't real
Her outfit gives me strawberry shortcake vibes 😂
Can i Just Ask What is the name of the mod that makes the End Have that Biomes ?
i am going to miss the racoon origin, but I am excited to see what else happens in the series
Omg this is perfect for ur kawaii style Lizzie !!♥️ eeeeee so exited to see more of the Florian life style!
Maybe some day a new raccoon to take the trash
As soon as I saw this I was like “she died? ALREADY?”
i love the videos you make keep it up on the smps they are amazing also this smp is great i love how it works
I'm betting on Joey dying from his strength test thing
I'm gonna laugh so hard if all of them are Floran
She Once Died in the End But She Now Lives in the End
Bleep blop
ur the same as katherine!!!! love that
Oli is so weird 💀
11:41 *ENDtrance*
Build a mob gram or a fram
You can eat the pink berrys btw its modded so you can eat them unless you wanna say thats cheating lol
Who else thinks she could be Isabella
Love your videos
i love ur channel :))
Now we wait two more episodes for Lizzie to get prank fever again and accidentally die in the process.
Since you are flower person you are not allowed in the small club
Is Lizzie the only one who’s died
goodbye LDShadowLady
I kind of absolutely love Floran Lizzie. It gives me the idea she’s a Floran from the end, separated from her homeland and returning back at last as a researcher and merchant. I’ll miss the garbage, though.
I like that you have the better end mod
Girl you ought to ditch that basic old orange pumpkin & bargain with "Little Man" for 1 of those magical cutesy purple pumpkins! Anyways yet another lovely video! Keep up the great work!
Hey guys
Omg I wish the end looked like that in vanilla.
Not gonna lie, I about died laughing when your plan went awry last episode and you were the one to die.   What astounds me is that Joel knew exactly what was coming and he still got in the "elevator" 😂 😂 He did warn you of impending doom despite him not normally being quite so..... *ahem*...sharp! I mean, I was watching his old Arcadia series earlier and he did mock a tree for looking stupid and while doing so stepped backwards off the edge of a ravine and died, but apparently he has his moments of genius too! 😂 😂  Edit: I genuinely nearly spat orange juice across my bedroom when you had to show us the shoulder shimmy!! I was not expecting that at all and it was brilliant! Loving watching all of the new videos in this series, you all put so much effort into making them and they're just so fun to watch. Thank you all!
Ooo
I loved the raccoon🥺
I’m late 😭
✨shimmy shimmy✨ Sad that no more trash collection tho- But yk the end is SOOOOO PRETTYYY
I WANT THE END MODSSSS PLEASE IT'S SO PRETTYYYYY
Wait is lizzie a bee
Make more plsss
Hi Lizzie - you can bring some animals to live in the end like chickens and cows-<3
You should have a flower path going up to the flower shop and through each biom have that theme as the path if you know what I mean!!!
Yesss
You should build every time you die a little state of what you were or have a grave yard monument area! Also later you should build a automatic honey farm. Sorry you should also build an area were you have over world animals and over world blocks..... Nice wiggle 🤣
It’s the endtrance
Hi
Lizzie: I could live on a lily pad!     empire smp Lizzie: …..
Lizzie's dress looks sooooooo cute
lizzy you look soo good but atleast now you can be taller than joel again and read
Omg Can you please make a video if you want of what mods you have on that world please they're really cute
Hii Lizzie!!
Ahhhh i love this can’t wait for some more content also I really want to see your house
YESSSS
What are the mods shes using .... I wanna know !!!!!
47 minutes ago
I love all your videos 😃
Why isnt noone talking about how she almost died AGAIN. that was a close call
LDShadowLady it’s my birthday tomorrow and I’m Pisces and I love your origin
I love how Joey switches between his Shulk voice and his regular voice and pretends that he’s not doing that lol
You can live in a flower 🌺
DONT DIE LIZZIE 👹👹☠️
No the raccoon is the BEST
Hi
So, Lizzie built an Endrance?  Nice.
YASSSSS THIS IS SO OOOO GOODDDDDDDD I LOVE YOUR VIDEOSSSSS!
You should probably make actual bridges  between the end islands. You don't want the people falling off.
i love it
….what’s a floren?
Yes my queen 😩🙌🌸
I’ve seen nobody mention the sad fact that florans are highly flammable and joels a blaze
Hey Lizzie can you tell us some of the name of these mods? I really liked the super powers one and the end floral one so if I could know it would be nice
get more end flowers
Oooh you and Katherine would be a perfect Floran ladies
Yay!
A cool name will be the black flower and the logo be a wither rose
Florend ;)
lizzie somehow always finds a way to make something cute no matter where it is
Nice!
Me wondering how lizzie went from grass to pink land:
I can't WAIT for the builds in this series, especially with all the end items
this is my favorite episode so far! Btw, thank you Lizzie for uploading more often now!💗I hope to see more episodes like this!💗 Keep up the great work Lizzie!
It’s great the Lizzie’s So active now and I love the content! <3
Lives in the End, but insists on gathering materials without shulkers
I loved the racoon but this is amazing!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Play your music in your shop 😅😌🤗
WHAT IS THIS END MOD I NEED IT
I absolutely LOVE the moods in the end 😍
Yay katherine and Lizzie are floral twins!!!
XD
How do you have so many origins.. the mod i can find has only 9
I hope Lizzie creates some of the new custom Carved Pumpkin Faces with the Botanist table. It would be neat to have her switch out the heads based on her mood for sure.
Don't let this be "THE END" of your new origin Please make an end tree house 🙂
Mmoorree even tho I just came across this video BC I always check!
The biomes are so sick In the end
ALL HAIL END QUEEN
YAAA
omg, your skin is so cutee!
I love your new outfit
Yaaas
Now we have two Isabella Madrigals 😂
how did you get floran katherines orgin is floran
Hi
man, those biomes are soooo amazing, i wish this was vanilla
Another Floran, how glorious! Stay safe in the End. 🥳 Hold on, can you sleep in the end? Oh dear, the Phantoms! 😳
You can use the flower table to make a pink pumpkin head!
All we need is a nether Florian and we will have the complete set!
Oh yeah forgot she died :'D
I love this idea for a new series!!! As soon as lizzie didn't upload for like- a month I immediately new that she was going to come out with another smp or series.❤💗
I love your house Lizzie 🐝
WHAT MOD DO YOU USE FOR ALL THE END FLOWERS ITS SO PRETTY
I love Lizzie's line of "Look man if you're gonna have an epiphany can you go do it elsewhere? 😒🙄" And then Oli's response of, "Yeah, okay. 😔"
You have the same origin as Catherine Please join her shop
The first one was so scary you died at the end
Lizzie you should re texture your pupkin head to a end flower crown
LIZZY AND KAT ARE GONNA BE THE FLOWER GIRLS
i'm really liking how lizzie decided to live in the end! really makes things much more exciting especially with just the void right under her, though i do get anxious every time she crosses her one block bridges. perhaps future bridge structures with a sort of gradient effect? like one end of the bridge is coming from a red biome and the other end is coming from a blue biome, then in the middle it mixes together?  edit: LIZZIE OHMYGOD just wanted to say i've been watching your videos for 7 years now and you're like my comfort youtuber!!
Ps I loveYour videos and I hope one day you will have an amazing day
Lizzie go "weeee"
Lizze you know that bees only work in day so they always bee working
FLOWER POWERR
rember back in x life when shemadethat flower mod that was awsome
Amazing video with a twist Lizzie!!!
Hi Lizzie!! This made my day!! Your literally my idol haha
I love this video. They modded the end so nicely its so darn pretty. And you know where lizzie picked the mushrooms there were other mushrooms right by those and she didn't pick them up...THEY LOOKED SO FRICKING CUTE!!!!!.
Of course Lizzie has an exciting new challenge for her next life (and an adorable flower-person skin), and I am extremely excited for someone actually basing in the End :) The modded end biomes are super cool and someone using the biomes rather than just the blocks is VERY exciting, plus the challenge of being the fed-by-the-sun origin in the sunless void of the End sounds fun without being frustratingly difficult for Lizzie. I wonder... there's the modded botany-bench carved pumpkins, I wonder if they still work to make you invisible to endermen? Some of those other pumpkin faces are super cute :) (Also, speaking of being invisible to endermen, I hope Oli recorded buying stuff from your shop because the fact that he can't see Lizzie with a pumpkin on her head is very funny to me XD)
I knew it was a Florian
if i was lizzy i would live in that red biome its so pretty :3 so is the blue one i love them both…
Interesting change, you've gone from a tiny trash panda to a beautiful flower lady
You should get name tags from people then name your bees! Name one bumble butt because it’s cute
AHHH IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO POST IM SO HAPPY
Hi Lizzie
I love this more than the others of afterlife smp, the looked very beautiful with those mods, i would like to know what are the mods name.
HII
I love how with both of your origins you have added your own little spin to them! It’s super fun to watch you go completely out of your way for a crazy idea and it actually works out and is super cool!
so Lizzie turned from the trash raccoon to the greek mythology of Persephone in minecraft? yikes
I love your videos and ima big fan and i love your new origin and your old one i really love your looks and smartnes
Your content is amazing i would definitely go to your flower shop! This series has been so interesting. Congratulations on your new Origen!
So now there's two florans? Sweet, you could be business partners!
WHAT IS THIS AMAZING END MOD!!?? I NEEEEEEEEED IT
Early people
Litzy can you seed me the sever Join code or the Texture pack

This is the best episode so far😊😊😊😊😊
Omg the Enderman gave a heart attack I though Lizzie is about to die
Omg the end is so beautiful. Almost makes me want to ✨ shimmy shimmy ✨
Yas
✨shimmy shimmy ✨
I think you should build a little pumpkin patch next to your greenhouse. It would be super cute!!
Hi
you should make your dress have the end of colors
she died on ep 3 :|
Y dose everyone comment so fast 💨 😅
You should start a shop with plants that you find in the end
this was so cool to see the different biomes in the end! Will there be a Ender Floran skin?
You understand the agony of seeing spoilers then having to wait for the episode but I know you work hard on everyone
shimmy shimmy
How do you think she's going to die this time my guess fall damage
I love all the new plants xxx it’s so beautiful! This is so interesting :0
In water + Sun lizzy can 1 shot with a crit  Thats scary
this fits you so much!! i love this origin sm!
What mode has those beautiful end biomes?!
I just finished watching the last episode, it's nice to see this :)
Btw Lizzie if you didn’t know you can right click wines to make them stay a specific length.
I love how Joey says your the queen of the end
which end mod is this i need it
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
So ur a Katherine's Twin Floran Sister?
38 minutes!! Also I love this series already :D
Please live there forever
Well I guess Lauren is safe now
If you guys could make a mod list for some of your servers, I would really love that! Maybe you could link them in the descriptions of the first videos of each series?
ur new skin looks so cuteeee
I love the end idea!!!
last episode was insane
does anyone know the modlist for this smp?
How did that person know
Can’t stop laughing over the enderman attack
I miss racoon lizzy :c
amazinggggggggg
I miss raccoon Lizzy but Florian lizzy is better
Hi
The end of the raccoon regime is a sad day
What are cool news origin
was totally thinking katherine would love the end plants as floran after seeing it from sausage but now you're also one and even set up your base in the end! will miss the raccoon lizzie (& the spirited away castle) but totally diggin' your new origin too and excited for your builds in the end!  ps. also notice you didn't have to sleep again being in the end lol
“Also those floaty things,” “ I want one.” Best quote.
37mins
Could you please do a video reviewing every mod used in afterlife
37 minss
Lizze now you are isabella
I NEED THIS END MOD-
0:30 wee
Flower sisters???  Lizzie and kathrine ?
raccoon lizzie will be deeply missed 😪🦝
I want to binge this series so much, but I found it while its happening. I've watched every video from everyone on the smp and my thirst hath not been quenched
Joey in the chat once Lizzie goes into the end just made my day lmao “sHuLk tOuGh bOy”
Your like Katherine lol
you should build safer bridges to your new home
This is the best afterlife episode yet
Lov s this video Lizzie
The fact that Oli, as an enderian, couldn’t see Lizzie because she was wearing a pumpkin makes me so happy.
Lindsay's little dance just makes her look adorable! 2:12
She's a floran!
Finally new vid :)
yay i love you lizzie
oh noooooooooooo
Flower Lizzie!!! :D
Early
Woah they need to update the end to this mod pack! Also whats the name of the mod plack for the end?
The fact that Joel is a Blazeborn and Lizzie is a Florian gives me “forbidden love” vibes lmao
Love it Lizzie!!
Me seeing all the flowers  Me:😇😀😀😀💜💜💜💜💜🌹🌹🌸🌹🌸🌹🌸🌹🌸
Lizzie In Last Video: I Can't Read. Also Lizzie: *Reads Sign*
I like the racoon super much but other lives are new so lets see
I have been waiting or ep 4!! Im so happy!!!
I like how the reason lizzy died was the end and now she's living in it!
That was amazing I know you can't hear me but I'm really sick so you made my day for me 🥰❤️🍄
The death was so funny though this origin seems like such a cute one!🌸💞
.
I love all of lizzie’s Videos! They just get better and better with each video!
Omg I a bit early! Btw I love your vids
i love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lizzie: gets the 'if yo dont live in the overworld you die origin'  also lizzie: im going to live in the end
Your the dest ❤️ will never 👎 get old I hope 🤞 you having a great 😌 day I love your video so much and you are so funny 😆
I WAS SO EARLY AND I DIDNT NOTICE?? IT WAS 3 MINUTES AGO WHEN I STARTED THIS AHHAHHHHHHHHHGGHGJDKWKDHEHWKKAJEBWKWL DANG IT
Omg your new Origin is so cute!!
loving this series so far
Hi
you can make cute pumpkin heads with the botanist work station
The end's plant life is SO cute, so I would live there too!
omg lizzie hiiii!!!!!                 i luv ur new outfit and ur videos rule!!!
early
If only the End looked like that
katherine ALWAYS gets flower like WHAT lol just just lol
LOVE YOY LIZZIE! YOUR THE BEST!
I noticed that she was crouched on the platform when entering the End, but purposefully jumped cuz otherwise she would not have fallen off. If it was for suspense and for the story, then that's very understandable. I like that she's a Floran now anyway. It suits her well!
Sad that the racoon was lost, but this new origin is also great!
I thought I would be sad that raccoon Lizzie is gone but I love Floran Lizzie!
Here’s an idea about the pumpkin, put it in a botanist table and choose the cute one so you can fit your look, just an idea
You should slowly become half ender.
Can I come to ur shop Lizzie I need damn damn
I WANT MORE :(
Hi lizzy!! I love your videos a lot and your building style is just amazing I hope your doing well!!
This video is amazing! My favorite one so far ☆
Best way to wake up from a nap 😴
I love the place you picked out, and I'm sad that you're not a raccoon anymore, but I like where this is going. Love this series!
No ooo rattcon lizzy!!!!😭😭😭
At first I was surprised that you were staying as a floran since katherine is one already, but I love the direction you went with :D  Oli's epiphany was hilarious
your house in the end is amaising
✨STHPARKLE✨
Love this. ❤️
This Was AMAZINGg!😩👌
OK don't live with Katherine
I love the idea of Lizzie living in the end but I am nervous every second that I watch that something will kill her or she will fall!!
Omg shes like katherine now!
I still miss the raccoon girl, but a flower girl is cool to!! And I think it’s funny that you looked at an enderman pfft 😆
The end remined me of the movie Avetar
Is Lizzie really extra or are people just basic
I just finished binging her X-Life series and she has once again blessed us with another video!? Such a great day 🥰
oli should move into the end too!
Hi
I think you should play the duke box as like store music
Imagine that the more you live or are connected to the end the more you worship the orb
Me after last episode: NOOOO RACCOON LIZZIE Me this episode: ooh plant lady go brr
Early
goodbye racoon life hello floran life lol
OMG you have same as Katherine
I’m going to miss raccoon Lizzie but flower Lizzie will be just as good ✨
early! :D
I honestly love how chaotic Lizzie is 😂
I LOVE Lizzie's new origin but I'm going to miss the racoon
Thanks goodness your back ldshadowlady can't wait to watch afterlife videos and let's see how long you can survive!💜💜
Lizzie: 🌸What Else Can I Do?🌸
Omg I was craving this 😭 ITS BEEN 4 DAYS😰😭😭😭😭
This series is now my life
This is so amazing
Lizzie you should sell carved pumpkins at your shop so your costumers (like Joey) don’t have to worry about the endermen.
its my birthday today! thank you for this episode!!!!!
Please don't die this time I like how at one person is brave enuff to survive in the end
The Flammable trait might make meeting Joel awkward XD
I’m so glad it’s out I’ve checked every day for this
It's part 4 and you already died!!??
i was thinking Lizzie will die again when she looked at enderman and also her looking at end and saying: 'i did this for what?'
u almost died again queen 😭
Wait a min  I LOVE HOW U LOOK LIZZIE oMg  HAVE A GREAT DAY:DDD
U haven't post in so long lizzy
I love how the fandom went on full detective on whether her new life is candy, floran, or bee.
The waits are getting shorter and shorter.
your out fit is so cute!
I love Lizzy's outfit it matches her so well! 🌺🌻🌼
best ep ever!!!!!!of the hole series forget the future eps this is the one
13:12 This instantly cracked me up. The chaos, I love it. 🤣🤣
Lizzy: *becomes Isabelle from encanto after a raccoon prank*
Lizzy could have called the video 'New beginnings in the end' ~ lol  Love her vids tho been watching her for at leat 5 years now they always make me smile 😊
It took me a couple days to realize that she lost her raccoon abilities until I watched CPK’s video and then it hit me
I feel like instead of saying and you should say end and make it a joke
That makes you and kathrine!
Lizzie is now a plant mom
Ö
I love how Lizzy is so creative with her builds
Oo early
you have to 'rescue' Hummie from that 'dreary' prison and bring him to your new home, well if that is even possible.
That's Katherine origin
IM FINALLY EARLY! I’ve been ‘stalking’ your COMMENT
I saw smajor making the pumpkin prettier? I think you could do it too! maybe there's one with flowers??
But actually I think your new power is better •-•
Those plants/flowers are so freaking cute! What is the mod for them?
I have a suggestion Lizzie, how about you make a botanist table and change your pumpkin texture to match with your new skin
I loveeee you
I love the new origin but😭 raccoon lizzie😭.
I loved your empires videos! And your concept for it! ❤❤❤❤❤ So this is sure to be amazing!
MARRY ME LIZZY JOEL ISNT WORHT IT HE KILLS YOU IN AMONG US
lizzie can you post more AFTER LIFE vids more often
THOSE END BIOMES ARE SO COOL! I see why lizzie wants to live there
Thanks for the video, Lizzie! An idea: Since you're living in the End now, you should make an enderpearl stasis chamber! If you fall you can quickly log out and get someone to close the trapdoor and save you
I love your new origin,and your new house in the end!
noooooo
The sun is your friend, yet you chose to libe where there is no sun... 😂
Can we like have a mod list?
You should create something where you have links to all these mods because I NEED them. Love your content Lizzie, plus I’ve been watching you for over 6 years now. Pls list these mods cause I definitely need to have and know what they are.
OMG I WAS SO SCARED YOU WERE GOING TO GET LIKE A FISH!
It’s funny how Lizzie and Kathrine BOTH have the Floran origin
What mod is used for all the cool end plants?
Pls
I just love watching your channel you always make my day after crying for 6 minutes about something :>
Yesh,I AM FLOWERRRRSSSS
More
I love this series!! And Lizzy, if you do end up seeing this comment, I would love it if you could wish me a happy birthday on the 24th!! Also keep up the great work! I mean- all you can do no matter what is make me laugh so keep doing that!!
make
She had SOOO MANY PUN OPPORTUNITIES with "end entrance" AND DID'T USE THEM!!!!!!!
Xbox or pc? Minecraft or moblie
Same as katherine.OMGG
I would love if there was a floral clubhouse e!!!
Does anyone know what mods are used to make the end and nether look so cool on the server
Cutee but l miss the raccon girl 😕😀👍
Lizze will 🐝 the best end floran, you have 🐝n warned
Katherine to is a floran
I love it
Lizzie's Floran origins are BEAUTIFUL, and I feel like she needs flower fairy lights.
I just love it when Lizzie is makes a SHOP in after Life and thb when i saw Lizzie's shop I knew that she was in a good start! I love you're videos Lizzie!!
Cant wait to see all the skins this series will bring

I love the modded end so much, it's full of flowers, mushies and ✨mystery✨ just like your AMAZING shop!
8:00 I will catalog them in my inventory or should we say endventory.
Omg the after life is absolutely amazing and this one is the best video you have posted in the after life series !!!! I am so excited for the next videooooo please don’t make us wait days bc they will feel likes years bc they are so good! I have a new obsession with you now, definitely my favourite YouTuber!!!
FINALLY YOU POSTED BUT NO MORE GARBAGE and no more small rat- raccoon I mean
She turned into Isabella 😂
Lizzies domain: The end Joels domain: the nether Coincidence I think not
I absaloutly love her vids
You should texture your pumpkin head to be more ✨floral✨
LIZZY!!!You can put a pumpkin in a botanic table and it makes some faces that are soooo cute,also there are purple pumpkins that you can pay someone to get for you from the end
You should've put down water when you hit Joey! You would've dealt 2 more damage that way :) (From your absorbing ability)
Why does every member somehow get an origin that 90% relates to their irl self 😂🤣
Lizzie that’s an enchantment called end veil! You can get it and the enderman wont get mad if you look at them!!
i love the plants in the end there are more types there then the over world
I love you and your silenic
Can you sleep in the end?
Lizzie, I love how in character you always are in this series! it really adds to the feel of everything haha
omg lizzie
I love theta you did this
She could say her market is "Blossoming" ;)
You could try making a texture for your pumpkin so it is cuter! Just a little idea
Yes
Omg I love her video it is the highlight of my week just hearing her sweet voice and the time she takes to this video I’m sending lots of love for every like in the comment she makes my gloomy day be bright and happy I love her videos and watched everyone
I love this series so much! Also Lizzie if you can see this I love you so much and I love your videos and content. Your so sweet & amazing. keep doing you boo!
Love your video
you should make one of those flower planters fairy houses for all of the flowers you are gonna collect
Y E S
I KNEW YOU WILL GET THE FLORIN (like issabella in e canto)
Lizzie didn't like the portal to the End, so she made a new ENDtrance
𝙲𝚊𝚗 𝚢𝚘𝚞 𝚐𝚒𝚟𝚎 𝚢𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚎𝚗𝚍 𝚖𝚘𝚍 𝚙𝚕𝚜
Omg I am 27 min ilysm
Ld found the racoon dance button
You Should be roommates with Catherine
whatever mod was installed to enhance the end…it is MAGICAL
Baby shullllkkkk
“I have something special for you” *gets a credit card ad*
A hole new ORIGIN
hey😄
Yasssssssss that’s what kathrine gotta
:)
I was hoping someone was going to live in the end, it's so freaking beautiful! 😍✨
This was adorable and very funny!!! 🥺😁💖
✨Short Enderman✨
Here within an hour aa!!
“OLLIE, OLLIE HELP, OLLIE TELL THEM, TELL THEM TO LEAVE ME ALONE!”
i need to watch this two more times
OMG I feel sorry for you but I love you and how creative your skin is !!!
THIS IS SO COOL THAT THIS CAME OUT TODAY ME AND MY FRIEND WERE TRYING TO GUSSE WHAT LIZZIES ORIGIN WOULD BE (and i was hopping at lunch they weren't going to scream at a 7th grader like yesterday and start to cry cuz I hate it when my friends cry)
You have the same 1 as Katherine
Petition for her to make her house a giant glowing mushroom
Lizzie became isabella from encanto now
So is there a way for anyone to download these mods? Because goodness gracious do I wanna live in that version of the end (and possibly some of the cool nether biomes, and try out the unique origin races, and decorate with all the gorgeous blocks these mods add). I haven't messed around with mods much (I think I tried a vanilla tweaks mod or two, and kinda fumbled installing/using them once), but I'm willing to tackle whatever learning curve there might be if I can have so many gorgeous items in some of my minecraft worlds (although I would prefer not having the limited number of lives, because I'm not good at staying alive, and all the additional mobs would probably cause my already low survival rate to plummet).
Everybody: *DON'T DO IT LIZZY* Lizzy: *oooOoOOo pink and rainbow!* Olie: *ooo viben WAIT I SEE THIN-* Lizzy: *bud we ain't writing history your not a poet or philosopher* Joey: *AAAAA NO I'M NOT S- SCARED!*
When you can see her move and jump off as if she meant to end her raccoon life on purpose 😶
invite kathrine
I was already thinking of cosplaying raccoon Lizzie but now I’m going to cosplay floran Lizzie
You should build a garden in honor of your Floran background
You can probably put a texture pack on the pumpkin for you to not look as scary:) if it's possible.
I'm so excited to see Lizzie decorate with all the plants in the end, they're so pretty
Yes released at 6 am perfect time not to sleep
Omg this is so pretty thé plants Btw what mod are u using
You should make your own small floating island and build your house there
Don't make a bedroom, it's the end.
This power fits Lizzie so much!!❤️
wait.....If lizzie is a floral and Katherine is the first floral....Does that mean u gonna be sisters in the series????(I would love if lizzie will be a floral forever because she has a mentor which is Katherine and she said that she loves her new powers except for the fact that she can't climb anymore)
You got Katherine’s power
LdRacoonLady will be missed
I am not a member so I cant talk     .    .                                                                   (

Hiiii Lizi
THERE NEEDS TO BE A MOD TO MAKE THE PUMPKINS DIFFERENT COLORS ANS LETS YOU CARVE CUTE FACES
Hi Lizzie I think maybe you can make a really cute path towards your home and beehive! Love you video btw
Can we all just appreciate how good this person's content really is ❤️
This is my favorite series from all of you! I have been waiting for everyone’s new episodes after all of the deaths.
Lizzie you need to get a over world/Ender companion /pet <3
Ldshadowlady: exotic Me cutting her off in real life: BUTTeRs My best friend: NO
Please build your own house in the end and live in the end forever
Silly Goose UwU
The little raccoon just wanted to rule the End but instead her plans were foiled by the void
Amazing! The End was definitely a good choice for you, I love how you used the rainbow crystals to make a rainbow greenhouse! 10/10
OoooooOooooo
Now raccoon lizzie is gone. May she rest in spaghetti never forgetti.
You are such an amazing creator lizzy, I’m so happy I found your channel! Love your videos they bring me so much joy! Keep doing what your doing😁
It's surprising that your living in the end 😃😃
Da baby shulk
Yes finally a new upload!
I love it I want that mod.
Tdggg
I LOVE THIS EPISODE
So vid was soo good btw big fan
I love your vids Ty for the effort you put in to every second of editing and making us happy for our benefit
You can Mack your own house  🏡 🏡 🏠🏠
The evil plan failed. Now we no longer have a beautiful raccoon. Oh well. More evil plans to come, I’m sure.
Joel as a Blazeborn and Lizzie as a Floran, the two of the closest people on the Afterlife SMP but is World apert... Literaly.
Nine minutes old when I clicked it took me so long
Baby shulker<3
Will this be a mod pack that will come out?
8:38  *Flashbacks from empires* *INTENSE FLASHBACK OF JOEY'S TOXIC RELATIONSHIP WITH XORNOTH*
I WANT THIS MODPACK WHERE CAN I FIND ITTTT
OMG
I love the way you find a way to do things in a way that it wasn't intended, and just thrive in the chaos that ensues.
I love these videos so much!
I’m sad that Lizzie’s raccoon life had to end but her new home is beautiful and so ‘Lizzie’! Pink everywhere and the flowers represent her! I can’t wait to see how much prettier she’ll make the End with her building and ideas 🔥💕
Have my like just for that boat shimmy
"or i could live in this lake with these lillypads"  *empires flashback*
IM SUPER EARLY!!
this episode makes my life feel complete👾
25minets
The flowers fit Lizie's personality🌹🌹╰(*°▽°*)╯
Does this mean you can read now?
Omg I want all of those flowers
I’ve been waiting for what feels like forever for this
I love your shop!!! and your skin is so cute💖
I love orionsounds reaction of “I would love some flowers from my home land” lol
I'm so excited for this new origin! I also think that you should build nice bridges between each platform that you get plants from. Maybe each bridge could be made out of stuff from the biome it's going into?
I'm loving the series Lizzie I've been such a big fan and good luck with the flower business
Moor
hello! i love your content lizzy :D not in a creepy way tho
What mod is this?
Katherine: you need to stay in the sun Lizzie: okay so im gonna move somewhere wheres no sun!
LIZZIE!!! You should Make a secret base/meeting area with flower people
OMG YAY IM EARLY
Hi
I think you can get a different punkin in the nether but Scott has things from the nether
omg the end biomes are so fricking adorable?! the crystal greenhouse is so cuteee, name suggestion: Crystal Crysalis maybe?
Can you make an end flower house
I fear that your Florian life will be cut short due to the skinny and horrible looking pathways/bridges between floating islands  What if you were to make bridges that looked like end flora? (Such as roots ) or end themed bridges if to your liking
the first thing i thought when joey cae to buy some plants is stop talking like a straight man because you arent one 💀
GO TO KATHIRINE
I just finished watching it and I love the end biomes! I can't wait to see how far you get by the end of the series, I'm sure whatever you make by the end will be amazing!
ahh yes lizzie has reached her final form no more pet graveyard just a lizzie graveyard
Ekkkkk
Lizzy, PLEASE TELL ME, WHAT IT THAT END MOD, I NEED IT RN😭😭😭😭😭😭
I started watching you when I was 5 and now I'm 8
i love this idea so much im doing fan art now
ALL THE PLANTS LOOK SO COOL AND BEAUTIFUL  😍  💕
Omg imagine if she died right there after just becoming a floran ;-; that would've been so sad
From a racon to a flower lady
Hey Lizze do you know you have the Same origin as katherine
i’m getting anxiety each time lizzie runs across a thin bridge over the void
I love your NEW HOME I WANT ITTTTTT
😳😢😭
Lizzie really suits being a Floran
Lizzie is yassifying the end
I wonder if ita possible to get the same origin again...?
What is this mod, I need it
Please make a safer bridge..
Omg I have been on pins and needles for this video ever since you posted the last one!
:]
Hello my childhood youtuber that still watch
Early <3
That was really unexpected though...😳
Me at the end of the video: Lizzie please no don’t end the video
Yes yes yes
I AM FREAKING OUT OVER THIS END MOD *gahdhdhhdhdhrhejj*
You should absolutely build a tree house to live in that connects to other trees and place
:0
Omg look its LDFloranlady wait.....
I’m going to miss racoon lizzie 😔
It’s really weird to think that 9months ago you posted your first empires episode and now it over and your doing another AMAZING series <3
11:40 • now that my store is complete, I will turn my attention to the “end-trance”, would have been a good pun!
Your house is SO CUTE!!!!!!!! And I'm a very big fan, I've been watching your videos for so long. I've got a suggestion for you too. Maybe you could build a secret base to keep your treasures in? Bye Lizzie, I'm a big fan
I want to live in the end now (yes I even will wear the pumpkin for the rest of my life)
Is that music from a mod cause if it ain't I want it
hear me out hear me out ✨ender chest mailbox✨ 😂
that was such a cool take on the end, honestly i havent played in a while but it looks so cool!!
I love this episode of this series I hope you win the rare golden egg
Waited 3 days and it was amazing 👌👌👌👌
I feel so connected 😊🌹🌸💐
YOU SHOULD MAKE A TEXTURE FOR THE PUMPKIN LIZZY!!!
I LOCE END FLOREN LIZZIE what mod are you using TELL ME
Lizzie there is a pumpkin more with the style you have its a purple punpkin and its found in the nether

You should live with Katherine pls live with her plsssss
YOU SHOULD MAKE GLOWING BRIGGES CONNECTING THE BIOMES
THE END IS SO PRETTY AND MAGICAL OMG
Lizze, I think it would be a cool idea to re-texture the pumpkin to a flowering bush you wear on your head 🌸💮
missed some great pun opportunities: the End-trance (entrance and end) My End business is *Blooming* (cause flowers)
Finally I have been waiting for this
Snorlax
And she have the Same gender with someone the that lives it the place with blue purple tree she

Love her take on the floran and the end has so much potential so excited to see the builds

R.I.P Racoon

21 min ago
Who else misses LDRaccoonLady? 😭
Omg I’ve never been so early
Everything’s gonna be deforested before shes done with her house 💀
You were the only one to die of "Natural" causes in your trap. The end has no sunlight at all, I thought you would wither away.
HELLLOOOOO
Yay I love LD shadolady!
Yayyyy
Hi Lizzie how are you

Kathrine and Lizzie's origin are  so cute 🍄🌺😌
gamer
Aww man I really wish she was a raccoon forever because the outfit was cute but this one as a floran is also cute
What I learned was that  Evil raccoon = New floran
issabella who?
I love the floran origin. I always love using it
20 min early :D
This is amazing
kathrine has a sister now
I love your videos and what is the end mod that you show in the end
Make videos every day you're interesting and that's why I watch you and I'm sad when you don't upload cuz you're interested and you only upload one or two days I can't remember but upload every game please you're interested
:D
yaasasasasa
this is so beautiful! although I think you should also work on the entrance to the end on the over world, so that people don't just jump in a hole and land in the end. also, do you know what mod your using for the end? it looks so pretty! PS  I love the series so far and I think both the racoon and floren organ suit you very well!  :)
i love you
Earlyyyyy
The raccoon shall live on
I know u would get the bee origin
Thanks for the best video love it keep it up
Helllooooooooooooooo
I was waiting for this post. YESSS!!!
It looks like this home will be better then all the others
Lizzy is Isabella from Encanto now. Btw love your vids, continue what you do queen.
The chat wss so positive when you went in the end
Flower’s are the best
Oops just realised she made a shop XD
You should totally make a end floran skin since the one you have looks pretty normal
Old Lizzie would die over the end
Your house is beautiful Lizzie :D
It's just never an LDShadowLady video without chaos 💀 That lil shimmy, the beautiful collection of end plants, and of course, oli's interrupted epiphany are so far my top favorites in this series! Can't wait for more!
Name the fish your favourite flower
The new origin is great!! I love the idea Lizzie is going for !
ldracoonlady is out, ldfloranlady is in 🌼✨
Ironic if you think about it, her old resting place is her new home. Or maybe I'm overanalyzing this, I am fresh out of English class.
Early!
i love this 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Omg 😱
Noice!
No u will go back to the over world pls
So you are just A pink haired Isabella madrigal... I LOVE IT
The end is so pretty in this SMP, I'm really excited to see what she'll do next!!
I feel bad for laughing so much at 13:07
i love how lizzie broke the one rule of of staying in the sun XD
You should build some bridges from one biome to another instead of walking on dirt paths
What is the mod for this beautiful plant life in the end I must know
she's ALIVE
I love your videos when will you make the next episode? If you will do it tomorrow that would be great cuz tomorrow it my birthday
Hello I’m early I loved this new episode though!
What else can I do  Lol
Early!! Love you lizzie i am still waiting for walking dead season 2 from you <33
So your also. bone meal?now too Aww I just thought if you could sell compost making it from leftovers or small kinds of trash tho probably not I can't to wait see what Katharine got you  Wait humie has been abandoned? Is that how you spell his name
Nothing like her husband
31st
👹“✨ B A B Y S H U L K ✨” 👹
THIS IS AMAZING

if Lizzie makes a base, it should be a big flower or tulip or smth
The end floren (florin?)
8 MINUTES AGO AND IM HERE
Shulk's reaction to the baby shulk was so sweet oh my god
You’re just like Katherine
Love the fact that she ALMOST DIED to an enderman in the FIRST video being a floran ✨
Not earlyyyyyyyyy Joey: Im NoT sCaReD
Shulk is toughest boi 🥺
Yassssss

Hi Lizzie!I luv your vids:))And loving this series!hope everyone is having a great day! :D
I love this one it’s so cute and I love how creative you where by going to the end to gather all the pretty plants and build the most cutest little buildings ever <3
i already miss racoon lady its been 3 eps with her R.I.P Raccon Lady wait... no one will collect the rubbish now
Omg I was waiting for you to post another after life vid
Baby shulk
:c i like ratcoon lizzy
Those biomes were so pretty~ I am LIVING OFF of these videos ❤❤
I love how unique you made your origin omg
i got soooo sad when empiers ended but now i have a new thing to wach😊😊
If you're queen of the end, does that mean you're in charge of Ollie?
That was so funny like . Oml. Lizzie* oh my god I looked at an Enderman. OLI HELP! Oli* I un um I
Lizzie i was the 3 person to watch this ( me patting myself on my back ) i love your videos there perfectly funny
what about your old house :(
You are the best
i absolutely love lizzie as the end floran!! the end is so beautiful and it has the right amount of chaos that is clearly lizzies forte!!
17 mins early HELL YEAH
SHIMMY SHIMMY! I love it! That should be your victory or happy dance when you volley new flowers 🌸! ❤️😁also I love you so much and I’ve been watching you ever since the beginning ❤️❤️ lots of love and I am enjoying this series very much!!
"oH YeA"
More ldshadowlady cosplay content
It’s an ENDtrance…get it?
You could even add some nether flowers if your up for the challenge!
I honestly love how Joey says “Baby shulk🥺” 😂
I feel bad for you because a racoon is very good-
raccon lizzie was the best but floran lizzie is 💠growing💠 on me
I'm gonna miss the raccoon life tho
Same origin as Katherine
I loved the idea of living in the end
You should start a shop like Joel and Katherine and make sell loads of different kinds of end plants and flowers! By the way I love your vids!
This was the best episode yet ❤ Keep going End queen!
The end is another dimension, the plants could be danger es to the over world.
OMG I LOVE THE END!!!!😍🍄😆
The Racoon was fun while it lasted but now it's time for Lizzie's true form to shine... The Crazy Plant Lady
I kept song what else can do from Encanto throughout the video LOL
omg i love your new origin but lets take a moment to commemorate raccoon lizzie rip 😞🤚 keep up the good work!
I didn't think it was possible to get the same origins that somebody on the server already has
I love this
Wow!!L!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Listen. I want to know what the mod is that makes the end have all of these things. Tell me. I want to know.
ADORABLE
This is so cool and the end looks crazy
Omg I’m so early
We were only three episodes in and lizzie died. I'm not shocked
The end is so pretty in this mod! I hope we get stuff like that when they update the end eventually!
OMG THIS SERIS IS THE BEST
I like how Lizzie died in the end and now she's decided to live in it
Oh the end bioms are so beautiful omg what resource pack is that 😍😍😍
Ldflowerlady
Lizzie there are these workbenches in a mod you have and I think it is the floral/Botanist's workbench? But if you make that workbench, you could make a custom pumpkin that could be your forever pumpkin you wear in the end! An example is GeminiTay's roof which has a gradient of pink to green pumpkins. I hope this helped! 💖💖💖
I really want lizzie to stay like this forever because of how cool the end is!
Lizzy lauren is make you her enemy Becerful Lizzy lauren is coming for you....
It's only been 15 minutes and it already has 47kveiws
I love your house!! The biomes in the end are super pretty! Didn’t even notice the fifteen minutes went by
i need another
I love ur vids so much Lizzie I hope to one day be like you in Minecraft
Honestly i loved this episode so much the end is such a good idwa
13:04 I’m crying I can’t breathe 😭😭😭
For some reason, I feel like the end was made just for Lizzie❤️❤️
Lizzie. I love your videos so much, it is crazy. You raised me. I love you forever.
I love your channel so much I want to make my own please show this in your next video
Could you make a pack of mods pls it's very cute, also i love your videos and there your sooooooo funny love u
Shulk is my favourite character now
I really like all the new things! If you ever hear word of a new raccoon on the server, maybe pass your tray business onto them. *for a reasonable fee*
Look man, if you’re gonna have an epiphany can you go do it elsewhere  Lizzie 2022
"Wie" Lizzie I died
I had a dream that you became a giant and CPK was a raccoon and Jimmy was cut in half. Wild
13:12 Enderman: this is a robery!!! Give moneys!!!
Lizzie I just have to say in the last episode pure havoc broke free and engines were made (also house idea the wishing tree!)
So cute Joey and baby shulk
Wow I would love to live in the end dimension! AmaZing choice Lizzie!
Tbh I love the end now you made the best decision ever
Now I’m tempted to make a ender flower skin for Lizzie XD Also! There is something that can make your pumpkin purple or blue! To make your aesthetic fit more! :]
I am soo glad the mincraft series are back
She can customize her pumpkin head to have a cute face
I was going to do this when she or anyone died but here we go. Context I got bored and decided to Chronicle the afterlifers lives. Here is Ms ShadowLadys at least for the raccoon  LDShadowLady- current Lives 9 Life 1 Raccoon  Major Achievements Helped every player go green putting trash can in their bases Found the End Portal Successfully tricked GemniTay into her trading hall Successfully tricked others into fighting the Ender Dragon  Cause of Death Karma- fell off the edge of the End platform Rip: Racoon Ep 1-3
i love the new skin 🖤
love your videos, please continue being aesthetic and wonderful!
Switched at birth: ALSMP edition. Featuring Lizzie and Oli!!
The way she was telling oli to tell the endermen to leave her alone had me creasing 😂
Lizzie should build an enchanting area
oli’s my favourite in every series his characters r so fun
Amazing 👏
Can someone tell me the outro music's name pls
I love how Lizzie got above and beyond for her ideas
I’m gonna say it  The end is frikkinn awesome on afterlife

You should build a big flower from the end for decoration or something else!! :D
Omg lizzie!! I was waiting and so excited to see what your new origin was!! I love it sm!!
Love the video
I wonder how this origin turns out
Lizzie can literally take kathrines roll and take her whole shop when Kathrine dies lol

Nuuuuu I want raccon lizzi back D:
I wish that in one of lizzies other lives she can be a mermaid it will bring back Empires memories
Hey Lizzie!
I love you new origin, and where you love is sooooooo cuuuuuttttteeeee
Loll I love that Lizzie is wearing a pumpkin on her head and Oli is the first one to visit her which makes her have to take off her pumpkin and led to her being attacked by endermen 😂
That's awesome
BABY SHULK<33
Lizzie! You should build little apartments for your friends so they can visit you!
You know what even though being a flower human in this game has its downsides for you you live in this really beautiful end volume from a mod because there's no way this would be from anything but a mod
1:36 u sound good 😩
OMG I AM SO EARLY I AM SUCH A BIG FAN
Early!!
There are no chockens in the end. There are still no chickens in the end.  God tier stuff
I was like nooo Lizzie
This is the perfect origin for lizzie, I mean she loves flowers!
Not the RACCOON! SAD!
:)    ❤
Early!
Yesss I’ve been waiting!
i love this series so far <3 ive been watching her for so long
You should wear a whispering gourd instead of a pumpkin 🎃
The end is sooo cuteee reminds me of another series she had
I have never ever been this early! It's sad you lost the raccoon origin but this floran origin will surely be fun!
You are a adorable floren and I think you and Katherine should team up so more cuteness 🌸🌺🌼🌻🍄🌄🐝
Blub
Omg love you you are amazing 👏 💗
SHE DOES THE SPARKLE SHIMMY ✨💃✨
15 min mark!!
is it just me or did it look like she JUMPED off and died
I just sall something about your new outfit and now you have that outfit
Who knew how ✨magical✨ the end could be🤷🏻‍♀️
The red one looks perfect for joel! 🤩
early :D
OMG THIS IS SOOO CUTE
i love your videos lizzie! i’m watching right now as i’m sick, and i feel much better already
I just woke up I can't believe that I'm early!I love Floran Lizzie 🌸
“There are no chickens in the end..” *throws egg* “There are still no chickens in the end-“
Wow a cool vid finally!
lol
It would be cool of when they die and re birth into something else they "lose their memory"so they don't remember being a raccoon before or even being in that world at all
What about the villagers you can't just leave them
I’ll miss Raccoon Lizzie🦝
help not baby shulk😭😭
I miss raccoon Lizzie already
Lizzie is so chaotic... THATS WHY I SUBSCRIBED
Her new skin is beeautiful 🤩
“There are no chickens in the end!” *breaks egg* “There are still no chickens in the end!” Lauren: *sad avian noises*
Lizzie your plant life in the end is so cute
Yay I’m right on time!
Do you have katherine's origin
Whatever mod this is… it has created some of the most beautiful biomes I’ve seen in Minecraft. Those End biomes are amazing!
😂 this video was Hilarious
Eeeeeeeeee
Love how she’s always the opposite of Joel 😭
Hi Lizzie :D
I was litterally just looking for ep 4 like 20 mins ago, AND NOW YOU DECIDE TO SHOW UP??
Go to the flower shop
Lizzie makes me happy to just see her video’s
I would love if vannila minecraft end were 1/100 of the beauty of this mod's end
It felt like I was waiting for a whole year but  it was worth it
Maybe you could change your outfit to match the end theme?
Oh my lord what mod is this my eyes are burning 😩😩😩
those end forests have a chance to make a tree house
What you did was very evil, but hey, now you're a Floran!
You and kafren are both floresns .????! UF SO YES YES YRS YESSSSS
WAIT WAIT WAIT OK sooo you have Katherines ya know rogin? (I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPELL ITTTT)
Wow I got here in 12 mins

I didn’t even remember that she should switch roles XD
YAYYYYYYYYY
I cried when you died out of laughter-
Hi
My WiFi keeps dieing, but i watch in episodes
Lizzie and Scott are running the same business🤣🤣🤣
Can we appreciate Lizzie's amazing Skins??
I can't believe how cute your base is! I also love your videos! :)
U are like Katharine
“look man if you’re gonna have an epiphany can you go do it elsewhere”
U should make a cave so u can live as any animal like all the rooms are all the needs And u can decorate like a geode!
Let’s see what happens next ep
I love the video especially the end but like… next thing you know the nether is gonna be a pretty pink princess castle

Lizzie and Katherine are now sisters threw the plants
I was really shocked when Lizzy died last episode so I hope this one lasts more than 2 days.
The end mod makes it so you can sleep in the end btw
I KNEW YOU WOULD BE A FLORAN
your new skin is so cute!
I like how she jumped into the end while trying to crouch
OMG 8 minutes ago?! And I've been waiting for a new episode!! Luv ur vidoes!!

Congrats if you’ve been this early
Florians based on all of the dimensions hmmmmmm

Our queen is amazing!
YESSSSSS IVE CHECKED LIKE 8 TIMES TODAY, also lizzy is now the new coolest afterlife smp player, she’s living in the end and can only eat two things sunlight and honey bottles both are not natural resources in the end 😳
Question: is this a mod or is that the actual end now cuz i really do not know
I love you Lizzie! I can’t wait for your new origin!
You should get a book so you can record all the plants you find!!!
Youtube Notification: LDShadowLady uploaded a new video: New Life Ep 4 Afterlife Me 1 millisecond later: **aggressively clicks**
THIS WAS SO COOL
Lizzie never fails to entertain
3 minutes after it got uploaded

She do go ✨shimmy shimmy✨
Ngl, it really was a hilarious backfire 😂
Hiii Lizzie!!! How are you :D
The chat though: No Lizzie don’t do it
I kinda thought there couldn't be 2 of the same origin because when megan got giant Scott told her to reroll

Is the mod just called the afterlife mod? Or is there a specific link for this mod? Because i genuinely adore this concept of a playthrough. And i would honestly love to play on my own :)

Same origin as Katherine I think. Love this series SO MUCH so far. And I thought empires was the best thing
Florian. Idea how about you make your own  beautiful  garden of bees for honey and just for you to survive
Dose that make you and Katherine super friends or something
I absolutely LOVE your new outfit! It reminds me of Sailor Mars' famous pink overalls!
OMG I love every outfit you have for both the origins you had/have they are so cute 😭

OMG you got the same thing as Kathrine!
I haven't watched it yet but can't wait to see what new origin you have!!!
Sad karma poor raccoon lizzy😢
Now u and katheren have the same power!
Anyone else rewatches all of her old videos and think they are more perfect everytime u watch them
So Lizzie is highly flammable and Joel is constantly on fire… that should be interesting 😂
Ooo you and katrine have the same power flower besties
Anyone else remember the chaos last ep.?
Omfg third view
This will be a good life Lizzie ! I feel like the end can be dangerous but a good area to stay because you can't sleep, like your a racoon still ! (R.I.P Racoon Lizzie, you'll be missed)
Love this!!!
Ooo new origin! The ending of the last thing was so harsh-
Doesn’t some one else have that same origin?
Yoooooooo I'm early to last life Les goooooooo
