Amazing.....🔥
Its amazing the lyrics he comes up with
Words are not enough! 💜🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿💜
tbh. i like this version better. ren + guitar is just the best!
Nice!!!!   Started my morning with this video!!! Look out, world!
Hahaha I love this version!!!!
What is a genius about writing a song that speaks of a murderous mind.  Bruh so bla bla bla
Me encanta!!!
REN’s, Animal Flow is the soundtrack of a new Prime series, The Girlfriend.
Love the abrupt ending. So happy you left it in.
love it, thanks…
What insanity sounds like haha. Amazing song but it's so dark
I'm ready to be feasted on 😂
S
superb
Lmao the cheetah print never gets old🥵 hi daddy lmao
true beast
Why is he such a genius? I love this in acoustic! Just found it today.
ren, I love your music.  keep creating !!!
I love the video version. But honestly this is so stripped back that it really makes you appreciate how captivating Ren is. Just his voice and a guitar… his storytelling, the feeling in his voice, his facial expressions, body movements… his scatting/beatboxing/sounds whatever he calls the tunes that are in almost all of his music which makes it so authentically Ren. He’s by far the most creative artist I’ve ever come across. ❤
#LongLiveRen
One of my favorites! Now, everyone would agree that you got quite a few masterpiece in your repertoire BUT what can I say, this one wakes my inner beast-roaaar, cuz let's be honest, after all, we all from the same kingdom, yea?
Amazing talent..Better than previous version.
Ok I legit love this acoustic version way more than the original
Acoustic version is also pure fire 🔥
Love the acoustics !  Just like Troubles. Prob I’m old school. lol. But which ever way Ren preforms, is always a treat. He’s so good at his craft. I feel honored he has let the world in on his compared to none genius 💖💖🎶🎶
I am always blown away by Ren's talent. I would love to see the outtakes too ; I wonder if there were any performances with an obvious mistake. The reason I wonder this is because I think of how much practice it would take for me to get through this song from beginning to end without making ay glaring mistakes. If I could learn to perform this song in the first place , at any level,  I can imagine myself getting 75%, 90%, or 95% of the way through and then saying the wrong words or something worse and having to ride that bus to the end of the line trying to get it right.
My 4yr old just sat watching this captivated, there is hope for the future generations.
HAPPY JUNTEENTH! It's an American Holiday. I do realize you are not American...but are we not all for celebrating the emancipation of oppressed people at any time, in any nation? I know I know Ren...ok not literally but I know Ren would be all like .."HELL YA!"..❤
Ren genius ❤❤
I love you~ be ~ be you drooling drunk with thought of you, creepy wanna play ~

Love this version!
Appreciate the attention to detail, even in less produced performances like this. I feel like I notice something new each time I re-watch Ren's videos.
When I saw this I thought that it wouldn’t work as well acoustically but I’m glad to say I was proven incorrect 😌  never been happier to be proven wrong about anything
❤#Ren. You are just an amazing artist. 💯🔥💜🫶🎵❤️🙏👍
👌🤯😍
🔥🔥♥️🔥🔥
Put this on iTunes I want this version I would pay for it.
I haft to say this is now my favorite acoustic track ❤❤
❤
Ugh! I love just REN and a guitar. It’s so fucking magical.✨ Better than the recorded version for me.
absurd 🤩
Normally Dont LOSTH😂😂😂😂😂 PEEP HOLES AS REVENGE IS A DISH BEST SERVED COLD BUT TODAY I Ampised
This is freaking genius. I am left speechless. I love the video too but THIS RIGHT HERE. Just a musical prodigy and his guitar, he makes the beat. Everyday I seem to have a new Ren favorite, so many layers!❤
Animal flowwwwwww brooooo 😊
Unbelievable you have accomplished having a 60 year old aging punk rocker listening to rap!❤
🔁🦖🦎🐢🐍
ma ti si čudo neviđeno... kako poslije Rena išta slušati
Fooking genius. Lots of love drom this decrpid 51 yr old truck driver, so good ❤✊🏼
Glad he kept it!
You’re amazing man beautiful music. I’m the baby in bathwater with a bubble, and I ghosted their machines.
Pleeeeeeaaaase put this version on spotify!
(yumyumyumyumyum)
Need this on my Spotify asap. Pretty please 🤘
Terminates here, all change please...
You're so handsome my love
As i have said previously ... One of Gods finest creations  , forged and infused with intelligence , talent , innovative  and with  that handsome face , thank you Lord !  xx 🌹 Dana
You are so amazing!
She cooked him...twice! 😂

Ugh those growwwwwls. Love this man so much
Ren...Wow !
Mate where were you on my old bus route lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Magic !!
Unique and beautiful
How great this is.
Only 690 k views? Why? Nov 30 2024
I could listen to this man’s voice forever and be very happy.
One of my fondest memories of being on late night Manchester busses is this drunk-of-his-arse old man singing (slurring) Sex Bomb by Tom Jones with conviction at something-AM. We're still talking about it (and imitating it) 10+ years later and lol-ing every time. Can you image having been on that bus with Ren doing THIS?!?!?!?! I'll just say Sex Bomb pales in comparision. 😂
Is mouse a metaphor for something else 🤔😉 I've stabbed with a particularly eager finger 😏
5th string sounds 3ct sharp. 😂 ruined the song   i think ren would agree 😅
nice.
Needed to hear this after whats happened to the US on November  5th, its how I'm feeling 😢
Plays guitar, plays piano, singa,raps Ren is a musical fkin genius ❤
Bloody brilliant, and i loved that the bus turned and it all went to cock at the end. HAHA,  That's life innit. sometimes it just happens when you least expect. At least you were keeping it real.
First time hearing the acoustic version--fabulous!!! 💜💙😎💖❤️
❤❤❤
I like this version better, shows just how talented you really are, wow!!!!!
Yes🎉❤
The amount of I would give to have this version on Spotify. Love this, love you, and I can't wait for more amazing music Ren ♥
There's talent, there's exceptional talent and then there's Ren! I can't believe what you come up with, Boi. I love you ❤️
Ok, that was Awesome. I am Impressed.
Brilliant
💜💜💜
Favorite version by far. Busking has turned this guy into a live performance superstar
When the acoustic versions are even better than the originals you know you’re watching an incredible talent unfold
Ren and Prof are two of the greatest live performers of all time. Their live performances are always better than the studio version. Especially Prof. with Ren it’s hard not to see any content he puts out, live or studio, as anything less than magnificent.
I'm still in awe after every song I watch of Ren's and that's after discovering him a couple years ago. It's rare someone this special comes along. Not to mention Ren looks fantastic in this leopard print jacket. Plus his theatrics are so damn good.
The irl ad-libs on this bring joy to my cold little heart
This is so cool 😎
Fucking magnificent
Man . I just want to say thank you. It's nice to hear the things I think out loud. Still hanging on by my fingers. Just the tips, lol.shit. I guess it will be ok someday. 🙈
Love the music but why in a bus full of dicks?
Woah! Incredible he's able to do this as acoustic :O
Beastmode let the flow goooo.
This was great
I tried to catch the „rolling drum vocal patterns“ for both the acoustic and the original version of this song (they seemed to be a little different from each other). It was a lot of fun trying to figure them out and to write them down! 😊I don’t know if I got all of them right (and I am also no native speaker, but this isn’t necessarily English anyway, I guess ^^). This is what I got, for anyone interested (Part 1-3 in the comments):
Holy fuckballs, Amazing!
Isn’t it incredible when the divinity within us blocks out the humanity around us and we can *almost* define the eternal. Meanwhile Others are infatuated with Brazilian butt lifts and keeping up with some “family” on TV and what shoes we wear.   It’s like the universe wants to taunt us for gazing into its eyes- for paying too much attention. We become hyper aware of creation and it stands up and towers over us in it’s infinite vastness and squashes us back down to the size of a bug.  so we wrestle for the rest of our mortal existence to forget what we came to merely catch a glimpse of. Doing all we can to evade mortality and in the bitter end…  It echoes and resonates within us until we tame the chaos or it breaks us into dust.  Help. Help me.
I need this on Spotify real bad
I am not ashamed to admit that the growl he has does things to me.
Friday, June 28th 2024 ….Fuckkkkkkk yea….. 😳🎶🎸🎤🕶️🎼💫 NC, USA
❤
Practicing on the Bus 🚌. Only Ren 🙏❤️🙏
Congratulations Ren & mates 🎉
❤❤❤
I would have liked to ride this bus😊
It always amazes me when an artist creates a miracle no matter the circumstances
Brilliant. Fantastic video in such a simple setting. Ren is such a genius!
Happy Belated Birthday Animal Flow (Acoustic ) As of today -  632,815 views  Premiered May 18, 2023

A comment to appease the Algorithm Godz ↕
Absolutely love this…. All this time later. 🎸
🖤
Simply amazing
This is definitely the better version.
Fucking BRILLIANT
I just saw an ad in Australia using your Animal Flow audio. Hope you are getting paid for it. Love your work.
I would absolutely buy an acoustic Sick Boi album!
buskin in the buss man.great take.
You are just so amazing, I can't get enough of your music and videos and I'm introducing you to anyone I can in the US ❤
Now being used by Mitsubishi in a TV ad in Australia. Hope the royalties are flooding in Ren!
Wish I was on that bus so much 💔
Wystarczy gitara, głos. Słychać muzykę i emocje.
I've been listening to your songs for a long time! and you know that
Great bus ride, i was there, awesome in the raw 🎉
Never have I ever been so captivated by an acoustic version but this dude is on another level just amazing
My mouse is a guinea pig and struggles with authority figures so i had to tap gently with my pinky. I hope thats ok boss 🤟
Where i can buy this Jacket?! I hate leapard print, but this one is awesome!
woah!! this hit way different from the other version, i love the music you make
Jesus the talent! Ive written rap albums, metal albums, and an accoustic. I cant even imaging approaching this.
Absolutely sick this is just done while travelling and it was cut short as they had to get off haha  Epic performance
Les Claypool beat? ❤
Its funny, I remember headtilting when I saw this listed. It was the first and last time I doubted you. ❤
🤙💜
Brilliant. 😎👍
How many variations of the Bm chord in this version))
Love your live Versions. you’re a whole band in your voice and your guitar 🙏🏾🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧
Rap goes punkrock, yeeeeees!!!
What did she say?  She said, "Yes. Fuck Yes."
Amazing!
Thanx so much for keeping it! Top-1 my playlist! Hello from Russia!
Love this song and the lyrics definitely got the animal flow. Fighting this disease I have. Love you Bro❤
Dude Cillian Murphy is super talented
...a real millipede on his feet! Je suis très admirative. Mille mercis ❤
finally someone make good music
This is my absolute favorite version. Genius!
I’d take my kids for dark storytime with Ren any day 😂
Take a guitar on a bus and make perfection. Simple. Well, if you're Ren you can.
you should talk to yelawolf, mate
🙋‍♂Lol so who else did the _yumyumyumyumyum_ parts when it was time? 😆
YO is it me or is the beginning "doo-da doo-da" section a vocal part of Money Game part 2? I swear it's the same 🧐
Never seen anything like this in my life. Makes me want to stop doing music. The kid is the future if music.
My soul is soaring again even as I lay on a heating pad for the moment😂🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
These might be my fav videos. The live acoustic ones. When there's just Ren and his guitar - that's where the magic begins for me.
Even sitting singing on a bus with a guitar this boy is brilliant 🤩
Any accoustic version of ren is top tier 🎶🎶🔥🔥🔥
OMG ! Ren! I stumbled across violets tale last night and since I've listened to every single song on here twice.. I don't think I've ever heard anything like this, you speak to my soul. I'm blown away! Any chance you might be coming to Seattle any time in the near future? I'm sprung!!  RESPECT!
Siiiiiicknesss... unplugged and still super sick. Love your work man <3
This is amazing, I love this as much as the other version!
Ren your the best
Your a f-ing genius! Don’t ever stop
I only found out about you like 3 weeks ago and I'm already obsessed. This music has take over my life.
The scat sorta Jack black style he does in this song is just fucking amazing. This is a million times better then the normal release in my opinion
I literally love you just so talented ❤
Keep making music. You’re reaching people. Truly.
Bus driver—-is this guy going to kill and eat me?😂
Wow.
okay so obviously this is amazing but what really is amazing is the way a guitar just becomes an extension of rens limbs and not only used to carry the tune the timing but also to express his self he's so good at creating a mood
Think I prefer you like this...its raw acoustic...the message becomes clearer... brilliant stuff fella!!
This is my favourite version.
Raw ... banging ... tune ... respect ❤❤❤
The craziest thing is slowing this down and hearing how every word is pronounced so clearly
Wow❤
Wooooooooo! You are a madman and i love you. Sick boi album is so good and this was the first track that stood out to me first. This acoustic version is beautiful too.   One thing that blows my mind is how you are not just a master songwriter and rapper but a really good singer, and playing too? Multi threat.   I wish you better health and continued success Ren. Hang in there sick boi. We love you.   Ooooh aaahhh, te ookety ahh. 😮 😫
Mesmerizing ...you got me in a stupor Ren.
As an animal that is years old…roar
damn I’m inlove
This is so brilliant! Ren you are a genius artist!  Please do more stuff like this!
Glad they kept it, just in case.
Back here again. This is magic. Numero Uno, come on.
HARD AF🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪💯
Ren fucked my flow, because I always told people my 3 favorite rappers were Slim Shady, Eminem and Marshall Mathers.  Ren is my favorite now.
Stabbed it! I love this!!
You’re a genius
I just fucking love both versions of this song so much!
Where's the fuckin "mniam mniam mniam mniam" ?? i was waitin g for it:)
There are so few videos on YT that I come back to, over and over again. This is one of them, for sure!
Brilliance 🎉
also....btw....if it mean anything.....the 1.19 bit is why your stuff works for me.....
Dood this is so dirty guitar is so perfect 😮❤
Wooooow. Never liked animal flow much, one of the few. This just brings it home for me.
Ren, you are amazing, your talent are beyond words. i love your stuff, never stop cos no one is at your level
When you play and perform like this, you're not just "tyrannical," Ren, you're tyrannosaurical . . . Rex!
This dude
That was amazing!
Fucking fire 🔥
🔥🔥🔥
When you eventually get to tour, worldwide (please come to Prague), you'll sell out everywhere you go, no matter the venue. I love your energy, your talent, you. Infectious. Genuine. Phenomenal.
Ive been drowning soul frowning ill never be whole however Ren has been an instant inspiration to work on creation. I have to stay high or my mind will die. Im also mentally ill so this inspiration is chill. I am dead still but this is a sign from the divine to resign my mind find the muse to help caste this spell to bring down hell on the ones running the ruse. All this confusion causes illusion or even delusion but it wont stop the fusion It could be a sign from above that my love will return and the pain will no longer burn
To F-en talented
Rentastic
This song definitely proves the theory that women find psychopathic tendencies a turn on, lol. Especially if it is controlled. The animal within the gentleman.
I love love love the way he can play this so well on the back of a moving bus 😜Wowwee x This is unbelievably perfectly well done,such a lot to remember!! Haha it makes me laugh at the end when he swears x Such a talented young man who is going to go soo far in life! This is him just starting too x What an awesome dude  Keep The Faith Ren ..💕..x
I fking love how you say rings in this song.
The end where you just seemed so satisfied.  🤌❤ Thanks for leaving that in.  It’s my new ringtone.
This was so dope! I'm actually glad I never saw it before so I could react to it! You're a LEGEND!
I just wonder what the driver is thinking lok
Sonso tomas shelby
So much more menacing than the original genius
Namaste🙏 front India Brother Ren. All is well right😇. Brother the "tung tha-tung tha" is damn Indian music alike. Well done brother. I love it a lot. Lovely🙏
This is amazing
No words to solidify how much I love Ren and his talent
Absolutely love the stripped down acoustic versions. They fizz with an edgier, more organic energy. Lovely work.
Damn, where is the bloody Jungle rmx? 🤣
Genius!!!  Pure genius!!!
Either recorded or Acoustic, you are awesome. As a drummer though, can I just say that you would make an amazing front man? Us with a good bass player, it’s done. Sealed for all time ❤
I gotta toss this out there. The Pigs in Ren's art. They really remind me of Comrade Napoleon and or Snowball (Animal Farm by George Orwell). The visuals stories in the vids like Sick Boi, that therapist is the ATHORITY; telling you how it IS GOING TO BE. Then there is Animal Flow...It's the entire farm! Twisted book and damn on point, but Ren, bro, how it fits to a lot of your lyrics... Money Game 1,2,3...is perfect! Watching and listening to you is like building a jigsaw puzzle that has no boarders. The "picture" just grows and never ends.  I will post this on multiple vids. Any of you fellow Ren-egades that have read the book, chime in.
I definitely prefer watching you preform this song live. In fact I prefer most of your songs live.
Fucking love it
I cant help but imagine how fun it would be to see this happen randomly when you're riding the bus😂
Damn
At this point I think, Ren was sent to troll us all. God gracious (coming from an atheist...)!
😂😂😂 lmfao I love your songs 🎉🎉 lmao
I’ve listened to these a bunch and watched a several reactions to it, and literally (in response to your comments right near the end) *just* picked up on part of the lyrics while watching your reaction 😅
Dude your a legend, there's no mainstream artist with your talent. Your wordplay, your presentation, the guitar. Mind officially blown.
Thank you Chinchilla for being you and inspiring people like me to stand up for myself. You are not just incredibly talented but a literal life changer. Love from Sweden! ❤
Awesome version! I love this!
❤❤❤❤❤ love your music keep killing it!!🎉🎉😊
This song always reminds me of the old fashioned embroidery samplers girls were encouraged to produce to showcase their needle skills. Ren provides us with solid bars, flow switches, vocal tonality, beat boxing, crazy instrumentation showing us a little of what he's capable of.
Can't get enough of these live acoustic versions....so fucking sick!!
YOU MAKE ME NOT WANT TO DO ANYTNING. WHATS THE POINT
Fillin' holes young blood. Keep bangin'!
Imagine you are on your way back home at night and Ren is sitting on the backseat singing this song 😂
I'm not going to call you a king, you'll simply have to settle for a god ! <3
So many dad's played the intro to their babies lol doooda. Lol no words just strings and doooda. I love ren for actually putting "animal" in ppls minds here. Epic! 🎉
Ren should consider going on Britain's Got Talent. I reckon Ren would win it all. Ren should open with, "Hi Ren". But maybe save that performance for later... Thank you Ren and I'm a fan of your work. ✌️
Duuuudeee!!! You are a damn genius
I think the the you way you play is amazing 🤩 do you smoke weed ? I’m curious.
Real quality Ren👍 thank you for sharing your amazing talent.❤
Love this ❤
Im glad you kept it
Ren....I have to understand... It's driving me crazy..... Where did the lion come from in animal flow????
Oh man! I wouldn’t think that this would be as
Fucking incredible
I be around the house just going "OOH OUH DNK UH" lmao
That was disturbing! I absolutely loved it!
I feel this in my guts everytime
I absolutely LOVE watching you do acoustic !!! Your beyond brilliant and so incredibly happy that your getting the global recognition you have so rightfully earned thru all the blood sweat tears pain and mind constantly working against you. Thru your music I heal as do you.   I see an incredible difference from #Ren 5 years ago to Ren today !!! Your energy, aura, and fire within your soul is flaming and shining so brightly and that strength that comes from within you expressed thru your music helps me find my inner strength as well. I wish I could express what an impact that has on me in such a positive way. As many tears that I cry from my own pain and thru yours when I listen to ALL your music I’m literally healing and balling my eyes out at the same time. Not one person or #Artist ever had the ability to do that for me before. So believe me when I say that your not just some awesome Artist emerging from the shadows with creativity, realism, and raw unmatched talent. You are incredibly important to me as a soul, kindred spirit a unique individual that has helped rekindle the flame And strength within my own soul. So I really don’t know how to express my sincerest gratitude I have towards you. To you I’m just another face in the crowd of Ren fans but to me your so much more than I can even describe in words ❤
Amazing ! The sign of a great song / artist.  It works all ways, cos its genius at its core.
Dum-dah Dum-dah Dum-dah Dum-dah Dum-dah Dum Animal flow You're in the mind of a cannibal king Where chaos and anarchy roam And trouble is bubbling under the skin A certain insanity shows Whenever I pick up the mic and begin Whenever these words that I write With my pen come alive They ignite like I pulled out the pin Animal flow (urgh) Out in the jungle, I'm ready for war I'm beating your brains with a bat And I'm swinging it back And it's booky, I bite 'cause I'm bored Lord of the Cannibals, bro A murderous mind that you can't ignore I wait and react with combat on the counter attack I'm the king of the jungle, I roar Animal flow I'm the flow CEO I've got mountains of murderous rhymes Mountain volcanic I blow and cause mayhem and panic There's no where to run from my mind I'm an impassible foe Never slowing, just growing And flowing with intricate lines Yes, I will dig in my teeth When I bite like a beast Blood, I drink it like wine Animal flow (urgh) Out in the wilderness I will be king Sit on my throne, I'm the Lord of the Rings Out on my own, I'm a terrible thing Animal skins, over my shoulders like bling They will be clothing my sins I came to win, over and over again I take your life with a grin Mary had a little lamb Who's fleece was white as snow It made the blood look so much redder When I slit its throat Watch it drip, drop, drip, drop Until the ground was soaked Oh, Mary, Mary Quite contrary How the blood it flows Horrific, explicit I bleed parasitic Acid, I'm eating your flesh (yum-yum-yum-yum) Don't fidget, I'm livid Not mentally with it I get kind of sick when I'm stressed (yum-yum-yum-yum) I am the eye, I am the storm I am the fury, I am the scorn I am the belly, I am the beast Yes I am, yes I am, yes I am Yes, I'm an animal Yes, I'm an animal Yes, sometimes the things I do are irrational Yes, sometimes the things I do are quite radical Yes, I will be waging war on the capital Yes, I will burn the Houses of Parliament down 'Cause hypocrites - they burn quite easily, wow Burn and pillage it all to the ground Your illegitimate king lost his crown Animal flow Show no mercy under my rule I won't be kind, I will be cruel Drown all my foes in a paddling pool Yes, I'm tyrannical bro, so Never mistake a man for a fool I'll take your ignorance right back to school And teach you a lesson for testing my cool Dum-dah Dum-dah Dum (Animal)
It sucks,yer popularity will die next year
I love how acoustic versions are almost like a totally different song. Double trouble man. 👍
Doesn’t get old this 🔥
Loved that Mary Mary bit \m/
Ren, did you drop a little Easter egg 'Jaws' reference in the opening riff? You manage to pour everything you have into a performance. Love those cheeky harmonics you slipped in too. I think you suffer with OCD, Obsessive Creative Disorder! Absolutely love all your work man👊😎
mate you're something else you yknow. followed you for years, said youd take off as soon as i saw ya. appreciate you proving me right ;)
@Ren  Made a remix of this when I was bored, hope I can keep it up, its cool if not - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkKs5vsIj1Y
This was just fun.  Is the only way I know how to describe it.   Despite the graphic scenes I’m visualizing in my head (I’m old and this is vastly different storytelling than say my beloved Eagles or Jellyfish)so it’s new to me and  quite honestly he is the only current artist that I look forward to.  You rock, Ren!
The only part I missed was the… Yum Yum Yum
The end was just the cherry on top 😂 love it!!
Your so talented lyrics and melody incredible and then your playing in on acoustic wowow
Man you look like that Shelby guy even the music could match 😂 fire mate
This should literally have millions and millions of views....
USA for ren
Duuuuuuuude... Im so glad you exist.
Man I need to see you on tour. Manchester is waiting for you @RenMakesMusic
❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🤘🤘
Kanye Renst
You're gonna be huge
Dude…..I don’t have words except music needs you right now. Thanks
Best song
🤯
Can't help wondering what the bus driver thought of this performance! Love the more raw animal feel with this live version though.
2024 John Lennon, you doubt me?
It really sounds like you recorded this on the bus 🤣 dope this
Ren and some strings, Thanks for this version.
Never seen anything similar. I love it ❤
i swear i seen you jump into one my mirrors before
I bought all of your songs
Brilliant
You're my spirit animal 😂
Your busking is by far the best I’ve heard
Shittest music I've ever heard
Awesome.
Stunning!
dope, ima mix em ++
Did Eminem, Bob Marley, John Mayer, and Shakespear all have a baby a birth this young prodigy?
Every once in a very rare while, God gives us such unique people to appreciate that give us a new perspective on life, makes us feel how we didn't think we could and are just such a breathe of fresh air that we wish they'd stay around forever.
THOSE GRUNTS THO
I can't agree more with everyone else , Ren is amazing and touches parts of me that no other musician ever has
Id like to see him cover. "The devil went down to Georgia".
very nice love that version
YAGHHH ...URRRGH....RAGHHH!  This song would'nt be the same without them. ;)
The pinch harmonic at 1:19 is a badass dynamic layering of an already dynamically layered song.
This dude has endless creativity
Another incredible performance and song, Britain has got Talent it’s not on that shit TV show in here.
Honestly NEW AGE EMINEM. NEVER HAVE I HEARD A WHITE GUY BESIDES NECRO AND ICP RIP SUCH MADNESSES. MANY PROPS MY MAN.
I cant get this version out of my head! Love it. Sing it in my car all the time!
Animal skins I wear them like bling while they cover my sins🎉🎉❤
This is fu(kking amazing ren! More pls. 😊
I loved that honest ending as much as your performance.
Mother of god.

Hmmmm.... not convinced... he is mega-talented... there is a lack of metaphor and or the metaphors lack nuance, which screams "I would say anything for the fame!"  Defo narcissist... but lets be honest its the way to the top and he is very good!
❤
As a disembodied omniscent entity with no sense of time or space, it's amazing how this kid still manages to surprise me, and I can assure you there was/is/will be no person like him. Even though I lack any understanding of human emotions beside nationality, his music speaks to me on a different level. This kid WAS/IS/WILL BE.
Pure talent
Ren, if me posting this is a problem, feel free to remove this post/comment   I cut and pasted these lyrics from the studio version video (which I also recommend viewing)  Animal flow You're in the mind of a cannibal king Where chaos and anarchy roam, And trouble is bubbling under the skin A certain insanity shows, Whenever I pick up the mic and begin Whenever these words that I write With my pen come alive They ignite like I pulled out the pin  Animal flow, Out in the jungle I’m ready for war Im beating your brains with a bat And I’m swinging it back And its booky, I bite cause I’m bored Lord of the cannibals bro A murderous mind that you can’t ignore I wait and react with combat on the counter attack I'm the king of the jungle I roar  ANIMAL  ANIMAL  Animal flow I'm the flow CEO I've got mountains of murderous rhymes Mountain volcanic I blow and cause mayhem and panic There's no where to run from my mind I'm an impassible foe Never slowing, just growing And flowing with intricate lines Yes I will dig in my teeth When I bite like a beast Blood, I drink it like wine  Animal flow Out in the wilderness I will be king Sit on my throne I’m the lord of the rings Out on my own I’m a terrible thing Animal skins, over my shoulders like bling They will be clothing my sins I came to win, over and over again I take your life with a grin  ANIMAL  ANIMAL  Mary had a little lamb Who’s fleece was white as snow It made the blood look so much redder When I slit its throat Watch it drip, drop, drip, drop Until the ground was soaked Oh, Mary Mary Quite contrary How the blood it flows  Horrific, explicit I bleed parasitic Acid, I’m eating your flesh Don’t fidget, I’m livid Not mentally with it I get kind of sick when I’m stressed I am the eye, I am the storm I am the fury, I am the scorn I am the belly, I am the beast Yes I am, yes I am, yes I am  Yes I’m an animal Yes I’m an animal Yes sometimes the things I do are irrational Yes sometimes the things I do are quite radical Yes I will be waging war on the capital Yes I will burn the Houses of Parliament down Cause hypocrites - they burn quite easily, wow Burn and pillage it all to the ground Your illegitimate king lost his crown  Animal flow Show no mercy under my rule I won’t be kind, I will be cruel Drown all my foes in a paddling pool Yes I’m tyrannical bro, so Never mistake a man for a fool I'll take your ignorance right back to school And teach you a lesson for testing my cool  ANIMAL
I can see him. He is evil. Really
Yup.  More genius. Each video, I think, “How’s he gonna top the last one?”.   But he does.  And does again!  Such an intricate song to do live.  Not even one missed line, stuttered word, or bad note.  How’s he even memorizing all this!
Ren you should give Cillian Murphy a call I think he might be your father. KO but you are his fucking double.
❤❤❤
I’m still coming to terms with this one… 😳😲 That guitar work is almost indescribable. Skill I hear every word hitting me in the face - that’s skill

You should work with this guy.  Two prestigious talents. Marcin ~ Carmen Opera guitar  https://youtu.be/PzBKlcYaKNg
Blown away by this RENdition of a track i couldn't imagine an acoustic version of... how do you do it man? How? GeNiUs.
Well I tried 😂 sorry not good
I wish this version was out on spotify.
I'm hoping that because you posted this 3 weeks ago it means you're feeling okay! I know that likely isn't so, when your immune system is attacking your body it can take time. My prayers and heart hopes that today you feel great!
Germany loves you❤
I continue to believe that acoustic versions of most songs are better than studio versions. Another prime example. This needs to go up for sale.
I really like this more for film or panto in my opinion . Great job
Like your music (Art)! Your doing a great job. 👌🏻🙌🏻
Omfg, maaaannnn! You just keep raising that bar; soon it will be so high that you will get nose bleeds looking for it.
Fantastic!!!
Phenomenal talent. Keep making that fire Ren ❤
Ren is so badass!!🤘🤘🤘
Who’d have thought a Pantera Walk-esque style riff on acoustic guitar would work with British grime style rapping. Only Ren, obviously… and how it works!
This is pure talent
https://youtu.be/eLuFNM8cQ9k
"Keep it, just in case" LOL
what a riff, damn you'r so special <3
Best live performance I've ever seen so far
❤ eres el arte en humano 😎
Wow.  Absolutely enthralling.
Sounds like a yelawolf rip-off to me....
Love you!!! Keep it up, please!!!!!! I need this music in my life❤❤❤❤
What I like about Ren is that his music (art) is not just for the moment. But for eternity.
You. Are. Fucking. Epic
Much much much love ❤
I love how raw you are, just found your music a week or so ago and haven't listened to anything else since, can't wait to see where you go!! Hopefully ontario haha
Tommy Shelby play guitar now !! Very great 🎉
Amazing!!😃
Ren please, help https://www.youtube.com/@BeccaDoss
Man, I swear, you gave me something back I've wanted for so long, and that's the ability to cry. I love everything you've done to this point from bangers to the best storytelling I've ever heard.   My ebay store loves your wardrobe as much as I love you. You've got some amazing pieces man.
This man is doing things like this while undergoing medical treatment? Wow, this is amazing.
Fucking brilliant!
Thomas Shelby went crazy and decided to pass the fare by song.
Yelawolf type song 😅
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHvBxh6cXn8 ?
Yeah Man Animal Flow Let's Go🍄🤯🥳
I love the Live Verse more tbh. Started with Hi Ren ,Dude love the music keep being a Voice for the Voiceless
i would absolutely love to see you live... Shoutout from South Africa!!!
This really cool. Would love to work with you one day!
great job Thomas
I'm an old punk with a liking for folk rock but you my young friend have lifted and invigorated music by braking genre's amazing 👏 thank you.
Impeccable timing.
Please release this 😍
Heres one for you Darren - one to boggle yer noggle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huErRAK1ch0&list=RDtgGVWwqtizs&index=3 (Cardiacs, 'Visiting Hours') get busking THAT one
Needs a record deal
I feel like you may never see this but your music helps me physically. Twice now I’ve shifted my atlas while listening. My neck is closer to being correct. It may take a couple years to get a platform to properly thank you for your art but it’s all I want to do from this empty hotel room where all I have is love to fight the hate that now defines me. My sickness is an injury. Thank you for being a person.
Yooo this is lit
Sos un genio
a bit more evil flow.
This will never be read by you but I have to say it. A life of physical  pain in the army  of 12 year's is maybe  comparable slightly  to yours but I doubt it. I like you sunk myself  into music, made a soundcloud  and bought  expensive  decks with no clue. Now I'm getting decent  but I left it and gave up until I found you in January.  So although  you'll  never read it, ty for bringing  me bk from the cliff whe ln I gave up and ty for the intelligent  music

This guy's a wizard
The best track this year.  Nothing else ( other than your track,  "Ren") comes close.
Love this guy, would be amazing to work with him, hit me up if youre ever up glasgow way and we can do some videos
"keep it, just in case" 👌 thx
Pure gold!
Ich kenne derzeit keinen Künstler, der dir das Wasser reichen könnte!
This is sick, made me smile
I swear this live version gets better and better every time you listen to it.  Very talented!
L'humain est une machine à émotion et tu es un génie.
You buddy look like Tommy Shelby!❤
I like watching these videos. Ren is a great artist and I like most of his music. I want to make music like his, but I really can’t sing. Maybe I can at least learn to write music by listening to his lyrics and a few like his.
esse cara parece o Thomas Shelby
I’m bored of Ren now. All his songs have the same flow. Zzzzzz
This man jibber jabbers like a ding dong lookin for luck. What can ya do!?
This is MADDD 🔥 🔥 🔥  Super clever work with the guitar!
It's the way you say uh and argh for me 🥵🤩
I just love it!!!!
Love love love! Ren is a fucking genius artist! Lyrically, musically, production... Fucking everything man! I'm so grateful to have you in my time!!! Thank you! You're amazing!!!!
my version is way better (joke) ,,, you are so talented i have a hard time processing it you are truley amazing..... its nice that you are so gracious but as a musician you are an anomaly.... you keep hearing this but it is true..  kidding about my version infact deleting the link.... damn
this isnt fair.. next jimmy Hendrix indeed,,, love it
Love Animal Flow and the deconstructed version is fantastic.  You always surprise and never disappoint.  ❤❤  I found a song I wanted to put on your radar- Kasey Chambers retake of Eminem’s Lose Yourself. I don’t want to say too much - but OMG there is a banjo involved. ❤❤❤❤
Is this considered busking or does this just make Ren the "Bus-King"?  🤔   love this version... Thank you  Ren for all the great music so far!!!
What in the no breath 😮😂
Wow 😳❤👊🔥
I could do without a new obsession at my age mate :) Owning it. Your the King.
what made you stop at the end ?
Sick
I've never clicked on something so fast when I saw it.
The stop is Brighton Station....
Merci pour tes textes Ren!❤ on a tous nos tourments, notre part d'ombre, c'est comme ça,  il faut composer avec et avancer. Tu es vraiment au top, continues comme ça 💪😘
If the Preaky Blinders sold meth...
Love Rens natural musicianship is gold 💪🔥💥💪🔥💥💪
Yep, this version is better the the studio version, and I really dig the studio version!
It's great to see Thomas Shelby take up a passion for music!
Man, if you don't blow tf up the world's  wrong for not paying attention 🎶
Respect ✊ I’d love to collab on some tracks together!!
I haven't seen him rap live at full speed. You think he can't do it live?
Thinking about using this as my walk in for my next boxing bouts
Ren, you are always such a joy to experience whenever you perform, sometimes I forget you do it all, sing, rap, spoken word or whatever the performance needs. I am so incredibly happy that you are finally getting the attention/exposure that you not only deserve but that humanity needs so much. Thank you for sharing your gift with the world and making this eternal dance easier, as we learn to relax. All my love and respect.
Chatgpt asks Ren for bars!
I miss the Big Push Ren tbh
Damn. It's been only twelve days but I already listened to it 1516546254264565412544 times. he's really something 👀
Love this!
Ren on his Thomas Shelby era
🔥🔥🔥
Brilliant!
Hope your well enough to play Glastonbury. All the best.
dang, wish I was on that bus
I personally prefer this version
Ren you probably won't see or respond to this comment, but I felt obliged to let you know that you are an inspiration for me and a lot more people.  I feel your pain, and I respect your grind.  Good things happen to Good people.  I hope you succeed in everything you do.  Respect from Coventry UK 🇬🇧
<3
Are you god? Be honest.
Much love to you just subbed to you
So dope Ren. Definitely hear the Primus vibes starting at 2:14
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Wow this was so good!!
Is that fookin Thomas Shelby?
Ren 1 million is coming 100% When you hit it we want signed CD's
Ahhhhhh #@$&, #@$%, that was a really good one.
As a beatboxer this Ren inspires  me
Bus concerts..genius..🙃..tickets please..the conductor is ear..
Man, this was so good. I wondered how you would translate this to acoustic but holy shit. Amazing.  P.S. please make a shirt with Ren on the front large font and on the back put I won't retire I'll stand in your fire to inspire the meek to be strong.  💪 need that shirt. Lol
Original Animal Flow was great! but.. It just didnt 'stick' But this.. Yes! Amazing! Raw! Like an animal flow! How ever - I noticed the bus seats look like penises and now I cant unsee it :D
Love it! Ren! Have you ever done a James cover?  I resonate with Tim Booth's lyrics, singing and the band period! I adore everything you do! 🖤🖤🖤
Ren u have created an entirely new genre !!! There’s nothing like your music out there!  I Love watching your following swell more & more ! Thank you brother for the Deep ones , the fun ones & all the ones filled with the sickest bars & flow! You truly are elite & music like this changes the world 1 person at a time !  #Ren4Prez
Great job, Thomas Shelby!
going to use this guy's music as the alarm clock music one get's up - feeling so full of energy!
Your a beast bub!  Love all your music
Classic ending. Awesome rendition on the bus
Thomas Shelby is killing it man
The words behind Rens head read, “we’re hiring people like you”. Considering he’s the only individual you can actually see in the video and the only other person seems to be the camera person, I’m going to go ahead and bet that it’s safe to say that Ren got the job huh? Lol positions filled
For the past few months, I've been sharing Ren with everyone.  Even the guy who sold me my car....haha!!! I think he is a once in a generation talent.  ❤
⚡️
At this point, if someone told me that Ren was also Banksy, I'd think "Yeah, story checks out"
You’re one of the most inspirational thinkers I’ve ever had the pleasure to watch perform their work.
Mad beats. Not sure how i ended up here but i am glad. 👌
Took a min to get here, my fault. Bloody hell bro, what da fuck!  How did you make this more intense then the OG version? ???
I much prefer this version; not so much distraction from the lyrics.
Fuck Yeah! LIVE!\m/ \m/
Me encantas!!!!!
I thought Thomas Shelby start singing lol
Ren-that was a good one ?!! —it was friggin Amazing ❤
Thanks for exist
didnt know tommy shelby was also an artist
Would love to see more acoustic versions of your songs
This gives me goosebumps.
2:12 amazing acoustic build up
Insane!
просто ахуенно))
Ren, I really wish I could listen to you live, animal to animal!  I think on you, hoping could contribute somehow to help you, if not in the material things, at least in spirit. I follow you from Torino, Italy. THANKS A LOT REN!!!
That is absolutely fire!!! Omg
F*#k Yes Ren. You're Actually brilliant. ❤ I am loving watching youre growth and as you find clarity... your musical intuition and strength just seems to flow harder.... i sincerely feel you are one of this generation's masters and its an honor to witness it come to fruition 😊
I had the thought that you were a modern day Shakespeare.. now I am worried you are Ciri and have so much magic cruxing that it is killing you. Regardless you are wielding some magic.
Great vocal delivery and flow !
Hi Ren, I doubt you'll be reading this, but whatever.  Put all the pain, the struggle aside - your biggest challenge lays ahead of you. I watched a ton of your stuff, of reactions, of everything lately, and like many people, I'm blown away. Now you'll have to face the challenge that there are literally millions out there relying on you. On your music. On you staying the way you are. Because you gave us hope. Hope in humanity and music. And hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.  But also - hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things.  Thank you for your music, thank you for the messages you keep sending. Keep true to yourself.
Tommy Shelby is back!
This is awesome, the lyrics are a bit gory, but the rhythms are superb, and done on an accoustic, excellence
What a fucking legend, man, you're a genius.
I love it. Filming where you can for the low or free, building your brand. I have artists I absolutely adore acoustic, but loathe their studio songs.
Its official. I'm obsessed. ❤
When I voted for the acoustic I didnt know I was signing up for instant goosebumps! Holy Helicopter this version  hits all the axis!
🫀
You just kill it, sir!
Delving into the darknees, maybe we'd all benefit from such occasional visits there.
Hi ren. Found u a few months ago. I love what you do. The music is amazing but also the videos are killer too.
Haha, you couldn't write the ending! Well... Ren could...🤔
Sweet
Mind blown 💥 Absolutely captivating
The flow here is both fun and absolutely ridiculous.  Very quickly realizing I'm late to the game here!
Oh my God, I love this version  well done Ren❤
Sheet ! 👌👌👌
Thomas Shelby flow
Damn man, this was one I didn't think you could do on the ole acoustic. #NeverdoubtRen ❤️💯
Interjected the yum yum yum when I was singing along. Love this stripped back version. Awesome man. It’s crazy how just you and your guitar is so captivating. Such a great humble guy too. Keep it coming Ren the 🐇🕳️ is my favourite place to be.
Loving the B Minors. Seen your reel and came back to say this.😂😂😂🙌🙌🙌
Just keep it, just in case! :)
Amen brother
All i can say is wow...fucking wow...
Keep it, just in case.
I'm totally captivated by everything ren releases now, I discovered him a few months back when going through a rough patch, he's captured my spirit with his genius
GEM
Absolutely gorgeous!!! Much more intense and raw than the “recorded version”!!!! Please Ren keep making music. You’re a blessing 🙏🏽
Please record this version :) you rock !
Nothing about the song, ofc I love it but I'm just glad to see you are doing better then before.
❤..... Fooooking sICK Boi👀😉🥂🍾♥️🇿🇦
Awesome new career for Tommy Shelby.
He's come along way since peeky blinders..
WOW! This was awesome 👌, you're  very creatively talented, loved it ❤
Awesome…has rings of Till It’s gone by Yelawolf
Thank goodness for these exceptional artist that come along every few generations (Damian Hurst, Mozart etc).
Maybe it's too late now for dignity if the industry has given you into cannibalism... flow of course but I was sold years ago when you were singing Nina Simon.  This guy with the fresh threads and claiming the devil is a bit disconcerting. You get praises all day long, I hate to critique, but I know you can take it and maybe prefer it to the fans who post from their toilette, and say that. For the love of dignity Ren, please don't drink the juice. And if you must, and you insist on casting your genius over us, please never forget those of us who loved you before all of this blew up. I'm not a purist and I have been sold on lies myself. You know that I know the industries contracts are for more than music. Be careful. Your soul is genius. Nobody else is gonna talk about it? It's getting a little sicker isn't it? I'm not talking about the flow. May we all learn to discern what is real and what is contrived, may we all be out of reach of energetic tethers, and leaks. May we know ourselves, love ourselves and each other, and may all  beings be free. You spit it so clearly, I dont want to believe they got you. It's looking sketchy af from over here, I gotta tell you. Drinking blood and such. Maybe I am crazy? Are you okay?
THIS is amazing! Wow! Love it!
What other rap artist can say that they offer a nylon string acoustic (finger picked, no less) version of their newest single?
Ren, once again, showing us all how it's done.
Don't know if you are still reading these comments but can you release all the acoustic or live versions of the songs on Spotify maybe as a live album?
No better than this
Ren's music/poetry/story telling brings joy, tears and inspiration into my World.  Fu**ing GENIUS!!  Love it!!
I love how Rens live acoustic versions always give us another face to the same coin
👍
What happened to trick the fox your vocals on that channel mad 👍👍
Love this great job love you done your own version good luck to you and your future
This is precious on so many levels ❤ ...  the talent ...  im speechless ... 2023 year  one and only bard in this world.
Did you write the guitar or synth version first?
Your music needs to be heard preformed live. Just adds something i cant explain..so epic. Glad i stumbled onto your music
What If...pharmaceutical health care  system ... Isn't  and has never been there 4 our health,  Just 4 Profit, accepting illness ,  I can heal you, i am not alone

Your incredible 💖
This just blew me away!  Awesome!😍👊🎸
This guy is the Shakespeare King of Rap in today's world.
As said in “Hi Ren” he is a genius
A Captain Beefheart kind of feel with some of the guitar riffs?
Would be amazing if you could get a ft on a BMTH track
I loved the recorded video, and I love this one just as much! It works really well on a guitar. Great work as always! ❤️
The older he gets the more he looks like Cillian Murphy's younger brother... or maybe Ren Shelby :)
Holy fuck ! This is brilliant! I am SO happy I watched this. I love the video version as well, but, this is over the top multiple ear orgasms.
Faaarrrrrrrl, every single time I listen to this version it gets bette. You’re soo friggin cool bananas Ren🫶 the way you do vocal gymnastics and the guitar playing, shit fk shizaammm
He never disappoints
Definition of out of this world
So i go by Ren and for fun typed my name on you tube and discovered you. You are a genius.  I can play piano well but you do so much more. ❤
BRUH ❤❤❤
Love the recorded version...as does everyone else it seems....but this is way way better....sorry if you don't agree.....I get it.... original is great...but I just love to hear stripped back live...in the.moment.wizardry....and this guy got it...
" just in case "
Ten, can you use your exposure & fans to help us with Autoimmune Disorders & Chronic ‘Invisible Illnesses’ tell the world that we need help?? We need doctors who BELIEVE & help us get to a state to better function, at least get a caregiver to help us navigate our lives? AHH I’ve been ‘sick’ since 2006 & am spiraling, my Son’s are now as well & I want to help them (I can’t help myself). 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🙏🙏🙏
Ah FFS!!! Its like a completely different song and now I don't know which one I prefer. 🤔😅 (these are good decisions to have) Keep'er lit man!.
THIS IS AMAIZNG OMGGG
OMG Amazing I love it x
How much dis it take to learn it?
How did you learn this?
Im 48 and its been YEARS since i have felt so much passion for an artist.  I too have lyme disease, however, living in the US my doctors tested everything until we reached the proper diagnosis. I was also told at one point that i was causing my illness. With that I switched docs, and soon realized it WASNT me.  Thanks for ALL U DO!
Bro could sneak into peaky blinders and play an entire episode as Thomas Shelby and we wouldn't even notice.  Nevertheless,brilliant performance Ren
Another version LIVING in my mind! Love this!
Brilliant!
Imagine what will happen if @Ren and @Tom MacDonald collaborate !!!! MAKE IT HAPPEN!!! Greetings from Greece! Cheers
Very original. Good
Alles ist im fluss oder es fließt...das meint nicht zwingend Wasser, auch Verkehr. Aber natürlich habe ich die Tiere am Fluss, gefunden. Unter anderem eine Krabbe. Und eine ganz große goldene steht in Port Klang. Es gibt überall soviel zu allem...leider. Macht aber nichts, wir finden alles!!!
Excellentente
Hi Ren, I'm going to want these lyrics provided phonetically please 😄
You are getting so famous that people are impersonating you! ❤
I love you so much and your song
Love this! This acoustical version really showcases your talent, plus the intricate and complex vocals and guitar. No distractions. Love it!!

Are you tom shelby?
You know, since I discovered Ren, I've been guardedly optimistic about every new release. Like, I think, "man this guy has got so many outstanding tracks, inevitably it might fall off."  I'm not worried about that anymore.  Ren, thank you for bringing IT! EVERY. TIME.  Please, stay healthy, stay humble, and I look forward to following what you do throughout your career.  ANIMAL!

Ren when are you touring Australia
Jealous of bus driver... yet here we see a road might be curvy to something greater.
wow
Bro you're so talented! Had to flip through your older songs and I have to say you have so many songs that should be major hits. True art brother!
https://youtu.be/alRgcNNBCoU 🎉
3:34 Oh, Ren ! Rawwwrrr !  Now there are two versions to love ! Each  delights my heart in its own way . Thank you!!!
i cant believe how talented you are my man!
I'm currently a big fan of the  Ren Genre.  I don't know where else to place your music that would give it justice.... So I think it deserves it's own genre title.
I like this version more tbh
And he gone and did it again , brilliant 💯🤯
An acoustic cover of this song is an example of why ten impressed me. He knows what he is doing with his music so well.
I love you for sharing your journey….
Shit got to go to bed . But that day at band room wen my pal played HI Ren . Changed my life for the better and I realise we are all insane 😢😮😅😊😊😊😂😂😂
your guitar rythm is so sick bro i cant wait to learn it your killing it ren stay up G    jameson strangehorse
Outstanding! Ren you are absolutely one of my favorite artists I am so glad I came across your music.

These guys make great good predictions 🤓 https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdfm6kJoKYuKmFAXtdlLMtA6ozQtyfQiN
Every day I’m in pain because of all this anxiety and stress I cope with it like I cope with this world I’m slow with it just like I’m slow folding up clothes in the morning I sit in my couch Looking up at the ceiling Trying to think to myself is that me or does that ceiling describe my life it’s bland it’s basic but you’ve Gotta have it to keep the house stable but how stable could stable be it’s if my mind wasn’t free every time someone talk to me it’s like waiting in line for the next Apple product is constant rate it’s like a snail on a conveyor belt slow but fast
This live version is growing up on me day by day 😍😍
Holy shit - you really are a genius...  Thank you so much for helping me with my own health journey, living with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) I went outside without my wheechair on Saturday - the first time since 2016.  This journey is fucking brutal, and I think you help more people than you realise.  Thanks again.
fuck that is sooo sic my bro... class!!!!!!!    !!!!        ~!!        !!          !
Collab with Ren and billy strings would be fire
Holy shit. How does he do that?! Insane.  Genius  🔥❤
Just love these raw versions. Keep em coming dear ren. Cheers from a cuban fan ❤
Oh to have been a bus driver on this day, on this route, with this fare...brilliant!
Duuhuuuude this is fckng EPIC
Holy freaking shit
Ren and the Guitar. That’s all we need. 🖤
I like this version best!
Yes , brilliant songwriting and performance Ren , Keep them coming , Music of the moment ! .
Nice ❤️
Do you read your Instagram PM?  Would love to hear your opinion.   ✏️☺️🙏
Never stops inspiring.
I love so much how you're such inspired when you're singing and how you're living your words !
Ren, You're a very talented and very creative guy of Our Time :) Respect to you
Ren! You are the only person who's made me care about music since I was in my early 20s over a decade ago.   I wish you ALL that desire, but only enough to keep your hunger...
"oh shit; fuck that was a really good one" yeah Ren it was
Ren is next level Ozzy!❤
This is insan3😮😮😮😮
If Yelawolf had a child.
Love this version Ren :)  and so does my 6 year old daughter until the very end where you said fuck 😂 - i had to turn off quickly , all good she didnt pick up on it, love hearing your music mate - keep releasing please - JP from Aus
Greetings from Estonia 🇪🇪  ♥️ Ren I love your ✍️ work.
Dude …..WHAT?! How? You just keep getting better and I just started listening to you like 2 weeks ago! I’m blown away for real. I like that you can do reggae too! I’m in California so that hits hard! Love it all. Been showing my friends your stuff as well. Hi from cali! When you get better maybe you can play some music over this way. 💜
Animal? You .. are a Beast..
💗💗
Ugh protect this man at all costs
Damn!!!!!
This version really lets you appreciate the lyricism and the bluesy guitar in the background is just awesome, mixes well. Id listen to this over the original. Both are still great.
Need you to make a beat for this one:  The walls continue to cave in on me Collapsing as screams grow louder It doesn’t drowned within the sound Yet float to the shores of pride A prison if it’s own Or prism of the identical side of life Which ever it is When it does They may have Should be the Or maybe Or just maybe It’s a three dimensional prison Brought to you by your own free will Causing the multiverse to expand Showing you the dimensions of democracy Let me capitalize on the capture of your soul It contains content of creativity Yet poorly executed As this dystopia is as dysfunctional as your solid state Smeared black soot sabotages this 20 sq feet of organs It sits in silence It postures for perfection It’s a plethora of ideology Simple stacked stones waiting to fall Failing at this very attempt of important procedures Like a surgeon surprised he couldn’t save a life Yet only take one away. Maybe all I have taken is myth of a memory What’s louder than those screams Why do I collapse as those perishing cries These walls are made of mud and moss So fragile like a leaf in a storm What gives away What falls down What shrinks as a deflated population These walls as we know them They still They still Continue to collapse
Here is what I love most about the acoustic performance.  The video is so visually forward and there is so much going on with the lyrics and additional world building sounds, the actual music gets lost in a good way. Then you drop this version and you can really appreciate it. It’s like the Bass section in a symphony. Never the star, but sets the tone for the rest of the performance.  Example: the nursery rhyme bars. In the video Ren is descending down the stairs. While the guitar scales is ascending in octaves. (Creates this ironic little wrinkle that reinforces the animal farm theme perfectly with a world that is metaphorically flipped, where up is down, all the animals become like people) Then he hits the landing, guitar starts to even out and land. The yes I am part hits at the peak of the intensity, this then resets as the guitar continues to even out with as the pathway down the hall evens out.   Like I said, the underlying music at least for me, was buried in a good way for the video and this version really gave me a chance to appreciate what Ren did here with it.
I knew there was Animal Farm references in your music! Haven't gone through the whole gamut of the songs yet, but I immediately felt this was probably a theme, particularly in Hi Ren and Sick Boi.  Love this :) The live performances are probably my favorite. Just the intensity of it hits differently.
0:22 how he sings there, it could be Kate Bush as male.
This is thick
So this was dine in the UK, before you went to Calvary ... ?
bro this version right here is the best!
Yeah! Really more into this acoustic version! Ur a genious
Man! I’m just absolutely blown away by all your stuff! I love this live version!!! I’ve been wondering if you were able to play these guitar parts while rapping like that and you did not disappoint!! I’m a huge fan from Alabama USA!!
Love
An absolute joke of a performance 🔥
I came across Hi Ren a few weeks ago and now I just look for allllll the Ren music I can find INSANE talent 😍 as someone who struggles with mental illness a lot of this music just snuggles my heart, can't wait to find more!!
❤ I love this version
Dude! You're something else. I'd love to see you write a musical of sorts like what you did with jenny's story etc. I hate to say it, but a little something like r-kelly's in the closet , but serious and without SA cases as a side hussle
RRRRRRaAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! tik a thh tah
I like this even better than the original video
Quality this. 👏👏👏 Ren get onto this belter https://youtu.be/qkHC_IZ-aGM
I found Ren today, and I'm so glad I did. I'm a partially wheelchair-bound person myself who has been struggling with living life with chronic illness for 2 years now. I'm so glad that there is someone who I can relate to making such amazing music. Ren, you give me hope. Thank you so much.
Wow I love this. It’s like a completely different *animal* from the electric version and every bit or even more *captivating*
I wish there was more of this type of rapping and music when I used to ride on the bus when I was young. When sitting at the back of the bus you gotta move and flow with the bus. Camera work is great too.
To me this is like Harry Potter. The books are amazing. The movies are fantastic. And while they are the “same” they are different enough that you kind of need to treat them as separate entities and both have a ton to offer of their own accord. I’ll be listening to this or the studio version based on my mood. Keep going, Ren. We are ALL here for whatever it is you feel like sharing.
Didn't know Tommy Shelby played guitar
This guy... Keep stealing my flow bro
Outstanding ❤ BTW I'm 56 yo
Didn't realise that Tom Shelby plays guitar.
Ummmmm how do you do this magic you do!!!!! I didn’t think I could love you or this song any more than I already did but here we are…. Again!!!! You are so dang talented!!!!!
Watching you keep on pushing despite your health and mental problems has inspired me to climb to my feet and helped me rediscover my love of music. Thank you.
Love this song idk how many times I replay it lol doesn't matter which version 😅
Please!!!!! Post tabs !!!!!! So amazing !!!
The panter jacket is a nice detail ☺️
a true genius of this modern age
Ren, I like this even more than the production, damn im captured. Inspiring as always
Love it Ren.
Animal flow is free will ?
I prefer this version literally feels like your sat right in front of me and I'm on the bus with you lol
ROAD TO 1M.....HERE WE GO REN!!!
❤discoveries are amazing thank you Justin Hawkins rides again...... REN 😊subscribed
love the use of nylon strings all the time! <3
Thank you.
That was good buddy!
Never did 'Bm' look so good.
I guess you accepted [their] offer for FAME.. (mistake mate, get away from the Mason’s)
Love you Ren!! You're a damn genius man and you deserve to be recognized for your brilliance and your incredible voice. Your emotion and pain can be felt in everything you do, which is SO rare! Thank you for sharing your gift with us, we needed it! You've got a forever fan in me bruv ❤❤❤
It’s predictable, but not predictable. You can sing along, but make a mistake in a heartbeat.
Ren is a genius😊
So good!!! Seriously fucking amazing!
The only thing the disappointed me with this is I didn’t hear the “yum yum yum yum”!!! Awesomeness is here and it will stay forever!!!❤
You always deliver
i decided to watch this for a 3rd time and im alittle drunk and i have decided now that this is at least 2-3x better than the studio version. simple riffs that just fucking slap
❤🎉
Thank you so much!
Better than most rappers
Chicken on the corn flow lol
The best part about this is how much fun he's clearly having. Especially with the sounds ❤
He's a whinier twat than Ani DiFranco.
Man I can listen to you do your thing all dam day! Much respect and love from the States.
Ren you are amazing, not long come across you, loving your music, and to top it off your from wales too. Keep up the amazing work… from another 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Shit I thought this was Cillian Murphy
visceral!!!!
You are truly mesmerising !!
I love your art and performance. I've recently read your post you wished in retrospect you recorded an acoustic version... I guess you worked really hard to make up for that miss. Thank you for fulfilling this request. This came out grand!
F@ck it. !  im having a Ren tattoo for sure i just love this style raw or polished its all good 👍 ❤
Very authentic! Like here. 👍
Way better than the original video
Do love this song
My man found his way out of his plethora of basements and onto a bus 🔥
By order of the Peaky Blinders
You are so much better live.
Soooooooo fucking mindblowingly good man! Unbelievably talented! Lots of love from Berlin!
you are just so good I could give up playing the guitar and listen to you it would save me a lot of effort
Brilliant.
Okay... I'll say it...I like this version more... damn it.
I don't know if this wA done on purpose but if ren got to the end of the song it would have ended right in time for the bus speaker to say this bus terminates here
I by far prefer this version of the other, weird I know, but this has that rawness and the bardcore vibe again.Also why I voted that I would prefer less produced concerts.  That said my social anxiety would prevent me to go to one anyway..
Anyone else think he looks very similar to peaky blinders 🧐
Always smashing it Ren
💙
Hey Ren… just a thought but I think it would be super cool, entertaining and insightful to have you and Wolf Johnson have a discussion about your next song right after it drops. I think we all love (those of us that follow you guys) the way both of you think and express yourselves. Well that’s my 2 cents from the peanut gallery. Best of health and happiness to you my friend!!! Peace ☮️
Actual translation in the book of Revelation is  ''man is THE beast''  and NOT A man (singular) is the number of the beast,meaning all men!  Ren Lives!!!
you made me sick(boi) of your music! dream on!
fucking raw skills. I just keep getting more impressed. I <3 Ren
This is superb! absolutely love this. Just pure genius!
Always surprising! Who hit the like in the first seconds?
Imagining the bus driver face 😂
Magical as always ❤❤
You are a amazing person Ren!!! The one takes are so impressive, dude ...
You the man
I was curious how it would play live with just you and a guitar. Well done! You continually impress me.
Them Adidas joggers are super British, eh. Loved this version just as much as the other.
Ren, you never disappoint! Your music gives light/life to my soul. It changes my mood..your like a cup of coffee times 100% for my enthusiasm to take on the day!
you continue to blow my mind bro! what a talent and what an inspiration!
I’m obsessed with this 🤩
I just kept shaking my head and smiling (because I’m still in disbelief but just so happy and excited at how amazing everything I hear and see from Ren is)  The boy who could Fly, and he does!!!
Superb again.. Thank you Ren. Utterly brilliant talent. Hope your recovery is going well
I didn't think Animal Flow could get any better but once again you pulled a rabbit out of your hat & surprised us all! Although surprised is no one. 😂 Much love Ren ❤️
It's like a superpower, this man can literally turn any song to an acustic version and never dissapoints, my jaw dropped
The amount of creative expression that flows throughout Ren's body has got to keep him up at night. Such an amazing spirit with honest and raw talent. May you always do what you love because you raise the consciousness of all who have the privilege of knowing you and listening to your music. Namaste🙏💜
Name ONE other Artist, that could do this… I don’t think they exist…❤️
Just when I thought you couldn't out do yourself!
Bro…this is so sick! Awesome creative mind.
Dark Ren's signature is all over this. Best of the best.
Radonkulas. 🧡
I love this version even more then original❤
🫳 🎤  💣= 🎩 🪄
IMO, this version showcases the lyrics beautifully. I love the OG, it is a visual masterpiece with production to match, but this is art on it's own. The power combo that is @Renmakesmusic and @SamuelPerryFalvey makes a guerrilla one shot like this not only possible, but EPIC.  Ren, in all sincerity and without hyperbole, you make the world a better place and I am here for it. <3
1..The breathy rah, 2.. murderous rhyme  3... Lord of the  rrrrrrrrings ... three of the best deliverance of words
"the blood, I drink it like wine".....too much like Adrenocrhome for my liking, look it up it's centuries old and horrific. 26 K likes, I am the only thumbs down and that is usually the case, I have a very discerning ear and as much as I may adore an artist I cannot deviate from my true assessment.
Absolute genius! Is that number 27 bus haha! Miss them Brighton buses!  Keep going Ren you are amazing 🫶🏼🫶🏼
Bm
This rocks! Both versions rock so hard, but in different ways! Like, can't substitute them for each other, both need to be on the playlist!
Fuck me!!!!!!! This lad is, amazing
bro mad respect you're outstanding
sick
Absolutely amazing!! You are a true artist!  Would love to see a colab with you and Tom McDonald
what happened at the end??
Hell nah wtf is that
Hi Ren was AMAZING. This is kinda just weird & gross
No other “artist” today is even in the same ball park.
So many thoughts and questions in my mind I can't describe it... luckily Ren can..and how! Wow dude, really amazing and the passion in the way you put all of yourself and thoughts out there!  Say something a 1000 times and no one will here it. Let people thínk about the question themselves! You did it! And I think people really love that about you! 🎸✏️☺️🌷🩷
Nice,👌💪🏻🙏🇺🇸
I love this Ren, but I love all of your acoustic numbers, the duos, busking.. your animal flow video absolutely rocks ❤❤❤
You cannot deny raw talent. Brilliant! Very embodied performance...real!
wow
oh yes!!!
Knock it off. 😂 Great drop homie! ✌️❤️ 🙈
Hwy fellow renegades...what a treat!
The guitar rhythm is solid as a rock - not easy to be so strong even if you're just playing simple chords and not singing and rapping at the same time. Awesome skills, incredible impact, beautiful music. Thank you!
Amazing!
This raw version really resonates with me. Made me cry. So much more animal. You are an amazing young man.
Wow! He’s playing the blues…and rapping…and it still has the same type of menacing Animal Flow feel. How does he make it work so well? So talented!
HI - I love this - just briliant lyrics x
I am ren on skins but play guitar too. Midi master genre breaker homie. But Ren is better hands down but we have same way of feeling things. i dont know why there arent more of us...
Farkkk I can only click the like button once
Music genre: REN.  Produces a song that seems to be completely based musically on unique, amazing samples and beats. Makes unplugged live version more excititng than original! 😮  what is happening?! 🙃
Crack on motherf**ker. Very cool.
Ren showing exactly why he is the best and how he is  on top of his game ❤✌️
jfc that was insane
FAS!
Love playing along with this song....
As a Guitar player for 30 years I am Very Impressed with your playing & picking over all your videos.
In my youth the last seats in the Bus were always for the Coolest. Ren proofed that rule....😎 🚌
❤
Che dire.... lascia sempre senza parole. Forza della natura 🎉
Damn! You are so talented! 😮
❤❤❤❤❤❤
🤍💛🧡❤💚💙💜🤎🖤✌
He's like if Eminem and Bradley Nowell had a baby. What a punk rock story teller
Fucking brilliant. This is the kind of talent that should be rewarded.
Ren: Did you ever have long hair?
Been listening to run d mc to beastie boys to too short to nwa to geto boys to public enemy to krs one to tupac to emenim that's when I stopped listening until now you're bringing that shit back dude
Nice!
The guitar in this version is fantastic, delightfully unhinged and unnerving.
Dude. You remind me of Matt Damon in the recent movie "air" talking about Michael Jordan. You're a killer. And you're going to change the world. I've been blown away since hi ren, and this was such a great take! Thank you for sharing.
this is way more entertaining than the original version and video, tbh lol I like it. Didn't care for the original, I really like this.
Very primal. I love the grunts/growls. And rolling the R in rings.
I'm sorry this goes Harder on the Acoustic 🤘🏻🔥Love this version much better!🔥🤘🏻
Anybody know what jacket he is wearing it’s so dope
Wasn't sure at the beginning.... then was like 'Hmmm. It's not that bad actually'.... then was like 'Wow, I love this.'  I don't know WHY, though. Like how do you keep this up?!
By order of the Peaky Blinders
I Fkn love you ❤️
Chords are B minor
❤
Bro, HOW are you not over a million subs already? Won't be long man. You've been gifted with very real talent. Sky's not the limit for you... it's just the beginning
Has Ren talked about the meaning behind this song at all? Seems mad dark. Just curious
Fuck yeah ✌️
“Let’s keep it it just in case”… it’s a fucking goldmine !
That was so goddamn tight goddamn
Unbelievable! That was so great! Please keep it up!
Very dramatic presentation, as always, and massive respect for knowing where you are even in the extended periods of non-word lyrics.
Brilliant!! Love the rough cut!! 🎉❤
Hahaha Awesome-Bomb mate.
Brillant!
Really like just the acoustic songs (versions)
Ren, thank you for sharing your passion with us 😊
Man this shit is fire.
I am so happy for you and your recognition you deserve it all 🥳
Bring back short time signatures and swing tempos ay
And here we have Ren at his finest. Rapping whilst playing classical guitar, on the back of a bus. Only he can do that and make it sound so incredible. And who else can do a cover of their own song and make it so unique, you struggle to believe it's been done by the same person!
This Is somehow the punkiest thing since punk 😮😊
Wow this is great
Brilliant!!!!!❤❤❤❤
After Ren, all other music sounds dull. Ren is special and I love it
I might like this version the best
Once again an incredible mind bender Ren.
This is so insanely good Ren. So fresh. So talented.
🤘🤘🤘
Genius!
This sound.... is magic...
Bruh I thought was Cillian Murphy from Peaky Blinders until I heard him play. 😅 the video in the hospital gown and wheelchair was my 1st time seeing @Ren and loved it!!
My first listen to Ren. I’m very intrigued.
Ren on the road to 1milli, let’s goooooo
Mannnn how can this version be soooo fire 🔥
This might be my favourite thing you've done
Love it 👆
Dude.. I love your "acoustic" stuff.   Your delivery is what really sets you apart..I would pay 100 bucks to watch you alone perform this rather than a blown up production.
Holy shit. Ren man. I got no words
Keep it just in case!
Been burning this up, sick. Don't stop being you.
Twistedly delicious.
Love Ren but not my favourite..
OMG! You!  Me! <3
This should have its own animated version.
Best live performance on a city bus in history... you and your team need to get you into the BBC or similar and record your art for future generations to enjoy. Seeing you perform is honestly the reason YouTube was invented and I hope all artists musical and otherwise take note. All the tools are available -- take encouragement from Ren (with some help from his talented friends) and connect with millions we are out here listening and enjoying...
Hey, love your content, I would actually love to learn your songs on guitar as well, is there anywhere where I can find the tabs?
What kind of guitar is this?
So does this mean Ren’s back in Brighton?  And how did u get the music sound perfect but no bus noise!?
I'm not surprised any more  , that version is killer
When Mr Bowie left us all behind,a thread  called REN appeared to fill the void .
QUALITY! keep it up fella. From Liverpool 👍 👍 👍
Better than the original.  1:19, magical...  Lesssgooo!
Aiaiaiai acoustic is as amazing as 1st version :o
Nobody is as raw as Ren he is definitely keeping it real on the back of a bus wow we all know that place from school lol keep well man and keep us as happy as you are bro
Love it 👍
Jeeeezzzz!!!! Ur a monster! Luv watcha doin! Keep em coming!
Love it. There's something of Metallica from the Loud/Reload albums in that riff.
I would like a metal version of this song
Absolutely awesome Ren....just when I think your performances can get any better, you just pull another rabbit outta the hat!  Total Respect :)
You are going places!!! If you want to though.
Very Cool version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes, that was a really good one!!
😁❤❤❤😻🙊🦓🦊🐒🐱❤
You are an amazing artist!
Ren your amazing I convinced you're from another planet or the future at least keep up this amazing wild ride of goodness
Badass.🤘
Sat on a bus with an acoustic guitar and a leopard print traki top, and yet I'm totally captivated,  next levels mate!!
When I saw this yesterday I didn't realise it had just been published, as I'd been binging on loads of your stuff after discovering you earlier that day. I much prefer this version to the previous version that I saw today. 👍
I feel like I missed the grand finale 😂❤
slick as f, damn bro the edits... you got me.. mate, you are it but how you make it in our modern shit show is possibly beyond me, ... regardless you deserve it fr..
BMinor squad in the house
scat, is this where it's at? scat bebop lynx badger wild cat. 1:18 killer harmonic
omg didnt thought this cant get better but aaaaawesomme <3  im so glad to know such an artist
Never change Ren
Brutal. Sick. Entirely legit!
Woo-hoo I flowed.🇬🇧👍
Why does that "growl" excite me in umm that special way? Ohhhh NM I get it...💜
Love it
Well, this is frickin' addicting! 😂
thomas shelby now makes music?
His talent astounds me. Genius.
man so good Ren!!
Is it wrong I prefer this to the amazing video rap version. Brilliant acoustic translation.
Am fixated again 🎉
Your songs always have the best build up.
Tommy shelby
Ren you absolute genius
loving this , are you a metal head at heart ren ? im getting a metallica , harvester of sorrow  feeling from that wee riff at the start . love it man . how you can record this quality on a bus is insane !!!
Great , apart from the lyric writing is genius , the guitar skills are dope !!!! Awesome  track as always ., Keep up your awesome work Ren the world needs you .
Anybody else make a short playlist to keep replaying this with a handful of other songs that are either under-appreciated or you just want to run up the views on?  What's on yours? Mine is Animal Flow (live acoustic), The Hunger, Ocean, Dominoes and Genesis (live acoustic).
trite lyrics
What a breath of fresh air .
Can you write a song about transitioning from female to male. Like a raw one with the details of what we experience and go through and expect
That start gave me the same chills as Rammstein's "Los". Subtle badassery condensed.
Hopping on a bus, and then you see folks just having the time of their life playing guitar and rapping at it... that is peak UK
I’m tapping to it
Still pretty fun.
I prefer this version this is great 😎
Your live skills are top-notch mate. Your street performance of War Pigs was -sick- and you could feel the energy. Keep it up!
🤘🔥🤘
Holy shit, Ren! I loved the full version, but this is STUNNING!
Sadly, I don’t like Animal Flow however it’s dressed up.
I love this more every time I listen to it!
Love this❤

@Ren, have you met Leo from Frog Leap?  I bet you two could make magic together! Just curious.
A good part of my day consists of daydreaming that I'm half as good as Ren when it comes to music. Such an incredible version of this song. You're just the man there's nothing else to say
Just amazing bro. Stay independent and keep soaring to new levels bro.
Peaky Foooking Blinders!!!
https://youtube.com/shorts/k56V09GV5xM?feature=share  Give this a Feature Part super dope Maybe a remix
A good song should always also work reduced and free from the production, just a man and his guitar. This is again one that proves it. Thank You for the music!
Someone play this to Ed Sheeran and then ask him to explain himself,    Why? Ed Why???? when you could do this?
Having a surprisingly happy guitar track to those rhymes made it bloody awesome. You are a beast and genius Ren!
This is it bro. NGL, I like this version much better. It feels much more fluid
23k likes dang go hard my man Ren you deserve it all!!!
I should take the bus more often!
I'll be honest, I never would've thought to take this one and do an acoustic recording of it. But somehow it...works? Like really well?! Totally changes the tone of it, but it stands on its own merit so well. Absolutely loving your work, and enjoying going back through your older stuff too.
Just one weee........to take you there
love this version
This is actually exactly  what we need !! A perfectly mastered song in the studio.. and then after that... a goosebump live acoustic.  Ren... you're already one of GOATS in my eyes!
Ren is always giving me Buckley vibes with the way he crafts these ornate recordings, then somehow sounds even better stripped down to just him and a guitar. This track is an incredible challenge acoustically, and yet he nailed it. Ren, man, I'm 40 years old, I'm supposed to be too old for heroes.
Salut Ren, tu est le meilleur est de loin, un vrai génie artistique, change rien tu déchire tout. Bon rétablissement et longue vie à toi. Bisous du pays basque.
I didn't think I could enjoy this song more, honestly. Please don't give up. Your so talented and your stuff is so refreshing! It's beautifully complicated while somehow having a simplicity which is so nostalgic.
The RENagade strikes again!!!!!!!!
Wow. The talent on display is truly impressive.
At this point I think we need a LotR watch party Ren
Never thought an acoustic version of this track could be so captivating. Pure talent on the next level. 👏
Acoustic version is so different from the original. The guitar brought something else to the song.  You've done a cracking job along with your mates doing the recording and filming.   Looking forward to next track from from the list of unreleased collection you've got stashed away
This dude is a freakin' genius.
Ugudeedaade
Don’t really know what i expected, but this was awesome!
This song is art...it doesn't fit any genre or category...Great song. Cheers
Absolutely Amazing ❤
I found myself completely distracted by the video of this song.   I like this version better.
How is this even more powerful than the OG???! Amazing.
are you related to Cillian Murphy? also awesome music my dude!
As 250 year old aboriginal vampire from the Appalachians with chronic ibs and I can't explain how amazing your music is!
just Brillant like everything Ren does
Luv you man,, would love to hear cover of hay bulldog
Oooompa ooompa oompity doo ……
What a completely contrasting rendition of this track. Absolutely class! ❤
Thank you for sharing your gift, I've cried, I've laughed, I've relived and I've  released my past through your music.  I would love to hear a retake on a Red Hot Chili Pepper song by you. Thank you  again for sharing your songs they have helped me feel like I'm not alone. I wish I had the right words to really share how much your music and lyrics have have touched me.
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
I actually prefer this version. It's pretty awesome.
Absolutely mind blowing how your able to just do this. Never stop pushing
I stabbed the bell with my mouse 🐁  bro
Just… wow!
So nice Btw you look like if tom hardy and cilian murphy had a child together 😅❤
FREAKIN LUV this very talented young man, a breath of fresh air in the music industry
Magnificent.  Simply magnificent!
I was looking for the words to describe this, but it is impossible. Either u like or not everybody can tell that this kind of performance is... 🤯
Love the cadence, either when playing or rapping, never miss a beat.
Man, that’s 10X the overproduced version. Imho your baskery skills are your genius signature. Here I feel your crude depth and your incredible talent, no bullshit, overthinking, pure rough and powerful expression. Cheers mate, GJ!
It will blow in metal
amazing bro.!!
Thank you so much for this, it’s amazing. Much love ❤️
Liked this better than the version with masks
Dam Ren.  You know how you feel when you see someone having the time of their life? That's how I always feel listening to your songs.
This imo is the better version of the two it feels more raw. Less commercial  less rapgod more the ren as we know him... both versions are great but this just feels better
Awesome and I enjoyed it more than the video. Very impressive.
wow... I was curious how he'd do it... I couldn't have imagined.  Very impressive... almost like it more than the original.
Wow … that’s all 😅👍🏻
Super Genius, I love this version
Pure Talent Ren x❤
Phenomenal!
Outstanding!!! So Fucking Talented!!! Keep Rocking Ren...spin that pain into Gold! U R AMAZING
I….um….DAMMIT 😮❤️ that was amazingly good
Amazing how you always make my day when you release a new video! Thank's Ren.
I like the acoustic version a little better but once again young man you keep it going your amazing at what you do don't let anyone ever stop you.
this fellow is just on another level between the tone of the vocal, the lyrics, the guitar and the act. stellar job pal!
I love you ren!!!!!!!
Not that there is anything wrong with the video it’s dope too
Dude this version is so fire better then the main video it’s just true
Raw raw raw......love it Ren, never been so drawn to someone's music since i first heard eminem and how different he was...keep doing what you do bro
🥰 Amazing
Never seen talent as great as this. So happy to have come across your music two years ago
Ren is a genius,  keep being and inspiration bro.
Outstanding version! Damn so good
Sam needs more credit. His videography really helps with a lot of the videos :)     Both you guys are fire. Great work!
Animal flow You're in the mind of a cannibal king Where chaos and anarchy roam And trouble is bubbling under the skin A certain insanity shows Whenever I pick up the mic and begin Whenever these words that I write With my pen come alive They ignite like I pulled out the pin    [Verse 2] Animal flow (rah) Out in the jungle I’m ready for war I'm beating your brains with a bat And I’m swinging it back And it's booky, I bite 'cause I’m bored Lord of the Cannibals, bro A murderous mind that you can’t ignore I wait and react with combat on the counter attack I'm the king of the junglе, I roar  (Animal) (Animal)  [Verse 3] Animal flow I'm the flow CEO I've got mountains of murderous rhymеs Mountain volcanic I blow and cause mayhem and panic There's no where to run from my mind I'm an impassible foe Never slowing, just growing And flowing with intricate lines Yes, I will dig in my teeth When I bite like a beast Blood, I drink it like wine  [Verse 4] Animal flow (rah) Out in the wilderness I will be king Sit on my throne I’m the Lord of the Rings Out on my own, I’m a terrible thing Animal skins, over my shoulders like bling They will be clothing my sins I came to win, over and over again I take your life with a grin  (Animal) (Animal)  [Verse 5] Mary had a little lamb Whose fleece was white as snow It made the blood look so much redder When I slit its throat Watch it drip, drop, drip, drop Until the ground was soaked Oh, Mary, Mary Quite contrary How the blood it flows  [Verse 6] Horrific, explicit I feed parasitic Acid, I’m eating your flesh Don’t fidget, I’m livid Not mentally with it I get kind of sick when I’m stressed I am the eye, I am the storm I am the fury, I am the scorn I am the belly, I am the beast Yes I am, yes I am, yes I am  [Verse 7] Yes, I’m an animal Yes, I’m an animal Yes, sometimes the things I say are irrational Yes, sometimes the things I do are quite radical Yes, I will be waging war on the capital Yes, I will burn the Houses of Parliament down 'Cause hypocrites - they burn quite easily, wow Burn and pillage it all to the ground Your illegitimate king lost his crown  [Verse 8] Animal flow Show no mercy under my rule I won’t be kind, I will be cruel Drown all my foes in a paddling pool Yes, I’m tyrannical bro, so Never mistake a man for a fool I'll take your ignorance right back to school And teach you a lesson for testing my cool
REN IS RAD.

Respect.... your tunes melodies lyrics  notes are so unique .I love the shockingness 😮😮of your video clips 😲.is that even a word dunno nevermind.ha
"keep it just incase" ... We're so glad you did 🤯🙌🏻
this level of genius and artistry is off the motherfuckin' charts.  MAD MAD MAD respect🙂🙂
Love this! It also has me hungry for the outtakes! Pretty please!
💪💪💪🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mind blown it's so good ❤
❤❤❤sick love it
Love the acoustic version, so many things about it are absolutely incredible!
Will this be going on Spotify
holy shitfuck.
amazing. that is all
On the bus... You prankster!
love it , just makes m want to try sing along live ... man making really music
I loved that Bm
Soft, and menacing. Love it!
Fucking hell!!🤯
Am I that boinky that I hear Ace Combat chords out there? Like at 0:29? Nothing against it, it just reminds me how old a fuck I am.
Kills this literally dead.
Alright, I love it BUT I was expecting the "yamyamyam" fill on the parasitic verse "When I'm not with it yamyamyam". 😆  No seriously though you're doing awesome man, I'm genuinely happy for you, your music gets me through my work days when I have to push. Thanks!
Brilliant ! ❤
The end had me rolling
Por que tem o Thomas Shealby com um violão na thumb?
Nope.....
Ren the way you roll with the bus is Boss, the beats tick so sharp and you flow so easy on your journey now.  This ride is meant for you my friend and I love the way you are so humble and inclusive to everyone, you are taking us all on this ride with you.  Your murderous rhyme and slick acoustic guitar is humorous; and yet your point with regards fighting against capitalist greed takes us right to the core.
This is where you shine dude, acoustic and half almost spoken.
Not my kind of music, but that was very cool to watch - you can tell when someone is authentically behind their art.  This was a random suggestion and I’d never heard of this young bloke before, but I’m really glad that I got to see this performance!  👍
Soo good
i didn"t know Thomas Shelby could rap.
U're just incredible.
Even when he flops it works
This is an automated message for the algorithm, I'll be sure to drop a comment once I locate and reattach my jaw and am composed again!
We are witnessing a musical genius takeoff and blow up right before our eyes and I’m here for the journey!
Loving this acoustic version 🔥
Incredible. You just kept going, full out, even when you got really far into the song. You never played it safe, because you wanted the perfect take. And I absolutely love how it ended!
I am too. thx so much for showing me again ren ^^
How TF did you make it even better live with acoustic guitar? I love the music video version, but this is outstanding!!!
Wow man, that was awesome!!!!
human power delivered in true force. Thank fuck for you.
So.....................damn..................goood!!!!! Thank you!
I'm literally obsessed!!!!
'kin ay! Dude.
And there he goes, not disappointing us, wild hungry creatures, again :) Given the condition of Ren's voice this must've been like, 5th, 6th take! Congratz on your perseverance!
Ren!!! This is top tier stuff! From busking to Bus King! The acoustic version gives it a raw/roar edge that just adds to the feel of the song. So, so good. Yaaas! 💯💣💥
This is great version ❤
Dude. That was fucking amazing! ❤ That version is fire 🔥 I love the original, but that is dope AF! As always, you killed it. Who is better than this man right now? No One!! Ren is the man hand down!! I'm 55 and love all your music so tasty!
Tommy Shelby going hard
I wonder how many takes they have done to achieve this quality ON A BUS! WTF!  What happened in the end, the driver braked too hard and the cameraman fell?  Could we then say that this is the unfinished acoustic version of animal flow? hehehe blew my mind 😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Im still amazed ren is the same age as me. he looks far younger
That was sick as, love it just love it
This man has talent...
He just destroyed this. Thank You REN. This might be my favorite of all his videos. Blown away.
So good!! 😊
Genius
Mooi man
Acoustic is better than the produced version. Love it!
I don't get it. I usually don't enjoy this type of music (whatever genre it is, it doesn't really matter though). I've commented this before and I'll do it again: I hope I get to see you live one day. I will happily pay for my ticket.
Ah, yes!  The hidden message:  Ren has gone from "busking" to Bus King! 🦁
Gave it a thumbs up for respect.. but it’s a hard no for me thanks.
Tommy fucking Shelby
What a genius poet. How do you even remember all these lyrics ??????
Love that you left the end interaction in as well. Makes the animal in you seem all the more human
I love this version.  Probably even better than the produced version. You look as if you enjoyed doing it. And the part at the end was testament to that. 😂
Korn should cover this
Better than the video, great version.
This was absolutely Great, he busking it, lol, on a moving bus totally A Capella, this guy always amazes me, his mouth he uses it like instruments it's crazy, He's Bloody Great,  so humble, his interviews, seems like a Great genuine person, love seeing artists like this, today thy are hard to find, thy don't come like him this day in age , Hope he stays independent...Awesomely done Ren!!!!💯❤‍🔥❤‍🔥🎶🎶
great stuff
Hi Ren brilliant work. But as you said yourself. "We must not forget that we are human beings" therefore we must at least recognize our humanity in our creative work. Keep doing what you are doing brilliant!
Ren says...I wanna do an unplugged version . Mate asks "with what". Ten grabs a gut string.  Mate asks.."what location?". Ren says...."hit record".  ...and it gets 120000 + of views. Amazing :)
Love how you can do one of your songs acoustic and it gives a completely different feel with the tone change in your voice
I was wondering, you've you've used the whole" dum da dum da..... dunkadadunkadadum" thing a cpl of time. Is it just a bear you like playing around with? Other than that, i really loved a lot of the guitars parts!
love the ending lol
Never knew how much I needed this Ren until seeing it!  So amazing, absolutely love it, thank you so much for sharing, gives constant goosebumps watching you play thanks again 🙏🖤
I loved this version too. Stripped back, pure talent speaking to us ❤x
Didn't know that Tommy Shelby can play and flow like this,
Crazy how this is so good unplugged and live. Who knew the acoustics on a bus could be so good! Nice one Ren
Sùuuuuuuuuuper fuuuuuuccckin dope....REN!... Man; how the he'll are ya ?....   Keep up that artistry that will top the charts
❤️‍🔥💫☆+
Pesky blinder Tommy on the bus
Our country really has got some seriously great artists. Ren is a breath of fresh air in a big industry. Well done ren. Your amazing 🎸
🤯⚡️
How can something be this raw and this polished at the same time 🤯
Thank you Ren, I believe I'm becoming some what addicted ❤
This is great !!! Honestly one of the most unique animal sounds ..growls I've Ever heard😮 def Beast status
Hi
Amazing!!!! I got stuck training at work during the release.. uhg. I love it! Great work Ren!
Needs more b minor
I’ve seen a lot of comments about animal farm being about the French Revolution….. it’s about the Russian revolution and yes it’s a George Orwell story, It’s a really good short read!
By far my favourite version, i think today we are so bombared with high polished content, the raw stripped back real music is lost but its worth so much more.
Everything you compose is incredible. Discovered you a few weeks ago. Best thing since Jimi
Musically, I prefer this to the original. Anyone else hearing Civil Wars type riffs?
You'll never see this kind of performance out of the likes of M or Kelly. That's not to say that M isn't the rap GOAT or that Kelly isn't great at what he does either, but that Ren is a unique talent and you just don't see anyone else doing this kind of genre bending performing of two very difficult feats at the same time at this level. If you think Ren is overproduced in a studio give him a minute and he will busk that shit and prove the studio mix is just an option. He can perform all this shit live, playing it on the guitar; and make it look so damn effortless.
Ren>>>>>>>>>CNN
Your rhythm is so natural, it’s mind boggling… LOVE this… love the string harmonic thrown in at that transition…. Few Artists on this planet have this ability… if ANY, other than you… ❤️
So weird to end like that. First off I love it but whiloe it was playing I was just wondering how many takes it took to get all this done in one take and to just end it with something like that is actually perfect.
That's the pure embodyment of a full-impact delivery with minimal resources - just passion, voice and guitar, love it:) Makes me headbang much more than the studio version. The roars interwined with the lyrics are just blilliant;) And I love the imprompt simplicity of the performance in a public bus, so casual it's just golden!
When doses the aaaahhhh yes
love the phallic seating...
Ren! This is unbelievably good. I enjoyed the recorded version but this one is so much rawer. It's got a darker vibe and you really get drawn into the theme... absolutely loved it. So authentic and the performance was incredible.
Umpa umpa dumpaty du, you have great rhymes and I’m listening to you….. I know I’m a dork, but I thought it was hilarious❤
👎Keep it just in case
#RENSZN
wow! love this Ren! thank you
I’m telling everybody how absolutely amazing you are….
Ren this is fire. And your sense of time is flawless. Now I'm going to practice guitar even more. 👍 😀
What guitar model are you using here ... I'd like to check it out. It's seems to be the one I was looking for months/years.
*BOOP* Class 👏👏👏👏
fukin genius bro ...FIRE!! much love from the U.S.
RAW power... nice work REN
Thank you Brother. God Bless.
Ren I'm 42 and u have inspired me with your talent beyond belief... u literally are the coolest man ... pure star quality... I think you are the literally the most talented person ever ... ive always looked up to Freddie Mercury,  David bowie etc for their pushing of the boundaries ... I say with true honesty. I think you have and will continue to surpass them as you move forward . Also your intelligence and knowledge wows me everytime I watch your stuff . Thanks for being you bro !
Sick
GOAT
🔥🔥🔥
This was DOPE AF!!! I love these live performances and how you utilize the guitar and beat box. This had a different feel obviously from the video version but I really liked the up close stripped down version a lot!! Keep killin it Ren, you are an absolute BEAST!! Thank you for sharing your art with the world ✌️❤️!!!
Ren is the busking bus king of the urban jungle. Brilliant performance. I like this a bit better than the original, but then I'm a sucker for the acoustic versions.  Looking forward to the next release. Will there be an acoustic version of Illest of our time? Would love that.  Keep up the great work.
Flawless 😂😂  Now have a glass of water 😂
@ren - awesome track! Love it! Hope you consider also acoustic version of "Sick Boy" track which is another banger.
Amazing as always!!🙌🔥🔥
Mate… I’d love to her this over a metal/rock track!
Description of A.I., it's gonna be a f..king beast. Reading Orwell's 1984 and next is Animal Farm because of your music, I need educating lol, you're smashing it Ren.
This is deffs as if not more harder to do than the one take vid clip .   Jeez your a bold fella .   Love ya
Sooooo good.  Loved that version.  You nailed it - flipping awesome! ❤❤❤❤
Bravo Bravo Ren love your acoustic songs keep it up my man big respect
Love it....😃
Vas y Mec ! Éclate nous !
God his flow is so smooth. This man is an amazing.
Omg amazing. That was even darker than the original. The things you can do with that mouth 😅
Ren I'm telling you,you have acting in your blood.
🤩
I’m wondering what the bus driver was thinking during this 😂
Dude has exactly the same accent/voice color as Tom MacDonald. Where is that accent from?
Straight skills bro always respect, keep it up man
your are one of the few true and raw artists of our time  - thank you so much REN for sharing your talents with us <3
Love it, ending is class
Ren dude, do us all a favour and get into acting,  you'd be superb in a cool tv series 🤟
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
No niche for the lion King . Sorry : Ren do your thing please.
Your just so engaging Ren. Even on your own in the back of a bus! Keep on keeping us entertained!✌🏼🇦🇺
Oh fuck off ren 😂 I'm not really conflicted on what version I prefer 😅 bro you are fuckin amazing and it's amazing seeing you get just a fraction of the light and respect you deserve
Insane!!
Wow!!!! So good live!! ❤
Could it get any better ???
I prefer this version. So raw and real.
Wait, is... is that a B minor?🤔 🤣
Wikid beat n all....
Good thing you kept that take cuz that was the 1!!! Broski ur a Musical PRODIGY!!! KEEP SLAYIN DA GAME MY G!!!!
Music has NEVER moved me the way yours does ❤ it’s unlocked emotions I’ve not felt before. And THAT is magic
👏🏼 love it!!!
I loved the original studio version,  still do , but this is fucking amazing. Keep at it young man ! I feel blessed to live in the same timeline as your good self .
Let's keep it just in case 😂
Powerful stuff! I felt this deep down to my core. Would have loved to have been on that bus.
It's so nice to hear you live!!
animal
Ren you're one of the greatest talent of our times. Unique
I prefer this over the music video
I hear a bit of Airwolf!
Never seen a Brighton bus so empty
I say again, when possible get thee to BGT, AGT, whatever major competition show. You will win that shit, hands down.
🔥🔥🔥
Wow those little roars
Just wow!!!!
WOW!! Fucking WOW 🤯 This is another level, keeping that take that is oh so nearly dam perfect with that ending added even more realism to it.  It wasn’t perfect but it was perfect. Pure Genius 🙌
Great job, bro. Keep up the good work 👌👌
Dudes ridiculously amazing.
❤ love it man!
Absolutely stellar, great take! The end just adds to the fact that you did this on a bus in one take. Love that you managed to beatbox and do all the little noises too! Raaaar 😂
I prefer this version☺
Amazing live version - I love the video but dare I say I like the live version better - shows the raw talent ❤
Wow. Even the bus was moving!
Incentive for taking public transport. Put a Ren in the back of each bus.
😲🤯🔥🔥🔥
....I am the eye, I am the storm I am the fury, I am the scorn I am the belly, I am the beast Yes I am, yes I am, yes I am  Yes, I'm an animal ......  amazing
Poeta, cantastorie, umile sconvolgente ragazzo..le tue storie sono razzi e stelle, eccelso, mi viene voglia di abbracciarti forte. 😮❤ Love from Italy.
Ren You Beautiful Bastard. That is fucking Awesome! And a Superior version. There were few lines in original I wasn't sure about. I caught them all on this version! And It would be cool to see you do Something With Britain's Got Talent winner Tokio Myers. Who if you're not familiar with him I'd be shocked.  Check him out think you really like Bloodstream and In The Air.
Cilian Murphy does YouTube music stuff now? Cool
All hail King Ren !! never gonna get tired of your creative mind. Amazed how you added the guitar and made it work 😮
now, i have trouble to decide which version do i love more😊❤❤❤ur music flows,btfl energy❤❤❤
Simply love this version 💚
Feckin class in a glass. 🎶😁
Is there anything you can't do? Well, I bet I'm a better cook than you at least! you'll beat me on everything else. You are amazing brother
a raw roar, loved it :-)
I just want to know how you only have 900k subs!???
This has no reason being as good as it is. Ren, you're an absolute animal! Love it!
This is soooo good! 😊
Just ❤️😳🍷🍷🍷🩸🐑
Captivating! Sticks in my head 👍🎶
Oh wow you were just getting to the part where you shift back over to B minor.  That is my favorite part!  The challenges of making performance art in the wild.
Love it, you did absoluly amazing ! ❤
Animal Flow featuring automatic bus announcer.
Personally, for myself, Ren is the most interesting thing to happen to music in years.
The rawer Ren is the better
The man brings gifts...legend 😎
Awesome
Fark!  That's awesome!
Ren you are a genius! And all your music are pure art! Got damn i love your music! ❤❤❤❤❤❤ Ren + guitar = ART! EVERY SINGLE TIME!
Love it !
SO impressive Ren!! Unbelievably talented!! 🔥
Fire.  'Nuff said, mate.    Can't wait to see where you go and grow.
Kudos (from Brazil)
Men! The mind separation is pretty amazing.

Ee eye ee eye oh!

Nice.
He'll ya Ren!
🛹🛹🛹
mhhhhh, love that "rahhhh" 🫠
❤
Yo..He’s just a monster live..Something just comes alive when he performs and then I never appreciate the recorded version anymore.
of course!!! a master piece, luv from france
wonderful!
Your gutair is your best asset! Love this, don't ever stop!
i love Animal flow , but how the f does REN make the live song sound even cooler than the recorded studio version, did you sign a contract at the crossroads or something man...... i am blown away. 💖💛💚 It is so fresh and different, so good and performed perfectlly.
Amazing!
@RenMakesMusic You made me pick up my guitar again after it collecting dust.  I think as a musician you'd appreciate I mean that as hug complement.  Thank you for the inspiration.  Ps. I also have struggled a lot with mental health.  Keep on doing what you do, I'm loving it.
Savage
I honestly think I like this version better!
This is mad! You are so skilled Ren!
Don't Ever Stop.
Brilliant!!....cheers from Australia.
Best version. Brilliant.
Nailed it. I like this version better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE IT!!!! 🤩 Great acoustics in the back of a bus. You could drive over to my Canadian city & I could help you shoot a video with the awesome acoustics I have in the stairwell in my bldg 🎵👌😊 I love singing there!
Fucking beautiful 😻
Nice bus move Ren. Did you take advantage of the government scheme extension of the £2 bus fare? Also bet you can’t get this line into a fast rap. “Bring the bread back Brad”.
супер, клип стоимостью проезд, и вытянут Реном. я бы добавил шиншиллу твою на бэк вокал рядом сидящую.
Dare I say it but I enjoyed this more than the official produced video.
Ren, Bus king on the bus.  Sweeeet !         LET'S GO PEOPLE, ONE MILLION BY THE WEEKEND
I am 50, playing almost 40 years guitar, met some great musicians. Ren, with your music, you show us another level, lyrics, flow, passion, emotion and sometimes things we are fighting with every day - that is such a gift. Hugs, respect and love from Germany! ❤
I want to see the written lyrics for this. Not just the words, but the sounds you make between verses.
Wow, that bus company just got the BEST ad for their "We're Hiring" message on the back window 😅
The only thing I can say is this word from my people. Tabarnac.    Bro.
y'all- we get to live in the time of Ren!
I was really wishing people would have popped up from behind the seats and did the yum yum yum. Part. But that was amazing
Perfect!
let this only unsatisfied comment been lost in thousands of ovations.... I dont like this version.....
I am so glad I found your music. It has been a marvelous ride and I look forward to all your future work.
Sooooo good!!!!❤❤❤
Never cease to amaze and inspire!  Outstanding, Sir!
Ren you're a crazy motherfucker and I love your music. We're all sick in the head,  some just don't like to admit it.
Killing it wit dem murderous rhymes!!!! Thanks for the video man!!!! Loved it!
I love how you make it feel like we are right there watching you play the guitar and rapping its awesome
Like thousands of other people, I'm at a loss for words! Thanks, Ren!
Can we please have your live songs on streaming platforms or at least Spotify?
Almost 1M subs lezz goo ren
He’s snowball and napoleon
ren youre fucking awesome, you got fans from argentina like my and my dad (who i presented to you :D) love your music, i hope you can make another song with the feeling of crucify your culture, i think its the best. keep up your good work and keep working on yourself!!1
Jesus H C this is fire.
No words... Just wow.. ♪♫♪ 🤘😎 ♥
Awesome, i just need another lifetime to master the guitar LOL
Excellent as usual.  I love the "official" video but I'm gonna have a hard time not loving this even more.
Lovely rendition of Animal Flow (Raw Animal mix).     Thanks Ren. Love you left the end in. The ride was terminated with the end of the song, too. 😂
Ren mate you made animal flow sound even better, it was already sick but the rhythm of your voice with the guitar is so damn satisfying. Flow CEO indeed
Love it love you Ren
We all talk about how good Ren Is vocally and rightly so but can we also appreciate just how good he Is on the guitar
Thank you for another great performance. 😊
Another killer tune from the Illest of Our Time. 😊
Yes, it was a GOOD ONE!   Nothing like watching Ren get lost within the music as though they’re one (which they are)   🎶🖤❣️🙈🙉🙊❣️🖤🎶
Of all the well deserved accolades for Ren's music, I find it most exciting to see the birth of a new genre of music.
I’m not into rap. But I can listen to Ren all day long. What a phenomenal talent. So amazing what he can do with just a guitar. You forget there isn’t a band or big production going on. It’s just him.  Who else has crossed so many genres? Won’t be long until he gets that interview with Oprah… Brilliant sir! Well done.
Ren, you are truly a talent that only comes along once in a generation. Masterful!
savage!
Fucking Awesome Ren..😎
I absolutely loved this acoustic  version, as well as the original release! You truly can do it all.   My husband is a metal head and loves your work also. He brought up an interesting thought...would you consider doing this song, metal or death metal, just for fun? This song has that belly fire in it. And you definitely have the range and talent to achieve it.  If you ever decide to do so, we would LOVE TO HEAR IT! 😃  Your music is all so different from one another, and you're incredibly talented in all aspects of your work. If anyone can do it, it's you! ❤️    (Probably typos, bad grammar and poor choice words 😂 I, my friend, can not match you 🙂)
Id give anything to meet you. You’re brilliant! I’ve never ever wrote a comment on YouTube or anything before but listening to you, this is my first now! You deserve it! God bless you doll!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Shhhiiittt I love this. Wow you are brilliant love!!
Raw talent!
Ren, Sir, you are a seriously talented artist. May you find the success you wish for and deserve. Thank you for being unique.
Holy fucking shit! I love the studio version but this just hits on a different level, so glad you kept it just in case! ❤
Modern day Mozart fr
Your inspiring and make me want to belong in the real animal kingdom.. hanging out with the real animal humains  Stevie Australia
Holy. Fucking. Shit.
Yooo this was fire!🔥😯
Love it brother. I need to get me one of those Cordobas.
you're still reminding of me of my little brother - wild talent
Love love love!
Brilliant...as usual
Holy Hell! I didn't know I could be more impressed by him. I'm happy to be wrong.
Speechless!  Soooooo good!   ❤❤❤
of course everything is amazing, but WHERE can i get that jacket?
Bruh…unreal…
That was awesome! Thanks Ren
Thank you.  So happy to see you performing! ❤️🙏
Love ya bro!
I see a future.  The next generation of a peaky blinders series with your own soundtrack.  You could be Cillian murphy's son!
Listening Ren sing live is something magical
Wow.
Awesome ❤❤❤❤
So freaking good
Awesome 😎
Ren asks an unsuspecting passenger on the bus: “Take my cellphone phone and keep recording until I’m done”, then the bus driver hits the brakes… 🚍🤳🚏🛑😆❤🔥👏🏼🤘
I love this so much!  All of it. But I’m what I have to say I love the most is the light in his eyes while he’s doing this. The happiness shining out of his eyeballs. LOVE IT!!!!  The lives show his passion as Cliff Beats says.  MAN, I WISH I was the bus driver of this bus on this day.
Ren is next level!   Insanely talented.  One of the most brilliant artist I've ever witnessed in my 55 years!
Me encanta como simplemente se metió a una micro a cantar, simplemente arte puro
I love how unsettling this is
Absolutely amazing version!
Pure poetry, ta very much.
Bravo!! Ren you are so talented and beautiful 💙 Your voice is literally an instrument within itself. Love how you act out the song with such passion! Your videos are amazing too but I could literally always just watch you sing and be happy. Much Love 😻
Omfgggg that was so good!!!!!!!!!!!!! 15/10
Man. This is nuts!
Pure fire!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is why you’re the best Ren hands down!!! Needed this today brother thank you as always 😎🔥
This is absolutely amazing!!! Ren you talent is endless!!!! I love you bro !!
Amazing. You are so talented bro. Keep it up. God Bless
This was creepier❣️       ✌🏼💖🤟🏼
You are so awesome 👏
Stoooooooop. Just stop. This much talent legit should be illegal.
That little harmonic strum 👌
Nailed it. The talent level is outrageous ❤
🔥🔥🔥
🤘😈🍻
I can't be the only one who sees Cillian Murphy in Ren, right?
You are the best!  🎉
💎👑
thanks for your music and insights bro
That was so great.
Dude....Sweet....
Sorry Ren messed up timezone😅
Such a sick 1-take!!!
Can only say this........ jebus!! Your insane!! Pure talent.
That was fantastic
Bminor moment
I didn’t know what to expect from this, but I love it lol  At least the beat won’t be stuck in my head…for now. Since I listen to animal flow at least 5 times when I’m at work
Wow Ren, you are just as brilliant performing off the cuff as when you do a big production. Awesome.
Triple like !!! F*#k man keep it raw! I love this ! Me and my hommies and they gals sittin' by a camp fire rippin' your flows ... I got some home work, 'cause you ain't playin' some stereo shit.  Much respect and luv hommie !! Keep it up !!
I just got off work I'm watching this for the second time I rolled up a king size fatty this is f****** great! Many blessings to you young man!🌿💔
Ren, please keep doing these one take versions with only you and your guitar. They are mesmerizing and really showcase your exceptional talent. Very few people can deliver such performances. People are starting to catch on to auto-tune and fake music, and waking up on real talents (at least I think, I might be over optimistic here).
Watching a genius arrive in real time!  A once in a lifetime thing!
WOW ❤........Bm never looked so good!!!!
❤❤❤ Ren! You rock!!!!❤❤❤❤
That R roll on Lord of the Rings.  🔥  You're so talented.
OMFG!!!! This is even better than the original version IMO. I'm watching it wide eyed, mouth open thinking like WATAF!!!!! Man Ren this is insanely good, no1 can touch this. Many people's confidence exceeds their abilities but you Sir, your abilities go way above. Keep being you. Your message is strong, you are making your mark that'll be remembered. I hope you get more and more recognition for it. PS would love to see an intro of your camera operator. Whoever that person is, they are entwined with your music perfectly.
Any tour plan soon?
Wow. So this is the first version I've seen and just listened to the original after seeing this. Imo this is way better then the original.
That was straight fucking dope mate
@Ren I have a Cordoba too. What series is yours I can't quite pick it out.
another busking video...
Sooooo good, I would love to have been on  that bus lol😁
Your music is much more powerful when delivered like this. All you need is a camera and a guitar bro. Cheers
Hi Ren, (the dark side), Reprise!  Great as usual. Natural talent, great stage presence. Wish I were half as comfortable when I play. Good luck on the outcome of your Canada visit.
yeaaaaaaaaaahhhh How can it sound so completely different to the studio one!?? and I'm loving it! and doing it on the bus and keeping the sounds of the next stop in haha 🤣 incredible!!
i am impressed and really enjo the lyrics  - powerful word play
Didn’t think Life of Pi could work as a movie….and I wondered 🤔how you’d pull off a live version….well I was wrong about both 👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥congratulations 👏👏👏👏🥂
Incredible! (as I've come to expect from Ren, and never leave disappointed)
Ren!! How did you make me like it more than the original cut?! Dude!
Thank you, Ren for sharing this acoustic version.  I thought your original version was wonderful and cool but there is something about a acoustic versions … humans are wired for voice and acoustic instruments IMHO.  Yea! 🎉👍
You're telling me the chords are MORE than *just* B Minor?!?!?!
Ren: bus-king!
You´re a legend!!! you´ve got so much talented and creativity, I wish to you all the best that you deserve in your career, greetings from Brazil.
You are so talented you are my top three there need to be more artists like you You're amazing
Got the Thomas Shelby look going on
I was hoping to see an angry bus conductor.
I have been on the Ren rabbit hole binge ever since he dropped Animal Flow. Had not heard of him before but am obsessed now. I literally hear the melody and beats in my head constantly.
Is this on transit,fuckin awsome
Dope, as per the standard you've set.  You're officially the first YouTube channel that I EVER rang the notification bell for.
Awsome
Fucking sick bro!
Okay I remember this rift in a tune on a kids programme my kids would watch when they were toddlers. Please, someone  put my brain to rest and tell me where its  from!
Your music is life im glad to have found  your music i havent heard one song that you dont kill it in your a musical genius keep  them comin
hmmm 🤔- This sounds a lot like Marvin Gaye's famous chord progression 🤪🐖
Oof
Wow!  That was fantastic.
#AnimalFarm
Once again you've gone and done it ren, been with you for years at this point, like a shadow following you in the night, keep at it man ❤
💎✖️💎✖️💎✖️💎
Imagine if Korn did a cover of this.
Luved it !! Thanks brother 😉
Loving this version of Animal Flow!!! Your voice, a guitar and your unbelievable genius is all that is needed!
So happy i found you Ren! I was struggling hard Bout a month ago. Muvh better now. Love your flow and incredible singing voice as well. Cant wait to watch you grow and show us all what musical visual art can be! Praying for your health as well brother!
The rawness combined with the perfect flow and intonation is awesome but the almost diabolical intention in the performance was the literal cherry on top. Raw creative genius.
I love this version! The one-take with his acoustic will always feel more raw, gritty, and powerful!
So sick 🤮🤧🥶
Just in case anyone thought he couldn’t… lol it’s all real folks. He’s that good!
The end was funny af   As always brilliant mate👍
This was really interesting to hear it in a different way. I like both. Thanks for sharing.
Primal as fuck.
Just amazing!!
Killin it!!!!!!!!!!!!
mentioned your name in class today, like 5 folks suddenly popped up talking about how your music is touching lives. Sir, i think its safe to say you're a cultural phenomenon at this point. On behalf of all the lives you've made better, keep on keeping on.
Ah, Another masterpiece. Thank you ❤
Love it. .
jesus christ this is insanely good. I liked the "studio" version but this is on another level.
Love this version! Well done!
I'm totally surprised by this version that I like even better than the other one! Ren is monster, it's a beast, it's a genius of his own creation. Just can't get enough of his musical universe. Bring it on, Ren! Thank you so much.
ahhh ffs how did this get better.
Jaw is literally dropped.... brovo my friend. This was very well done! A music video is one thing, but just a raw, acoustic, one take, back of the bus jam... I'm here for it!!!
I did not think this song could get any better... I was wrong. Edit - OK - I knew this reminded me of something and it was driving me crazy - Listen to Rammstein Los and tell me this doesn't have a hint of that in the guitar!
And I thought that the expected surprises with future work would be something I would already be counting on.  I was wrong, it's actually something new, it's a surprise and no... I really wasn't expecting this!  I can only thank the Universe for a talent like that!... He most certainly is it!... And I'm really grateful!... Thank you Universe and Thank you Ren.
Never a dull moment on a Brighton night bus! 🚌😜🔥❤x
Yesss,,,, dude, you got something else Ren,,,, timeless art for sure..🎉
FUCKING SICK!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing!
Yes indeed Ren...
Oh Ren...unplugged raw and  awesome.  Thank you man. ❤
A masterpiece in b minor 🔥🔥🔥
I think I might love dark Ren more than good Ren. That high harmonic made me laugh out loud.
F*(k!ng Awesome!!🤘🤘
G.O.A.T. Reminded me of Pantera “Walk” lol. Fn awesome u RENagade🤘
Come on man!! The original was fantastic, I don’t even have a word for this! Like most of us we had no idea how you’d do this acoustically, and now we know. 🤯Just fabulous Ren! Plus the ending was awesome and made me smile even more!
Bro you are an amazing artist! I'm not huge into hip hop/ rap but you are someone special. A generational artist. Hope you're feeling a bit better, brother. You deserve all the attention and accolades.
Love everything you do but just you and a guitar is extra special.
5 days early? Fuck yeah!
Dude! Said it before and I’ll say it again. You are brilliant! I now have hope for the future of music with you pushing its boundaries. Keep doing what you do!
I cant! No matter how I listen or watch, Im brought to another world w your art
When a artist  can sound better or as good as the studio  recording  is something  that's very unique. I usually enjoy  listening  to bands or singers live or acoustic  sessions.
Yoooooo!!!!! That was dope.
u a master, wish I could be half than this.
This makes me smile.
This one, you can focus on the lyrics more, but I love the performance in the other one!
I’ve been trying to figure out why I am so obsessed with Ren. I haven’t felt like that since I was a young teenager in the 70s. I think it’s because his music is so raw. It’s real. When we went out it was live bands. Everything was real. Music these days seem so beige. Everything sounds the same. Auto tune etc. Ren is so refreshing. He is real. Oh yea, and his talent is untouchable.
i like this even better
This is fuckin incredible! I say...  nice one, bruv!!!
Soooooo good!!! ❤
Ren smokes cigs right?
This is amazing music
Oooo this is 🔥
I love when he just makes different versions of his songs so much skill and work ethic REN
M-A-G-I-C!!!!!!
Complete genius! And the guitar playing is sublime!
Hell yeah!
man this is good!
You are absolutely amazing!!! Your voice is fantastic!! I could listen all day!! I have watched so many of your videos. I especially enjoy reaction videos. Lol Everyone is blown away by your talent! It is phenomenal!! “Hi Ren” I cannot help but notice you don’t miss a step switching between voices and the guitar changing at the very same time!! Simply amazing!! Not just on “Hi Ren” but all of them!! A very rare talent!! It seems to come so naturally to you. My husband told me I was addicted to your videos  so we may be having an intervention soon! 😂😂😂 (jk jk)
I'm gonna need a full on musical with some mischievous Puck-like villain voiced and acted by YOU.  The lyrics, the playing, the faces, the noises.... this needs to happen ASAP.
You've done it again! Absolutely fantastic 👍 👍 👍 👍
Ren first I would like to ask how are you today? I hope all is well with you. I just want to tell you that I enjoy your music and I really love when you play the guitar you play it so effortlessly thank you for sharing your music to the world! Take care of yourself so we can hear more of your music, sending you lots of love, light and many blessings!💛
Chalk out lines. When chinchilla represents dark chalk lines she represents the death off her life only to try to stop ren to live make the choice to live and send a message she be a ghost.
I absolutely enjoyed every second of this. I found u a little more than a month ago. You are by FAR, my favorite artist I have ever had the privilege to hear. You are an artist I didn't know I would like or need. Thank you for your music. I'm telling anyone n everyone who will listen to me about you.
Love acoustic sooo much
I remember coming to this channel and seeing a couple hundred views and thinking this soul NEEDS TO BE HEARD and i am so grateful to see this success ❤❤❤❤
I know you recorded this in Canada because of the big ''We are hiring'' on the back of the bus lol
Love both versions, just different
Okay Ren. Third listen. First play through I was like this is enjoyable, then I replayed it within seconds. Now I’m on my third play through. Wtf! You’re a wizard Harry
Fuckin’ fuckity fuck!!! Too fuckin’ good REN!!!!
That was awesome 😎
Inspired by you..and I'm old..well older haha
Truely the illest of our time.  Never stop being your amazong self Ren.  Much Love.
This is friggin outstanding, those guitar riffs are beautiful and savage!!
Love this Ren.....Love you like a brother.
Happy you kept it 😂🔥keep ‘em coming! 💜🔥
WOW! Just WOW! Amazing!

The authentic austere Scriptural is calling out to you Ren, inviting you to become part of His remnant family _[John 3:1-21],_ the road is oh so narrow _[Mat __7:13__-29]_ but it is ineffably worth it at the end. He has gifted you with above musician ability _[of course + the practice you have put in],_ and to sing unto Him and for Him is an utmost form of honour, glory, praise and thanks unto Him.  John 6:44  No man can come to me _[Jesus],_ except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
In a million years I couldn’t fathom this track going this hard on just an acoustic guitar?   Ren never fails to leave my mouth agape in disbelief.
So good!
Oh that's sick
Nice ren good job brother
I was waiting to come back to my house from work and fill my ears with this. Sounds extraordinary
Both versions are great. This one is just (clumsy word here, "just") more intimate. And of course, we'd all like to be more intimate with Ren...  The system announcements and jokes at the end just make it all the more worth while.
Gghrrr,, uuuhhhhh, rrrrrri gs, love that, well done, every thing you do is amazing, x
so real ....love that you did it on a moving bus.... just awesome....
ive havent seen anyone as great as you on guitar sorry iff i have any spelling mistakes😄
Absolutely amazing performance. This is my preferred version of the song because the amount of talent it took to pull this off is simply astonishing. Pure, raw, one-of-a-kind performance and talent. God bless you.
Once again Ren is giving Once vibes. Love it!
Well now I'm really curious how this track was developed. Ren did you put together the acoustic version first and turn that into audio production version or the other way around? Love both; this really gives us a glimpse in how you would busk some of these tracks.
You seriously blow my mind at how talented you are. The world has a lot of talented people, and you are top of the list in your field. Thanks for kicking ass!
You are the next Jimi Hendrix.  You know that, right?  It wasn't just a musing in your most popular song.  You ARE the most talented person alive currently.
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Cannot wait for you to hit 1 mill subsss
I am in LOVE with this version Ren omggg new obsessionnn
Fuck man. Acoustic or original, two very different beasts, both with some serious teeth. Massive respect Ren, looking forward to anything else. 🤯👊👍
Ren you are the best, love both of them!!!🔥🔥🔥
Ren on guitar, just perfect. The subtle camera movement in time with beat is really smart attention to detail.
The cheetah print!!😆
Huge smile…my goodness ,REN!,, rataplan rataplan ….touqui….touqui…❤️🇵🇦
This is absolutely incredible, I didn’t expect to love this more than the video, but I actually do. It’s so good!
true talent, found you when Hi Ren blew up and I've listened to you every day since.
I appreciate Ren most with a guitar in his hands!
Fucking amazing.
Lets get this thing viral, dude needs money for a new bus driver!
Wow.  Keep it ... just incase..... Would of been a crime not to have used this video.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I don't know the words to describe how amazing it is. I love this version even more than the first one. Love the guitar. Keep it up bro.
Now…can we have the backstory 🥹 of the set and video
Daaaaarn this so sick!!! ❤❤
Wow, just a guitar and your voice and it's still an amazing performance. Hope thins are still going great for you.
🐾❤️‍🔥🐾❤️‍🔥🐾
That was awesome!
Equally amazing even without all of the production!  Amazing!
Loved it! Brilliant!
How?!? Just how the hell can you make a perfect, live, acoustic recording of this song whilst riding on a public bus? Especially with this level of sound recording. I haven't got a clue how you did it, but Ren, you blew this out of the park. It somehow has a darker, more sinister sound with this minimal arrangement and I love it!
Wasn't really a fan of the other version. This is pretty sick tho. Keep doing your thing bruv
There is no need for any reaction videos.....we know what we saw....dope dude....
I'm moving to Brighton.  If you try this on a NYC bus you risk being choked out.
Genius !! Lol I love the end too..
Pantera vibes in the chords selection for acoustic, animal flow is a banger, im a really really big fan of u!!! keep up and get better! love from argentina
You, sir, are an intergalactic juggernaut. A cosmic storm of crazy acoustic angles that a normal human brain has to sit down inside the skull of it's home and try to decipher the awesomeness that is you, Ren. I love you, my guy!!
in YouTube music theres someone else named Ren who's single must have just came out but it's under your name in yt music the singles called secret place imagine my disappointment when you weren't there lol
❤ Being a non musician, I totally appreciate where the seed of greatness  germinates! #RENTOPIA
All animals are equal. But. Some are more equal than others
I really love your acoustic stuff. So raw and fantastic.
Master class talent on multiple levels
This is Amazing live performance there is nothing like him out there.
Bringing back the guitar!!! Love it!!! I've just been waiting for a good acoustic......hope there's another epic tale coming soon 😁😁
How do you rap without a drum and just a guitar that you are playing and keep the rhythm
🔥🔥🔥
Ren!!! Homie this is at least as good as the new video, the original version/non-acoustic. Glad You kept it- JUST IN CASE!😜 ANIMAL!🎶🐆🐈🦎🦍🐷🦁🐸🐔
crazy skills. guitar and rap - live!!! i would start to fail at even 1 Task
I didn't think he'd pull this off on an acoustic guitar, but holy shit, he did. And then some.
RESPECT!  WALK!
The filming in the beginning gives some "losing it" vibes. Love this version!
This great man. Keep it raw and acoustic
Nice, killer, sweet,badass,epic,fire, etc etc as always👏🤙
Again Mozart of 2023+. There is know one as amazing as you and your crew.  You make these singers, rappers, and wantabes who are using these autotune for there voices sound like banchies. You are the pentacle of a true talented no doubt genius artist. Bravo...
Stream the OG animal flow here!!!!  http://found.ee/Ren-Animal-Flow
Amazing.  I like original video,  but, the personal touch is a breath of fresh air.
Looks like the B minor has evolved :)  I don't know why but the "Mary had a little lamb....." seems much more sinister acoustic
😊😘❣️
what the fuck this was so good...
Any chance we get an acoustic version of songs ep? Would love an acoustic version of Sick Boi and Hunger.
You are just simply amazing!! Loved it! You make it look so effortless and I know it’s a lot of hard work!! I love the passion you put into everything 🙌 thank you 🙏
Imagine that u are a passanger and see this perfomance.
Da iawn Ren. Brilliantly worked piece. Brilliant take. Keep rocking !
Like a rapper fused with Eric Clapton. Amazing.
Dang it I was busy with the dogs and missed the live. ❤❤❤
Nice one, Ren. Guess what the busdriver was humming the next day. 🐷🐮🐱🐯🐴🐰🐹🐵🐶🦊🐸
best version so far ❤
It's WAY more personal when it's just you and the guitar.  Love this one <3
is that …. b minor??? 😱
Beautiful, cant beat theese stripped down raw versions! I think the end almost makes it better
Perfection!! My new fav!!! He thinks what my mind is saying.
I actually like this better than the main video!! And i absolutely love the main!
Was wondering how you would unplug this one. You’re just miles ahead of everybody. Not even close. When I’m not listening to you your songs are playing in my head ceaselessly. I’ve never experienced an artist like you in all my 49 years.
Lets see AI do that!!! This is pure brilliance
Ren Do you know what BUKI means?? According to the urban dictionary, it's a slang word for an African American, typically used by white people. A less offensive version of the "N word". But i know you REN, you used Buki meaning weird or strange, which is how i know the word to mean. I've not heard this word as a racial meaning before, ever. Have any of the black American community heard BUKI used in that way before as a slur??
aaaAAAHHHH
The last time I was this excited about discovering a new artist was 1986 when I was 16 years old and heard "The New Style" by the Beastie Boys for the very first time.  Ren, I found you a couple of months ago and I have already been through almost all your music that I can find.  Bro, you are the illest of our time.  You are a great musician, never stop.
This is the Best Version 💯  Ren ... stay Awesome my Bro⭐️
I love the way you implemented those harmonics
Your performance style is so engaging, and you bring so much texture to whatever you perform live. Your guitar and vocals are equal partners - they both sing and they're both percussive. Hats off to you
Absolutely class man 👏 how you can pull that off on the back of a bus is beyond me 😮 blown away 😳  we are witnessing greatest from you my friend. Thank you Ren
Phenomenal.
This is amazing. Ren is on fire 🔥 as oer usual. I love this just as much as the other version. It has slightly different vibes and I love both. But, gotta love the ending. I was wondering if the bus would interrupt at some point 😂. The man is ingenious with his recording locations.
Is just me? Or did we just listened/watched to the other "version" of Ren from Hi Ren .. I got goosebumps!! The grunts, the "crazy" eyes and with the lyrics of that 6th verse combined with the 7th - "Horrific, explicit I feed parasitic Acid, I’m eating your flesh Don’t fidget, I’m livid Not mentally with it I get kind of sick when I’m stressed I am the eye, I am the storm I am the fury, I am the scorn I am the belly, I am the beast Yes I am, yes I am, yes I am Yes, I’m an animal Yes, I’m an animal..."  I had sense this possibility in the original but now...yup !🙋 I'm convinced it is Ren (alternate) from Hi Ren.  And here I thought you could read minds too Ive hoping you'd do an acoustic cover or new song soon. As always lots of  love ❤ and hugs from Ottawa 🇨🇦
❤😊
That's a wrap. Off at the station, down to Albion kebabs and a pint at The Hope to celebrate a job well done.
You are good man! Number 26 bus back to Drum Brae North, just wake up in time to get off🤣🤣
Clever choice of a set for a sweet acoustic performance! ❤
I saw you say in the live comments that the bus driver kicked you off soon after.  I say you run with the angry parking lot attendant theme and get 11 more live one takes interrupted then release a playlist called 12 Angry Men. 😂
I always seem to prefer your live versions ❤
Impressive
My guy, can you leave some talent for the rest of us. Hahahaha. This if fucking incredible. Can't wait to see what you have in store for us next.
LOVE IT!
Magic 👌
Bahhh so awesome, just like ya said it’s a “flex” song
I’ve brought the demos (very good price) and have been listening to them over and over and wonder if all those plays would have been better if they were on here.  Do I buy animal flow single and listen to it 100 times or do I listen to it 100 times on your channel?
Ren your work is incredible you are just as much an artist as Picasso or Rembrandt! I have lived with bipolar for my whole life I’m a 48 year old British man, the system we have is ridiculous I had so many different diagnoses over the years and several close calls with the reaper!  Hi Ren and sick boi actually put into words lyrics and production the kind of thoughts and emotions my brain tries to deal with daily! Until I heard you for the first time I thought I was the only person in the world feeling this way.. Thank you brother stay strong stay healthy but most of all stay you 🙏💙
I’m on the REN TRAIN
Encroyable! X
Damn ren! I love this song but now you go and make your own shit even better. I just cant get enough of your genius
This is amazing! It gets better every time I hear it. I'm addicted to your music.
I love you Ren :P
Fantastic! As usual. You're totally blowing up mate!
Love Ren with his guitar. His talent shows through everything & can’t box this guy. Those noises in acoustic 😮I think I died for a second. My god! 😂
yeahhh booii! That was awesome mate 👏👏
The excitement just kept growing . From the beginning to the end . Every utterance,  every growl was perfection.
Hope you’re doing well over in Canada brother.. sending much love and best wishes from Australia your way mate… peace
Ren is piece of art in human form 🙂
Wish I could share on instagram but last time I checked they didn’t have closest I could find that popped up right away was nipsie.
So B Minor? 😂😂😂
Some day soon will like to see Ren on tour with a backing band....
Is that a Bm?
It was my brother's funeral today. Nothing can make that right but you gave me a couple of minutes of escapism. Thanks, man.
I like this version ssoooo much better ya
Fucking amazing
this is epic-er
Ren, your artistic expression is second to none ❤ Thank you for your authenticity ❤️‍🔥 and creative genius 🙌🙌🙌
So much better than my usual bus rides
❤ so many different styles in one! Love all your song's. You have the widest range of genres like I enjoy listening to!
Just love everything you do man keep up the great work 🇬🇧 glad your feeling better ren ❤
I love the original… but this is on a whole other level 🔥
Amazing!  Can I love both this and the other as two different songs?  ❤️❤️❤️
It's such a stripped down, no frills, production but so powerful at the same time and what a killer riff! It carries such force that, in my mind, I'm hearing down-tuned Static-X style industrial metal, but it's one person playing acoustic guitar at the back of a bus, it's insane. Ren, you're such an amazing talent, I'm in awe.
Не. Оригинал лучше...
Hey Ren ! i have a wish, please make a song with Mother Mother !!! it would be nice as F*** !
This man is an Animal when he flows!
Ren, you never fail to surprise. I'm honestly not sure which version I like best, I'm gonna have to listen to them both several times. The theatricality of the original was AMAZING! But yeah, Ren on guitar is pretty sublime so....
Dammnnn Ren I can't keep up with these bangers!!
🤯 🔥🔥🤯
Christ! You just showed everyone that you have beat the game and created a new level for players to beat. You “hacked the game”. I’m so excited to see the future. Thank you!
Freaken awesome, Ren!!
Every time I think you can't possibly top your last performance you prove me wrong.
You better keep it just in case. Please don’t delete any recordings. We need the alternate take more than you need a couple extra gigabytes for your AOL account or Yahoo or whatever.
Daaaaaamn, my dude..... Your live one-cuts are friggin AMAZEBALLS!!!!! Keep healing and perfecting your craft 🤘🤘
You are on a whole other level, no doubt in my mind. 🤘🤘🤘
Blown away!
Very awesome as always,  I love this song
Ren, I want to thank you for amazing music and telling the world your story. I listen to your music and feel it deep in my bones where it resonates with my soul. I am 50 years old and played your music and share it with my daughter who has had issues with her mental health for most of her adult life. She loves it as it's her jam (her words lol) I Love we have this to share and enjoy. Your words have help to ease her pain and to help her stop feeling so alone with her issues, to know there are others who suffer in silence like she does (her words). So thank you Ren from the bottom of my heart. I listen to every thing you have done so far and love it all. I hope your health improves and you can continue to follow your passion. You will never know how much you have helped people in this world Ren. This world is truly a better place for having you in it, much love, the old lady :)
Bruh, this is one of the most impressive things I've seen a musician do in a very long time 😮 I also love the ending "let's keep it just incase" it's so much better when it's this raw man.
Everything Ren sings becomes the most beautiful audio painting. This song truly showcases that primal energy and drive that we experience in our younger years - the will to fight and stand up for/against what we believe in - for good or bad. It is raw and unharnessed but also perfectly choreographed and has an ideal... flow. Being forced/bound down for so long with so many oppressions it is easy to lose sight of that energy and will to fight (for good or bad). Just listening to this riles glimpses of what used to be so fierce and had to be directed to the right things through massive fine tuning and seemed to have disappeared over years of getting nowhere with it. It does still live on though. Thank you Ren. ❣❣❣
Damned brilliant!!
Fucking fire
Like your acoustic work better than your videos.  You have the ability to separate yourself from others in live performance.
Purrfect like everything you do king Midas
Mate that's fucking dope, salute
I had no idea what to expect of the acoustic version, given that the studio version has such a sick beat...well, this was absolutely fantastic! Kudos on that guitar versatility. I love how you add interest and variety with the instrument, building and releasing tension along the way. So good! 🙌🏻
Yasssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!
In portuguese language we say: foda se que gênio
Better than the original.
ummmmm... I kinda need acoustic versions of all the songs now
Next reference… »Lord of the Flies »
Talent the whole way ✨♥️🙏
Class.....'Flow CEO'  love it
You are next level!
Saved me bro thank you Ren  and hey people don't you ever give up
When do you inhale?!
Ren the living Bard!
A man and his guitar - what more to achieve So SO SO brilliant creative smashing fantastic swinging like hell… no words to express the joy of listening to one more master performance of Ren❤❤❤ It’s like getting a hunger stilled you didn’t know you had… or something like that😅
Brilliant talent
I know it’s the YouTube algorithm but honestly feel like this is Ren’s world and we’re just living in it right now. Unplug from social media and the mainstream are oblivious, but in this wonderful Ren world I get great music and great analysis.
❤
Goes to show, a great song even without the music video (which lets face it, was great in its own right)
Only REN can turn a rap song into an acoustic masterpiece!!!! 🔥Beautiful!!!!!!!!!!👊
Unbelievable.....,!!!. Should be number 1 in the charts,, fact
so damn good!
That was so fkn cool mate.. ❤
I want to be on that bus!!! I didn’t think Animal Flow could be as good live, but omg it’s bloody awesome! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
that switch from bminor to bminor was hard🔥🔥
I love this guy
🔥🔥🔥 Love it my lad. Sending you love, healing thoughts and positive vibes bro. Big ups from Australia 💯💚
pure fire my mate!
This sounds amazing with the acoustic. Can’t wait to see what the future holds for you, Ren!
Love you bro 💜
👏🏻Truly outstanding guitar arrangement, ur a live beast 🤟🏻
So good!
FIRE BRO!!! You’re next level my dude.
🔥 as always
Is it bad that I like this version more? 🔥
Glad you kept it!
Loveeeee thisss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you Ren!! I wasn’t wondering how you were gonna pull that off, just knew it was gonna be amazing. Up to 900k, keep on subbing people. You’re the man to beat now in my mind. Most artist have one lane, you have the whole highway.. peace
Hope to see you live in Florida someday!!
Nice!
I mean Humans are part of the kingdom: Animalia so technically he is correct, he is an animal
Please stay independent bro you dont need a label to strip away your creativity . You are the greatest , dont let them take that away from you.  I believe there was a reason you got sick when you signed for Sony, because you are suppose to stay independent. Sounds ridiculous but everything happens for a reason right?
Lost for words....
SCREAMS how is this better than the studio version? i LOVE both.
What’s up from the U.S. Ren. Discovered your music a few days ago and I’ve been addicted since. Thank you for what you do man.
Sounds great,  Ren is a living Shakespeare with his music
Pretty good bro. Original sound
OMG the ending! Amazing. Cheers.
It was a really good one Ren...  The always impressive musician, writer and performer.
Absolutely brilliant 💯
Absolutely loved the live version. Man, when you play you live, it's a different level...F'ing amazing.
Effin' great! 👊 Hey Ren, did you know that in the film 'Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas', Johnny Depp based his character on John Frusciante? Just some random sh*t for you there! 😀
f in sick. you can sell out shows right now. hope i can see u live soon
Ren... please check out Rick Beato's lastest interview... with musician, producer and recording engineer extraordinare.... Daniel Lamois....   I truly believe that a project with you and Daniel would result in an immortal arrangent of music... I think that you would understand Daniel and his approach to music... and he yours... p-p-please....check it out... ❤❤❤
Very cool ❤
Can’t quite figure out why this is 100 times better than the produced version but it is. So much more powerful. Congrats ren
Love REN's 'live' versions so much .... they're even in my head during the day. Potency !!
Ren, you are so unique. Rapping with guitar seems to be your style and there's nothing like it that I'm familiar with. I've been listening to you off and on for a while now and I must say it's a really unique and amazing style
Even acoustically you are amazing to watch and hear! I may have only found you a couple of weeks ago but I've been awed by all of your creations!!!
Ha loved the ending, now thats proper live. Wonder what the bus driver thought ? :p
Ridiculously good as usual 👌👌👌👌
Yeah, fucking brilliant as usual!!
It’s so fun!!
I love it! I woke up with Crutch playing in my head so I was already primed for another Ren experience. This was a lovely surprise. The two different versions are, of course, totally different experiences but equally enjoyable. I love the Show of the original and the intimacy of this one. It’s fascinating. Thank you so much Ren. I hope you’re doing well
That was a different type of darkness with the lower key. Superbly executed! Light up those streets and shine bright!  Flow interrupted by last stop 🛑 love it!
I love this guy he is like a modern day Shakespeare and I'm here for all of it
While I do enjoy your produced videos, I much prefer you acoustic like this. It's more special this way.
How awesome!!!  I love this!!   Thanks for knowing we’d all want to see you do this!! It’s amazing how much healthier you look since you’ve been being treated in Canada!!  I hope that keeps going well for you!!!❤❤❤
That was good bro.  I wouldn't have expected an acoustic variation of that song, especially after your Bm joke lol.
You are not an animal Ren. You are a BEAST!!!!!!!!!!
Well if the whole singing, song writing thing doesn't work out the back of the bus you were riding said they were hiring people like you, LOLz. Take care of yourself brother and let the creativity flow. Stay in the stream..
Mate, I cannot believe the way you turned it into an acoustic song but, keeping the whole "Animal Flow Essence" like that!! It`s excellent!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Found your channel and music just some 30 minutes ago and have been listening to your songs. What can I say but that you are truly brilliant and you are literally one with your music and lyrics. It's full of emotions in an incredible way. Wish you all the best on your journey, God bless.
Such an amazing artist I’m addicted I need more of your music man!
Damn. You are the bomb.
Feckin great Ren.  Ren flexing with his guitar is unmatched. Brapp! 🔥
I watched this live while also on a bus....made my day...Thanks Ren for being you
So glad you kept this...just in case! Haha. Brilliant, brother!
Just before the end I was thinking - Now, please dont drop the camera, camera man! :)
Fricking awesome
Ren & A Guitar 🎸 Is THE FLOW....  Much Love From Scotland ❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️
Feckin’ amazing!
Absolutely brilliant. Really wondered how it would sound with just an acoustic guitar. Now I know. Even better. Although being as it's called Animal Flow then surely it could have done with a bit more cowbell.   😁
The composition is immense. Ren you bag of talent.
Amazing Bro as always!!! Look forward to every drop!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ren,  your f*ckups are better than any one of my greatest achievements any time, any day.. if you weren't so utterly brilliant, I might feel somewhat disheartened about that. But fortunately for us ALL, you're an original wunderkind, the *one and only, Ren.*
Personally love the rawness of this and how alot of my camera moves were with the swaying of the bus and work with rens movements and the music. Hope you all love it!
This man will go down in history as one of the greatest live performer with skills curated from a life of pain that comes out in the most unedited creative musical story telling power out there today. ...and did he just do this with a video cameraman between bus stops?
Like George Thorogood Ren is bad to the bone. 🤘🏻😎
I break into the kitten dance whenever this plays ❤
I love what Ren can do when it's just him and his guitar. Acoustical genius at work!
Fkn' A!! That was AWESOME!!!! Gonna listen to it again and then watch reactions, then listen to it again!❤
Well Its Already  All Been  Said , But This Is Pure Genius
Brilliant
I wasnt a fan of the studio version,but this stripped down version is superb,i think just you and your guitar is your calling ren,whatta ya say?
Yes,,,,,❤
He’s our generation of Bob Dylan think about it…
This gave me chills bro
On a whole new level, and the words actually mean something to people. ledge
Legend! Ren + Acoustic Guitar is all anyone ever needs!!! 2023 belongs to Ren! And Chinchilla 😋
awesome performance
It's like a completely different song killing it ren
AH! Acoustic & perfectly imperfect. The end seals the deal for me. Weee!
Awesome song!! Have a blessed day and we love you!!!
Yeah, that was a good one!
Brilliant!
This is how you know every penny would be well spent for a Ren concert. Zero chance of being disappointed by a live performance of any of your songs like you would be with lots of other 'studio' artists. I already listen to 3 different versions of Genesis. Curious as to how a drum n bass remix of Animal Flow would sound now 😄
At this point I'm convinced he is a alien sent here to blow our minds 😂
Ren never ceases to amaze me! Much love brother!
I love that it says "we're hiring" on the back window
Captivating ❤
Masterful, my friend. Glad your words are being heard. I've needed them.
The music world needs yyou. You make it richer  with every Song. Show the industry what a free artist can do. Wünsche Dir viel Kraft Ren!
You are ridiculously talented.I’d hate you if you didn’t also happen to be an amazing human being!.😂
that's actually pretty impressive, i liked the full polished version but live,  that's pure talent well done.
Both versions are wonderful. I hope you find it.
God I love your live acoustic rapping it's so awesome to hear without the extra production. It sounds raw as hell
I was working when this went live, so mostly agreeing with everyone else's complimentary observations 🎉🎉 Brilliant Ren 😅
It's sick!  Don't know why  I was thinking that no way this was going to be good acoustic!! Mind blown again!! The musician  he is deserves all the love he's getting plus even more!! Second to none!
How does this guy keep surprising me, love it!
F'ing brilliant mate, I love yourcstuff anyways, but seeing you do it live is something else .. You are so going far, Sikboi.  X  Kudos. X  Love SpazzBird,from  Wirral UK. ❣️ 💪👨‍🦽💨🇬🇧     So made up I found you and your tunes, I'm  buzzing man ❣️ X
funny you kill critics before they speak.  no voice manipulation . no mix tricks . no visuals.. and your brilliant.  I love the talent.  Like the full version a bit more ..cause I like the complexity.  I'm no musician but pulling of the intricacy of it in a fkn bus with an acoustic..  Impressed
Love the live version
Ohh, I really like this version a lot!
I like this one better... the other one is too scary😅
This is somehow infinitely more disturbing than the original. Very sinister. I like it.
I couldn't stop smiling, enough said
2:18 the crazy eyes 🤪 I love them so much
Absolute Genius
You played that wrong Ren, it's supposed to be Bm.
Ren, I've been around a minute. 58 yrs to be exact. You my friend, are exactly what this industry needs. Keep up the amazing work young man.
So, erm, the bus company is hiring people just like you!
Sooooo much better on acoustic
Thank you. Get better really quick mucca. I want to see you live! 👊
I don't know how you do the things you do.. but it's amazing and super impressive 🖤
absolutely amazing
❤wow!! Awesome as always Ren, you never ever disappoint!
amazing
This is 🔥
Honestly thought it was the beat I was addicted to but my man! That was some sexy acoustic and your flow is just as drawing as that sick jungle beat
"The journey is terminated here....All change please"  Nahhhhh defo wasnt terminated... you just sent me on a new journey with this version!!!
Bro that was sick AF!  In your interview with Knox I remember u saying that you didn't want to keep telling your self " I gotta put out more like this song or that one" and I think this is a great response to that dilemma.  If anyone ever trys to put you in any kind of box it will be a mistake on their part.  You have torn down the walls between so many genre at this point its insane to think about.  Only thing I haven't heard from you is country I think,  and you have songs with country vibes so.... yea.  I'm excited to see where you have this journey take you.  You already have a permanent spot in in my Playlist.
Skills dude, keep on keeping on 🤙🏼
Mad props man, I had no idea how you were going to pull off an acoustic version of this one but *chef’s kiss* you nailed it. Only thing I was waiting for but missed was a heavy pluck of the 5th fret harmonic on high E to simulate the noise of the pulled pin, but hey, that’s like me criticising Michelangelo for heavy brush strokes on the toenail of an angel on the roof of the Sistine Chapel. It’s mint mate.
cleanest bus ive seen. great job ren love ya
Loved it man!!! Keep up the great work and enjoy your life the best you can
I'm a 54 year old musician. This guy is a f**king Alien. Sent to push us forward.
Unrecognisable from the original and vastly superior, in my humble opinion.
So awesome to see this acoustically! Crazy! I just watched Daily Doug's composer's breakdown of the Animal Flow video, where he points point out various notes and time signatures --I wonder how much of this he caught, and how much you created new for this version! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psh1rpDX4MM
This is f×cking fire! 🔥 🙌🖤
Ren, I hope you have people watching your back. If not, I’m more than capable. I’m starting to worry  for you because you keep moving that bar higher and higher.  Some artist have been at it for decades and haven’t come lose to the impact that you have made in just a few months. It almost feels like you cheating somehow. Of course Im being facetious but to have such a high opinion on your work after 2 short months of exploring your music really says a lot. Just in case you haven’t noticed, others are making a claim for your GOAT status. Honestly,I can’t disagree.
Ren, you're the best freak of musical nature to come out in decades. This from an avowed '70's prog-rocker aged 61. I've seen some great s**t man. And I'm overjoyed to be doing the same again now. Blessings.
Wonderful job mate!
This is so awesome Ren , no limits bro , there is nothing in the wonderful world  of music you can't do.
Ren my bro, you nailed it of course, but you looked hella tired man. Don't forget to get enough resting time so you keep standing strong, I guarantee you me and the majority of people you gathered with "hi ren" are to glad we have found you to break up with you for another art related genious equivalent to how Einstein was a genious in his field.  Its ok to take a nap sometimes, specially when you are over 30 too.   😋
Wow! Absolutely brilliant mate! Tbh I like the feel of this version more! Both are epic though! Keep smashing it man!
Amazing!
I was wondering how this would go on acoustic but that was good.
Only REN can take a song with one chord (B minor!) And play it Sooooo expressively!!! Excellence and Brilliance are words to simply begin when describing this Cat!!!
Love your artistry Ren genius
As good as the video, so good
Nice bro!  I love your expressions when you are playing live!
That's not a stagecoach bus is it Ren,  you missed a trick with some old bird saying is anybody sitting there...............
I just googled a single bus fare for Brighton and Hove,  today's price is £3.10, a bit less when this was recorded. So the budget for this video  was somewhere around  six quid. Money well spent.
💖💖💖💖🇬🇧
Magnificent!! ⚡🔥 🌠   Thank you Ren. Love you 🙏💟
Definitely more interesting this way! I know you are brilliant no matter what you do, but man, you specially shine with the classic guitar in your hands. I have never really been into rap and even though, I find Hi Ren and the tales so unic and so utterly brilliant.
Bus driver must've been having a right old jam downstairs 😂
You continue to amaze me every time, one of the reasons your song are so good and I my opinion will be timeless, is that they work both as a full production or simply stripped back to the simplicity of one man and his acoustic guitar. You are an inspiration to all musicians and songwriters out there and every time you release something it lights a fire under my creativity and gets me excited to work on my songs. I love all the reactions too as they break down aspects that sometimes get missed when just sitting back and enjoying the song. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
King Ren.....Wow
Loved the video for this👍 but this acoustic has something special. Top draw again. Also well done for picking a bus route that didn’t have potholes like bloody craters🤣🤣. Hope the treatment is going well. Take care Youngblood, the world needs you👍💪
U are FANFUCKINGTASTIC!!! IM LOVING YOU  JOHANNA FROM CANADA ❤❤
Wow an absolute masterpiece masterclass
🌊
Gold REN.
Hypnotic and amazing skills,nice one Ren
For anyone asking  - Who's REN ? THIS is REN
Loooove this!
When will this available on Spotify I must add this version to my playlist.
This is sooooo Good!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
You are a musical Shaman, Ren.
Damnnnnnn!!!!!!!!
Ren!! It's awesome of course because you're just chock full of talent. Is that the top you wore when you n Chinchilla did Sexual Healing?
what a raw and wild ride !!!!
You're getting waaaay too much hype. Someone needs to bring you down a step...uhhh...your...High E string is a 1/16 off note... .... ..  dont..stop...moving..you're almost there ;D
Stunning!
Agree with most of the comments. Ren with a guitar and voice is all you need. Loved this and I loved the ending, made it feel so real. You're such an animal bro!
Love Animal Flow the video but this takes it to another level. Hope you are doing well. Peace.
I LOVE this version - PURE RAW UNADULTERATED POWER ! 🙏
Live or video you smash it brother 😁👊👊🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Back seat Bus busking so good 😄🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥
While on the damn bus??  Dude.
Yes i am yes i am.. blown away by the words you write and perform. Every syllable resonates to my soul. Smashed it mate. Love the comment section your fans are wholesome af.
Well this just proves the only box that might hold Ren is Pandoras. Remember like my grams always said its better to be seen than viewed.
I've had this song stuck in my head and this is by far my favorite version of it ! <3
Brilliant
You are a true artist!!
Slow down my man! Trying to catch this... So it B minor... Whats next?
I’m obsessed with him and his creations. #TheArtistIsPresent ❤🎶
Wow!
Exquisite brilliance ❤️
Makes me wonder how much of an animal he is in the bed 🛌 🤔
Oh my God I'm so in love... Shit. ❤
Please make a cd!!!
Let's get this LEGEND to 1M Subs, send word out to everyone you know!
Nice ending
Intense!
No animals where harmed in the making of this video.  🔪🩸🐑
Holy shit…. How can you do an acoustic rap and make something better?
If Joker had a theme song, this is it.  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm sick of this chap blowing my mind ha ha ha by god I'm not...unreal talent!!
Excellent Ren.😊
You are so talented, that's insane.. just one word: merci. (love from France). p.s.: dat harmonics at 1mn20s 👌
Amazing
Why is this version even sexier?  What is wrong wrong with me?
Amazing
So… you’ve created ‘Animal Flow’ with friends and a budget and, let’s be honest, it was very close to perfection (if it wasn’t actually it)…. Then you do something ‘simple’ (well, to us mortal ones, anyways) with it and you manage to über yourself! 🤯 This is why I f***in’ love you! Still so unpredictable! Bloody love it!!   Also… ‘Hiring people like you’ takes some of the credit, too. 🤣
❤love your work Ren and your mission mental health we see you
“Next Stop.”
Noice... 🙏✌️
Damn man... im blown away 😲😲🤯
🔥 Beast flow
Well played Ren, well played :)
❤love it❤
He is not the messiah he is just a very naughty boy
Brilliant
Can not believe how good this sounds. Damn good job my man. Love & Peace 👍✌
Yaaasss!!! 👏👏👏👏
Great work as always, cheers
One word needed... Genius!!
Cillian Murphy is a rocker now.😂
Ren and Sam Tompkins are both guys whose studio recordings I enjoy a lot. Then when they go raw it never fails to be at least as amazing if not more so. I love the creativity that goes into the live versions to make them sound so different. Also its amazing to hear a version that you know will never be exactly the same if it gets played again. It shows a more truthful snapshot in time with a fizzing of creative energy as they play through any flaws or changes in emotional tone and adapt to each little moment.
Gotta love this guy.
great
Animal bus-king 🤴 using so much more than Bm chords and dropping the camera at the end like a boss 🙌 😂
OMG!!!! As expected!!!!! Thanks Ren!❤
Yeah, not one of your best.
We are all Animals...
❤️‍🔥the boss on the bus back seats.
BAD ASS!
This fkn guy, bro you are so 🔥🔥🔥🔥 took less then 3 months for REN to become my all time favorite artist.  Much love from Alaska!
Please musicians, translate this into a metal song, this would be so powerful
Props for playing 1 note for 90 percent of this and making it very interesting. Musician respect 👌👌
Brilliant!
Ren's artistry flows with musical poetry ❤
Only you could pull this off Ren. Not sure how you did it, but then you are a musical genius, so yeah 👍
The harmonic hit was just to flex on em!! Lol You remind me the algorithm isn’t all bad. Good shit.
Christmas in May. Damm, this is awesome. Best acoustic rapper out there.
thought i was hearing Pantera - Walk vibes 🤘
I love how Ren always keeps his acoustic settings simple. Like him just casually doing a commute on a bus playing his guitar 🤣 all the while having us drawn to his presence and amazing acoustics and not wanting it to end. It don't matter where he is he just makes the environment fit him and his  talents, that's some talent alone never mind his amazing well thought out lyrics and the way he pieces his voice like with little rhythms of random words that just somehow fit each song even though they are different but it still fits in with the song like it was meant to be there like the the little 'dom da dom da' in animal flow. It shouldn't amaze me anymore but he still seems to have the same effect on like I'm just hearing him for the first time
As said before, pure Genius!
✨✨Brilliant✨✨
Woah !!….. that’s 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love this version just as much as the recorded one. Ren you are a magician. Hope your treatment is going well as as soon as your back in the UK I think there will be a lot of new fans waiting to see you live:)
It's funny that you should be on public transport doing this song. I was telling someone not long ago, that if you wanted to vacate a bus bring a guitar and recite the devil lines from Hi Ren and watch everyone run for the exit.
You'll be at a millions subs soon. Anything special planned?
Love, light and ambrosia! dharma.
Legend on the transport
Love it dude! Keep pumping out the content!!
The ending made it for me 😂😂😂😂❤
Loved it. I mean i knew i would but still... wow this is good
Love this version, got it on replay for about an hour now :) Thank you so much, Ren! 💙The art you create is stunning. I'd love to know how many hours you spent on busses that day.. All the best to you and your beloved ones and greetz from Germany
Damn I missed it live. I luv your songs.
I love the acoustic version!!! ❤ Just Ren and his guitar and his unbelievable multitalents…  …Keep shining Ren! Thanks for your art, your music, your soul, your thoughts, your existence… that you share with us!
Thank you! :)
The urban shakespeare strikes again
Oh man I love this version even more! It’s such a raw experience watching you play live. You’ve done it again! 🙏🏼 💕
Wow, I actually prefer the acoustic version.  However,  the video with the Animal Farm themes is a different beast.
I like this version better. 😜
Ren is the busking bus king!!!
Like I cant stop watching reactions to you’re stuff and you bring out the best one yet? You can’t let us breathe, next thing you will be telling me you support Everton
This version is even madder than the Original! ❤️‍🔥
Bravo mate!  I liked this one more than the theatrical release!
Man, I love what you did with the guitar on this. I was wondering how you'd make it work.
So glad i stumbled across your work, thank you, your art spans the ages this from a 65year old
I prefer this version over the original
I was feeling so low today and this just made me so happy. You are a tonic Ren ❤
A very good one! Timed the bus announcement perfecly ;-). Big love.
I discovered Ren through Hi Ren which has become one of my favorite and most influential songs in my life, crazy enough.   I actually like these one-take live guitar performances more than the studio music videos and beats. The guitar adds so much to the raps, and the live performances are so raw and theatrical and impressive
Genius! Fantastic guitar player, ingenious word acrobat! Ich verstehe nur 10%, bin aber zu 100% gefesselt, hingerissen und begeistert. Deine Musik ist so einzigartig. Akustisch noch beeindruckender. Danke, Ren!
"Keep it, just in case". Well played, fella!
Awesome! I LOVE this acoustic version! Such amazing vision and skill…thank you for sharing your talent and music with us❤
Just… genius ❤
I love how you kept the take that fucked up at the end!
You're the GOAT, Ren. Keep it real, stay true to yourself. You're a rare gem, kid. Love you heaps.❤
I absolutely love your music! I've been listening to everything I can find. These songs have really made my days brighter. Been through some difficult times recently and your music has been a great way to get through the day. This is another great example of your talents. Cheers!
Holy crap, man! Absolutely brilliant. And sinister. Brilliantly sinister.
I love the passion....I love the basic approach....I  Love the lyrics.... Thank you  Ren
Brighton represent!! Banger!
this was AMAZING i love your acoustic versions so so much!
That was awesome.
Ren, you are so amazing and talented! You are a true legend and I love you so much.  I just liked and subscribed so I don’t miss any of your awesomeness ❤️✌🏻
Couldn't watch live as I was teaching my yoga class, but came straight home and fired this up. Didn't disappoint 😅❤
Nice ❤😅😊
Better than the full production version!!! Friggin awesome. Although I did miss the pussy….cats 😉
I am impressed with how absolutely articulate Ren is when he sings, raps or is just speaking-like in this video, Hi-Ren or in the Knox Hill interview.
Rens stories will be told for years to come, whilst others will fade away
Keep it.  Just in case...
I will report this for false advertising, we were promised it would be only Bm.
So glad to have heard this.  There were things I heard that I missed in the video due to being distracted by what was going on.
I loved it! ❤ Ren's voice is so crisp and clear. The guitar and Ren is all we ever need 😊
Everytime there is a new upload, live or anything to do with Ren, I stop what I am doing and find time to watch, listen and appreciate this art !!
Absolutely fffing awesome ren does it again what a banger .
Just ridiculous talent, love it!!
Genius!
This is unbelievable, Ren is on a totally other level. To play guitar like he is while flowing like this is just ridiculous
Amazing. Ah. Maze. Ing. How the hell you play that and rap at the same time is beyond my comprehension. Now I'm curious if you wrote it on guitar first, or transcribed it. Incredible. Continued good health and every song makes me long for what will come next.
Awesome! Your sounds are very creative and I love hearing whatever sounds you've decided to include! Thank you so much for doing another one live 😘
i cannot express how impressive i think you're music is and your acoustic versions especially hit just as hard if not harder than original it's nuts
brilliant
you created your own tone and style that is one of the most unique things an artis can do.  From *now* on playing the guitar with such tone style and progressions will be referred as 🔈Ren Style,🔊
Let me guess.....B Minor?
Bm Bm Bm Bm
Why Ren isn't a superstar already amazes me. Surely somebody like Jools Holland / Rick Beato needs to hear his music and promote it. I'm sure they would appreciate it.
Yeah, he rocks
...been on repeat in my head for days, you annoying genius ;) (rah!)
That was great man 👍
This was epic almost reminds me of a irish trad session at-a house party or something!!
So intense! Loved it! The poetry of your words .. I liked being able to hear it better , but I was still imaging walking with you through the whole video while you were singing.. lol 😂 You are a musical beast ❤
just wow!
Different feel for sure. Still really works though. Very well done, sir.
Oh, some Konnakols!
Oof
this is awsome!!!  and... I want that sweatshirt!!!!
The flick after "drink it like wine"!  This is so fucking good!!!
Yep you're a nutter 😂😂😂
Ride the wave
Fantastic uncomfortable genius 🤯
The ending 😅😅
Sounds like a mash up with Camberwick Green
Oh my feckin' god... Brilliant - prefer this so much more to the other version... please, please, please do an acoustic version of everything you do... Always wondered what the next Dylan would sound like and when he would come along!!!
PLEASE PUT THIS ON THE STREAMS ‼️‼️  #Ren
Love this version!!! I enjoy the offical video as well. You are amazing Ren ❤
hip hop aint my thing, but I'll support anything Ren does, we need more unique voices in music
Smiling proudly throughout this...like a proud Mum 😅😅...this is Gold..Blown Away Again ..Thankyou Ren..you are KING !!!!!
Awesome reference to the Animal Farm commandments
We deserve to be the enemy of all other animals and if it comes down to it I won't be cheering for humans.  Awesome as always Ren ❤️
L-E-G-E-N-D-A-R-Y😮🎉🎉🎉 Congratulations, mate, you rule👌✨😲
🐐🐐🐐🐐
wow we were waiting, look how many hits xx
Fuckadoodle doo! Just when I think you can't amaze me any more, you pull this off! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow! You are so talented!
Perfect
Dudes next level, big time beckons, I'll give it a year..2 tops until you're touring with Ed.❤
Ahhh I was wondering how an acoustic was going to stand up against the original. Silly me for even asking!! I love your expressions when you're playing live - that you totally get into the part. I can only think of one other rapper who does anything similar, and it's not even close to being comparable! I could watch you play all day 🎉
So hard to get a one take on amoving bus. Ren you are insane in the best way! You almost had it perfect til the bus turned and the camera person fell over. I laughed so hard. Effin real, Man. Im so glad you posted this take. 😅
Man, how tf
Just wow.
Acoustic Flow
Just took the 50 home to fiveways.  Ren, I'm looking forward to seeing you back in Brighton.
He's getting out of hand and i LOOOOOVE it!  He will rule for sure!
best version ever - : Ren and a guitar, nothing else matters :)
Absolutely amazing! You are so multitalented as well as insightful and intelligent!
Damn Ren, that was so friggen good man ❤. There is no challenge this man cannot dominate
Fucking incredible!
Who else did the YUM YUM YUM part when he got to it.?
Love this a lot!!
Ren - phenomenal 🙌 🐷🦁🐰
Fantastic! The ending made me smile. AI would have never thought to end it like that. 👌
How is it possible to make a hauntingly good song so much more haunting stripped down with just an acoustic? (Insert Highlander voice here.)
You’re mesmerising. Just can’t take my eyes off you in this. And your guitar is FIRE. ❤️
I have been sat here learning this as just Bm on repeat 😉😅🤣
Wow. At first, wasn't sure it would translate all the intricacies of the video performance. Proved me wrong. Awesome performance once again. Continue to amaze with your raw talent.
🔥🥰🔥
Straight 🔥
He look like Thomas shelby
Holy shite - incredible- sone great guitar licks - soooooo good 😮❤
Yooooo!!!! Equally as badass as the original! Keep sharing your art❤
Ive just come out from living under a rock 😂 because ive only just discovered your music! And all i can say is you are INCREDIBLE. Your music has blown me away like when i listened to the marshall Mathers LP for the first time 🔥🔥
Very amazingly done!! It sounds great acoustic ❤❤
You're a frkg BEAST Ren ❣️❤️💯
Hey Mr Bus Driver.  Are we ok doing a quick music video upstairs?  Just one take pal....  Nah problem bruv....
Yusssss 🔥🔥This song is beast in both styles for sure. raawwrr 😂animal flow!!! 🦁🦍🐷🐮🐏🎶
I love this. Its so different but perfect too.
Wow, this sounded metal as fuck, lol! I really hope we get to see more of the heavier side of Ren in the future! This was great.
Killing that Bm chord Ren!
Anybody else out there fill in the "yum yum yum yum yum" bits while listening along? Just me?
Браво, прекрасно)
wow
The song is in acoustic super cool too.  I was‘nt quite sure how you'll pull off an acoustic version, but you smashed it. 😉 😁
Damn nro! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 1:51
🔥. Just 🔥.
This was fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Perfect jacket for the occasion :)
That was great!
You've brought MTV Unplugged back. Raw is War
Huge improvement on The Wheels on the bus 😏 brilliant
Sorry to use the pun but you fu£@ing animal!!!! Neeeeeeexxxxxxttt level stuff 🔥🔥
Anybody else was singing "yumyumyumyumyum"?
Outstanding as always! Hope you are doing well with your current treatment. I don't know why, but for some strange reason I just imagine you and Louis Cole working together to do something epic. I feel both of your lo-fi, independent, raw styles would mesh brilliantly.
AGAIN! brilliant!
Amazing talent. Song sounds great acoustic
LOVE your live takes!!!🙏🎶🙌
The absolute rawness is perfection, loving this version REN!! ❤
Fantastic, again. Even the unexpected (unintended?) ending added to it. :)
Killed it again Ren....legend
Brilliant!
I think you played it wrong Ren I barely saw a single B minor
Ren it was worth it! Your animal flow was perfect ❤
That was amazing! You are such a talent..
You’re the Boy 🫶🤗🔥😘
SO GOOD!!!
The genius that is ren strikes once again outstanding young man
Ren with a guitar and a good vibe is unstoppable
So talented, I can listen to you all day. You did so well.
Just amazing and really like the authenticity of the unplanned ending by not editing it out
I'm so glad you put it out, even with the camera going down at the end.
How good was that?! Fucking hell amazing
😜
Fucking 🔥 broski! Better than the original!!!
Love it. ❤ How you make that work acoustic is pure skill. ❤
As always. Mind Blown
Love the Raw-ness of it.  Unless there's something significant left, keep the vid just like this !
Am I the only one who gets a visceral feeling when hearing the grunts and the feet stomping? Just me? Cool cool
Merci Ren ❣
I have to go against the stream. After all the tales and hi ren this is the first time I actually like the studio version more.
Ren,   my son (10)  decided that you would make an awesome wizard (as well as a bard) because you'd be able to spit and flow through spells like none other.   Which just made all sorts of stories come alive in our heads.   But whether it be a song or film appearance or something in your future (dnd sequel)  it'd be an interesting story to see and  hear with bardcore skills
wowowowowowowoowoow!
Man how can one human be so fucking talented! Loved that you kept in the outtake at the end, keeping it real as always :)
FUCKING BRILLIANT!!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Your finger pickin is so sick mannn!
Fire music but that jacket is dope asf
Love it! Thanks for the music dude. Peace ✌️
Best ending 😂
Animal flow You're in the mind of a cannibal king Where chaos and anarchy roam And trouble is bubbling under the skin A certain insanity shows Whenever I pick up the mic and begin Whenever these words that I write With my pen come alive They ignite like I pulled out the pin  Animal flow Out in the jungle I'm ready for war I'm beating your brains with a bat And I'm swinging it back And it's booky, I bite 'cause I'm bored Lord of the Cannibals, bro A murderous mind that you can't ignore I wait and react with combat on the counter attack I'm the king of the jungle, I roar  (Animal) (Animal)  Animal flow I'm the flow CEO I've got mountains of murderous rhymes Mountain volcanic I blow and cause mayhem and panic There's no where to run from my mind I'm an impassible foe Never slowing, just growing And flowing with intricate lines Yes, I will dig in my teeth When I bite like a beast Blood, I drink it like wine  Animal flow Out in the wilderness I will be king Sit on my throne I'm the Lord of the Rings Out on my own, I'm a terrible thing Animal skins, over my shoulders like bling They will be clothing my sins I came to win, over and over again I take your life with a grin  (Animal) (Animal)  Mary had a little lamb Whose fleece was white as snow It made the blood look so much redder When I slit its throat Watch it drip, drop, drip, drop Until the ground was soaked Oh, Mary Mary Quite contrary How the blood it flows  Horrific, explicit I bleed parasitic Acid, I'm eating your flesh Don't fidget, I'm livid Not mentally with it I get kind of sick when I'm stressed I am the eye, I am the storm I am the fury, I am the scorn I am the belly, I am the beast Yes I am, yes I am, yes I am  Yes, I'm an animal Yes, I'm an animal Yes, sometimes the things I do are irrational Yes, sometimes the things I do are quite radical Yes, I will be waging war on the capital Yes, I will burn the Houses of Parliament down 'Cause hypocrites - they burn quite easily, wow Burn and pillage it all to the ground Your illegitimate king lost his crown  Animal flow Show no mercy under my rule I won't be kind, I will be cruel Drown all my foes in a paddling pool Yes, I'm tyrannical bro, so Never mistake a man for a fool I'll take your ignorance right back to school And teach you a lesson for testing my cool  (Animal) (Animal) Dum-dah Dum-dah Dum (Animal)
Wait...whaaaat? Brilliant doesn't begin to describe what I just watched (3 times so far) We need a new word...anyone?....anyone?....
Love you Ren
How do you make it full-bodied song filled with so many different sound with just your voice and guitar is madness.  I  though it will be MUCH  less similar to the studio version! Amazing...
Amazing Balls !!!! Love it !!!
This guy put a bit of a dis spin on Hi Ren. Doesn't really like to be one of those people that agrees with everybody. I think that's why has a hard time not so pre-judging so much. Anyways, this is his link to his review of Hi Ren, My first reactioner in history that I almost didn't subscribe to.  https://youtu.be/fQmr0oY38Rw Maybe we need to give him some love or maybe he listened the song again today and got it...Figured something out on his own. 🎉😮😅
True Genius doesn't need to hide behind Production
Awesome, simply awesome
I still sung the Nomnomnomnomnomnom part😂
I love this song, but the idiots of the world will use it as an anthem to storm capitals.
Holy!!!! crazy dude!
👍
Thanks 4 the share. ❤
Vocals on this are incredible. Sounds like I’m sat on the bus with you.
love that you kept in the ending, it just makes it even more authentic than it already is 💚
<3
As soon as I started playing this our shop dog came sauntering into the break room lol
Dude that was awesome!  Didn't know how you'd have done this acoustic, but wow, you more than pulled it off.  Also didn't realize how dissonant the harmonies were under lyrics and melody either, especially during the bridge.  I love this even more now!
My God...all Ren needs is his acoustic guitar & his own GENIUS...🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 everytime
Last night I was listening to your music in my dreams. Live long and prosper and take care of yourself because you and your music makes my life better. Thank you.
Fucking fantastic La 👏🙌👏🙌👏 boom bah da diggity dah
Man.... Cmon. You can't do this to us :D Amazing work again :D
Daaaaaaaamn, Ren.  Freaking LOVED that accoustic!  That was amazing!
There is something so primal but also dynamic and theatrical about everything you do Ren. I hope you keep making music for a long-ass time bro, I'm here for the long haul!!
This is so good, didnt know how you would do this acoustic, but it was amazing!
Keep it just in case...akin to selling or giving away an item that you discover years later was worth a small fortune.  Feel free to pass any of your rejects my way!!  Seriously, thank you for persevering through all those dark days and sharing your music.  You are a blessing.
Yeah.  Like this.  Pretty damn good.
That was great man. Discovered your music a few months ago and been putting my mates and family onto your tunes . My dad is now a big fan of yours, thanks for the amazing art you make!
Always love it, ren! I'll be here every song and this is just another incredible one.
Best video yet, keep it, fking awesome..
Amazing Ren. I've played guitar for 38 years and damn man you just blew me away..love it!!! Your skills are incredible.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes i am, Yes i am, Yes i am always makes me think of Sylvia Plath and The Bell Jar.
This was amazing and I am so excited to hear such a stripped down version.
Excellent bro!
This was incredible!! A different sinister quality is illicited by the intimacy of it.
Wow Ren.  THANK YOU for every bit of your hard work that led to your music!  XOXOXX  You deserve all the accolades you get!   Better get use to it! XOXOX
I actually love the ending mess up! im glad he kept this version
Brilliant! Gives the piece a whole new vibe 👏 👏 👏  x
Greeeeeaaat🎉🎉🎉
Love a guitar player on public transport!
I laughed and laughed and laughed like a giddy idiot at this.
SweeT 🤌 …
This was sick boi ... sorry I'm that guy. Seriously this was really funky version of a track that was already massively funky. And that's funky as in funk as in Sly and the Family Stone funk.
I'm sooo impressed with this version, this man does magic when he sings, no matter if recorded or live 😲 HOW he is pronouncing every word with so much power! Pure magic, no snake oil, this is real 🌻
Holy f*ck this is AMAZING!!! Better than the studio version.  Real raw unedited truth from Ren's MIND, from Ren's Fingers, from Ren's SOUL, from Ren's  MOUTH directly into our ears our minds our souls & our hearts. This is artistry on a whole other level. I've been around for 5 decades, but I've never seen or heard anything like this. Ren, thank you for BEING
This is brilliant and on the bus 😂
Ren; what a cool name that is, what a cool guy he is. He's something else. I'm Renovated.
Superb Ren. Never fail to surprise us.
This is so dissonant and chaotic in a way…but it works! I LOVE IT!!!! Mind blown! Ren did it again.
OMG!!!!! Ren!!!!! Absolutely beautiful ❤🥰🐷🐰🦊🐸🦁🐱🐯
The ending cracked me up. Thank you Ne Ren
All the cool kids sit at the back of the bus.
Your amazing Ren 👏
yum yum yum yum yum I want to hear Korn cover this
Brilliant. I added the "yumyumyumyums" myself :-)
Love the acoustic!!! Just like I said bout the other video … I love the beatboxin and I think it even better on this track unplugged sounds awesome… keep on keepin on SIR!!! 🐝🖤🐝🔥🐝🧩🐝🏴‍☠️🐝☀️♾️
Tom Waits jr...
It´s good you guys kept this take "just in case". ✌
Awesome! 😮 Loved the guitar part 👏 l liked this version more. The lyrics were more impactful.
Ren my dude, I watched the original and thought it was a banger! 1 hour in from this one being released and you've already got 25k views....you are 100% going places. Keep up the good work!
Fucking Hell, Ren you are a spark that is ready to become a raging inferno with as much talent that you have. Studio or Acoustic, verbally Animal Flow sounds identical.
Unbelievable I preferred that version,Ren you've a next level human being/animal
🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely amazing! Pure genius to be able to do this… Just one man and one guitar and one bus😂 Brilliant!
For crying out loud Ren m8!! That was flipping incredible! I had no idea how you would do an acoustic version of this. I should have known better. Give Ren his guitar and anything is possible. Prefer this version. Love it!!👍
How the fuck !!!!     Genius !!!
Oh I love it, I love that it nearly didn’t make the cut, and that you kept this as the 1 you chose to release, I love that you was trying hard not to laugh during the performance, I love everything about it 👍🏻💪💯
One hour ago and 8.5k likes. Popular or what?! 😂 Love it 😍
Absolutely LOVE you, Ren!!  ❤
Ren is a Celtic beast!
Live the only way to be !!
Ha ha ha...awesome buddy. What bus was that, the 42?😂
Yep. Class. Preferred it to the original. Play on bro, play on!
Right now I feel like it's not as good as the video, but I'm sure it's cause I'm not used to hearing it, while the video version I probably listened to 50 times already 😂 it's like when I found the album versions of "Chalk Outlines" and "How to Be Me", the added music is really good, but I had already fallen in love so much with the rawness of the live versions I honestly keep listening to those! One thing's for sure though: I still have to hear something you put out and not like it, and I bet all I have that it will never happen. You and music together becomes beautiful magic every single time. Thanks for sharing your talent with us, lots of love from Switzerland 🖤
This was lovely.
i like this version more tbh great job
This is amazing my friend!!🔥🔥 ✌🏻🤟🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Yes!!!!!! Mate!!! Ridiculous!
Let's run him up liked and shared  ❤
Jesus. Astonishing.
i feel like you'd make a great moriarty
Awesome job!
Fire Ren ur so SiC! 😊
Menos mal que apareciste. Eres el puto Rey mi niño
Can't help but think how good it would be to have Ren as the minstrel in The Witcher games or series. Enjoying all your content.
awesome !! this is exactly what AI will never be able to produce ! music by a human being …
Masterpiece ❤
That was just as good as the original, if not even better Ren.. love the little riffs you put into it man, sick 🤙🏼 🦁
'fuck  that was realy good one.. let's just keep it. just in case i must slit a throat' . .
Just so absolutely incredible!!
Bet it's going to hit a million within 72 hrs Son🎉🎉🎭🔥🔥🔥✊
Eerily good i think I prefer this version, very different. Feels more unhinged as though the madness has in fact bubbled under the skin. My only question is, Is this  in B minor ? 😆 💛
Hi Ren!!!! ❤❤❤❤ Jeannie in Lakeport California USA      GREAT JOB!!!!
You can do no wrong.  Keep going man.
Ren this has given me goosebumps. My fiancé who just passed away was exactly like this... very eerily coincidental 😢😢😢
Bruh, omg this acoustic version is fire. I love your brain.
The  combination with the acoustic guitar  and rythem  and rap  it's totally brilliant  !! As always  I will listen to this  many many  many times  , so original  so honest , love it to bits  !!
More good, fella. Cheers.
...but some are more equal than others.  Love this version just a little bit more than the original (I'm an acoustic junkie), so I had to expand upon your Animal Farm reference.
I love love love this. Fantastic ❤ I like it even better than the studio version. Thank you for this treat
Sick
Amazing 😍
Oh my god…………
Fire! Also props to your videographer!
"Let's keep it... Just in case😂" 3:24 Yeah, just in case it's absolutely freaking phenomenal!
too much!
indeed, that was a good one. ✌
Wizardry! You are such a clever man x
You are on another level man, you deserve EVERYTHING coming your way. Please don’t stop being you or releasing your incredible art.
You're not just an animal, you are a beast
This kid murders every time
I love the way the camera can't stay still, it has to go with the flow
Just brilliant and such a great alternative watch.
Wow man so well made I love it Like  Share  Comment Repeat  Well done Ren this is freaking amazing 👏 🙌 👌
You are such a great performer . Ya made this so good.
Sheesh. Hadn't a clue how you were going to make the work but I knew you would. You're a phenomenon. Don't change a thing 🔥🔥🔥
Ren + guitar =  genius
The greatest new artist for years! Mind-blowing how even more powerful this is when it's stripped back to voice and guitar...
Amazing!!
Yet again blowing my bloody socks of with sheer talent and genius.
He's the busking Bus-King.
Capoooooo....muy capo. Genio!
Let's get this unique, amazing artist to 1 million subscribers plus!!❤
Excellent performance dude, 🤘
Awesome move to keep this one, you know this isn't perfection you/we need. Raw talent 💪
I love your acoustic versions for sure.....perhaps more than the "studio stuff" ....but then again, sometimes the things I say are irrational :-)
💗💗💗
Is it wrong that I like the acoustic version of this even more!? I'm just going to say, no.
Simply Amazing.
Just Genius... Fantastic...  Love that your wearing an... "animal skin on your shoulder"... too!
Am I the only one that likes this acoustic version better than the original?  This is excellent in it's simplicity, perfect in it's delivery.  Top Notch!
I've been playing guitar for almost 40 years now and I have no idea what you were doing on yours during this rendition. Absolutely mind-blowing. I literally cannot get enough of what you do, bro. You are such an inspiration. I'm fairly certain the Labels must be knocking on your door again right now, but Please remain independent. Don't let those Soul-Suckers entice you into giving up your complete and total creative control. No matter what they offer, it is not worth giving up what you have. Please mate. We need you just as you are.
Outstanding mate!!
I could sit and listen to you, play the guitar and sing all day long in all night long
Ren the bus-king
You ARE a fuckin animal bro. X
My mind just automatically says "yum yum yum yum yum" and my hands doing the wednesday dance... Amazing! Wonderful! Beautiful! Phenomenal!
I like this version better
I saw a comment saying they don't know how the hell you're going to pull off an acoustic to this song.... Well, not only did you did but you created something brand new. This was absolutely amazing! I don't know what I like. Better... You performing acoustically live or with all the extra sounds. It's really a toss-up because you're absolutely brilliant
Oh my word.  that's really rather very good.
Done Live on a bus in Brighton 🔥🔥👏👏
Ha ha ha get in there bro!!!
Damn! That was as good as  the recorded version!
This is outstanding! you ma Dude
Never seen talent like it!! Proper genius
Bruh! Okay that was fucking wild! I actually like this better than the video version!
Almost like watching yet another Peter Sellers movie thinking you've seen it all and then BAM! It's borderline comical how you never fail to deliver.
Good stuff!
Where's the double double plus plus button... ^^ 👍
#crownren  I WILL see this live one day 🙏
Damn, bro!!  Is anything that you do NOT amazing?!?!  ❤
Brilliant!
What a fun surprise to happen upon today!  Love you so much!
The best songs work in their pared down version because this is how they were born.  Absolutely brilliant.
Yes! More acoustic guitar! This is what drew me to Ren.
For me, this harkens back to something you alluded to in the Justin Hawkins interview, when you talked about your fastidiousness in the studio - your obsessive perfectionism when putting everything together - only to have the audience prefer the live takes.  I wonder, does that in-studio fastidiousness help with the quality of the live performance, as you're adapting from such a heavily-worked foundation, or is it an added burden as there's so much more you have to strip away to get to something playable at the back of a bus?
King
I will learn it  with my spanish guitar :)
I don’t believe it, well, I guess I got to, I’m looking right at it. Somehow Ren played animal flow on an acoustic guitar and it’s just as good 🤯🤯🤯
This should be the definitive version of AF from this day on.
Oh, crying laughing at that ending... none can bring down the King of the Jungle like a bus turning a corner...!!! :D Awesome, awesome, awesome performance!!!!
Loved this - felt darker with the guitar somehow 🔥🔥 bluesy- nice one Ren!!
Ren - taking BUS•king to the next level! 😂  This was a lot of fun.  You give such an animated performance.  It is an amazing thing to behold.  Keep up the great work.
Bardcore 2.0!
genius 😮
That "WAS a really good one"! Class!
F****** incredible Ren! I'm fixing to share this with about 500 people🌿💔
Quality dude, again ❤
"Keep it, just in case." Genius!
Banging
That was amazing!
Brilliant soul. Thank you for sharing. Thank you for giving so much of yourself to the world without being asked. I hope it helps heal a part of you as it does all of us.❤✌️  Also, I love the acoustic releases you've done. Be proud of all your hard work. 🫡 take care, Ren!
Powerful!
Mate this is cooler than Antarctica😎haha love the realness at the end too😂
OMG it’s better than before. It lays bare the tyranny lorded over us by our corporate overlords.
Please Ren publish something that i hate. Me, being an old man (61), it feels not normal to be a fan like I am know. At this age idolizing musicians feels not the way to go. Bur I can't help myself and it's all your fault. You being so brilliant..
Sounded pretty good to me Ren 🙏👍🤗
Wait---are you riding in a BUS?!   Actually prefer this to official video. . .   especially the transport voice at the end: "This bus terminates.  All change please."  Weirdly apropos.
Awesome - you can come and play on my bus anytime.
Damn that was good.
Sick bro .
Cool AF
Omg Ren That was sooo Awesome!!!! You are all I’m listening to man! I’m so looking forward to more of your content!! Amazing job!!
Ah-mazing! I expect zebra pants to go with that top in concert 😂
🦁👍
Awesome man!!!! Much support from Canada!!!
The chord is an E5 which you kinda play an E minor but then move to a Eminor7 mainly based around an Eminor7! Do I win? 🎉😂😅❤❤❤❤ It’s amazing by the way
The timing and vibe of the bus information is perfect!   You're incredible! 👏
Amazing! Anyone know the chords for this? 🐝🧒
every time i think i couldn't be more impressed than i was by the last ren thing, i'm even more impressed by the next ren thing. this is just utterly fantastic. (and i am a sucker for reworkings and different versions of songs....this just ticks all the boxes. ren, always be you. this is superlative.)
Crazy good!!
I was so curious how you were going to pull this off and it was so fucking epic!!! Lost nothing by stripping it back to pure vocals and guitar… in fact I actually think you improved it if that’s possible!!! I love it when it’s just you and a guitar… so bloody brilliant.  Can’t wait to see you live when you feel ready to tour.  You killed it! 🖤🔥🖤🔥🖤
Young man your words flow like an intoxication just makes one need to listen. Words have a literal power of life of death. Keep flowing life, your generation needs you. An Elder.
Is that B minor?
Man be looking like Tommy Shelby from peaky blinders, and rapping like a god. I cant be only one seeing this shit 😂🎉
Ren, the unapologetic Peaky fckin Blinder of our time! :) <3
You got amazing skills! Great music!
Absolutely amazing I don't know what version is better they are both so incredible ❤❤
im asking myself the whole time if you just randomly recorded in a bus or if you hired a bus driver to drive you around! It’s probably the former but i always ask myself in all of your videos if you just start walking down the high street and it all works out or if you hire actors… I asked myself that with bitter sweet symphony as a kid too 😂
Very fucking cool.  Thanks for being real Ren, the world needs your music, stay independent, stay strong.
The already unsettling song got even creepier.
Savage animal! Lessgooo!
What's the chord after Bm though?
this is me, rapping along to the original version of animal flow XD
I wasn't sure how I'd feel about this version, Ren, but again you have knocked it out of the park!  I broadened a few more horizons yesterday by introducing more friends to your music.  I am happy to say that they are now believers, as well...
I love this version sooo much. I'm a huge fan of all your "voice plus guitar" style tracks. Thanks a lot Ren !
Just incase anyone wonders. The bus company is hiring. Good luck to all applicants. And, nice one Ren. Awesome acoustic version.
Imagine being the bus driver
Damn that's good!
This was really well done, it transposed to Acoustic Live much better than I could have imagined !!! Thanks REN. I am looking forward to your live acoustic version of "FIRE" from "Freckled Angels". I've had a blast going back through your catalog and 'discovering' gems.  "FIRE" is on high repeat in my daily listening right now.  A wicked banger.        ❤❤❤
Phenomenal ❤
Jesus you are just ridiculous Ren.  This is absolute insanity.  I an SO glad I found you
Lessssgoo
I'm fucking speechless. Turns out this was a blues all along...
So who else said "Yum yum yum" in their head?
Mars Rover
Amazing. Fantastic. Brilliant. Very impressed. Two thumbs up from Orlando, Florida!
I still get amazed with the sounds you pull from an acoustic guitar. Dope rendition.
Imagine getting onto a random bus and Ren is just there chilling with his guitar
Quite the masterpiece Ren. Lovin it.
Phenomenal work Ren! I also thought the end was funny! Did the bus turn really sharply and knock the camera angle off balance or something?
So good bro! Love how you just keep giving and giving and giving to us! Bless you brother! 👌🤌🤙🔥❤️
That breakdown was wicked.
❤❤❤
I love this guy! ❤❤
Sick!
This is magical....
That is......I'm speachless.....you're one of the best performer i've ever seen. The last time i felt this way i was in front of Tom Yorke.
Absolutely brilliant Ren ❤
The legend. The king.
Man what a legend. Back of da bus and all. Love the bts bit right at the end, authentic as always. You make it look so easy but I hope everyone knows how incredibly difficult what you are doing is rapping and playing like that. And of course the arrangement/performance nuances present in the live vs. the original. And the one take thing. Bravo Ren - you never fail to impress man!! Thanks for raising the bar!
Of course it’s amazing. Of course it’s different and cool. Love the vibe you went with. You’re a legend, bro.
Your talent is absolutely amazing
Sitting here just smh and grinning like an idiot😂 fucking A man!
Ha ha ha! Did you plan the length of that journey between certain stops ?  Brilliant!  And the rendition : riveting, slighlty shocking but strangely beautiful as always.....
Loved it.......We had to interrupt Brighton v Newcastle to watch this. Definitely worth it. Big question is what number bus was it? Sure someone will know
So many feelings. Thank you! 💕
Love this version
Jeez! 18k views in less than an hour! Loved how different that was.  Who was driving the bus?
Wooooowwwwww
Loved the studio version, but this one sounds  a lot more raw.  Have to try this as workout music, feels like a nice tempo for interval cardio :D
I can almost see him sitting on side of a bed right in the song
Wait.   You just played that entire song on guitar.  It's all in one key and one basic cord.   Wtf?  How do you do that?   You literally made that magical.   Thank you!
I don’t know how you can do his stuff man. You’re the GOAT in my eyes brother! No better musician out there. Much love from Oregon, USA.
Yesssss. This is such tribal soul foood.. Supreme love ❤
Wow, man, Ren you are something special mate! Outstanding ryhmes with sick flow! Your guitar skills are sublime! I can't wait to hear your next release! Good luck with everything buddy!
Disturbingly so good 😂
Brilliant, just blew my mind again! Your in a class of your own your originality is a breath of fresh air and a gift to the world of music. Wish you all the best with your treatment Ren, cheers 👌🎼
Holy hell man….  You’re amazing dude.  Just keep getting better and better it’s insane. Love this so much
The chord slaps
XXX
excellent and you look really well ❤
You always amaze ❤
This man’s legacy has already been set! Thankful we are here to witness this, in real time.  🦄
Just yes😊
Nice
Brilliant! I hope you didn't miss your stop mate. 😜
Straight 🔥🖤 killin it as per usual
Finally a notification I wanted to see. Let's get Ren to 1 million subscribers he deserves nothing less. 1of a kind
Mint
I discovered you a few months ago, And I’m just crazy about your music. You have your universe and I just love it. ❤️
Well Hell ... wasn't that just bloody brilliant !!!! you are on fire young man 🤩
Bro! Trying to figure out how you didn't run out of breathe through that. Awesome performance👍👍
I'm 100% sure that this is not just Bm...
I am so sorry, that in the '70s , when I was young, Ren it wasn't on the bus going to ski on the alps with us. It would have been a trip!
Consider me fully absorbed into the phenomenon that is Ren!  Absolutely bloody brilliant.
CLASS ❤❤❤❤
Bloody brilliant
Fire!
Man, that’s good.
absolute pure genius, so much talent and skill....love it!!!!
Thank You, my ears like it alot more...have a good one Ren
Wow! I didn’t know that Tommy Shelby is so good at singing! 😮
I knew this would be good, simply because it's YOU, but it even blew my high expectations out of the water! The production on the original was so great and so vital to the track, I couldn't figure out how you would make a stripped-back version work. But of course I should've remembered, there's nothing you can't nail just with your voice! 😂 And your performances are just mesmerising! You always put everything into them, the nuances of your voice and your facial expressions really are second to none. Thanks for giving us two flawless versions of this awesome track!
🔥🔥🔥
you flow like lava, keep it up
Mate, you're ridiculous. Putting out these single shot videos with perfect performances like it's nothing. Leave some talent for the rest of us, ffs.
Fuckin crazyyy bro 🔥🔥🔥 ELITE ELITE 💪💪💪
More piano, please? Or might that be too much for the world to handle? You have made the world more beautiful.
This was insanely impressive! I couldn't think of how this song would be acoustic, but I like it just as much as the original! The fact that you can do this all live shows your such incredible talent. Hope you're getting well, my brother! 🎉
That was awesome! We even got a little extra at the end! You are sooooo talented and I am glad I'm here listening to you in real time! Thank you Ren! 🖤💚
Badassery yo.❤❤❤❤🤜🏼🤛🏼👏🏼👏🏼🫶🫶👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 Big fan of your career and music in texa,usa.
"Let's keep it just in case..." As much as I appreciate the "Animal Flow" MV, I actually prefer this one. Who knew that an acoustic guitar and a voice, with no studio juicing, could hit this hard? This is the "Animal Flow" that's going in my playlist. For me, it has excellent repeat play capacity. Thanks for saving this take to be released while you're away getting treatment ❤🎵
Just when you think music has got nowhere to go,....Along comes Ren,...Bard to the Bone,...
So amazing. I love this so much!!!
Ren, your facial expressions are something else 😍 👍😘
Mmmm average and annoying
This is so goood Ren! What a great performance. Let me just go rewatch that for the third time! 😊❤
Brooooo! This was EXACTLY what I was hoping for! Sick rendition... Would love to hear a retake of this version with a full band and lots of distortion! Don't stop doing what you're doing! Much love 🤘
Brilliant 👏 👏
I was expecting the best and still you surprised me, masterfully done sir.
Wow just simple wow amazing live and acoustic 😮
Gonna be honest, not my thing really. But I'm still sat here watching because I do play guitar and I find it fascinating to watch what you're doing. So it's not my thing, but it is my thing because here I am enjoying it? Doesnt make sense but I love what you're doing.
Shit yeah @Renmakesmusic ! It’s gonna be sick live! Lots of base and suspense! Please hire me to do wild stunts all around you! ❤ 🔥 🎶 buhpow! 🎉
🔥🔥🔥👌 perfect ending 🚌😉
So amazing. Your talent is amazing.
Just landed and this is the first thing I'm listening to 😂 🔥🔥🔥.  Okay, I had a little more time between landing and takeoff than expected, so I can expand my comments: I love the vocalizations, the guitar of course, and the overall eerie vibes of this Ren-dition. Absolute fire. 💛
Anyone else addicted to watching all the reaction videos to watch people's faces when discovering him for the first time? I can't stop. It's literally my obsession rn.
Yes he’s an ANIMAL a legitimate king get him a crown!  Stay blessed Ren. ☝🏼❤️🤜🏼
Most Excellent Ren, loved this big time🙏🏼✊🙌🙌🙌
You need to come to bournemouth bro seeing this live would be sooooo good ❤
I hope many good things come your way my brother!! 🙏   I love how you inject your personality into everything - I haven’t listened to music in a long time, you are so refreshing!!
Absolutely ridiculous amount of talent.
Was it a Bm tho?
Acoustic version is by far my fav!! You have such energy and grit!!! Fk'ing fantastic brother! 🔥👊🇨🇦👍🔥
Cant believe i get to hear it again and again! Such theater! Can't  tell me that wasn't  planned like that😂😂😂❤❤❤😂😂
Superb maestro… superb🦊
Ren is the 🐐! Sick internet with the all might Knox Hill. Can't wait him to react to this or How to Be Me. Ren, you're the guy! Let's go!
Call me a genius but I think this is in B minor
Talent level 1000 😂 Brilliant ✌️
The Bard strikes again. Great performance and SUPERB guitar skills! Greetings from Brazil!  🐒🐱🦊🦝🐶🐷
so glad i watched this, just shows how the music stands up, just a guy and his guitar :D
Love you thanks for entertaining us
Awesome. Love this live version. You can tell a great artist when a live version brings something extra. Hat tip sir 👌👍
Haha considering this is a live play version I really like the ending vs if you finished it "properly" ❤️
WAIT! Was that REALLY you Ren, or A.I?
Blimey Ren. 🔥🥂
How has he done that on a bus? Wtf! 👌
It’s your time mate. You’ve got this!
Watching this masterpiece over and over again
I actually think I prefer it in acoustic!
Fucking beautiful.
Holy fucking shit!!😮😮😮
Awesome my dude - you look identical to Cillian Murphy... You two may have been separated at birth.
Thanks for keeping it just in case!
This is so damn good, I don't even know what to say!  The guitar playing reminds me of Robert Fripp (King Crimson) crossed with Gentle Giant, and I'm blown away.  The intensity not only matches the original video but surpasses it! 😳🦁
Beautiful!
My God. It's like a new song, completely different, u'r amazing Ren, fire performance 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this song !!!!
Brilliant! no other words needed.
The breathwork to pull this off! Damn!
Hell yeah that was awesome! Reminds me back in the day when a band would releases Single & with like a B-side and a acoustic version
Yes Ren!
You are an absolute genius Bruv your music is  CRAZY FUCKIN SEND IT BRUVA!!!!!!
Beautifully done Ren
Your presence is absolutely mesmerizing!
That was next level
LOL - What is wrong with you? How can you enjoy what you do so much?  It's contagious - please don't stop.
Class
Loved it!!! Thank you!!!!!
Really cool! 👌🏼😎
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉  Tappin to the silent phonetic beat kinda went emoji overboard
This freaking guy, he inspires me to play better and he makes me wanna smash my guitar (Clash Style) at the same time.
Extraordinary. Proof positive that all the cool kids sit at the back of the bus.
This is cillian Murphy if he followed his patient🎉
Blimey Ren, is there anything you cant do? Meanwhile, keep doing what you are doing, bringing so much fun and joy to us all.
I love to these single takes with just you and a guitar. It's very impressive and such a contrast to the increasingly over-produced music industry. Personally I'd like to see all artists perform in a bus like this.
Ren your songs are fire bro. keep up that great work man peace love happiness  . i can't what to the next music video Ren.
Thank you for making Orwell fiction again!
You never cease to impress brother. Keep flowin bro. Cheers!
sexy
Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.  Love you bro.
I love this ride....every song is its own ride and I finally feel excited about music again
Chair dancing away lol. Love love love love love love it ❣️
🔥
This is bloody fantastic. I absolutely love it. It's raw, which adds to the whole animal flow! <3
Awesome! I love how you kept the ending in. Just beat the announcement!
Bruh!!!!🔥🔥
Rock on Ren! 😎🔥
Erm hello excuse me cpuld you leave some talent for the rest of us please 🤣🤣.  Great accustic rendition 👏👏👏
As much as I liked the original version, I thought this was better. Loved it 🙂
That was magnificent
Damn!
love this shit man. pulling an acoustic off the wall right now to learn those chunky riffs.  honestly, you have that funky bones nature, similar to Les Claypool (I'd pay good money to see you cover some Primus) only you continue to elevate every genre you touch pal. you are completely unique and an absolute gem ❤️  never stop making music mate.
I love that you used that take, makes an already genuine feeling video even more genuine
I fucking hate how good this kid is.. So good
Amazing!!!
Wow... Too much talent for one young man. haha Amazing Ren.  Keep on Rising and don't stop mate. Out of interest, from a fellow film maker perspective... how many takes? haha (Only ask due to your final comment)
Uugghh😭I missed the premier!!  You did really good though from the video of it 🤗(Kermit hands) I like the acoustic just as much as the video.  (I had no doubt I would!)  Peace and love always until there is no more!😊❤
Absolutely fucking stunning work Ren. So glad I found your music
I absolutely love this song, I love all your songs really I recently discovered your music with the trilogy, it made me cry it was so beautiful Then I jumped to hi ren and from there I went through a majority of your catalogue  I would have never thought animal flow would have worked with acoustics But damn somehow you make it work  Absolutely love the work, you've inspired me to keep trying to create my own stuff  Not create it for fame or numbers But to create because that's what we're built to do
Just freakin awesome Ren!  You never disappoint!
Ever since I heard Hi Ren, I took a deep dive into your music and The Big Push and I have to say with all the variety there is not one song that isn't amazing. No idea how it took this long for you to start blowing up but I'm glad you did. If no one told you today you are an absolute legend.
Always Tony the tiger. RENS GGGGGRRRREEEEAAAAATTTTTTT
I can quite honestly say it has been a long time since I have been so invested in any artist as much as I have for you Ren. I am genuinely excited whenever I see anything new on my feed, you are a breath of fresh air my brother
Yup....brilliant...bravo
wow!
I like this version more but that's because I love your acoustic stuff 😊
That was awesomeness. I can't wait to see what other stuff you've been working on.
Damn, that was impressive. 👏
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THE ENNNNND !!!!!!!!! Loveeeeeeeeeee
Brilliant!
I miss the yum yum yum yum yum. Modern songs need more yum yum yum yum yum.
Holy cow.
Ren with an acoustic guitar is The Bard Beast
I was almost nervous for you, wondering how you're were going to pull off this song with just an acoustic. I should know better at this point. That was so unique and outstanding. Killer rendition and performance, man!
Waited all day for this then got visitors at 7.30 , had to listen to it in the loo at 8 so I could get some peace to enjoy it 😂 wasn't disappointed I love it
bravo. that was spectacular.
❤❤i love it more than the video and i LOVED the video! Soooo cool with just you and the guitar and  the bus . I always knew this about the boys in the back of the bus!
Hang on, that's not a bm 😊
Love this.  To be on that bus..
Different vibe to it, can’t choose, love both versions 👏👏👏 both delicious!
15 years ago I gave up on new music I kept listening to old tunes but thanks to Ren I have hope for new good music 🙏 Ren is the real deal
Whooosh! Actually prefer this to the original! Ren is not from this planet!
Cool lyrics.  the window behind says PEOPLE LIKE YOU
Fucking fire bro! 🔥
Amazing. Would sound cool in a big band arrangement too.
So good! Love that you used this version!❤
*VIRTUOSO!!!*  I name you virtuoso, Ren. I feel lucky to hear your music and witness your talent. Thank you!! 🎶🔥💖🙏🏼🤗😎
Very nice, thank you
Very interesting choice to do your live on public transportation. Love it. Amazing job as always. I really enjoyed it.
The instrumental in this version seem to be inspired by Pantera’s Walk! Is that just me ?
Brilliant. Made me smile a lot ❤
WOW man... Just, WOW 🤘🤘🤘
Damn! What the hell you're doing to the guitar?! 😯 This is fantastic, completely new dimension of that song 👌
I just recently discovered your music and i can't thank you enough for putting it out for world. It has touched me in a way no other music in my life has or could. I love you Ren. You are my brother for life 💙
Wouldn’t be surprisedIf you end up with an Oscar, Grammy and Tony award
Four legs good, Two legs bad.....................
It's like a different song. The vibe is somehow even more animalistic, especially the "Mary had a little lamb" piece. Powerful.
🔥🔥🔥 *PERFECT!* 🔥🔥🔥
This is amazing. Of course ren is just chilling on a bus with his guitair why wouldnt he be 😂😂
That was awesome ❤
Glad you kept it 😮
This grooves! I wasn't sure how you'd do an acoustic version of a song that is so much about the bass. Great version though.
Soooo gooooood!!!❤❤❤
GG bro
Incredible! my guy is the goat 🐐
Gosh. That's good
I am SOOOOo impressed! I had no idea how you were going to translate Animal Flow to acoustic. This was fabulous. Also...love the ending!
Unreal talent xoxoxoxox
OMG! Icant type to well because of my   auto condition so sorry for. any typos but wanted to say... I don't plan an instrument  , but I know when something or someone has the "it" factor and you do!  Cant wait to see how far you go. xoxo RENA '
brilliant!!!
🔥🔥🔥
Incredible! Seriously, done on a bus? I think this live performance  impressed me even more than the video. That was some gnarly guitar playing. Bm got rode hard and put away wet!
Why is this so good? ❤
Ren does it again!
Love this...
I couldn’t fathom how this would work acoustic but here we are. That was brilliant! I should have known you’d knock it out of the park. Thanks again for everything Ren. Hope treatments are going well.
Great acoustic performance Ren! Was this recorded on a Brighton bus?
That was awesome.  Thank you.  It blows my mind how creative you and your team are.
Love this version, you cant beat ren rapping over an a oustic guitar.  And the timing, to get it done right before the announcement that the bus was about to reach its final stop, wow.
Raw, powerful and intense delivery. Mesmerising to watch the video of you performing Animal 'live' and acoustic. Maybe more impactful than the studio version! Blown away, thank you.
Absolutely love your live versions
Keep it just in case 😂 dude yeah it was a pretty good one dripping talent right there 🔥Just got the bus-king pun, i'm dead
True BUS King
❤🔥🔥🔥
I'm a sucker for acoustic versions of songs and I LOVE how good Animal Flow sounds on acoustic!!! Great job as always, you're just so damn talented and always smash it whatever you do! You deserve all the best ♥
So sick!!!
Mate, love your playing.. I mean: your guitar playing is super... and unplugged the song opens so may scenarios... it sounds so metal in some way... so inspiring...
You're mindblowing❤.  You're timimg is impeccable. Thank you so much for sharing this with us ❤❤
“Ren… dropping another banger”   “Again?”  “Again and again”
Genius !
Kill it, bubba!!! Shine as you deserve!💯❤️🔥
Yes laaad
blooming brilliant! youre an amazing wordsmith!
Favorite version
❤ Love it!
Amazing again
I feel like it sounds like bun dem skrillex & damien Marley  Specially ren's mouth beats !
Brilliant! Your live version seems to transform the song somehow 👏
The pups plums 🍒❤
This was even more fun than I thought it would be.
i need this jacket and the sweater sam is wearing in the power video. and yes, I will combine both, no matter what you say.  btw. is there a greater challenge than making animal flow work acoustically? Let's find one 😈
I actually like this version more than the music video version. Loved the music video version, but there is a lot happening in the video that distracts, so this stripped down version really gives the lyrics a lot of punch.
So, uh, yeah. It's settled. Ren isn't human. Every night he unzips his human skin suit and watches Loose Women reruns while writing songs made to blow our minds. Dammit you're awesome bro.
I enjoyed the original, I loved this one
amazing, loved it. the bus driver was in his seat just thinking what the f*** is going on up there?? I don't get paid enough to deal with this s***!! but also at the same time just nodding along.
🙌 Legitimate King 👑
You genius!  I knew you could pull it off ,  it’s almost hypnotic,  horrible and wonderful……. ❤❤❤
Became a fan since "hi Ren". Keep the flow man. You are awesome musician !
This was amazing. You've somehow managed to add even more emotion to this song.
❤
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS :)
THE BARD!!!!!
How the fuck do you do it?  Keep it, just in case.
Well done Son 👏
I just noticed, nice touch with the animal print 🐆
i couldnt imagine how this was going to be done on acoustic, but you fecking smashed it again.
That's Animal & I've 🔪🐀🐁
Aw, Ren...this was amazing!!
Love the original but this is much more interesting. 👍
11,000 views in 18 mins. Ren, I am ALLL IN on the RENassaince from all of us RENegades!
That was fire 🔥
*mind blown*
Awesome!!😂
❤❤❤
Your live performances are extra captivating! 🎉❤
Incredible
Sooooo good xxx Always great
You are a musical MacGyver, Ren!  You make anything work and make it appear effortless.  Thank you!
This might be bigger than the original. 👍
💘💘💘
I gotta say... I LOVE the way that ended. ❤ Ren... you're incredible. That was a treat. Be well, good sir.
As always imperfectly perfect and perfectly imperfect, perfect. :D
I prefer this to the released version. (Just being honest). Would be good to hear with serious gain....Keep up the good work!
Kin’ A
Hell yeah! ♥
🙌 YES
This is beautiful!!!! A whole different vibe but amazing!!
Fun Ren, another facet of your talented self. Hope your treatment is going well. I suffer from several autoimmune diseases & mental health issues so I feel your pain & frustration, hang on in there.❤
Amazing!
AMAZING
❤thank you❤
I was thinking that a metal version would be great since the first time I heard the song, and here we go...
Rawrrrr!  Thank you, Ren!  ❤
Simply amazing !! And what about the camera details wow
I seriously love you man your art is just awesomeness
Next stop - Legendville
The animal farm reference in the description 👌  Also absolutely LOVE this version ❤
As much as I love the original.... I think I like this arrangement better.
Fucking insane
That was a very bluesy RENdition. Glad to see you are looking better and enjoying life sir, keep on keeping on.
I love that you kept in the ending bit with who I assume to be the driver.
Ren is metalhead approved 🤘🏻🤘🏻
Brilliantly done! Flawless. I love these acoustic versions of your rap songs. Keep going👌💪🔥
Love this so much!!!!
Hot cats man x
Mate, you're a genius. I can't get enough of your music. Long may it continue 👏🙏
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I'm a new fan,  found you from Hi Ren , your music is fn fire.
Thank-you.. keep your bright light shining!!
Love ❤
Just amazing talent and sounded so great. Looks like on the late bus in brighton!!
I'm always how you manage to make these one take live playing songs even better than the full production ones. Not better... It just highlights it's actual talent. Not production tricks
That was fantastic live ren thank you  you've made this lady happy today. Hope you are doing well. Take care ❤
5 in the morning, a lady in Australia sits before work, intently watching the flow CEO, spit about slitting throats and burning shit down... Thanks Ren. I'm ready to gooo! 🤣
This raw performance is even better than the studio version, so talented
A fucking treat as always! I'll be blaming you tho if people catch me making weird sounds either at work or in the streets when I inevitably listen to this on repeat 😆
I loved it Ren, just wish I was there to see it live. Hopefully one day you’ll be touring and you’ll come back to Anglesey for a one off concert mate that would be fantastic. Wishing you well in your continued recovery. Rich formerly from Dwyran but now from Llangoed near Beaumaris. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
This version goes hard. 10/10
Yeah good one 👍
Needs more cowbell.  😁
You were ready to keep going... you don't even sound out of breath at the end... "lungs of steal" I'm mad its over lol
You can pick brother
Beast.
Love it. Amazing live performance to add to collection. 🤟
Hell ya!
Lol at "We're hiring people like you" on the bus window
I knew you wouldn’t disappoint. Ren, that was animal!!! Love your work bro 👊

Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum! ✌🏼
That sounded great 👍
Brilliant! just like you Ren! Keep shinning your beautiful light. Much Love from Ottawa,Canada💋❤
Brilliant as always.  Cheers! - Anna J Walner
Other people on the bus: "Who is this guy and why is he so scary!?" 😜 no but seriously, I love this version! Good work Ren
I had no idea how you were going to turn it into an acoustic version, but never in a million years would I have thought you could make it sound like acoustic metal 🤘 I love it. You are a very, very rare talent.
Amazing as usual 🥰 Moving mountains, he is!!!!
Top top class bro so impressed by your talent..huge fan and I wish you every success!..
I love this even more than the original...brilliant
Just awesome!! I like it even better than the original
@renmakesmusic DID I HEAR BRIGHTON STATION?! Ren man if you're in town you gotta say. Ill Drop everything if you are doing something live
Unreal, have no words
Wow! Great version of Animal Flow!! Love the setting and the acoustic. Your talents seem to know no limits! As always, I hope things are going well for you Ren.
there need to be invented new words for this genie ...
Another top notch performance. Thx man for the great work. 👍
wtf is the bus driver thinking??
Thanks Ren.
My mind is blown 🤯 no words needed your work speeks for itself 🔥
I hope one day to meet you or see you live ❤ love from Minnesota USA

Bloody incredible! It's million times better than I could ever expect and I had pretty high expectations 😂  Love you bro, keep going and wish you all the good in the world
I love how it’s on the back of a bus!
How?? Just like.... HOW?! 🤯
Thats FUnky amazing. Like always, The Ren
loved it. time to listen to it 1 million times. thanks ren ❤
Hi Ren "All change please"
I really thought that Ren would walk on the bus and among the passengers there are people in animal masks hahaha Fiiiireee!!!!
Wow. Just wow. And the “Mary had a little lamb” part is so good acoustic. This is disgusting and I love it.
FIRE 🔥
That was amazing 🥰🥰
That was goddamn amazing 🙌🙌🙌
Amazing, thank you so much !!
I said it before, I'll say it again. Ren, thank you for giving me Music back.
Love it!! Had me dancing the kitty dance haha 🤣 that's what I call it. Those three beautiful kitties that sit on the washer and dryer.. threw in the yum Yums in there too.Did my part!! 😂
Haha love it, so close at the end there 😂 brilliant.
Love from New Zealand.  Brilliant and Funny Ren.  Just what we needed after the crappy Annual Budget was announced yesterday. 😮😂
Let's keep it just in case! Yes, let's do!  Really beautiful all stripped down and raw. Ren, your talent knows no bounds and its so fun to watch.  Would love to see more of these if and when you choose to do so. Take care of yourself - the world needs more Ren!
Ren be out there BUSking   😁
No cats paws for the live performance, the claws were out and raw!  Phenomenal performance.  The coolest kids always sit at the back of the bus.
At one point I was holding my breath…waiting for you to take a breath!!
Ok the middle section where he started playing the ascending discords was genius. Love that kinda stuff. Amazing version!!
Brilliant. Simply Brilliant
It’s so nice seeing this space grow bigger and bigger.
Once again, I'm highly impressed, Ren. Yes, you're an animal!
Plan B did it 😉
Incredible version! Two one-shots, two versions. Epic song!
This is insanely good
1 like = 100 likes!!
Thanks Brilliant!
I knew this will be 💥🔥💥🔥
That's such a fun version! I think im still more drawn to the dark and insane vibe of the original, but this version with the funky guitar seems to be somehow even more catchy! Amazing work!
Ren  it sounds amazing live …never disappointed …   true artist… sending love 💕
That's witchcraft right there my friends😂 Love this version even more than the original!! Absolute fire Ren!
RESPECT & LUV to you Ren. #StaySafe #StayStrong💪🏿💯
Mind-blowingly impressive as always !
I like this one but also like the other one bloody brilliant love it
I wanted to roar every few seconds. Brilliantly done. You created an animal energy...not sure how else to put it. My heart is still pounding.
🙌
Another amazing one. Love your live versions. Keep it up bro. All the best man and God bless you and your work.
Awww!!! That was so close!! That was pretty amazing!! I realized that you need no musical instruments... Your voice does it all!! Love you!!!
🤘🔥
But how did he learn the chords?
Damn that is sick...keep doing your thing little brother
Thah was awesome !  I dropped out a pretty important meating to rush home and be live with you dear Ren.  Thanks, you're a genius. xxx
Grammys cancelled just post it all to brighton ffs unreal
Whoa .... outstanding.
THIS IS BLOODY AMAZING- SUCH TALENT AND SKILL.
Shared already man....Romain's cool
1:23 Wait, you said 'The Lord of the Rings'. Now you've done it. They're going to get you for Copyright Claim 😛
Awesome
You'll go down in history for starting a new genre of musical art - an actual feeling of a complete person to person experience.  Call it the From Me To You Direct Transfer genre.  So many of us "feel" you because you immerse all of our senses at once.  Bravo again.
WHYYY didn't I get notified for the live
Goddam buses!  I was just thinking you've done well not to have any sudden braking or swerving by the bus driver then whammo!
My cat took the opportunity to barf on my bed during this premier, which seems appropriate. 😂
Stripped down version seems so much darker thematically and I'm here for it. ❤
Effing brilliant version!
Bminor! 😂
That throat graah at 0:30 is probably the most satisfying sound I've heard in all my life
Wow this is something else... bravo 👏 this is to good! 🔥
Fucking love this!
Love this version too 🥰🥰🥰
How many takes Ren 🤣 I wanna know!
I think I’m pure filth…..phallic bus seats noticed !! 😮
Ren, you animal!
Such tasteful licks and harmonics! Damn, this was dope AF!......"keep it...... just in case" :)
Doing this live brought this song to LIFE!
Waaaaahhoooooo! 😀😀😀
That was absolutely brilliant.
Since I subbed to your channel last night, you've gained over 4000 subs. Overnight. Wow.your just amazing keep em flowing ❤❤
The Book Club will add this recording to the Archives immediately! ❤‍🔥
Wow 😳

I think I like this more than the studio version. You are just incredible, dude.
Amazing.....🔥🔥💪

That was great, now get off the bus!! Can't wait till June. Last thing I poured myself into was a pair of skinny jeans in the 80's! Hope you're keeping well 🤗
As usual,  greatness
YES BROTHER!!! BLUESY FIRE!!!!
Yewwwww
Pure artistry! Somehow superior to the original.

REN, you are the most exciting musical artist I have heard in years. Your honestly and integrity are so refreshing and your videos are so imaginative and well done.  I wish you all the success you undoubtedly deserve and I look forward to seeing what you do in the future.  Please keep doing what you’re doing, it’s f@*king awesome!!!
say when bard Ren
Thats the best bus ride I've been on in long time. Bless you.
🤘🤘❤❤💯💯
mate, i hope your treatment is going well, it feels like the whole world is discovering and getting into your refreshing take on music, your messages are impactful and real, respect my man, stay strong.
I loved it, and the end made me giggle happily. So much energy, so much life, so much beauty in this mixture of perfection and imperfection.
This is fucking amazinggggg!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you! Thank you!  Thank you for promoting literacy and reality, one bar at a time. Stay independent, this IS the year of the indy artists!
Wow that was impressive. I wasnt sure how it would be pulled off live but that was awesome.
Amazing as always!!! The jacket is perfect 🤑
How did you make this song even cooler?? You are an Animal, no doubt! 🤘
Subscribe...lets get Ren to 2 million!
Ren goes Meshuggah on the rythm! damn! <3
How do you do that?
That was awesome
Great to hear it stripped back, felt darker and more sinister in places for having fewer distractions. Fascinating how different the experience can be when it's raw like that - even if you did finish a bit prematurely. 😉
The amount of people being able to play this because you've done this version is going to be incredible ❤
This is Epic i prefer it to the original, the Dude is a Genius
Fire 🔥🔥🔥
🐷🐮🦝🦊🐰🐭🐼🐨🐻‍❄️🐻🐺🐯....All hail the Animal King!
Love it. I feel really lucky that I got to watch it live:)
🔥🔥🔥
🎉👍🤗
Live 🤗 letsss go!
Yes I Like!
Wow amazing
Dude!!! You are amazing!! This is incredible!! You leave me floored, every time!
I think I love this version more (see you after 100 listens though, I will make my final decision then)
Holy shit, that was ace. I wasnt sure how you'd pull it off without the drumbeat. Brilliant!
ABSOLUTELY AN AMAZING VERSION thank you ren you indeed never piss i mean miss
Fabulous 🌪️🎶🌪️
sir. This was a masterpiss. Thank you. Love from tha fellow renChordian. Also it was in D -chord , naw just kiddin. It was byuutiful. *
Banger. The musical hero of 2023 does it again and keeps doing it...
Another gem youve dropped on us 😊 Kin loved it Ren. Going by the live chat we all did the yum yum yums, shit loads of backing singers 😂 we rocked it 😂
Amazing! ✌️🖤
Love it, thank you ❤😺❤😻❤
Glad you kept it!! it's lit!!! you made it look easier than it was, you killed it ren!!! Nice one!
Don't let them corrupt you bro. Be true to yourself. You're a gift to the world.
Loved it
How can 1 person have all the talent? Ren you're greedy! 🔥🔥🔥
Loved it❤
Thanks.   New release announced June 8th.
It shouldn’t work but somehow it does!
😱 New track June 8th!!! 😵 Can't wait!!!!! 😁🤘🏻
Damn, I loved animal flow when it came out, but this stripped down version might be my favorite
This Train terminates here reminds me of the time I ended up in Hillingdon headed for Romford.
Wow, I think I prefer this live version to the video!
✌️
Holy shit!! 🤯🤯
Brilliant 🔥🔥👍❤❤❤❤
Great job keep it up don't Ren away from us😊❤
Keep it, just in case...
love it live!
That was dope as rope, looking forward to the next release on June 8th.
THESE FUCKING BARS MAN....holy shit...
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oooh, I hate it when I'm afflicted with Bus Interruptus 😃
I no longer have words, the deeper I dig the more incredulous I feel.
Wow, that was fantastic! Amazing breath control.  Thanks so much for performing this fir all of us. Much thanks to your crew also.
Great primiere 🎵🎤🎸🥁🎵, really enjoyed it, peace and positivity to everyone.🔥🔥🔥
Freakin fantastic... you're such a gift to us all... so glad I'm alive to witness your talent and ability to bring so many together through your work! Thank you Ren! 💚
Doong Dah! Doong Dah! Doong Dah!  - AWESOME!
That was brilliant.  I love your guitarplay and the beatboxing was great.  I just missed the "yumyumyumyumyum"s ❤
It’s confirmed.  I do nothing well.
Holy, what a friggen journey! Amazing. 😀👏👏👏👏👏 Thank you 🙏 Greets from Sweden.
My lord …
This is good 🔥🔥
Very cool.  I did miss my favorite line ("YUMYUMYUM") though!
Badass dude.
Brilliant!! Personally, I prefer this to the recorded version. You cannot beat Ren with a guitar. This is where he shines the most. Love it
How the hell did you get permission to record that on a bus enroute? 😂. Terrific 😃
Never in all my years did I think I'd be so entranced by just a man and his guitar.... WOW... AGAIN!
That was freaking awesome🎉🎉🎉
wearing the skins to cover your sins ;)
Ren your litterly just amazing 😍
That was awesome!!!
Love you Bro
let's count down to the reactions to appear... how long?
What a cool way to  start the morning!! Cheers Ren 😀
I'm definitely gonna have to work on my Bminor...... Seriously though, that was f***ing great.
I think I might like this version better if that’s possible.
Love it. My new favourite artist. Just found you recently . Im so glad i did. Thankyou ren, heres to health and happiness. xxx
Ren cheated. Played more notes than b minor 😡😂
Dammit I thought this had a Bm chord in it. I've been playing it wrong...
Keep it... Just in case! F'n glad you did buddy! Amazing
I just love you! Enough said. (Glad you're healthy)
killed it and kept it real as always.
Ending was the best 😂
Who reacted to this first? We did 😂

Ren I cant express enough , the honor it is to hear your music.  I have heard much music in my life, but what you do is beyond anything I have known. I go down rabbit hole here on you tube. Not only have I seen all your videos, I also seen every persons reaction to your videos lol.  Your a beast man.  A true work of art.  God Bless, I wish you the best.  Be careful of the bad shit in life, and the bad people.  Cant wait to hear more of you music.  Also come to the USA :D

Such an awesome community (cult, if you like) of love and appreciation of your talent and humanity, Ren!
🍿🍿🍿
CAlled my friends, gonna be 40 minutes late, I don't care... Gotta see this asap
You are the like the Ryan Upchurch of Britain!! We found you a couple weeks ago and have been listening ever since 💥👏🏻🔥💜
Ren ren ren reeeeeennnnnn

Love that jacket! Animal skins, over my shoulders like bling They will be clothing my sins I came to win, over and over again
Will this be added to Spotify later?
Please do Jeff Buckley cover...Grace sometimes.That will be epic.
This battle will be legendary!!🐼🐯
im here for it
Anticipation Is Making Me  Wait…  Can someone sell some time to this clock so we can watch this already?!
Bro the way you string things together and the places you pick with he perfect acoustics always blows my mind! Can't wait to see how you did this masterpiece!
Have fun Ren, shut down the monsters for all of us.
Remember it's Bm..
Just gonna sit here for an hour and 5 mins waiting patiently because well adhd. The min i turn it over and do something else i will miss it lol.
Cant fucking wait. Such a banger of a tune.
So excited to see you slay it once again. You are such an inspiration ❤
Ever been asked the old "If you could have dinner with any person, living or dead, who would you pick" question?  My answer has recently changed to Ren and saying so made me feel like such a fanboy.  Still, I choose to lend what little support my lone voice has, despite being self conscious about being obsessed in my 30s like I only remember feeling as a teenager.  This man puts himself out there, I can be real back. I dig this human, his music and his incredible brain.
Popcorn at the ready   SMASH THAT LIKE 👍👍👍
Well now that im here i ain't leaving till i hear it, spent some time and went through all your music stuff i could find and you never cease to amaze me, love you and what you're doing man keep being awsome <3
Love and support from California❤❤❤
Nephew I wont be home from work by then but I will watch thanks for the heads up ❤  Know it will be awesome  You entered my life 4 days ago and I'm  digging through the back catalog currently introducing  you to my family has been a blast❤❤ you're  in my prayers young man keep your head up.... one love.
Oooh c'mon 8pm, got the whole fam waiting for this one 😁
Legend
I already know that this is going to be the highlight of this otherwise sorry day (mild flu, having to work on a holiday, good ol' anxiety) Gotta count our blessings ❤
The anticipation is cutting me like a knife cut a cake 🎂
Have a feeling this is gonna be as far removed from the video version as you can get.
Ren is the Tyler Durden of music!!!!
Let’s go indeed - will be 5am Australian time -and ready for me morning coffee   Let’s get it Ren!!!!!!
VAaaaaamooooossss. REN. !!!!!!
Love ur lives so much.
Already know this is going to be class
RIP Ian Curtis

I suggest we all buy animal masks to feel a part of the live event lol
Ren, could you please do another recording of "Patience" ? There is a video of you from years back on some one else channel performing it  and would love to hear it get some new life or if there is another version you have that I missed,  please point me in that direction.

Here’s JJ!!!! Hahaha let’s go!!
What a time to be alive. It's a privilege to share the earth with a true genius of our time. Next time someone says "kids these days," or "what's become of the world," Imma show em Ren.
Wait what? Holy fuck.😮
So Exciting 🤗🤗🤗

Dude you have bought colours to my  life. Your talent is immense and I wait with baited breath  to see you put in another masterclass.  No pressure like.😊
Can't wait to hear this live version !! I don't know how you will manage to put an acoustic twist on this banger but I am quite certain it won't disappoint (to say the least)
REEEEEEEEEEEENNNNN--you sound more insane than I do!
~ 🔥 ~
Remember Ren, Bm Bm Bm Bm....

Let’s gooooo Ren. Legend 💪🇮🇪
Yo REN! Traveling to Banff and Calgary from Portland (yuck) this summer. No chance you’ll perform anywhere…at all….? I’ll watch you order paleo food! ♥️ lol. You introduced me to a ton of new music. You were my gateway drug…
lessssssgoooooo!
In your other post when you said someone asked for a live of Animal Flow and basically too bad you hadnt thought of that I immediately freaked out because of course, Ren can do anything and thinks of everything!!!
I’m so excited to see how this is done! I’m sure he won’t disappoint.
Let’s go 🔥🔥🔥🔥
F happy, man!
Love the picture. Are you about to fret a Bm?
Hahahahahahahahahah yessssssssss ahhahahahahahahah
Oooh Renny I'm so sooo flipping excited, boo🎉❤
Give that Bm chord some stick 😁😁
Dear Ren I must say that you're hitting us with masterpieces! Can't wait for this one to drop! I'm listening to your songs every day, all day, and every time I'm discovering something new, hidden somewhere inside the lyrics or the music or the video! You're so precise in what you're creating that everything inside a song seems to be surgically put there by you, fitting like a glove! Hope that you're feeling better and better each day!
Still need that Collab Ren with Knox hill two talented lyricists on one track would be mind blowing can't wait for this live go ren  👊👊
let's all pray to god he remembers the chords!!!!!!!!
Good luck with that one brother?!? 😂 can’t picture how this is going to go down, regardless I’m all in. See you in 24 hours…
🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸
You are such a joy and you leave joy like little footprints everywhere.
You are too good to us man 😂😂 I cant wait for this 🔥🔥🔥
Urgh I’ll be at work 💔💀

You're ability to flip and strip these songs that don't seem like they could work acoustically is amazing.  Can't wait to see how you do this one!
Class act - I can't wait. Thank you.
I come from the future to tell you all, this is breathtakingly amazing.
Anglesey will be listening 🔥🔥🔥
Feel like a proper Ren nerd now, well into this and a fucking Renstore too? 100% getting me a creepy pig!
I've been practicing my Willy Wonka cane walk just for this eventuality. Cat paws at the ready everyone!!!
Stabbed the bell thing👍with me mouse😂
I will be jittery and a proper fidget, for 27hrs😉 What a treat. I'm sure he will give this performance his all. And it will be one that that will go down in musical history. So happy I will be here in that moment in time to witness this, even if its on the YT.  C'mon Ren! What a charming champ. Greetings from the UK.
Cannot wait 😭😭😭
Dang it!! Everytime I'm still at work 😢. Watch later it is! Lol
Cant wait!
Dang it, I have a meeting then 😭
Is it going to be in Bm? Lol... Looking forward to it. :D
Yay! I found Ren a few days ago and have fallen down a magnificent rabbit hole of art, music, and emotions.
Ren, you are a diamond! You listen to your fans, and then gift them with what they want almost instantly.   I am an old man, a music fan my whole life, but never have I seen or experienced such an incredible connection between an artist and their fans.   Leaving aside your awe-inspiring artistry; your honesty, integrity and almost brutal intelligence have already left an indelible mark upon me, many of my friends/family, and , clearly, MILLIONS of others.  PLEASE just keep doing what you are doing.
Hell yeah!!  Been watching the interviews & loving the insights my brother.  Thanks for not only putting your art out there, but also yourself as well.  I hope you continue to do what you love for many, many years to come; you've earned every second of it.
I can't wait, the live versions always hit differently lol
OHOHO!
You are too kind to us Ren.
Notifications ON!!! 👍👍
Ren, I can't imagine how the hell you're going to pull off an acoustic version of this song but I'm betting you won't disappoint. 😁
I'm always here early to show up late❤️ can't wait for this setting a second alarm so I definitely don't miss this one #Ren
Staring down 900K. Niiiiiiice.
Ready and waiting Ren you are Amazing ❤❤❤
RENNNNNN stop releasing on Thursdays...I work 😂😂😂😂 I'll have to record my reaction late again 😂😂😂  Looking forward to it mate!!!
You look like Tommy Shelby in that picture. Is us watching this livestream an order from the peaky blinders? 😂
YAY - i already know im going to love it!

I will support you no matter what.
I can't wait !   I promised myself that I will start doing something with myself even though I'm stuck in bed. Like a lot. You are motivation. Thank you.  Also I hope I don't seem like psychofan liking and commenting a bit everywhere 🙈 I'm (relatively) normal. I just have a lot of painfull but free time and as I discovered you only about a week ago, I got excited. But I promise I'm just a regular sick girl.
Whoohoo!!
Hells yea ,lets get it .

Is that the back of a bus?   I wouldn't mind sitting for 4 hours on a bus if this is where public transport is headed.
I got my dog to push the notification bell to keep with theme of the song
Usually I go to bed at this time (well yes I'm old! 🤣) but when you do a premiere! there, all exemptions are allowed 👍🔥💥 Love from France

Ren.  If you are still in Calgary beginning of July, then why are you not on the coca-cola stage during the stampede!?!!?
Looking sooo forward for this.. Also, I know it would be difficult but a live version of Hi Ren would be perfect
Wow! I'm looking forward to this.
