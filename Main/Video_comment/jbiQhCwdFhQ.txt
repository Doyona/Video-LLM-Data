3:35-4:09   Well, to be fair, Melissa did warn you about this.
Sai da câmera da minha frente
they don't anything
1:57 whys this guy sound so proper lol.
Raj isn’t even in this video and he’s still in the thumbnail 😂
2:49
I absolutely hate smug chefs like Coleen. They think they know everything yet somehow don’t know the first thing about cooking
Amongst the many things wrong with Colleen, I’m so baffled by her asking if Chef Gordon Ramsay would like her to “get (him) a bite”. Like did you see the other contestants offer to hand feed the chef?
What going I have no idea get out hay come here u get out and one more thing get out 😂 👆
Malissa needs to sort out her damn hair it looks a mess omfg  Hasn't she heard of a hair brush and making her hair look tidy by putting it in a pretty braid
The editing of steam on that spaghetti pasta 🤣🤣 Chef is holding it without a problem but we’re supposed to believe it’s steaming hot after being pulled from the trash
"I teach manners too chef"  So you have chosen death..
I just noticed something. Regarding Andrea... Basically. Gordon kicks her out because she doesn't know this order even though it was repeated: 2 Wellington, 2 Chicken, 1 Lamb, 1 Dory. With John Phillipe's encouragement, she comes back with Ramsay asking her about the order that is going. And she says: 2 Chicken, 2 Lamb, 1 Wellington, 1 Dori. She gets accepted back into the kitchen. Like... What??
Charges $100/h for cookery lessons but can’t even boil pasta. 🤡
I will never forget the duck breast that turned into the saddest pork chop I've ever seen.
That couple Smelled What The Rock Was Cookin'!
That shows Gordon is not just being an A- Hole. As soon as she got that order spot on he sent her right back to her station!
Wouldn't have been great if Gordon said after this dish I need a choline cleanse
Surprised Andrea had that breakdown, walked back in, recited the order, and got to work Slay
It’s a ducks breast You can tell it’s a duck breast because of the way it is
1:23 "One Wellington's Medium, the rest is fucking _Nor-MAL!_ Unlike us!"  Still one of my favourite quips
Colleen is the biggest fraud I've ever seen anywhere, tv or real life. Hopefully she has crashed and burned by now.
0:31 Gordon: "2 wellington, 2 chicken, 1 lamb, 1 dory...  (Moments later kicks Andrea out) (Andrea returns seconds later)  Gordon: "What's going out?" Andrea: "2 chicken, 2 lamb, 1 wellington, 1 dory"   Gordon: "Thank you" 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Pretty funny how Andrea came back saying the wrong order (she said two lamb and one welly while its the other way around) but Gordon didn't notice or let it slide
I Love that guy in that black suit. Always there for moral support. 🙂
That freshly engaged couple looks as plain and dry as that duck breast
The sexual tension Is insane
Bro the fact that the duck was just sat there in the middle of the plate with nothing. I can’t 😂
Andrea was not as good as she thought
3:32 BRAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaah I thought that was just a loaf of breead, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   its a CHICKEN!!!!!
Colleen: I’m a lot older than most of these kids so I’m not quite as nervous about criticism Colleen in the previous clip: *I teach manners too, Chef*
Coleen. Is that a little foreshadowing for a medical procedure?!
Jean Philippe is the best
I’m so glad Jennifer got kicked off the show in the All-Star season against the young bucks!
hey hey you get here.... fuck off. idk hy i find that so funny
1:32 “Aye, c’mere you …………………..            FUCK OFF!!’ -Gordon Ramsay
Did no one notice that Andrea didn't even get the order right the last time... it was 2 wellies not 2 lamb; 2 wellies, 2 chicken, 1 lamb 1 dory
JP deserves an award for the numerous times he's been supportive to these chefs, he's saved so many from getting ejected or walking out, he's a hero with a heart of gold ❤️
We all know who the worst chefs are, but they can speak for themselves 😆
4:47 Colleen  5:58
When Ramsay ask you what's going I'm wondering why they're still cooking since they're not catching the order Ramsay calls out. Especially the garnish station. Garnish station has to be up 30 seconds before meat, fish, & appetizer stations. Andrea is just cooking things and not even sure if that's what she's suppose to be cooking, wasting food. Even after Ramsay repeated it she still didn't know lol just like Jeremy S11. Loved the way Ramsay says "one fucking dory" like he's so disappointment.
That duck really looked like bread
That duck really looked like bread
That duck really looked like bread
Colleen seriously asked Gordan is he wanted to be fed by her 😂
3:30 crying 😂
1:26
That duck looks like a squished loaf of bread
I need all the seasons for this
They think that's tough. Imagine getting yelled at by more than one Drill Sergeant in boot.
3:33 THERE IS JUST A SINGLE PIECE OF MEATT, IM DYINGG 😆😆😫😫😫😫
And still Andrea found it wrong (two chicken, two lamb, one wellington, one Dory instead of two wellington one lamb)
Colline is a “ bruh “
The amazing thing about the duck breast was they didn't even cook it well.  One thing on the plate and it was cooked to leather
5:42 Colleen learns the Golden Rule of Hell's Kitchen: Never Talk back to Gordon!
I'm surprised Gordon didn't force the ladies to eat that overcooked duck, in front of the bride and groom to be.
It’s American tv it’s all staged because they are all full of shite
Uhhhh right.
JP is like the mother of the group, he's so amazing and kind
JP going after Andrea to give her a pep talk and encourage her to get back in the kitchen is one of my favourite moments ever.
It never fails. Anyone who says they can take criticism and aren't going to cry/give up/get angry can in fact not take any criticism. Anyone who says they are a great chef and know what they are doing will screw up royally.
What cracks me up the most is that raj is in the thumbnail but not in the video.
"Describe the dish" "It's a duck breast" 😂😂😂
I can't stop cracking up at Jen revealing the dish, only to see the saddest, driest piece of meat ever just placed on the middle of the plate 😂😂😂
2:45 she went back in there to repeat the order, she still didn't get the order right, but Gordon missed it as well lol lucky for her.
Is it just me or the order calling is inefficient because it's too fast to comprehend? I mean if he tries to call it slower and  clearer it would be understood and remembered better.
Sure thing its extremely stressing and all that but being like "OF COURSE I WANT THIS!!! This is the most important thing to me rn, I want it with every fibre of my being. " and not preparing yourself before entering this show by practicing memorizing things under pressure is just unprofessional, she couldnt even memorize a few simple menu items... Its stressing as hell in HK, agreed, but fcking hell you knew that before hand, PREPARE FOR THE SHOW!
Can anyone give context behind the duck breast situation?
1
That chicken breast😂😂😂😂😂😂. The most pathetic dish. I am crying laughing
You know Raj made history when everyone’s talking about him even though he’s not even in the video.
brush your hair and put it up.
She Said She Allso Teaches Manners 🤣  Sounds Like We Need Joseph Back To Get Into Ramsey's Face Again & Set Him Straight
1:19 - 2 Wellington - 2 chicken - 1 lamb - 1 dori 2:46 - 2 chicken - 2 lamb - 1 Wellington - 1 dori She still gets it wrong
Did anyone else catch that Andrea said the wrong order when she came back?
Am I the only one who has a really hard time remembering those orders? He calls them out quickly, I can't imagine trying to keep that in my head while working. Why can't it just be up on a screen?
Raj is the type of guy who would pop a corn and think he made pop corn
Dude..that half over cook piece of meat shit got me rolling.🤣... She should've just tossed it on the table..congratulations mother fuckers ,come get you some..😂😈
Now we have Colleen being Melinda #2
I like team bonnie and team man because you all very good people
andre the hells kitchen shreck
“That’s a duck breast…..”  That cameraman knew better 😭😭😭
Ramsay is the master of creative insults and swearing. When I was young I used to work in an office with a swear box - put in a coin for every time you swore. I used to just upend my purse and pour in the coins once a week. That cured my swearing. At work anyway. If Ramsay used that system in Hell's Kitchen, the swear box would overflow within an hour. He's the god of swearing.
Jean Philippe is a legend.
“I thought the cold water would boil faster than hot water chef”      “Whaaaaaaaaatttt”
Andrea complaining about communication where she can't register the order in her head.
300 dollars for 3 to 4 hrs by someone whose not even a trained professionals chef that seems like a scam
JP the absolute chad of encouragement
Can they invest in some monitors with the orders 😆
6:25 Gordon casually grabbing some pipin hot spaghetti
At 3:32 WTF was that?! LMAO
I actually think it's much harder than it seems to instantly repeat back the orders when you're already multi-tasking. I'm surprised more mistakes don't happen. They could probably come up with a better system.
The worst chef moments can speak for themselves, they know who they are.
Poor Jen. She was the sacrificial lamb to Melissa's sabotage
The duck dish was a classic. Gordon silently cursing out the red team was brilliant
Seriously Andrea, you can't remember 6 items??? Open your ears and listen!
Who’s cooked the diapers?
Andrea still got it wrong tho ahahah
Damn the door tho?!
I teach manners as well Chef, health bar appears over Gordon.
"I can take criticism," on this show seems to equate to "i ignore criticism, and dont try to improve."
1:19 - The right order 2 Wellington 2 Chicken 1 Lamb 1 John Dory 2:46 - Andrea still gets it wrong 2 Chicken 2 Lamb 1 Wellington 1 John Dory
Mommy Jean Phillipe 😳🥺
Jen: today we have a very dry duck breast served on a very fancy china plate. Please enjoy
I love that Andrea still gets the order wrong when she comes back but Gordon let her back anyway.
I still crack up seeing all that spaghetti. I don't even know why, it's just funny
Good for Andreya
I teach manners to chef,that hit my soul🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who cooked that duck breast
Finally JP lost his virginity :D Good for him :D
How did Jen taking the spaghetti out of the trash not make this list
Hated Colleen man omfg
Raj and Colleen constantly calling the other competitors “kids” is so fucking condescending
Wth is the backstory behind the duck breast? How did they manage to cook that shit?  I can do better with my hands tied
"I teach manners too chef." *_Ma'am._*  I respect the balls on that lady (though all the repsect is immediately lost, considering where she is and what Gordon wants from his top Chefs)
its amazing how women when upset my ramsey say DONT CRY DONT CRY ,lol, if ramsey went off at me i would just start laughing , lol i wouldnt be upset at all, if i started laughing he would probably just get more angry at me ,lol
Raj is 🅿️
"Thats a duck breast."      "...uhh"  This is the stuff exam stress dreams are made of.
Ah Colleen... I'm still shaking my head.
I don't see how people face expressions aren't memes yet when Gordon Ramsay curses someone out 💀
Colleen well upset your Coloneen with her shitty food
God bless you all 🙏
Raj is so bad, he's not even here and people are still talking about him
why do they bawl? They know what theyre in for walking into this when they applied to be contestants, everyone knows Ramsey has a mouth & that its fowl, don't sign up to be in the kitchen if you can't take the heat, simple as that
What kind of hair is that, melissa?
2:45 bruh SHE STILL GOT IT WRONG
Raj is the type of guy that goes to the drive-in theater just to see “closed for the winter”
Brilliant pep talk by Jean Phillipe.
Brought to you by lamb souce
Bro wtf “ would you like me to give you a bite?” WHO TF SAYS THAT
Andrea one of the softest to ever be on the show. Pathetic
ngl, the "I teach manners too" line was fucking badass
Y'all ever think about how Hell's kitchen is the Danganronpa of cooking shows.
That "duck breast" looked like a Hot Pocket... I'm broke. That's what I saw...
Gotta hand it to *Corrine*, she went down swingin'...
Being a chef will break you... I've seen ppl pick up cigarette habits behind working in a kitchen
Raj reminds me of Kung Fu Panda.
Ingredients for lamb sauce by Gordon Ramsay  Nobody knows cuz I can’t find it!!!!!!!!!
Gordon can’t locate the lamb sauce  👁👁    👃    👄
4:30 I’ve always loved how they still try the duck breast. Like they’re gonna be like “oh shit. actually, this is delicious”
Rock is a beast!
4:09 You don't get to be deeply embarrassed Gordon, you're the one that super insisted they open that lid. They tried to warn you. Thats on you.
He's really toned down in the last few years...
He is better than lots of dads so it's like a piece of cake of them
idk why no one points out that she still gets the ticket wrong when she comes back lol 1:18 2:45
I literally CRIED for MINUTES after the ladies uncovered that duck breast! 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀. How anyone kept a straight face during that shit is beyond me!
Look I'm not saying it's not a funny picture but how many times are you going to use that image of Raj lmao
2:46 She still said it wrong tho. It´s two Wellington, two chicken, one lamb, one fucking dorry. One Wellington´s medium and the rest is fucking normal.
Melissa looks like a witch
I still can't believe Matt made it to the black chefs
I am impressed at how amid all that chaos, with everyone shouting different orders, Gordan still remembered the original ticket and did not have to look at it again.
Love how Andrea still fucked the order up in the end
3:33 I laughed so hard the whole area could hear it. 😂😂😂😂😂
This was hard to watch but funny at the same time
JP is the true star of the show
Ik the cooking part is hard but she couldnt think of 4 meals that was told to her 5 times no wonder she got kicked out 2:16
Nobody:  Gordon: *grabs boiling hot spaghetti out of trash with bare hand*
Coleen - "I am older than these kids so i can take criticizm" Also Coleen - *calls out Gordon's manners when he says her signature dish is bad*
LOL, F bomb in the first second
Would you like me to get you a bite? HOLY SMOKES LADY. STOP.
The basic rules of Hell's Kitchen: 1. Don't be overconfident 2. Be able to take charge 3. Don't have an attitude or talk back 4. Be willing to learn, don't stick to old techniques 5. Communication skills 6. Be able to cook lamb, wellington, pasta and risotto (or any other famous dishes) 7. Quick reaction time 8. Good memory 9. Don't make enemies with your own team 10. Always tell Gordon the truth, no matter how scared you are
4:37 POV (that look on you) : You are dead
“The rest is FUCKING NORMAL,unlike us”
I simp for jean phillipe he is best boy.
If the chefs think that once they win Hell’s Kitchen the pressures off and they’ll get an easy high salary they’re delusional
If the Blue team has spaghetti Josh, then the red team has spaghetti scammer Coleen
Chef Gordon ask collean if she wants $300 when she starts telling people how to cook 😂😂😂
Jean-Philippe is a bro.
Jean Phillip is so supportive and sweet!!
Aww JP, love that guy
I wanted to go through the screen and comb the hell out of Melissa's dam hair! Why did they let her do that?? I wouldn't have wanted to eat anything she made!!!🤢😱🤮🤢🤮🤢😡🤬
JP is so wholesome
2:45 did anyone else notice she still got it wrong?
Melissa, there's a new invention you should look into,  It's called a ponytail holder.
JP consoling Andrea is one of my favourite moments of him
Where’s the lamb SAUCEEE
2 chicken 1 lamb 1 dory
On GOD...i have yet to meet someone who dislikes Jean Phillip...spelling prolly wrong but still!! Love him
He sounds like the substitute teacher from spongebob “ no eating in my classroom” 🤣🤣🤣
"that's a duck breast"  Yes, it is.
Andrea has to be one of the worst chefs ever
2:46 she still said it wrong lmao
Gordon Ramsay says to people at Hell’s Kitchen season 5, “Two Wellington, two chicken, one lamb, one fucking dory!”
Finally got cured from herpes after using Dr.ademise herbal treatment and i didn't even have to change my diet while using his medication
Don’t take the Lords name in vain.. using Gods name as a filth word to express disgust is one of the most ungrateful and evil things anyone can do, we don’t do this with anyone ones else’s name.
at 3:40 dose anyone know what  Season this is
Gordon so mean
This girl pisses me off
Woow the old woman needs to go back to the home she run away from
This Show honestly this is just fucking stupid I would never put myself in such a situation
3:17 The bride looks so pretty
Rock: "All the pressure's on me."  Little did he know xD
"Jen, describe your dish." "That's a duck breast." Lmfao
I know Ramsey only acts like a tough drill sergeant in the kitchen to toughen you up and he never means the things he says, but sometimes you need someone who is positive and supportive like JP to keep you going.
Colleen and Josh should open a pasta house together
0:57 If Gordon was a member of One Direction
Gordon: "2 wellington, 2 chicken, 1 lamb, 1 dory"...  *Andrea walks back* Gordon: "Right what's going?" Andrea: "2 chicken, 2 lamb, 1 wellington, 1 dory" Gordon" "Great, get back in the kitchen"  lol
Every day I love Jean Phillipe a little more
I beg your f***ing pardon? 300 dollars for 3 hours of cooking? Absolutely criminal! You are not a trained chef but you teach people how to cook, when you can't even cook a simple meal yourself? ...  .........  F**K OFF....GET OUT!!
I love how COLLEEN is probably never had another cooking client after this show 😂😂😂
3:33 this scene plays like it's from the office
Anyone else notice that Andrea still got the order wrong? The order was Two Chicken, Two Wellington, One Lamb, One Dori.   But when she came back she said, "Two Chicken, two lamb, one Wellington, one dori."   Even Gordon Ramsay was so done at this point!
R A J
"I am not so nervous about criticism" Gordon : **spits food** Coleen : I t e a c h  M a n n e r s  t o o  c h e f
Raj is the kung-fu panda of hells kitchen that's why he legendary 🙌
JP is a real G!
How did no one laugh when the dome opened to a duck breast, I would’ve been in tears
Colleen and Josh both have a spaghetti fetish. Change my mind.
Idk why but when he threw the napkin over the duck I busted up laughing he didn’t even wanna look at it
Giga chad Jean Phillipe
Mrs. Manners has her own YT channel. She has a clip of her showing the "I have manners too, chef" clip to a group of people. I forgot the channel name, though
Just the silent "uuuuumm..." Jen gave while struggling to describe the duck breast, is priceless.
I wish I had my own little Jean Phillipe
Everyone needs a JP in their life.
How far did Tom make it?
What did Melissa think she was going to accomplish, trying to tell Jen not to send the duck? Was the duck just going to suddenly turn into a gourmet dish if she left it under the dome a minute longer?
*duck*
3:33 The fact that Gordon sounds more confused than pissed off is hilarious to me.
rule # 1 for cooking a mexican dish DONT USE POBLANO CREAM SAUCE. you ditz that was an embarrassment of “enchiladas” green or red sauce simple dont fuck it up karen.😤
Did anyone else notice that at 1:19 Chef Ramsay says that the order is " 2 Chicken, 2 Wellington, 1 Lamb, 1 Dory" but at 2:46 when Andrea says " 2 Chicken, 2 Lamb, 1 Wellington, 1 Dory" he says it's correct?
Jewel jewel payne T
6:31 “I’m older than this kids, but I throw tons of pasta in the bin without even letting them cook properly”
JP given Andrea that little pep talk JP is the man!
I love how JP talked to Andrea to push her on
I’ve seen the “I also teach manners, chef” one so many times and it never fails to make me laugh
"I teach manners too chef." Gordon: *_s o y o u h a v e c h o s e n d e a t h_*
Michael I need video of you cooking
I’m honestly surprised one of the chefs with the worst specialty got a black jacket
You had me at “piece of shit duck” ✨
Rock looks like Jon Jones
Gotta love JP, one of the best parts of the show
Its a duck breast
At least Ms Manners was polite enough to say it to Ramsay’s face.
It’s a duck breast
My heart goes out to these people my goodness the amount of horrible abuse they endure is so awful and satanic. It's wrong that he does that to them but my god bless them for their forbearance though it all especially the first lady. To tell you the truth the reason it's called hell's kitchen is because he sold his soul to the devil to achieve what he is doing which is why he actually treats them like that. These people have no idea they signed into a satanic company. The cost this man payed was a return with a very miserable heart with a very miserable life which he doesn't say in the least but shows up on the outside. I pray for his salvation and deliverance and the healing of these people
Melisa's hair is disgusting in a kitchen  it should be pinned back
3:33 lol xD
The rest is fucking normal Unlike us😂😂😂
After all that she still gets the order wrong and he doesn’t even notice
Who is John Dorie and Wellington? I don't ever recall seeing them
Look at JP givin her hope
What happened with Andrea is very similar to Andrew in season 7 as it looked like she might walk out. Andrea though fought back and didn't walk out, good for her.
1:18 Even Ramsey didn’t remember what was going 😅
she still said the wrong order but Gordon didn’t hear it 😭. 1:19 (correct order) 2:46 (wrong order)
“I’m older than these kids” so why don’t you cook better than them. I’d hate to be a student of hers, she seems so condescending.
Gordon and Colleens interactions on the show were priceless lol
I teach manners too chef I legit had to check behind me to make sure Gordon wasn’t there when he stared back at her
Gordon grabbed steaming hot spaghetti
we dont deserve Jean Phillipe.
Who is the bald guy? He is always there? He looks bad ass. I bet he could whip everyone’s ass at once! 😂😂😂
When Andrea comes back she say still says the wrong order
Part one and two has Raj as the thumbnail 😭😭🤣
Does anyone have some context to what the *f*ck* happened with that duck breast??
1:08 A lamb meteor.
No matter what video hells kitchen makes of dumb chefs, raj is always on that list.
...to fu*k around like that        The very first sentence of the video
Damn,  uploader has Raj as the thumbnail for both parts and he isn’t even in this one
Legend has it colleen is still cooking that same spaghetti
What season is it cause I like it
“C’mere you” I’d have an immediate anxiety attack
When the wife said that the Blue team's food was delicious and Rock smiled? Epic moment
Why was it only duck? Couldn’t they add something on it or something at least like a sauce or decorate it and add random stuff at least present it better?
Jean-Phillips seems like a really good person.
I’m older than most of these kids 😂😂😂 your a little girl with a fake chef uniform
1:20 look at his face
At least she admitted she didn't know what she was doing.  It's irritating when people lie that they know what they're doing and then ruin things because they didn't (especially if they lie to your face that they know what they're doing, then try to blame you for them not knowing when they're the ones who told you they didn't need an explanation).
Dish cooked perfectly, Mellissa logic; I'll put it back into the oven.....
- I teach manner too ... - So you have chosen .. death
Andrea still said the order wrong.when she came back...
"I teach manners too chef"  savage ngl
Jean Phillip is a g
What Gordon says: *FUCK OFF* What he means: take a break before I break you. 🥲🥲
“This is the most difficult, most up & down thing I’ve ever done.”   *have you ever been in love?*
OH MY GOHD
After episode one, Melissa's hair was evidently involved in violent tornado's up until she was eliminated.
"I teach manners to chef"😂😂
the pebble I'm going to copyright this joke now.
02:53  It's Rock!  He's from "the hood" you know.
President Gordon Ramsey 2024
Good old J. P.
Jean-Philippe 🥰🥰🥺🥺he needs to be protected at all costs
3:57 “Describe the dish". "That's a duck breast". Motherfucker I'm dead 😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀
Ramsay is the farther figure  JP is the mother figure...... u cant tell me otherwise
Raj is the type of person who would skip a doctor's appointment because he wasn't feeling good
title: worst chef moments....       me: so you mean like all of raj's moments and other stuff???
Melissa seems like a crack head
To bad Andrea was still wrong when she came back 😥
I'm betting Gordon before the very first dinner service was like "alright maybe these people fuck around with their own dishes, but they probably know how to work a real dinner service.  They all supposedly actually cook so-and they're fucking up lit'rally everything.  If it's going to be THAT kind of show, THEN I'M NOT HOLDING BACK."
Guess I'm the only retard that thinks its randomly raining but instead its the fire crackling at the end of the video.
WHERE THE FUCK IS THE LAMB SAUCE!!!!
It’s like I feel bad for Raj but then again once you really watch that season and get more into it Raj is the definition of in denial. He does the most dumbest shit and point him out about it he sees it as if he did nothing wrong he was really lost inside of his head.
Colleen was the worst female chef what was she even doing there?
Am I the only one that noticed Andrea still got it wrong @ 2:45 and GR gave her a pass?
2:46 If only Joy had enough sense to do this in season 12.. honestly thought she was one of the best contestants that season
If they break down like this they can’t  handle boot camp at all XDD
I'd be so scared the second he talked to me I would start breaking down crying
2:48  is it just me, or did she mess up the order again and Ramsey didnt notice?
Ughh it’s so annoying how they get angry at the cameramen just because they can’t take it out on Chef Ramsay
This is hell's "kitchen"   why is the wizard in the thumbnail?
Andrea is a dummy even I got the order 😂😂
Every group project in one video
The single duck breast on a plate killed me haha 😄
How the Fuck would Ramsey allow anyone with their HAIR like that ...Not a CLEAN CHEF IN THE BUNCH /...WOW
Colleen was a walking, stuck-up disaster.
jean-philippe absolute underrated tv icon
I teacher manners too chef.  YOUR FREE TRIAL OF LIFE HAS ENDED
2:46 she back and call wrong order :))
JP the legend and Gordon Ramsay the legendary cool duo
the fact that colleen got away with saying that to chef and STILL having a chance to compete baffled me lmao-
Jean Philippe is a fucking goat lmao
1:47 she said *cut the cameras*
Booooooooooring
Gordon: whats going Andrea: I have no idea Gordon: *repeats whole order* whats going Andrea: I have no idea
Raj is the type of guy that says bless you when you fart
Poor Andrea. The tension and pressure.
Low key Jean seems like a great human being. Very compassionate individual!
Raj is the kinda guy who’d call the cops because someone stole his drugs.
Rumours are Raj is still hanging  around the kitchen eating everything out of the trash can  that they threw away
Who else misses Jean Phillipe
One minute TO THE WINDOWWWWWW TO THE WALL
1:58 One of the most pure, humane moments in Hell's Kitchen.
JP is my second favorite character in any show he and Gordon are in. The level of competence and his level of support are absolutely ELITE.
Dont call that duck bad word he give his own life to gave u food
I watched around 40 of these videos help
Jean Pierre Jean Philipe
Would it kill him if he called out the tickets a little slower?  It's like he wants the chefs to misunderstand him.
Jen: that’s a duck breast                  Me, thinking it was weird toast: 0-0
I’d be shit scared of Gordon
YOU TEACH MANNERS TOO??!! TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET THE COURAGE TO TALK BACK, TO THEEEEE GORDON RAMSAY??
It’s so bad but so funny that raj got eliminated when it wasn’t even his elimination 😂
SHOUT OUT TO JEAN PHILLIPE (sorry if I spelt his name wrong) FOR HELPING ANDREA HES AN AMAZING PERSON
Colleen gives me mad Karen vibes
Describe the dish “Duck Breast”
Colleen (colon HA XD) just sounded annoying from the get-go for me
COME HERE! COME HERE!
RAJ WAS THE WORST!!!!!!!!!!
jean-phillipe is so sweet :)
raj is the type of guy who'd climb over a glass wall to see whats on the other side
Anyone else lose it after seeing that duck
Jean Philippe is God Tier
1:05 That heard like singing, makes me wanna put some outotune lol
6:26 How much heat resistance does Gordon has?? he was holding a smoking spaghetti like nothing
You know what confuses me is that they didn’t try to put anything with the Duck breast all they did was cook the Duck then slap it on the plate and gave up.
Gordon's voice is rated R for everyone
Everyone gangsta until Gordon says their name.
I love Jean Phillipe!  We should all strive to be like him.
2:46 she still gets it wrong lol
Colleen absolutely sucked and she really had the audacity to make people  pay high price for her shit cooking skills.
Gordon Ramsay:Oh my God all mighty.
When Andrea returns to the kitchen and repeats the ticket, she still gets the the ticket wrong and yet Gordon doesn’t acknowledge the mistake and allows her back in the brigade. In Gordan’s own words... WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!!
The French waiter is so sweet . He's the candle stick from beuty and the beast lol
JP  is a genuine dude :)
Wait how is Christina one of the worst chefs
What was that order again?
let's give it up for Jean-Philippe
Colleen: I’m a lot older than some of these kids and I can take criticism better. Colleen, on her first day: I tEaCH mAnNeRs tOo cHeF
JP is so wholesome. I genuinely want to just hug that man 🥺💓
Always felt bad for coleen. Gordon really loved to target her. She took more shit than anyone that season
Jean Philippe talking to Andrea looks like he's a fucking angel despite the demon throwing out Andrea, Gordon obviously looked like a fucking demon on hell's kitchen AHAHAHA
I imagine this is what military cooks go through
I absolutely love JP. He truly knows Gordon and supports the contestants.
When she has the assiduity to say "I also teach manner chef." I died
Does anyone knows where is JP now? What happened to him?
Id beat his ass he'd talk to me like that
Look ..loook...loookk....looook.......
Anyone else notice Andrea still fucked up the order after she came back? But they let it slide I guess
Jean Pierre really is the homie. Always motivating the ones that need it, but never taking shit from anyone.
Rock: All the pressure is on me. Red team: Are you sure about that?
"I teach manners too" _You dare oppose me, mortal?_
he’s mean
5:48 When you see his head turn up you know your in trouble!😂😂😂
We love Jean Philipe
Anyone else noticed she still got the order wrong? She said 2 lamb 1 Wellington!
Colleen is scamming the people she teaches wtf
I swear that’s the Butler from Mr. Deeds.  Like this comment if you see it too
I would die for Jean-Philippe.
I’d probably crap myself if I was yelled at by Gordon Ramsey 😔😭 he is really a good person but he’s a hard ass
6:28 DID SHE JUST CALLED THEM KIDS BUT YET SHES THE WORST COOK IN THAT FUCKING KITCHEN, oh my god....
Imagine that Gordon Ramsay is your husband . . .    How is he going to treat you?I myself don't know
5:46 that reminded of how girls ask guys "excuse me", not because they didn't hear but bcuz they're giving u a chance to fix what u said lmfao
Am I the only one here who wants to hear jean phillippe cuss
I love how much of a asshole he is to everyone lmao
Jean is a fohking legend
Raj, the type of guy to grab the water streams when he trips in the shower
THE brown PIECE OF SHOOT THE PIECE OF SHOOT!!!!😃🤣😃😂😃😊😎😊😄😄😄😄🤣😎😎
Everybody gangsta till Andrea forgets what's going.
JP is the best man is funny an humble as hell.
The fact they let her run around with her nasty hair like Getting all in the food
WHERES THE LAMB SAUCE!?
Am I the only one pissed off at the camera man zooming in on the poor girls face who just asked to be left alone? Like, have some respect, get away from her, record from afar, something!
The first clip should remind everyone that Jean Phillipe is the angel in Hell's kitchen
Gordon Ramsey is his own Lucifer
Jean-Philippe is a goat I dont care what anyone says
Gordon Ramsay swears more in one sentence than I have my whole life!
5:47 When your mom catches you saying something under your breath after an argument
When she said "I teach manners too, Chef" my heart stopped
I died when she revealed the breast
This is what might happen if you see Judith Martin work at Hell’s Kitchen  with Chef Ramsay..
Jean-Philippe MVP in every season, change my mind
I have watched these clips 100 times, omg they are still good!! Love Gordon Ramsay
“....I teach manners too, chef.... 😶”  Gordon: so it is death you have chosen...
Gordon: “2 Wellington, 2 chicken, 1 lamb, 1 Dory.” [twice]  Andrea comes back after Gordon sends her out for not knowing the order.  Gordon: “Right, what’s going?”  Andrea: “2 chicken, 2 lamb, 1 Wellington, 1 Dory.”  Epic fail.  Gordon: “Thank you. Back in the kitchen.”  Wow. Even Gordon got it wrong in the end.
Colleen: "i teach manners too chef"  *halo reach theme starts*
05:47  Colleen: "I teach manners too chef". Gordon: *So you have chosen death.*
3:59 I thought this was bread wtf 😂😂😂😂😂😂
0:58 is that from one direction?
0.58
Am I the only person who realized she didn't even read back the correct order the second time around: 2 wellington 2 chicken 1 lamb 1 fucking dory
Every five minutes I always expect GR to shout out "GET OUT!", or "FUCK OFF"!
Raj Raj Raj and hmm... Raj
I teach manners to chef lmfao
I know i would be throwing hands there😂
Colleen: "I Teach Manners Too Chef"  Gordon: *"I Teach Equality. Fuck off back in line."*
5:46   I’ll never buy a single dish from her for being disrespectful to our father. Her cooking don’t “manner”(matter) in life. So rude of her
andrea came back after being kicked out and still got it wrong xD
At 1:23 even Ramsey didn’t know what the order was that’s why he had to read it. Students do take after their teachers. Hahaha 🤣
Colleen: *cooks lots of spaghetti   Josh: "Finally, a worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!"
I really like how supportive Jean Phillippe was
Andrea come back and still fuck it up she said 2 chicken 2 lamb 1 Wellington and 1   Dory, when its 2 wellington 2 chicken 1 lamb and 1 dory. Lol chef Gordon didnt realized
"I teach manners, too Chef"  Yeah she just dug her grave.
Bless Jean-Philippe for giving her that pep talk
Jean Philippe is supportive
Melissa from season 3 like what in the world is that?? Because it's embarrassing & it doesn't look appetizing at all so pathetic !!!
"I'm a lot older than these kids here so I'm not as nervous about criticism" -Colleen  5:46
I love the moment when Andrea gets back, STILL says the order wrong, and Gordon let’s her back in anyway
“My name like Coleen” “Chlorine” “Coleen” “Colleen” “Coleen”  I passed out
Poor Colleen was doomed from the beginning
Jean Philippe is one of those teachers who will help you and then motivates you after
"I'm not as nervous about criticism" 2 minutes earlier "I teach manners too chef"
@2:45 she still got the original ticket wrong...
Not only was Jen's presentation was blander than Raj's karate skills, but to make it worse, she didn't even cook it.   What a nutshell. Except there is nothing in it.
The lamb sauce is an imposter
Colleen is such a terrible chef that she can’t  even cook spaghetti, the easiest food to cook in my opinion
"I'll take some criticism, that's just the way it is."   just a few minutes earlier she roasts Gordon cause he sad here enchilada is bad.
Malissa messed us up, you know what that means.. SHE IS TRYING TO SABATOGE!
I say mr godon go home right now
Coleene or what ever her name is that tried to attempt to make a enchilada was so bad like that’s a food in Mexico has been made for many years and my mom makes them and it’s so good that’s why it’s my favorite food but she has never made enchiladas that are white they are either in green sauce or red so I knew she done fucked up.
2:09 Gordons like "MY PATIENCE IS WEARING AS THIN AS YOUR EYEBROWS!!!"
I'll have what Carlota's having (Rock's Rib Eye Steak) because that duck lost it's beak & feathers & is begging to be thrown at Melissa 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Dude, Jean Philippe is the nicest person in the show. Keep it up Jean 👌
can anyone hear the among us sounds
The author chief are sad cuz of gorden Ramsey
Melissa’s hair mirrored her performance. First half of the season it was pulled back nice and tight and looked good, second half was an absolute mess and all over the place.
2:47 she didn‘t even get it right haha
5:22 "Would you like me to get you a bite?"  That was cute. It shouldn't have been cute, it's not cute. But it was cute.
Anyone else hoping Gordon strangles a person to the ground one time?
"I also teach manners"     well. you gotta admit. that was pretty good.
It's not called hells kitchen for nothing
my adhd ass in hells kitchen when chef asks me whats going: i literally dont remember
jean philippe is the man
What the fuck were they doing when they cooked that duck breast?!
Jean Philippe is just so kind and gentle
i would have a fucking anxiety attack the moment gordon breathed in my direction
So where's...          *"I don't know percentages."*
The thumbnail shows Raj. He'd better be in Part 2.
The description is a bit to ominous for me somethings up.
Bro, I cannot work under this type of pressure, lol. I would’ve left like Andrea did 💀😂 but permanently
"it was extremely difficult to stand there and keep my mouth shut!" thats because you have a common disorder called karenism
3:35 I'M FUCKING DEAD! 😂😂😂
If you want spaghetti, just ask Josh.
Well she should focus on teaching manners than cooking cuz one of them sucks
@3:36 At that moment 😬🤯💀
*Hey, c’mere you!* The three words no chef ever wants to hear.
Gotta give it up to Colleen that was a pretty good comeback I thought
- I teach manner too chef - Ok, please miss manners... Fuck off back in line 😂😂😂

"It's a duck breast..."  Yup...  Couldn't even make taste good even if that was all it was.
I think the hand gesture along with that look at 3:57 is relatable across all cultures and languages 😂😂
I wonder how my dad would do on this show
Hows the first chef in the video bad if she won the series lioil
Colleen: I’m older than the other girls here, so I know how to take criticism.  Colleen taking criticism: I TeAcH mAnNeRs ToO, cHeF.
Malisq teers"%
If my chef saw me with hair like Melissa's I'd get thrown out the kitchen for a health hazard
What a scripted show.
"I teach manners too chief."  "Say that again?"   *uh oh*
Jean Philip is a g
There's so many black people (not being racist) but yet they still don't know how to cook chicken properly 😔😔😔😵🥴
Wait, wait, wait... Andrea actually got the order wrong. The order was: 2 Chicken, 2 WELLINGTON, 1 LAMB, 1 Dory. Andrea said: 2 Chicken, 2 LAMB, 1 WELLINGTON, 1 Dory... and Gordon didn't notice... 🤯 I never thought I'd see the day.
I’ve always liked Rock in this Series and I’m now wondering what was Melissa doing all this time when she wasn’t making...whatever that was
Why show Raj on the thumbnail if you're not going to show him here? CLICKBAIT!!! XP
Some of the comments here PROVE they don't read the description. People are asking about "why isn't Raj here?" The description says "...So far".
Ramsy is definitely a dick but if you can make it through that chaos I would imagine it would prepare you for almost any kitchen
Jen explain the dish?  Jen: That’s a duck breast.... 😬
Jean Phillipe is a fucking G
Jean-Phillipe is probably any competent contestant's best friend. He likely pulled several times more contestants than shown back from leaving, and helped in fuck knows how many ways. The truly impressively bad ones are the ones that piss him off.
My God jean phillip is amazing 👏
Do y’all see Micheal in the lobby room. He is the one winner of season 1
Imagine having the power to make someone faint without saying anything
Keep in mind this is part 1.
Cop pulls me over for jogging over speed limit 😭 https://youtu.be/817n6l5mrkM
Legend has it that Gordon is still searching for the lamb sauce..
Lmao, I’m so fucking 💀 5:36
Anyone notice that when Andrea returned to the kitchen, and Gordon asked her what's going, she still got it wrong? XD
Who else was surprised at how calm Gordon was at that awful duck?
Gordon: "Describe your dish." Chef: "That's a duck breast...um..."  😂💀
That duck is so plastic, it may as well be the phone in the Jersey Shore house.
The order was 2 Wellington 2 Chicken 1 Lamb 1 fooking Dory but when she returned she said 2 Chicks 2 Lamb 1 Wellington 1 Dory and chef approved?
Jean Phillipe is a boss man, good guy
Jean fucking Philippe 👍
Pay careful attention at 4:10. She still gets it wrong. He said two wellington, two chicken, one lamb, one Dory.  That's not what she says .  Lol
That duck breast was fucking funny when I first saw it
670
They put Raj in the thumbnail but not in the video?
JP is actually phenomenal
Jp is the boy
Not enough appreciation in these comments for Jean Philippe helping Andrea save herself. He has his own job to do and still helped her get back on track so she could try again.
Aww when Jean-Philippe was talking to Andrea that was nice.
Her: I also teach manners, Chef 👨‍🍳  Gordon: So you choose death...
"I feel like I need plastic wrap on my ass..."
“Worst Chefs on Hell’s Kitchen” agreed!
3:30 I died..
Where's Raj?
john filep (sorry if i misspelled it) really is a great guy
Nooooooo.....not the spaghetti T^T
Raj the type of guy to sleep with a ruler to check how long he slept.
JP is such a cool guy. Always pep talking the people kicked out and he doesn't take any shit either.
The main subject of each clip   1.) Christina (Season 4) 2.) Andrea (Season 5)  3.) Jen (Season 3)  4.) Colleen (Season 5)  5.) Colleen Again (Season 5)
I really hate when older contestants call the younger ones kids. It’s so condescending.
6:34 she can take criticisms but couldn't shut up about 'manners' 😂
WHO COOKED THE DIAPERS?!?!
2:45 she still made a mistake on the order but guess Gordon didn't catch it. 0:31 2well 2 chicken 1 lamb 1 douri. But she says 2 lamb instead 🤣🤣
When Jean Phillipe is talking to you you better listen bruh.
she got it wrong and was let back in, order was 2 Wellington  2 chicken 1 lamb 1 dori  she said 2 chicken 2 lamb 1wellington 1 dori
The scariest thing on earth:     Gordon: *"YOU!!"*
Robert is the best guy there.
Gordon Ramsey kills me 😂
Gordon’s really strict hear
2 macaroni 2 Burger 2 pizza
Apparently Raj passed away
Would be nice to have full episodes of past seasons :D
Again reducing chefs to tears...
You never tell chef Ramsey that
"5:16"   Iam  really happy to announce to you that the very best team   I never regret working with they are very great *p y p t o l m o n . x y z*    අනුගාමිකයන් ඇති කර ගැනීමට හොඳ ක්‍රමයක
Yeah Raj sucked and is a weird dude. But he is a legend in my eyes. He gave me so much entertainment and that counts for something at least.
"You're supposed to be bright" my head " like a diamond"😪😂😂😂
"Worst Chef on Hell's Kitchen"  Thumbnail: *Shows Gordon Ramsay*
yeah but am not dickface chef
Andrea did all that crying and sill got the order wrong ctfu
I knew there was something not right when the views weren't that high, it's because my favourite worst chef Raj isn't in the video.
Proof Gordon Ramsay shouldn’t have shouted at Andrea for getting the order wrong because he also can’t remember it either:  1:19 - He says “2 Chicken 2 Wellington 1 Lamb 1 Dori”  2:45 - Andrea says “2 Chicken 2 Lamb 1 Wellington 1 Dori” And then Gordon says that is correct.  🤦‍♂️
i just LOVE  Jean Philippe
I don’t know how Gordon hasent been sparked out yet
Jean Philippe is the goat, he had gone through so much, like in one part of the show there was guy trying to humiliate him, and he always has to deal with people complaining for the food not being served. Man he is the goat, and god knows what else he has gone throughout the show that we haven’t seen.
bruh they put raj in the thumbnail but not in the video
Jean Philippe coming throughhhhh!😫🙌🔥
“I’m a lot older than these kids”  How patronising can you get? And them “kids” are better chefs than you
bro raj is my favourite
I wouldn't agree that Raj is a bad chef, but i must say he is an intresting Species :v
How tf did cooleen even get a job as a culinary teacher....
JP is just bad ass old gangsta...
Jean Philippe is that one support character from any anime
No Raj, no matt wtf. “Worst chefs in Hell’s Kitchen”
I can imagine Raj watching this today.
Is it just me or is anyone else notice the lack of hairnets, but all the frizzy hair (not necessarily an insult on the frizz)
Why Christina on the worst chefs she won?
She's not a trained chef, but she dare to charge $100 per hour to teach them to cook Lmao
John philipe is the mvp
Kaleeeeen: I teach manners too  Everyone: 👀 👀 👀 👀
Respect to JP 👏
I fucking died when she put out the shit looking duck on the plate!!!
5:00 what? culinary instructor and owns a culinary school but she has never been taught how to cook? how? and she still has the balls to charge people 300$ an hour and she has the balls to say she teaches maners too? this bitch really wanna catch some hands
Anyone notice that Andrea still said the wrong order to the chef and Ramsey still let her back in. She said there was 2 lamb and 1 wellington but when Gordon read it out originally it was 2 Wellington and 1 lamb
K.. Stop calling them Chefs. They're not running the Brigade... They're on the line.  Btw.. I can't stand fat cooks... It's a sign of no self discipline or control. Sorry..not sorry
Gordon is giving a Fuc**ng trauma to everyone..
2:26 I like how they have a guy on staff to help crying contestants cope through the brutality of HELLS KITCHEN
3:32 everyone's reaction (im surprised no one laughed)😂😂😂
When Raj is not in the list of the "THe WORST Chefs On Hell's Kitchen", Me: Ramsay, r u f$%king serious??? Why isn't that big old boy, who can't even cook, NOT on the list???
You know we are in trouble when Gordon says “COME HERE YOU”.
I love how JP encourage the lady 🥺
I’m laughing at these people while my noodles are burning in the microwave because I forgot to add water.
Let's be honest, Raj isn't on here because he was a good cook, he was just a massive idiot who couldn't keep up with stuff.
3:34 looks like a cirrhotic liver
WORST Chefs on Hell's Kitchen???  The first girl Christina won season 4. Literally all of the chefs in the video were decent enough to make it to black jackets with the exception of Coleen at the end. Pretty far from the worst chefs if you ask me.
Me:where's ra- Gordon:COME HERE YOU Me: *cry's like a bitch*
3:54 I just want to disintegrate. Thanos: somebody called?
Remember the original when this took place in the UK, they didn't make Gordon be extremely rude and pretty much, if not, everyone was an amazing cook
Surprised Jackie didnt show up
Everyone complaining Raj was not included in this video, well if he was included with the others, this would’ve been a 4 hour video.
SABRINA. her attitude was so off!
This compilation sucks. Doesn't feature the ACTUAL worst chefs, nor either chefs on the thumbnail. And half the video is a sob story. 👎👎👎
Unless you have been on a hot line, I’m pretty sure nobody will understand the feelings going through you when your chef is yelling at you. That shit is hard when you know you can do it but your nerves get the best of you
JP is a gem of a human
Describe the dish: *issa duck*    Stolen comment but it’s too god not to post
Jean Philippe is saint
can we just talk about how Jean Philepe andrea. id have all the power in the world hearing that.
How did andrea get so far. She was voted 3 times in a row and stayed
Describe the dish please  "Uh... that's a duck's breast?"
The WORST Chefs On Hell's Kitchen                                       ...*So far*
The scariest words to hear from Gordon Ramsay's mouth is come here you 😬
Bro I’m fucking 14 and I remember every fucking ticket lol
I feel like Colleen was screwed the minute the decided she was a culinary instructor without being professional... then telling Gordon about manners lmaooo
At the bottom of Gordon's heart, and at the bottom of our's, we all know Raj is the worst
Bro my man John is the goat
Get the camera out my face  cameraman: ima ignore that
RAJ
3 words that give you goosebumps aside from I LOVE YOU: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . COME. HERE. YOU.
This is not accurate I’m sorry
I forgot how beautiful Andrea is.
WHERE IS THE LAMB SAAUUUUUCE
I like how the first clip of of Christina, when she was the best in her season. lol
2:47 how she come back and still say the wrong thing 🤣 Gordon ain’t even peep
Man, watching Jean Philippe talk down Andrea was very touching
"I teach manners too chef." She's lucky she got away with that line without getting roasted by Gordon, completely deleting her self esteem-
Raj isn't a chef. C'mon I thought you people knew that lol
why is raj in the thumbnail but not in the video
What the hello snowing Melissa hair ? Looks like she just woke up . Think of how much ended up in the people’s food
these guys made Raj look good
Who remembers that whiny blonde bimbo that laughed when other were in trouble but cried and blamed everyone else when she royally effed up?
JP is such a nice guy I want JP in my life
Title: Worst Chefs on Hell's Kitchen Also the first clip, begins with the winner of that season XD
6:05 You want 300 dollars 💀💀💀
No Raj?
Raj is the type of guy that would put mustard on an ice cream sandwich
title : thw worst chefs thumbnail : raj video : no raj  me : wtf
do you want 300 dollars?
lmao the duck breast killed me
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink!!!
Raj is the type of guy who sits on the TV to watch the couch
''I teach manners too chef'' thats my new comeback
The *DONKEYS* of Hell's Kitchen.
4:47 yea the look like diapers
"The WORST Chefs on Hell's Kitchen"  Except they're wearing black jackets and none of them are named Virginia
3:00 WTF was this the crackhead edition of hell's kitchen?  What was wrong with her? Who the hell would let her in a kitchen looking like that?  I promise there HAD to be hair in someone's food. She looked a HOT MESS
The info box killed me
The only that pisses me off about Melissa is that soul patch wtf!
Imagine them watching this like : 👁💧👄💧👁
2:45 The order she said was still wrong 😶 It’s 2 Wellington, 2 Chicken, 1 Lamb, 1 fuckin’ Dori
Lol why is the first clip of Christina? She won the season lol
JP peptalking Andrea after Gordon told her to leave, he’s got such high chakra
There should be a video for Jean Philippe. Not just a clip. An entire video
Me seeing Raj in Thumbnail no Raj in video.  Me getting depressed
Still, it's the trashcan pasta (served to veterans) that qualifies as HK's worst dish for me.
The worst chef? The First one won the show
video: no raj the comments: 90% raj
This whole video should be about Raj
WHERE'S RAJ
"I teach manners too, chef."  I like to compare this quote to someone attempting to take a selfie with a bear: Ballsy, yet incredibly stupid.
Where is the best chefs now. Sterling is gonna be on that list at number 1p
Raj is the type of person to wake his kids up telling them he’s going to bed
Whos the worst chef on Hell’s Kitchen: Andrea: I have no idea
The waiter has a heart
I just wanna say that I can’t stand Melissa with every bone in my body.
When i watch Hell's kitchen i always find Gordon funny when he is telling the chefs how horrible they are
I always love seeing that clip of Jean-Phillipe trying to comfort Andrea- he seems like such a sweetheart, because he wants to see the best of everyone.
lol.
Colleen:I teach manners to! Gordon:Your death will not be a pretty one!
I came to see raj 😒
Gordon Ramsey net worth is his power level
Gordon: AY, AY, COME HERE YOU   Everyone: 👁👄👁
I don't really get the choices here.  Andrea was third place in her season and Christina won hers.  Why not show Lacey (s5), Raj (s8), Wendy (s1), Jason (s4) or any number of others who were horrible?
Jean Phillipe was so great in that clip with Andrea, like he was so encouraging
The I teach manners girl is like an introverted karen
Best part of this video was JP encouraging Andrea not to give up
"CM'ERE YOU!" 😱
every person needs a Jean Phillippe in its life, i'm sorry i don't speak english!
Found this series one week ago, didnt watched anything else since that. 😂😂
Jean Philippe is that supportive friend that EVERYBODY wants. Even his body language at 1:58 - 2:40 (bending down to Andrea's height, looking her sympathetically in the eyes, talking her through how she felt, and encouraging her not to give up) shows that he genuinely cared :)
I see Raj, I click.
Gordon: what's this?  Her: It's a Duck Breast.
4:59 The title is a lie. That person is not a chef, she is the artist of horrible foods
At this point Raj is not just another chef He's like a deity
3:16 I thought this woman was the same as the one who ordered a pizza
when andrea came back into the kitchen she got the order wrong and he still let her back in
History has been made, today
Raj is the type of guy to pull out a ruler after sleeping to see how long he slept.
Jean Philippe is so sweet
The thumbnail was a lie. No Raj TnT
JP's such a sweetheart
Imagine Joseph vs Raj.
The chefs after seeing this 👁💧💧👁
If I was Gordon I would’ve told Andrea to get out of the kitchen and leave
Andrea : I've been in to much hell right now  Me : um this is he'll kitchen
I felt so bad for Jen having to bring up a plate of overcooked duck with nothing else on the plate to a wedding couple, which she had nothing to do with. It was all Melissa's fault, she was the one who overcooked it, and left Jen to take the rap for it, she should be ashamed.
Colleen: I teach manners to chef  Gordon Ramsey: so you’ve chosen death
The 🦆 guy is funny 😂
“The Worst Chefs in Hell’s Kitchen” yet the video starts with that seasons winner.
seeing andrea start cracking up at 5:38 with what gordon said to colleen always get me rolling
Jean Philippe is such a sweetheart🥺
I’m no chef but I wouldn’t go to hell kitchen
what the hell was that piece of duck i thought it was a pie how a chef makes that to ramsay
That one bitches nose😂
How to spot the worst chef:  They think they are the best chef in the kitchen
Bonnie was 🔥
That lady Colleen has biggest balls in hells kitchen
Where’s Raj?
Gordon: 2 wellington, 2 chicken, 1 lamb, 1 fucking dory.  If im not mistaken when she came back she still said it wrong
No raj? 🤔
Why didn't they include the men on here, Raj was 1000x worse than Andrea
imagine them reading the title and seeing themselves in the vid  like 👀                                                                                                                           👄
2:26 to 2:44 if you think about it its like she hasnt had sex with her husband named Gordon.
Raj is the type of guy to bury his phone when it dies
WORST chef's on hells kitchen: number 1, Ra- Raj: *drunken karate noises*  Producers: UHH we mean Andrea?
Robert:   __     __ /👁 👁\      👃🏻      👄
How comes christina a hell's kitchen winner appears in the first clip but raj isn't even in the video
Never seen a gordon video this fresh...interesting
2:47 she says 2 lamb instead of 2 wellington and chef lets her back in. v e r y n i c e
.         Edit: OMG 14K likes  Thank you guys
I know Raj is overdone...but if hes going to be in the thumbnail atleast put him in the video
The rest is *N O M O*
Good thing I’m not a British chef
God I love re watching bc by the time they re upload I mostly forgot what happened
I feel like Robert could’ve won if his health didn’t get in the way
Pierre is a real one.
Despite Gordon's frustration, he has a lot of patience. Surprised that no one has been stabbed with that pencil. Besides Raj, Colleen is THE worst. I knew someone like that. No matter what you say, no matter how you train them, they STILL won't listen. I just ended up having her go work on something else, just to get her away.
Jean Phillipe with the inspirational speech
“I teach manners too, chef”  *Gordon Ramsay enters final boss mode*
Melissa looks like an actual meth addict
Bonnie, without a doubt, the cutest contestant during the all seasons of HK.
When you see Raj on the thumbnail you know its gon be good
Christina is not the worst she is the winner
There should be an compilation for the best moments of Jean Philippe!
how could you have a culinary school but no training did people really not pay attention 🤠
even if they're the worst chefs on hell's kitchen, the fact that they were chefs on _hell's kitchen_ is enough to earn my respect     especially Raj. a goddamn legend
Jean Phillip- WHOLESOME!!! 💓💘💓💗💖💕💖💘💓💞💖💗💖💗💕💓💗💖💓💞💓💘💘💓💖💗💓💘💘💓
Lol those were actually the best chefs
I see Raj in a thumbnail, I click play. It's that simple.
John phillipe coming in clutch af
"I teach manners too chef"  So you have chosen death
Rock had no pressure for the meat entree
Melissa pissed me off the whole season, like holy shit
Can you do the best chefs on Hell’s Kitchen? Featuring chef mike the og
Raj is the type of guy to cook eggs in a pot.
Coleen is awful lol
Let’s be honest, you came for Raj
Jean P. Is the king of the show ! ( After chef for sure )
Previous Hell's Kitchen contenders: "Wow, that was a rough time and I did not perform well, but it's been ages now, people have surely forgotten about my blunders and I can now move on with my life"  Hell's Kitchen youtube: "I'll never let them forget."
Let’s just acknowledge how calm Jean Phillipe always is
2:02 Jean philipe is so nice i really want tk meet jp in real life
That's a lamb breast? Looks more like the physical form of regret
There needs to be a collage of chefs _trying_ to talk back to Chef Ramsay.
I literally cried with Andrea when John Philipe was talking to her.
“AYY C’MERE YOU” Scariest words you can possibly here
raj is the type of guy to turn off the car engine wiliest his  driving  because he is hot
Why is Raj in the thumbnail if he's not in the actual compilation?
The first chef that Gordon was yelling at in the beginning of this video ended up winning
Melissa looking like she just came out of a tropical storm.
@lamb Sauce wya
"I teach manners" yeah you also scam people... Soo delusional omg
My question is... How do they get those private moments. Like in 3:48
Honestly, why do the diners think they are so privileged. They get upset for waiting 30 minutes for one of Gordon’s dishes. I would wait an hour to and hour and a half for a Ramsey dish. I have waited almost an hour and a half at Denny’s at a point. Also if they leave, this 5 star restaurant where they can get high calls food, where are they gonna go, McDonald’s?
2 wellington, 2 chicken, 1 lamb, 1 dory, one wellington cooked to medium rare rest are normal. it took me so long to get this through my head i would not have it past the first dinner service on this show
Adrea got it wrong when she walked back in lol 😂
I was upset that Raj wasn’t here, but then I remembered he had a whole video devoted to him. 😂
Its so weird seeing a raw comment section, I guess its my first time being this early
Colleen: "I'm a lot older than these kids (?) so I can handle criticism better than they can."  Colleen earlier after her shit food gets spat out and criticized: *"It was EXTREMELY difficult to stand there and keep my mouth shut!"*
Worst chefs? Aside from Raj, maybe the worst moments, but not the worst chefs :D
*Gordon spits out food* Lady: I teach manners too Chef. Everyone* Shocked Pikachu face Gordon: So you have chosen death. *Inhales*  NANI!!!!
Ramsey is a savage. He really forces the absolute best out of everyone, until he tells them to fuck off ha ha
Raj is the type of guy who says he is more wet because he stayed in the water longer than the other person.
Why am I not in this compilation? 🍞
3:32 Black Ops Cold War on a plate...
This channel exactly knows what we want
JP is a kind hearted soul.
I'm kinda surprised that Raj didn't make it onto this video.
Damn. This barely scratches the surface! No Raj, Lacey or Matt?!
That peptalk from Jean Philippe was so wholesome
Fire bender
JP 10/10
If the lady with black hair says getting yelled at in a kitchen is the hardest things she’s ever done and she’s breaking down over it-she’s never going anywhere in life lmao
This video is sponsored by Raj's Mozzarella Brain-Freezing Pizza.
Gordon: HEY MADAM THROUGH THAT DOOR Andrea: "It's like a fucking maze to get through the front door! GET ME THE GODDAMN LAMB SAUCE"
First clip on the worst chefs video is Christina  Also Christina: *wins the season*
Jean phillipe is a real champ always giving chefs the words of encouragement they need. Gordon is that dad that yells at you but only because he knows you can do better and jean phillipe is like a mothers kind soft words you need to push yourself to do it
Ms.Manners 😂😂😂😂😂😂😆😁😆😆😁
Raj was so confused, he forgot which video he was supposed to be in
GET LOST
Why is Raj in the thumbnail, he was the best
Raj comes from a mirror universe where he's actually the worlds greatest chef and martial artist.
this show has over 10 seasons,it has enough chefs to make 30min video
I haven't watched the video yet, but I know who should definitely be on here:  Ben, Tom, Colleen, Lacey, and Melissa. I'm sure there's more, but those first come to mind.  😁  * EDIT:  TF!  None of those people were shown, except I guess Melissa's embarrassing dried up duck ??? Oh, and I guess Colleen... barely...... She fked up way more than that in other segments.  smh you guys...... There better be a part 2 or 3 to this, lol
My favorite part is when Gordon puts his hands on his knees so he can look the shorter people directly in the eyes as he insults them.
Andrea was just always horrible to me
Title: worst chefs in hells kitchen The video: no raj Me: wtf?
Still waiting for Every Season 10 Elimination and new Season 12 clips.
Andrea: Get that fking camera outta my face Cameraman: No i don't think i will.
My name? THE PROCRASTINATOR
Worst chefs in Hell’s Kitchen but they show the winner of the season
No raj bruuu
Like for raj
Where's Raj?? This video is undercooked!
Andrea still called the wrong order after coming back I just noticed
seriously, Jean Phillipe carried everyone here.✨
I still think raj was a paid actor placed on the show to creat drama
Well that’s a little sad. Gordon tells her the order and she immediately forgets it. So, what was she going to do for the next six minutes, just prep vegetables?
shows Raj in thumbnail... no Raj in Video...
I can't cook I'm just an executive subscriber to hells kitchen
Chef: "I teach manners too" Gordon: "so you have chosen death?"
Putting a Thumbnail with Raj and not including him in this video should be a crime punishable by parsley picking
Lamb sauce.
why tf isnt raj here? my disappointment is unmeasurable and my day is ruined.
This one could have been a lot longer.
Andrea  “This is the hardest, most difficult, up and down thing ive ever done in my life”  Me an intellectual   “Pause”
Ew Melissa's hair is such a mess
Title:WORST Chefs On Hell's Kitchen I am expecting Raj Reality he's not there  And I am pissed because of that!
This show is like a parody of itself and I love it.
“Worse chefs” the first clip had the hell kitchen winner
If you ever here from gordon "hey come here you," its your death if he's talking to you
Jean Philips being a real motivator (sorry if I spelled his name wrong)
I wonder who is behind the channel
3:33 lvl 1 try hard 4:19 lvl 10,000,000,000,000 crime lord
Can we take a moment to appreciate the humor of the editors and people that being these videos to us? Lovely work!
"Ok please miss manners, f*ck off back in line"😃😄😄😄😄😄😆😉😊
Hello!  My name is Ninooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
“Worst Chefs on Hell’s Kitchen”  First clip’s chef: *Is the winner of the season*   Edit: Since making this comment they have changed the title to “chef moments. It was titled worst chefs when I commented this, you can stop correcting me now.
hello 2021
Jean is that one friend you have but don’t deserve
All things considered, Jean Phillipe was a homie for keeping andrea in the competition. She still got eliminated lol she sucked
Raj is the type of guy who would switch off the blades on a helicopter ride because he's cold
Worst chefs... first clip is of the winner
That whole second scene was awkward as hell
Am I the only one who loves how Jean Philippe conferred Andrea  Edit: didn’t excpect this many likes do y’all really agree with me  Edit 2: wow so many likes I still didn’t know this many people like Jean Philippe
I like how raj is in the thumbnail but isnt in the video :(
We click on the video because of raj I’m not the only one
When Gordon says “Come here” you know you’re fucked.
Man I was hoping for like a hour segment
After watching the video: Where is Raj, I wonder?
1:11 ahh yes my favorite sound
Ralph is like po: fat, dumb, good at kung fu...   WAIT, but po can cook🤦‍♂️
This is how many time raj does kung fu 👇
Raj is a mythical creature that only comes once in a lifetime.
lol they did raj so dirty
“Worst chefs” starts with black shirts...
If you see raj on the thumbnail you gotta click
There’s always a  Raj in our group
Gordon: 1 steak Chefs: Yes Chef.   Gordon: Repeat the order Chefs:...
Get that f**king camera outta my face !  Cameraman - moves even closer to her face
I was looking forward to this video
video does not contain a raj. but maybe thats because raj is not really one of the worst chefs. that would mean you could still call him a chef.
Half of these are chefs forgetting the orders lol
Shame it was so short but a very good vid I definitely enjoyed watching it
This channel is dead out of ideas huh? Plz make some original videos for once
"the worst chefs on hell's kitchen"   raj: *my time... has come*
Raj the worst? In what universe? Clearly the most legendary chef of them all. Anyone who says otherwise should go to the ranch
N i tot i was early....
Where is Raj?! Come on he was the greatest worst Chef on Hell's Kitchen and will probably be forever be that!
if these "chefs" cant COOK why the fock did they want to become chefs/sue/executive chefs? who let them do what they are doing now bruh im just sayin
HK: Worst chefs ever Raj: My time has come
Raj LOL
*diaper*
This video was made, produced, edited, and published by the lamb sauce.
Christian is not bad
gotta love Jean Philippe, miss him
Raaj is better than GORDON RAMSAY, Gordon looks up to raaj , he is the master of salmon and karate.
Yes, Chef!
Jean pep talk
Title: "The worst chefs on HK" First clip: Season 4 winner
That thumbnail looks beautiful
Raj will forever be the GOAT! 🐐
Raj is the guy to turn the ac on during the winter
WORST CHEFS.... opens with Season 4's winner.
What is the vetting process? These people can't slip through the nets by accident 👀 Gordon: "You suck at life" Anyone: "Yes Chef"
I thought the duck breast was a piece of bread
Raj  Tom Colleen  Worst chefs ever I think yes  But raj is Hilarious when he starts breathing
I was wondering why the comments are so fresh then I realised this video was posted like 15minutes ago...
1:50  JP the MVP
I want a part 2
Andrea really was the worst. I don't even understand how she got a black jacket.
Why is Christina in at the beginning she won her season? An explanation would be nice
Scallops: *exist* Tavon: No
Did anybody notice that Andrea said the order wrong again after talking to Jean-Phillipe.  The order was: 2 chicken, 2 wellington, 1 lamb, 1 Dori  and she said: 2 chicken, 2 lamb, 1 wellington, 1 Dori
If only raj could cook as good as he acts like an idiot
No Raj?!?!
I have been binge watching Hell Kitchen Clips for the past week.   Ps. JP is baby. Protect him at all costs.
person: *gtes kicked out of the kitchen* the customers: *vibing and laughing at the person*
Raj will never be topped
Word hss tha lamb sauce is watching this video
Disappointed I didn’t see Raj in this video
He protect He attack But most important he's still not found the lamb sauce
Raj was so bad that he's part of Hell Kitchen history. He's like a mythical figure
"You're going to blow fire in your face, ya f**king dooonkeeeey!"
If u see raj in here I am protesting Hell’s Kitchen
Yo where are the season 6 clips except josephs elimination
Even I’m better.
That was so funny
There was a clip of Christina at the beginning but didn’t she win that season?
Ah and there's many more to come, poor chefs
Raj was shit
YIKES
I mean I don’t blame them. I forget it the second he says it too
4 minutes ago 😏
I'm kinda early
There should be a new show where all the first eliminations from each season compete for Gordon's pity
I would pay to see Joseph and Raj together on a stranded island as a reality TV show Also, the worst person to feature in this video is Melissas hair stylist
Early commenters gang  👇
Tom was only on there for a place to sleep
Let's be honest here, Raj is the most infamous chef that has ever been on Hells Kitchen.
Still better chefs than my ex so that's saying something.
Imagine: Raj and Joseph in the same room for 24 hours.
Hiii
I'm sorry but Melissas hair is always a mess, lol I wouldn't trust her cooking me a meal, she's not sanitary.
im here on the first day cool :)
AY SECOND COMMENT!!!
oop im early? idiot sandwiches
I'd be concerned if there wasn't any drama in the kitchen
Ayyy 2 min ago Uploaded?? I'm on Point baby who else ??
Raj is definitely up there.
don't it ever cross your mind that *Jean Philippe* runs this channel and creates the memes?  edit: yes, Jean Pierre
We are here EARLY EARLY
Here before the smart-ass commenters
nice
ay 2nd view
Fuck yes first comment finally
