Drake makes this song almost bad
Any Gambian here , 2025
I like this song but I can do without the graphic descriptions.   Was in a shop (wasn't adult-themed or anything) the other day and they had reggae playing and the guy was singing "...pussy wet like WAH-TAH!" and I had to laugh, teh cashier was equally embarrassed lol.
Fire!
Need a music video
Fat Joe told us badman don't dance, we just pull our pants and do the rockaway
💜

Are we going to ignore how bad this drake feature is
And in classic fashion, Drake ruined the song. J Hus tho, hit the spot bro 👌🏾

I'm a drake fun but i didn't feel him on this one
7 Me  Yes
Youuuu boo

pepper pepper
I heard that trouble may in fact find drake at some point in time
"If you come close, I'ma explode Gal there carryin' a heavy load Whine your waist in a semi-circle Gettin' money fast, man's not a turtle Had to go through so many hurdles Block's so hot like inferno Had some issues that were internal Had a mad life, I could write a journal But I can't lie, I love the journey Me and the money had matrimony All the ratchet gals wan' pattern up All the posh gals get ratchet for me If you love me, you're clappin' for me If you throw it, I catch it, trust me Gal come from far, even up sa' I want the best, not comme ci, comme ça"💪🏽🌹💰

J  HUS is the best thing out of the UK ..,......!!!!!  Hello is from EAST LONDON..........!!!!
Ironic to hear a drake feature use the word "little bum bum". Certified pedophiles
Drake ruined this song
Stiekem?  Waarom? Beschaamd voor je daden?
Nice for you to see? Good your you! Happy!
Nog nooit van hoort, toegevoegd aan? Ej nieuws te verkondigd, of ej dit nodig ??
Fam drake part 🤮🤮🤮
I'm just simply happy that j hus has power a real g  💯
What does sweetchy mean? 👀
This style is "AMAPIANO" right? It is so fucking groovie! Love the beat and the percussion "Bass" in combination with the real bass... so gooooood!
I need no drake version
Who told you BAD man don't dance?✌️❓️❓️‼️
Thank god J Hus is in the song for some reason Drake starts singing head shoulder knees and toes
I love this I be jamming to it in my mum’s car
🔥
The song is fire as IS!
Drakes verse on this is a prime example of when his ghost writer is on annual leave.
Drakes part is so ass it ruined the song man
Who told yew Bad Man dont Dance
Who told you bad man don't dance? Who told you gangsters don't dance? Even with a wap on my hip, I dance Bad man, take another sip and dance Two left feet, don't trip and dance The gyal want me, I might give her a chance Give her a look, she give me a glance She wore that tight dress just to enhance Your likkle bum-bum Never seen you before, where you come from? You got a fat pum-pum, I got a long Johnson I know I never met you at random This must be destiny, that's why you're next to me You feel like ecstasy This must be destiny, that's why you're next to me You feel like ecstasy Who told you bad man don't dance? Who told you gangsters don't dance? Even with a wap on my hip, I dance Bad man, take another sip and dance Two left feet, don't trip and dance The gyal want me, I might give her a chance Give her a look, she give me a glance She wore that tight dress just to enhance Touch my forehead, chest, left shoulder Then right side, pray my brothers are good outside I know the vibes, I know the vibes You're the one, girl, stop rollin' eyes I find love and it slowly dies So Lilah Pi, don't make my eye cry Let me hold your controlla, I'm not one of these controllin' guys I want you to touch road with the girls dem, and socialize Enjoy your life, your backside is so fit, it opens eyes I know the vibes, I know the vibes Just 'cause I'm not jealous doesn't mean I don't care, that's just not fair I knew you were trouble, I was unprepared If I was married, this might turn a scandalous affair Trouble is there, trouble is there Trouble been right there, trouble is there Trouble gon' find me anywhere, trouble gon' find me, bubble and winey Ayy, trouble gon' find me, trouble'll find me anywhere Trouble'll find me, trouble will find me It's okay, girl, bubble and winey They want me dead, but don't remind me Both hands around you, it's not tiny

Drake is trying to sound jamaican💀
This needed a video
Hits hard every time
Drake ruins this song, it's like he's trying to fit in with his cool UK mate. "Your backside is so fine". Go back to Canada and leave J Hus to it Drake.
Drake like always adding flavor to all the songs he’s featured on, he the king of features. Haters gtfo here
Harddd
🔥🔥
Everybody hatin on Drake in the comments that nigga killed it 🔥🔥🔥🔥
“Drake ruined this song” - ☝️🤓

PAUL POGBA TYPE SONG
Got that South Florida Caribbean, Latin, .   DADE COUNTY Wynwood Late night  Early morning ViBe!!!💪🏾 615/305 🥃👍🏾
what the fuck is that verse from drake what the hell
Totally love the tune, but why is drakes vocal so badly mixed? It's to much highs, to much compression. There is no life in it any more. Hus vocal sounds so much more natural. That isn't recorded and mixed in the same way. Still a good song, but to me that song and vibe would have deserved that.
Drake sounding like Temz hmm
Love this song always having a drink
WHO SAID BAD MAN DONT DANCE
Bro kinda sound like jcole in his voice he just needs to like rap in regular speaking way 😮💡
Does he know the vibes? Like - Yes Dislike - No
MY WEST AFRICAN BROTHER... AFRICAN TALKING OVER
The patois is crazy 🇯🇲 Jamaica’s influence is insane.
Drake just fucked this tune up 😂 J hus should have just done it alone .. Drake you need to learn bro
This is 100% pure cracky guy, if you ever do a remix get Boosie on this
Im wayting for the video😢
Definitely an L not shooting a vid for this
I love this song when i drink
When drake sang ,' both hands around you, it's not tiny.'   He meant it
Just makes me think of criminals….
i know this song from jk dance cover
bro drakes version is @ss
“Your back side is so fit it opens eyes”💀💀💀
I have to listen to this in work and it’s so shit I feel like killing my self every time I hear this.
2024 ??? ❤
Greets from Germany, Fire song
had this on replay back in summer. This was definitely the theme song of Summer 2023.
Na sick of drake a😂
Bien sûr, voici une proposition de texte avec une problématique en deux parties :  Introduction : L'opposition entre Paris et la province est un débat qui perdure depuis longtemps. Certaines personnes soutiennent que cette opposition a encore raison d'être, tandis que d'autres pensent qu'elle est dépassée. Dans ce texte, nous allons explorer ces deux perspectives afin de mieux comprendre cette question complexe.  Partie 1 - Oui, l'opposition entre Paris et la province a encore raison d'être : Il est indéniable que Paris occupe une place prépondérante en France, tant sur le plan économique que culturel. La capitale regroupe de nombreuses institutions, entreprises et opportunités professionnelles. Elle attire les talents et les investissements, ce qui renforce son statut de centre névralgique du pays. De plus, Paris est le berceau de nombreux événements culturels majeurs, attirant ainsi l'attention et les visiteurs du monde entier.  Partie 2 - Non, l'opposition entre Paris et la province n'a plus raison d'être : Cependant, il est important de reconnaître que la France est un pays riche en diversité régionale. Les régions de province ont également beaucoup à offrir, que ce soit en termes de patrimoine, de qualité de vie ou de développement économique. De plus, la décentralisation et les politiques de régionalisation ont permis de renforcer les régions et de réduire les inégalités territoriales. Ainsi, il est temps de dépasser cette opposition stérile et de valoriser toutes les régions de manière équitable.  Conclusion : En conclusion, l'opposition entre Paris et la province suscite toujours des débats passionnés. Cependant, il est important de reconnaître que la France est un pays diversifié, où chaque région a son rôle à jouer dans la construction d'une société équilibrée. Il est donc nécessaire de promouvoir une vision plus inclusive et de valoriser toutes les régions, afin de favoriser un développement harmonieux et équitable sur l'ensemble du territoire.

Worst verse by Drake ever. Dude sounded like he intentionally wanted to ruin the song.
Proper proper
Be sure to listen to this on a decent stereo. Trust me

Came all the way here to say, Drakes flow is atrocious on this song.
It's really concerning that such a song (sorry for calling it a song) gets 132K likes. In ten minutes, a kid with a drumming machine can generate better music than this one.
Every does not need drake. J Hus should have kept this one to himself because his bars are way better❣️
🕺🏿🤞🏿🖕🏿🤙🏿💥🔥💥🔥💥💯
Banger❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

IF YOUR SHOULDERS DON'T MOVE WHEN YOU HEAR THIS YOU AREN'T ALIVE

Drake verse grew on me. Trouble will find me anywhere.
Typical Nigerian Afrobeats track. Took inspiration from Wizkid - 2 Sugar (feat. Ayra Starr. Pure Afrobeats not DanceHall or Afro swing
Anyone got a version without Drake? His bogus singing just ruins it for me

Drake has got to be the most versatile artist of a generation.
*I used google translator to comment because I don't know how to speak English* I'm Brazilian and I love this song , it became my favorite song , it 's really good to hear and it really motivates me this song is perfect in my opinion , it 's just annoying some people complaining about the drake part ( they even made a version without drake ) , the song is perfect , I know everyone has their own opinion so it 's better to let it go , I 'll follow the next songs now , I 've become a fan of you
Amapiano worldwide❤

John 3:16-18    Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late Please i plead with you for the sake of God and your souls. Jesus lived, died and rose again to save us. To save you.
Drizzy Drake don't miss...HIP HOPS SINATRA. Most consistent, versatile, and a song hook master. Drake continues to dominate the radio air waves and his music is a VIBE FOR WHATEVER MOOD YOUR IN...And despite being a commercial music JUGGERNAUT. He low key is a witty word smith on the mic and his introspective flow hit different cause he gives you his perspective from all angles. Competition want Drake out the way BUT THEY CANT FIND NO ONE TO REPLACE HIM because some legends names are carved in STONE...
Afrobeat to the world
J hus >>>
Why fruitcake drake??
💃💃 Cant stop DANCING
They needa take this drake guy off
this shit hit 🔥
it's literally Afrobeat🇳🇬 it's also the same beat as that of Wizkid ft Ayra star 2 sugar with a few small modifications, listen carefully 🔥🔥❤️‍🔥🇨🇮🇱🇷
Who told you ?

Who told you badmon don't dance !!
First time I Think a drake verse did a beat injustice. Man could have put wiz kid and nba/smirk and would have been over!!!
0.20 I am a bad and also a gangster and i can assure you that this is the first song ive ever danced to, my gangster ways have never allowed me to dance especially with a gun in my waist until now...I used to just Lean back when a song came on but now J huss has allowed me to let myself go thanks bro 🥲
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ghana 🇬🇭 ❤️

This will be a classic
I hope Jhus didn’t pay Drake for the verse. He didn’t need him 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
That 🔥 📛 👨‍🚒 🚒 🧯 💯  summer tune

J hus carries this, drakes only needed to bring global attention to the tune 💪💪💪
SUMMER HIT FROM JHUS

UK rap >>>>>>>>> US rap 0:01
“Touch my forehead, chest, left shoulder, then right side…”. Drake is special

Drake ruined a banger!
Drake is not needed on this 😮
Song name
this is a masterpiece ❤️‍🔥
I can’t wait for the album. killing it🔥🔥🔥🔥
Drake verse got more and more ass
Drake wrote this verse himself 😅😅🤣
First verse was MUR-DUR. WE NEED A PART 2
Drake effortlessly did well, but this good music, I'm sure my chic is on tongs in someone's yacht enjoying this song.
Kinda feel like drake ruined the song , still goes hard but it just didn’t sound right for the song
Truth is Drakes verse slapsssss🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Drake ruined the track
When the ghost writer ghosts you
j hus fire
Drake flopped hard on his verse lol. “I’m not one of these controlling guys” 😂💀🤡
Drake ruined this song 😂  Trouble trouble BS keep that ish in Canada
Why does drake have to ruin every single song he is in? This song would of been a banger if it was just jhus, drake is another version of DJ Khaled, he's just their in good songs, sometimes he's in good songs others he's in bad songs, they need to stop bringing these 2 people into music, they are known but not liked
Am I the only Nigerian who can sense afrobeat in this song?
Drakes so far off the vibe 😂
I think the beat is the problem. Sometimes its sounds good then its off...verses were actually  ok but its just the beat for me.
big fan
This has to be the best song I have listened to in 2023.
controlla part is giving me 2016 vibes 🥺
Honour to be on this track...for drizzaley. Hus legend for MyYout...
I'm into it, I'm here for it, I love it! ❤
Drake is a culture vulture. Tell me I'm wrong
Drake ruining the whole flipping track man

Why everyone hating on drake now, its him and thats his style. Gave the track different vibe. Its just amazing the whole thng together 🫨
people are hating on drake on this i think he goes nice on it
Ngl I kinda wish this was a J hus only song, I’ve always liked drake but recently he doesn’t flow as well on some songs. He used to be a hit on basically whatever he was on, it’s not the case anymore. He kills the whole vibe of the song for me, the first minute and 15 seconds of this song is lit…then drakes part 😂
Bad man
Big choon🔥🔥🔥
i hate drake’s verse!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Drake is so off the beat 🫣
Am obsessed ❤
If anyting...da yout's effortlessly rhythmical.🙌🏾
🎉
A fucking hit!
Drake keep social distancing from that beat man fucking ruining it

Someone tell Aubrey to not write his own lines
Was i the only one who heard 'toutes les filles'😂
Big tune but Drake spoiled it
Nice how back in 2019, J Hus was being brought onstage by Drake as a fan. Now here he is doing a song with him. Great to see and what a banger of a song!
This tune something else, love the AJ Tracey mix too, loving it, hope this is a good commercial success for you !
This is a TUUUUNNNEEEEE... 🔥 💙 💯 💙 🔥
Mostack would have been  miles better than drake on this.
Nasty tune
Unpopular opinion but drake ruined this song!

Drake part IS realy dog shit fr
The fuck is drake singing
Unpopular opinion: this song would slap better without drake
Honest constructive criticism here: J Hus smashed this tune, ✔️ Disappointed with Drake’s verse. I just re played his 2011 Album today and this standard here is pretty poor, not fair on J Hus, who created a memorable song with great vibes. Drake’s verse descended into mediocrity from midway towards the end.
Drake ruined a perfectly good song
What‘s going on with drake bro 😂
This is sick 😂 I  like it so much
😥
Bro why did drake ruin the song
Drake
Mostack would of been better than drake 💯💯
Drake sounds AI generated
Tory lanez wud of done a better verse hopefully J Hus does a remix to this tune with more features
Drakes voice sounds so whingy
De jeugd kan ons niet meer shockeren met style en muziek.. we hebben alles al gezien en gehoord.. wat ze rest is t nog extremer proberen vorm te geven..  "gelukkig" kiezen ze voor gebrek aan kwaliteit om ons te stangen...
All the NPCs gassed
About Afro beats that’s original garage beat 😂
Bruh
Nice beat- but they both sound way off beat 😮
What is drake saying bruv
Mad ting
J hus kill the beat
Man....I like this song and the beat is fire 🔥 but let's be honest, Drake's verse is ASS. Don't get me wrong I'm usually a fan of Drake's music but out of everything he could of done over this beat, it's this lazy ass shit 🤨 having "trouble gone fine me" Is the most annoying, uncreative shit ever and his verse is the worst thing about this tune. If I were J Hus I would be pissed and would of passed on that drake verse because this tune is so good it didn't need Drake.  And @J Hus I doubt you'll see this or read this but I don't care. I hope this banger makes it your summer to shine but imma keep it real. Your lyrical content on this beat is just hella slack for no good reason. You could of gotten your point across more lyrically if you had avoided the slackness. I would of used fish go deep as a point of reference anyway I'm glad there's a clean version.
drake verse was abit long, however top 3 banger for summer...after v6 and talibans
drake lowkey missed on this one
Banger 🔥🔥🔥
Why can I picture drake twerking when j hus is saying his verse 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️

Who's jackings drake's verse?😭
this sounds way too african for drake still
🥰 this is good
So 2016
banger oml
We need amapiano mix for this
nah this shit why this trending sprinter should be
Drake is matching the flow and is great on this J Hus though is ass.
Na I don’t rate drakes bit
Everyone complains about drake’s verse but we’ll just get used to it😂
Wtf is drake doing 😂😂😢
Badman can dance ong
J hus taking over 2023 summer🔥🔥
I think J Hus team purchased a Drake verse and added it on the beat as an afterthought. Thats why the flow sounds off
ok
this songs shit the flow is off beat waste of drake feature
Drake

Drake verse is messy and very dissonant 😢
Drake
Ngl this could have been better. It reminds me of the old drake.
Smashed it 🎉
There was no need for drake to be on this song. Would've been perfect without him.
Song is a banger!  But is it just me or does Drake's verse sound AI generated?🤔

Drake isn’t a vibe
Drake RUINS it
Just reminder this guy j hus subscibers went up by hundred thousands after drake feature
Cant wait for scary hours.  The Bollywood sample. At the gates track.  Drake you did your UK charity work for the decade. Move from these cockroaches 😂
Drake is biggest rapper in the world.  These uk people just mad that Drake outshines j hus.  Well enjoy your moment the UK. Drake got a Bollywood sample coming.  Scary hours😢
Funny how people like tgis a money grab for drake when people know drake dont make people pay for features. Because j hus couldn't afford a drake feature.  Lets be real j hus is candle while drake is a whole fire in music world.  Drake use features as a way to stay versatile and relevant.  Not to enrich himself.  And he lets artist he gives the feature to get all the funds from the song
J hus is basic why do yall like him 😅
hus smashed it but idk bout drake
Holy this might be the only song drake down ruined
Too good man 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The way dj akademiks will suck drakes meat after he delivered this mid ass verse
Drop a version without drake

🌊 🌊🌊Good Job Guys, what we needed for the summer👏🏽👏🏽
J hus ruined this. An afrobeat artist should have done his part
Can’t lie Drake ruined it. Mostack would’ve sounded sick on this
FINALLY!! AHHH We have missed you sir!
ITS CRAZYYYY
Now if only Drake didnt mail his verse in, it wouldve been even better
Omggggg
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 all the way from 🇲🇼 Malawi , this tune is fire 🔥
This tune 🔥🔥🔥 at 3:32
Dave and Central and now J Hus and Drake , summer this year is great fr🔥🔥
Woman…lemme be your woman…I can be your woman…Dojo should’ve been on this
My summer has officially started!😭
Might be the worst drake appearance thus far. And 6ix god is my guy. Damn.
Es interesante la pista con un ritmo tropical y Drake rapeando en ella, así mismo, agarra ritmo, le da su toque xon él sabe. J Hus me gusta como inicia como con un estribillo cantadito y al final se avinta un rapeo, de verdad que es interesante la combinación y muy buena propuesta. 👏🏻
not really feeling drake's verse but overall banger
Influence of Amapiano🇿🇦🇿🇦and Afrobeats🇳🇬🇳🇬
Drake is shit now
J hus is lame
Naaa drizzy going on
Drake ruined it
Come to the Lord and know the joy of having all your sins forgiven! There is nothing like it, true peace and joy. Ephesians 1:7 “In Jesus we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace.”
L drake
Terrible
Drake's part sounds like it was made by AI
Don't believe he really paid 500 k for that featuring 😂
can we get this tune edited with just hus on it
Drake wont bless j hus with a video. His did his UK charity work for the year. Drake is moving on making more global hits. He got a Bollywood sample coming in his next single.  Cant wait.
J hus ruined this song. A real african should have sung this song. Just saying 😢
I just know the Visuals are gonna be sik!
What was that Drake ? 😂 his verse sounds like a 3 year old kid playing with the mic.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Drake almost ruined it
drake was better than j hus
Drake
J hus is so basic. The UK hip hop sucks
Didnt feel the drake tunez here not needed
FAIRSSS
So far album looking like it's going to be mid
Drake don’t know the vibes
Drake needs to retire 😒
Think this “ controversial “ verse from Drake will help the tune some like it some don’t but its a talking point
🔥🔥
Come on 🔝🔝🔝⭐️⭐️⭐️
carried so hardddd
Made drake sound shit
Drake: *Yo I need some lyrics I’m going studio with Hus tomo*  Ghost Writer: *sorry I’m feeling sick I can’t do it*  Drake: 01:40
This song is so fyeeee😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥 Didnt need Drake at all!!!!!!!!! Banger!!!!!
Drake flopped

🗑️
Jesussss Drake Verse is heavenly 😳😳🤯

Summer tune no doubt about that I wanna hear this everywhere
When ever he drops a song,  it's an anthem.  I wish you can be on the O2 arena when the songs bangs.🎉🎉
🔥🔥
J Hus dun went in HAM on this banger right here, ight bangaa! I dont even care fr fr if j hus used *AUTHENTIC VIEWS* dawwt cawwm to get mad exposure to get goin, all them other artists be doin it too anyways
I love this.
Neil Drake aint no upcoming artist bitch
Should done a remix with M24 that would have rocketed
drake😐🚮
This song is growing on me stuck in my head 😭
what a mid song. corny overused beat, j hus comes in with a catchy chorus as usual but the rest kinda sucks
🔥
It’s off. It’s trash. Why y’all hyping this shit up. It’s off the beat and it’s not all of that.
Drake probably paid J Hus for that verse instead
This man j hus sucks drake carried my goodness
J huss enter the scene... 🔊
drake/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////new///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////2023/2060
Ngl drake ruined this for me
Track sucks
Beat is jarring AF
Get Drake off this track
Now you know who the best UK artist is!
M24 told her that bad man don’t dance
Average tune.
Banger 🔥
Vibes pon Vibes, l mean J Husss🔥
Mid
This fire 🔥🔥🔥
Drakes verse is dead.
Bangs differently
Drakes feature ruined the song icl

long johnson is mad
All perfect tell drake step in😂

Is it just me or does drake sound like an ai??
🔥🔥
Drake started of good and then ruined the song
Drake sounds like he’s just reading his lines, ruined the song
Shorty got the boom bomm🤩😍😘
🇬🇲🇬🇲
I like jhus verse
Jesus is coming, do you know where you will go when you die?  Instead of idolising certain man who wouldn't take a bullet for you who gave you life why not trust in Jesus who died for everyone even those who hate him. He died was buried and rose again three days later so that all who believe on Him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16.
That j his 3rd verse thou❤
Idk why everyone hating on drake part it goes hard 👌🏾
Needs a music video rn 🔥🔥🔥
Zelfs een gangsters als ik moet soms ook echt dansen de boogie of de jackson tell me what you like baby
Competition is feom Byron Messia Taliban for summer tune of the times
Definitely should have done this with out drake with his waffling
Een gangster zoals mij moet soms ook echt dansen
"Lilah Pi" shoutout
Why does drakes voice sound so shit in his newer releases? Is it the voice editing? Idk but big step down for me
J hus the only artist to make drake look bad
Drake ruined this song
Who told you
Deff gotta listen to drakes part a coupa times
drake couldve done way better he ruined the song
Love it ❤
Perfect summertime track🤝
Jhus made my man drake invisible in the track facts😅😂😂😂
This shit go crazy I know the vibes 😂
Drake ruined the song, sorry had to be said
drake sound like a bug fr
Take out  drake and add some1 else bro
I’ve tried listening to it multiple times Drakes part hasn’t grown on me In fact it pisses me off the more I listen to it
Imagine if Burna Boy or Wizkid was on a remix instead of drake🔥🔥🔥
Ai did it better
This Drake dude has potential 🤔
✅
Drake verse is too long
Woooooooooiiiiiii
Trash
Fuck Drake!! Aj T needs to jump on this!
ngl this song is not good.. the only thing that was decent was the hook at best. Drake's flow was just not it at all... not sure what he was going for, but his verse was out of place here. Missed out on a huge potential for an amazing collab like this to make it sound wavy.
Big W but cant lie drake in an afrobeat... i dont know
The real question is, whether or not this is better than the hillbillies by k-dot and baby keem.
Thanks Hus 👑 Hus 💜
OMG
Sorry but what the fuck is drake doing 🤔😂
All gambian gather here we show love to our artist ❤❤❤
https://youtu.be/CLyYOf9SHNU  j hus leaked  sextape
pls let chris brown do a remix he would have a better part then drake
Drake seriously ruins it going off beat
Badmon take anada sip and dance
Hus smashed the shit out of this one, Drake sounds like he's been edited into the track like a mash up, would of liked to see an artist like Jorja Smith get the feature, someone who gets the vibe. But overall decent
Big man just do a remix with nsg or Mostack please I beg 😭
Can't wait to see the video my artist you're really doing great may God guide and protect you ❤️🇬🇲💫
Interesting
Drake it's obvious that you don't care about the girl, just impress by the huge back side
Drake is going to be big after this 🔥
Are these man on beat or am I hearing a next ting
get drake off 😂😂😂
What was Drake doing 🤨
J hus fans are hateful. Like damn he just got a drake feature  and this how yall crabs in bucket act. Uncivilized 😅 Hate to say it negroes will always cut their nose to spite their face.
Drake doesn’t need to be In this
J hus he’s the most talented artist,he can surf 🏄‍♀️ any wave any Beat and killing,he’s a black  magic  beast, a proper King 🤴🏿 Kong,Drake was shit on this Tune,he’s crying too much,j Hus  he’s just in another Level  greetings From Portugal 🇵🇹 big man Thing
This new artist drake has a unique flow 😮 just keep it up and don't listen to hate
From Kenya with luv ❤🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
😂.. these are your heroes 😂😂
Yeah this song definitely needed drake
If tems replaced drake on this it would've been more💥💥
“ME & the money 💰 Had Matrimony”🎤
Turn that shi* up🥁
people asking “who is j hus” after he carried Drake 💀
Best Drake I’ve heard in years
His album is dropping soon watch

Dear Jhus As your fellow follows and listeners we would like you to consider also releasing an updated and improved version of this magical work of audio with the reduction of a Canadian.

This song did not need Drake
Drake’s part was f*cking awful 😂😂 ruined a good track
We need to see a music video
We needed a music video
Who the hell is J Hus?
Last verse from JHus went hard idk about the rest of the song but it'll probably grow on me if you throw it in some tiktoks I guess and have it go trending
love from Gambia 🇬🇲
Na drake ruined a perfectly good afrobeat 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
Fredo dropped a song today with title: Everybody knows... whats going on?

Burna needed that verse
Drake need to stay in his lane smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Drake AI is better.
Should have been hus by himself or  nsg on the track at least
I personally like Drake’s verse & I think in due time a lot of people will too. All it takes is one trip, a change of scenery… a hot & sunny destination with your homies or your partner to appreciate it lol
That is ai drake. Your not sly broke hus. Go steal some lucazade.
Drake 🔥🔥🔥
Drake’s verse is wackkkkk
This shit is so LUX !!! It just killed any song for the summer. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let one men u the best  J Hus the best ❤❤❤ who told u

Proberlu the worst  drake feature ever 😂

J hus is back with fire 😤😤🔥🔥
Proberlu the worst  drake feature ever 😂
Chapan Ndeyam Mr Hus 🔥🔥🔥🇬🇲

Drakes verse is shit
tune of the year trust me i know
Hus x champagne papi🔥🔥
AI Drake be like:
If y’all think this song is good go list to (mention me ft rema)
Best uk collab drake has spat a verse on! He only goes that hard on big tings he knows j hus is a big deal!
This song hit the soul🤌🏿🔥
Simply Incredible. Wild vibes. On repeat, hard to rinse
Cah blimey this is catchy asf
Sounds the same as every summer song... Boring.. Drakes last album last summer was king
Why does this guy have to bang juj, I can’t listen to this without conviction
Drakes verse is not it
# pedogram
Drake verse is weak af
Should have added burna boy instead of drake
Summers here 😎
i love j hus and love drake even more but this is shite i’ll be honest wi u
Uk is such bad vibes everyone hates on Drake verse when he collabs with a uk artist. Why can't we praise both guys he's the ONLY one that really blew up the uk scene and made it global. Uk fans, we should be more respectful and appreciate what Drakes done for our scene
Why is drake running from the beat 😅
Ohhhhh myyyyyyy
❤❤❤❤
Just drop drake
💃
Didn’t need drake on it 😢
Banger
Skepta would've rip this beat apart
Dammmmmm 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Drake has killed the vibe on this one, sounds like he’s speaking with a stammer
🎹🎹🎹🎹
unpopularity opinion - drake ruined it ⁉️
bro drake made it shtta but good song in general
drake is so bad on this
This song should’ve been on Honestly Nevermind or More Life it’s a great song that gives a summer dancehall vibe!!!!
Drake's Verse was a**, let's be real
Drake is so off beat
This gotta be ai drake
Giving him a second chance
Can we get the j hus only version
Truthfully, I didn’t like this tune. J Hus ft Drake shoulda been a mad ting but it’s not unfortunately
Proper Afrobeats tune.✨
Drake ruined this 😂
Drake sucked on this
Reminds me of Skepta- Rolex Sweep
I Feel For J Hus… Brazy Riddim With Energy… Drake On The Other  Hand Too LAZY!
It's mad to think that people think of drakes feature as more relevant than the actual talent, the world is full of bots like twitter 😒 if you think drake is better than jHUS, YOURE LIVING IN A FANTASY, DRAKE IS MY STANK ASS STALE LAUNDRY THATS JUST BEGINNING TO GET UP AND WALK BY ITSELF, IT NEEDS A WASH AND FABRIC CONDITIONER TO GET A NEW SOUNDWAVE
Honestly drakes part dragging 😴👎🏾
Just cause am not jealous does not mean I don't care it's not fair
I love j hus and drake.. but am I the only one who things j hus smashed it and drake was completely out of sync?!
This track was a mistake, go buck g herbo, when was the last time drake held a wap.  Kano has white man holding his guns, #flagrant podcast discovered, you are in different categories of leauges, nines just dropped Tony soprano 2 calendar, dave and cench sprinter and here's you with the politically safe Canadian who charts with no seasoning on his anorexic verse, DEAD. FAM Delete it and let it blow from its implosion of rare type beats.  PRODUCT RECALL.  Infact fuck it you should be making a album with hit boy X big hit, DID YOU SEE AVELINOS TRACK WITH MY MAN!!!  You need a resolution to your beef ouside of music & a side helping of brotherly non egoic energy that has class and skill, man flipped off kanye, you could swerve drake this song was a violation to your discography fam I'm ashamed for you...   Don't let tired ass mfs leech your relevancy, you're undiscovered Micheal Jordan, don't you fucking forget that J HU$$$-LA STOP THIS CLOUTY FOLLOW THE TREND SHIT, FOLLOW YOUR life STORY its better like modie in topboy or... SULIMAN THE GULLY MAN, ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FUNNY FAM?!
Drake fucked it up 😂😂
❤Drake inspired me to go all in  with my music . He was just like me , an artist trying to get heard .And now he's on top. It's happening for me , and I'm not stopping when it does !❤
Drake fighting the beat
09/06/23 16:44 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Hus need to give this back to Drake so he can redo his verse
is there a way to make a j hus only version
Drake should of went harder. Cant be one of the biggest artist ever and give us that .. j hus, still got it though! Bad man 🔥
Drake didn’t want this  His verse is of
nah drake actually ruined this tune.
This was so underwhelming, drake ruined your song fam, whyyy, man was an investor for top boy not in it cos his prescence was irrelevant to the story, similarly here his verse sounds sloppy, did his ghost writer not count the bars mans singing like dead cat  I'm a buisiness man to tho, this song will make a few million on streams and on ill contextually related shorts with no relation to this subject mater but it also wont be in your best releases, your daily duppy slapped harder, you wanna buck gangsters with a gun on the hip go buck gherbo in chiraq, your creativity has seen better heights and avenues man, I'm here for the journey j, not hot u for the mistakes but this was an L.  For artistry this was not your assignment..  But making money is a lifestyle this will be relevant this summer then its chucked in the corner, this was your n-dubs #number1, but you came 74th and noone wanted more than u on a track. Take a note from dave, cench, nines and potter  Do that and it will buss more I bet u, people want your story in the uk 🇬🇧 not the 6 in Canada.  Drake is Canadas Taylor swift the sooner you all realise that the better, he might make stuff sound good but he's influencing our culture like US' fb been stealing our data, drake is meta quest 3 MADE OF PLASTIC and Taylor swift is the apple vision pro MADE OF METAL, but problem is everyone sees that culture as floored, AND ITS A FAT PAIR OF GLASSES ON YOUR FACE.   NOONE ASKED FOR THIS META OR APPLE, TAKE DRAKE AND TAYLOR AND DROP THEM IN THE OCEAN LIKE BIN LADEN, THEYRE marketing sluts.  Are u j hus? know yourself gun onna hip man, if you need money start an ai dropshipping Shopify and employ your mandem, don't employ drake the snake are u mad cus what are u doing...
summa 2k23 finally started😶‍🌫️
Why did drake just ramble at the end of his verse ?
Drake
J hus goes hard but drake ruins it so bad 😂
J hus just saved the summer
fire...Drake was floating.
Crazy how he comes back and on a track with drake already 👀
Which Kain sweet song be this?? 😱😱
YOOOOOOO
This can’t be mixed right, Drake sounds out of pocket, it’s slightly off, almost like the verse was on a different beat previously.
Fok😭🔥🔥🔥
Drake could have did better than that tbh! But this song a vibe
drake went so crazy😭
Who produced this masterpiece
As m
Drake
Drake sounds more like AI singing it
Take drake of this 😢

Drake in my Top 5 but he wasn’t needed on this track NSG would’ve been perfect
This is the j hus we needed also drake to
🇰🇪
This mad fire they both killed for the summer vibes
🔥
Drakes verse seems like such a throw away. Dude was not feeling this. 😂😂😂 Got a damn check and half assed his verse. Yikes DRAKE! 🫵😡
BANGER
Uk ain’t for drake
"your backside is so fit"  Someone help this man with the lingo please
Might blow due to the names on the song other than that the track is wack
J Hus with the summer vibe, let’s go, gasseddddd
I love JHus and drake but this is straight trash.....
Drake shouldn’t be here, he’s not needed

Drake wrecked the song
M HUNCHO IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN ALL THESE POM POMS LEVELS ABOVE JUST AINT BLACK THATS THE PROBLEM
🔥🔥🔥 toooo coldddd summer tune
This shit trash fr
My boy J hus is finally back 🇱🇨 🔥 🔥
Drake attempting to be British "Your backside is so fit"
You two together i was expecting some fire, this is not it idgaf what anyone says all rent boys.
I just can't get into UK rappers. The accent is...uhh. No disrespect at all. I just can't take it seriously. It's a cute song tho. Definitely summer vibes.
People dont reliase drakes line "touch my forehead chest right shoulder then right side" is a prayer sign and made for tiktok
Sorry but drake's verse was whack asf
Summer looks bright
Funky House 2023!
♥️
Unpopular opinion: would’ve been better without drake

Jhus really just spun drake on a track
The biggest Rapper on the planet Drizzy Drake💙❤
Touch my forhead chest left shoulder the right side praying my brother are good outside 🔥
Better than ur last demonic song
This is the one 🔥🔥🔥
Hus was better than Drake on this. Drake is getting outdated.
Idc what any1 says but drakes Verse was not all that it was mid but J Hus did 100 times better tbh I don't think he needed Drake feature not like it improved song maybe just more views but that's all
Drake part is dead
Who told u Badman don’t dance !
Lit shit but Drake verse too long
J Hus never dissapoints, what a banger🔥

https://youtu.be/JJS5JNQf5Qo
https://youtu.be/JJS5JNQf5Qo
Drake just pls leave this tune 2 J HUS
Hus never lost his touch...and the last verse? what a way to finish this monstrous tune 💯💯
Drakes hard and all that but he needs to jump off the track
Drake started off good but flopped the ting. Hus is the goat
drake dropped a stinker!
im single to mingel 😅😅😅
Summer is saved
This is y’all’s goat?
❤❤❤❤
“Who told you?” That’s a bar😂😂 0:20
Nsg needs to be on this
This will prolly be a hit but am not feeling it...apart from that 3rd verse
Bc ye kya kya aa jaata h feed mai
Tell drake to stop that accent 🤣
Drake is an ai
🤯🤯🤯🤯
I’m Highly disappointed in you J Hus
Just take this down from the internet, it’s hurting our ears in U.K
Man... Drake ruined this track for me.
Big Hus fan but i aint feeling this, the chicks probably will tho
Is it just me or did drake spend half of his verse off beat? I’d remove him and go solo, tune deserves more.
Can you do another version without Drake????
Back in full effect
The world needs a J hus and wizkid track. Fuck drake
FIREEEEE
Trash tbh
Drake ruined the song
Starts of banging with J Hus.. and then, well.. the rest is history 🤦🏾‍♂️

Drake is so off
Hus is so versatile, best artist in the UK no doubt.
Someone i beg pls edit this track put "Hustler Baby, baby baby" & "Ooohhh myyy" at the beginning. Next swap Drake out for a Dave AI or MoStack AI 😂
[Intro] Mm, mm Mm, mm Yeah, yeah  [Chorus: J Hus] Who told you bad man don't dance? Who told you gangsters don't dance? Even with a wap on my hip, I dance Bad man, take another sip and dance Two left feet, don't trip and dance The gyal want me, I might give her a chance Give her a look, she give me a glance She wore that tight dress just to enhance  [Verse 1: J Hus] Your likkle bum-bum Never seen you before, where you come from? You got a fat pum-pum, I got a long Johnson I know I never met you at random This must be destiny, that's why you're next to me You feel like ecstasy This must be destiny, that's why you're next to me You feel like ecstasy  [Chorus: J Hus] Who told you bad man don't dance? Who told you gangsters don't dance? Even with a wap on my hip, I dance Bad man, take another sip and dance Two left feet, don't trip and dance The gyal want me, I might give her a chance Give her a look, she give me a glance She wore that tight dress just to enhance  [Verse 2: Drake] Touch my forehead, chest, left shoulder Then right side, pray my brothers are good outside I know the vibes, I know the vibes You're the one, girl, stop rollin' eyes I find love and it slowly dies So Lilah Pi, don't make my eye cry Let me hold your controlla, I am not one of these controlling guys I want you to touch road with the girls-dem, and socialize Enjoy your life, your backside is so fit, it opens eyes I know the vibes, I know the vibes Just 'cause I'm not jealous doesn't mean I don't care, that's just not fair I knew you were trouble, I was unprepared If I were married, this might turn a scandalous affair Trouble is there, trouble is there Trouble been right there, trouble is there Trouble gon' find me anywhere, trouble gon' find me, bubble and wine-y Ayy, trouble gon' find me, trouble'll find me anywhere Trouble'll find me, trouble will find me It's okay, girl, bubble and wine-y They want me dead, but don't remind me Both hands around you, it's not tiny  [Chorus: J Hus] Who told you bad man don't dance? Who told you gangsters don't dance? Even with a wap on my hip, I dance Bad man, take another sip and dance Two left feet, don't trip and dance The gyal want me, I might give her a chance Give her a look, she give me a glance She wore that tight dress just to enhance  [Verse 3: J Hus] If you come close, I'ma explode Gyal there carryin' a heavy load Whine your waist in a semi-circle Gettin' money fast, man's not a turtle Had to go through so many hurdles Block's so hot like inferno Had some issues that were internal Had a mad life, I could write a journal But I can't lie, I love the journey Me and the money had matrimony All the ratchet gyals wan' pattern up All the posh gyals get ratchet for me If you love me, you're clappin' for me If you throw it, I catch it, trust me Gyal come from far, even upsuh I want the best, not comme ci, comme ça  [Chorus: J Hus] Who told you bad man don't dance? Who told you gangsters don't dance? Even with a wap on my hip, I dance Bad man, take another sip and dance Two left feet, don't trip and dance The gyal want me, I might give her a chance Give her a look, she give me a glance She wore that tight dress just to enhance

Kick drake off this track
A.I Drake sounds too real, banger fr fr
Let me tell you this tune a summer destroyer
UK is taking over the summer again the world is healing
Drake gave this bum a verse. Be grateful no one in mainstream hip hop pays attention to uk hip hop.   And j hus fans hating on drake. Saying the verse is whack and he aint saying anything.  Really guys.  Mxm screw you uk people.  Hope this bum j hus  stays only hot in the Uk. Thats what you cornballs deserve
People say drake aint saying muxh. When he starts the verse with a prayer for him and his family.  And he talks about lilah.
Nah I prefer AI Drake from now on. 🚮
Omg the guy who made did u see song😭😭😭
Jheeeeeze!
Should have been J hus and Mostack on this track
COLDDDDD
Why Drake sound like he was sipping lean with Lil Wayne before he recorded this verse mans sounding mad raspy
J hus been massive in the UK but it’s time for the world to know him and with a feature from drake this will happen 🕺
Y’all just love to hype anything nowadays. Proper medi track. Ain’t no summer banger.
HE NEVER LOST IT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She put on that dress jus to enhance
Get drake off the song and put nsg or mo stack that would of been cold
the collab we didnt know we needed but banged
jhus opps gonna be mad at this one
“You got a fat pum pum I got a long Johnson” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
J hus got robbed for this feature
J His mum told him to take his little brother along and that’s it 🤷🏽‍♂️
Drake sounding like an AI
Po!! Po!!! POOOOO!!!!   ALL SHOTS   GUNSHOTS!!!   Mad Vibe....
Yo put out this with a better feauter😂

Afrobeatz 🙌🏾🙌🏾🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬…you can never go wrong with it
Actually think drake ruins it lol
Drake ruined the track
Sounds like A.I Drake 😂
Serious question: is there a better artist than JHus in the UK? Reply with your suggestions
Otherwise dope song🔥
am i the only one that’s not feelin it
Uk black people salty drake is on this. But yall hating on drake is like cutting your nose to spite your face. Drake is exposing the rest of the world to yall uk hip hop. People aint checking for yall artist or music.  So instead on hating on drake. See this as yall music and culture spreading. Drake is shinning a light on UK hip hop.  And honestly we didn't even know yall exist
Drake tried so hard to steal this track but J Hus said Who told you”
Man what the hell happened to drake. He used to be the best rapper in the world. How he’s just mumbling a load of bs
Is it just me or drizzy just chatting
Wish it was J on his own tbh
Gambia💯💥💥💥
Drakes verse is just 😬 but still a banger
I aint gonna lie, Drake's verse was unecessary.
Haters hate. But drakes just doing charity work helping your guy. Say thank you dont hate. This is the hottest j hus will ever be
All the haters. Lets be real j hus is nobody to the rest of the world.  Yall so ungrateful without drake this tune would only be tune of the year in london.  The rest of the world wouldn't know about this song if not for drake.  So ungrateful
J Hus is pulling the power moves off the top shelf! big song
Drake Hus 🎉
Bro is having a great comeback!!!
Drake ruined it
Icl drakes verse was shit
J Hus without Drake was even better!
I rate Hus but am I the only one who thinks this is basic considering the artists and the opportunity to make something classic 🤷🏾‍♂️
anada banger
My man blew a cheque to get this feature
Drake aka mister yellow nail.. This tune did not need you. Typical drake to jump on what's new and ruin it with his yellow jaimacan/afrobeat draining voice. J hus killed it by himself
Didn't need Drake on this, preferred J Hus rocking it on his ones. Nonetheless it's a hit, good job J Hus 🖤👏🏽
🥶🍋
What is drake saying?? 😂😂😂
Never seen such ANiMOSiTY  https://youtu.be/9ALeRm-9XMM
It’s time for J hus now hit the like button🤘🎉🎉
Imagine j Hus ft Naira Marley , how will it sound 🔥🔥

Drake is different you guys just don’t understand it
Dumb arse lyrics
summer anthem 🔥
Hus better matches the vibe of the song
How’s he done that then… 3 years missing and he gets a Drake collab, fair play
Why’s everyone hyping this up ? I was expecting some real heat when I came on here ngl it’s extremely mediocre
song of the year 🏆
I was unprepared 🚀🙆🏾‍♂️
Hus couldve done this joint solo.

drake never fails to dissappint

This song needs more recognition 😤🔥
🇯🇲🇹🇹🔥
Nice start to the summer
I’m proud of bro NO CAP East LDN stand up 🆙🔥🔥🔥🔥
Song doesn’t hit honestly
THE GOAT OF RAP and drake 🔥🔥
THIS SOUNDS LIKE AI DRAKE
Fuck... I was tryna be low key this summer....
Drake really had to come in and ruin the vibe
After all the AI Drake vids I think real Drakes verse is dead
Ugly man inn'it
I love Drake and especially his songs like Controlla and One Dance where he’s on his dancehall vibes but this verse wasn’t it😂 sounded so off beat for most of his verse and I don’t think his verse was needed on this song! Usually every Drake feature is crazy but bro repeated the “trouble will find me” part about 10+ times in different ways like it was creative when it’s really filler lol.
Why this shit so off beat though 🔥
Weakk
Vibes 💯 🔥
need a version without drake plz lmao
Hus too talented. I hope he reaches his full potential and dont go missing for another couple years
NAH BRO WTF THIS IS CRAZY
Bcause of drake he is officially back

Petition to get drake removed from this song and replaced with burna boy / NSG or anyone else
Ah yes the soundtrack for this summers 5am argument with a drunk potential one night stand outside a closing kebab shop as your phone battery dwindles at 1% and the taxi driver wants money up front.
Drake got bodied

🔥
Summer vibes 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who told you badman don’t dance, who told you gangsters don’t dance🔥

When Gambia meet Canada you know that’s a fire 🔥🇬🇲🇨🇦
*J HUS & DRAKE!!!* 🔥🔥🔥
Who told ya'll that reeeaaallll baaaadmaaan don't dance?!
harddd
j hus definitely carried the tune, drake had a good verse but why does he have to repeat trouble 10+ times man its too troublesome the tune is cold gotta give it to the reigning king
Drake fell off since 2018 smh
toooo fckin hard
Drake is dead on this. J hus solid 🙌🏾
Nah where was drake going with that ffs
حلوة منك يا دريك
Jah did.
song is a banger but boy this nigga drake was waffling and rambling on this wtf is blud on about
Aubrey you shoulda sat this one out buddy, shit was ass
Drake sounds zesty
Drake you should really stick to R&B cuz your rapping is way off rhythm 👍🏿
generic, every summer we have this type of beat and this song it's better only with J Hus, doesn't need at all Drake here, it's only for hype, a lot of other artists is making summer songs better than this one
J hus got a top flow screw & brew block popping the old album is top as well
We’d make a hit https://youtu.be/gdi3vyGiVQk
SUMMER VIBEZ IS FINALLY OUT ❤
Yh this slaps 💥🔥
the fisherman is truly back 💥💥💥
AFROBEATS to the world!!
J Hus and Drake? So epic🫶🫶🫶
Summer anthem. Cannot wait for this to be played everywhere. 😭😭
#HIT.🎯 🔥🔥🔊🔊🔥🔥🔊🔊🔥🔥
Let’s be honest them drake vocals didn’t match the beat ,j hus probably changed the beat and kept the drake verse he could’ve left it out, you can tell his 2nd verse was probably added months later when the song was first recorded.
Drake spazzed on this too 🔥 summer banger for sure
he didn’t have to have drake on it bruh
A Collaboration that was always going to happen
Ready for the whole album 🫡
🔥🔥🔥
Remy Ma told us “gangstas don’t dance they boogie”
Who told you such nonsense dance 🕺
shout out j hus for givin the next generation of young artists a chance
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Only J hus can carry drake ⭐️
Can I get verse wit just drake part
m24 somewhere punching the air
🔂🔂🔂🔂
Jhus and drake both r ma fav artists but I’m disappointed tbh.this record could’ve been a hit fr but drake messed it up and jhus’s wasn’t that impressive
Oh madness this is a contender big track
THIS GONNA GO CRAZY THIS SUMMER! 🔥
Drake, did you did Kendrick Lamar again? Why y’all keep taking shots at each other? Just drop a diss track at this point. I can’t believe you just said that
Who told you badman don't darnce!? Hus is too cold with it!!;
Hhhwiho why is drake offbeat
Saving summer
Every chick on someone else’s boat will be playing this all summer 😂💯🤷‍♂
But can we appreciate how creative drake is with his rhythm in this one - the delays the polyrhythms etc omg I love it :)
Who knew throwin drke on ya tune ruins it
J hus outshines him to
AHHHHH MANNNN🎉
Who thinks this shoulda been better if it was J Hus’s single
Gonna have this on repeat this summer
🔥🔥🔥
The way Drake was the one to ruin the track
Drake flopped on this.
Song of the year  They both held their own
Drake solddddddd

Song of the summer confirmed

He needs to remix this song with NSG or Mostack asap 😭
I think I say this for all of Kenya 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪this is a hitt🔥🔥🔥 and as a Drake fan, this is comedic, a legit conversation turned hit🥂🥂🥂 J Hus ripped this apart from open to close. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Any other artist would have killled it instead of drake

Anyone feel like drake was weak on this joint?

Idk if burna boy would of suited it better than drake but still a anthem
Last verse sounds like Not3s cl

Did not need Drake on that. Should’ve called for NSG!
Was having a convo at work today about how j hus is the best in the country, and justified it by saying he always has the ear of the streets and people wait for his music and he does all that without features…. 2 days later ft drake
She wore a tight dress just to enhance 🫡🍑

Sick tuneeee
i love these two but this aint it, not the vibe i want from either of them  but i guess it is something new from Hus
J hus controls the summer
Hussss thiss shiii bussssinnnnn
The duo we didnt know we needed
Drake  and J Hus have such complimentary flows and deliveries. They are both great in their own ways too but hearing them work together is always a treat. I think the fanbases are generally really similar too which is nice to see likeminded people collide every time they collab. I hope someday I can gather even a tenth of the amount of fans with the perspectives that theses two fan bases have for my own music. Truly unmatched energy🔥
🔥🔥
Gives me lean and bop vibes
Jhus most overrated uk artist 🙌
As Mo Stock said, J Hus J Hus J Hus J Hus, Free Jigga J, J Fucking Hus
This shit lit🔥🔥
other people bought a house
I’m getting this idea that trouble is ganna find Drake
🇬🇲🇬🇲🇬🇲🇬🇲

not sure about this drake verse icl
Nice jam
Once again Drake switching ethnicities on a track SOMEONE STOP HIM 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1,439. i stated many years ago santan dave, jhus, stormzy are the triumvirate of uk music. nothings changed but the order. jhus now commanding the aforementioned kings. jhus is also a man of honour because he returned the luV drake showed him in ‘019.   the influence of Jamaican riddim’s undeniable. jhus really is dat guy
this is more like it 🤞🏾
Garbage 🗑️
Drake's Fans let's gather in here🔥🔥🌎leave ❤️ and pass
Song of the summer already
JHus fr brought this back we forgive him for it's crazy

The moment I heard Drake 😨😨😩😫😫🕺🕺🕺💃💃
LYRICS:   Mm, mm Mm, mm Yeah, yeah  [Chorus: J Hus] Who told you bad man don't dance? Who told you gangsters don't dance? Even with a wap on my hip, I dance Bad man, take another sip and dance Two left feet, don't trip and dance The gyal want me, I might give her a chance Give her a look, she give me a glance She wore that tight dress just to enhance  [Verse 1: J Hus] Your likkle bum-bum Never seen you before, where you come from? You got a fat pum-pum, I got a long Johnson I know I never met you at random This must be destiny, that's why you're next to me You feel like ecstasy This must be destiny, that's why you're next to me You feel like ecstasy  [Chorus: J Hus] Who told you bad man don't dance? Who told you gangsters don't dance? Even with a wap on my hip, I dance Bad man, take another sip and dance Two left feet, don't trip and dance The gyal want me, I might give her a chance Give her a look, she give me a glance She wore that tight dress just to enhance   [Verse 2: Drake] Touch my forehead, chest, left shoulder Then right side, pray my brothers are good outside I know the vibes, I know the vibes You're the one, girl, stop rollin' eyes I find love and it slowly dies So Lilah Pi, don't make my eye cry Let me hold your controlla, I'm not one of the controllin' guys I want you to touch road with the girlsdem, and socialize Enjoy your life, your backside is so fit, it opens eyes I know the vibes, I know the vibes Just 'cause I'm not jealous doesn't mean I don't care, that's just not fair I know you were trouble, I was unprepared If I were married, this might turn a scandalous affair Trouble is there, trouble is there Trouble been right there, trouble is there Trouble gon' find me anywhere, trouble gon' find me, bubble and wine-y Ayy, trouble gon' find me, trouble'll find me anywhere Trouble'll find me, trouble will find me It's okay, girl, bubble and wine-y They want me dead, but don't remind me Both hands around you, it's not tiny  [Chorus: J Hus] Who told you bad man don't dance? Who told you gangsters don't dance? Even with a wap on my hip, I dance Bad man, take

J Hus] If you come close, I'ma explode Gyal there carryin' a heavy load Whine your waist in a semi-circle Gettin' money fast, man's not a turtle Had to go through so many hurdles Block's so hot like inferno Had some issues that were internal Had a mad life, I could write a journal But I can't lie, I love the journey Me and the money had matrimony All the ratchet gyals wan' pattern up All the posh gyals get ratchet for me If you love me, you clap it for me If you throw it, I catch it, trust me Gyal come from far, even up star I want the best, not comme ci, comme ça  [Chorus:

Drake ruined this, he needs to stop pretending to be from the Carribbean or Africa, he’s nearly 40, he can’t keep doing this shit 😂
Summer Hussssss❤
j hus > dave
drake ruined it
who told you
all those fire emojis are bots right?
Sound of Drakes voice irritates me a bit 🤔
J giving this underground artist a feature proves that he has a kind and generous heart. my idol.
mix is woeful
WHO TOLD YOU BADMAN DONT DANCE🔥
Hes backkkkkkkk 😤
Juju J  🔥🔥🔥 The king back  Ahhhh mannnn
Broooooooooooooooo
Major moves !!! Can’t wait for J Hus to announce he’s remixing the song “Dupe - Balling” 🤞🤞🤞🤞
WHATTTTTTTT!!! No way this not being ever green even after years !!
Shows J Hus true power, bro hasn’t been dropping music in the longest then can comeback with a Drake feature. Reminders
