I remember
I mean...the place is called "Waverly" and that whole area of Tennessee is literally covered in little tributaries of local rivers, lakes and streams. Just look at it on a map and you'll see what I'm talking about.
Here after what happened in Texas. I think this video needs to be shown everywhere because people don't understand what a flash flood is
The "why" really still is such a mystery?
When crest
😢😢😢😢😢Nooooo!!!
Waverly what State?
where's Waverly
These were man made... how many people died?
Blah blah blah MICHELLE BABY FATHER about to get CROWNED for being the DUMBEST SCAMMER on the PLANET 😂😂😂😂I Promise folks Im gon be the LAST person those people ever TARGET again in life for MONETARY GAIN lol Thsts right TRACEY lol Im abouy to DEMILISH their whole coven in court bc NYS gon pay for this shyt TRUST ME THEY'RE GONNA PAY
WHY??? He rhetorically asks… Climate Warming and its consequences has been predicted by NASA scientist since 1988!!! Matthew 13:16-17 “But you have God-blessed eyes—eyes that see! And God-blessed ears—ears that hear!
believe in climate change now?
Michael’s a good man. The caliber of his personage makes him a great neighbor most anywhere.
What state is Waverly in?
Ten minutes and your whole life and town is changed forever.
My heart aches for all of western NC.
Prayers and thoughts won't cure global warming.  Only a smaller population using less fossil fuels will make any difference.
Your in our Prayers!!!
Enough with the prayers.  They obviously don't help - before or after.  This report misses some facts:  how far are they from the river?  Has it flooded before - naturally not this badly but did he have water in his front yard before?
Wot caused this .? Haarp
What people in the government and there family make lots of money from this the land is going to get taken for mining kamilla Harris's husband company will make billions
Where is Waverly?
Not everybody knows where Waverly is .  Don't have a clue on the state,  sounds like the south.
It's called global climate change we caused it and nobody believes that they have any responsibility for it so we're all dying from climate change and it's the Apocalypse you can miss rationalize at any one of a million stupid ways but the fact is it's climate change and it's not going to stop because we fucked up. the human race has been asking itself what's causing all these planetary changes for decades when we already know humans live in denial and die like flies for their sheer stupidity
Very dangerous 😳!
Samaritan's Purse accepting Bitcoin,Etherium and other crypto currency donations.
That had t6be crazy to kuve through, to look out and think ok the water is getting high and then a few minutes later knee deep and sweeping vehicles away. Had to be a scary time to know you have almost no options.
Man, he is a good soul. Praying for everyone that has been affected by this flood.
Yeesh thats just terrifying 🥺
Switch to Geico and you can save up to 16% if you bundle your Renters and Car insurance!!!
came from dam relsaed not a tsunami bcoz there not any near the ocean
of course it looks dam water spillage.
Why didn't that guy park his truck in  the back next to the other one behind him on higher ground? Blue book will only pay blue book value, anyway, right?. And thasif almost nothing  if you had an old truck with high mileage and wanted to replace it.
Prayers for all
Water has a frequency n the uuu are making moves
I think they opened the flood gates on purpose
Thr GOV caused this mess....
What state is this located?
Unbelievable!
Many Blessings and Healing love
What State is Waverly in?
Anyone else see the shadowy figure at the 1:36 mark?
You bet w are praying for you good folks. God bless you.
yes it came up super fast
How did the camera continue to have power?  Edit: my boys accent is crazy
All by design.  The Mining will begin as soon as they can get the Equipment in.  Start making some Money.
Just think.. all that money that the democrats send to other countries could be used to help protect our own people and property.
Biden will help
Damn😔
Much Love to this gentleman and all his relatives and neighbors... We are bearing witness and wide awake. 🫀🦖
Far away from the coast and get this much of water destroying everything 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
bloody haarp
Bet he will buy a new huge truck to continue climate ARMAGEDDON
Weather manipulation, Geoengineering. Chem trailing. Trying to control the weather and they either screwed up or it was purposeful.
Wow that is really scary how fast the water rose and the power of it moving cars and trucks in less than 10 min it became very dangerous. I'm glad he and his family are ok . Helene was a different animal due to the track it took how fast it moved as a storm system and how powerful it's winds were. Usually you are glad a storm moves fast so it doesn't sit over you for hours dumping rain and causing damage but the strength of Francine combined with it moving at 30 mph and it's track caused unusually widespread damage across several states passing thru vulnerable areas like Asheville and others.
So so sorry
WE ARE IN A MAGNETIC REVERSAL here on earth right now and its going to end with a cataclysmic event known as a micro nova which is a civilization ending event,  we have less than 20 years before the micro nova hits earth,  prepare yourselves,  youtube suspicious observers and the earth disaster is coming
Omg
Loosing people is such a serous reality. Why are there not cross lines in floods for people who need to be reacued??? How come fireman and emergency response cannot devise a chance for some. I know it happens fast alot. I just feel we can do more.
This is the outcome of GLOBAL WARMING!   Exactly what the scientists warned us about. This is no surprise.  Jeannine
6" of moving water can take you off your feet. Water weighs 3500 lbs per cubic yard, 3 ft x 3 ft x 3 ft. It doesnt matter how strong you are or how good a swimmer you are.
Damn! 10 minutes!
Its a alien 👽 ! Jesus' Christ
🙏
Amazing footage. That guys voice sounds so familiar.
😰😰😰😰
Hopes and thoughts are going to fix this thing. We need to get serious about it.
Amazing. God bless him and all suffering from this tragedy!
CNN said this was disinformation.
God Bless! Sweet Lord! Pray for my neighbors in our mountains!
What a nice man.
The Master's Voice Prophecy answers the  question why..... Probably Americans should go listen to her on a serious note.
Black carolina guy that sounds like a white guy must be a sundown town cause @ night albinos can't right so if it sounds right you must be white
Really? You don't understand that GLOBAL WARMING is real? You probably voted for RUMP. He doesn't believe it either.
I am so glad this man and his family were safe  Prayers for everyone especially after the recent hurricane also.🙏❤️
God bless this man nd his family!!!
I’m just glad that Trump has proved that climate change is a hoax, otherwise we would all be fucked
This is from three years ago....
That's just crazy fast so sorry for everyone's loses in this tragedy.
He lost family? Bull shit
Same thing happens in china
When the federal government opened the flood gates. Dam them dams are crazy
Climate change is what is causing this.
Why!  That is the question.  Where did all this water come from?  That hurrican had been landed for a thousand miles before this happened.  Where is the reason?
Life is short and precious….
Excellent interview.
Unbelievable
😮😢
Did they really break a levee to save a damn and did they warn people prior
Glad hes ok, feel bad for his cousins that didn't make it. I need to donate, but idk a legit place. Any guesses any one?
If one pays attention as they go through life, they learn to spot good people by the spirit they have. This man is a fine person. He doesn't just portray a good spirit; he has it down to his bones. I wish he was my neighbor. As with all the people that have been devastated by the storm, he and his family are in my prayers.
OMG another one mentioning prayers 🙄?????? Prayers wont help you so stooooooooooop it eiht praying yada yada yada. Dont you think your cousins werent praying before they died?? They were and still died!!!
Noah's Ark Flooding  ;*(
That's crazy, the footage started at 10.01 and ended 10.11. All that in only ten minutes.
Amazing!!!😮
Where is fema ?
Prayers and faith
Praying 🙏
Shocking how quickly it rose
OMG IM SO HAPPY TO SEE SUCH BEAUTIFUL SOULS ON HERE HELPING EACH OTHER BUT IM ALSO SO VERY VERY ANGRY AT THE PEOPLE ARISGUSTED AT WHAT IM SEEING AND HEARING ON YOUTUBE SHORTS AND T6BTHAT OBAMA OPRAH HILLARY AND KAMALAS YOUNG
From now on people need to evacuate when they hear that a major storm is coming. Don't let your pride cause you to lose your life. They're getting better and better at predicting these storms. Better to feel silly and safe as opposed to feeling like a fool or much worse because you stayed.
10 minutes - that's all it took
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Cloud seeding caused the extra flooding.  Please look up "cloud seeding"
Democraps turned the fema account into a slush fund for wetbacks.....no relief com8ng
Wow...
What caused it , he said it , this wasn’t natural
🙏🙏
Answering stupid questions from a Reporter: How do you feel now that you lost everything? What do you take from all this? Stupid questions from mindless reporters!
How frightening.  I’m so sorry for his loss of family members and property.
What caused this?   Our collective fossil fuel addiction...
Ever American citizen should be at your local govt office demanding resignations.  And the reason its so bad is not climate change, its manmade change...you know, the evil side of manmade.
What's the flashing red light on the left of the screen near the end of the video?...what caused that red light?
What's under the water is a garbage river.  There's no way to stand up in it unless you want to have your legs kicked out from below by junk tumbling along the bottom. You can only go with the flow and hope you don't get pinned.
god bless
Basically an inland tsunami.
Only NINE minutes between first appearance on his lawn and entire neighborhood flooded and cars being carried off.  Do you have a route you can follow out of your home to a safe spot from where you're sitting right now within less than 9 minutes?
May his cousins Rest In Peace.
Dam. That’s terrifying
what is going on
Government caused it
The video showing the speed of the water rising gives perspective on how little time people had to find a safe area - IF they could.  Devastating.
Where did the water come from ?
Global warming anyone
I mean you watch the time code and it’s shocking, how fast it came in.
It literally looks like a tsunami!😱
I think about you a lot. I trust that you guys are going to pull through. ❤❤🇿🇦🇿🇦
This Gentleman is so positive after all he's lost!
My heart and prayers go out to all of them
My heart is broken for all of these great people.
I’m from south Florida and hurricanes aren’t new for me. I’ve seen wind and water damage, tornadoes and ocean waves smashing buildings but I’ve never experienced flooding like what western North Carolina experienced from this hurricane
Aweee man , you can hear his voice . Shit sucks man! All these people are scared for life , you only see this in movies but when it happens in real life it's just sad .
Help the flood victims. CLOSE THE BORDER NOW. Stop sex trafficking our children. Come on people. Fight for justice and vote these TRAITOR S out and put yhe 🐊🐊in jail. 3000000 dead American Citizens each day the border is open. all colors sll classes. Children being raped and traumatized. This is insane!! Where is our leadership??
From 10:01 to 10:11...wow that is fast. It really puts it all in perspective.
Damn within 5 minutes u wouldn’t have never even make it out the neighborhood before the flood gets worse so you can imagine those who saw the water and taught they had a chance to outrun it but in reality the only thing to do is get to high ground
Well said, Mr Philips.
Such a decent man in middle of such lose and catastrophe.
What a classy and kind sounding gentleman. So glad hes safe. This video is terrifying.
So..job opportunity. Design an anchor for vehicles in flood zones so it wont float away.
Im so sorry for your losses. Prayers for you and your family and friends.
So Sad 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
Sorry Michael thank God your safe .
Harp
Sorry for your loss, but glad you and your immediate family survived this unprecedented occurrence. 🙏
Weather manipulation by people you call govt, did this. The proof is everywhere. Wake up folks... There's a reason why the Bible says Satan runs the mortal kingdoms
Where is Waverly?
I can’t even imagine the terror and suffering the animals went through in addition to the people.

God bless all of the peolpe affected 🙏
This video is a real eye-opener, showing just how fast flooding can happen!  Thank you for sharing this, it’s a warning:  if there’s danger of flood, GET OUT NOW!  So glad this man and his family are okay!
Why does his camera read the date as 2021? Odd
Thirty years ago scientists said that as climate change progresses, the frequency and severity of the storms will increase.    This is what they meant by that.
💒🙏🇺🇸......🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Bless all of em. I know first hand the destruction they are dealing with as having just finished rebuilding our home from a tornado destroying it in 2023. It takes time but they can build back even better than before.
GOD BLESS THESE PEOPLE IN EVERY STATE! that lost their lives, animals. Houses, belongings! Please pray for us now again , this Tuesday hurricane coming again for Tampa area. Tarpon springs!!! 🙏 ✝️
😢Es de esperar que los propietarios sean israelíes, ucranianos o intrusos indocumentados. Entonces la administración estadounidense les dará millones.😮😢
Don’t trust this government
God Bless you All 💕
But after its rebuilt, move away from such neighbourhood, the floods will come again
Surprised you let someone talk about prayer on TV.
What caused this!?  Climate change!  The top weather scientists told us 40 years ago that storms would be getting much stronger and more frequent. But the oligarchy wants us arguing about how it’s happening rather than trying to do something about it..
The power of water is extraordinaire.  For example take a look at the Grand canyon.  I live in a flooded area in a refuse to leave because I love it I'm slowly adapting more to the conditions.  But it is nothing to underestimate It can definitely wreak havoc destroy property and surrounding areas and is more than enough to take life.
This video is from 2021, still chilling to watch.
How many times does the government need to deceive you? The government dont give a F. Anarchy works and here is proof
What caused this ...... Corporations caused Climate Change..... duh
Just so everyone knows that administration is working hard to fix the issues in Lebanon and will be sending 71 million in aid.....you guess which Lebanon I'm talking about......
What a positive and kind man. Yes our thoughts and prayers are with you! This reminds the of just how strong and resilient people can be.
Of course you feel badly for this man and the community, as you do for folks impacted by hurricanes and other natural disasters. However, much like school shootings and many of our other problems, prayers are not the answer. We must take ACTION. As a people we are not helpless, we are not without agency. Let's take action and change things for the better. Thanks.
This is criminal....do your research on weather modification/ geoengineering.   ..... And FEMA is nowhere to be found and stopping people from helping
We the people need to ask questions about that direct energy weapon the federal government has
FEMA was not a government agency. It is a private contractor. Warning on the gov $750.00 handout to victims: before FEMA looks at your property they have you sign a contract with fine print. If you do not pay back that $750.00 in a period of determined time, you will lose your house and property, all of it. Beware, this is a FEMA land grab.
There is no way all of this water was caused by a hurricane that came from Florida
Natural selection.
This man sounds white where all the haters at
Anyone in the potential path of the incoming hurricane Milton please get out if you can. If you don’t have money please ask a friend or a church or synagogue for help.
The shear amount of over Stratospheric Aerosol Injection Spraying (weather seeding) over TN, NC and GA was phenomenally visible prior to Helene striking Florida’s Northern Coastline.
And people think it's just so easy to escape a flood, well here's proof of how fast floods can hit and how little time people have to get away.
God bless Mike
Brings back Katrina memories.
It's always amazing to see vehicles being moved along by water. Deceptively powerful.
Plenty of warnings.....choose to stay.......complain later.
Sometimes Mother nature can be BRUTAL,
He will come back in a twinkling of an eye. Everyone knows that does is coming.
What a good, kind and hopeful man.  I pray you and your family can get back to a good life as soon as possible.  God bless you all.
🙏💕
*FACEBOOK IS RESTRICTING POSTS ABOUT THE FLOOD*
So who opened the gates 🤷
HAARP
Sorry for your loss
where did they water come from specifically?
RIP
IT WAS CLOUD SEEDING SILVER IODINE
Huh, it must be mother nature. Let's see, voting is right around the corner, and the areas that got hit were conservative. I thought Mother Nature wasn't biased. Very strange.
Up next this maybe hard for some to watch…water flowing!
Praying for all in the affected regions.  Such a tragedy. Stay strong!  Keep the faith!
The government can control the weather through weather modification, which is the intentional manipulation of the weather. The most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding, which is used to: Increase rainfall or snowfall, Prevent damaging weather like hail or hurricanes, and Provoke damaging weather against an enemy
Support the Harris campaign against climate change. That's what's happening
Praying
It’s biblical, unreal. The Earth is letting us know we are the problem
I'm with him. (This is astounding, especially for this region of the country....)  His question, and mine, is "What caused this?"  Many people from the area, some being generations in the area, and history itself, all say this is an unprecedented level of flooding-- and the speed with which it occurred!   Something just isn't right, with this, and all the other "natural" disasters we've been seeing in the last few years.  Something's up -- and it isn't "global warming".   Everyone should be questioning these disasters.
My heart goes out to everyone there. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Prayers of solace for those lost and what a strong man!
Watch the documentary The Dimming.  That will tell you what caused this.
Cloud seed
The news reporter was more devastated than the guy
dis da raysis ass whyte manz falt fo reel dey did dis shiet cuh fo reel
😭🙏
Very Sad Situation.  And now hearing that Another hurricane forming towards Central Florida gives me chills.
Prayers for all of the people of Waverly, especially for Michael Phillips and his family.  May God guide them through this and back to a place of peace.
Satan works through the elements also to garner his harvest of unprepared souls. He has studied the secrets of the laboratories of nature, and he uses all his power to control the elements as far as God allows. When he was suffered to afflict Job, how quickly flocks and herds, servants, houses, children, were swept away, one trouble succeeding another as in a moment. It is God that shields His creatures, and hedges them in from the power of the destroyer....  In accidents and calamities by sea and by land, in great conflagrations, in fierce tornadoes and terrific hailstorms, in tempests, floods, cyclones, tidal waves, and earthquakes, in every place and in a thousand forms, Satan is exercising his power. He sweeps away the ripening harvest, and famine and distress follow. He imparts to the air a deadly taint, and thousands perish by the pestilence. These visitations are to become more and more frequent and disastrous.56 Ellen White   The Great Controversy.
The military should have been activated last week.   It was horrific to hear Biden say they all have what they need and are very happy.   25th amendment give him a handshake goodbye. Do it this week
Your all in our prayers out west my distant friend 🙏   Has anyone checked if Cloud Seeding planes were up? Food for thought ! 😮
There was no time to do much but seek higher ground, very scary.
Thank you aww aww ❤
10 minutes. that's all they had. you can't leave the area, you'd just be stuck in your vehicle and swept away quicker. if this happened where i live, i take care of both my disabled parents and have 3 pets. 1 story home. we'd be dead. I'd never be able to get either one on the roof, nor do i think i'd be able to get the animals even up there and me at the same time.
Lord, have mercy.🙏❤🙏❤
The Government that RULES us, does not care about US. Americans are just TAX CATTLE. Fema has "Prefered vendors" = DEI compliant political donors. They will keep control, and the media will control the narrative.
100% tht man does not use the N word
🙏💪🇺🇸🦅
Insane footage....
It touched me that this man spoke of the lives lost.  For them:  Eternal rest grant unto them,  O Lord,  and let perpetual light shine upon them.  May those who lost their lives in this fierce and horrible storm rest in peace.
Thanks for sharing  My view of how anyone could get caught in a flash flood has changed.  Moving water doesn’t stop for anything
Which state?
We are praying.
Sorry Michael.  Glad you and your family are ok.
These hurricanes and CLIMATE CHANGE ARE UNBELIEVABLE.  I wonder how many victims decided to stay put when weather authorities said they must evacuate? I also WONDER IS IT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE TO REBUILD AGAIN AND AGAIN.  This is why immigrants are coming hete from South America.  Drought, crime are driving them to where life might be better.
City and towns have been going under water since the beginning of time so why build them so close to the ocean dummies play stupid games get stupid prizes
WOW! Videos like this are hard to comprehend since in many it seems cases the areas weren’t that close to rivers or lakes. Like the case of many of the mountain communities. I’m sure we’re near a lot of “shoulda, woulda, couldas” but in some instances exactly were when people supposed to go when the floods hit such as huge swath and so many areas in unexpected ways?   My prayer’s, condolences and sympathies to those who lost loved ones, friends and their homes. My thoughts and best wishes on the path to recovery to all those affected.
You know if you die trying to save another person I believe you go straight to heaven❤
What caused it? 30+ inches of rain and urban development. Roofs and asphalt don't absorb water. While we keep blabbing about global warming we also need to discussing urban development. Do we really need to build that new business and parking lot, when directly across the street there's an empty building and parking lot.
What caused this- HAARP and an election with evil vile demons
This video is from 3 years ago, this is not the recent hurricane but still very shocking how quick the water can flood!
So sad this happened to these people this should be a good reason for EVERYONE to come together and stop this division.
Ummmm and some folks still don't believe in climate change....This storm hit 200 miles inland!  Unprecedented...
These places should never be rebuilt. These floods could become the new normal. Expect more of the same and more water each time.
Glad your family is safe.
Imagine if the gov moved this quickly
Looks like a lot of water there to me and a lot of debris Raymond Paul Sullivan III me myself and I and him RPS 111
Why in the Hell would you say it’s Hard to watch !!! At least on this video y’all are not FAKE News or 🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥to the Public and Y’all are showing the whole thing to the world!!!  Step up networks!!!
excellent video
This is what happens when you build in a floodplain. Insurance wont cover any of the damage.
🍀
9 minutes….that’s how long it took. Truly remarkable as well as heartbreaking. Those poor people… 😢
💔💔💔🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Holy smokes, that went from 0 to 100 quickly!  No wonder people are getting caught by surprise.
Global warming is a myth. Burn more coal. Vote GOP 😂!
OK. Thoughts and prayers.
Prayers and thought go out to you Michael - best of luck , wishes to you and your family in the coming weeks and months .
Did he really not know what caused it? It was an act of God. Water from a storm caused it.  Everyone has the same, non sensical response; prayers.   Why not try “logic”?  Move.  Build your home at a higher elevation.  Prepare for this!  This has been happening for 4.5 billion years! The earth will continue to cycle itself. If you simply acknowledge this and react with common sense you won’t have to rely on nonsense.
God loves you and is for you, blessings my freind
That is absolutely insane, took like 10 mins from “dry” to a 4 foot deep dam near raging river. Terrifying.
Why do people underestimate nature? She is powerfull and she is pissed!
Such a sad story! Prayers!
More than 1 billion dollars in FEMA funds given to immigrants by Biden and Harris and now there isn't enough for taxpayers in crisis. The federal government is joke! We need new leadership
Prayers AND donations, folks.  All Americans would do so much to help our fellow citizens by giving whatever they can afford.  Please donate if you can....
🙏🙏🙏
Did the damn break or something? That's so crazy how the water just took over so fast. Wow I'm sorry for all the lives lost. My prayers everyone out there 😢
That’s amazing the speed of the water.
10 minutes...unless i saw it i wouldn't believe it
My heart goes out to those flood victims,they will need all the help they can get ,prayers n blessing for them we are americans so they will rise better than before, 🙏
That’s a good man
All our thoughts and prayers from Colorado. ❤
Wow.
Prayers 🙏
Our prayers are with you. God bless.
JESUCRISTO ✝️ TE BENDIGA TODO
Thank you for sharing Michael. My prayers are for you and your family and friends and all in that area 🙏
God Bless him. Praying for everyone involved. My heart hurts seeing these videos
What caused this? Hmmm.
The ones with discernment know why and what caused this.  Prayers for all those lives that were lost and for all of those that are suffering because of this.
But how do people get up onto their roofs?
Waverly where? Is it possible to give the state?  So sad for you! Thank God you are all survived!
what a beautiful human he is
🙏🙏🙏
Waverly - where? What state?
They didn’t tell y’all to leave.
Thanks for helping me realize that river flooding  is unreal!
My heart goes out to him. This weather isn't normal. It's time to seriously address climate change.
I don't think many Americans realize how bad this was and still is so so sorry for all that lost their lives their family my prayers and thoughts are with u all
Überall auf der Welt wütet Amerika. In Amerika wütet Helene.  Thank you Helene ! 😘
I’m praying for you and for all who was in this tragic flood .. May Jesus help you all and May God look after all the ones that went to heaven - I’m so sorry much love and empathy ❤& Prayers 🙏 from England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 ❤🙏
Heartbreaking to hear of such tremendous loss.
I agree with what was said what caused this to happen so quickly?!?!?!
Couldn't this have been avoided if people lived 2-3 miles from Paint Fork?
I can't even believe my eyes
That's insane how swift that was. Sorry for the loss of your cousins brother. I hope you get the help you need to recover.
I hope you miserable media that leech off the suffering of others paid Michael handsomely for his video footage. We all know Fema isn't going to do a damn thing.
What caused it? A combination of building on flood plains and concrete doesn't absorb water like dirt does.
Immensely tragic for the lives lost. 🙏🏻Mr. Philips and family are okay — This video is an education for all.
Why do illegal aliens get free everything, and our citizens get she it.  WAKE up AMERICA 🇺🇸
It’s sad that so many people lost their lives, but with a hurricane bearing down on you and several inches of rain falling maybe the best bet would have been to head for higher ground before the waters broke out of their banks. Your homes can be replaced, but you can’t.
Heartfelt thoughts and plenty of prayers being said for you and everyone affected by this massive tragedy. Hugs and love!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hard to plan for something that quick.  Out of surge area, far inland, little wind and suddenly water is rushing past your otherwise safe house.  Where was the river or creek in relation to the house,  no sign if it in any of the coverage.
Thoughts and prayers are no match for climate change..
Why is every station lying about the death toll and why are civilians  trying to help thos in need being arrested 😢
Musk wants that land he wants that lithium that's up there your government did this to you so everybody better pay attention instead of paying attention what's going on around you and looking at them you need to be looking at him above cuz none of them none of them made us any good so when everybody gets on their knees to pray in worships things will change cuz there's a lot of power in prayer so stop praising your government and who you think needs to be elected play attention
1 foot of fast moving water produces 30 pounds per square inch of force
I thought this was from Helene then I saw this was 3 years ago.  This whole area seems to be prone to chronic flooding.
sorry for your loss,
I can never help thinking the government and weather weapons are behind thses disasters in red states
Where is all this water going?  To the Atlantic?
This is an excellent perspective and the homeowner had a great attitude about it as well - pray for all involved.
So sad.  God bless all of the folks affected by that storm.
Praying for y'all bro. God bless
Prayers and thoughts to all those affected in this flood.
Geo engineering
A dam broke ..no one could have been ready for that 🫡
harris is home laughing and getting drunk sucking willie brown off
where is waverly?
Thoughts and prayers. That should sort it all out and probably stop the next one. Such delusional stupidity.
Man, that happened in 10 minutes. Wow, sad
Climate change!
camel toe harris is a failure why do i have to watch a coommerical of b---ch just to watch a vidio
You want cheap gasoline,you get  climate change ,extreme weather conditions,don’t pray,change your behaviour
Stop burning fossil fuels
So sorry for your losses, Hope all gets better soon for you and your family. God's Blessings on you and yours.
I  wish our government would help
Prayer
when your watching the weather news in the future and they say flash flooding is very possible , this is exactly what they are talking about. and if you are in a low laying area then you should seriously consider moving to higher ground.
Praying for Comfort for those who lost Family and Friends. I am so sorry for all  of the people affected by this Disastrous Storm!
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I’m very worried about the Animals. May God save and protect them all and the good people who care for them
😢
The government gave the money for disasters to the illegal aliens. That American taxpayer paid for.   In my whole life, and I’m in my 60s, I have never heard of nor seen a disaster in the United States this bad.
Geoengineering-weather warfare.
God is not happy with the USA
Praise you Jesus for delivering my life from the wickedness of sin 😊
You people need to say where these places are at you say Waverly where is that Georgia Tennessee Africa?!?
So sorry for alll the loss 🙏🏾
I'd flatten my tires to try to keep it from floating into something else.
typical of his culture looking for a hand out
A land tsunami.
Now this has absolutely nothing to do with the meaning of this video, but if I were to close my eyes and listen to that young man speak, I would swear that he was Caucasian a good old country boy. Lol😂! I am however praying for the those affected by the recent storms.❤
❤😢 1:56 😮
🙏🏽
its called a flash  flood it happens in a flash sad but true its common in mtn country thats why ya dont build in a flood plain or creek lake river ya look at the high water marks and build higher up on the hill if it done it once it will do it again or worse mother nature always tell us what to do or not to do and its simpe ya dont build or live below a high water mark
That’s crazy!😢
Prayers to all
That was terrifying to watch. It took less than two minutes to get to near porch level. If you were indoors not paying attention and only realised the situation at the 2 minute mark you have no time or option to get out especially if you have kids to get together and get clear in water that is likely to be at kids waist height and rapidly rising that would take an adult off their feet never mind small children.
The rich should invest more into preserving and protecting planet Earth that we live on and not so much about keeping up with the Joneses and material things !
The dew lines are visible on radars
Great job reporting and allowing the survivor a voice
THAT IS HOW FAST IT ROSE AT MY HOUSE -13 minutes= SIX FEET OF STORM SURGE OFF THE GULF
Did the levy break? Was this considered or tornadoor hurricane?
It hurts me to see others hurting. At times I feel lost because of others losses as I want dearly to be there and help them.
God bless them.  Hope our military can be in the US and can help
Climate Change caused it!!! It's what we've been warned about for decades
This needs to be a time when we come together as a country and put aside our political differences and just help each other. You do not have to be in a flood area to help a neighbor. Just do something simple like take their garbage can back to there house for them. We are the United States of Fricking America. Let’s take care of business and each other. May God Bless is all!
Yea.   Exactly....what caused this.   Prayers.
Biden admin will let them die,they are arresting pilots that showed up to help people but still no fema. All the radio systems were all oip radios when you lose power you lose internet which means your radios
Please, no more ! 😢  Do we think the wars the Usa's government has fomented throughout the world for decades, including the total destruction of lives, and of LIFE, in Gaza, in Palestine,  including THE MILLIONS ANIMALS LIVES, mere 'commodities'  😢 n the atrocious disregard of our MOTHER NATURE are now coming back home, like karma, like a boomerang? 😢   The Usa nation, like all other nations, is now waking up (and we feel it for her) through direct pain n suffering, and maybe like for ea of us, also to reassess her life and to begin sincerely the practise of human values like:-  Truth, Right Conduct, Peace, Love, and Non Violence. GOD LOVES ALL OF HIS CREATION EQUALLY 🙏🙏🙏
10:00 dry 10:04 impossible to walk out side 10:10 you’ll die if you fall in the water
Terrifying
Climate change caused this.
Prayers for everyone
Know where your ladders are to be able to get to the roof! I’m moving mine first thing tomorrow morning and reloading and updating my go bags
Hurricaine so don’t do this, sure as shit not in the mountains. But intensional dam releases sure would .
For water to come out of no where that fast. . . Without warning. . . Damns started releasing huge amounts of water and no one knew about it to warn the people??!!!! This was an execution and there is a planned land grab
It's Waverly, North Carolina.  30 minutes north of Ashville, NC.  Wow!  In less than 10 minutes the water got so high!  Scarry!
HAHAHAHAHAHA!
wow, that looks scary how fast the flood water rise. just watching it by seconds its just nerve wracking! God bless us all!
I am so sorry for your many losses. I thank you for sharing the flood and your story. I have been in a flash flood situation and it is shocking how fast the water rises.
We rerouted riviers so they will flood cities. Army corp of engineers cause flooding.
HAARP
We are praying for the families affected.
People think this is climate change, it is actually weaponised weather events to bring about the global agenda for a one world government.
Where is Biden during all of this?
Horrific

The time stamps in the upper left hand corner make this feel the most scary, because it's clear he's not exaggerating. On the other hand, it's pretty annoying that YouTube is showing this in my feed on the weekend after Hurricane Helene went thru the Southeast. It tricked me into thinking this was news. I'm sure the flooding from Hurricane Helene also occurred in a similar timeframe but this video is not it.
This video is from Sept. 3, 2021.
New video up on my channel explaining many of the reasons behind all this flooding! Check it out!
Please people repent. God is not happy with us.
So😩🤧🙏🏻 Sad
I have seen this before.  In New Orleans, during Katrina
God bless you all
Global warming.  Orange head doesn't want you to believe it.
Let’s all do the right thing and stop flooding and social injustice. Please save our country and vote for Harris 24. Thank you and Amen and A woman
Why doesn't  channel 5 say where its at?
Okay......   BUT...... WHERE IS WAVERLY!!!  😂😂😂 Thanks for the footage but, you have a worldwide audience nowdays! 🤔✌️🇨🇦
Dude is really calm and chill for having damn near everything get destroyed. Hope him and his family are ok
Yeah sounds like somebody that has nothing else to say except for pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray just say some prayers everything will be fine😮😅😅
What is the DARK SPOT, ( 1:36)  rising out of the water?
Yeah, did you all happen to have dams removed? They have been removing dams across America this past three years everywhere. It has caused floods everywhere but you never hear about the dams being removed.
Oh man😮   That's crazy how quick that happened!
Someone opened flood gates
Wise strong man!  Still...you know it is a hard road ahead to recovery. 🙏🙏🙏🙏❤
Any disasters on me my family from 2017, be seen inside both nations that were not seen before 2017. I don't need to know all this happenings or I need to curse, it is auto cosmos reciprocation due to my way of living KConscns.
حبس الفساد في الارض الفليسطين و القدس و غير ة

AllahHumabarik his plan are always best.
No I’m fucking done DONE I was in this and you’re gonna joke abt it
No signs of global warming, eh?
Prays doesn’t change or do anything for any of y’all ! Hope does that
They sank into the muuuuud 😁
Waverly 😂
The end result of destroyed wetlands and human destruction of the environment... These areas have flooded for millions of years and will continue to flood for the next several millions of years.  Fact...
Instead of asking for thoughts and prayers, how about asking for help and donations?
Flash floods are so dangerous especially after dark...
I don't UNDERSTAND WHY DON'T THEY DIVERT THE WATER INTO ANOTHER AREA IS THERE ANY WAY TO FIX THIS
I was there working in New Johnsonville at the time when this happened. We got off work early cause of lightening around 8-8:30am, I then drove back and got gas at the Casey’s in town, seconds later it was like the whole town was under water. So many people lost their lives. I was trying to help as much as I could. I remember finding a girl upstream shivering and crying asking where her babies were, they had been swept out of her arms during the flood. Something you truly can’t imagine unless you’re there. There were officers I believe that also lost their lives, I saw their boat flip as they tried to go out and rescue others. Prayers for everyone.
You're a good man
Okay so which Waverly is this Tennessee or Virginia people have to start clarifying
Sadly I was a victim I now live in my aunts house it was very traumatizing 😭
I'm sorry buddy 😶
😭😭😭😭😭😭
We just moved to Waverly 2 weeks before the flood. A year later the town has finally reached a point of moving forward but there is serious trauma still lingering for a lot of folks.
It is scary to watch & something must be done about draining this out to the sea or river quickly!
I experienced a flash flood when a tiny creek that is nothing more than a trickle became a raging river. We had 6 inches in 1 hour and 12 inches in 6 hrs. The creek overflowed it's banks and completely filled my backyard up to the windows. And it wasn't slow moving water. It was dangerous and moving very fast. Very scary and I called 911... They told me they couldn't help me, we were on our own. A couple neighbors went up to the creek and dug a relief channel which reduced the flow towards my house. Luckily the waters subsided before it got anymore out of hand. That whole experience made me realize just how dangerous flood waters can be. It comes quick. I woke up and there was no time to evacuate and nowhere to go anyway since it was flooded everywhere.
I’ve seen many flash floods this was a Serious FlashFlood people when u live close to a river be extremely aware of rain fall north of u the heavy rain flows down stream if u live down stream it’s coming right at you it will literally over flow the banks in seconds and be in the streets it moves even faster in the streets most times picking up cars trucks sheds etc it all adds up and yeah sometimes the warning goes off and here’s the water like a minute after the warning just always be aware far as swimming in this type of water absolutely not unless your a trained rescue swimmer and they would tell u sorry but no a flash flood is impossible to swim
Poor man and his family they open the levy on y'all and flooded your neighborhood with no regards to human life
Where is the billionaires and millionaires that cares about people
March on Washington
That happens when a rogue government opens flood gates without regulation. You guys were flooded on purpose. You need to get on that story. This government is using everything they have to tear us down
LMFAO AT YOU MISSISIPPI! THATS WHAT YOU GET! Thank you for voting for Trump this is the end result of believing his lies, you got what you deserved! TRUMP SAID GLOBAL WARMING IS FAKE, TRUMP WAS AGAINST FUNDING AMERICAS INFASTRUCTURE, TRUMP MADE YOU FEEL GOOD TO BE A RACIST AGAINT, NOW LITERALLY YOU DRINK 💩 KEEP VOTING FOR THE RICH! YOU WILL LEARN EVENTUALLY, CAUSE THEY RELATE TO YOUR BROKE AZZZZZ RIGHT? IBISIL
the power of me an my earth I want my fucking money an I want fucking peace on earth or I will flatten everything in my fucking way
Brother Johnson we are praying for the victims down there that lost their lives in the name of Jesus stay strong we know the weather do change and I blessings go out in Jesus name
Thank you for sharing this video. We will continue praying.
Wow!  ELEVEN MINUTES from first water to 4-5 feet.
God bless this man and prayers for the families who lost loved ones.Flash floods are terrifying.I've never been in one and hope I never am. Kinda scary here in Shreveport, la. just three hours away It has been non stop raining here.
we new  this to happen for 50 years                 we did nothing more more more more more more
DALLAS UNDER ATTACK BY THE USAF/NAVY WEATHER NAZIS, SHAME ON OUR EVIL GOVERNMENT
Geesh that water is nasty. That's not what we need. We'd like some nice rain to keep the place watered.
Army Corps of Engineers Should be Held Accountable ✔️
That'll throw you off, a black guy talking like Billy Bob Thornton.
God Bless yall
WHERE IS WAVERLY ? WHAT STATE WHAT COUNTY ?
Praying to those affected
God coming
"What caused this. Never seen anything like this before." Climate change. That caused this. Thank your local coal baron.
According to science the earth is billions of years old; this isn’t anything new we’re just humans in the path
Where is Waverly? At the bottom of a hill? Low-lying area?
Must live by a river.
This is scary just viewing the video
No
cameras don't "roll" anymore.  That's an old film term.  Why can't people just quit using old talk?
Mike Phillips appears to be an optimistic good neighbor - a winner if you will.
Everything they own, destroyed in an instant.
' wow beautifully floody on the desert... big thank to the cloudy pour heavy thick rainy rainy on the dry desert sand / great floody... keep continue more rainy rainy again and flood soon allday - allnight - everyday - everynight... many animals / plants needs that water
Why do I say that it looks like disasters is hitting the whole world is it global warming or is it what we doing to one another
Look at the whole world the way people are doing each other maybe we are to stop and think about God is trying to tell us some the way we treat each other all over the world
How could this be avoided ? That train left during the 1980s....congress & the President knew how the unmentioned would manifest.  These folks just got a heads up on the future.
Many years ago I read of a local man that had drowned inside his basement flat after a water main fractured under the road nearby.  That someone could be pinned by the pressure of water and furniture as water flooded in and rose above his head, before he could escape horrified me.  Likewise, these residents were unprepared for the speed and force of the rising floodwaters which trapped them.  Whilst its tragic that the family lost their home and vehicle, they survived and are well, and they're together.
DESIGNER FAULTY I AM CIVIL ENGINEER BETTER BUILDING THAN CONTROL HYDROLIC STRUCTURE
👍
If I heard his voice over the phone only, I would've never thought he was a black dude.
Praying to god that this act of god doesn’t take any lives that god doesn’t want to take. Even though he’s both omniscient and omnipotent.
What I don't understand is why didn't the local weather stations give warnings to this event?
Reminds me of some pictures during Hurricane Katrina.
Is this Waverly MO?
My heart goes out to all affected by this disaster.
Don’t understand how people drown in these things. I’m a good swimmer though so maybe that’s why
Weather manipulation is what caused this.
Yea prays really help. If they help it wouldn’t have happened in the first place.
It’s moving a truck !!! A freaking truck!!! Try walking in that and you find out quick there is no way
"Why?  What caused this?"   The Greenhouse effect, first identified (and quantified) by Nobel-prize winning physical chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1896.   That this kind of thing would happen to the planet has been known for more than 120 years, folks.
Folks, if you are forced to go on the roof from inside the house, be sure you have a means of breaking through the roof. I'm thinking a sawsall, or circular saw would work. Of course, this would be something planned ahead.
Biden did this
Seeing the cars float away is soo sad
Water is the most devastating force on earth.
From McKinleyville California my prayers are with you!
wow
Did a dam break?
Amén
Senator Rand Paul is a well known Libertarian.  I'm curious, for the people of Kentucky to receive state and federal aid in the form of temporary shelter and or financial assistance to rebuild their lives, would that be in conflict with Senator Paul's political ideology?
Very Sad
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼😪
ITS TIME TO REALLY STOP and work changing the direction of our climate before we are completely wiped out. Between Katrina,Florida and now the MIDwest, AMERICA IS BEING WARNED of more extreme future disasters. China just had major floods and a tornado
GEOENGINEERING....they dry out he west and it dumps in the east,
Why? Man made climate change. Nature is out of balance
Too big military around the world piss people to show all things in the table before the wedding where women always got rapped and called it wedding?
And oil drilling also does the same thing
Most underground led ocean or river to any city in earth and flood fast as 10 minutes the amount of evacuation us impossible
Could airforce help this kind of warfare attack at home front?
LET'S ALL CELEBRATE FOX NEWS AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR 30 YEARS OF GLOBAL WARMING DENIAL AND MAKING FUN OF THOSE CRAZY LIBERALS.   I SAY LET'S STOMP ON THE ACCELERATOR WITH GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE NAME OF FOX NEWS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND JESUS CHRIST.   JESUS CHRIST IS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.  PRAISE JESUS FOR ALL THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION WITH ALL THE STORMS.   BRING ON MORE DEATH   BRING ON MORE DESTRUCTION.  THAT'S WHY I VOTE REPUBLICAN  I CAN'T WAIT TILL THE NEXT SUPER STORM DESTROYS MY NEIGHBOR'S HOME AND I GET TO LAUGH AT THEM FOR BEING CRAZY LIBERALS.  ALL THAT CRAZY LIBERAL TALK ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING AS THEY GRIEVE OVER THE DEATH OF THEIR FAMILY.   EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT REAL AMERICANS SHIT OUT HURRICANES, TORNADOES, FLOODS AND DROUGHT BEFORE THEY HAVE BREAKFAST  DON'T TALK ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER BEING THE ANSWER.     ALL THAT SCIENCE TALK IS JUST A BUNCH OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE NAME OF SATAN.   NOW EVERYBODY GET OUT OF MY WAY BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO WATCH FOX NEWS FOR MORE DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE CRAZY LIBERALS ARE COMING FROM MY GROSS POLLUTING SUV AND MY UNSECURED GUNS.    HEY KIDS IT'S GUN NUTS!  THE NEW CRUNCHY CEREAL THAT WILL PUT A CAP IN YOUR ASS.   GUN NUTS IS LOADED WITH ALL KINDS OF AMMUNITION THAT IS PART OF A BALANCED BREAKFAST AND BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION
why??  your city officials don't plan for this. I'm from Florida and this happens all the time not to mention the hurricanes. do you have water and food for 3 days, do you know where shelters are, how many boats do your first responders have? this is not the first time Kentucky is flooded. having said that I pray for all the victims and get rid of your people in charge. they have not protected you by educating you.
The, mostly, innocent take most of the suffering.  The guilty, guys like Manchin these days, but so many before, American Presidents back to Reagan who knew perfectly well that continuing down the burn all the oil path would lead to this.  Oil executives who lied and cheated.  And this is just the start folks.  The world has only warmed one degree so far, three degrees is probable now since very little is being done and much too slowly at that, to burn less fossil fuels.  And America is the worst culprit.
👑 🙏🌎🔥 REVIVAL COME ❤️❤️❤️😍
That's so scary!!🥺
That’s not that bad
I guess the ONLY Way you could EVER Avoid something like this is if you're Clairvoyant... Or you had somewhere to go Days in advance.  Which, I know, lately, in PA, we've been Forecasted to get Severe Weather & NOTHING happens... So, I've fallen into this "I'll believe it when I see it" Mentality. Which, if this Video has shown me anything, it's that the Weather can go from Mild to Deadly in Seconds.  My Heart goes out to all of the People whose Lives were Devastated by Terrifying & Catastrophic Weather Events.
Anyone else see the ghost at 135-136 left lower hand lol black smoke like mist. Weird
I cannot imagine trying to get to the roof and then look down while the water keeps rising.
My heart truly goes out to Kentucky I live here in H-Town and a few years back we had a bad flood Harvey it is a definite tragedy my heart truly goes out to Kentucky may God be with you 🙏🏾
Before this video I didn’t understand how people don’t just walk up to the mountain to get away, or get on their roof  … not realizing how fast and how powerful this water was. Even if you wanted to try to escape in this ankle deep water it would wash you away. If this was me I’m not sure I’d even be quick enough to get onto the roof. God bless all these people who didn’t make it and the ones who lost everything they worked for.
God probably showing them, in their democrat area, that biden signing that document to make Israel two states, the destruction from that starts negligible, to massive, to overflowing destruction.
This looked more like a damn rupture then flash flooding. But I guess it’s over a time period without watching it in real time makes it seem quicker! But still he said 10 minutes! 😳I lived in Ky all my life been all over seen a lot of disasters and Katrina was the only time we seen water come in that fast. I know we had a place get wiped out like this in KJ Ky and it was from all the deforesting. They took all the trees and under growth out and nothing was there to catch the rain that always had been and it did the same thing 20 minutes the whole place was under water.
anyone taking notice of the 180 geoengineering programmes taking place all over the planet?
Was there a river close by that overflowed it's banks or did it just come out of nowhere?
God bless their hearts in Waverly.
Admit Climate change is real  and get your government to do something about it
It looked like a dam had been opened!
Wow.. What an important video to share.. it shows the limits of words.. if you had more time vs what you can only do w 5 min.. what if you were sleeping or in the bathroom ..there's just so many scenarios.. this is so tragic..my heart goes out to all these people so sorry for your losses 😭 tears rolling..forgive my limited knowledge but like he said "what caused this?"how did this happen?
Nature caused this you know who wins 100% of the time nature.
How was the electricity still working??
Where is the government providing for non American citizens.  National guard?  Nope not here not coming.
You have to include where's Waverly? What State or Country?
Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:”
16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.
Getting a call from your friend, "yo dude, your truck is in my house, come by anytime to grab it".

Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
Glad he is ok! Dang hearing his voice I didn't thank he was black
Even if you had a canoe or bass boat, it would have been hard to get to it in time, and then you might just go downstream against your will.
is the peoplke of the world suppose t know where is "Waverly".?  is this Mexico, USA, Canada or Europe?  Reporter cannot just utter one word to identify where this is located?  FAILURE
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUMP WATER ON THE DESERT  OUT WEST IT'S  EVAPORATION  CAUSES FLOODING IN THE OHIO VALLEY
One thing that drives me nuts is, here is a YouTube channel put on by a new organization, they put the city where flooding took place but somehow they forget to say which state,  if they can type "Home surveillance video shows speed of Waverly ???????????????????????????????????????????????? flooding.  How hard is it to do your basic job.
God Bless Kentucky
Global warming is REAL....SORRY YA ALL...
I am so sorry i will continue to pray.
Weather manipulation 😈👿
Climate is definitively changing! There are now tornados and hurricanes in the East Coast! Flooding in KY!
I was in New Orleans during hurricane Katrina Jesus Christ man I never thoughtnid see so much water in my liiiiiiife!
PRAYERS
Was this Waverly Virginia?
This water is so strong, even in life vests ppl would be hurt!  Prayers to the ppl in these towns an to the families who lost loved ones, our prayers are with you!🙏🏻
Sending Love and Light for those unfortunate souls in Kentucky
Looks like the tidal wave that hit Japan!
Bless this man.
I'm actually watching inland tsunami like floods occuring in America. First there was the Fire...now,the Water has come. My hopes to those who have survived,so very terrible,the loss. The valleys aren't safe anymore. I don't know what to tell you all but from what I lived in the mountains of Colorado. When the rains come like that,the only place to be is mountain topside,higher is your only choice.
He wants to know "why it happened?" Climate change. Get used to it! And, it's going to get worse!
The nine most terrifying words in the English launguage are, "I"m from the Government and I'm here to help."  Our hero Ronald Reagan.
Move to another state people !!
We’re praying for you Sir.
$$$ WASTED ON  Russia Stooge Trump SPACE WARS & UKRAINE , could be USED TO REPAIR AMERIKKKA 🇺🇸
Wow!
Prayers to The flood victims of Kentucky ..knowing some are of my Ball relations whom came and settled after moving on from Virginia...move to higher grounds if you are in lower grounds these changes are gonna get worse..and read up on Edgar Caycey he wrote of flooding thought he was picking up Kansas ..some time those pickups are not right...  Move to higher grounds no matter were you live ..
Basically tsunami flooding
Wow
prayers and thoughts? useless. Can I take prayers and thought to the bank and cash it out for money or for a time-in-reverse Uno card? No, I cannot. and YOU cannot.
Unbelievable Floods Pray for every one
It's flooding like this all over the world. Welcome to climate change. Floods like this ruin food supplies and the infrastructure that supports it. Good luck people. At least the rich made off like bandits
We burning up in Cali ...floods in Kentucky ...covid still killing people ... prayers for everyone tomorrow gon be some different problems in the world..
You haven't been in Guadalajara Mexico every year every time it rains the whole  city turns into a lake since I remember.
Wow, you literally had less than 10 minutes to decide what your next move is.  This is crazy.
Keep it concrete and ask for permission  didn't I wrote and said call Austen
Damn man.  Sucks
Im the worlds worst swimmer. I'd die right away if I tried to swim in that
I’m praying as sincere and as hard as I can, praying is POWERFUL never under estimate it’s power, God can turn the deeds of the enemy to good as only He can. I feel sadness for all who have lost so much. Love xx Dave
incredible!!!!
Wow chilling! Continued prayers
"... MIGHT BE HARD TO WATCH" ... seriously, we need to protect everyone from everything" ... wokeness has gone weak in the knee, if this was potentially "Hard to Watch" ... . ... . ... . ... . ...
climate change is happening. it's time to stop destroying the earth for money
So scary how fast this was
Love and prayers to all affected by this flood.
What did cause it to do this so rapidly?
Global warming has been and is real. I dont know if its even reversable at this point. Hotter summers every year, crazy weather. Heat waves that havnt been seen before in other countries and our own. Its been a ride yall, but its not over yet...
City and Metro workers should be doing their jobs by cleaning out the drainage system,  instead of setting in the trucks sleeping or on their cell phones.
Its a shame how long its taking the state,  city to get Waverly cleaned up. This is 2022, never should take this long to get them folks back to some type of normalcy.
Where is this?
Holy crap that happened so fast
I’m taking more action to help the families being displaced and lives lost due to the flooding in Kentucky. Today, I added Individual Assistance to the Major Disaster declaration I approved to expedite support to flooding survivors.
Positive thoughts and prayers
Very sad 😔  God please help the world 🙏  so many disaster all over the world 🌎
The scariest thing are the power lines that are below the water, That is why you never tread water that you cannot see through in a flood situation. Powerlines will take you out in a flash.
So grateful they were able to be saved💝🥺💔so tragic for those who did not 💔💔💔
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
God bless
All Bible prophecies that on earth wake up brithpains  is what you seeing repent trust faith get on the ark.dont get left behind  🙏 for all around the world amen 🙏 ❤️
This is a red state, they don't believe in climate change. And Moscow Mitch won't help them. Sink or swim.
It's G-DS VENGEANCE! COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM OR SUFFER THE SAME FATE AS THEY WILL.
Flashflood. Meaning it happens in a "Flash"
God bless them and there families all glory to God Aman
Welcome to the warm new world we created!
I have video of my family getting flooded in Eastern KY and then being saved by national guard 🙏
All I can say is wow and I'm so sorry for you folks I know God is good and he will provide All your needs according to his riches and glory
🌧️🙏💔🙏
Same thing happened in Hurricane Katrina, no one came to help my people. Oh well, karma 🤷🏾‍♀️
Well hope Mr. BIDEN HELPS YOU ALL OUT. HE OWES YOU ALL THAT MUCH. HARDLY SEEN THIS ON NEWS IN OHIO. WHY???
What did cause it?
He looks like a nice man Im so sad this is happening in our country.
If you live in a flood zone, and you love your family, please consider moving if you can. Based on what I can see on the totally user unfriendly FEMA flood zone maps Waverly Kentucky does not appear to be in a flood zone. Wonder who dropped the ball on this one?
Time to leave when there flood warnings in your area
Build a pipeline to the Colorado River we will take it all! Prayers to all
What is sad about all the deaths is that it was caused by the hands of the very people America calls heros cops and fire department because without these issues they don't have jobs.  So in order for the government to pay out money to the money laundering operations behind the police departments and fire departments they have to see that there is a reason for why they need to sign checks.  For people to understand that the storms and flash floods that people are killed in and murdered are actually conjoined up by the one of the strongest witchcrafts in existence.  When man say that a cop and afire department worker protects them then you are literally taking the Lord God out of your life.  So to see the lack of understanding in this country on which is which it is sad.  Everyone says they believe in the Lord God yet they say man that the tax payer's pay for protects them?  Wow....   You are all being fooled by witches in this country, why do you think there are more superhero movies in mainstream media than they do with Jesus Christ?  It is is because the devil wants you to believe in fairy tales.   Make The Lord God The Father and His Son Jesus Christ my Saviour and Holy Spirit your one and only God or you will suffer at the hands of man.  Exodus 20:3 Thou shalt have no other god's before me;"saith the Lord." Wake up America. Jesus Christ is Lord. From The Everlasting to Everlasting,Amen and Amen.
As the climate heats up, expect much more of this—and this will look mild compared to what’s coming.   After you’re done praying, do something real—like voting for politicians who do more than just pray, but then take $$$ from the fossil fuel industry.
I lived in Missouri in 1993, floods are a bitch!
I’m not trying to be funny but can you swim in that type of water?
I'm sorry but I feel no pity for these people, and yes i said that . but clearly these people are living in a valley river way, where it CAN flood from time to time ,and sometimes those floods can be tragic but they did choose to live there and from all the vids of this scene that i have seen so far it's more than clear that they ARE living in a part time river. know the lay of the land and surrounding area you want to live in and this sort of thing would NOT happen . In other words - STOP TRYING TO LIVE IN FLOOD ZONES !!!
Perfect example of a flash flood. You have literally minutes to try and escape
"what caused this? what caused this?? i want everyone to continue to pray for us"  climate change caused this.
Sending prayers of comfort and peace of mind.  Michaels positivity in the face of such adversity is inspiring.
The buffalo creek flood all over again….except in Kentucky.. prayers for eastern Kentucky 🙏🙏🙏🙏
الحمدلله رب العالمين 🙂✅
Prayers to all affected.....
Thank you
Glad you survived, sir.
😥🙏
Prayers
Prayers  to  everyone  --- from  North Carolina 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Its Climate change and it's sad but this will become the norm until this gerontocracy that rules us realize their fucking over our future here.  They will be gone while we suffer due to their greed and inaction
Reporters suck
What caused this was the government intentionally stalling a cold front in one spot and feeding cloudburst which they know how to do and if you look at the radar you can see the manipulation
The burning of all that Appalachian coal has led to immense amounts of carbon in the atmosphere, resulting in more water vapour in the atmosphere and greater downpours resulting in floods like this. You can pray all you want, but pray for electing politicians who will do something about our changing climate.
You sow what you reap.  Continue voting in right-wing nut job candidates, who are anti-science and fight tooth and nail against regulations mitigating man's footprint on climate change, which is accelerating at an alarming rate, and live with the consequences of your vote.  Do not dare ask the Federal Government for disaster relief funds, as tax payers from other states should not be asked to subsidize reckless stupidity and willful indifference.  Let them drown, die, suffer for their votes.  That is the way I see it.
"What caused this?" Climate Change. Like scientists have been saying for over 40 years now. It’s going to take more than "thoughts and prayers" to solve this issue. We need to stop those causing it, major corporations aided by crooked politicians, impose strict regulations on those entities and hold them accountable.
Geoengeering …that’s what’s causing this “weather”.
Micheal , I'm so thankful you and your family were spared. I admire your strength and your resilience to be able to have a good outlook for the future. Prayers will be going up for you and your community. Does the news station have a link to help donate to the community?
Looks like god finally decided to flush old man McConnell's toilet. 😂 God parted the red sea for Moses, but he sent a deluge to MAGA land. That's what you get for claiming trump was sent by God. One pissed off God ! Reap what you have sown, be glad it wasn't worse.
Flawless interview by that survivor. I wouldn't have been able to keep my composer at all especially after he lost two family members and one friend.
So where did the water come from? That’s not rain
Prayers are not going to help anything. Money and human action are going to help things.
That guy seems like the kind of neighbor you want to have.
I think there flooding the south on purpose...they dont want people living in rural neighborhoods..
I would have go into the garbage totes and floated to safety.
Watching this from the UK🇬🇧 while Europe burns. What happened to our world? So sad.
Build an ark not a house
No draining
Where were the police first  responders  Life boats . So 😔
Hero’s are everywhere, so sad, pray for people there. How much troops President is going to send there for help
I never seen something like this before and the weird is worldwide. Lord have mercy on us all
yep that looked fast
Two children were killed by this flood. RIP Lucy and Kellen
A 7 year old girl died in this. Water was up to the ceiling and a wall burst out taking her out into the waters. RIP Little Lucy 💔
What caused it???? Well a leaked document says the USA government wants to own the weather by 2025! Before you scoff operation popeye happened in the Vietnam war they've been tinkering with weather for a long time. As for this flood I'm sure their endeavors had some to do with it. But they would never do that....sure they wouldn't you dont know history!
The country needs to be educated on filling numbers of double-bagged garbage cans, taped off, and filled with all pictures, important papers, clothes, etc., and fastened with ropes to a secure wall, but all the government wants to blab about is the destruction. . . . .
This land is your land and this land is my land From California to the New York island From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters This land was made for you and me As I went walking that ribbon of highway I saw above me that endless skyway Saw below me that golden valley This land was made for you and me I roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts All around me a voice was sounding This land was made for you and me When the sun come shining, then I was strolling And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting This land was made for you and me This land is your land and this land is my land From California to the New York island From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters This land was made for you and me When the sun come shining, then I was strolling And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling The voice come a-chanting and the fog was lifting This land was made for you and me 🎶
I've been in 2 floods on Joe St.  2019 I moved in with my sister, if I hadn't my daughter and I wouldn't of made it. God bless you Mike and and all that lost loved ones and their homes..my thoughts and prayers are with you all.  WAVERLY  STRONG!
These days with all of this crazy weather patterns, people have to prepare everyone in the home to have a backpack with at least three outfits of warm clothing, and your vital records safely in plastic baggies to be ready to bolt out of there if necessary 😑 it's that serious! 😏 Sheesh
Matthews 24 thessal 5 1 peter 3 10 rev 3 the last days tornadoes earthquakes floods heatwaves  the signs of the time the coming of christ.
Prayers and thoughts aren’t gonna do anything.! How about these dumb ass billionaires stop sending people to space (for example) for no reason and invest in helping communities like this to prevent future floods. Fix this planet first!
Surely they don't expect  people to rebuild in the flood zone.    I'd move some where else , no matter what the cost is.
"What would you like to see to help improve the situation?"  "Prayers"
It's just not only people don't that underestimate the power of the water some people don't underestimate and understand the power and the wrath of mother nature.
Were closing off flood lands in Mo. to build nice homes. yall deal with the waters now
Wow. I have never seen water rise that fast. Was this nearby a river? I'm trying to comprehend where in the world the water came from that quickly.
B Noah On Sneaky 👤
Did anyone se see the spirit go across the screen at 1:34/1:35 or just me!?!
Where is Waverly?
Just awful, poor people
Where the hell is  This town at newsboy does say. continent of North America
Prayers to Tennessee .. After storm there's a bright 🌞 sunshine ahead  Everyday is a blessings......
I'm trying to picture what I would do with my family in this same situation. It's scary. Mike did a great job and got his family through it. Wishing for a speedy recovery for my Tennessee brothers
Your kids were not up at 10am? Dayum
So sorry to all those affected. It's terrible
What a smart level headed guy. The world needs more people like him. My prayers for you and yours sir.
Can we all appreciate how this one news station somewhere next to nowhere spoke like all news people should with actual compassion without inserting their BS.
Fires from drought in the West, massive destruction from floods in the East. Water is supposedly the strongest of all the elements; even a small amount can sweep a person off their feet and into filthy flood waters. My deepest condolences to all impacted by this. 🙏
This is the beginning of all the natural catastrophes we will see as this planet cannot bear our pressure on it any longer. Unfortunately it will shake as many of us off as it can to stabilize the natural order of things. We are nothing without this planet, and everything is connected, and killing us means nothing to it if it means protecting the rest of the species that live and share this world with us. May God and this planet have mercy on us.
There is also a Waverly Pa
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️
Absolutely horrifying!  Prayers for all who are trying to recover and cope with the aftermath.
What a kind man Michael is.
I love the guy's voice who's getting interviewed.......Tennessee/Texas slang......kinda country and little rock in roll ......rolling on the river. God bless everyone.......🌎
My prayers go out to the family of the friend who jumped into the water to save someone and ended up drowning!🙏🏼
prayers? what's the matter with you brainwashed people?
What a wholesome man! Wish him nothing but the best!
Nuts !!
Insurance companies coughing noooooooo that's not covered that's a act of god. Since when you heard you insurance adjuster pray with you. Now they have faith when they wont pay you. Lol
The old weather machines doing their job well. Controlled by those who love human suffering. And if you think I'm kidding, think again.
What a wonderful calming voice on the aftermath of this disaster.
May the Lord bless these people and their city and may he provide financial means for them to recover. Condolences and prayers are with all of the families who lost loved ones during this tragic situation. May they find comfort and strength in Jesus Christ.
Yeah it’s that climate change things have changed the Colorado river is going dry and now there’s a bunch of water somewhere else how did that happen
Our prayers are with you and your community Michael.
It's like we have to go through this every ten years. People need to learn to stop playing with mother nature and thinking that it can't be all that bad. It can and it will. And this has been happening all the way since before America was even discovered.
非難するタイミングの見極めはとても難しいのがわかる記録映像
At 1:37 something flew out from under the house. Not of this 🌎, we'll not human. It was a spirit...Lord Jesus Christ 🙏🏽 protect ALL of your children.
Did anyone notice that black shadow flying through the top of the water I did
What a really good guy, thanks for sharing. That’s probably the best report as seen on the Waverley floods
Yeah, prayers are always going to work.
🙏👑🕊️
Cars stayed in a fixed position, heck I'd take my chances inside a truck
This situation really sucks....  I am very sorry for this gentleman.... however, this is exactly why I don't live in a place like this.... make sure you don't live in a flood plain....
Why does it take lots of rain, fires all over the west, Texans freezing in February and more hurricanes in the east in order for the religious to admit climate change is real and probably man caused?  If you lock a man in a greenhouse with a idling car at 5pm, and open it up the next morning, HE IS DEAD. Finite space, ONE exhaust pipe, 12 hours.  Now Google “global vehicle fleet number” or similar to find for yourself the global car fleet is well over 1 billion. At any given second 2/3 of that is running. 24/7! Then realize the atmosphere is finite, it’s just about 7 miles up from the ground. Do the math and figure out that volume but the point is; it is finite!   So on a small scale; one man, fixed volume of a greenhouse, ONE exhaust pipe, 12 hours and you get a very decisive outcome…dude is DEAD!  And all the denier jackasses think hundreds of millions of exhaust pipes running 24/7 in a bigger fixed volume given enough time…is going to have “no material effect”?   Really it makes me question democracy. For if enough idiots voted the earth is flat, what would we force JPL and NASA to base their mission calculations on this “alternative fact”?   Where does the stupidity end?   Enough of these jackasses voting for stupidity doesn’t change the fact that the earth is not flat. The NASA and JPL missions would fail because enough jackasses voting against a fact doesn’t make it so.
God bless that beautiful man
Damn .......
So so sorry for this mans losses and all the people and animals there my prayers are w you all!
This guys perspective is amazing, God bless him
God Bless America?
Act of God. He is trying to wake people up before the End comes.
We must all turn to God YESHUA IS RETURNING SOON FRIENDS 🙏🏻🌾📯
I believe this because back when Hurricane Matthew hit North Carolina and caused devastating flooding in my area it was quick. One moment we noticed the water beginning to cover the street in front of our house and by the time everyone grabbed a few things and headed out the door to our cars, the water had made it to our front doorsteps. We made it out by driving  through our neighbors fence behind our house. When we were allowed back the next week the water had been up to 4 feet in our house. All this was around midnight. I was thankful that I was a night owl and noticed the water when I did because if not we would not have been able to make it out. No lives were lost in our neighborhood because the men went around banging on peoples doors to let them know about the rising water and to help them escape. I feel for this man who lost family and friends.
Horrible infrastructure. Build where you should. I’m from the mountains of West Virginia. There are so many floods my grandparents told me about that aren’t written down. Government, coal companies, AND unions acted like they cared… until the new workers were shipped in.
America seem to only understand one another during tragedies.  God bless this man.  Sure wish peace would stay still.
Not the package!
Feel like less thoughts and prayers and more activism and outreach would be a better idea but alright
Where's Waverly?
Imagine 30 days and 30 nights of nothing but rain, we don't believe that can happen, but beware cuz it's coming.
He asked the question, "why?" Sir, this is all explained within the Bible.  The Lord is getting ready to judge the whole earth, but He's giving people one last chance to repent.  Call upon the Lord while He is near!
🙏😓
Mr.Phillips im so glad u and ur family made it thru the flood.
my girl from there she sold  everything and moved ,this happens every other year ,they should build homes 10 ft in air or stop living there
Praying for Waverly, TN.
Do whatever you can to move to higher ground.
Prayers and thoughts for this man.
He said "what caused this"? Bruh must not watch the news.
God is warning mankind that we are out of control with hatred and division towards each other- we need to choose love and kindness and live like Jesus teaches us to live - more warnings are coming and if we still don’t repent His judgement will come- receive Jesus now while He is still merciful and loving but please understand He will not wait for ever because He is a God of justice and He will bring justice to those that are suffering
"this is a video that may be hard for some to watch"...    what that really indicates is that we're a society that is largely clueless, inexperienced, sheltered, weak, and unprepared  - for a whole host of reasons.   It would benefit us all if part of our growing up/maturing/learning included volunteer work helping in disaster areas around the world - we'd have a much better appreciation for tragedy, human suffering, sensible measures, practical living, and adapting to climate change whether cyclical or anthropogenic.
Prayers for these people! I do wish they would tell what state .vids like this never do & we are left to wonder
so how does this happen? nearby river overflowing?
WHERE IS WEAVERLY????????
10 minutes, that's all it took. Nowhere near enough time to even think about what's happening.
Pisces be like mood
Wow, that was fast!.... They literally only had seconds to get to safety, once that water reached their front door!..... So glad that he and his family are safe!.....
The reporter in the blue shirt. You need to grow pair of balls. There's far worse things happening.
Thanks for the info. Where would you go if you were to die today? Seek the Lord and saviour Jesus Christ before it's too late.  John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Hell is real and Heaven is also real. You don't want to spend an eternity in Hell torment without God. The only way to escape Hell is to follow Jesus Christ our Lord and saviour. Study the KJV Bible to know more and pray and seek until you find Jesus. Don't delay tomorrow might be too late. You are not promised even the next minute. Do it now
Wow!
Where in the heck is Waverly? This local station gives no context.
💞
Um that's where the truck went 😳
Exactly why I chose to live at an 8,000ft elevation.
Well, to answer Michael's question about what caused it, is the climate crisis. Let's all take some time to thank the huge, evil, conglomerate corporations that continuesly destroy the planet. You guys deserve a gold star.
If this happens to you and once the water starts reducing and the floor is still wet you’re gonna have to put a lot of vinegar on the floor so it doesn’t mold
Wow. Incredible. That water is raging. Thats a damn scary scene.
Omg
Just bad water infrastructure.
CLIMATE CHANGE OVERPOPULATION WE ARE OUT OF TIME
I don't know what to say besides I'm glad you guys made it out alive terrifying video
I'm gonna have ptsd after watching this. It's just flooding, gotta love these reporters. At same time I'm glad he's alright and bless the one's we lost.
I'm sorry but I have no sympathy for people that build in natural disaster areas. You dug your own hole bud.
What caused this? Gas cars and trucks,  keep driving those ice cars people lets see more cool videos like this.
What's sad is the cliches of 'It's gunna be a process" and "We"ll get back to a good place". What does that even mean? How about we get after Congress to push President Biden's infrastructure bill through reconciliation. Or maybe just continue with Thoughtless Prayers?
Could Waverly TN be sitting on an ancient flood plain???
Absolutely terrifying.
My prayers to you all
Wow, in just a minute it went from grass to raging river! How could anyone prepare for that or even respond?
Scary!
Except that you didn't show the video.    Gee Thanks!     Shit reporting as usual from the mainstream dumbdown media.
All these videos are reminding everyone, that no matter who you are, when devastation hits, the number one thing people do is pray, want prayer, and cry out to God! But I ask you all to start seeking God before devastation hits!
It doesn't say what state it is.
Is this In Canada?
Not sure where Waverly is but thats insane
My goodness, God bless you all
Real life Cleveland brown
This just the beginning
That the government controls the weather they can do what they want and if they’ve decided to flood your town freezer town over turn off your electricity make it to where you can’t communicate then they will do so because you say it’s OK because you still go to your jobs and you still buy into their systems and you still pay your taxes in you still tell them the money is real all these things that’s why
Is this Waverly , Virginia??
Global warming aT work?
Where is Waverly ????
Interesting spot at 1:36 , what was that at top left?
Forget prayers and thoughts, stop driving climate change.
water flows downhills towards impoverished neighborhoods and that’s why it’s racist and needs to be cancelled.
I once had to jump out of canoe in fast water to grab a paddle, but needed all my strength with legs fully braced to withstand just a foot and a half feet of moving water, basically up to my knees.    It was very alarming.   For flood zones like they are in, I'd keep an inflatable raft ready to go at all times.    Or better yet, don't own a home in an relatively active flood zone.
for god so loved thee world that he gave heth only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not die but have everlasting life...belief in Christ Jesus be a free gift from the father, given to them [ through thee hearing of heth words ] whom he hath chosen for salvation....    .    .     .
Why did this happen? Because every level of government that can get their hands on it has been stealing the infrastructure maintenance and repair money, just like they'll do with this new $3 trillion infrastructure bill, and the drainage systems are just a part of what's not maintained.  😠😨
This is wild
There called a flash flood for a reason like did people just not forget what that means like tf common sense man.
10 minutes.....  it's going to take that long to get one of the kids out of the bathroom.  Literally would die waiting on a teenager
👍, "Just the right amount of water to go Kayaking."
Some Stupid questions.
I can't imagine seeing my vehicle float by or my home flooded with water. 😦
More free shit from the government coming soon 🎉
What sort of clouds carry that much rain, they can unload so fast ? We are too complaisant with the theory it is nature. This is not natural.  Either nature is going through radical changes  or global warming is hitting us between the eyes.......this is not due to the ice cap melting.......this is torrential and suspicious....RAIN ! ..
Holy Cow! I’m getting life vests for my household.
Canada’s radical government has been cloud seeding since August 2019. They have sprayed more chemicals in the sky than any other country because of Canada’s carbon tax. Please pass the word that cloud seeding is responsible. I’ve been collecting proof for two years
Our Sins caused it...
Looking at the video timestamps - it was literally 3/4 minutes e between grass you could walk on to the water carrying away cars
Don’t live in a flood zone.
When you do that prayin', ask the lOrd why hE did it in the first place...
Where is Waverley?
So where is Waverly?
Sure this isn't Louisiana?
These tragic events are increasing at a rapid speed throughout the world. 97% of Scientists who are working on things related to weather and climate are sure that global warming is the cause. Now it is extremely important that government put carbon taxes on big industries and companies to stop them polluting our planet and gradually choose green methods to manufacture.  Many stats hint that if we don’t shift to renewable sources of energy then we can lose upto 100 million lives in only 20 years, leave alone the destruction that will be inflicted.
Blame on railroad?????
Prayers for the People of Tennessee and beyond.  I'm from Chattanooga
Can someone explain how it really happened? Looks like a dam broke.
Deep State manipulating weather
That is insane and very scary. And although it's rare, it can happen anywhere. How on earth can you prepare for something like that?
🙏
Mother Nature.....undefeated
Omg was this recently? I've never seen Waverly flood like that before.That would be terrifying to go threw i could not imagine, prayers for everyone involved.
Weather Warfare and Modification Systems=Geoengineering! Where is all the "good" weather? Only massively destruction here, there, EVERYWHERE!
It didn't even look like was raining. It was like a giant swimming pool gave way or something. That's crazy
God bless him ❤️
What caused it???? Global climate change! Are you new here??
Lord forgive us for our sins💔🙏🏽❤️
Sorry for your loss..😔
Hence the term “Flash Flood.” Awful that people lost their lives and loved ones.
if you look at waverly tn. you can definitely see "how" it happened, low ground near the tennessee river, at a point where it bottlenecks and drastically changes directions.     the mention of "thoughts and prayers", but not one mention of *climate change...*  just keep ignoring it you morons.     you haven't seen anything yet.
It's heartbreaking what these people lost and I do feel very bad for them. But.... I dont understand. Basically half the state is at or below sea level. Hurricanes have hit the state literally every year for thousands of years, and will conrinue to hit. It will continue to flood. Lives will continue to be lost. Um.....maybe don't live there??
OMG!!!
What state is Waverly in?
Wow!!  In less than 10 minutes it went from nothing to a roaring river.  God bless you sir and sorry for you're losses.
In 10 minutes went from no water on the ground to washing trucks away!!😳
God hates Waverly.
So articulate in his interview! It wasn't the voice and speech that I had expected to hear from this incredibly intelligent and resilient man. My condolences for all of the tragic loss that occurred on that fateful day. I pray for a fast recovery and deep healing for all of those affected by this flood.    Opinion: I simply can't stand this "ebonics" method of speaking. Not thick country accents. They sound like they're talking with a mouth full of food and the conjugations are all incorrect and shortened. It's a lazy form of speech and it represents a lack of interest in being a productive member of society. Now, go look up the word "articulate" and compare it to "ebonics"
So sorry. He seems like a nice person. I’m glad he is safe.
' that is why many newed or used vehicles are tooo light weights same as boats
Even demon running away from basement I can clear I saw one running away 1:35  very sorry for all lost in 1998 I lost my home and everything I own in huracan mich totally destroy my small country Honduras 😱
God Bless America
I didn't really believe in flash flooding. I always thought how crazy people must be not to get to safety but this shows just how fast and how bad it can be. I had no idea it could come out of no where like that.
2 Chronicles 7:14 “If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.”
Weird i lived on Waverly dr
Prayers won't do anything. We need action, people, and prayers do not count. Vote for politicians who demand climate reform. Vote for leadership who will take care of the people. Otherwise your prayers are for naught.
Weaverly? Which state?🤔
The dogs just imagine
Global warming, folks. Crazy weather patterns from now on
there fucking with the weather people
Thoughts and prayers don't do anything. What people need is a fix.  Why did this flooding happen?  How can people prevent it in the future? ACTION IS FAR BETTER THAN "THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS"!
Weather control at work
This type of stories shows us that we need to be prepared for the worse. I live in California. We are in a drought. While floods are happening on the other side of the world. Prayers and faith for everyone
My prayers are with you and your family Michael. I hope your community bounces back from this.
Nice
i have it within my power and responsibility to bless or curse the nation .God has given me that responsibility .And i cant bring myself to pray for this godless God hating nation anymore .Even if you kill me i wont pray for this godless nation any longer .I would rather be dead than a slave to evil
Do you surrender yet America ? will you change course or will you continue to change morality instead ?
That's why we need to take care of our environment . Because it will really hit us hard. Plus your official should have a water damn project and a manhole so the water will go there and prevent flooding
Thank you for the footage; it is clear how quickly people in cars and gods forbid, basement apartments, were overcome without time to plan or even react.  You hear of people trapped in cars and assume they were trying to drive across moving water.  NO, the moving water just engulfed them. Ugh.  My sympathies for the families of the victims.  I don't think I'll ever live in a basement apartment again. Just sayin'.  I so want to HUG this man.
When you hear of people drowning and you think "wouldn't happen to me, i'd be long gone before the water got high", this video puts into perspective that sometimes there is no warning and no escape.
Wow, that was fast!
Moving so fast too..that is what kills
Waverly WHERE? Louisiana? Pennsylvania? WHERE?
One apparent and consistent characteristic of climate change is extremities in weather phenomenon. Extreme heat, cold, rain, storms, etc. The more rapidly the change occurs the more extreme all weather becomes. The argument about cause doesn't even matter anymore.
This is wild. We had a flash flood yesterday and though it didn’t get as bad as that, I almost thought it would. It came out of literally no where. Mother Earth is coming back with a vengeance.
What cause it? Global warming!!! Never will be good again
Scary.  Makes me realize that I don't have a plan if this happens in my neighborhood.
Yeah thoughts and prayers are going to fix this
Good job getting your kids up and ready to move
Where the eff does all that water come from. Thats just an unfathomable amount of water just coming at you like an ocean. Like where does it end it would seem like.
Wizards of Waverly Place
Never seen anything like this before.... I'm just glad it is not global warming and climate change... Or we would be in trouble 😳.  PSA: you wanted a sign? This whole last few years has been your sign. Have you been taking notes?
God controls the weather and hes making it very very clear that there is a serious problem, SIN IS HEAVY AND THE EARTH IS PASSING, and JESUS IS COMING BACK!!.......Time is running out 📣 it's time to repent turn from sin turn from wickedness be born again!! God is warning us!!
The loss of life is so sad.  We hope Waverly recovers.
WHAT THE GELLL to USELESS WEATHERMAN  that every TV STATION HAS... USUALLY they have like 8 USELESS TV WEATHERMAN that when the NEWS stars  with a FEW MINUTES they ask the WEATHERMAN HOW IS THE WEATHER OR IS HOT,<< yesss IS HOT is D@@@MMM SUMMMER.. and all those 8 WEATHERMAN which include like 2 latinos SPANISH WEATHER PEOPLE for the SPANISH TV  FAIL to NOTIFY PEOPLE that there was going to PART OF TOWN  it was going to get a TOWN OF RAIN...DONT THE WEATHERPEOPLE hAVE THOSE RADARS that DETECT that a lot of LOT OF RAIN IS FALLING and then SENT A EMERGECY WEATHER ALERT for that part of town  especially if there is a CREEK OR SOME SMALL RIVER, and seek higher ground.. DIDNT LIKE 12 people die..and this happend in United States with all the FANCY TECHNOLOGY NOT in SOME BANANA POOR FOREIGN COUNTRY.. and same thing with all those DEATH IN NEWTYORK AND New Jersey again thOSE USELESSS WEATHERPEOPLE including the Spanish weatherman  DID NOT SEND EMERGENCY ALERT a TON OF WATER WAS COMING for PEOPLE that live in BASEMENTS and now over 40 people are death...
So devastating.. I cant believe how positive this man is after all that has happened.  This is going to become the new normal over the next decade
I hate it when people say why, what caused this? Seriously? Everyone has to take Earth science in school.
My prayers for you sir Michael  be brave.
Wow
He said what caused this. I wonder.
We can control our weather just like how Texas froze over
very unnatural these waters
You ever notice you never hear from the Water Management District when stuff like this happens. And no mention of federal emergency Management Authority. I bet Governor Ron DeSantis doesn't even bring it up. Or do anything about it. The governor is much too busy with all his lawsuits against Palm Beach County for the school board of Palm Beach County enforcing kids to wear masks. The governor would rather have the kids go to school with no mask. So it appears to the visiting tourist that there's no problems in Florida. Governor Ron DeSantis loves to hide things under the rug. And pretend they never happened or are happening. Just more proof that Governor Ron DeSantis could care less about life health or safety.
It’s amazing how fast it builds by watching the clock on the screen.  That’s crazy 🥺
This is scary, feel bad for the people who were affected :(
Repent
Typical DUMB ass news today... "Waverly - where???" The planet Mars? Shouldn't have to Google or dig to find this out
Give both of these guys a raise!
😪
Its heartbreaking and Al might it's not sleeping it's back fired on Us.  🙏 praying
It's from all the blasting of the can balls blasting into the grounds
What a great news guy! More prayers comen up!
Damn!  Had no idea it was that sudden.
What state is this
Apparently a creek had been blocked near a railroad bridge.  Efforts to remove the debris were "stonewalled" by state and federal regulations that were designed to "save endangered species"...which are now dead in people's homes and flooded out cars along with 20 people.  Environmentalists and bureaucrats strike again.  Well done.
🙏🏽🕊
So prayers and thoughts?  That hasn't worked so far.  Maybe a little reading about and understanding man-made climate change.
Waverly... sorry for the loss especially of life. What State Is this?
His friend died trying to save someone. GOD said no greater gift than someone giving their life for someone else.
Thank God climate change had nothing to do with it. Must of been Obama’s fault.
2:07... HAARP
A.O. Smith. Pay this man. Give him a new water heater LOL
God be them all in Jesus Christ name amen ✝️❤️‍🔥✝️
2:05 And will it happen again?
So sorry for your and others' losses.
I know Mike.. Strange to see you're home flood and know folks who died.🙏 Waverly Tennessee here
17 inches of rain aint nothin, Smethport PA had over 30 inches in 4 hours. A place in WV had 20 inches in 2 hours. The theoretical is meeting climate change.
What cause this!
"What caused this?" People still dont know about climate change?
It's happened in loads of countries why never in Dubai??
Where did this happen I'm sorry to even ask that but I've seen or heard nothing about it
I'm guessing that this is about Waverly, Tennessee, although many states have a Waverly.
Why are they spraying the sky on the west mountains
I don’t question GOD  everything that’s happening in this world today the floods the wars the violence the hatred god said it would happen. God is real heaven is real and hell is real. No one knows the day nor the hour not even the angels in heaven.
So sad to see bless them x
What a sweet soul. Bless him, his family, and the people of Waverly. ♥♥
There's a black smokey circular mass moving across the screen from left to top of screen at 1:35-137.  Looks demonic to me.
Hello people this is God’s wrath on America’s hateful racist greedy ways. We’re now a Godless people, just look at all the gun violence we are currently seeing.
Where is Waverly? What state?
Why doesn't the weather media call this a monsoon like they do in the West? Because it is a flash flood here too.
Wow.  That was fast.  They need some kind of an early warning system if this is the new norm with climate change.  No one could have gotten out of that.
Where tf is Waverley?
Uh for a man who just lost 2 cousins, a friend & most of his stuff, he sure don’t sound to put off about it. Must not be family & friends he cared about i guess. That or this is bs
“What caused this, never seen anything like this before”? Hhhmmmm ?   Old Greek saying  “control the food you control the people!  “Control the weather you control the world”! 🤷🏽‍♂️🥂🙇🏽‍♂️
Now that our government is pushing climet change, it's seems odd, that every time it rains, it floods! What's going on! I'm not buying into this climet change crap!
I wish you'd share the unedited video. We can't see how fast it rose with your jump edits.
Where is this?
Gods blessings to you 🙏🤝 🐓
they knew.  they could have warned people and did not.  murder.
My heart goes out to this man, his family and all the people of Waverly, hello from Canada.
Where did this water come from??? Rain? I don't see any. Dam break? I didn't hear of any except the hundredth time the 3 Gorge dam busted. Dike break? Who knows????
"Why"... um, because shit happens. This planet was raging long before humans showed up, and it'll keep raging long after we're gone.   "Why" indeed... it's not about you, human.
WOW! Talk about being scared. Our neighborhood flooded with Irma but nothing to this magnitude. My prayers are extended to all those that perished and/or lost their homes/ personal belongings in this recent storm.
Your thoughts won't do anyone any good. But your prayers will, if you're a follower of Christ.
Where is Waverly?
Prayers Sent!!!!
TY for showing us this video & while disturbing it shows the timeline on just how quickly people had to react. So happy & sad that Michael's family was saved but his cousins lost & to ALL others who lost loved ones we DO continue keeping you in our thoughts & prayers. Please God Bless Everyone.
Repent and find your creator. These times are only going to get worse, end of a time is coming.
You should include - at least in the description - where and when this happened.  When you put up a clip on YouTube it goes out to an international audience.  This clip just shows some flooding somewhere and says nothing except, 'here's an interview with a guy who experienced tragedy.'
My prayers are with everyone going through this hard time.
Do anybody think is this odd how the water is Rushing in like that where is it coming from okay I know the rivers and sea but what's causing it to rise like that Suddenly pushing it to land like someone are some thing pushing buttons  it's like a pattern in different countries and no one see it coming some thing wrong here climate change Maybe something more sinister most definitely in my eyes
Very sad that his cousins & friend died, & looking at all that flood water, I'm sure lots of animals died too. Very scary how fast it was.
He seemed so sensible, until he mentioned prayers! SMH!
WOW... from country that gets...30 mins of rain...sometimes not for MONTHS and then gets a "6" rain".... 6" between drops on the windshield... BUT THEY ARE BIG DROPS that make clean spots on the W/S and have to wash the car as all it did was jack the humidity up so now 100* and 89% humidity on country that 10% humidity is norm so 100* is hot but not HUMID
Hopeful.  I like that.
NWO baby. Ppl need to OBEY and roll up that sleeve
That is super fast . Type of flash floods you see in the desert?
What the hell!!!
Where is Waverly, Nebraska, New York, Tennessee, Texas if you don’t say where Waverly is what the hell this is YouTube we are from everywhere around the country I don’t know 🤷‍♂️ the name and location of ever town.
Weather machines are real
YET I'M STILL HERE!  We take for granite the force of mother nature and how the things we cherish the most can be wiped away in an instant It's the GRACE OF GOD this man and his family was able to escape...MY PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU AND ALL THOSE WHO PERISHED IN THESE FLOOD WATERS.
Did you ever ask god why this happened ?
We had a flood in our city a few years ago , afterwards I said I'll go and help clean up , some people said we will pray , I said I would rather you get up and help do something useful. If God can't stop a flood he sure isn't going to help clean up.
2:00 Oh honey. It’s the climate change. That’s the why. We are all now in the Climate casino. Never know where will get hit with what.
"What caused this" he says. Vehicles. Lots and lots and lots of vehicles. #1 emitter of CO2, now at the highest PPM in 3 million years. Now I shall see a flood of ignorance.
Just know that this could happen to you any year... the record unprecedented flooding surprised everybody.
Mother Nature caused this her use to it
Great job from the young journalist!
This reporter is such a loser. If you find it hard to watch water, you’re a weak individual that doesn’t deserve to be on this planet
That is insane.
1:35 a dark spirit
Where is Waverly?
What nice coverage. Very respectful. I hope the people there are able to recover.
Why is the reporter doing stupid hand signs?
That's so funny California is in a drought.
Did a dam break or what happened? The rate that the water rose is terrifying. My heart hearts for all of them, I can't imagine. That had to be one of the most compassionate news reporters I've ever seen. Sad that that's so rare nowadays. He did a great job.
Wow. That man Michael has my total respect.  What a great attitude and truly kind person. I can tell.  Yes.  Things ARE going to soon improve.  Jeremiah 29:11 😊🤎🤍🤎💙. So sorry for your loss everyone.  John 5:28 😞
its weather manipulation.
where the heck is waverly!?
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Prayers are going up for Waverly✝️💕
God’s wrath for the sins of humanity! Pray, do penance, be ready and at peace to see you Creator face to face soon. Floods like never seen before in Europe and the U.S; earthquakes in Mexico (All over the country in the last few days) and this is only the beginning. Only God can save us💒
Looks like climate change is no longer affecting only 3rd world countries now!!!
Climate change is what caused the flooding. Reduce meat consumption.
Praying. ❤
I could not have done an interview after experiencing this without shedding at least one tier. Watching it made me drop a few.
Wonder NO MORE Michael, the Bible teaches us that Such ACTS OF GOD is brought upon us because of SIN. Because of this UNTOWARD GENERATION!!!
Poor journalism-  Waverly?  Where- what state-
This storm was deadly and am sorry for all who lost their lives. My Sincerest Condolences to the families and friends.
Seams like a straight up guy. I wish him well recovering from this.
You could stop living in a area that this happens to frequently for starters?!
unpredictable weather nowadays the abrupt over so called wisdom self-catering above anything else ---- advanced technology what's needed are almost nowhere to be found slapstick video slapstick monitoring slapstick mindedness slapstick etc
but hey-zeus not coming????? figures.......nobody wants to say that.........good going america.......your all about god.....🙄
Did anyone pick up the black shadow at the 1:35 minute marker floading up infront of the camera????
What state? Poor animals that were outside.
God is sending us the message that Global Warming has its consequences. Sudden Flooding is all over the world. So, we must heed the warnings.
That reminds me of the flash floods in Tucson!
Sounds like  a great gentleman hope everything goes well with him and his  family god speed
Prays and Thoughts will fix this.
People should be informed what is happening with the climate everywhere on the planet! It's a period of 12000 cyclicity. People from 180 countries held the International conference "Global crisis. This already affects everyone" where scientists explain everything.
Damn mayn😔…bless him…wish I could go help clean up out there…
Fuck this the government should start investing in more natural disaster countermeasures since they were the ones who have approved all of the policies that brought pollution and climate change
Mother nature pissed off beware
Rest In Peace 😔 And my deepest respect and condolences to those who lost someone  and their home
How does the water even get that high that fast.
He sounds like a white country man
End-of-the-world is here dumb dumb humans of the world
Yeah I thought how nice that reporter is✌️best wishes to everyone 🖤
Glad this man and his family are safe, my condolences to those who didn't make it. 🙏
I take it him and his cousin weren't that close.
Wheres Waverly?
This is a new thing about our rains now, of how much can fall in matter of minutes, just like that flooding in China, in one downpour it was a year's worth of rain.
Hard to watch? This is classic flash flooding. Saturated ground conditions set the table. Then another big round of heavy rain on top of it. Tennessee was primed for this by the previous heavy rains. Pure runoff with no buffer. Sad for the folks but predictable.
Best response I have heard.  "Why?" Excellent question!
Oh my God I'm praying for everyone so sad 😥😣
The man in the video being interviewed asks why did this happen...it's because most of the icebergs in the arctic are melting.  Means more water in rain storms.    The heat will get us long b4 co2.   We need to lower planet's temperature  along with cutting emissions slowly.   Those pollutants are creating a masking effect,  otherwise it would be even hotter now...DONATE to the Meers ReflEction Project before its too late.  It's humanity's only hope! Govts won't be able to help because they are bogged down with too much bureaucracy.
We have to learn a hard hard lesson to learn from this. We must pray before this happens not during nor after.  Don't pray when something happens  Pray so something doesn't happen.  That's the true prayer 🙏 and the power of it.
Amazing , he didn't learn anything , the thing to take from this is ... when they say evacuate , they mean YOU , get the hell out !
I have realized  the earth belongs  to God.Wind rain and the sea are his soldiers  he can use them to say hey have you forgotten  I'm in Charge.
What is that black thing to the left flying at 1:36?
Haarp technology. Satan wants to bring destruction before he claims he is the ONE
Amen and Amen
The townships better get a plan together, to dreadge the creeks ,pull out all the silt and create depth in the creeks ,so this flash floods water has a place to go, let the creeks do what their designed to be, but townships neglect keeping them clean, and the use lots of pipes to drain water xx these pipe get smaller as they are tied together, and they help cause the flooding,.  Silt from construction projects clogged up the creeks.. we seen that happened here a liberals worried about hurt little fishes in the creeks, but don't care if people bliss their property and lives to save the fishes, come on, grown a brain, clean out the streams....
Wow....... here one second gone the next!! i thank god for every minute and hour i speak walk and talk god thank you . God Bless you Mike for your life you lived to tell what happpened to you with that flooding.
Warning us flood waters are hard to watch. But, all that riot action was fully forced into the faces of people without warning. Fascinating the vocabulary use...
2 minutes ...wow
Oh my goodness. This is horrible. The loss of life is just heartbreaking.  I've never seen water come up that fast, no time to think much rather escape..😥
* If ever we needed THE LORD  before-we SURE do need HIM now.  "Focus on GOD-and NOT your problems.")

Is this Waverly VA?
The one who sees this comment: GOOD LUCK TO HIM AND HIS WHOLE FAMILY.
1:36 ghost???
Amazing !  Simply Amazing. People if you don’t believe in God and the Lord Jesus Christ now is a good time to believe.  A lot of Christian people died in Waverley that who are in Heaven today and some that died that are not in Heaven today. But that’s how fast you can be taken to your eternal home. Prayer go out to all who lost family members.
The city people are supposed to clean out strom drains 2 x a year they dropped the ball they need to get serious about storm drains this kinda stuff  wouldn’t be half this bad they they are trying to blame  the weather Not it’s the city workers who don don’t do their JOBS 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
😳😳🥺🥺 that is absolutely horrific.
This is a great video to explain how dangerous floods are. And why they should be taking extremely seriously
biden weather
*He definitely was raised around southern white folk!!! HE HAS NO AFRICAN AMERICAN DIALECT IN HIS SPEECH*
He asked for prayers… on it! 🙏🙏🙏
Wow
Sorry for your losses.
Man made agenda 21
Climate change caused it!!
Sorry for your losses Sir.. praying for healing
God bless everybody be safe out here please it's no joke shit is starting to hit the fan👼👼👼👼👼
Sucks to live in a floodplain zone...
Warning and Judgment already started on US get to repentance and coming to Jesus,  the kingdom of heaven is near.  THIS IS ALL A GLOBAL WARNING FROM GOD, AND AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO BELIEVERS THAT JESUS IS COMING SOON. GET READY!!!
God blessyou brother from canada
life can throw a curve ball... and this one was scary !!!!!
Human1: you might want to up your Self-preservation game for this (insert news event of biblical proportions). Human2: I'm good I prayed. Have you even read the bible? God never lets anything bad happen to his followers.
Man caused it! They have a way to shot electric currents in the clouds via drones! This has been going on for years! It’s happening everywhere and fires are being set by drones too! Here come the bugs carrying COVID-19. Mosquitoes!
Hard to imagine the swiftness, without this documentation!
That truck was floating in TEN minutes if I read the timer on the video right.
As well as thoughts and prayers, please start thinking about climate change. The weather is changing, and not for the better
FYI, you're on YouTube that people around the world look at. Everybody doesn't know where Waverly is and I'm not sure either. Are we talking Waverly Alabama or where???
Waverly was my home for a few years. I just left this may 1sr. My heart hearts to see the damage and the loss of life and the suffering. Love and prayers are being said daily.
Better get used to it, climate change means this kind of thing will happen more often and with less warning.
A little off subject but...that man speaks perfect english. He also sounds like a teenager rather than an older adult
Fake news I’m across the street and it all dry.. this is a propaganda piece to make it look worse than it is.
I almost died in this too. Very strange how fast the waters came up.
سر فیلم است
Scary and so sad
Excellent, sensitive job by the reporter.
Prayers and thoughts to everyone who’s been effective by this especially the ones that lost a love one stay safe
"41 deaths" meanwhile he knew atleast 3 of them... wtf is goin on
I think its time where we need to change building codes that are located in flood zones .  It just makes sense . There shouldn't be one story homes located anywhere near this area . Any house that was destroyed seems like a prefect time implement this with the help of FEMA and maybe state funds where any increase of FMV due to the construction of these new homes can be leveraged with some  type of 10 year mandatory ownership if you sell within that period of time you need to pay back that money or some other arrangement
Don't buy a house under sea level
It has nothing to do with Ida that we saw coming ?
Read Matthew 24
Damn
The government has the ability to control the weather. They can create & guide storms. I know it sounds crazy, but it is true!
What caused this? Mother nature change. She's always changing. Floods were written about in the Bible. It wasn't global warming. There were no cars.
Sin is the cause of this. People need to turn back to God. Just praying when something tragic happens does not make our creator happy.
Global warming duh
Wow
I'm looking at all the garbage in the background and can't help noticing that the green garbage bins were the first things to be swept away
What a sweet man.  Terrible ordeal, so much loss.  Sorry for those who perished.
🙏🏾
Floodwaters are so scary.
Prayers sir and thank you for sharing
Prayers to all the families that are going through this. We should all think about adding life jackets in our cars and homes. The weather is getting more peculiar lately.
My condolences to this man
Waverly where? What state?
LOL, what caused this? Lets all of us look ourselves in the mirrors.  i would say thoughts and prayers but we use that phrase as an excuse for our negligence these days.
Keep those iPhones, Car etc manufacturers updating and releasing all that toxic chemicals into the atmospheres
Our government has admitted to controlling the weather for decades. Look it up. They are doing this to us!
Where is Waverly? They never quite say in the story. (EDIT: It's in Tennessee, USA.)
This is Waverly, VA?
You’ve got more prayers from over here sir
Karma for laughing at the flood that happened to Chinese just last month.
This looks like there was a blockage up river and it let go
For everybody asking, "Where is Waverly?" It's in the middle of Tennessee.
You can really see how fast it happened by the time stamp of the security camera
The reason for all of this is the same it's called covid-19 the Great reset written by Klaus Schwab. Weaponized weather along with weaponized politician weaponizing the flu
Got to watchout for the flood vehicles on the car market
big prayers for all those who were/ are involved = Be strong plz 🙏🙏🙏👍🍀
OMG-!!!
The world is coming a end the creater is angery because of things that is happening in the world yall need to pray for ur country
So sad, my prayers to all of those lost of lives and lost of their homes. May God hear our prayers! 🙏🙏
Did you guys see the shadow come out the water on the bottom left at 1:35
Weather Warfare and Weather Terrorism !! So sad
2:05  Man: The main thing I think about is- what caused this?  Me: Climate change and global warming.
Please state the state.
:(
No mention of climate change huh?
Wow 10 min makes it’s a huge big impact
Shows you just how fast and dangerous flood water is.
Holy cow it came up so fast like a wall of water coming through all at once! 😳
Be strong God bless u n family    and condenlance to those who lost their lifes
We are really living in our last days
The surveillance camera shows the water just starting at about 1 minute after 10.... by 10 after, it had reached peak. That's just crazy fast. I feel so bad for everyone there!
Hard t believe how quickly it went from no water to 4' raging river - I went back and watched the time stamp....under 10 minutes. No time to react.  So sorry for everyone affected by this, very sad
apocalypsticfloodduetoclimatechange
THINKS. TO. THIS.  GUY ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Yoooooo I just seen a dark flying entity or spirit in this video….Go to the 1:35 mark of this video…😳😳😳
its a rip current on land....if youve ever been in one of those in the water. its literally the same thing
Lord  we pray for those in need.
Nothing last Forever, We need to Change the Future.
One good thing about growing-up in Calif along the coast..we can swim in raging waters.
Bless this man Michael and his family
Mike, my dude, thought I recognized that voice, ain’t seen ya in almost 20 years but so glad you and your family are safe and my condolences on the loss of your extended family members. Getting a lil gray around the edges there buddy. 😝 Glad to see you still have your positive ain’t nothing we can’t handle attitude about ya. Take care my friend. DHW ❤️
Very well done interview. Scary stuff. ✌️
Blame everything to democrats joe Biden
Geoengineering. Man-manipulating weather.
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
This is so tragic.
ABC’s of SALVATION  ADMIT: You’re a sinner, condemned to DEATH (physical & spiritual) .  Romans 3:10, 23 There is none righteous, no, not one … For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  Romans 6:23 & James 1:15 the wages of sin is death … sin, when it is finished bringeth forth death. (Spiritual death is eternity in HELL !)  BELIEVE: that JESUS died, rose again, and that HE ALONE can save you from sin, death, and hell.  Romans 10:9-10 if you: believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.  CONFESS: JESUS CHRIST, and nothing else, as your own Saviour. Romans 10:9, 10 & 13 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus … confession is made unto salvation … whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  Before it’s too late, forever, DO IT NOW! God’s gift is FREE and as easy as A-B-C !
God bless to all those affected. This man is so positive and pleasant, that he was saved to continue to rebuild his community. He's a special person. My deepest sympathy to all
This is heartbreaking to see...   I can say, he's 100% right. Floods are no joke and once the water is in your house- wet carpet turns to waist deep water in under 10 mins easily.
A damn broke it was not a natural flood.  We need to stop calling it flood waters and call it what it was.  A damn broke.  A damn man-made by the railroad.
Wtf you mean what caused this😲😲🤣🤣 are people this clueless and dumb. 😂🤣😂😂🤣😂😂🤣😂. 😏😏😏
Whoever uploaded this video next time put a time and place in the description no one has any idea where Waverly is unless you live in the that area and most people on YouTube doesn't.
Ppl should start anchoring there vehicles to the ground during hurricane season so they dont get washed away and crashing i to buildings it would help alot
Prayers to everyone.  I have to note that I think the news interviewer had an aware respect and genuine kindness in his manner that you don’t see anymore. Thanks for this kind of reporting.
Yall speak as if there's only one Waverly.  What state is this in?
Yowsers!
Praying for them. He is right though " what caused this? Never seen anything like this before. " 🤔
The Book of JUDE is today news  Abba father good news
That guy talks like he's white!
Scary experience!
Might be a good idea not to settle in a place where it floods🤦‍♂️
Master plan ✔️ HAARP Controlled by DARPA  Paid for by AARP  Get it now🤔
Waverly.. Got flooded... :o   Poor man, i feel for him :(
The magnitude of what happened doesn't really sink in until you see a video like this.  It happened so quickly.  There was no time to help anyone.  People were lucky to save themselves and their immediate families.
That is scary
Do not go to the roof for safety The scriptures says that man on a roof should not go into his home when you see the isolation of desolation standing where it ought not to be. This is in fact a BIBLICAL EVENT that was indeed a flash flood
The ENTIRE United States can be engulfed by water.
Leviticus 23:23-25 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation. Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.  Enjoy the upcoming Feast of Trumpets. Shalom.
Climate Change: NOW U KNOW 🕇 NOW BELIEVE 🕆
Mother Nature is Not this Evil, it's Man Made...
The result of people living in area where water once glow naturally when it over flooded now that people live in those area it’s bound to happen over and over agin until the Government makes appropriate water distribution in the area
Stay safe & move to another place.

This looks okay.
Basically your small town is the shape of a giant bowl, the water from rain built up at the outskirts and was held back by higher ground, that higher ground broke and that's why it flooded so quickly.  It's just like a dam broke loose, why don't they explain this to these people?  This can happen again, the best thing to do is to move somewhere safer, this town is not safe.
JFK Jr. has Surfaced, he is alive and talking.  Negative 48
Dang, sir... What an intense accent you have.   Also 'prayers and thoughts' aren't going to help or do anything at all for you or anyone else suffering this way.  We need swift and effective preventative climate change measures implemented right now!
No matter how much humans evolve...we can never stop mother nature.
He's getting sued
Pope Francis this is the result of your stupidity and stubbornness to this obey the instruction of the father God of all creation and all of the college of cardinals. Now the whole world will see more wonders and more to come because you are not worthy of me and all the leaders in the world. I will perish all the nations. I the Lord your God is spoken in many times.
Oh Wow That’s Scary  My Condolences To The Families And My Prayers Are With You May They All Rest In Peace 🌺🌼🌹🌸💐🌹🌹🦋🌈🦋
Why? Seriously? Global warming idiots! Just beginning
Not gettin yet? it is over. gods wrath! stop all development. limit fossil fuel use. Deaf ears. Greedy bozos!
Who is Donald Trump You ever actually stepped back and looked? Ever wonder if he could be the antichrist? Lets look at some things that just might point that direction. 1)Did he announce to the world that he was the son of perdition? On live TV that aired around the world August 2019 he looked to HEAVEN and said " Im the chosen one". 2) He also said before a live audience and on air at Liberty university that He doesn't ask GOD for forgiveness he just goes and does better. 3) He constantly brags on himself and boast oh so much of his abilities. 4) Israel put him on their coin and says hes their saviour. 5) he brought the "abraham accord " supposed peace agreement to the middle east. 6) Look at how the Christian community stands , promotes and worships this blasphemous , lying man.Christians are the ones hes blinding not the lost. Satan already has the lost hes after GOD'S children. 7) The 💉/mark is his. He said when it would be out, and it was, even though scientist and doctors said it wasn't possible. Well it came out when he said.And yes its killing many and not only abominable but altering GOD'S creation. 8) His favorite poem mimics Eve in the garden and people mostly christians eat it up and in their face deception stares. 9)666 is tied to him in so many ways not to mention its his most used hand gesture. 10)He also says he's "the father of the vaccine" 11) At the Alabama rally in August 2021 he was announced as the second coming  Its time people look to JESUS and away from the lies of this world. The end is not coming its here. The mark is the 💉
Holy crap!😯  I was watching the time stamp and wondering how much it was sped up...surely those numbers ticking by aren't SECONDS!  But yeah, if that all happened in the space of 5 to 10 minutes, those were, in fact seconds flying by.😳  I can't begin to comprehend that. But I live in California, and people in other parts of the country can't comprehend an earthquake either.   I'm wondering how his family scrambled up on the roof so quickly, considering they didn't exactly have time to prepare.  So glad they lived to tell the tale, and very sorry for the lives lost.
HARRP and cloud seeding caused it man made
Lucas 21:25-26
Should be titled, MOST COUNTRY BLACK GUY EVER.
Such a tough process Micheal...but we are praying for all of you.
Thoughts and prayers, ok I'm sending a truckload of placebos right down. Hope they help, but I feel better.
Fast moving water is not the time for heroics. My brother worked in water rescue, and so often it's someone who jumped in to save someone else. It shows courage, but it's simply not something the average person can do on their own. The brutal rule of water rescue is to save yourself first, save others once you're sure you can. Some of the worst days was when my brother could see the victim but simply couldn't reach them safely because a river was too fast. Your heart wants to go into that water anyway, but two funerals helps no one. He had so much survivor's guilt because he sometimes just couldn't get to them in time. I hope all those who survived this flood are not struck with that type of guilt.
So terrifying. Loss of life, loss of everything they own. We all can send condolences and words of comfort, however, I can’t imagine the true impact these people are struggling with everyday to recover. Hugs and much love to them all.
CLIMATE CHANGE. READ UP, CHANGE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.
No drains?
Weather manipulation at its finest.
✨Everything is not what it seems✨
Imagine getting through it telling your family members everythings going to be okay and then...an alligator eats you. Hey Jesus....wtf man? Life is just one big question mark.
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Did anyone notice at 1:35 minutes a black apparition flew from this man's doorway and out. WOW!
🌎🔜🔥B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior who Rose again. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️
Look conference THE GLOBAL CRISIS. THIS ALREADY AFFECTS EVERYONE on Allatra TV
It only takes 2 ft. to displace a vehicle. I forget how much knocks you off your feet.
God Bless them all.
Wow just 10 minutes☹️
It's tragic but  Everybody always wants prayers, but who prayed for the floods?
I love your videos!! They're so amazing. Stay safe out there everyone ❤️❤️
What I want to know is... Where were the Wizards???  But seriously, prayers for the victims...💙
My goodness! Ten min of torrential downpour to turn your world upside down!  I've viewed many of these videos in China, Germany & quite a few other countries.  The sheer magnitude of how much water is coming down in a 24 hr period is unbelievable.  It happens so fast you don't have time to react & barely get to safety.  What a frightening experience & tragedy. 🙏
Where is Waverly?
💞Hey you, wherever you are in the world, if you’re reading this  … be BLESSED x 1,000,001 😊😊💛💛🙏🙏 😊😊💛💛🙏🙏😊😊💛💛🙏🙏😊😊💛💛🙏🙏😊😊💛💛
With everything going on, there are still people who deny we in the end times..
Moment of silence for the trash can
What state?
“What caused this?” It’s the universe trying to destroy libtards and democraps!
.
2ft of fast flowing water is all it takes to literally sweep you off your feet
Bless this man Michael and his family
Michael looks solid as an oak. Hope everything recovers well!
I'm so very sorry. Praying for all those affected by this tragedy. 🙏.
The railroad is responsible for the superficial unintentional dam they built, it held back a massive amount of water to be released at once... Their negligence...
that might be the whitest voice I've ever heard on a black man
That's my truck!
That's so sad! I'm so glad family and friends/people helped!
We are Praying 🙏
Wow
can i get the make and model of the camera.......seems like its works real good ...also how was it powered?
Such a reserved man for having gone thru so much with his family. And he had to lose family on top of everything. I hate that he and so many had such hardship. My prayers to them all...🙏
What a guy, positive attitude in the face of a tragedy, makes you proud of America.
Event 201. Never forget.
Cataclysms are intensifying. And this is not an accident, but a circularity. They don't talk about it in the media. But there is still a chance to survive. See details in the international online conference "GLOBAL CRISIS. THIS ALREADY AFFECTS EVERYONE". Translated into 72 languages. Organized by ordinary people from around the world. Just the facts. Let's save the planet!!!
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Read the Scriptures!. It's Lucifer spitting water as Floods ever since he was defeated by Christ and fell in his base in Rome in 2013!!!. The Target here is the brethren of Christ Globally!!. Home and abroad!. After his grandios Father placed the image that makes desolations beneath Mount Zion!!. In Jamuhuri!!. From where Our Brethren were carried into slavery!.
My hart goes out to u sorry about your to cousins. Glad you and your family were ok
"Why.........what caused this"       probably the hurricane my dude
The timeline on this video doesn't exactly prove out that story, and that trashcan has possibly been moved backward toward the curb area, and then it floats off in a completely different direction from where it was the first time...or is that a different trash can. Check out the overlay that happens right after 1:09 in this video. The (top left) camera's video readout goes to 10:01:34, then suddenly there's an overlay, with the time stamp changing abruptly to 10:02:16, then you can see two trash cans for a bit, until right before 1:11 in this video, it's back to one trash can, in a completely different place.  What's up with that?  More than likely, what the guy is saying is mostly true, and the water did come up that fast, but I'd be interested in finding out what happened with the video...did they have to stage something?
Water -- the deadliest force on the planet.
God help these Tennesseans
My condolences Mr. Phillips on the loss of your two cousins and your friend, even though the reporter DoD not think to offer it on camera. 💖🙏💖🙏
Mother nature is making her presence known
This is the definition of flash flooding.
Climate Change cannot be prayed away.
My condolences for all those pot holes and sewage ways that were probably too clogged to take in rain water. Or how the sheep put it. Sorry for your families, it was the weather's fault.
great local news piece. just news
Climate change is something that is still being politicized as being a normal common factor to nature, but the way these hurricane's and floods are magnifying in the North-East and the Gulf Area, things are going to get alot worse. It is sad to hear about the lives lost there, and the young couple that got swept into the river in New Jersey, where at this point, they are still missing.. It's sad news indeed.
Gods telling everyone that thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need to respect the mother earth that he created. If we continue to abuse and pollute more of the hurricanes, fires, mudslides and flooding will happen. We need to respect the giver of life.
If the flooding water comes to you it’s already too late. You have to look ahead and look for signs of flooding. Then it’s best to get to high ground or sturdy tree and hope it goes as fast as it comes 🙏🏽
He was very wise to not get in the water!  Prayers for this family and others as they try to rebuild their lives.
Jesus christ....the fury of Mother Nature..
Good strong man and great flooding report, we are praying for you
Michael your video will be documented for future reference to "flash floods" thank you sir and best of wishes to you and your family.  Thank you for your services to us all.
We are lifting you all up in prayer, if you have any specific needs please let us know.
Prayers, OK,  Thoughts not so much, they as useful as Mamery glands on a Trout
Don't buy a used car in the next few months. It's likely a flood car.
Wow! This video explains so much. You have no time to react or do anything.
Looks like a tsunami
Situation is worse🙄
That's when power is given to Bill Gates and the like; we get another weather algorithm.
People don't understand why this happens if people would study the Bible they will know why we are living in the last days and it's not about climate change its beyond that It's Bible prophecy this is the results of sin in the world and God is getting tired of the mess gun violence, gangs probably, and the old mighty Issis so they think beheaded and  torchering people because they are different from them .then we have the clansmen and masonic racist cops to deal with who have thei own set of rules on the street they don't care about your rights. Then we have the baby children killers they are called Parents against daughters Fathers against children, children against parents 💔 😢. not to mention Rapist and serial killers ,pedophiles,and Mass Murders.  People are being killed for peddi reasons like walking a dog 🐕 sitting at a bus 🚌 stop ,a parking space Really a life is worth that ! Beat downs in Ubers .Thinks are happening now that wasn't happening 2000 years ago the Bible said these things will happen violence will increase worst than it ever was before soon u won't be able to go out of your  house without being murdered or mugged probably by 2025 that's in 4 years or sooner. The Bible even predicted pestilence that's viruses that's uncurable its talks about floods in diverse places it also talks about the earth heating up  they call it global warming what ever its predicted in the Bible. also  Famine people will go hungry soon when all earth support is cut off for God's peoples, also Earthquaks in diverse places. All these are predicted in the Bible 2000 years ago way before little Greta now a teen she is now telling people how to eat the Bible already did that in the book of Genesis and Deuteronomy if many more people was following God's health Laws many would have survived covid the varient is different from Sars 2 covid ,but many people neglect the body temple of the Lord people think the body belongs to them that they can put what ever they want in it or to it even tho he gives us choices but we make the wrong choice sometimes. Last but not lest the Breaking of The Ten Commandments of God which we all have broken as follows ,lieing and stealing comes in all forms cheating on your taxes ,stealing time on the Job,telling the child to tell someone your not home when u are teaching them to lie are  steal  ,taking food off the Job without permission that's stealing and little white lies saying u are to sick to come to work when u are not. kids lie to which they may have been taught from early age by watching the parents do it .Not loving your neighbors but hating them,we have other God's mainly our selves. also the Muslim and issas has  Muhammad and the Japs or Chinese have  budda also many Christians have The Great Pope so they think all having other Gods before Christ a living God not a dead one .Disobedience children will not live long in the Land the Bible says if any one want scriptures just reply that's if u believe in the bible, as for atheists u will have to ask God if he exist because anything I show them in the bible would be pointless. People wonder why thing happened to there children mostly is because of Disobedience I'm not talking about babies or 5 to 10 year olds it's  the 12 on up if u tell your child not to go out side they go and something happens that's  Disobedience like the story of a teen girl suppose to be somewhere but she ended up at a hotel set up by so called friends she was dancing 🕺 on Facebook or tic tock some where she should not have been someone entering her room she was killed she was supposed to be shperoned at a DMB or DMV iDK which .coveting wanting what someone else  has even in the littlest ways and we follow throught with having it for no good reason just because u want it to and wanting your neighbors husband or wife .False Testimonies last keeping the Sabbath Holy is still binding on all Christians Jesus kept the sabbath its the duty of man not only the jews to keep the seventh day sabbath Holy 😀 😊 🙏.
Very rare, honest, and heart-felt television news journalism.  I wish this news crew would move to my town!
So sad and sorry  BUT GOD  IS  SPEAKING  MERCY ON US AND HELP US TODAY
So scary..I use to have this huge fear as a child of drowning..I had dreams of a huge wave hitting and everyone's home was under water..I would keep floaties in the car wherever we went over bridges..and roll the windows down while we went over them..I was always told that's so ridiculous..and the degree I went with it was indeed ridiculous..but a couple years later I did almost drown..Im not as scared anymore though. Thoughts to everyone going through this..and our friends up north..Ida was not kind to them 😔
No way to get away from hurricanes unless you relocate but I think this area should start stocking up on life vests and maybe there will be less drowning.God bless the people that had to endure this disaster 🙏🏽
What caused this? Seriously im sure its rained before!
Thoughts and Prayers for this  man and his family  . this is  something  just horrible  that happened ~
This was an unexpected event, news media is doing there usual that its climate change . Maybe so but fossil fuels are what we use and will far into the future . There the only reliable cost efficient way to provide energy for the world
Wow that's scary as Hell
This is god
Where is the gofundme??????
I love how these reporters act like they give a damn its just a stories to them they don't care
It looks like Grantham and Toowoomba Queensland. Horrifying.
You won't realise it until it's too late. One second you're going on about your daily life, then 2 minutes later you're fighting for your life
Doom's day arriving?
what part does the Corp Of Engineers have in this flooding?  Know what they have done in Nebraska..  Did commie Joe and racist KKKalama visit?  Yea..didnt think so!
He asked “What cause this?” The answer is simple! Humans!
Climate change
God bless this man and his family.
Surfs up
Spent the money on welfare instead of public works, and this is unexpected?  Really?
I could only focus on waverly and where it is is, no where in the report does it mention a state or what storm was causing the flooding.
Holy shit...
Imagine having a flood in your basement, yet after there is a tornado….. Where would you go?
✝️🥀💔🙏
Where is Waverly?
Keep praying, shit will get better, get this man a presidential job
Omg, un just minutes
I complained about poc not being mentioned in news to him and other lady that saved her neighbors and drowned
Why were those floodwaters This time Here? THE deepsea were Ida was formed was three degrees warmer due to erupting underwater vulcanoes. Watch YT August 13 THE Final Days, seen at FAA weathercams.
Unbelievable.
THEY SAY THAT THESE STORMS ARE MAN-MADE.
That was fast and frightening. Changed lives forever in just minutes. Incredible, just incredible.
That was intense.
Hearts of men are cold in the last days,turn now.⌚ For What is the deal if you gain the whole world but stil lose your own soul ❗wake up💤💯💉🧬☠⌛🌊...like in the days of Noah
Good man Michael
Make euro &dollar greet  agains?????

🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Lookin at the debris behind the reporter someones been workin their ass off
People!!! Very vital information with irrefutable scientific facts about what is happening with the climate now. At the conference "Global Crisis. This Already Affects Everyone"
The peoples must leave there homes before hurricane come near them.
We all need to stop praying and start acting.  God can't make the message any clearer people.  We made this mess ourselves.  We are being shown the error of our collective ways as a species. Time to start cleaning it up.  Climate action is overdue!  People will continue suffering horrible losses until we sort our shit out!
What cause this? God’s judgment
"Thoughts and prayers" and nothing about climate change.  Climate change deniers have won... their pyrrhic victory.
God Bless This Man.  🙏🙏🙏🙏 His perspective, thinking about the Lives that were Lost, not his "stuff", now there's a Man with his head/Heart in the Right place!   Too bad this won't get All the views it deserves because it's not Salacious enough.   smh
Quite the story ! So fast, without any warning !  Just to see , that nature is the most detracted for on the planet !
Heartbreaking & Horrible :(
Kudos to this news coverage---it was a caring way to speak, and yet gave us an incredible view and understanding of just how quickly this developed.  I love this man's answer too: "Please just continue with the prayers".  God Bless.  I will continue with my prayers.
God what's terrible feelings  To see something like this in matters of second 🤔
bible is fulfilled end time signs
Lovely gentleman.
Another strange coincidence a city called Waverly gets engulfed by a water wave. How bizarre!
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Didn't american doesn't believe in global warming and ignore it in trump's era?
What caused it is the a holes manipulating the weather, with cloud seeding
Imagine he doesn’t have a clue what cause this. 😬🤔
Please news channel - setup and post a go fund me page for this gentleman - many of us will assist this family if given a vehicle to donate … blessings,  light,  love ✨❤️
so sad, I'm so sorry. How did this happen,was there rain Way up River that filled and came rushing down? , as this was seemingly a nice day in Waverly. Prayer's from Canada.
Praying for you and your family and others impacted by the flooding.
Paying for this man and his family.. Praying for everyone!!!
Where are those anti-China elements who bash China baseless when China just had the biggest flood in 1000 years recently?  Now it is your turn in the US and see what your useless and corporate oriented government can do for you in the disaster recovery efforts.  The flood just happened in the US is nothing in comparison with the one just happened in China.  Yet, in China, it took two weeks most affect the places got back to normal with still renovations and reconstructions taking place.  There are tens and thousand rescuers from the military sent by the Chinese government were there within 12 hours.  Neighboring cities and provinces gathering and sending food and vegetables and medical supplies to the disaster areas to help out.  I don't see anything like that in the US no matter how bad the situation is.  People in the affected areas all they can do is wait and see.  That just incredible for a country often preaching and imposing so call democracy and freedom onto other countries do not even have the ability and effective ways to take care of its own people when they needed it the most.  Same thing on how the two countries handle the Covid 19.  In China, if the number of infected people goes to a two-digit number in the entire country that has 1.4 billion people, is considered serious and tens and thousands people would be asked to do a test.  Therefore, people feel safe to go out and do business as normal.  Here in the US, an infection rate is ten thousand a day is considered normal.  I have to say in situation of disaster recovery and pandemic like this, I rather to be in China and not in the US.
I am sorry for your. loss.
WHAT THE FREAK WAS SO HARD TO WATCH ABOUT THIS.  REPORTERS LIKE THIS SNOWFLAKE IS WHY THE WORLD IS SO SCREWED UP
prayers to all
What people will find this difficult to see, you mean the bubble wrapped kids?,.......THE KIDS , OMG THE KIDS!......Yea, don't show the the reality of life, that will help them if they ever move out of their parents home, give me a break.
Damn if I wouldn't hv seen his face I wld hv thought he was a white guy.
Damn, that totally sucks
You know whats scary is if you go in the water not only do you have a chance of drowning but the water is so fast, it can fling you into something and knock you out cold.  I feel awful for the people who passed away
Calling God: ''The person you are trying to reach is unavailable and has a message box that is full'' Just wait until the insurance companies go broke. If you think God is a no show now, lol, you're in for a massive awakening.
Scary stuff
😥🤧
When you are told to evacuate LEAVE... nature is no joke, property can be replaced you only have one YOU... be safe everybody!
Thoughts and prayers are insufficient.  Use the money otherwise going to Afghanistan now.  HELP THESE AMERICANS.
People underestimate the power of fast flowing water; it doesn't even have to be that deep.
No words...
Praying is no use. Climate change is here. It will happen again next year
Hear my final words to you land of the lost Souls. I Am searching for you, my beloved.. I read your hearts when  I send the destroyer . Why are you troubled. Why are you upset. Is this where your heart lies. Your honor is for the things made. Honor me  and I will stop my attacks. Love me and I will stop the destroyer. Respect one another and I will forgive you for your hate. Who is brave amongst you to stop my fury. Who is mighty to tell me stop. No one, for you cry like children.  Give me a good reason and I  will stop the destruction that I've unleashed upon you.
God is good!!
Off topic: I can't tell you how much he sounds like a white guy.   On topic: So saddened by this disaster. Truly horrible for those that lost their loved ones and homes.
Climate warfare people

So why exactly did this occur or what was the main reason. A lot of times it’s a storm drain or some type of water way that gets blocked during these extreme rain events. It’s not like the water just rose out of nothing u know.  But honestly people!! You need to stop listening to mainstream sources about this next decade we’re all embarking on, and start to look to the ones informing us with facts and historical data. Our earth goes thru cyclical climate events and what we’re seeing may look like something we’ve never seen before or shouldn’t be, but actually this is just the start of what’s to come and no destruction of our energy industry’s and outlawing gas powered cars will save us. If you want to be prepared look at the data and graphs and you will see we’re heading into what’s called a —— “Grand Solar Minimum” where our sun reacts very different than we’re used. Sometimes hitting our earth with floods of energy that can cause anything from more powerful storms like we’re seeing to snow in the deserts. But not just a solar minimum are we in for but also a weakening earth magnetosphere opening our planets door to cosmic criminals that will destroy our life’s as we know them. Prepare yourself and do ur research, protect your family’s and find where just exactly you guys are going to attempt to ride this out. Look for signs in the sky’s of aurora type events becoming more and more common followed by new electrical events our eyes have never seen. Don’t listen to the mainstream for the life of u, there only leading you in the opposite direction. This is an extinction like event and it’s the reason we’re seeing all of these insane new accelerated changes across the world even if your not hearing it from our governments absolutely don’t mean it ain’t coming. There suppressing and misdirecting 24/7 We can survive this but only with having a damm brain!
HAARP
My God !!!!! 😥🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
It's called w3ther3r warfar3 they have been doing it since the 60s
How can we help these folks recover... they might need alot more than insurance will provide.
So Sad!!!! Money spent on unnecessary unjustified wars shall have been used to fight poverty, improve infrastructure, provide affordable housing, no basements shit holes..
Dear God 🙏 have mercy
Wow! Thats amazing speed.We overlook water.We better think in global warming.
Pray then the Government - States - Cities - Communities must plan before the fact & rebuild their Infrastructure Departments 'DOT - Transit Authorities - U.S. Corp Engineers' etc or else! 😁
What a terrible thing to experience! This is happening in so many parts of the country. My parents live in New Jersey and have had some flooding in their house over there, but are thankfully okay. Praying for everyone that is dealing with these disasters. ❤️ 🙏
What caused this? Prayers from all those oppressed , maimed n killed by Americans..Gatno Bay, iraq, afghan...world over
He asked why he wants to know why we're destroying our own atmosphere that's why
Scary stuff, best wishes from Ireland
May God Bless all those affected by these floods.
Something set this off, maybe something blow up?
Wow
Where is Waverly?
Is Jesus Christ Dead? *****************************  do you have the courage to know the truth? 1》 Just like Adam /  If the Messiah was born without a father, Adam was born without a father or mother. Why then don't you consider Adam as a god as you do for the Messiah? Allah, exalted be He, said: 59) -Jesus is, for Allah, like Adam whom He created from the earth and then to whom He said: "Be! And he was.  60) -The truth emanates from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt. (Âl Imrân, The family of Imrân) # messiah_in_the quran ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  2》 Confusion in understanding / Allah supported the Messiah by granting him to perform extraordinary miracles that neither doctors nor anyone else can perform. These miracles, by which Allah supported Jesus and made his preaching stronger, were intended to make people believe in his message and not to regard him as a god. Allah, exalted be He, said: 110) - (Allah will say: "O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My grace (this grace) with which I have filled you and have fulfilled your mother, when I supported you by the Holy Spirit. the cradle, you spoke to men as well as in adulthood. I taught you Scripture, Wisdom, Torah and the Gospel. So you fashioned clay like a shape of a bird, then you blew in it and it became a bird by My permission; you healed the born blind and the leper, by My permission. And always by My permission, you revived the dead (also remember) when I prevented them Children of Israel to worry more, while you brought them the obvious proofs and the disbelievers among them said: “It is obviously pure magic!”  (Al Ma'idah, La Table Servie) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  3》 Messiah is the prophet of Allah /  He is neither god, nor Son of God, nor angel. He is only a man whom Allah has inspired and supported by the Holy Spirit so that he calls people to the Oneness of Allah by not assigning Him any partner. Allah, exalted be He, said: And when Jesus, son of Mary, said:  “O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah (sent) to you, I have come to confirm what has already preceded me in the Torah, and to announce the coming of a subsequent Messenger, named Ahmad. Now, when he had given them the clear proof, they said, "Obviously that is magic!" (Aç-Çaff, Le Rang, 60) # messiah_in_the quran ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  4》 Did you tell people_ / The Messiah only ordered his people to worship Allah Alone and to be sincerely faithful to Him in religion. This implies a warning to his people against his worship and that of his mother as two gods apart from Allah. Allah, exalted be He, said: 116) -And (the day will come when) Allah will say: “O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to men: 'Take me and my mother as two gods other than Allah?” "" Glory be to You! he will reply, it is certainly not for me to say what is not in my right. And besides, would I have said that You would have known it (all the same). Because You Know what is in my being and I do not know what is in Your Being. You are the Supreme Knower of unfathomable secrets. 117) -I told them nothing other than what You ordered me to say: "Worship Allah, my Lord and yours" As long as I was among them, I was a witness against them; then when You had called me back to You, You yourself were the One Who observed them attentively. For You are Witness of Everything. (Al Ma’idah, The Table) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  5》 And don't say three /  Allah, the Unique, created the Messiah with the word "Be" and he was. He is therefore a creature because a divinity cannot be created. The affirmation of the trinity is therefore not justified Allah, exalted be He, said: 171) -O people of the Book! Don't be excessive in your religion. Only say what is true about Allah. The Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, is only the Messenger of Allah, His Word which He sent to Mary and a Spirit breathed from Him. Therefore believe in Allah and His Messengers, and do not say, “Trinity. So stop (saying it) because it is better for you! Allah is indeed one God. How far is His glory from having a son! To Him belongs what is in the heavens and on earth, and Allah suffices as Protector. (An-Nisâ, ​​The Women) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 6》 The Messiah was not crucified / Just like his miraculous birth and his miraculous life, so too is his end a miracle, since Allah saved him from crucifixion and death and lifted him up to Him. Allah, exalted be He, said: 157) And because they said, "We killed the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. "Now they did not kill him, any more than they crucified him, but they were the victims of an illusion. Those whose opinions were divided about it remained in doubt: they have no knowledge of it and only resort to speculation. Certainly, they did not kill him. 158) For Allah has lifted him up to Himself. And Allah is Almighty and Wise. (An Nisâ, ​​The Women, 157-158)  # messiah_in_the quran  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 7》One lesson /  He is a prophet who believed in the books of Allah and His prophets; he followed the path of the early prophets and of those who came after them. Allah, exalted be He, said:  6) -And when Jesus, son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah (sent) to you, I have come to confirm what has already preceded me in the Torah, and to announce the coming of a Messenger who will succeed me, by the name of Ahmad. "Now, when he had brought them the obvious proof, they said," Obviously that is magic! »(Aç-Çaff, Le Rang)    YOU HAVE READ THE QURAN?

God bless uou all especially those who lost loved one's in our
deepest condolences from South Africa. May God bless and keep you all safe.
Praying and all that won't do any good. Preparedness and preparation. But even in this case there really wasn't much you could do but try to help each other best you can. Don't need god to be a good person. Love from TX to those lost and the survivors.
I wish you well, sir. That's a shame that it caused so many problems. That's an interesting accent. Who else legitimately thought it was a Caucasian guy speaking by the audio only?
Horrible. I hope these people get back on their feet.  Also, *never* walk or swim in fast flowing flood water.  It's not river water, this muck is filled with all kinds of heavy and sharp debris like logs, broken glass panes, etc.  You can easily break a leg or worse, and when that happens in a fast flowing flood, that's usually the end.
A know no one will believe me n will tell me different but this is the wrath of God people took God out of America out of our schools legalized abortion killing innocent lives n babies  n the way people is acting n painting the inside churches black n have strobe lights closing churches if y'all repent n get right with God y'all will see how much of his wrath will cease ya'll ma say that am liein n A don't know what am talking about r don't know anything n what's going on then y'all keep believing that but A know the trueth n what's going on n happening n the way the Democrats n government is running America A look forward ta the rapture n be next ta n with ma savior A fear God not man A pray ya'll repent n get right with God before it's to late..............
That is intense.
Mercy blessings Repent of your sins except Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior not to be ugly but we can take nothing with us
It is climate change but it is not climate change: let's rephrase that....Climate changes every day and every minute, weather patterns varies every so often...every 12,000 and more years there is a major switch in the patterns of the weather and that is what we areseeing now...nothing much to do with us producing too much carbon dioxide,  maybe a little...but the majority of the destructive events we see now are just a returning series of events that have always existed...we are just living in the wrong time like many civilization did before us. It is only starting and no matter how many Rio De Janeiro or Paris Accords  those people will sign, we are going down the drain anyway...The only difference between now and 12,000 years ago and/ or 24,000 years ago is that our elites are faster to plan every way possible to tax us, spunge our bank accounts and more, before the real great flood will come back. Between ice ages, younger drias and other catastrophes that we know about, I am wondering how long this civilization is going to last. My heart goes with all those affected by the latest storms in the USA. God bless you all and God bless the United States of America. PS; From an Italian in Ireland.
They really needed to post biohazard signs all over this area.
Omg bless that man's heart...I cannot imagine how hard and terrifying that was for a parent to face that with kids and having to think fast to save all of them when you have never had to face such a thing..😰 I'm so glad him and his family are okay..bless his families huge losses..I'm from Dauphin island in Mobile Al.and I've weathered more storms than I can count but I've never been in anything like that and pray I dont ever have to🙏🙏🙏🙏

It was September 1, 2021. Why did his camera show on August 21, 2021? Was it a different event?
So quickly lives can be gone.  Thank God you’re safe.
I'm so sorry you lost your two cousins and everything you owned...praying to God to bless you and restore everything 10x's more in Jesus Name Amen ⚘ ⚘
So sad
O my God Obey the God and obey his commandments

And even sadder was the "FACT" that the media provided no coverage of the black citizens affected by this tragedy in Waverly ... but now they are interested in their video footage
Jesus is Lord, repent and turn to him, he is the truth and the light

*Waverly, TN* During the early morning of Saturday, August 21, 2021, very heavy rainfall resulted in widespread flash flooding across western Middle Tennessee,
Prayers to everyone.  I have to note that I think the news interviewer had an aware respect and genuine kindness in his manner that you don’t see anymore. Thanks for this kind of reporting.
Ever wondered why the ancient civilizations uses stone for building?
Prayers and thoughts? What's happened has happened.
Just imagine as kids we walking back home because if not raining & we was at the friends house 🥺😭😭😭
Waverly, NY? Pa.? So sorry my Friend, praying for humanity 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
NeWs de la muter PETRUSlah
Very very sad 😞
This is the new normal. Please don’t anybody rebuild any place that flooded.
It isn't magic and prayers aren't gonna do it. This is just the beginning.
I began to write such comments: We all have to solve the equation cataclysms + ecology + crisis - technologies / X = human survival.  Where is the value of X 👉 at the International Conference, which took place on 08.24.2021.  GLOBAL CRISIS.  THIS ALREADY APPLIES TO EVERYONE.  The text is suitable for almost any topic of the video, especially where it is about scientific research, mathematics, etc. The comment has not been deleted even once.  They respond well to him, although sometimes it is a bit weird like "I want to survive cataclysms and see a portrait of my president on the wall," but positively.
Bless this man Michael and his family
2:00 we all know exactly what caused this you just probably don’t believe in or care about it.
You need to move
My condolences to the families for their loss
It is heartbreaking that this man lost everything and two relatives as well. I hate that he and so many others are going through this kind of tragedy
10 minutes!!!  Just 10 minutes!!!   Even seeing the time stamp it's hard to believe it only took 10 minutes.
Is Waverly in a flood zone???,
